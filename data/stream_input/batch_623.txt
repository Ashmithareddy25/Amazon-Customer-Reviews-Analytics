B000I5Y8ZU|4.0|I'm not going to apologize for liking My Chemical Romance, although I know that some people think they're \\"sellouts\\" or some such silly thing. No, they're a great band, and this, their third studio album is no disappointment. The sound is quite similar to \\"Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge\\", but there's a bit more variation here. Great songs include \\"This Is How I Disappear\\", \\"Welcome to the Black Parade\\" and \\"I Don't Love You\\", and there are several more that I'm sure will grow after a few more listenings.  <br /> <br />Those who liked \\"Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge\\" will surely like this album as well. It's even possible that those who thought that \\"I'm Not Okay\\" was \\"too MTV\\" might like this album. Give it a chance!
B000H7JD4K|5.0|Folks, I don't want to duplicate too much what others are saying here but I've been listening to Maiden and metal since 1982 and this could well be Maiden's finest disc. Yes, \\"Brave New World\\" and \\"Dance of Death\\" were very good cds (especially the latter) but this is just at a whole different level! I admit to being a fanboy but I can also step back and take a discerning look/listen, and both of those discs had some filler; and if we're being honest, so too did some of their \\"golden age\\" records - the second side of \\"Piece of Mind\\" is especially patchy. But Christ on a bike, this is amazing! Every song is superb and memorable - the melodies (we haven't heard melodic lines/choruses consistently like this from Maiden in a while), the riffs, the layered, intricate and structured soloing - they all show that maturity can often lead a band to its best work. Bruce once again shows that while he may have lost a bit of his top range (he's not quite the air-raid siren anymore) he has more than compensated for it by tone and feeling.<br /><br />To be honest, and while I deeply respect 'Arry for his vision and what he has achieved with this band, I think that a lot of this has to do with the greater democratic involvement of the other band members in the songwriting process, especially Adrian Smith and Dickinson. Harris has penned some great tunes but he does have a formula and a signature structure to his songs, which can sometimes be repetitive (\\"The Loneliness of the Long distance Runner comes to mind.) Anybody who has listened to Bruce's solo work, and to \\"Chemical Wedding)\\" in particular, will find and hear echoes here. Smith's contributions to Maiden have always been extremely melodic (think \\"Somewhere in Time\\" - \\"Wasted Years\\")<br /><br />As a lot of people are saying here, if you loved \\"Seventh Son...\\" you'll love this. Just get the damn thing already and give this legendary band their just due. It's that good.

0743289412|5.0|Two years have passed since Lisey Landon's husband Scott died.  While she mourned her loss and found an emptiness and loneliness with his demise, the outside world never gave her a moment of peace.  Everyone from college professors to paparazzi to collectors pulled stunts to get the grieving widow to acquiesce to their demands to allow them to catalogue his papers and publish his final manuscripts.  Scott was a rarity, as an extremely popular author with strong critical acclaim.  The last intruder threatened to harm her if she failed to give him access.<br /><br />Sick of everyone, Lisey decides peace will only come if she chooses to donate her beloved late spouse's papers to a reputable archival library.  She begins to organize his work while someone increases the threats to physically hurt her.  Though frightened Lisey hears Scott's voice advising her to go to the dark place where he and his dead brother used to escape to hide from their psychopathic father and where he as an adult found his muse.  She trusts his love for her and ventures to this dark place where beauty and horror reside side by side as Scott's demons dominate, but here in Boo'ya Moon, her demons surface to destroy her if she lets them.<br /><br />This is a haunting love story that is part psychological horror and part parable as Stephen King is at his best with the dangers of traveling through the darkness of the mind to reach a personal enlightenment.  Readers see first hand what disturbed Scott and how he dealt with his nightmares as well as Lisey's fears and strengths.  While there is real potential harm from those making demands of Lisey, the most dangerous and ironically loveliest place in the world is the imagination.  Mr. King is the king with this terrific touching tale.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|Ironically, i am going to try to put into words a description of an album that is itself beyond what words can say. I have been a long time MY CHEMICAL ROMANCE fan and was amazed by their second cd Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge.  My taste in music would not include the genre that MCR covers but i am drawn to them because they are simply incredible. With this new cd, their sound is a little different. Not as much scremo going on with a cleaner sound. I you a re a fan of punk, pop, rock, emo.... anything... this cd is incredible and you should pick it up as soon as possible to experience it for yourself.
B000DZIGDU|4.0|I was reluctant to see this 2005 film.  I had read this 2003 memoir of Gulf War #1 by Marine Private Anthony Swafford and I enjoyed it.  But yet I just couldn't quite imagine it as a film.  That's because there is very little action; it's all about what's going on in the young marine's mind.  But that was the nature of that war.  There was a lot of training, a lot of waiting, lots of boredom, and lots of reporters with microphones and videotape trying to find a story where there was none.  Maybe that's why one of the things I mostly remember from that war was the soldiers playing football in the sun while wearing  full chemical retardant gear.  And this was on a desert where the average temperature was about 112 degrees Fahrenheit.<br /><br />The film got poor reviews but I was still curious.  And that's why I made sure to see it.  I'm glad I did because I found it refreshing, a war movie was about one particular soldier with a voice-over narration of well chosen words.  Jake Gyllenhaal, of Brokeback Mountain fame, is the star.  His wears a  \\"jarhead\\" crew cut and a pensive expression most of the time.  We share his anticipation, his disappointments, and his realization that all his expectations have been wrong.  He and his fellow marines have been trained and trained and then over-trained by their sergeant, played by Jamie Foxx.  There is some great surreal cinematography of the unending desert and the landscape of the oil wells aflame while the soldiers do little but come across charred bodies.  There's no heroism and when Gyllenhaal and fellow marine, Peter Sarsgaard finally think they are going to use their sharpshooter skills, their hopes are shattered by a commanding officer who refuses to let them take that shot.<br /><br />There are different kinds of wars.  And Jarhead captures the experience of Gulf War #1 magnificently.
B000HT386M|3.0|Click is an enjoyable movie that tells the story of a man who gets his hands an a universal remote where he can take a look in his past, skip situations, alter things, and do a whole lot more in one click. Everything goes as planned until some things go terribly wrong... <br /> <br />Adam Sandler and Kate Beckinsale play the main characters in the film and both act good. Sandler knows how to act comedy and does it well. Beckinsale is sweet and beautiful and does a nice acting job also.  <br />Christopher Walken and David Hasselholf are the surporting roles in the film. Walken feels a bit hold back and his character asks for more depth and a bit more acting, but still his performance is good enough that you don't mind it.  <br />Hasselhof plays a hilarious part and is really funny as the boss of Sandler's character. <br /> <br />The film has some nice jokes here and there and explores the world of the Click device well enough, although some jokes do feel a bit over the top and weren't that necessary to put in the film. But the film is funny enough to make you laugh at some moments.  <br /> <br />Now the biggest problem with Click is that it is said to be a comedy, which it is for about the first hour, but then it makes a big switch and suddenly becomes a heavy drama film. The dramatic element is nice but still way too much for the ones who are expecting a comedy. There are some small jokes here and there in the dramatic part, but it doesn't feel like a comedy anymore. And if there is a comedy moment in that second part of the film it feels totally out of place, like the most dramatic scene of the entire film is broken into a thousand pieces because of a stupid joke that really feels unnecessary. Also, for the younger members of the family the dramatic part can be a bit too much and too serious.    <br />Click may not be sutible for the smallest members of the family because of the drama and of some pretty sexual jokes and sexy moments in the film. So mind the PG-13 rating. If you are a bit older you may enjoy those jokes a lot more.   <br /> <br />So all in all: Click has become a nice comedy with an extreme cool idea that is well worked out but with a bit too much drama considering it's a comedy. But still: a very enjoyable movie with a very important message that is presented clearly and stays with you.  <br />
B000062V97|5.0|I've never seen the original Time Machine versions before, but I absolutely loved this movie. I am of course a big fan of special effects, but the story is fascinating! I've watched the movie several times, and every single time I'm blown away. The story line is inspirational and imaginative and knows no bounds. You'll continue to wonder where the story will end up. If you love science fiction and have a fascination for time travel, then add this movie to your collection!
B000GRUS22|4.0|This is a contender for one of the top 10 of the year. I didn't really ever like Enigma. I thought they were the kitchy,novelty version of \\"electronica\\". Squarepusher or The Klinik they are not. But my mom's co-worker gave this to me unopened and after mildly rolling my eyes I slapped it on.<br /><br />I was quite taken back. This is a roller coaster ride of seriously high end slick production. Not oil slick. But chrome slick like sucking on a silver spoon of electro tunes. This is big budget electronica and it shows. Some elements of trance and ambient. Super super cool vocoded whale samples to send the \\"Iceland sound\\" cowering in embarrassed fear. Enigma is back and with some real crediblity here. This might be The Thing in electronic music this year. The vocals by the producer here are pointless to me but pretty easy to ignore. They actually fit very nicely in the mix but don't do much for me at all. But...this 3D, underwater, galactic adventure through studio time is an upset for one of the best records of the year.

Inspires trying to solve work process problems that are hard because the current reality has contradictions in it. Setting is far from most workplaces, but then so are spy novels.

B000HIVO64|3.0|I've been struggling with THE INFORMATION, the new Beck album for a couple weeks now.  Beck releases are always fun, because you never know which direction the former Loser is going to be coming at you from.  From his early lo-fi blues fusion of MELLOW GOLD through to his somber orchestrations of the sublimely sad SEA CHANGE, Beck always keeps you guessing.<br /><br />His last album, GUERO, was a retrenching, where he revisited past styles and producers (The Dust Brothers of ODELAY fame).  While it was not one of his most forward looking albums, it was still loaded with strong performances that stayed with you after the disk had completed and was put back on the shelf.  THE INFORMATION on the other hand, is enjoyable when you are playing it, but disappears from memory once you're done.<br /><br />The material is pretty good, but so far none of these songs have stuck into my subconscious like past material.  The wordplay is interesting, as usual (Beck is a master of cut and paste phrases, in my book), but the playing is bland and simplistic, and the production from Beck and uber producer Nigel Goodrich seems antiseptic.  It sounds like a CD that was created on a laptop, rather than in a studio by actual musicians.  Most songs ride the same groove all the way through with just some sparse instrumentation grafted on to change the scenery.<br /><br />While songs like I THINK I'M IN LOVE, NAUSEA, 1000BPM and STRANGE APPERITION are decent; they don't really rank up with the best of Beck's past work.  The best thing about the whole package, are the stickers that allow you to create your own CD jacket.  The 10 minutes it took me to put together the artwork was the best time that I've spent with the album thus far.  I have not spent anytime with the attached videos, though I doubt they will tip the balance in any way at this point.<br /><br />On the other hand I do remember getting MUTATIONS and being under whelmed to the point of trading it in, but then listening to it one evening, and suddenly \\"getting it\\".  It now ranks as one of my favorite.  Maybe I'll pull this out some sunny afternoon, and get struck by the lightening of inspiration.  Till then....... ***1/2 Stars.o it one evening, and suddenly \\"getting it\\".  It now ranks as one of my favorite.  Maybe I'll pull this out some sunny afternoon, and get struck by the lightening of inspiration.  Till then....... ***1/2 Stars. <br />
B000001EL7|5.0|Kiss have an album with 3 good songs and the rest filler?No way !your kidding ? Alive and Alive II  albums were so cool because you could hear all the explosions of the pyrotechniques,The live albums should have come with a pack of firecrackers .It probably did well for the retail sales of firecrackers .i wonder if there ever were kiss firecrackers . if not i bet they tried.
B00005JNS0|4.0|Over the past 5 or 6 years, I've noticed a downward trend on the quality of animated films.  All use the same tired plot devices, animation looks the same, and the worst trend seems to be the focus on using Hollywood stars to do the voices.  Needless to say, I didn't rush out to see 'Cars' in the theater.  I only watched under duress on a long flight to Tokyo.  I have to say I was pleasantly surprised...after a few minutes, I was hooked.  The plot in parts reminded me of a bad 80s movie starring Michael J. Fox, but it seemed to work  when acted out by talking cars.  I also have to say that I'm not the biggest fan of Larry the Cable Guy...Git R Done may have been funny the first time he said it....but, his tow truck character Mater was one of the more likeable and entertaining cars in the movie.<br /><br />Overall, a good animated film...probably the best I've seen since the first Shrek.
0884271536|3.0|A \\"made-for-TV\\" novel with a lesson about a new method of project scheduling. Goldratt invented the \\"Theory of Constraints,\\" a general problem analyis and planning method which he then applies to various areas. Each application presented in story format.<br /><br />\\"Critical Chain\\" = \\"Critical Path\\" x \\"Theory of Constraints\\".<br /><br />Read this book if you want an easy read and a fun introduction to the subject. But if you actually want to apply the Critical Chain method, you'll probably need a textbook format. Or make the effort to abstract the method from the dialogue of the story.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This is really one of the greatest romance movies I have ever seen.  Although \\"Mr. Thornton\\" seemed stiff to me initially, by the end of the movie, I was really rooting for him and \\"Ms. Hale\\" to get together.   <br /> <br />This movie explores historical class distinctions and touches on topics such as industrialization, unions and utter poverty, while realistically portraying two very different people overcoming their own prejudices to see the worth of their opposites. <br /> <br />Well acted by all, with a solid story line, this movie will certainly make it to my top 10 and be watched over and over again.   <br /> <br />
B00067BBQE|3.0|This DVD is very good for the accompanying interviews and behind the scenes that come along with the concert. But that is it... I listen to the CD for the concert and watch the DVD for the extras, as I agree with most that it is poorly filmed. It is hard to watch to be honest, but there is nothing wrong with the actual music. I hesitated to buy this for a long time, as I was unsure if they could put together a decent concert with such limited material. I'm glad I bought it on sale as I don't think that it is worth paying full price for.
B00006L83N|5.0|This may be my favorite album right now and is worth a listen for anyone who enjoys Power Metal or Prog Metal.  Actually, for those who like that genre, most I have run across loved this album almost as much as I. <br /> <br />Inferno (Unleash The Fire) (6/10) - Blistering start to the album.  A lot of people just love this song and the rifs.  Russell Allen's voice is pure metal at times here. <br /> <br />Wicked (7/10) - Nice harmonies to go with good music. <br /> <br />Incantations of the Apprentice (8/10) - Nice buildup at the start and then the interplay between guitar and synth really explode.  The bass and drums in this song combine powerfully during the verses. <br /> <br />Accolade II (10/10) - While Accolade was a good song on Divine Wings of Tragedy, this song is just awesome.  It is extremely powerful, has fantastic lyrics (pun intended), and I never regret hearing this song.  (\\"On the field with sword and shield, amidst the din of dying men's wails; war is waged and the battle will rage  <br /> <br />until only the righteous prevail\\") <br /> <br />King of Terrors (7/10) - I always loved the heavy distortion of this song, but it never really grabbed me.  Once I realized it was an ode to Poe's Pit & Pendulum, I enjoyed it even more. <br /> <br />The Turning (6/10) - Good, heavy power metal. <br /> <br />Awakenings (9/10) - Great piano/synth and the vocals are great.  The solos are inspired, but it falls just a tiny bit short.  The harmonies around the solos are just awesome: (\\"Here I am at the crossing of a life, I stand on my own looking down the road...\\") <br /> <br />The Odyssey (10/10) - This is the best \\"epic\\" piece ever for me.  It makes me want to go back and re-read Homer's works.  The vocals here show an unbelievable range and I think any American Idol rocker could do well if he could sing portions of this.  How can this song be so great and so inspiring throughout?  Can a band surpass their mastery here? (\\"Triumphant!  Champion of Ithaca!\\")
0201485672|4.0|Refactoring, says Fowler in his preface, is improving the structure of the code without changing the behavior at all. His book certainly offers an organized way to do that, with examples and then an entire second half of the book which is a reference of refactoring patterns. I can recommend reading the first half of the book (methods) and then keeping it around as a reference when needed.<br /><br />But as a constant daily method, I think it claims too much. \\"Improving the design of the code after it has been written,\\" is still difficult, even if you have a book of refactoring patterns. And Fowler rightly makes having a strong unit testing suite a requirement.<br /><br />So I can say: read the book so that if you find yourself doing refactoring, you won't have to reinvent the wheel. But don't get your hopes up that refactoring is a substitute for good design and clear coding, as measured and improved through review by trusted co-workers.
B00005YXZH|1.0|Other than Heavy Metal Drummer, this album is totally mediocre. This album is perhaps the most overated, overhyped alternative album of all time. I do not see what all the fuss was about. I guess that sums up Wilco for me in general. I could not name another song on this album because none of the other tracks are worth remembering. Download Heavy Metal Drummer off a paysite and skip this album at all costs.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I can describe this movie in two words: a journey. It is Al Gore's journey of heart, soul, spirit, and mind through a lifetime of stewardship and also growth. For as much as this movie is a clarion call to all of us to now take our own journey for our planet, ourselves, and our children, it is also Al Gore's reckoning with himself. He lays his soul bare to warn us of the consequences of our inaction now regarding this crisis, because it relays to the events in his own life in the past that brought him to this point as well. <br /> <br />The scenes showing his early years in Congress, his son's car accident, the 2000 election (yes, I cried here,) and the very poignant scenes of him with his sister Nancy who died of lung cancer revealed to me a man not doing this out of any selfish political intent, but of a man who is telling you, the viewer, that even he has had to experience loss and near loss in his life in order to realize what he lost and how much of a part he played in it. I think those scenes were shown in direct correlation to this climate crisis and his message that we must not make the same mistake now with our planet. <br /> <br />Will we look back years from now regretting that we continued the very behavior that is contributing to this crisis even knowing what it is doing to our planet? Or will we take the necessary steps to change our ways and heed the warnings before it is too late? That is the question of this movie and there is no alarmism whatsoever in the presentation of the solutions we have at our disposal. Mr. Gore relays the facts starkly, calmly, and at times humorously, and clearly lays out what we can do to mitigate this crisis. And the scientific consensus cannot be denied that we as a species are contributing to it and it is having a definite effect on our world. <br /> <br />His statistics on Co2, invasive species, species loss, ice cap melting, population growth, etc., intertwined with footage from around the world showing the effects ofthe statistics he showed was all very well presented and backed up. I also never got the impression that any of this is about him in any other sense than him using himself as an example of someone who had to reach the bottom in order to reach for the top. <br /> <br />I laughed, I cried, and I saw before me on the screen a man who has surely come full circle with who he is and what his mission is, and that is handing that mission and truth to us. He says he is not a hero, and frankly, I didn't see a hero in this movie and that is a good thing. Heroes have a tendency to be placed on pedestals and forgotten. I saw something much more. I saw a prophet, a missive, and a trailblazer who has full faith in our abilty to save our planet. And we must not let our planet down, and that also includes those in government and the corporate world whose indifference to this issue can no longer be tolerated. <br /> <br />This is a movie that will make you see the world in a whole new light. And you must see it. And you must make sure those you love see it, especially your children. My teenage son watched this movie with me, and after it I asked what he learned from it. He said it told him that it was time to wake up and do something. I say, amen to that. <br /> <br />So thank you Al Gore, Davis Guggenheim, Laurie David, Lawrence Bender, Jeff Skoll, Paramount Classics, and Participant Productions for giving us this journey to now guide us on the greatest challenge we will ever face. And we will face it, because we must. And whether you even like Al Gore or not is not the point, for this in no way is a partisan political movie. The point is that this world belongs to all of us, and unless we learn to see the slow boil we will surely reap the consequences. It truly is a moral issue. So do I recommend this movie? Yes, with every fiber of my being, and as the credits rolled, I noticed that there was not the usual rush to get out of the theatre. People continued to sit watching the credits and listening to Melissa Etheridge sing...then it went quiet. That was when I stood up and clapped exclaiming, 'Thank you, Al Gore!'... and the entire theatre then clapped with me, and it felt good, for I too had waited a long time to be able to show this man the depth of the gratitude I have for him. Now it is up to us to continue to spread his inspirational and crucial message where it left off in the theatre. May we have the strength and will to do so.  <br />
B00067BBQE|3.0|Amy Lee has on The Open Door may have improved over the beautiful voice she had on Fallen or Lacuna Coil's singer shows.  Her beautiful alabaster skin, piercing blue eyes, and raven hair may attract almost as many as her vocal talents. <br /> <br />I think The Open Door is a decent album.  However, while I give this album 3 stars, I do not think it compares favorably in bredth or depth to the quality of the music from the 4-5 stars of Fallen.  There are several great songs on Fallen and most of the rest are good are very good for me.  On the Open Door almost half of the songs are just OK and I found only a few to be good. <br /> <br />Amy Lee's voice is still great.  The lyrics can be profound and touching.  They can also be very insightful, especially given her personal trials over the past few years.  However, the music just does not inspire me as much as Fallen.  I have not figured out exactly why, yet, but it seems like I am missing Ben Moody's song-writing skills.  I wonder what these songs would sound like coupled with Amy Lee's voice and lyrics. <br /> <br />Sweet Sacrifice (9/10) - I didn't like the beginning.  However, the song definitely got better about 20 seconds into the song and started rocking around 50 seconds.  This may be my favorite song on the album. <br /> <br />Call Me When You're Sober (8/10) - Good music, good voice, good video (my favorite part is the light laughter and smile at the end).  Not great for me, however. <br /> <br />Weight of the World (7/10) - Good song with a different sounding voice from Amy Lee.  I especially loved the heavy guitar distortion around 1:26 (\\"She's nothing to me\\"). <br /> <br />Lithium (6/10) - Some haunting vocals and lyrics.  (\\"Come to bed.  Don't make me sleep alone\\")  I think teenage listeners and those coming out of troubled relationships will love this, although the music seems a little off to me.  Can anyone pluck a guitar rather than pick? <br /> <br />Cloud Nine (5/10) - I really don't like the start of this song, although it is very different.  Done just a tiny bit differently, this could easily score 8/10 or so for me.  Maybe it will get better with additional listening. <br /> <br />Snow White (3/10) may forever inspire visions of Amy Lee now.  This really can show insights into one or more of her recent relationships.  However, I really dislike the music. <br /> <br />Lacrymosa (6/10) - I liked the choral arrangements, but half of the song my thoughts to the music were... eh. <br /> <br />Like You (6/10) - Just OK at first, but it got better for me. <br /> <br />Lose Control (5/10) - Is it just me or all of these songs starting off weak?  Nice, haunting harmonies later in the song. <br /> <br />The Only One (7/10) - This started off weak and was reminiscent of Fallen.  However, it eventually changed things up and worked for me. <br /> <br />Your Star (4/10) - At first I was wondering if the first 30 seconds of most songs could just be removed.  Unfortunately, I think I might just skip the first half of this song.  I do like how Amy Lee shows her lower range at times here. <br /> <br />All That I'm Living For (6/10) - This song started off strong with an opening chorus, but after the first 20 seconds it just deteriorated for me.   <br /> <br />Good Enough (5/10) - Slow song, but it seemed like a nice orchestral arrangement.  Amy's airy vocals should go well with this, but I just didn't connect with the longest song on the album.
0385335989|4.0|This whole series is just delightful.  Very well written, well developed storyline, well developed characters.  Just absolutely great!  Huge books, but you'll blow through them fast.  Don't be discouraged by the size or the fact that there's a time travel aspect to it (I put off reading the series for 7 years because of these 2 things).  The first one is more of a romance, the second is more historical fiction, the third and fourth are more adventure, the fifth and sixth go back to being more historical fiction, and they all have just about every since genre woven throughout.  So it doesn't matter what genre you prefer to read, this series will fit into it!
B000GPIPVU|4.0|...is the first thing I said when I put on \\"Till The Sun Turns Black\\" for the first time.  Ray Lamontagne has seemed to put away his Van Morrisson records which inspired him for his debut album \\"Trouble\\" and picked up a copy of \\"Pink Moon\\" by the aforementioned Drake.  This new record seems to be an opposite reaction to \\"Trouble\\" and I think it works.  Yet, my problem with both of his LP's is that they aren't great records straight through.  I rarely listen to the last half of \\"Trouble\\", except for the wonderfully serene \\"All The Wild Horses\\", because all of the stand out tracks appear in the first 5 slots (a problem with the sequencing on many modern albums).  While \\"Till The Sun Turns Black\\" is a better sequenced album I still think it could have been stronger.  Yes the songs are dark, brooding, and delicate but we've heard much of this before from other artists.  I wish Lamontagne had branched out a bit more with this album.  I am all for beautifully restrained music but this is almost too low key without pushing the envelope enough.  It's not anywhere near the inspiration of a Nick Drake album because not only did Drake sound like this over thirty years ago, but he did it with more artistry and dynamics. <br /> <br />Lamontagne should have taken notes on progression from albums like \\"Sea Change\\" by Beck or drenched this one in more emotion as Damien Rice did on his masterful \\"O\\".  What I really wish is that Lamontagne had combined \\"Trouble\\" with this one.  Mix the best five tracks from each LP and make one album, that would have been an incredible venture.  I think Ray is still finding himself as a songwriter.  Hopefully we have not seen his definitive work as of yet.  Once he's done with all of the impersonations we'll see how he does.  \\"Till The Sun Turns Black\\" is a nice, well produced album, but it's nothing Lamontagnes heroes haven't done in the distant past. <br />
0385334206|5.0|This book is probably one of the best pieces of literature I have ever read.  The ability of the author to go back and forth between characters seemlessley is impeccable and can never be duplicated by another. <br />The idea behind Breakfast of Champions is a conflict between two main characters, Kilgore Trout & Dwayne Hoover, both with seemingly separate lives and completely different views on life, but once their paths are crossed, their lives change forever. <br />In the beginning, a description of the characters are offered with extensive background information all leading up to their lives at the present and how in some way, shape, or form, they both rely on eachother for sanity. The author then goes even further to describe how their present life predicaments are affecting their outlooks on life and their performence both sexually and mentally are changing with every breath they take. <br />Vonnegut goes back and forth between voices, a pious & omniscient figure to becoming either both or one of the main characters, al done seemlessly and impeccably. <br />Kilgore Trout writes stories that the author comes up with which are then transduced as being sources of porographic ideas and Dwayne Hoover is a man who is beoming more and more psychotic everyday, he is losing his grip on reality and with the coming of Kilgore Trout to an art convention that Dwayne is also attending, Trout's stories, specifically one about all people being pre-set robots, causes Dwayne to snap and go on a rampage harming those who are most closest to him as well as people who need to be harmed, but still have no right to be harmed by Dwayne. <br />If anything, this book is a masterpiece and a work of art and I would recommend this book to all whose mind is as twisted and confusing as the author's, as well as someone who can put up with consistent references to the male genitalia, as grotesque as it might become.
B000HT386M|2.0|This SHOULD have been a good movie.  This COULD have been a good movie.  The movie had everything that a good movie should have. <br /> <br />The acting is good, the story is good, the camerawork is good, the editing is good, and everthing is done just right for a movie that's fun for the whole family. <br /> <br />Then they threw bathroom humor into every other scene (for no apparent reason).  I hope you like to watch shadows have sex, because that's there too.  (Why?  I don't know.)  Oh, and barnyard porn.  With stuffed animals. <br /> <br />All I can say is I'm glad I watched this movie before letting my kids near it.  It's going back to Blockbuster in the morning.
0385335997|5.0|This whole series is just delightful.  Very well written, well developed storyline, well developed characters.  Just absolutely great!  Huge books, but you'll blow through them fast.  Don't be discouraged by the size or the fact that there's a time travel aspect to it (I put off reading the series for 7 years because of these 2 things).  The first one is more of a romance, the second is more historical fiction, the third and fourth are more adventure, the fifth and sixth go back to being more historical fiction, and they all have just about every since genre woven throughout.  So it doesn't matter what genre you prefer to read, this series will fit into it!
B00005JPB4|4.0|FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS opens with a haunting accapella version of the Sammy Kahn/Jule Styne song, \\"I'll Walk Alone.\\"  Indeed, the dark imagery resonates within the entire theme of the film, which invokes how the \\"good war\\" was rather surreal and dark rather than the nostalgic and flag-waving patriotic photographs that have been portrayed in numerous World War II news reels and pictures.  Clint Eastwood provides the revised version to history with much graphic detail, which is characterized in the words and perceptions that are conveyed by the voices of the past.<br /><br />FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS is a film about the three surviving flag raisers, Ira Hayes, Rene Gagnon, and John Bradley.  Director Clint Eastwood concentrates on the Bond Tour in which these three veterans had to undertake in order to raise funds to supply more weaponary for the US military to end World War II.  Eastwood stays true to the book by James Bradley, but also offers a complex structure to the film, which makes the viewer think.  For example, the introduction of each of the key individuals who helped raise the flag on Iwo Jima are clearly presented in the book, but in the film, they are fragmented memories and flashbacks by the remaining survivors; it is an intense recreation of loss, reconnection, and understanding to those who lost their lives.  Ira Hayes's story was one of the most heartbreaking and unfortunate circumstance to the war, and adds another commentary to the understanding of American history in terms of the sum and all its parts.<br /><br />The cinemtography and the special effects in the film attempt to authenticate the look of the era.  From the beach battle scenes that overlook Mount Suribachi to the initial fighting on Iwo Jima, Eastwood utilizes the same technique that Steven Speilberg used for \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" when depicting the ravages of war.  The overall \\"washed over\\" color of the film provides an emphasis to the past.  However, the digitalized images of the navy fleets in the ocean appear excessive as compared to the real images that are depicted in archival photos that are presented at the end of the film.<br /><br />Overall, FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS is a film worth watching.  It provides yet another perspective to World War II, and especially the War in the Pacific, which usually is overlooked.ppear excessive as compared to the real images that are depicted in archival photos that are presented at the end of the film.

B00005A0N5|5.0|I was never really a fan of metal, I always thought that it sounded like a howler monkey being recorded with a traffic accident in the background.  That said, I really like the sound of a well played electric guitar.  Nightwish perfectly combines that electric sound with Tarja's absolutely incredible voice.  You really have the sense that you are in the presence of an annointed singer, sent to perform for only you.  This album isn't Nightwish's best, but it is worth every penny you pay for it. <br />Long Live Nightwish!
B00005JOYM|4.0|Oliver Stone's 'World Trade Center' is not what you'd expect from Oliver Stone. It's as if he has taken a break from politics to look at real people. The portraits of all the characters are sympathetic, although according to a recent \\"Slate\\" review, the marine character feels he is painted unfairly as a kind of holy robot.<br /><br />Stone mercifully avoids any characterisation of the hijackers and focus is on the collapse, the survival and the rescue. Although wrenching in many scenes, there is actually very little gore presented on screen. Apart from some news footage of global reaction to the attack, the movie is also mercifully absent is 'gratuitous political correctness', there are no muslim victims or rescuers thrown in to send a message.<br /><br />Most of the drama is split between the two trapped Port Authority police enmeshed in black, jagged rubble and their homes and families. The courage of ordinary people. In short the movie has No gore, no p.c.....just tragedy, courage and hope, that's enough.
0380018179|5.0|I first read this book about 10 years ago.  At the time it quickly bounced to my favorite book.  Since then I have read it probably a half dozen more times and it is STILL one of my all time favorite books.  It is just a great story and I cry every single time I read it.  It's wonderfully written. <br /> <br />Poor Meggie has such a difficult life, and yet she becomes a very strong woman and eventually finds peace in just being.   <br />Poor Ralph has to choose between God and everything he holds dear in the world.   <br />Poor Fee wasted her whole life being bitter and when she finally realized this, it was too late.   <br />Poor Justine has to live her life in the shadow of her little brother trying to find acceptance anyway she can, and finally learns it begins with herself.   <br />Poor Dane knows he is absolutely everything to his mother and yet the thing he wants the most is the thing that will hurt her the most. <br /> <br />There are just so many good life lessons, and though it is such a sad story, it leaves you with a feeling of peace.
0800177177|1.0|It's mind boggling to think that Coppola could listen to the so-called English accents of the studmuffin and the shoplifter, and not immediately drive stakes through their hearts. Casting-by-the-deaf? Just awful. <br /> <br />Anthony Hopkins provides a few moments of welcome respite from this drivel with his usual inspired performance, but I'd rather drink blood than watch any of the rest of it again;. Save your money.
B000059XUP|5.0|The terrible mistake most viewers make when watching a Crow movie or a reading another Crow Novel or Comic is that they compare the \\"Crow\\" in question to the previous Crow or Crows. You have to understand that this character isn't \\"Eric\\" (Crow from the first film), This isn't Motor City Detroit, This is The City Of Angels and the main characters name is Ashe this is his life, his perspective. Its not supposed to be like the first Crow they are two different people and two different stories, thats all they are just stories, they are not sequels or prequels just installments. If you could see everyones life before your eyes would they look the same? No they wouldn't. Why? Because were all different. All the folks who gave this movie bad reviews did so because they are standing to close to a big picture, step back and see the big picture. The world and the ways of the Crow aren't so narrow that they would stay limited to the confines and brooding post-gothic nature of the first film.<br /><br />Most of the people giving reviews probably don't even know that James O' Barr wrote the first Crow after losing the love of his life to a drunk driver, so all that pain, frustration, and hatred went into those pages and script. You can't create pain like that you have to know it. This is why the first Crow has an unfair advantage against all the new Crow movies, you can't turn water into wine, these directors had to work it in the best way they could.<br /><br />By giving such harsh critique to these movies you may alter someones judgement and cause them to miss out on a really good film. Crow:City Of Angels was a good movie and a good Crow story. I myself loved the first film the most, I even remember the trailers that played \\"Big Empty\\" By Stone Temple Pilots which I still listen to today. But please don't drag this second installments name through the mud.<br /><br />-Jon
0375703861|5.0|At first, I thought that Smith was mining the same ground as Andrea Levy's magnificent [[ASIN:0312424671 SMALL ISLAND]]: examining the lives of immigrants in postwar London and tracing the routes that had brought them there. But while Smith does not quite have Levy's intensity, she spreads her net wider, dealing with several different cultures (Bengali, Jamaican, Jewish intellectual, and British working-class) over a span of three generations, only the first of which coincides with Levy's. Eventually it becomes clear that her main focus is on the youngest generation (presumably her own), and she chronicles the troubled nineties with sharp observation, vivid and often colloquially profane language, and considerable humor. I felt that the narrative lost coherence and the plotting became less plausible as the number of characters increased, though it may just be that I had less time to read. But Smith's central theme --- the difficulty of maintaining cultural identity in a strange land --- is extremely well addressed and chillingly relevant.
0804115613|5.0|I only ever saw this movie and I loved the movie, but I always wanted to read the book.  Fannie Flagg has written an american classic! This book is so inviting and so real. It makes you feel like you are really in Whistle Stop, Alabama or The Rose Terrace Nursing home. The author writes so clearly that you feel like you know the characters and you know the town. You find yourself rooting for the good guy and you find yourself feeling sorry for Evelyn when she gets lonely.   <br />This is a wonderful tale for men and women of all ages to read because of the lessons it holds. I most definitely reccomend it to anyone. It was a book I couldn't put down. I fell in love with it.
0440180295|4.0|kurt vonnegut's book slaughterhouse five is a great piece of literary work in itself. his unique style of black humor, combined with his vivid imagination is second to none. this book was exciting and unpredictable as i continued to read! its main purpose involved the struggle of a man with his grip on reality. is he, or is he not crazy? <br /> <br />the imagery in this book was another great element, and many regard this as one of the greatest anti-war books of the century. this book is definitely worth reading and will not disappoint! you can't go wrong with kurt vonnegut's slaughterhouse five!
B000003TAL|5.0|After almost 20 years of critical acclaim, loathing, and debate there's really not much else that can be said about this album.  This is one of those albums where you either love it or hate it.  There's not a whole lot middle ground to stand on. Personally, I highly recommend this album.  Of all of the music in my collection, this is easily one of my top three favorite albums. <br /> <br />Musically, this is Sonic Youth at their absolute peak.  The level of musical growth for the band between 1987's \\"Sister\\" and this album is stunning.  A perfect marriage of the chaos and rampant no-wave experimentalism of their earlier albums with the blossoming pop sensibilities they were beginning to showcase.  They had only flirted with beauty prior to this album...here, they embraced it.  Not as uncompromising as their earlier output, but still hard on the ears if you're not ready for it.  The songs mutate from skittish squeals to beautiful guitar interplay and back again.  As previous reviews have stated, there is literally never a dull moment on this album. Raw power combined with limitless musical ambition.  I'm surprised that even an independant label would release this back in 1988. <br /> <br />Lyrically, this is also a high for the band.  Sonic Youth were never especially gifted lyricists, but there's enough lyrical variety here to keep the songs interesting, if somewhat cryptic.  They're really open to interpretation, I suppose.  The real draw here is the music, though. <br /> <br />Personally, I see this as the point where Sonic Youth began their decline...they would only get one more great album out after this one before things turned 'questionable'. Of course, with an album this good on their resume, any band's future output would pale in comparison. <br /> <br />
0143038095|5.0|The book opens with the story of a Chinese woman who bought a swan because she believed it was born a duck then stretched its neck to become more. The woman wished to do the same. To sail to America and make a better life for her and her children than she could have ever hoped for in China. When she arrived in America, however, they took her swan away amd she was left with nothing but a feather, and a few broken dreams.  <br />    Amy Tan's \\"The Joy Luck Club is the story of four women and their daughters. In a series of fladhbacks we see how each woman came to America, fleeing their Chinease past of opression and fear to build a better life for their children.

B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|To start off. I have to say this. I am not, nor have ever been a My Chemical Romance fan. This sounds odd to say given the fact that i am giving they're new album five stars. This is because this album is not the old My Chemical Romance, when people look back on this band, this is the album they will talk of. To put simply, The Black Parade, will redefine how you presieve this band. <br /> <br />I'll admit i felt weird even purchasing the album, but upon hearing \\"Welcome to the Black Parade\\" which maybe the best song of the year (and album highlight) for sheer over-the-top magic, it deserved a chance.  <br /> <br />The Black Parade is a concept album, a smart, compact story about death, life and everything in between. Through the course of the album we get the story of the young dead man's life, in moments as it were flashing before our eyes. \\"Dead!\\" and \\"House of Wolves\\" the latter which sounds like Aerosmith even at times in a weird way would both be great singles, as would the prepacked teen anthem \\"Teenagers\\" which sounds nothing like the earlier incarnation of the band. For sheer audacity the track \\"Mama\\" which features the man in war, covered with blood pleading to his Mom is downright startling.  <br /> <br />Simply put, the people who everyone thought would end up as another Simple Plan have delivered a smart concept album for the ages that should propel them further into the mainstream. They seemlessly blend bands like hte smashing pumpkins and Queen (with their guitar solos) into tight songs. But, their ideas here are bigger than emo, screamo, punk, whatever you want to call it...dont let the appearance of hte band and fans scare you away, this is one hell of an album, pun completely intended. <br /> <br />DOWNLOAD:  <br />\\"Welcome to the Black Parade\\" \\"Dead!\\"  <br />\\"House of Wolves\\" \\"Teenagers\\" \\"I Don't Love You\\"
B000I2J5UG|5.0|I've been listening to My Chemical Romance since the beginning, their music has always been my favorite. Truthfully, I was very worried about this album. From what had leaked I could tell the stuff on here was a ton different from their old stuff. <br /> <br />Last night after seeing them in Jersey we got to get our cds early and I listened to it all the way home. It was a lot different, but not in a bad way. I love it and I can't stop listening to it. I think that they will get a bunch more fans that normally would have been anti-my chem because of past albums, but The Black Parade has something for everone. I let some of my friends that don't like My Chemical Romance listen to the new cd and they actually liked it. <br /> <br />The futures looking good for Frank, Gerard, Mikey, Bob and Ray. Very good.
B00005JPAD|4.0|'The Departed' is a great movie. 'Infernal Affairs' is a masterpiece. Having seen 'Infernal Affairs' many times I was surprised just how close the plot of 'The Departed' followed the original. It took alot away from 'The Departed' because I knew basically everything that was going to happen. It is such a great story that it holds up in both films. If you loved 'The Departed' and you haven't seen 'Infernal Affairs' you should go out now and purchase it.
0743289412|4.0|Do the dead love?  In Stephen King's world the answer is yes.<br /><br />Lisey Landon has survived two years without her husband, Scott.  A popular author, Scott has left his wife with the job or sorting through his mountainous collection of papers, manuscripts, and other materials.  Always a critically successful author, Scott's papers are in high demand and it is this that drives Lisey to the edge of her own sanity and may threaten her own physical safety.<br /><br />Lisey's Story is, besides a gripping story, an examination of how we cope with loss.  King's mastery of the darkside of humanity takes a backseat in this tale, though he gives us doses of classic King from time to time.  The word \\"haunting\\" has been used by other reviewers and I can't think of a synonym that would be better.  As I read the story I was touched by the depth of emotion spilling off the page.  That Stephen King can scare us and make us feel such emotion is a true gift.<br /><br />King has the ability to create memorable characters that are easy to identify with.  That is present in Lisey's Story as well.<br /><br />If you've loved Stephen King in the past I don't believe you'll be disappointed with Lisey's Story.
B0001AP12G|1.0|I give credit to people like Kanye, Fred Durst, and Britney Spears.  People who do drugs need drug dealers.  People who need work need employers.  And people who listen to over-hyped music with no talent (which appears to be the majority(904 reviews and counting; not even 2pac got this much) need artists like the aboved mentioned.  Are these artists geniuses?  Some would say yes and others would say no.  But they hit a string within American audiences and made lots of money.  So I say good shot.   <br /> <br />If you are into hypes, trends, and simple music then give your two cents.  But if you made it far enough into your overall music experience this may not be nearly talented and entertaining enough for you.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I had vaguely heard of this show when it was actually running,but never watched it.  Then the movie came out and the critics really raved over it, so I thought I'd check it out.  It was excellent.  So I rented the DVD's with the actual episodes.  Man, what great stories, interesting characters, funny, action, even alittle emotional at times, sexy, special effects, this show had it all. The only way I can explain it is, its like having an old friend come to stay with you.  I've never reacted to a TV show like that before.  Wierd, in a way.  But great.  I have one more DVD to watch, and when the last episode has run, I will genuinely miss it. <br />I'm am grateful for the few episodes that were made, and can only wish that some kind of groundswell movement to make more will kick in (Re: The original Star Trek after it was cancelled). <br />Thank you Firefly.  Thank you Serenity. <br />
0316776963|5.0|...always pick David Sedaris. His writing never let's you down.  He is always engaging and hilariously funny...but he never stoops to trying to hard by being gross.  His situations and characters are outlandish...but there's always a grain of truth and realism.  Which makes the humor all the more satisfying.  It's vivid, alive, funny and even touching at times.  And they are the kind of stories that you can read every few years...seeing the characters again is like visiting old friends.
B00006AW2G|4.0|The Stones heavily-praised first album of the Mick Taylor era (and last of the Brian Jones one) is a great collection of Stones rock. Most of the reviews have spewn heavily upon it, so I'll save mine for the simple truth of beauty that is Monkey Man, Midnight Rambler, Live With Me, and the arguably top five all time Stones number of Gimme Shelter. There is no Stones song I know of that can so make me stop what I'm doing and just LISTEN to that intro and pause in awe. REALLY great stuff. Yeah, Midnight Rambler live on Ya-Yas is pretty intense, but the version here is a bit scarier, so what the hell. The cover of Love In Vain is really great despite the fact that it sounds little like the original, but hey, isn't that what makes a great cover version anyway? It is such a great Stones workout every time you hear it live it just demands to be an integral part of their country blues legacy. The different take on Honky Tonk Women, however fun, isn't as great as the first version. YCAGWYW is pure Stones canon material and Keith's turn on You Got The Silver as well as Mick's lecherous title track are really solid. So I wonder, how is it that Keef manages to make so many of his songs (You Got The Silver, Coming Down Again, All About You, Slipping Away) sound like the way you feel after a dozen or so glasses of scotch? The man is a marvel of human ingenuity, innit he?<br />Anywho, this is great Stones stuff. It isn't all the way to five stars for me, but it is a high point of the Stones storied career. The extra stars were soon to come...
B000I2J5UG|5.0|I am a huge fan of My Chemical Romance since the first album and I own every album since. I think M.M Lingo did an great job of detailing this album. I purchased the limited Edition and the regular CD of Black Parade and I am so glad I did. This album is stunning and shows such growth from Three Cheers. There is no track you will want to skip.  It may be a concept album but it has some serious rocking songs. Buy this album and crank it up and be whisked away to enjoy the Black Parade. This will be in heavy rotation in my Ipod for quite a while. Amazing.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|In The Open Door, Amy Lee has expanded down several new roads.  I do mean Amy Lee, not Evanescence as a group; she dominates the album with her incredible voice. <br />The Open Door is a little more New Agey and less pop-ish than Fallen was.  The songs experiment with different sounds and vocal styles.  In virtually every case the experiment is successful.  My take on the songs is as follows: <br />Sweet Sacrifice: my absolute favorite Evanescence song ever.  The harsh, edgy guitar combines spectacularly with Amy Lee's fast-paced, incredibly complex vocals. <br />Call Me When You're Sober: the only song I skip over.  I found it rather predictable and without the edgy, goth tone that I enjoy in the others. <br />Weight of the World: catchy and fun.  There's some insanely high vocalizing in this that I, a first soprano, can barely do.  It's impressive! <br />Lithium: a rich, throaty, wrenching song that's my favorite song to sing on the whole album. <br />Cloud Nine: gets stuck in your head.  Fun and eerie; a little slow in the end, but still good. <br />Snow White Queen: decent.  It's one of the less distinctive tracks on the album, but still good and with a little computerized distortion to make it interesting. <br />Lachrymosa: magnificent.  A song that demands your whole attention. <br />Like You: simple and absolutely beautiful.  A little creepy, a little sad and extremely good. <br />Lose Control: great guitar on the chorus; well worth listening to. <br />The Only One: decent.  It doesn't particularly stand out to me, but it's up to scratch. <br />Your Star: very unusual.  The notes are put together originally for a unique and hypnotic sound. <br />All That I'm Living For: classic Fallen.  Good guitar on the chorus, soaring vocals. <br />Good Enough: a sweet and simple song that shows off the softer side of Amy's voice. <br />In short, this album is absolutely worth buying and listening to over and over.  If Call Me When You're Sober turned you off, don't worry.This album is much more complex and soaring than Fallen (which was also really good), with a little less angst (the angst wasn't bad, I'm just saying . .).  So I definately recommend it.
1577314808|5.0|This book has contributed to my understanding of living in the present moment more than anything else I've read. In fact I've read it several times and plan on reading it again. Highly recommended to anyone seeking higher consciousness.
B000EHRVP6|1.0|This movie is about Drugs,hooking up with girls,and drinking,and something else I rather not say.If I was you I do not recomend you to buy this movie.Jay Hernandez is a very good actor but this movie was not for him at all.This movie does not make any sense what so ever.He goes to the country to hook up with girls,take drugs and drink and then gets caught in a thing he was not supose to.A torture chamber but that part is at the end for about 30 min of the movie and thats all.So to me this movie really sucks,I do not get it at all.But if you buy it its a waste of money.If you buy it that you this is just what I thing about Hostel..... <br />

B00000K31V|1.0|Wow again....... Now I am really surprised that so many people have given this movie (?) such a high rating, I will just respect other people's taste. If you ask me, I should say the plot is shalow, performances even shalower photography non existing, screenplay a joke is there anything else???. I read the New York Times gave this movie a very high review.... I think it is a very daring thing to do.
B000I5YCCO|4.0|You can tell that Taylor Swift cares about the integrity of the music, and not just making money with the Nashville machine. Her voice has a wistfulness that reminds me of Deana Carter (though not with as much range on the higher notes yet,) and the arrangements avoid overproduction. Lyrically, \\"Tim McGraw\\" isn't even one of the better songs. This is a thoroughly charming debut - with youthful fun combined with a sophistication not expected.
1569242739|5.0|Isa is ruining my number one excuse for declining dessert, and most vegans know exactly what I'm talking about. Picture this scenario that all vegans have experienced countless times: you're at the office potluck/halloween party/family gathering. Post-meal, the desserts come flying to the table. As everyone lifts their forks grabbing their favorite decadent dessert, they stare at you. The strange vegan. Those who don't know you approach, and with a warm smile, offer you a slice of NY cheesecake. You decline politely, saying, \\"sorry, it has dairy so I don't eat cheesecake.\\" Well, based on Isa's doing, I can no longer sit out from the dessert scene. I don't know if I should salute her or throw my bathroom scale at her since I no longer want to use it after baking from her new book.  <br /> <br />Similar to the reasons I raved about her cookbook, Isa's charming book of cupcake recipes is stellar. First of all, I challenge all omnivores out there to think of 75 possible cupcake combinations. Now take away the milk. And eggs. Oh, and one can't use any butter, so nix that too. Ah... that's better. Now one is introduced to the vegan-style baking that Isa makes so effortless for the rest of us who are ingredient-challenged.  <br /> <br />Before I learned how to bake vegan cupcakes from this book, I would trudge down to Sticky Fingers bakery in DC and cough up $4 for a product reminiscent of a 25-cent Hostess cupcake. While at the bakery I would hand over my money, gritting my teeth and reminding myself how lucky I am to live in a vegan-accepting city. Then, I would take a bite back to the 4th grade, pre-Vegan era.  <br /> <br />Not only does this book make baking a lot more economical and bring back those childhood memories, but these things are really frickin good. In the mood for fruity cupcakes? No problem. Craving rich chocolate buttercream? Simple. And delicious. And awesome. For all you closet vegans living in the heart of the south (and I'm sure you're out there), bake some of these cupcakes for the most die-hard fans of banana fosters and it will truly rock their world. I baked a variety of the cupcakes for a dinner party and when people saw them they asked when I stopped being vegan.  <br /> <br />What I'm trying to say: baking these delicious cupcakes are easy and the end result is phenominal. Not only is this cookbook revolutionary in that I can't think of another dedicated to the undiscovered art of cupcakes, but it's also one step closer to saving vegans from being known as the strange eater at the dinner table. Thank you, Isa Moskowitz, even if my growing thighs do not. How about for your next cookbook you introduce a low-fat vegan cookbook for those getting out of their cupcake-induced sugar comas?
B000000WCV|5.0|I've always loved listening to Daft Punk songs.  While Discovery IMO is a better album, Homework is better for dancing and clubbin.  There are classics like Revolution 909, Da Funk, and Around the World, and then there are kickass songs like Phoenix and Burnin, enough to make you want to dance around.  If you are new to Daft Punk, get both Homework and Discovery.  You can't go wrong with either.

One More Time - 10/10 - The first song on the album is one of the greatest. <br />2. Aerodynamic - 10/10 - I like the use of the air guitar. <br />3. Digital Love - 8.5/10 - Decent <br />4. Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger - 9.5/10 - The song that led me to Daft Punk's Discovery. <br />5. Crescendolls - 6/10 - Cool.  <br />6. Night Vision - 5/10 - Just an interlude <br />7. Superheroes - 10/10 - I love playing this song out loud. <br />8. High Life - 7.9/10 - Another decent song, though not as good as the others. <br />9. Something About Us - 9.8/10 - It's slow, but it works for me. <br />10. Voyager - 10/10 - When I hear this song, I picture myself on a flight through space...kickass. <br />11. Veridis Quo - 6.3/10 - I'd say it's a little too long. <br />12. Short Circuit - 8.1/10 - Song gets annoying after a while though. <br />13. Face To Face - 9/10 - Good vocal song, but it's outclassed by the last track. <br />14. Too Long - 9.8/10 - The best way to end the album. <br /> <br />If you like Daft Punk, this CD is a must.
0743289412|4.0|Lisey Landon, widow of best-selling horror author Scott Landon, is finally getting around to cleaning out her late husband's possessions. While going through his writings and memorabilia, she is assailed with a flood of memories of her love for, and life with, her tortured genius husband. At the same time, Lisey's sister has a mental breakdown and a crazed madman threatens Lisey's life if she doesn't turn all of Scott's memorabilia over to him.<br /><br />King is back in top form as a horror writer. This story is about as horrific, creepy, and gruesome as they come. Scott had a nasty childhood and a special power he called upon when things got tough. However, mixed in with the horror is a reflection on the wellspring of creation that a writer draws upon and a story of a strong love that outlasts even death. The title notwithstanding, this is really Scott's story rather than Lisey's. It reminded me a bit of the book \\"Rebecca,\\" because it's Scott's strong presence that prevails throughout the book rather than Lisey's, and it's often Scott's words that issue from Lisey's lips.<br /><br />Although King has deftly woven together a story that balances both horror and love and includes some heart-pounding scenes, I had to knock a star off the rating because of King's continual use of invented words and pretentious phrases that were part of the Landon family language. For the first quarter of the book, I found the constant presence of such coined words as \\"blood-bool,\\" SOWISA,\\" \\"Boo'ya Moon,\\" and \\"long boy\\" so confusing that I wished I had a secret decoder ring to turn them into more intelligible phrases. And Lisey's constant quoting of family phrases such as \\"puffickly huh-yooge\\" and \\"keep your string a-drawing\\" became irritating after a while. In spite of this flaw, \\"Lisey's Story\\" is a riveting book that the author has obviously poured his heart and soul into. Stephen King fans won't want to miss this journey into the darkness and back!<br /><br />Eileen Rieback
B00005YJMX|5.0|Not an adaption of \\"Dracula\\" so much a quasi-remake of \\"Nosferatu,\\" the film rises out the long gliding shadow of the original thanks to the genius tag team of Kinski and Herzog, who are ambitious enough to actually re-interpret the material instead of simply re-creating it.  In one of his all time top five performances, Klaus Kinski injects an incredible amount of depth into the Dracula character.  He's of course menacing, but he's also sympathetic, pathetic, wise, weary, and at times even clownish.  He approaches the role with the gloomy boredom and longing of a creature that has endured too many centuries alone in his crumbling castle.   <br /> <br />In contrast to say the more charismatic Draculas we've seen over the past century, Nosferatu is quiet and meek in nature as he uses the minimal ghoul make up to not only provoke creepy unease but also vague sympathy. When he first meets Lucy, his slight shy mannerisms give the impression that he's shameful of his hideous appearance.   In contrast, there is the terrifying scene when Jonathan cuts his finger; resulting in the lurching Dracula transforming into a speedy, towering, blood thirsty predator(all thanks to Kinski's seemingly unnatural movements.)  As said, he also uses his appearance for tasteful comedy as well, especially during the playful scene where he's tip toeing around like a cartoon character as he plants his caskets around the town under the cover of darkness.   <br /> <br />This isn't just the Kinski show however as Herzorg's incredible eye does more than hold up his end of the deal.  The natural locations of  the ruined castle, the mountains, the beach....etc. are all effectively haunting and he makes certain to linger on them just long enough for the viewer to burn them into their memory.  The shots of dusk skyline are both beautifully grand and imposingly claustrophobic.   Despite this being a rare venture into horror, Herzorg certainly understands how to create overwhelming apocalyptic doom anddread with startling images of gathering rats, gradually deserting streets, and increasing mass funerals.   It's a very visual film with more moody atmospheric droning than dialogue and other more straightforward means of storytelling.  It's very dream like, though it's one very strange and creepy dream to be sure. As the protagonist Lucy, Isabelle Adjani's gothic beauty serves the film well but she's also excellent at portraying the innocence and strength of the tragic character.  Bruno Ganz's Jonathan plays the role mostly for camp which is perhaps one of the film's few missteps.

0060974176|5.0|_The Machine the Changed the World_ by Womack, Jones & Roos is nominally about how Japanese carmakers came up with new ways to meet some difficult challenges. But really, it is about lean manufacturing and why lean manufacturing should be successor to current mass-production methods.<br /><br />The authors did much of their research for the book while working at the International Motor Vehicle Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. That program was sponsored by a large number of car companies who wanted to understand why the Japanese way of manufacturing (especially as practiced by Toyota) had had such different results from older American & European car companies.<br /><br />Consequently, the book does focus entirely on the automotive industry. Originally, the first automobiles were custom-made (and often handmade) to the exact specifications of individual buyers, who were usually quite wealthy. Henry Ford wanted to get beyond that and create an automobile that did not need hand-fitting and hand-crafting of every single piece, and that could be built by people who had not already spent ten years in an apprenticeship for a very specific and specialized craft. In his efforts to get beyond the craftsman era, Ford developed a lot of the concepts and attitudes that still define mass-production today.<br /><br />For decades, manufacturers and especially car assemblers from all over the world would make a pilgrimage to Ford Motor Co. to better understand what wondrous thing this was that Ford had created. Among those was Eiji Toyoda, a member of the family that had founded Toyota Motor Company. While he found much of Ford's work interesting, he also saw a lot of wasted time & effort. Furthermore, Toyota was faced with some challenges that neither Ford (Ford Motor Co.) or Alfred Sloan (General Motors) had ever had to deal with, such as a work force that they almost could not fire, and a severe lack of investment funds.<br /><br />In dealing with those challenges and in trying to eliminate waste, Toyota Motor Company (and many other Japanese companies) developed what it today known as \\"lean\\" manufacturing.<br /><br />Unfortunately, most presentations of \\"lean\\" in the U.S. seem to focus on some of the surface features, such as smaller batch runs, a focus on a neat & orderly work space, and not carrying a lot of inventory.<br /><br />This is where _The Machine That Changed the World_ really shines, because it explores the thought processes behind the surface features, and explains how lean thinking affects every department of a company, not just manufacturing. The requirements & results of a lean mentality in purchasing, product design, and marketing are all examined as well.<br /><br />The book was published in 1991, and is therefore a bit dated in some respects. The authors look very favorably towards the Japanese banking & finance system, yet that same system has been having ongoing problems since the mid-1990s. The authors predicted a number of problems -- in marketing, market share, and labor relations -- for GM, Chrysler, and Ford, as well as many of the European auto makers. While I know some of those predictions have come to pass, I would dearly love to see a second edition of this book that goes into more detail about what has happened in the automotive industry during the last 15 years.<br /><br />Finally, I would have liked to have seen some discussion about implementing a company-wide lean structure in an American company. I have seen references in numerous books to Americans having atypical attitudes regarding individuality vs. other cultures that stress a conformance with society, and while I do believe the lean mentality could (and probably should) be implemented almost anywhere, I think there will be some specific aspects of American culture that will force a slightly different implementation than was done in Japan.ose challenges and in trying to eliminate waste, Toyota Motor Company (and many other Japanese companies) developed what it today known as \\"lean\\" manufacturing.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, most presentations of \\"lean\\" in the U.S. seem to focus on some of the surface features, such as smaller batch runs, a focus on a neat & orderly work space, and not carrying a lot of inventory. <br /> <br />This is where _The Machine That Changed the World_ really shines, because it explores the thought processes behind the surface features, and explains how lean thinking affects every department of a company, not just manufacturing.

B000002UJQ|3.0|For those musically adventurous types out there who have heard the hoopla about these talented guys and want to see if the rest of their stuff is kinda like the radio-friendly and infectious \\"Creep\\" then beware.  It's not.  I can see where they would appeal to certain folks, I'm just not one of them and that's okay.  Different strokes, ya know.  I'm one who likes a good strong drummer and powerful vocals on the songs I choose to listen to and I didn't find that here.  I will say one thing for them.  They are definitely unique and a change of pace.  Just be aware of what you are getting into with OK Computer.
B000AP04L0|5.0|Office Space was clearly a movie produced for individuals who have ever either worked in an office and those that never have.  Either way, you picked up a paycheck from some scummy employer that probably robbed you each paycheck and you didn't know how to get back at them.  This includes every working adult.<br />If you ever went to work and wanted to impose serious bodily injury on your boss or just wanted to tell them to shove it, this movie is for you.  If you ever drove away from your employer hoping that one day the building you worked in would burn down, this movie is for you.  If you ever wished death on that woman that every single day pissed you for some reason or other, but basically just no reason at all, this movie is for you.  If you ever wanted to just quit your crappy job, but kept on going and then got promoted because of it, this movie is surely for you.<br />Ron Livingston (who plays Peter) performance in this movie was OSCAR worthy.  It transcends the feeling of every working American from the time period that this movie was produced at, set in the 1980's until today (2006).  This movie transcended time and space and I believe will become as important to the fabric of America as the Sound of Music and the Star Wars movies one thru three.  Livingston's simply lays out what every single American office worker has every felt in the history of office work, F the establishment and do it with pride.<br />Having seen this movie numerous times I know where the jokes, but I have yet not to laugh with gusto and amazement how this film portrays the exact feeling of what it is too work in America, both in the 1980's and today.  Regardless of your age, 18 to 88 years old I believe that this movie will bond generations of American workers throughout the centuries for the rest of all our lives.  Mark my words and watch this movie.
B000GRTQSE|5.0|I love this CD! I have it in my car and listen to it all the time. It is very relaxing for some reason, ... very soothing to the nerves I would say.  The backup band is very tight and not overproduced. I have been a Bob Dylan fan since the Freewheelin album and I basicly haven't listened to much after Blood on the Tracks. However, this one is great! I especially like the second cut, \\"Spirit on the Water\\".  Zimmy never ceases to amaze.  I must say I am surprised he was able to put together such an enjoyable album.  I give this two thumbs way up!  Give it a try, I don't think you will regret it.

B000FA57N0|5.0|I never knew of the FireFly series until having seen Serenity on DVD.  I am not much of a TV fan but I do see movies often.  I did not see Serenity in the theaters because quite frankly, I did not recognize any of the actors and stayed away.   <br /> <br />I had seen the DVD out for a while and one day picked up a copy.  I am here to say that I feel bad about not having seen the movie in theaters.  Then when I seen how the box office did, I felt real bad.  I would have easily paid to see this movie a couple times at least.  If they ever make a sequel (man I hope they do) I will be there the day it opens <br /> <br />After seeing the movie I picked up the series and it was great.  This is TV that I would watch.  If they ever brought back the series I would tune in for sure.  Here's to hoping they make a sequel at least! <br />
B00005JPBP|4.0|I saw Hugh Jackman on Jay Leno talking about The Prestige and the shocking ending, and after seeing a trailer for it, I was determined to see this Magical Mystery Tour myself.  I liked virtually everything about the movie, even when I had no idea where it was going...however, just knowing in advance that the ending was supposed to be a giant surprise, I was paying extra attention.  Now I am not sure whether or not it was because of this that I caught on to a few things that later helped me to deduce the eventual outcome of the story, but even so that is exactly what happened.<br /><br />The story flowed differently from what you may normally expect from a fairly large budgeted film.  Showing us clips out of sequence may sound confusing, but never fear, the Director, Christopher Nolan held the reigns close to keep you seeing exactly what he wanted you to see, and when you would see it.  After a tragic accident that causes the death of his wife, Hugh Jackman (I find it easier to refer to them this way) teeters dangerously over the edge of sane reasoning in his quest to see to it that Christian Bale suffers serious consequences for his negligence in tying a knot that was supposed to be easily undone behind the curtain.  This goes from outright attempts at murder, to trying to out-do him on stage.<br /><br />It is easy to see that Hugh's character is the more polished of the two, and yet it isn't enough.  Christian knows how to perform incredibly clever illusions which seem to dazzle way more than anything Hugh can come up with.  Thus the quest to *discover* Christian's secret ferments until it becomes a full-fledged obsession.  Stealing the trick isn't beneath him, either.  But even though he is able to *copy* Christian's trick of the Transported Man on stage, Hugh still feels 2nd rate because deep down he still has no real clue as to HOW it is done...and this is driving him quite mad.<br /><br />Hugh's obsession forces him to virtually abandon almost everything in order to make Christian pay for his wife's death.  Since the tragic accident, Christian has moved on, married and even had a child, while Hugh continues to seeth at the loss he should not have had to bear.  Revenge is a tricky thing, however.  It leads Hugh to do some nasty things in order to force Christian to divulge his Transported Man secret.  This leads him to Nikola Tesla in the mountains of Colorado.  His experiments with electricity has made him legendary, but also viewed as a bit of an eccentric as well.  Hugh will stop virtually nothing in his attempts to have Tesla create for him a way to scientifically counter the Transported Man, all the while creating his own legacy that will hopefully live forever after his death.<br /><br />Several *secrets* to how the story ends are revealed as a result of Hugh visiting Colorado.  Don't worry, I won't spoil anything here, but for those of you who pride yourself in figuring out complicated plots, especially when telegraphed rather early on, well you may not find the last frame of the movie to be a surprise at all.  However, if by any chance you miss some of these *clues* and they ARE there, the final second of this movie has the potential to shock you as much as the ending to the 6th Sense may have.  I am by NO means a plot-deciphering genius by ANY stretch of the imagination, however I was still able to make my own mind up a good 40 minutes before the movie ended about what the eventual outcome was going to be, and while I didn't get everything 100% the general shock that you are left with did NOT surprise me.  I sincerely wish it had, because I would have enjoyed the movie that much more.<br /><br />I also feel compelled to let those who see this movie know that the plot borders on the Supernatural and even skirts the realm of science fiction a tad...maybe because of these two factors I was able to make my deduction so easily (because I enjoy sci-fi, maybe it was easier to accept the outcome...maybe not).  All I knowis that if you are NOT into the Supernatural or a shade of sci-fi, The Prestige just may not be for you.  I still enjoyed the acting, the pacing and it is always nice to see Michael Caine do what he does best -- even if his role reminded me of a dozen other characters he has played in the past.  Good luck, and hopefully the ending WILL surprise you more than it did me..  All I know is that if you are NOT into the Supernatural or a shade of sci-fi, The Prestige just may not be for you.

B000H0MKGK|5.0|I became a huge John Mayer fan (before I was sucked into Jack Johnson's music), and I while I adored his live acoustic material, I despised his CD's that he was coming out with.  I really can't believe how good Continuum is, each song he's really branching out away from his \\"hushed-whisper-john-mayer-persona\\".  I've always enjoyed JM's lyrics, but I must say that they are much more abstract on Continuum which I love.    I can actually call myslef a John Mayer fan now without having to explain that I'm only into his acoustic stuff.
0451209338|4.0|The Kill Artist is the first book in Daniel Silva's Gabriel Allon series and is a good start to a great series!<br /><br />The Kill Artist opens in Paris, where the Israeli ambassador to France is murdered by an Arab assassin.  The crime has all the hallmarks of an operation by Tariq al-Hourani.  Tariq's brother was part of the Black September Movement and was assassinated by the Israeli Secret Service (also called The Office).  Once aligned with Yasir Arafat, Tariq broke with Arafat and the PLO when they entered into peace negotiations with Israel.<br /><br />Ari Shamron, former head of The Office, seeks out the services of Garbriel Allon, an art restorer who has also served The Office as an assassin.  Although reluctant to become involved, Allon has a personal grudge to settle as Tariq is responsible for the car bombing that killed Allon's toddler son and maimed his wife (physically and mentally).  He agrees to again work for The Office, and his job is to find and murder Tariq.  He has the assistance of a beautiful French model and sometimes Israeli operative, Jacqueline Delacroix.  Allon uses Delacroix to infiltrate Tariq's inner circle so that he can discover his whereabouts.  What Allon is not gambling on is that at the same time, Tariq is trying to find and kill Allon.<br /><br />The Kill Artist is just a bit hokey in spots.  To think that a world famous model could be used as an operative is a stretch.  Allon also makes wrong assumptions that put him and others in danger.  But I'm willing to overlook these flaws because Silva's writing is so good.  Allon muses \\"As always, he was struck by the similarities between the craft of restoration and the craft of killing.  The methodology was precisely the same: study the target, become like him, do the job, slip away without a trace.\\"<br /><br />Since I've already read the other Allon books, I'm now looking forward to Silva's latest release which I understand will be out in February 2007.<br />
B000I2IT44|5.0|THE BAND: Steven Wilson (guitar, vocals), Richard Barbieri (keyboards, synthesizer), Colin Edwin (bass), Gavin Harrison (drums & percussion), and touring guitarist John Wesley.<br /><br />THE DVD: (2006) 2 discs. Disc-1 contains the 105 minute club-sized venue recorded live at Chicago's Park West on October 11-12, 2005... 15 complete songs. Disc-2 contains a photo gallery (9 minutes of picture after picture with background music - color, as well as black & white photos along the \\"Deadwing\\" tour... indoor/outdoor performances, festivals, behind the scenes, rehearsals, etc.); two bonus songs performed live (\\"Radioactive Toy\\" and \\"Futile\\" from 'Rockpalast' recorded in Budapest); Harrison's 4 minute cymbal song; \\"Lazarus\\" promo video; and three live projections from \\"Halo\\", \\"The Start Of Something Beautiful\\" and \\"Mother & Child Divided\\". The sound is crisp (and the 5.1 DTS is all that you can imagine). The DVD container itself is a 4-fold digipak. Sadly, no booklet containing any written words/lyrics/musicians or additional pictures comes with the DVD.<br /><br />COMMENTS: This DVD of The Tree in concert is a must have for fans. The band can do no wrong. I will continue to buy anything PT's mastermind Steven Wilson touches. THE GOOD: Filmed in color, moving to black & white at times, and going from sharply focused to grainy with specks (don't know what the artistic expression for this technique is called). Nine cameramen capture the action on stage while 3 projection screens blanket the curtain behind the band. The frame rate at which the camera shots change is fine - not too fast (as some music DVD's are). I haven't been to The Park West, but from the DVD it looks like it's an old high school auditorium. The show opens with \\"Open Car\\" followed by \\"Blackest Eyes\\" - two great rockers to really get the crowd into it. They then slow it down with perhaps their prettiest melody \\"Lazarus\\". Other highlights include \\"Hatesong\\" (with Edwin's cool bass intro, Harrison's intricate drumming, and a shredding guitar solo from Wilson); the 12 minute \\"Arriving Somewhere But Not Here\\" (featuring a great jam), and \\"Buying New Soul\\" (with Barbieri's atmospheric synth intro and Wilson's acoustic guitar... mellow bliss); their concert staple \\"Even Less\\", the unreleased instrumental \\"Mother And Child Divided\\" (in the same vein as Rush's \\"YYZ\\" with some neat tricks by Wilson on the guitar), the unreleased \\"So Called Friend\\" (a B-Side from the 'Deadwing' sessions), and the closer \\"Trains\\". Not that any songs are 'bad' here... but rather these songs mentioned simply stand out. Outside of an occasional \\"Thank you\\" or song introduction, very few words are spoken in between tracks... and the one comical thing that happens just before \\"Trains\\" is when Wilson asks the audience what song they want to hear. You hear one voice from the crowd yell \\"Freebird\\" and Wilson counters with \\"That's tomorrow night, the full blown 17 minute version.\\" THE NOT SO GOOD: I could say nothing here and just relish the whole DVD, but I'll be honest instead. The following two things are extremely minor - 1. As much as I love \\"Deadwing\\" and \\"In Absentia\\", I wish there were a few more songs from other albums (\\"Signify\\", \\"Metanoia\\", \\"Up The Downstair\\", \\"The Sky Moves Sideways\\" all had zero representation here... as well as only one track from one of my favorite Tree discs \\"Lightbulb Sun\\"). 2. The backing vocals by touring guitarist John Wesley were simply too loud at times. Several songs (\\"Buying New Soul\\", \\"Arriving Somewhere But Not Here\\", \\"Heart Attack In A Layby\\" and \\"The Sound Of Muzak\\" in particular) are ruined in spots by Wesley's falsetto. If his microphone was turned down a notch or he simply moved a foot back from the mic... I'm sure the problem would have been resolved. As it comes out on the DVD though, his high-pitched backing vocals overpower Wilson's singing in spots. Again - very minor... and neither (totally) ruin the experience here. Porcupine Tree is an awesome band- Wilson is a genius at his work... plays a great guitar, sings well, has a Kurt Cobain presence on stage (posture and hair) and performs utter magic in the studio. Harrison is an outstanding drummer with fast hands and even quicker feet - and I've coolly put him in the ranks with my other drummer favorites Neil Peart (Rush) and Mike Portnoy (Dream Theater). Barbieri's synthesizer and keyboards give the songs the perfect backdrop and splash of texture. Edwin is perfect on the bass guitar - and dare I say he didn't move more than 3 feet during the entire show. Porcupine Tree deserves more recognition than they're currently getting... hopefully soon. If The Tree is in town - go see them live. Pick up this DVD and hopefully you'll see what I mean. Great show captured here (5 stars).nius at his work... plays a great guitar, sings well, has a Kurt Cobain presence on stage (posture and hair) and performs utter magic in the studio.

B000FS9FCG|4.0|Despite some deficiencies in the plot, V for Vendetta makes for a fantastic, refreshingly different kind of motion picture.  The controversy surrounding the film was blown out of proportion, but it's easy to see why it could raise hackles in some quarters.  It's really the old terrorist vs. freedom fighter question which has taken on such an important place in modern society.  Despite a jab here or there at the United States, I don't think the film really makes any statement at all along today's geopolitical lines - due in no small part to the story's fantastical setting.  We all know never to say \\"it can't happen here,\\" but I for one can certainly never foresee a blatantly fascist society with its very own Hitlerian demagogue emerging in, of all places, England.  Clearly, at least to me, the questions this film raises are quite abstract and not directly applicable to current events vis-&agrave;-vis the war on terror.  As an eye-opening reminder of the possibility of governmental abuse of power, however, the film's warning stands us all in good stead.<br /><br />The setting for this film is a futuristic England, wherein a fiery egomaniac and his cronies have usurped power and brought a hard iron fist down on the people.  Freedom of ideas and expression no longer exists; minority groups have been decimated by imprisonment, torture, and death; and militaristic nationalism has become the new religion.  Those who resisted the meteoric rise of the new High Chancellor have been dealt with ruthlessly, producing a population cowed and blind to the evils of their brave new nation-state.  The illusion of peace is broken by one man, however - one man brave enough to speak the truth, rally the masses, and get his message out that the government is beyond corrupt and purely evil.  V wears the mask of the infamous Guy Fawkes, but his message is more than symbolic.  For twenty years, he has worked for this moment in time, intent on meting out justice and vengeance on those who wronged him personally and the body politic as a whole.  His tactics are certainly questionable, but his motivations are unimpeachable.<br /><br />It's all too easy to get bogged down in the question as to V's nature - be it terrorist or freedom fighter.  Unfortunately, the question must be asked and has been asked by some who condemn the film for glorifying terrorism.  To my eyes, he's clearly a terrorist - and a freedom fighter.  One has to look at the whole picture, though.  Here, we can see that the government V seeks to destroy is unquestionably evil.  Does that make it okay for V to employ tactics of murder and widespread destruction?  That's for each viewer to decide.  It's difficult to judge a man who does the wrong things for the right reasons.  It's even harder to carry that sort of thinking further, but it's healthy for individuals to ponder such questions, especially as humanity has a long tradition of learning nothing from history.<br /><br />Back to the film itself, one must pay tribute to a number of wonderful performances.  Natalie Portman proves once again that she's among the finest actresses in the world (a fact which George Lucas never seemed to acknowledge, since he didn't allow her to actually act in Star Wars Episode III).  The character of Evey was quite a challenge, but Portman makes you doubt that any other actress could have played her.  Nothing says commitment like a beautiful woman allowing her head to be shaved for the benefit of the character.  Hugo Weaving is mysteriously majestic as the man behind the mask, giving unassailable substance to a character who could have easily come across as cartoonish.  Stephen Rea brings a wonderful human counterpart to the story as the Chief Inspector, and John Hurt is brilliantly effective as the evil Chancellor.  The overall cinematography is also spectacularly done, while the special effects are really something to see.  V for Vendetta really is just a few plot holes and inconsistencies away from being a certifiable five-star film.film.
B00004RYZT|5.0|So basically totally opposite of 99% of the bands out there today. If you dont like Rammstein your scared of reality. <br /> There is no harder working band in music today, they push through the weight of the crowd unlike any other band in recent memory.  <br /> Of course when you have that kind of strength to transform your audience you are lifting up rocks underneath which the sun hasnt shined for a very long time. This explains a lot of the strong themes of their music, they see things in the audience they dont even see in themselves. <br /> The theatrics of the band add a lot to the show, some of it is the band just having a bit of fun but a lot of it contains symbolism and meaning. <br /> Also despite their reputation for being insane, profane, and antisocial a lot of their music is in fact very touching and emotional.  <br />
0393327655|3.0|Few can ignore that for almost three millennia the Abrahamic religions have provided recurring excuses for tribal violence, and still do. And I appreciate Harris for bringing this point to his book and media appearances.     The only thing that turns me off is this. I don't buy into his rigid position that you can't cherry pick the \\"good stuff\\" from the Bible without endorsing its prescriptions for tribal violence. Sure, there are tons of warmongering and misogynistic passages mixed in with the Bible's inspiring wisdom bits. Kind of like most any human I know - an admixture of love and hostility.      Harris thinks moderates who cherry pick the Bible for peacable messages inadvertantly validate the scripture in toto, which means endorsing the violence the Old Testament promotes too. He implies respecting the document is equivalent to endorsing any mob that uses its hostile passages to identify their enemies and victims.     Surely Harris doesn't naively believe we must destroy a faith system entirely in order to bring those who use it justify their violence under control? if so, here's my problem with accepting that approach. First, I believe, men would find other ways to be violent, even without religion. They enjoy it too much. Atheists would still play football. Second, mass destruction wasn't invented by the Bible, but by teh modern era's arms manufacturers. Holy war with modern technology seems to drive Harris' wish to end faith. Hmm...the same fearful WMD visions of a Dick Cheney.     In the end, Harris' all or nothing position seems just as fundamentalist as anything he opposes. What's wrong with extracting best practices from the Bible in the process of exploring what works ethically? It's about as harmful a procedure as finding grown-up jokes in Sesame Street. Just because you find a basic humane principle (meme) in the Bible doesn't mean you automatically put up a promotion banner for internecine warfare. He thinks there are enough bad apples in the versesthat everything is tainted. I disagree.      It's likely Harris is adamantly all or nothing because his debate opponents - the true believers and jihadists - are just as polarized. He's debating people who believe their scriptures are divinely revealed.  But that doesn't change things. His rigid stand rejects and invalidates everything good one of the world's oldest books might pass to us from generations past.     I don't believe the Bible was divinely revealed, but I  reserve my right to cherry pick it, the Dhammpada, the Upanisads, Plato, the Koran, Rumi, Bach, LaoTse, Michaelangelo, Dilbert, Heinlein and any other source from which I can find inspiration.     Why? I don't believe the rational facts of science alone can speak adequately to that intrinsic seventh sense in us that empathizes and recognizes injustice. There is something within the human heart that wants be treated well and senses that treating others well is connected. Whatever passage gives that empathic intention a stronger voice, I'm for cherry picking and replicating -  whether that passage was once lumped with a bunch of bad actors or not.
6305744793|5.0|After so many years, \\"The Addams Family\\" is still one of the best comedies of all time. You can't watch this movie and not laugh, there are so many things are that just really that funny. The stunts and effects of the film are amazing. From small things like the fire on the candle painting of Uncle Fester going out to Thing walking around, this movie is really a feast for the eyes and was ahead of it's time in many areas.<br /><br />Raul Julia and Anjelica Huston made this movie really work because their chemistry works so well on screen. You can see the character's emotions brilliantly portrayed by these two talanted actors. But not forgetting the rest, Christopher Lloyd was made a great Fester. This is a movie that has to be seen if you haven't.

0393327655|4.0|Basically what Harris is trying to say is that the only reason we have our religion is because it is what our parents believe, and if sum1 handed us a book full of stories and told us to believe everything it said, blindly, would we do it? Probably not. But he's not saying that religion is the cause of all our problems, just that we need to stop using faith that has not proof to justify anything. When making big decisions that affect other people, such as abortion or gay marrige, dont use \\"well in the bible it says....\\" to back up your cause because all thats doing is keeping you from truly thinking. <br />-Also, its just flat out ignorant to group this book with communism, if you are your just stupid and dont understand what communism is. <br />-Most of this book is just an analysis so its not gonna be black and white flat out truth, Harris wants you too think and take away what you believe is true from this novel. He uses a whole lot more proof then the bible when you really think about it. <br />-FYI buddhism is more of a lifestyle that can be incorperated into every religion, you can be buddhist and still be christain <br />-I belive that faith is an important part of every persons spiritual and personal life and it helps us feel a connection to something greater than ourselves, i'm a christain. <br />-But i do believe that being a christain isn't believeing everything the bible says about god and jesus, you should still use your own judgement, because if you never really thought and questioned you would still believe in santa clause, and the tooth fairy. <br />-you should be open and read this book, it really opens your mind and helps you understand the world better. Dont let fear of change keep you from knowledge.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|I was lucky enough to get an advance copy and have had a couple weeks for this album to become my latest musical obsession.  Definetly the best rock album I have heard since \\"American Idiot\\", and quite possibly the best rock album I have ever heard.      The title track, \\"I Don't Love You\\", \\"Disenchanted\\" and \\"Famous Last Words\\" are the standouts for me, all with powerful, emotional melodies and some of the most beautiful tortured vocals I can recall hearing. Ever.  The guitar lines and tones defy description, the layers upon layers of vocals, guitars and drums with splashes of orchestra and glockenspiel all reward the listener with each additional listen.  Now that I have the official release in hand, I can't wait to listen with headphones and the lyric booklet and give this incredible CD my full attention.    PS - check out the Liza Minelli cameo.  Also the \\"in studio\\" videos on aol are great.  Especially the triumphant second half of \\"Famous Last Words\\"  Great on the CD and awesome to see it re-created live.
B00005JPB4|5.0|The Premise:<br /><br />Flags of our Fathers is being advertised as a WWII film. That's not entirely accurate. While a great deal of the film does take place during the assault on Iwo Jima, this film is really less about the war and more about raising of the flags on Mt. Suribachi (in case you didn't know by now, there were two flags raised) and the men participated, or didn't participate, in the raising of the second flag.<br /><br />Flags of our Fathers doesn't have much in the way of a plot so it's difficult to describe what this film is about without talking about it's message, and that's the film's job not mine. Suffice it to say, a second flag is raised (for reasons best left to the film to describe) and the press corps uses it as a photo opportunity. Stateside this now legendary photo becomes iconic of the war. The U.S. Government is understandably near bankruptcy from the war in the pacific and having just fought a war in Europe. Civillian moral is low, and it's decided that the government will play on the popularity of this picture by touring the remaining living soldiers who were in the picture around the country as a huge publicity stunt to sell much needed war bonds.<br /><br />John Bradley (Ryan Phillippe), Rene Gagnon (Jesse Bradford), and Ira Hayes (Adam Beach) play the three surviving soldiers in the picture. They don't consider themselves heroes and they are at odds with being treated as such especially since they didn't raise the real flag.<br /><br />Thoughts:<br /><br />Flags of our Fathers is an ugly film. Eastwood has successfully taken one of America's most prideful and storied moments (WWII) and turned it on it's head by showing us the truths we don't want to see. We honor these soldiers now because we failed to do so before. Time and time again, the three \\"heroes of Iwo Jima\\" state to the crowds they are presented before that the real heroes are the ones that died on that island, but no one really listens. No one really cares. The picture of them planting that flag is their connection; their way of feeling a part of the winning team much like how a sports fanatic doesn't care about the real person as much as the fact they wear the same colors.<br /><br />I have a feeling Flags of our Fathers isn't going to appeal to a lot of people because it's an uncompromising look at who we are as a society in the same way a mirror is to a fat person. No matter what make-up or fancy clothes they put on, the mirror still reveals the truth of the problem. Like I said, this is a very ugly film, but don't let that fool you into thinking it's a bad film.<br /><br />I went in to this film expecting it to be below par for a Clint Eastwood (Unforgiven, Mystic River, Million Dollar Baby) film due to the reviews I've read. I went in with a critic's mind waiting for all these supposed failures of the film so that I could accurately relay them in my own critique, but they aren't there. Certainly, as I've mentioned, there are reasons to find this film distasteful and not enjoyable to watch. Eastwood certainly isn't attempting to simply entertain you here, and many aren't going to be entertained. However, subjective reactions don't mean a film is bad.<br /><br />Flags of our Fathers, like Eastwood's most recent films, has something to say. Like Mystic River, it seems facinated with the concept of what we perceive to be the truth, what we want to be the truth, and what the truth really is and how they're almost never the same thing. This film elicits a strong reaction from the viewer. Whether you like it or hate it, agree with it or disagree with it, you will have feelings about this film and it will stick with you.<br /><br />This film will certainly draw comparisons to Saving Private Ryan, but it's not entirely fair to do so. Saving Private Ryan's purpose was paint these soldiers as heroes (and rightfully so), and while Flags of our Fathers definately shows these soldiers as hereos (even the three who don't consider themselves to be so) it's real purpose is to show that the only heroes we see are those that are in our imaginations. The real heroes die unknown and forgotten.<br /><br />The only faults to this film seem trivial to the overall picture. It does seem to run a little long, and the narrative seems disjointed at times. The acting performances are all good (even Paul Walker) but fall short of greatness. Others will claim that this film serves as an allegory to today's political environment, but Eastwood is simply showing us that as much as things are different they are the same. And he should know; he was there.<br /><br />The Verdict:<br /><br />Clint Eastwood shows again why he's one of the greatest filmmakers in cinema. Flags of our Fathers' less obvious themes are very similar his past work while the film itself is completely different. The lack of a plot driven story and it's unflinching look the ugly side of America should make you consider before seeing this film. Beyond the subjective entertainment level this film will bring to various people, Flags of our Fathers stands as a great American film that deserves to be applauded. Bravo, Clint! Bravo.<br /><br />Extras:<br /><br />Clint Eastwood actually shot two films when he made Flags of our Fathers. The second film acts as a companion piece that serves to tell about the Battle of Iwo Jima from the Japanese perspective. It's based on a book called \\"Red Sun, Black Sand\\" but the name for the film has been changed to \\"Letters from Iwo Jima.\\" It stars Ken Watanabe (Last Samurai, Batman Begins).

B000HCO83Q|4.0|X-Men, The Last Stand is not a perfect movie, but it is better than the reviews led me to think it would be. The issue here is that a \\"cure\\" has been found for the mutations, but many of the mutants do not feel they need to be cured. Good things about the movie included some terrific interaction between Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan and a superb performance by Famke Jannsen, who had been underutilized in the previous films. Hugh Jackman and Halle Berry turn in their usual good performances. There are some flaws--the introduction without explanation of the character who can go through walls, and for all the hoopla about Angel, he actually played a very small part in the movie. I also understand that those who have followed the series in the comic books have a lot of complaints about discrepancy between the movie and the comics. Also, if one wanted to, one could look at the movie from the allegorical standpoint of a comparison between the mutants and homosexuals, but I don't know why anyone would want to. Just don't overthink it, sit back and enjoy the show.
0743298020|2.0|I was waiting to read this book due to an excellent synopsis and reviews.  Upon reading it, the first 3 chapters held me enthralled with its gothic mood and loved Lea's love of books.  However, after the 3rd chapter, the storyline became very \\"syrupy\\"...it was too inundated with all gothic themes that I feel was somehow borrowed from other classic and/or romantic gothic authors, such as Bronte, Collins, Walpole, even contemporary authors such as Holt and Whitney.  Veda Winter seemed too much of a theatrical character to be believed.  I'd much rather have read more of Lea's story than Veda's.  It was a struggle to read past the 6th chapter and have decided to stop and not waste time I could be reading a better novel.
B000F8O35U|5.0|My wife and I just watched this disney movie with our 8 year old son.<br /><br />The colors are exquisite, deeply saturated, clear crisp detail, and picture quality is incredible.<br /><br />Sound quality was substantially better than the original.  All 6 channels of sound were strong without being harsh, and convey a sense of beauty.<br /><br />The film is all about the triumph of human spririt.  I'm sure that the girls will relate to the princess, but my son was impressed as well.<br /><br />Thanks Disney for doing such a great job in remastering this classic.  I will keep it in my library for the princesses in my family.

B000GY729M|4.0|After listening to the album for a week or so prior going to their show in Denver, CO, I must say I was a bit skeptical.  Hot Fuss was great but the new album didn't seem to live up to the debut.  Watching their horrendous appearance on SNL and MTV, I was prepared to eat my hard earned cash and expect a bad show.  Fortunately, the show was the best I've seen in quite some time, and the live performances kill the studio versions making this album so much more enjoyable to listen to.  I can definitely tell what they were aiming for in this album's sound, it's a shame they couldn't capture all of the experience on this album.  Definitely check out their show.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I think years from now, we will all look back and count Firefly among the many series that were unjustly cancelled before it's time (i.e. The original Star Trek, Enterprise, etc).  Why did the television executives in their ivory towers cancel this show?  Probably to make room for some low budget reality show for the undiscerning masses.  My rants aside, this show was extremely original, the writing couldn't have been better, and the cast was fantastic.  If you have not had a chance to see this series, try it out, and be sure to follow it with the movie entitled \\"Serenity\\" as this film ties up all the loose ends left over when this show was axed.  Even though this show was cut too short, it still stands on its own as one of the best sci-fi television series undertakings of all time.
0307237699|5.0|The life of a politician is very stressful according to Barack Obama, and I truly believe him.  He is hopeful that America can be a place where all Americans can prosper, no matter what their dreams are.  He is a father who loves to spend time with his wife and two daughters.  His long legislative sessions sometimes force him to postpone vacations or miss a school function.  Obama  has been mistaken for a valet by white people outside of a restaurant.  He has also been followed by security guards just because the color of his skin.  Yet, he remains a politician who believes that all citizens can live in harmony regardless of their ethnic background. Barack's belief in partial birth abortion has drawn criticism and questions about his Christian faith from his former opponent in the Senate race Alan Keyes,  nurses and newspaper writers.  Barack grew up exposed to all different religions.  By reading the Bible and the Koran as a child, he is a man with a respect for all religions.  Obama supports many good ideas in my opinion.  He supports affirmative action, a movement that gives all people from different minorities and individuals with disabilities  equal opportunity in admissions to colleges and access to jobs in the work force.  Obama believes that the United States government and political regardless of party, should strive to meet the needs of all citizens.  Barack supports giving welfare benefits to legal immigrants and putting child locks on guns.  Barack strongly believes that people who serve in public office should strive to perform their jobs with integrity.  Obama believes that public servants should listen to the needs of the people they serve, and they be held accountable for personal involvement in scandals and mis use of tax payer money.  Obama has made his share of mistakes along the way.  He accidently pressed the wrong button and voted against a bill that protected children against sexual predators.  He missed voting on an important bill about gun control, because he was on vacation.  The Audacity of Hope is a honest inside look about how difficult the job of a politician really is. This book also gives the reader a clear picture of Barack's position on issues like values, family, politics and race.  This book portrays  Barack Obama as a very knowledgeable and compassionate person.

076531178X|5.0|Another great tale by Sanderson ( who also wrote Elantris), featuring an interesting magic system (Allomancy) using metals that give certain people--\\"Mistings\\"--one magical ability if consumed.  Certain others find they are Mistborn, and able to do multiple abilities.  This is set against a dark empire that has ruled harshly for countless years--led by immortal un-killable Lord Ruler and his gangs of Inquisitors--hunters and enforcers, using magic powers and marked by steel spikes through their eyes-- and obligators going about in society, watching everything with their Ministry-tattoos around their eyes.  And a landscape of cites and lands darkened by volcanic ash-falls and brown plants.  Against these powers are a former thief, turned rebel, a Mistborn half-breed (only the aristocracy should have such powers by genetics...the Skaa underclass, are killed if they have relations with the aristocracy and may produce a child).  He is the Survivor of Hathsin -the only known person who has lived and escaped from the Mines.  He now leads an extraordinary heist team aiming for the treasure of the Lord Ruler and the overthrow of the Final Empire along the way.  Joining his team is the new-found half-Skaa Mistborn, Vin... a child of the streets who only gradually learns to trust her new associates and start to grow into her potential.<br /><br />Well-drawn characters and thorough world-building with a suspenseful plot--an unbeatable combination!
B000HD1AEA|5.0|I was so surprised when I came across this CD in my local music store.  Ever since the Mirrorball CD and DVD came out in 1999 I've wished that the audio CD contained all twenty-three songs.  Now it does!  I wonder why it took so long?

B000FVQYYK|5.0|I've never been a Muse fan, I've never liked a single song by them, infact the only thing about them which ever struck a chord with me was a few decent guitar riffs. This album however, is a completely different story! <br /> <br />Supermassive Black Hole instantly caught my attention as soon as I heard it. I thought it must have just been a one-off, but I heard samples of some of their other songs on this album and I liked what I was hearing so I chanced it. I couldn't believe what a great album it is, even more so considering I never even liked this band before. <br /> <br />Another thing which I always hated about them was their messy tiny production combined with dominant piercing vocals. This album sorts all that out, it's very nicely produced and the vocals have been pushed way back in the mix which is awesome. Every song is good to great, at first Supermassive Black Hole was my fave, but Starlight is also fantastic. It is a modern day classic. These days more and more I find myself singing Map Of The Problematique to myself, this is such an amazing song. It has a lot of atmosphere and emotion, it's everything a great album track should be. <br /> <br />I still don't like old Muse, but I love this! Anyone who doesn't like old Muse, give this a chance, I think they've finally found themselves and shown us a potential which not all of us gave them credit for!
B000001Y9I|5.0|Seriously, Ritchie Blackmore set the stage for Deep Purple's long term success and no one can take that away from him.  On the other hand, his fickle nature opened the door for other qualified guitarists to keep the fire burning and Steve Morse has done a fine job of it.  The obvious fear is that a musician of Morse's skill and imagination would drive the Purple sound into something different (as other incarnations have done with nowhere near the same level of talent or success).  Given his complex work with Dixie Dregs and Kansas, Morse demonstrates not just extraordinary restraint but an intuitive understanding of Deep Purple's musical history to which he plays with a great deal of deference.  The result is an album that stands alongside the best of Mark II.
B000GG4XJM|5.0|I originally wrote what appears below in October...and here it is..August and the DVD is out  and looks and sounds great.  But it still looks like Bruce was milking money from his diehards.... count me as one of them.  I bought the dvd but did not and will not buy the American Land edition of the cd.    [[ASIN:B000P12LX8 Bruce Springsteen with the Sessions Band: Live In Dublin]]      I gave it 5 stars based on the 1st version of the album. I am rather disappointed that this version is out with a few extra live tracks and the documentary when all of these things will more than likely be released on the eventual dvd.  It looks to me like a way to cash in a bit more. Something I never envisioned Springsteen would do to admirers of his music.
B000002UAX|5.0|As of this writing, I've done well over 100 reviews on amazon.  I think this is my first Beatles review.  I have just about everything they ever recorded, plus most of the post Beatles Lennon work, and the post Beatles McCartney work that matters (sadly, McCartney post Beatles....well, let's not get into THAT discussion). <br /> <br />What can be said about this record that hasn't already been said?  Well, in reading review after review, maybe there IS something I can add, since, it looks to me like even many Beatles fans don't \\"get\\" the White album. <br /> <br />For example, many describe it as the Beatles breaking up, and therefore a half as*ed effort.  OK, so they were splintering artistically, but the White album is anything but half as*ed.  If anything, it stands as their magnum opus, and arguably, their greatest effort. <br /> <br />Others describe individual songs, for example \\"revolution number 9\\", as Lennon's avant garde tendencies gone mad, or a symptom of \\"too much Yoko\\".   <br /> <br />Plain and simple, the White album is the Beatles carefully calculated and thought out catalog of their entire career from their early simple songs to their later complex LSD influenced psychedelia.  Song for song, each of their various stages in their short yet incomparably influential career is ingeniously documented by the band itself on the White album.   <br /> <br />As to \\"revolution number 9\\", it's neither Lennon's avant garde tendencies gone mad or too much Yoko.  It's an homage to Stockhausen, Schoenberg, and John Cage. <br /> <br />Aside from being a catalog compiled by the band itself, the White album is one of the all time classic concept albums that deserves to be listened to in one (hopefully psychedelic) session.  Since it was recorded with this idea in mind, maybe it's only in that mental state or context that one \\"gets\\" what they were trying to do with the album.   <br /> <br />

B000002JSN|5.0|Every single Led Zeppelin album is flat out great and this one is one of the best. It's really hard to point out how this album is not as good as the others. Thus this is an easy 5 stars and one of their best. This two disk set is awesome. I think disk 1 is a classic by itself. That alone would have been one of their best albums. Disk 2 is not quite as good but it also would have been a classic album by itself. Put the two together and you have one of Led Zeppelins best albums. Very catchy tunes and you know the guitar is going to rock your soxs off.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|This may be my favorite RHCP album yet... <br /> <br />I grew up with Blood Sugar Sex Magik.  I can still listen to that album today and enjoy its fairly \\"hard\\" sound, it showed the world what the RHCP style would be. Skip a few years and Californication came out.  I viewed this as their tallent to write a hook, to appeal to the top 40.  The songs sounded nice but seemed to lack the lasting power and meaning that i'd expect from an older more matured band. Stadium Arcadium has both. <br /> <br />Many of the bands that i will grow up and tell my kids about have gone through this same transformation: <br /> <br />dookie--> Boulevard of broken dreams <br />Odelay-->seachange/guero <br />Blood sex magik-->stadium arcadium <br /> <br />In short, i view this album as a matured equally enjoyable yet more deep RHCP. <br /> <br />The first stage of listening to music i think is the music itself.  It has to SOUND good. I admit, a lot of rap SOUNDS good, but in recent years it typically lacks another important aspect...lyrics that have meaning. Blood sex magik sounded good, but i was young and so were the RHCP so some of the  songs that lacked any real meaning were still able to be \\"good\\", and they still are.  Californication sounds good, but no one cares that say California is the do all and end all for society.  Then you look at a song like \\"Say oh\\" which not only sounds good but is a very personal song that enables the listener to question themself. <br /> <br />The RHCP have graduated folks...buy this stuff!
0465092756|5.0|For anyone with at least a moderate academic background in physics Dr. Woit's book is a much better introduction to the problems with string theory, and the cottage industry that has grown up about it, than the Smolin book which covers similar territory.  \\"Not Even Wrong\\", unlike \\"The Trouble With Physics\\", is meticulously organized, copiously footnoted, contains suggestions for further reading at the end of each chapter, and has a beautiful introduction to the nuts and bolts of the existing and proposed experimentation upon which the verifiability of string theory depends.  If you've ever struggled through the texts of Arfken, Bjorken (or Peskin & Schroeder), Goldstein, Jackson, and Messiah at some point in your life, but the likes of Choquet-Bruhat, Baez, Weinberg and Kaku are still somewhat beyond reach, this is the book for you.

B000HT3P7E|5.0|I'll be buying this the second it comes out.  It is the most underrated sitcom on TV today.  I'd argue it is just behind The Office in quality.  I grew in the golden age (the '80s, not the '50s) of the sitcom.  As the years passed, good ones fell away, Seinfeld saved it for a while and it too moved off into the sunset.  I tend to love sitcoms with a bit whimsy, a bit of heart, and romance.  My all time standard is the Wonder Years.  While this is more \\"sitcomy,\\" it is more like a beautifully executed film.  Twenty-two (and this season is even better) episodes or 11 hours of a great romantic comedy.  Hollywood should take note.  The cast is pitch perfect.  All of them.  Neil patrick harris gets most of the press, but Josh Radnor is fantastic.  Colby Smulders is a great addition to the american comedy scene.  The rest?  Smashing.  They really don't come any better than this.  Take the time to fall in love.  Even with Bob Saget's voice.  This show is the best.  You won't regreat it.
B000H7JD4A|5.0|Every Iron Maiden album since Somewhere in Time initially received poor reviews and A Matter of Life and Death will be no different. It seems to me the Maiden albums, especially those with Bruce Dickinson on vocals, take a while to fully open up and envelop the listener if given repeat plays. Multiple listens can be utterly rewarding when listening to post-Blaze albums, as evidenced with the amazing Brave New World, one of the greatest comeback albums ever, and its heavy successor Dance of Death.<br /><br />Speaking of the band's previous two discs with Dickinson at the helm, it is basically impossible not to compare them with A Matter of Life and Death, as Maiden have carved their own niche and created their unique sound years ago. It is daft to expect them to deviate from a sound they made their own through years and years of dedicated work and do \\"something different\\". Do not listen to this album if that's what you are anticipating. This album is still built around the ideas and themes we've come to love Maiden over the years. Steve Harris still lays down numerous galloping riffs and goes back to utilising enchanting keyboards much like the ones on Brave New World. While Dance of Death found Iron Maiden striving for heavier musical statements, their new album sees them going back to the highly gripping melodic-signature writing of Brave New World and injecting that sound with the production values of The X Factor from the Blaze era.<br /><br />It is true that the mix and production of A Matter of Life and Death is no way similar to those heard on its predecessors. Kevin Shirley's engineering has rendered both Dickinson's vocals and the guitar team's tones several decibels lower than most CDs, but therefore, the music is not compressed the least bit and has more vivid dynamics. These mostly shine through during Harris and McBrain's rhythm arrangements, which are noticeably more natural sounding. Even though I'll take a better produced drum sound over this one any day of the week, for this particular disc, the human feel carried over is marvellous. McBrain plays in a relatively more straightforward style through most of the course of the album, but his time changes and crescendos are essential to the songs' flow.<br /><br />What's best about the album is that one will feel he knows all the songs upon first listen, since they are all injected with the classic Maiden signature, but further listens will attest to its diversity. Each new spin warrants something new, as it's virtually impossible not recognize the energy, maturity, and brilliance of this band. On the Gers/Harris-penned \\"The Pilgrim\\" and the brilliant final track \\"The Legacy\\", the folky, upbeat acoustic guitar lines function perfectly underneath Harris' pronounced bass and Dickinson's melodic singing. The former has a subtle eastern feel to it; while \\"The Legacy\\" is a prime example of Iron Maiden's darker songwriting. Almost like a leftover from The X Factor, this song is epic in both its size and execution. Surrounded by claustrophobic, suffocating production elements, it flows seamlessly from ghostly acoustic passages to vital keyboard sequences and majestic fretwork.<br /><br />As with some of their previous material, songs like \\"These Colours Don't Run\\" and \\"Brighter Than a Thousand Suns\\" open up with Harris' slowly building bass arpeggios, only to develop into crushing soundscapes with the arrival of three-part guitar sections. Mind you, the guitar sound of this album is slightly behind those on the band's previous outputs, but there is still plenty of punch and melodic awareness present. The explosive riffs that come after Dickinson's lower register singing on \\"Brighter Than a Thousand Suns\\" are amazing, not to mention Harris' bass solo in perfect harmony with acoustic chords. Adrian Smith also plays a fantastic guitar synth on this piece.<br /><br />\\"The Longest Day\\" arguably features the guitar trio's finest soloing on this disc, as each one has enough spaceto highlight it with their own style and sound, but it is also the brilliant keyboards that elevate it to the next level. \\"Out of the Shadows\\" is the band's ballad-style number, while on \\"The Reincarnation of Benjamin Greeg\\" and the only Harris-penned \\"For the Greater Good of God\\" retreat the album's sound into darker territory, providing thought-provoking themes and lyrical concepts. Dickinson particularly shines on the former, which may be my personal favourite vocal delivery on the album, whilst the latter is defined by clever dynamic shifts and drawn-out guitar work.<br /><br />This is a very solid album. Granted, it won't be in my top 10 of the year or anything, but it more than serves its purpose, and has incredible staying power. Though Brave New World will always be my favourite from the second Dickinson era, I can safely say this one's already surpassed Dance of Death for me.ough space to highlight it with their own style and sound, but it is also the brilliant keyboards that elevate it to the next level. \\"Out of the Shadows\\" is the band's ballad-style number, while on \\"The Reincarnation of Benjamin Greeg\\" and the only Harris-penned \\"For the Greater Good of God\\" retreat the album's sound into darker territory, providing thought-provoking themes and lyrical concepts.

B000GY729M|2.0|Honestly the only songs I like on this CD are Sam's Town and When You Were Young.  The \\"Enterlude\\" is okay and I listen to it between these two songs.  But all the songs after that I really don't like.  Instead of the cool vibe from the first album you just get this kinda depressing vibe- and not in a good way.  There are a few parts in a few different songs I like but it's not worth it to listen to those whole songs again.  Some stuff is just embarrassing like Uncle Johnny and Bones.  Stuff like Uncle Johnny seems like a bad attempt at making a serious song about something real... with a bunch of random lyrics and a detached attitude.    The backround vocals they added in some parts are awkward...  you can tell the other band members can't sing so it's like just some dudes singing along with Brandon.  Backround vocals are either really good or really bad, and if they're gonna be really bad then don't do them!    I've had albums grow on me before, but those have had certain elements that made me want to go back and listen.  Honestly after listening to this three times I'm pretty sure I'm never gonna fall for \\"Don't you wanna feel my bones on your bones\\" and \\"Hey Johnny I got faith in you man!\\".    I like the song Sam's Town a LOT and I like the song When You Were Young a LOT.  So my review scores it two stars- one for each good song.
B000062YAZ|4.0|Just had to get that out of the starting gate, too many people spell it Raining Blood and not Reign in Blood...big difference people.<br /><br />Ok, anyway this is primo Slayer material, just comes up a little short to \\"Hell Awaits\\" and \\"Show No Mercy\\", but still considered a choice cut. If you purchase this you are guarenteed a flury of high speed guitar riffs, crazy atonal solos and pounding drums (though the drums patterns start to get very repeative very fast)...good thrash. The lyrics are mainly about death and dying and anti-relegious ideas, which is to be expected. The production is a wee bit subpar but comparable to similar material at the time of its original release. I do not understand why people say this is brutal, it is really not, but that does not mean it is bad. New fans start here. Also good if you are in need of having a serious workout for your neck.
B000GG4KTU|5.0|Isn't this a perfect CD to listen to on a lovely day like today? To me, this latest offering from Diana Krall is one of her most impressive CDs along with \\"When I Look In Your Eyes,\\" \\"The Look of Love\\" and \\"Love Scenes.\\" These are by far my top-four-absolute-favorites from all of her albums for these are the very same recordings that she was at her best. Her flawless performances confirm and validate her versatility and her worthiness to be in the category of jazz divas of all-time.<br /><br />This CD offers a dazzling collection of standards recorded tastefully with new treatments that redefine Ms. Krall as a great jazz singer and piano player as well. These are the jazziest and some of the best-ever interpretations of all-time. The artful chart arrangements by a brilliant arranger/conductor/bassist John Clayton are blazingly sublime and his creativity brings out the jazziest side of the singer. There's no wonder he's one of the most trusted names in jazz orchestration for twenty-some years now. With his swinging orchestra in the picture and Diana Krall's superb performances, you'll never go wrong with this CD.<br /><br />She will leave you simply breathless with her outstanding takes on Irving Berlin chestnut \\"Isn't This A Lovely Day,\\" a Van Heusen & Burke gem of a song \\"It Could Happen To You\\" and Antonio Carlos Jobim classic \\"How Insensitive,\\" which is performed in a very splendid and so romantic way.<br /><br />Like a genuine jazz singer, she swings and scats in \\"Day In Day Out,\\" \\"From This Moment On\\" and \\"Come Dance With Me\\" (\\"Hey there cutes, put on those Basie boots and come dance with me\\"). She gives a lot of verve into these songs leaving you in an effervescent mood, but she will also move you to tears with her breathy and sultry voice as she sings an achingly-beautiful ditty, \\"Willow Weep For Me,\\" composed by Ann Ronnell who dedicated it to her mentor George Gershwin. It was so popular in the thirties and renewed its popularity in the sixties when the British duo and favorites of mine Chad & Jeremy recorded it. The arrangement by John Clayton is totally astounding and features his orchestra, the singer herself on piano solo and Tamir Hendelman on piano. And focus your ears to that haunting bridge as Jeff Clayton and Terell Stafford do a musical conversation on a sweeping soprano sax solo and a gorgeous trumpet solo, respectively.<br /><br />Ms. Krall shows off not only her extraordinary vocals and piano skills but also her flair in arranging on Jimmy McHugh & Dorothy Fields \\"Exactly Like You,\\" Rodgers & Hart's \\"Little Girl Blue,\\" Gershwin Brothers \\"I Was Doing Alright\\" and the last track \\"You Can Depend On Me,\\" a song so special that it was saved for last . . . but not least.<br /><br />\\"I wish you success and loads of happiness<br />But I must confess I'll be lonely<br />But if you ever need a friend<br />I'm yours till the end<br />And you can depend on me.\\"<br /><br />With my heartfelt recommendation for your listening enjoyment.ine Chad & Jeremy recorded it.

B000002HMH|2.0|Say you where an alien from another planetary system and you landed on Earth in 1996 (or perhaps consider yourself a lonely wildman returning to civilization after being stranded in British Columbia since the 1980's, but I think the alien situation is cooler.) having never before listened to Metallica. You come into contact with me for reason, call it fate, and I present you with two CDs - both Metallica. One CD is \\"Master of Puppets\\" and the other is, well, this example of what happens when good bands loose their mind. Even if you had never seen or heard of Metallica before you could tell that they changed their style just by comparing the two above-mentioned CD samples. The band cut their hair; the album cover is very different to say the least (it features cow semen mixed with blood), even the Metallica logo is different. So obviously the band has evolved (or de-evolved) their sonic stylings. Now I applaud bands for attempting to change, I mean who wants to listen to the same material belted out over and over again? I consider \\"...And Justice for All\\" to be an evolution of \\"Master of Puppets\\", just like as I consider the Black Album to a natural progression from AJFA, and this is true of Metallica's earlier albums too. But at this album Metallica decided to try and do something different...they sold out. The album is such a blatantly obvious attempt to gain more mainstream fans. And mind you, I have nothing wrong with a band gaining popularity, more power to them for living out their dreams, but a band sells out when they drastically alter their music and appearance in an move I can only fathom as a desperate move to gain more fame (and therefore more money). And Metallic did just that. And not to do a complete reverse, but this is not half bad for what it is. The music is actually pretty solid; it just does not hold my interest and pails in comparison to their previous albums. So I will say to exercise extreme caution when purchasing this Load (am I clever or what?), if you are a fan of old Metallica, you probably will not like this, but if you are new to the game this might be a good place to start, but not the best. I recommend any of their previous five albums to this.at?), if you are a fan of old Metallica, you probably will not like this, but if you are new to the game this might be a good place to start, but not the best.

B00005B4GU|4.0|\\"Amnesiac\\" is Radiohead's 2001 album, their fifth, made up of tracks recorded during the \\"Kid A\\" sessions.     I'm not the biggest fan of Radiohead around, but I've ended up owning practically all their records because there's always something interesting to listen to on them. \\"Amnesiac\\" is no exception. There's electronica on \\"Packt Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box\\" and \\"I Might Be Wrong\\", moody guitar work on \\"Knives Out\\". \\"Pyramid Song\\" has lyrics that describe one of Thom Yorke's dreams, while the piano has a jilted sense of rhythm you'd expect to find on a Syd Barrett record. \\"Like Spinning Plates\\" is a track with backwards piano and lyrics (also backwards) that flip forward when you least expect it. Kind of reminded me a bit of the Can song \\"Oh Yeah\\" (from Tago Mago) in that way. \\"You and Whose Army\\" and \\"Life in a Glass House\\" recall an older way of writing songs, while \\"Dollars and Cents\\" (the song that probably took me the most listens to like) gathers all these influences and moods together and delivers what has turned out to be one of my favorite tracks.    There is a track here that you'll also find on Kid A, \\"Morning Bell\\". This ones a little less electronic, and a bit more cluttered in atmosphere. I actually prefer this version a little more to the Kid A version though.    It's not exactly a perfect album. Tracks like the noisy \\"Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors\\", while they make for reasonable ambience for a listen or two, fall a little short. I really don't understand why they didn't put on some of the tracks that ended up hidden away as B-sides, like \\"Cuttooth\\" from the Knives Out single (a song I really like). It's not that they were short of room, there's at least half an hour of unused CD space on the disc. I'm not sure whether I like \\"Hunting Bears\\" or not either, which is a short, sparse instrumental. It's a little painful to listen to on headphones thanks to the production, though it's probably one of the most interesting sound waves to watch as visuals on a computer, and its got a unique mood.    Speaking of the production, the band and producer Nigel Godrich have given these songs a rather different sound than \\"Kid A\\", even though they are songs from the same sessions. It's kind of a dull sound, not as in boring but as in lacking a lot of sonic colour. It's almost as if these songs were forgotten about, and had gone dull with age and neglect. Forgotten about, kind of fits in with the \\"Amnesiac\\" theme...    Artist Stanley Donwood, designer of the booklet, also seems to have had a lot of fun with the \\"Amnesiac\\" idea. The booklet seems to be a representation of a history book \\"The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\\" which has doubled as a journal of sorts for someone, full of drawings, computer generated images and typed text. A history book helps a person remember, and so does a personal journal. Has this got anything to do with the title \\"Amnesiac\\", a word used to describe someone who needs help remembering? Putting full lyrics in the booklet has definitely been forgotten about! Also, bordering the liner notes, are random statements and phrases, some from the songs, their context all but forgotten. I don't know whether I'm reading too much into a practically wordless booklet, but it's good fun trying to figure it out.    \\"Amnesiac\\" is probably my favorite Radiohead album, and the one I'd recommend to people new to the band (though really, any from \\"The Bends\\" to this one would do as an introduction). The famous \\"OK Computer\\", though it has some great songs on it, doesn't quite feel as true to the nature of the band as this one somehow, and its this nature that keeps me coming back to \\"Amnesiac\\", which I listen to about seven times for every one time I listen to \\"OK Computer\\". With \\"Amnesiac\\", you can hear the band's strengths alongside their weaknesses, so it's more personal that way. Being outtakes of sorts, it's also a little more intimate too. There's arty ambition, but it doesn't feel like its made to impress anyone here.    Overall, it's worth a listen if you're interested.
6305781427|5.0|This dvd is inspiring. The chemistry between Yanni the audience and the orchestra (he has the backing of a great philarmonic orchestra and two virtuosos on the violin) are unique. The place where the consert takes place is a monument with thousand years of history Parthenon and the theater of Herodotus of Attiki which are uniqly lit for the occassion. Watching how the audience reacts to these unique compositions is incredible. Track number 7 is great, the two violin players it is as if they have a competition who will play faster. And the last one (reflections of passion) is propably one of the best songs he has ever composed. it was my wedding song. If you are planning to visit Greece get this dvd. Watch it beforehand to see what awaits you, and see it afterwards as well and for sure it will give you a strong desire to go back; as it did to me when I watched it for first time in 1997 and I was for three years in a row outside of Greece. If you already have the cd it is still worth bying the dved because these excellent compositions are coupled with breathtaking images.

6305428387|5.0|What a great comedy this is. The humour it has is timeless and gives you some really heartfelt laughs.<br /><br />Most of all what an important message it has in this dope infested world of sports! This film in a masterful way shows that what matters is not the victory but just being there and participating. These movie should be shown to the kids that participate in sports in all schools colleges academies . Not to leave out the parents that sometimes push their kids in an unreasonable way.<br /><br />Finally this movie shows in a very eloquent way that regardless of what your circumstances are you can fulfil any goal you set and pursue in an elaborate way.<br /><br />Really clean family entertainment with John Cndy in one of his best roles. I highly recommend it to everyone.
0786191465|5.0|I was assigned to read this book for a class called Psychology: Intro to Counseling, Theory and Practice. The book talks about Frankl and his meaning for his life, how and what he found meaning in while in the concentration camps. It is an existentialist writing about his experiences. He grew, he learned, he made choices, and lived life for himself, even under the guise of imprisonment. The fact that any one man can find meaning in all of this is amazing. I really wish I had the chance to meet Krankl and speak with him. It is a powerful story and a great theory. Logotherapy is worth of even the most devoted Freud Fan.
B000BMSTMS|5.0|The first time I heard Korn was on the radio.  I heard song after song on the radio including \\"Got the Life\\", \\"Freak on a Leash\\", and \\"Make Me Bad\\", among many others.  Everytime I heard a great song, I later learned that it was performed by this same group, Korn.  So I bought one of their albums, \\"Issues\\", and found it to be very enjoyable (except for most of the lyrics).  Since then I have consistently bought every new album that they have produced and only found that they keep getting better and better.  I often don't value their lyrics, but lyrics isn't why I listen to them.  Their ability to come up with great tunes is truly phenominal!  Don't be fooled by those who say these guys have no musical talent.  My favorite song is now one that is on this album, called \\"Open Up\\".  However, this is just one of the many great songs.  \\"Twisted Transister\\",  \\"Throw Me Away\\", \\"Love Song\\", \\"I've Seen it All\\", and \\"Tearjerker\\" all stand out, in my opinion.  The rest of the songs are also very enjoyable.  I bought the two disc set, and the second disc is also good.  However, with the two discs you get \\"Twisted Transister\\" three times as different versions, but all are good.  Korn is far from dead, in terms of musical talent.  They may not be for everyone, but if you love to rock, you have to give them a try.  They're my favorite band, minus some of the lyrics.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|I've bought four of these over the past year.  My father moved away and took two of them (he loved mine) and the extra one is going to be a Christmas gift for a friend.  I've been using mine for a little over a year and have not had the problems that some of the others have been experiencing.  I was going to order another one when I read all of the negative reviews on the batteries and I must admit, it made me a bit nervous.  I have not let the battery deplete completely and when I charge it, I put it in the charger before I go to bed and leave the sweeper in the kitchen to remind me to take the battery out of the outlet unit when I get up. It is in the back of my head to never leave it in the charger for 24 hrs.  I don't know if that has made the difference in the life of the battery(?) I have been very impressed with this sweeper.
B000IONJJ2|5.0|My favorite image in this film has to do with the outrage on the face of the woman (whose family catches John Cleese undressing) when he uses her photograph to \\"cover himself\\". The death (and burial) of each doggie will have you laughing progressively more. My only question has to do whether this DVD needs a double dip. Is a new edition going to make it even funnier ?. At any rate, the extras look rather good which should help you make up your mind on whether to buy this edition.

0743298020|2.0|I am not surprised by the many positive reviews, for the prose is artful, the plot seductively twisted, and the characters vividly drawn. But for me, the plot unfolds too slowly, the underlying themes of abuse and mental illness too melancholy, and the characters too bizarre to relate to. Although it held my interest to the end, this book doesn't make my top ten list for 2006 and is grossly over-hyped.
B000GY729M|4.0|This is most definitely NOT \\"Hot Fuss 2.\\" The Killers take their rep as last year's model and climb into a Pink Cadillac, which they floor the accelerator and beat a retreat from the glitz that one would associate with their home digs of Las Vegas and start screaming down the boulevard toward the East Coast and the Jersey Shore. Gone is most of the breezy 80's New Wave giddiness and in its place is....Bon Jovi's New Jersey? Yes, I have read the interviews where the ever cocky Brandon Flowers declares his newly discovered love for Bruce Springsteen, but frankly he is not anywhere close to that level of artistic acumen. So rather than get a five star extravaganza like \\"Born In The USA,\\" we get The Killers' approximation of \\"Slippery When Wet.\\"<br /><br />This is not a bad thing. It is obvious to me that The Killers are expanding their reach and desires. There are a couple moments of brilliance on \\"Sam's Town,\\" like the (excuse the pun) killer lead single \\"When You Were Young.\\" The band brings the urgency of the \\"Hot Fuss\\" singles to lyrics that match up to their new found appreciation for Springsteen and make the jump from good songs to great songs. Same with \\"Bones,\\" a good song that gets extra cinematic punch from an Asbury Jukes styled horn chart, again making the leap to greatness.<br /><br />But there are also moments where the reach exceeds the grasp. The \\"Exitude\\" and \\"Enterlude\\" bits are kind of silly. There are moments - like on \\"This River Is Wide\\" - when it sounds like Flowers is singing beyond his range. \\"Sam's Town\\" also hits the occasional lyrical snag, like on \\"Bling (Confessions Of A King),\\" where someone should have told the band that \\"I awoke on the roadside in the land of the free ride\\" would be considered third rate lyrics even for Bon Jovi. (Even if the song has an unbeatable hook.) Aside from that minor glitch, \\"Sam's Town\\" comes crammed with the kind of American Character songs that populate the Springsteen/Mellencamp universe of cars and seekers, like \\"Uncle Jonny\\" and the title track.<br /><br />Overall, The Killers' sophomore effort is more hit than miss. And I am willing to give them the benefit of a bonus half/star just on the fact that they were unwilling to coast on their triple platinum laurels and challenge themselves. They may not be up to their \\"Born To Run\\" yet, but at least they didn't cut a \\"Fairweather Johnson.\\"ekers, like \\"Uncle Jonny\\" and the title track. <br /> <br />Overall, The Killers' sophomore effort is more hit than miss.

B000HEWEE4|3.0|I liked the movie from the romantic, filming angles etc. but there are lots of logical inconsistencies. Alex buys the Lake House - who does the doctor rent it from? Wouldn't Bullock's character do a search for Alex in 2006. Google, phone directory, private detective or whatnot. And all she needed to say is come see me in 2006 anyway. They plan the one date at the restaurant in 2006. Wouldn't they have tried to meet before that?  And doesn't she wonder why Alex hasn't come looking for her in 2006 before she ended up waiting at the restaurant? Then at the end of the movie when she is in 2008, she goes to the Lake House to leave Alex a message. But then it is 2006 in his time and he wasn't living at the Lake House in 2006. She moved out of it in 2006... And was that his 2008 self who showed up? Maybe I missed something on these points?
B000GY729M|3.0|I was really anticipating this album and I have to admit I was a little dissapointed. In my opinion, there are some good songs (I really like \\"Read My Mind\\", \\"Bones\\" and \\"Bling\\"). But on other tracks like \\"For Reasons Unknown\\" and \\"Uncle Johnny\\", the lyrics and music sounds like Blink-182 6 years ago and the vocals sound like all the generic \\"emo\\" music that popular now. In summary, theres a few good songs but I think the album fails. I also think it doesnt demonstrate \\"growth\\" because they went from sounding distinctive to sounding like every other band now. Also, no, the lyrics are not that profound, if you care about that. <br />Someone mentioned that this isn't even the best album that came out on October 3rd, because Beck released The Information. Id like to add, that The Decemberists came out with The Crane Wife on that day as well, and its also way better than this.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Mel Gibson directed this movie. I really liked the way that Christ was portrayed. The scenes were very discriptive, as well as the dialog. Gibson put alot of thought, and time into making sure this film was as real as possible. The scenes showed the public what kind of pain Christ went through for us. Gibson took a big chance with his career by making such a film, But I do not believe anyone could come as close to the real thing as He did.  <br />We sometimes forget what happened on the Cross that day. We get so busy with our selves that the sacrifice is foregotton. This movie opened the eyes of everyone that watched it in some way or another. My hat is off to Mr. Gibson for a job well done. I recommend this movie for anyone who does not believe. By:Allen Bass

B000E0OBK6|4.0|I absolutely loved this movie, for it stands out from the crowd of generic war films and gives you a sense of realism.  Based on Anthony Swofford's memoir, `Jarhead' stays pretty faithful to it's source and delivers a unique movie going experience that thrives on the brilliant performances of it's cast, in particular Gyllenhaal and Sarsgaard.  As Anthony `Swoff' Swofford (Gyllenhaal) learns to adjust to life in the Marines he soon realizes that it's not what he expected it to be.  He doesn't want to be there, he never wanted to be there. <br /> <br />On the other hand Troy (Sarsgaard) struggles with learning his reenlistment has been denied at that he must soon leave.  Troy wants nothing more than to fight, but he fears he'll never get the opportunity to engage in the very thing he's trained so hard for.  Both Gyllenhaal and Sarsgaard put so much into their characters that the fact both were snubbed of Oscar nominations baffles me.  Especially Peter who quickly became the most sympathetic character in the bunch and the one we felt the most pain for. <br /> <br />I've heard this is a very realistic view of what our soldiers go through, a lot of waiting around for something to happen with nothing to do but get close to those around you and pray the ones you left haven't moved on.  It's not your typical war film so don't expect `Saving Private Ryan' or anything like that.  This is a drama about the affect war has on those involved.  The cinematography is astounding, just beautifully shot, and Sam Mendes deserves top notch honors for his brilliant directing.  I'm just really shocked that this movie was overlooked by Oscar. <br /> <br />Jamie Foxx does deliver a nice performance if albeit overshadowed by almost every other actor here, especially the aforementioned as well as Lucas Black who delivers the comedic relief in this film.  Gyllenhaal had a killer year with his Oscar nominated performance in `Brokeback Mountain' as well as `Proof' and with each performance he brought something new and something fresh to the fore.  He's definitely one to watch!
0385474547|5.0|This is a very compelling story of a tribal african man and his family before the onset of colonialism and then how they deal with the infiltration of europeans.  What is unusual is that this book is actually written by an african.  Most fiction that deals with tribal africa is actually written not by africans but by european or american novelists.   <br /> <br />Achebe trys to show the african charecters in a realistic light.  Very flawed but heroic in thier own way.  He does not reduce his africans into victimized but nobel cartoon charecters who embody some mysterious but profound primitive enlightenment that eludes us dense and insensitive westerners.  Instead of showing the christians as some racist and overbearing outsiders he also shows them as flawed but dedicated.   <br /> <br />To be frank I find it a refreshing alternative to all the self-loathing white literature written about Africa.
B000FS9FCQ|3.0|`V' opened to critical acclaim as well as critical controversy.  I never got around to seeing it in the theater, and even after its DVD release it's taken me months to give it a look.  I will say that, while the film is visually engaging, I found myself wondering what all the hype was about.  `V' just never got around to grabbing my interest the way I expected it to, and with all the `Matrix' comparisons I expected a little more in the action department, but the film is sorely lacking in that area as well. <br /> <br />The film circles around a terrorist named V (Hugo Weaving) who is disgusted with the country's current situation.  England is under the rule of Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt) who rules by instilling fear in the eyes of the nation.  V happens upon young Evey (Natalie Portman) who unwillingly becomes his prodigy, but when a close friend is murdered at the hands of the government she becomes a little more willing to help make a statement.   <br /> <br />That's precisely what this movie tries to do, make a statement, but it falls short of a memorable one.  The acting too was a bit of a sore spot.  Yes, Hugo does a fine job, but he had a mask on the entire time so it makes acting a bit easier...the audience has no chance to read your face and know your phony.  Portman to me was a huge disappointment.  She seemed miscast and slightly out of her element.  She showed so much promise with `Closer' that I expected her to really soar here and I was sadly let down. <br /> <br />The action and or directing this movie took are decent, and the few fight and or action sequences are highlights to the film, but they are few as I mentioned, and I expected more of them.  The movie tries really hard to make a point, to have a moral backdrop but it just doesn't come across on the screen.  I've read that Alan Moore (the writer of the graphic novel of which this movie is based) was not pleased with the film.  I've never read his novel, but I can assume (since Hollywood has a really bad problem with this) that it was drastically changed for the big screen.  Either way, I don't really understand all the hype, but this film does have it's supporters.  It's not a bad movie but it's far from the masterpiece some would have you believe!
B000HIVO64|5.0|i haven't listened to Beck in a long time, but this release had me excited fo sho.<br /><br />I generally don't consider myself a fan, but i have to say it is a genuinely gorgeous, cool, and crafty set of songs.<br /><br />Soft and lonely at times, funky and uber electronic at others, it never fails to satisfy.<br /><br />Songs like \\"Think I'm In Love\\" and \\"New Round\\" will inadvertantly (maybe?) pull at your heartstrings, while the sounds of \\"Nausea\\" and \\"No Complaints\\" will transport you to Becks early days, in the best way possible.<br /><br />Theres a definite 80's throwback element as well...\\"Cellphone's Dead\\" is a delicious post-80's nodder that will turn heads as you groove your way to work.<br /><br />Despite my hefty labeling, the songs in general turn out to be an awesome collection of truly modern kickass music. i could say its a massive collage of pop/rock/folk/postmodern/electronic/spoken word, but that would be saying too much and not saying enough at the same time.<br /><br />There are a couple of songs that don't exactly merit this much gusto, but i am genuinely impressed with this album and recommend it 100% to lovers and haters alike.<br /><br />go get it!
B000H7JD4K|5.0|This album is what I've been waiting for since Seventh Son of a Seventh Son. Maiden has put together an album of progression and power. Maiden used to be able to create albums with both epic and progressive songs along with some of the most catchiest songs in metal, but they strayed long ago from what made them great. This album is a return to the inventive heavy metal that made them famous. I really think this is the most progressive album they have ever made! I hope they keep it up, because Maiden should be the best that metal can offer, and they are that with this excellent album.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|I love, love, love Something's Gotta Give.  Diane and Jack are both great, as usual, but Amanda Peet, Keanu Reeves and Frances McDormand rock as well.   <br />If you go to Paris, try the Grand Colbert restaurant seen at the end of the movie.  They really have great roast chicken and you can sit at the \\"Diane-Jack-Keanu\\" table.  Our waiter the night we went was in the movie (the birthday song scene)! <br />To the people who didn't like the end of the movie...I liked Julian too, but Erica ended up with the man she loved.   <br />I highly recommend this movie.
6305662355|5.0|This movie started the martial arts film explosion in the US. Bruce Lee's skills were far above any other martial artist that followed him. It was various derivations from his original ideas for most things that happened later in the martial arts in America. Quoting Dana White of the UFC \\"Bruce started MMA (Mixed Martial Arts).\\" Years before it was figured out. First to teach non-chinese kung fu in the US. First to use real martial artist as villians in fight films. First to do a arm-bar to end a fight on film in the Shaolin Temple no less in this movie! (20 years before UFC.) It was his original idea later turned into the popular television show Kung-Fu.  <br />Anyway, this movie was easily his best film and was his launching pad to post humorous super stardom in the US.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|I have been a fan of MCR from the beginning and I can tell you that they get better and better with each cd. This album just shows their talent through and through. There isn't one song that I don't like. Although Cancer is sort of hard to listen to especially if you have been affected by someone dying of cancer or dying of some fatal disease. They have knocked me off of my feet once again!!!! I encourage anyone that is looking for a good rock cd get this one!!! You will not be disappointed!!!! I have one word for this cd WOW!!!! Great job MCR!!!!! I give this cd 50 stars!!!!!!
B000I5YCCO|5.0|I first met Taylor at CMA Music Fest in June and I was instantly impressed by how sweet and down to earth she was.  Soon after, I heard \\"Tim McGraw\\" on the radio for the first time and was hooked.  I ran out right after work yesterday to pick up the album and only stopped listening to it long enough to sleep last night. <br /> <br />The songs on the album are impressive on their own, but even more so when you consider that Taylor wrote or co-wrote every single one AND she's only 16.  I think I read somewhere that she wrote one of them when she was 12. <br /> <br />The music is honest and well produced, something that I think is rare these days in Nashville.  Vocally, I think Taylor is superior to many of the top female artists out there.  She is the real deal and I think she has a long and brilliant career to look forward to!
B000009PNY|4.0|I'm not really a fan of the band Depeche Mode, and as a general rule tribute albums are a pretty hit and miss affair (the yawn inducing tribute album to Fleetwood Mac's Rumours featuring Jewel, Tonic, and Elton John at their most boring a prime example).  So why do I not only own but thoroughly enjoy this tribute album, featuring artists such as Smashing Pumpkins, God Lives Underwater, Locust, and Rammstein?<br /><br /> It's the lyrics that sell it. These are solid songs, but the fact is the covers are quite simply better than the originals.<br /><br /> The songs that stand out first are the Rammstein cover Stripped, which originally appeared as a bonus track on the album Sehnsucht, and the band Failure whose cover of Enjoy The Silence was a hit on Top 40 during the summer of 1998, but these are not the only good songs on this album.<br /><br /> Others I highly recommend to any potential purchaser of this album include the song Shake The Disease, covered by the band Hooverphonic. Geike Arnaert's delivery on the chorus of the song is way more powerful, to my ears, than the delivery of DM's lead singer Dave Gahan..<br /><br />Here is a plea<br /><br />From my heart to you<br /><br />Nobody knows me<br /><br />As well as you do<br /><br />You know how hard it is for me<br /><br />To shake the disease<br /><br />That takes hold of my tongue<br /><br />In situations like these<br /><br /> The melody is not changed much from the 80s techno the original band is known for, but the Belgian band with it's young female lead singer packs the song with more emotion.<br /><br /> Another selling point is the cover of the song Policy of Truth done here by the band Dishwalla, best known for the line from their one hit Counting Blue Cars, \\"Tell me all your thoughts on God / Cause I'm on my to see Her.\\" Again, the lyrics are better served by another style of music, in this case rock, as opposed to 80s style techno.<br /><br />Its just time to pay the price<br /><br />For not listening to advice<br /><br />And deciding in your youth<br /><br />On the policy of truth<br /><br /> This album is truly a must have for people who like diamonds in that rough known as the pop music section.<br /><br /> Other Good Tribute Albums: Songs From A Material World (George Harrison tribute), Kindred Sprits (Johnny Cash tribute) and Killer Queen (Queen tribute).he policy of truth <br /> <br /> This album is truly a must have for people who like diamonds in that rough known as the pop music section. <br /> Other Good Tribute Albums: Songs From A Material World (George Harrison tribute), Kindred Sprits (Johnny Cash tribute) and Killer Queen (Queen tribute). <br />
006097625X|5.0|This book is about so much more than comics. It's packed with insight about the psychology of perception, the evolution of pictoral and verbal communications, and all kinds of goodies.<br /><br />The one that got me was the concept of filling in what happens \\"in the gutter.\\" That's the space between frames where the imagination works. This is a powerful way to understand some of what takes place in group sequential communication too. It applies to the sense or nonsense people make of forum discussions sometimes, for example. That non-existant content in the \\"gutter\\" between posts can grab people by the emotions.<br /><br />In addition, it is beautifully drawn and includes lots of visual vocabulary you didn't know you needed.  Wonderful gift for anyone interested in communication, design or illustration, let alone in comics!
B000I5Y8ZU|4.0|The album is a solid performer, but once you blow past all the hype its obvious that its hardly MCR's masterpiece. While the album concept is promising, the band seems to be struggling along towards the finish line. MCR has chosen to follow the pop curve, and this album is a definite departure from the brash and edgy \\"Three Cheers.\\" Fear not rockers, its still one of the better albums Ive heard this year. \\"Welcome to the Black Parade\\" is the highlight track, and one of the decidedly unique songs on the disc. Unfortunately those strong songs are at the mercy of a few that suffer from similarity, slowing the overall pace (didnt I already hear this one?). The featured version of \\"Cancer\\" (a lyrically beautiful ballad) is overwhelmed by overproduction, and looses the lustre of the raw and simplistic live version. There are obvious musical references to quite a few bands (Queen, Aerosmith, Green Day), some of them on the verge of infringement (\\"The End\\" bears too strong a resemblance to Pink Floyd's \\"In The Flesh\\" for mere coincidence). Despite having \\"borrowed\\" so much from so many, the album still stands up well, and the vast majority shouldnt mind cuddling up a bit (the artwork and packaging alone should impress many). Worth my money? Absolutely. MCR's definitive album? Hardly. One things for sure, I cant wait to see where the band goes next.
0307275639|5.0|The intention of the author, Mitch Albom, for writing the book to help pay Morrie's medical debt is an overwhelming act of human kindness to begin with. His writing style was unique and interesting. He depicted the human as well as the spiritual part of Morrie. The last paragraph in the book tells it best: The last class of my old professor's life took place once a week, in his home, by a window in his study where he could watch a small hibiscus plant shed its pink flowers. The class met on Tuesdays. No books were required. The subject was the meaning of life. It was taught from experience. The teaching goes on.

B000FP2OPY|5.0|I just started watching Supernatural Season 2 and was immediately hooked! I look forward to Thursday nights every week anticipating the next episode. Both actors are wonderful and great to watch, not to mention quite handsome, too. I remembered Jensen Ackles from Days of Our Lives and Jared Padalecki from House of Wax.  I also absolutely love Charmed, so this fits in perfectly since Charmed has ended. I finally ordered Season 1 and can't wait til it comes.  I will enjoy my nights watching them over and over and over again!! I love magic and \\"scary stuff\\"! Already wanting Season 2 out.  Can ya tell I'm a big fan of their show now? Supernatural totally rocks!!! It's to die for! Absolutely superb! I'm watching this when I should be doing classwork, but oh well. Rock on!!
B000001ABD|3.0|Stevie Wonder... A WONDERFUL musician and singer!  If you're planning to have all your SW LPs and singles collection on CD, start with this album. The magic of Stevie Wonder's music is forever!
B000026OHN|2.0|Sviatoslav Richter brings his superb technique and penetrating musical intelligence to bear on the WTC and the result may not please scholars but it is deeply enjoyable (which is probably what Bach had in mind).  Unfortunately the sound on these recordings is abominable.  After listening for more than a couple of minutes I give up.  I think it is the fault of the original recording in an over reverberant acoustic but there is a constant \\"aura\\" which really gets in the way.  There is a far better and consistently more exciting version recorded in Innsbruck in the early 70s but it is only available in a CD version on \\"Polo\\" which is published in China.  Presumably RCA Victor has problems with the dissemination of this version in the West!  It's not a perfect recording by any means but it is far more listenable. <br /> <br />
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|My wife and I were discussing old movies we'd seen when we were younger and this one popped up in the conversation.  It was one of those \\"Oh!...THAT movie...!\\" moments because both of us remember it as being very creepy - totally opposite of the Wizard of Oz movie.<br /><br />So we ordered it and gave it a watch.  It was a lot of fun to see the various things that frightened us as kids.  Now as adults we paid closer attention to the way the movie was put together.  Surprisingly the characters and effects are still impressive.  From the way Tik-Tok and Jack Pumpkinhead move around (and Jack has a nice squash-n-stretch movement to his head which is very cool) to the technically impressive stop-motion animation of the Nome King and his rock spies.<br /><br />Also, we never realized before that this was Fairuza Balk's film debut.<br /><br />I couldn't help but hear her telling Mombi \\"I hope you like what I did to yo lawn-mowa.\\" (Waterboy)
B000001EGA|5.0|It's 2006 and people are still writing reviews of this LP?  UNBELIEVABLE!  It really demonstrates it's shear star power.  I am black and I've been a fan since Bennie & The Jets.  All of the songs here were catchy, even the country-tinged \\"Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy\\".  He couldn't have given it a better title track.  Even the artistic cover was the bomb.  I listened to my Elton John ballads compilation so much that my son, now 25, is an Elton fan, and it definitely includes \\"Someone Save My Life Tonight\\" and \\"Curtains\\".  It's something about the melodies and that awesome beat in his ballads that keeps your head rocking, with maybe a tear or two in your eyes.  I haven't even purchased his latest because I felt that he lost the melodies and the beat after \\"Empty Garden\\", however, after reading all of the 5-star reviews regarding the follow-up to captain fantastic, I plan to purchase it soon.  My compilation is simply entitled \\"Captain Fantastic\\" and contains in my opinion, the most beautiful songs ever created - Rocket Man, Candle In The Wind, High Flying Bird, Harmony, I Feel Like A Bullet, Daniel, Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me, Love Song, Satorial Elequence, and if you missed this one, you had better get it, \\"When I Think About Love\\" a duet with PM Dawn.  I've turned more black people on to these Elton songs and have received much love from whites who were shocked that I had them in my collection.  For those reasons Elton has made my life that much richer since the moment I purchased Goodbye Yellow Brick Road for \\"Candle In The Wind\\", Harmony, Benny & The Jets and the title song.  Rock on Elton.  Just don't do that rap cd that I've been hearing about. <br /> <br />To the person who gave this cd 2 stars, just take a look at how many 5-star ratings it received and then ask yourself \\"why am I in the minority?\\" <br />
B000002BYA|5.0|This album has really grown on me with repeated listenings. One of the reasons why I have come to appreciate this album so much is that it really catches the band at their peak.  The album is broken up into two format: the first half finds just the core three piece band, the second half includes an extended band with firends and Room Full of Blues horn section. For me, SRV didn't get any better then the original tight trio They are still the tight trio that put out 'Texas Flood' and it's the only place in the catalog to find SRV in this format and man is it gooood. The second half is a great addition for any SRV fan and this half has really grown on me. The horns and guest stars (including his brother)has a really different sound\groove then any other SRV album. Dirty Pool is fanastic with the horns. My only wish is the both sides were longer.  I    If you enjoy Stevie's early work you will enjoy this album. If you enjoy Stevie live, you will enjoy this album.  If you have been a long time SRV fan and don't have this album in your collection you need to buy it now.  This is a great and surprisely different album from the greatest guitarist to have ever lived.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|First I have to say that like in other reviews, The Black Parade is probably the BEST ROCK ALBUM OF THE YEAR! I've been listening to MCR since their first CD and The Black Parade is nothing in comparison. Its an almost completely different sound but in a very good way. The album sound draws inspiration from The Beatles Sgt. Peppers, Queen's Night At The Opera, & Pink Floyds The Wall. The songs are amazing. Some of the best ones are Dead!, I Don't Love You, Welcome To The Black Parade, House of Wolves, Disenchanted, & Famous Last Words. My Chemical Romance just keeps getting better and better. Anyone who listens to rock/punk MUST HAVE this album. It's truly the best album of the year in my opinion. The Black Parade is DEFINETLY  10+ stars! Hands Down.
B000A0GYD2|1.0|In previous reviews the aspect ratio of this DVD set is often mentioned. I have to agree with those reviewers who state that the aspect ratio is wrong. It may be true that the series was shot in 16:9 and I remember seeing it that way on Belgium TV, but this is not that version! When watching these DVDs it very soon becomes clear that something is wrong: the top of people's heads are frequently cut off, sometimes an action that takes place at the bottom of the screen is not visible. I also own the Dutch DVD-set of this great series which has 4:3 aspect ratio, no extras but very cheap, less than $10,00. Comparison showed that the Signature Editon used the 4:3 version and chopped off the upper and lower part to get a 16:9 version. Again, if the series was originally shot in 16:9 than this is not that version! Shame on you HBO for passing this chopped up version of a brilliant series as an expensive so called Special Edition!
B000IOF2B0|5.0|This is one of the best of its' genre. I am amazed that nobody has written a review of this one yet.<br /><br />I would love to read more like this one. The ending is totally unpredictable and unforgettable.<br /><br />It has the uncanny ability to make you question your own sanity!
0793563836|5.0|3 and a half months after buying this book, along with the cheapest bass and amp I could find, I've finally worked through it all.  At this point it is fairly easy for me to pick up a rock song, from Cream to Judas Priest to Ozzy.  R&B (Jamerson) and Funk (JB and rock-like Chili Peppers) are still difficult but I find them at least approachable after this book.  It was a great place to start for someone with a little bit of music background (20 years ago as a kid I took piano lessons) and a love for grooving.  I highly recommend this book.  Hint:  After getting to the third section, find a teacher to help on the more cerebral parts of picking out a bass line just from from the chord progression.
B000301YY8|5.0|James Blunt is simply an amazing artist.  Any musician that is willing to put their heart and personal emotions out for the world to hear earns my respect.  Isn't that what so many people love about listening to music - hearing someone else so clearly express the pain or love that we are feeling, too? <br /> <br />Unless you recently spent time with your head in the sand you have most likely heard \\"You're Beautiful\\" and you either love it or hate it.  Oddly enough, I hated it at first.  But, since it was a hard song to get away from this year I started realizing that what I didn't like was simply the fact that his style was so unusual.  As I really paid attention to the words and the beautiful simplicity of the arangement I became just as entranced as the other half of the nation.  So, I bought the CD. <br /> <br />This has quickly become one of my absolute favorite albums.  He can be compared loosely to John Mayer in that his music has a distinctive, unusual quality that is entirely his yet threaded through every song.  Some criticize for that; I simply respect it as style.  Some people have artistic strength in diversity - some in focus.  I love every song on the CD except for Wisemen - but others like that one a lot so buying the CD can't be a bad bet.   <br /> <br />If you want to sample a few try: You're Beautiful, Goodbye My Lover and Tears & Rain.  This is one of those CD's you can let play and not have to worry about fussing with it since every song is terrific.  The DVD of him playing this album live is also amazing.  There you will hear more of the story behind the songs and see he is an artist that performs just as well live as when produced... something missing in some of today's \\"top artists.\\"
B000E1YVZU|5.0|I borrowed this movie for the first time a few weeks ago and after reading the reviews about it, I wasn't quite sure how I would feel about it. After watching it, I have to say that I LOVE this movie and bought it the next day. Regardless of what critics have written, I loved that they were able to get most of the original cast members to play the roles that made RENT a success. Yes, they are supposed to be in their 20's in the play but really, I barely noticed or frankly, could've cared less.  I love Jesse L. Martin and he was fantastic. Idina Menzel's voice is super and was ever surprised that Rosario Dawson could sing. Anthony Rapp, Adam Pascal, Wilson Jermaine Heredia and Tracie Thoms were great as well. Yes they changed and omitted things that are in the Broadway play, but if you are truelly a fan of RENT, you will overlook that and just enjoy the one thing that is always present: the wonderful songs!
B00000IL1K|5.0|There is no question that Sarah Brightman is amazingly talented.  But, her music is not as widespread as her talent deserves simply because she is so unique.  If you are new to her music and pick one of her purely classical tracks you may be scared off.  However, there are two aboslute gems on this CD that most anyone can appreciate. <br /> <br />I have to start with the ethereal \\"Deliver Me.\\"  WOW.  The emotion and depth in that song is so painful and so beautiful.  I like it best played so loud that there is no room for other thought or emotion. Her words convey such a basal message that most everyone can relate to it for one reason or another.  Admittedly, the incredible music and unmatchable voice help it to be such a masterpiece.  The other favorite is \\"Eden.\\"  Again, the instruments melded with her voice create a song that you simply want to melt into.  There are other great songs, but those two are worth the purchase of the CD, themselves.
0596007124|5.0|This is the first time ever I have written a review on any book,not because I am too arrogant or anything like that, just because i am lazy!!always thought there are already tons of reviews over there,probably doesn't need one more review like mine!! I just can't resist on writing one after i bought this book two days ago, and have kept on reading for two days. the reasons,  <br /> <br />I have struggled for quite a while to have a grasp of what pattern are and then, above all, how to apply to my coding. I read original GOF books, well, I have to say, maybe too good to use in real life!!  i read Martin fowler's book, examples just snippet. <br /> <br />every example in this book is put in context, and very well explained the upside and downside why the pattern should be used. I feel I am enlightened in design even before i finish the book. not kept in dark, or guess which pattern is better in my coding, now i understand, why which pattern is better. <br /> <br />I can't stand that some guys give this book one star,or three stars. I went out of my way to read their view, one guy compaint of no introdution to java as examples are written in java. My advice is this book is about design pattern, not about learn a certain language, by reading this book to learn java, u r missing the point!!  another guy whinges this book does't look like a technical book, what's wrong with some jokes or cross words. u can read original GOF book, i really doubt how many people really understand what the book is talking about after the first one or two shots.  <br /> <br />this book deserves 6 stars. i recommend anybody interested in design pattern should buy this book. conditions apply, except you are a guru in design, i mean a real guru, not somebody knowing tweaking code to get their goal!! <br /> <br />
B000I2JKCO|5.0|THE POLAR EXPRESS is an archtypal story of doubt, discovery, and belief.  The tale of the boy who doubted the existence of Santa Claus stands out as one of the better holiday offerings.  Picked up in front of his house by a magic train on Christmas Eve, the boy experiences a thrill-a-minute journey to the North Pole where he gets to meet Santa and learn how powerful belief is.<br /><br />Based on a book by Chris Van Allsburg, who also gave us the books JUMANJI and ZATHURA which were later turned into successful movies, THE POLAR EXPRESS was given vibrant life by Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks.  Like SHREK, the book was only 32 pages, but somehow had enough story content and a world big enough to sustain a feature-length movie.<br /><br />THE POLAR EXPRESS is going to be shown around the holidays for years to come.  I grew up with the stop-motion television shows about Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and Frosty the Snowman and thought those movies would never be topped.  Of course, back then I had no clue that even Walt Disney's magical studios could pull off a cartoon movie (in this case, though, computer-generated) so well done.  Tom Hanks's portrayal of the Conductor is spot-on, and he does several other voices as well, including that of Santa Claus.<br /><br />One of the best things about the movie is the beginning journey, when the Boy is exploring the train and meeting the people aboard it.  The hobo/snow ghost is amazing.  The out-of-control train sliding across the ice, then trying desperately to escape ahead of the breaking ice, is a real nail-biter.  The visual effects are stunning and beautiful to look at.<br /><br />If you haven't seen THE POLAR EXPRESS, you're in for a treat.  This HD DVD edition puts all of the special features at your fingertips on one disc.
B000H305U0|5.0|Some people are just haters.  This album is hot.  The production is great and you can hear definite influence to 80s music with reference to a lot of Prince, The Time, and whoever sang that song \\"Another One Bites the Dust\\".  Anyways, you can put this in and listen to the whole thing straight through.  Highly recommend it.
B000HCO83Q|5.0|I've watched it a few times now. Great plot, fantastic effects, but so far I have counted over 20 continuity errors, some major, some minor.<br /><br />Here's some samples: When Magneto and the doc are confronting Phoenix and it all hits the fan, the sliding doors are open. Next cut they are closed, and for the remainder of the scene. Yet when Wolfy is crawling along the ceiling towards the doors, they are open, close, open, closed.  Really sloppy editing there!<br /><br />When Magneto moves the bridge, it's the middle of the day. When the bridge hits land, minutes later, it's night.  All the vehicles were abandoned (except one) and tossed around like crazy, especially when Magneto clears the path through the cars.  Yet whenever we see the same section of bridge in distance shots..... 1) all the cars are in nice, neat rows. 2) All the car's headlights lights are on.  Neither is possible in the context of the movie, even ignoring the fact that day became night in under 5 minutes.<br /><br />Logan gets two gut injuries from the horn tossin' dude.  He heals. So does his t-shirt - because in the next scene, the holes are missing.<br /><br />When Logan is getting abused by Magneto at Alcatraz, he switches position between cuts. While lying down. While pinned.<br /><br />The section of bridge broken away would not span the gap from the mainland to the island.<br /><br />Those are my favorites.  Can you find the rest?
B000002UB6|5.0|Review number 340. Yet, another classic rock album I haven't heard in eons. This was,obviously the Fab Four's final 'actual' lp, put out in 1970. Remember fans all over being HEAVILY depressed after hearing about the Beatles break-up. As far as I'm concerned, 'Let It Be' was the perfect swan song for these superstar Brit rockers. Remember most of the tracks here, especially \\"Dig A Pony\\", the title cut \\"Let It Be\\", \\"I've Got A Feeling\\", the impressive \\"The Long And Winding Road\\" and my personal favorite of this CD reissue \\"Get Back\\". Also really like the way Sir Paul McCartney performs this gem while out on his solo tours. Highly recommended.
B00005JPB4|3.0|I love Clint Eastwood and his movies, but this one missed the mark for me. There were some nice moments scattered throughout, but the acting, and the way they edited the back and forth storyline just weren't as strong as I would have liked. The battle scenes were pretty good (though not even close to Saving Private Ryan) as was the directing. For a short war film at around two hours, it felt longer than Saving Private Ryan. This is not even close to being a bad film, but it is one that I should have waited for on DVD.
B00005JP8V|5.0|I give 5 stars to this movie not because it is the best movie I've ever seen, but because I enjoyed the movie good enough, because I fell in love with the beautiful cast (I can't wait to get the DVD), because the simply plot was well done, nice visual effects, and the most important: I was not bored to death like many movies taking too long to develope a drama.  I know, it won't win any Oscar, but It won a place in my DVD collection.  I hope they make a 2nd part, same cast with more action, maybe some drama?  oops I forgot, I loved the scenography used here, the house like old mansion was great gave a lot of spirit to the movie, the old barns were spooky.  Also there were used many dark blue/green outside shots, tons of dark clouds, heavy rain and fog, they gave an interesting ambient to this film.  Me and my friends totally enjoyed this movie, and want to see it again.
184195392X|5.0|Although many people talk about the spiritual aspects of this novel, I ended up with a lot of food for thought about humans and their relationship with animals.  I enjoyed Pi, but would not run out and beg people to read it.  The prose, however, is quite seamless and at times very beautiful. <br /> <br />The ending is intriguing, the question of course being Which version of the story is true?  I am surprised that some readers prefer the more violent tale told by Pi and wonder what this says about us as people.  Are we more likely to believe a horrible, painful story than a more lyrical one?
0446677450|5.0|I thought was great.  It is educational because it helps a person to focus on becoming rich.  I also think that alot of people can relate to how he grew up. <br />I also recommend reading his advisor series books; namely Owning your Corporation and in addition Think Like a Billionaire Become a Billionaire by Scot Anderson is a great book as well. <br />
0385512058|5.0|I feel obliged to share my review of this book.  I got hold of it by chance and what luck! Like a lot of people I know the value of building relationships, because most of the best business I've had have been from by circle of contacts.  However, I cringe at the concept of \\"networking\\" and fail miserably at trying to leverage my network.  This book however got me to understand the DIFFERENCE between networking and relationship building.  I won't spoil it for you, but once you read the book and understand the difference you will immediately change you view of building relationships that unimaginably augment your financial, professional, social and philantropic efforts. <br /> <br />Do yourself a favour and buy this book!!
B0006A9FMI|2.0|I'm amazed that the US still has to put up with this half baked rush release, If you want the fully realised package with English sound track from the usual cast then get the region two version ISBN B000BY9ALU. OK so it'll probably cost you twice as much and you'll need a multi region player. But for something this good why put up with second best. <br />This is one of those films where the brain really needs to be turned on, as treating it like a popcorn movie will leave you dazed and confused. It continues the theme from GITS 1 querying the boundaries between man and machine and the dangers of ghost hacking. At times it gets a touch pretentious with Batou and Togusa swapping obscure quotations, but it is both beautiful and thought provoking. <br /> <br />Again a split review 5 for the film, 2 for the slipshod DVD release.
B000FFJ85I|5.0|I have been a fan of AFI since the early days, December Underground is the best whole album I have heard from any band in years. The progression leading up to this album is amazing and is uncharacteristic of many bands today. Being active in the music industry I can honestly say this album is an anomaly in what is largely unoriginal monotonous main stream music today.
B000009ED0|1.0|Please change your name to (KID RAP)..  When you start producing true ROCK cd's then and only then you should put rock back into your fake name...  Stop playing both sides..  I realize that the rap- hip hop scene is much easier because over half the fan base is little girls /boys and people that dont have a clue what music is all about..  <br />Do yourself a favor and take the rap/hip hop out of your so called music. One day you will realize that the rap/hip hop scene is like a bad smell that real music fans hate and wish would go away..    <br />
B000GFLE86|5.0|I'm a big fan of Madeleine and have lover her past albums, but this one is my favorite.  She has a soothing, controlled voice-no screeching just to prove she can hit a high note.  Currently her, Nora Jones, and Brandi Carlile are my favorite female singers.  My only complaint is that I wish she would release albums more often and with more original songs!
0446677450|1.0|As usual, with most \\"financial help\\" (read get rich quick) books, there is little specific information. Just vague, general advice that a monkey could have written. I was recommended this book by someone whose intelligence I have since re-evaluated. The author gives some basic advice about how assets can generate wealth but then there is a huge gap to the next part where he says \\"oh, now I am so rich I do not have to work...\\" And, as usual, he suggest you buy the next book to get more specifics. Sound like a dodgy pyramid scheme????
0060935464|5.0|I think I was suppsoed to read this book in High School and I either didn't or i watched the movie instead. Either way, I am glad I finally did.  This book is one of the best ever written.  It makes me sad to think that so many people have not and will not read it.  Harper Lee was ahead of her time in so many ways.  Buy this book. Read it now. Go!
B000001EAQ|5.0|As many reviewers have noted, this album was not well recieived when it was first released back in 1997.  However, with the passing of almost ten years and with the band's return to a more melodic style, this album can now be seen as a fitting and ingenious culmination to a period of musical innovation and experimentation that very few bands will ever experience.  I know that all of the U2 haters out there will disagree with me.  But, if you ever get the chance, take the time to sit down and listen to The Joshua Tree, Rattle and Hum, Achtung Baby, Zooropa and Pop uninterrupted and in that order.  The musical and cultural evolution the band experiences over the course of these albums is amazing. <br /> <br />Pop itself is a musically and lyrically brilliant.  It is not as accessible as many other U2 albums but grows on you as you listen to it.  For me, the album's highlights are too numerous to mention.  I simply recommend that you go out and buy it.
B000E1MTY0|5.0|The title says it all.  While I liked some of the others, this is the only one I bought on DVD and now HD DVD.  The picture quality is stunning.  This also has the Dolby True HD soundtrack (need to upgrade to version 2.0 firmware on the Toshiba A1 to play it), but frankly I could not tell the difference between it and Dolby Digital Plus.  But either is a noticeable improvment over Dolby Digital.  This is one of the must-have titles in HD DVD.
B000F39MAQ|5.0|This opera is so 'real'! I think that it is an astonishing achievement to be able to make opera so vivid. It is 'alive'. The formalities and stiffness are all melted into 'today's' world. No soul can watch it without loosing the line between imagination and reality. I would categorize it as an evolution in opera productions. Anna Netrebko is injecting a revolutionary approach to opera. It involves a genius to turn the opera into the new dimension. I am absolutely astonished by the 'realism'. 5 stars are not enough! <br />It takes a visionary to understand that this performance. When Tchaikovsky played his First concerto for the first time, he was laughed at. It is not for everybody to see through the eyes of the `establishment' how genius this production is. <br />
B00005JPBP|5.0|Abrakadabra.  The Prestige is why I continue to enjoy going to the movies.  Every once and awhile you get something unique and surprising and it makes it all worthwhile.  A story of two 19th Century magician's (nicely played by Hugh Jackman & Christian Bale) whose bitter rivalry is founded in a tragedy allows Christopher Nolan to do some movie prestidigitation as well, telling his tale cutting back and forth between the two men while moving forward and backward in time as well.      The film offers nicely rendered period detail of London and Colorado Springs, combines a bit of lore (the magician's three acts of The Pledge, The Turn and The Prestige), a bit of history (the rivalry of Thomas Edison and Nikolai Tesla) a bit of intrigue, a bit of mystery and more.  It is complex but comprehensible if you're paying attention.  In fact it demands your attention as any good illusion does.    With this as it's frame, the Nolan brothers explore the meaning and nuances of indentity, technical competence versus showmanship and presentation (Bordin & Argien, Tesla & Edison), and the creative value of obsession and the price paid for indulging one's obsessions, and, of course, the fascination of magic, that most theatrical manipulation of truth and illusion.  A bit of movie magic here, I found The Prestige intriguing and mesmerizing, much like a first rate feat of legerdemain, clever and original.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|For all the MCR fans who loved \\"Three Cheers\\" and nothing else, I'm not sure what you will think of this album. <br /> <br />That being said I think if you give this album time, it will grow on you.  That doesn't mean it isn't really good already, but some tracks are a little different this time around and really take a couple of good listen throughs to really enjoy them.   <br /> <br />I have to say that my favorites, besides their single \\"The Black Parade\\", are: <br /> <br /> \\"The Sharpest Lives\\" -- 5 out of 5.  Just a great song and really shows Gerard's lyric writing ability.  Trust me, this track is good, just read the lyrics. <br /> <br />\\"This is How I Disappear\\" -- 5 out of 5.  Great song.  If you liked \\"Three Cheers\\" you will like this track and \\"The Sharpest Lives\\". <br /> <br />\\"House of Wolves\\"  -- 4 out of 5.  Good track, and has a good beat.  I just don't know if everyone would really like it, but that's just my opinion. <br /> <br />\\"Dead!\\" -- 4 out of 5.  Good song and has good lyrics.  I don't really like the end, as it sounds like a sing-a-long, but besides that... <br /> <br />Songs that I personally don't like so far: <br /> <br />\\"Cancer\\"  -- 1 out of 5.  Sorry but a Ballad by MCR is just not my kind of thing.  I understand the point of the album is to take you on a journey, but please...anywhere but the late 80's.  I just really don't like this track. <br /> <br />\\"Disenchanted\\"  -- 2 out of 5. Just doesn't work for me.  Feels a little tacked on and doesn't really sound like it was meant for this album. <br /> <br />\\"Teenagers\\" -- 3.5 out of 5.  I like this song, but it sounds way way too contrived and catchy, like it was meant to be a sell out song.  It kinda reminds me of Offspring when they made \\"Americana\\" and their songs had a funny, but not all there vibe, if that makes any sense. <br /> <br /> <br />Overall:  5 out of 5.  If you like MCR and give this album time, it will grow on you.  Like I said, the songs I don't like that much are just a day after listening to it.  It's just a different kind of album that you have to sit down and listen to, to really determine if you like it.
B0002WZTOI|5.0|Tom Cruise stars in this 80s blockbuster about navy fighter pilots and the Top Gun flight school in Miramar, California. <br /> <br />Cruise stars as Pete \\"Maverick\\" Mitchell.  He and his navigator, Goose (Anthony Edwards) have been sent to Top Gun to learn the lost art of aerial dogfighting.  They will be going up against the best of the best, as only 1% of navy pilots qualify for Top Gun.  Top Gun is commanded by Viper (Tom Skerritt) and Jester (Michael Ironside); two former combat pilots who have returned as instructors. <br /> <br />Once there, Maverick and Goose find themselves up against some other very good pilots; but one stands out above the rest: Iceman (Val Kilmer).  Ice and his navigator Slider (Rick Rossovich) have their sights set on winning the coveted Top Gun trophy, but Mav and Goose intend to win as well.  A strong rivalry has been born; Ice and his by-the-book mentality versus Mav and his edge-of-the-envelope style.   <br /> <br />Another person is also working at Top Gun.  Charlie (Kelly McGillis) is a civilian contractor who represents the Pentagon.  She reports to them on matters involving the Top Gun pilots.  Mav and Goose see her in a bar and sing \\"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin\\" to her, but at that time, they don't know who she is.  Mav immediately is attracted to her.  He is shocked to see her walk into class on base the next day.  Undeterred, he begins his pursuit, even though Charlie says she doesn't date students. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, the competition for the Top Gun trophy has begun, and Ice and Maverick quickly establish themselves as the top two contenders for the title.  There are lots of different aerial combat sequences. <br /> <br />About halfway through their training, Goose's wife (Meg Ryan) and young son come for a visit.  Maverick and Charlie have become very close by this time, and all of them go out together.  However, during one of their training missions, Maverick and Goose are involved in an accident and are forced to bail out of their plane.  Goose doesn't survive.  After the accident, Maverick loses his edge, blaming himself for Goose's death, even though he is cleared of any wrong-doing by a court of inquiry.  He leaves the Top Gun program. <br /> <br />However, Charlie finds him at the airport and talks to him.  Afterward, he visits Viper at his house and Viper tells him about his father and how he flew with his father in Vietnam.  Originally thought to have been a deserter, Viper tells Maverick that he in fact saved three other planes in combat before dying himself.  Mav decides to go back and graduate with his Top Gun class.  After graduation, Iceman, Slider, Maverick, Hollywood (Whip Hubley) and Wolfman (Barry Tubb) are sent to the Persian Gulf to protect a disabled ship that has drifted into foreign waters.  Tensions are high and confrontation is likely.  Will Maverick be able to put aside his memories of Goose and fight, or will Iceman and Slider be left to fend for themselves? <br /> <br />This is the movie that launched Tom Cruise to superstar status.  He does an excellent job as Maverick.  Anthony Edwards, Val Kilmer, Tom Skerritt, Michael Ironside, Kelly McGillis, and the rest of the cast give fine performances as well.  The story is well-conceived, and the action sequences are exciting to watch.   <br /> <br />I give this movie my highest recommendation.  It has remained popular for 20 years, and it never gets old.  Watch \\"Top Gun\\" and see the navy's best pilots in action.
B000002J1L|4.0|After two uncharacteristically folky and unfocused outings (that nonetheless contained some shining moments of brilliance, such as \\"The Knife\\"), Genesis found their sound on 1971's Nursery Cryme. Dramatic, epic, complex music that could be both breathtaking in poeticism or in energy (\\"The Musical Box,\\" \\"The Fountain of Salmacis,\\" especially), as well as humorous and witty (\\"The Return of the Giant Hogweed,\\" \\"Harold the Barrel\\"), this album may still be slightly unfocused as compared to its stone-cold classic follow-ups, but this is the first Genesis album to truly give any hint as to how special the band was. <br /> <br />The aforementioned four songs are the true classics here. \\"The Musical Box\\" is purely stunning, showing the band's mastery of dynamic shifts, as well as Peter Gabriel's flair for theatrics and Steve Hackett's excellent guitar work. \\"The Fountain of Salmacis,\\" is, in my opinion, the best track here. Not only does it relate the tale of Hermaphroditus and Salmacis with astonishingly accomplished, poetic lyrics, but the music matches it note for note, following the emotional arc of the tale throughout. It's prog-rock at its most brilliant, pure and simple. \\"The Return of the Giant Hogweed\\" is probably the most \\"rock\\" piece here. Sly lyrics about the hogweed plant's invasion abound here (hogweed was an introduced species of plant that overran native English flora around that time) are amusing enough - it must be said, however, that the song owes a great deal of its success to its strong musical backing. \\"Harold the Barrel\\" continues in that same vein, relating a humorous, somewhat tragic tale, told in turn by a series of about ten or eleven separate characters, all in the course of around three minutes. The only drawback is that Peter Gabriel has trouble making clear the distinction between characters. No matter - it's a funny little song with a truly wonderful ending that is not to be missed. <br /> <br />Genesis had not fully developed by this time, and the one area that they were lacking in was the ballads. Not that Nursery Cryme's slower tunes are bad, they're just...unmemorable, in most cases. \\"For Absent Friends\\" is a short little piece, which is remembered primarily for having Phil Collins sing lead for the first time in Genesis history. Pleasant enough, but not stunning - really, it's just a moment to catch one's breath after \\"The Musical Box\\" reaches its heart-stopping conclusion. \\"Seven Stones\\" and \\"Harlequin\\" are merely okay - folky ballads that have nice, but unmemorable melodies and lyrics. Sandwiched as they are between more exciting, developed, and energetic pieces, they are easily forgotten, but they are certainly listenable. <br /> <br />All in all, the classics on Nursery Cryme carry the album, but it's truly a solid offering. Foxtrot, Selling England by the Pound, The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, and A Trick of the Tail are all superior albums, but this is a worthy work, and it is rendered essential by the inclusion of some of the band's classics - \\"The Musical Box\\" and \\"The Fountain of Salmacis, in particular.
B000I5YCCO|5.0|This album is not only amazing because of the vocals, but the instruments and lyrics take their soar on each song. Every song is unique in its own way and shows Taylor's maturity as well as her sense on the world and life. No track on here is skipable because it is well arranged. Also, in my time of buying cds I have never come across a cd where you can decode hidden messages from Taylor Swift about each song;very unique in itself. Here are some reviews for the songs: <br /> <br />1)Tim McGraw-10/5. (1st single) Talks about how music can tell experiences/stories of your life. <br />2)Picture to Burn- 10/5. About a jerk guy that believes that he can just walk into Taylor's life whenever he wants to, but Taylor is telling him that she won't have that. Love the whole vengence and scornful sound of her voice and the lyrics <br />3)Teardrops on my Guitar-10/5. About a guy that Taylor misses and she is describing him, his new love, and her feelings of loneliness. You really feel the sadness and heartbreak of her voice <br />4)A Place in This World-10/5. About finding your place in the world and its difficulties, but in the end you will find yourself, just as Taylor did. <br />5)Cold As You-5/5. A broken relationship. <br />6)The Outside-10/5.About being on the outside when all you want to do is be in the inside. Deeper meaning of getting to know someone instead of just knowing about what they show, you should get to know them more deeper like Taylor wants to. <br />7)Tied Together With a Smile-10/5.About feeling alone and not having a lot of self esteem, but Taylor is telling you that you need to feel stronger about yourself and not care what others think. <br />8)Stay Beautiful-10/5.About this guy who Taylor describes as beautiful inside and out and everyone wants him. But even though he may not get with Taylor, she still wishes him to stay the same way. <br />9)Should've Said No-7/5. A guy wants Taylor back and she's telling him no way because he should have said no andthought about their relationship before he defiled the relationship. <br />10)Mary's Song(Oh My My My)-100000/5. Can anything be better than this song? Explains a phase of love for a couple that was actually based on Taylor's neighbors.  <br />11)Our Song-10/5.Every relationship have a song, yet this couple does not and so the girls lover tells her that their song is their love and everything that envolves being together. Love is the everlasting song of every lover. <br /> <br />So all in all the album is a great addition to any album collection. She writes every song on this album and so this gives more accredidation to her resume as an artist. So give it a try!!! :D
B000GFLAI0|4.0|Bob Dylan re-ignited my interest in his music with Things Have Changed, a kitchen-sinkful of cliché he somehow turned into a really memorable R&B number I first heard on the sound track of the Michael Douglas film Wonder Boys (2000). Still, it wasn't until Modern Times released this summer that keeping an eye on his current projects paid off.  <br />First, spending the better part of an hour with any solo artist can challenge the human need for variety. Dylan has always been especially challenging this way. Fortunately, age is having its way with the voice, in this case softening it, and this album is the most listenable in a long time. Then there's the writing, always his long suit, and which now displays the sort of wisdom only an avalanche of years, and an equivalent amount of troubled living, can produce. About halfway through, you ask yourself, could Dylan have contracted the Blues? A while later you know the answer is yes, and for the most part, it's great stuff. <br />Bob Dylan has always been a philosopher of sorts, and here his talent for turning meaningful phrases makes for terrific lyrics. Too bad the superior verses are too often grafted into covers of once-upon-a-time favorites from the forties, fifties and sixties, cause that's the only thing that stops this album short of greatness. <br />Art Tirrell, author of \\"The Secret Ever Keeps\\" ISBN 978-1-60164-004-8, coming March 2007 from Kunati. <br />   <br />
B000FTWB7G|3.0|This does not sound like Fallen, and that is a good thing. Who wants a band to release the same album over and over?    Given that, this album is not that good. There seems to be no restraining influence on Amy's lyrics, and they devolve into schlock too often. A 12 year old girl might find them deep though. While he was not that good of a guitar player, Ben Moody is great at arranging a song. This album misses him greatly. Amy needs someone at her side and despite her claims in the liner notes, she doesn't have one anymore. Perhaps her comments were meant to take blame off her. Who knows?    There is little melody or passion in this release. The songs aren't bad though, it is just not good enough to compete as a worthy successor to fallen or as a contender to album of the year.    No, this is not a goth record. So what? Goths are conformists who aren't bright enough to realize it. The title Goth is an insult to all intelligent people and artists.    While no song is memorable, some are good, and there are no unlistenable songs, so I gave it another star.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|I'm a new fan to MCR, but their Black Parade video promotion got me hooked on their unique implementation of 70's glam rock elements (a la Queen) and neo-Punk.  And yes, there is some Beatles, Pink Floyd, and Aerosmith thrown in there (whether intentional or not!)  I bought the album today and listened to it through a few times and was drawn into its music.  Each song is very accessible.  It's not a cheesey, manufactured album, and every track stands on its own merits.   <br /> <br />I don't know if MCR will continue down this path, but they have a sure-fire combination of sounds that will draw a broad fan-base.  I'm hooked. <br /> <br /> <br />
0915811774|5.0|I am not big on \\"channeled information\\"...not that I don't believe that there are certain people who can channel the wisdom of ancient masters, but I believe that all of the wisdom, all of the guidance, all of the power that ever was, is, and will be is already within us. The only reason that the vast majority of us don't access this wisdom, however, is because most of us identify with our small \\"s\\" self rather than our Large \\"S\\" Self.<br /><br />After saying that, I do enjoy the 'Orin' series and have read quite a few of \\"his\\" books.

I made up a list of everything I wanted in a future mate. This was recommended in this book. And then instead of looking for this in another, I had to \\"become\\" what I wanted to attract.<br /><br />I dated people who were very unattached and very aloof and very unappreciative of me because this is the way I thought I deserved to be treated. Not consciously, but unconsciously. I attracted women to me that were \\"unavailable\\" to me because I was unavailable for myself. I attracted rejection and abandonment because I rejected and abandonded myself on many occasions and so I had to really heal the relationship I had with myself.

B000FZETIO|4.0|I know it's probably all been said, but yes, I was extremely disappointed to not see the original ending included in the movie. So I watched the extras, shivering with anticipation for this mythical &#34;original ending.&#34; Let down AGAIN! We aren't even given a final version! Bah! Sorry, but I've always rooted for Duckie. He at least deserved some screen time dancing with his true love.  BUT- it's still a great movie, and the other extras are quite satisfying, such as the &#34;Favorite Scenes&#34; which includes Duckie's infectious dance to Try a Little Tenderness and the fight between Duckie and Steff (you have to love that shot of Duckie peering over the edge of the balcony down at Steff, staring him down with the look of death).  I was really disappointed to not hear from James Spader on the extras. He's always been my favorite jerk. &#34;You got a problem, friend?&#34; And those linen suits and penny loafers with no socks?! I just can't get enough of his smug, self-satisfied rich boy.  Also, hearing the cast talking about John Hughes' directing was interesting. You see how he got the most from his actors. And the more I watch this movie, the more I am convinced there has never been a stronger teenage actress than the likes of Molly Ringwald. Her pout, her passion, her fury- the quintessential redhead. &#34;What about prom, Blane?!&#34;  SO, in conclusion, the DVD is worth watching (or renting) but you may not want to replace your copy with this.
B000GFLE86|3.0|After waiting in eager anticipation for this new album, I felt somewhat deflated after listening to it.  Don't misunderstand, it's not a bad collection per se; MP's voice is strong and clear, the production is fine, but the overall selection of material is just not nearly as good as her last album \\"Careless Love.\\" <br />  <br /> <br />
0385720920|5.0|for those who love their humor bizarre, Chuck Palahniuk is your man. Fight Club was a perfect book (and i'm sure it still is), and this one is pretty close to perfect too. My second favorite book so far by this author (i've read 5). i highly, highly recommend this thing.
B0002B94F4|4.0|Directed by Robert Altman, this film take place in the English country side of the 1930s at the lavish and beautiful estate known as Gosford Park. Sir William McCordle (Michael Gambon) and his wife, Sylvia (Kristin Scott Thomas) host a large, weekend hunting party for a distinguished assemblage of guests, who arrive accompanied by their downstairs entourage.<br /><br />It soon becomes clear that the film revolves around a hodge podge of subplots and intrigues, both upstairs and downstairs, some of which are quite interesting, others seemingly less so. They all become pertinent, however, when one of them is murdered by someone in their midst. The film plays as if it were a more upscale and lavish version of the PBS series \\"Mystery\\" or as a film based upon an Agatha Christie mystery.<br /><br />The cast is stellar with excellent performances by all. Maggie Smith is outstanding in the role of Constance Trentham, a snobby, self-absorbed, old biddy in need of money, so that she can continue the lifestyle to which she is accustomed. Jeremy Northam is wonderful playing matinee idol, Ivor Novello, and continues to extend his range, as this role requires him to sing, which he does quite credibly, in fact.<br /><br />Helen Mirren and Eileen Atkins are superlative as the housekeeper, Mrs. Wilson, and the cook, Mrs. Croft, who are, apparently, at war with each other. Richard E, Grant, Alan Bates, Derek Jacobi, Emily Watson, and Kelly MacDonald are wonderful as part of the core of downstairs folks through whose eyes the viewer see events unfold.<br /><br />Stephen Fry deserves mention for his brief, though memorable, turn as the laid back Inspector Thompson, whose bumbling investigative efforts seem almost sure to leave the murder unsolved. The audience, however, knows who did it by film's end, even though Inspector Thompson appears not to have a clue.<br /><br />The cinematography is beautiful, as it captures the sumpuousness and richness of the upstairs life in the manor home. It also captures the bleakness and confinement of downstairs life, as well, serving to further underline the great divide that exists between the two. The gulf is further delineated by one of the subplots, which sees the character played by Ryan Phillippe gamely straddle both worlds.<br /><br />The one small problem I found with the film is that, because there are so many characters with their own subplots and intrigues, the film is somewhat confusing at times. Moreover, some of the dialogue is occasionally unintelligible and garbled, due to overlapping dialogue, which was a bit annoying. Watching the DVD with the English subtitles feature on, however, would probably resolve this issue.<br /><br />The DVD offers a number of interesting features, including an enjoyable mini- ducumentary of Altman's efforts to ensure authenticity of period detail. They apparently hired a cook, a butler, and a maid who were in service during the early nineteen thirties as a sort of sounding board as to how things were done. It also features two commentaries, as well as a short on the making of Gosford Park. It is a value packed DVD and well worth the money. Viewers who like period pieces and mysteries will especially enjoy it.It also captures the bleakness and confinement of downstairs life, as well, serving to further underline the great divide that exists between the two.

B0000AQVCL|5.0|If the Beatles burst on to the scene 30 years after they did, then this is how they would sound like. It is refreshing to see a young band like this come along and keep Rock N' Roll moving on through to the new millenium. Australia'a answer to Oasis, they are carrying on what Oasis revived 12 years ago, good old fashioned Rock N' Roll. Even if you do get tired of hearing their singles over and over again on the radio, there are 13 songs on herewhich are all as good as the last. This is an excellent debut, it is clear this band are going to be around for a long long time and I'm predicting them to be one of the greatest bands to have ever come out of Australia. It is also good to see that in a world of idol and all those other popstar tv shows, a band has found stardom the old fashioned way, through non-stop touring and getting their name out to the public the hard way. They are sure reaping the benefits from all their labour now.<br /><br />My favourite tracks on this album are: Look what you've done, Get what you need, Get me outta here and Take it or leave it.<br /><br />The album is well produced, while not being over-produced, it still has a live feel to it, giving it that authentic Jet sound we have all become used to. The cover booklet also has a very 70's feel to it.

B000063BM9|4.0|masterful direction of a stellar cast, makes for a complex and absorbing film. Told in flashback, the film recounts how five individuals on the wrong side of the law hook up to steal a multi-million dollar cache of cocaine from a docked vessel.<br /><br />Led by former Los Angeles detective turned bad guy, Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), Roger \\"Verbal\\" Kint (Kevin Spacey), Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Todd Hockey ((Kevin Pollack), and Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), proceed to their rendevous point and begin executing their plan of action. Their foray into this million dollar drug heist turns bad almost immediately. Something or someone is afoot who does not want them to succeed, and who seems to know their every move.<br /><br />The story is told in flashback by \\"Verbal\\" Kint, a club footed, crestfallen, soft spoken, unlikely looking criminal. He recounts the details of the doomed heist to hardnosed Detective, David Kujan (Chazz Palmentieri), building his story around an almost mythic, Hungarian crime lord named Keyser Soze. As \\"Verbal\\" details what happened, the viewer is mesmerized by his compelling narrative of how he and his partners in crime were inveigled into attempting this daring heist, which ultimately led to the disastrous events that culminated on the ship. It seems that their heist was probably destined to be doomed from the start, as another agenda may have been paramount to theirs.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey won a 1995 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his low key, ingratiating portrayal of \\"Verbal\\" Kint. Gabriel Byrne also gives a compelling performance as the cop who ended on the wrong side of the law. The rest of the cast also give stellar performances, with the exception of Benicio Del Toro, who gives an odd, marble mouthed performance. Notwithstanding this, the film is really a splendid tour de force that is sure to captivate the viewer. Who is the mythic Keyser Soze? Watch the film and find out.
B0007OCG4W|5.0|\\"Closer\\" is a clever study of the interplay between four people who seem to live in their own intimate cosmos, and not in the rest of the world. The acting is superb: Natalie Portman is incandescent, Jude Law is emotional and vibrant, Julia Roberts is in and out of control, and the rough Clive Owen, who seems manipulative, is perhaps the most vulnerable of all. The needy Alice (Natalie Portman) proves to be the most independent. The soundtrack is emotive and supportive; never obtrusive. There is never any actual sex in the movie - sorry if you were hoping for that - but it is highly sexually charged, passionate, and erotic. Having seen it many times, I find it engaging and quietly beautiful to watch. I find myself vascillating between agreeing and disagreeing with their choices. It is a thought provoking and intelligent film.
B000AL730O|4.0|Sir Paul McCartney has released over twenty solo albums since the break-up of the Beatles in 1970.  With this in mind, one would think he couldn't possibly have any good melodies or poignant lyrics left in him.  Not so.  His newest album, \\"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\\", displays a fresh approach at music making for McCartney, due in large part to the help of new producer Nigel Godrich (who has also produced Radiohead and Beck). <br /> <br /> This album is more brooding and reflective than the usually whimsical, happy sounds from Sir Paul.  He and Godrich have worked hard to make sure that the emotional impact of each song is maximized, and Paul's normal \\"whoo\\"-ing and frequent vocal asides have been noticeably lessened.   <br /> <br /> Some of these melodies are gorgeous and make the heart ache, other tracks are rocking and joyous.  \\"Fine Line\\", the first single off the album, is an extremely catchy piano driven tune where, lyrically, Paul really lays the issue of some of his past music (and some of his unseen personality) on the table for all to see.   <br /> <br /> The highly publicized \\"Jenny Wren\\" has been called cousin of \\"Black Bird\\", an apt description since the finger picking guitar style is very similar to that track from the Beatles' \\"White Album\\".  The melody and lyrical idea are completely new, however, and the result is an exquisitely involving meditation on a \\"bird\\" (or girl) who can \\"see the world and its foolish ways.\\"   <br /> <br /> \\"Friends to Go\\" and \\"English Tea\\" inject some humor into the proceedings, while \\"Too Much Rain\\" provides a message of faith and hope.  In \\"Riding to Vanity Fair\\", Paul has a cathartic conversation with an unknown person who will not return friendship to the singer, even though he has tried all he can to maintain a loving relationship with this person.  It is one of McCartney's most angry and yet emotionally satisfying songs.   <br /> <br /> \\"Follow Me\\" and \\"Promise to You Girl\\" provide some light-heartedness after \\"Vanity\\", and the albums final track, \\"Anyway\\", features another strong melody, a cry for companionship and a gorgeous piano riff which is somewhat reminiscent of Curtis Mayfield's \\"People Get Ready\\". <br /> <br /> McCartney plays every instrument heard on the disc, minus strings and a few guest spots.  It is fascinating and joyful to see a man, who has already made so much great music, release a record of this compositional caliber, emotional yearning and technical playing ability.  The slogan for the recent Fidelity ad campaign featuring Sir Paul is apparently right: Never stop doing what you love.   <br />
0553573403|5.0|I just had to write a review for this book. I consider myself a casual reader and I'll admit I haven't read many other high fantasty books in my time and yet, this is quite honestly THE most well written book I have ever read, bar none. If you stick with this book (beginning is a little slow imho) you will agree with me. So if you are a casual reader or die-hard you have got to give this book a shot.
B000BB14YY|2.0|I didn't enjoy the film.  I also didn't enjoy the original play by Shakespeare.  King Lear is one of my least favorite Shakespeare plays.  I don't consider it particularly creative to remake a play that has already been done, and to add nothing of value to the original.  You can set it wherever you like, in medieval Japan or on the Moon, what's the difference.  It's King Lear, a downer of a play, there's nothing great about Ran just as there's nothing great about Lear, and it takes up three hours of your time.<br /><br />A moron named Lear, or Hidetoro, or whatever his name is, relinquishes power in his kingdom and turns the power over to his oldest son.  The youngest son warns him that it is a bad idea because the sons will be disloyal to their father.  He is right, of course, and Hidetoro Lear gets treated shabbily.  He's wanted dead or dead.<br /><br />In this treatment of the annoying plot, he loses his mind.  He has a faithful follower or two.  They overact.  There is nobody to root for in this depressing and ridiculously overrated downer of a play.  Lear Hidetoro is an absolute jerk.  Am I supposed to care what happens to him?  Why?  Because he used to be a powerful king, and a cruel one?  You may as well cry over Saddam Hussein.<br /><br />Look at this movie with fresh eyes.  Look at Shakespeare's King Lear with fresh eyes.  This stuff simply is not very entertaining, and is not very good.  The hell with King Lear.  He's an annoyance.
6305313687|3.0|Although there are skinheads and racism among certain types of whites in most countries, there is something particularly American about this movie (in spite of its British director) which makes me feel it is inappropriate for a non-American to voice an opinion. Here goes, anyway. I wouldn't call it bad, but I didn't take to it. It seemed preachy and sentimental, with stereotyped characters, and an ultimately shallow plot and story. Towards the end I found it hard to pay attention. Compared with Romper Stomper, a much lower budget Australian movie, with Russell Crowe, which deals with pretty well the same themes, I think it suffers. Romper Stomper packs a much heavier punch, is much less self-consciously arty, yet more artistic, and I have watched it several times. American History X is worthy, worth seeing, but not worth seeing twice.

B00005KKAQ|4.0|No, Jim is generally not as \\"hungry\\" or as vocally flexible range-wise here as in the first couple years of the Doors' existence, perhaps (check out the Soundstage DVD for sheer perfection).  But to dismiss these performances as drunken poetry recitals is just plain false--but then, similar criticisms were launched even in 1968 by those who had a set notion of what goods the Lizard King should be expected to deliver.  Not only is the sound quality superb, but to these ears there's plenty of energy and magic.  I mean, how much more inspired of a performance of \\"Been Down So Long\\" could you want from Jim?  Or how much more beautifully sung a \\"Crystal Ship?\\"  \\"The End\\" also--though the beginning lines are less than ideal with the band & Jim getting out of synch, some serious mojo is stirred up in the middle, with Jim in a deep poetic space.  No, you don't get \\"the killer awoke before dawn;\\" why should Jim have to always visit that particular room (fans were singing along to those lines by 1968, for crying out loud) when he had so many others to choose from.  The beauty is that, like the Grateful Dead exploring Dark Star, Jim is free to wander wherever he wants each time out so that each is unique & special, for both audience, and just as importantly, for him & the band.<br /><br />\\"Touch Me\\" is a big treat, with Robbie jamming instead of a saxophone--nice to hear this with just the band filling all the space.  Really like the \\"St. James Infirmary\\" back into \\"Love Me Two Times,\\" too.<br /><br />Perhaps this isn't the hottest Doors ever played, but it's pretty damned great--I know I'd have counted myself lucky to have attended one of these shows.  And I'm very happy to have this document as consolation.
B000I2J5UG|5.0|Okay, I'll be the first to admit... I had my hopes that this album would be amazing, but at the same time I couldn't bring myself to believe that My Chemical Romance could possibly exceed both of their previous albums.

B0002B15XI|5.0|M*A*S*H is on The American Film Institute's Top 100 (#56) and is also on The American Film Institute's Top 100 Comedies (#7). It's considered to be one of, director, Robert Altman's greatest artistic achievements. The movie even inspired the hit TV show of the same name. I've never watched that show, so all this material is new to me. But this film deserves all the praise it got. This is a great film. Donald Sutherland (who looked a lot like son Kiefer Sutherland when he was younger) plays Hawkeye; Elliot Gould plays Trapper; and Tom Skeritt plays Duke. All the men are highly skilled Army surgeons, but they don't look like it. They frequently drink, play pranks on one-another, make jokes; Which, of course, pisses a lot of people off. When they're put into a tent with the overly-religious Major Burns (Robert Duvall), they do everything they can to get him out. When they learn he's having an affair with the new nurse (Sally Kellerman), they affectionately nickname her Hot Lips. True, most of the humor is sexual humor which will turn a lot of people off...But this is truly a classic comedy. It's funny, never dull, and all the actors are so good at playing these characters. Elliot Gould and Donald Sutherland in particular, are truly really good. I don't know how it holds up to the TV show, as I said earlier, but this is a great movie. See it. <br /> <br />GRADE: A

B00005QAPH|5.0|Federico Fellini's \\"8 1/2\\" is considered by many to be one of the best films ever made, but has a large amount of haters too. It's not hard to see why, even if you love the film. It mixes fantasy and reality, sometimes jumping from one to the other with little-to-no warning. Some critics have even complained they couldn't tell what parts of the movie were fantasy and reality, which I think is actually kind of stupid...I knew exactly what was and what wasn't. I think it'll be hard for people to not acknowledge that this is a great film. It's not one of the most entertaining movies I've seen, but it's wonderfully photographed and has some classic moments. Visuals definitely overrule plot in the film. The movie opens in a very trippy dream sequence. Our main character, Guido (Marcello Mastroianni), dreams that he suffers asphxia in his car and then is suddenly floats into the sky; Before being pulled down via a rope by one of his associates. Namely his screenwriter. The movie is basically like this; Guido is a director who wants to make a movie, a good movie to be precise. Problem is, he's ran out of ideas and is stuck directing a science-fiction movie he has no interest in. Meanwhile, he juggles an affair with his mistress and his wife; He's not good at it. In one scene, his wife and mistress end up at the same place together. But, looking away from plot for a second, there's one scene that stands out among all others in my head. There's a flashback scence, where Guido, as a young boy, and his schoolmates go to the beach to watch the prostitute Saraghina. This scene plays almost like a silent film. She, basically, dances for the sex-crazed young boys; But it's not the dance itself, but the music on the soundtrack that she's dancing too. Neither one of these would factors would be of much importance, but it's the combination of them that makes the scene so great. It's very surreal and just really well done. I've only seen this film once, but I'm already curiously eagerto see it again. It's not like any movie I've ever seen before; The ending, especially, fits the film so well. A lot of people won't like it; It's in Italian, lots of fantasy sequences, etc. But this is a great film. Most critics, most filmmakers, Roger Ebert, and myself agree. See this film. <br /> <br />GRADE: A-

1400032717|4.0|One mark of a great novel is if it thrusts you into the mind of the protagonist, so that you feel you truly are that person, you experience what they experience, the way that they experience it, and having finished the book, sit back and think, \\"Whoa.\\"<br /><br />How brilliant, then, is a novel about an adolescent who actually is incapable of that precise experience, of understanding another's soul?<br /><br />the curious incident of the dog in the night-time is just that sort of book. It takes you inside of the mind of a 15 year old with autism, and brilliantly pulls back the curtain of what goes on inside someone who can do calculus in his head to relax, but is overwhelmed to the point of semi-consciousness at being in a crowded train station.<br /><br />But this is no dry documentary.  Instead, it is the intriguing story of the young man's search for answers, nimbly displaying the humanity, in all the twists and imperfections, of a variety of people in his life.  As you follow Christopher and the unfolding plot along, you are entertained, challenged, and provoked to think a little more deeply about humanity and the nature and limitations of human thought and response.  My only detraction of the novel is in its liberal use of profanity, which as in most novels is supposed to be \\"realistic\\" but ended up for me only being distracting.  An entertaining and provoking read.
B000HIVO64|5.0|Probably not since the Beatles' and David Bowie's heyday have I anticipated an artist's next record as much as I do Beck's. Always fresh, always exciting (with the possible exception of \\"Mutations\\" which is a good record but kind of workmanlike and a bit dull being a stripped-down version of the usually very colorful Beck), his albums are positively bursting with creativity, humor and wit. Now along comes \\"The Information\\" which in addition to some fantastic songs gives the fan/listener the chance to create her/his/its own unique artwork for the album. This is the best thing to happen to rock albums since the old gatefold sleeve was invented for the LP's of old. I can't begin to tell you how much fun it's been to create the artwork for this CD except that I'm tempted to buy one more copy and start all over again! The image stickers go way beyond 'hip','cool','rad' and 'hot'! The art is wonderfully weird and  is the essence of Beck.<br /><br />As for the actual CD, there are some minor misses melodically speaking but what they lack in strong melodies, they make up for in Beck's always incredibly inspired lyrics. Lyrically, I place him right up there with Dylan, Lennon, Jagger, Joni, Bowie, Bryan Ferry and Brian Eno. The first time I listened to this CD I was kind of let down. Some of the material sounded like previous songs, some of it sounded a bit rote. But wait! Repeated listening is guaranteed to bring out the magic of almost all these selections. My favorites are as follows: \\"Think I'm In Love\\" is a very cool pop song that's catchy as hell with its Beatlesque bass line. \\"Cellphone's Dead\\" is a hip-hop track with a ridiculously retro synth bass popping through it. \\"Strange Apparition\\" is pop with a hint of country (love the piano on this-it reminds me of the great Nicky Hopkins playing on the Stones' albums). \\"Soldier Jane\\" is classic Beck pop. \\"Nausea\\" sounds like \\"Black Tambourine\\"'s sister. \\"New Round\\" is an actual 'round' a la \\"Row,Row,Row Your Boat\\" with minimal instrumentation. \\"We Dance Alone\\" is a funky, funky hip-hop piece. The dark and spacey blip-hop \\"Motorcade\\" with its weird and wonderful line \\"we're all pushing up the tin can mountaintop\\" refrain is irresistable. The title track is in the funky/psychedelic hip-hop vein. The synth-based minimalist 'ballad' called \\"Movie Theme\\" is the best piece of all in my humble opinion. It's nothing short of being absolutely gorgeous.<br /><br />Instead of the usual final track which is mostly silence followed by a short last-minute freak-out, Beck gives us \\"The Horrible Fanfare/Landslide/Exoskeleton\\" which is a kind of summing up of the musical themes from the album. It starts out funky and ends up very spacey- perfect for the Grand Finale of \\"The Information\\". I don't think you'll regret acquiring this latest masterpiece from Mr. Hansen. Finally, the DVD that comes with the CD is pure cheesetastic fun. There's a lo-tech video for every song on the album and that, my friends, is GROOVY, not to mention pretty damn generous for the cost of the whole package. Enjoy!inimal instrumentation. \\"We Dance Alone\\" is a funky, funky hip-hop piece.

0689825498|4.0|Each page has an illustration of a crate, cage or box which is a flap. Underneath each one is a zoo animal. The background is plain white. The story is very simple and there is only one or two lines of narration per page and they are repetitive.  The only variation is the animal featured and a one word description.  For example \\"So they sent me a camel.  He was too naughty. I sent him back\\".  This book is a board book.  I gave this book four stars instead of five because the flaps could have been more sturdy.<br /><br />I thought this book might be too simple at first but when I introduced it to my daughter at 4 months she loved it instantly.  I think the simplicity of the story and uncomplicated images can hold the attention of one who is very young with a short attention span.  She did go through a stage around one year where she tore out half of the flaps.  Now that she is 17 months and passed that stage I bought her another copy.  She still loves this book and is learning the sign language for all the animals. I think this book will turn your child into a book lover, as children in general love animals and lift-the-flap books.
B00003CX9Q|1.0|This film is among the worst, most pointless, and most inane garbage that I've ever had the misfortune to view. Contrary to popular belief the alien was not cute he was CREEPY! The little boy was extremely annoying, and his relationship with the alien made me ill! Actually it made me more than ill, it was down right disturbing! His bond with the alien was one of the most freeky thing I have ever had to witness, and the kids family was just obnoixious. By the time the alien go home no one really cares anymore. You are just relieved that the film is finally over. Watch it only to say that you've seen this.
6305327041|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I saw it when it first came out and ten years later it's still just as funny. Basic plot: Ted is a bellhop at an expensive hotel and he's ALONE on New Year's night. Anyone who's had a bad night/day on the job can relate to Ted as he encounters the most 'unusual' situations. From the witches who need his 'secret' ingredient to make their potion, to a gangster's bratty kids, a gun toting psyco who likes to play kinky sex games with his wife and finally all the stories tie into a hilarious ending with a room of drunken Hollywood people who want to make Ted part of their hazardous (and very gross) bet. I don't want to give too much away but I will say that I will always love this movie and it has one of the best endings ever. If you love a good, dark comedy this is the movie for you!
B00005JLWN|4.0|The future - in order to stop the negative actions stemming from certain human emotions like anger and fear, the powers-that-be have long since decided that emotion must be taken out of the equation.  And in the world of \\"Equilibrium\\", it's gone - not just the 'negative' emotions but all emotion and feeling - love, passion, joy, compassion, conscience - banned and supressed by the mandatory administering of emotion-blocking drugs.  A class of law enforcement officers known as 'clerics' are charged with tracking down and destroying books, films, works of music, paintings, 'interactive computer programs' and all other works from the past that are deemed to have the potential to trigger emotion.  These are designated 'Emotional Content' (abbreviated EC-10, in an apparent dig at the alphanumerical ratings - 'PG-13', '16-UP', NC-17', 'M', etc. - that currently adorn movies, CDs, video games, etc. and that will probably be applied to novels, groceries, and a host of other products in the near future) and they still exist in fair abundance in the ruined areas outside of the world's cities, and sometimes carefully hidden away inside the cities as well.  Outside the cities is also a refuge for a number of people who've fled the ultra-regimented society in order to avoid being forced to take the drugs which block emotion. <br /> <br />    Through a series of events - some of which is brilliantly left open to interpretation to distinguish between coincidence and sub-concsious intent - a cleric named John Preston (Christian Bale) ends up missing doses of the emotion-suppressant and quickly beginning to feel again; and with it, to question: another taboo in this future world.  Preston is to end up being a key player in the simmering war between ultimate authoritarianism and free emotion. <br /> <br />   The action is tremendous; sort of Matrix-styled but actually outdoing it; and very impressively the movie actually shows how the system of seemingly impossible fighting used bythe clerics was developed through enormous computer analysis and simulation applied to the machine-like properties of an emotionless human mind.  The whole movie is eerily believable, with the possible exception of some aspects of certain events toward the end - not that they happen, but more the way they happen.  The ideas behind \\"Equilibrium\\", though, feel amazingly plausible all the way through.
B000FTWB7G|4.0|But it's uniqueness that might not sound great at first listen. lets face it, most of the songs aren't as catchy as the ones on Fallen. but there is a certain beauty to each of these songs! Amy Lee knows how to create the right atmostphere & how to make music interesting! She puts herself and her band into their own category of rock music. it's dark, it's supposed to be that way though. Sweet Sacrifice starts the album off on a high note. it's one of the catchier songs on the cd! dark, rockish. my only wish was that the next song, their single, had a rockier bridge but overall, they prob picked the right song for the first single! the video is also cool because it's beautiful to look at it and different! Weight of the World is similar to Everybody's Fool, both are rock and edgy, which makes them both good songs! Lithium is a dif touch, somewhat slow, somewhat rock, it's good but one of the songs that needs more then one listen to really enjoy it! Cloud Nine is next, prob the most haunting tracks and it's really edgy and dark. yes, it can compare to Haunted but I think it does fine standing on its own as well! Snow White Queen, I find the chorus to be one of the most enjoyable parts of the cd! It's a unique twist to the dark album they've created, such like the opera rockish song Lacrymosa. don't ask me what that means but the song itself is one of the best and really enjoyable tracks I've heard in a long time! Like You, Lose Control are both rockish but def not the most catchy tracks on the album. The Only One, I don't know why, but I found this track to be one of the best! the chorus is catchy, they build the song up good enough! I just find it entertaining! Lucky Star is def another great song! it's one of the ones that stands on its own, makes for a great dark rock track! All that I'm Living For keeps true to the bands rock style before they go out with a ballad, Good Enough at first listen seems to lack the magnificence of My Immortal but after a few listens, you can notice the beauty to this song! <br /> <br />The whole album is worth a thorough listen! Evanescence is a great band! they've created a great name for themselves and have made music that will stand on its own! I think anyone that wants a dark twist to music is in for a treat!
B00008PX8P|5.0|Whether your into jazz, classical, rock, alternative, heavy metal, etc...This is by far the best performances by the best group ever assembled.  Robert Plants voice is like none other, and is heard perfectly through this dvd.  Jimmy Page puts on a show and really shows us who the best guitarist ever was.  John Paul Jones...what can I say, he is the man that does it all under a larger microscope than Page and Plant.  John Bonham....THE BEST DRUM SOLO ever is included on this dvd \\"Moby Dick.\\"  This dvd shows the band from 1970-1779 (THEIR PRIME).  ALl I can say is buy it...No other DVD can compare to this one. EXCELLENT
B00005JKNC|4.0|I love this film, but I did feel it could have been a whole lot better. In my opinion, this was one of Jim Carrey's finest moments. He is all too well known as a wacky comedian, but it's about time people get the chance to see that he is a good actor and can do more than just stupid comedy. I was very impressed with his dramatic abilities. The visual re-creation used in this film is top quality. A very welcomed site in this era of hustle and bustle we live in. Very good production with a few errors to satisfy those who just live for finding mistakes in movies. Most of us realize that no production is perfect. I loved the plot in this film. Many of Carrey's other films lack this quality in a major way. A very human performance by someone we often see as a classic goof. A nice trip down memory lane. I highly recommend \\"The Majestic\\". If you want to see what Jim Carrey's abilities are, this is a good film showcasing his potential. Good casting, acting, directing and photography. In my opinion, it didn't quite live up to it's potential, but that's nothing new for Hollywood...............
0060594888|5.0|I have a lot of success books in my personal library, including the classics, Think and Grow Rich, Law of Success, The Magic of Thinking Big among others.  I love reading self-improvement books and borrowed this book from the library not expecting it to be much different than the others but motivational none-the-less.  Boy, was I wrong.  For me this book, puts the \\"icing on the success cake\\" and in some way completes the other success books I have.  The ideas are very practical and I have acutally put them into use more easily than other principles I have read about before (in the other books I own).<br /><br />As I pursue my personal goals, it is the principles presented in Canfield's book that I recall and put into practice.  It keeps me motivated to continue to pursue the goals I have set for myself.  I haven't finished my first reading and yet I am experiencing a positive and enpowering difference in my life.<br /><br />I feel asthough this is It!  This is the book I needed to owe,read and apply to take me to the next level in every area of my life.<br /><br />Do yourself a favour order the book, read it, study it and apply what you read and you can't go wrong.  Totally Excellent!!!!!
B00004D35U|3.0|I felt this was a great performance on the part of Jim Carrey, but the plot lacked for me. One shouldn't expect reality in a Carrey film, but it would have been nice to have seen this done a little more sensably. The plot is there, and boils down to make a point but I guess this really just isn't my cup of tea. This production was very well done with great visual effects, good acting, casting and a lot of comedy. The real hero of this film, is of course the dog who gives an academy award performance. I think he might have actually stolen the lead from Carrey on this one. Not a very thought provoking film, but funny and entertaining. I recommend it to anyone who loves outlandish, far-fetched comedy.
B000GG4Y32|1.0|I purchased this movie as it was labeled an epic film and someone even compared it to the best love story since Gone with the Wind.  Give me a break! <br /> <br />This movie had an agenda 25 years ago, and it still comes across that way in 2006. <br /> <br />The rating of PG is a joke.  Please do not watch this movie with your kids!  It is certainly has a more mature theme than what you would think. <br /> <br />The plot is lame and I am sorry I spent the money on it.  I plan to get rid of the movie and exchange it as used somewhere where I can get something that is entertaining, this certainly was not.  I did not even reach the end of the first disc before turning it off. <br /> <br />For top names in the industry making this film, all I can say is they got paid a lot of money for nothing.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|Is this even the same film? It's criminal what was done in the theatrical cut. Add back in almost an hour of material and it goes from a choppy, fitfully introspective swords & sandals movie to a cohesive, deeply introspective, more historically accurate masterpiece. Well, almost a masterpiece. Give it about an A-. <br /> <br />***VERY MINOR SPOILERS FOLLOW*** <br /> <br />It isn't just that a few scenes were extended. This is a fundamentally different film. The most obvious change is that the theatrical cut chops out the entire presence of Baldwin V, a child who inherits Baldin IV's throne for a brief time before everything goes down the tubes. I remember being confused when I looked at my history books by the fact that there was a Baldwin V recorded, and then dismissing the entire film as make believe. Not so the Director's Cut. The DVD Special Features include material documenting the historical facts on which the film is based. <br /> <br />Baldwin V is key not just because the history is now approximately correct, but because it develops the character of Sibylla (Eva Green), whose actions make no sense whatsoever in the theatrical release. The Director's Cut now shows why she does what she does. It also gives us a little more Baldwin IV, who is by far the most interesting character in the film. And it establishes that Balian and Sibylla have a lot more than a one night stand. Hard as it may be to believe, this cut even rescues Orlando Bloom's performance (partially, anyway). He wasn't trying to be an action hero at all, and the movie now establishes at the beginning why he's a guy who doesn't speak much. (Balian's history is of course invented, other than the fact that there was a Balian who defended Jerusalem as you see in the film and under the circumstances you see in the film.) <br /> <br />Motivations make sense. Relationships make sense. Everything makes sense.

B0000029PC|4.0|Brian Knox (review entered below) makes some interesting points about these famed recordings. Szell has a great (and altogether deserved) reputation as a conductor of classical directness and integrity. But - and there is a but with these great recordings - these recordings are not altogether as satisfying as their almost legendary reputation might suggest. There is an unexpected 'plushiness' to Szell's balances that mutes and dulls the edge of these genuinely exciting symphonies. There is just a little too much of the armchair and too little of the open-window. <br /> <br />This is a consequence of Szell's (wholly legitimate) view of these symphonies and their sound-world, of his revisions to the scores and of the recorded balances. Christoph von Dohnanyi (still with the great Cleveland Orchestra) lets far more sunlight and fresh-air onto the scene. So too does Klemperer - a fantastic but rare set (marred a little by his ponderous view of the 2nd symphony). David Zinman with the Tonhalle Orchestra Zurich is bright, buoyant and wonderfully alive (an outstanding version of the 2nd symphony). <br /> <br />But the real point is that these symphonies are superb works and any of these sets would provide much enjoyment.    <br />
0743289412|5.0|I have read a great deal of Stephen King's writing, enjoying many of his works and questioning others to a degree.  However, I do not recall ever feeling so connected the way I did with `Lisey's Story': in my opinion, this is Stephen King at his best.  Why?  Well, the relationship of Stephen King and the story's deceased supportive character, Scott Landon appear to be very similar.<br /><br />In retrospect, `Lisey's Story' is I believe, as much about widower Lisey Landon, her deceased author husband Scott Landon, Jimmy Dooley, and a spin-tingling place called Boo'ya Moon as it is about Stephen King. Clearly, and what I appreciate most is that the author joyfully celebrates (I know this may be an odd descriptive to include in a King novel) the craft of writing and the sense of accomplishment of being a writer (writers write regardless of if you are published or not), as it is King sharing a bit of his soul with his reader audience.  In this sense, `Lisey's Story' offer Stephen King's readers a unique insight into one of the greatest writers of this century. Perhaps it is coming of a deeper understanding of life and his own mortality, perhaps it is a desire to write about the never-ending attachment of love, perhaps it is due to his desire to share with his reader some lessons (as seen through Lisey's actions) about commitment . . . or it could be Stephen King simply being Stephen King - maestro of the written word - that readers will walk away with a different sense of depth as it relates to life than from any other Stephen King book.<br /><br />The story itself moves perfectly from the present to the past, as King easily uses flashback keys to move the present story forward in a manner that keeps the forward movement of the novel.  Part love story, part suspense, part mystery, and a whole lot of Stephen King, `Lisey's Story' is simply a spectacular read.
B000HWZ61Y|5.0|Wilmar you got it right. This is one of the greatest Rock Albums-by one of the greatest Rock bands. This album reached amazing heights. There is something for everyone on this album. From the Licks of Run Riot, to the ballad of Love Bites and of course the Top 40 favorite Pour some sugar on me. I have been a fan of Def Leppard since the early 80's (no I won't tell you how old I am) but it was the big thing for me to collect all the original B-sides. Every extended version of course my collection is HUGE. But I love the fact that the two cd disc has now come out. I mean really can you ever have to many Def Leppard CDS? Uh NO!!! This was a great idea. And if you get the chance I highly recommend the YEAH Tour. These guys put on an awesome show. STILL. I attended the HYSTERIA tour way back when and it is great to see these guys still have that energy. ROCK ON   As of today 10/30 I am going again. My friend Steve and I are going to Baltimore to see em again. Joe Elliott here I come. :)
B0000942EY|4.0|After the intense albums of the three previous years, including the heavy duty albums \\"Thick as a Brick,\\" \\"Passion Play,\\" and \\"Aqualung,\\" Jethro Tull was ready for something relatively light. \\"Warchild\\" is quite playful and almost frivolous in comparison to Tull's prior works. The album was also a break before the group plunged back into the depths with \\"Minstrel in the Gallery\\" and other weighty works. I imagine \\"Warchild\\" as a Mayday celebration after the labors of their previous works, with the costumes shown on the CD enhancing the playful aspects of this album. Unfortunately, the playfulness contrasts a lot with their other albums and makes this album less desirable.<br /><br />The opening song was supposed to form part of a movie soundtrack. \\"Warchild\\" delivers war-like sound effects and hints little at the story of the supposed movie, which is the afterlife of a little girl killed in an accident. The music is somber underneath, with a lot of strings and musical drama to match the relatively simple lyrics.<br /><br />Back into a topic more familiar to Tull, \\"Queen and Country\\" is a brief political commentary regarding empires and governments. There is a piano accordion in this song that hints at Britain's naval prowess.<br /><br />The fun begins with \\"Ladies,\\" which has a pleasant melody with clever percussion that makes this song stylistically fit with Tull's renaissance music. I think this song is one of the better songs on this CD, with excellent music and simple lyrics. There is a jazzy ending that makes the introduction to \\"Back-Door Angels\\" seem a bit bizarre. \\"Back-Door Angels\\" has a heavier sound than the previous songs with interesting keyboards and lyrics. There are nice guitar licks in the middle and second third that make this song seem out of place with the surrounding tracks. Listen for the musical tie-in to \\"A Passion Play.\\"<br /><br />\\"Sealion\\" is a fast-paced bit of lyrical surrealism. There is a circus tone to the music to match the lyrics, but other than the rock instrumentation, this song is all in fun. \\"Skating away on the Thin Ice of a New Day\\" has both lighter instruments and lyrics. This song is yet another of the better songs on this CD, although I could have wished for the song to be longer.<br /><br />The song \\"Bungle in the Jungle\\" received a fair amount of radio airplay in the 70s. This type of song became increasingly rare as the 70s progressed, but the combination of the catchy melody and Tull's popularity combined to make this song a winner. Critics also get a shot in the brief acoustical commentary, \\"Solitaire.\\"<br /><br />A borrowing from Beethoven enlivens \\"The Third Hoorah,\\" which is part of the \\"Warchild\\" concept. This song is okay, though one of the weaker tracks on this CD.<br /><br />The closing song to the original album was \\"Two Fingers,\\" a song leftover from \\"Aqualung\\" and reworked for this album. Keeping with the second half of \\"Aqualung,\\" the song contains more than a bit of commentary regarding salvation and religion. This song is fast paced, but is otherwise unremarkable.<br /><br />The seven bonus tracks provide a mixed bag of extras. True to the original concept, \\"Warchild Waltz\\" sounds as though it could have been part of a soundtrack. This music is orchestral, sounding only thematically similar to Jethro Tull. \\"Quartet\\" begins innocently enough with a mild jazz sound. However, about halfway through the song acquires orchestral elements and suddenly the keyboards kick in to change the flavor of this song for the second time. The synthesizer ending is charming and enjoyable. There is more than a passing resemblance to Wendy Carlos's work in this song, with elements similar to those in \\"A Passion Play.\\"<br /><br />There are portions of \\"Paradise Steakhouse\\" that I enjoy, but overall this song is one of my least favorites. I think it has something to do with those annoying \\"dah dah dah's.\\" Similarly, while there are parts of \\"Sealion 2\\" that I find interesting, this song just seems to add little to this CD. This song sounds as though it was an excerpt from \\"A Passion Play.\\"<br /><br />I am enthusiastic regarding \\"Rainbow Blues.\\" This song seems to lean musically in the direction of \\"Aqualung\\" and \\"Minstrel in the Gallery.\\" The song is fast with a good mix of elements and Jethro Tull's distinctive sound. This bonus track is one of the better songs on this CD. I also like \\"Glory Row,\\" which is one of the more dramatic and complex songs on this CD.<br /><br />This CD wraps up with the final bonus song, \\"Saturation,\\" which forms a downbeat finish to this playful CD. This song is about the hazards of city life, and portrays country life as positively as city life is portrayed negatively. This rock song has heavy guitar tracks and a heavy sound, which makes this song one of the edgier songs on this CD. Even though the tenor of the song does not fit well with the rest of the CD, I enjoy this song. Given that most of the songs on this CD were already a hodgepodge of styles, one more dissimilar song fits right in.<br /><br />Jethro Tull, consisting at that time of Ian Anderson, Barriemore Barlow, Martin Barre, John Evan and Jeffrey Hammond, was very popular in the early 70s. Their music was unique even in an era when unique music was in vogue. This album was a commercial success, reaching #2 on the charts and a critical success. Yet, the music seems less filling than some Jethro Tull music. If you are in the process of discovering Tull, try \\"Stand Up,\\" \\"Thick as a Brick,\\" or \\"Aqualung.\\" Save this album for when you become a big Tull fan.<br /><br />Note that there are numerous versions of this album listed on Amazon, under the name \\"Warchild\\" and \\"War Child.\\"  I recommend you survey the list of albums available and select the version that best meets your needs.  This version is an import from Japan and such versions are traditionally expensive.<br /><br />Good Luck!eresting, this song just seems to add little to this CD.

B00005N7Z1|4.0|In my opinion, at least with regards to Verhoeven's two other sci-fi favorites of mine -- 'Total Recall' and 'Starship Troopers' -- nobody in Hollywood orchestrates a better action sequence than the guy. Yet, I find 'Robocop''s action scenes a bit on the primitive side, with too many individual, sustained shots that lack the energy and mesmerizing choreography of his awaited work in the future. Adding to this pretty indolent display of action is Basil Poledouris' score, which just doesn't do it for me (and I'm a huge fan of the composer); the theme is heroic and cheesy, and the underlying cues for the film's explosion riddled action are kind of lifeless and unexciting.   <br /> <br />But know this! -- I only criticize this aspect of the film because it's so freakin' prominent.  Easily I find this to be 'Robocop''s biggest fault; the last half is too thin on story and idea, and way too concerned with sustaining a satisfying amount of action (as it was marketed, of course). There's just too much of it, with no real sense of purpose.  And it's disappointing, for sure, because the first half is set up with interesting sci-fi concepts, social commentary, questions of identity, and for a little bit, a dive into an emotional pool which I have yet to see Verhoeven return to in his career. Yet, suddenly the film's thoughtfulness is cut off, never expanding on the material; in place of the substance, we're left with a pretty boring \\"revenge\\" motive that determines nearly half the film -- meh. Now that I think about it, this result is probably more representative of all Verhoeven's films than I'd like to admit... so I'm going to stop thinking about it. <br /> <br />Overall, though, the movie's a goodie.  From the moment Murphy appears, all the way up to Robocop's initial journey of justice on the mean streets of Jersey, it's brilliant.  The scenes in the Security Concept building are especially entertaining, with Miguel Ferrer and Ronny Cox as the ambitious but greed-drivencorporate scum, battling for power amongst the whole decaying system.  And the montage of Robocop coming to life is just awesomely composed, progressing, in a series of about five disconnected scenes, from Murphy in the hospital to his machine-hybrid birthing (great use of point-of-view, especially).  And, though I don't care a great deal for a lot of the action sequences, by and large the film has beautiful cinematography with a great use of lighting and, to me, feels fresh and undated (again... by and large; surely I wouldn't say such a thing in the face of the dance club scene.. heh). A lot of it (first half primarily) also feels very raw and distinctly European, which I think Verhoeven, with time, sort of lost a grip on (the Euro feel, which I'm guessing he studied and admired, coming from that side of the world -- but I'm no film connoisseur).  So, in summary to my inability to write without graceful transition between sentences (!), the film is really technically stellar in many respects, and as much as I find myself apathetic about the action scenes overall, I still admire so much filmically, whenever I happen to watch the movie. <br /> <br />It's interesting to meditate on what in the world made 'Robocop' so popular; the only thing I can hypothesize is on the basic level of guns and gore (especially since it was made, and is remembered within that Schwarzenegger/Stallone era).  For sure it's vaguely seen as an action classic by the collective, but I think too the idea of a 'Robo'cop is just too titillating, even on the most unelaborated level, especially when the visual design and execution of the man-machine is so exquisitely done, as is the case here.  And I'm thinking right now that what I just wrote probably seems lopsided and all over the place, so I'm going to try to summarize quickly why I give the film four stars: half of it is great; half of it is good.  It's scholarly in many senses, and for anyone who derives joy out of film technicality there isso much to admire.  The story is absorbing, though ultimately a bit on the empty side, but I find it impossible to be too harsh on the film because it reeks of individuality and the distinct flair Verhoeven would garnish so much American attention for in the future.............. Yeah.................
B0002EQ7E2|5.0|Paul Simon managed to make an album that is almost better than anything he had done previously.  Brilliant.<br /><br />I have this on Vinyl + CD.  The LP sounds better, but doesn't have the bonus tracks
B00006RG9K|5.0|A Genesis concert was always an event. Each tour was a feast for the senses. Absolutely amazing musicianship, terrific lighting, and handsome images all designed to guide the audience through this mass-bonding experience. I can only dream what this band might be doing on stage with today's technology. I was happy when this came out on DVD. My VHS copy was wearing out.
B000G75AE8|5.0|It would be hard to say that I have been impressed with the last two full length Slayer albums. They were decent but something was missing and I don't just mean Dave. It just seemed Slayer had become sloppy, cliche and not motivated to be the band they once were with their first 6 albums. Whatever the problem was, it was fixed. Slayer sounds fresh, rested up and ready to rip your little throat out with \\"Christ Illusion\\" Even Kerry King has improved his riffs (while his lyrics are still that of a 15 year old who just saw his first picture of Baphomet) whatever it may be that brought Slayer out of their deep coma, it's a welcome return. Another thing you will notice right off the bat i'm sure is Tom's vocals. They seemed slower, almost trying to be catchier over the last few years, he is back with his old style (again, a welcome return) while this is not my favorite Slayer record. I'm grateful to see the Slayer I once loved return with one of the best releases of 2006.<br /><br />The biggest improvement I noticed, was the song structure. They have some great melodic fill-ins here. Most notable on songs such as \\"Flesh Storm\\" and \\"Catatonic\\" it really is good to see them change the song up a bit and not have me bored after the 3rd or 4th song. It is the type of thing which made \\"South of Heaven\\" such an amazing record. Just don't think, that this is all just speed/anger style of the first three records. They really have also found the ability (again) to add slowing it down a bit, which I feel is the reason for the \\"Seasons in the Abyss\\" comparing. Dave seems to be a good ring leader for the format (i.e chorus for Flesh storm, Catalyst and Jihad) while songs like Black Serenade and Supremist take on mostly a struture of speed and brutality. The songs are balanced, well thought out and have a great variety in them, ranging from Show on Mercy to Divine Intervention. So, if you're looking to check out Slayer (this is actually a really good starting point) or long over the good ole' days of Slayer; this should definetly please you.<br /><br />Favorite songs:<br /><br />1. Flesh Storm<br /><br />2. Skeleton Christ<br /><br />3. Catatonic<br /><br />4. Jihad<br /><br />5. Catalyst<br /><br />Enjoy.good ole' days of Slayer; this should definetly please you. <br /> <br />Favorite songs: <br /> <br />1. Flesh Storm <br />2. Skeleton Christ <br />3. Catatonic <br />4.

B0007G89G4|5.0|This film is one of my all time favorites. I think it's because these kids remind me of my friends and I as kids - riding our  bikes, going on little adventures, etc. The cast is absolutely perfect. Wil Wheaton was the best crying kid of all time - with the exception of Ricky Schroeder in The Champ. LOL. River Phoenix was excellent in this film, which is an adaptation of a Stephen King short story. Part road film, part coming of age tale, all the elements are here to tug at your heart strings.
0060545682|5.0|Un libro que en lo personal me hizo descubrir la magia que puede haber en recorrer nuestras memorias mas intensas, esas que se marcan en nuestra infancia y adolescencia, cuando la memoria esta mas fresca. Esos recuerdos y nostalgias van enlazadas a la distancia y la aceptacion de una nueva tierra que nos brinda la oportunidad de estar aqui lejos de la otra y de alguna forma seguir cosechando recuerdos.<br /><br />Por supuesto que estas nuevas memorias y vivencias nunca reemplazaran los recuerdos magicos de ese pais inventado... o real del cual venimos.
B0007PAMR4|4.0|I've heard it said that if you haven't read the book you'd be lost in this movie. I read the book and it was still a bit confusing! I like this version of the film with all the extra footage. Such a fantastic looking picture this was. I saw this in the theater when it came out. I remember a bit of controversy regarding the billing. Sting was touted as starring in this film, when in reality he had a supporting role. Shame on the movie execs who tried to capitalize off of his name and the then massive popularity of his band, The Police. It was nothing more than a ploy to get his fans into the theater. Having said that, Sting is actually pretty good in this film. He sneers, he wise cracks, he fights, and he looks pretty in his futuristic speedo. Of course, he gets killed in the end. Oh well.
B0009Q0F5U|5.0|HIGHLY recommended. The drums and old sounds are very moving. Be sure you have a good subwoofer to get the full experience. Excellent music, getting the next disk now!
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|The Black Parade. My Chemical Romance's much anticipated 3rd studio album.<br /><br />The sound of the band's softmore effort Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge was a big change in sound from their debut album I Brought You My Bullets You Brought Me Your Love. The Black Parade is an even bigger change in sound, even from their previous release. If you think that this album is just gonna be I'm Not okay being repeated over and over again, then think again. These songs are much darker, much more emotional, and much more epic. There are dark, metallic songs like This Is How I Disappear and The Sharpest Lives. There are epic emotional slower songs like Cancer and Disenchanted. Then there are light, upbeat songs like Dead, Welcome To The Black Parade, and Famous Last Words. Then there's Mama, which is a very weird song, but good nontheless.<br /><br />I think this is probably my favorite release from the band. The songs are much catchier and appeal to me much more than their previous albums (which are still great). This album has a much diffeent sound than Revenge and Bullets. As Gerard Way has said, its like they became a different band. The only thing about the album that isn't great in my opinion, is that the cover art sucks. And the only song that doesn't get 5 stars from me is Welcome To The Black Parade, which I really loved when I first heard it, but then it got a bit overplayed (I still like it though).<br /><br />I haven't listened to the album that much yet, so my favorites at this time are This Is How I Dissappear, The Sharpest Lives, Dead, House Of Wolves, Famous Last Words(the best way to end the album), and Disenchanted(probably the most epic track on the record).<br /><br />Defdidently pick this album up if you get the chance. It's MCR's best to date IMO.
B000FTWB7G|1.0|KUDOS! to the worst band on the planet, for releasing another album. What took them so long to give us another album. With such brilllent song writing and musicans, I can see why it took them long to collabrate these tracks. What a waste of studio time. When I previewed this a thought &lt;YAWN> i cant continue, I am getting very sleepy...zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
B00005JPB4|5.0|I read the book and found it incredibly compelling and one of the best WWII books I have ever read.   The book presented things in a sequential manner but the movie bounced back and forth between the battle, the bond tour and as elderly gentlemen. <br />Well I don't have to tell you that this it not Saving Private Ryan.  Is it real life.   It is very sad and disturbing but it is what it is.  It was war.  It was about a horribly bloody battle that many brave young men gruesomly died in.  It is about how 3 surviving guys that just happened to be there to help stand up the second flagpole on Surabaci and their picture made it safely to Guam to be developed and was safely \\"electronically\\" transmitted to NY and put on the front of the NYTimes.  It is about how they were used to raise money for the war effort.  I guess it is something we can't fathom today but America was broke and they really needed $14B.   These 3 guys helped raise that money.  One loved it, one hated it and one just did it. <br />The scenes on Iwo Jima were an off color kind of black and white (except for the US flag).  Very powerful. <br /> <br />I would highly recommend seeing this film.  It is sad but it is reality.  No sugar coating.  I truly enjoyed it.    But I must say when Mike Strank died I cried just like when I read the book.
B00000JLWW|3.0|To be perfectly honest, I don't hate this movie, but at the same time, I don't care for it too much either. The acting is good, and the music is stunning (the \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" song by Celine Dion is one heck of a ballad), but the movie itself is simply too long and way, way too scary and emotional (no small children allowed for this kind of film); not to mention there are quite a few thematic elements here and there that I could have done without.  <br /> <br />I know this is based on what really happened, and I know this is supposed to be a dramatic love story (I'm a sucker for romance), but there are certain things you just don't care to see on-screen. I do like drama, but this movie goes overboard with the whole drama thing (no pun intended). The scenes where the ship sinks, and where you see all those frozen corpses in the ocean--including poor Jack--have to be the very worst. I'm not saying the scenes are lame, but they're definitely too much for me. The movie people didn't underdo those scenes, they overdid them.  <br /> <br />So you make your own decision about whether you want to purchase this product; as for me, I'm staying away from this DVD, and sticking solely to the soundtrack.
B00005O3VD|4.0|Fanny Brice was one of the most impressive stage talents of Broadway's heyday in the 1920s when theater attendance was unusually high and when cultural diversity brought all sorts of new things into the public eye. Brice was a Jewish woman who landed herself on the Ziegfeld stage, a show that was famous for heralding beautiful women in showy costumes. Brice was no great beauty, but she was a wonderful comedienne and used her wit and upbringing to make audiences love her. Aside from being able to hold a room, she was also a wonderful singer who could make her fans both laugh and cry. This is the story of her life and her relationship with her gambling husband who caused her a great deal of pain.<br /><br />There are many problems with this film. The overall issue is the anachronisms. If the filmmakers wanted to be taken seriously, they should have paid more attention to the details. There is way too much music here that was written decades after Brice's heyday with no attempt to emulate the style of her era. Aside from Streisand's wardrobe, the costumes are a product of their era, not of the 1920s. The chorus girls of the Ziegfeld Follies have pouty lips, heavy eye makeup, costumes that enhance their bustiness, busky eyebrows, and buffant hairstyles. This is all wrong for the 20s, an era when being flatchested and shapeless was fashionable, women had pencil thin eyebrows, small red mouths, and Marcelwaved bobs.<br /><br />Another problem with the film as a biopic is Streisand's presence. Aside from the occasions where she is immitating Brice's characteristics such as a witty line delivery or a funny dance, Streisand is playing herself and promoting her own personality. For those who are familiar with Brice, the film is a disappointment because her radiant humor and powerful song delivery are missing. The \\"My Man\\" finale has to be the most disappointing of all. This song was a trademark of Brice's who sang the emotional song with an understated elegance that tore audiences apart. Streisand's version is self indulgent, showy, and forced, an embarassment and an awful way to end the film.<br /><br />Aside from those glaring mistakes, the movie is entertaining enough to stand on its own. It is certainly no masterpiece of cinema, but it passes the time amusingly enough. However, if you're looking for a biography of Fanny Brice, look elsewhere. The best alternative is to see her as she truly was in her few film appearances.audiences apart.

B000GY729M|4.0|The new disc is a departure less 80's Brit pop and more Meatloaf - maybe even a little Ziggy Stardust.<br /><br />At it's best, this album confirms this band has left the \\"two star town\\" status of one hit wonders.  I liked the tunes that rocked a little more like \\"Read My Mind\\" and \\"When You Were Young.\\"<br /><br />On the other hand, the Interlude and Exitlude would have worked better as instrumentals.<br /><br />Overall, this disc has more than enough to justify the purchase.
B000GY729M|2.0|I wish I had read more about it before I went out and bought this.  Other than the first single \\"When You Were Young\\" the album is very thin on likeable songs.  The lyrics are embarassingly cheesy, particularly on \\"Bling (Confessions of a King)\\".  I understand that bands have to switch styles and try something different, but this attempt at originality results in a stale, forced, unimaginative disaster of an album.   <br /> <br />And after reading that the lead singer said this album is better than \\"OK Computer\\" I seriously think he is as delusional as he is bankrupt of talent.   <br /> <br />Buy and enjoy \\"Hot Fuss\\" but skip this album.  It's simply garbage.
B0000025C0|3.0|\\"Don't Look Back\\" came out two years after the first one and although it maintains all of the familiar elements that made the first album so good, it does not measure up to said album.  I am not sure what it is, since in many ways \\"Don't Look Back\\" is very similar to the first one, but it just is not as good.  The title track got tons of airplay back in the day (and still gets a lot on classic rock stations today), and is a cool tune.  \\"A Man I'll Never Be\\" is another really strong ballad full of buildup and bombast, but the rest of the album somewhat leaves me cold.  The songs are not bad, they just aren't great either.  The music is mostly a re-hash of things done before, and the lyrics are very, very average 70's rock n roll good time party stuff.  The album is also a bit on the short side, even for 70's vinyl standards.  All in all \\"Don't Look Back\\" is a bit of a letdown from the band's debut, but probably better than everything that came after it.
B000G1ALRK|5.0|Eric Church is a newcomer in the country music scene, but heck ! Waht an album ! Church belongs to this category of singers whose voices are immediately recognizable, but with a special texture and a little something that sets him apart. Moreover, the pieces are perfectly constructed and very rich like the superb \\"before she does\\" (co-written with Trent Willmon). A lot of variety in these songs, everything eeficiently conducted by Aubrey Haynie (fiddle), Chris Thile (Nickel Creek) or even Dan Dugmore and many other stars ! What makes Eric's force is his melodies, the richness of his repertoire (some songs which are more or less slow and others which are faster). Let's note this great duet with Merle Haggard (needless to present) on \\"Pledge allegiance to the hag\\". Twelve songs which are really all more interesting that the others. Eric Church is a real good surprise, and we can't doubt that he'll go far. Cherry on teh cake, he wrote most of his pieces himself. A real good guy !!! <br /> <br /> <br />FACM ( French Association of Country Music -[...] )  <br />
B00025ETIW|5.0|This was my first foray into the world of My Chemical Romance and I have to say that I don't plan to leave this unchartered territory.  From what I've heard, MCR was more of a screamo/emo band before TCfSW was released, but now emphasizes more of the emo than the screamo part.  Anyways, TCfSW is now one of my favorite CDs.  I must say, my favorite song on here (and my no. 6 alltime favorite song) is most definitely The Ghost of You.  I'm not exactly sure why it's so amazing; maybe it's the haunting vocals, or the message of leaving the one you love behind (the music video suggests soldiers going off to war as the inspiration behind the single).  Whatever it is, My Chemical Romance has definitely made their impact on the rock genre, and if they were to stop right there, The Ghost of You would carry them on into eternity.  But wait! The fun doesn't stop there!! With this, you also get their other uberhit Helena and another awesome song called Give 'Em Hell Kid- all for no charge!!!  I must say that MCR is making quite a scene- and for the life of me, I can't see why anyone can dislike them.
B00005JLWN|5.0|Like so many who have reviewed this movie here, I found this movie quite by accident, having heard virtually nothing about it.  After the first viewing I have watched it at least 10 times.  I know that may sound excessive, and obsessive, but I feel this is perhaps one of the best science fiction movies ever made.  I believe Christian Bale's performance is perhaps one of the all time best cinematic portrayals I have ever encountered.  Wimmer (despite his whining directorial commentary which focused on his budget and what didn't get done rather than what did, and which can be chosen on the DVD) has transcended the typical dystopian epic by focusing on the evolution of Cleric John Preston's emergence from the sleep of his drugged existence into the life of a fully realized human being.  The premise is unique.  No one pushed Preston into giving up the drug - serendipity (or was it a Freudian accident?) resulted in the destruction of his \\"morning interval\\" followed by his first transgression - failure to reveal to his new partner that he has not replaced his dose.  He compounds that transgression be disposing of the next day's dose while walking up a crowded staircase.  We watch as four days go by and we see him emerge from the fog of Prozium.  We feel with him as he experiences a cascade of new sensations.  True to his former partner's prediction, he does indeed dream, and his dreams haunt him.  He's dumbstruck when he watches the beauty of a sun rise.  He weeps the first time he hears music.  He holds back a volume of Mother Goose from a Nether raid.  He cringes as he holds a dying man, watches the light go out in his eyes and feels his blood on his hands.  He rescues an orphaned pup, then kills \\"sweepers\\" to protect it and himself.  He opens his heart to a woman doomed to die, and remembers how he stood by in drugged numbness when his wife, Viviana, was executed as a sense offender.  He vainly attempts to rescue a group of rebels.  He steals into his sleeping children's bedroom at night to sit by them.  He smiles with love and pride when he learns his children, Robbie and Lisa, have been off the dose since their mother was incinerated.  He locates the Underground and becomes their \\"champion\\".  This is a truly masterful performance by a superb actor, with a great supporting cast.  The gun kata scenes are as well choreographed as a ballet.  Casting was superb, location, sets and lighting were outstanding, music was fabulous.  I feel it important to emphasize that I am not a kid who is simply thrilled by the violent gun kata scenes.  I am a 61 year old woman who was deeply moved by Bale's riveting performance.  This is far more than a simple action flick.

0393061434|1.0|Being a recent victim of the Apple \\"Switch\\" campaigns, I've decided to get into the spirit of things and get to know the brilliant man behind this very expensive machine sitting on my desk. <br /> <br />Let me just say this right now. Unless you're just absolutely IN LOVE with Steve Wozniak, do NOT buy this book. He writes like a child. Others have said that this was not enough to detract from the experience. I disagree. I cannot stand the constant grammatical errors (hasn't he heard of editors?) and this is probably one of very few cases where they should have let someone else write his life story. <br /> <br />On top of all that, Apple is rarely mentioned at all until the end. Except when he mentions that [insert whatever junior high achievement steve accomplished] is what prepared him for his role in the future! Add to that the disgusting display of \\"I'm the smartest and coolest guy alive!\\" attitude, and you get a steaming pile of iWoz. <br /> <br />Just show me where the refunds are at, and I'll go purchase a second copy of Bill Gates: Business @ the Speed of Thought. Maybe it'll help to sharpen the edges of my mind that reading iWoz has dulled.
B000777J2S|5.0|I bought this album after seeing Antony at the Point Theatre in Dublin performing in \\"Come so far for Beauty\\", a Leonard Cohen tribute. Antony literally stunned the audience that night and outshone all the bigger stars. I'm not a \\"Recording Engineer/Producer\\" but I was a piano teacher a long time ago. I love this album, I love Antonys unconventional use of vibrato (natural not trained or whatever who cares) and his lyrics are a reflection of his own honest view of himself. I own 600-700 CD's (from Puccini to the Sex pistols) and I rank this in my top 30.
B0001HAISG|5.0|This film is a real gem. The casting could not have been better. Jeremy Sumpter has a magical quality that makes Peter completely believeable. He is a cutie that grabs your heart with his  mischievous smile. Jason Issacs does double duty as both Mr. Darling and Captain Hook and handles  both roles perfectly. This film will appeal to all ages and everyone will take something special away from it. The youngest will love it for the timeless story and lovely special effects, while older viewers will be touched by the poignancy and ultimate loneliness of the boy who will not grow up. I highly recommend this movie.
B00005JKC3|4.0|I personally don't understand why people have their knives out for this film. Sure, i'm not a comic-book expert and never knew much about the Hulk or any other comic-book character, so that's why i probably have a more objective perspective of the film. I thought it was very interesting and entertaining. I also found very interesting the way the characters weren't one-dimensional. They show different aspects of their personality throughout the film which, i believe, confused some people, but i loved it. The effects were very cool and i also loved the editing. Altogether a very acomplished effort.
B000GRTQSE|3.0|I bought this from reading some of the reviews thinking I was getting some good ol' Bob Dylan music. Not so. My husband and I have been big Dylan fans since the 60's. The songs are just little diddies with no edge to them. The only one that we liked was \\"When the Deal Comes Down\\"
B00005JPAD|5.0|Martin Scorsese once again delivers an outstanding Oscar worthy effort in his interpretation of the Hong Kong produced thriller \\"Infernal Affairs\\".  \\"The Departed\\" is a convoluted crime thriller surrounding the infiltration of the Massachusetts State Troopers by Irish racketeer Frank Costello who in turn also has a mole planted within his organization courtesy of the Mass. Troopers.<br /><br />Costello played by the most talented actor gracing the silver screen today, Jack Nicholson, has groomed Colin Sullivan, a young fatherless Boston kid.  Sullivan played by Matt Damon evolves into an aspiring and rapidly rising officer with the Mass. Troopers.  He provides Costello with essential inside info to run his criminal empire.<br /><br />Meanwhile young trooper Billy Costigan, played by the extemely accomplished Leonardo DiCaprio is recruited to worm into Costello's crime empire.  Coming from a well known, by both cops and hoods, Irish family he is disgraced and incarcerated to help build up a suitable criminal background.  Working undercover clandestinely for Capt. Queenan played by Martin Sheen and his cohort the hyperactive and wisecracking Sgt. Dignam played excellently by Mark Wahlberg, DiCaprio is their eyes and ears.<br /><br />Both Costello and the Troopers ironically believe that their respective organizations are both populated by an informant.  Damon and DiCaprio are simultaneously commissioned to detect the other.  In a thrilling cat and mouse game the players manuever like pieces on a chessboard to elude unearthing.  Cynically, both Damon and DiCaprio confide in the same police psychiatrist played by Vera Farmiga.<br /><br />This violent passion play set against the backdrop of the streets of Boston, is just another demonstration of the stupendous skills of the masterful Scorsese, especially in this milieu.  The acting performances were terrific most notably by Nicholson and DiCaprio.  The underrated Alec Baldwin also proves his mettle as Damon's boss Capt. Ellerby.ss Capt. Ellerby.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|The title of the review says it all.  If you are an Alien fan that is.  I won't go into the specs as those are available elsewhere.  Two of the features that make this set so noteworthy are the extended cut of Alien 3, and the extensive documentaries on all 4 movies.  Although I really enjoyed Alien 3, I still thought it was the weakest of all 4 movies.  Visually, the movie is beautiful, but story wise, it was a very hard movie to get into after two major characters from Aliens get killed off in the opening credits (not spoiling anything), and one is mangled almost beyond repair.  However, having said all that, the new version, even though not approved by David Fincher, is a much better version that the theatrical.  Definitely worth the watch.   <br /> <br />The documentaries are hands down excellent!  Alien Ressurection's documentary is probably the weakest of the four, but still good.  Alot of excellent insight into the filmmaking process, the problems behind the camera, the short timelines, the pressures of the execs, Sigourney Weaver's non gun-toting vision of Ripley for Aliens etc... It is fascinating.  The only thing missing was the true nature of Fincher's conflicts with the execs at Fox for Alien 3, which are noticeably removed from the documentary. <br /> <br />A must buy, at a great price at that!
B000JPLBCC|5.0|The 8th book in the Stephanie Plum series is another gem from writer, Janet Evanovich. Fans of the series could not wait to get their hands on this release, and new readers will be delighted at the antics of the characters in these books. In this installment, Stephanie's mother asks her to find a neighbor's missing relative, and family loyalty (and boredom) spurs Stephanie to take on the case. However, when she gets involved, a shady landlord starts warning her off the scent, and suddenly Stephanie finds out his henchman are following her. When various bad things start to happen, (i.e. her car gets blown up again, she is followed by someone in a bunny suit, snakes wind up in her apartment, and a dead body appears on her couch) Stephanie knows she is in way too deep. She enlists the help of the sexy Ranger to help her out of this jam, and also finds herself with help from both Grandma Mazur and Lula. All of the favorite characters from previous installments return, and their antics will have you laughing aloud.<br /><br />I cannot believe that there are people who actually have not read this series! Stephanie Plum is a hilarious character, and her slapstick comedy has made me laugh aloud at some strange times. If I read these books in front of other people, they invariably ask me what is so funny, and I can never quite relate the story as well as Ms. Evanovich can! There are few mystery books that can make me laugh as much as this series and yet keep me interested in the mystery, but this series does it all. Who else but Stephanie Plum can have every car she has ever owned wrecked in some way (they usually blow up), and be chased by a person in a bunny suit? If you have never read any of the books in the series, join the millions of others that have and get reading today!<br /><br />The first book in the series is \\"One for the Money\\". Enjoy!
0618680004|3.0|I am not a deeply religious man.  I believe in God.  However, does my belief, or for that matter any other person's belief, make Him exist?  Either there is a God or there isn't, regardless of one or many individuals' beliefs.  Unfortunately, no one has the definitive, no-contest answer to this perplexing conundrum.  If there were, then faith wouldn't play such an integral role in religion/spirituality.  Imagine if we could petition the Lord in a tangible form or see Him?  Where would the faith be if we could see Him interviewed on the news?  The disclosure to this riddle does not appear till after we die, when we'll either be greeted by an eternity of darkness or.... <br /> <br />Oh, and Richard Dawkins, thanks for letting me know that I can question religion.  I can also question politics, science, literature, history and many other ideas.  I didn't need your book to make me aware of this.  Don't presume presume Hawkins is a prophet of atheism, though.  The book is simply selling an aggressive form of religious skepticism, which isn't new.  Of course, he won't see any of the profits, since as he is so concerned about world peace he will certainly donate them to some fund or organization with similar aspirations.  Regardless, as Kevin Phillips explains in his book American Theocracy, America has a higher percentage of church membership today than it ever has.  There currently are atheists, and there always have been atheists.  Ironically, Dawkins book/ideas represent principles of religion, but only under a different guise.  How does the old saying go, \\"meet the new boss, same as the old boss\\".  Dawkins ideas implemented to their fullest wouldn't change a thing other than the names.  The violence and disparity in the world has causes much wider, varied, and more complicated than Dawkins suggests.  His ideas slight all of the other causes, politics, geography, culture, greed, envy, survival, etc, which compromises the thesis of his argument.  Read his book, but borrow it from the library.  The book will ask you to think, but not very much.  It would prefer if you blindly accept.  It arrogantly preaches to the choir pandering to people who already believe, ironically, in atheism.  See you in hell (haha).   <br /> <br />I give this book 3 stars because of its average quality.
B000HIRTQ8|5.0|The 8th book in the Stephanie Plum series is another gem from writer, Janet Evanovich. Fans of the series could not wait to get their hands on this release, and new readers will be delighted at the antics of the characters in these books. In this installment, Stephanie's mother asks her to find a neighbor's missing relative, and family loyalty (and boredom) spurs Stephanie to take on the case. However, when she gets involved, a shady landlord starts warning her off the scent, and suddenly Stephanie finds out his henchman are following her. When various bad things start to happen, (i.e. her car gets blown up again, she is followed by someone in a bunny suit, snakes wind up in her apartment, and a dead body appears on her couch) Stephanie knows she is in way too deep. She enlists the help of the sexy Ranger to help her out of this jam, and also finds herself with help from both Grandma Mazur and Lula. All of the favorite characters from previous installments return, and their antics will have you laughing aloud.<br /><br />I cannot believe that there are people who actually have not read this series! Stephanie Plum is a hilarious character, and her slapstick comedy has made me laugh aloud at some strange times. If I read these books in front of other people, they invariably ask me what is so funny, and I can never quite relate the story as well as Ms. Evanovich can! There are few mystery books that can make me laugh as much as this series and yet keep me interested in the mystery, but this series does it all. Who else but Stephanie Plum can have every car she has ever owned wrecked in some way (they usually blow up), and be chased by a person in a bunny suit? If you have never read any of the books in the series, join the millions of others that have and get reading today!<br /><br />The first book in the series is \\"One for the Money\\". Enjoy!
0393327655|4.0|Sam Harris, who was a graduate student in neuroscience when he wrote this book, goes after organized religion with hammer and tong. Early on he states his premise: we can no longer tolerate religions that advocate martyrdom and the murder of innocents in honor of their god, nor can we tolerate a literal interpretation of the Book of Revelation. The world is too dangerous: these same people now have access to nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons.<br /><br /> Harris blames religion for the murder of millions upon millions of people. Early on, he points to The Inquisition, which was officially sanctioned by the Church in 1215 during the Lateran Council. It had been extant since the Fourth Century. Harris shows how the church worked hand-in-hand with secular powers to deprive \\"heretics\\" of their land and wealth. Harris blames faith itself. He says, \\"Whenever a man imagines that he need only believe the truth of a proposition, without evidence . . . he becomes capable of anything.\\" None of the great doctors of the church go unscathed. St. Augustine supposedly sanctioned torture to punish those who broke the laws of God. Matthew the Evangelist puts words in the mouths of the Jews who called for Jesus's execution rather than Barabbas's. Those words, \\"His blood be on us and on our children,\\" would be the impetus for the Holocaust.<br /><br /> Harris does admit that man has a spiritual side, but he turns to meditation and what sounds like Buddhism as an alternative to religious faith. Harris's meditation leads him to a state of selflessness. Besides religion, Harris blames envy, jealousy and hatred---all resulting from selfishness---for the evils in the word. Like Buddhism he stresses compassion and love.<br /><br /> Harris ends with some modern offenses done in the name of religion: Pope John Paul I's opposition of condom use in AIDS-ravaged Africa; Muslim rioting over a report that U.S. Interrogators defiled the Koran, and the fact that twenty states would like to have their schools teach Creationism alongside evolution. Ronald Reagan was so convinced that the apocalypse was at hand that he included Jerry Falwell in his national security briefings. Harris provides some statistics: Only 28% of Americans believe in evolution; 72% believe in angels.<br /><br /> The fact that Sam Harris would not allow his book to translated into Arabic says it all. He was worried that the translators would be held accountable for what he said.to have their schools teach Creationism alongside evolution.

I have been an environmentalist since I was very young, even though my family wasn't, and everything Mr Gore is saying about the environment is true.  Global warming is killing our planet, and George W. Bush has allowed the process to accelerate by the Healthy Forest Initiative, the Clear Skys Initiative, and any number of other Acts and Initiatives with Orwellian names attached to them.  Everyone who expects to have children, who expects to breathe, who wants to go outside must watch this movie.  It's not just flooding that's the problem, it's also the pollution.  Look at Texas after Bush was done with it, the worst pollution in the 50 states.

B000002UAU|5.0|I remember as an eight-year-old child cranking up the scratchy vinyl copy on the old black rainbow Capitol record label on my parents \\"console\\" stereo and loving it.  I must say that it really awakened my interest in music.  I didn't \\"get it\\" then like the way I do now, but it didn't matter.  It was fascinating to listen to and one of the few vivid memories from that time in my life.<br /><br />Now my six year old is listening to it on CD, and I suppose when I turn 64 in 2024 I'll listen to it on my music archive chip player (or maybe vinyl will totally come back by then) and enjoy the joke that I had arrvied at an age I thought inconceivable back when I first heard the song.  And, probably on that same day hundreds if not thousands of people will be listening to this album too.<br /><br />That's because it truly is a classic.  I define \\"classic\\" as something that will be listened to for an indefinite time in the future, possibly centuries.  On this day 100 years from now someone will likely be listening to this recording, either in a solar powered tower with a holographic beatles concert simulator or perhaps in a dystopian slum on an old vinyl record player that survived world war four and five.<br /><br />So, just kick back with a good sound system and enjoy it.  It doesn't pay to think too much or try to decode all the hidden messages or worry about whether or not it's better than Pet Sounds or whether it would even exist without Pet Sounds coming first.  And it also doesn't pay to worry about whether or not it's the \\"best\\" Beatles album.  It is what it is, that's all.<br /><br />Oh yeah, now that we are somewhere around the 40th anniversary of this recording, I hope that some anniversary package is in the works.  You know, remastered with bonus tracks and delux packaging.  That would be cool.  And one thing I'll say for the vinyl: it's a whole lot easier to look at all the faces and figure out who they are.
B00008AWOD|5.0|I'll start out by saying that I'm biased and am a huge fan of Placebo.  I love the way that the band has progressed and believe that each album that they've put out has something that someone can connect to in some way or another.  I've owned this one for awhile and it is easily my favorite Placebo disk.  There are dark songs, but there are also songs of hope mingling throughout.  However, both the dark and the light songs rip through with an energy that is pure rock and roll and pure Placebo.  Brian's vocals have so much conviction on this album it is as if he wrote part of a journal entry of his own life.  Standout tracks for me have to be the songs of hope, which to me are \\"Sleeping with Ghosts\\", which insists that two who were meant to be together will be, through whatever may happen, good or bad.  The other one would have to be \\"Plasticine\\", which just tells people not to be ashamed of themselves for anything. It's a shame that these two tracks never got airplay.  The rest of the album is worth every penny too.  Get it.
B000001ELR|5.0|I know most of you will disagree and think I'm out of my f'n mind, but in my opinion (which everyone is entilted to by the way), this has got to be THE absolute best KISS album released (studio wise that is....ALIVE is their best album over all).   <br /> <br />This entire album rocks from start to finish from the title track opener, to the closing \\"War Machine.\\"  Even the ballad \\"I Still Love You\\" just punches you right in the gut with power.  There's not one weak moment on the album.  Like other reviewers mentioned, it's too bad that Ace is missing from the album.  This is the KISS style he so badly wanted to return to.   <br /> <br />If you haven't heard this album yet, or if it's one you opted not to buy because it wasn't the original lineup, GET IT!!!!!  You won't be disappointed by any means.  I will honestly go as far as saying....if asked if I was stranded on a deserted island, and I could only have 5 cd's with me, which ones would they be?   This would definitely be one of them.
8590379825|5.0|I developed my previous project (Ribosome Builder [sourceforge.net]) with Lua and found it to be very stable, easy-to-use, small, fast and powerful. That said, I was eagerly looking forward to the release of this next edition of the book, because I'm using Lua again for my current projects, and hope to make even better use of Lua 5.1. I'm especially excited about the new support for modules, and also the fact that Lua is now supported by SWIG. Previously, I had to do a lot of manual hacking to define the interface functions between my core code (in C++) and the lua scripts. <br /> <br />I've read about 3/4 of the book so far and I am very pleased with it. The book is very cleanly and clearly written, with many things explained in a concise and elegant style. For example, Ierusalimschy's explanation of closures allowed me to immediately grasp them and appreciate why they are useful. I remember reading about them way back years ago in Larry Wall's book 'Programming Perl', and was remained rather confused about the concept. I don't know if the additional years of experience helped, but the clear style of the Lua book certainly did. <br /> <br />Using a scripting language for enhancing and extending a complex project just seems to be a given for most serious projects these days, and after surveying the field, I considered only two main choices: Python and Lua. Python is also really well designed and powerful, but I decided to go with Lua because it does pretty much everything I need it to do, does it very well, but best of all, it is so very small. These days when even the most basic projects can quickly grow into complex, interconnected monstrosities with a zillion dependencies, I believe that the values of small and simple are more important than ever. So for that reason especially, I'm really excited about Lua and the prospect for using it more effectively after I finish swallowing this tasty Blue PIL.

I also attended the Guerilla Business School, a $2500 intensive.<br /><br />  What is important to realize is that actually being in a room in the workshops and doing it several days in a row will actually (as it did with me) shift your perspective, if you are at all open to having it shifted.<br /><br />  Getting into a better mindset with regards to prosperity is fundamentally an issue of breaking down old programs and replacing them with new ones.<br /><br />  This book may help you, but the seminar will help you more.<br /><br />  The Millionaire Mind intensive taught me things and set in motion a change in perpective for me.  I am now financially free and well on my way to be wealthy as an internet marketer promoting a website called ZeroDollarMarketer dot com.<br /><br />  Being rich is a matter of perspective.  True wealth is measured for me by the health of my body and mind, my relationships, and lastly my pocketbook.  But its sure good to have plenty left over at the end of the month.<br /><br />  A journey worth pursuing.
0345440900|5.0|I read them all.  Ferber, Sears, et al.  My sister gave me this book while I was still pregnant and I read it thoroughly.  Liked the middle of the road approach and when we came home from the hospital, I picked it up again, read pertinent sections and put it into play. <br /> <br />Please note that I am commenting on this from a formula feeding mom's perspective and my baby was a big guy.  That being said, using the principles of this book, my baby was sleeping from 8:30 p.m. to 5:50 a.m. by 11 weeks.  He napped during the day and I actually enjoyed the first 6 months of his life. <br /> <br />Cannot say enough good things about this book.
0385339682|2.0|I LOVE John Grisham. I have read almost all his books, but this one.... I couldn't even read beyond the first hundred pages. It is so slow, a lot of narrative. It looks more like a history book than a thriller one. I didn't like at all.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|This CD is great.  I feel that this is the best MCR album to date.  I have been a fan of their other albums as well, especially Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge, but I have listened to The Black Parade a couple of times completely already and nearly every song is amazing.  I do not typically buy many CDs anymore but this is definetly a CD worth buying.
B000GB775E|2.0|I liked Freaky Friday, but after that, she pulled a Courtney Love and screwed over her whole life. <br /> <br />Ashley Albright is a squeaky clean, popular, pretty-in-pink, almost too perfect character. <br /> <br />The guy is, well...not very cute, and not very popular. He's actually quite grubby. <br /> <br />To say it in the least, I barely got through the first half-hour. (And I was watching it around 5:30, so don't question my credibility.) <br /> <br />In one word, *BORING*. I nearly fell asleep. After much struggle, I managed to watch the movie for a whole 45 minutes without throwing a fit over what a waste of money this was. <br /> <br />I could have done so much more with 2 bucks in Family Video!  <br /> <br />I guess if you like boring plotlines, 5 'o clock shadow, and sugary sweet \\"nice\\" girls, then this movie is for you.
B000M4RG42|4.0|Since Mystic River (2003) and following four decades in the film industry, the 70-something veteran director-actor Eastwood delivered reflective films that explored and debunked particular iconic myths (some of them created by Eastwood himself during his prolific career in the 60s and 70s). In a sense, Eastwood resumed an earlier phase in career with films such as Unforgiven (1992) and In the Line of Fire (1993).  <br /> <br />Eastwood's antiheroes were designed to counteract the simplistic heroes of John Wayne (see my review of Wayne's last western, The Shootist, 1976). Eastwood's retired gunslinger in Unforgiven (exploring the myth of Eastwood's Man With No Name persona in the 1960s spaghetti westerns) is not as gallant as Wayne's dying Shootist.  <br /> <br />Sean Penn's mournful, vigilante character is more complex and totally unheroic, compared to Eastwood's 1970s & 1980s antihero cop Dirty Harry. Eastwood's ageing trainer in Million Dollar Baby (2004)is on the verge of moving away from the regret and rejection of the past as he coaches an emerging champion coming from nowhere - but, unlike Mickey in Rocky I-III and Rocky himself in Rocky V, a tragic accident robs him of his chance to compensate for past failures as boxing coach and parent.  <br /> <br />And now, Eastwood's Flags of our Fathers (2006) is in complete contrast to the jingoism and propagandism of Wayne's Sands of Iwo Jima (1949), about the same episode of the WWII Pacific island campaign, or The Green Berets (1968), and more similar to WWII veteran John Ford's film about the Pacific campaigns of WWII, They Were Expendable (1945). Another attempt of Eastwood to debunk the myth of the Wayne persona, in this case the war hero. <br />
B00005LQ04|5.0|Dario Argento's first overtly supernatural horror film is an aesthetic triumph, an overpowering tableaux of colour, a visual overload that is quite unforgettable. Employing the by then outmoded Technicolor system gives the film a strange surreal lustre, a nightmarish never land in which strong primary colours weave and clash in perfect symmetry to create a fairy tale world in which the agents of myth, legend and folklore play out their cruel and violent games. Situating his film within mythical stories of witchcraft, gives the film a distinct European flavour but in a different way to say \\"Profondo Rosso\\" or \\"Bird with the Crystal Plumage\\", these films offered a chic, cosmopolitan and somewhat decadent vision of Europe. As a result the nightmare logic of the film (aided and abetted by a frankly astonishing soundtrack) is given an added resonance and reality. Critics of the film might attack it's derivative and nonsensical narrative, lack of emotion or dubious acting, but this is too miss the point entirely. \\"Suspiria\\" is an art-horror film, I don't mean this in a pretentious way in relation to notions of art cinema, but art as in a picture in a gallery. It's entire purpose is to overwhelm the viewer with aesthetic brilliance and in this regard it is a masterpiece of the genre.<br /><br /> This particular release by Anchor Bay is excellent. Three discs including a wonderful print of the film, the awesome Goblin soundtrack which works as effectively without the visuals and an impressive documentary. This I surely the last word on the film.
0618680004|5.0|Let's talk turkey: Religion has become a problem. What's the solution? Analyze the situation and act accordingly. Part of that analysis is this book, the origin of which is clear: Atheists are alarmed by the bizarre actions of religious extremists. Here's what happened: There was, I believe, a tacit agreement between Atheists and Theists that each would not step on the other's territory. Then the Theists started wearing their faith on their sleeves. They wanted intelligent design taught in science classes. They wanted creationism taught in science classes. They wanted prayers in the schools. (Whose prayers and to which gods?) They set up crosses on that hill in San Diego. They put the Ten Commandments near city hall in the City of Brotherly Love. They crashed planes into buildings on 9/11. (Yes, those were not terrorists so much as sincere people who believed in Islam and that Allah wanted them to do what they did). They set off bombs in London. In short, religion has caused a moral and cultural emergency and contributed to a harsh and increasingly unpopular expensive war. Backlash is needed. And Richard Dawkins has taken the gloves off and given us the much needed scientific and atheistic side of the story against religion and all that horrible stuff that religion has to answer for both now and in the past. Does God exist? From a deductive logic point of view, it is impossible to answer this question, because all conclusions from deductions are implicit in the premises. Therefore, as Dawkins points out, no conclusive deductive answer to this problem is possible unless God himself arrives on a white cloud and announces his existence personally. So we have to fall back on inductive logic which will give a probability, not a certainty, about the existence of God. Dawkins demonstrates the arguments well and reaches the only conclusion possible: God probably does not exist. He certainly doesn't exist as most Christians think he does, nor does heaven exist, nor hell, nor life after death. And yet, a moral society could work well without God and in the process lots of energy, time, and expense would be saved because those things would not be wasted on the God delusion. Dawkins is at his best in the chapter about the Bible unmasked. This so called holy book is filled with highly questionable precepts, morality and bizarre role models. Take Lot. God sends two angels to tell Lot to beat it because Sodom and Gomorrah are to be destroyed. The men of S&G gather outside Lot's home and demand to have the angels so that they can (what else?) sodomize them. Lot instead releases his two virgin daughters to the crowd and the crowd does what they wish to the young ladies. Later Lot's wife gets turned into a pillar of salt for turning to watch the fireworks. (Does her punishment fit the crime?) Still later, in the cave where they have gone, Lot's daughters get horny and have sex with daddy while he is drunk. Is this family values? Or is this a highly dysfunctional family? Is Lot a good example of how a decent father should handle his virgin daughters? \\"The God Delusion\\" and other books like it are needed to help us deal with the moral and intellectual emergency state now extant and to prevent, if we can, Fundamentalism from taking away our liberty and freedom. People may dislike Atheists, but you know, Atheists don't bomb anyone, behead anyone, stone anyone, burn anyone at the stake, crucify anyone, or fly planes into skyscrapers.life after death.

B0009I7NOO|5.0|Oasis have never sounded so good. Gem and Andy have really found their feet in the band now and this is an improvement on their previous album 'The Heathen Chemistry'. These two bring something that make Oasis more of a complete band and not just the Noel and Liam show. While I still find 'Definitely Maybe' the best Oasis album, the Manchester lads have gone full circle with their career and nearly matched it with this effort. It almost feels like they have started their careers again and from here the sky is the limit. More great live shows and #1 singles and I really think they can reach the heights of the mid 90's again and keep their feet grounded at the same time.<br /><br />This is a great album from beginnig to end. The songs flow perfectly into one another and sounds like the most complete album Oasis have ever released. It opens up with 'Turn Up The Sun', which at first doesn't sound like Oasis until the first chords kick in after a great opening few seconds. Written by Andy Bell it is top 3 best tracks on the album.<br /><br />'Mucky Fingers' written by Noel is a cross between the Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan<br /><br />'Lyla' the first single, is a good song, not great, very simple but typical Oasis in its chord playing, also written by Noel.<br /><br />'Love Like a Bomb' written by Liam and Gem is a highlight of the album, a mixture of acoustic guitar and piano it is Liam's vocal on this track that got my attention, much like the way in which he sings 'songbird'.<br /><br />'The Importance Of Being Idle' Noel sings on this track which he also wrote, the second single off the album, sounds a little bit like 'the Doors'.<br /><br />'The meaning of Soul' is a two minute fast acoustic driven song by Liam with a simple drum beat, unlike anything I have ever from Oasis before. It sounds familiar but I can't quite put my finger on it. Catchy and stays in your head.<br /><br />'Guess God Thinks I'm Abel', another Liam penned track, has a cool tempo and mellow atmosphere. A slow song, not one of Liams best unfortunately.<br /><br />'Part Of The Queue' Noel was inspired to write this song after being forced to stand in a real long queue just to buy a pint of milk. He considered stealing it even with his millions in the bank. Has a 70's feel to it, almost like a protest song.<br /><br />Along with track 1, this song 'Keep The Dream Alive' is one of my favourites, also written by Andy Bell, this guy writes good songs. A very happy tune with good guitar and Liam's vocal sounds great.<br /><br />'A Bell will Ring' is Gem's contribution to the album. A pure rock n' roll song, in the mould of 'Hung In A Bad Place' from Heathen Chemistry.<br /><br />That brings us to the albums closer, 'Let There Be Love' the best song on the album and arguably the best Oasis song ever. It features Liam and Noel on vocal and I rate it right up there along with the Beatles 'A Day In the Life'. John and Paul could have easily have written this song,but it is written by Noel. The third single, this has the potential to pull in fans much like the way 'Wonderwall' did.<br /><br />The album sounds great, the production and mixes are perfect. The band opted to hire D. Sardy to produce and mix the album for them, instead of doing it themselves and it has really paid off for them. He was also responsible for producing Jet and really knows how to acheive this kind of sound. Also lending out on this album is Zak Starkey on drums, son of the legendary Beatles drummer Ringo, he is a more complete drummer than Alan White.<br /><br />The album features a bonus DVD with interesting interviews with the band and a 6 page booklet with complete lyrics for all songs.

Also lending out on this album is Zak Starkey on drums, son of the legendary Beatles drummer Ringo, he is a more complete drummer than Alan White.  <br /> <br />The album features a bonus DVD with interesting interviews with the band and a 6 page booklet with complete lyrics for all songs. A great buy...
B000007O9L|5.0|Recorded live in Paris and Amsterdam, Stripped sets a mellow mood for any Blues fan. Reminiscent of the MTV Unplugged albums of the early 90's, this album has been widely over looked. It contains a great selection of classic Stones songs including Let it Bleed, Dead Flowers, and a haunting version of Slipping Away. This album is quite delightful and a shining light for anyone's collection.
B000HEWEE4|4.0|Yeah, there are holes in the plot but then again the whole plot is pretty fantastic.  Give up logic and enjoy the film.  Better still, curl up with your honey and enjoy the film...
B000GY729M|1.0|This is the worst sophimore album I have ever heard. Sam's town has no substance. The killers have traded their hard edge synth/electo/new wave rock sound for ridiculus melodies and laughable choruses. They have traded their 'hot fuss' lyrical genius for simple over-dramatic rhymes. The killers will clearly gain a huge new fanbase of nickleback, creed and top 40 enthusiasts. This album is sure to get airplay on all the wrong airwaves. If you enjoy indie & new wave sounds and the excellent way the killers fused them in hot fuss this album will disappoint the entire way through. It sounds as if the killers have tried to apply Queen's and Springsteen's sure fire recipe for popular, stadium ready anthems and completely lost everything that made them unique and original. <br /> <br />God, i still love hot fuss. Nothing sounds quite like it... and apparently nothing will ever again until these jokers revert back to the hard edge synths and driven pop rock that rightfully earned the acclaim of their first album.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|Great vocals.  Jazzy and sultry.  Just buy it!!!
B000000OMP|5.0|Slide It In  represents (to me at least) David Coverdale and Whitesnake at their peak.  While this album didn't quite set any sales records when it initially came out back in 1984, word of mouth spread about it and it reached respectable gold status here in the states.  After the self titled 1987 album blew things wide open, people would go back and check out Slide It In and push it's overall sales to double platinum.<br /><br />As a few other reviewers have already mentioned, this album was originally recorded back in 1983 and came out in Britain first.  On the advice however of Whitesnake's new A&R rep with their new lable Geffen, David Coverdale would re-mix the album, add some flashier guitar parts on the tracks and re-sequence the song listing.<br /><br />I have never heard the original British version, but most Whitesnake fans seem to agree that it's the superior version compared to the American version.<br /><br />Even if you end up getting the more widely available American version, you'll end up getting one of the best hard rock albums to ever be made.<br /><br />While David Coverdale's sexist at times lyrics can get kind of goofy here and there, his surefire delivery and amazing range manages to sell every single line with the utmost sincerity and authority.<br /><br />The backing band is amazing as usual with keyboards by ex-Deep Purple member Jon Lord, seering guitar leads by John Sykes (on the American verion only) and thundering drum work by Cozy Powell. The bass work is a little lower in the mix compared to their prior albums to this, but it still is rumbling and moves things along quite nicely.<br /><br />Slide It In represents to me a perfect balance between their blues/rock past and the much more commercial direction that they would go in with their next release.<br /><br />Any discerning hard rock or 80's metal fan would do wise to snatch up this album as I feel that it greatly represents this band at the height of their musical prowess.
B000IOM0YM|4.0|Great... Kiss has a new dvd out I hope this smart choice that Kiss has made will get other bands like Cheap Trick to release their long awaited  Live At Budokan on dvd without buying the bootleg versions. Kisstory at  their best ....
B000002J1L|4.0|\\"Nursery Cryme\\" was first released in 1971, and the first Genesis record to feature Phil Collins on drums and Steve Hackett on guitar, while it's the third album for vocalist Peter Gabriel, bassist Mike Rutherford and keyboardist Tony Banks. It's progressive rock with storyteller lyrics, and its both great fun and a loose and atmospheric recording. <br /> <br />There are seven tracks on the album, opening with the famous ten minute epic \\"The Musical Box\\". It's a strange story of a boy whose ghost is trapped in a music box that plays \\"Old King Cole\\", and who ages rapidly as the song goes on. It's a moody piece, with both very light and very heavy moments, and is probably one of my favorite Genesis tracks, and a great introduction to the lineup.  <br /> <br />\\"For Absent Friends\\" follows, Phil Collins first ever lead vocal, describing a peaceful Sunday morning on the way to church to an equally peaceful melody.  <br /> <br />\\"The Return of the Giant Hogweed\\" is a little more raw, with some catchy guitar by Steve Hackett, some grunting bass from Mike Rutherford and Peter Gabriel's angriest vocals on the record. The lyrics are very \\"Day of the Triffids\\", featuring killer plants taking over England. <br /> <br />\\"Seven Stones\\" is a mellower tale of an old man who earns his keep by pretending to be a seer, but relies more on chance than anything else. There's an intense mellotron solo toward the end played by Tony Banks, which I quite like.  <br /> <br />\\"Harold the Barrel\\" is a quirky, poppy tune with an almost danceable beat, a catchy but clunky piano rhythm and lyrics about a man about to jump off a window ledge. It's the sort of song I'd half expect a group like Franz Ferdinand to do a cover of. I'd reckon it'd be quite a hit if they did, actually. <br /> <br />\\"Harlequin\\" is probably one of the lightest sounding tracks on the album, and I'm sure I've heard it on oldies radio before. I love the harmonies Phil Collins and Peter Gabriel do together, and the keyboard runs Tony Banks does in the background, but it's hardly my favorite song from the album. <br /> <br />The album closes with \\"The Fountain of Salmacis\\", a song based on a pretty strange Greek myth. It's got these great swells of mellotron at the start, which are pretty cool. <br /> <br />The booklet for the 1994 remaster features full lyrics (some which almost read like a script), with the occaisonal story or legend behind the song, which is handy for context, plus some illustrations that look almost like they're from an old fashioned book of fairy tales. <br /> <br />It's all worth a listen to progressive rock fans, though if you're just getting into Peter Gabriel's Genesis I'd recommend getting an album like \\"The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway\\" first.
B000I2J5UG|5.0|This Cd blows me away everytime I listen to it.  It reminds me a lot of Queen in that it is very theatrical- I would love to see them take it on the road as a rock/goth opera!  In a genre where every band pretty much sounds the same, MCR has gone so far above and beyond the usual, they don't even fit the genre anymore.  I am so impressed and excited about this CD!
0345440900|5.0|My husband and I absolutely swear by this book. It is the best method for teaching a newborn to self-sooth. We tell everyone we know about the success we've had with this book. My son is now 15 months and we are expecting our second child in three months. We plan to use the Baby Whisperer methods again with our second baby. It is such a LIFE SAVER!!
B000005RFQ|2.0|Rumor has it that remastering Born Again allowed the album to finally live up to its name.  What I remember when I played the vinyl in 1983 was a sonic mudslide pouring out of my speakers.  Beyond that, I thought the combination of Sabbath's predilection for doom and gloom and Ian Gillan's cleverly twisted musings was the ultimate odd couple.  Listening to it (yes, the vinyl edition) decades later hasn't changed my opinion of the music, and I doubt even a perfect remastering job could fix the inherent flaws in this short and wisely forgotten marriage.
B00005LC4B|1.0|Having seen and enjoyed the original Cape Fear, which is quite a thriller, I thought I'd enjoy this.  Wrong! <br /> <br />This is not a thriller.  It's an exercise in nastiness, cruelty, viciousness, hysteria and wild overacting.  Scorcese takes a hideous villain and tries to make him somehow admirable -- but he's not.  He's scuzzy, and remains so.  And the family that's being tormented is portrayed as a bunch of awful people as well. <br /> <br />After being disgusted by this movie and its sick characters, I read a comment by Scorsese that he didn't like any of the characters in the movie and wished he could have killed off all of them, but the studio wouldn't let him.  It shows.  He invented these people from scratch, and they're all revolting. <br /> <br />De Niro is frantic but throughly uninteresting as the villain.  And while it's dragging us through the mud, the movie moralizes all the while that it's meant to \\"educate\\" us.   <br /> <br />This is a bad movie, plain and simple.  Mean and nasty, ugly, uninspired, perverted and in a twisted way arrogant, preachy and moralistic.  Like filth lecturing you how to be clean.  Sorry, Marty, this is scummy junk. <br /> <br />Stay away. <br />
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|Yes, the scenery is beautiful, but the characters are so dull...I admit, I am a big fan of the 1995 BBC version, and I really, really tried to watch this with an open mind, but I was bored to tears after a half hour. The giggling Bennet sisters got on my nerves, and Mr. Darcy's character was so wooden. Save your money and rent it.
0790731452|4.0|PUT SIMPLY --  A TOTALLY MAD [as in insane] ALIENS-ATTACK-THE-EARTH SPOOF!     For some of us this film is a real hoot -- a silly and playful romp not to be taken seriously except in the way of being enjoyed. For others it is a dull and stupid film which seems rather pointless and unbelievable. To those among us I say this --- isn't this the 'Comic Book' genre? As for myself, I belong in the first group but there are those among us that feel quite differently about 'Mars Attacks', and for them the reasons are justified. For me, 'Mars Attacks' is a visual treat that is just plain silly and ridiculous fun. The permutations that this movie swims through are sheer madness in a terribly delightful sort of way. For anyone who ever considered sending a mail-order set of Slim Whitman records to someone s/he didn't like, this film is a TREAT -- A sort of trip through Director Tim Burton's very vivid imagination which he has generously shared with us through this film.     THE VERY ECLECTIC ALL-STAR CAST:     Jack Nicholson as the President and Rod Steiger as General Decker are wonderfully silly together as they represent a comical clash between civilian and military control of strategic weapons. Sylvia Sidney as Grandma Norris is simply delightful. She and her grandson Richie Norris played by Lukas Haas become the most unlikely of heros with an even more unlikely weapon that saves all of us from suffering the same fate as Congress - vaporization!     Jack Nicholson - Art Land / President Dale   Glenn Close - Marsha Dale   Annette Bening - Barbara Land   Pierce Brosnan - Donald Kessler   Danny DeVito - Rude Gambler   Jim Brown - Byron Williams   Martin Short - Jerry Ross   Michael J. Fox - Jason Stone   Pam Grier - Louise Williams   Tom Jones - Himself   Sarah Jessica Parker - Nathalie Lake   Natalie Portman - Taffy Dale   Sylvia Sidney - Grandma Norris   Rod Steiger - Gen. Decker   Paul Winfield - Gen. Casey   Joe Don Baker - Glenn Norris   Lukas Haas - Richie Norris   Lisa Marie - Martian Girl      -----> OVERALL      This film gets strongs reactions. You will either love it or hate it. If you love it, you'll enjoy enjoy viewing it often.      -----> THE DVD & SPECIAL FEATURES     Excellent transfer. DVD plays either as Widescreen or Fullscreen on the same disk. It also boasts; Interactive Menus, Production Notes, Scene access, 2 Theatrical Trailers, Language and Subtitles in French and Spanish.     I personally would have liked to have seen a \\"making of Mars Attacks!\\" featurette, and some interviews of what was perhaps the most amazing cast of actors ever assembled for a silly film since \\"Its A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World\\".      -----> LAST THOUGHT      Mars Attacks! is to \\"Independence Day\\" what \\"Dr. Strangelove\\" was to \\"Fail Safe\\". All four of these films were created independently but are inexoribly connected and compared to each other due to their timing and plots. Just as \\"Dr. Strangelove\\" was lampooning other cliches [NOT \\"Fail Safe\\" which was its contemporary, NOT predecessor], \\"Mars Attacks!\\" was setting aim on the 1950s flying saucer films such as \\"Earth vs. The Flying Saucers\\". In fact, there are specific scenes in \\"Mars Attacks!\\" like the one at the Washington Monument where the flying saucer was knocking down the monument on top of a boy scout troop that are direct take-offs.    If you enjoyed seeing films, such as, 'Airplane', 'It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World' or 'The Russians Are Coming', you will probably find a great deal you like about 'Mars Attacks'.
B000002JKA|5.0|If you are a fan of metal in general; progressive or not, you owe it to yourself to purchase this album. One of Dream Theater's finest works, this album is considerably darker then its predecessor, Images and Words. The songwriting on this album shows incredible maturity from I&W, with songs being much more emotionally-based and personal. Just listen to \\"Voices\\", one of the finest tracks on the album. <br /> The musicianship on this album is of course second to none. John Petrucci's guitar work is unbelievable on this album, as it is on all Dream Theater albums. He breaks out the 7 string for the first time on this album, and it contributes a lot to the heaviness of the album. However, in my opinion this album is dominated by Mike Portnoy's drums. Portnoy is without a doubt one of the finest drummers I've ever heard, and his drums stand out on this album.  <br />Overall, this album is in my opinion much better then Images and Words, which is quite an amazing album in itself. If you have only heard some of the later work by Dream Theater and wrote them off, CHECK THIS ALBUM OUT NOW! You will not regret it!
B00005ASGG|5.0|<br />PUT SIMPLY -- THIS IS A FILM ABOUT A SECRET PARADOX THAT ONLY THE AUDIENCE WILL KNOW ABOUT FULLY <br /> <br />\\"NOTHING IS TO GOOD FOR THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE\\" are about the last spoken words of the film, 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance', and concisely quantify the paradox that gives meaning to the entire film from beginning to end.  <br /> <br />JOHN FORD SHOWS US AN AWESOME STORY THAT TAKES PLACE IN THE OLD WEST  <br /> <br />The melancholy nocturnal atmosphere of the film says it all -- the glory days of the OLD WEST were over, but many of the participants in the game of life didn't know it yet. Like the dinosaurs, characters such as Liberty Valance and Tom Doniphon were living on borrowed time. Their whole way of life was about to be completely overrun while they and others like them were literally buried alive as the west became more civilized and user-friendly -- to the new users. Settlers from the back east with families brought with them an avalanche of new churches, retail merchants, the railroad, schools, roads and all of the trappings of turn-of-the-century civilized living. This rather rapidly cuased the need for infrastructure, \\"law and order\\" and ultimately statehood. On the subject of statehood, the old west took its stand in this film -- and lost!  <br /> <br />In taking this stand we have a triangle. Not the love triange between Doniphon, Stoddard and Hallie, but rather the power struggle triangle between Doniphon, Valance and Stoddard. Stoddard [James Stewart] was alone in the fight, but represented the interests of the majority of the people. They were a silent frightened majority who had yet to overpower the small vocal minority that was characterized and embodied in the person of Liberty Valance, [Lee Marvin] and funded by the hidden power of \\"The Cattlemen\\".  <br /> <br />Speaking logically, Doniphon [JOHN WAYNE] had every personal reason to side with the Cattlemen.  <br /> <br /> -----> To begin with, Doniphon's roughand ready macho western lifestyle was just as doomed as their's if Statehood arrived. Like the cattlemen, Doniphon believed that men should fight their own battles, and the hand gun was his and their weapon of choice. If law and order arrived, the great equalizer that was found in the hired gun would be erased by lawman, judges, prisons and executions.  <br /> <br />Although Doniphon employed no hired guns, he and his top hand, Pompey, could easily stand up to a greater number of hired guns giving Doniphon the luxury of having a rich man's power with only a poor man's wallet.  <br /> <br />-----> Secondly, Ransom Stoddard [Jimmy Stewart] was increasingly becoming a rival for Doniphon's \\"girl\\", Hallie, as the story progressed. If Stoddard failed, he [Stoddard] would be dead or heading back east -- probably alone, away from Hallie, who apparently saw in Stoddard something Tom Doniphon didn't possess, and Doniphon certainly knew it. What was that? Only Hallie could say. <br /> <br />That Doniphon does, in the end, back Stoddard in a very personal way says something about both Stoddard and Doniphon, both of whom had very decent characters, though Doniphon was reluctant to admit this even to himself.   <br /> <br /> <br />THE MAJOR PLAYERS - THE PRODUCTION CREW & THE MAJOR AWARDS - ->  <br /> <br />-----> THE PLAYERS  <br /> <br />John Wayne - Tom Doniphon  <br />James Stewart - Ransom Stoddard  <br />Vera Miles - Hallie Stoddard  <br />Lee Marvin - Liberty Valance  <br />Edmond O'Brien - Dutton Peabody  <br />Andy Devine - Link Appleyard  <br />Ken Murray - Doc Willoughby  <br />John Carradine - Maj.

078062999X|5.0|In a nutshell -- this version of Hamlet left me speachless; Branagh's interpretation is magnificent!!  Not to be missed!  I highly recommend!!!
B000H305U0|3.0|In my opinion, there are only 5 or 6 songs on here that I like, and I could listen to the whole CD straight thru but I would have to skip songs to really enjoy it. Not a bad buy, but not every song is good.

0553212737|5.0|I'm reading Emma again for the third time.  It happened like this: I thought I'd try an audio book on CD for the first time, something to listen to in the car besides music.  Scanning the shelves at the local bookstore, I saw loads of contemporary best sellers, self and financial help, new age and evangelical Christian spirituality, and Jane Austen's Emma in MP3 format, all on one disc.  Austen!  Water in the desert!  I scooped her up.<br /><br />For the last week I've been listening to her in my car.  At the beginning it was without much concentration.  Over the next few days my attention gradually increased.  Now I'm hooked.  Down the throat.  Through the gut.  Again.  It happens to me every time I return to Jane.  I just can't get enough.  The last two nights I've gone to bed reading ahead of where I've listened.  Even though the story is coming back to me, I'm still taken by it, hook line & sinker.  Jane's reeling me in, and the line is utterly slack.<br /><br />Now, I am a guy.  I break out in hives if I happen to accidentally brush a romance novel.  As far as I am concerned, bodice rippers where the tall olive skinned duke inevitably has his forceful yet gentle way with the heroine are good only as ammunition with which to tease the women in my life who enjoy such tripe.  Having said this, I realize a lot of people also refer to Jane Austen as \\"Chick Lit,\\" equating her with the likes of Nicolas Sparks.  For the record, those people are on crack.<br /><br />Austen is much more a comedic writer than a writer of what we call romances.  She is simply a hoot.  Subtle disjunctures and ironies build to exquisite crescendos.  She has me laughing every other page.  Her characters, even her unpleasant and ridiculous ones, tend to breed sympathy.  Like most of my favorite books, she creates worlds, or a world, really (all of her books are set in the same historic and geographic milieu,) which comforts and gladdens.  The feeling I get from her is much like the feeling I get when I read Tolkien describe the Shire or Last Homely House, or something like the children's book Frog & Toad to my niece.<br /><br />It's an eating poached egg on toast snuggled up inside under a quilt on the couch with a cup of tea on a rainy day kind of feeling.  (Don't you just love English prepositions and phrasal verbs?  Try doing that in French!  Austen and phrasal verbs: two of the many reasons English speakers ought to rejoice in their language, I say!)<br /><br />Anyway, during all of her stories, including Emma, Europe was being blown apart by the Napoleonic Wars, and the only oblique references in any of her stories to that maelstrom is that Great Britain has a mobilized Army (Pride & Prejudice) and an active Navy (Persuasion.) The reason the military is important has nothing to do with Austerlitz, Waterloo,  Trafalgar or any of that nonsense.  Rather, it is that both services have officers which make very suitable suitors for women of her heroines' social positions (Lt. Wickham & Capt. Wentworth, for example.)<br /><br />Some brand this awful: elitist, sexist, parochial. I, for one, find it beautiful.  Small, intimate, ordered, secure, anchored.  Very human and sane, that is.<br /><br />What matters most is not what some silly diminutive one armed Corsican with maniacal delusions of world conquest is doing; no.  What really matters is whether and how Mr. Woodhouse takes his gruel, or if Mr. Elton will propose to Harriet.  Or if Mr. Knightly and Mrs. Weston have come to visit yet, today.  Will Mr. Frank Churchill come, and what is he like?  Has Emma truly foiled Mr. Martin's advances on her friend, he being an entirely unsuitable yeoman farmer?  Harriet must marry a gentleman, you see.<br /><br />Just so. Indeed, these are truly the things that mattered- and still matter- most.  Don't let the history books and the reverse snobbery of some critics fool you.<br /><br />Instead go read this book, and every other that Jane wrote, and prepare to be enchanted.Jane wrote, and prepare to be enchanted.
B0001MDPV8|5.0|Great music on here, the 10th anniversary addition of \\"Illmatic\\" displays a nice glimpse of the mc Nas was, is, and always will be, we already know how great he was on \\"Illmatic\\" but he shows on \\"On The Real\\" and \\"Star Wars\\" that he's still the top poet of hip-hop today, a must have for all hip-hop fans, I got this in a clearance bid and I'm sure happy about that
B00005JPAM|5.0|THE QUEEN seems like one of those biographical features that would be difficult to hold anyone's interest - on the surface, without the benefit of knowing much about the content.  Queen Elizabeth II is not exactly a figure who generates anything but a response of boredom, so flat and uninteresting is her persona.  But enter Helen Mirren, one of the finest actresses on the screen today, and this potentially boring potentate becomes a vibrantly detailed and fascinating portrait of a queen at odds with the times.  It is a staggering achievement.<br /><br />Director Stephen Frears, using a superb script by Peter Morgan, details the time from the election of Labor Party Prime Minister Tony Blair (a brilliant Michael Sheen) to that momentous international outpouring of grief and love that followed the tragic death of Princess Di in 1997, showing the bifurcation of response between the Royals and the People as represented by Blair.  Instead of the insensitive cold figure that the world witnessed as QE II, Mirren shows us that the woman who is Queen actually had feelings for her grandchildren, a respect for her station as royalty,  and was gradually responsive to the cry of the people via Blair's influence, allowing the world to pay proper tribute to a heroine.  The ogres in the Balmoral Castle were in fact Prince Phillip (James Cromwell) and the Queen Mum (Sylvia Syms) abetted by the very proper Robin Janvrin (Roger Allam) and the wishy washy Prince Charles (Alex Jennings).<br /><br />The entire production is beautifully filmed with the use of clips from Princess Di's life (and death) instead of creating an actress role to portray her - a very wise choice.  The musical score by Alexandre Desplat is superb (with a little help from Verdi's 'Libera Me' as sung by Lynn Dawson and the BBC chorus for the funeral portion).  But indeed the accolades go to Helen Mirren in an Oscar worthy performance - with the very strong counterbalance by Michael Sheen.  An excellent film about a moment no one will ever forget.  Grady Harp, October 06ll ever forget.  Grady Harp, October 06
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|The Black Parade is a really good album from My Chemical Romance.  Maybe better than Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge.  Here's a review of the songs: <br /> <br /> <br />The End:  8/10- It's basically an intro for the cd.  It starts with acoustic guitar, a first for MCR.  It's good for an intro. <br /> <br />Dead: 10/10-I love this song!  It's really good and catchy. <br /> <br />This Is How I Disappear:  10/10- Another really good song.  Really catchy chorus. <br /> <br />The Sharpest Lives: 10/10- Really good.  Kind of in the spirit of \\"To The End\\" from TCFSR.  It sounds a lot like their old stuff. <br /> <br />Welcome To The Black Parade: 9/10- Their first single.  It's a good song, but I don't really care for the singing/talking in the beginning.  It gets good though after it starts up.  <br /> <br />I Don't Love You: 9/10- This is truly a \\"love and leave\\" song and another first for MCR.  I was really impressed with it and it made me even tear up a little bit.  Good song. <br /> <br />House of Wolves: 8/10- This is a good song, but not one of my favorites.  It reminds me of a swing kind of song. <br /> <br />Cancer: 7/10- Nothing really special about it, but I like the verses somewhat.   <br /> <br />Mama: 10/10- This song is very cool.  In the style of \\"The devil went down to Georgia.\\"   I love the beginning especially and the way Gerard says stuff in this song. <br /> <br />Sleep: 7/10- This was the only other song that I didn't really care for.  It's a filler in the album if not the song Cancer.  It's not HORRIBLE, but nothing really sticks out about it either. <br /> <br />Teenagers: 8/10- A fun song.  It sounds country and is a bit funny.  It will make you want to sing along. <br /> <br />Disenchanted: 9/10- This song starts out slow and gets a little faster.  I really like the chorus.  Good if you like slow songs, which I do. <br /> <br />Famous Last Words: 9/10- Great way to \\"technically end the album\\" (There's a hidden track that is number 14.) Catchy chorus. <br /> <br />Blood (Hidden Track): 7/10- Yes, there is a hidden song.  The song doesn't start until the track get to about 1:30. It's a fun song and kind of reminds me of a commercial song, but creepy.  Nothing that great, but they wanted to end the cd in a funny way. <br /> <br />Great album from MCR, with a mishap of two filler songs.  But that's not bad.  And as a reminder, the album does have language and parental advisory, so you have to be 18 to buy it yourself!   (Or order it online so your parents don't know.)
B000AMJDHY|2.0|I admit I enjoyed their first single, and the theatrics of their performances and videos as well.  I had high hopes for this CD, but it's the equivalent of chewing sugar cubes.  Sugar sounds nice, but when you've got nothing but sugar in your mouth, and it just sends up all gritty and syrupy in your mouth....it's not all that great. <br /> <br />They have a fun sound and for that I will give them credit, but they have a major lack of musical creativity.  Half regurgitated Fall Out Boy emo sound, and half regurgitated 80's pop is not really a good combo.  Both are fun, and have appeal, but at the same time too much of it is just a tad annoying.   <br /> <br />Panic! is ultimately just another trend, or a rip-off of a trend actually, but very little mainstream music isn't.  If they had the musical talent to back it up I'd compare these guys to a David Lee Roth era Van Halen because of their energy and theatric's.  But since they lack in the musical execution they're little more than David Lee Roth...post Van Halen, minus the spandex.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|I'm so glad in all the chaos of new music singers on coming onto the seen that Sarah can hold her own. This Album is beautifully done and I would high recommend it to anyone with taste.
B000I5Y8ZU|4.0|For me MCR has always been one of those bands that's always been full of unrealized potential.  The band is amazing.  There really isn't another band on any scene that plays as well and as full as this band does.  The lead vocalist is unique, their lyrics are interesting to say the least, but with each release it either seems like they're held back or spilling out everywhere with reckless abandon. <br /> <br />This album isn't any different....but it is a major jump forward from their last 2 albums.  This album is a bit more produced, and some songs are held back, but there is so much sound on this album it's hard to say that the producing is a bad thing.  The concept of this album is great.  I'm not a big fan of concept albums, but this whole package ties itself together so well it puts the band on another level above all of the other \\"emo\\" scene bands they represent.   <br /> <br />I wouldn't even say they've Reinvented themselves on this album, but instead they've reconnected themselves with a rich history of rock music.  The sound is so epic it really does ring hints of Queen, Aerosmith, Van Halen, and even Led Zepplin in parts.  MCR certainly hasn't proven it's place quite yet, but they're well on their way.   <br /> <br />I'd actually compare this album to Guns N Roses Use Your Illusions 1&2.  If you consider the sound of Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge (which was OK, but not one of my favorites) it's got the same balls to the wall sound as GNR's Appetite for Destruction.  But with Use Your Illusions GNR kept their fury but created a much more epic sound that carried emotion other than angst.  The Black Parade has broken from Three Cheers in much the same way, and if the band can hold it together I think they may have a chance to develop into the band everyone hoped GNR would become before Axel happened. <br /> <br />Almost 5 stars, but not quite.  I wasn't a fan of Three Cheers, but this album is great so I have to believe there's still room for more improvement.

0553588486|2.0|I was brought to reading this book becasue I was told it was \\"different\\" from other fantasy series, that it was more real.  I must agree that it is different, and earthier, but that still doesn't make me not regret buying this book.<br /><br />I have a problem with writer's who canot write a decently intelligent character.  We know who is supposed to be the \\"intelligent\\" fellow.  But 3/4 of the way through this book, he is only alive by a series of narrow escapes so unlikely that it strains any belief.<br /><br />So, to make this character \\"appear\\" intelligent, he gives almost every other character the IQ of a moldy grapefruit.  I never bought it. His fans say he doesn't telegraph coming events.  I think he is practically a semiphore.  He doesn't rely on coincidence's.  The whole book is filled with one coincidence after another.<br /><br />I just gave up in my second attempt to complete this book.  The first time I read it halfway and gave up, the second, It was in book on tape form.  It was only one of about 3 books I couldn't even stomach on tape and finish.
1905236042|5.0|I'm a kids yoga instructor, and use cards with my classes almost weekly.  I'd been using the Kids Yoga Deck for years, and then I finally bought this deck.<br /><br />I much prefer the Yoga Pretzel deck, because they are twice the size of the others.  Also, the Pretzel deck shows cute drawings of different children doing the poses and the Kids Deck only shows unisex stick figures, which is less exciting for the kids.  The larger size of the cards, makes them easier for kids to see the pose and hold.  They are very colorful and lively, and will be the only cards I use for class now.<br /><br />Another big difference between the two decks is that the Yoga Pretzel deck contains cards with many yoga poses, and other cards with games and breathing exercises.  The Kids Yoga Deck only has cards for poses, and no games.<br /><br />I really recommend these cards for parents to use at home with their children.  Children can use them on their own too, and just mimic the kids on the cards.

0156027321|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. At first I was a little wary of it when I read the synopsis on the back: zoo animals, a boy, shipwreck, tiger. It all seemed so silly and bizarre, but once I stepped in to the magical world that belonged to Pi, I was addicted. I would not put the book down. Yann Martel possesses a brilliant style of writing that totally enraptures the reader. Life of Pi is one of those books which haunts you days after you have finished the last chapter, as your mind keeps going through all the events of Pi's life.
B00005JNS0|5.0|This animated movie was way above our expectations. It was very entairtaining both for us and or our 3 year old son. The way cars are presented with eyes and a talking mouth is so original and so nicely done.<br /><br />Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson lent his voice for this character) is  going up the steps of glory and fame really fast until he gets lost on Route 66 and find himself lost in Radiator Springs. There he meets with many different types of cars. Some of them used to be big stars long time ago. As a result he discovers that fame, front covers, and spotlights do not last forever. On the other hand he discovers values that are long lasting such as true friendship and family.<br /><br />I want to make a special mention to the little italian blue forklift and yellow italian car named Guido and Luigi respectively. Their characters are the funniest in the movie. They will really make you laugh.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie as family entertainment. By the way I do not think it is valid to compare this movie with other Disney classics. Pixar has started a new type of animated movies that is a league of its own and I am sure they will withstand the test of time becoming thus classics.

B000HBKCDC|2.0|<br /> <br />To give some perspective, I've become more and more of a Sarah Mclachlan fan as time has gone on.   <br /> <br />I enjoyed some tracks on Fumbling Towards Ecstasy but didn't really like the album as a whole, then with Surfacing I enjoyed the entire album but thought some tracks were phenomenal while others were just ok.  But with Afterglow she really hit her stride with me and I still consider it one of the best albums I own.  In fact, its several years later and I still listen to it on a regular basis.   <br /> <br />So I was understandably excited about this new album both because of my appreciation for Afterglow and 0because I love Christmas music in general.   <br /> <br />But it is, to quote the reviewer below, a \\"snoozefest\\".  I hate to be that rude but it really is an accurate description in that I found myself dozing off at several points while listening to it.  There is no question that Mrs. Mclachlan has talent and a certain style that is present in all her albums but the songs here don't have any emotional resonance to them.  So rather than being haunting like her other albums it just comes across as slow (which is what makes it a bit sleep inducing)   <br /> <br />Certainly, as the reviews on this page show, die hard Sarah Mclachlan fans will love it just as they love everything else she does.  But for casual fans or fans of Christmas music, you should probably pass. <br /> <br />One last note, most clear channel stations are previewing the album in its entirety (so you can go to the website and listen to the entire album streamed before you buy it).  I don't know how long this will be available but it's a nice service (I wish I'd found it before I bought to be honest).  If you don't know of a Clear Channel station in your area you can find it on Sacramento's Y92.5 website. <br />
B00003CX8Y|5.0|I'm a Disney nut anyway but this film along with The Lion King and The Little Mermaid are there greatest masterpieces!The score is breathtaking,the songs a mixture of fun(Belle,Be Our Guest,etc.),malice(The Mob Song),and grand emotion (Beauty and the Beast).This wonderful score quality has disappeared in recent years at Disney and sadly will probably never be seen again.But then,this type of movie,the Disney Musical,will probably never be seen again.Along with the spectacular score is the exquisite animation.This so-called \\"outdated\\"style,the 2-D style,is infinitely superior to the cold,unimaginative,3-D style that is now the rage.With the exception of the Pixar films and the first shrek,these movies are generally atrocious.They have none of the warmth and astounding emotional quality that this film posseses in abundance.Also,the voices in this film are perfect,and being a M*A*S*H fan,I get quite a kick out of hearing David Ogden Stiers as Cogsworth,the stuffy clock.This movie is a true classic from start to finish,and with this spectacular 2-Disc Platinum Edition DVD,the film can be viewed in all it's glory.The extras are perfect and should not be missed.Also,the picture is restored to crystal clear perfection,and there is a new song incorporated to complete the experience!Get this along with the special edition soundtrack.You wont regret it!
B000H305U0|1.0|When I first heard \\"SexyBack\\" I thought the person singing was a woman. I am not making this up and I am not trying to be funny. Then I realized it was Justin Timberlake. Justin comes from a long line of hardcore, rough and tough, balls to the wall, in your face muscians. He follows in the footsteps of Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash, Keith Richards, Jim Morrison, Gregg Allman, Leslie West (Mountain), John Bonham, Bohn Scott, Keith Moon, Ron \\"Pigpen\\" McKiernan,  Ozzy Osbourne, James Hetfield, Chris Cornell and Kim Thayil (soundgarden). Keep on rockin' Justin!!!
B000I2J5UG|5.0|If you thought you knew My Chemical Romance, be ready to listen to a whole new band. The new album is amazing. I would place The Black Parade next to Pink Floyd's The Wall. When I first heard them say they were influenced by Floyd, and Queen, I had my doubts, but after listening I knew that they pushed the envelope of talent and have reached thier highest potential so far. If you love My Chemical Romance's music, get this album, you won't be disappointed. <br /> <br />\\"WE ARE ALL JUST A BLACK PARADE.\\"
0618680004|5.0|For the last few years, Richard Dawkins has been becoming more and more open and confrontational with his views on religion. A few of the essays in \\"A Devil's Chaplain\\" and this year's Channel Four documentary \\"The Root Of All Evil?\\" left no doubt as how he feels about the growing influence that the religious are having on society. And now he has produced a book on the subject.<br /><br />And what a fabulous book it is. Dawkins pulls no punches in his criticism of organised religion and the book will (hopefully) be seen as a call to arms for atheists everywhere. The churches have had things their way for far too long and it's time we stood up to their medieval beliefs.<br /><br />The core of the book is chapter four. Dawkins admits freely that it's impossible to prove the non-existance of a supernatural being, but he goes on to show that the existance of something like a god is very improbable. In the process he demolishes most of the common arguments in favour of god's existance.<br /><br />The rest of the book isn't as important as chapter four, but it's still a very enjoyable read. It will arm you with useful facts to use in discussions with religious people. One of the most interesting sections for me was the one showing that the founding fathers of the USA never intended it to be a christian nation. Another section takes a very funny look at the ludicrous suggestion that the Old Testament of the christian bible can be used as a basis for any sensible moral system.<br /><br />I know that Dawkins will largely be \\"preaching to the converted\\". It's unlikely that many religious people will read this book. But if you have any interest at all in the arguments against the existance of god or the huge damage that religion is doing to society, then you should really read this book.
B0006Z2KX4|2.0|A friend and I tried watching this film once again recently, but still we both find it irritating and unpleasant.  From the beginning, when Katharine Hepburn's character destroys other people's cars without a care, we found one scene after another tedious and unfunny.  The acting is fine, as could be expected from such greats as Hepburn and Cary Grant.  But the characters are not sympathetic, fun or interesting.  Grant's character is an unassertive, spineless person who is easily dominated.  Hepburn's character is blindly selfish. Who could care what happens to them?  The one interesting element is the acting that is done in proximity to a live leopard.
B0000033P2|5.0|It's a tough decision, but this is my favorite ELP album. Even if it just contained the \\"Endless Enigma\\" Suite, I would be content. The regal Hammond organ of Keith Emerson, Greg Lake's inimitable, powerful vocals and Carl Palmer's bashing of the drumkit equals the epitome of progressive rock to me. In other words, it don't get any better than this. This song causes a rush throughout my body that few others have. Not to say the other songs are lame...not at all! Just the mixture of classical and powerful rock rhythms captivates me (or is it catapults me?) \\"From the Beginning\\" is a great classic. I think every ELP fan has heard \\"Hoedown\\" and even their trademark \\"silly\\" song, \\"The Sheriff,\\" is enjoyable. This is a very strong release, meaning that each track is a valid piece of art. I also enjoy their first album, \\"ELP,\\" Tarkus\\" & \\"Brain Salad Surgery.\\" But this one just has that certain aura that keeps winning me back and cranking up the volume on the first three tracks. Three criminally talented musicians that rocked the world while incorporating classical passages. Not too many groups could boast about that! A major accomplishment. Essential.

B000FTWB7G|5.0|This album is great and proof that Evanescence is not a one-album-hit wonder, but that they are here to stay. Amy Lee has in my humble opinion the best voice in the current music industry. Her voice is full of emotion, power, vulnerability and longing for happiness and love. <br /> <br />While the whole album is great to listen to, one song is a stroke of genius as \\"The immortal\\" was in the previous album. \\"Lithium\\" is the best song on the album and I can't get enough of that song. Listen to it in the sample section and be hooked as I was.  <br /> <br />Enjoy.
B000I5YCCO|5.0|First of all I didn't purchase this album from Amazon. Instead, I pre-orded it on MusicCountry and had Taylor autographed it! I received the album today and...OMG it is sooo good I cant stop playing it. Taylor's got some real talent guys! Every song is so well written and sang by her and I can relate the songs to myself. My favorite songs are Picture to burn, Teardrops on my guitar, Stay beautiful and of coure the current hit Tim McGraw!

The leaders name is Hans...They got a[n]...arsenal here...missiles, automatic weapons and...plastic explosives...They're down to nine [of twelve] now...these guys are mostly European judging by their clothing labels and cigarettes.  They're well financed and very slick...Add all that up...you got some bad-a*s perpetrators.  They're here to stay.\\"<br /><br />The above is what New York city cop John McClane (Bruce Willis), who is on the building's 35TH floor, says on Christmas Eve by walky-talky to L.A. cop Al Powell (Reggie Veljohnson), McClane's cop outside the building contact.<br /><br />How did McClane get himself into this situation?  He has just arrived in L.A. and the Nakatomi Plaza building to spend the Christmas holidays with his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) who works for the Nakatomi Corporation and is at the Nakatomi office Christmas party with the other employees.  (The building is empty except for those employees at the office party.)  But as John waits for his wife's office party to end, \\"terrorists\\" take control of the building.  As Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) and his fellow \\"terrorists\\" take hostages (McClane's wife being one of them), the bare footed McClain slips away unnoticed with only his service revolver, his cunning, and plenty of chutzpah.  The fun and action now begin as the lone McClaine attempts to save his wife and the other hostages.<br /><br />As the movie continues, others outside the building get involved: the L.A. police department, the FBI, and the television news.<br /><br />Note that McClane is just not fighting the \\"terrorists\\" but fighting the building as well as he tries to maneuver his way through it.<br /><br />The acting is in a word: fantastic.  Whether Bruce Willis as John McClane is climbing up an elevator shaft, throwing himself off an exploding building, or racing barefoot across a floor littered with glass, he holds our attention while we as watchers hold our breath.

B00009Y3L4|5.0|`Cabaret' is a wonderful treat of a film, a wonderful treat mostly because I wasn't expecting to like it as much as I did.  Before `Chicago' and `Moulin Rouge' there was `Cabaret' which really isn't a musical in the lines of modern musicals such as the aforementioned.  `Cabaret' plays out more like a drama with musical numbers thrown in for some spice, and what spice they do add. <br /> <br />The film, based on `The Berlin Stories' by Christopher Isherwood, revolves around Brian (Michael York) who moves to Berlin in hopes to start teaching.  He meets Sally Bowles (Liza Minnelli) who works at the Kit Kat Klub and who offers him a room at her place of residence.  They soon fall in love, or lust, whichever you call it, and their story grows from there.  Taking place in the early 30's, the film centers around the rise of Nazi power in Berlin and the toll it takes on those who appose it.  It also tests the boundaries of sexuality and delivers a well rounded film that breaches many subjects not considered in cinema at the time. <br /> <br />The performances by the entire cast, but most notably Minnelli, are astounding.  Liza commands every second of the screen with her doe-eyed stare and confident while spunky personality.  Her Oscar win was above and beyond deserved.  Joel Grey also does a brilliant job with his Oscar winning roll as The Master of Ceremonies.  Together with Liza they delivered some of the greatest and most memorable musical numbers in cinema today.  And mention must be made of Bob Fosse who directs this film with such grace and maturity he draws you in with every frame.   <br /> <br />Any lover of the musical will enjoy this film from start to finish, but seriously, you don't have to be a musical lover to enjoy it for the film, like I said, is just a drama with musical numbers.  Unlike the recent `Phantom of the Opera' this entire film is NOT sung, just the numbers spread out throughout this gem of a film.  Watch out, once you visit the cabaret you may never want to leave!
B000G759LW|4.0|well i havent listened to the cd but i can say Hurt is one of the most heart felt and sad songs in music history and u know.....Aguilera has one of the best voiuces in  the bizness
B000002AVF|5.0|To me Mariah Carey can do no wrong.  Even the abomination that was `Glitter' still had her amazing vocals.  `Daydream' was my introduction to Mariah and so it still holds a special place in my heart.  This was the only album I listened to for quite a while (at least until Butterfly was released) and so the songs are almost ingrained in my head.  From the chart topping hit that was `Fantasy' to her brilliant cover of Journey's `Open Arms' that just creams in the power of her voice, `Daydream' as a whole is one solid album that delivers the goods track after track after track. <br /> <br />Probably one of the most famous collaborations in the history of modern music is `One Sweet Day', the gospel ballad between Mariah and the boys of Boyz II Men (another great R&B group).  The song itself is not only famous but deservedly so for it's as smooth and emotional as it is powerful and without a doubt brilliant.  Songs like `Underneath the Stars' and the closer `Looking In' show Mariah's silky soft side while the chart topper `Always Be My Baby' shows her spunky fun side (everytime I hear that \\"shodadup da, shodadup dadup dada\\" I can't help but get excited).  This is such a well rounded album it's sure to please just about everybody.
B000GW8RX4|3.0|Reviewing this dvd is sort of unfair because of several reasons. One being that this was filmed almost 30 years ago. The sound and video quality are actually pretty good. None of the other reviews even mention what the real problem is, which is the fact that the playing is very sloppy and obviously improvised through most of the show. I wanted to bang my head on the wall when the 3rd keyboard solo started in the much too long wankfest \\"Still I'm Sad\\". Unbelievable corny keyboard sounds and very poor arrangement musically as well, he had to spotlight each of the 5 keyboards in the arsenal- who cares? If you like listening to someone practicing scales with no acccompaniment you might enjoy these keyboard solos but they are bad , almost amateur sounding.   <br /> <br />Amazingly Dio sings on key, not sure how he pulled that off. Dio's slip up was doing vocal add libs on stage. This never works. Some of the lyrics delivered during these vocal improvs ruin the whole show in my opinion. I am a harsh judge once something stupid takes place in a concert. I think really good artists have very fine tuned \\"stupid detectors\\". Dio actually sings \\"Night People, walking the Earth\\" as a line in one of the songs, and it sounds really, really stupid. He also primps his hair several times which is very stupid looking. Some of these things are just part of the seventies, the thing is I listened to alot of this live rock stuff in the 70's and thought it was stupid back then as well. The studio albums were the only way to go since the artists took their time and cut out the BS. Why not just play the songs live? At least half of this show is unrehearsed buzz saw with tons of bum notes by Blackmore and goofy lyrics by Dio. I defy you to make out what Blackmore is actually playing on the first reconizable riff on \\"Still I'm Sad\\". It sounds like he has his fingers tied together, it is actually kind of funny. No wonder he always looks mad and ends up destroying his guitar at the end of everyshow. The man is one of the finest guitarists ever but unfortunately the bands he forms are plagued by bad concepts , bad lyrics/live singing, and sloppy live performance. His new band \\"Blackmore's Night\\" is tight but they sound like ABBA to me, way too watered down. Another conceptual blunder. <br /> <br />The moral folks is that 70's rock bands are better heard on studio cd's than seen live. The fashion disasters they committed and the endless aural wanking employed in these concerts just to fill time is sad and an indulgence in human stupidity. Other dvd's from this era to avoid are anything with Alvin Lee , ELP , Deep Purple (worst live vocals ever)- a special thanks goes to Glenn Hughes for wrecking the California Jam performance in 1974 by doing vocal add libbing and wearing white satin pants with no shirt. The only person that inspired back then was Ted Nugent. <br /> <br /> I can't believe none of the other reviews point out the fact that Blackmore is seriously out of tune on the intro to \\"Catch the Rainbow\\". He either could not tell or did not care because he did not bother to tune up. If you want to hear what an out of tune strat sounds like combined with too much phase shifter oh please won't you listen to this - thought you might be interested. You probably can't tell but I have been a Blackmore fan since 1973-studio recordings only. I thought \\"Made in Japan\\" blew even though it is considered one of the best live rock albums ever recorded. That might be true if you like drum solos and other barages of overamplified , out of tune sounds-including Gillan's parched, been living in a van too long vocals.  <br /> <br />You may want to rent this Rainbow dvd if you gotta see it. For once the price I paid for one of these concert dvd's was fair, since this sells for 9.99. Wonder what carcass Eagle Entertainment will dig up next- maybe Headeast live in Norman Oklahama complete with satin pants and dinner jackets-with no shirt on of course?
B00003CWNR|4.0|`The Cider House Rules' succeeds in delivering a touching and thought provoking melodrama that's only elevated by the prime acting on the part of it's entire cast.  As Homer, Toby Maguire gives one of his better performances, although I still feel that he comes across a bit nervous and uneasy, as if he's not too confident in his own acting ability.  This though is offset by the brilliant acting on the part of his co-stars, like Michael Caine and Charlize Theron who embody their characters and come across like the seasoned veterans we know they are. <br /> <br />The film follows Homer, a young orphan who was raised in the Maine orphanage by Dr. Wilber Larch (Caine) who takes care of the orphans as if they were his own and has trained Homer to take his place.  The one thing Homer could never get used to were the illegal abortions, safe as they were, that Wilber insisted on performing.  It's through one of these abortions that Homer meets Candy (Theron) and Wally (Rudd).  He decides to leave the orphanage with them and take work in an apple orchard.  This of course troubles Larch for Homer is the closest thing he's ever had to a real family. <br /> <br />This movie touches upon so many controversial subjects, from abortion (which is controversial no matter who you talk to) as well as incest and drug abuse, but it does so with taste and tact and an intelligence that makes this film that much more impressionable.  Upon the closing credits the viewer is given a lot to ponder, a lot to digest, but that's the tell tale sign that a movie of this caliber, a movie with a message, has done its job.  I personally think that `The Cider House Rules' is one of those movies that we all do well to experience for ourselves.
B000HIVO64|5.0|I have heard the future, and it is the music of Beck. The Information, with all its styles, sounds and scope, is at once stunning and wondrous. I believe it to be, in all its creative and inventive force, a truly singular achievement in modern music. In my opinion, it is music that we should not be hearing for another ten years. <br />And yet, here it is, upon us. Sting recently said that he was bored with rock n' roll. Certainly, he has not heard this broad stroke of genius.
B000E97HIA|5.0|Prince's `3121' is edgier and funkier than his previous release, `Musicology', which was also a great album.<br /><br />Among the dance/funk jams we've come to know and love from his royal purpleness are the title track, the catchy electro funk `Lolita' (Fuzzy bassline, organs, and a nice call and response bridge), the faintly `Kiss'- like `Black sweat', `Love', and the horn driven retro funk of `Get on the boat' (great undulating percussion from Sheila E) which will have you dancing, want to or not.<br /><br />The sunny bounce of `Fury' is the lone pop/rock song a-la `Cinammon girl' or `Raspberry beret'. Chock full of wailing guitar and energy, making for an incredibly catchy song telling of the fury of a woman scorned.<br /><br />After that incredibly sweaty session, slowing things down are `Te amo corazon' (a stunning jazzy/Spanish tinged song), the retro sounding falsetto sung, horn flitting `Satisfied', the gospel tinged (lyrically) `The word' and `Beautiful, loved & blessed', and the lush jazzy dreamy `The dance' (lovely piano and horn breaks) which has an awesome final minute or so, featuring some wailing and squealing we haven't heard from Prince in ages.<br /><br />This album became Prince's 5th US #1. It's great to see he is still relevant after all these years. Just ask Justin Timberlake!!
B000002J1S|5.0|As the years roll by and more time and distance allow for more and more comprehensive analysis and understanding of Rock's Golden Age (roughly 1966-1974), this emerges as the finest of the genre known as \\"concept albums\\" then being produced.  Concept albums, like The Who's \\"Tommy\\" or \\"Quadrophenia,\\" or Yes' \\"Tales From Topographic Oceans,\\" were an attempt to expand the story-telling and presentation vocabularies of Rock, kind of like little operas but with spotty lads with triple-necked Rickenbacker guitars instead of corpulent ladies singing.<br /><br />What makes this the best of that lot is the fact that the music is so focused and so good that it gathers a momentum that makes the story, on its face entirely obscure and incomprehensible, not just palatable but fascinating.  Essentially this is the story of a Puerto Rican proto-punk protagonist (admit it, you are already saying that 5 times fast) called Rael who descends into a kind of parallel reality underneath New York City after being struck by a mysterious, towering cloud of advancing debris on Times Square.  Strangely, when the Twin Towers fell and the big white cloud of stuff was chasing all those people down the streets of Manhattan, it kind of made me think of the Times Square sequence that begins \\"The Lamb\\".<br /><br />Over the course of the two records (now CDs), Rael's tale unfolds through some of the most lasting and magnificently cinematic music of the 1970s.  \\"Fly On a Windshield\\" (with a blistering solo from Steve Hackett), the hysterical \\"Grand Parade of Lifeless Packaging\\" (with vocal treatments by none other than Brian Eno), the utmost beauty of \\"Carpet Crawlers\\" (arguably the best song ever made by this group) and \\"The Lamia,\\"  every song is a gem and they all lock together (no breaks between tunes) to advance the story and bring what could have been a muddied mess into sharp focus, no easy achievement.<br /><br />In terms of the execution and the ambition, this has to be the best Rock \\"concept album\\" because it takes the most risks and therefore can offer the most rewards.  No wonder people are still clamoring for these guys to reunite and present this story in its entirety (as they did over 100 times in 1974-5) 30+ years later.oncept album\\" because it takes the most risks and therefore can offer the most rewards.

B00005V1B1|5.0|The Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary definition for MIRAGE reads like this:\\"an optical effect that is sometimes seen at sea, in the desert, or over a hot pavement, that may have the appearance of a pool of water or a mirror in which distant objects are seen inverted, and that is caused by the bending or reflection of rays of light by a layer of heated air of varying density; something illusory and unattainable like a mirage\\". <br />     I still vividly remember the first time I heard Camel - it was back in 2001, when they were touring the Americas (I'm from Brazil). I had never listened to them before and got completely hooked after watching their stunning live performance. <br />     That's why reviewing this album is so meaningful to me - 'cause that is the album I bought before going to the concert !!!! <br />     The jazzy arrangements, the IMMACULATE drum-bass inter-play, the melodic guitar solos, the sophisticated yet accessible alternations of pace and pitch, all combine to make this one of the most pleasurable surprises of Prog Music I've ever come across. <br />    Believe me - buy this album. You won't be disappointed. <br />    Lovers of Prog Rock must-have this album. You won't believe it the first time you listen to it. You'll think it's an illusion but it isn't!!! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

B000I0QK74|5.0|Whether you buy the original \\"A Christmas Album\\" or the new \\"James Taylor at Christmas\\" this is easily one of the best Christmas CD's you can find. 11 of the songs were produced by Dave Grusin, an accomplished composer and performing artist himself, \\"A Christmas Album\\" also features Natalie Cole, Chris Botti, John Pizzarelli and Mr. Grusin as collaborators.  The songs are as enchanting as they are laid-back. There are gorgeous pop-jazz versions of \\"Winter Wonderland,\\" \\"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town\\" and \\"The Christmas Song\\". There is also an engagingly simple new-age flavored version of \\"Auld Lang Syne\\", an Elizabethan flavored version of \\"Deck the Halls\\" (on the original ACA and on the special edition of JTAC) and a funk-blues version of \\"Jingle Bells\\". Dave Grusin and James Taylor make great partners, particularly on the gospel song \\"Go Tell It on the Mountain\\". While I like everything on this album, three songs stand out the most for me; the straightforward and graceful interpretations of \\"In the Bleak Midwinter\\" and \\"Some Children See Him\\" and the tropical-flavored cover of \\"Baby, It's Cold Outside\\". This duet with Natalie Cole is easily one of the best versions, right up there with Louis Armstrong & Velma Middleton's and Ray Charles & Betty Carter's.  \\"James Taylor at Christmas\\" includes the breathtakingly simple and beautiful cover of Joni's Mitchell's \\"River\\", produced by James Taylor and Charlie Paakkari, which manages to be sad and hopeful at the same time.  The same can also be said about \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,\\" produced by Russ Titelman and originally recorded for the album \\"October Road\\". JT subtly brings out the pathos in the song without losing its essential optimism.  There's a reason this music has proven so popular in any version, these performances are just so good, you can enjoy listening to them over and over, even after the Christmas Season is over.
B000HIVQK8|5.0|If you want The Beatles, buy one of their albums. If you can appreciate an artistic statement of spirituality in a world of stone and savor sweet slide guitar that enhances metaphysical lyrics, \\"Living In The Material World\\" by George Harrison may soothe yer soul.  This is a wonderful artistic statement by a pop star who found out that fame and wealth can be fun; but, it's not the path to enlightenment.      These newly remastered tapes bring out the best of what a handmade 1973 recording can do.  The package is worth the historical text and photos.  The DVD is short yet fun.  \\"Give Me Love\\" live in Japan, is a rare opportunity to see Harrison on stage.  I appreciated seeing the tuning of his dobro in the \\"Sue Me Sue You Blues\\" demo (look for the color of the guitar strings ends).      The best part of the whole reissue for me is to get copies of the excellent \\"Deep Blue\\", the b-side of \\"Bangla Desh\\" as well as another fun b-side \\"Miss O'Dell\\".  I have already warn out my old 45's of these rare tunes.  \\"Deep Blue\\" was inspired by the passing of Harrison's mother and may be one of his best overall recordings from my perspective.      Be here now.  Enjoy what is and what can be. Thank God for George Harrison. And, thanks to Olivia and Dhani Harrison for seeing this reissue released.  May there be more Apple Scruffs in the future! Om.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|This is a great CD, I'm still waiting for my CD (it's still in Texas!!!!) but I heard all the songs, they're awesome. Love the change in the music, the lyrics are great. I can't stop my player!! Just love it! I'm from Puerto Rico and I knew that this band existed because of their Helena video, and I'm in love with them (actually Gerard hehe) since then. But for me this is their best CD, the other ones are great too but I really love this one. <br /> <br />You won't regret it if you buy it.
B000GFLAI0|4.0|I prefer my Dylan &lt;= 1966 (with some STRONG exceptions like Blood on the Tracks and Nashville Skyline), but I'd like to say that this album really rocks.  His voice sorta of bugs me these days, but I think he really found a way to make the best use of its limitations on this album.  I would say that this album has a roots-rock sound, so if you don't like that kind of stuff don't bother with it.  But, if you do like that kind of stuff AND you like Dylan you'll definitely appreciate this effort.  Worth buying just to decide for yourself!
0767853636|4.0|I think whoever put this DVD together hates the movie and wanted to torture us with a Fullscreen version just for yuks. All menu and DVD extras (including the 3 sing-alongs) show it in Widescreen but the main movie is in Fullscreen. Why? It's nuts.<br /><br />Hey I don't know if this has been discussed over the years or not but Albert Finney's Daddy Warbucks voice is an impersonation of director John Huston's. It sounds just like him! Close your eyes during his dialog (especially near the beginning when he's more curmudgeon-like) and check it out.<br /><br />Everything is great about this DVD except that freaking Fullscreen treatment. WHY DID THEY DO THAT ANYWAY???
B00000DG1R|5.0|Very good and very important. I enjoy the toe-tapedness of the Duran Duran ways. The version of the Reflex not on Seven and the Ragged tiger, View to a Kill, Is there something I should Know? All the tracks that are hard to find. Good, posh, well written, a layer of meaning and discovery in their music. A great inspiring inspired documentation of the genius and song writing craft of the timeless energy of one of the most versed and inspired geniusEs of pOp. Julian CoPe watch out..
B000G75AE8|4.0|Five years after their maligned 2001 album \\"God Hates Us All\\" (which will forever be remembered for being released on 9/11), Slayer returns with \\"Christ Illusion\\", and it packs all the blistering riffs, drums, and Satanic imagry that one could hope for.  And to add even more appeal to longtime Slayer fans, original drummer Dave Lombardo has returned to the fold, replacing his injured predecessor Paul Bostaph.  First off, Lombardo sounds great as ever, and it's like he never left the first time.  The band as a whole sounds great as well: ranging from Tom Araya's signature vocals to the guitar duo of Jeff Hanneman and Kerry King, everything sounds great early on.  In fact, \\"Christ Illusion\\" is the best Slayer album since \\"Divine Intervention\\", and much of an improvement over the predictability of \\"God Hates Us All\\".  \\"Catalyst\\", \\"Eyes of the Insane\\", \\"Jihad\\", and \\"Cult\\" are pure Slayer without a doubt, but \\"Christ Illusion\\" isn't without it's share of flaws.  The lyrics mostly suffer the same fate as the lyrics from \\"God Hates Us All\\": too much cursing and overdoing the anti-Christian angle.  Now, that works for death metal, but Slayer always managed to get under your skin by writing eerie lyrics that had a meaning.  Over the past few years, it seems as if Slayer may be well on their way to becoming a one-trick pony, but hopefully that will never come to fruition.  Despite all that, \\"Christ Illusion\\" is still a well done piece of metal madness brought to us by one of the pioneering founders of thrash, and it's much better than nearly any of the modern crud that gets passed off as metal these days.
0743289412|5.0|2006 has been a great year for masters of the supernatural horror genre, but until now the master of them all hasn't put in a worthwhile appearance. Well that's all changed and how!   After a mildly disappointing recent effort by his own standards with this years earlier novel \\"The Cell\\" King was being overshadowed by the likes of Scott Smith, James Herbert and Cormac McCarthy. But now he's back to show everyone who exactly who does it best. Lisey's Story has a great many of the attributes a true fan of SK would associate with his work. There's the character Scott Landon who just happens to be an author for starters!  Anyway the story follows Lisey who was the great love of Scott Landon's life before his passing two years before the book begins. Well with Scott six feet under and Lisey all alone and mourning, along comes one of King's truly evil characters in the shape of Jimmy Dooley. Anxious to get his hands on Scott's unpublished works, this man will stop at nothing. King has brought wonderful dialogue, tension, suspense and all of the trademarks from his best work to the table in Lisey's Story. Essentially a fairly uncomplex storyline, the book's strength lies as always in the immense investment the author puts into his characters. Lisey's sister Amanda talking to her in the voice of her dead husband is a delightful intricacy for example. Every single one of the characters (no matter how minor they may seem at first) is multi-layered. Every line of dialogue is carefully fashioned, and every narrative paints a picture the reader can't fail to visualise in their minds eye. There have been many of Stephen King's books of late that have been referred to as a return to form. Personally I don't think he ever really lost it. If every book is a return to form then surely the form was never lost in the first place? The competition might be getting stronger, but no one is quite ready to knock the master from his rightful place atop the mountain of horror and suspense. At528 pages there is enough here to keep a reader occupied and enthralled for a fair few hours, days or weeks depending on whether you want to rush it or savour it. One thing's for sure though. No matter how long it takes to read, it's worth every penny.
B000HIVQBC|4.0|Originally released in March 1993, this is a harder sounding Depeche album with the hits \\"I Feel You\\", \\"Walking In My Shoes\\", \\"Condemnation\\" and \\"In Your Room\\". Other noteworthy tracks include \\"Mercy In You\\", \\"Rush\\" and \\"One Caress\\" with its orchestral background. Despite conflicts within the group and personal problems this album features some of the best songs Martin Gore has composed and the band has ever recorded.    The DVD features two B-sides \\"My Joy\\" and \\"Death's Door\\" along with six remixes. Two of them, \\"Condemnation(Paris Mix)\\" and \\"In Your Room(Zephyr Mix)\\" already appeared on \\"The Singles 86 > 98\\". But the highlight here is the 36 minute documentary spotlighting the difficulties making the album along with the subsequent tour. At the very end, Alan Wilder gives a brief explanation regarding his eventual departure from the group.    If you liked the original album, you'll like this expanded and remastered edition. Rock fans will like it too.
B0007TKH66|1.0|I tried to give ENTERPRISE a chance. I was excited to see how the Federation and Starfleet first developed and what happened soon after the discovery of warp drive. But the show didn't deliver on those promises in the first season.<br /><br />I could (possibly) have forgiven all glaring inconsistencies about the ship's naming and the technology, the bland crew, and the 'Patch Adams' theme song if - IF - the NX-01 hadn't started off by meeting alien races that were not discovered until centuries later. Picard encountered the Borg first? Nope, Archer. Ferengi? Archer. And on and on and on. That was not only flagrant, unnecessary retconning, it was totally against the (alleged) premise and promise of ENTERPRISE: They missed so much opportunity to show how the charter Federation members were discovered and eventually allied with. A virtual warehouse of cultures to explore and flesh out and they pick ones from the TNG era that have been done to death? That was the last straw for me.<br /><br />I understand they finally got around to doing this when the show was in its death throes but I wasn't around to enjoy it by then.<br /><br />Exploring the charter races, I mean.<br /><br />Well, the death throes, too.
B000H7JD4K|3.0|No es un mal trabajo despues de todo.  Lo reprochable es lo repetitivo del disco.  A veces te da la impresion de que es una sola cancion con espacios en blanco como descanso.  Esta bien que tengan intros lentas en una o dos canciones, pero, ¿en casi todas?.  Me parece que deberian hacer un disco mas variado la proxima vez.
B0002Z0EYK|1.0|I havent gotten really, really good and angry at a movie in a long time, and of course, it took a film like Troy to remind me what it was like.<br /><br />Let me start by saying that if your idea of a good time is Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom slightly misted in sweat and looking pretty, then turn the sound down, grab a bowl of popcorn and by all means, enjoy this movie and the beautiful costuming, and ignore the rest of this review.<br /><br />BUT, if you expect even one iota more out of a movie.....dont waste your time....I'm saddened by the fact that I cant get the 2 hours and 40 some odd minutes of my life I wasted here back.<br /><br />The dialogue is insipid (they actually left the line, \\"I'm sorry sir.... your wife has left with the Trojans.\\" IN the film....), everyone speaks with a British accent, except Brad Pitt....which wouldn't be that bad if he wasnt the STAR OF THE FILM.<br /><br />And then there are the extras who play sailors....who for reasons I cant quite understand seem to be speaking Greek....when the rest of the GREEKS are speaking English with a British accent....well...except Brad Pitt.<br /><br />In one scene, Achilles (Pitt) and his cousin (?) sparr with swords among majestic Greek ruins next to a beautiful blue sea....and I actually hit pause to scream at the screen, \\"Idiots!!! It would have been a BUILDING then! Not RUINS!\\".<br /><br />The real Trojan War lasted over ten years....this filmed version appears to last two weeks...with a days break here and there to allow the main characters to look suitably attractive on the beach...and you have very little if any idea of the loss of life on each side.... in short, this movie is pure unadulterated drivel. Youre asked to care about what began the war (you don't), you're asked to believe Brad Pitt's Achilles is smoldering and brooding (you can't), and youre expected to come away with the knowledge that for thousands of years this was considered the greatest war of all time (you won't).<br /><br />However much was spent in making this film was wasted.t). <br /> <br />However much was spent in making this film was wasted. <br />
B000GG4XJM|5.0|First off, have to admit that I am a solid Bruce fan.  First saw him in the late 70's and have seen him in every decade since. Have every album from his first one to this one, and have enjoyed all of them.  So having made that clear, let me say that I really enjoyed this set.  The music is fun and it seems like Springsteen is having a good time with this.  It is a departure for him as it is the first album he has done that consists of songs from other musicians.  This version has extra songs on it and a wonderful DVD that has a nice documentary on the making on the album and four terrific live performances.  A couple of highlights from the album include \\"Pay Me My Money Down\\" and \\"American Land.\\"  Take a listen to this album and, long time fan or not, this is one to enjoy for everyone.  The DVD and the extra songs on the CD make this a terrific buy. There are classic American songs on this album sung by a classic American singer.  Really a strong performance.

0307276902|5.0|I've done some investigating on this book and James Frey as an author. When he first started looking for a publisher to publish A Million Little Pieces, we titled it as a non-fiction work, and was turned down for years. He finally put the title of Biography on his book and it immediately was picked up by a publisher. <br /> <br />All that aside whether he was right or wrong..the book is very well written. One of the best books I have read in a while. Frey is an amazing sensory writer and really lets the reader imagine the scenarios described. You can't help but feel sad for James at his lows and rejoice with him at his highs. <br /> <br />Overall..I would recommend this book to anyone with enough time, and the stomach for some graphic stuff :)
0743298020|5.0|This was one of the best books that I have read in a very long time. I stayed up until 2 am to finish it. The beginning is a bit slow and the language can be a bit off putting but the story line will draw you in and keep you hooked until the very last page. <br /> <br />This is one of the few books that I will happily re-read again.
0765315246|4.0|This book is derived explicitly from Robert Heinlein's Starship Troopers and Joe Haldeman's The Forever War.  This is not, however, a knockoff.  Scalzi incorporates some clever plot construction to produce something novel.  Books like Starship Troopers are partly bildungsromans tracking the maturation of the hero.  In Old Man's War, the hero and his companions are aged individuals given a new lease on life by having their consciousness transferred into new, genetically modified bodies.  The price of this Faustian bargain is that they have to become grunts in very risky wars to defend human space colonies.  This idea is not novel either, to my knowledge it was first used by Poul Anderson in his 1950s short story, Call Me Joe.  Scalzi has used this idea to invert the traditional bildungsroman by describing not the maturation of youth but the recovery of youth, a sort of death and resurrection theme.  Some clever plotting allows Scalzi to ramify this theme throughout the book, accompanied by a more plaintive theme of recovering lost love.  This is skillful writing, though not matched by the quality of Scalzi's prose or characterization.
B0006J28L4|5.0|Arguably Spike Lee's greatest film, Malcolm X falls into that realm that many biopic's strive for yet don't achieve, it's so good it causes itself to be imprinted on your mind whenever you read about the REAL events. For years after, when you hear of an event from Malcolm X's life, the visuals of the film will be entertwined with the real visuals you may see....Denzel Washington's voice will be the voice you hear in your head when you read Malcolm's words....<br /><br />Yes. It's that good.<br /><br />Denzel Washington turns in an amazing performance which was completely deserving of his Oscar nomination that year (if not the win he didn't receive). Washington's rendition of Malcolm believably shows the emotion and the transformation he undergoes throughout his life, from petty thug in his early years, to polarizing civil rights leader, to his later days as a more MLK-esque supporter of peace.<br /><br />Although a bit long at 201 minutes, this movie rarely feels it, since so much of Malcolm's life is shown over the span of the film, the length seems necessary for the amount of information it contains.
B000F8O35U|5.0|I loved this film. It is for both young and old. The characters are so creative and the music is catchy and intelligent. The voices are perfect for their characters. One of my favorite Disney Films by far! I highly recommend it.
B000H7JD4A|4.0|Many reviewers on many websites have split opinions of this new Iron Maiden disc, but that's hardly surprising coz folks have been all over Maiden's butt since No Prayer For The Dying.  As far as Maiden in the 21st century goes, this album is quite good.  I'd have to say I like it more than the previous album, and maybe, just maybe more than Brave New World(more listens will ultimately determine that).  You gotta admit, Maiden have a difficult task of trying to consistently write good songs year after year, especially after a string of classic albums in the 80s.  It can't be easy, and of course it's always the fair weather fans who are right there to complain the  second Maiden do something they feel is less than stellar.  I realize we place high standards on Maiden, but how can a new Maiden album compete with 20 years worth of Powerslave listenings?  Plus, with eight billion power/traditional metal bands popping up over the years, it can't be easy to sound fresh anymore.  With Iron Maiden nowadays, I just expect some good, well played metal tunes, and I feel that's what this disc has.  Songs long?  Yeah, but most Maiden albums have an average of at least three songs that pass the six minute mark anyway.  The sound of Maiden since Bruce rejoined has been a bit different, though unmistakably Maiden.  Some don't like this era of Maiden, but that's been an old story throughout their career.  Okay, without all the babbling hopefully I can give you an idea of how this sounds and maybe save you some money.  If you didn't like the last two albums, it's safe to say that you probably won't like this one.  There are exceptions to the rule, but that pretty much sums it up.  Personally, I love the fact that Maiden continue to soldier on and try hard to do their best regardless of critics.

B00005JPBP|4.0|The Prestige is a movie in which my review cannot do justice.  The movie advertises itself as one with twist after twist and one at the end you will not believe.  Christopher Nolan directed this movie, Batman Begins and also Memento, one of the best \\"twist\\" movies ever.<br /><br />The Prestige has a great cast:  Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Scarlett Johnassen and Michael Caine.  All do exceptional work in this movie set in the early 1900s.  Jackman and Bale are both magicians and bitter rivals.  The two spend the movie trying to find the secrets to the other's tricks, deceiving each other professionally and personally.<br /><br />This movie is enjoyable because of its great cast, beautiful scenery, and exciting riveting plot.  On the downside, there are no good guys.  Moments after the film, I found myself questioning why I rooted for the character I did.  Was the good guy really good?  Was the bad guy really bad?  While this movie gives you a lot to ponder, I didn't feel a huge stake in the outcome and thus wasn't blown away by the conclusion.  This is still a movie you must see and one of the better movies out right now.<br /><br />I suggest you stop reading reviews now and try not to read anything about this movie to prevent you learning its secrets.  I believe that after you see the movie once, you'll want to see it again.  There are so many scenes that can be viewed differently once you know the truth.
B000GCFO0I|4.0|I'll be the first to admit, based on a video game or not, the plot of this film isnt very deep, and the ending is seen from a mile off, but the truth of the matter is, the visuals make up for all the failings. This film is visually stunning. I havent played the video game, so I dont know how it compares visually or storywise, but the camera movements, visual transitions and characters add enough of a creep factor to propel you past the thin storyline.<br /><br />Radha Mitchell puts in a great perfromance as the mother searching for her missing daughter, and Alice Krige is at her creepy best. The only drop in the acting is the woman who plays the cop, who's wooden perfromance reminded me of the crappy actress from \\"House of The Dead\\" everytime she was onscreen. I dont think she was actually AS bad, but, I felt biased.<br /><br />Overall, a very good film.
B000HEWEE4|4.0|The concept of this film is great.  At times it is a little hard to follow what time is what.  But overall I enjoyed both characters and the romance of it all.
B000000OQF|5.0|This was one of my first albums I got. I got it because of 'Paradise City' but got adapted quickly to 'Welcome to the Jungle' and rest.

0446613444|4.0|Black Ice, by Michael Connelly, is my second Harry Bosch novel after reading the Closers.  In Black Ice, policeman Cal Moore is found dead in a dilapidated hotel room on New Years Eve.  Moore worked on the narc squad.  Harry Bosch is on call and hears the murder on the police scanner.  He expects to be called in but isn't because the higher ups want to handle this one.  Harry gets one part of the case, he gets to tell Mrs. Moore her husband is dead.<br /><br />Bosch moves on.  He's given some cases another detective was working on and told to try and close them before the end of the year to make the numbers look good.  Bosch begins looking at a murder of a Mexican immigrant and sees the body was found by Cal Moore.  Bosch looks further into Moore's past and soon finds three murder cases that are all interrelated.  In what I gather is a theme of Bosch novels, the detective goes off on his own to try and solve the murder.  The last third of the book is spent in the Mexico border town of Calexico.  The DEA, Mexican police and drug lords are all part of the story.  The story comes together nicely in the end as Bosch saves the day.<br /><br />This novel is slow and methodical, perhaps the way a police prodecural should be.  It never was boring though, as Connelly created good characters that held my interest.  I'll definitely read more Connelly novels, but won't be in a hurry to read them as fast as I can like books by Harlen Coben or John Sandford.
B00004U8H4|3.0|Having been a HUGE fan of the book for many, many years, I could easily stand up and scream I hate this film, the way most people do when they've read the book then see a movie.<br /><br />But, I feel they did a good job of capturing the sardonic wit and social commentary from the book, and putting it on celluloid. I just think those ideas should have been played up a little more, more in an effort to set the ideas and ideals of the 1980's and the main character, Patrick Bateman, who is a walking stereotype of everything the Reagan-era was felt to represent against the sick and twisted very non-stereotypical actions he performed.<br /><br />Sadly, I think this movie didnt fare as well as it could have in the theatres because they advertised it to be \\"horror\\", when it was meant to be \\"horrific\\". But aside from that, this movie is a nice evenings diversion, but, since the social commentary it communicates gets muddled at times, it wont change any lives.<br /><br />If you havent read the book, after seeing this film, I highly suggest you do so.
B00078807U|1.0|Everyone, <br />     Does this version of Ghost in the shell 2 have the English voices dubbed in? Or is this still the Japanese only version? I can deal with the \\"closed caption subtitle problem\\",........what I can't deal with is no English voices and having to read 100 minutes of dialogue. <br /> <br />Someone please let me know.....
B000I0QK74|5.0|This CD is a jewel.  The orchestrations are gorgeous and the voice is vintage James Taylor, just as warm and friendly as ever.  It is a wonderful mix of secular and sacred songs, balanced and gentle.  This CD will be a favorite for years to come.  What a lovely early Christmas present.
B00005JOQS|5.0|I loved the movie.  I grew up on the original movies but was disapointed in Superman III & IV.  But this time superman has returned!  However, I would like to point out that Superman Returns takes place after Superman IV not Superman II as some have suggested.  It's really easy to see why, since Louis has NO kid in three and four.  Also the fact that Luther is in jail and breaks out in Superman IV.

B000GPIPVU|5.0|After Trouble and his Austin City Limits appearance, I thought he was just another very good singer songwriter.  This follow up has made me reconsider, because this is the work of a very thoughtful perfectionist.  He waited and it was worth the wait. <br /> <br />This reminded me immediately of John Lennon (please don't punish me for blasphemy) and others that knew how to touch you with simplicity done in a classy way. <br /> <br />I didn't expect something this deep for a sophomore recording.  Enjoy!
0375703764|3.0|Hmmmm This book was one of the most puzzling I have read for a long time. I must admit that it kept me very interested and at times I was genuinely scared. <br /> <br />If you are a fan of post modern, meta fiction (like Infinite Jest, you will appreciate the structure and architecture of the way the story is told.  I would imagine that the main story line of the family in the house would be dull if it was written in a straight forward, liner fashion.  Telling it as a story within a story, with many different narrative tricks makes it seem more chilling - like a ghost story passed along over the years. <br /> <br />On the negative side I felt that much of Johnny's narrative did not work-I simply did not believe he was real nor did I care about the source of his madness by the end of the book. The effect was neat of him re-telling the story but his trip at the end did nothing for me wrt making the story more meaningful. <br /> <br />Overall I would say if you are an adventurous reader you should absolutely check it out.
B000HT386M|5.0|I think this movie is GREAT! Yes, there are parts it gets serious, and even makes you cry,but it still has all the humor you would expect in a Sandler movie.<br /><br />Adam Sandler's character is a workaholic who does not pay his family enough attention, and after a frustrating night with too many remotes, he goes to Bed, Bath & Beyond looking for a universal,that does it all, and boy,... does he get one !!<br /><br />He quickly learns that it literally DOES control his universe.<br />(i.e. : fast forward through unpleasant events, Pause on the good times, skip scenes (fights, for example)..and everything is just fine for awhile...<br />Until the remote starts to program itself, and things go haywire.)<br />Years roll by too quickly, and he learns through these painful times, that where WORK and getting ahead used to be important, that FAMILY now is...without giving too much of the movie away, It's kind of like the old saying \\"Be careful what you wish for.\\"<br />When such serious matters as  death, divorce, family problems come up, this is where some people got uncomfortable, and said it was \\"too serious\\" for a Sandler movie, having to deal with (gulp) feelings and all.<br /><br />But throughout the whole movie, there is still the same old zany Sandler humor as is in all his movies.<br />It is FULL of laughs, and DEFINATELY a comedy - it just deals with some serious real life issues, and will bring a tear to your eye.<br />I think this is his best movie yet !!!<br />The whole cast was GREAT!<br />Kate Beckinsale as his wife, David Hasselhoff as his boss, Henery Winkler as his Dad, and Christopher Walken as Morty. It's one you will enjoy watching many times.
B00005JMYI|5.0|This is probably the funniest movie I've ever seen.  Seriously, if you have a sense of humor, you will enjoy this movie to the fullest. Heck, I'd even watch this movie instead of some afternoon delight.  Maybe even with some afternoon delight.  It's that good.
0307346609|4.0|Brooks puts together a great book. Not only does it provide a great story about the Zombie War but provides a few nice shots at modern American society. I really enjoyed this book. It had a bit less humor then his survival guide. Some of the stories were kind of boring, I was hoping for a bit more action. I mean after all this is first person accounts of a war! Oh well you can't have everything. <br /> <br />Oh I also want to add that those looking for a scary read should look elsewhere. There is no horror in the book. Maybe the exo-suit wearing guy has some but other then that its not really scary. Shocking maybe but scary no, sorry. Finally, Brooks a Mahhattanite should know that the Mets play in Queens <br />
B000EZ831Y|5.0|Green Day made their most important album, 2004's American Idiot, 15 years after forming their band. 2006 is the year for the Red Hot Chili Peppers to do the same thing.  <br /> <br />Stadium Arcadium is a solid 2-disc 28-track album featuring the Peppers at a more focused and much more mellowed out form than their previous albums, while maintaining their funk along the way (just listen to Hump De Bump for proof). Lead vocalist Anthony Keidas's signature singing style, Chad's precise drumming, and Flea's funky bass playing can't quite keep up with the energy that guitarist John Frusciante brings to the California quartet's groovy sound formula (If you thought that John's ethereal guitar licks on Scar Tissue were out of this world like I did, then there's plenty to be mesmerized by and discovered on Arcadium). In a nutshell, Stadium Arcadium is extremely infectious, and is destined to be the biggest rock album of the year.  <br /> <br />The album's first single, and album opener, Dani California is by far the best rock single released so far this year. The track follows up on Dani, a character referenced in 1999's Californication and mentioned in 2002's By The Way; the song also triggered a memorable music video featuring the band impersonating The Beatles and Nirvana amongst others. As a group, the Peppers deliver some of their best tunes to date using the same ingredients they've used before, mixing funk, punk, alternative rock, and Beatlesque harmonies: the groovy ballad Snow (Hey Oh) and C'mon Girl, the even groovier Charlie, the mellow future single Stadium Arcadium, the elusive Lenny Kravitz style rocker She's Only 18, the 70's style rocker Strip My Mind, the surreal Especially In Michigan, the acoustic Slow Cheetah, the bass driven Torture Me, the cool rockers Warlocks, Storm In A Teacup, She Looks To Me, Make You Feel Better, and Desecration Smile, the radio friendly Tell Me Baby, and, one of my personal favorites, what could possibly be the strongest balladthe Peppers have ever written Hard To Concentrate.  <br /> <br />16 years have passed since the band made their first mark in the mainstream. With the release of Stadium Arcadium, it seems that the Chili Peppers are just now getting hotter!  <br /> <br />Track Picks:  <br /> <br />Dani California  <br />Snow (Hey Oh)  <br />Charlie  <br />Stadium Arcadium  <br />She's Only 18  <br />Slow Cheetah <br />Strip My Mind <br />Especially In Michigan  <br />Desecration Smile  <br />Tell Me Baby  <br />Hard To Concentrate  <br />Make You Feel Better  <br />Storm In A Teacup
B00003CWN3|5.0|I was literally speachless when I saw this movie for the first time, and it takes a pretty raw movie to make me speachless. I also felt disgust, sadness and complete horror that these teenage boys were so insecure and uneducated about homosexuals (or anyone else who is different than them)that they actually commited murder!<br /><br />This is the true story of a girl, Teena Brandon (Played by Hillary Swank)who was a lesbian and lived in a small midwestern town that didn't accept her homosexuality,<br /> so she met some friends in a town about a hundred miles away where no one knew her.<br /><br /> She came to know a whole new circle of friends who upon introduction believed her to be a boy, and accepted her, so she reversed her first name and last name, and instead of being \\"Teena Brandon\\", she was now a He: \\"Brandon Teena.\\"<br />And she continued living this masqurade,(not DARING to let them discover her true sex)<br />She even fell in love with a town girl she had a crush on (Chloe' Sevigny)<br /><br />She became friends with the girls, and drinking buddies with the guys, and it was like a dream of acceptance come true for her, until they began to suspect her true sexual identity.<br /><br />Her girlfriend DID stick by her and wanted to run off, It was a hick town anyway, PLUS she had no real family there to speak of,none that really cared,- and neither did Brandon (Teena), except for a brother who also didn't accept her...so the 2 were going to run off, but before they could- tragedy struck.<br /><br />2 of the redneck boys RAPED her in the most horribly convincing rape I have ever seen on film, and when she went to the police, they took sides with the boys and wouldn't even arrest them, They tried to make the whole thing out like her sexuality PROVOKED the horrendous rape!

6305546789|5.0|Oh, what a great film. I showed it to my niece the other week when I was babysitting. She was so riveted to the screen that she didn't move a muscle. I guess she is still excited about this movie because my brother told me that she hasn't been able to sleep for days. Yep, classic movies will do this to you...<br /><br />Geesh, people...do you really think I would show one of the scariest movies of all time to a four year old?
B000E8QVWY|5.0|Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon deliver two of the greatest performances of recent memory in this powerful film about one of country music's biggest stars: Johnny Cash. <br /> <br />Young Johnny took an early interest in music while growing up on an Arkansas cotton farm during the great depression of the 1930s.  He was very close to his older brother, Jack, but his father Ray Cash (Robert Patrick) was extremely strict with young John and forbade him from listening to the radio.  John looked to Jack for love and support, but Jack died in a freak table saw accident, leaving young John alone.  John's guilt is not helped when his father blames him for the accident, saying that the wrong son died.   <br /> <br />During the Korean conflict, John enlisted in the air force and was sent to Germany.  There, he saw a film about Folsom Prison.  Moved by the film, John wrote a song entitled \\"Folsom Prison Blues\\".  Upon his discharge from the air force, John returned to the United States and married his girlfriend Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin).  After the marriage, John tried (unsuccessfully) to make a living as a door-to-door salesman.  His heart was really in music, and he managed to get an audition with Sun Records executive Sam Phillips (Dallas Roberts).  Initially, the audition went poorly, as John and his group stuck to gospel music.  Sam informed the group that people were tired of listening to gospel and asked John if he had any other music to play.  John responded by playing \\"Folsom Prison Blues\\" and his career took off.   <br /> <br />After the success of the audition, John and his band began a tour with the likes of Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis, but there was one particular person who caught John's eye: June Carter (Reese Witherspoon).  Although there was an attraction between the two, both were married to other people at the time.  But the chemistry was definitely there, as evidenced by their magic on-stage performances of such great songs as \\"Jackson\\", \\"Walk the Line\\", and \\"Ring of Fire\\" (which was written by June).  The two toured on and off for several years, and the strain began to take its toll on John.  By the time the decade of the 1960s began, John was fighting a battle against amphetamines.  His marriage to Vivian ended and he sought help from June to overcome his drug problem.  He moved into a new lakefront home after his divorce from Vivian.  While fighting his drug problem, he spent a great deal of time reading letters from prison inmates.  These letters led him to take an idea of a live concert from Folsom Prison to the executives at Columbia Records.  Initially rebuffed, John told them that they could destroy the tapes if they didn't like the live recording.  However, John's \\"Live At Folsom Prison\\" went on to become one of the biggest-selling albums ever made. <br /> <br />After the Folsom Prison concert, John, June, and the others went to Ontario, Canada for another concert.  During the performance of \\"Jackson\\", John asked June to marry him.  He had asked her many times before, but was  turned down each time.  This time, however, June said yes, and they were married for 35 years until both passed away in 2003.  They spent their time with their families at the lake house fishing and enjoyng their family. <br /> <br />This is one of the best movies I've ever seen.  Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are simply perfect as Johnny and June, and both do their own singing in the movie.  Joaquin sounds exactly like Johnny did, and Reese was the perfect choice to play June.  Her voice is excellent as well.  The acting throughout the movie is great, and the songs bring back many memories.  Its easy to see why this movie was such a hit with so many movie critics. <br /> <br />I give this movie my highest recommendation.  Watch and see the rise and struggles of a country music legend.
B00003CXDD|5.0|To sum things up, this was really a George Lucus film-with the then relatively inexperienced Ron Howard hired to direct-under the watchful eye of Lucus. Lucus wrote the screenplay, raiding his bookshelf for Tolkein (especially \\"The Hobbit\\") and Lewis (\\"Narnia\\"). Then he simply transferred the hero/heroine romance from his \\"Star Wars\\" screenplay. Not necessarily a bad thing, it was a simple way for him to build a feature length screenplay targeting younger viewers but sophisticated enough to entertain the entire family. \\"Willow\\" has some scary stuff but should not be a problem for the average grade school viewer. My rating is based on comparisons to other films with a similar target audience.    I must confess up-front to a positive bias. My favorite part of \\"Star Wars\\" is the caustic romance between Han Solo and Princess Leia; and in \\"Willow\\" Lucus has refined his technique and actually improved something that was already close to perfection. Sorsha (Joanne Whalley) and Madmartigan (Val Kilmer) substitute nicely for Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford, with the added dimension of having them begin the story on opposite sides. The romantic elements are efficiently and subtly inserted into the film. Even though these characters are part of the main storyline, the romance is separate enough to serve as the film's main parallel story. The only downside is that this side story soon becomes more interesting than the main one, so much so that its climatic kiss (occurring about 20 minutes before the ending) unintentionally turns into the film's climax (at least energy wise). The actual resolution of the main story then plays out rather anti-climatically.     \\"Willow\\" is a delivery quest story, much like \\"The Hobbit\\" where a reluctant Nelwyn (small person) is required to set out on a perilous journey to return a lost baby (even smaller) to a Daikini (tall person). Along the way he is assisted by a couple of Brownies (yet smaller guys who speak with outrageous French accents). The size differentials are the main theme of the film and are especially intriguing to young viewers who easily identify with having to deal with people who tower above them. Howard encourages this identification process by shooting most of the action at child level. If you watch the film with young children you will be amazed at its ability to draw them into the story, this happens because the camera angles intentionally match a child's point-of-view of the world. The viewing child's surrogate is the title character (Warwick Davis-who does a commentary on the DVD), a unlikely hero who inspires audience sympathy as he bravely faces the dangers of his journey while gamely putting up with an ever-changing group of irritating companions. There are frequent cutaways to Elora Danan (the baby), mostly for reaction shots. As in \\"Raising Arizona\\", the producers took enough stock clips to match her expressions to almost any situation. Willow learns early on from Cherlindrea (a dazzling fairy) that Elora Danan is a princess who (it has been foretold) will one day vanquish the evil Queen Baymorda (a fun role for Jean Marsh). Things get a bit Biblical/Narnia here as the Queen is seeking to eliminate the Princess before she becomes a threat.    The DVD features: \\"Willow:The Making of an Adventure\\" (made during production in 1988) and \\"Willow: Morf to Morphing\\" (made in 2001 for the DVD release), really put the film in historical context relative to its place in the evolution of special effects. It was really the transitional point where photochemical (film) effects were subordinated to digital effects. This gave \\"Willow\\" a significant place in film history and these two featurettes taken together nicely illustrate the continuing challenge to those involved with special effects; any new development is soon overused and no longer an audience draw. Meaning that effects people have to stay on the cutting edge to simply justify their existence.     Then again, what do I know? I'm onlya child.

B00001NFCY|5.0|Creed is(or was) one of the most loathed mainstream rock bands in recent memory, and I never truly figured out why that was. Granted I only own Human Clay, and have only heard the singles from My Own Prison and Weathered. My brother bought Human Clay around the time it came out, and we almost listened the disc into little plastic particles!  Of course, I was only about 12 at the time, so I couldn't fully appreciate the album as much as others could, lyrically speaking. Well, about 6 months ago, I was getting ready to move, and I found a \\"weathered\\" jewel case sitting somewhere in a dusty old box. I popped it in, and all the memories came flooding back to me, I felt like I was twelve again. I swear I've listened to it another 50 times since I rediscovered it.  <br /> <br />Human Clay is one of the better rock records of the last 10 years. Mark Tremonti's awesome lead guitar coupled with Scott Stapp's Vedderesc agressiveness are the two most immediate aspects of the record. These guys are definitely a step up from most of the mainstream crop, and the record hasn't aged one bit, it sounds like it could've come out just yesterday.         There aren't any weak songs on Human Clay, per se, although to get the weakest out of the way: \\"Wrong Way\\"...............And that's about it.  Other than that the only thing that bothers me about Human Clay is the fact that there are two versions of \\"With Arms Wide Open\\", which I find sort of needless. Now that the negatives are out of the way,  we'll get to where Human Clay Excels. The Opening track, \\"Are You Ready\\", definitley sets the tone for what's to come. Notable are the agressive vocal thrashes accompied by melodic guitar riffs, though neither seem to dominate eachother. The production quality on Human Clay is fantastic, though I'd have liked it if there were a few more songs on the album.  It kinda ends before you'd hoped it would,  with barely over an hour of music(including the \\"With Arms Wide Open\\" repeat).  This is the average as I understand it,  but maybe more and more bands are putting more than 10 songs on their records these days, and maybe that's spoiled me.   <br /> <br />The best songs on Human Clay are definitely: \\"What If\\",  \\"Higher\\",  and \\"Faceless Man\\". Those are by far the ones I listen to the most, although I rarely if ever skip by any songs on the record, other than \\"Wrong Way\\".   <br /> <br />There is a theory that different people hear the same music differently from eachother, and I think because of this band's popularity, it's created this massive debate. Don't debate, just enjoy this or something else. But please, if you haven't given Creed a shot yet, I can definitely recommend Human Clay to you.
B000GFLAI0|1.0|Horrible vocals, boring songwriting.  The only way you'll like this is if you're some trendy lame-o who goes to Starbucks every morning and think your cool because you listen to BOB DYLAN.  Save your money.  This geezer hasn't been interesting since 1965.
B00005JPBP|4.0|Act One: The Pledge<br /><br />London. The early 1900s.<br /><br />Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are each apprentices to another magician (Ricky Jay), serving as audience plants. During the act, they \\"volunteer\\" to come up on stage to check the knots on the magician's assistant, Sarah (Rebecca Hall) before she is lowered into a vat of water and escapes behind a drawn curtain. Borden checks her wrists, Angier her ankles before giving her shapely legs a discreet kiss. One night, Sarah is unable to get out and Cutter (Michael Caine), the Magician's engineer, breaks the glass to release her. But he is too late and she dies. Angier is understandably distraught, the Assistant is his wife and he believes Borden is responsible. The knots at her wrist allow the escape.<br /><br />Thus begins a rivalry between the two magicians that will last for years, each of them trying to outdo the other, learn each other's secrets and to destroy the other, personally and professionally.<br /><br />The rivalry comes to a head when Borden develops a trick called The Disappearing Man. Angier wants it and learns Nikola Tesla (David Bowie), a rival of Thomas Edison's, developed it for Borden. Throughout, they play games with each other and each other's lovers, trying to prove who the better magician, the better man is.<br /><br />Act Two: The Turn<br /><br />Written by brothers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan and directed by Christopher (\\"Memento\\", \\"Batman Begins\\", \\"Insomnia\\"), \\"The Prestige\\" presents a complicated, involving tale of two competing magicians who are seeking to become the best in their field. Their pursuit involves revenge, making them cold hearted in their quest. While the film is beautiful, technically outstanding and very interesting, this cold heartedness makes it way into the story, robbing the film of some emotion and some of its power.<br /><br />Nolan is clearly interested in making the same types of films I am interested in watching because every one of his films has been very good or great. How many filmmakers are accomplished enough to create a film like \\"Memento\\" as their second film? Not many. Then to follow that with \\"Insomnia\\" and \\"Batman Begins\\", well, we have a talent on our hands. He seems to enjoy exploring the dark sides of his characters, exposing them to our gaze. This makes these characters intrinsically more interesting. To have a hero's dark side exposed gives us more to think about and to ponder, making them more fully developed.<br /><br />In \\"The Prestige\\", Nolan takes two of our most interesting actors and casts them in a battle against one another.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are equally good. Bale plays the darker, more enigmatic role. Jackman plays the more distraught, grieving member of the duo.<br /><br />After Angier loses his wife, he becomes obsessed with revenge. He wants to make sure he is the better magician than his rival, trying to constantly outdo Borden. But that isn't enough. He also seeks to destroy the other magician's life; straining his relationship with his wife, affecting the life of their daughter, destroying his on stage persona.<br /><br />As Angier sets about this task, Jackman gives him subtlety, so that even when he is acting like a jerk, we still care for him. A large part of this is that we don't always know what is going on, and even when we do, the other member of the duo may be doing something equally as underhanded, balancing it out. So Jackman's Angier is not a bad guy, nor is he a Saint, but he is interesting.<br /><br />Jackman's performance is very good. Even though he is on a quest for revenge, he reveals his obsession in subtle doses. At no point does he stop, stare off screen and break into a maniacal grin.<br /><br />Bale's Borden has a couple of key similarities to his rival and one key difference. He is also obsessed with revenge; as soon as Angier extracts revenge, he changes Borden's life and he then sets a plan for revenge in motion. But Borden wants to be the best Magician. He doesn't care if he has an audience, or fame, he simply wants to amaze people, to be an artist. Angier wants to be a star and this motivates both of them because Angier realizes it will make his own quest more difficult, Borden is more committed to his craft.<br /><br />But Borden's quest for revenge makes him cold and a little heartless as well. He falls in love and marries Julia (Piper Perabo). They have a child. His wife soon realizes that Borden only really loves her on certain days. She asks \\"Do you love me?\\" and he will respond \\"Yes, of course.\\" Some days, she believes him. Others, she knows he isn't truthful. Late in the film, he announces \\"Not today\\". When he loves her, the character is full fledged and intensely interesting, but on those other days, he is too cold.<br /><br />When both main characters have hearts of ice, the film has little emotional core, making it seem hollow. It's too bad both characters are unable to show their determination to extract revenge and their humanity at the same time. If this were the case, we would have a five star film on our hands. Without that emotional core, we just have a very good film.<br /><br />Michael Caine plays Cutter, the engineer who creates new tricks. After the accident on stage, Angier approaches him and asks him to work for him. Throughout, he takes on the role of wise old sage, teaching the other two men about the life of a magician. The role is good, and a necessary part of the story, but Caine has certainly done more exciting work in the past.<br /><br />Scarlett Johannson appears in her third of four films with a British accent. As Angier's assistant, she becomes a pawn in the game of revenge and does a good job. Again, nothing outstanding, but interesting. Why this rising young actress would take essentially a bit part is beyond me.<br /><br />Act Three: The Prestige<br /><br />But Nolan is a true artist with his writing. From the beginning, he weaves a complicated, intricate tale about the two magicians. We watch as Angier arrives in Colorado Springs to meet with the mysterious Tesla. Is that a limp? How did that happen? Then we watch as Borden faces trial for the murder of Angier. In a flash back, we watch as Angier performs the Disappearing Man trick and falls into a locked vat of water. Unable to escape, he dies. Then someone delivers Angier's journal to Borden in prison. As Borden reads his rival's journal, we learn of his story. Nolan then sets two stories in motion, crossing back and forth between different timelines, revealing keys to the mystery to us in small pieces.<br /><br />Essentially, Nolan has created a jigsaw puzzle and all of the pieces fit. He and his co-writer, his brother, have worked out every detail, to make sure it fits. Key details may not be recognized at the time, but everything fits into place.<br /><br />The framework of the story is also very interesting. Both men are reading through the journals of their rival. As they begin reading, we hear the other man narrate the story and we soon are watching a flashback. This method ensures that we only learn certain things when Nolan wants us to learn them. It is a neat trick. He has created a method of storytelling that essentially keeps us in the dark until he is ready to let us in on the secret. But it works.<br /><br />This is a film with multiple revelations. Frankly, one of the revelations involving Bale's Borden was not as surprising or shocking as Nolan intended it to be. There are many scenes leading up to this moment and it was not hidden that well. That aside, the other revelations are well performed, proving Nolan may just be a magician himself.<br /><br />\\"The Prestige\\" is one of the most interesting to watch films I have seen this year. But the key performances are lacking just that extra little oomph to push the film to the top. They are just too damn cold and the film lacks an emotional heart. Without a heart, itis difficult to become fully engrossed in Mr. Nolan's magic.ist with his writing. From the beginning, he weaves a complicated, intricate tale about the two magicians. We watch as Angier arrives in Colorado Springs to meet with the mysterious Tesla. Is that a limp? How did that happen? Then we watch as Borden faces trial for the murder of Angier.

Key details may not be recognized at the time, but everything fits into place. <br /> <br />The framework of the story is also very interesting. Both men are reading through the journals of their rival. As they begin reading, we hear the other man narrate the story and we soon are watching a flashback. This method ensures that we only learn certain things when Nolan wants us to learn them. It is a neat trick. He has created a method of storytelling that essentially keeps us in the dark until he is ready to let us in on the secret. But it works. <br /> <br />This is a film with multiple revelations. Frankly, one of the revelations involving Bale's Borden was not as surprising or shocking as Nolan intended it to be. There are many scenes leading up to this moment and it was not hidden that well. That aside, the other revelations are well performed, proving Nolan may just be a magician himself. <br /> <br />\\"The Prestige\\" is one of the most interesting to watch films I have seen this year. But the key performances are lacking just that extra little oomph to push the film to the top. They are just too damn cold and the film lacks an emotional heart. Without a heart, it is difficult to become fully engrossed in Mr. Nolan's magic.
B000GY729M|1.0|I was relatively optimistic about this album but after suffering through 4 listens it has taken up permanent residence in my garbage can.  The space in my house is too valuable to devote to this drivel. The first two tracks (not considering the pretentious interlude officially deemed as track two) are decent, but the rest of the album is bloody horrible.  I had to put in Hot Fuss again and listen to \\"Smile Like You Mean It\\" a couple of times just to convince me that this was the same band.  The awful EP that they include with it isn't worth [...] at a garage sale.  Self-important, glorified crap.  Oh yeah, the album title is completely retarded as well.  Say goodbye to a band that once had a lot of promise.  An utter waste of [...] that I wished I could recoup.
B00005JPB4|4.0|John \\"Doc\\" Bradley (Ryan Phillippe), Rene Gagnon (Jesse Bradford) and Ira \\"Chief\\" Hayes (Adam Beach) are three of the many Marines involved with the World War II battle for the Japanese stronghold, Iwo Jima. Initially, they arrive on the island and meet little resistance, and then the Japanese open their bunkers and start firing on the unsuspecting U.S. Marines. The targets are the big guns the Japanese have built into the rock of the island, protecting the path to Japan. The battle is hard, and they witness many bad things, but the Marines eventually win the battle. Early in the battle, Doc, Chief and Gagnon are among the soldiers who raise the flag on the island, providing the iconic image of the battle and the war. A photographer snaps their picture and the image appears in newspapers and magazines across the country, giving the public hope. The government, in a financial crisis, realizes this photo could help sell war bonds, save the government from bankruptcy and help win the war. They decide to bring the surviving soldiers back to America, to speak and make public appearances. Gagnon is only too happy to oblige, and get out of the line of fire. He provides the names of Doc and Chief and the three begin a cross country tour. Along the way, Chief turns to drink to help drown the memories of his fallen comrades.<br /><br />Directed by Clint Eastwood and written by William Broyles Jr. and Paul Haggis (\\"Crash\\", \\"Million Dollar Baby\\"), \\"Flags of our Fathers\\" is the first of two films depicting the same event from different viewpoints. Next year, we will see a film telling the Japanese viewpoint of this same battle hits the multiplexes. This is an interesting idea. But it doesn't help make \\"Flags of our Fathers\\" better than it is. \\"Flags\\" is an okay film, a competent film, but not a great film.<br /><br />I have mentioned it before, but when a filmmaker makes a series of great or outstanding films, they raise the bar for themselves along with everyone else. After \\"Unforgiven\\", \\"Million Dollar Baby\\" and \\"Mystic River \\" from director Clint Eastwood and \\"Million Dollar Baby\\" and \\"Crash\\" from screenwriter Haggis, you would expect \\"Flags\\" to be a great film. Because it isn't, it seems like even more of a let down.<br /><br />There are two key problems with the film. The first is the method of telling the story.<br /><br />The film begins in the present, with the elderly Doc, who now owns a funeral home. He wakes up at night, next to his wife, frightened by nightmares of Iwo Jima. Then, as the film progresses, we go back to just before the Marines leave for the battle and meet the three men and some of their buddies. Then, we flash forward a couple of months to the three men on tour promoting war bonds, dealing with the memories of the people left behind. These memories cause a flash back to another key moment in the battle. Flash forward to present day and Doc's son talking to various survivors of Iwo Jima about the event, which leads to more flash backs. I don't mind a story that jumps around a bit; in fact I prefer it, because it makes us an active participant in the story, allowing us to figure things out. But to make this a success, the characters have to be fleshed out and memorable. That isn't the case in \\"Flags\\". During the present day scenes, we never get a sense of who Doc's son is. He meets with various survivors, interviewing them, and we also see him writing a book about his father's experiences. Who is this guy? Is he a writer? Why is he just now writing this book? At one point, Doc tells his son \\"I wish I had been a better father.\\" Huh? This is the first moment we have ever seen of discord in their relationship. In fact, it is one of the few moments we have even seen them together.<br /><br />Eastwood used a similar technique in \\"The Bridges of Madison County\\". Two adult siblings learn about an affair their mother had in the 60s with a National Geographic photographer, after she dies. They read a letter from her, talking about the affair and what it meant to her, prompting a flash back and the main story. But in \\"Bridges\\" we actually learn about these characters.<br /><br />In \\"Flags\\", this character is largely unknown to us, giving us no involvement in his story or his life.<br /><br />A couple of the people the son interviews are unknown until we realize, through the flash back, who they are. I was unable to place one of the subjects, even while watching the flashbacks. How does this help us become emotionally invested in the story? It doesn't. We have to know who the characters are, to become interested in them, to become invested in their actions, the horrors they witness and their lives.<br /><br />All of this would be forgiven if the three main characters, or their colleagues, had a discernible character during their appearances. Ryan Phillippe plays Doc, a Navy Corpsman who accompanies the Marines, providing medical assistance as they are wounded. Despite one scene in which he searches for a lost patient, he merely stands around as an observer, helping people, but he seems little affected by the events during the war. During their tour of the States, his sole purpose seems to be to provide a shoulder for \\"Chief\\" to lean against when he is drunk.<br /><br />Jesse Bradford's Rene Gagnon comes into his own when he arranges for certain people to return to the States, to escape the horrors of war. He reveals his personality, trying to work the angles to get a couple of his friends a ticket back home. As they tour, he meets with various businessmen who offer him a job when the war is over. In other words, Gagnon is looking out for himself. During the tour, he relishes the spotlight and the attention.<br /><br />The real emotional center of the film is Adam Beach's Ira Hayes. During the battle, he is most affected by the horrors of the war and when he returns home, he is plagued by nightmares. He turns to drink and becomes a sloppy drunk, not exactly what the government was hoping for, and to help promote the war bonds it so desperately needs to sell.<br /><br />In almost every scene, Hayes is fighting with someone, trying to maintain the integrity of the battle they fought for Iwo Jima, or drowning himself in drink, because of all of the friends he lost. At one point, when the three are first staring the tour, the Treasury official who has arranged the tour, invites the mothers of the less fortunate Marines at Iwo Jima to attend a party. When Hayes meets the mother of his close friend, he breaks down and sobs onto her shoulder, holding onto her.<br /><br />Paul Walker, Robert Patrick, Barry Pepper, Jamie Bell and others pop up as other members of the Marine Corps, serving with the three survivors. Unfortunately, they make little impact and as the other three men mourn their lost comrades and I fought hard to remember their names every time Phillippe, Bradford or Beach mentioned them.<br /><br />Perhaps the best part of the film is the depiction of the story behind the image. As the film progresses and we work our way through the various elements, we learn more and more about the iconic image. For instance, the flag was originally raised by another group of Marines. A photographer takes a picture of that as well, but the film is ruined. Then, because of other factors, the flag is raised again by Doc, Ira and Rene, among others. This photo survives. In the States, they tell the Treasury official of the first flag, who responds \\"Is anyone else getting a headache?\\" He wants to avoid this public relations nightmare.<br /><br />And this photo strikes a chord with the public, giving them hope during an increasingly difficult war. Naturally, the government seeks to capitalize on this, immortalizing the moment in a dramatic painting, ice cream sculptures and reenactments. This powerful act, this image, became a public relations tool, an icon to get the message across. The government began to sell an image of this war the three men know isn't true,but they go along with it, to help the war effort.<br /><br />Technically, \\"Flags\\" is a well-done film. You would expect nothing less from Clint Eastwood and producer Steven Spielberg. They bring an eye to detail for every scene, recreating the States during the mid 40s, recreating the battle, searing these images into our brains. But they seem to have spent most of their effort on this, forsaking some of the character development. All the set dressing in the world can't help make Doc or Gagnon into three dimensional characters. Then, when the story starts to visit these people in the present, we lose any emotional connection to them.<br /><br />Why is Doc's son writing the book? Why is Doc apologizing for how he raised his son? Because these questions are never answered, they will be the images and ideas from \\"Flags of our Fathers\\" that will live with me.<br /><br />Next up, the Japanese point of view of the same story.government was hoping for, and to help promote the war bonds it so desperately needs to sell. <br /> <br />In almost every scene, Hayes is fighting with someone, trying to maintain the integrity of the battle they fought for Iwo Jima, or drowning himself in drink, because of all of the friends he lost.

B000H0MKOC|5.0|Well, how compromised can the morality of a story be and still be funny?  This story is not about smoking, but about lobbying for the smoking industry (and alcohol and guns and ...).  The compromises are on every side of this story.  The politicians who uses causes and principles as poses for re-election, the family members who want to distance themselves from the lobbyist standing up for the \\"bad\\" thing, but still willing to live well off of the proceeds.  It is also about all the lies we tell ourselves and the excuses we make because we \\"have to pay the mortgage\\".<br /><br />Nick Naylor (great name for the character, huh?) is a lobbyist for the tobacco industry and is at the top of his game.  The movie opens up with him on the Joan Lunden show with a whole host of anti-smoking folks including a teenage boy dying of cancer.  Nick turns it around by explaining to the audience that the tobacco industry wants the boy to get well and live so he can continue to smoke.  It is the anti-smoking government agency who profits with a bigger budget if the boy dies.<br /><br />Naylor is divorced.  His ex-wife is living in what used to be his house with their son, Joey, and her boyfriend.  When Nick goes to career day and greets Joey on the way to the front, the boy whispers a plea begging Nick to not ruin his childhood.<br /><br />I don't want to take away the enjoyment of discovering this wonderful plot from you, but one of the great bits in the story is the weekly lunch Nick has with his friends who are lobbyists for the liquor and gun industries.  Together, they call themselves the MOD Squad (Merchants of Death).  One of their ongoing debates is who is responsible for the most deaths.<br /><br />In the end, while things move on, they don't really get much better.  Some things are learned, but the world remains what it is even if the cast changes a bit.  But it was a fun ride.<br /><br />Surprisingly, there is NO smoking in the movie.  There are quite a number of uses of the f-word and other swearing - so keep that in mind.  And since there is a plot twist that involves Nick having an unwise affair, there are some sexual situations, but no nudity.<br /><br />A fine cast with some pretty big name stars (Robert Duvall, Sam Elliott, William H. Macy, with Aaron Eckhart as the Beaver - I mean Nick).<br /><br />Enjoy the shenanigans.f-word and other swearing - so keep that in mind.

B0009I7NNA|3.0|Upon hearing this, my first impression is that it's a weaksauce version of Megadeth. Seriously. It's just another of those new, generic, \\"metal\\" bands that seem to be popping up every so often. While it's not really BAD per se, it does have a lack of distinguishing traits and creativity that make a good band.
B000FZERIG|5.0|Naturally, after years of being only allowed 1 or 2 songs on Beatles albums, George Harrison had a huge backlog that essentially made his first solo album ALL THINGS MUST PASS (1970) completed except for the recording. With Phil Spector having been entrusted with the presentation of the Beatles' final album LET IT BE, it was perhaps only natural he would have a hand in the solo work of the Beatles who actually appreciated his involvement (i.e. not Paul). Save for the APPLE JAM album that was intended as a bonus, but instead shot the price of ALL THINGS MUST PASS up to triple-album level, George's first solo effort showed that he was going to do just fine on his own.<br /><br />However, because ALL THINGS MUST PASS was a rousing success both commercially & artistically, it was likely George would have trouble coming up with material on his next album, and the prevailing opinion from most fans was that all his subsequent solo albums had that trouble. No doubt, George knew he had a tough act to follow with 1973's LIVING IN THE MATERIAL WORLD, but writing songs was the least of his worries.<br /><br />Initially, George was going to work with Phil Spector again, but he had trouble making the recording sessions & thus, has only a co-production credit on one song. Now, George is the one in the driver's seat guiding an album that is the stripped-down affair he wanted from the beginning. But George chose to record the album at Apple Studios instead of Abbey Road, and the differences in recording techniques were staggering (Apple's had nothing on Abbey Road's). After abandoning LIVING IN THE MATERIAL WORLD to work on the Concert For Bangladesh, George returned to it & at last managed to get things to fall into place.<br /><br />George's second #1 hit came with the gentle lullaby \\"Give Me Love [Give Me Peace On Earth], which continues the help-your-brother & make-the-world-better vibe that the Bangladesh concert was all about. After the Wall of Sound delights on George's first #1 \\"My Sweet Lord\\", the more organic mode on \\"Give Me Love\\" is quite refreshing & a lot less stifling.<br /><br />Even with that ray of sunshine, George is still aware that the world is not quite as rosy as all that. Songs like \\"The Light That Has Lighted The World\\", \\"Who Can See It\\", \\"Be Here Now\\" & \\"The Day The World Gets 'Round\\" have George facing that cruel world around him, and he basically says that even with all our imperfections, we can still find hope & inspiration. It is just that all of us need to look for them as individuals; we will not learn much by having someone tell us the answers.<br /><br />The legal fallout of the Beatles' disbanding was still fresh at the time of LIVING IN THE MATERIAL WORLD, and George bravely exposes all the wounds at the heart of those battles. \\"Sue Me, Sue You Blues\\" wonderfully demonstrates the endlessly tangled web that the Beatles had become simply by breaking up, where it got to the point that hardly anybody knew who they were suing & why. \\"You serve me/And I'll serve you/Swing your partners, all get screwed\\" is simply brilliant & wickedly hilarious at condensing all that legal red tape. The title track is an even more pointed dig at the Beatles' legal situation, even daring to mention George's former bandmates by name. It is a wonder yet another lawsuit (this one of defamation) did not come resulting from this song.<br /><br />True, being a Beatle may have helped George Harrison be financially set for life (though the royalty situation would take even longer to sort out), but he did not let that blind him to his spirtuality. \\"The Lord Loves The One [That Loves The Lord]\\" reaffirms the Biblical concept that \\"the Lord helps those who help themselves\\", and while it is a true statement, the overall song seems to be one instance where George tried to hit people over the head with his religion. He sounds much better when he keeps those views in check. That being said, it is still a listenable song on an album with 11 of suchin all.<br /><br />\\"Try Some, Buy Some\\" was the only song which Phil Spector had a direct hand in, and while he is a CO-producer, his influence is still more than palpable. The lyrics are a little difficult to decipher, making it hard to say if this is a love or anti-love song. It is still a wonderful production all the same, showing that even on a back-to-basics album like MATERIAL WORLD, a little panorama never hurt anyone.<br /><br />Finally, there are simple songs of devotion that show George mastering the art of melody that Paul McCartney already had locked down years before. \\"Don't Let Me Wait Too Long\\" is a bouncy delight that would have made it an excellent follow-up single to \\"Give Me Love\\". It all closes out with the masterfully rendered \\"That Is All\\", a song that manages to be as expansive as a Phil Spector production even with the rootsier approach George favored. His vocal is stunningly beautiful, reaching falsetto range in parts that almost pierce the soul.<br /><br />I would imagine since this was recorded while George was still with Apple Records, it only now has gotten the remastering treatment, long since overdue. While the sound is certainly better & clearer, the bonus tracks, while still only a few at 2, manage to get it somewhat right this time, as opposed to the obviously-flawed Dark Horse reissues. \\"Deep Blue\\" was originally the B-side to \\"Bangla-Desh\\", which became a top 30 hit in 1971. It was smart to include \\"Deep Blue\\" because it was one of George's finer songs, but like some people have said, forgetting about including \\"Bangla-Desh\\" was a bit of a blunder. In my opinion, it would have been better to have that song on here as a bonus track than \\"Miss O'Dell\\", as upbeat & lighthearted as it is.<br /><br />Still it is great that LIVING IN THE MATERIAL WORLD finally got the deluxe treatment it deserved. Now all that remains are similar refurbishings of DARK HORSE (1974) & EXTRA TEXTURE (1975). As fatally flawed as they may be, they still appear to have their fans & I think people would pay to purchase them again. It would also be interesting to see what songs were scrapped in favor of obviously inferior ones that made the cut.<br /><br />Even with recalcitrant producers, shoddy recording conditions, and behind-the-scenes legal wranglings, George Harrison managed to perservere & indeed create a worthy follow-up to the magnum opus that was ALL THINGS MUST PASS. Some people call that the best Beatles solo album, and they may be right, but they should not forget that George did create some fantastic material afterwards. It was simply those high standards set by ALL THINGS MUST PASS that rendered anything in its wake less than stellar. LIVING IN THE MATERIAL WORLD, for the most part, shows what a little production restraint can do for George Harrison's music.

B000G759LW|4.0|Everybody knows Christina Aguilera is probably one of the best singers to come out this century.  Her amazing abilities are reknowned around the world.  But her recording career hasn't had nearly the international success of, say, Britney Spears despite Christina being an obviously better singer.  Why is that?  For one thing, Aguilera has always lacked the burgeoning charisma of Spears, which doesn't help one keep fans.  But how does her old school jazz and R&B tribute record Back to Basics sound?  Pretty good.  Back to Basics is a likable attempt that is respectable, but affected.  Songs like the touching \\"Hurt,\\" circus-influenced \\"Welcome,\\" 50s jingle-tribute \\"Candyman,\\" sultry \\"Save Me From Myself\\" and ballad \\"The Right Man\\" all showcase a singer at her best.  But at a lengthy 23 tracks, the nonstop trademark Christina wailing gets a little tiring--an issue that's hurt previous albums.  And Disc 2 (in which all of the aforementioned tracks appear) is far superior to Disc 1.  First hit \\"Ain't No Other Man\\" is likable enough (it appears on Disc 1), but isn't the best choice for a first single out of all 23 songs that comprise Back to Basics.  So in the end there's a lot here that's good (the singing is great, the production is great and the music is respectable) but it's far from perfect.
B000002B7U|4.0|_The Ultimate Sin_ is for me a triumph, a tragedy and a heap of sentimental memories.  A triumph because it pleasingly represents Ozzy's so-called concessions to the glam-rock of the moment without ever ultimately compromising his style (exemplified by \\"Shot in the Dark\\" and the somewhat lush production); a tragedy because it represented the swan song for the fine, criminally underrated Jake E. Lee (even worse since it has been allowed to lapse out of print); and sentimentally because this album was one of the reasons I picked up a guitar - a passion which I have pursued for close to 18 years since.   <br /> <br /> <br />The Ultimate Sin is that while the Ozzman's fans nowadays have embraced the chunky, generic nu-metal stylings of the (overrated IMO) Zakk Wylde, and the pioneering neoclassical grace of Randy Rhoads,  Jake has literally been written out of the books.  Some would say considering who he followed he never had a chance.  More of a bluesman than either of those two, he nevertheless turns in sensational riff work here, opening with the decidedly un-glam title track (as crushingly heavy as anything else in Ozzy's catalog).  His soloing, while somewhat restrained on the previous album, simply soars here, such as \\"Thank God For The Bomb\\", the ridiculous shredding on \\"Never\\" and the magnificent hammer-ons runs during \\"Secret Loser.\\"  The coup de grace is the multifaceted epic \\"Killer of Giants\\" which starts out with some of the most beautiful guitar work ever laid down on ANY of Ozzy's albums, gently cascading arpeggios which build to an eloquent fingerpicked verse riff.  The song eventually builds towards a stirring Lee solo topped off by a storming, doubletime midsection, before returning to the chorus to end.   While Jake's real talents are arguably better served by the three Badlands albums that followed, his work with Ozzy remains the great undiscovered metal country of the eighties. <br /> <br /> <br />Ozzy himself has curiously distanced himself from this recording, which is infinitely better than its immediate predecessor.  I think the real problem with this album isn't Jake, or the increased presence of keyboards, rather its Ozzy's lack of songwriting focus due to continued struggle with drugs and especially alcohol, which was nearing its crescendo during this period, which rendered him unreliable and difficult to handle for even his uber-promoter wife and manager.  The lyrics tend towards the generic (\\"Never Know Why\\", \\"Lightning Strikes\\") and often sound confused (the nihilistic \\"Thank God For The Bomb\\" forced to share space with the reflective \\"Killer of Giants\\").  But the album is ultimately saved by the conviction of the musicians.  Do yourself a favor and give this one a chance.
B00007146V|4.0|I watched this film with some reluctance, as it was not the film I would have chosen, even though I had previously seen the two other Austin Powers films and enjoyed them. Well, am I ever glad that I did! It was, without a doubt, the funniest Austin Powers film to date.<br /><br />From the great opening scene to the surprise ending, replete with cameos by Tom Cruise, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey, Danny Devito, the Ozzie Osbourne Family, Steven Spielberg, Britney Spears, Burt Bacharach, Quincy Jones, Nathan Lane, Katie Couric, and John Travolta, the film is a laugh riot. Austin Powers (Mike Myers) still has his mojo amd, together with his gorgeous female sidekick de jour, Foxxy Cleopatra (Beyonce Knowles), sets out to rescue his father, Nigel (Michael Caine), from the evil clutches of the notorious Dutchman, Goldmember (Mike Meyers). To do so, they must go back in time to 1975, the era of disco fever.<br /><br />Fans of Dr. Evil (Mike Myers), Fat Bastard (Mike Myers), Number Two (Robert Wagner), Scot Evil (Seth Green), Frau Farbissina (Mindy Sterling), Basil (Michael York), and Mini-Me (Verne Troyer) will be happy to know that they are all back in this film. Mini-Me very nearly steals the show, and he does this without ever uttering a single word. Fred Savage joins the party as Number Three/The Mole and becomes a running sight gag throughout the film for reasons that will be obvious to the viewer.<br /><br />The only problem in the film is with the character of Goldmember. He is the weak link, as he is simply gross and not particularly funny. What was Mike Myers thinking? Notwithstanding the fact that the title character is pretty much of a zero, however, the film is still hilarious, overall. The plot, what little there is, primarily exists to set up a lot of sight gags, send ups, and a number of very funny scenes. If, however, scatological humor offends your sensibilities, this is definitely not the film for you. If you are not easily offended by the crude and the lewd, then this film will make you laugh up a storm.lewd, then this film will make you laugh up a storm.

B00006JSS8|5.0|I love this album so much. It is one of the best collections out there. I listen to it all the time. It has a great mix of his songs. I also cook to it and end up dancing and singing along. I also plays this when company is over and everyone loves it. You cannot help but move your body when listening to these classics. It is a great fun collection and will not disappoint you.
B00000GAIW|4.0|One other reviewer comments that this 1998 \\"re-issued\\" CD is much duller sounding than the \\"remastered\\" Tull releases. I own the 2001 remastered \\"Stand Up\\" and \\"Benefit\\" CD's and they sound noticeably brighter and maybe a bit more powerful.    An A-B comparison of this '98 \\"re-issued\\" CD with the very first ('83) CD version, shows the '83 version having brighter treble, but that version also had so little bass that it sounded like an Edison Cylinder recording. Boosting the bass on the '83 version helps - but there is still an annoying edge to it. So I must admit that the '98 re-issue is much more comfortable and satisfying to listen to all round - and the bass really does kick exactly where it should. It just seems that the treble could have been raised slightly.     I was also surprised to hear the '98 re-issue opening with a repeated 6 note arpeggio for Aqualung (rather than just one for the '83 version). I know, from early 70's memories, that the '98 version is the correct one.     This '98 version boasts \\"Prism SNS\\" digital processing for noise-reduction and claimed enhancement in remastering from the stereo mastertape, and it may well be that this is as good as we'll ever hear because the original multitrack tapes may no longer be usable:-    Jeff Rougvie writes in the booklet for Rykodisc 20th Anniversary (2004) 2CD set about their experience of going to a storage facility to collect the original David Bowie tape catalogue which they'd just bought from him: \\"We hired a heavily insured and bonded antiquities mover to handle the transfer. The New Jersey place was a pit - it was like an old jail with open doors and loading docks, so the materials inside were exposed to the outside air. It wasn't climate controlled. The tapes and artwork were stored in a concrete cell. The hallways were littered with master tapes of legendary albums. The employee that led us to the Bowie vault kicked the multi-tracks for Jethro Tull's Aqualung out of the way with his hand truck. Now you know why so many early CD's sounded so rough - the technology wasn't up to today's standards, but the bigger issue was finding an appropriate source tape.\\"
0743270754|5.0|While reading Goodwin's book, I was reminded of what a freind of mine once said about trust, \\"No one is of infinite trust, but everyone is of infinite value.\\"  He was speaking in a more spritual/religious way than a political/utilitarian way, but his advice is certainly in keeping with Lincoln's recognition of the talents of those who at first treated him with contempt and condescension.  Goodwin does a masterful job of providing bigraphies of each man, showing their talents and their demons as well.  I was especially impressed by two of the characters who stand out---Seward and Chase.  Seward joins the cabinet as Secretary of State but expects to be the de facto president, and is much surprised and eventually won over by Lincoln's political saavy and intellect.  Seward showed the best in human nature in his ability to remain open to having his opinion changed in regard to the man he came to serve and respect.<br /><br />  Chase, on the other hand, showed himself at every turn to be of great ego and little character, constant in his schemes and ruminations, and even open criticism of Lincoln.  One becomes impatient waiting for the ax to fall as Chase continues to work against Lincoln.  Then, when Chase finally does leave the cabinet, Lincoln, in a great act of magnanimity, appoints him Cheif Justice of the Supreme Court, realizing that despite his faults, he is best qualified for the job.<br /><br />  Aside from being an exceptional account of the Lincoln administration and cabinet, this also is a wonderful textbook on how our political leaders could work together if ego could be set aside in the name of the common good.  And Lincoln's is an example of leadership at its finest.  If you're a Civil War buff or a student of leadership in any discipline, this book is a must read.
0743270754|4.0|It is a compelling book about one of this country's greatest politicians. One can not help but compare President Lincoln to leaders in our lifetime.  Lincoln was vilified, denounced as a buffoon, and called incompetent by his rivals for office.  Yet they were defeated.<br /><br />He was considered a novice among leaders, with limited experience.  Yet he led his cabinet and country with skills that were unparallel through the most tumultuous times in our history.<br /><br />They called him a backwoods lawyer with limited communicative skills.  Yet he became one of the most eloquent speakers in our history.<br /><br />I learned and was reminded of many lessons while reading this monumental piece of American history.  One lesson is that people can live up to levels of expectation created within themselves. I recommend this book as a definitive guide for anyone in a leadership position and for all who have been told at some point in their lives; \\"It  can't be done!\\"<br /><br />Reggie Johnson, Success-Tapes.Com
B000FTWB7G|4.0|It appears that more and more people are starting to debate how well an album is by the song lyrics today.  That is exciting news as I have always took into consideration the song lyrics and the story of the song as key elements to whether or not I could play it over and over again.<br /><br />As for this Evanescence album, the lyrics seem to be a bit weak despite the great story behind why she wrote the song Call Me When You're Sober.<br /><br />If you are interested in discovering more about the lyrics on this album check them out online (see my name tag if you don't already have a favorite site).
B00004TWZF|4.0|I have loved this movie since it came out in the 80s.  It's beautiful story filmed in gorgeous locations with great actors, but there is one thing that keeps it from getting five stars in my book - and that's the director's cut.  I was originally thrilled to find the director's cut but I found it too much changed from the movie I grew up with.  The haunting melodies in the soundtrack are gone and the ending (I won't spoil it) is not quite the same.  Some of the \\"additional footage\\" runs a little long.  My kingdom for the theatrical version!
B000GCFO0I|3.0|I would say I liked this movie more than I disliked it. The acting was pretty good, effects were awesome, the plot was strong and I liked the ending. I was a little scared but I found the movie more creepy than scary. It's certainly better than a lot of horror/thriller stuff that has come out lately. It contained some fairly grusome stuff but was surprisingly low on actual blood and gore, I think it could have used more in this area. Also, I persoanlly think the whole 'gates of hell' concept is overdone in movies but I never played the game so maybe I am missing something here. The ambiance of the movie overall was wonderfully dark and it was well paced with good action. I did like it and I would watch it again and would suggest it to anyone who likes a good scary movie.
B000007O9L|5.0|This is a wonderful addition to the Stones legacy--with emphasis on the acoustic guitar.  You can hear every strum, every nuanced lick by magicians Keith and Ronnie (and sometimes Mick, I would imagine, plus very sharp harmonica) that is sometimes lost in the electric versions, classic and irreplaceable though the originals are.  Nothing will take the place of the originals, but these acoustic tracks are so different and enjoyable that I consider this a MUST-HAVE for any Stones fan.  Five stars all the way!
B00003CXXP|1.0|This movie was cheeseball beginning to end...I thought the concept was corny even before I watched it but decided to give it a try anyway. Big mistake. A robot who can love? Lame! And with all this high tech stuff the docs can't bring the couple's real son out of a coma (or whatever was wrong with him) so the parents forget all about him and get some robot kid who can 'love' but lacks the common sense of a human making him a danger to himself and everyone..Brialliant plan (especially considering the amount of orphan human kids there must be in this messed up futuristic world)..Then the real son wakes up and comes home and thats when the problems with the robot kid begin. The family decides they don't want the robot and the mom 'loves' him so much she dumps him somewhere instead of sending him back to the lab to be humanely disposed of...It was then I knew I was smelling a stinker but NOOOOO someone else wanted to watch it till the end until he soon found out the horrible truth...I have since nicknamed it Artificial Idiocy...The worst part was the end, Ugh, I don't even want to get into it but those of you who see the title of my review above and have seen the movie know what I mean. The whole plot was muddled and full of holes with no sense of realism. For those of you who have not seen it, I suggest renting it before you buy it. Maybe this movie is great for some people, it just wasn't my thing.
0767817486|1.0|Don't you love that studio deceit where they say something is \\"based on\\" a true story -- which they then think means they can distort and falsify virtually every single detail?  But after they've already changed and twisted every significant event in it anyway, why didn't they just say it took place in the mythical country of Xenophobia, instead of going ahead and viciously maligning an entire nation of the kindest, friendliest, most hospitable people on Earth?    The one TRUE fact is that Billy Hayes was a convicted drug smuggler who got caught red-handed. (Apparently the film-makers think that Hayes being a well-heeled American should entitle him to special exemptions from the law.)  Everything else is a lie.  The girlfriend?  Didn't exist!  The climactic (and inexcusable) \\"nation of pigs\\" speech?  Never happened!  Our macho \\"hero\\" firmly rejecting the advances of the blond guy?  Read the book -- Billy Hayes himself says that sometimes they made love.  Even the biting off tongue and escaping scene at the end is nothing like what really happened.  Virtually every detail of it was false, even the location.    Billy Hayes was never raped in the Turkish prison -- but if the real Billy took those blond curls of his into an AMERICAN prison, I'll bet he sure would have been.  He'd never be able to walk again.    I find it utterly contemptible that the film-makers rounded up a cast of ARMENIANS and GREEKS to play Turks as being a bunch of hideously sadistic goons.  Were they really that ignorant of history?  Not to mention that the worst and most brutal one was played by the very American Paul Smith.   There wasn't a real Turk in the pack.     Oliver Stone apologized to the Turkish people when he finally visited Turkey, and he was kindly forgiven -- but I sure wouldn't have let him off so easily.  His self-serving \\"apology\\" was far too little, and far too late.
B000BB1MI2|2.0|This movie creeped me out and not in a good way. Johnny Depp is an awesome actor and I usually find him sexy but in THIS stinker I find him really creepy and gross. Maybe it's the Michael Jackson-ish look he has going on with the black wig and white face. Could they have picked a more horrible look for WW? He looked really feminine and mime-like. It looked like they took him to a costume store and put a 10$ wig and 5$ clown makeup on him! Depp's character had a really awkward and uncomfortable feel (done on purpose but not in a funny way) with bizzare, dead sounding dialogue. The musical numbers were not catchy and there was an odd lack of music through the rest of the movie giving it a really inhuman, unnatural ambiance. I also disliked the one guy playing all the oompa loompas, it looked really fake like a clone attack and did nothing to make the movie more watchable. I love Tim Burton's other movies but this one sucked BIGTIME! It gives a new perspective on Willy Wonka but this Willy is someone I would keep kids AWAY from. This movie is childish if you're an adult and pales compared to the original. If you're a little kid it's way too dark and scary and has 'humor' that is hard for most people young or old, to understand. I found myself asking, \\"Was that supposed to be funny?\\" on multiple occasions. The children (other than Charlie, who is underdeveloped) are really mean and bratty to the point of being unwatchable(as if we need more bad examples for kids!) Maybe I am biased because I loved the original Gene Wilder version. I would have been open to seeing a remake if it was GOOD but this movie was dissapointing. All the actors in this movie are very talented and it's a shame to see that something about this movie just didn't 'click'. This movie was not really about kids, or fun or candy, it was about Tim Burton falling in love with his own work and failing to realize how lame it was. Tim needs to stick with his own original stories (Corpse Bride for example, wasgreat) and I think it shows a huge ego when someone tries to remake a classic movie like this! It's amazing how so much money and effort go into special effects and expensive sets and the script is hollow and lousy. The whole thing just had a creepy vibe with almost sadistic undertones. It has a very cold, lifeless feeling to it and had none of the warmth and joy of the original, almost like someone made a bad parody of WW. I didn't laugh, I didn't cry, I wasn't entertained in the least and I think this fails as a kids movie and as a grownup movie. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I love Depp and Burton, if you are not a fan of either, don't waste your time with this steaming pile of poo!
0670034711|5.0|I want to buy a copy of this book and give it to all of my girlfriends. I found it poignant, hilarious, fun, delightful and a wonderful read. It came into my life and just the right time and has inspired me to \\"reset\\" my own life and follow a life long dream of living abroad.
0385336691|5.0|My Reacher books (I'm in Australia) all come with the blurb on the back cover heralded by: \\"Jack Reacher./Men want to be him./Women want to be with him.\\".  Personally I think this is cheddar city and actually detracts from the books appeal to the uninitiated.  If they hadn't been recommended to me I'd have probably picked one up, seen those 3 lines and gone 'gag,no way'.  I think I'll tell Lee Child myself via his website.  I'm a woman and I'm NOT reading the Reacher books to go gooey over Jack's attributes!  I will say this, they are cracking good reads and I hope he doesn't make the mistake of writing more in the first person.  Message to Lee: above blurb NOT A SELLING POINT!  Cheers!
0393061434|5.0|As someone who has been working as a software developer for five years, it's easy to take for granted all the amazing inventions around me.   Looking around my living room as I write this, I see three personal computers within ten feet: a laptop, an XBox, a dvr.   All three have made my life better and each can be directly traced back to Woz's work. <br /> <br />This book really opened my eyes.  It's incredibly fascinating to hear the incremental steps and revolutionary leaps that Steve and others took to make the PC a reality.

I recommend it to all engineers and inventors!
B00003CY0V|2.0|Even though it's used by a lot of reviewers, I have to use it too. The opening scene has John Travolta staring into the camera delivering a monologue about how Hollywood creates **** lately. He mentions that it would be great if the bad guy got away in the end, then later in the film he talks about Harry Houdini and misdirection. Oddly, this film was produced by Joel Silver, who I can list as a creator, or at least a deliverer, of said Hollywood ****. There's only 3 reasons really to watch this film, none of which have anything to do with the story, which shows you just how the film is. <br /> <br />Stan is a talented hacker who's been down on his luck since being released from jail. Dead end job, unkempt trailer and denied rights to see his daughter. Well, an opportunity comes when a woman, Ginger, offers him money to meet with a man. That man, Gabriel, is incredibly wealthy and will pay him 10 million dollars to create a computer virus that'll net him near 10 billion dollars. Of course, it doesn't help that the feds are after both of them <br /> <br />Those 3 reasons? Well, the first is an incredibly awesome looking shot where we get a 180 slow motion pan (it is NOT a full 360) after an explosion goes off and we see it's aftermath. While the full version of the X-Men Last Stand shot found in the special features looks better, this is just as great. The other is at the end where a helicopter flies a bus all over the city and smacking into buildings while the 3rd is of course a nude sunbathing Halle Berry which apparently she was paid a handsome sum of money for each breast shown. However, that's kind of where the good parts end. <br /> <br />The biggest problem is that it's an action movie based on the lowest common denominator. It's super-stylized and sleek and has some pretty big sequences but that's it. Some action films like Die Hard inexplicably hold up on repeated viewings. Here, after the first watch, you've probably experienced all you're going to see. Theyadd in the daughter subplot which isn't as developed as it should be but it did resonate with me. The film does have its fan but it's hard for me to like something so....plastic. <br /> <br />Should you buy it? I doubt it, unless you want a show-off disc for your home theatre, something that other films do infinitely better.
B00000DC10|5.0|When 1-4-5 progression skate punk ruled the roost, this was something different.  Hardcore bands usually ran full steam at 4/4 and their poppier brethren followed the South Cal sing-along formula of the Descendents/NOFX/Operation Ivy/Face to Face, etc.<br /><br />I bought this album when it was released, I was a bit hesitant... I was not a huge fan of the hardcore scene at the time (Earth Crisis, Strife).  This album, was like a revelation.<br /><br />So many people deride it claiming that better music is made today: I don't agree with that, but some people don't like Fugazi either.<br /><br />Radical politics aside, the album takes many ideas of the 60s protest movement and pushed the limits of hardcore (at the time).  Incorporating electronic beats, varied time signatures (jazz interludes, even), and technical guitar work to create something new.  It really was new eight years ago, this band touched off thousands of imitators.  It is sort of a Sandinsta/London Calling for a new generation  Granted, there were other great hardcore bands (Snapcase and Converge come to mind), but Refused not only created a truly brilliant album, but they broke up and went on.  Reminds me of ideas Legs McNeil talks about in \\"Please Kill Me\\" (mainly the notion that all the good bands break up at their peak).  Real punk is futile and angry and basically Refused embodied it better than many of their imitators.<br /><br />In or out of the context of history, the format of the album closely mirrors several 60s era jazz albums and the Nation of Ulysees political chanting is pretty consistent with the Dischord/DC style of hardcore: politics over prancing.  This is something that is sorely lacking in the current generation of bands (eyeliner!).  Denis Lyxzen continued that same meme in The International Noise Conspiracy (which eschewed technicality for garage rock ala the Stooges).<br /><br />This is one of those albums that you really have to listen to and focus on the music (headphones).<br /><br />In the same way that Jawbreaker touched off the hordes of psuedo-poppy screamers, you can hear the echos of The Shape of Punk to Come in everyone from DEP to Thursday.  If you don't have this album, you should.hones). <br /> <br />In the same way that Jawbreaker touched off the hordes of psuedo-poppy screamers, you can hear the echos of The Shape of Punk to Come in everyone from DEP to Thursday.

B000001DQI|5.0|Call me crazy, but if you look at Elton John's face on the album cover and then look at the top right corner of the album cover in the corner of your eye, it looks like Elton John has a baseball glove in his right hand!  That's something I used to see when I was a kid.  Maybe I'm just a big baseball fan! <br /> <br />Anyway, the music on this album is simply magnificent.  Elton tried out prog-rock on the opening track, and NO WAY you can forget the beautiful mystical title song, which has been a classic for years.  Maybe the best song of his career.  Don't forget the speedy \\"Grey Seal\\" the hard rock \\"Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting\\" and the beautiful closer \\"Harmony\\".  Every song is a real treat.   <br /> <br />A double album that's completely enjoyable.  It doesn't happen much, but when it does, you better look out because this is 70+ minutes of excellent pop/rock.   <br /> <br />Let's not forget the AWESOME booklet inside, which has the lyrics to all the songs, and really neat-looking pictures for each song as well.  The pictures next to the song titles always make sense when you read the lyrics because the picture is supposed to fit the lyrics.  I've always liked the picture for \\"Dirty Little Girl\\".   <br /> <br />Elton John was never really able to top this masterpiece but he came close a couple other times with Don't Shoot Me I'm Only The Piano Player and Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy.
B000000OPZ|5.0|This cd needs to be in your collection if you're any kind of fan of 80's pop metal.  Yes, there are sappy power ballads and sappy rocking songs and sappy everything.  This cd is so sappy you're liable to get your hands sticky just handling it.  This sappiness makes for one great trip down memory lane.  It also holds up very well after all these years.
B00006HBUA|5.0|By this point in my life, it's pretty much a given that many of the things I like are going to be criticized.  Many times *severely* criticized.  I have to teach myself to deal with it and move on.    Scooby Doo is a really fantastic movie.  I don't feel bad at all for liking it.  I'm a 25 year old man and I think it's the best family movie money can buy.      I simply loved the idea of having an animated Scooby Doo living in a world of real people.  That's what this movie is- Shaggy, Daphne and everyone else can't really SEE Scooby because Scooby isn't real.  It's the main reason the movie is so special, for goodness sake.  You simply couldn't have it any other way.  Do you think throwing in a real dog would work?  No, it wouldn't, unless you found a real dog who can talk (and don't try convincing me one of those \\"I love you\\" dogs are really talking because you know darn well those are the *only* words they can say).      I believe the movie was intended for EVERYONE.  The picture is pleasing on the eyes, and the plot moves forward like a typical Scooby Doo mystery from the cartoon series.  I really don't understand the problem people have with this movie.  It's understandable if you're not a fan of Scooby Doo in the first place, but if you are, the film is exactly what you'd expect.      This movie will go down as a classic to me.  If you're along for the ride, jump in my boat.

B000H7JD4A|5.0|I first heard of Iron Maiden in 1982 with the release of their 3rd album; 'The Number Of The Beast'. That album along with their two subsequent releases, 'Piece Of Mind' and 'Powerslave', has made me and countless others devoted fans every since. I now own all 14 Iron Maiden CD's and have of course listened to them all; some more than others, some much, much more than others. Now, I don't mind telling you that while most Iron Maiden CD's are very good to brilliant I have certainly been far less than thrilled with a few Iron Maiden offerings. Consequently, although I am a longtime fan of Iron Maiden I do believe that I can still give an objective review of this CD.<br /><br />In my opinion this is Iron Maiden's best effort since 'Powerslave'. The music is once again brilliant, however, it doesn't quite have the magic and relentless energy of Powerslave. This CD does have what is among their best production and engineering. You should put on some GOOD headphones and listen to this one, the sound quality is superb. Lyrically there is no question that this is their best effort ever. The lyrics are relevant to current times, pensive, meaningful, compelling and just plain well written; which is what one might expect from a band that has been penning great music for over 25 years. However, on the other hand, one could realistically expect a band that has been together for that long to be comfortably resting on their laurels and content in putting out the same old uninspired unimaginative c**p year after year. But this is certainly not the case with Iron Maiden, and high praise is in order for this one.

B000EHSVQE|5.0|Oh my! How we judge! I like roses - you like daisies...but does that automatically make me superior to you, more intelligent than you, a whiz with proper punctuation (obviously not!)?  <br /> <br />I do not believe the trick to appreciating these movies is about \\"getting it\\". Everyone approaches life AND movies from a different perspective.  Liking or disliking a movie should not be a litmus test for someone's I.Q. I will assume that those who didn't like this movie (and GOD FORBID actually slandered \\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\\") have reasonable I.Q.'s.  No matter how tempting it is to think otherwise.  All deserve the benefit of the doubt. <br /> <br />As an aside, however, I must protest the application of the word \\"retarded\\" that was used in one review.  I find the word offensive and respectfully ask that people would refrain from using it in public forums such as these, regardless of the context intended.  It is not a nice word in this day and age to use to describe any thing or any one. Please choose another word from your vocabulary to express yourself, if you would. But I digress.   <br /> <br />There is a crowd that will love Monty Python, Best in Show, Spinal Tap, etc. and there are those that will watch these types of movies in a more literal sense, and be unable, for whatever reason, to see the humor in them at all.  To me, that is ok.  Not everyone has to like everything that everybody else does.  The difference here is that some of the \\"reviewers\\" seem to be steadfast in the idea that if a movie does or does not measure up to their own personal criteria for humor, then the opposing side, by default, MUST be stupid, or wrong, or humorless.  Can we not even practice tolerance for other people's senses of humor? <br /> <br />To me, this kind of humor, as in the other movies mentioned above and scores more like them, is priceless. To others, worthless.  To me, these types of movies, including Napoleon Dynamite, share a theme in that the humor in them is deftly wound around scenes and dialogue that must, in a way, be \\"decoded\\" in order for one to appreciate the hidden layers of humor hiding beneath the surface. If it is \\"about\\" anything it is about not taking oneself too seriously, which ever of these films you are watching. <br /> <br />You and you and you -  don't have to like them.  I think they are brilliant.  I say tomato you say toMAtoe....so what???? I say I am searching for the Holy Grail, you say you \\"already have one\\".....so let us move on brave knights, Napoleon can stand on his own! <br />

0618680004|5.0|This is an outstanding contribution to the worthy cause of freeing the homo-not-yet-very-sapiens from millennia of superstition and irrationality.  These two sides of the same coin may have served the purpose of keeping us sane through ignorance in the pre-industrial revolution days. Dawkins argues very persuasively why there is now no excuse in brainwashing our children into embracing beliefs that can only leave them damaged both intellectually and emotionally, beliefs that can make them a danger to the very survival of our species (just imagine the product of some madrassas with a finger on the nuclear buttons). <br /> <br />Some reviews try to argue that because some of the worst perpetrators of crimes against humanity were the \\"godless\\" societies (e.g. Stalin's USSR) this would somehow justify the need for a belief in god (an all-seeing judge).  Dawkins debunks such arguments very ably and all I would like to add is that while societies such as USSR may not have been founded on a belief in God they adhered to equally irrational beliefs (e.g. Uncle Stalin is always right, class enemies must be eliminated, children must be brainwashed to become loyal communists) that caused them to perpetrate the well documented crimes against humanity and eventually self-destruct. I fear that self-destruction could be the outcome for humanity if the religious \\"memes\\" win the competition with the memes \\"replicated\\" by the \\"brights\\". <br />

6305546789|5.0|John Carpenter set the standard for the classic horror film with this low-budget 1978 story of an escaped murderer who returns to his hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois. Paying homage to such celebrated classics as Hitchock's \\"Psycho\\", \\"Black Christmas\\", \\"Eyes without a Face\\", and even Orson Welles, Carpenter took what he was given and ran with it, giving audiences one of the most high quality, suspenseful slasher flicks ever made, relying on atmosphere--the fear of not knowing what will happen, and who may be lurking in the shadows--rather than blood and gore. With frequent point-of-view shots of both villain (Michael Myers) and victim (Jamie Lee Curtis), viewers are able to enter the mind of both good and evil to see how both are perceiving the events that are taking place within the film. Followed by countless sequels and endless imitators, \\"Halloween\\" will forever remain one of the best horror films, if not one of the best films, of all time.
B00009UW0N|5.0|When John Carpenter and Debra Hill decided to write The Babysitter Murders back before 1978, thank God Moustappha Akkad and Irwin Yablans brought up the idea of the infamous and youthful holiday of Halloween. Otherwise, the world of filmmaking would have a hollow bottom and thousands, if not millions, of children would actually sleep at night.<br /><br />A cold October night in 1963, young Michael Myers stabs his sister, Judith, to death in the upstairs bedroom of a quaint Victorian house in one small town, Haddonfield, Illinois. Fifteen years later and several silent hours in an insane asylum, Michael Myers, now twenty three, returns home...<br /><br />Halloween is one of those films you think about and realize two hours have gone by day dreaming. It sticks with you. The many images, from the leaves falling over children trick or treating to the dozens of jack o' lanterns on porches, form a part of an American institution. Where the horror and macabre conjoin with youth and adolescence, there is 1978's Halloween.<br /><br />Jamie Lee Curtis, at the start of her career, plays the typical high school teenager rampant across America. She is innocent and free, something anyone can relate to, and her fine performance here encompasses all of it. Donald Pleasance, on the other hand, would become the character written for others, but in all reality was meant for him. His somber yet dedicated aura glows across the film.<br /><br />Director John Carpenter and cinematographer Dean Cundey accomplished the unbelieveable: they created another world. As old as the film is, Haddonfield and the world inside Halloween is absolutely timeless. The storyline is an urban legend told around campfires. Everyone loves a \\"return to home\\" story, of course even moreso involving a maniac on the loose. From the Victorian homes to the wide open lawns, the American dream is both encapsulated and broken.<br /><br />Although blamed, indirectly of course, for the start of the slasher genre, Halloween lacks any of the gore or \\"dark porn\\" as many followers have accomplished and purveyed. Aside from the rare nudity, Halloween could be rated PG. What you do not see and what is not there is what sticks and keeps you in constant fear from beginning to end.<br /><br />For those of you who have never seen it, this is a treat and a rare one. Especially considering the month, this is the best and most important time to watch what I consider one of cinema's classic masterpieces.<br /><br />Happy Halloween.nre, Halloween lacks any of the gore or \\"dark porn\\" as many followers have accomplished and purveyed.

B00006RJHG|4.0|Bob Clark's 1974 chiller classic, which went on to inspire many elements of \\"Halloween\\" and \\"When a Stranger Calls\\", is definitely one of the better, if not best, horror films out there. Period. Not high on blood, but very high on suspense, dread, atmosphere, and out-of-the-dark surprises. A sorority house (to include the lovely Olivia Hussey, the vulgar alcoholic Margot Kidder, and SCTV vet Andrea Martin) falls victim to vicious, violent, and altogether menacing phone calls during the Christmas holidays. Soon, students on campus begin turning up missing. Though some events do go unexplained (which could be positive, considering the mystery involved) and the film tends to go borderline predictable in some sorts, this is undeniably one of the creepiest horror films, with the most tense, moody photography ever captured on film. Keir Dullea and Margot Kidder turn in quite effective performances. Highly recommended.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|Not since Michael Jackson's Dangerous has an album in pop been so catchy and memorable. With American Life, Madonna stressed the need for a different take on her life, yet lost all the fun and jazz that was Ray of Light and Music. Confessions on a Dance Floor digs deeper. Madonna takes her favorite songs from the disco age, dusts them off, and spins them around on the record player.<br /><br />Take for instance, \\"Hung Up\\", the album's current single. With a signature riff from ABBA's \\"Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)\\", Madonna comes in with the booming electronic bass, \\"Time moves by, so slowly/ Time moves by, so slowly.\\" By the time the chorus is bouncing, you're off the wall and doing dance moves you thought your parents only did. \\"Hung Up\\" is unbelievably catchy and better yet, it's worth the entire album alone, even if tracks like the ambient, roller rink dancer \\"Get Together\\" and the foreign, body rock \\"Sorry\\" keep the pace going and going.<br /><br />One of the best albums and undeniably the greatest pop/dance album for 2005.
B0000AQS6R|5.0|We watch this movie, more than once every year during Christmastime, without fail. The best is while wrapping gifts Christmas Eve, with all of the adults that are up late, and we just laugh and laugh and have a grand old time! Enjoy! You'll love it!  <br />The version I have has a special feature where you can watch the original version, or a version that has commentary from the actors during the movie, which is also hilarious! <br /> <br />*Of course this is a full blown comedy mind you, so if you're looking for that \\"It's a wonderful life\\" message, stick with It's a Wonderful Life. Which is a wonderful movie too, along with many others.
6305972591|2.0|I remember seeing CHILDREN OF THE CORN right after reading Stephen King's short story version in his classic book, Night Shift. I was excited because King's story was such good scary fun. Well, I watched the movie and was amazed at how awful it was. While the short story had a building atmosphere of dread and horror, the movie had an atmosphere of pure cheeze. King's story was short (like 10-20 pages) and sweet, w/ sinister children and a mysterious god / monster in the cornfields. The movie has a town full of annoying brats and a cheap beasty that caused much eye-rolling and laughter. The running time is 90 minutes, including about an hour's worth of padding. COTC would have made an excellent addition to one of King's anthology movies like CREEPSHOW. As it stands, it's bloated and pretty boring. Of course, Linda Hamilton is in it, which is why I gave it an extra star...
B0000524CY|5.0|This is indeed is the scariest movie of all time. I have seen many horror movies in my time and this tops my list.  At a time when all special effects are done by computer manipulation, this movie is filled with many actual effects, which brings a certain reality to this movie and makes every scene seem like it was actually happening. All I can say is don't watch it alone!
B000F5GNX8|4.0|Detective comedy based in current day LA. Val Kilmer plays a gay private eye -- not a good casting choice. Eric McCormack (Will and Grace) or Tom Cruise would have been better. Robert Downey Jr. plays a thief turned actor by freak occurrences. I love his demeanor, he looks like he is permanently spaced out, perfect. The film tries to take on a unique narrative with Downey, the main character, narrating and changing the story as the plot progresses. This doesn't really work, but is a good idea, and could have been pulled off by a good indie director. Instead Shane Black (Writer of Lethal Weapon, Robocop, Last Action Hero) delivers a familiar style - light, fresh, and enjoyable. Michelle Monaghan is insatiably hot in this film, and it pretty much why I would see it again.
B000089RV6|5.0|It's hard to imagine that an album released 26 years ago, in August 1980, would still be selling hot to this very day.  Many of the albums that first came out back then are either out of print or selling at a much slower rate now than they were in late 1980.  Not this one.  Australian band AC/DC's first production with Brian Johnson as the lead singer is still \\"flying off the shelves\\", if you would call it that.  To this day, the album with the pitch-black cover and a title to match it have sold over 21 million copies in the USA alone, and about 40 million copies worldwide.  In the USA, this number of copies would land \\"Back In Black\\" among the top 5 best-selling albums of all time, including all of the various editions and formats that have come out since 1980. <br /> <br />This latest version of Back In Black is a new, improved version over the other editions, primarily regarding the package, and also the sound.  The deluxe digipak includes pictures and information of the band, some of which were not seen before within the album jacket.  Also, the sound quality has been enhanced, with more audible details and wider range of notes and the intensity of the beats.  This is likely the result of new digital technology, which was not quite as developed in the early 1980s when the album was initially produced.  Those listeners who have older editions in their collection along with this one can listen to them in succession and compare them.  Then they can hear the difference for themselves. <br /> <br />Within this package is a collection of ten great songs, some of which were released as singles in the USA, and many of which were heard on the radio.  Each of these tracks shares the features of Brian's screaming vocals and the trademark guitar solo act, which is found about midway through each song.  The album begins with the mid-tempo \\"Hell's Bells\\", which starts with a bell ringing, and then an instrumental intro joins the bell, and then Brian starts singing.  If you count the bell, you will notice that it rings a total of 13 times.  \\"Shoot To Thrill\\" follows, a fast-paced number which would make a good dance song for parties or night clubs.  Next comes \\"What Do You Do For Money Honey\\", a moderately fast track in which Brian performs the verses, then screams the chorus with a higher-pitched voice.  Here the guitar solo is found both in the middle and at the end.  Another moderately fast-paced selection, \\"Givin The Dog A Bone\\" comes afterward, where Brian first sings the verses; next he sings the title line and then the group echoes the title line in the chorus.  This would also make a good dance song in parties or night clubs.  Somewhat softer in volume and energy is \\"Let Me Put My Love Into You\\", in which the rest of the group joins Brian in singing a relatively melodic chorus, with good harmony.  This piece slows down at the ending part, which concludes the first half of the album. <br /> <br />The second half of the album (side two of the original LP or cassette, or starting with the 6th track of the CD) begins with the title track \\"Back In Black\\", a mid-paced song with a prominent rhythm.  Perhaps this song has significance for the group, in which they make a come-back with the new singer after the death of their first singer, Bon Scott.  It was a hit in the USA.  Another popular hit is \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\", a creative and well-written love song, in which Brian sings the verses and everybody joins in for the melodic chorus.  This piece has a good strong beat throughout, after the distinctive guitar intro.  \\"Have A Drink On Me\\" is the B-side of the previous track (on the 45 vinyl single), which also has a powerful beat and could be a good party song.  \\"Shake A Leg\\" is a fantastic dance song, which begins in a stop/start fashion but then picks up the pace.  A good guitar accompaniment to the vocals evolves into a great guitar solo in the middle with fast picking and phenomenal fretwork.  The album ends with \\"Rock And Roll Ain't Noise Pollution\\", which starts out with a slow pounding beat and a lecture.  This relatively slow-paced song makes a statement in response to criticism of rock and roll, and portrays a great finale to this musical production. <br /> <br />This album comes after the untimely death of Bon Scott, the previous lead singer for this renowned group.  Many bands might have decided to end their production of albums and songs after losing a member, especially the lead singer, but AC/DC did not give up after this tragedy.  Instead, they found a singer who could fill the role once held by Bon Scott (though he could never actually replace the original singer himself: there will never be another Bon Scott).  With his own unique voice and manner of presentation, Brian Johnson has the high energy and driven vocal style that proved suitable for an AC/DC lead singer.  This album, \\"Back In Black\\", demonstrates that with its phenomenal sales volume and popularity.  Music which is still enjoyed by long-time fans and sought out by newer listeners (many of whom were probably not even born yet when the album was originally produced) many years after its original appearance would earn the label \\"classic\\".  \\"Back In Black\\" certainly deserves this honorable title.
B000DWMN2S|4.0|Elijah Wood, who plays an OCD American Jewish youth, sets out on an Ukranian quest to unearth his history but it's his tour guides who happen to discover a lot more. Walking the fine line between comedy and drama, the film succeeds by not straying too far in either direction. It deals with difficult topics such as the holocaust, racism, and self-image. Yet, despite these topics, it manages to keep a light feel and connectedness to the viewer. The film's cinematography is certainly above average, with sweeping shots and beautiful color at times. The characters are developed, the story is moving, and the film is a good one. Kudos to Liev Schreiber for putting it together.
B000000YIQ|5.0|Sonny Rollins, Ray Brown and Shelly Mann are all superb on this 71 minute album. It comprises 6 tunes; three of which have alternate takes added as bonus tracks. The originals and alternates are similarly compelling. Although my personnal favourite is Wagon Wheels, all 9 tracks are excellent.    The uncanny sense of space and the Western mood created by the trio make the cd great listening.     I am a big fan of Sonny Rollins and his happy, muscular, witty, rich and edgy sound. This album sees all three musicians in marvellous form, with the rhythm section brilliantly creating the illusion of movement.       I would recommend this as THE album to buy to begin a Sonny Rollins collection.     No words can adequately describe the treat that awaits you; however some may point in the right direction. They are; lyrical, witty, warm and imaginative. Way Out West is most original and is one of my favourite cds.
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|Film Noir set in a California High School. It's a detective movie. Joseph Gordon-Levitt from \\"Third Rock from the Sun\\" plays Brendan, and after his ex-girlfriend winds up dead, he sets out to see who done it and get even. I loved this film, perhaps a little too much. The writing is incredibly tight and smarty pants. The characters are detailed, vivid, and lovable. Especially that Nora Zehetner who plays Laura. Rian Johnson did good by this one, and it took him almost a decade to get this film made for $500k on 35mm. This film isn't about the cinematography, it's about the story. It blew up at Sundance in 2005 winning the special jury prize for \\"originality of vision\\". You will see why.
B000H6SXMY|1.0|I never liked this show!  I tried to. I watched a few episodes.  I didn't get it.  It may have gotten a chuckle or two out of me.  But, I just don't see why this show is so huge?!  There are plenty of quality shows out there (Seinfeld, Everybody Loves Raymond, Etc) This doesn't even compare.  I say, once this set is released, and all the fans get their hands on it, that this be taken out of syndication?  I mean really, what's the point?  It's better without commercials.  For everyone who loves this show, that's great!  I have nothing against you.  I just had to say that this show is one of the most overrated pieces of crap I've ever seen!
0743289412|5.0|Many may not realize this, although some surely do, that the writings of Stephen King can be grouped into at least two types - classic King and commercial King.    See, the classic King is the real King to me.  He's the one that wrote The Stand, and The Dark Tower series.  He also wrote Misery, Dolores Claiborne, and Lisey's Story.  That's the King I love most - the one who takes us behind the basic scary and goes to the really scary, the scary inside us all.    The commercial King writes what sells.  He writes to make the publishers and the casual fans happy.  He writes what buys the groceries, don't ya know.  He wrote Carrie, and Salem's Lot.  He wrote The Tommyknockers and The Cell.  I've read both Kings, and I do love them both, most of the time.  But once you've had the best parts of King, the classic King, it's so very, very hard to settle for the commercial one.  You do, when that's all that is left at the end of the day.  You always have your dreams though, and they snuggle up tight when the shadows grow long, never letting you forget for one moment what's waiting there, just in the distance.    Sometimes both Kings collide, as they did in The Shining, It, and Needful Things.  Sometimes Randall comes through, and sometimes he stays on the other side of that purple curtain, just like King.    The saying that you can please some of the people some of the time, but not all of the people all of the time is oh so very true with King's published works (and wouldn't we all just love to know about those waiting in the wings, those not published - are they real or are they bools?  We may never know for sure.).  The fans, the critics, the literary scholars, oh to be able to please them all, just once.    As for the fans, well, the casual fans just want to be scared of the things that go bump in the night.  They gobble up everything commercial King writes and demand more, more, more.  They are never satiated, but they are the ones who buy the most of those groceries.They see every movie and they watch every interview.  But see, truth is they are afraid of so much more than what goes bump in the night.  They're afraid to look, and really see, what the real King has prepared as the ultimate feast from the pool.  That's where the devoted fans come in, for they are always there hovering beneath the purple shadows and sending their silent wishes into that long, dark night.  \\"Write the next one\\" they whispered, ever so gently, in his ear as he lay recovering from the horrible, freakish accident that came so very close to ending it all.  Okay, maybe some of them didn't whisper gently, but loudly screamed and begged for the rest.  At any rate, thankfully he complied and we were all rewarded with the ending we thought we were so desperate for (an absolute perfect ending, might I add).  But now we know he's still there, dancing with us in the shadows.  Sure, The Cell came first and it sold - they always do now.  But the more devoted of us, the ones unafraid to look at where the real horrors lie, down deep inside the human soul, and even deeper than that in some, we have been rewarded with a mere morsel of what's yet to come.  Randall's still out there somewhere, waiting.  And the purple curtains still flutter in the breezes.  And let us never forget the moon, for it watches over us all, night after night, in this world and the others.  Yes, there is so very much more to come, and while I can hardly contain my excitement on learning the rest, the other me wonders if I'll be able to endure what truly lies at the bottom of that fascinating and brilliant pool.

0060776757|5.0|This book works on 2 levels. First it is a beautiful coffee table book with lots of rare and beautiful pictures of the band. But that's not what is the most appealing to me. The text is a remarkable telling of U2's story by the band members themselves. I was surprised at how open and candid these guys are here. They talk freely and openly about relationships, motivations, spirituality - everything. They are very candid - completely unguarded about their lack of musical ability early in their career, and also some of the failings of their recorded work. I got a sense that these guys are real people with integrity. Frankly I'm amazed, that with the popularity of U2, that this book is not talked about more. This is the definitive biography of the band.

B000002O51|4.0|It took 8 years for Boston to follow up their sophomore release with \\"Third Stage\\" in 1986.  By this point the \\"band\\" (and I use that term loosely) is basically down to Tom Scholz and Brad Delp with several hired hands including Jim Masda and Gary Phil (both from Sammy Hagar's band if I remember correctly).  At the time of it's release I remember being disappointed with this album, but the years have actually been quite kind to it.  Listening to it again, after not hearing it for a long time, I actually think this one is better than \\"Don't Look Back\\".  The first half of the album is really strong starting out with the smash hit \\"Amanda\\".  The album then segues into \\"We're Ready\\", \\"The Launch\\", \\"Cool The Engines\\" and \\"My Destination\\" all of which are strong tracks and rank right up there with the best material Boston has produced.  The rest of the album is weaker, but still the songs are decent.  The closer is another ballad called \\"Hollyann\\" which is good, but a bit similar to the opening track \\"Amanda\\".  When I put this CD on after all these years I expected not to care for it much, but I was pleasantly surprised.  It has stood the test of time well and I would rank it as the 2nd best Boston album.

0399245030|4.0|Lost and Found tells the story of a boy who finds a penguin at his door and sets about returning the penguin, whom the boy assumes is lost, to his home. Along the way, the two become friends and the boy realizes that his goal of returning the penguin to the South Pole may not be the best thing to do after all. My 3 year old daughter quite enjoys this book. There is an anxious moment when the boy can't find the penguin, but by the end, all is well. My daughter likes to talk about how that part of the book is sad, but the end is happy. This is also one of those stories where kids occupy the whole world and no grown-ups are to be found. I think that is part of the appeal for young readers.
B00005JPBP|1.0|There are two magicians (Jackman and Bale) working for another magician in the 1890's. Bale  ties a knot differently and causes the death of Jackman's wife (she can't escape the knot out of a water-filled glass enclosure, and dies in less than 1 minute). Anyway, for some reason, after her death, these guys are on their own - trying to perform magic tricks in London and viciously competing with each other. Bale suddenly acquires a sidekick who wears a hat, glasses, and big mustache, and NEVER says a word (until the very end). However, both Bale and Jackman lose their English accents periodically, which is weird. The whole thing is kind of weird, lots of back and forthing, reading of a journal, etc. Jackman is mad at Bale for causing his wife's death, and Bale really gets bent out of shape about that, and won't take any responsibility.  Somehow Bale gets convicted of Jackman's murder, when there's no way he could have murdered him. Makes no sense. Then the ending - I won't reveal it, but it's moronic, simplistic, and unrealistic.<br /><br />Anybody who likes this movie is easy to please.
0618680004|5.0|A powerful intellect focused on a, arguably the, major issue of our time. With wit, charm, and an excellent personal touch, Dawkins turns his rapier on theism, and scores repeatedly. Like an evening spent with a charming and intelligent friend, Dawkins walks us through some of the best arguments against unfounded beliefs of all stripes. Nobody has done it better, or created a more informative and entertaining book. Simply outstanding.
B000063JZQ|5.0|This is a first-class FILM based on a Shakespeare play. As always, there's heavy pruning of the lines, but what we're left with is well served by the actors, the authentic medieval setting, and the medium of film itself. This MACBETH is gorgeously staged and performed. Is it violent? Sure -- but so are a lot of other films these days. Why should this be different just because it's Shakespeare? <br /> <br />Let's face it: Macbeth is a dark, bloody and -- at its heart -- nihilistic story. Can we really believe that Scotland will live happily ever after just because the usurper is dead? Shakespeare raises that question at the end, very subtly, and Polanski picks up on it. What I particularly liked here was the emphasis on how quickly ambition can poison the mortal mind, and how one's fate can turn in an instant. There's a thin line between good and evil, between the real and the unreal.  <br /> <br />My Shakespeare professor back in college ridiculed certain details of the film, such as the mysterious dagger witnessed by Macbeth actually appearing on the screen for the audience to see. The idea, as he believed it, is that the dagger is a merely a product of Macbeth's fevered imagination, therefore WE shouldn't be able to see it. But I like how Polanski makes one wonder what the dagger really is. Is it a hallucination? Or the product of some darker force? Polanski's whole take on the story balances on a question -- what is the true nature of evil? <br /> <br />Finally, I want to address all those affronted viewers who have been shaken to their core by what seems to be the most horrific sight of all: the images of naked older women. Please. Get a grip. Those are just bodies. Maybe if Hugh Hefner had really been in charge we'd have had nubile Playboy bunnies standing in as the witches but, alas, he was just the money man, not the director. <br /> <br />Polanski's witches were actually another authentic detail -- even back in those days, the idea of old women going \\"skyclad\\" was a sure sign of evil. Nine hundred years later, people's perceptions haven't changed a bit.
B000HEWEE4|4.0|Sure this movie was unbelievable at times, but it is a movie. Keanu Reeves plays a busy architect and Sandra Bullock is a doctor.  Sandra's character loses her first patient in a horrible car vs. bus vs. pedestrian accident.  She takes some well-meaning advice and goes to the place she feels safest in the world, the lake house she had previously rented.  While there she leaves a message for the new tenant, Keanu Reeves.  Through thier correspondence they fall in love, but the story must follow them through life's struggles.  But will they ultimately end up together?  Well I am not going to ruin the end of the movie.  :) <br /> <br />This move is a cross between \\"Somewhere in Time\\" and \\"Sleepless in Seattle\\" (a more obscure comparison would be Hallmark's Hall of Fame movie \\"The Love Letter\\").  It is a little slow in a couple of spots and even my husband knew how it would end before we got there.  But over all it was a good Friday night, stuck at home sitting by the fire, watching movies movie.  I recommend it. <br />
B000059TEP|5.0|Ghost' has something for everyone; mystery, murder, special effects, metaphysical landscapes and plenty of tragedy and romance to bring a tear or two to your eyes.<br /><br />While `Ghost' incorporates numerous genres of film, it is primarily a tale of romance between Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze) and Molly Jensen (Demi Moore) who are absolutely magnificent together. There are also wonderful performance provided by Woopi Goldberg and Tony Goldwyn that really raise this film to another level.<br /><br />A classic from '90 you can watch over and over again.
B000GY729M|3.0|THE BAND: Brandon Flowers (vocals, synthesizer, piano, bass), Dave Keuning (guitar), Mark Stoermer (bass), Ronnie Vannucci (drums & percussion). Hailing from Las Vegas, NV.<br /><br />THE DISC: (2006) 12 tracks clocking in at just over 44 minutes. Included with the disc is a 14-page booklet containing song titles/credits/times (no lyrics), band pictures, and thank you's. This is album #2. Recorded at Studio At The Palms (Las Vegas). Label - Island Records.<br /><br />COMMENTS: I wanted to love \\"Sam's Town\\" (named after a 9-story Vegas hotel and casino built in 1979). The Killers' 1st album, \\"Hot Fuss\\" (2004), was such an incredible album... I ran out and bought \\"Sam's Town\\" based on the strength of their debut. \\"Hot Fuss\\" had hit after catchy hit and garnered the band tons of accolades - most notably an American Music Award, a Billboard Music Award and a Grammy nomination. While \\"Sam's Town\\" has grown on me, it still lacks that, um...  punch. I would be surprised if this album won any of the above mentioned awards. There's no brilliant songs like \\"Mr. Brightside\\", \\"Somebody Told Me\\" or \\"Smile Like You Mean It\\" here. No need to compare their 1st and 2nd albums... they're vastly different. Having waited to fully digest this disc, I've come away with the feeling that this is more like a swashbuckling theatrical soundtrack than a rock/alternative album... something Freddy Mercury (R.I.P.) would have really appreciated. It's up, it's down, happy, sad, rock, pop and downright weird (just like some of the classic Queen albums). \\"Sam's Town\\" has several good tracks on it... \\"When You Were Young\\" (hit #18 on the pop charts, but fell quickly after 2 weeks), \\"Bones\\" (their next hit), and \\"Read My Mind\\". There's also some nice piano and acoustic moments on the \\"enterlude\\" and \\"exitlude\\". The rest is downright average, with some songs being utterly forgettable. I've read reviews here on Amazon as well as some of the well-known music mags and \\"Sam's Town\\" is a mixed bag at best (and I agree)... Rolling Stone Magazine (2 stars out of 5), All Music Guide (3 stars out of 5), Blender (4 out of 5), and Spin (3 out of 5). Billboard shows the unit sales dropping from week 1 (315,000 units) to week 2 (102,000 units) to week 3 (62,000 units)... a steady decline can't be a good thing. By the way, is that Ruth Buzzi's kid on the cover? A decent album I suppose - just expecting so much more (3 stars).Rolling Stone Magazine (2 stars out of 5), All Music Guide (3 stars out of 5), Blender (4 out of 5), and Spin (3 out of 5).

0679722610|4.0|Dashiell Hammett is the master of classic detective novels!!<br /><br />In Red Harvest a detective is called in on a private case and his client is murdered in the company town of  Personville (Poisonville by the locals)  This is the classic detached, hard guy detective, who does what he does because he wants to finish the job he started. In this case it is to find out who has murdered the man that just may be the last honest man in town.  In this company town, murders seem to be a dime a dozen, some just to mislead, others, just because.  The dialogue is sharp and brief, yet clear as a diamond!! The women can be just as hard hearted as the men, with motives that reach only as far as their wallets.<br /><br />This is another classic detective novel!!!
1573223026|2.0|This is the third book I've read by Hornby and the one I liked the least.  I thought it was mildly interesting, but most of the time I was turning pages and sighing with impatience.  I didn't believe it.  The characters were thin. If you or I wrote a book of this caliber, we'd probably sell about three books, and the reviews would be glum.  He has insight, but the story just didn't go deep enough, and I think it was glib.  I'll bet he wrote in in about two weeks.<br /><br />Disappointing.

B00003CXCD|1.0|What's all the fuss about. Ms. Hepburn doesn't act. Our leading man is plodding and mumbles half the time. Eddie Albert's restraint is utterly-unbelievable. Any two-bit paparazzi worth their weight in tin would have turned in those pictures for millions! What is Peck left with? A long life of knowing he's got a girl friend he can't touch, see, or speak with. <br /> <br />I find this movie depressing. Hepburn chooses the stifling life of a princess for the \\"honor\\", instead of following the man she loves and running down that empty corridor screaming out his name as he walks out at the end, having chucked the whole royal kit-and-kabootle for her man.  <br /> <br />Peck choose poverty instead of instant journalistic fame? Albert takes one for his buddy and is now stuck doing endless pin-up photos in his dank drab loft?  <br /> <br />I mean really people. Would you like to live with the staff at the palace? Endless \\"League of Nations\\" speeches, and all the time wondering what the man of your dreams is doing? I'm sure she'd face the fate of Lady Di trying to escape her monotonous life. And to think she may even risk marrying someone like Prince Charles, a stiff approved of by her entourage. Depressing.  <br /> <br />Peck is forever seeing what could have been as no one believes a word of what he says when he finally comes out with the truth on his deathbed. And the only source he has is the former pin-up photographer down the hall in the rest home, the one who constantly mutters at the ceiling, \\"my photos coulda been a contenda\\" while taking pictures of nurses with his 1950 pinhole camera, the one without film they let him keep for patient management sake. <br /> <br />Depressing.  <br /> <br />We should have heard a \\"WAIT\\" as Peck walks out of the last frame. Audrey running, her tiara falling to the marble floor, shoes flying off, holding her dress as the entire press corp chases after the both of them. They jump into the river again. Eddie, knowing she'd break, waits in a scooter and off they go into the roman sunset for a TRUE ROMAN HOLIDAY. <br /> <br />But NOOOOOOOOOOO......
0321213351|5.0|I had the book and found, as some of the other reviewers have commented, that it lacked complete code examples. The author has an online course (extra $s) that gives the level of detail/code that I need. I am working my way through the online material (60% through) and at this point I can say that the money on the book and the online material was worth it. <br />I suppose the real value of the book is that it convinced me that it would be worth my while spending the extra money to look at the online material. However, at this point it's hard for me to rate the book on it's own. The overall package, though, is definitely worth five stars. <br />
B000H8SFMK|5.0|A completely flawless album from the band that invented \\"Irish/rock/punk/folk,\\" or whatever you want to call them.  None of those labels really apply.  The Pogues should really be called an Irish soul band.  This album was the pinnacle of Shane MacGowan's lyrical power, which led Bono to say, \\"I don't think anyone writes better songs than Shane.\\"  From the snarling rage of the opening track, to the heartbreaking melody of Fairytale of New York, to the understated beauty of The Broad Majestic Shannon, this is an album that's hard to stop listening to.
0300108834|5.0|Typically history is told in a very dry, intellectual fashion, trying so hard not to offend anyone by being as impartial as possible. Also other books often cover such a little bit of history that unless you know was going on in the world before it, the book seems abstract and consequently, is hard to follow.  <br />This book sticks so many things together in an increadbly easy to understand format that at last the gaps between all the other history books you read are filled.  <br />And it is told AS A STORY, rather than a series of dry and uninspired facts and lists which makes it fun and intriguing to read.  <br />I daresay this book will be critised for being too brisk, or not quite as impartial as is standard these days. I can also imagine this book will generate controversy as \\"The Da Vinci code\\" did, due to its concise, sometimes oversimplifed nature.  <br />But of course that's missing the point of this book. <br />This book, as a starting point for learning ANY history of the world is an absolute must as far as I'm concerned. Gombrich is a novelist of history and this- his first work is one of the most essential reads I could recommend to anyone.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I loved every single song from the very first listen. I know this will be the soundtrack of my life for the next few months. It is awesome.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|When I first heard that John Mayer was revamping his style, I didn't understand why. Mayer now seems totally embarrassed by much of his earlier material, like \\"Daughters\\" (which I still think is a terrific song.) While I understand and appreciate artistic growth, I think it's silly for John to be embarrassed by his earlier material. I'm also not too fond of the darker image (Rolling Stone interview) he seems to be heading toward; however, that's not what this review is about.    From the very first listen, Continuum bowled me over. Gone are the candy lyrics and pop sounds. This record is in a slow, bluesy style with excellent electric guitar all the way through. The greatest thing about this cd is how it flows. Very smooth and each songs transitions well into the next.     My favorite track is probably \\"Stop this Train.\\" I love the lyrics of this song and the simple acoustic accompaniment. If I had to pick a least favorite song, it would have to be the Hendrix' cover, \\"Bold as Love.\\" I don't hate this song by any means, but I like it less than the rest of the cd. This is more a positive reflection on the quality of the cd than a negative reflection on \\"Bold as Love.\\"    All said, I think this cd is terrific. John Mayer has a huge amount of potential and this cd is the first of many good things to come, I'm sure. I just hope that John isn't so hell-bent on escaping his goody two-shoes pop image, that he foolishly goes in the opposite direction and someday becomes a casualty of the rock and roll lifestyle.    *** It is now September of 2007. One thing has changed since I did this review, and that is my appreciation for the Hendrix cover, \\"Bold as Love.\\" It took a while to grow on me, but now I can really appreciate it as being a valuable part of the cd. For my ears, Continuum is still the best pop cd to come out over the last few years, and I'm still thoroughly enjoying it. ***
B000BEZQ18|5.0|To start, Heath Ledger oozes an Oscar worthy performance.  The character he creates is as real and authentic as they come; his way of speaking, the language he uses, BRILLIANT writing.  The inward shyness and economy with words of this humble man is enough to make you want to spend an entire day contemplating in silence.  Jake Gyllenhaal's performance was riveting and excellent as well, but the real focus is on Ledger and his character.<br /><br />The scenery and cinematography is also brilliant and beautiful. The \\"big sky\\" feel, the landscape and raw nature of their surroundings lend even further into the story of this \\"raw\\" love between men.<br /><br />The story itself is absolutely compelling and real.  Regardless of what you think about gay men, this is truth about what happens in the world.  It's about how people are overcome by love, and cannot reconcile it to their lifestyle or to the way of life they have known, but yet love will live on in spite of it.  It is also one of the most heartbreaking scenes when Ledger's character discovers the shirts hung together, and utters those last lines of the movie.<br /><br />This movie is so fulfilling in many ways; touching, tender, compelling, REAL, and so very brilliantly acted and filmed.
B000EULJLU|4.0|I've had the album since the night of the internet leak before the offical sale date.  I bought the CD the morning it came out for a few reasons...the number one reason being to make sure the leaked version was real.  Well, it was.  So I've waited all this time to really review it, hoping to avoid a premature judgement of the album.   <br /> <br />My opinion is the same as many of the other reviewers in that this album just isn't as good as you'd expect it to be.  In the end, the majority of these songs will just be filler tracks for the end-of-career box set of the band's music.  10,000 Days is basicly a Mix Tape. <br /> <br />Vicarious sounds like some other band trying to imitate Tool.  That song is just a big disappointment, and I hate it.  The lyrics actually sound simplisticly pretentious.  I never thought I'd ever say that about Maynard's lyrics, but its the truth.  Its like he's trying to make some big interesting point or observation, but lacks the poetic ability to express it without sounding like a 6 yr old who just discovered a dictionary and thesaurus.  I can't believe this song is a Tool song.  I hate it, I hate it, I hate it.  Funny how it is STILL better than most other modern 'rock.' <br /> <br />Jambi is good, but like all of the songs it stands by itself.  It doesn't really cohere with the rest of the songs to form some larger piece of work, like Aenima and especially Lateralus.  Those two albums had their own sound, and any song from those albums heard by itself still sounded like \\"oh, this is from Aenima\\" or \\"this is from Lateralus.\\"   <br />10,000 Days just sounds like several individual songs, instead of one album comprised of smaller bits.  Most Tool fans seem to like this song because its \\"harder.\\"  I personally don't listen to hardly any \\"metal\\" anymore, and Tool being \\"hard\\" or not doesn't matter to me. If it is a good song, then its a good song.  Jambi is a good song. <br /> <br />The pair of \\"Wings\\" songs are good, and form their own little requiem masterpiece.  But again, the rest of the album lacks any sort of similarity with them. <br /> <br />The Pot is a good song on its own.  But it sounds like a b-side, and it is surpisingly catchy for Tool.  The message is interesting though.   <br /> <br />Lost Keys/Rosetta Stoned cinematic opening then it goes into the whole useless prophet idea. Musically, this song is kinda simple, but that sort of helps to drive the point of the lyrics.   <br /> <br />Intension is very remniscent of Lateralus.  Almost sounds like it should be on that album.  Lots of tabla and etheral sounndscapes. <br /> <br />Right In Two.  My favorite song on the album.  This also sounds like it could have been on Lateralus, except it's lacking the alchemical references in the lyrics.  This follows Intension very nicely.  They sound like they belong on the same album. <br /> <br />With the album lacking an overall coherence among the songs, it comes off sounding like a mish-mash.  Like it wasn't as well thought out as previous albums.  Like they couldn't pick a direction to move in, whereas Aenima and Lateralus, even Undertow, had an established momentum.  The lack of a this ends up sounding like you're listening to songs that were written at different times in the artists' own development.  Here's a song from when he was 23.  Here's one from after he read that one book.  Here's one from his grieving period after his mother died.   <br />10,000 Days comes off as an EP.  A collection of songs that didn't fit in on the other albums.   Don't get me wrong...the songs on 10,000 Days are good (except Vicarious).  These songs are definitely good.  They just don't form one consistent artistic package.   <br /> <br />The best I can say about 10,000 Days is that, except for the Wings songs, the lyrics are all very referential to the current political, media, and cultural climate existing in the U.S. right now.  Maybe this eclectic Mix Tape is what we should expect to come out of this decade?
B000HT386M|3.0|Back in elementary school or sunday school we were all told this tale: <br /> <br />There was this boy who was always thinking about the future, nothing could ever go by fast enough for him, school dragged on, and he was an impatient boy. One day, while laying under a tree, a mysterious guy came up to him and said \\"i know how impatient you are, you want life to go by faster, to be able to skip the boring parts. Take this ball of string, that is your life, whenever you're at a point you want to skip just give it a little tug and you will skip it But be warned: you cannot put it back in once you pull it out\\" then he vanishes. So throughout his life everytime he got to a point he didnt like and wanted to skip, like war, he tugged on it. Eventually he tugs so much that he skips all of his life, his wife is dead and the kids are long gone away. He goes to his wife's grave and cries and laments about how he wishes he didnt skip all of his life, and then he wakes up, it was all a dream. <br /> <br />Does this sound familer? That story was featured in the show Adventures From the Book of Virtues many years ago. This film is just that story with some crude adult humor and humor thrown in. Nothing special.
0375831002|3.0|I was frequently irritated by some of the weird word choice and turns of phrase.  I thought certainly it must be a dodgy translation from the German, though Markus Zusak is a second generation Austrian-German living in Australia and it was published first in English.

While it was a very easy read due to it's structure, still with it's 464 pages it was most definitely a page-turner for me. At times a bit frustrating, but not to the point where you want to give up and stop reading. A sweet story of two true friends!
B000GY729M|2.0|I bought this because I quite liked their first album and was hoping for more of the same.  My hopes are now dashed.  The only elaboration I can offer is that it's intensely boring and the lead singer's voice is somehow far more irritating on this album than it was on hot fuss.    In the interest of full disclosure, I probably wouldn't have bothered to write this review if it weren't for their inane comments about green day's \\"american idiot.\\"  I had already concluded this new album is bad before then, but probably would have kept it to myself.  I award it two stars instead of one because I feel guilty about the conflict of interest.    [after giving it one more try, i came back to try to take back the second star (but amazon won't let me).  this album is just too awful for words.  i guess if you like/can stand it, more power to you.]
B0009I7NNA|4.0|It would seem that while non-sensical screaming is still the 'hot' thing in town....A7X is blazing a new trail. <br /> <br />Or are they? <br /> <br />Avenged Sevenfold hearkens back to the glory days of metal with 'City of Evil'.  The album kinda makes you wish you hadn't thrown out all your Metallica, AC/DC, Pantera albums.  Today's most popular bands (My Chemical Romance, 30 Secs. to Mars...etc.) all seem to be cut from the same mold.  Whereas A7X seems to discard that mold (the same they shared with their first 2 albums) in favor of a tried and true classic. <br /> <br />However...it's still all been done before.  The sound, while refreshing, is still nothing too original.  Hence the 4 stars instead of 5. <br /> <br />Comments on the singles: <br /> <br />Seize the Day is probably the most heartfelt song on the disc...and it shines as such.   <br /> <br />Bat Country has GOT to be the coolest tribute to 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' EVER!  ...a little overplayed though, eh? <br /> <br />Beast and the Harlot, which seems to draw on the book of Revalations for inspiration, would seem to point out some of the poingant issues facing the world today.
0007718721|5.0|ANGELA'S ASHES tells the story of the author's childhood from his earliest memories in New York, his return to that America as a nineteen year old and the intervening years in Ireland.  His parents Angela and Malachy McCourt had met at a dance and we forced into marriage due to the imminent arrival of the author.  Neither parent was up to the task of caring for a family, it is implied that their families had been quite happy to see them emigrate to America and were less than thrilled at their return a few years later with children in tow.   <br /> <br />The McCourt children were left from an astonishingly young age to raise each other.  As the story opens four year old Francis and his three year old brother are responsible for their year old twin brothers.  Their father is usually out of work, a victim of the Depression, his Northern accent - unpopular in southern Limerick, his lack of education and his pride.  On the rare occasions that he does manage to get work he inevitably will lose the job by the third week, along with the pay envelope in the nearest pub.  Angela is perpetually pregnant, bringing the children into the world handing them over to the older ones to tend as the family sinks further into poverty. <br /> <br />As McCourt grows up his perception of his life changes, as a young child he sees his parents as all powerful beings struggling to care for the family in a hostile world.  As McCourt grows up he realizes that not all children have only sporadic meals of tea and bread, live in filth or have fathers that drink up money meant for food or rent.  By the time he reaches his teens McCourt has also come to recognize that his mother also is not the long suffering innocent victim that he had seen her as earlier.  The reader is able to see the family decline over the years to increasingly worse housing, fewer meals and yet continue to survive as the children struggle to escape their background. <br /> <br />There are tender and even funny moments in thischildhood memoir as well.  Malachy tries to show his children the glories of the Irish past, both parents attempt to put the best light on their circumstances possible, referring to the flooded lower floor of their apartment as 'Ireland' and the relatively warmer drier upstairs rooms as 'Italy'.  McCourt describes the happier moments of his childhood as well, the wild games in the streets, the exciting highlights of Confirmation or bits of enlightment when he gets a glimpse of life beyond the slums of Limerick. <br /> <br />McCourt's style is a bit unusual, many of his sentences go on to seeming infinity, making a rather slow reading at time.  The effort pays off though as he turns the bleak grimness that he describes into a sort of poetry.  This is one of those books that celebrates the indominatable human spirit, the power that some have to rise above the worst of circumstances to succeed in life.  <br /> <br />ANGELA'S ASHES is a book that belongs on everyone's book shelf, a book that needs to be taken down and read again and again.

I liked \\"Steamboy\\", Katsuhiro Otomo's 2004 film, even though the idea of a sort of industrial revolution era sci-fi did seem a little odd at first. <br /> <br />Ray Steam is a boy growing up in 1860s Manchester. His grandfather and father are both engineers, and pioneers in steam based technology. On a trip to Iceland, these relatives discovered a liquid that could be transformed into a high density, high pressure steam, which could fuel machinery with a minimum loss of energy. With this liquid, bolted up inside black metal \\"steam balls\\", almost anything can be achieved. This is science at its most powerful, and has many international eyes turned toward Great Britain. Plot and counter-plot are uncovered, intentions are made known and the Steam Castle (a giant floating fortress, powered by steam) is revealed. Ray's father wants to world to see it, his grandfather wants it torn apart. Scarlett O'Hara, an American heiress to a businessman's fortune, is just there for the ride, and for Ray's company. Ray, however, is very confused. These are very confusing times? What will he do? <br /> <br />It's interesting seeing England (and London in particular) through Japanese eyes. The London of \\"Steamboy\\" is a little on the theoretical side, everything looks well researched and studied, but it does lack a bit of that charm, warmth and pomp that the English landscape, architecture and people have. The accents and the use of British slang in the English dub, for instance, feel a little bit pushed. Still, it is a very atmospheric backdrop, and suits the story well, I thought. The characters are fairly interesting to watch, which keeps the more philosophical dialogue (the nature of science, etc) from seeming over the top. There is action, but it is diluted a bit by the atmosphere, the colours and the slabs of dialogue between shots. I didn't really mind though, left me time to think about what was being explored. <br /> <br />Special features include several making of segments, original production drawings, original theatrical trailer, and some pre-visual bits and pieces. <br /> <br />Worth a look for fans of anime, fans of the Victorian era and maybe lovers of the older style of sci-fi (like Jules Verne, H.G. Wells, etc).
B00005JPAD|5.0|Martin Scorsese's \\"The Departed,\\" a remake of a 2002 Hong Kong film, \\"Infernal Affairs,\\" is profane, violent, darkly humorous, sexy, and incredibly entertaining.  The theme is an intriguing one.  What if two handsome and brilliant young men both graduate from the Massachusetts State Police Academy but take opposite paths?  One becomes a detective but is really a mole for a big-time mobster.  The other pretends to be a gangster, but is really a cop trying to bring down the aforementioned mob boss.<br /><br />Matt Damon plays Colin Sullivan, who has been groomed since childhood by kingpin Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) to infiltrate the cops and feed him secret information.  Sullivan starts out an altar boy, but under Frank's tutelage, he becomes an accomplished liar who sells out his colleagues for personal gain.  Leonardo DiCaprio plays Billy Costigan.  His father was an honest man who held a menial job at an airport and refused to do anything illegal, but Billy's uncle was connected to the mob.  Costigan is not warmly welcomed into the police department.  In fact, Sergeant Dignam, played with a nasty and sardonic edge by Mark Wahlberg, mocks Costigan's ambition.  Oliver Queen (Martin Sheen), Dignam's boss, informs Costigan that the only way he will ever be a cop is if he agrees to work under deep cover, pretending to be one of Costello's soldiers but, at the same time, informing on him and helping to bring him down.  In a sense, Sullivan is Costigan's doppelganger, a person who resembles him superficially but embodies everything that Costigan despises.  Costello, who has never had a child, is, in a sense, Sullivan's and Costigan's twisted father figure.<br /><br />Costigan and Sullivan eventually find that living a double life is stressful and dangerous; having to lie constantly takes a terrible toll on one's peace of mind.  Complicating matters further, they both fall in love with the same woman, a beautiful police psychiatrist named Madolyn (Vera Farmiga).  Soon, both Costello and the cops suspect that there are \\"rats\\" in their organizations, and Sullivan ends up in charge of the search for Costello's mole (himself).  DiCaprio is terrified that his true identity will be discovered and he is desperate to come in from the cold before he ends up on a slab.<br /><br />Does this film sound a tad too complicated?  That it is, but the plot is not the reason to see this terrific movie.  The performances carry the day, with Nicholson playing Costello as a sadistic, lascivious, manipulative, and evil Svengali.  Seeing Nicholson's superlative performance is alone worth the price of admission.  DiCaprio shines as Costigan, an edgy young man whose desperation to escape his past leads him to explore dark corners of his personality that he would prefer not to acknowledge.  Damon is effective as a man who sells his soul to the devil and lives to regret it.  Scorsese does a wonderful job of integrating his large cast seamlessly. The lively screenplay is peppered with hilarious lines that provide needed comic relief and  the film's editor, Thelma Schoonmaker, helps maintain the film's rapid and exciting pace.  The suspense in \\"The Departed\\" builds relentlessly, just like a Shakespearean tragedy in which an arrogant hero's hubris, greed, and overarching ambition bring him crashing down to earth.o and the cops suspect that there are \\"rats\\" in their organizations, and Sullivan ends up in charge of the search for Costello's mole (himself).

B00005JOFQ|5.0|There really is so much to say about this movie, condensing it all into a short review is impossible. To put it as simply as possible, Brokeback Mountain is a work of art that slowly and almost subliminally works its way into your psyche, refusing to hint at or portray its message until the very end, at which point your emotions virtually devastate you.<br /><br />The storyline is pretty well-known now. Jack and Ennis, two 19-year-old ranch hands, are hired in the early 1960's to tend to a flock of sheep atop the grazing grounds of Brokeback Mountain in Montana. Jack, the son of an overly strict and distant father, is quick to make friends and laugh, while Ennis, an orphan raised by his brother and sister, is shy, withdrawn, and almost gun-shy of society. During the course of the summer, Jack gradually draws Ennis out of his shell and the two unexpectedly start a sexual relationship. At the end of summer, each goes their own way and start traditional families, but cannot deny the feelings they have for each other. They then maintain a 20-year romance through camping and fishing trips several times a year.<br /><br />The execution of this movie is near flawless! Cinematography is so beautiful at points, it's almost too much for the eyes to comprehend. The musical score is understated and feels perfectly at home within the film. Direction is near perfect. The film never loses focus of the two actors... from the opening scene to the end, this is a movie about them. Supporting characters are never dismissed, and though the attention is not focused on them, they are nonetheless memorable without ever stealing the scenes from the actors. The only drawback to the film is the makeup. The 2nd part of the film takes place over a span of 20 years, and shows the actors gradually aging from 19 to 39. The makeup isn't quite up to the job to make these young actors appear middle-aged and weathered. In all honesty though, I'm not sure any makeup anywhere can fully pull that off.<br /><br />As for the actors, Jake Gyllenhall and Heath Ledger played their roles beautifully. It quickly becomes apparent that the actors chose these parts not for the money, nor for any fame (it was never meant to be released as a major film), but rather because they believed in the story and wanted to portray their characters as best they could. Jake gives life to Jack in a refreshingly wonderful manner, and Heath disappears, leaving behind the withdrawn, shell-shocked Ennis.<br /><br />The movie progresses at a very slow pace. It's never boring, but throughout one wonders where the film is going and what it's trying to say. That sentiment continues to grow and almost threatens to lose you as an audience member until the last 20 minutes or so. At that point, the plot takes a sudden and surprisingly-devastating turn. It's surprisingly devastating because you simply don't expect to have made such an emotional connection with the characters, but found that you have. As the film reaches it's emotional impact, it becomes achingly apparent that it has woven itself under your skin and is now a part of you... it has its claws in you and is not letting go. As it climaxes, you're left with a rush of emotion that surprises you and that few films have ever been able to garner. It's at that point where you realize the purpose of everything previously in the film. The entire film is a leadup to one simple message, one simple premise. It's that gut-wrenching realization at the end that lingers in your mind long after you've walked away from the screen.<br /><br />The movie is honest. It documents and portrays. It makes no statement for or against homosexuality. It is unapologetic, yet compassionate. It's an all-time classic.. <br /> <br />As for the actors, Jake Gyllenhall and Heath Ledger played their roles beautifully.

B000I2J5UG|5.0|\\"The Black Parade\\" by My Chemical Romance will become a classic.  This concept CD,  a rock opera,  will withstand the test of time.  The story is centered around \\"The Patient\\" a man who is dying tragically young.  Death,  as lead singer Gerard Way likes to believe, comes for us however we want, as our strongest memory.  The Patients strongest memory  is of his father taking him to a parade when he was a boy.  Now death is coming for him in the form of The Black Parade.  Fear and Regret along with Mother War also accompany him on this journey.  The songs on this CD tear at our emotions.  We feel his fear,  his hopelessness,  disenchantment,  and sorrow.  We also feel his hope at the end in the song \\"Famous Last Words\\".  My Chemical Romance proves they have not forgotten hard hitting rock tunes like \\"House of Wolves\\" and \\"Sharpest Lives\\".  They offer us something different in the song \\"Mama\\" which even contains a cameo by Liza Minnelli and bring us to tears with the song \\"Cancer\\".  Gerard Way's voice has never been stonger or better.  He can belt out obscenties one moment then caress us with his voice the next.      <br />This Special Edition Set comes in a velvet hinged box.  Inside are pictures and a wonderful booklet made to look like a Victorian Photo Album.  The booklet begins with a glimpse into the mind of Gerard Way.  He tells of the struggles the band endured making this CD and the personal struggles he endured as well.  The depth of his emotion rings true and clear.  His brother Mikey and drummer Bob Bryar also tell us their stories and share their feelings.  Remaining members Ray Toro and Frank Iero go song for song offering insights into each one.  This booklet complements the CD wonderfully.  This CD and booklet are outstanding works of art not to be missed. <br />
B000ENWKN8|4.0|I have to agree with some of the previous reviews, there are a couple tracks on this album that just don't scream Zombie...<br /><br />I really wasn't very impressed with this album when I first got it, but it has steadily grown on me since.<br /><br />Hopefully the next album will make up for the lack of darkness on Educated Horses...
B0002W4SWC|4.0|I seem to have a pattern of reading books before seeing the movie, and then being disappointed by the movie. Such was the case with BJD. I thought it was a let down, because I loved the book, and there were a lot of really funny parts left out of the movie. But a while after watching it, I found myself thinking of little funny parts and laughing out loud. And just a little while later I really wanted to watch it again. I found that the second time I watched it I appreciated it a lot more because I didn't have the expectations of the book to compare it to. Now it's one of my favorite movies.
B000EULJLU|5.0|At first, I felt like I'd thrown $20 bucks into the wind. Then I really listened to the CD and Wow! I'm sold.<br /><br />Absolutle one of the best Tool albums to date.
B0006ZE7G2|3.0|For my generation, bottle-fed mind-journeys like \\"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\\" and \\"Echoes,\\" as well as primal, jamming instrumentals such as \\"Any Colour You Like,\\" this is when the Floyd sold out.  Transparent pandering to teenage angst and unspeakably commercial.  \\"We don't need no education\\" -- give me a break.<br /><br />Still haven't seen the film and never will.<br /><br />We were all crushed when this was released.  It seemed nothing at all like \\"our\\" Floyd -- precious little of the weird time signatures and keys, way-too-long-for-radio songs, cosmic themes, etc.  Should have included a subtitle \\"We went for the money, mates.\\"<br /><br />Of course, it's well-produced -- we'd expect nothing less of the band.  And Mother, Hey You and the breathtaking Comfortably Numb do make the album worth a buy -- grudgingly, on principle alone.  Gilmour's work on CN is, of course, jaw-dropping to anyone who's ever picked up a guitar.  It almost -- almost -- saves the double album.<br /><br />But don't expect much more from this crude, self-indulgent, materialistic nightmare from Waters.  Hard to believe he consciously prostituted himself and the band's credibility for such vulgar, base commercial success -- and harder still to believe the band would have let him.<br /><br />Perhaps it was subconscious.  The man has shared his hopes, fears and wonders with us so sublimely over the years, I'll have to give him the benefit of the doubt.<br /><br />But, conscious or not, if you look in the rock dictionary for the word \\"sellout,\\" you'll see this album cover.<br /><br />Just one fan's opinion...

B000059HB7|5.0|I first saw this movie in the early 60s, when I was a young kid, and it stayed in my mind.  It's that good.  I recently saw it with my 11 year old son, and he just loved it; this boy normally won't watch westerns.  It's that good.<br /><br />John Wayne, Dean Martin, Walter Brennan all do a great job.  Even Rick Nelson, not someone you'd expect to see in a western, does a solid job.  Angie Dickinson is very likable.  It all hangs together, and doesn't work too hard at it; just goes down nice and easy.  (Ok, I mixed my metaphors, but you get the drift.)<br /><br />What can I say, I love this movie!  If you like the classic ones, buy it, it's worth every penny.

It was heart wrenching and honest.  He is such a great man!  Here's hoping for the next President of the United States!!
0618680004|5.0|Ever since the January release of Richard Dawkins' antireligious documentary The Root of All Evil?, I have been avidly anticipating the release of his newest book in which he takes on the widespread belief in God. As a biologist at the University of Oxford, his mastery of his field and the philosophy of science, coupled with his gift for writing, renders him one of today's most important intellectuals. Dawkins has become the spokesman for atheism today as its boldest advocate and its greatest defender.  <br /> <br />Dawkins begins The God Delusion by defining the God Hypothesis as the belief that \\"There exists a superhuman, supernatural intelligence who deliberately designed and created the universe and everything in it, including us.\\" In rejecting this proposition, he upholds another: \\"Any creative intelligence, of sufficient complexity to design anything, comes into existence only as the end product of an extended process of gradual evolution.\\" Thus, Dawkins rejects any notion of a \\"prime mover.\\"  <br /> <br />Dawkins also rejects the popular notion that religion stands protected outside of the realm of debate or questioning. There is an important discussion of what biologist Stephen Jay Gould termed NOMA, or \\"non-overlapping magisteria,\\" the belief that science and religion do not conflict because they address different questions. Dawkins vehemently rejects this thesis, arguing that theologians have nothing of value to offer human wisdom, and suggesting that just because religion has nothing else to contribute to our knowledge doesn't qualify it to answer questions such as, Why are we here? And, Dawkins notes, who is to say science can't someday answer that question, too?  <br /> <br />In chapter 3, Dawkins addresses a multitude of arguments in favor of the God Hypotheses with a reply to each, followed by a bold yet convincing chapter titled \\"Why There Almost Certainly is No God.\\" As an expert in the theory of evolution, what follows is much discussion of the fossil record, the process of accumulating complexity, and an application of both to the concept of an intelligent designer. He then quickly moves on to discuss the evolutionary roots of religion in order to explain its adaptive nature in the face of its great costs in terms of money, time and privation.  <br /> <br />Dawkins then goes on to address morality, investigating why it is that humans behave morally, and scrutinizing the claim that religion is the sole source of morality. Dawkins draws from anthropological evidence to support his claim that morality predates religion, and that it is in fact religion that conforms to our innate conceptions of morality rather than vice versa. And even if it were true that humans needed religion to behave morally, Dawkins points out, this fact would be irrelevant to the truth value of religious claims.  <br /> <br />Dawkins then goes on to analyze the Bible and finds it to be morally appalling and packed with absolutely repulsive acts of bloodshed and grief. Many of the Bible's protagonists are racist, sexist, xenophobic war-mongers. The lead protagonist, God himself, is for Dawkins \\"the most unpleasant character in all fiction: jealous... a petty, unjust, unforgiving control-freak... a mysogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, ...megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully.\\" Not the omnibenevolent being Christians claim him to be.  <br /> <br />Yet, God enjoys no shortage of supporters across the world, and in the following chapter Dawkins turns his attention to religious fundamentalism. It is his belief that \\"even mild and moderate religion helps to provide the climate of faith in which extremism naturally flourishes.\\" He blames religion itself for violence and terrorism, \\"not religious extremism - as though that were some kind of terrible perversion of real, decent religion.\\" Of tremendous concern to Dawkins is the tendency of the West to treat religion as a license for believers around theworld to behave like barbarians.  <br /> <br />Dawkins is particularly alarmed by the violent nature of the Qur'an, and quoting an Islam scholar, suggests that Muslim terrorists come from the core of their Muslim communities and are motivated by a mainstream interpretation of their religion rather than an eccentric and extremist fringe interpretation. He reminds us of the Muslim riots in early 2006 that followed depictions of Mohammad in a Danish newspaper, and quoting journalist Andrew Mueller, charges that the rioters assumed \\"that the values of Islam trumps anyone else's - which is what any follower of Islam does... If people wish to love a 7th century preacher more than their own families, that's up to them, but nobody else is obliged to take it seriously.\\"  <br /> <br />In chapter 9, Dawkins addresses the topic that is of seemingly greatest importance to him: the religious indoctrination of children. Since as a survival mechanism, children are evolved to believe what parents and authority figures tell them, Dawkins believes it to be a form of child abuse to inculcate children with the \\"virus of religion,\\" to teach them not to think, and to divide them into in-groups and out-groups based on these faiths. Dawkins is also appalled by the popular habit of labeling children \\"Muslim children\\" or \\"Christian children,\\" even though children are certainly too young and uneducated to form opinions on matters of cosmological importance. We'd never refer to children as Tory or Labour children, and we should treat religions the same way.  <br /> <br />The God Delusion concludes with a discussion of how humans may achieve happiness, purpose, inspiration, and consolation in a world without God. Dawkins believes that reason is the best foundation for such human necessities, and that religion doesn't serve that purpose as well as common sense seems to imply. For him, happiness comes through an appreciation of the only life he will ever know, where he is free to investigate ourmysterious and elegant universe and enjoy all of the beauty therein.  <br /> <br />The God Delusion is interesting all the way through, with a few laughs thrown in for good measure. If the book has a single message, it is that there is nothing wrong or outlandish about atheism, and that life can still have purpose when one chooses to free himself from the delusions of religion. It is Dawkin's ambition that this book will convert readers who don't consider themselves particularly religious, or who have always accepted religious doctrines out of a perceived lack of alternatives. The more religious of the country, however, will not read this book past the title.
B0000714B5|5.0|I stumbled across this and am frankly, somewhat amazed at the negativity of some of the reviews here.  I saw this film in its full-screen glory at age 15 or so in an audience with all of four people, and it had an impact like no other movie before or since.  Research the film, and you'll find a rather strange story behind Conrad Rooks and how the film was made.  Rooks has a very interesting interview included on the DVD.  The film largely languished for more than 30 years in a conflict between Rooks and Columbia Pictures before finally finding the light of day again in the late 1990's.  Rooks is to be commended for using an Indian cast, Indian music, securing shooting locations previously inaccessible to the West, and employing the marvelous Sven Nykvist as cinematographer.  A review at Imdb talks about the effect seeing this movie had on an audience in Sweden in 1974, and I echo what they say.  I also love the Hesse book, and think the DVD makes a great compliment to it.

0618680004|4.0|Let's say I really own a Toyota Camry and then I try to convince you that I own it. So, I construct an argument to try to prove to you that I really own a Camry. After, I state my argument, you find a flaw in the argument and therefore, you conclude that I must really not own the Camry.  But, just because I can't  construct a logical argument doesn't mean that I don't own the Camry. All it means is that I am not very good in constructing convincing arguments.  <br /> <br />When Dawkin's considers the arguments for the existence of God, his logic is the same. He finds valid flaws in previous and present arguments for the existence of God. From there,  he then concludes that, since this or that argument is flawed, God doesn't exist. No, it just means that the argument is flawed...that's it, nothing more.   <br /> <br />Dawkin's does an excellent job of explaining natural selection. Natural selection, as a very \\"no gap\\", free from chance, natural phenomenon. He describes it as, almost a mechanical and methodical builder of complexity. The logic? out of the simplicity of natural selection, complexity is born.  <br /> <br />He then asserts that, in speaking of the existence of God, because the universe is so complex,the God who created it, would have to even be more complex than the universe, and that's just statistically impossible. The logic? if complexity exists then, it must of come from something more complex.  <br /> <br />But wait! There is a contradiction...simplicity birth's complexity, but, in order to have complexity,  something has to exist that is more complex. What? fine, if that's true, then all I have to say, to deconstruct that argument, is that God works in the same way as natural selection. God is simple and out of his simplicity came the complex universe.  <br /> <br />Dawkin's also, talks about theories of the origin of life. He discusses that although it may seem statistically impossible, it happened. Well, I could say the same thing about the existence of a complex God. Although it may seem statistically impossible, for the existence of complex being, even more complex than the universe, God exists.  <br /> <br />Another of his arguments is, who created the creator? That's like asking, what existed before the universe, that created the universe? Did it create itself, wait, that's not possible. It comes down to this, either you believe in the eternality of the universe or the eternality of God. What if they both are eternal? Is it a false dichotomy, having to choose between God and science? Can't they coexist? <br /> <br />Dawkin's target's the most extreme cases of people in religion and situations. It is a very exclusive analysis, there are people, of course, who believe in God, who would stand in agreement with Dawkin's charge against an oppressive literal theological viewpoint. <br /> <br />Finally, he talk's about the destructive force of religion and the belief in God. Although people do things in the name of God and religion that are destructive, it doesn't mean that God doesn't exist. It means that people twist and distort the belief in God and the practice religion to accommodate their agenda. People appeal to a higher authority to justify their evil actions. But, again, that doesn't mean that God doesn't exist. All it means is that you have a crazy person speaking in the name of God and committing atrocities against society. That's like saying, there was someone in the city claiming to represent you and was shooting innocent people, so we are here to arrest you!

I was a young man when the terror at Munich occurred - I remember with clarity and outrage. Yet, there is no real horror transmitted to the audience - only the constant confusion of watching a depressing and rambling film.<br /><br />I guess the people of the world must hide under their blankets and hope nothing bad happens again. Why ever take action against those who want destroy the free world? Gosh, you could make a mistake!<br /><br />In war, there is never a fair and balanced response - only more death and destruction. The hope is that you hurt the other side more than their capacity to hurt your side. Then, hopefully, they decide to stop and the world gets another brief respite until the next war.<br /><br />Avoid this film. I wish I had not seen it.
0060776757|5.0|U2 by U2 is a book to possess. Unlike so many coffee table books, it's actually better for what it says than for what it shows. Furthermore, this is no exercise in self congratulation, as so many of these sorts of books turn out to be, it's something much greater. Amid a lot of terrific photography is a story as told by those from deep within the inside of the thirty-year project in music and social awareness that is U2. Anyone who ever accuses this band of narcissism and egotism should read this self-deprecating exercise in honesty, humility, and passionate gratitude for all the blessings these four men from Dublin acknowledge they've been given. Long before this quartet played arenas filled with adoring fans, they were unknown Irish boys with big dreams and a lot of almost innocent ambitions. Since their early start on homemade instruments in the mid-1970's, U2 has become not only the greatest rock and roll band active today---achievement enough in and of itself---but as headed by its conscience, U2 has been the force behind humanitarianism truly worthy of a Nobel Prize. U2 by U2 will only disappoint those who want the band to be iconic rather than human. For others, this is a testament in words and pictures to four decades of ups and downs, brilliance and endurance, and it is also just a plain and simple darn good read.

I f*ing hate puzzles, but if I liked them, I think TOOL is what it would feel like to finish one: Hard to piece together but gratifying in way that embarrasses you when you try to explain it to non-fans. By the way, I hate it when people over-analyze an album. It must be done in this case. Just like a bunch of other critics have written, each new TOOL album is immediately disappointing because you know what you want it to sound like. Then it grows on you like an allergic skin reaction and you can't stop scratching (or listening to it). <br /> <br />Saw them in concert last month in DC and it amazes me how diverse their fan base is. You have powdered goths and young doctors in the same space, and no one's being operated on. I wouldn't thank too many musicinans for their work, but TOOL gets my gratitude. \\"10,000 Days\\" is truly collectible along the lines of \\"Darkside,\\" \\"Use Your Illusion,\\" and \\"Mezzanine.\\"

But this movie is all about the jets, as Val Kilmer admitted on the Mark and Brian radio program, saying \\"the jets were all woooosh!  And then the jets were all like wooosh!\\" <br />There is a lot of cheese in this movie, and it has a very predictable plot.  But overall it is worth the adrenaline rush.  I have probably watched this thing 20 times by now, and have many of the lines memorized.  Though it helps that many of the lines repeat themselves, such as \\"Pull up!  Pull up!\\"  And of course this is the movie that gave to guys everywhere the now classic line \\"Talk to me, Goose!\\"  That's a go-to in difficult times... <br />Review by Adam Platts, Northridge. <br />
B000J0UD94|5.0|Director Ridley Scott brings Columbus to life in this impressive film which, when released in 1992, coincided with the 500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus's discovery of new lands surrounding two unknown continents. For this reason alone, the film deserves to be treasured by viewers all over the world. The subject of Conquest Of Paradise, of course is Christopher Columbus, played wonderfully by French actor Gerard Depardieu (Green Card, Cyrano De Bergerac). Depardieu brings a lot to the role, and creates a realistic portrayal of Columbus. I can't see how any other actor, could bring more to the role, than Depardieu did. In terms of casting, Depardieu's a perfect fit for this role, he resembles Columbus, has a nice smile and sort of a middle age appearance to him, with his long shaggy hair. The rest of the cast shines, and engages the audience. Armand Assante, Sigourney Weaver and Michael Wincott are among some of the film's cast members, and the performances they give are solid. The film succeeds on four of its noteworthy merits. The first one would be Scott's directing, and his reputation for incorporating vivid & gorgeous images into all his films, the second one would be its historical accuracy, the third one would be its score, composed by Vangelis, who can create gorgeous paintings like Scott can, but only to the music he makes. Finally the fourth one would be the casting of Depardieu, who can add spice to basically any film that he stars in.     When this film was released most critics were too analytical about it, and the film didn't draw in big crowds. Now, how films like this get lost amongst the trees, is really mysterious. I think this film's a classic, and maybe others will once this film gets its deserved exposure. The film is full of defining Columbus scenes, it's like traveling back in time, if you haven't seen this film, please do so.    This is the 1492 Definitive Edition release out of Brazil. It is region 0 (ALL). It is the first widescreenrelease available in the U.S. The quality is very good and it worth to pay a little more because it is widescreen.
0743289412|5.0|Fantastic!  This is real literature that is pure pleasure to read. I am a fan of Stephen King anyway, but every now and then he really wows me all over again and thats what he did here with Lisey's Story. I was actually depressed when the story was over and I had to put the book down. What a great story teller Stephen King is! This is a must read.
0312335164|4.0|I just finished reading Digital Fortress tonight. I must say that I liked it. This is the first book I've read by Brown. I found his writing style to be very readable. <br /> <br />After reading this book, I scanned some of the reviews that had been posted to see what others thought. Some of the reviewers made comments that lead me to believe the writers read the book with skim-for-speed tactics, as their comments did not quite seem to follow all the storyline and character development. I am a read-every-word-don't-want-to-miss-anything reader, and therefore I read slowly. <br /> <br />The only things that stuck out in the book as being very, VERY, odd (to me) were the choice to make the assassin a deaf man and the fact that he used a very expensive silencer on his revolver. I hope everyone knows that silencers don't work on revolvers. Perhaps the assassin did not know that because he was deaf. That about does it for what I consider to be flaws in the book. When I was reading it, some characters did things that seemed inconsistent with the way they had been developed. Nonetheless, Brown brought closure to each character's motivations for their actions - and he did it well. <br /> <br />I have read one of Clancy's NetForce books and I truly enjoyed Digital Fortress more. I have also read several of William Gibson's books and I must say that while very different, Brown's work in Digital Fortress was as enjoyable to me. <br /> <br />Digital Fortress is a good story. It is smooth reading. Give it a try.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|I first had a chance to listen to the album on an aol preview and I must say I was blown away. At first I was a little thrown off by the changes in the way the songs were written and played, however, after listening to it a second time through I realized why I love Amy and the guys so much. Amy proves that you don't have to take ninety percent of your clothes off to sell a record. All it takes is a little talent, okay so she has a whole lot, and an unwillingness to compromise who you are. Also another huge point was the amount of strings and chorus work that was used on this album. It brings a whole new side to their music and what this band has been able to accomplish with a few minor changes. Amy still has her amazingly haunting voice and she tests her range a little more which is awesome. I definitely recommend this album to any one who loves music. Don't have any preconceived notions going in because this is a much stronger and a more mature Evanescence. I don't think you will be disappointed.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|This is a perfect western and also one of the last of that genre for a long time. \\"Once Upon a Time in the West\\" has cinematography that is brilliant. The environmental shots add to the plot and there is a slow build up until the unnervingly ultraviolent climax. Each scene fits in a post modern apocolyptic take on law and justice in the western genre. Auteurs had always had a fascination with westerns (such as Jean Luc Godard with Johnny Guitar) but \\"Once Upon a Time in the West\\" obviously was mined for great effect by Quentin Tarantino (consider both Kill Bill movies) and other aficenados. Without elaborate special effects or hip irony, a story about corruption and murder is revealed scene by scene in this cinematic masterpiece. And with Dario Argento credited for the \\"screen story\\" you could tell great minds were at work in putting this together.
B000I5Y8ZU|2.0|Wow, what happened to MCR? The MCR that was portraied with blood on there hards in bullet proof vests? The band that assured me that \\"vampires will never hurt you\\". (If you don't understand that refrence your to young keep moving) <br /> <br />I remember sitting in my room and hearing MCR for the first time, so hard, so oringinal, so.....screaming. When they first emerged on to the scene MCR were so hardcore, and had a huge potentional in the underground scene where you dont get 13 year old kids talking about how good they are. <br /> <br />There are many new influences that you can hear in the new album. White Stripes, Pink Floyd, Queen, just to name a few. But what happened to the punk Danzig I and half the world fell in love with? <br /> <br />As for the review part this album is really not worth the money, I downloaded it and I fell kinda robbed for the thirty minutes I spent downloading it. If you like this album hey thats cool MCR turned into what you enjoy, but if you are here to give MCR a bad review and you had never listened to them before, then take a look at their first album and maybe even their second, but please if you have ever liked MCR, STAY FAR FAR AWAY.
B0000024TQ|5.0|I agree with Mr. Flaherty that this is a better album than Bridge.  I got this album around the time it came out.  I also got Bridge when it came out.  I don't own Bridge any more but now have this one on cd.  While Bridge had some good songs, I grew tired of it.  Not so with Bookends.  Just this morning, I listened to this cd and really got into it as I was commuting.  At different times, certain songs on this cd appeal to me.  This morning it was At the Zoo.  I think PS's song comments on a lot of things.  One, in particular is how we anthropomorphize animals with all sorts of human inventions: \\"Monkeys stand for honesty, Giraffes are insincere ... Zebras are reactionary, Antelopes are missionaries ... Hamsters turn on frequently.\\"  Yes, it's a gas.
0307237699|1.0|Senator Obama is handsome, he's smart, he's charasmatic, he's this, and yes, he's that.  You know what?  I'm handsome, smart, and charasmatic, but no one is touting me for president. <br /> <br />This guy is a dyed in the wool liberal, but at least he's honest about it.  Compared to Illinois's other senator who is an opportunistic chameleon whose tack to the left corresponds in lock step with his ascendency in his party, at least with Obama you know what you're getting. <br /> <br />I'm grown quite tired of all the hype around this guy.  Sure, he's smart and he might be the only immovable object in the path of the irresistable force of that other junior senator, the one from New York.  But point to ONE thing he's done (besides pen no less than two memoirs within a couple of years of each other--imagine being in your forties and having compiled two memoirs!).  Name one piece of legislation with his name on it.  He's non partisan you say?  Show me one vote in the senate where he's broken ranks with the democratic caucas.  I'll hang up and listen to your answer. <br /> <br />Aha, just what I thought.
B00005JKCH|5.0|Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)~ Tobey Maguire is a brilliant super hero movie. Sam Raimi has written a stupendous script and picked the right actors to be in it. Tobey Maguire is brilliant in the role of Spider-man and Defoe is sublime in the role of the Goblin. Kirsten Dunst is so cute and adorable and the perfect love interest for spider-man. The special effects are well made and I must say that I was very surprised by the overall quality of the movie. Great music, well written dialog and action scenes that were action packed and not overly violent. I highly recommend this movie and give it 5 stars. I can not wait to watch part 2.
B000FTWB7G|3.0|I received this CD from a relative.  I really couldn't believe the darkness in this album.  Amy Lee's recent breakup come screaming through with raging anger and deep dark sorrow.  I hope she has removed these from her system.  Amy Lee has a very beautiful voice, and it is a shame that she is singing from the dark on most of the cuts.  She does appear to be recuperating by albums end.  The later tracks are not too bad.  I still think the previous album was much better.  I hope she continues to sing, but come to the lighter side dear girl, you certainly have the voice for it.
0375831002|5.0|There are some books that are so good that I almost hesitate to write a review.  How can I find the words to tell you how good the book is?  How can I share with you the ways in which my heart changed and filled and bled because of reading the book? <br /> <br />The Book Thief by Markus Zusak is such a book.  I picked it up from the library shelf because it was about a young girl in Nazi Germany.  It seems that I can never read enough about WWII and the horrific things that happened in that awful era.  It's not that I want to suffer (because I do when I read about Adolph Hitler who also had a gift for words) but because I am still trying to understand how it could have happened, how human beings could have turned against other human beings in such terrible ways and how some people had the courage to protect others even when it put their own lives and everything they considered dear in jeopardy. <br /> <br />The narrator of this book is Death.  From Death's viewpoint, we learn about: <br />  <br /> \\"A girl <br />  Some words <br />  An accordionist <br />  Some fanatical Germans <br />  A Jewish fist fighter <br />  And quite a lot of thievery\\". <br /> <br />Are you intrigued as I was?  Do you want to learn more about \\"a girl\\", Liesel Meminger, who learns to read from her foster father who plays the accordion?  I was mesmerized with this little girl whose love of words turned her into a book thief.  I fell in love with a story about a girl like myself, who cherished books, who reveled in words, whose entire life was colored by this obsession. <br /> <br />I have found that it is a rare male author who can write well about girls and women but Markus Zusak has an incredible gift for describing Liesel and her world.  In general, he writes beautifully in a way that sang to me.  He weaves color into his descriptions in a way that I have not seen before: <br />  <br /> \\"The last time I saw her was red. <br />              The sky was like soup, boiling and <br />  stirring.  In some places it burned. <br />  There were black crumbs, and  <br />  pepper, streaked across the redness.\\" <br /> <br />The narrator, Death, prepares the reader for the taste of what is to come in this beautiful tale.  For it is the time of Hitler, the time of terrible suffering and death for innocent Jews, the time in which some people risked their lives and everything they had to stand up against the Nazis.  <br /> <br />I don't want to say too much and give away any of this story.  If you love words and the ways in which they can alter our lives irrevocably, please read this beautiful book, one which I will never forget.   <br />
0743564170|5.0|Finally, LITERATURE!!! Real, classic, vibrant literature! Modern writings lack so much of the depth and color that classic literature retains. As someone who rallies to antiquarian bookstores seeking a book to \\"fall\\" into, to find this wonderful find was such a joy. It lived up to my expectations and hopes. Very like Dickens and Wilkie Collins (one of my all times favorites) this novel immersed me into the lives of the characters. I FELT, and SMELLED and HEARD. It was wonderful.<br /><br />I opted to purchase the audiobook and was so pleased to hear the voice of Lynn Redgrave. Her voice was the epitome of the character of Vida Winter. I could listen to her read or speak for hours and hours. I hope she makes this a second career!!!<br /><br />By all means, if you enjoy a book that will take you to another world, another time, another place, escape into this book, you will not be disappointed.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|I've been a fan of UK rock trio Muse ever since I heard and fell in love with `Newborn' off their sophomore CD `Origin of symmetry', which prompted me to dig up their awesome debut `Showbiz'. I always thought they sounded a bit like a more accessible `Ok computer'-era Radiohead.<br /><br />`Black holes & revelations' is their fourth studio CD, and set to be their biggest, having already hit #1 in the UK and earning them rave reviews from even the snootiest of critics.<br /><br />For the most part, they ditch the Radiohead sound (though lead vocalist Mathew Bellamy still has that desperate/aching Thom Yorke delivery) and add a bit more danceability into the mix, and it works very well.<br /><br />Opening cut is the brilliant `Take a bow' (no, definitely not the Madonna hit) with its dizzying swirling synths and gradually soaring layered sound, just like a rocket. Similar is the incredibly catchy Depeche Mode-like `Map of the problematique'.<br /><br />Current single `Starlight' is an upbeat rocker with swirling keyboards, fuzzy guitars and a sunny sound; very catchy. The falsetto sung `Supermassive black hole' is set against a deep bassline, whining guitars and great harmonies on the chorus. Great!!<br /><br />`Soldier's poem' is a soothing ballad with an almost country feel and haunting backing harmonies. `Invincible' builds up from a soothing start to a jubilant climax, while breakneck buzzing guitars announce the rocking `Assassin'.<br /><br />Every song stands out really, `Exo-politics', the flamenco guitar driven `City of delusion' and the similar styled mournful epic `Hoodoo' (with its radical tempo shifts), and closing is the galloping, aptly titled `Knights of Cydonia' with fuzzy guitars, swirling synths, a Queen inspired bridge, and a triumphant sound.<br /><br />This album is a stunning revelation.

0152048049|4.0|My husband picked this book up since he remembers it well from his childhood. He wanted it in our classic collection for our children ~~ and this book definitely belongs there. It is a classic novel about life. The narrator ends up in the desert and while looking for water, he runs into a little boy, who just happened to be from another planet. And this is his story. <br /> <br />This is an observation of what it means to live. This is a story that pokes fun at businessmen, kings and so on ... but at the same time, it provides a sad truth that a lot of people miss when rushing around in life. The Little Prince talks about tending his own planet that only has one flower on it. He talks about love. He talks about hope and dreams. It is a very vivid story that makes you stop and think. And it is a classic ~~ I recognize the truths even sixty years after it was first published. It is still the same as it was then. Life is too short to fret over everything.  <br /> <br />This is definitely a book everyone should read at one time or another and plan to re-read it over the years, as a reminder that life is precious.  <br /> <br />10-27-06

Almost.<br /><br />When strange, threatening messages began appearing from a mysterious \\"A\\", the girls must face their past and the dark secrets they thought they had buried forever.<br /><br />PRETTY LITTLE LIARS is an eerie novel that gave me the chills with every chapter.  Well-written and full of suspense, I'm sure it will attract many readers and also make a popular television show.  With a cliffhanger ending, I definitely cannot wait for the sequel ([[ASIN:0060887338 Pretty Little Liars #2: Flawless (Pretty Little Liars)]])!<br /><br />Reviewed by:  Safia Abdul
B000001GQQ|5.0|Do not pay any attention to the person who called this Cd dreadful! The person who wrote that review expressed very umusical comments on something he won't ever be able to understand because it is higly musical. Worthless words that this reviewer spends damaging anybody else but himself. Buy and enjoy this Cd which bears the signature of two great musicians who know a great deal about tempo and real music!
B00005JMYI|4.0|I personally feel that Will Ferrell is one of the funniest men alive.  He makes everything he touches hysterical and worth watching, to me at least.  I do know those who can't stand him...those people I am not friends with...HA.  Anyways, so that said I couldn't believe it took me so long to see `Anchorman' but it was just one of those movies that slipped through the cracks for me, despite the fact that all my friends kept insisting I watch it.  So, after watching `Talladega Nights' I just knew I had to see `Anchorman' ASAP. <br /> <br />While I don't feel it's as much a riot as `Talladega Nights', `Anchorman' still holds my attention and induces quite a few belly laughs.  The whole idea of Ron Burgandy (Ferrell) fighting to keep his position as the favored anchorman after the hot young thing Veronica Corningstone (Applegate truly holding her own against this hilarious cast) comes into the station and threatens to steal his thunder.  Aided by his all male posse, including Paul Rudd, David Koechner (gets a bit obnoxious and annoying at times) and the hilarious Steve Carell, Ron does his best to distress Veronica in an attempt to get her fired and or to quit.  <br /> <br />The whole erection scene (sorry, I had to bring it up) while at first had me thinking \\"not again, does every comedy have to do this\\" really turned out to be one of the funniest scenes in the film...that whole \\"It's an optical illusion\\" line was brilliant.  I've only seen the unrated version so I'm not sure what all is different so if I mention a scene that you haven't seen or that you don't see after renting it then I'm sorry...must not be on the theatrical version.  Just look for the Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson and Tim Robbins cameo scene...it's outrageous, unrealistic and brilliantly hysterical. <br /> <br />Great Ferrell comedy that is sure to please any of his true fans, and just might gain him new ones.  I'd recommend `Talladega Nights' over this film only because it never lets up and never gets even the slightest bit annoying...
B00005JPBJ|3.0|I work at my movie theater so I saw this today at an emplyee screening.  Here is what I have to say,  Saw 3 brings us more of what we want.  More gruesome scenarios, more sick and twisted gore images, more characters reaching the peak of their insanity.  While those scenes will please hardcore fans of the series this movie does fall short from the first 2.  My only real issue of this movie was that was just too long.  The first 2 films were roughly 1 and 1/2 hrs.   This one is over 2 hours.  What was good about the length of the first 2 was that they were able to keep an intense atmosphere since they were not as long.  I suppose since this film was alot longer, it was hard to keep up the instense atmosphere and instead, the makers had much of movie be based on Amanda's (Shawnee Smith) character developement.  They are many memory sequences from the first and second, even footage that we have not seen.  Although it was intersting to see those, it was just too much.  It slowed down the intsensity of the film.  There are points where you just wanna get away from the memory sequence and flash foroward to the present timeline so you can on with the movie.  Other than being slow, I think this movie has more than it needs to please its audience.  Here is the plot.  Doctor Lynn Benlon (Bohar Soomekh) spends her days working at the hospital and then later coming home to what is soon to be a failed marraiage.  She is now one of the new subjects in Jigsaw's (Tobin Bell) final game.  With the help of Amanda, Lynn is captured.  Apparently Jigsaw's cancer is just about to finish.  He is reaching the end of his life, but he wants to be alive to see what the outcome will be of his final game.  Jigsaw was once treated by Doctor Lynn, now he wants her to to keep him alive long enough to see the end of his game.  The Rules for her is that if Jigsaw dies, she dies.  Jigsaw latest game involves Jeff (Angus Macfayden) a man who lost his son to a drunk driver.  But what was worse is thatthe man was set free after 6 months.  He has been hell bent on revenge for yrs now and now he'll have the chance to do so.   His game involves a certain twist.  Instead of his life on the line, He will control the fate of other ppl's lives.  Other ppl who were involved with his son's case whom could have made a difference in the case's outcome.  Now their lives will be in his hands because they are put into fatal (and sickly brilliant) contraptions.  He is being tested to show if he will be willing to forgive them or stoup to a level lower than them.  Can Doctor Lynn be able to keep Jigsaw alive till Jeff completes his test??  All in all in definetly a fun way to spend the night.  More gore, more blood, more F@%#d up $h!+.  If you love the first, def check this one out.
B000002G7G|4.0|John Cale left The Velvet Underground after their second album, and his absence shows on their eponymous third album.  He was the avant-garde musician to Lou Reed's avant-garde lyricist.  Cale's departure did not entail a decline in the quality of the Velvet's records, but that was to some extent the result. The tension between the two pushed both of them to their limits, resulting in the most far out popular music ever recorded at the time.  With Cale's departure, Reed chilled out quite a bit.<br /><br />Not that The Velvet Underground and Loaded, their final album, are bad. They simply lack the elements that made The Velvet Underground the band that they originally were. On their third record, the Velvets started to sound like a more staightforward rock band, which is a large part of why some people (including me) love it. After all, it showed that the band that recorded \\"European Son\\" and \\"The Gift\\" could also record conventional songs. It is this contrast that is so appealing. Still, it was the fearlessness of the debut and its follow-up (White Light/White Heat) that were to make VU one of the most important bands of all time.<br /><br />The opener, \\"Candy Says\\", is beautifully sung in an unlikey falsetto by Doug Yule, for whom this song was his first appearance on a VU album. It was also the first of several Lou Reed songs in which a melancholy and/or jaded female (eg, Stephanie, Lisa) \\"says\\" something. Songs like this one showcase his empathy/sympathy for others in an honest and poetic fashion.  And just as the CD opens with a high-pitched voice that isn't Reed's, it closes with \\"After Hours\\", which is sung in a childlike voice by drummer Moe Tucker. There isn't a lot of electric guitar on this record, but when it does appear - on the classic Velvets tracks \\"What Goes On\\" and the \\"Beginning to See the Light\\" - it is restrained and tasteful, not a feedback-laden headless chicken.<br /><br />The only remnants of the 1967 version of the band are on the epic \\"The Murder Mystery\\" and \\"Some Kinda Love\\".  The former it is not as musically noisy as something from the previous two records, but the overlapping vocal layers provide a cacophony that recalls the \\"early\\" days. This a wonderfully adventuresome track - more so even than \\"Sister Ray\\" - and proof that Lou Reed could toy with conventional song structure without John Cale. And it was quite clever to include this song near the very end of the record, by which point some listeners may have been lulled into complacency by the more normal songs. (That is,  if they haven't already been tipped off by the fact that the song is nearly nine minutes long.) The mid-tempo rocker \\"Some Kinda Love\\", meanwhile, recalls the kinky sexual fantasy of \\"Venus In Furs\\".<br /><br />The remainder of the songs are generally pretty strong. \\"Pale Blue Eyes\\" and \\"Jesus\\" are stark folk ballads, although the latter's \\"I'm a drug-addicted rock star, save me!\\" attempt at irony will be a bit transparent to today's listeners.  \\"I'm Set Free\\" is another decent mid-tempo number, but \\"That's the Story of My Life\\" is a bit of a dud, as it relies a bit too much on the approximate rhyme of \\"life\\" and \\"right\\", just as one the best songs on the disc relies on the exact rhyme of \\"light\\" and \\"right\\".<br />But the better songs on The Velvet Underground make it an above average record, even if it is below the extremely high average for the band that recorded it. Besides, the very essence of this band was to challenge listeners' expectations, and on this album they did so almost if not at least as much as they had on their debut and White Light/White Heat.ome Kinda Love\\".

B000I2J5UG|4.0|Look, this is a damn good album, but it's not a 5 star album.  A lot of the songs and styles probably sound new to a lot of people, but they're not.  Most are nice spins of cliched genres. <br /> <br />With that in mind, the album is a great eclectic mix with some polished singles like Dead! and perhaps Mama (listen to Green Day's \\"Misery\\"), House of Wolves (listen to \\"Hit the Road Jack\\"), and one of the ballads like Cancer or Famous Last Words.    <br /> <br />Three Cheers is to Black Parade as Dookie is to Warning.
0895260131|5.0|It's one thing to have an opinion...another to offer arguments based upon facts. This book cites facts about Islam, often by quoting the Koran, and not by presenting anything \\"out of context\\". Every example is backed up by thorough research, with references cited. <br /> <br />When you see the video of the towers burning, and of jihadists beheading civilians, you have to ask what's motivating these people? More disturbing are the huge crowds of people who cheer at such events while burning our flag and chanting, \\"Death to America\\". The fact that there are thousands upon thousands of such people demonstrates that these acts aren't from a few renegades who have hijacked a peaceful religion. Rather, it demonstrates the true nature of the religion itself. <br /> <br />This book prompted me to read a translation of the Koran. (A lengthy read, and very repetetive, but worth the effort.) This confirmed the facts cited in Robert Spencer's excellent book. <br /> <br />Don't believe that killing innocents is incumbent upon Muslims?

B000002JR8|3.0|Pantera's 7th album is perhaps the most aggressively personal offering of their entire career but unfortunately this has its upsides and downsides.    The album kicks off with Strength Beyond Strength, it immediately establishes the tone of the album offering nothing but a heavy groove and brutal drumming throughout. Unfortunately the groove does not sustain itself for very long and soon it begins to show that was a wonderful intro does not turn into a wonderful song. Dimebag's guitar-work and Vinnie Paul's drumming are its only saving grace. The lyrics are nonsensical and Anselmo seems to be trying far too hard to find any real rage in this subject.    Becoming is the album's second track and here things turn completely in the other direction. Anselmo draws from personal experiences and delivers a truly menacing diatribe on self-image/self-worth set to a fantastically catchy and creative groove. Next up is another brutal offering and another staple in Pantera's catalog: 5 Minutes Alone. Supposedly inspired by an encounter with a fan's enraged father, here Anselmo turns the tables and places himself in the role of said character. Once again painting a picture of finding one-self in a hostile environment it is easy to see why the song appeals to fans of the band. The riffs are absolutely brutal, with no apologies or breaks and Anselmo growl hits a high mark towards the end of the song as his bestial growling of the chorus echo and slowly fade away.    What follows is one of the more self-indulgent offerings in Pantera's catalog. Good Friends and a Bottle of Booze must have seemed like a good, short \\"song\\" to give listeners a break from the aggressive barrage that the album has been building up to this point. However, because of the lyrical content the song comes across as some sort of in-joke between Anselmo and whoever he is directing these words at, if anyone. Boasting is all to be found here and Vinnie Paul's catchy drumming is the track's only redeeming quality.Hard Lines, Sunken Cheeks provides the appropriate cease-fire in Pantera's aural assault. A slow (for Pantera), grinding intro is followed by a fast tempo and Anselmo quickly spewing forth on his decadent life. The chorus periodically slows things down and returns to the grind that served as the intro. A very melodic solo is a note-worthy highlight of this track as well. Slaughtered's machine gun riffs follow with somewhat forgettable lyrics and vocals but a tremendous groove throughout.     25 Years continues to provide some insight into Phil Anselmo's past by revealing his feelings towards a certain paternal figure in a very graphic way. The song itself is hardly worth including as an album track though. Overly simplistic and reminiscent of Good Friends and A Bottle of Booze, it feels like a badly written diatribe with a theme far too common to be of any interest if Anselmo weren't such an enigmatic figure. As it is the aforementioned is the only reason why this track is even slightly note-worthy.    Shedding Skin follows 25 Years in seemingly giving a glimpse into Anselmo's relationships. This time the lyrics apparently deal with friendships or romantic relationships and trust therein. A fantastic chorus is one of the highlights and the groove, slow and steady, eventually builds into a solo that gives way to pounding finale.    Use My Third Arm and Throes of Rejection close the album's original content with disappointing lyrics but powerful, if somewhat forgettable, melodies. The former touches on the anarchist mindset while the latter deals with the insecurities of dating. Both topics get a far too familiar and simplistic treatment with the lyrics sometimes bordering on throwaway lines. Musically the highlight of the two is Throes of Rejection, which sets off with pounding drums and menacing riffs, as if announcing an incoming showdown. Sadly what is delivered thereafter remains very catchy musically but poorly conceived lyrically.    The closer on the albumis a cover of Black Sabbath's Planet Caravan. As far as covers go it is a very faithfully adaptation of the original, perhaps a little too faithful for its own good. To their credit Pantera more than do justice to this classic but the song simply does not fit in with the rest of the mood the album has been building up to this point.    Far Beyond Driven shows its true colors from the very beginning by setting off on an aggressive binge that seldom lets up. At times Pantera seems to be trying far too hard to enhance the unfiltered rage that was captured in Vulgar Display of Power and this leads to some disappointing tracks. Nonetheless, amongst the failed attempts, lay some true gems from Pantera's catalogue that successfully manage to one-up vulgar Display of Power in its venomous bite.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Absolutely one of the best war films i've ever seen! Second only to \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" i'd say. I never tire of watching \\"Band of Brothers\\"!
B000002J1F|5.0|Like the title says, I'm writing this in repsonse to Cromulus \\"Magnus Cromulus\\" review. You say that no band containing Bill Bruford can make a masterpiece .. I don't have a problem with you saying that, but then you go on to say it sounds like he's on helium? What? Do you mean the singer, Jon Anderson? Bill Bruford is the drummer, i'm not sure he does much singing.  <br /> <br />Either way, this is a 5 star album. My Favorite Yes album.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Katrina and a series of Tsunamis close to Australian shores have been some of the most recent public confirmations of the environmental argument about the disasterous effects of CO2 emissions. From this side of the planet, that the Bush administration has blundered and bullied with fiendish, manipulative disregard over stricken people's and places(including its own), is plain-speak. It's not exclusive Bush behaviour, but it tightens screws on the worse features of a so-called democratic system. The Florida fiasco was a demonstation of its neglect to fulfil the faith in democratic processes and principles. Al Gore knows this better than anyone. Not that until this film had I much cared for Al. But he stands tall here, tall and articulate in a way that Bush couldn't conceive. His elucidatory lecture, and the heroic, poised stance he delivers to the electorate should be compulsory medicine in a sane republic. The lecture isn't patronising, and saved from excessive polish by Guggenheim's pulling back into Gore's personal struggle with a sick son, a dead sister, and a dying river in his back yard. Technically it's pace is sufficiently varied to hold the attention of this graph-phobic viewer. The news isn't good. It's sobering but not alarmist and hovers above the debate of our capacity for engendering sufficient political will. We are that will and must 'pray' with our feet. Guidelines are provided, chapter and verse, as the film's credits roll. Stay seated for the final curtain!
B00005ASIL|3.0|If you are not very well acquainted with British Folk-Prog music, but you just want to get a bunch of the most \\"Radio-ed\\" versions of Jethro Tull, this CD is for you. But if you want something extra, go to the double-CD \\"The Very Best\\" (import) by EMI International. It may be a bit expensive in relation to this one, but you'll find more of good Tull music that you expect.
B000GY729M|1.0|It's hard to even describe just how disappointed I am in this CD.  I honestly wish I could give it no stars.  There are tons of new CDs out this fall and this is the one that I had been anticipating the most. It's been the most disappointing of the lot.  The style of the CD is nothing like Hot Fuss, and I have no problem letting my favorite bands try new things so they can grow in different directions, but this is too different for me.  Entetainment Weekly gave it a C, so did Rolling Stone.  It's more reminiscent of Bruce Springsteen than the up-tempo, danceable hits I've come to expect from this band.  Maudlin is an understatement.
B000088DSQ|4.0|I was surprised by the universal acclaim on this recording. Whilst there are some moments of real joy and surprise, as a whole the set feels somewhat uneven. The first three concertos are the best of the set, four is OK but five is disappointing. At times liberties are taken with tempi and you find things grinding to a halt abruptly and the performance loses forward momentum as a result, at other times things feel a little too mechanical. <br /> <br />This is particularly apparent in the slow movement of number 5, one of my favourite piece of Beethoven. It is really difficult to tell whether it is intended or a by-product of recording but at times the piano is just too much to the fore and sounds like a mechanical music box. It is somewhat surprising by Aimard seems to be able to combine over use of rubato (the opening phrases in the piano just slow down too much) with overly spiky approaches to passages where the piano accompanies the orchestra. <br /> <br />I have to say though that the orchestra is wonderful throughout under Harnoncourt. <br /> <br />Word of advice - don't listen to this with headphones - you can hear the edits to remove audience noise and also hear someone (wither the conductor or soloist) audibly grunting with the effort in places - quite unnerving.

B000001DQI|5.0|Back in the 70s, composing and performing Rock music was a kind of \\"Modern Art\\". Elton John is one of those master musicians who made \\"Art\\" Rock. Music historians and critics may call it simply \\"another Glam Rock album\\", but \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\" is ONE OF THE BEST ROCK ALBUMS EVER MADE. Since the very beginning of \\"Funeral Of A Friend/Love Lies Bleeding\\", to \\"Harmony\\", this album is OUT OF THIS WORLD! Being originally issued in its LP version back in 1973, this masterwork of Elton John doesn't sound \\"old\\" at all! However, if you think Elton John made his best with hits like \\"Nikita\\", \\"Made In England\\", \\"Don't Wanna Go On With You Like That\\" or \\"I Want Love\\", you better think twice... Give a try to \\"Goodbye Yellow...\\", and you'll consider getting ASAP the whole edition of \\"ELTON JOHN... The Classic Years\\".
B000F7CMRM|5.0|it does tend to lurch, but I give it a yes anyway because it says not so well something it is still arch heresy even to suggest; the end is not near, it is very, very near.  and possibly, it has already come and gone.
B000IFS0HM|5.0|The youth of Frank McCourt is one that I would never wish upon any other human being.  Often starving or ill, his whole family is disjoint and falling apart whether in Brooklyn, New York or Limerick, Ireland.  His father's alcoholism and his younger siblings' mortality rate both enrage and soften the reader of this tremendous memoir.  He constantly captures these moments of his childhood wonderfully in his seven-year-old voice.  His description of his father's desire for his sons to die for Ireland is almost comically scary, <br />\\"He's pushing in our door and singing, And if, when all a vigil keep, The West's asleep, The West's asleep!  Alas! And well my Erin weep, That Connnacht lies in slumber deep, But hark! A voice like thunder spake `The West's awake!  The West's awake! Sing, Oh hurrah, let England quake, We'll watch till death for Erin's sake'\\" (111). <br /> <br />The way that McCourt captures the voice of his drunken, patriotic father is heartbreakingly wonderful.  Telling the whole story through his own eyes as he grows up himself adds a level to the storytelling that few other authors can mimic.  If you liked Mary Karr's The Liars' Club, you will love Angela's Ashes in the same way.  Both Karr and McCourt capture the voice of a child perfectly.  Another thing that McCourt does with scenes like this is to present to the reader the rich passion his father has for Ireland and set the scene of his childhood even better.  As Karr did with her father's loyalty to Texas, McCourt does with his father's obsession with his homeland.  Both of them use specific scenes with each parent to really deliver the story of their lives.  Angela's Ashes blew me away and I would recommend it to anyone. <br />
1594200823|5.0|I can't believe it happened to me. I never thought it would, my ego integrity being such that I thought I would never become so completely a different person. But it did happen. In the span of a few seconds I uttered words that were so alien, so not me it could have been stated by a complete stranger. I was not being ironic or funny. I didn't even realize what I said until I was finished saying it and then for a fleeting few moments I couldn't be sure it was really me thinking and saying this phrase, \\"For Gods sake, this is a health food store, why are they selling soda? And for that matter, what the hell is organic soda?\\" <br /> <br />As my wife pulled away from the end rack of said offending soda I suddenly had the most jolting moment of clarity in the middle of our local Nature's Harvest health food store. Despite every effort to the contrary, my wife's newfound allergy to wheat plus our collective endeavor to lose weight and eat better had turned me into one of those obnoxious foodie types that turn up their nose to anything found at your local supermarket. Folks, this is not me. A scant year ago three square meals consisted of a cereal bar (Cocoa Puffs or Cheerios) for breakfast, Tyson breaded chicken patties for lunch, and a plentiful serving of Taco Bell for dinner. <br /> <br />My indulgence of Taco Bell was legendary going all the back to high school. In fact, I lunched their so often that when I went away to college in Pittsburgh for a semester, it was rumored that the local Taco Bell I frequented went out of business because I was not their to support any longer. <br /> <br />So how does one go from such a complete junk food junkie to obnoxious health conscious foodie so darn quickly? The answer lies in \\"Botany of Desire\\" author and journalist for the New York Times Magazine Michael Pollan's newest masterpiece, \\"The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals.\\" In this book Pollan takes great pains to show his readers how the average American mealdevelops and evolves from the farm to our plate. Many books these days concentrate solely on fast food and how horrible it is for you but Pollan not only tackles that well worn material, he goes above and beyond in displaying the entire military-industrial food chain that supplies every mainstream food outlet from Wal-Mart to the local bodega, from any major Supermarket to most American eateries. <br /> <br />When I bought this book I figured I'd be taught many things about Mad Cow Disease, pesticides and growth hormones, concentration camp-like conditions for farm animals, and most probably Franken-foods (genetically modified or cloned). That's all in there but it is under the most odd of headings; corn. <br /> <br />According to Pollan corn is THE building block of the entire non-organic, non-foraged, food chain. That's right, I said corn. I realize that at first glance, aside from barbeques and vegetable medley's, one does not see corn so completely spread far and wide as Pollan insists it is. But that is what makes his book so incredible and such a pleasurable read. Pollan visits one of the biggest agribusiness farms in America and asks all of the right questions.  <br /> <br />What we find is not only the history of how corn dominated human society by domesticating us (rather than the assumed belief that we domesticated corn) we follow Pollan on the path of corn as it finds its way into nearly every available food on the market in stores and restaurants. From the object itself, to meals fed to animals we eat (like chicken and beef), to byproducts such as high fructose corn syrup (which I swear is in nearly everything but the air we breathe) to even the heart of food policy as written by our Congress and paid for with taxpayer dollars. By the end of this section that was entirely dedicated to corn and its nightmare offspring, the quite literally named military-industrial food chain, I found myself wandering the eateries and shopping centers of Tampa crying outthat everywhere lurked dreadful and unhealthy corn a la Charlton Heston of Soylent Green fame. Morgan Spurlock already had me yelling at every McDonalds that it was \\"Evil!\\" like I was a poor mans Abe \\"Grandpa\\" Simpson, so Pollans empire of corn revelation only made my food induced hysteria oh so much worse.  <br /> <br />Incidentally, between the aforementioned wife's allergy and subsequent discovery that even hot dogs and hamburgers had wheat in them combined with my reading of Pollan's book and his description of corn, our car rides are peppered with the both of us screaming out of the car windows at every opportunity in banshee song, \\"Wheat...corn...wheat...corn, everywhere is wheat and corn...oh woe is us, woe-is-us!\\" <br /> <br />But Pollan does do what most anti-agribusiness people do. He doesn't rest easy on the lazy thinking that we should all blindly start shopping at organic food stores like Whole Foods Market without asking equally intrusive and instructive questions. Pollan tackles the organic food industry with as much veracity and gusto as he did with the industrial food chain. In the section simply titled, grass, we learn more about the natural order of food ecology and just how far we've drifted from what is the natural order of eating and raising food. He also teaches the difference between organic, USDA approved organic and the even healthier but lofty local food chain. By the end of this chapter Pollan had me searching the aforementioned Nature's Harvest for foods and condiments that were produced in Tampa, FL (where I live) because now even organic wasn't good enough for me. About this time a good friend called me and when I told him of my dilemma he suggested I start working a second job to pay for my new food obsession or seek an intervention. <br /> <br />The last chapter, the forest, is about hunting and gathering ones own dinner. Pollan manages to write a beautiful and intelligent piece about the way we eat in modern times without the trappings of hoity, elitist language and attitude present in most writings about food and health. However, though in the end the chapter is saved by Pollans humbleness and genuine intellectual curiosity about the subject of hunting and gathering, boy does this final part of the book skate close to the edge of unrealistic. Thankfully, Pollan acknowledges that we are not about to as a society start to reverse evolution and drop agriculture in favor of returning to hunting and gathering. He only goes through with this experiment for the purposes of illustration not as a viable alternative to eating corn meals and faux organic products. His message is simply know what you are eating, make smart decisions and moderate your impulses. <br /> <br />\\"The Omnivore's Dilemma,\\" by Michael Pollan is a wonderful book. It has achieved the much-vaunted (if I do say so myself) position of one the few books I insist that everyone should read. Other books in this category include the Pulitzer Prize winning epic by Jared Diamond, \\"Guns, Germs and Steel.\\" For anyone with a serious interest in the modern food chain or simply eating healthier, you should definitely read, \\"The Omnivore's Dilemma,\\" by Michael Pollan. I promise it won't make you nearly as nuts as it made me, I'm just a bit overdramatic and obsessive is all.
B000H0MKOC|3.0|It would be difficult to live up to the hype I heard about this film, and in fact, the movie does not quite rise, in my opinion, to the estatic reviews I read several months ago when it was on the big screen in big cities. There are indeed some big laughs, and many smiles and smirks generated by the cynical story line: honorable man, good dad, makes a living shilling for a horrid product. Along the way he meets and beds a dishonorable reporter, confronts and bests sleazy talk show hosts and Congressmen, and tries to balance loving his son with a public promise to \\"buy him his first pack of cigarettes when he turns 18 if he wants them.\\" It was an interesting choice for the film's creators to try to humanize a tobacco lobbyist, and in my view, they succeeded at that. Despite despising the product he promotes, I had to root for Nick to prevail in his various trials. If there could exist such a compliment as \\"At least he is honestly dishonest\\" Nick would have earned it. Worth seeing for its twisted heroes and villains and smart writing, yet not quite the dark comic masterpiece it might have been. <br />
B000002AQQ|3.0|I loved Forrest Gump since the first time I saw it in a cinema, even when some people considered it as a \\"Soap Box-Opera\\" movie. And kept watching it over and over again, every time is on TV. So I got the soundtrack as soon as it was on the record stores, because the 32-Hit selection made it a \\"Classic\\" almost automatically.  However, in 2001 the same soundtrack is reissued as \\"34 American Classics On 2 CDs\\". This is, those crazy guys in Sony/Columbia Production Dept. decided to add two extra songs, Fleetwood Mac's \\"Go Your Own Way\\" and Jackson Browne's \\"Running On Empty\\". However, they never considered to add The Doors' \\"Love Her Madly\\", even when the song was included in the original movie audio track, as well as other wonderful songs... Why????  I agree with \\"fendercustomstrat\\": this soundtrack should have been issued as a 3 or 4-CD boxed compilation... The extra bucks for having all those beautiful songs together, would be worth the price!!!
B000G759LW|5.0|even if you calim not to be a fan, if you listen to it for the musical value you have to love this double CD, <br />for me I can get enough <br />Christina Rules, she is a real singer , and she just looks awesome.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|Despite the fact that \\"The Diary Of Alicia Keys\\", singer/songwriter/musician Alicia Keys' sophomore effort, has already achieved phenomenal success both commercially and critically, I'm reviewing this album (I've owned my own official copy since 2004) in hopes of converting non-believers into Alicia Keys fans and scoring myself some helpful votes.    This album is most definitely a flawless R&B/Soul record - whereas her debut album \\"Songs In A Minor\\" was a ballad-heavy debut that showcased Alicia's soulful, gritty, powerful vocals, her compelling songwriting abilities and her undeniably amazing display of musicianship, \\"The Diary Of Alicia Keys\\" continues to capitalise on those same qualities while throwing a few extra surprises into the mix. Produced by super-producer/satisfactory-rapper Timbaland, \\"Heartburn\\" finds Alicia Keys sexily professing her infatuation with another man over sweaty bursts of faint percussion and infectious electric guitar loops; slow jams \\"Slow Down\\" & \\"Dragon Days\\" finds Alicia Keys sounding sexy without being sl*tty, lacing soulful vocals with lusty lyrics, smooth production and sexy guitar riffs for extra intensity; she pulls off a beautiful rendition of \\"If I Was Your Woman\\"; and \\"So Simple\\", which uses a nifty vocal sample (or it could be singer Lellow, who is easily overshadowed by Alicia Keys' soulful vocals and overpowering presence...hell, maybe Alicia's voice was studio-altered/enhanced), explores the growing complexity of an increasingly troublesome relationship with incredible lyrics over a simple arrangement of piano and faint percussion.    However, it's when she sticks to what she does best that she churns out some of the best songs to grace her catalogue. Alicia Keys' always-spot-on vocals and killer lyrics, which talk about that inescapably overwhelming feeling of being absorbed in addictive love, effortlessly ride over Kanye West's stellar production and old-school grooves -piano keys, violins, etc.- on the flawless lead single \\"You Don't Know My Name\\" ; R&B singers Tony! Toni! Tone! lend their soulful vocals on \\"Diary\\", a piano-driven R&B/Soul classic ballad about being the person or \\"diary\\" someone else can confide in and be truthful with ; album closer \\"Nobody Not Really\\", with its laid-back horns and smooth vocals, is a melodic ode to universal loneliness and feelings of neglect from the rest of the world ; and the ballad \\"Karma\\", where dramatic violins and obligatory piano work accompany Alicia Keys' story about a man wanting her back after dumping her, speaks for itself.    \\"If I Ain't Got You\\" is definitely the best track on the album, and the reason I bought the CD in the first place. Alicia Keys' soulful vocals and expectedly excellent display of her piano skills ALWAYS make room for her powerful lyrics. However, this song has more substance than its \\"all-the-riches-in-the-world-are-nothing-without-you\\" theme/cliché might suggest. It tells us how we judge people by their physical features (\\"Some people think / That the physical things / Define what's within\\"), how our material obsessions are what makes us happy as opposed to what our actual lovers have to offer from themselves (\\"Sometimes you need 3 dozen roses / And that's the only way to prove you love them\\"), how we're all so focused on retaining our youth and outer beauty (\\"Some people search for a fountain / That promises forever young\\") and so much more. Hell, the grand statement of how people live for fame, fortune, power or just to play the game reeks of raw truth all by itself, as does the whole track.    If you're into raw, artistically accomplished R&B/Soul that speaks to the heart, soul, mind and life as a whole, you should have no problem enjoying this album. For those of you who despise albums loaded with balladry, you MIGHT be better off avoiding this album. Ultimately though, everyone should get a copy of this album & hear what real R&B/Soul should sound like. 5 stars!    5 Best Tracks:  \\"If I Ain't Got You\\"\\"You Don't Know My Name\\"  \\"Diary (feat. Tony! Toni! Tone!)  \\"Heartburn\\"  \\"Nobody Not Really\\"
B000FTWB7G|2.0|Upon receiving this CD in the mail I was anxiously awaiting to hear this long awaited sequel to \\"Fallen.\\"  The first two tracks were good!  \\"Call Me If You're Sober\\" is definitely one of the best from this band.  Unfortunately, the tracks after it are not so good.  \\"Fallen\\" had a very smooth flow to all of the tracks, yet each song had its own distinct sound.  Not true with this CD.  Tracks 3 through 13 sound all too much alike.  It is about an hour of the same guitar riffs and Amy Lee's screeching.  It wasn't long before I got a headache and had to take a break at track 10 or so.  This glass-shattering CD lacked the cool theme and distinctness of their original album.
B000062YAZ|5.0|Slayer have always been over the top, no denying it, though there's a lot more bands that are worse in the area of violence and offensive material. This is just as true to the sheer speed of the music and vocals. Honestly, there isn't much to say on the album itself that has not been said before. It's fast, wild, violent and possibly a little over-hyped and yet is still one of the best metal albums ever made. So here's just a few small things to say about this album:<br /><br />1.) The first song, \\"Angel of Death,\\" is considered one of Slayer's best songs ever. It's also one of the most controversial. The lyrics graphically depict the hideous, sadistic scientific experiments done by Nazis during the Holocaust. The controversy lies in the fact that people, who don't understand the background behind Slayer, think they're evil, Satanic and are promoting the very music they make. They claim to, however, not take either side, saying that they wrote a song about what happened in history because it happened. It doesn't endorse it, but it isn't exactly against it either.<br /><br />2.) In regards to the above, Slayer is also Aetheist, something most people tend to not realize. They are NOT Satanists who actually believe in the music they write. In fact, most of the music they write isn't even Satanic. They may describe Hell, death and war, but only one true Satanic song was on this album: \\"Altar of Sacrifice.\\" The song \\"Jesus Saves\\" isn't exactly about Satanism, but it is about the hypocricy within Christianity and \\"Raining Blood\\" could be anything, though it's lyrics do seem do describe a Satan-like figure rising to power.<br /><br />3.) This whole album is indeed an essential to any metalhead's collection, overhyped or not. This is especially true of you Master of Puppets fans out there. My friend, who'd never even heard of Slayer, came over and I played this for him. He only ever listened to Metallica and Megadeth and was shocked when he said that every song sounded like something off of Master, just with a bit of a darker feel.<br /><br />4.) To those who are wondering, yes, it often does sound the same and is so fast it may actually seem like it's just one 30 minute long song.<br /><br />Final Word: Despite all the possible overhype (you decide whether or not it is) this CD is excellent and an absolute must for any true metalhead. Keep headbanging and long live Slayer!<br /><br />** 5 Stars out of 5 **something off of Master, just with a bit of a darker feel.<br /><br />4.) To those who are wondering, yes, it often does sound the same and is so fast it may actually seem like it's just one 30 minute long song.<br /><br />Final Word: Despite all the possible overhype (you decide whether or not it is) this CD is excellent and an absolute must for any true metalhead. Keep headbanging and long live Slayer!<br /><br />** 5 Stars out of 5 **
B000002LAB|4.0|I have this on an album and contemplating getting the CD.  However, when this was released in 1986, radios were playing a funky remix of the last song, \\"Full Nelson\\".

B000003TAW|5.0|I bought this album about two years after it came out. I have heard all their other songs but this is my favorite Weezer album. This is one of the albums that I can listen from beginning to end and enjoy every song, and I know that's a rare happening for most people. If you're looking for a Weezer album to start with, this is the best.
0743454537|5.0|I enjoyed how the book challenged my ideas about life and treatments for serious illness without ever feeling pressured into one conclusion.

B00000G3AZ|5.0|I had watched this version of Emma while in my young teens and disliked the movie very much. I have carried that dislike with me until recently now in my 20's I was compelled to watch this version again (I own the Kate Beckinsale version and like it). To my astonishment I actually like this version better! I like Austen's movie adaptations but have never read her books (except Sense and Sensibility in high school, which I don't remember). Some may call it lazy or unimaginative, but I prefer movies, though I know there would never be adaptations without the books but there it is. I do not know exactly what it was about this version that I like better; maybe that it seemed brighter and the characters were more fitting to their parts and there was more time to get to know each character better since this version is longer. The dialogue was much easier to understand (more modern that truely period based, but still fitting) and I am NOT a Paltrow fan but she was perfect in this role as Emma. I do still like the Beckinsale version, but I am almost sorry that I own it rather than this one, but am too cheap to own both =-)....

The socialization process that we all must go through clouds our true reality, placing us in what Ruiz refers to as a \\"Minote\\" (fog).<br /><br />Cutting to the chase, there are four agreements:<br /><br />1. Be Impeccable With Your Word<br />2. Don't Take Anything Personally<br />3. Don't Make Assumptions<br />4. Always Do Your Best<br /><br />I broke all but one of those agreements (the last) without thinking so often in my life, that I thought that it might be impossible to live by these concepts.  I had had a habit of putting myself down, jokingly, in many situations, not realizing that it was self rejection, \\"...the biggest sin of all\\".  Being impeccable with your word also includes not participating in gossip, and disparagement of others, which Ruiz calls \\"black magic\\".<br /><br />It was also very difficult for me to not assume anything, since I begin each day starting out with the assumption that the sun will come up, for starters!  But I have seen time & again the damaging assumptions that can hurt us and others - those things that we assume to the point of believing them to be true.  I am working on this one, and am becoming more aware of making judgements in the absence of information.<br /><br />Not taking anything personally was the hardest one yet, though I have come a long way with that one, since reading the book.  That is the most freeing of the agreements.<br /><br />I think that the book is useful for everyone, as it makes us stop and think about those things that we all do automatically, which hurt us often withour our realizing it.  The book is a short read, yet has so much valuable information within.  I keep it around when I need reminders.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|There is no doubt that Maiden is great at what they do, and this  album is definitely proof  that they pulled out another winner.I just bought this Special Edition ( CD plus the DVD) together with the remake of the OMEN. Both Great buys. <br />Superb artwork on the Cover and in the Pack is a big first attraction.The music speaks for itself.Steve  Harris provides some great interview  insights, and the interviews with Bruce and the the rest of the team definitely add insight. The best thing for me is that Maiden provides what the fans want, and one great plus in the Documentary is the Band  doing a sort of \\"cover\\" of a ZZ TOP  song. <br />This is  very definitely a great album. But is also a consistently good Maiden album in the Maiden tradition. <br />ENJOY
B000I5Y8ZU|4.0|I must admit that there is a lot about bands like MCR that bothers me. Let's just say It's not something I'd let my kids listen to.<br /><br />That said, I think this is the best rock album since The Killers - Hot Fuss. In fact this is what The Killers newest album should have been but wasn't. The Black Parade utilizes the strong singing songwriting, along with their goth, emo, screamo sound to deliver an allbum that is original (in its concept), and extremely easy to listen to.<br /><br />Die-hard fans of the band will hate to hear kudos from someone like me (middle-aged Dad). So be it. MCR is about to 'ship it out a whole new door'. They'll sell more of this album than any previous.<br /><br />This album is entertaining in the way that Tim Burton, Edgar Allen Poe, and Richard Wagner are entertaining. It's dark, moody, morose and very dramatic. While I'd keep my emotional 13 year old (if I had one) at a distance from this music, I think this could be the best new album of the year.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|What can I say, MCR have once again made a great album.  When I heard that The Black Parade was meant to be better than Revenge I was wary of buying it as I feel that Bullets is the best.  But they have made a truly fantasic album.  The Black Parade is better than the other two, and it shows that the band is maturing and that they are willing to experiment with their sound. This CD has a wonderful sound and all the tracks are wonderful, esp Mama and Teenagers.  I would recommend this album for anyone who wants to hear great music, even if they have not heard MCR before.
0062502182|3.0|This short parable is written simply and clearly and is easy to understand. It possibly could inspire you to live a fulfilling and wonderful life (hurrah!). <br /> <br />It's a good storyline, involving some pretty spectacular adventures involving a young shepherd. He meets a number of characters on his journey, each with their own fault, which the reader is encouraged to identify with. There's a clear message that the author wants to get across here, which he definitely does. It might make you re-evaluate your life. <br /> <br />I can see that at certain points in my life, this book could have hit the mark. The author pushes a certain philosophy which many may find inspiring. <br /> <br />Unfortunately for me, it didn't quite get there. At times it's a bit sappy and \\"perfect\\". But I guess that's the idea. Simple message, simple story.  <br /> <br />So it is a nice story, easy to read, possibly inspiring. If you're in need of spiritual guidance, perhaps this book is the ticket.
B00005JPB4|5.0|On February 23, 1945, not long before World War II came to an end, a photograph was taken in the midst of a battle, one that captured five United States Marines and one U.S. Navy corpsman raising the American flag atop Mount Suribachi on the Japanese island of Iwo Jima. It became one of the most famous photographs in American history, and for that mid-twentieth century generation, it instilled hope and pride. This photograph is the center of Clint Eastwood's \\"Flags of Our Fathers,\\" a truly remarkable film that addresses heroism, celebrity, and the inhumanity of war. It also addresses the public's misconceptions about the famous photo; it captured a second flag raising ceremony, one that was held in order to prevent Secretary of the Navy, James Forrestal, from keeping the first flag as a souvenir.     I honestly can't say whether or not this film makes a political statement. On the one hand, it asks us to be respectful to those who fought for their country. That's certainly fair. But on the other hand, it portrays the war realistically, mixing horrific images and raw emotions into something that doesn't allow for swellings of pride. This was a wise move on Eastwood's part, considering many of the soldiers who had minimal roles in the war were permanently labeled as heroes. This is exactly what happened to John \\"Doc\\" Bradley, Ira Hayes, and Rene Gagnon (portrayed in the film by Ryan Phillippe, Adam Beach, and Jesse Bradford) three of the six soldiers who took part in the flag raising ceremony. After the Battle of Iwo Jima, the three men returned to America amidst national praise, which very quickly led to a turbulent ride on a political and economic roller coaster.    Being thrust into the spotlight couldn't have been fun, and understandably, the men go through a gamut of emotions. Phillippe, Beach, and Bradford put everything they had into their characters, each with a depth and complexity that's rarely seen in movies anymore. This is important for the audience's sake; keep in mind that the soldiers experienced terrible things, things that no one should ever have to experience. We're made very aware of this during some intense battle scenes, none of which portray war gloriously. Even when Japanese soldiers are shot dead, victory is not felt; there's genuine humanity coursing through the film's veins, and that made watching these scenes effectively uncomfortable. When surrounded by bullets, fire, and shrapnel, one can't get a sense of Hero vs. Enemy, especially when graphic shots of detached limbs, gaping wounds, and bloody corpses are factored in (even a severed head finds its way into the film).    Eastwood clearly knew what he was doing here; by showing the reality of war, respect can be strengthened. However, it can also be destroyed, especially if the true level of brutality were brought to light. Bradley, Hayes, and Gagnon understand that the American public is shielded from this sense of reality; they see the three soldiers as nothing but fearless, flawless, all-American heroes. They're quickly branded as the Heroes of Iwo Jima, after which they're forced to participate in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Seventh War Bond Drive. They tour the country promoting the benefits of buying war bonds, doing their part by making speeches and performing in unnecessary reenactments (one of which was during a football game). \\"The real heroes,\\" Gagnon tries to emphasize during one such promotion, \\"are dead on that island.\\" It falls on deaf ears; their victory has sparked an unprecedented commercial frenzy, with the famous photograph being used for posters, stamps, and flyers.    But the truth is less commercially acceptable; the soldiers were just as much in the heat of battle as the Japanese were, meaning they did some things that no respectable soldier should ever do. \\"I can't take being called a hero,\\" sobs Hayes, remembering that many of the men he admired didn't make it home (some of which appeared in the second photograph). Hayes has anincredibly difficult time adjusting to his fame, and he frequently drowns his sorrows in alcohol. He usually appeared at public events in a drunken stupor, just barely able to manage a facade of sobriety. What's worse is that he's a full-blooded Native American, meaning he was often subject to demeaning remarks, from both his peers and his government. It was both enlightening and depressing to watch this character, especially with such heavy emotional baggage. Consider the moment when he meets the mother of one of the dead soldiers; the two introduce themselves by latching onto each other and crying uncontrollably.    Interwoven throughout the film are present day sequences, in which Bradley's son, James (Tom McCarthy), interviews some of the surviving veterans in order to write a book. I wasn't too sure about this at first; I was initially led to believe that their inclusion was only an excuse to include the musings of flat, uninspired Wise Old Men caricatures. But the more they spoke, the more I came to realize that they were incredibly significant; their personal experiences enabled them to convey the complexities of war perfectly. By the end of \\"Flags of Our Fathers,\\" it becomes clear that there's no dying in a blaze of glory when it comes to war. It also becomes clear that a picture--specifically \\"Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima\\"--isn't necessarily worth a thousand words.
1563890119|5.0|I,ve long been told that this series is the best set of comics to date, but I only rcently (as in 4 days ago) got this one. I must say that it's fenominal to say the least. The story takes a few to get going which might turn off some, and the art has alot in common with that of yor(although once you get used to it it compliments the story well. After you get past that it's a thrill ride to the end. <br />             ++SPOILERS++ <br />   The story is about one of the seven Endless, Dream (he has many names really), whose captured by mistake instead of Death. He's imprisoned for about 100 years, but thanks to mistake on his captures' part he's set free. Afterward he sets out to return to himself what is his, and fix some of what went wrong while he was captured. <br />   I suggest this to any fans of the following: horror,fantasy, great stories, or comics. WARNING: This graphic novel does contain prophanity,  gore, and brief nudity.  <br />
6305971099|4.0|Halloween 5, like most of the sequels after Halloween 4, is greatly bashed, and doesn't deserve as much bashing as it gets, as with most of the sequels after Halloween 4 (although Halloween: Ressurection pretty much sucked). Halloween 5 further digs into the story of Michael Myers; in this sequel, it's proven that he is out to kill the rest of his female relatives, and the \\"rage\\" inside of him is driven by Jamie, the last survivor of the Myers blood, so she is obviously the target (that definately sounds disturbing, wanting to kill your niece, but hey, we all need hobbies, right?). After Michael is supposedly dead, we see that he managed to escape from the police and managed to crawl out of the manhole just before the bomb went off. So then we find Jamie in a hospital for kids, after killing her foster mother by (from what I understand) part of Michael's rage getting inside of her. Now, she can barely talk (until the end), but is now spiritually connected to Michael, and can pinpoint his exact movements and locations. Dr. Loomis depends on her to find Michael, in hopes of finally killing him or at least stopping the rage inside of him. Michael is put to sleep from some tranquilizer and put in jail, where he'll be transferred to a maximum security facility. But in the end, as Jamie walks through the jail, we see that it's trashed and he's escaped (!).<br /><br />It's weak points are pretty obvious: Some of the scenes are just flat out ridiculous, like when the friend of Jamie's foster sister Rachel, Tina goes into her house she shares with Rachel and acts out the infamous stereotypical teenage girl who's completely oblivious of the real world and doesn't even suspect that someone is in the house that shouldn't be there, and has a friend that is equally brain-dead as her. And at the party they go to, there's some guy in a costume that's hitting on Tina; we find out later that he has NOTHING to do with the plot. And while Tina is in the barn looking for the kitten she finds, can't she see the silhouette of Michael who is standing right in front of her? WTF? And finally, when Michael is in the jail cell, why don't they take off his mask? Don't they want to find out who he is? And come on, after seeing what he can do, you'd think they would immediately put him into a maximum security facility, not wait for a few days will he's put into a simplistic jail cell!<br /><br />Despite these problems, I can forgive H5 because it reveals more of the story of Michael and is nonetheless well thought out. H5 will never be up there with other slasher classics (such as the fist Halloween), but it's still a strong sequel, and while not the best of the series, it's definately worth more than 3.5 stars.<br /><br />P.S. On a completely unrelated topic, keep watching the Monster Fest on AMC October 22nd-31st!can't she see the silhouette of Michael who is standing right in front of her? WTF?

0385336691|3.0|I started out really liking the book.  Good story, draws you in early, that kind of thing.  Then I noticed Lee Child's extreme overuse of the words 'therefore' and 'maybe' and the phrase 'back in the day'.  This was enormously distracting.  Shortly after I noticed that, I solved the mystery.  So, my final analysis is 3 stars:  good premise, a little plot twist (not much, but a little), average writing.  2 stars off for awful phrase repetition and average story layout. <br /> <br />
0446525537|5.0|A Walk to Remember.<br /><br />To those that know Sparks's writing, may just be able to read the title and know that crying will be involved.<br /><br />This was the first book I read by Sparks. Afterwards, I am eager to read more.<br /><br />A Walk to Remember is told as a narrative through the main character, Landon.<br /><br />It's compelling to see how Landon's heart is changed due to the presence and good will of Jamie Sullivan. Jamie is a senior that no one understands. She is always carrying her Bible and is always speaking of the Lord's plan. Landon is sure that he will never fall for a girl like her.<br /><br />The book takes your emotions on a rollercoaster with loops and turns.<br /><br />It will having you laughing out loud and crying in bed, nothing can prevent that.<br /><br />It really is a story of hope and love. A story that tries to tell you what love can do and what it may overcome.<br /><br />Even though you may guess the ending or figure it out before you read it, it still hits you harder than ever when you read the words.<br /><br />Beautifully written, wonderful plot.<br /><br />I loved this story.
B00003CXA2|5.0|I can't believe anyone would give this wonderful movie less than 5 stars.  I don't know what the deal is with the sudden burst of negative reviews, but this is certainly NOT a bad movie.  I was in 7th grade when it came out and I remember how popular it was back then.  Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE loved it.  No one said they didn't like it.  Even my dad to this day says he wouldn't mind watching the movie a few more times, and he NEVER wants to watch a movie more than two times.   <br /> <br />The actors, the direction, the story EVERYTHING about this movie worked.  It's a movie that will remain a classic forever.  There's something here for everyone.
1573225517|4.0|A great piece of pop literature.  Hornby paints a character that you can't help but try to sympathize with, no matter how much he seems to screw up in the world of modern romance.
B0000640VO|5.0|Truly delightful. Several reviewers called it off-beat.  Well, it is in North America. We laughed out loud quite a few times (the scene in the toilet comes to mind) and for the rest of the time we had happy grins on our faces.  It is SOO different from hollywood fare.  Visually and conceptually excellent!<br /><br />If you like to see a masterpiece of european cinema, and something different, you will enjoy Amelie's antics and a bit of magic here and there.  The action is fast-paced and you will find moving toward the edge of the seat wanting to know \\"what next.\\"<br /><br />If, however, you can only accept Hollywood-style flicks, you might be not entirely happy watching this picture - it lacks hollywood cliches, you won't recognize the actors (they are French...), and unless you speak French, your eyes will be bit confused trying to switch quickly between subtitles and beautiful images above.<br /><br />We will keep this movie in our collection, it's well worth it.
0062502182|3.0|A sign of the times, Coehlo's The Alchemist is not as good as advertised, but not as bad as it's vilified (by  a minority of detractors). A simple morality tale of a young shepherd seeking ultimate self-fulfillment, Coehlo is often caught ripping off or channeling Ayn Rand (without that enigmatic lady's bravura). <br /> <br />The Alchemist, as preceding and following reviews point out, is the tale of a young Andalusian shepherd who is on the verge of slacking in pursuit of a vague goal. It is here that a chance encounter with a mysterious wanderer spurs him on to his quest for the treasure awaiting him at the Great Pyramids. On his journey, he begins a process of self-discovery through several adventures and epiphanies in North Africa, all wrapped in inspirational metaphors. Steeped in myth and universal themes, the story is also low on character, depth, or humor. <br /> <br />Though ultimately an enjoyable read (I'd be lying if I said it will leave most readers unsatisfied--the Forrest Gump comparison below is most apt), what keeps The Alchemist grasping for literary accolades from its plateau of populist approval is the feeling we have throughout that we are being conned by a calculating raconteur. It is not for me to say if Coehlo is a good writer based on this work, but he is undoubtably a shrewd author. Still, I leave this crowd-pleaser with a marginal recommendation--especially for those who enjoy the fairy tales of old, or are sick of dry self-help books.
B000HLDFKE|3.0|I only watched this because it was on HD DVD, but I'm glad I did.  Time travel is always tricky in movies and if this was sci-fi, I would have picked it apart.  But time travel and romance fit together nicely.  This reminded me of another of my favorite movies \\"Somewhere in Time\\" staring Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour.  Keanu and Sandra worked well together-felt like a Speed reunion.  Picture quality was very good, especially for a small combo disc. Overall quite enjoyable and worth at least a rent.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|In typical Sarah style, this cd is a moving Christmas journey. Her voice is the most beautiful instrument. She never disappoints, except when the cd is over, leaving you yearning for more. Hard to pick a favorite, but I'd have to say it would be The First Noel/Mary Mary, astounding. This is the cd I'll be trimming my tree to!  <br />
0553804677|4.0|The Lies of Locke Lamora was genuinely fun to read. The author created a fast-moving plot, memorable and amusing characters, and a criminal underworld that appears like it really could exist.  <br /> <br />The dialogue and prose, in particular, need to be singled out for their quality. It was alway amusing to hear any of the main characters speak, particularly on something they were angry about. In addition to that, the prose was nice and clear, with the quality of George R.R. Martin's work. <br /> <br />The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is because of the ending. It's not a bad ending, but it seemed just slightly contrived for a character like Locke to do the act he did.  <br /> <br />Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone, fantasy fan or not. It's a quality piece of work.
B0006FO8RA|5.0|Britney Spears has a talent for keeping global media focused on her nonstop, even if for the past two years she's been on hiatus.  Though many people think she's an overrated performer due to her mediocre singing abilities one thing is for sure: the buxom blonde has had some great material.  For the most part Greatest Hits: My Prerogative is a little premature since Spears has only had four studio albums to date--but her cultural impact as an international phenomenon has been so powerful it's hard to imagine the entertainment industry sans the sexy performer.  From her Grammy-nominated bubblegum beginnings like \\"...Baby One More Time\\" and \\"Oops!...I Did It Again\\" to the musically daring hits \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\" and Grammy-winning \\"Toxic,\\" Britney has had some stellar singles throughout her singing career.  Call her what you want now, but if there ever was a Spears record to own that encompasses the majority of her hit singles then Greatest Hits is the one.  Definitely a must purchase for any pop music fan.
0345457684|5.0|As A. Ross's excellent spotlight review noted, this is a blend of science fiction and the crime novel. I think it's the best example of that I've read, in fact, since Alfred Bester's novel, The Demolished Man, won the Hugo Award in the mid-50s, or perhaps the great short story, \\"Fondly Fahrenheit,\\" also by Bester, whose fiction was ahead of its time. The writing is top-notch and the story is a real page burner. Overall one of the best science fiction novels of recent years, and well worth your time and money.
0446605409|5.0|This is the Fourth Novel I read from Nelson DeMille, First being night fall and second being Lions Game and third being The General's Daughter and now plum island. I am already a fan of Jon Corey and his sense of humor.  <br /> <br />Plum Island is about a scientist couple, working on Plum Island, who were killed and John Corey is hired by local police as Private Detective. Nelson is best at taking twisting turns and you do not like to keep this book down at all.  <br /> <br />Although this novel is piece of fiction, but I appreciate the research Nelson has done to make this fiction amamzing is excellent.  <br />
0451457994|5.0|This novel and movie, based on Clarke's 1948 story, \\"The Sentinel,\\" became an instant cult classic. It's not hard to see why--the movie is spacy, the special effects (especially the space warp sequence) are spacy, the space warp music by Giorgi Ligeti is spacy, and the LSD trippers and recreational chemical enthusiasts who came to watch it were definitely spacy. Clarke's story about a first alien contact carries some warnings about the dangers of technology (HAL, the ship's bored and apparently depressed computer, goes bugf_ck), and humans are about to achieve universal immolation with nuclear weapons, which the transformed Commander Bowman/Starchild comes back to prevent. Although it drags in a few spots at the beginning while the plot gets going, overall it's still a great movie and on repeated viewings still has the ability to capture and maintain one's interest. It's a great Clarke story and also one of Kubrick's best efforts.<br /><br />By the way, a little plug for my other favorite Clarke novel, Childhood's End, a story about another first contact. In this captivating and poignant novel, the human race comes to a bittersweet ending by evolving into a strange, communal intelligence, thereby leaving the limitations of individual, corporeal minds behind. The Overlords, whose minds are perhaps a hundred times more powerful than a human's, are memorable characters. (Even their names are memorable, such as Thanthaltersco and Rashaverak, if my aging memory remembers correctly :-)). This novel, fairly short by today's standards (only about 250 pages) would be my pick for the top sci-fi novel of all time. If you only read science fiction novel, this should be it.<br /><br />Sadly, Keir Dullea's career went into a 10 or 15 year tailspin after achieving international fame in this flick, but he started to find work again in the 80s, according to a newspaper article I read about him then. Wonder what happened to him since, or to Gary Lockwood, who played his co-star?
B000FGFSPG|5.0|Never before have I heard such beautiful music.  Never before have I seen a better DVD production than this.  Folks, this is the real stuff! <br /> <br />If you love Nightwish as much as I do, this is worth every penny of the investment.  I watch this concert one or two times per week still.  I guess I'm addicted.   <br /> <br />Knowing that Tarja is gone sadens my heart, but I'll have this to remember the chemistry forever.
0307237699|4.0|I recommend \\"The Audacity of Hope\\", not because of what Senator Obama is, but for the promise of what he could be.  To say the book is eloquently done would be an understatement ... to say it reflects totally this man's heart, soul, and mind ... would be an overstatement.<br /><br />As a registered Republican, caressed by the sun, I begrudgingly purchased my copy of The Audacity of Hope ... thinking I would suffer revulsion from another starry-eyed ideologue.  To my surprise and delight; I was entertained, energized, and enlightened ... by this exquisite read.<br /><br />Let me say to those standing behind the curtains of demagoguery and political ideology:  \\"It will be to your advantage to keep an open mind, for  there is much to discover about this charismatic politician\\".<br />\<br />There are some grey areas in his views which have not been tested in the politics of reality. Consequently, it might be audacious of me to surmise he is a unique politician ... not afraid to speak his mind and stand his ground for principles in which he believes.  However, after reading this inspiring and marvelous book ... it is my wish, it is my dream ... it is my hope.<br /><br />Reggie Johnson, Success-Tapes.Com
B000BVD460|5.0|well here's his hits! Eminem topped the charts for so long! but most of the songs he released weren't even the best songs he's rapped to. for me, the highlight songs were: Soldier, Til' I Collapse & My Dad's Gone Crazy all from the Eminem Show! all these hits are catchy, some won't like them cause they do sound similar but that's fine. everyone has their own tastes, I never really liked rap until I heard The Real Slim Shady & then Lose Yourself. Eminem is the one that got me into rap so I thank him! <br /> <br />Fack is immature, funny, one of his only songs from his first album! <br /> <br />The Way I Am is probably his most depressing songs/videos and is actually one of the catchiest songs he's ever done! <br /> <br />My Name Is is the only other song from his first album. It's the song that pretty much everyone got to love and that's how he got to be where he is today! it's his first big hit that I can remember at least. <br /> <br />Stan is pretty much one of my favorite tracks because it has an interesting story & is well thought out! <br /> <br />Lose Yourself is by far the best hit he's come out with! It's a great rap song and it's so catchy! <br /> <br />Shake That is a chance to be silly and get up & dance!  <br /> <br />Sing for the Moment is obviously an Aerosmith song. but Eminem puts a nice, serious twist to it and is surprisingly an extremely well done song! <br /> <br />Without Me provides us with similar styles to Just Lose It & The Real Slim Shady but all the 3 songs are fun to listen to! <br /> <br />Like Toy Soldiers is probably the best song off of the Encore cd! It's deep, meaningful & is sad to listen to. <br /> <br />Mockingbird is yet another message out to his daughter. but I don't mind it so much cause not only the song catchy but it shows how much he cares for his daughters! <br /> <br />Guilty Conscience, haha, Eminem gets to be the bad guy as he literally convinces people to crimes while Dr. Dre tries to talk them out of it. still, it'san interesting twist for song! <br /> <br />Cleaning Out My Closet reaches out to both his parents who weren't really there for him. Eminem has the right to say everything he does say here and I can understand where he's coming from! but anyways, the song is serious and a good song to catch! <br /> <br />When I'm Gone is his encore song and probably one of the most intense songs beside The Way I Am! It's got alot going for it and it's a great song for an encore! <br /> <br />Stan(live) feat Elton John is basically the same thing as the original except with no swearing and obvious a different singer for the chorus. but I'm not sure it's really worth it to listen to. <br /> <br />Also on the bonus cd there are 7 extra songs like: Criminal, Kill You & Just Don't Give A F*ck! so yah, it's worth your money to get Curtain Call with the bonus cd! the other songs are catchy & worth your money! <br /> <br />As a whole, the cd was well organized & he picked the right songs for the cd! Eminem was one of the best rappers of our time! You should definitely check this out!
1401907725|5.0|This deck has lovely artwork and the 'plain' side of the cards is as beautiful as the artwork side.  Each card has quite a detailed description of its meaning at the bottom, to assist you in your readings. However, it would be wise to read the booklet until you become more familiar with the cards, as there are many interpretations to be gleaned from the booklet, which aren't at the bottom of the card.  As is always the case with oracle cards, you will need to determine which meaning is relevant to you at the time.   <br /> <br />For fellow Aussies out there, there are some native Australian animals included too (koalas, kangaroos) which is a refreshing change and was a pleasant surprise when I initially went through each card in the deck. <br /> <br />If you like Doreen's other oracle decks (and there are quite a few to choose from now) you'll enjoy this one too. <br /> <br />
0783226845|5.0|This movie is outstanding, very touching. It make you think about simple things in life, and Al Pacino performance was just awesome. I reccomend this \\"great\\" movie to people with real heart, if you're simple minded and except just lots of action go watch Triple X.
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|The most fun I've had in a theater in years. The dialogue is fast and clever. The premise is wild. The acting is slick. The art direction is near-perfect and haunting. <br /> <br />Has to be seen to be believed. Highly recommended.
B000GYI32M|4.0|Can you keep a secret? I love the OC. I'm a 28 year old man who has been infatuated with the stupid plots, inane dialog, and ridiculous characters this show has to offer. This season is absolutely NOT a let down. The only problem I can think of is that there isn't enough Seth Cohen. Aside from that, the show delivers exactly what it promises. While I will admit that this is no season 1, I would say that its actually better than season 2. The other reviewers may have been expecting some ground-breaking, innovative television experience, but that is insane. This is the freaking OC people! The show isn't \\"Masterpiece Theater\\" it's about rich kids and a flock of ever-changing ancillary characters finding themselves in impossible situations week after week. If you are thinking about this purchase, then you've seen the previous seasons and know what to expect. I am here to reassure you that its OK to pull the trigger on this one; you won't regret it. Oh, and be carefull, some of the other reviews give away the ending which is a total A-hole move.
B000HIVO64|5.0|When I hit play on a new Beck CD its like the Christmas present you can't guess. Whats it going to be? Pop disco? New Wave Hip Hop? Fresh Funk? Solemn ballads? Its always different (but always great) - thats what I love - not like one of those predictable pop CD's artists churn out like clones- but new and fresh. That's why I was kind of disappointed a bit with Guero (which was great compared to the music landscape overall, but just OK for Beck). Guero made me feel like the present that you say - 'Oh, I've got one of these already'. 'Information' is new and different. 'Information' pulls in new directions and is one of his best pieces yet. The first time you listen to it some of the sounds sound random and uncoordinated, but as you 'listen, lather, repeat' you realize the sounds are like a mathematical algorithm - precise and calculated. Even 'Think I'm in love' which would be so campy I could gag if it were to come from someone else comes off great at the hands of the master.  <br /> <br />So Mr Hansen: I love it. Please don't make another.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|Continuum is perfect, not one song I don't like. I can't pick a favorite since they are all so good! Slow Dancing, Belief, Gonna Find Another You, Don't Trust Myself some of my favorites. Bold as Love - amazing cover John does Jimi so well!  <br /> Buy it, you'll love it!!
0679422714|4.0|These concerns about this historical account of Mao being biased are naive and foolish.  ALL accounts of past and present events and people are biased because that is the nature of how the controlling / ruling elite record what other members of the elite have done or are currently doing.  Very little of the truth can be widely distributed, otherwise the elite would be ousted before dawn.  This reminds me of a quote by Bush Sr. in 1992 where he says that if Americans ever knew what the Bush family had done over the years to America that they would be chased down in the streets and lynched.  Exactly.      Thus, most outlets for information (especially book publishing, and especially books used to teach history) are censored with a fine tooth comb.  In point of fact, historical accounts that are closer to the truth will always come across as bizarre, horrific, and unbelievable to all of us who have been conditioned by our \\"education\\".  For example, any book on Hitler and the Nazis that does not delve into the blatant satanism, occultism, \\"bull\\" homosexuality and fascination with the ancients (ie. Egypt, Atlantis, and others) is way off course, especially in trying to piece together what happened and why.  Of course, this constant throwing us off course is intentional and very well thought out.  Also, people like Hitler, Stalin, Mao and others are not \\"self-made\\", or randomly evil, or \\"in the right place at the right time\\" like this book claims, rather they are bred, groomed, trained, and then placed into positions of power in order to achieve specific agendas (sometimes unknown to even them).  Hard to believe, you say?  There is one place that all of the above mentioned mass murderers can be tied to:  The Tavistock Institute of London.  Research this yourselves.  These monsters are created, and although they may be born of flesh and blood in small towns in China, Austria, Russia, Texas, Arkansas, etc., they quickly become nothing like the rest of us and do not considerthemselves patriots of any nation.  Passports, flag waving or anthem singing means nothing to the Elite, as they are globalist minded. So, killing us is enjoyable to them, raping and causing us misery is sport to them, and lying about it in the history books is hardly an after-thought. Just another day at the office, really, and the challenge for us mere mortals is NOT to try and understand their actions and motivations from our ethical points of view. They simply don't have ethics, morality, or empathy - it has been bred or \\"trained\\" out of them, which is why they are so useful to their \\"controllers\\".      Therefore, does this book go over-board with brutal details?  I would think not at all and I am sure there are many stomach retching accounts of depravity that were not told.  I have read other accounts of breeding children specifically to sacrifice and then eat (yes, I am refering to cannibalism).  Sometimes, children were / are eaten alive after having been sexually violated and skinned so their terror is at an absolute peak; it has something to do with massive and concentrated levels of adrenaline in the blood and tissues which provides the \\"perp\\" with a powerful high - akin to mythological vampirism actually. This was in Mao's regime and MANY others historically. What is really going on here?! Just coincidence? Should we re-think the so-called myth of vampires? Who \\"Count Dracula\\" really was (Vlad the Impaler) ties into this story quite well, and there are some fascinating parallels with Mao. Strange but true.       Regardless, my major critique of this work is not recognizing Mao as a well made product by the hidden hands that control this planet.  He was no random peasant who cut his own swath through the masses and then appeared on the World stage at just the right time.  Human history does not unfold that way, regardless of what you may have read.
B0000028M7|5.0|This cd along with all the other Alice In Chains releases are top notch. Lane was a tremendous singer who left an impression with the angst of his existence in his delivery. It's to bad he couldn't fight off the demons that eventually took his life. All in all this band was excellent.<br /><br />They and Soundgarden are the only two grunge bands worth mentioning from that time period with maybe Nirvana tossed in the mix as well. However Nirvana although a very good band in it's own right, couldn't touch Alice In Chain or Soundgarden in my honest opinion.<br /><br />Alice In Chains was and always will be a great band period!!<br /><br />Buy it!

B000002UJQ|4.0|more mature than pablo, more melodic than the bends, this album is awesome.  the songs flow one after another as one experimental masterpiece, as though this album was entirely for the guys enjoyment, not the mainstream listener.  absolutely perfect for a quiet night in, it is easy to lose oneself in the album.  not a great car record and no real hits to be found, but the album is excellent nonetheless. an amazing groove from one of the best groups out there.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|Ok wow. This film is messed up. It totally left me speechless. Oh Dae-su, a Korean family man is forcefully imprisoned for 15 years with no explanation. Upon his release he sets out to revenge his captors and understand why it all happened. What ensues is a hardcore psychological thriller with plot twists, cool fight scenes, a superb narrative style, and sweet cinematography. This film went gangbusters on the festival circuit pulling down some prestigious awards, but don't let that fool you into thinking it's mainstream. Bring this film to any conservative mother and you will see one of two things: a forceful backlash or a permanent nervous twitch from trauma. The film is stunning, but I recommend it only to people with their mind wide open.
0792164903|5.0|tim burton and johnny depp create magic again with this deliciously creepy deptiction of the classic ichabod crane and the legend of sleepy hollow tale.  johnny depp plays (gasp!) an oddball character with strange manerisms, odd obsessions, and weird reactions throughout the film.  he's at his best when reacting to the grotesque mutilations of bodies and to the horsemen himself, bumbling through his investigations and putting on a false bravado for the sake of the lucious christina ricci, gorgeous with her curves and seeping decollatage, her paleness and blonde hair only adding to her sensous character.  chris walken as the horsemen is creepy and grotesque, and you love him for it.  the twists and turns added for a \\"real\\" feeling of mystery only add to the enjoyment of this film.  well told, brilliantly directed, and wonderfully acted, this movie is fantastically gorey and fun.
B000GIXEIG|4.0|Taking from the Anglo-Saxon epic Beowulf, Icelandic director Sturla Gunnarsson pulls the broad poem down into a successful two-hour film filled with heroes, warriors, monsters and love (everything you need in an epic, right?).<br /><br />The Norse hero Beowulf (Gerard Butler, THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, 2004) is called upon to aid King Hrothgar (Stellan Skarsgard, PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: DEAD MAN'S CHEST), Lord of the Danes, in his bloody battle against a massive troll named Grendel (Ingvar Eggert Sigurosson, K-19: THE WIDOWMAKER). But once within King Hrothgar's realm, Beowulf discovers much more than just a deadly troll.<br /><br />Grendel kills only the strong men, and is selective even then, for his wrath is one of vengeance. King Hrothgar and his kin killed Grendel's father years ago, and now the troll is bent on revenge. Beowulf is initially unaware of Grendel's grudge, but our \\"hero\\" warrior soon learns of it via the beautiful but dangerous witch, Selma (Sarah Polley, DON'T COME KNOCKING).<br /><br />That Beowulf is battling a hero status he doesn't feel deserving of is also observed throughout the film. The additional battles of the many gods now in danger of falling to \\"the one God\\" (Christianity) is also touched on, for King Hrothgar and his clan feel that the many gods have abandoned them and perhaps this new God will help protect them.<br /><br />That Grendel is not just a monster but a flesh and blood being is quickly sensed as we watch his father killed for no particular reason, and experience the anguish of his isolation from the world (he plays a type of bowling game with skulls for entertainment). Even his need to procreate is vividly portrayed as he pays a nighttime visit to Selma's home.<br /><br />So when the end comes for Grendel, it is surprising, touching, bloody, and brutal. That Beowulf is forced to use his deadly warrior skills only adds to the terribleness of the deed that needed to be done.<br /><br />Filmed entirely in Iceland -- complete with stubby Icelandic horses -- the film's panoramic views of the stunningly beautiful countryside contributes to the rounding out of the story. Lengthy waterfalls, green hillocks, and bizarre stone formations are all incorporated through the camera lens, giving the entire production an otherworldly feel.<br /><br />Any faults are directed at the initial rushing of the story during the first 30 minutes, and the deep brogues by some actors/actresses that make it tough, at times, to understand what is being said.<br /><br />But all-in-all the story is pulled off exceptionally well.celand -- complete with stubby Icelandic horses -- the film's panoramic views of the stunningly beautiful countryside contributes to the rounding out of the story.

B0000C6E4D|3.0|I have to apologize up front, but I refuse to give an album higher than a 3-star rating when it isn't even 40 minutes long.  These things are expensive, artists!  If you want us to keep shelling out, you need to start putting out!    That being said, I think alot of the reviews here have been a little overboard.  No, it isn't FUMBLING TOWARD ECSTASY.  Guess what, she probably ain't gonna top that one, so stop expecting her to.  I've found that many artists hit an early high and struggle to reach that level again.  You just have to judge each album on its own merit, and not on how it stacks up with another.      In this case, these are very pretty and sweet songs.  People seem to really dislike PUSH, but I thought it was one of the nicest on the album.  Perhaps the detractors are unfamiliar with the positive ways that marriage and parenthood can affect a person?    Now, I will agree that the better songs on the album are the ones that harken back to the days of yore - the first three come closest, particularly STUPID, which is likely the best track on the disk.      All told, I like this album, aside from the short length - I hope Sarah continues to mature and evolve.  I think it is important for an artist to show change in their career.  And that's what she has done here.
B000FTWB7G|3.0|After listening to the new album by Evanescence, I wasn't wowed like I was with their previous releases. I used to say that they were like Godsmack with a powerful woman at the helm.

B000F8DT4Q|5.0|I have written a good review before on tears for fears: best of remixes in 2003. i thought the japan release was cool - with remixes and other rarities, including shout (beatchuggers' remix) in 2001.<br /><br />with the 2006 deluxe edition, the long wait is finally over as this great album from 1985 becomes a greater masterpiece for 2006, with additional tracks ranging from the mundane yet fantastic b-sides, to the hard-to-find 12\\" remixes and dub versions from 1984-1985. so what you get is the real deal! no remixes or materials beyond 1985.<br /><br />while i can categorically say that the 1999 uk release (with bonus tracks) actually sound better than this release, this is an essential to any tff fan due to the wealth of materials included. the first disc includes, aside from the original album, b-sides and an unreleased \\"piano version\\" of the working hour! for the second disc, this is where it gets better: you get all the single versions PLUS the 12\\" remixes that were not released on cd before. you get the single versions of shout, everybody...

B000006TRV|5.0|For me, this was the pinnacle for Pink Floyd.  Most people consider \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" or even \\"Wish You Were Here\\" as their high point, but I disagree - and not because of the album's significant sales.  It simply finds Floyd reaching way beyond the sound effects and putting together its best lyrical messages by far.<br /><br />One of my favorite elements of the album is the cycle element.  If you listen closely to the very beginning of \\"In The Flesh?\\", you'll hear quiet accordion playing that sounds like it started in the middle.  That's because it did...it's a continuation of the accordion playing at the end of the album's last song, \\"Outside The Wall\\", and is seemingly cut off.  This invites you to understand that this is a cycle of life, that begins, ends, and restarts.<br /><br />And the songs are magnificent.  \\"In The Flesh?\\" is gripping in its invitation to listen, concluding with a spiralling plane crash that ends abruptly before its inevitable conclusion, to a baby's soft crying.  This is Roger Waters' representation of his father's death in a WW II plane crash at the time of Waters' birth.  \\"Mother\\" is a stirring ode to overprotection, doubtless brought on by having to raise a child alone.  Sandwiched between the birth and Mother's overprotection is the anthem \\"Another Brick In The Wall Pt. II\\", the official theme song of schoolboy rebellion.  The album progresses into Waters' teen life, with him coming of age in \\"Young Lust\\" and then turning his rage from his negative school and home experiences on a potential lover in \\"One Of My Turns\\".  Finally, rejected by everyone, he turns inward, inside his wall, on the song that concludes the first disc, \\"Goodbye Cruel World\\".<br /><br />On the second disc, he shows regret for his isolation on the marvelous \\"Nobody Home\\"; waxes nostalgic on \\"Bring The Boys Back Home\\" and \\"Vera\\"; and then out comes the dual vocal and amazing guitar of the signature \\"Comfortably Numb\\", a song about the life of a rock star needing artificial assistance to get through a show.  The last songs on the package run a gamut of emotions - the rapture of \\"The Show Must Go On\\", which sounds like an extension of his relaxed state from \\"Numb\\"; the sudden turn on the audience with a racist rant in the reprise of \\"In The Flesh?\\"; the return of authority in \\"Run Like Hell\\" and then the theatrical \\"The Trial\\" which sentences the social outcast to the worst possible sentence - his flaws laid bare for all to see.<br /><br />All in all, \\"The Wall\\" is a lyrical peak for this legendary band.  Waters would stay for only one more album, 1983's weak \\"The Final Cut\\", before leaving for good.  Even at $30, this album is still an excellent investment and a vital part to any collection.needing artificial assistance to get through a show.

B00008PW5P|4.0|I have enjoyed most Jethro Tull albums almost from the first listening. I have even enjoyed albums that many other Tull fans did not appreciate; e.g., \\"Too Old to Rock `N' Roll - Too Young to Die.\\" Thus my surprise when I initially struggled to enjoy this album. However, after hearing this album multiple times I have come to enjoy the rather unique Tull music on this album. There are still a couple of moments on this album that I find weird, but the earthy rural theme is enjoyable. The words are genuinely descriptive of the changing rural life in Great Britain, but also to some extent the United States and the other countries of the world where farming continues to become more standardized, mechanized and computerized.<br /><br />The first song I enjoy all the way to the end. The last 30 seconds I continue to find annoying, even after listening to this song more than a dozen times. The vocals at the end I find annoying. The song itself is about the age-old battle between the farm cat and the legions of mice that exist on any farm. Of course the cat has little to fear from the mice, but the mice must always be on their guard; \\"...And the Mouse Police Never Sleeps.\\" I suspect that the end vocals are meant to somehow communicate the urgency and anxiety the mice must feel everyday, never knowing when the pounce will come.<br /><br />The second song is about visiting the wild places of Scotland and her islands. \\"Acres Wild\\" contains sensual references that indicate becoming close to nature in a very personal way. The flute, mandolin and fiddle lend a very Celtic flavor to this folk-flavored song. This song is an excellent song that helps place this album in the folk-rock category.<br /><br />The next song starts as rock. The topic is how scary it is to be a child in your bed at night, with monsters at the door and no light to comfort you. The noises in the country at night are often fearsome because so many are unrecognizable. The music accompanying the poetic lyrics is enjoyable and excellent.<br /><br />\\"Moths\\" is a love song disguised as moths attracted to a deadly candle flame. This lovely song is more folk than rock and contains sufficient poetry to keep you analyzing the words longer than I have patience. \\"Journeyman\\" follows the travel of a commuter to the country, though this song could readily apply to thousands in their suburban or rural flight in countries everywhere.<br /><br />The song \\"Rover\\" seems to be a tale of obedient love, or someone who is so head over heels in love that they are lost in the love. I like the beginning of this song with its renaissance folk music flavor. This song is highly original and a standout song on this CD. The song \\"One Brown Mouse\\" keeps the style of the previous song, though this time the song seems more straightforward. The song could be an allegory for love. The pipe organ in this song is an unusual addition that makes this song unique and lovely.<br /><br />Finally comes the epic title track. This nearly nine minute long song laments the change in agriculture from the use of the great horses, Suffolk, Percheron, Clydesdale and Shire, to tractors. The lament is heartfelt and powerful and strongly poetic with Ian Anderson's lyrics. The music is similarly powerful, with deep bass to describe these huge horses. The flavor is often folk, but there is sufficient rock power to be the theme of the horses. This song is one of the best on this CD.<br /><br />\\"Weathercock\\" was the original end of this CD. The style begins as folk, and the words are hopeful. About one minute before the end of the song the power kicks up as electric guitars carry the song to its conclusion.<br /><br />The remastered version adds two bonus tracks, \\"Living in These Hard Times\\" and \\"Broadford Bazaar.\\" The first song includes references to politicians and unions and how there is nothing left over. The folk style remains consistent with the original songs. The last song is wonderfully anachronistic. The style soundslike a renaissance song, though the words include references to motor cars and oil rigs that no longer exist.<br /><br />The new final song is wonderful and puts a different flavor on the CD than the original ending. This song is more melancholy and pessimistic than the original, and while in some ways the world is better now than when this album was originally released in 1978, in other ways it is worse. Certainly there are new concerns about the environment and some concerns about the general quality of life.<br /><br />After Jethro Tull's commercial success in the mid-1970s, some of us began wondering whether Tull had lost that which made them unique. However, the group came roaring back with the somewhat whimsical \\"Songs from the Wood\\" and this album with its earthy and significantly more pragmatic topics. The music also returned to the unique style that made Tull enjoyable to those of us tired of cookie cutter rock. There are a number of moments on this album that keep it just short of a five star rating, but a four star Tull album is better than most of the rock you'll find from that era, and as good as much of the rock from this one.he style sounds like a renaissance song, though the words include references to motor cars and oil rigs that no longer exist. <br /> <br />The new final song is wonderful and puts a different flavor on the CD than the original ending.

B000002ACR|5.0|I personally am a relatively new Byrds fan - I'm pretty sure I don't like most of the stuff after this album (country-rock was never really my thing anyway), but this album is absolutely amazing! While I agree that maybe it wasn't the most radical statement of 1967 by any stretch of the imagination, it was certainly one of the most consistently great albums of the year and the decade, and for that reason I'd also say it's also one of the most underrated. <br /> <br />Personally I've never been a David Crosby, but I actually like all of his songs here, even \\"Mind Gardens,\\" which is a bit hippy-drippy, but not bad at all. In fact I think the album benefits from its presence - it's weirdness adds diversity to the album, as does \\"C.T.A.-102,\\" which would otherwise be a good but indistinguishable song without the whooshes and alien voices. \\"Renaissance Fair\\" is also a hippy-drippy timepiece lyrically, but it's also a really great song - the guitars manage to be atonal and melodic at the same time, which is a difficult effect to describe. <br /> <br />I like \\"Why\\" a lot, too - it highlights the most direct connections between the Byrds and their more punk-influenced power pop followers in the late 70s, 80s and 90s - although I'm interested to hear that there is a better version out there. Is it available anywhere? <br /> <br />To be cliche, the cream of the crop is \\"So You Want To Be A Rock N' Roll Star,\\" where the verse predicts, strangely, Can and Talking Heads' polyrhythmic textures, world percussion and odd time signature while being a great classic Byrds song, awesome psych sound effects (crowd screaming cutting through the mix) and having a great trumpet part at the same time. Had the whole album had songs as unprecedented as this one, the album might have been a VERY radical statement. Not that any of the songs are slack at all, but it makes me wonder what would have unleashed had they not broken up. <br /> <br />I love \\"Thoughts and Words,\\" although I question ifthey couldn't have written a slightly less clashing/forced sounding chorus, which seems awkward next to the haunting, rolling guitars of the verse. The backwards tapes are awesome, by the way. \\"My Back Pages\\" is also awesome, especially the alternate take, where the Leslie really fleshes the sound out, making it more expansive where the original feels a slight bit anemic. \\"Everybody's Been Burned\\" is haunting, beautiful and wistful in a Nick Drake sort of way - along with \\"Lady Friend\\" probably the only two songs by Crosby I can say I really love. <br /> <br />The country rock tracks are my least favorite on the album, but even they are top-notch for the genre. I already mentioned I'm not a huge fan of the genre (at least, not up until No Depression alt-country - but I absolutely loathe the Eagles and am not a big CSN fan either), but I still don't skip these songs, which speaks to their strength.  <br /> <br />I haven't purchased the other early albums yet (soon I will) - so I won't pretend to be a Byrds expert enough to say this is their best or not. But I will say it is not only a great introduction to new Byrds fans, as all of the bands eras (folk-rock, psychedelia and country-rock) are present in one album with some of the strongest songwriting and playing in any of these genres. Amazing and underrated.
B00005JPBP|1.0|Is it a sin to want have an enjoyable time when shelling out my hard earned money? Is it  too much to ask to have the story make a tiny bit of sense? Am I being unreasonable to want to at  identify with, or even like, at least one of a story's characters? In my humble opinion - that's not really asking for too much!<br /><br />When driving home from the theater, it crossed my mind that the two magicians are like Karl Rove, (the Republican party strategist and our country's #1 Faustian) - they will do absolutely anything to \\"win!\\" As far as the story's two main character's are concerned, that means even committ murder (repeatedly in one case), or drive one's wife to suicide! Perhaps the filmmakers were attempting to drive this point home - there are people like our two magician madmen in the real world!<br /><br />While the word \\"obsession\\" is mentioned about a hundred times in this godforsaken story - it's misleading, like a magician's trick. What this film is really about can be summed up in four words - \\"the banality of evil.\\" How ordinary people can lose track of the simplest of concepts - \\"right and wrong.\\" The ends don't justify the means. Being famous, powerful, \\"and the best\\" is not more important than love, family, community, friendship, or even one's soul! What a terribly demoralizing story!<br /><br />The only very small bright spot in this entire dreary film, was bringing Nikola Tesla, the great inventor and energy theorist into the story.  His genius is absolutely fascinating. Too bad most viewers will think he's a fictional character like the rest of the story, instead of an important historical figure! It's a shame the story didn't evolve around him! It would have been a tad bit more entertaining! (Put his name through Amazon's search engine, and see for your self!)
B00005JPB4|5.0|\\"Flags Of Our Fathers\\" is a movie perfectly-suited for these times, examining the intersection of war, publicity, money and heroism.  With objective sobriety, director Clint Eastwood dissects how the U.S. government used the most famous photo of World War II - the raising of the flag at Iwo Jima - to drum up last-ditch support for war bonds.  <br /> <br />The Greatest Generation? The power of this movie is how it reinforces that title by cutting it off right at the knees. The subtext and commentary is so significant that it forgives its imperfections of vaguely written characters and workmanlike performances. In fact, \\"Flags Of Our Fathers\\" almost depends on its blandness. Its aim is no less than busting the myth of American heroism. <br /> <br />It does so by retelling the story of that iconic shot revealing the cost of its existence through the men who starred on that war bond tour: medic Bradley (Ryan Phillippe), runner Rene Gagnon (Jesse Bradford) and front-line solider Ira Hayes (Adam Beach). They were in the photo almost by accident, raising the second flag that day on Mount Suribachi. But it was the second picture - not the first - that told the thousand-word story.  <br />Bradley, Gagnon and Hayes - the only three in the picture who survived Iwo Jima - were whisked away from battle to meet President Truman and fumble their way through speeches. In one absurd moment, they scale a paper model of the mountain to plant Old Glory in front of 100,000 fans at Chicago's Solider Field. In another, they eat ice cream sundaes in the shape of the flag-planting.  <br /> <br />The stoic, decent Bradley manages to keep his calm, but Hayes, a sensitive man whose Native American heritage is tossed back at him in offhand, racist jokes, gets into booze and fits of self-loathing, bawling in an embrace with a fallen comrade's mother. Gagnon soaks up the adoration, yet finds himself compromised and controlled. The celebrity - and the pressure to pander - is a significant burden.If you haven't erected a heroic complex, it's hard to be one. <br /> <br />The tour is intercut with The Battle For Iwo Jima. It was the kind of fight that put an exclamation point on the cruelty and illogic of World War II: More than 25,000 men died for a tiny Japanese island, whose use as a bomber airstrip was a happy accident discovered during the battle. After most of the men had died. <br /> <br />Eastwood captures the struggle with brutal elegance. Because Iwo Jima was a volcanic island, the sand was black sulfur, and the director desaturates the film stock to match it. The result is a moonscape of empty, stark wilderness, a tropical desert of flares and silent snipers. Distinctive and moody, existential dread oppresses the soldiers on that island, and cinematographer Tom Stern effectively uses shadows, especially in a scene where Doc discovers a friend in a sulfur cave, mutilated.   <br /> <br />What a hellish, ugly, alien setting it is. As if to suggest its permanence, Eastwood casts this desaturated pall on the stateside tour scenes, too. In that crucial way, \\"Flags Of Our Fathers\\" draws out that emptiness to comment on the sheer suck of life that WWII was for this country.  <br /> <br />We can see, quite well, that the war, along with the Holocaust, devastated the reckless, forward-leaning (and often fighting) spirit of Europe, castrated it, rendered it lifeless, without much hope, especially after half of it was consumed by new, equally Cold War. <br /> <br />But what did it do to America? Looking back on my primary education, I'd describe my impression as thus:  <br /> <br />WWII catapulted the US to the top of the geopolitical polls, where it played a 40-year BCS Championship with the USSR Commicats, emerging, finally, with good quarterbacking from JFK and Reagan. It minted our military and moral superstardom, and created a story of elemental greatness needed to win that game of nukes and subs and spies - to sustain us in those hours when a balloon wasshot down at the Berlin Wall, or Nadia Comaneci scored her perfect 10s.  <br /> <br />In its final act, \\"Flags Of Our Fathers\\" hacks away at that aura. Wonderfully edited by Joel Cox, it follows the men's arcs after the tour and, through them, charts the numb, sick psyche of America underneath the hoopla of victory. We see divorce. Death. Distance. Loneliness. And beneath that is the insignificance imposed on the men by themselves and others, and the search to reverse it.  <br /> <br />Thoreau's quote about the mass of men resonates here, with one twist: Gagnon, Bradley and Hayes were plucked from that mass to represent America, arisen. Their duty done, they are inserted back none the fuller or richer, more quiet and desperate.  <br /> <br />It leads one to wonder: If not these lives rewarded, just which kind of life should one lead? Maybe desperation is the lot, in victory or defeat. Maybe it's the condition. For the stuff that really makes Ira and Doc heroes are the small duties they carry out in these final scenes and that they are of no great consolation or purpose is part of the tragedy.  <br /> <br />What is righteous feels more like suffering. What is \\"truth\\" feels aberrant. America has backed itself into a corner of greatness, of pulling off one magnificent feat of strength after another, and \\"Flags Of Our Fathers\\" puts the image under the microscope to find a cacophony of citizens pleading \\"not I.\\" <br /> <br />This portrait of America severely differs from that in \\"We Were Soldiers\\" and \\"Saving Private Ryan,\\" and while those movies serve their place, thank Eastwood (and Steven Spielberg, who developed it) for this one. It is solemn, wise and more poignant than its initial diffidence would make it seem. It is one of the best movies of the year. <br />
B00005JPBJ|5.0|How can a film be the least violent yet the most violent in a series at the same time? This movie once again from the start, takes us into the mind of Jigsaw as he lays on his death bed. His comrad Amanda is still there yet not as sane or calm as before) However, in his newest game there are not as many players, it really takes you back to the atmosphere of the first one. We first see Lynn, a doctor who has lost contact with her children and her husband, disconnected and lost from her own world. She is choosen to keep Jigsaw alive until his final game has finished (if not the results will be deadly). Then we have Jeff, a man who has lost his son, as he was killed by a drunk driver and seeks vengeance against all involved. That is his prison, that is his torment. As Jeff is  put to the test, we see he really isn't in any physical pain, in  fact it is much worse pain he must confront. All, the people involved, witness, judge, drunk driver are hidden in rooms and if jeff wishes to survive, he  must do the most painful thing of  all. Help them, keep them alive and worst of all, forgive them. This movie also features many flashback scenes from 1 and 2 and also, what happens in between these films. The saddest has to be with Adam (inbetween 1 and 2) and the one with Eric Matthews is great as well. This also features the most gruesome traps ever seen in the Saw franchise. This movie, shows growth in the series, not  only does it carry the important message and classic gore we want from Saw but it also was a very emotional movie this time around. 5/5 Not as good as the first but better than the second.
B000FQJAIW|2.0|Well, I for one, like the rest, am tired of having to buy \\"updated\\" versions of these movies.  I mean, enough is enough.  And if they're releasing a \\"Original Version\\" then it better be original.  The so called 1977 original version is MISSING SCENES!!!The most memorable, for those who actually remember the movie, is the scene where Han Solo meets the REAL HUMAN Jabba the Hutt.  YES, for all you that are new to this epic series, the part of Jabba was played by a human, NOT a guy in a costume or computer graphics.  I was watching this with anticipation of this scene and low and behold it's not in the film.  Hense, NOT ORIGINAL!!!  You know what Lucas did?  He put the 1992 VHS EDITED version of the Trilogy into DVD, not the original still from 77 and the rest of the years which I can't remember right now.  I'm so disappointed.  What's next, all the movies into one set with EXTRA FOOTAGE and a so-called ORIGINAL TRUE VERSIONS of the movies???  I'm tired of this, and I'm sure other fans are tired too.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|I can't say anything others haven't already said more elegantly, with better grammar and more insight, so i'll keep this short.<br /><br />On this disc, Bob sounds GREAT!  His voice is better then it's ever been.  He *sings*.  His voice actually soars with joy and throbs with pain.  I've never ever heard Bob singing this well and i've been listening to him since my mother brought home his vinyl album 'The Times They Are a-Changin' in 1964.  I was eight years old then, and Bob made a HUGE and permanent impression on me.<br /><br />Between the last sentence and this one, my mother called to chat and i read her the words i'd just written.  She laughed and we talked about the difference in our society and culture between then and now--and a huge difference it is.  During our talk, i warmly recommended 'Modern Times' to her.<br /><br />And so the cycle continues.<br /><br />.<br /><br />.<br /><br />.<br /><br />.<br /><br />\\"Yeah, some of them are about ten minutes long, others five or six.\\"<br /><br />Bob Dylan, after being asked in 1965 interview whether he knew what his songs were about
B000HEWEE4|4.0|I did enjoy this movie quite a bit.  How could I not?  It's mystical! I love the plot, the romance, and Sandra Bullock is one of my favorite actresses and Keanu is easy on the eyes. <br /> <br />The thing is--and maybe it's because I'm not the brightest lightbulb in the bunch (which is very possible)--but I had a hard time following the story at times.  Keanu lives in 2004 and Sandra lives in 2006 and keeping track of what's going on in their lives, letter writing, and romance can be confusing. Figuring out the goings on of that damn dog still drives me nuts! <br /> <br />I have watched it twice and that helps a lot and I enjoyed it more the second time. I think I'd like to watch it a few more times and maybe draw out a timeline of the history of these two people (and the dog)and hopefully it will all come together. <br /> <br />Away, I give it 4 stars and I reccomend anyone watch it. I got the gist of it enough to still find it very enjoyable and satisifying.  Make sure you have a box of Kleenex nearby.
B000F0UV0E|4.0|Disclaimer: I've been a Mark Knopfler fan since the very first time i heard his virtuoso guitar and unmistakable voice<br /><br />`Beachcoming', first out, sets the mood.  It's gonna be a swelling, soaring, but still melancholy outing for these two fine musicians.  I knew it would.  I wanted it, too, or i would not have bought this album.<br /><br />Their voices blend perfectly.  Knopfler's guitar mastery is as good as it's ever been and perhaps a little better.  He ages well.  He wrote most of the songs and a couple of them are on par with the best of what he's written for previous albums.<br /><br />'Love and Happiness' is simply beautiful and achingly, perfectly executed by two thorough professionals who know how to sing together and make the most of this excellent song.  Duets just don't get any better than this.  'Donkey Town' is another standout as far as i'm concerned.  Knopfler's always been a storyteller in his songs (`Sultans of Swing', `Sailing to Philadelphia', `Fare Thee Well Northumberland', `Golden Heart', on and on and on...) and the songs in this collection are no exception.<br /><br />There were only two songs i didn't care for, 'Red Staggerwing' and 'Belle Starr', but maybe they'll grow on me.  I don't think them *bad songs*, they just weren't up to the standard set by the others.<br /><br />The last two songs on this CD are the best, in my opinion.  The music is wonderful, both rich and spare at the same time, as only Knopfler can manage.  (Well, and Clapton--but 'Clapton is God', right?)  The lyrics are deeply affecting and emotionally open.  The voices are sensual and soulful perfection.<br /><br />I LOVE this CD.  It's been in the 6 CD player in my car for months and i'm not going to replace it anytime soon.
B000HCO83Q|4.0|I've never been a huge fan of this genre but I have really enjoyed all of the X-Men movies.  A very good addition to the series.  However, I think it may be helpful to see the other two X-Men movies first to get better acquainted with the background story. Extra bonus:  This is one of a very few new movies released in 6.1 DTS ES, so with the proper equipment, the sound is awesome...if you're into that sorta thing.  Watch for the short stinger (bonus scene) after the closing credits.
0805047905|5.0|I love sitting with my son reading this book.  The sing-song of the text has been perfect for capturing his attention from age 6 months to 19 months and counting.  The illustrations are very simple, and Carle did great to have someone else write the text for him.  I have a couple other Carle books my son won't sit through, but this is by far one of his favorite books of all time.<br /><br />It's so easy, even my husband is willing to read it to him.  My son loves to turn the pages and will sit on the floor by himself and look for his favorite animals.<br /><br />Plan ahead and buy multiple copies: I agree with another reviewer who had to replace a copy he had -- it gets read SO MUCH that, as well constructed as it is, the board book still goes to pieces over time.<br /><br />Happy reading!

B00005JNS0|5.0|Car was one of the best movies that I've seen with my five year old thus far.<br /><br />I did not go out and see it at first. My friend was talking about how great the movie was. I was basically getting tired of the same line of up of characters in the movies, talking animals, abandoned animals, ,etc. The hype about this movie was another factor in whether or not I was going to take my child to see it. It appeared that every one was trying to ride on the Car's band wagon, with so many companies trying to profit from it, it's a wonder if the movie was any good.<br /><br />I was floored, the movie was awesome, I am a grown woman and cannot WAIT until it is released to DVD so I can watch it over (and over and over) again with my son.<br /><br />The characters were perfectly aligned together to make an all-star cast, there is no need in making a part two, I see no way that you can top this one!
B00001OH7P|5.0|Bowie is one of those artists that I have had a love hate relationship with over the years.  When he is good, he is very good, but he has also put out a significant amount of lousy material as well.  \\"Stardust\\", of course is one of his all time classics and really one of the all time classic albums of the 70's period.  Every song here is a winner showing Bowie at his best.  The Ziggy character is probably Bowie's most enduring, and the concept works well for the most part.  Several huge hits came from this album that has become classic rock staples including \\"Suffragette City\\" and the title track.  More great stuff can be found throughout the album, \\"Five Years\\", \\"Starman\\", \\"It Ain't Easy\\", \\"Star\\", \\"Hang On To Yourself\\" and the album closer \\"Rock N Roll Suicide\\" are all great tunes.  Guitarist Mick Ronson was one of Bowie's best writing collaborators and his influence is all over \\"Stardust\\".  If you only own one Bowie album, this would be the one to get.

B000BZIST4|5.0|Even though there's nothing to say about this now 35-year-old masterpiece that hasn't been said by someone somewhere, I can't resist offering my opinion on the greatest cop movie ever made and, in all likelihood, one of the 10 best films ever made.<br /><br />How can a film be better than this one? It deservedly won five Oscars including best picture, best actor (Gene Hackman), its script and editing. Film editing is probably the most common downfall of a movie that is the least understood by the average filmgoer. aside from inane scriptwriting, it is editing that either turns individual scenes into something larger that its parts or robs those scenes of their vigor and value by misplacing them in the overall sequence of events.<br /><br />There are so many good things going on in this film -- the action, ultra-intelligent script based on a real life incident, the acting, the locations, the searing score using knife sharp high strings and bellowing lower strings, and William Friedkin's monumental direction that included the unplanned train chase scene that is now considered the greatest chase in film (\\"We didn't ask anyone for a permit,\\" Friedkin said. \\"We just did it.\\") -- that it is somewhat foolhardy to identify one element as the key to this masterpiece. Still, I believe the editing is what transforms \\"French Connection\\" from five stars to masterpiece.<br /><br />I first saw this movie in 1971 during a matinee at an old big city theatre, now bulldozed, the kind of theatre that used to exist before malls took over the industry. While the chase scene was just as riveting then as now on the big screen, it was an earlier scene that more captivated me.<br /><br />In the second scene, Hackman and Scheider go to a drinking establishment where a Supremes-like trio is singing. The reality and scope of this scene far more overwhelmed me on the big screen than any other. It also happens to be the scene where the two cops first identify bad guy Tony LoBianco -- who followed his success in this film with a lot of appearances on the 1970s CBS cop show \\"Kojak\\" -- as an emerging kingpin throwing around money with some druggie hotshots.<br /><br />It probably isn't possible to explain to today's moviegoers what a drug kingpin was circa 1971. Drugs are so ingrained in our culture now, with kids regularly taking them to and selling them in school, that the profundity of such a scene in a film can no longer have the same meaning three and one-half decades later.<br /><br />The final scene, in the decrepit buildings on Riker's Island, is another ultrarealistic scene that puts the viewer at the scene of the crime and the ongoing melodrama. That inconclusive ending was true and commonplace for its period, a time when the \\"antihero\\" film was emerging. The popular cop films from the \\"Dirty Harry\\" series, as well as Charles Bronson's \\"Death Wish\\" films, were clearly influenced by the antihero aspects of the \\"The French Connection\\" cops and their futility.<br /><br />A cast note: Marcel Bozzuffi, the hitman character known as Pierre Nicoli in the film, played a different type of killer two years earlier in the remarkable 1969 French film \\"Z\\", a political thriller with much of \\"The French Connection\\"'s sizzling energy. And like this film, \\"Z\\" was also based on true events. Check this out next time you're in the mood for one of the better films of that era.<br /><br />Far from being a timepiece, this film is just as contemporary today as it was when it came out -- a time when there was no Internet, cell phones or cable television, there was only one American telephone company and gas cost about 30 cents a gallon. This film will always be among the handful of critics' short A-list movies and I'll continue to watch it at every opportunity. I suggest you take a look if you've never seen it.

B000059LGC|5.0|Death on the Nile is an entertaining murder mystery. The cast is great starting with Peter Ustinov, as Poirot, who, with Jane Birkin, Lois Chiles and the distinctive Bette Davis, lend their many acting talents to keep you guessing about who did it. Our family, all ages, has enjoyed watching it time and again. Our son thinks that Peter Ustinov is the ideal Poirot, while I think David Suchet is more true to Agatha Christie's Poirot. We do agree, however, that both men are superb in their portrayals. Like [[ASIN:B000059LGF 'Evil Under the Sun']] this movie is a hit with us. ~ Mrs. B.

0316172324|2.0|I resisted reading this book because my preliminary 'thin-slice' of it was that it would be trendy, glib, and shallow.  Hey, maybe there is something to Gladwell's idea after all, because I did find Blink to be trendy, glib, shallow and, also, obnoxiously condescending.  Check out this quote from chapter one:   <br /> <br />\\"My guess is that many of you have the same impression of Tom Hanks.  If I asked you what he was like, you would say that he is decent and trustworthy and down-to-earth and funny.  But you don't know him.  You're not friends with him.  You've only seen him in the movies, playing a wide range of different characters.  Nonetheless, you've managed to extract something very meaningful about him from those thin slices of experience, and that impression has a powerful effect on how you experience Tom Hanks's movies.  'Everybody said they couldn't see Tom Hanks as an astronaut,' Grazer says of his decision to cast Hanks in the hit movie Apollo 13.  'Well, I didn't know whether Tom Hanks was an astronaut.  But I saw this as a movie about a spacecraft in jeopardy.  And who does the world want to get back the most?  Who does America want to save?   Tom Hanks.  We don't want to see him die.  We like him too much.'\\"   <br /> <br />Yuck!  I hate Tom Hanks.  Not personally, of course.  He's probably a nice man.  But as an actor I hate his guts.  I hate his face.  I would love to see him die horribly in the movies in a variety of ways.  Where do these 'lifestyle' writers like Gladwell get the authority to speak for everyone.  Instead of saying 'I' or 'me', they always say 'you' or 'we'.  There are some good things in this book, but they are badly undermined by Gladwell's hucksterish, Madison Avenue style of arguing and writing.  He is prone to asking leading 'straw dog' questions like 'Were these people lying?' and 'But what would happen if I were to...?'   And then answering condescendingly with 'Not at all' or 'The answer is.'  He also uses hack phrases like'Sure enough', 'but the truth is',  and, nauseatingly frequently, 'Believe it or not.'  He even actually uses the formerly uber-trendy adjective 'tony'.  Uggh!  The idea of 'thin-slicing' (oh, how I quickly came to hate that phrase) is never given a consistent, coherent defence.  Gladwell starts out with a provocative description of what might happen 'unconsciously' during the first two seconds of decision making and then doodles off for the rest of the book on a flatulent walkabout in the fields of psychology, the arts, and business.  This is a book written by a lazy amateur, a dilettante.        <br /> <br />Save your money.  I wish I did.  This book boils down to (Gladwell loves that phrase, 'it boils down to') 'follow your hunches'.  Was that worth $18?  My brother owes me $18.  I only bought Blink and read it because of his threat not to read anymore of my recommendations if I didn't read one of his.  (His last recommendation that I tried to read was Atlas Shrugged.  No more need be said about that.)  Gladwell comes to this startling conclusion ('follow your hunches') by talking to a few psychologists and Hollywood moguls and collecting a few anecdotes.  Don't try looking for a bibliography in this book, because there isn't one.  Instead 'we' have a sparse 'Notes' section which mostly consists of more anecdotes instead of references.  If you are interested in reading about human behaviour and how we think and make decisions, check out Thomas Gilovich's How We Know What Isn't So, and Robert Cialdini's Persuasion (Science and Practice).  These people are psychologists.  They do experiments. They publish their results in peer reviewed journals, and they talk to fellow psychologists, scientists, and other smart people.  They put extensive bibliographies at the backs of their books because they have read a lot about their subjects and they know that it is important to back up your conclusions and show how you came to them.  If Gladwell had spent more time in the library and less time in the hair dressers, his book might have been better.  But hey, Malcolm G.'s 'thin-sliced' the book biz.  He knows that if you are a young, trendy writer working for 'the Best Magazine in the World' you can get just about anything published, even bilge like this, and hit the best sellers' lists.             <br />
B000005RTG|5.0|I bought this album almost 15 years (as best I can recall) after last hearing it. In short, I am amazed! While Deep Purple have been one of the most consistently adrenalizing hard rock bands around, I'd always dismissed this album as a bit of a late career mis-fire. On reflection, I suspect this album originally disappointed because my (then) adolescent ears simply wanted more Blackmore...or at least someone who sounded like him. Now, after many intervening years of a much broader range of musical styles (although never drifting too far from a central love for good guitar), coming back to this album is like discovering a brand new (and very, very good) band. There are strong elements of the old Deep Purple evident. However, Bolin's playing has so modified their intrinsic sound, that there is really little to compare between this album and Burn or Stormbringer. At one level, his scatter-gun slide work gives the overall sound a more \\"American\\" tone, but I think its more than that. After a few listens, it becomes obvious that the rhythm section (Hughes and Paice) are playing around rhythms in a way that the Blackmore pseudo-classical approach could never have accommodated. I don't intend to bag the latter in anyway...its more that the sound of the Bolin line up is just so far removed from the Blackmore line up that they simply do not warrant comparison. THAT is what I didn't get 12 or 15 years ago!<br /><br />In terms of the album itself, I'd simply say that if you have disregarded it in the same way I have, you should give it a listen with fresh ears...it contains track-after-track of truly great band performances. However, if you really want to experience that backbone-stiffening, aggression-inducing rush that the best hard rock gives you; crank your stereo, skip straight through to The Drifter (Track 6) and dig it! It just doesn't get much better than that!
B0000020C4|4.0|It took some time for this musical to sink in for me but when I sat down to watch this broadcast the characters, plot, motivation(s) and all the nuances of minor characters fell into place -- it was exquisite.  Granted some of the voices might not be up to par for more experienced ears and there are technical glitches here and there but this is my favorite. I still admire Hannah Chick for continuing with Castle on a Cloud in spite of the distraction -- that's an actor.  I also find the extended applause at the end of some songs annoying but that doesn't negate the 99.99% pure magic previous. <br /> <br />My main beef is that discography is NOT IN ORDER on the second disc, and that works my nerves.  I hate having to go in and edit the list. <br /> <br />What worries me NOW is that when it comes to the time to making a film of the musical it might suffer the same fate that Sweeny Todd seems to have looming in the wings.  The Broadway musical (ST) was cast with actors, some happened to be stars.  I hate it when something as fine as Sweeny Todd, or Les Miserables, would be filmed with stars (OK, JD is both but the director and leading lady have to go) and not actors. <br /> <br />Filming of Les Miserables -- in my life time please.  Would it be asking to much to have someone do a remake of 'The Wiz' with spending a zillion dollars on junk?  Ok, ok, ok, I'm going to go listen to Philip Quast who is simply amazing and blows my socks off.
B000BZ8I9E|1.0|This is the story of the contestants, not the music, in the 6th van Cliburn Piano Competition in Dallas.  The show relentlessly pursues the question of who is going to win the grand prize.  This production is 90% talk and 10% music.  Except for the three movements from three works played by the winner at the end, all pieces consist of approximately 15 seconds of piano playing.  None are identified.<br /><br />The producer of the show seems to have thought that any amount of piano playing would bore the audience, and instead concentrated on the process of competition.<br /><br />An alternate title for this disk would be \\"Piano Competition for People Who Hate the Classics.\\"
B000I5YCCO|5.0|This is a bit of a take off from the music that I usually listen to - dance/techno or heavier country music (ie, Trace Adkins).  But the music on this cd hits me in way that no other songs have before.  The lyrics are so honest, and the tunes are delightfuly simple - you can't help but fall in love with the songs. <br /> <br />Though most of us heard \\"Tim McGraw\\" on the radio - and though it is inarguably a good song - it certainly isn't the best one on the album.  Though none of the songs thump you out of your seat, there are some that are faster paced along with the slower kind that we associate with Taylor. <br /> <br />The long and short of it is that it has been a long time since my Mom and I agreed on music to listen to - but we agree on Taylor.  That says something.
0875847706|3.0|This is an excerpt from Chapter 2 (second to last page), \\"The Universe of Possibility\\" <br /> <br />\\"So first ask yourself: <br /> <br />How are my thoughts and actions, in this moment, reflections of the measurement world? <br /> <br />You look for thoughts and actions that reflect survival and scarcity, comparison and competition, attachment and anxiety.  Notice that the question is not, \\"Are my thoughts...\\" which is a question of assessment, but, \\"How are my thoughts...\\" which is a true inquiry.  See how easy it is to argue that you are an exception, that you personally are not governed by any such set of assumptions.  This, of course is another example of measurement world at work.\\"  <br /> <br />Now what I don't understand is why is it easy to say that you are not governed by such assumptions? Sentences like these are hard to decipher when reading passages like this one and does not logically follow the   flow of the paragraph.  I understand why other reviewers might have some difficulties following the book.  If anyone can explain to me what this sentence means it would be much appreciated.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|I am a die hard BBC drama fan and in this film they have done it again.  I saw this movie and couldn't stop thinking about it.  It gets in your head.  There are many parallels to Pride and Prejudice.  In fact I would say this film is a perfect blend of Austen and Dickens.  The acting is outstanding, the locations are perfect, and the music is beautiful.  I never thought that I would find a better pair than Darcy and Lizzy but John and Margaret may replace them.  I have always hailed Pride and Prejudice as a film without fault or equal but North and South is now sharing that position.  You will cry with sadness and with joy.  It is impossible to not lose yourself in this film.  Absolutuely Brilliant!
B00005JPBJ|5.0|If you liked the first two SAW films, you will love this one for sure. The gore is kicked up to the extreme and the acting is actually really good for a horror film. Tobin Bell is still the man as Jigsaw, but Shawnee Smith and Angus Macfadyen are really strong here as well. I really liked how SAW III had flashbacks that tied all three films together nicely. This may be the best horror series of all time, just for the fact that all the films are pretty good, with none flat out sucking. I think by the way they ended this film, this may be the last film in the series, but when the studio sees how much money it makes this weekend, they may just find away to bring forth SAW IV in time for next Halloween. I think SAW III is the best and most disturbing of the series.

0671510991|5.0|I would love to give this book 1 star based on the person who wrote this book, but Kissinger has shown in almost all of his writings an understanding of world politics that goes far beyond  almost any other American student of diplomacy in analysis and historical accuracy.  This is one of his true Master Works, and is easily the best single volume on diplomacy that I've ever read.  He is able to place European diplomacy in a narrative that is exceptionally readable and erudite despite its inherently esoteric topic. <br /> <br />In terms of a general discussion of diplomacy, the next best is a *three* volume series, *The Great Powers*, by Longman Press.  Without judging the person who wrote this book, *Diplomacy* ranks with the great histories of our day.

0345404475|5.0|I finally read this book, after being a fan of the film Blade Runner for the last 16 years. I still love the movie, but I now think that it would have been even better if  Riddley Scott and company would have used more of the elements in the original story. For example, why is the wish to own an organic animal ignored in the film? It`s one of the most important themes in the novel, emphasizing how special it is to have a real animal, a piece of the world`s natural pre-war past. This desire for organic quality over cheap mechanical substitutes permeates the story. \\"Androids\\" does not picture the future as glossy and optimistic, but as a huge wasteland in which entire suburbs are abandoned and \\"kipple\\"- piles of trash- threaten to cover the landscape. It`s actually considered elite to move to Mars, Earth`s colony planet. Those who stay on Earth are often viewed as subhuman, an inferior grade of mankind. And the frighteningly realistic androids are considered even lower. Though many of them, especially the females Rachael Rosen and Irmgard, appear to be slowly becoming human, they are still considered to be things, not people. Bounty hunter Rick Deckard and his boss speak of \\"retiring\\" them, not killing them. <br />But there are several passages in which you cannot figure out who is an android and who is not, as in the eerie chapter where Deckard finds an alternate police station staffed by  replicants, with token human Phil Resch. When Deckard gives Resch an identity test, the latter even has doubts whether he is truly human. Scenes of this sort give the novel the confusing sense of unreality which is one of the hallmarks of Dick`s work. In an era in which many current books are pat and predictable, this one keeps the reader guessing. And the characters are  realistic: you can feel the emotional weariness of Deckard and repair vehicle driver Isidore, the wistfulness of Rachael as she speculates on what it might be like to be human{\\"how does it feel to be born,\\" she asks}.  <br />In short, one of the best things I`ve read in the last five years. I`m eager to read many more of Dick`s books, since I`ve started with this and his wonderful short stories.
B000I5Y8ZU|4.0|I like MCR's music, and i was surprised when i heard they were going for a different sound. different isn't always bad, but it isnt always good sometimes either. Liking their past stuff, i went out and picked up \\"The Black Parade\\" on the day of it's release. Upon popping it into my player, i was shocked to find that Gerard Way's voice is pleasently throaty, and twangy. Liking all of the songs, including the self-titled track, i am still surprised with what MCR managed to do. The influences are obvious, and the change is spectacular. Sure to be an album that generates much praise by MTV, and the critics.
076790592X|4.0|Mitch Albom captures a moment in time that is more precious than any other. It is that moment when one generation shares what they know with the next. It is a moment of pure generosity - where Morrie has nothing to gain and Mitch has everything to loose.  <br /> <br />This refreshing story gives us a vision for what it would be like if we learned to share what we know with others.
B0007OY2P8|1.0|This movie is not just a bad movie, it ranks in the highest echelons of classically bad movies. It finds itself in the rarified company of films like _Plan 9 from Outerspace_ and _Surf Nazis Must Die_. It differs from the aforementioned only in that it does not rise to the level of 'so bad its good'. Consequently, it is not even worthy to be watched in order to laugh at its abismal rendering.     I know what you are thinking, you are thinking 'I am a Jane Austen aficionado(a) and I must have this film to complete my collection. I am sure that the true fan like myself will appreciate the film more than whoever wrote this review'. I promise you that is not the case. The true fan, the fan of either Austen books or the book-based films, will find this movie ugly and tedious. There is about five minutes of Austen wit spread throughout the film, the rest is full of hackneyed acting, preposterous directing and the most ear-jaring, fingers-on-chalkboard, that-seventies-show sound track I have ever heard. (Nice saxophone!)    Oscar Wilde said that 'all bad poetry is sincere'. If the same is true for film, then no one will ever question this movies sincerity!    This movie blows. It is the first DVD that I have watched and then promptly thrown away. Don't watch it! Read the book or watch Collin Firth play Mr. Darcy one more time. You will be glad you did.
0800177177|4.0|With \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\" Director Francis Ford Coppola and Screenwriter James V. Hart sought to tell an impassioned, operatic, and epic version of the classic horror story. They also claimed it was the most faithful version to date. Therefore, the basic question was, were they successful in those endeavors? I believe the answer lies somewhere in the middle. I say, in the middle, because this is definitely one of those movies where all who saw it either loved it or hated it. There was no lukewarm or middle ground. And, yet, perhaps that is where the answer lies; in the middle. <br /> <br />  But first off, is \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\" a memorable adaptation? Absolutely. Can it be considered a classic? That I'm not sure of, but only time will tell. There is much to admire visually about the movie, however, the way the film is structured, it resembles more of an 'MTV goes Victorian Gothic' sensibility. I believe this can be jarring and confusing to first-time viewers not greatly familiar with the novel. And, just how faithful to the novel is the movie? Chronologically speaking, quite. It's what's been inserted into the storyline that detracts from its faithfulness to the novel, but was meant to give emotional force to the movie. Long time fans of horror movies perhaps groaned to see yet another \\"centuries old monster seeks his long lost love now reincarnated into a modern society woman\\" storyline revived. This originated with \\"The Mummy\\" starring Boris Karloff from back in 1932.  <br /> <br />  The basic story, which makes Dracula one and the same with Stoker's inspiration for the story (at least in name), Prince Vlad Tepes, or \\"Dracula\\" Son of the Devil. He leaves his beloved bride, Elizabeth, to go off and fight back the Turkish army from taking over land in Romania. While victorious against his foes, Elizabeth hears false news of Dracula's death, and commits suicide. This enrages Vlad and he turns against God, vowing his allegiance to the powers of darkness andbecomes a vampire. That's just the prologue which was never in Stoker's original book but sets the stage for the present action which takes place in 1897, as young solicitor's clerk, Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reeves), is to replace Mr. Renfield (due to 'personal problems') and complete a real estate transaction with Count Dracula in Transylvania. Harker travels there to do just that in a distant land and castle so obviously ominous that its a wonder Harker doesn't wise up sooner that there's something a little odd about this Count Dracula dude. Things really start to get going when the Count eyes Harker's personal portrait of Mina and believes its...you guessed it, his long lost love returned. He sets forth to England not to conquer it or to find new hunting ground, but to find her.  <br /> <br />  And, here it is that the film descends into a visual orgy of vivid sensual, and many times bloody imagery. None of it is meant to be explicitly scary as Coppola and Hart want to focus on the love story between Mina and Dracula. It works because of Gary Oldman and Winona Ryder's emotional commitments to their roles. From here on, we are introduced to familiar characters from Stoker's novel. Mina, her friend Lucy, written to be a little more, ahem, bold and forward, than in the novel, and all three of her suitors.  <br />  Dracula travels to England and puts the bite on Lucy, and Dr. John Seward (one of Lucy's three suitors) alerts his old friend and mentor, Dr. Abraham Van Helsing to come to the rescue. Van Helsing suspects the worst, and it becomes a race against time as Van Helsing and the men battle Dracula for their women, especially Mina, who is falling more and more under Dracula's power.  <br />   <br />  Anthony Hopkins as Van Helsing, if nothing else, is definitely the exact opposite of Peter Cushing's portrayal. Far from cool and calculating, Hopkins' Van Helsing is wild and unpredictable, making him almost scarier than Dracula. While its not a bad performance, it is one that may take some getting used to. Singer Tom Waits gives us a memorable Renfield, but he seems here mainly to chew the scenery (literally!). Sadie Frost makes a very physical and sensual Lucy, and gives one of the best performances in the film. In the end, the movie belongs to Oldman's Dracula. Some say its hard what to make of Oldman's \\"performance\\" due to all the make up he wears in various guises, but Oldman adapts quite well and truly presents a multi-faceted Dracula in all those different guises. He also makes Dracula more than simply a classic one note evil villain. His Count has many different dimensions emotionally, and wherever the film excels in, a large part of that has to be attributed to Gary Oldman's masterful portrayal.  <br /> <br /> The cinematography is marvelous and lush, with large doses of passionate Gothic thrown at the viewer like loads of syrup. The music score by Wojciech Kilar fits the visuals perfectly and is extremely romantic and intense. The costuming by Eiko Ishioka, is wonderful, if a little bizarre at certain points (witness Lucy's lizard like funeral dress). The sets by Tom Sanders are epic, if at times over the top (ex. Dracula's castle). However, you can't help but be completely drawn in by this love of excess. Just don't expect a story to flow too coherently and enjoy everything else. I think that's the highest praise and most honest assessment that can be given to \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula.\\" <br />
B00005JPBJ|5.0|This could very well be the final saw movie and I think that is for the best. They don't need to run this in the ground like Freddy, Jason, and Michael Myers, just to name a few. The reason I think that this should be the last installment is because it is the best movie of the trilogy! Never or at least rarely is a third installment better than the first or second, but this movie delivers. It is far more gruesome and intense and the plot is by far the best yet. They pulled out all the stops on this one and you won't believe your eyes when you see some of these scenarios. It ties the story from the first two perfectly and answers all the questions you could possibly have and I think that is great. I don't wanna ramble or describe every detail of the movie to you like everyone else on this website, I just wanna tell you guys to go see this film if you loved the first two. You have to! This movie hit me on so many different levels. I was squirming in my seat and felt truly sorry for the people going through these dastasrdly torture sequences, and you will to. It's guts and glory people and this masterpiece in true horror deserves all the glory it receives. Go see this movie, you will not be disappointed. You may wanna have a bag handy if you have a weak stomach though. GO SEE IT! MY GOD IT WAS GREAT!!!!!!!
B00004Y6NU|4.0|When Dire Straits released their debut back in 78 with Sultans of Swing the bluesy catchy song sent people scurrying out to buy this album and for the most part weren't disappointed.Four years later this album was released.Although expecting to find a similiar sounding album what I got was a collection of a more transitional pieces of music.Telegraph Road runs 14:20,while the rest are under 8 minutes.Industrial Disease is kinda humorous in its sick way and It Never Rains shine with a masterful guitar solo which makes up for the ones you don't hear as it was drowned by Alan Clark.Perhaps it would of been different if David Knopler hadn't of left but a change had to come for the better.Although it is wasn't a comercial success its in a class all by itself.
B00005JP81|3.0|Although the performances in this film were excellent--especially the one by Ryan Gosling, I was not that impressed by the directing nor writing.  I found this to be a pretty slow moving film.  It had a tendency to drag on and on--especially the classroom scenes.  A good work of art needs variation: fast/slow, loud/quiet, bright/dark, etc.  This film was too slow and too quiet.  Very monotone.  That was the flaw in the directing.  As for the writing, I found the classroom scenes totally unbelievable.  As an inner-city, secondary school teacher myself, let me tell you--I have never seen such well behaved students.  Even if they did like their teacher.  Where was the talking back to the teacher, verbal disagreements amongst the students, fights in the classroom, throwing paper at the teacher, etc.?  For a while I thought this classroom took play at Dalton prep school on the upper East Side of New York than an African-American/Latino neighborhood of Brooklyn.  These kids are coming from broken homes with family members in jail and drugs right around the corner.  You don't think they're going to bring some of that garbage into the classroom?  Well, I sure didn't see it in this film.  I found the family dinner scene unnecessary.  What was the point of it?  To explain how Don became a substance abuse addict like his father and a cynic like his mother.  It really didn't add anything to the story.  I did like how the film tried to portray Don as a good person with a good heart who just happened to be weak by being addicted to drugs.  That was one of the strengths in the film: Ryan Gosling's portrayal of Don.  However, it would've been nice if there was a little bit more of a story in the film.  Having Don and Drey trying to help eachother in an unfortunate situation did not seem enough of a story.  That's probably why the dinner scene was included in the film--there wasn't anything else of importance to replace it with.  Not a bad film but not that great either.
B000GY729M|5.0|I've read the reviews and the critics hate it, but I think it's bigger and better than Hot Fuss!  It's high energy.  The hooks, the loud sound, the keyboards, horns, choirs it's crazy, really.  I highly recomend this CD!

B000FS9FCG|5.0|This movie is one of the most moving and greatest films, ever. I've watched it a few times, and every time I do I realize something else about it.<br /><br />First of all, I think it's a great idea of the future. Cuz who knows? Maybe that really is what we're heading for. And Evey(Natalie Portman)is totally awesome in this film. You've got to hand it to the girl for being able to be shaved and still look great.<br /><br />And V in himself is such an interesting and spell-binding character. Yet he's hilarious at the same time, so open and honest, well just funny.<br /><br />And the whole idea is just amazing, and beyond me. It's a horrible idea of a future, and V's going to make it better for anyone he can, the only way he knows. That's all I'm gonna say though. Don't want to give anything away.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|How do you describe a movie like \\"Shaun Of The Dead\\"? Well, that's the hard part, because there really isn't anything else out there like it. The writing is incredibly smart...mixing comedy, horror and even a bit of drama all together so well. it's a movie that can't be classified, as anything other then just a GREAT film. There are moments that make you laugh out loud, followed by, and sometimes mixed with scenes that are genuinely creepy and unsettling. And towards the end, there are some truly touchingly sad moments. I give immense credit to star/co-writer Simon Pegg & director/co-writer Edgar Wright. I just wish there were more movies like \\"Shaun Of The Dead\\" being made these days; ones that are as entertaining and intelligent. Going to the movies would be a lot more fun.
B000002N25|5.0|I love this CD!  About the only track that I just don't get why Mr. Knopfler felt the need to make a statement about is \\"Imelda\\"...referring to Imelda Marcos and her shoe addiction...Anyway, not a bad tune just a puzzling \\"issue\\"....This CD keeps you entertained as every song is different.  Best track is \\"Golden Heart\\"....a truly wonderful love song without being too sappy.  In my opinion, anyway. Love it all.
B00005JPAD|1.0|While this film had a all star cast and is quite lengthy, it left me with a I want my money back feeling in the end. It had a poor plot. It demeaned women,other ethnic groups if not Irish, religion etc. The plot bascially was about an amoral criminal(a user/manipulator with no conscious) who inflitrated the justice system and extorted money from his neighborhood. He observed for the brightest and most vulnerable children and enticed them into the organization. I would not classify this as a thriller or action/adventure. This film was intended to shock your sensiblities, such as after shooting execution style a man and woman in the back of the head, the lead character states \\"On they fell funny.\\" If you enjoy lots of gore (head style executions) then this depressing film is for you. They all had the Boston accents but were a little thick.
B000002AGN|5.0|I owned Time Out in the original 33 and a third l.p. format when I was in high school, 1960's.  Somehow I lost it over the years and it was like a swift jolt to the past to hear this crisp, clean and clear c.d. of a wonderful bit of historic jazz. I got to see the Brubeck Quartet while a student at the University of Minnesota, class of 1964, and again this historic album captures the mood of this long ago memory.  Good stuff.
B000003TA4|5.0|Not just for those interested in \\"grunge\\" or \\"punk\\" but also for Beatle lovers everywhere, if you love rock and roll you must own this album, as it is Cobain's masterwork where all of his influences came together.    The songwriting here is brilliant, especially in \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\", \\"In Bloom\\", \\"Breed\\", \\"Lithium\\", \\"Drain You, \\"Lounge Act\\", and \\"On A Plain\\" (Too many highlights, oh well).  And those are just my favorites anyway,  not to mention the battering ram introduced by a Youngbloods' lyric \\"Territorial Pissings\\", or the dark acoustic \\"Polly\\".  Forget about all that revolution talk and listen to the music, then ask yourself what you would think if you had heard this album and no one had heard it before (I think you know the answer, something like \\"WOW, these guys are gonna be HUGE!\\").    So what if there are pop hooks galore in the music, for Cobain the Beatlemaniac it definitely makes sense.  And so what if the guitar solos aren't intricate enough, if you want guitar solos listen to Bleach because this is where the songwriting, melodies, and riffs scrape up at perfection.    While some say In Utero is the better album, could you really listen to that album more than once in a day?  Maybe, but I've listened to this album five times in a row before.  And then those who say Unplugged is their finest moment, sure \\"About A Girl\\" and \\"The Man Who Sold The World\\" are some of Nirvana's finest performances, but other than \\"Where Did You Sleep Last Night?\\" and \\"Lake of Fire\\" none of the intensity of \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" is there, let alone the fun of \\"Breed\\" and \\"Lithium\\".    This is the album where it was still fun and Cobain had just realized his genius.  This was before all the drugs, the fame, and most of all before Courtney Love.  Some may say this album would've never been so popular without Cobain dying, and that is completely wrong.  For that to be true it's better to look at Unplugged or In Utero which are easy to pity in retrospect, unlike the confidence and genius of Nevermind that Cobain SHOULD be remembered by (but far too frequently is not, unfortunately).  This album is hands down the best cd of the nineties, and stands up there with the classics from the Beatles, Zeppelin, The Who, Creedence, Clash, Sex Pistols, X, and etcetera.  Forget about the hype and the pain of the later days and just listen to the music, you'll find it sticks up well on its own, straight up and brilliant.
B0000028M7|5.0|I feel that this album is one of those that was perfectly made .  There aren t many recordings that have been made that have that type of quality , as does Dirt .     Facelift was a very good starting point to this band .  I was able to see them open for the Clash of the titans tour in '91 .     There are songs here that have the category of ' fantastic ' or timeless .  We are very lucky to have groups as was Alice to give us such high quality music .     Because that s what we humans should do when we hear music .  Is listen to very good ( music ) .  Nothing else .  And not all music is ' good ' music     I tend to go back to my 18 years of age and my friends back in 1993 listening to this awesome album , that also accompanied the 1993 ish smorgasboard of music we alternative teens listened to in that special point in musical ' time ' ( A lot of Grateful Dead , Smashing P , Porno for Pyros and anything like i said that was good )     I try to remember how i d neve heard atune like Rooster ( Its words and music ) .  Especially the music , or the difficult to describe ' blend ' of music / lyrics .  5.000.000 stars for that song .  ( I m very generous )     On a  good stereo system the whole album sounds good , but when you get to Rooster turn it way up , and you ll see what I mean about this ' good music ' bizness im talking to you about .     Comparing it to Facelift , it s a growing point .       After 1996 I really lost touch with their music .  And I ve been living in Chile ( my country of birth ) since 99 so when I heard about our brother Layne Staley s death , I thought ' No way ' .  Rest in peace dear brother .     I hope the rest of this group continues in good things .  Especially Jerry .  One of the records I have to obtain soon is Boggy Depot , since it has such good reviews . I wish Mike Starr , Sean Kinney and Mike Inez  s lives are and always will be accompanied by god s good will .  You guys ( if you read this ) made some of the best music that existed on planet earth .  You are among the few groups that could do that .  Layne is with us , just not phisically .       Peace
B000003TAR|5.0|This is the album that reminds you that Kurt Cobain was not just a rock star and an innovator, but also one of the best songwriters of the 90s.  To those that say Nirvana was only it for the money, or that Kurt Cobain's suicide note only stated he was quitting the music business, one listen to this work makes you realize that music was life for Kurt Cobain, and he could never possibly have one without the other.    Of course, after a work as intense as this there was no way to go any further in that direction, thus causing Nirvana to go softer for their unplugged album, and leaving Cobain without a direction to go in his career.    While some say this album is a suicide note, this is in fact Kurt Cobain and music itself at their most alive.  It's where a man is teetering at the edge without falling in...if only he could have stayed around a little longer and made it through so we'd still be experiencing his genius today.  Instead we have some brilliant music to listen to, and for now that's more than enough.
B00006JKOL|4.0|I bought this for my husband who is a big Jethro Tull fan. He loves it and remembers it fondly.
B00006FDCD|4.0|I guess I'll be one of the few people who still enjoys watching the television adaptation of the Stephen King classic \\"It\\". Unfortunately the Stephen King novel was so long not everything in the book could be included in the tv mini-series otherwise the tv mini-series would have probably been a week long mini-series. I can understand why fans of the novel is not enamoured with the film unlike me.<br /><br />The storyline takes place in Derry, Maine. The small town is plagued by a series of mysterious killings of children by a monster that adults are unable (and in serious denial) to believe in. This monster comes in the form of the extremely creepy Pennywise the clown played by the brilliant Tim Curry who made me see clowns in a whole new light after seeing the film. Tim Curry's performance truly stood out for me. I still get the goose bumps whenever I come across \\"It\\" on cable tv.<br /><br />The protagonists of the story is a small circle of childhood friends who were considered outcasts by their peers and losers by a group of psychotic bullies. The cast is rounded out by Harry Anderson, John Ritter, Jonathan Brandis, Seth Green, Annette O'Toole, Richard Thomas, Tim Reid, Emily Perkins, Ben Heller, Olivia Hussey, and Dennis Christopher.<br /><br />The film begins with a phone call from Mike Hanlon (Tim Reid) to his friends when the killings begins again after their last encounter with Pennywise. While everyone had left Derry, Mike remained in town as the unofficial watcher of It. This is not a happy reunion to say the very least. The story goes between the past and present.<br /><br />I personally enjoyed the film adapation a lot. Yes it is a very condensed version of the novel but ya can't cram every single detail from the book into the film within a certain amount of time. Every scene with Tim Curry as Pennywise the clown sent the hairs on the back of my neck straight up, especially the opening sequence when he encounters Bill's younger brother George Denbrough. The confrontation between the grown up friends and the flesh eating spider was cheesy, if not laughable. Despite the obvious edits and cheesy confrontation, I still love \\"It\\". This is the only film that creeps me out. Eat your heart out Michael Myers, Freddie Krueger, and Jason Voorhees.Denbrough.

B000068PQ0|5.0|okay this is undoubtfully the best flaming lips album that they ever released and its a good place to start for beginner fans <br /> <br />Its an album that you're embarressed that you bought it at first listen but the second time its slightly better until it is one of your favorite albums of all time <br /> <br />its how it works <br /> <br />1. Fight Test-10/10: A happy sounding tune, with a good beat. Its really catchy and has some good lyrics <br /> <br />2. One More Robot- 7/10: The only song on the album that i dont really like. It has some interesting lyrics and its a cool spacey subject. The song is pretty psychedelic anyways <br /> <br />3.Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots pt 1- 10/10: One of the catchiest songs ever made. I dont think i have to say much more about that. Pretty weird lyrics and sound effects in the background <br /> <br />4. Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots pt 2- 10/10: The most rocking song on the album, and has overpowering drums (which is good). It makes you feel cool when you listen to it, and it pulls you in. Once you start the song it cant be stopped <br /> <br />5. In The Morning Of The Magicians- 10/10: My other favorite song on the album because of the textures and the ability to go from a soft ballad-like middle section back into an infectious groove between the bass and drums. This is an emotional song, too, and makes you think. <br /> <br />6. Ego Tripping At The Gates of Hell-8/10: Another song that i dont like too much. Its the trippiest song on the album though. But it doesnt realy change from the main beat, which is kind of boring. But its almost blasphemy to call a flaming lips song boring. <br /> <br />7. Are You a Hypnotist??- 10/10: This song has the coolest music video ever made and is fun to play along to on the drums. The groove is slightly repetative but its too cool for words almost. This is definitely one of the high points of the album. <br /> <br />8. Its Summertime (throbbing orange pallbearers)- 9/10: This is a good song to listen to if you're feeling blue. The lyrics are about how it is alright to be sad even though its the summer. The lyrics are almost depressing, but the song makes you feel better about yourselfa <br /> <br />9. Do You Realize?- 10/10: At fist listen you're like \\"what the he-ll is this?\\" but then it grows on you. This song also has depressing lyrics, but print them out and sing along. This song has almost an uncountable amount of layers to make it stand out from the rest. <br /> <br />10. All We Have Is Now- 10/10: This is the best song on the album without a doubt. There is no question that this is the best song. This song has the coolest lyrics out of any song ive ever heard. Its so trippy and correct about the modern times. Wayne's voice is so haunting and amazing on this song. I cant even describe how i feel about it. <br /> <br />this song alone, is worth the entire price of the album <br /> <br />11. Approaching Pavonis Mons by Balloon (utopia planitia)- 10/10: A good way to end this masterpiece. This is a psychedelic experimentation tune, that has a great beat and cool riff. This is a great song to listen to in headphones because it drifts from left to right ear. Very trippy song with many layers <br /> <br /> <br />thats about it..... well worth the price  <br /> <br />and thank you for reading, <br /> <br />Nate Anderson <br /> <br />Gig Harbor, Washington <br /> <br />
079073804X|5.0|I saw this movie 32 years ago, and I am now 44.  I said then I would never watch it again, and so far I have kept my word.  It scared the heck out of me for 7 days.  For 7 days I could not sleep. I still ask my Mom today, was that your idea of punishing me for something? and she always laughs and says, you wanted to see it.  One of the best, (if not the best), horror films ever made, period.  Enough said!

0143034901|4.0|I found this book reminiscent of books by Charles Dickens, in that it featured a large cast of odd characters whose lives continued to intersect, eventually forming one huge convoluted web.  Realizing this was the case early on, I enjoyed discovering how everyone would eventually meet.<br /><br />The book tells the story of Daniel, a boy who falls in love with a novel by Julian Carax.  He tries to find another book by this author but comes to find out that he seems to be in possession of the only remaining copy of any of this author's books.  Someone is traveling across Europe, stealing or buying all of Carax's books and setting fire to them.<br /><br />Thus Daniel embarks on a quest to figure out what happened to Carax, whether he is, in fact, dead, and why someone would want to burn his novels.<br /><br />I found the ending of this book, in which it was finally clear how all of the stories affected each other, extremely gratifying.  The novel was a bit long winded in parts and perhaps could have been a hundred pages or so shorter, but I still enjoyed it a great deal.

B000HT3Q3M|5.0|At a time when artists over the age of 40 are relegated to doing albums of covers or remakes of their past hits, Benson and Jarreau put a spin on the concept along with a few twists largely to great results. Starting with Jarreau's take on Benson's, \\"Breezin\\" and Benson's take on Jarreau's \\"Mornin',\\" George and Al follow up with other covers including an outstanding version of \\"God Bless the Child\\" featuring vocals by Jill Scott and a \\"surprise\\" vocal performance by Sir Paul McCartney on Sam Cooke's, \\"Bring It On Home to Me\\" that ends with an unexpected gospel vamp. These tracks along with the orignal compositions written mostly by Jarreau, including my favorite, \\"Let It Rain,\\" featuring the fantastic Patti Austin, highlight what would of been a predictable set by two jazz legends. Instead Benson and Jarreau demonstate that they are still relevant in today's market and overall provide a lesson for some of the \\"new stars,\\" as George refers to in the liner notes, on just how contemporary jazz should be done. Hopefully this is just the beginning and other Benson/Jarreau collaborations to come.
B0000AXE8I|2.0|Reloaded opens with an explosion and karate, one of many problems with it. It tries too hard to outdo the first flick and ends up looking dull. It did not help that I saw the original Matrix umpteenth times in TV reruns, so I was tired at seeing more slo-mo karate. Another problem is Reloaded attempts to seem profound with nonsense dialogue:  <br />\\"Why are you fighting the machines?\\" <br />\\"Because I choose to.\\"  <br />(Deep silence.) <br />So many unanswered questions: Why did people within the Matrix look exactly like themselves outside of it when they never saw themselves to begin with? <br />Why didn't Smith download himself a million times into human hosts like the first guy and rage on?
1878424319|5.0|Sometimes I think that if I could just really live \\"The Four Agreements\\" once and for all, I would be really happy.  But I guess there really is no \\"once and for all\\" while we're still breathing.  As long as we're breathing there's more to learn - and more challenges to push us into that learning.

B000000Y27|5.0|Years ago I had read in a jazz magazine how some top jazz guitarists were influenced by this album, so wanting to find out more about Wes I bought it. This was also my first Wes album(CD), and I was blown away! <br />All I had heard before was some of his more \\"pop styled\\"songs. I started buying a lot of him, but I still don't think there's a better one. Every song is great, the band is great, and I like the sound of his guitar better than a lot of his others. This is got to be in the top ten of all guitar records! In my opinion, an essential jazz recording.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|This is a great politcally driven hero movie. It's not like Batman Begins or Superman, or the X-Men movies. This is a movie that dwells on the rights of humanity, freedom, and the passion we all should have about the powers that be within our governments. It's set in Europe, but you can relate to the story easily. It doesn't have a lot of action, but the action is done really well and smoothe. Some will love this movie, other's will not due to it having more depth than other comic related movie titles.
B00000I41G|5.0|Having first a strong love for blues guitar, it was easy to love this album. This was also my first Kenny CD, and I've bought many since then. Kenny has also become my overall favorite jazz guitarist and that's from serious competition from Wes, Johnny Smith, Joe Pass,Tal Farlow, and other top players. Kenny's approach is just cool, his tone great, and it's also what he doesn't do that makes him great! This album says it all for me.
B00005JPBJ|4.0|PREMISE:<br /><br />Jigsaw, althought brilliant in his own right, has a tendancy of causing mayhem. He kidnaps people and puts them in a contraption that either makes them die, or forces them to lose something in order to gain freedom from his clutches. With the help of his new assistant, Amanda, he is able to continue to do his bidding on the lives of seemingly innocent (although we know better) people.<br /><br />SYNOPSIS:<br /><br />In the third, and probably final installment, Jigsaw has kidnapped a doctor, who is going through relationship problems and is disconnected with her children and friends. She is now part of Jigsaw's game. With a bomb wrapped around her neck, she must keep Jigsaw alive long enough for Jigsaw's latest player, Jeff, to escape the trenches of his dark past. Jeff must go through a series of rooms so that he can overcome the loss of his son be defying the people that not only caused his son's death, but did nothing to let the murderer rot in a jail cell. Somehow all of these people are related, and in this movie, you find out exactly how.<br /><br />MENALITY GOING IN:<br /><br />I did expect a lot. After seeing Saw, I was amazed at the clever writing, brilliant trap design, great acting, and overall erieness of the film. It was grotesque, dark, and fantastic. With an incredibly small budget, the film still managed to make a large bank, enough money in fact to pay for the next two movies. In Saw 2, the writers went in a different direction. They made it seem more like a Ratrace to get to the exit point and overcome the challenges along the way. Like the first movie, every player in the game was somehow connected, and they all had to choose their fate. The second one really made you understand Jigsaw's motives, and what he was trying to accomplish. The message was that you must not take life for granted, and must give up the things we love the most to deserve the right to live. A man of few, but powerful words. With all this prior experience with the film, I was very confident that the third film will live up to the hype, and live up to the Saw petigree.<br /><br />REVIEW:<br /><br />This film, at least at the beginning, seemed to try to go back to its roots. It was focusing on single person trying to escape, as opposed to a large group. Continue directly after the last movie, Daniel's father was trapped with a chain on his foot and left for dead. Directly following this trap, you are led to two more victims, in difference scenarios. What makes this dumb is, how they really don't connect to the main story. As things unfold, you are led on an emotional roller coaster, while we see Amanda and Jigsaw's disfunctional relationship fall apart. On his deathbed, Jigsaw is testing Jeff, who recently lost his son, and must face the witness who fled from the scene and could have put the murderer behind bars for life, the judge who let the murderer go, and finally the murderer himself. The traps weren't for him, and if he wanted, he could have let all three of them go. Jigsaw's task was to test his forgiveness, and see if he could finally let the past go and move on with his life. Jeff was obsessed with wanting to find and kill the murderer, and it was starting to distract and tear apart his family. Lynn, the doctor, has a neck brace with explosives set around the edges. If Jigsaw's heartrate flatlines, they explode, and she dies. She is forced to operate on his against his will to postpone his emminent death from his hemorrhaging brain long enough so that Jeff could erase his past. Amanda, who was saved by Jigsaw has been part of Jigsaw's game before. She had to cut a man open in the first one, and was thrown into a pit of syringes in the second one. Without giving too much away, I can say this, each movie had a really surprise ending that made you reevaluate the entire movie and totally threw you for a loop. This one, not so much. Although many of the traps were well executed and brilliant, they lacked the cleverenginuity of the first two movies, and although the shock value was higher in this film, the twist at the end just wasn't as unpredictable is in the first two. One thing I did like though, was how the movie focused more one the victims than the on the cops, which is good to see. This makes you really understand the character more, like you have a deep seated relationship with them. Makes their story more effective if they were to die.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />I'd say that this is the weakest of the three films, but I wasn't entirely disappointed. The movie was still great, and had a few nice touches that made this a welcome edition to the Saw family.<br /><br />RATING: B (4/5 stars)the first two movies, and although the shock value was higher in this film, the twist at the end just wasn't as unpredictable is in the first two.

B0000A1RJI|4.0|I enjoy listening to this music alot, very fun and nice to hear.
B0001CNRSE|3.0|I stumbled on this while channel-surfing and was pleasantly surprised.  The ever sunny and optimistic Honey Daniels holds down two jobs in her increasingly hectic life - a bartender by night and a hip hop dance instructor by day. She has hopes of one day appearing in a music video, a dream that comes true when she catches the eye of a big time producer named Michael Ellis. Not only is Honey a smash in her first video appearance, but Michael immediately hires her as choreographer for one of his projects.<br /><br />The movie wants to be taken seriously as a realistic view of urban life but very little of what we see ever rings true, starting with Honey herself who, with her invariably perky demeanor, seems like a cross between Little Mary Sunshine and Mother Teresa in form fitting jeans and matching halter top. Everything that happens to her - from her meteoric rise in the music video world to her purchase of an empty store for her new dance studio to the benefit performance she and her dancers stage to raise the money for the project - all come about way too easily and with virtually no noticeable effort on her part. We never believe for a moment that any of this would happen in this way in the real world.<br /><br />Honey is really little more than an urban fairy tale, fine for children, I suppose, but not of much use for adults with a more pragmatic understanding of how life actually works.
B000FTWB7G|2.0|Evanescence shall always been known and remembered for their songs Bring Me To Life and My Immortal. Having said that, I thought the band broke up just before receiving their Best Newcomer Award at some MTV show? Then Ben Moody left and members of this band just keep vanishing and getting replaced. Taking notes from Duran Duran perhaps? <br /> <br />The Open Door, I wonder what they're referring to, perhaps their rejuvenated band that might just open the door to more movie soundtrack opportunities? This album was number 1 on the Billboard Top 200 album chart the first week it was released, big deal. It was attributed to the success of their first (and best) album Fallen and the long wait to get another album out, fans must have been hungry for more Evanescence music. What? They couldn't turn to other groups? You would think that listening to Fallen and now The Open Door, that there would be some evolution in their music, a new direction perhaps, especially after they had so many band member replacements, more new ideas would come into the picture. <br /> <br />Song after song after song just sounds similar! From Sweet Sacrifice to Call Me When You're Sober. The guitarist just strums the same few chords and rhythm over and over again in all the song tracks, almost like a machine gun firing in moderate staccato, utterly no imagination at all. Snow White Queen started to see some new direction in the rhythm of the music, but then it started going back to square one with The Only One. The same guitarist strumming the same rhythm in the chords again. Sigh. Listening to the whole album, I really didn't have any idea if I'd moved onto track 2 or 3, especially with such similar rhythms. Perhaps they were just recycling the rhythms from Bring Me To Live in their Fallen album, which fans seem to love so much. <br /> <br />The only saving grace in this entire album is Amy Lee's beautiful voice, but she needs a new lyric writer, the same screaming, yelling and moaning just doesn't do her voice justice. I strongly believe she should leave the band and start doing her own solo CDs, which I'm sure there are tons of fans out there who want her to do just that! I also believe she should try trip hop! <br /> <br />I know Gothic/Alternative/Rock/Pop/Whatever should sound almost like that, but with some form of imagination, it wouldn't be so tiresome to listen to! 1 star for effort, 1 star for Amy Lee's voice, the rest was just ear vomit! Shame on them! <br /> <br />I've already used my CD as a frisbee and surprisingly it sails rather well through the air and oh, hey, look, a dog caught it between its jaws. <br /> <br />Crunch!
B00005JL7Q|3.0|'About a Boy' is starring Hugh Grant and this time he is a little different. He is not the clumsy guy he always is. In the beginning he is actually mean, but mean in a very funny way. He becomes friends with a boy (Marcus). At first he doesn't want that but Marcus changes him and slowly makes him a good man. Marcus himself has a mother who tries to kill herself (Toni Collette).<br /><br />The film is very funny and has some moving points too. Nicholas Hoult who plays Marcus does a great job and I liked Hugh Grant in this film. He has all the funny things, in his words and his appearance. Toni Collette is strange but she proves again she is a hell of an actress. The actress I liked the most was Rachel Weisz (her character is also named Rachel) as the love interest of Hugh Grant, later on in the film. She is beautiful and very lovely, even with this little time on the screen.<br /><br />The film has an intelligent story, adapted from the novel of Nick Hornby. All the characters have the exact right actor to play them. For the most part Hugh Grant makes this film work as a comedy and Nicholas Hoult and Toni Collette make it work as a drama. In the end you will feel good, and you had a good time as well.
B0006SSOHC|2.0|I decided, after watching \\"SAW 3\\" this weekend, to give this movie another look-see, to re-evaluate and check if my original thoughts had changed over the past three years. Nope.<br /><br />\\"Saw\\" is a hack-job of a movie, cribbed from superior scripts like \\"Se7en\\" and \\"The Cube,\\" where victims get lured into totally illogical situations in some psychopath's attempt at teaching them a lesson. But \\"Saw\\" completely lacks \\"The Cube's\\" fascist police state backdrop or \\"Se7en's\\" gruesome moral bent. Instead, two random men, (writer/director Leigh Whannel and Cary Elwes) are trapped in some music video concept of a warehouse bathroom with a dead man, gun and tape deck between them. And things go downhill from there.<br /><br />Cary Elwes' acting is so strident that he becomes funny by the final act, as he simply just doesn't have the chops to portray that madness he's succumbing to. Danny Glover - obviously slumming it - turns into a hysterical twit as time rolls on. Whannel is so cardboard that you need only to look at his other credentials to understand how he got his part. Dialogue is beyond corny. And that's just the actors.<br /><br />When you get to the script, the continuity is howlingly laughable. Men step from bathtubs and are dry. Items removed from water are also dry. Blood appears on victim's clothing and disappears. And in one of the most hysterically ridiculous gaffs in modern movies, a truck involved in the chase scene changes MODELS by the end of the chase!<br /><br />OK so I sat through the whole thing two times. But the movie's concept is relatively slick - enough to lure in scared patrons to two sequels and make Tobin Bell's Jigsaw one of the better movie villains in recent horror genres. (Incidentally, I feel \\"Saw 2\\" to be the best of the three films, and \\"Saw 3\\" a shade better than the original if only by benefit of better budget and better acting.) But if you take your horror/suspense movies seriously, you'll understand just how \\"Scary Movie 4\\" made hash out of \\"Saw\\" with barely an effort.4\\" made hash out of \\"Saw\\" with barely an effort.
0156030322|5.0|Where has James Sallis been all my life? This short, powerful, tremendously exciting novel is a perfect contrast to 99% of the mysteries we usually read. It is truly more than a crime story, an existential portrait of a criminal. It's 158 pages long, with large print, and I read it in 2 hours. But I won't soon forget it. It is a very modern version of THE STRANGER by Camus, tracking the downward spiral of a young man whose life of crime seems almost inevitable, preordained.    Sallis's clear, poetic voice makes me think about life, about the advantages I have that not everyone has. About how very easy it is for someone like \\"Driver\\" to take a wrong turn and end up in a hell on earth. And that is precisely where he is. What a concept--a crime novel that actually shows us the downside of crime. It is brief, pointed, ferocious, and absolutely brilliant.    Now I'm off to find Sallis's other books. This guy really knows the territory. Take a DRIVE and see if you agree with me.
B00005JPBJ|3.0|You know how trilogies that are based on one idea tend to lose their edge? Welcome to \\"Saw III.\\" It is not as tense as the second (and best in this franchise), nor does it have the benefit of the surprise shock of the first (a movie I found to be enjoyable but grossly over-rated). Where \\"Saw 2\\" had the benefit of multiple characters playing cat and mouse in a single venue, \\"Saw III\\" pits Jigsaw and his protege Amanda against a Doctor and a man consumed by guilt. In other words, you have to care about how these four people play against each other in order to get caught up in the movie. A drawback to the original \\"Saw\\" was the fact that the acting was so hammily bad that I spent more time wondering about the film's many plotholes and continuity issues (climbing from a bathtub and not being wet?) than caring about the fates of the characters...and that happens here to a lesser degree.<br /><br />But I am sure that most of the viewers to \\"Saw III\\" could give a rat's beak about such mundane things as plot. It's the gruesomely inventive tortures that matter here, and \\"Saw III\\" really delivers on the gore and gross points. As Jeff (Angus McFayden) tries to negotiate his way out of one of Jigsaw's death mazes, he is forced to confront his own rage and guilt over the loss of his son to a drunk driver. Instead of being the one in eminent danger of death, he must save those he feels responsible for the leniency shown the killer of the boy. And each of these victims is tortured in variously cinematic disgusting manners. (The pig-guts trap on the judge offers a minor funny subtext.)<br /><br />Meanwhile, Jigsaw (played with subtle malevolence by Tobin Bell) is playing mind games with the doctor he has kidnapped into performing surgery on his cancer ridden brain and his assistant Amanda's slippery grasp on sanity. The gross-out factor here is Really High...I found myself cringing more in these surgical segments than during the those involving the death-traps. In an effort to shore up the motivational factors, \\"Saw III\\" lays on the flashbacks. You discover more of what brought Amanda under Jigsaw's spell, how the fates of the victims in one and two wrapped up (writer director Leigh Whannel shows up in that bathroom again, Donnie Wahlberg does as well) and the setups for the games of the prior flicks get explained, more or less.<br /><br />Which is dead weight, frankly. The first two \\"Saw\\" movies came in at under two hours, working at a relentless pace (especially \\"Saw 2\\"). Logging two hours and change drags the suspense out and made me wonder why I was being shown the back stories when I really wanted to see just how cinematically the next kill would be rendered. After all, the \\"Saw\\" franchise is a horror show with pain and suffering the real lead actors in a twisted morality play. The twist involving the four leads - and the fact that Jeff is forced to save the victims and not kill them in his Jigsaw game - is the biggest difference and greatest strength in \\"Saw III.\\" But otherwise, there are segments of the movie that are as bloated as the hog carcasses being fed into the film's abattoir scene.shore up the motivational factors, \\"Saw III\\" lays on the flashbacks.

B000BCKFWK|4.0|Exchange the name Velma for Goldie and you'll find yourself looking for Robert Mitchum, Moose Malloy and a lot of easy woman and tough guys.  This is a movie, of four crime stories adapted from Frank Miller's popular comics. It focuses around a muscular brute (Marv played amazingly smooth by Micky Rourke) who's looking for the person responsible for the death of his beloved Goldie.  Marv's fed up with Sin City's corrupt law enforcement, so he takes the law into his own hands.  In his past he has made a horrible mistake killing a cop who risks his life to protect a girl from a deformed pedophile, and a hitman looking to make a little cash.<br /><br />But the story itself is just the icing on the cake and something to wrap around a the days garbage.  The real reason to watch this movie, besides all the great looking woman who some how manage to look just as tough as the men (while walking around naked) is the STYLE.  The constant flow from black and white to partial color (almost always red for blood) and the almost cartoonish mayhem, are what make this a GREAT movie.  Somehow the movie never seems too over the top (ok sometimes it's hanging on Occam's razor) or the acting to be too broad to be campy. It's just great fun to watch all these actors enjoying themselves and playing it staight for laughs.
B00005JP4U|4.0|What was most surprising to me after seeing An Inconvenient Truth was that the movie was not necessarily a movie about the problem of global warming but a movie about Al Gore's slide show presentation and his effort to inform the world. Through the clips of his presentation the overall message is clear, that if we don't change certain things global warming will have a devastating effect on the world. That is a very important issue that I think should be brought to everyone's attention, at the end of the movie they give a website to find out how you can reduce carbon dioxide emissions and such but this is during the credits. An hour into the film I was thinking to myself that so far the movie had only shown how bad the circumstances of global warming will be, not until maybe the last 15 minutes are any solutions offered. This movie has been promoted as a wake up call of sorts to the nation but after watching it I felt more like it was a look at what Al Gore is doing. This personally doesn't bother me, I enjoyed it throughly, however I think many people would be turned away from the movie just because it is so political and not just scientific. There are several instances Vice President Gore jokes about how he was supposed to be president and takes shots at the current administration which unfortunately may turn away some people. I just felt like if this is such an important issue why not make the information available to the largest group of people possible? Instead of running it in limited release where the average person has to seek the movie out why not air it on at least a cable station? <br />Politics aside the movie does what it does very well. It explains about Gore's past and explains why he is so passionate about his cause. The movie does provide lots of eye opening information on what global warming is doing and what may happen but manages to still be light hearted too. At one point when he is showing a graph the line of data went so high that he got on a crane device to reach it which added humor to a serious topic. There was an animated clip shown which I recognized the animation as looking like \\"The Simpson's\\" and found out it actually was from the creator of that show's other series \\"Futurama\\". These type of things kept the film from feeling too serious. Some things were brought up that I think they should have gone more into if they were going to scratch the surface, specifically conspiracy theory type claims that the Bush administration has altered or kept information from the public about global warming. The few things that were shown were convincing and if they are true they deserve a movie about them on their own.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|Depends on what you want from TV, but at the moment, here in the UK we struggle to produce any drama aimed at a teen/young adult audience. It may well have holes in the plot you could drive a bus through but its fun and enjoyable.
031286504X|5.0|Following a worldwide plague, Robert Neville may be the only man left alive. His family is dead. All the surviving humans have been transformed into vampires that surround his house very night in an attempt to break in or entice him out, attack him, and drink his blood. Holed up in his home, which he has converted into a safe house, Robert struggles with his despair and his outsider status, the constant need to seek shelter, food and protection, and the desire to discover the cause and possibly the cure of the plague. A combination of science fiction and horror, I Am Legend is an atmospheric, stark survivalist text with a truly brilliant central concept: the scientific conception and explanation of a vampire. The book is short and difficult to put down, well paced, both intelligent and frightening, and had a huge literary impact on authors in both the sci-fi and horror genres. I highly recommend it, and I consider it one of the most interesting books that I have ever read.<br /><br />This read through of I Am Legend was my first time coming back to it since I read it in high school (now almost four years ago). The story has stayed very fresh in my mind over the intervening years--or, more precisely, the science of Matheson's conception of vampires. Coming back to the text, it is now very obvious to me why those aspects would stick with me so strongly. For the most part, this narrative is a method of conveying Matheson's sci-fi concepts--perhaps like any true SF author, he puts scientific concept ahead of character, and the most important aspect of the characters is not their personality or emotions but rather then impact that the story's scientific concept has on them. In the case of I Am Legend, that concept is a scientific and (mostly) logical explanation for vampires. And it's a wonderful, brilliant concept, more than unique and interesting enough for me to remember it in detail over the years. I still feel like the final development to this sci-fi idea and its repercussions happens too quickly and in limited detail, making the end of the book feel a little too fast--nonetheless, the concept is a great one, and very interesting to read about.<br /><br />The flips side of that situation, however, is that the book lacks characterization and emotion. Those aspects aren't entirely absent by any means. Robert, the protagonist, has a back story, goes through emotional phases, and is greatly impacted by the apocalyptic survival setting that he finds himself in. He's realistically faulted and in many ways admirable. Nonetheless, these personal characteristics and even his interactions, past and present, exist primarily to move towards, expound on, and explain Matheson's scientific point, his conception of the vampires. In some cases, this is obvious: Richard's memories serve to build his character, but they also serve to lead him, and thus the reader, to a better understanding of the vampires. At a mere 160 pages, Matheson could have chosen to give greater emphasis to character--not so that it overwhelmed his SF ideas, but so that it provided a counterbalance to the emphasis on plot and idea found throughout the rest of the book. The lack of realistic and independently meaningful character makes those sections of the book unmemorable and makes the book as a whole a little bit too fast and too simple as a result.<br /><br />Despite these thoughts and critiques, I greatly enjoy this novel and highly recommend it. Matheson achieves an incredible atmosphere in I Am Legend, one of constant paranoia and terror that never grows stale or overblown. His SF concepts are detailed, intelligent, and truly absorbing. The book combines horror and sci-fi in a way that I have never seen anywhere else and find greatly enjoyable to read. I highly recommend the text, and it's a good one to own--although short and easily readable, it's wonderful to come back to and reread. It also makes a great atmospheric yet intelligent horror/Halloween text.<br /><br />I haven't read the additional texts that accompany the 300-page version, and so I can't speak for those.br /> <br />I haven't read the additional texts that accompany the 300-page version, and so I can't speak for those.
B0002DRDBE|4.0|I first saw this shortly after it's release, with a guy I met working in a music store. We loved it and fell about in hysterics - there were so many things that rang true to our jobs, though obvoiusly exaggerated upon for dramatic effect. We rated it as one of the best comedies we'd ever seen. <br /> <br />I now have the DVD. Yes, it's still funny and stands head and shoulders above a lot of the garbage that tries to pass itself off as comedy these days, but is it still 'that' funny? Sadly, I don't think it is. A lot of the fun I gleaned from it on first viewing was in the recognition of situations/dialogues my friend and I had found ourselves in - e.g. an argument with a customer over using our staff-only toilet! Okay, so it isn't the funniest film ever made, so how good is it? Well, nothing really happens by way of plot; there's no 'character development', but then that's no problem; there are some wickedly funny lines/scenarios... but the dialogue is so goddamn awful at times it's beyond belief. No one talks like this. Sometimes it's just so incredibly stilted and over-blown. Okay, it's not a documentary on real life, so it artifcially crafted for specific effects, but even so, some of the lines are so long and awkward, it really does grate, and makes you wonder why they weren't edited long before the camera rolled.  <br /> <br />But that's my only real niggle and hence the loss of one star. This was a cult classic, which deservedly grew. If you haven't seen it and you like your comedy raw, crude, and above all, funny, you must see this. a great little film. <br />
B000FOQ1EA|5.0|Among my touchstones in complete Sibelius symphony sets released so far, I note: (1) Kurt Sanderling and BerlinSO, (2) Colin Davis and BostonSO, (3) Osmo Vanska and LahtiSO.  And of course this set, now newly re-released.  I had just about given up on finding used singles for sale of these CD's, so I am quite happy to grab the set complete.<br /><br />I suppose the marketing department has had a problem with the high excellence of this wonderful set, jostling as it does against a similarly excellent competitor (but maybe a tad more Slavic than Nordic in ethos), that other complete set long available in London/Decca/Universal catalogue, led by Ashkenazy with the Philharmonia of London.  Okay, add that one, too, to my touchstone listings.<br /><br />Like the Carl Nielsen symphonies, also led by Blomstedt with SFSO and published on Decca/London/Universal, these Sibelius performances are destined to wear extremely well as the years go by.  Listening to the series all over again, one is flooded with a cornucopia of gifts and blessing and musical insights, all played technically to the hilt by the band, and exuding a sort of mature, passionate wisdom that I can only equate in recordings with Kurt Sanderling.<br /><br />One of the marvels on offer here is that one hears clearly how Sibelius grows and deepens as one moves through hearing the symphonies played in sequence, one to seven.<br /><br />The first symphony is luscious and dramatic, speaking in the composer's ever-distinctive voice while staying true to his legacy roots in the Late Romantic-Tchaikovsky school of Baltic-Nordic seasons and cycles.  One hears Sibelius' music reaching backwards and forwards at the same time in these interpretations, and the sheer dynamism that is bursting the Late Romantic seams comes aptly near to being limned in sound as a Nordic force of Nature.  It is all here in image and connotation - fjords, icy plateaus, mythology and Nordic folklore.  With something like the mystical display ofthe famous Northern Lights, bleeding out awe in the overpoweringly chilling sky above us while we stand deep in the surrounds of the most thickly forested isolation.  If you occasionally don't want to drink, sing, and tell old tales while you are listening to this set, maybe you have let yourself get too frost-bitten by the dullness of modern life to yield to its considerable magic.<br /><br />Blomstedt's second symphony is reaching wider, higher, and deeper than his first.  Yet Blomstedt inhabits, still, a Late Romantic ethos of manner, gesture, and sung drama.  Every orchestral department is committed and involved, whether pressing out the rich fruits of the lyrical-bardic passages or striding with giant full sounds through the heroic-mythic ones.  The strings can sing and etch, delicately; then mass to gigantic effect, leaving you surmounted by an almost Mahlerian pastoral panic, alone.  The woodwinds are simply brilliant.  The SFSO brass is never blatty, nor dumb - always playing with heft, brassy sheen, and intelligent finesse in all the large and small moments.<br /><br />The tone poem Tapiola and the Valse triste snippet round out the disc.  If anything the Tapiola is even better than the first and second symphonies have been, as the immense intuition that urges Sibelius along grows so fiercely concentrated, so mystically gestural, so intensified - and ever, ever, ever musical.  Tapiola (and probably the other Sibelius tone poems?) is free to fully inhabit that Nordic Sibelian cosmos of Nature and Folkloric awe-rituals, even more unrestrainedly than the symphonies, because sonata narrative forms are startlingly irrelevant.  The gods or goddesses or Ur-forces and beings of sheer Nature can speak to us in the Blomstedt approach to Tapiola.  The stretto strings will set the hairs on the back of your neck standing, if you let them.  One immediately finishes hearing Tapiola by returning to regular audience consciousness, lamenting the lack of the remaining tone poems, recorded under Blomstedt with SFSO.<br /><br />The third symphony moves us into further regions of the composer's openness to musical change.  Sibelius allegedly told us at the time: Classicism is the next wave of the musical future.  Then he wrote this third symphony to follow that muse.  Blomstedt lets SFSO play it, poised, balanced - sensuous and passionate - deceptively, simply self-possessed.<br /><br />The fourth symphony under Blomstedt simply goes right over the sheer cliffs of western rational narrative in music, plunging wildly and big-heartedly into the abyss.  One imagines this is just the sort of music Schoenberg wished he could write when he was doing Gurrelieder as a young man.  Instead of Wagernian twilight and love-death negation, the symphony finds another sort of unsuspected pilgrimage and affirmation, quite beyond the clarity and poise and heartiness of the third.  Blomstedt encourages the band to stay committed, and the playing is simply wild and marvelous.  Are these really the same players who gave us such a clean and clear third symphony?  Yes, but their service to the composer's vision transforms them, and probably this fourth symphony will transform its listeners.<br /><br />After this fourth, the next three symphonies are incredible.  Farther, farther, farther.  Yes, this fifth stands out as all good recorded iterations must.  Its Nordic hero has suffered the pangs and irrational mysteries of the fourth, without having reason, heart, or daring undone by the encounter with our natural and cosmic abyss.  This fifth symphony is in love, then, with all of life and all of nature.  Rational, irrational, all.  The final movement triumph of its famous, swinging horn theme sweeps all before it.  Humanity has discovered love yet again, and as Teilhard de Chardin whispered to us, thus does humanity again discover fire.  The sixth and seventh symphonies are further incursions into these typically Sibelian, explicable realms.  Their wholeness conjures and deepens and affirms all that has musically gone before, always bearing us freshly into the musical means at hand, and at the same time, bearing us further and further away from linear western musical sonata-form narratives into Something Other, Somewhere Else.<br /><br />Wow.  Give stars. Get this set.  Beauty + Force.  Nuff said
B000IOM0YM|5.0|We really have Led Zeppelin to thank for this package. It was the successful sales of their brilliant 2 disc DVD that woke Gene & Paul to release their version ... thank you Jimmy Page. Like the Zep set it goes right into the shows without going into the menu first. <br /> <br />With that said, I have the set and its true there are three versions. <br />Luckily I have the 'other version' not available at Best Buy or Walmart that features the '77 MSG footage that runs 27 mins - its a taste and all three versions feature a short disc. Its the best of the three sets because the show is one of the most energetic performances Ive seen of the band, I too have all of the bootlegs and have seen them all. <br />Theres also a great goof on Ace's part here where he forgets the solo on Shout it out loud. One of the only times he flubbed his lines. <br /> <br />Its a great set and about time this material was released officially. <br />I do have my reservations about it though. Being a fan since the 70's my opinion counts here 'people'. I wish they included the '76 Annaheim show, one of the best filmed, Im sure many of you have seen it. Im sorry to have to say that some of the video used isnt as good as some of the boots I have. They could have used better source material for the In Concert footage. The famous B&W Winterland footage isnt cleaned up. The Paul Lynde show is incomplete ... no Beth or Detroit. I wish they had picked the first night of Cobo Hall '76 and the first '77 Summit show, they were better performances. But there are the really good moments: Budokan and Houston look fantastic these are from near perfect video sources and are worth the purchase alone. Plus the British short So It Goes is a rare piece. Also the sound makes up for some of the lack of good video. 5.1, 2.0 and Gene & Paul commentary. <br /> <br />Overall a necessity to any KISS collection for the die hards like myself thats why I give it the 5 star treatment. But dont toss out your old video tapesyou're going to want them especially since this set is incompete. I look forward to Vol 2. and hope there is a Dynasty era show.
0307346609|5.0|Stephen King's \\"The Stand\\" - that masterfully crafted thriller of suspense and terror made special by King's unique grasp of human nature and attention to detail - has set the standard for apocalypse fiction.  Up until now, that is.<br /><br />Max Brooks' \\"World War Z\\" adds an entirely new dimension to horror fiction in this cleverly crafted, deviously irresistible and, um, \\"tasty\\" tale of zombies and survivors.  As the story goes, Brooks, originally commissioned by the UN to chronicle the aftermath of the decade-long \\"Zombie Wars\\", sets out to write his own tale - the \\"human factor\\" in contrast to dull facts and statistics the UN was looking for.  Written in the style of a documentary through Brooks' interviews, it is told in the words of survivors across all walks of life in all countries and cultures.<br /><br />But the appeal of \\"WWZ\\" runs much, much deeper than standard zombie horror fare.  Sure, there is the obligatory gore and gross-out violence - in fact Brooks' takes bloody havoc to entirely new levels placing Zombie's not just on the earth, but beneath it, above it, and in the water.  What sets this apart is Brooks' brilliant dissection of human nature - mostly the dark side of human nature - as he skewers the politics, mores, economics, societies, greed - and some goodness - that makes the world turn.  Though this is fiction and pure high adrenaline entertainment, there are warnings and wisdoms on every page.  Brooks keenly understands the depths man will plumb when faced with unmitigated disaster and terror, and some new heights as well.<br /><br />Despite the horror genre, this is an intelligent and thoughtful novel - one that should enjoy wide appeal.  Don't wait - buy the hard cover - and don't be surprised to see a rush of knockoffs trying to recreate the magic Brooks has captured.

B000E0WJIC|3.0|To start off: these dudes can play.  The musicianship is not on par with Between the Buried and Me or Dillinger Escape Plan, but every member is extremely versed at playing music. <br /> <br />That being said, it appears that technical ability is really the only thing these guys have going for them.  Don't get me wrong, they can write a catchy chorus in nearly every song but they are certainly bringing nothing new to the metalcore table.  The song structures are all homogenous (verse, chorus, solo, breakdown etc...) and after about the fourth track, the listener is bored.  However, the first four tracks did impress me and I still find them readily listenable, but the lack of variability on the album caused me to find it mediocre.  The largest complaint I have with \\"The Poison\\" deals with the lyrics.  Simply put, they are God awful.  You couldn't find words more devoid of any substance in a middle school english class or a livejournal entry.  I would have enjoyed this album much more had I not read the booklet so if you buy it, spare yourself the pain.   <br /> <br />Metalcore is a genre that has come under fire as of late for it's attempt at mass appeal.  Bullet for My Valentine seem to be doing just that: riding a wave of popularity that will send their album into the hands of the myspace generation and frequenters of Hot Topic.  There's nothing bad about this album (save for the lyrics) but if you want originality, go elsewhere.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|First of all let me say that I loved the series and the movie. My girlfriend and I lent \\"Firefly\\" to our classic old school conga teacher and he just loved it too:  \\"Man, I was addicted\\" he said.  Yup he had all the symptoms: staying up til 4 am, eager anticipation of viewing time, feelings of withdrawl after it was over. <br /> <br />There's 2700 odd reviews behind this one that tell you why this is such a truly excellent series.  So I thought I'd do something a bit different.  A small minority of people have said that they prefer Battle Star Galactica to Firefly, and while I am a big fan of BSG, I'd have to say that there's really no comparison.  It's kind of like trying to compare \\"Homicide\\" and \\"Hill Street Blues\\"  (yeah, I know that dates me):  These are two completely different shows that happen to be in the same genre, and which both have intelligent scripts, top-notch acting and a distinctive milieu. <br /> <br />BSG is in many ways, the more standard sci-fi show (and there's nothing wrong with that, OK?):  it has all the classic ingredients of what used to be called \\"space opera\\":  fleets of ships, giant space battles, shiny aliens, rippling pectoral muscles and heaving bosoms.  It also has a very post 9-11 sensibility:  fear of the unknown, ever-lurking danger, enemies among us, plus the added touch of religious fanaticism from (at least) the Cylons. <br /> <br />BSG is also the most sophisticated (and human) version of the military procedural (think JAG, SG-1, the Unit, NCIS etc). One of the reasons it stands head and shoulders above these other versions of the genre is that the scripts allow for a certain 3-d humanity to emerge from behind the acronyms and drum rolls.  That said, you can't really allow for much character development when you have a cast of thousands (Starbuck being the obvious exception), and when the platform itself (that's the spaceship for those of you who don't speak techie) hulks so massively over the show. <br /> <br />Firefly operates on a much more intimate scale (not so true of \\"Serenity\\" of course, but even there, the best parts of the movie were interactions between two or three characters).  Where a good 50 % of BSG is about \\"the ship\\" and \\"the fleet\\", Mal and company are free to deal with each other as individuals.  In that sense, it's much more of a dramatic ensemble peice (e.g. \\"Waiting for Godot\\") , while BSG is more like a big Broadway show (\\"Cabaret\\" perhaps - I was going to say \\"Phantom\\" but that might have been interpreted as an insult).   Working on an intimate scale allows us to get to grips with the characters in a way that is almost impossible to do in BSG.  Mal is not a commander, so he doesn't have to hide behind a commander's mask the way Adama does.  He's free to indulge in his nasty side and he does, he's free to act on his emotions towards others, and he does.   <br /> <br />The relationships between the characters are the most important aspect of Firefly whereas they're secondary to the plot in BSG.  In 3 episodes, I learned more about Zoe and her relationship to Mal than I've been able to get from watching two whole series' worth of interaction between Adama and Tigh.   <br /> <br />That's not to say that the gear isn't important in Firefly: The spaceship Serenity is a character in both the series and the movie, and the wonderful 'exteriors' in the episode \\"Objects in Space\\" are every bit as effective as the Cylon attacks in the first series of BSG in giving us a sense of the cold dark of space. <br /> <br />By the way, since we're talking about \\"Objects in Space\\" I must register my vote for this ep. as the best in the series, not least because of the phenomenal acting job done by Richard Brooks as the bounty hunter Jubal Early. <br /> <br />What both shows share is a fantastic sense of place and atmosphere.  BSG reminds one of \\"Aliens\\" and \\"Das Boot\\" along with a healthy dose of \\"X-files\\".  Firefly on the other hand is more reminiscent of the best parts of \\"Deadwood\\" and interior of the Nebuchadnezzer on \\"The Matrix\\" mixed together. <br /> <br />To sum up, I think you watch these two series for different things: in Firefly, the plots and special effects are secondary to the characters; in BSG, the characters are secondary to the plot.  If you don't understand this, you end up getting into the useless task of comparing apples to oranges.  Fortunately for most of us, you can have both without getting all worked up about it. <br />

B00005JN8Z|5.0|Many on this site have commented on the mystery of why certain sure fire hits have been unjustly neglected when it comes to DVD release.  William Wyler's \\"The Heiress\\" is a prime example, what with the added bonus of Olivia De Haviland's still being alive and probably available for commentary on her Oscar winning role.  Even more to the point, the marvelous \\"Quo Vadis,\\" perhaps the best spectacle film post WW2 Hollywood has so far made , languishes somewhere in vaults while third rate epics get almost weekly releases in regular and then special editions. <br />\\"Quo Vadis\\" is marked by amazing, pre-digital (i.e. REAL) crowd scenes amid gigantic sets, and these still take the breath away.  What is even more distinctive, though, is the dialogue given to two of the supporting characters, Nero and Petronius. Peter Ustinov as the nutty emperor and Leo Genn as his arbiter of elegance, both Oscar nominees for their work in these roles, in equal measure steal the picture. They are so witty and enjoyable, they're enough to make one overlook the largely wooden acting of Robert Taylor or the familiar near-hysterical virgin's intonations of the pre-\\"From Here To Eternity\\" Deborah Kerr.  <br />All in all, this film deserves at least one competent DVD release before another commemorative version of something like \\"Gladiator: 5th Anniversary\\" appears.

B000E33VWW|4.0|`Capote' follows a slow but unstoppable process of how writing one book can ultimately affect the life of its author who does not hesitate to manipulate people around him in order to know what he has to know. The film, which begins with the horrible murders of one family in Kansas, 1959, quietly presents its subject matter when Truman Capote (Philip Seymour Hoffman perfectly in character) starts to research the killings with his then assistant Harper Lee (Catherine Keener, completely different turn from Trish in 'The 40 Year Old Virgin'). <br /> <br />You will immediately notice that Capote in this film is not only a doggedly resolute researcher who does not scruple to lie before Perry Smith, one of the killers who were later arrested - this writer is also a great conversationalist, who can easily obtain the trust of Sheriff Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper) and even Perry himself. It is amazing to see his art of conversation, or I should say, his monologue because after all Capote does not take no for answer, and whatever he says, the listeners would listen anyway.  <br /> <br />[IN COLD BLOOD] And Capote finishes writing a book `In Cold Blood' a masterpiece that cements his fame in the history of literature only after paying a price, which turns out bigger than he had imagined. Maybe the film implies that `In Cold Blood' means in fact not just about the heinous murders in Kansas themselves, but about something else, something that the author of the book had to have while creating this seminal work.  <br /> <br />The film is not an easy watch for some. It sometimes doesn't move fast, and the main character is not a `good man' (whatever the definition of it) that you are ready to relate to. If you ask me whether or not the film is an epoch-making one, like the book real Capote wrote, I have to say I am not sure. It is well-acted, beautifully-photographed, and intelligent, but slow-moving and understated. But perhaps that is the point.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|I have read a number of reviews that bemoan the fact that the Black Parade disappoints MCR fans who have followed them since the beginning.  As one of those fans, The Black Parade was an astounding revelation for the band.  Drawing from older influences, classic rock influences, MCR grew up.  When reviewers talk about how a song sounds like another newer band's work, they too are drawing from older influences as well.  MCR is not trying to rip off the White Stripes or the Jets.  MCR is drawing from the deep well of rock and roll as all good musicians do.  However, drawing from the well does not mean drowning in it.  MCR takes the influences and turns them into something that is uniquely them.  They never forget what their message is and has always been.  Anthems for disenfranchised.  Anthems of those with pain.  MCR knows exactly who they are.  As they mature, so do their fans.  They grow musically and they want you to join the black parade.
B00005JPAF|5.0|Critics have been busy comparing \\"The Departed,\\" Martin Scorsese's superb new crime drama, with his earlier movies, particularly \\"GoodFellas.\\" Personally, I think a more interesting point of comparison is with \\"Mystic River,\\" Clint Eastwood's Oscar-winning drama of a few years ago, which like \\"The Departed\\" is set among Irish cops and mobsters in South Boston. Scorsese's film is more kinetic, Eastwood's more deliberative; Scorsese gives us a little taste of vicarious revenge at the end, whereas Eastwood leaves our guts ripped out by a monstrous, unavenged injustice. (As a general rule, Scorsese believes that what goes around comes around; Eastwood believes that violence begets violence, which is not the same thing at all.) After watching both movies, however, you'd be justified in thinking that being an Irishman from Southie is the harshest and most inexorable of fates. Certainly Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), both born under the shadow of mob kingpin Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), had little choice in their circumstances. But, as Scorsese shows us, it's the choices they make as grown men that make all the difference. In William Monahan's brilliant screenplay (based on the Hong Kong-made thriller \\"Infernal Affairs\\"), Costigan is recruited straight out of the academy by fatherly Capt. Queenan (Martin Sheen) and feral Sgt. Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) to cop to a trumped-up charge of assault, go to jail, pretend to lose his badge, and infiltrate Costello's gang as one of his leg-breakers. What Queenan and Dignam don't know, however, is that Costello has bred Sullivan from childhood to go through the police academy, become a detective with an impeccable service record, and serve as Costello's mole in the Boston PD. From there the story becomes a wildly compelling rollercoaster ride, filled with multiple double-crosses, frequent savage violence, and at the end a body count rivaling any Elizabethan revenge tragedy. What keeps it from being unbearably depressing is the brilliant if highly profane dialogue; Scorsese's usual brilliant technique, almost arrogant in its perfect mastery of varying styles, aided superbly by photographer Michael Ballhaus and editor Thelma Schoonmaker; and the extraordinary ensemble cast, truly one of the finest assembled for any movie in the past decade. There are welcome, if shocking, flashes of humor, thanks largely to Nicholson, the greatest living expert in gleeful screen sadism. (To see Nicholson's Costello delicately remove the gold wedding ring from a severed hand is to learn a whole new definition of the word \\"aplomb.\\") Nicholson and DiCaprio, his gaze so intense that it almost melts the celluloid, dominate the film, but one must also acknowledge the excellent contributions of Damon (more hissable even than in \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\"), Sheen, Wahlberg, Ray Winstone as Nicholson's right-hand man, Alec Baldwin as Damon's clueless superior in the PD, and Vera Farmiga as the police psychiatrist who falls for both Damon and DiCaprio. Don't expect to feel happy after you've seen this movie, and don't expect every loose end to be tied. But do expect to leave the theater exhilarated at having seen the most satisfying movie in years by one of the world's greatest filmmakers.g unbearably depressing is the brilliant if highly profane dialogue; Scorsese's usual brilliant technique, almost arrogant in its perfect mastery of varying styles, aided superbly by photographer Michael Ballhaus and editor Thelma Schoonmaker; and the extraordinary ensemble cast, truly one of the finest assembled for any movie in the past decade.

630463949X|5.0|Wow !!!! <br /> <br />What a flawless performance of material that in some cases was decades old. <br /> <br />Most, if not all of the members of Fleetwood Mac were over 50 at the time of this performance. <br /> <br />That makes it even more amazing than it was because the heart of their work occured over 20 years before and was so emotionally charged, yet it did not seem the slightest bit \\"staged\\" all this time later. <br /> <br />The band was flawless in this virtuoso performance on almost every song but especially \\"Dreams\\", \\"I'm So Afraid.....amazing showstopper\\" and others like \\"Gypsy\\" and \\"Go Your Own Way\\". <br /> <br />Really I feel like I am being dismissive of the other performances, because they were literally ALL great. <br /> <br />This was a chance for a special, once in a lifetime band to flex their creative muscles and they did it with brute strength and tremendous confidence. <br /> <br />A TRIUMPHANT occasion for Fleetwood Mac. <br /> <br />10 STARS !!!!!!!!! <br /> <br />I watch it as much now as I did almost a decade ago when it came out. <br /> <br />I think I will watch it forever. <br /> <br />Otherwise, I would be short changing myself. <br /> <br />It is pure bliss every time. <br /> <br />Timeless, Classic, Essential.......AWE INSPIRING !!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br />I have run out of superlatives.
B00005JPBJ|2.0|I just saw this movie yesterday, and I can't really believe that everybody loved it. They took their great movies part one and two, and went way over their heads with the third. They completely ruined it in my opinion. Why does this always happen? I loved the first two, and expected alot from the third ,but ended up very dissapointed.
B000FUF6QS|5.0|Forget the recent remake starring Nicolas Cage, this is the real deal.  The classic, original Wicker Man today remains a stirring, frightening, hypnotic tale that still manages to deliver the shocks thirty years later.  Edward Woodward plays police inspector Howie, an idealic, Christian who is lead to the mysterious island town of Sumerisle where a young girl has disappeared and is apparently dead.  His investigations reveal a pagan cult with sinister intentions for the outsider, culminating in one of the most unforgettable climaxes in all of cinema.  Everything about Robin Hardy's masterpiece stands out on it's own: the hypnotic music and seductive yet eerie atmosphere, helped by Britt Ecklund's naked night time dance and the great Christopher Lee's superb performance as the Lord of the land.  As said before, forget the terrible, watered down remake, this Wicker Man is the real deal.
0743298020|3.0|I did not enjoy this book.  The characters where so bazaar that it was difficult to relate to any of them. The beginning was so slow that I started skimming through the paragraphs.  I have a rule that if I don't like a book after 50 pages then I stop reading.  However, the mysteries surrounding the story had me so in intrigued that every time I put the book down \\"for good\\" I would find my self picking it back up just to see how it all turned out.  I am glad I finished it but I probably won't recommend it to any of friends.
B00074CBMY|4.0|Joe Cocker's appeal has always lain in his poetic ability to dredge up and transmute the tragedy of loss and loneliness into powerful and beautiful dirges, and in the stark contrast between his ragged croak of a voice and a lush background of female vocals, wailing guitars, and slick orchestration. Listening to his songs, one feels as if someone has photographed the grittiest scene of urban despair -- a homeless addict contemplating suicide, perhaps -- and placed it in an ornate frame in a high-class gallery.<br /><br />This CD contains all of the elements that have made Cocker so popular, and his selection of classic and contemporary songs is superb. A couple of the tracks may be a bit less successful than the rest, but all of them are heartfelt and soulful. While not as sublime as his albums of the late 60s and early 70s, this recording is far superior to some of the CDs he released in the late 90s and early 00s. It marks a clear return to form for the master of misery.
6304698798|3.0|We all know about \\"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\\".  It is part of our collected consciousness. It's almost required watching for the \\"guy movie\\" genre, along with Magnificent Seven, Dirty Dozen, and Ocean's Eleven (pick your version). <br /> <br />If you've never watched it, and wanted to buy it, DO NOT BUY this version!!!!  There is NO menu screen.  It goes straight to the movie with no chapter breakdowns.  Run another DVD search for this film and select the white background package. It's a 2 disc set, and well worth it.  I only got this version, because I was being a cheapskate and bought the Man with No Name Trilogy Boxed Set.  The first two films have chapters and a menu, but the GBU did not. Why? I do not know.  <br /> <br />So heed my advice, and spare yourself the dissapointment.
0131103628|5.0|I've used several programming books to teach me languages.  First it was the \\"Learning Perl\\" and \\"Programming Perl\\" books from O'Reilly.  Then we had \\"C++: How to Program\\", from Deitel and Deitel.  But none of those can come close to this book.<br /><br />K&R manages to teach an entire programming language in but a few lessons.  As they say, C is a small language: it doesn't need a 1000 page book!  Short, easy-to-understand, and right to the point, this books teaches the syntax of C, the usage of C, common paradigms of C, and so on.  Possibly confusing practices ( while((int c = getchar()) != EOF) ) are well-explained, and you come away with a fantastic foundation of this language.<br /><br />The exercise are fantastic, and some are quite difficult, forcing you to think and apply yourself.  My one complaint is that solutions are not provided, but these are easily found online.<br /><br />Even once you've read this book, it can be a fantastic reference.  There are tomes out there dedicated to C reference, those may be better for, say, writing a kernel.  But for most people, this book works fantastically.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book enough for learning C.
B000002U82|5.0|What can be said that hasn't been said about this masterpiece? It is damn near beyond criticism, and those that find fault with it are often nit-picking or trying to be non-conformist by degrading such masterful art. This is one of those albums that truly inspired me as a musician and listener by showing me the possibilities of what could be done on record with commercial succes. Such a dark, atmospheric, experimental, and progressive work is not what one expect to be among history's top-sellers, but such brilliance is also hard to overlook... plus it doesn't hurt that plenty who miss out on the brilliance enjoy being stoned to the album... This album truly haunts its listeners and is like nothing else... your first listen will truly leave you stunned. I remember the first time i listened to it, about 7 years ago now, I ended up listening to it about 9 times in a row, in disbelief; I wasn't doing drugs and never have either!. 7 years later, relistens are still rewarding and at least once a year, it spends a few weeks in my disc changer. The lyrics, mood, and music are incredible. Perhaps the most incredible thing is the progress Floyd has made, this is the album where a great band becomes a legend and where an excellent guitarist (David Gilmour) becomes a guitar god and one of the top 5 of all time. Every note that Gilmour plays on this album (as with Wish You Were Here and the Wall) is pure genius. THere are faster players and more technical ones, but few that make every note count the way he does. You want proof? Listen to the brilliant, gut-wrenching solo on \\"Time\\" that could stand as a composition on its own! It's impossible to pick a best Floyd album, well for me it is at least, but this is where the best elements of the band begin to really come together and produce masterful and unforgettable music. Floyd, who is often referred to as \\"Space Rock,\\" truly takes you to the moon on this one... to it's \\"Dark Side\\" and beyond!
0307341542|5.0|i am a long-time Entertainment Weekly subscriber and when i picked up this book i thought it was funny that stephen king had written the blurb on the back praising the novel - he, like the author, is a writer for the magazine so i'm sure the editors for the book didn't have to look far to get a big-name \\"critic\\" to evaluate the story.  <br /> <br />more importantly i think that gillian flynn didn't need king's review to get me to read this book. i have always enjoyed her columns in EW and was looking forward to seeing how she handled her first novel.  <br /> <br />i could not put this book down and i read a lot - this is almost a perfect story from beginning to end. it's hard to explain too much without giving the best parts away but it is framed as a coming-home story of a journalist - sent back to her hometown to cover the story of two murders. of course there is a strained relationship with her mother and the usual \\"back in town\\" jitters but that is about all that is formulaic of flynn's story.  <br /> <br />the mysteries wrap up well but flynn doesn't solve every single issue and i love that in a book - at the end the characters still have some mystery themselves and haven't been explained into boredom. i closed the book wondering what would happen to camille and the rest. <br /> <br />
B000301YY8|5.0|I really like \\"you're beautiful\\" song, but for some reason it was not enough for me to buy this CD. The other day I heard \\"goodbye my lover\\" and that was it. I got the CD and I was very, very pleased with that. Absolutely beautiful. Each song is different,very original, very unique. I have few favourites, but overall the whole CD is just amazing. Thank you James Blunt for giving us this joy. This is one of these CDs that you play from beginning to the end.
B00008WT5E|4.0|POWERAGE isn't what you'd expect after LET THERE BE ROCK. If I had bought this new after buying LET THERE BE ROCK the year before I might have been disappointed at first. The first three songs are blusier than anything from LET THERE BE ROCK, and the band just doesn't seem as inspired as on their previous disc. I'm not saying the songs are bad, just not high energy sounding. The band seems to be going through the motions on the first three songs. But then we get to RIFF RAFF, it's like the band suddenly woke up. They could have left the vocals off RIFF RAFF and it would still be great. RIFF RAFF has a really high tempo riff that you never get tired of hearing, the vocals are buried behind the guitars,which is fine, they're not really needed here anyway. After that we get to SIN CITY, which is probably the best song on the disc. SIN CITY is as good as anything the band has ever done. It's as much a classic as T.N.T..After that we get WHAT'S NEXT TO THE MOON, which is kind of a laid back song that keeps getting better the more I listen to it. GONE SHOOTIN' is almost a ballad for AC/DC. It's a great, laid back song that stays in your head for days. UP TO MY NECK IN YOU is much a faster tempo than the previous three songs, and the band seems more inspired. Definitely an underrated gem. The disc ends with KICKED IN THE TEETH, which starts out with Bon yelling, and then angus' guitar, then rest of the band, then Bon yelling again,then Angus, then the rest of the band kick in for the remainder of the song. Bon does a HAH thing right before the band kicks into high gear that reminds me of James Brown. Pretty good song. Overall a pretty good AC/DC disc.
B000002UA0|5.0|As were most fans of Floyd, I was saddened by Syd's recent passing, though I know that he had been long gone for years. Piper at the Gates of Dawn offers some of the best evidence as to why Syd has always been so revered, why his descent into insanity was such a loss to the music world (though it did inspire some legendary future-Floyd classics... who could imagine the world of music without David Gilmour... or who would want to?), and why he will live on forever despite his passing. Piper is one of the greatest achievements of psychedylic pop/rock and remains one of rock's most inventive and original albums. Having derived its name from the Wind and the Willows ( a whimsical children's fantasy tale), it is not surprising that it is an album full of... well whimsy. THe imagery of the lyrics is reminiscent of Lewis Caroll (author of Alice and Wonderland). The music can be jovial, dark, or plain frightening. The possibilities of sound are explored, especially sounds that can be coaxed out of a guitar. Syd was no virtuoso, and far from the heroics that would later make David Gilmour such an indispensable part of the guitar cannon, but he was certainly one of the instruments most unique artists (for evidence, check out Astromy Domine and Instellar Stellar Overdrive which sounds like demented circus music!) To fans of the classic Floyd line-up, this album will be of interest as Syd's descent into insanity is a theme of much of the later work, but it's value as a piece of art is due to Syd's brilliance and thus even if the group had never recorded another note, this album would merit a place in the pantheon of great albums. RIP Syd!
B00005JPAM|4.0|I can clearly recall that Saturday night in 1997 when I first heard that Princess Diana had been killed. Strangely her death hit me pretty hard as if she were a part of my immediate circle of family and friends.<br /><br />What had Diana meant to me and to millions around the world? And why did we all take her death so personally?<br /><br />Stephan Frears' \\"The Queen\\" doesn't deal with these Diana questions much but her death is the engine that pulls this film along to its inevitable conclusion. What he does deal with is Queen Elizabeth's (a perfectly stiff-upper lipped Helen Mirren...a performance without irony and definitely one of respect) reaction, or more to the point, non-reaction to Diana's death.<br /><br />Frears, best known for edgy dramas as in the terrific \\"The Grifters\\" and \\"My Beautiful Launderette\\" directs here with restraint and reverence which in most cases would translate to stodgy and dull. But Frears, ever the consummate artist treats the material with panache, taking advantage of the political, social and emotional nature of this situation to elevate the material to drama, riveting drama<br /><br /> In 1997, Tony Blair (a dull, odd, Michael Sheen) had just been elected on a platform of change and modernism and meets with a wall that is the implacable Queen and the Royal family who are intent on adhering to tradition which meant that Diana, as no longer a member of the royal family, would not deserve a State funeral. But the English people, who loved Diana as well as People from all over the world persuaded, along with Tony Blair, Queen Elizabeth to change her mind.<br /><br />\\"The Queen\\" is very well made and generally well acted though Alex Jennings who plays Prince Charles seems to be in a constant state of indecision and confusion and who perpetually seems to be smelling poop.<br /><br />It's been 9 years since that August night in Paris but if anything Diana's fame is bigger now than ever. \\"The Queen\\" does nothing to diminish Diana's fame and of course, she will always remain young and beautiful in our eyes and memories. What \\"The Queen\\" does though is to buff up the tarnished reputation of the English Monarchy by making them as human-like as any film has ever done. And that is not an easy task to perform.remain young and beautiful in our eyes and memories.

0743270754|5.0|I purchased this book with every intention of reading it but after almost a year I had not gotten to it.  Fortunately I was able to get the entire work in an unabridged version on audio cassette.  The subject covered was one that was hardly new to me.  However, Goodwin takes a unique and fascinating perspective that allows the reader or listener to actually feel that they are a part of history.  For those who don't have time to read, consider the audio version. It's well worth the listen.
B00003BDXG|5.0|Those of you who dislike this movie have done exactly what was hoped for... extreme reactions, either positive or negative, to extreme filmmaking. <br /> <br />Genius.  Ties with Gone With The Wind as my top film of all time.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|Based on some other reviews, I expected this CD to be inferior to Fallen.  However, I love every song.  I have been playing it every day since I received it.  I look forward to the next CD.
B000I2J5UG|5.0|I have all three of their albums.  I must say that each is better than the first!   I have my favorites like \\"headfirst for halos\\", \\"Helena\\", \\"thank you for the venom\\", \\"WELCOME TO THE BLACK PARADE\\", \\"DISENCHANTED\\", ALONG WITH MANY OTHERS.  Like i said earlier, the black parade music video got me curious.  I was intrigued with the direction that the band was going.  Upon the much anticapated release of the album on my part, i started to listen to it.  I was in awe.  This album has been compared with the wall from pink floyd, I have to agree that it is one of the greats.  This band has exceeded my expectations.  I love this band.  They are my favorite.  The one word to describe this album is amazing.  Absolutely amazing.  Any one who thinks otherwise sucks.
0895260131|5.0|With so much political correctness in the world today it is a breath of freesh air to get the truth about a subject. The murderous religion of Islam is uncovered. Anyone who disagrees or makes a comment that does not support Islam or it's founder is labled an infidel and could be subject to death. This is a religion of peace? Thank God brave men had the courage to try and defeat this evil religion during the Crusades. If it were not for them we would all be under the tyrannical rule of some type of Sultan where freedom of religion, or for that matter freedom itself, does not truly exist. We must never forget 9/11 or the evil people who would behead live people and video tape it for the world to see.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|When I first heard My Chemical Romance's single for \\"The Black Parade\\", and heard the band saying things like this was so different it was their 'alter-ego', I was quite skeptical. I had come to know the Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge My Chem, and the I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love My Chem, and wasn't looking forward in the least bit to a band that was traveling back down the old pathways of David Bowie and The Beatles.     But, I still bought the CD the day it was released, being a true fan.     And I was not disappointed in the least bit.     The disc opens up with an acoustic rock song [The End.](and demonstrates the RIGHT way to rock out on an acoustic guitar), that segways perfectly into a flat line, and the next song Dead!. The song is very bouncy and adorned with the classic morbid lyrics and harmonies My Chemical Romance is famous for, and not to mention trumpets adding to a fuller sound, and Ray Toro's famous guitar solos.     The next song is classic My Chem, complete with minor chord arrangements and fabulously dark and deathly references. A choir can be heard behind Ray's solo during the break down.     `The Sharpest Lives' is a perfect combination of TCFSR and IBYMB, YBMYL, and reminds us that they still are the same guys.     The title track opens with a simple piano, layering with each passing second with Gerard's vocals, Bob's marching-band-like drumbeat, xylophones, and Ray and Frank's guitars. It then kicks it up a notch and goes into a driving, melancholy anthem that would make Green Day proud.     Following, is a short but sweet ballad entitled `I Don't Love You', with lyrics that seem to be lifted right from a Audrey Hepburn film.     The song `House of Wolves' is very jazzy and has a awesome bass line thanks to Mike Way, and riveting lead guitar.     The following song is the most realistic song, and gut-wrenching, song that My Chem has written to date, being about cancer, and what the patients experience going through the process. It is simply piano, but eerie and beautiful.     The middle-eastern vibe runs though the song `Mama', which appears to have been written for some Broadway rock-opera show. It also has a guest appearance from the cabernet diva herself, Lisa Minnelli, and Frank Iero and Gerard and Mikey Way's mothers.     The track `Sleep' in next in line, originally intended to be the last track. Although it is not an album highlight, it is still a well-crafted song.   `Teenagers' is a 70's punk song based on today's culture which made me laugh hysterically upon hearing the truthful lyrics.     The rock-ballad `Disenchanted' is the most memorable song that I have heard in a long time. Although the melody reminded me of the George Michael song `Last Christmas' when I heard the bootlegged demo, the album version has proven itself to be a classic song that could possibly be on the soundtrack to many, many teen-angst ridden movies.     The last song on the album, `Famous Last Words', is a favorite of many of the band members. It a classic anthem, complete with a catchy and enlightening chorus and memorable bridge, pounding drums and fat bass, and guitars that seem to be singing themselves.     ******I have read multiple other reviews on Amazon, and have to say that I sadly disagree with many of the upset people of today's society. Music today seems to be at a standstill, with labels pumping out cookie-cutter emo bands left and right (I am restraining my self from listing the recycled, generic bands). They are reusing and sharing each other's ideas, with is good, in a sense, but is not going to make any progress musically what so ever. My Chemical Romance has decided to raise the bar and expand rock in a new way. When they created this album, they created the next chapter in the Book of Rock. Although they may have taken a step back in time with their style, they have taken a step forward in music. And that alone has made all the difference.******
B000EDWKXI|4.0|In general, this is a good movie,good actors,but the cover or poster is ugly.I hadn't watched the movie,because the cover didn't invite me to watch it..I don't know  if in that time they had sunglasses,maybe or maybe not. Good movie, have to watch.
B0000DERM4|1.0|This is a great film, but do yourself a favor and buy the DVD version of this - the content and quality is superior.
B0006J28KU|5.0|Though it's a bit tough to get to in one sitting (it's 172 minutes), Michael Mann's 1995 crime drama masterpiece \\"Heat\\" is ultimately one of the most satisfying film experiences one can enjoy. Starring two of the greatest actors in history (Al Pacino & Robert De Niro) sharing the screen together for the first time ever, backed by a great story and an equally fantastic supporting cast, \\"Heat\\" has been one of the last truly great movies to come out in the last 10 or so years, and it's truly a classic.<br /><br />Most reviewers have already gone into plot details, so I'll leave that this two disc special edition is the one to get. It's loaded with special features and has great picture and sound quality. A must-have.
B000GG4XHO|4.0|The sound on this is great, especially when played on speakers that have clear highs.  The three new bonus tracks are a great addition, and show what a different record this would have been if the original sessions had panned out.  My only complaint is the choice to include the three songs from the box set.  Yes, they sound sharper here, but I would have preferred three more unreleased outtakes or live tracks.  What about the early version of \\"I Wanna Be Black\\" or \\"You Can Dance\\" (at least one live soundboard or multitrack of this exists on bootleg)?  Or how about the harrowing live version of \\"Kicks\\" from the 1976 Roxy show that \\"Heroin\\" on the box set is taken from? <br /> <br />Complaints aside, the treatment of the original album is great and worth the price alone.  Maybe we can cross our fingers and hope that other material is being held back for a rarities box set in the future.  We can only hope, right?
B00062IVKS|5.0|Voted best film of the 1980s', Martin Scorsese's 1980 boxing tour de force \\"Raging Bull\\" is indeed one of the best movies ever made. Covering the life of famed boxer Jake La Motta (portrayed by Robert De Niro, whose physical transformation throughout the movie is as impressive as his performance, which is a contender for his best). Spanning 25 years through Jake's life, we see his rise and fall well documented. We see his struggle to keep his title, to stay fit, to maintain a solid family life as well as his relationship to his brother Joey (Joe Pesci). This is what true filmmamking is all about.<br /><br />The two disc special edition dvd is excellent, and I recommend this movie to all major film buffs, as it is a must have.
630522577X|4.0|I have always loved this movie and I am thrilled to finally own it.
0767830555|5.0|One of the most cotroversial movies in cinema history, with an ending that has been analyzed by any and every true film scholar, Martin Scorsese's 1976 classic \\"Taxi Driver\\" is a masterpiece in every aspect. The themes of the film (delirium, insanity, isolation) have never been more deeply explored by any other film, the acting (in addition to De Niro's brilliant portrayal of Travis Bickle, everyone other actor involved in the film performs their best efforts, especially the [...] year old at the the time Jodie Foster), and the plot is genuinely disturbing and well developed.<br /><br />The special edition dvd comes loaded with a heap of extras, and the sound and picture quality are fantastic. I recommned this to all fans of great cinema.
B000G75AE8|4.0|I didn't like this album very much at first for some reason, but it really grew on me.  What is most impressive is the speed of the riffs: Slayer is not slowing down whatsoever. The songs have a great amount intensity to them and the guitars have a sort of clear and hard-edged tone to them that reminds me of the tone from Seasons in the Abyss.  In fact, the structures of many of the songs remind me of that album as well. (Maybe this is Dave Lombardo's influence?)  With most of these songs, if they had appeared on Seasons in the Abyss when it was released, I don't think most fans would have blinked.  That's pretty high praise. What is different is the lower tunings on some songs and the ultra-heavy slower riffs that sound more like God Hates Us All.  What is missing from this album (if you want to look at it this way) is a catchier and accessible song like Dead Skin Mask or Bloodline etc, but what you end up with instead is a front to back thrash metal album. I would recommend it.
B000085RTZ|4.0|I'm not usually a fan of \\"power metal\\", but this was a pretty good cd all the same.  Some of the songs sound basically the same but there are few that stand out.  Great guitar riff on song 5 The Edge of Paradise. Overall worth buying!
B0000C8AW5|5.0|I love Planet Waves for its warmth, resolve in the face of uncertainty, and beautiful collaboration between Dylan and the members of The Band, who together create a kind of improvisational rock chamber music.  The album's recording in November 1973 occurred precisely at a central turning point in Dylan's career--his reemergence as a touring artist after an interval of more than seven years.  Dylan's decision to resume touring (with The Band) resonated with the source of his musicality, the \\"planet waves\\" underlying all of music, love, family, and history.  Planet Waves is many things.  It is the start of a narrative of departure into the unknown (\\"Going, Going, Gone\\") and a telegraphed message that \\"the prison walls are crumblin', there is no end in sight\\" (\\"Tough Mama\\").  It is a confession of self-hate for having loved a sinister enemy (\\"Dirge\\") and a ringing declaration that now \\"my hand's on the saber\\" (\\"Something There Is About You\\").  It is poems of winter and shared solitude (\\"On a Night Like This,\\" \\"Never Say Goodbye\\") and of love anticipated and found (\\"Hazel,\\" \\"You Angel You\\").  It is a blessing for Dylan's children (\\"Forever Young\\") and, above all, a letter of deepest love for his wife Sara (\\"Wedding Song\\").  In its entirety, Planet Waves is a summation of Dylan's life at the threshold of a new and better world.    In style and theme, Planet Waves and its successor, Blood on the Tracks, are near opposites.  Planet Waves is photographic, with a focus on the present moment (the album's cover lists the exact recording dates).  In contrast, the structure of Blood on the Tracks resembles a cubist painting.  Blood on the Tracks makes time crystalline by reflecting against one another the past, present and future, the observer and the persons observed.  Using this technique, Dylan tells anguished yet profoundly analytical tales of broken relationships.  The lesson of Blood on the Tracks, as I understand it, is that love exists in a realm apart from, and not fully compatible with, the ordinary events of our daily lives.    Planet Waves and Blood on the Tracks each rank among Dylan's supreme achievements for their sweep, depth, and internal cohesiveness.  Perhaps some day, as a culmination of his career, Dylan will harmonize the divergent visions of these two works.  Even if he does not accomplish this, I will always believe in the hope offered by Planet Waves.
B000EHRVP6|1.0|I rented this movie and when I watched it... it made my stomach sick! This movie was so scary!!! It's worse then \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre.\\" I'm use to watching horror movies... but this one I don't want to watch again! When I watch this movie I wanted to scream but I couldn't. It makes me sick just thinking about watching it again!

0525457585|5.0|\\"(Bastian) had never been willing to believe that life had to be as gray and dull as people claimed.  He heard them saying: `Life is like that,' but he couldn't agree.  He never stopped believing in mysteries and miracles.\\" -page 153 <br /> <br />The Neverending Story, originally written in German by Michael Ende, speaks to that hope in us.  It concerns a sad, chubby little boy named Bastian whose life is perfectly miserable.  In an attempt to escape some bullies he finds himself in a musty old rare bookstore.  He is irresistibly drawn to a mysterious old storybook, which he steals, and flees to the attic of his school to read The Neverending Story in peace.  He reads about a world called Fantastica with incredible characters and a Childlike Empress who is terribly sick.  At the same time a terrible thing called the Nothing is destroying Fantastica and a little boy (actually a Greenskin) named Atreyu is sent on a mission by the Childlike Empress to find out the cause of this terrible plight and to save Fantastica before it's too late.  Bastian finds himself becoming entwined in the story as the lines between the two worlds become blurred.   <br /> This is one of the best books I've read in a while--it's not only a page-turner but seems to have multiple layers of meaning and in many ways feels like an allegory.  Ende's imagination is almost godlike in scope (in the same way Tolkien and Lewis were able to create the worlds of Middle Earth and Narnia).  I am usually not a fan of fantasy, but I would (and do) recommend this book to anyone (and everyone).  <br />

0385512058|1.0|Mr. Ferrazzi ignores the distinct advantage that he has had throughout his career: he is an Ivy-league grad.  While I found some of his insights to be helpful, he glosses over his educational background as though he presumes that all of his readers come from privileged upbringings.  While he attempts to diffuse his obvious advantages by opening with a discussion of his working-class roots, Mr. Ferrazzi loses steam on the very next page, writing about all of the the great schools he attended and the fact that he caddied at a country club. Caddying at a country club is not a degrading, confidence-busting job for a kid, working as a cashier at CVS is.  How does the CVS kid network his way out? <br /> <br />In one point in the book, Mr. Ferrazzi creates a lot of build up about an event he attended and how much anxiety he felt.  The big denouement was that he had a connection through Yale.  This is not compelling.  I was expecting him to have had to actually overcome something. <br /> <br />There are some good insights in the book, but few that I hadn't heard before.  I'm not sure that this book has shed any light on anything aside from the advantages of belonging to ivy-league networks.

B00005JNBQ|5.0|I have absolutely no idea how to properly describe this movie. I just know that I had to buy it b/c I rented it so often.<br /><br />Napolean is such a loser. His brother Kip could have a huge \\"L\\" on his own forehead.<br /><br />They have a pet llama named Tina and feed her casserole. Both young men live with Grandma, who broke her pelvis riding a 4-wheeler. So, Uncle Ricco moves in with the boys. He turns out to irritate Napolean and go in business with Kip.<br /><br />In the end, they all win, despite being awkward outcasts. Kip is especially transformed and finds love with a surprising woman.<br /><br />The quotes taken from this film are numerous! If for no other reason, rent or buy this movie to watch Napolean dance. There is a lengthy scene of his disco moves. Smooooth.<br /><br />And as Kip told a poor girl \\"friend\\" of Napolean's when she said she was selling homemade keychains to get herself through college, \\"Your mom goes to college...\\" Kip thought that was SUCH a good come back. I, as the viewer, felt sorry for his nerdy, ill-dressed character.<br /><br />* Especially like Napolean's friend, Pedro. Who shaves his head b/c he was hot - then buys a wig to cover his bald head. Why would have his head b/c he is hot? Isn't a wig hotter? *<br /><br />These are the questions raised by the film. It makes no difference in the world, but the film is quite entertaining.
B000E41MRC|3.0|As a documentary about the NASDAP Party Congress of 1934, their parades and speeches, it is top notch.  As an example of pioneering techniques of film making it is superb.  However unless you like to watch endless images of Nazi Germans marching around holding flags what more is there to this DVD. <br /> <br />The speeches are even banal.  They are just regular speeches about how powerful they think they are, what history they are making, how nice they look in their uniforms.  Other than the Uniforms and Swastikas it is not unlike any political convention.  Most talk is about how loyal they are, how the leaders is the best leader, what great sacifices they are all making on behalf of the greater good for their people. <br /> <br />I expected speeches about world domination, extermination, conquest and the like.  It is actually rather tame political theater.  The only thing I really took away from it was how serious they take themselves.  Even at a rally surrounded by like minded individuals in celebration of their victory they all seem rather constipated. <br /> <br />Would have been so much better in color.

0375505091|5.0|A Photographer's Life: 1990-2005 by Annie Leibovitz is one of the most compelling and heart tugging books I have ever seen. She has the most uncanny ability to capture every side of human nature, the sides whose images are forever singed in your mind - they are at the very least unforgettable and extraordinary.<br /><br />It's her heart that you can just feel in her work. I've been a lover of photography my entire life. What makes this book so special is that it's so touching. I got chocked up looking at several of the pictures - it's that kind of photography, and the stories about the people she photographs that make her work what I call the pinnacle in human photography.<br /><br />She knows there are many sides to a person, and she captures the side to convey the message that is the most real and poignant with soul-provoking images. That's what I mean by her work \\"taking you to your core\\" - She captures the soul of a person, and those frames capture a moment in time that remains eternal.<br /><br />If there was ever a photographer who is as real and genuine as her work, it is Annie Leibovitz. GET THIS BOOK - there is so much in it that will open your heart to just how precious human lives are. Annie captures them all because her heart is what inspires her work.<br /><br />Deserves a thousand stars, and more!<br /><br />Barbara Rose, author of If God Hears Me, I Want an Answer!

Okay, I'm not going to try and explain it. You are going to have to actually read it because I can't give this book the justice it actually deserves. There is a lot going on in this violent graphic novel that deserves to be told and retold to a new generation.<br /><br />Alan Moore does an awsome job of giving his characters life and actually evolving these somewhat unlikable characters into actually likable characters. Take the main character/protagonist Rorschach. At first you think he's a sociopath with some antisocial tendencies ... and your right but he in a way becomes understandable and, scary, a person that you can actually relate to.

0465092756|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book by Peter Woit.  I think he does a superb job of explaining many aspects of elementary particle physics in a way that any technically trained person can understand.<br /><br />Now, what about string theory?  Is it in trouble?  Is it, um, unraveling?  Or getting, um, tied up in knots?  Perhaps it is.  The author reports on his own doubts about it.  An obvious problem is the lack of experimental verification.  We see references to this problem from a number of people who have shown terrific insight about the physical world, such as Richard Feynman.<br /><br />Still, there are some good reasons why many bright people have done so much work with strings.  If theories that employ zero-dimensional particles aren't giving good results, it makes sense to try one-dimensional strings.  And I think the work that has been done in assessing what such theories would look like has not been in vain.  But is it leading in the right direction?  I'm not so sure about that.  Scientists have to try new things to solve problems.  Sometimes, they clearly increase human knowledge, and the progression of advances from the first use of the Lie Group SU(3) by particle physicists in the early 1960s through the development of the Standard Model is a good example of that.  Woit explains much of this extremely well.<br /><br />And, of course, sometimes, new ideas do not lead anywhere, at least at first.  That's what science is all about.<br /><br />There is some material about how the scientific community operates.  Do scientific fads get established, and if so does all this retard progress?  Well, sure, we're all only human, and sometimes that can happen.  But I think that there are always plenty of scientists who are willing to try new ideas, especially if they feel that too many of their colleagues are off on a wild goose chase.  So I do not really share some of the author's concerns here.  And there is no way I would insult the world's string theorists by comparing their work (or commitment to scholarship) to that of the Modern Language Association!<br /><br />There is one other point I would like to comment on.  Woit does discuss the anthropic principle.  This is, at its simplest level, the statement that the universe we live in has to be one in which life could exist.  That's obviously true, of course.  But it can be extended to imply that there have been (or are, or could be) a vast multitude of other universes or realities with other properties, many of which could not support creatures such as ourselves.  And I think this is quite fair.  It is reasonable philosophically as well.  If we regard all of Reality as the Universe since the Big Bang, we are making a rather provincial claim that Reality is confined to the products of the Big Bang, an event which occurred less than 20 billion years ago (the present best estimate is around 13.5 billion years).  The Earth is over 4 billion years old, so this best estimate is considerably less than 4 times the age of our planet!  I think it is at least as reasonable to hypothesize that there may be much more to Reality than that!<br /><br />Woit complains that some of the references to the anthropic principle simply make excuses for the lack of predictive power of string theory.  And that may get some people to think that the anthropic principle is some sort of cop-out, like invoking Gods or Goddesses to explain why the parameters we see have the values they do.  But that would be unfair.  It really does not advance Science to simply give up, ascribing the nature of the Universe to the whims of an inscrutable Deity.  But it is a scientific question to ask if some physical parameter is constrained to have the value it does or can have (or could have had) some other value.  It might well be that scientists will conclude that some of these parameters appear to have arbitrary values.  That could lead to a search for mechanisms that might vary these parameters.  And that in turn might even lead to the discovery of some mechanisms that might explain some of this.  So I think Woit's reaction to the anthropic principle may be unnecessarily harsh.<br /><br />In spite of my occasional disagreements with the author's reactions to the state of particle physics today, I highly recommend this book.might explain some of this.  So I think Woit's reaction to the anthropic principle may be unnecessarily harsh.    In spite of my occasional disagreements with the author's reactions to the state of particle physics today, I highly recommend this book.

0684874350|3.0|No Title Available <br />Availability: This item is currently unavailable.  <br />    <br /> <br />  2 of 3 people found the following review helpful: <br /> <br /> The Hardships God Puts Us Through., March 5, 2005 <br />Frank McCourt wrote the famous bestseller, ANGELA'S ASHES. In this book, you learn about the personality of Angela and the events just prior to her death. His version of the Irish funeral 'doings' at a fancy mortuary in New York whre they partied with lots of beer is almost sacrilege. He had suggesting putting her ashes in a body bag and leaving them on the curb for garbage pickup. He and Frank were in financial straits at the time, but brother Alphie was doing okay. Frank became the possessor of her ashes in an old bean can.  <br /> <br />Bob Miller wrote this account from McCourt's avid remembrances. Like Eddie Fisher's BEEN THERE, DONE THAT, he reveals the bad with the good. Malachy's narration is spelled almost phonetically, the Irish sayings Americanized, which I guess his fans would get a kick out of -- it reminded me of the old man in 'Brigadoon.'  <br /> <br />Since I don't watch soap operas I have not recognized him as a young man, nor at the age of 69 when he was diagnosed with cancer. He had a sad life in Ireland, but after coming to America drank his way around the world to forget his past.  <br /> <br />Part of this book is about the retarded stepdaughter and the experimental program they agreed to at the Willowbrook State School for the Retarded on Staten Island. To get a place for her, they signed consent for her to be used as a guinea pig in a hepatitis program funded by the U. S. Army. The place as described resembled the one in the movie, 'Suddenly Last Summer,' in which Elizabeth Taylor is committed by a demented aunt and she wonders out on a raised landing above a mass of humanity \\"driven totally mad\\" by the place in which they were drugged, abused and locked. These things actually existed, and he and his wife Diana witnessed it first hand.  <br /> <br />He tried to expose the horrible abuse through the media (radio and t.v.). He said, \\"Media types will come to the 'field of dreams', but don't ask them to cover the plains of nightmare.\\" Finally, they were able to get Geraldo Rivera to tour the back wards with a cameraman. It took them two years to get heard in Court in 1972. It was a historic case, followed by similar suits across the country, that all people have a right to decent human conditions no matter what their mental status.  <br /> <br />He made his mark in Hollywood and New York in movies and plays, and was host of t.v. and radio talk shows. So I'm sure he has a vast following of those who've seen him -- and read his previous book, A MONK SWIMMING.  <br /> <br />He was the Boston police lieutenant in 1978 'The Brinks Job' and was in 'Mass Appeal' on Broadway in 1982. Then his soap opera career started in 'Search for Tomorrow,' 'One Life To Live,' 'Ryan's Hope,' etc. Now he has embarked on a career as a writer, or at least a storyteller to beat all. All in all, his is a success story.
0060545682|4.0|El libro \\"Mi país inventado\\" de Isabel Allende es muchas cosas al mismo tiempo:    Es un viaje a Chile: Isabel Allende nos cuenta de la geografía, de la política, de la cultura (especialmente del humor) y también de la historia reciente de este país Latinoamericano. Pero no es una guía que pretende reemplazar por ejemplo los libros de la \\"Lonely Planet\\". Si buscas una guía de ese tipo debes que comprar otro libro.    \\"Mi país inventado\\" también es una autobiografía: Allende describe su infancia en Santiago de Chile. Cuenta de sus padres y parientes; especialmente nos deja saber muchas cosas sobre su abuelo. Pero al final solamente es una autobiografía muy rudimentaria (el libro de bolsillo solamente tiene aproximadamente 200 paginas).    Sobretodo ese libro es una declaración de amor por \\"su país\\" (ella misma refiere varias veces a Chile como \\"mi país\\" - inclusive en su título ), por su patria. Sí, claro, escribe sobre la década del gobierno Pinochet en los anos 1970s, de las brutalidades cometidos por los militares etc. Sí, claro, nos cuenta de las características menos favorables de sus compatriotas. Y sí, claro, nos explica como a ella le gusta vivir en California con su marido y que bueno es para ella regresar \\"home\\" a San Francisco. Pero sin embargo después de leer \\"Mi país inventado\\" no hay ninguna duda donde reside su alma: en Chile.    ¿Entonces, para quiénes fue escrito ese libro? Pienso que probablemente sea para los aficionados de Latino América y de Isabel Allende. Para lectores que ya conocen sus libros de ficción y que quieren saber más sobre Chile y Isabel Allende y de lo que Isabel Allende piensa de \\"su\\" país. A mi me gustó muchísimo leer \\"Mi país inventado\\".
0618680004|5.0|I've just finished reading the 141 reviews above mine, and I think they're utterly fascinating--almost as interesting as the book. And the scores--the numbers who find each review helpful--are equally remarkable. <br /> <br />Some reviewers, delighted to find their opinions supported by Dawkins, use the opportunity to bask in their superior intellects and display their generous contempt for those who disagree. <br /> <br />Other reviewers feel personally attacked by this book, fending it off as best they can so they can retain their illusions, which are obviously valuable and meaningful to them.  <br /> <br />Actually, you don't even have to read the reviews to see which is which. Just look at the numbers. If you see very few finding the review useful, you'll know the review was written by someone opposing Dawkins' ideas. And if the majority find the review helpful, that means it agrees with Dawkins. <br /> <br />This tells me that most of the people who are bothering to read the reviews are already pro-Dawkins--and it bodes ill for his hopes that his book will convert the believers. <br /> <br />It won't convert many believers, not because it is wrong--it isn't--and not because it isn't well-written--it is--but because whatever else you can say about faith, it isn't easily extinguished. For those who have it, it is the only life raft on a limitless ocean. Those who don't have learned how to swim, or plan to. <br /> <br />The most annoying reviewers, from my point of view, are those whose remarks demonstrate they haven't read the book (such as the fellow who insists Einstein was a believer), or those who feel Dawkins doesn't have the Biblical knowledge to back up his conclusions. <br /> <br />He doesn't need any Biblical knowledge. None of us do, when it comes to the question of belief. Memorizing the Bible neither adds nor subtracts from our ability to feel faith. <br /> <br />And that's the bottom line for me. I am unable to accept an assertion of any kind supported by nothing more than faith. I need some kind of truth, some kind of evidence.  <br /> <br />There are or might be moments when I am jealous of those capable of faith. I would love to believe, when a loved one dies, that he or she is going to a better place and that we'll meet again some day. What a lovely, comforting thought. Would that it were true, or that I could believe it. But I don't--and it makes this life and every moment in it more valuable to me. <br /> <br />I once asked myself how a person totally unfamiliar with religion, might choose among the world's offerings, might decide to adopt one of the world's thousands of religions. I could find no way. They all claim they're right and all the other religions are wrong. But are any of them right? <br /> <br />Now I'm thinking similar thoughts about God. I saw a website recently that compiled the names of all of the gods, worldwide and throughout history. They found 3800 different gods or supernatural beings. If I were inclined to believe, which one would I choose and why? <br /> <br />Dawkins points out that we're all atheists. We don't believe in Amon-re, Zeus, Thor, Apollo, Odin, etc., etc., etc. He just goes one god further.
B000G8NXZK|5.0|This is one of those movies that has so many fascinating elements in such strange context that one wonders at the attraction - but its there and it will not let you go.  It is, perhaps, Robert DeNiro's best role ever but few even realize he appears in it.<br /><br />It is a cult classic of a world gone to the bureaucratic extreme where every facet of life is determined by a central control computer.  No longer is the computer a tool, it is the real authority now and no glitch can be undone without all the appropriate forms completed in triplicate with proper stamps.<br /><br />It is a world where vanity has run amuck with facelifts and botox creating hideous perversions of youth.<br /><br />It is, in the end, a world earily similar to our own though in outrageous parody.  You are left with an uneasy laugh that perhaps it is all too real to be humorous.<br /><br />It will be a cult classic for years to come.  Brilliant British-style comedy with a message.

He tells the murderers he will help get them a lawyer. Unbeknownst to Perry Smith, Capote is trying to get answers out of him for his work.<br /> With all the material Capote has, he has decided to write a book, [[ASIN:0812994388 In Cold Blood (Modern Library)]], but because he was waiting for Perry Smith to finally open up and talk about the murders and wanting an ending of this case, the book was not published until 1966.

I found myself picking up the book and reading 50 pages here and there until I fianlly had time to finish this excellent piece of historical research. This book is a fascinating account of the Lincoln Presidency and the state of America during the years leading up to, and through the Civil War. I highly reccomend this book to anyone who is a casual student of history and those who consider themselves wonks in this field. My only advice is that you be willing to devote the time to this book because it is quite large, but well worth it.
1878424114|1.0|his writing style and explanations border on comedy. i can see how they might touch someone who's never read anything of that nature before, but even then i would expect a critical thinking person to sooner reject spirituality altogether rather than persue it after reading something of this nature. his words are empty rhetoric and his concepts are borrowed from true teachings and then stripped of most of their substance.    this book holds no credibility for me. and in my opinion, one could only \\"follow\\" what he says. he presents nothing in a manner that allows it to be properly considered. nothing to be understood. just gross generalizations, false causal relationships, and superficial advice.        petty materialism, masquerading as spirituality.        i think his book is an insult to all of the philosophies and religions that he skimmed and took from in order to write it.
B0000033OZ|4.0|The \\"Art Rock\\" movement was considered (for all intent purposes) dead after King Crimson's brilliant \\"In The Court Of The Crimson King\\" was released.  How could any band be expected to follow up a masterpiece like that?  In the top soil of the recording  establishment...a seedling arrived, and grew like a giant hogweed reaching out for the sun.  How's that for art?  I apologize for straying, but any attempt of someone discussing the art rock movement of the late 60's would most assuredly  have to pay respect to Peter Gabriel's lyrical content in \\"The Return Of The Giant Hogweed\\" on the  Nursery Cryme LP from Genesis.  Emerson, Lake and Palmer as a band, were hardly innovative and never rated as \\"pioneers\\" of this particular genre.  Not in my book anyway. When put in proper perspective, ELP of the 70's represent what Asia were in the 80's. Nothing more. Bands like Yes, Pink Floyd and The Moody Blues would be considered \\"pioneers\\" of this genre. Spinoffs like ELP merely exploited a particular element of art rock.<br /><br />Pompous (maybe not as pompous as Robert Fripp), overly self-indulgent and well beyond pretentious, ...long haired nerds with expensive gadgits to play with pretty much sums up the ELP era.  However,...ELP did release quite a few gems during  their glorious stadium tour days of the 70's (From The Beginning, Still...You Turn Me On and Fanfare For The Common Man; which could also be heard before every commercial break of every NFL football game broadcasted on CBS), and you can also find some of them on their 1971 (U.S. Atlantic recording) debut.  Perhaps a bit dated by todays standards, Lucky Man (an AM radio favorite) is still a considerably strong and memorable smash hit.  But even more significant is the epic Take A Pebble.  The jaw clenching (The) Barbarian and the relentless Tank make ELP's first LP a poignant piece (albeit; a small piece) of art rock in progressive \\"Art Rock\\" mode. ...in the wake of Crimson's classic 1969 \\"observation\\". ...in singular form, Greg Lake (because of Peter Sinfield's poetry) and Kieth Emerson (The Nice) could be considered \\"pioneers of progressive rock\\", but not in ELP form.

B000002HAJ|4.0|I enjoy The Cure, although, some of their records really bore me. The classics are always welcome, but some other tracks just don't do the job for me.<br /><br />Well, I remember I first got in touch with The Cure because of this Wish album. Back then, I had it in Cassete tape. So after all these years, I heard Trust in a friend's house and I said \\" I just have to get this album on cd once again\\".<br /><br />For me it's one of their best albums yet released and has a great ambience to it, really represents for me what The Cure stands for, that kind of ultra romantic goth punk sound...<br /><br />So stop wishing impossible things and get this album in your collectios ASAP!
B000002MTR|4.0|People always say this album was weird as a result of it having Dave Navarro on guitar, I've heard this said before and it's reflected in the amazon review for the album above as well. However, on this album which came out in 1995 the Chili Peppers still have that energetic spark & creativity, just with a different guitarist. In my opinion though the Chili Peppers continued to evolve and experiment with different sounds from BSSM to this album to Californication, they never really started to fall off until 2002's By The Way. That's when they took some of the poppy top 40 radio-friendliness of Californication too far to an unbalanced level, they watered down their sound too much. But they've been around for so long & released so many great albums, every single one up to that point so one can't really complain.

Give it up, you'll never achieve what this wonderful album did and still does, which is, original and mindblowing songs!<br /><br />So when in doubt, should I get this cd? Do as the song says \\"Please leave us here, close our eyes to the octopus ride\\".
B000059ZT4|5.0|Seriously, listen to how good they sound & how bad the previously released reworked version is in comparison. The reviewer below me brings up a valid point about the length of the album overall compared to the price, however you would not benefit to search for a bargain priced version of the previously released aka watered down version. You have to get the originals and not even listen to the reworked version because it's not even close to how good the real album truly is. And that goes for a lot of Marley material, which is why the bootleg & rare albums are so good, as well as these original Jamican mixes.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|Every episode of the series at a price that's cheap in comparison to the yearly DVDs.  A few fun and interesting bonuses too.  It's SO MUCH better than watching the cut up versions of TBS or WGN.  I've watched the whole set twice already and still look forward to watching it again.  An awesome show.
B00000I8UK|5.0|One of a handful of seminal, super-important, incredible recordings from the early sixties - this one from a relatively obscure man who influenced countless jazz, rock, even classical musicians.  There's no way Out to Lunch should be sitting a 4.5 stars.  That's criminal!<br /><br />I've owned this recording in various formats since 1974 when I was 19 years old.  I bought it because Frank Zappa paid Dolphy a homage with his \\"Eric Dolphy Memorial BBQ\\" on Weasels Ripped my Flesh.  It's such a shame that Eric did not live long enough to see Out to Lunch!, a landmark recording, released.  I think he would be very pleased to know that this incredible work of art is so highly regarded by musicians today. Listen to it.  It's a serious work of art, pushing musical boundaries, but it's just bubbling over with playfullness.  These guys are having tremendous fun making serious music!  The communication going on here is of the order of Kind of Blue or Filles De Kilamajaro - but I guarantee these guys were laughing at one another while this was recorded.  I like the other reviewers description of Tony Williams daring Freddie Hubbard to be even bolder (as if his playing wasn't bold enough) That reviewer understands exactly what is going on here.<br /><br />Out to Lunch! is like nothing you've heard before and everytime one listens the listener discovers something new.  The cast assembled were all highly-skilled musicians and Dolphy's vision for a \\"free\\" session where the musicians play tightly together is fully realized.  The dialogs between all of the musicians are extraordinary but in particular the dynamic between Tony Williams and Bobby Hutcherson is just surreal throughout the recording.<br /><br />Oh, and you don't have to be a musician to enjoy this (although it helps) I've turned several non-musician friends on to this and they all love it.  I'm thinking fans of Tom Waits \\"Rain Dogs\\" will love this.<br />Out to Lunch! is a serious work of avante garde music but it is very approachable, even to listeners who normally wouldn't like such wild music.  It is rich with humor and musical \\"jokes\\".<br /><br />Listen:  When King Crimson's 30th anniversary edition of \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" was released I'd been listening a lot to Out to Lunch!  When I heard Ian McDonald's vibe playing on the track Moonchild from ITCOTCK I made an immediate connection to Bobby Hutcherson's vibe playing.  Now, I just happened to be communicating with Ian regarding the tune \\"Blue in Green\\" and couldn't resist asking him if he'd been influenced by Dolphy's Out to Lunch! when he composed the music for \\"In the Court of the Crimson King.  McDonald wrote back \\"Busted!!!\\"<br /><br />Listeners familiar with King Crimson's later work Lark's Tongues in Aspic Part II will instantly recognize the main riff came from the piece titled \\"Gazzelloni\\" from Out to Lunch!<br /><br />Frank Zappa was also greatly influenced by Eric Dolphy and immortalized him with the piece \\"The Eric Dolphy Memorial BBQ\\" When you listen to early Zappa music, especially the interplay between the horns and the marimba and vibes, tbe connection and influence of Eric Dolphy's Out to Lunch is very overt.  I turned Andrew Keeling on to this recording and he loved it so much he asked me if I had any other recommendations.  Keeling is the composer who was commissioned to orchestrate the music of King Crimson.<br /><br />In short, anyone who listens to music that was created for real listening, whether its someone of the likes of John Coltrane, Miles Davis, Charlie Mingus, Ornette Coleman, Primus, Dave Matthews, Frank Zappa or King Crimson, is going to love Out To Lunch!  If you like REAL, creative music, purchase this at once and you too can go Out to Lunch!<br /><br />PS - a little bit of trivia. Cal Schenkel's fantastically bizzare artwork for Zappa's Burnt Weeney Sandwich was originally commissioned for an Eric Dolphy record (possibly Out to Lunch) - I got that straight from Schenkel himself.Cool!<br /><br />\\"It sounds like someone is standing on Eric's foot when he's playing\\"<br />Miles Davis on Eric Dolphy.'s playing\\"  Miles Davis on Eric Dolphy.
B000F8O35U|5.0|Finally got around to watching this last night. In this review I'm not going to bother to review the movie itself. It's seventeen years old. I'm sure if you are interested in it you've seen it by now. Rather, I'm going to review the technical quality of the film and the extras provided on the DVD. One thing that feel I should point out up front is that the movie HAS been edited, but only in one scene. The infamous 'clergyman sporting an erection' that caused such a stupid flundie flap has been photoshopped. The theatrical poster artwork is not on the cover or anywhere on the disc for a similar reason. You can find out more by going to Snopes and looking in the Disney films section. I personally don't care, but some people do. Now, on to the review.    This version is widescreen, but it's 16:9 widescreen and not theatrical widescreen, but this has been the case in pretty much all the Disney movie DVDs so no surprises there. The Little Mermaid was the next to last movie Disney did using painted cels, and the film has gone through some kind of digital restoration process. There are comparison shots on the back of the DVD box that show the difference. The colors are very vibrant, and I didn't notice any problems with the encoding or animation. There is support for surround sound and audio tracks in English, French, and Spanish.    It's a two disk set. Disc one has the movie, the configuration options (subtitles, commentary, language ect), a music video of the song 'Kiss the Girl' by someone I've never heard of, a bunch of previews that will be outdated in a few months, and a preview of what's on disc 2. On the box it touts something called Fast Play, which basically means when you load it in, after the standard FBI warnings and all that, the disc gives you the option of immediately starting the movie or going to the menu with the stuff I just mentioned. If you choose to start the movie directly, it plays a bunch of previews that you can skip past using chapter forward on your remote, if you go to the menu and pick play movie, it starts right away. You're actually not forced to sit through ten minutes of BS previews with no way to skip them like on some of the previous Disney DVDs. I approve.     The majority of the extras are on disc 2. It's broken up into three major sections: Backstage Disney, Deleted Scenes, and Games. Backstage Disney is the largest section. It has scads of concept art (imagine Ursula as a lionfish or manta ray instead of an octopus), a videos on how the movie was made, and a new animated short, The Little Match Girl. A silent film with a musical background and is amazingly enough, actually true to the story. It's pretty well done, IMHO. Deleted scenes is just that, stuff that was cut. There really isn't much. Only three selections, and two of them are just pieces that were cut from scenes that did make it in. There's an expanded version of the opening song, a very short scene where Triton's daughters tell Sebastian that Ariel isn't at the recital before it starts, and an extra verse in Ursula's song. All of these were cut before the final animation was done, and so as you watch it switches back and forth between storyboard still shots and very rough sketchy animation. The games I didn't even bother with, because has there ever been a DVD player game that hasn't totally sucked? Didn't think so.    Overall, it's going to boil down to how much you like the movie, and how much you hate minor edits. If not seeing Jessica Rabbit with no underwear for three frames bothered you, then this DVD is not for you. Otherwise, it is a comprehensive look at the movie that marked the beginning of Disney's second golden age.     I give it 9 out of 10 voice containing seashells.

B00004BZ0N|5.0|For years, I was unsure of how I felt about this album.  As a classic rock afficionado first and foremost, this was never a favorite of mine.  But the advent of more serious punk in the last couple of years has led me to revisit this album, and I'm now thoroughly convinced that this is one of rock's greatest all-time moments.<br /><br />Looking back, I can see that my early dismissal of this album was actually the feeling of the threat the Clash represented.  When this album was released in 1980, FM radio was devoted mainly to classic rock and music fans had seen many artists in that genre elevate to god-like status.  Over their first two albums, although relevant and topical, the Clash's musical style was stereotypical of their forerunners, the Stooges, the Ramones, and the Sex Pistols, and didn't seem to offer too much else musically.  But \\"London Calling\\" was a revelation.  Throughout the album there exists a stunning variance of styles, from angry marches, to rockabilly, to breezy pop, to punk, to reggae, and on and on and on.  The topics got more varied as well, ranging more seriously into British social problems and protests against the governments of the world.<br /><br />At this point in time, a punk band had never been bold enough to seriously tackle the issues of the day, let alone adapt their musical style to broaden their audience.  The Clash was the first \\"punk\\" band to become recognized as serious artists, and this wouldn't reoccur until Green Day released \\"American Idiot\\" nearly 25 years later.  That should serve as satisfactory proof that this album was truly visionary and light years ahead of its time.
B000HIVQD0|5.0|The Pretenders' first album is one of the great rock albums.  <br /> <br />Ever. <br /> <br />After a quarter of a century, your heart will still quicken and your blood pressure will rise. That same excitement you got back then will come right back. <br /> <br />Without an ounce of hyperbole, this nuclear-hot collaboration between an American expatriate and three profoundly talented Englishmen at the tail end of the punk movement resulted in a 12-song set that in it's quality, influence, vision, range, ambition and plain old rock & roll energy has yet to be matched. <br /> <br />You hear this album, you will think these guys could do anything they wanted. Punk to pop, country to new-wave soul. It's all here, and none of it sounds like genre-hopping. It's a totally organic sound. Instantly recognizable. <br /> <br />This album has not been remastered since its' original release, and now benefits from greater separation and clarity, yet it doesn't sound too harsh or over-detailed. It feels true to its' source. It's crisp. I had hoped after \\"Pirate Radio\\" (the recent box set) that their records would start to become available in newly remastered versions; here we have the first of two...a double CD at a double CD price point. <br /> <br />You have Chrissie Hynde's inimitable voice...part Dusty Springfield, part snarling cat. James Honeyman-Scott's precise, spare, efficient (but still thoroughly musical)  style of playing was the sound of a punk rocker who took a lot of lessons. Pete Farndon's muscular, melodic bass was clearly influenced by British 60's rock...like the Who and the Beatles. Martin Chambers' drumming could go from a simple 4/4 backbeat to these unearthly tempo shifts and back without sounding like he's even trying. <br /> <br />This gem of a record starts with a count-off leading into the lacerating \\"Precious\\". Chrissie Hynde's vibrato purr over her compatriots' buzzsaw back-up tell us immediately we're in for something we've never heard before. <br />The now-famous four-letter exhortation spit at the listener startles you (\\"Not me baby I'm too precious...@#$% off!\\"), warning you to buckle up for the ride, as the album begins. <br /> <br />\\"The Phone Call\\", its' simple two-chord back-and-forth and punky spoken vocals, seduce you into listening more carefully...\\"what the heck is she saying\\" sorta stuff...as the incredibly tight rhythm section builds to a powerful instrumental coda. <br /> <br />\\"Up The Neck\\" shows a softer, more elegant musicality...with the bolder sound returning around the chorus. Many of the sounds and motifs flow over from \\"The Phone Call\\", especially the guitar lead. <br /> <br />In fact, this album sounds more of a piece...a true album versus a collection of songs...than any other of that era. <br />Of ANY era, actually. The pace and sequencing always invite you to listen \\"more\\"...to become involved. Whether that's bouncing around gleefully or pulling the headphones closer to decode murmured lyrics depends on the song. <br /> <br />\\"Tattooed Love Boys\\", one of the most original singles to come out of the post-punk/New Wave scene, has an acceleration that the most amphetamine-laced speed metal freak could only aspire to. The 15/8 tempo (or something close to that) keeps you off-balance yet hurtling forward at the same time. It's the sound of a runaway truck heading down an icy mountain with no brakes... <br />The sudden break in the middle is sublime. The exquisitely simple yet freakin' awesome guitar \\"solo\\" is an air-guitarist's dream. It is physically impossible to sit still during this song. <br /> <br />The thick bass of \\"Space Invader\\" introduces you to that rarest of all things: an interesting rock instrumental. <br /> <br />\\"The Wait\\" is pure bedlam. The opening \\"ker-whang\\" guitar chord perks your ears, the band thunders in, Miss Hynde grunts once...loudly...and we're off on a breakneck, thrilling rollercoaster of a punk ride.  <br />Clean, crisp playing...never once overdoing it...everynote and chord in perfect place. Pete Farndon's bass work would make John Entwistle smile. The song literally skids to a halt. <br /> <br />\\"Stop Your Sobbing\\" is a shock...a terrific Kinks cover with anthemic vocals by Chrissie Hynde that flirt with a little country flavor along with it's classic English pop sound. After the searing \\"The Wait\\", this is almost soothing. <br />A necessary reprieve. <br /> <br />\\"Kid\\" continues to show their ambition, their almost limitless prowess. It's a more conventional pop song, like \\"Sobbing\\". The sound is still urgent, and still powerful, but not as bruising. <br /> <br />If there is a weak spot, the moody \\"Private Life\\" might be it. It's atmospheric, but after eight unbelievable songs, it's a little boring and a little long. It's over six minutes. There's a lot to like in it...and I rarely skip it, but I rarely hit \\"repeat\\" if you know what I mean. <br /> <br />But then there's the chiming intro to \\"Brass In Pocket\\", the classic single with it's loping, insistent beat, simple guitar and bass lines and straightforward drumming. \\"I'm special...so special\\" Yes indeed, Miss Hynde. After the tempo explorations of the earlier tunes, this song's clarity and beauty shine in context. <br /> <br />Again...all of a piece. <br /> <br />\\"Lovers of Today\\" is another lesser effort...having the unfortunate spot after \\"Pocket\\". It's slow, and indulgent, something which The Pretenders had yet to be on this album. <br /> <br />The martial drumming of Martin Chambers opens the finale, \\"Mystery Achievement\\", a dark rocker with a sinuous bass hook. Great vocals, great sing-along chorus...fiery guitar breaks...the call-and-response between Scott's slashing chords and Chambers' drums...what a way to end the album! <br /> <br />We get a second disc of stuff, led off by the Bo-Diddley-ish \\"Cuban Slide\\" that is so good I wish it had replaced \\"Lovers of Today\\". It's slight, but it sounds like they're having a load of fun...listen to Chrissie sing thoseLatin \\"Ay-yi-yi's\\"! <br />\\"Porcelain\\" is another rave-up...an exercise in tempo shifts, crashing guitars...and this got left off? <br />A number of demos are informative, but mainly show that these guys were ready from the get-go. \\"The Wait\\" starts off faster, if you can believe that...and \\"Brass\\" is too slow. <br />Don't miss the swaggering instrumental \\"Swinging London\\". Why I have a vision of Austin Powers right now I don't know. Also check out the country lament \\"Tequila\\". <br />There are a handful of live tracks that will cause your speakers to blister. <br />Then there's the live \\"Sabre Dance\\"...yes, THAT one...the song from a thousand cartoons and commercials...with Chrissie Hynde chirping in some \\"Sobbing\\" lines...it's an odd way to end the \\"odds and sods\\" disc, but kinda hilarious. I can only imagine what the live audience was thinking... <br /> <br />The CD package comes in a lovely gatefold with terrific liner notes...and...wait for it... <br /> <br />LYRICS! <br /> <br />Yup. There really are lyrics to some of these blurs. I gleefully started to peruse them, but I liked my own, timeworn interpretations better, the stuff I THOUGHT they had been saying all these decades. Use them at your own peril. <br /> <br />There are few female rock singers today that do not owe their careers to this record. The Pretenders took punk's raucous energy & simplicity and fused it with pop sensibility & intelligent musicianship. <br /> <br />There are few records that retain the ability to enthrall over time. This one remains endlessly fascinating. You find yourself, in near-disbelief, thinking, \\"MAN is this an awesome record!\\" <br /> <br />My enthusiasm for this album has not diminished for over 25 years.
B00005ASHM|4.0|I've always been deeply torn over \\"Pet Sounds\\".  For decades it has been regarded as a foundational album in rock history, and to some degree I agree with this.  Brian Wilson, Paul McCartney and John Lennon were the visionary rock and roll artists who decided to write songs about more controversial topics than surfing with girls and driving cars fast, and \\"Pet Sounds\\" was unquestionably Wilson's artistic peak.  So it would only serve to follow that the album should fall into the position of legend.  And it has.  Rolling Stone logged it as #2, behind only \\"Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\", in its 2003 ranking of rock's all time best albums.<br /><br />So what's the dilemma?<br /><br />I've always been deeply troubled by awarding the term \\"legend\\" to an album that doesn't meet with significant consumer response.  I know that can be dangerous, because some albums are so far ahead of their time that commercial success isn't ready for it.  Some would argue that this was the fate of \\"Pet Sounds\\", but I'm unconvinced.  Two songs, \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\" and \\"Sloop John B\\", hit the top 10, and \\"God Only Knows\\" also was a top 40 hit.  So the public still was ready for the Beach Boys sound; they just didn't buy this album in droves.<br /><br />And therein lays my concern.  A band that was as well established as the Beach Boys were not able to bring the public along with it as it progressed from hitmakers to serious musicians.  And other artists have been clearly able to bring the public with them.  The Beatles did it with \\"Sergeant Pepper\\".  The Rolling Stones did it with \\"Let It Bleed\\".  Pink Floyd did it with \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\".  And in this millennium, Green Day did it with \\"American Idiot\\".  So most certainly, a shift in lyrical topics can be navigated successfully without a total sacrifice of success.  I can accept that album sales were not as brisk for rock acts in the mid-1960's, but \\"Pet Sounds\\" charted a lower peak (#10) than 10 of the 11 Beach Boys albums that came before it.  Lyrical shifts are not just topical, but timely - and the audience of the Beach Boys was simply not ready for this album.  So the question continues to rage - and I still don't see this album as a true legend.s albums that came before it.

B000H0MKOC|4.0|Nick Naylor is the Vice-President for the Institute of Tobacco studies, in other words the \\"spin Dr.\\" who speaks for the tobacco industry in an attempt to counteract studies which have shown that tobacco is harmful to your health.  In the opening scene, he appears on a t.v. show and makes a Vermont senator and others look ridiculous for suggesting that people should not smoke.  Like a magician, Nick distracts the audience with a seemingly true statement while managing to twist what others say.  On the other side of the coin is Nick's young son who lives with his mother, but still considers his father to be \\"a god\\" (in the words of Nick's estranged wife.)  Nick's dilemma is how to keep both sides satisfied while, as he puts it, he manages to \\"pay the mortgage\\".  This movie is a fresh and clever satire, well-acted by Aaron Echhart and his supporting cast.  It is a refreshing change from many of the trite and predictable movies which are currently produced in Hollywood.

B000GFLKF8|3.0|I figured a movie with Denzel Washington, Jodie Foster and Clive Owen that it could be one to rememeber or have some replay value. I was wrong. A very predictable same old tune type of movie. Denzel is one of my favorite actors but he is above this movie. Absolutely nothing here to get you on the edge whatsoever. Spike Lee's racial undertones throughout the movie is very annoying and is just not neccessary. A little humour throughout the movie helps a bit but I am still disappointed with this one. This is the fourth movie Denzel has made with Spike Lee. Lets hope its his last. As one of the premier actors in Hollywood, he deserves better.
B00004RYRV|5.0|Others have analyzed the greatness of this film far better than I could ever hope to..... I just think that it might of interest to tell you all that as a Drama teacher for 35 years, I showed this classic to every one of my classes..That makes  over 165 viewings...not to mention the times I showed it to friends or just watched myself..And THE FILM NEVER FAILED TO FASCINATE ME! With every viewing I discovered a new golden nugget of genius...NUFF SAID!
B00003CX9S|5.0|I have overlooked this movie for years but I am glad that I finally decided to watch this masterpiece. The story of John Merrick is fascinating to say the least. They way it was put on film was extraordinary in so many ways. The acting by John Hurt, Anthony Hopkins and other well known british actors gives me a great respect for british actors as a whole. The film set in black and white sets the mood throughout the film and was a brilliant idea.  <br />This film , as others have mentioned is heartwrenching with moments of joy. I just can't see how anyone cannot be moved by this film. As John Hurt put it in the DVD extra interview \\" If someone does not get moved by this film, it is probably someone I wouldn't want to know\\". How very true.

0393061434|5.0|Steve Wozniak tells an amazing story in iWOZ. I read the book from cover to cover the day it arrived, and am extremely satisfied with it. If you are worried about the amount of technical jargon that may be in this book, dont be, because it is minimal and Wozniak explains everything he writes. Many are criticising his way of writing, but understand that he writes as though he was speaking. <br /> <br />5*'s!
B00007KWHN|4.0|Back in the 70s I thought this album was rather primitive to the virtusosity and style found in the later ones. I had the vynil edition form atlantic, the photo was dated even back then and its one of those albums not with the artistry in cover design that mades tem legendary too.<br /><br />Now 25 years later, I decided to buy for old times sake. Yes its good, i still see the prelude of their great work to come, I find it even better than when I was a teen, nostalgic, maybe, but to rehear that music buried in the past has renewal effect I cannot well explain
0451197968|5.0|Yes, this book has flaws.  The pacing is choppy, there are some pretty improbably events, but this is one of my favorites of all time, and definately my favorite King story.  Why?  I think in the foreword to the edition I have King says it best himself: \\"It's all story.\\"
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|This movie was much better than I ever dreamed it would be. The story seemed very possible and it used modern issues to help make it seem in the not so distant future. It was refreshing to have a main character who is intelligent, well spoken, vicious but not hokey. Once you get passed the long long speech V gives in the alley way, the rest of the movie is incredible. Once you see the rest of it, you may find that beginning speech much more informative and inspirational.
B00006EXL5|5.0|This is a fantastic album. I fell in love with this band when I picked this album up off the shelf in 2003. The lyrics, the tone, the themes...they are original and breathtaking. \\"Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge\\" and \\"Black Parade\\" are TERRIBLE. Listen to this album, stop listening to what gets played on mainstream radio and stop watching what MTV is trying to brainwash your head with, open the musician inside you and embrace the real MCR.
B000002I7R|4.0|Robert Plant will always be known as the charismatic, vocally unique crooner of Led Zeppelin. But he is vastly underrated as a solo artist. As a composer and producer his talents need much reappraisal.  <br /> <br />No album would serve as a better introduction to these talents than PICTURES AT ELEVEN, his first album as a solo artist (and the only one where he receives solo credit as a producer). Here we are introduced to Plant's unique sound which is made up of tight instrumentation, experimentation with available technology and a willingness to realize truly individual musical visions. From the opening track \\"Burning down one side\\", the clean, crisp production and the wonderful melody tells the listener that this is a unique listen, then we are taken to all kinds of musical styles from blues  \\"Worse than Detroit\\", to jazzy rock \\"Pledge Pin\\", to just plain un-pigeonholable territory like the closing track \\"Mystery Title\\".  <br /> <br />Although Plant had not completely shed off his Zeppelin influences yet (as evidenced by the awesome, yet Zeppelin-like \\"Slow Dancer\\"), every track here is melodic, polished, unique, immensely enjoyable and most importantly has aged very well considering that this album was recorded almost thirty years ago! If you are a fan of Plant's vocal style or just a fan of good music, give it a go, it is a near perfect modern rock record.
0446677450|1.0|I have to agree with the negative reviews. I read a few chapters in this book before I got bored and gave up. One funny thing the author says is NOT to buy a home. Geez, I guess all of those homeowners must be stupid then, buying a home and seeing the value rise so fast, especially in the recent housing boom. <br /> <br />Kiyosaki has now teamed with Trump, an egotistical guy who thinks he knows business and such. Please save your money and don't buy this book.
0307236722|3.0|I purchased the book based upon \\"Ms. Perfect's\\" reputation.  The first recipe I tried was for Baguettes on page 312.  The bread was so salty it had to be thrown out.  The recipe indicates 1 1/2 tablespoons of salt.  In retrospect I'm sure it should be 1 1/2 teaspoons.  I wrote to Martha, thinking she would want to know. (yeah, right).  The form letter I got back was about cooking at different altitudes.  It was obvious my email had not even been read.  What was even more interesting to me was the line (probably in all her form letters) that read,\\"The recipe is correct\\".  I wrote the publisher who indicated my letter would be forwarded to the editor.  I have heard nothing back.  The book looks great and I would assume that the vast majority--maybe even all the other recipes--are correct.
B0009SOFGI|5.0|...and it shows on his original mix on the second disc of this set. What he did get, however, was a disembodied sense of art house sound the Stooges could produce. Unlike Todd Rundgren's total savaging of the initial New York Dolls album, Cale at least has a sense of art and edge. The original mixes have a spooky spaciness that, while robbing the meat essence of the Stooge sound, delivers a fascinating portal into a new hearing of several of these songs. While the final approved Cale production is hardly the way the Stooges were meant to be heard (see Fun House), at least Ron Asheton's guitars are allowed to rise and shine. He wasn't going to give Ron the courtesy of a hearing on the first mixes, so thank the Holzman gods we got what we eventually got. And dig the extended cuts - Ann is an Asheton playground. Oh, that's what that song was all about! Play this whole thing loud. The Ramones did. And let's face it, there wouldn't be any Ramones without this Stooges album.
B000002B2T|4.0|Like so, soooooo many of us these days, I am tired of the absolute trash the record companies continually put out on a daily basis. Desperate to add SOMETHING new to my collection - some music that actually had meaning or depth - I went to my local record store to find anything at all that was from the early 90s period (or newer bands along the vein of Tantric or Days of the New, etc). I asked the worker there if he had anything from the grunge movement of the early 90s. I said I really liked Alice in Chains, and so he suggested Mad Season. I had never heard of them. I bought the album and played it once or twice. It may not have been new music (after all, the album is 11 years old as of this writing), but it was new to me. At first I wasn't all that impressed. There are no mega-hits on this album. And as good as the album is as a whole, it still feels like a side project in many respects. Nevertheless, after some time went by I decided to give the CD a few more spins, and that's when I really started to appreciate the album. It has really become a diamond in the ruff for me.  <br /> <br />\\"Wake Up\\" is the best song on the album. It takes you to an emotional place like few songs can. We can feel Staley's pain on this track as he growls and bellows out the chorus. You want to reach out to him and share his pain - that's where this song will take you. It's touching in a way. It is such a shame that his life was stopped short before he could make even more great music. \\"River of Deceit\\" is the other great song, with lyrics like \\"My pain is self-chosen.\\" Songs 1 to 7 are all good. Track 8, \\"Long Gone Day,\\" is okay, but it seems to fall flat in the end. Tracks 9 and 10 are instrumentals, with some singing at the end of track 9. Niether of the instrumentals did anything for me. They don't add to the album in the way that AIC's \\"Whale and Wasp\\" - one of the best alternative/rock instrumentals on the planet - did on their Jar of Flies EP. Because of tracks 8, 9 and 10 I give this CD 3.75 stars out of 5. <br /> <br />Overall I would definitely recommend you pick up this CD. Because if you haven't heard it yet, and if you then purchase it, you may realize like I did that this is the reason you still listen to music in the first place. It's not perfect, but just give it more than a couple spins and I promise you won't be disappointed.
B000ILZ67S|2.0|Some of the other Alex Rider books may have been a little predictable, but Ark Angel is by far the worst book in the series.  As if someone with a cheesy tattoo of the world covering their head isn't bad enough, this book really \\"jumps the shark\\", not only does Anthony Horowitz yet AGAIN use the \\"corrupt rich guy\\" plot (this may have something to do with his childhood . . .), but at the end of the book Alex gets launched into space.  Save your $15 and buy Maximum Ride by James Patterson or a Scott Westerfeld book instead.

B000002I6T|4.0|Flush from their rabid success as Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, each artist took a solo trip to find themselves.  Actually, Neil Young had already begun to establish his solo career with one mediocre ('Neil Young'), and one outstanding ('Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere') solo excursion by the time Crosby got around to this effort; Stephen Stills had released his magnificent self-titled solo disc the year previous, and Crosby's closest partner, Graham Nash, released the surprisingly diverse 'Songs For Beginners' in the same year as this Crosby disc.  In all honesty, Crosby's album is the weakest in the bunch, save Young's self-titled debut.  But that's not necessarily a bad thing... and this is certainly not a bad album.  In fact, all four of these artists were in the throes of virtuosity at this point in their careers, so a poor production from any one of them was implausible to say the least. <br /> <br />Crosby certainly knows where his strength lies... in his composing and vocal talents, and he does little to wander outside of that box, and much to supplement his shortcomings.  His bandmates for this disc read like a Who's Who of 1960's West Coast rock.  While Stephen Stills' superb guitar skills are oddly absent, Cros' does tap the magic fingers of Neil Young, Jerry Garcia, Jorma Kaukonen (and the rest of Jefferson Airplane, including Grace Slick), and Phil Lesh on bass.  Add to that other luminaries of the psychedelic era such as drummer Mickey Hart, and vocalists Joni Mitchell and Gregg Rolie, and you have a studio full of first-rate performers.  While David handles the lions share of the composing duties, interesting collaborations with Young and Nash ('Music Is Love') and Young and Garcia on 'What Are Their Names' materialize. <br /> <br />And what about the songs?  The high points tend to be the more extended tracks, and since the tracks run between one and eight minutes in length, it's fortunate that the longest are also the best.  Track two, 'Cowboy Movie', is the grittiest song in the collection, very reminicent of Neil Young's 'Down By the River', though Young apparently didn't have a hand in the writing of the song, which meanders through a tale of a Western robbery and an encounter with an Indian woman.  The track was cut live, and is an early, rough mix of the song... but clearly a keeper.  The lyrics could be delivered with greater clarity, but not with comparable intensity, and intensity is one thing 'If Only I Could Remember My Name...' needs.  Crosby always had a soft spot for acoustic numbers, and what might be best describe as 'folk-scat' vocals, and there is an overabundance of these on the disc.  In fact, the next longest track, 'Song With No Words', arrives at a point in the disc where some hard rock of the 'Almost Cut My Hair' variety would be well-placed.  The song has a nice sound, but is then followed by the French a-capella opening of 'Orleans', and the Buddhist High Mass sounds of 'I'd Swear There Was Somebody Here', and we're overcome with acoustic overload.  David often falls into the trap of \\"music is wonderful because it's music\\", and the tail end of this disc is the mother of all Crosby punji pits.  Unfortunately, for some reason, David gave up the formula that cooked up the other tasty treats on the disc, such as the opener, 'Music Is Love', which is itself an acoustic ode to music, the fantastic guitar interplay on the instrumental 'Tamalpais High', and the dreamy 'Deja Vu'-like sound of 'Laughing', whose lyrics seem inspired by Crosby's 'Why' from The Byrds '5D' release.  'What Are Their Names', perhaps the only true protest song in the set, features the cosmic combination of Neil Young and Jerry Garcia trading guitar licks, and 'Traction In the Rain' comes off as a fine folk-blues trip.  The lyrics from 'Traction...', such as \\"It's hard for me to find a way, to get through another city day, without thinking about... getting out...\\", illustrate why Crosby's messages in words should neverbe undersold. <br /> <br />There is a great deal to like about 'If I Could Only Remember My Name...', but the disc also makes it apparent why Crosby seemingly was always in need of some accompaniment (usually found in the able talents of one Graham Nash).  The very best complement to Crosby's style, however, was always the brash and rugged persona of a Neil Young or a Stephen Stills, and that coarse edge, eventually, is simply AWOL from the disc.  Nevertheless, if you're a fan of Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, a trip down the aisle of David Crosby's solo work will illuminate your appreciation of the band as a working unit.  In fact, 'Laughing' and 'Traction In the Rain' became standards on the CSN&Y concert songlist.  Hear the originals here, along with other worthy fare.  This one leans more toward four stars than three. <br /> <br />
B000GFLE86|4.0|Madeleine Peyroux's occasionally acidic voice has drawn comparisons to Billie Holiday, which, while not entirely amiss, tended to overlook a singular facet of Holiday's style: When Holiday sounded like she was keeping something from you, it was because it hurt too much to be expressed. Peyroux's floating, Georgian-inflected alto, though similarly enigmatic (a \\"Mona Lisa voice,\\" wrote New York Times cabaret critic Stephen Holden), seems to barely conceal excessive happiness. <br />Take Half the Perfect World's opening track, \\"I'm All Right\\". She's dating a lout, who \\"makes her cry\\",  and who \\"threw a few of my things around\\", but it's all right, because she's been lonely before. <br />She sings it with resignation, but where Holiday, for all her strength, would've made you feel pity, Peyroux impresses you with her resilience. Consider it the postfeminist style of female jazz vocalism. <br />With its chunk-chunk guitar, brushed drums and B3 organ, the stage is set for Peyroux to lay down a soft-focus album--and she does. The title track, by Leonard Cohen, is turned into a soft samba, and Joni Mitchell's \\"River\\" is sung with k.d. lang, who doesn't steal the spotlight. <br />In a world clogged with mediocre jazz chanteuses--with the dreaded Norah Jones at the front of the line--Peyroux's soul and melting voice stand out, way out, from the pack. She remains a happy enigma. <br /> <br />
B000H6SXLU|4.0|For several reasons, this is the comparatively hidden entry in the classic Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers filmography, but this 1935 film has been blissfully released in a fairly clean print transfer on DVD, both as an individual purchase and as part of a complete Astaire-Rogers DVD set. With great songs from the Jerome Kern songbook, the movie certainly contains the high-caliber musical quality of the other films starring the dancing pair. The challenge is really in the cumbersome story set-up and in the simple fact that Astaire and Rogers play decidedly secondary characters in the story.<br /><br />The film's primary focus is on Stephanie, an exiled Russian princess working as a sales assistant in the House of Roberta, the most fashionable couturi&egrave;re in all of Paris. It is run by a lovable dowager referred to as Aunt Minnie, whose nephew Jack Kent ends up in Paris after his band gets fired right after they disembark from their transatlantic voyage. Astaire plays Jack's best friend, bandleader \\"Huck\\" Haines, and Rogers is a faux-Polish countess named Sharvenka a.k.a. Lizzie Gatz, Huck's ex-dancing partner who has become a Paris nightclub headliner. The various romantic pairings occur, but an unexpected tragedy strikes with Minnie's death and her wish to leave the shop to the woefully unqualified Jack, who of course needs Stephanie's fashion sense to make the company continue to thrive.<br /><br />The plot threads start to feel unwieldy after a while, but journeyman director William A. Seiter is smart enough to know when to include the musical interludes. Astaire-Rogers fans may be disappointed to find them dance only twice in the film together, the first well after the half-hour mark in an informal but energetic tap routine and the second near the end in their standard formal wear. Astaire has only one solo to \\"I Won't Dance\\"; and perhaps to pacify fans, there is a brief reprisal dance inserted after the story's actual ending though dramatically it makes little sense. Irene Dunne gets to sing four songs - a Russian lullaby and three Kern gems (\\"Yesterdays\\", \\"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\\" and \\"Lovely to Look At\\") - in her bell-like operatic soprano, pretty in itself but seemingly at odds with the jazzy sound of the rest of the score.<br /><br />A year before she let her inner screwball comedienne emerge in \\"Theodora Goes Wild\\", a severe-looking Dunne is saddled with a stiff, uninteresting part as Stephanie, and she is not aided much by a bumptious Randolph Scott, who has to play the somewhat ignorant and judgmental Jack on a relative one note. Astaire and a particularly funny Rogers, on the other hand, are breezy and sharp with the little screen time they do get. Little-remembered Claire Dodd predictably plays Jack's slithery fianc&eacute;e Sophie, while character actress Helen Westley plays Minnie with her amusing gruffness intact (she was to reunite with Dunne the next year in James Whale's classic version of \\"Showboat\\").<br /><br />There's an extended fashion show at the end, and you can easily spot a bleached blonde, baby-faced Lucille Ball in ostrich feathers among the models. The resulting movie shows the whole to be somewhat less than the sum of its parts, but it's still worthwhile for the talent involved in the production. The 2006 DVD contains some interesting curios as extras - the original trailer (in relatively poor condition); a full-color twenty-minute 1935 musical short, \\"Starlit Days the Lido\\", with oddly attired variety acts entertaining bemused Hollywood stars like Clark Gable and Robert Montgomery; a vintage cartoon, \\"The Calico Dragon\\" about a little girl's dream of her stuffed animals coming to life to protect her from the dragon; and an eleven-minute audio-only radio promo for the movie.s to sing four songs - a Russian lullaby and three Kern gems (\\"Yesterdays\\", \\"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\\" and \\"Lovely to Look At\\") - in her bell-like operatic soprano, pretty in itself but seemingly at odds with the jazzy sound of the rest of the score.

1896597890|5.0|This got 5 stars from me not because it was a grand masterpiece, but because I found it to be unique and very well put together.  Reading through Delisle's graphic novel, I felt myself transported to North Korea, quiet and alone in a hotel and throwing airplanes out the window.  The book has a wonderful balance between a look at what North Korea is actually like and what it's like to be a guest in the country.  Appropriate uses of humor and seriousness where applicable also left me feeling as though I got my money's worth.  For depth on the history and nature of North Korea, I recommend \\"North Korea Through The Looking Glass\\".  For a light read that will leaving you with a sense of familiarity with both the author and the country, this is definitely the way to go.

B000H6SXLU|3.0|If you want to see Paris fashions in 1935, Fred and Ginger's (F&G) third film is the place to see it. Among all F&G movies, the plot is more sophisticated and dramatic and less comedic. Ginger plays an act within her role: not just the sassy American blonde but also the sophisticated Russian Comtess. She even sings \\"I'll Be Hard to Handle\\" with a Russian accent. In that same number, F&G communicate with each other not with words but by taps on their feet. Almost every speaking actor/actress has a three-dimensional personality especially Roberta/Aunt Minnie (Helen Westley) and Johnny (Candy) Candido with his voice performances. However, Stephanie (Irene Dunn) has an excellent singing voice but is overrated and should not have been top billed. As a side note, if you pay attention, look for Lucille Ball as one of the fashion models (uncredited).<br /><br />In the vintage short \\"Starlit Days at the Lido\\" guests enjoy outdoor entertainment. Reginald Denny takes you through celebrity introductions and various performances, including one neat trick where a girl keeps pulling cigarettes from nowhere. (1935, Color, Run Time 19:16)<br /><br />In the classic cartoon \\"The Calico Dragon\\" a little girl reads a fairy tale about a dragon, then falls asleep. She dreams that three of her dolls, a boy, a horse, and a terrier, enter the land of calico to slay a three-headed calico dragon. Good use of that pattern. (1935, Color, Run Time 7:57)<br /><br />The \\"Hollywood on the Air Radio Promo\\" is just what it says. It is just like a theatrical trailer for a movie except it is audio only, complete with crackles, pops, and varying playing speeds. A narrator pitches the movie and introduces you to excerpts directly from it, including \\"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes,\\" \\"I'll Be Hard to Handle,\\" \\"Lovely to Look At,\\" and \\"I Won't Dance.\\" (Mono, Run Time 11:55)<br /><br />Theatrical Trailer (Run Time 2:56)
B000FTWB7G|3.0|I am a big fan of 'Fallen'. All the songs in that album, in my opinion, can sell very very well as singles. Naturally I was very enthusiastic of their new album.  <br />There are some reviews here that bash Evanescence as a one-hit wonder, and there are some that praises 'The Open Door' as another multi-platinum hit. The truth is somewhere in the middle there. Look at the sale price of this album : $9.72. Fallen, which is 3 years old, is still selling for that much. That should tell you something about the quality of the music.  <br />I listened to the whole album a few times, and honestly there are only a few tracks that I really like. I think this is a good album, not as good as 'Fallen', but the split between Ben and Amy definitely affects the tone and quality of the music. I wish they are still together.  <br />Terry, which I'm sure is a great guitarist, puts too much emphasis on guitar play in this album, and that sometimes pushes the song itself to the background.  <br />I'm still a big fan of Evanescence, and yet how I wish Ben would come back to the band.
B00002ND77|5.0|I have two favorite movies of all time, and this is one of them.  This is a film that every man (black or white, but especially black) should and needs to see.  I was just telling my husband the other day that Malcolm X in my opinion, represented in every way what it meant to be a black man in America.  From pimping and number-running to becoming one of the most influential black men of our time, If I was granted a wish to bring someone back to this earth, it would surely be him.  I truly believe that had he lived another 30 or 40 years, he would have reshaped the role of black men.  He had the intelligence and the charisma to bring about the necessary change that the black community needs today starting with our men.  People respected and admired him, but at the same time others choose to look down on him, for standing up for what he believed in. As much as he tried to empower the black race, to instill any hope of integrity and self-worth in his people, ultimately it cost him his life.  What I admired most about him, was although he had been betrayed, he overcame his hostilities and anger, and continued to fight for justice and equality. He overcame his fear of the unknown, racism, and bigotry.  Spike Lee did an amazing job bringing to life his story, and Denzel Washington portrayed him such a way, that he became Malcom X without flaws.  This is without a doubt Spike Lees Best!!
B000HEWEJO|4.0|For some strange reason paramount added colors only to the cover and dvd menus. Good they stopped right there. Be assured, the movie is very much in Black And White only. Saw the screencaps from the dvd on a website. Not really sure if they have colorised version on the disc but the orginal B/W is certainly there.    Good news is this transfer is superior than the previous version released by Republic Studios. Unfortunately there are no new extras on the disc. Just the same 'Making of' and 'Tribute to Capra' featurettes which appeared on the previous release too.    Unfortunately, a true christmas classic such as this one still remains just another cash-in for studios like Paramount else there was absolutely no reason why they couldnt have given this a real special edition treatment.

B0002CHIJW|4.0|I first saw this in 1984 as a teenager.  The video tape was probably the cut version. It left an impression on me because of the awful scenes, but I remember thinking how brilliant Camille Keaton was in her role as the  victim. Very convincing. Seeing the uncut DVD version recently, as an adult, I still find the film disturbing but not in the way so many do.  It is often referred to as the video nasty, brutal and disgusting.  Released back in 1978, the film did poorly at the box office until they renamed it to \\"I spit on your grave\\".  One has to feel that the new title helped push the movie to being banned. It drew so much attention to it.  By today's standards, and if you compare it to a film such as 2003's \\"Irreversible\\", the film isn't as difficult to sit through as some would have you believe. Yes, the rape scenes are awful, but look beyond that, and the film does have other key merits like the brilliant acting from Camille, beautiful cinematography, and the tension building scenes. <br /> <br />What happens in this film, unfortunately, occurs in real life over and over.  The Director made the film after helping a lady who had been raped and saw her crawling out of the bushes. The film was his way of getting back at her victims. <br /> <br />Look beyond the rape scenes, and you will see a film of courage and revenge.  The fact that so many people talk about this film indicates that the Director has succeeded in his mission. To remind us of the nastiness that goes on in this world, and that we should fight it. <br /> <br />Definitely worth a viewing.
B0007TKH66|4.0|Many fans hated this show, a prequel to the original \\"Star Trek\\" telling the story of Earth's first starship and the foundation of Starfleet and the Federation.  It was castigated for violating established chronology and rehashing storylines.  I agree with those criticisms but also found much to enjoy as well.  I felt that the retro-look of the show was done successfully, the cast was very good, and I enjoyed the tensions between the humans, the Vulcans, and the Andorians.  In overall quality, this series still ranks below DS9, the Next Generation, and the Original Series but still provides many enjoyable moments.

It does an admirable job of pulling dialogue directly from the book itself while still managing to smooth the rough edges that can often appear when the written word is adapted for the screen, which in the end leaves avid fans giddy and thoroughly satisfied. <br /> <br />I've found that the complaint most have with this adaptation is that Timothy Dalton is far too handsome to portray the plain and rugged Edward Fairfax Rochester.  I thought so too initially when he made his appearance on the screen (I could hardly believe for one minute that any woman in her right mind would scorn someone as handsome as Dalton), but the more I watched, the more I realized that, while perhaps handsome enough that in normal circles he would turn a few heads, he still carries a ruggedness to him that projects the gruff, wounded feelings Mr. Rochester is so infamous for.  But I think what finally made me a believer with Dalton was the performance he gave, physical appearances notwithstanding.  I have never, and I mean never, seen an actor capture every aspect of Mr. Rochester's character so perfectly.  Dalton can be at once both calm and poised and violently passionate, befitting Bronte's dark and troubled hero.  He was just excellent.  I can't get enough of his performance. <br /> <br />And Zelah Clarke's portrayal of Jane was not without merit either.  Perhaps it wasn't as earth-shattering (in my opinion) as Dalton's, but she still managed to capture the essence of Jane's character.  I appreciated the way she balanced calm with passion, since that is what I believe makes Jane so endearing; her ability to be modest and quiet, but also inwardly burning with fire and zest for life.   <br /> <br />In short, I loved this adaptation of \\"Jane Eyre\\".  The romance was perfectly done, with passion as well as reservation (befitting both the era and the characters), and I applaud the actors for this since in other adaptations such scenes as the garden when Rochester proposes I've felt the characters were either too cold toward each other or too hot and unrealistic.   <br /> <br />Well done.  I can't say it enough. <br /> <br />Well done.
B000002GQJ|5.0|Welcome to \\"core seven\\" album number five as seen through my eyes.  This is the one that takes us into the 70s, but the band is still constant in their peace loving and deeply introspective themes.<br /><br />You will recall (Those of you who are younger, anyway.) that the Vietnam war still wouldn't be over for a few more years, so we are naturally given a lively spiritual awakening from the start with Justin Hayward's \\"Question.\\"  It's true what he says about people being greedy to this day, even in their most seemingly honest and goodhearted searches:  \\"All the love you've been giving has all been meant for you.\\"  In a sense, he has answered his own questions about \\"hate and death and war.\\"  Human beings are utterly selfish and see their own way as the right one no matter what anyone else says.<br /><br />\\"How is it We are Here,\\" Mike Pinder's followup track to \\"Question\\" seems to address an even darker side of man as we destroy the environment for our own needs in the midst of a starving world.  To this day, what's new?<br /><br />\\"And the Tide Rushes in,\\" is Ray's rather depressing, yet beautiful, take on how people destroy each other's dreams like \\"the tide rushes in and washes my castles away,\\" and yet he observes that a blackbird can find joy in watching acorns grow.  It seems we can learn a lot from nature if we take the time.<br /><br />\\"Don't You Feel Small\\" is a completely relatable Graeme Edge song.  \\"Look at progress, then count the cost.\\"  We are destroying our world simply by denying our own foolish part in letting someone else care.  \\"Who's the biggest fool of all\\" indeed, but we have the choice to wake up now because \\"time's to come there'll be no choice at all.\\"<br /><br />\\"Tortoise and the Hare\\" is, if I'm guessing correctly, John Lodge's commentary on the hares having it too easy so that they get lazy and lose the race because the turtle's who've always had it hard kept right on working hard until they win.  That's a good concept to consider if you have to work for everything you have.<br /><br />Justin Hayward's \\"It's Up to You\\" is basically a very straight forward and honest song with an addictive melody about making good choices and thinking for yourself.  One begins to see as the album goes on the shift from frustration to optimism and hope.  It's balancing itself out, lending cadence the the album title's concept.<br /><br />\\"Minstrel's Song\\" is always among my favorite John Lodge songs, as he seems to have borrowed a bit from Ray's often childlike and sweet, simple melodies.  \\"Listen to the one who sings of love.\\"  It is sweet, singalong-ish, and stays in your head for hours at a time.  It is a lovely sentiment and not heard often enough in this day and age of angry bands.<br /><br />\\"Dawning is the Day\\" is also one of my favorite Hayward songs because it's easy to personally relate to being so lost that you often need others to help you find yourself.  How often do you feel like that soul in the meadow?  \\"Wake up in the morning to yourself.  Open your head and look around you.  Listen, we think we have found you.\\"  Sometimes all you need is to get away from everything and take a step back as well, just letting go of everything.<br /><br />One of Mike Pinder's most depressing and deeply moving songs has to be \\"Melancholy Man.\\"  It is amazing how the differences in people's viewpoints can have such a devastating effect on those who don't agree.  In fact, it is sad that Pinder was so moved to write something that is so devastatingly true.  You can't even argue with what makes his observations so well-phrased:  \\"Another man is what you'll see who looks like you and looks like me, and yet somehow he will not feel the same.  His life is caught in misery.  He doesn't think like you and me 'cause he can't see what you and I can see.\\"  Approach this song with caution, because it is the most depressing track on here.<br /><br />I love the closer, Graeme Edge's \\"The Balance.\\"  This consists of some of his mostbeautiful hippie-logic-meets-the-Bible wisdom with the story of any man (ie, any one of us) and the way he learns to correct his own attitude toward others by realizing he is not perfect either and learns to forgive out of compassion and love:<br /><br />\\"He thought of those he angered--for he was not a violent man<br /><br />And he thought of those he hurt--for he was not a cruel man<br /><br />And he thought of those he frightened--for he was not an evil man<br /><br />And he understood...he understood himself.\\"<br /><br />Edge also stresses that this is nothing new:  \\"Just open your eyes and realize the way it's always been.\\"<br /><br />This is where the album balances itself out after its many moods and contemplations.  I find this to be among the strongest of the core seven because the concept of the album lives up to its title and is only disappointing in slight ways that don't matter enough for me to give it a lower rating.  There are some Moodies albums I'm still not sure of and some I know I dislike without completely hating, and then there are those that deserve to be a part of your Moodies collection.  With no hesitation, A Question of Balance should be one of them.of some of his most beautiful hippie-logic-meets-the-Bible wisdom with the story of any man (ie, any one of us) and the way he learns to correct his own attitude toward others by realizing he is not perfect either and learns to forgive out of compassion and love: <br /> <br />\\"He thought of those he angered--for he was not a violent man <br />And he thought of those he hurt--for he was not a cruel man <br />And he thought of those he frightened--for he was not an evil man <br />And he understood...he understood himself.\\" <br /> <br />Edge also stresses that this is nothing new:  \\"Just open your eyes and realize the way it's always been.\\" <br /> <br />This is where the album balances itself out after its many moods and contemplations.

B00008LDPU|4.0|Over all great movie(s), however, in my opinion the live action movies are better.
B00007K02F|4.0|Oddly enough the Charlotte Brontë's classic novel 'Jane Eyre' has had more cinematic transitions than almost any of the old novels.  The story is powerful but with the frequency of film adaptations, even the story grows tired, unless someone breathes new life into the interpretation.  In this case that breath comes from director Franco Zeffirelli who has engaged Hugh Whitemore to open the story as a screenplay.  The results give a different emphasis to the story and one that for this viewer works well.<br /><br />In this particular incarnation the rags to riches heroine Jane Eyre is played with subtlety by the beautiful Charlotte Gainsbourg (with Anna Paquin as the younger version) and Rochester the master of the manor is a William Hurt, playing his character more for life and flesh than the usual darkly sinister keeper of secrets.  What results from the combination of cast and crew is a film that is far more a romance than a vapid mystery:  the fire between Jane and Rochester is palpable and is given more space and time than the other versions which elect to dwell on the mad 'wife' upstairs finally destroyed in the fire that brings Rochester down to Jane's initial stance on the social scale.<br /><br />The cinematography by David Watkin captures the period beautifully as does the musical score by Claudio Capponi and Alessio Vlad.  As with all period pieces the cast of supporting characters paint the various aspects of the novel and here such luminous actors as Joan Plowright, Geraldine Chaplin, Jos&eacute;phine Serre, Maria Schneider, Elle Macpherson, and John Wood among many others offer fully realized portraits of the class distinctions that ruled the era.  This is a fine film version of the Brontë novel and one well worth watching repeatedly.  Grady Harp, October 06
0743298020|5.0|This book is great.  If you love the art of storytelling this book is for you.  It's not one of those books that you have to read the first hundred pages of to get hooked.  You enjoy reading it through entirely.
0618477942|5.0|I normally don't read graphic novels; I'm glad I read this. A simply powerful memoir of growing up and attempting to understand one's life. entertaining and soulfull, you can't go wrong with this.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|I absolutely adore this movie. It is a fantastic tale, full of wonder and beauty, exquisite in detail and poignant. The dicotomy of the stark reality of the main character's plight, dying, and his ability to produce so much joy and life in his storytelling is, in short, inspirational. <br /> <br />Watching the interaction between him and his son, who has his two feet firmly buried in the ground is touching. The positioning of the wide eyed, open minded darling of a daughter in law between the two of them was excellent juxtaposition. The son's realization of the truth in his fathers rather far-fetched tales at the end brought tears to my eyes. <br /> <br />It was a joy to watch, I have seen it several times and never tire of it. The sweetness in this tale gives hope that the beauty of imagination will continue to exist. I cannot say enough. <br /> <br />Seeing this movie warms my soul.  <br /> <br />
B000FTWB7G|5.0|When I heard that Evanescence had a new CD coming out, I freaked.  I told my best friend and she was just as excited as I was.  I pre-ordered this CD and waited anxiously for it's release and arrival.  I must say that I am NOT AT ALL disappointed with this purchase.  I've listened to this CD almost every day and know every song by heart.  There is a difference between this CD and \\"Fallen\\", but I find that it's a good difference.  Amy Lee's voice is absolutely incredible.  The songwriting is beautiful.  I especially like \\"Lithium\\", \\"Like You\\", and \\"Your Star\\".  This CD always puts me in such a good mood when I'm in a bad mood.  Out of my almost 200 CDs, this one is by far my favorite.  I would definitely recommend this CD to any Evanescence fan!!
B00005JO9J|5.0|I am very happy with my purchase.  I received it within the timeframe Amazon quoted me.  I will definately purchase from them again.
B00006L9ZT|5.0|I saw this production in person, and it was a wonderful experience.  If you aren't familiar with Wagner's Ring cycle, or you know the music but haven't seen it, this box set is definintely your best bet.  It doesn't have any political or artistic agenda - it mostly follows what was called for originally.  My impression in the audience was that this is what it would have looked like if you saw Nordic mythology taking place.  And Nordic mythology is the ostensible topic of these operas, you can decide for yourself whether you're interested in possible subtexts.  None of this is to say that this production doesn't have depth or subtlety, or that it's \\"stodgy.\\"  Staging the Ring is a big undertaking, and this was a fantastic realization of that endeavor, with great attention to detail.  It's visually very pleasing - and the Ring was meant to be seen as well as heard.  Whether or not it's the exact cast that everyone would want, all the performers in this production were world-class.
B000HCO83Q|1.0|Even the people on here who are giving this movie a less than stellar review are being too kind to this flick. Yes, we are all X-Men fans and we wanted to like this film but let's face it: This sucked. I hate sitting there after a movie and realizing that some dumb schmuck director just stole two hours of my time. Others have said what's wrong with the film but have gone easy on it. I won't. Don't waste your time. This director owes us a do-over.
B000A2W1X2|4.0|This is a beautiful movie, with appealing main characters and an engrossing and unusual storyline. I find that as I get older my attention has a tendency to wander, so it's a real testament that this kept me glued to the screen to find out how everything would play out. <br /> <br />An English gentleman is married to a wife who, following a riding accident, has slipped into a vegetative state. His father, the current lord, is busily squandering the family fortunes. In the midst of all this sadness and worry, the gentleman decides he wants to have a child, so with the help of his housekeeper, he interviews potential surrogate mothers. The one he chooses is a lovely, impoverished Swiss governess (the luminous Sophie Marceau) who agrees to the deal in order to bail her own father out of financial difficulties. Once the child is born, she is taken away from the mother and given over to the care of the father.  The agreement is that they will never meet again. But the Swiss governess deeply regrets giving up her baby, and by the time the child is seven, she manages to track her down and gets herself hired on as a governess. Once there, she finds that the child's father has spoiled her rotten, and she sets out to right the situation, of course falling in love with her child's father in the process. <br /> <br />The love scenes are passionate and engrossing, without ever stepping over the line into prurience (far more interesting than anything on late night Cinemax!). The way the plot plays out is deeply interesting. Of course, I found myself thinking as the movie drew to a close that some of the situations were dealt with in a rather anti-climactic fashion (you'd think that there would be a bit more drama surrounding the jilted sister-in-law and the swim through an icy lake, plus if it were me, I think I'd be a bit more upset if I found out my mother had sold me for five hundred pounds even if she did come looking for me afterwards), but all in all, a very satisfying andsexy movie. Well worth your time.
1896597890|5.0|First: A comment on the professional reviews.<br /><br />The Publishers Weekly review up above does not accurately catch the flavor of this book. The Booklist review is on the money. The Publishers Weekly review gives you the impression that the book is a good-humored look at a different culture from the perspective of a Westerner. The reviewer misses the point entirely. On the 2nd page, Delisle shows how he snuck in a copy of George Orwell's \\"1984\\" (a banned book in North Korea) - any moderately well-read person can identify the constant presence of the photos of \\"The Great Leader\\" and \\"The Dear Leader\\" with Orwell's omnipresent \\"Big Brother\\". It is intended to be a bit of foreshadowing to tell the reader where he is going with the book - and he hits a home run with it! This is an anti-communist triumph from beginning to end - not with the soaring rhetoric of a Kennedy or a Reagan, but rather with its gentle story-telling style and its simple emphasis on communism's absurdities - from the lack of information, to the lack of food, electriciity and choices of what to watch on TV and listen to on the radio. The constant barrage of revolutionary songs and the presence of \\"volunteers\\" who sweep an empty 4 lane highway to nowhere with straw brooms are perfect illustrations of the bizarre nature of both communism and North Korea.<br /><br />I first heard about this book from an interview on NPR. Unfortunately, the NPR reviewer had only done about as much reading as the Publishers Weekly and hadn't really figured out what the book was all about. So, I was not expecting much more than a lightweight travelogue in graphic novel form about a cotnroversial country. Instead, I was pleased to see that it was that and so much more. This is one not to miss.<br /><br />I give this one a score of A+!
0618680004|5.0|The best argument (or collection of arguments) ever put forward about why we must reject all forms of religion. All of his points and coherent and well argued, and every attempt at a rebuttal from the theistic community I've seen has been completely flawed or misinformed. Dawkins' work is a rallying call for all those who see the terrible damage that religion has inflicted and is still inflicting on humankind. The chapter on how religious indoctrination of children is a form of abuse is particularly enlightening. Everyone should read this book.
B000002JSN|5.0|This is a record that a ten year old me frequently escaped to. It conjured up mythic landscapes and mystic places that resided in my young imagination. There were times I felt as though I was moving upward to the sun and being consumed by its Brilliant Light. Could these \\"fantasies\\" have triggered a fascination with the spiritual...the mystical...the unexplainable in later years?<br /><br />I think we all know the answer.<br /><br />My mother passed away in January of 1975. One month prior to the release of this masterpiece which I received as a birthday present for my 10nth birthday in March. My mother was a classical pianist as well as violinist and I'm sure that she would've greatly appreciated this album for its sweeping and breathtaking arrangements. I have often said that if it wasn't for Led Zeppelin, Mad Magazine, and certain substances that allowed me to see through the veil of the seen and the unseen, I would've probably grown up \\"normal\\". I would've probably had a 9-5 job and had lots of money in the bank, and the best of everything, but no depth of soul...no Inner Light to guide my thoughts and feelings by...and all those things that I might have accrued in my seemingly \\"normal existence\\" would've just proven hollow and insignificant.<br /><br />Fortunately, I had this album to lose myself in. Fortunately, I was drawn to things that seemed to almost guarantee the happy fact that I am strange, weird, and totally happy inwardly and outwardly and it is this gratefulness...this deep appreciation...this sincere joy that I have for my life that draws even more good my way.<br /><br />This album is probably my favorite. It is probably their most powerful statement of what they were able to do musically as well as magically. From John Bonham's thunderous drumming, to Jimmy Page's fantastic guitar work, to John Paul Jones thoughtful bass licks, to Robert Plant's soulful wailing, it is a mystical masterpiece that belongs in EVERY audiophile's collection.<br /><br />Peace & Blessings.
B00005JPAM|5.0|We really didn't need any further proof that Helen Mirren is one of the greatest actresses alive, but yet again she proves that to be true with her performance in \\"The Queen.\\" The film itself uses the death of Princess Diana as a metaphor for the modernization of the UK. Tony Blair (a brilliant Michael Sheen), in convincing HM Elizabeth II to make unprecedented showings of grief to the public, illuminates the UK's gradual distancing from the overly strict traditions of the monarchy and into a new, more Republic type of society. The Queen is aware of this, and through Mirren's nuanced performance we see the Sovereign shift from a protocol-following figurehead to a more accepting and approachable woman. The whole movie of course rests on Helen Mirren, and she in turn is incredible- warm (to a point), witty, fiercely regal and independent, she oozes integrity. The movie itself was brilliant in using a very recent historical event to illuminate the changing culture(s) in one of the oldest and strictest countries on Earth. It's impossible not to be impressed.
B00002E224|5.0|To me great film/art is that which helps us understand what it is like to be a human being.  This GREAT film shows us what it is like to be 24 or so and fall in love while walking around Vienna. <br /> <br />This is a SEAMLESS, FLAWLESS movie.  Before Sunset is perhaps just as good. WOW.
B000GY729M|4.0|People are being incredibly harsh on the Killers for this album.  Its a genuinely good album.  Its different from Hot Fuss but the songs on this album are actually more sophisticated.  \\"When we were young\\" is the \\"Mr. Brightsides\\" equivalent but it is more mature and more well rounded in terms of the music surrounding the song.  The band has a different sound than on Hot Fuss.  The album has a Queen-meets-Franz-Ferdinand quality, but if you listen a few times, it actually works.  This is definitely not an album to throw away.  Its part of their evolution.  Unfortunately, I am afraid they may have lost too many fans with this album to keep it going strong.
B0009R1T7M|4.0|The song Chicago is probably worth the purchase price of this album. <br />I was in Bali in September 2006 and a local girl I met listened to that song on my MP3 player and cried because it moved her so much. I can understand the sentiment.
B000GW8RX4|4.0|Okay, I'm impressed! Yes, almost every one of these eight songs is at least twice or three times as long as it's original studio counterpart (except for Kill The King, which didn't have a studio counterpart) due to guitar solo, after guitar solo, after vocal improv, after keyboard solo, after guitar solo, after drum solo, after guitar smashing, etc. I mean, Still I'm Sad runs over 25 minutes!! As one other reviewer pointed out, this is a shame, for they could have easily cut half these solos out and replaced them with about another album's worth of songs, like Self Portrait, Light In The Black, Stargazer, Temple Of The King, etc.. At least they give the timing to each song on the back cover of the dvd, so you are forewarned of the long song lengths. Yet...<br /><br />This is the only official live video (or dvd) release of Rainbow when Ronnie James Dio was in the band, and I guarantee, early Rainbow fans will not be disappointed. The whole band, which consists of Blackmore, Dio, Cozy Powell, Bob Daisley and David Stone, are really in top form, especially Dio, who I think has never sounded better...before or since. He hits the high notes with confidence, doesn't use his growling monster voice too much, and just...well...sings the pudding out of these songs! Cozy Powell is an animal on the drums, and bassist Bob Daisley even does himself proud...not only does he play a mean bass guitar, he also provides some strong backing vocals. And Blackmore is his usual brilliant, but self indulgent self, tossing in snippets from classical pieces, like Ode To Joy and Beethoven's Ninth, into his guitar solos. David Stone plays well, though his long keyboard solos do nothing for me. The band really rocks out here, but they also play very well on the slower tunes, like Mistreated and Catch The Rainbow...my two favorite songs here, though I never was too fond of their original studio counterparts. If I was to pick out a favorite moment, it would one that was described in Roy Davies' book Rainbow Rising....during 'Do You Close Your Eyes', when the band goes back into the main part of the song earlier than Dio expected, prompting him to run on stage (with cigarette in hand, ouch!) and start singing into Bob Daisley's mike, which isn't turned on! The concert ends with Ritchie Blackmore's obligatory smashing of his guitar. I had a silly thought while watching this...wouldn't it be funny if he destroyed Daisley's bass guitar or Cozy Powell's drumkit instead?<br /><br />I think the overall mix is superb...you can hear all the instruments and Dio's voice is very upfront in the mix. I also have no problem with the visuals...for a made for TV concert that was done in the late 70's, the picture is pretty clear.<br /><br />The packaging for this and the special features are very good as well. The special features include a slideshow that comes with commentary, a picture gallery, and interviews with Bob Daisley and tour manager Colin Hart. The dvd comes with TWO booklets, one which describes the concert and gives a brief history of the band up until 1979, and the other which is the tour programme of the Long Live Rock-n-Roll tour. Both of these come with B&W and color pictures of the band.<br /><br />Overall, highly recommended, though I'm not sure I can watch the thing in one whole setting, from beginning to end.

B000002AQH|5.0|Schumann spent more than 10 years to compose this striking work: Early 1840's he wrote the final chorus on last scenes in Goethe's Faust (now Part  3). Following this he composed Part 1, which dealt with Gretchen's pray and  crime from Faust's Erster Teil. In 1850, he restarted the composition, then Faust's Zweites Teil on Faust's death (now Part 2): in which Schumann succeeded to set in music Faust's most famous words 'Verweile doch, du bist so sch&ouml;n!' (Pause the time, you are so beautiful). Just before his last illness Schumann completed this by writing an overture (1853). The performance and recording are both of the first rate, sufficient to break the superstition that Schumann's late music is nothing but waste. Simply hear this. There is a vastly encompassing great music.

B000001ESJ|5.0|The transistion albumn between conventianal hard edged gitar rock and Geddy's new talent of synthisised midi moogs.  Nice thing about the late 70's is both were in play in rock music.  The ancher of the hard gitars and the ethearic moogs and bass strums which were a bit more than just for volumn as in most bands.  Alex still playes gitars with a velocity and vigor rivaling other bands like Led Zepplin, Aerosmith, and Queen's tomfoolery \\"Byt'n the Dust\\".  Most of the sound is nulled out in the 80's by Geddy's synth and Neils percussive work.  But here the gitar playes the roll it should in additon, not subtraction to the more evolved high tech devices in the later part of the 1970's.  Cygnus X-1 uses gitars, not synth to make those unearthly sounds.  Only Xanadu actually uses Geddy's Moog with that Fargo sound later ringing in my ears in \\"Hemispeheres\\".

They, after all, are made of different carbon molecules than I am -- not just different ones -- different kinds! I am fossil fuel based. They are solar based. I am corn fed. They are grass fed. Still worse! There is little I can do about it to reverse course other than try to affect government policy. Shesh! How depressing. Thanks Mike!

B00005JPBJ|2.0|This review should really give this film 2.5 stars. I give it 2 because the average is far too high as it stands. <br /> <br /> I would have been willing to wait an extra year if the filmmakers could have come up with something better than this monument to human depravity. This film is disturbing -- alright, that's fine, shocking -- lovely, it's what we expect, but also something more. This film is depressing. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning, I have been a Saw fan. Ever since I saw the trailer for the first movie, I loved the concept, and went to see the film during its opening weekend. It was clever, the twist ending was fantastic, and a new horror icon was born. It was a psychological thriller as much as it was a horror movie. The traps were gruesome, yes, but they had a point. What made \\"Saw\\" a great movie was that the shocks had a point beyond shocking you. <br /> <br /> \\"Saw II\\" was a great surprise. The story was interesting, the characters were believeable, and the traps were stepped up a notch but still had a point. The infamous 'needle pit' will stand out in horror movie history. <br /> <br /> The first two movies were intelligent, well-thought-out horror movies. <br />  <br /> No longer. <br /> <br /> \\"Saw III\\" is depraved. The traps serve no purpose but to shock you. That is what I got out of the movie, which is fine on its own. \\"Saw III\\" on its own would stand head and shoulders above most horror movies. But I expected more from this film. \\"Saw\\" has degenerated into \\"Hostel\\" without any reason. I enjoyed \\"Hostel\\" because I got exactly what I was expecting -- basically, a snuff film. I expected something somewhat intelligent from \\"Saw III\\" because the other two were so innovative. \\"Saw III,\\" however, is not clever, is not intelligent, is forced, and commits suicide at the end. The twist ending that was *intended* is -- dare I say it? -- cliched. <br /> <br /> But the twist ending to this film is not what the filmmakers think it is. The real twist ending is that they've destroyed their series. The film is depressing. The movie's shocks don't retain a certain level of fun such as in the other two movies It keeps you on the edge of your seat, but for the wrong reasons. <br /> <br /> What happened? If you've seen the movie and wish to talk to me about it, e-mail me (or IM me) at apkkib@aol.com.
B00005JPBJ|5.0|I recently just saw this today. Luckily I got good seats (not many people were in the theater) and the film was just at the studio logos. This movie rocked! It was definitely the best out of all three SAW films.<br /><br />INTRODUCTION: SAW I and II came out in 2004 and 2005. The films both rocked, plus the endings were real cliffhangers!<br /><br />STORY: The film begins with Eric Matthews waking up in the bathroom. He breaks his own foot to escape, and Kerry and the others are investigating Troy. After the death of Kerry, Jigsaw is on his last legs. He is in his final hours of life with Cancer, and Amanda kidnaps a doctor named Lynn, and Lynn is to keep Jiggy alive while he is to see if his new test works out. The \\"test\\" revolves around Jeff Gordon, a man who is avenging his son. The people in the traps are people related to the death of Jeff's son.<br /><br />THOUGHTS: 2nd best film of the year! Hopefully this will top the box office. The best trap is the \\"pig carcass\\" trap. Plus, the ending has a HUGE twist.<br /><br />So go see this if you liked the other 2 SAWs!<br /><br />EDIT: 10/30/06<br />Let's not forget that S3 is number 1 at the box office and has grossed $34. 3 Million. Let's see if S3 can keep up!
6305078564|2.0|I want to echo the comments made in the previous review.  I saw this adaptation when it was first broadcast on TV and thought it was superb.  I was terribly disappointed by the DVD.  The color is dreadful.  All of the pale tones have become \\"hot\\" as if they were on film that was overexposed.  It's very distracting and really diminishes the quality of what was an otherwise excellent miniseries.  Very sad.
B000002KY8|1.0|I knew after 1983 things would never be the same with Rock and Roll ever again. The music was becoming more clean sounding with technology more or less replacing the majority of musicians. This would be one of the first ones. I remember hearing the first single from this which was \\"Little Red Corvette\\" I still say probably one of Prince's best songs, and the only other tune that's passible is \\"Let's Pretend We're Married\\". Everything else is horrible. The title track to me is a mindless, brainless dance tune, and I feel has no inadmissable value to life. Unfortunately, I guess the only way to get girls is to like this song. I also didn't take too much fancy to the other hit which was \\"Delirious\\". I am somewhat disappointed with this as to me Prince is a gifted performer, and plays a decent guitar, so why go technical? I just am appalled at the way music wound up, and it all started here.
0375830995|4.0|I wasn't familiar with this author & hadn't read \\"The Book Thief\\", but it was a surprisingly good read, even for adults (it's marketed to teens). Because the protagonist comes from a background outside of my experience, I couldn't relate well to his world. I also feel the other characters weren't developed enough - more like cardboard characters - but then, they weren't the main focus. What I did love was \\"the message\\" & how it drove the plot. Very clever & unusual.
B000I2J5UG|4.0|There is a lot of emotion in this album. You real get to see into the minds of someone in a lot of pain. In his last album he dealt a lot with demons and anti-war, and it seems to be a continuing trend, but on a lot more mature level. MCR is really trying to prove they are more than just another punk/pop emo band, they have substance. Breaking the mold, they really seem to successfully shake that stereotype.<br /><br />Very emotionally inept, the first track, \\"The End,\\" it takes place at a funeral, where the narrator reveals how he wants to not end up like the person who died, and either wants to be saved or end it now. The next track, \\"Dead!,\\" it continues the backwards cycle of the album, starting with the end, and going in reverse order. Later on, or should I say earlier, it appears someone he loved greatly that broke his heart had cancer, and now he is saying how this person's, probably female, most painful thing they did was start dying during the operation, and not able to hear him. This track is very important because you get the impression that he was never really mad at her, but that he loved her so much that he deserved better than to see her like this. He is so passionate that he questions life, and thinks of it as a joke from God, and that heaven is a place for the wicked.<br /><br />In the next track, we find out more about the situation. \\"This is How I Disappear\\" is about how he regrets what he did, and wishes that he never hurt the person he loved. This gives you the assumption that in the previous track, that he blames himself for her death. The emotion in this song is really great. He wants to be let go, so he can do no more harm, but is in the debacle that he can not leave her.<br /><br />In \\"The Shaprest Lives\\" he goes on to reveal his alcohol and drug problem and how he can break the habit, and doesn't want her to get caught in it. He is creating his own pain and downward spiral, but just like in his last cd with \\"Ghost of You,\\" he is constantly haunted by the demons of addiction.<br /><br />\\"Welcome to the Black Parade\\" I think is symbolic for rehab. In the song, his father showed him the door, but based on the other songs, it seems like he decided to not go, and it totally destroyed his life. The first single from the album, it is very powerful and remeniscent of \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" by Green Day, but without the commercial success.<br /><br />\\"I Don't Love You\\" is about how he is trying to justify why he doesn't deserve the girl. Him in his drunked state is very abusive and uncontrollable, and doesn't want to pull her into his darkness. He wants her to leave while she can, and uses this to push her away, when in reality, he needs her the most.<br /><br />I really didn't know what to make out of \\"House of Wolves.\\" My assumption would be that he's burying himself, and wants the angel of death to take him away for his bad sins. He repeats how he's going to burn in hell and wants to be taken to his grave to being his flaming afterlife.<br /><br />\\"Cancer\\" is probably one of the saddest songs I've ever heard. Very reminscent of \\"Hurt\\" by Nine Inch Nails, the song is describing how the most pain from his cancer is counting down the days until he leaves her. He's abandoned all hope at life, knows that he'll never get to do accomplish anything he ever wanted in life, and will end in a lot of pain before he could spend a lifetime with his girl.<br /><br />\\"Mama\\" is a very different pace for the album. It gives the assumption that he resents his mother for disowning him for being somehow involved in the war, and how if he was a girl, that the mother wouldn't have to disown her child. This song is very lyrically and musically different. Not one of my favorites.<br /><br />\\"Sleep\\" continues a theme of the people he loves not being able to let him go. He wants to just be given his final kiss and put to sleep to begin his enternal slumber. \\"Teenagers\\" is about how in the birth of your adulthood, people will begin trying to control you, make you a certain way. The song seems to get a lot of influence from Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall,\\" and Pink's struggle through life and inability to conform. \\"Disenchanted\\" is about how he is sick of being picked on and teased, called names.<br /><br />From this point in the album, the dots start connecting. You start to realize how his hellacious young adulthood was unbarable, and caused him to pick up habits that hurt him so much the ones he loved were harmed. The last track, \\"Famous Last Words\\" implies they were the last thoughts he had before the incident causing \\"The End.\\" This tracks makes the album come full circle, starting from the end, going to the beginning, and ending up back towards the end.<br /><br />Lyrically, I am beginning to see a step up in MCR, but musically, they still have a while to go. They are still in their young phase, their punk/pop phase, but with a more adult mindset. I really look forward to their next album and see how they will continue to evolve. A great album, but I think the best is just yet to come.od, people will begin trying to control you, make you a certain way.

B000FTWB7G|2.0|I don't like it. I try hard to digest how this group sells a lot. The tone of her heavy filtered voice is unacceptable and the compositions are totally uninspired. The repetition of nothing. <br />Some people think that this Evanescene thing is some special kind of music, when in real there are other groups out there far superior in this genre. <br /> <br />Try Listening to \\"The Gathering\\" from Holland. You will love Anneke's haunting voice.  <br />If you have normal hearing abilities and some taste in music or even better some adequate musical education you will see what I mean. <br /> <br />Give out your money to the best and not to the commercial super market forgetable nonsense that has been promoted by the companies.
0743289412|2.0|I can't believe I'm the only reviewer (so far anyway) who didn't like this book!  I'm a huge King fan and have read everything he's written.  Lisey's Story really didn't do anything for me and I didn't think it was particularly suspenseful, frightening or even romantic.  The \\"alternate/other world\\" storyline has been done, and done better, by other authors, such as Dean Koontz and even King himself!  I felt the storyline dragged for the most part and there wasn't anything that really grabbed me or made it hard for me to put this book down.  Sure, there were a few good parts, but in my opinion they were few and far between.  I also found myself getting very annoyed by the continual use of made up words and phrases such as smucking.  King has a pattern of doing this in his books and usually it's a relatively minor thing, but he over-does it in this book and it drove me crazy.  King should know by now that people's inside joke words usually aren't funny to others.<br /><br />Sad to say, I think the book cover art is the best part of this book and I'll just have to hope his next novel is better, because the past few have been substandard...
B000001FDQ|5.0|One of the must have CDs of Yngwie Malmsteen. Amazing solos and compositions. The second LP I bought, after listening to \\"Odyssey\\". <br />It was a magical experience, I must admit I didn't sleep well that summer nights, when I bought Malmsteen's LPs. I was spinning in my bed and my head was full of recurrent sound flashes of Yngwies solo-runs and arrpeggios. I couldn't sleep those first Malmsteen nights. Maximum Energy.  <br />Favourite Tracks: Practically Everything <br />Almost 100% Perfect Listening...Legendary NeoClassical Piece <br /> <br />TODAY'S RECOMMENDATION FOR VETERAN MALMSTEEN AFICIONADOS LIKE ME: <br />Please take a notice that music is evolving. The future was shaping and taking the form of a name of a brilliant artist. The name of SHAWN LANE.. <br /> <br />Don't you know him? Don't worry, neither i was aware of him (I am a Malmsteen aficionado since 1988!) This year and after his premature death his music came into my life and shocked me! <br /> <br />Exotic Scales @ hyperspeed & brilliant arpeggios make Yngwie a Top-Shredder for sure. But if one can (could play) fastest and more lyrical & difficult parts on the guitar this would be SHAWN LANE (+RIP) <br />Let me remind you that Yngwie uses economy picking, Shawn Lane had been alternate picking almost every note. Check him on youtube. SHAWN's solos cannot be played by any Yngwie.I have heard that Shawn had reached 18 notes/sec! Too bad he's gone. He had so much to give.

B00005JPBP|5.0|The Pledge:<br /><br />Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are ameteur magicians under the tutelage of a man named Cutter (Michael Caine). They all work together until one day a mishap with a water escape trick sees the death of Angier's wife who was an assistant in the act. Having previously debated over the use of various knots to tie up his wife, Angier suspects Borden of using one of the stronger knots he had forbidden. This causes an irrevocable rift between the two who end up becoming rival magicians. The obsessions of both men cause the rivalry to turn dangerous and eventually deadly. One of the first scenes of the film shows the death of one of the magicians so I'm not spoiling anything. The narrative then plays out as a combination of the aftermath where the remaining magician is on trial for the murder of the other as well as a series of flashbacks told through the other's journal that he reads while in prison.<br /><br />Borden was always the better magician by far, but he lacked the showmanship to really sell his performances. Angier driven by the anger of his wife's death becomes consumed with learning Borden's tricks. He's convinced that he can crush Borden as a magician with his superior showmanship if he had the same act. One trick in particular becomes the object of Angier's obsession. It's an illusion he calls, \\"the greatest magic trick he's ever seen.\\" It's called The Transported Man. He works with Cutter to try and figure the trick out. Cutter is convinced that Borden simply uses a double to pull of his disappearance/reappearance. Angier knows that it is Borden who both disappears and reappears in the trick, but he can find no other way to pull the trick off so he works with a double. With his superior showmanship, he's able to pull off a more impressive act, but it's not enough for him as it's his double that gets \\"the prestige.\\" He simply must learn Borden's secret so he can pull off the act and get the prestige as well.<br /><br />Things escalate from there. To talk any more of the plot would be to ruin the story. Suffice it to say, each magician battles their own demons and ventures further and further into hell as they try to ruin each other. You already know which one of them dies at the end and how, but what you don't know is how the story is going to resolve. It's obvious that in this movie about illusionists, there is more here than meets the eye.<br /><br />The Turn:<br /><br />Director Christopher Nolan is a master of the psychological thriller genre, and that's exactly what this film is. While many people will be watching this film for the twists and turns, the real meat is in the examination of these two fantastic and psychotic characters. Watching each of them break down over time consumed by their own ambitions and obsessions is both disturbing and fascinating to watch.<br /><br />Nolan is also a genious when it comes to narrative. I omit his first name here because I'm not sure which Nolan deserves the most credit. The Prestige is the first film since Memento that brother Jonathan Nolan helped right. Like that film, The Prestige tells it's story in an unusual fashion. The use of flashbacks through journal entries is not new perhaps, but the idea of having flashbacks within a flashback as one journal accounts for the stories in yet another journal is quite novel. Yet, like Memento, the unusual narrative style isn't used for novelty. In The Prestige, just like Memento, the narrative style serves a very strong purpose.<br /><br />Another great aspect of the film is how it itself plays out in the same fashion as a magic trick. The openning of the film has Michael Caine narrating the concept of a magic act in three parts: The Pledge, The Turn, and The Prestige. He goes on to tell you that even though you'll be looking to find out how it's done, you won't get it because you really aren't looking. I've heard a few complaints about this film and people claim they figuredout the film's \\"trick\\" early on. I don't see how this is possible. I think many mistake the film's big reveal on the Transported Man for the real point. Like great magicians, the Nolans let you figure out what they want you to figure out so that all the while the real illusion carries out right before your eyes unnoticed.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan again proves he's the finest director to hit the scene in some time. I don't need to tell you the acting is top notch. When you get this kind of talent working for this kind of director, it's a given. What really makes this film is the screenplay. It succeeds not only as a top notch thriller and mystery, but also an intriguing character study. The narrative for the story is brilliantly devised. From the set design, to the costumes, to the musical score, all the production values are top notch.<br /><br />This is one of those films that is so hard to write a review for because to discuss some of the great things about the film is to reveal the film itself.<br /><br />The Prestige:<br /><br />The Prestige is easily one of the best films of the year. I'll be shocked if it doesn't at least get a nomination for the Best Screenplay Oscar. Like Memento it is a complex and tightly woven story that can't be completely digested in one viewing, though it certainly can be enjoyed. I caution viewers not to go into this film constantly looking to figure out the big twist. That is not the point of this film. Instead focus on the tragic story of these two characters of how they come together and ultimately come apart.

0743454537|5.0|WOW.  Jodie Picult takes a topic that - on the surface - appears black and white and she liberates all the shades of gray.  This timely fictional book about genetics, blood, tissue and organ harvesting will leave any reader reexamining the subject.  Many think that this topic is the equivalent of a science fiction.  Although uncommon - if you Google the subject (Preimplantation genetic diagnosis - PGD) - you will find families using this genetic tactic to rationalize the birth of another child and validate their decision the same way Picult's characters defend theirs.  This is a must read for any book club or intellectual reader.  True character development includes the ability to create fascinating, captivating, recognizable and empathetic characters.  The topic is timely and her character development consuming.  <br /> <br />Her previous books, Vanishing Acts and Plain Truth are equally compelling.  But, her most recent reads (The Pact and The Tenth Circle), although engrossing, are darker.  Be aware that The Pact and the Tenth Circle and good books, but buy a box of tissues.  The characters are captivating, but the topics are gloomy rather than timely.  But, once again, her character development is astounding. <br />
0618680004|4.0|Richard Dawkins, well known writer on evolutionary theory, begins this volume by quoting from Robert Pirsig (author of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance) (page 5):  \\"`When one person suffers from a delusion, it is called insanity.  When many people suffer from a delusion it is called religion.'\\"  This is a volume that religious readers will despise and that nonbelievers will probably speak well of.<br /><br />There certainly are questions one can raise about this volume.  For instance, Dawkins claims that the founders of the United States were not overly religious.  However, research clearly shows that religious sources were among the most commonly cited in the lead up to the American Revolution.  And the colonists were a religious people; some colonies had been, in essence, theocracies.  However, such cavils are not directly relevant for the thesis of Dawkins.<br /><br />The book runs along the following lines:<br /><br />First, Dawkins explores standard arguments on behalf of God's existence and disposes of each of these.  Some might argue that he attacks some straw men here, but--overall--this is a readable critique that will be compelling for some and not for others.<br /><br />Second, he addresses why, in his opinion, the idea of the existence of God is unlikely.<br /><br />Next, he asks why religion has become widespread.  He adopts an evolutionary approach to address this.  He ends up speculating that (page 174): \\". . .there will be a selective advantage to child brains that possess the rule of thumb: believe, without question, whatever your grown-ups tell you.  Obey your parents; obey the tribal elders, especially when they adopt a solemn, minatory tone.  Trust your elders without question.\\"  In short, we tend to reify the values of our parents and other respected figures.  If those values are religious, then people will accept those religious values with little question.  He follows this discussion up by addressing why morality is so widespread, since many equate morality and religion.  He examines a series of studies that suggest that both believers and non-believers accept fairly similar moral positions.  Dawkins' question (page 226):  \\"This seems compatible with the view, which I and many others hold, that we do not need God in order to be good--or evil.\\"<br /><br />Other questions are addressed as well, such as the contention that there is a gap in human life that God fills, the down side of the confident absolutism of many religious people, and so on.  The book is well written and literate.  In the final analysis, though, its basic contention is such that those who begin reading the book in agreement with Dawkins will like it and those in disagreement (if they read the book at all) will be appalled.  Nonetheless, for those interested in the recent books focusing on the subject of the validity of religion, this is a must read.pread, since many equate morality and religion.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|First, let me tell you that I am a huge sci-fi fan. If it's something sci-fi, I've seen it...more than once. From epic sagas like Star Wars to low budgeted tales like Laserblast. I own every piece of sci-fi that's been put on dvd, so my review is biased. But you don't have to be a fan of sci-fi to appreciate this incredible show. <br /> <br />I had heard of Firefly when it first aired and it was one of those shows that I meant to watch, tivo, etc but never got around to it until it was too late. It aired on Friday nights which is bad for me because I'm not home on Friday nights. But when I saw that almost 2700 people (to date) had reviewed this dvd set on Amazon and it has a solid 5 star rating I couldn't put off watching it anymore. Man, was I BLOWN AWAY! <br />  <br />If you have grown tired of every movie or tv series in your dvd collection, like I did, and you are looking for something new and original then I highly recommend you pick this set up as well as the movie Serenity. Spend a weekend watching the whole series straight through and you will ask the same question I asked and everyone here is asking...why did they cancel THIS show? It makes no sense whatsoever. Fox cannot possibly justify the cancellation of THIS show when there is so much junk on tv right now.

B000F0UUT6|2.0|When I first saw this production on TV, I hated it. I still do. Andrew Davies made it his own alright, adding bits that just were not in the Jane Austen original, most obviously, the silly swim in the lake. He attempted to bring sex into the story for a modern audience, when it was all about attraction and growing love, and I am convinced miss Austen would have been horrified at all the heaving bosoms. Modesty and the fliratious use of fans, a language in its own right, were the order of the day in Regency England. Fancy dressing came into its own in the ballrooms where the aforementioned heavings would have been acceptible,  and the Bennet family were middle class, not wealthy, hence the snobbery by the Bingley sisters and Mr. Darcy. <br />So, the costumes were gorgeous, the actors good looking at the locations sumptuous, but the dialogue...they just did not speak like that in Regency times. It was all dumbed down for the masses and I was very disappointed with the whole production. I kept hoping it would get better. The only master stroke was the lovely double wedding at the end, but even that wasn't in the original classic. Love it if you must, but I prefer the 1980 BBC version, which stuck to the original and was a better production all round.
B0000A98ZP|5.0|I bought this movie for my coming of age daughter to watch with me.  I enjoyed it so much in high school and was not surprised that she did also. Times and styles may have changed, but I believe that teens still go through needing the sense of belonging as these teens in the movie did. Simple, but great movie.  My only regret is that it wasn't close captioned.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|I love this thing. I have an 8 month old, and we're always tracking small pieces of gravel from the driveway onto \\"his\\" living room floor.  I HATE to vacuum, and I would have to do it 2 times a day or more just to keep the floor free of the small dangerous rocks and sand.  NOT ANY MORE!   <br /> <br />    This sweeper works 10X better than the traditional carpet sweeper I spent $30 on to solve this problem.  It picks up the rocks, (the carpet sweeper did not) collects the sand, and even manages to get some of the carpet lint.  On the kitchen floor it picks up sand, rocks, cookie crumbs, and everything else my son gets on it! My traditional carpet sweeper did nothing on the linoleum!  The battery seems to last through 2-3 uses (then I just put it on the charger while I sleep), and the brushes spin a lot faster on the linoleum than the carpet.   <br /> <br />    My only problems are:  <br />You do have to empty the tray after every use (takes all of 1 minute). <br />It collects dust on the outside surface (seems to be from static electricity and wipes right off in about 10 seconds).  <br />My son loves the noise it makes and chases me around the room as I use it (it's not NEARLY as loud as a vacuum, but I WAS under the impression it should be pretty much silent).   <br /> <br />    I would buy this sweeper again in a heartbeat.  With a baby in the house, it's just SO much easier to use than the vacuum.  I haven't had the problems others seem to have had. I admit I was extremely sceptic about buying this after reading some of these reviews, however, I am completely happy with my purchase.  <br /> <br />I am glad I took the risk and bought this sweeper because it was well worth the money.
B000GG4XHO|5.0|Differences in sound between the CD versions of the original album may be significant (although I think the original LP has superior sound overall) but for me the best thing about this CD is the  earlier version of the song Coney Island Baby.<br /><br />1. It is beautifully recorded, mixed and mastered.<br /><br />2. I like the grittier sound to Reed's voice with lyrics more engagingly vernacular and conversational in delivery (rather than rehearsed umpteen times).  The originally released version, although a work of art, always came across to me as a little too sappy in parts, particularly the ending with the (probably rehearsed) emotional catch in the voice.<br /><br />I'm so glad this happened - I've now got closure on this great song!<br /><br />If you're in any way a fan of Reed's art you gotta hear this! Thank you Lou Reed (vocals, guitar), Doug Yule (guitar, bass), Michael Fonfara (keys), Bob Meday (drums) and all others responsible.
B000GFLE86|4.0|\\"Half the Perfect World\\" is an excellent set from Madeleine Peyroux. I enjoy the music and hit the repeat button on a number of its tracks.  One of my favorite studio musicians, Dean Parks, is on every track.  Dean has played on some of my favorite albums like Jimmy Webb's \\"Land's End,\\" Carole King's \\"Wrap Around Joy,\\" & Art Garfunkel's \\"Angel Clare\\"; so it is a delight to hear him on Madeleine's set.  With its French lyric, \\"La Javanaise\\" makes me think Edith Piaf despite Peyroux's cool breezy vocals.  Of her originals, \\"California Rain\\" is a delight with its happy guitar strum and the juxtaposition of Peyroux's wistful vocals, \\"What a fool to be ambitious, Moving here with all my wishes, Far away, far away from where my heart is.\\"  \\"I'm Alright\\" is a story-song that makes you feel like you've been sitting in a bar listening to this woman pour her heart out about her last relationship.  Of the cover songs, my 2 favorites include \\"Blue Alert\\" with David Piltch's throbbing bass on the Leonard Cohen-penned song, \\"It's just another night I guess, all tangled up in nakedness; You even touch yourself, you're such a flirt.\\"  The Fred Neil song that Nilsson made famous from \\"Midnight Cowboy\\" was always one of my favorite melodies, \\"Sailing on a summer breeze, skipping over the ocean like a stone.\\"  Madeline turns it to a lonesome tune like a hometown girl lost in the big city; it's lovely.  When a song like Joni Mitchell's \\"River\\" has been so often recorded, it's hard to bring something new to the sound.  Recordings include Betty Buckley, Rosanne Cash, Holly Cole, Robert Downey Jr. [on Ally McBeal], Heart, Indigo Girls, Barry Manilow, Naked Barbies [true confession: I've never heard this band, but their name was too good to leave out of the review], Dianne Reeves, Linda Ronstadt, James Taylor and Sloan Wainwright.  In Madeleine's hands with help from K.D. Lang, it becomes a lament filled with longing and shades of sadness.  The other tracks are also strong like \\"Smile\\" & \\"The Heart of Saturday Night.\\"  This beautiful set has been jamming my changer since its arrival.  Enjoy!The Heart of Saturday Night.\\"  This beautiful set has been jamming my changer since its arrival.  Enjoy!
0671688782|1.0|This method, when used appropriately, may be useful for some children who do not have \\"severe\\" attachment issues.  Children with secure attachments who have normal \\"acting out\\" behaviors will probably not be adversely effected by forced holds, and may show some signs of benefits (though I question whether those same benefits would not be achieved by minimized physical contact while coaching a child in expressing their emotions through words).  I strongly advocate against this method for children with anxious or avoidant attachment patterns--as do most other therapuetic professionals I work with (I, personally, am not a professional--but an adult who has worked through the challenges of anxious/avoidant attachment styles).   <br /> <br />From my experiences and the numerous reports of others in similar circumstances, I have come to believe that forced holdings may appear to have short term benefits.  After all, children with insecure attachment patterns are primed for survival, and if you must submit to forced holdings in order to survive you will quickly learn to do so.  However, in the long run, forced holding has adverse effects on attachment and responsiveness to physical contact.  Personally, after entering therapy of my own accord in college it took two years before I was able to willingly allow someone to hug me (though I still would submit to hugs in situations where it was \\"culturally appropriate\\").  Forced holding did nothing for my attachment patterns--though initially there may have been a decrease in negative externalized behaviors (followed by an increase in internalized behaviors such as self-injury and suicidal ideation).   <br /> <br />On the other hand--using these methods for voluntary holds can work wonders, I use \\"holding time\\" as a voluntary activity for many of the emotionally challenged (and emotionally typical) children I work with.  The benefits of voluntary and appropriate physical contact can not be emphasised enough.   <br /> <br />For good guidelines on appropriate intervention techniques, try Dr. Becky Bailey's \\"Easy to Love, Difficult to Discipline\\" and \\"I Love You Rituals\\".  The \\"I Love You\\" rituals alone are often enough for me, as a teacher, to break through with difficult children--and they are all presented in method that is voluntary, interactive, and nonthreatening--unlike forced holds.
1592402038|4.0|I teach a class on writing advertising, and one of my students recommended this book after seeing what a stickler I am on punctuation and grammar (the sad thing is that I'm not THAT much of a stickler--their punctuation and grammar is just so atrocious that I seem like it to them). This is basically a humorous rant against the deterioration of punctuation in today's world. Truss covers the history of much of the punctuation, correct usage and common mistakes. Because she's a British writer, she also points out differences in usage between the U.K. and U.S. Although she comes across as an old-fashioned fuddy-duddy at times, she also explains when a certain usage is debatable or a matter of taste. In most instances, I agree with her recommendation. Although this book isn't as comprehensive as Strunk & White or other usage guides, if the goal was to write a book that \\"normal\\" people would find readable, then Truss has succeeded.

6305807086|3.0|John Cusack plays an out of work puppeteer married to an animal loving Cameron Diaz. Their home is filled with dogs, birds and even a monkey. Cusack takes a job as a file clerk at a company that exists on floor 7 1/2 of an office building. One day, behind a filing cabinet, he finds a small door. Behind it is a portal into John Malkovich's head. While you are there you see everything he sees and hear him speaking. You remain there for 15 minutes and are then dropped on the roadside of the New Jersey turnpike. <br /> <br />Cusack tells Catharine Keener, a woman he works with that he has fallen in love with, she decides they can make money by charging people $200 to take a turn in Malkovich's head. Diaz takes a turn and changes completely as a person. She suddenly believes she should be a man. Then Keener begins dating Malkovich and falls in love with Diaz, but only when she's inside of Malkovich, which drives Cusack mad. <br /> <br />The ideas in this movie are wildly imaginative and original. You will never see another film like it. There are some laugh-out-loud scenes and also some quiet humor. The performances are excellent, especially Malkovich who riffs easily on his own image. The film as a whole, however, didn't completely work for me. I was bored more than once, and for all the odd humor, it takes a slightly darker turn halfway through. Also, the motivations of Catharine Keener's character are never fully explained and there is no reason shown why Cusack should fall in love with her so quickly or at all for that matter. The plot also gets too convoluted as the movie goes on. They had a wild idea with the portal and entering Malkovich's head, but I don't think they knew what to do with it.

B000002GJH|5.0|I used to be a big fan of today's alternative rock when I was in high school, but as I grew older I realized the lyrics were depressing, meaningless, profanity laden rants about the lead singer's unhappy childhood.    People were telling me today's alt rock couldn't compare to the stuff put out in the 90's, and after buying Soundgarden's A-sides I saw what they were talking about. Here was a band that rocked hard, produced catchy tunes, and while the lyrics were still depressing, they meant something universal and could be communicated without cursing.    I really liked Soundgarden and the song \\"Hunger Strike\\" so I decided to pick this albumn up. Songs \\"Wooden Jesus\\" and \\"Your Savior\\" mock condecending televangalists and other religious folk while \\"Four Walled World\\", \\"Times of Trouble\\" and \\"All Night Thing\\" are songs of loss and hope. Every song on here is top notch and they all flow smoothy together. It would've been better if Cornell and co. had recorded one more song, and \\"Reach Down\\" is a little long, but if you like Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, or grunge, you need to listen to this. It's amazing
0767836286|5.0|Noon. A suburb of Washington, DC, a street dotted with houses just a shade too small to be McMansions. No one is around.<br /><br />Wait --- here comes someone. A boy. White, of course. About 9 years old. Dressed in jeans and high-top sneakers. Walking unsteadily in the middle of the street. Lurching, really.<br /><br />And now we see why: blood dots his sneakers, makes a trail on the pavement.<br /><br />Luckily, a resident comes along --- Michael Faraday (yes, he has the same name as the great scientist who experimented with electricity and magnetism). He scoops the boy up, rushes him to the hospital. Eventually, the boy's parents show up, grateful beyond measure that the rocket their son set off wasn't more powerful --- and that they have such a good neighbor.<br /><br />And now we see the opening credits: distorted photos of suburban life. They look anything but peaceful. Clever movie lovers will recall shots like this in David Lynch's \\"Blue Velvet.\\" Clearly, something evil thrives alongside the barbeques.<br /><br />But how could that be? Faraday (Jeff Bridges) is a history professor who teaches college courses in terrorism. He's widowed --- his wife was an FBI agent, killed in a botched raid --- and only recently dating a graduate student (Hope Davis). All he wants is to raise his nine-year-old son and find some peace.<br /><br />And the neighbors, Oliver Lang (Tim Robbins) and his wife Cheryl (Joan Cusack) couldn't be nicer. They sense Faraday's loneliness, and they take steps --- inviting him over, including his son in their family outings.<br /><br />Until, one day.....right, the Langs are too perfect. Faraday senses that when a letter for Lang is wrongly delivered to his mailbox. It's forwarded from the University of Pennyslvania., Odd. Didn't Lang say he went to Kansas State?<br /><br />And so it begins: a neighbor furtively investigating his neighbor. And finding that there's something wrong in his story, that he may not be who he says he is.<br /><br />At the same time, Faraday is teaching his class. That bombing in St. Louis (really, the Oklahoma City bombing). Scary, wasn't it? But remember how much better you felt the next day, when the FBI produced a single suspect: \\"We want one man, one name, and we want it fast because we want our security back.\\"<br /><br />Here's the problem with Farraday: He may teach terrorism, but he's a lousy detective. That is, his suspect knows what's going on. And confronts him. There's a scene in Faraday's back yard that's as menacing as any conversation on film: Faraday looking at a college year book that proves Lang has changed his name, Lang sneaking up on him. And then the reversal of expectation: It's Lang who's mad. Because he has an explanation, a damned good one. And if Faraday only had the decency to ask....<br /><br />What's happening? Faraday can't tell. Is Lang really a structural engineer working on a mall in Reston? Or is he a leader of a terrorist cell plotting mass murder in Washington?<br /><br />Then Faraday's girlfriend sees....Then Faraday's girlfriend rushes to a pay phone...Then Faraday's girlfriend turns around....<br /><br />The secret of thrillers, Alfred Hitchcock explained, is to give people a fear bigger than the fears they live with every day. Movies with special effects and ridiculous plots do this poorly. Movies based on brilliant \\"what ifs?\\" make you pee your pants. Like \\"Rosemary's Baby\\" --- what if a man makes a deal with Satan? Or \\"Arlington Road\\" --- what if your neighbor is Satan?<br /><br />There are critics who have called \\"Arlington Road\\" overheated and improbable --- especially the end. Well, it fooled me. And terrified me. The cinematography, the music, the rising paranoia of Bridges, the spookily friendly Robbins and Cusack: all the elements work together to make you scared of parking lots, mini-vans, the repairman outside your house.<br /><br />As for the end, it forces you to reexamine everything. Was it just good fortune that the Langs were Faraday's neighbors? That letter in Faraday's mailbox --- did the mailman do that? Hey, what about their injured son at the beginning --- could that be...? For God's sake, where did this plot begin?<br /><br />When it's over, you'll sit in the dark and shake. \\"Arlington Road\\" is that good.ood fortune that the Langs were Faraday's neighbors?

1572814748|5.0|This deck is an ideal size -- large enough to read comfortably (not tiny, like other minature decks I've tried to use), yet small enough to take anywhere.  Plus, this little beauty comes in its very own attractive, sturdy box -- the cards are well-protected from the vagaries of handbag or pocket travel.  No worries here -- the box lid fits well and doesn't fall off (although I must admit I secured mine with a rubber band, just in case!).  The weight of the cardstock feels substantial, without being too thick. The edges feel polished, no roughness whatsoever.  The cardstock is protected with a smooth matte finish, which shuffles well, and compliments Mary Hanson-Roberts' color beautifully -- a color so lucious, I could eat it with a spoon!  The back design is completely reversible and totally beautiful -- it looks like a blue evening sky filled with blue clouds, which have parted to reveal an amazing 8-pointed golden star.  I love this deck -- I won't go anywhere without it!
0451191153|5.0|When you assess Ayn Rand's Fountainhead, a lot has to be taken into consideration. First of all, this book was written in 1943. And though many authors from that era still are fresh and contemporary, the Fountainhead has definitely aged ungracefully. The characters of Roark, Toohey, Keeting, and others are both complicated and yet at the same time horribly two dimensional. The morals of feminism and the morals of the idealist are stilted in a pre-post-modernism fashion that is alien to our present culture.<br /><br />Aside from the surface level of this novel (what usually is 100% of a work of fiction), underneath all of the dry and difficult interactions of the characters is a philosophy that Rand expounds. It is that of the idealist and how that person must stand up against just about every one else in society who will be attempting to tear him or her down. That is sort of a simple read on Rands fascinating work, but essentially it is what the book is about. Rand is setting forth a philosophical agenda like Nietzsche, Freud, and all the other old fellows, only Rand is using a fictional vehicle to structure her ideas around.<br /><br />So in essence, Rands work is an amazing towering achievement that is worth reading due to the fact that every page hums with her ideas. On the other hand, her characters are so terrible and dead you really don't want to aspire to be these people. Roark, the subject of her treatise, is like a lobotomized Forrest Gump with a knack at architectuare. I wouldn't want to be him or know him. Yet this is Rand's ideal. Her characters also wander in an area of cultural entitlement that alienates just about every reader.<br /><br />While reading this book, I kept thinking of what kind of person Rand was. If she is like the characters and the ideas of her book, or is essentially the person who wrote the forward of her 25th anniversary reprint, she is one of the coldest, most unhappy people every to walk the face of the earth. Her ideas are those of superiority and snobbish to an extreme beyond those of anyone I have ever come across. Her husband, Frank O'Hara (a painter), was not a very good artist and seems to my eye to have represented Keeting, Roark's foil and the embodiment of everything wrong in her world view. Her ideals strip all that is soulful in an existence and yet she is expounding thoughts of the perfect creationist who might embody humanities very best. I could go on and on... but I think you get the idea, this book in contradictory to an extreme.<br /><br />Lastly, and this is just a personal aside... Ayn Rand has completely poured her soul out onto these pages. But what a soul it is. Rand has portrayed herself as the coldest, ugliest person I have ever come across. Its fascinating to see her warped world view that is devastatingly bleak and morbid.<br /><br />This is one of the more important books of the 20th century, it is also very enjoyable to read, though dated as I said. I would suggest this book to anyone as a book to put on a personal reading list and hope you decide to give it a try.nobbish to an extreme beyond those of anyone I have ever come across.

B00008BXJG|5.0|Ignore the naysayers who criticize this album and AC/DC in general. AC/DC is one of the greatest bands in rock history. Whether you consider them blues-rock, hard rock, heavy metal, or just down-to-earth rock 'n' roll, they do it great. Don't believe me? Look at all the albums they've sold and their tremendous fan base.  Anyway, back to the review...   Even though I wasn't born in the '70s, it was a great time for music. Bands like Led Zeppelin, KISS, Aerosmith, Queen, Rush, Deep Purple, Blue Oyster Cult etc. etc. etc., were achieving great success and producing great albums. AC/DC was no acception.   Although such early albums like \\"High Voltage\\" and \\"Let There Be Rock\\" were hard-rockin' classics, AC/DC was never really considered a \\"commercial\\" success. And by that, I DO NOT mean a sell-out band. I just mean that their records didn't sell as well as some other bands. However, that all changed with \\"Highway To Hell\\". I read that as of May '06, \\"Highway...\\" sold more than 7 million copies. More than that, Highway To Hell was a statement. If the '70s were closing out, they were closing out with a bang.    \\"Highway To Hell\\" 10/10: Absolutely killer song! The heavy guitar, especially in the solo section, and the groovy, pounding drums partner with the anthemic lyrics. Great rocker with a great hook. This is the type of song that everybody can like. My mom even loves this song whenever she hears it on the radio!  \\"Girl's Got Rhythm\\" 10/10: Terrific follow-up to the title track. Fantastic, blues riff and great chorus. I wouldn't be surprised if this was released as a single.  \\"Walk All Over You\\" 10/10: This five-minute headbanger shows AC/DC's maturity as songwriters. Love the progressive intro and the fast riff and drumbeat show just how hard these guys can rock. Awesome solos and great ending, THIS is a great song.  \\"Touch Too Much\\" 10/10: Very cool song with a catchy chorus and some hard-rockin' guitars/drum combo. I just love it when Bon Scott sings \\"She's got the body of Venus with arms.\\".  \\"Beating Around The Bush\\" 10/10: SPECTACULAR!!! I love this song, in fact, it's ones of my favorites on the album. The lyrics are funny and do a great job accompanying the rhythm that boasts a killer guitar riff.  \\"Shot Down In Flames\\" 8/10: Very good opener to the B-side of the album. Like I said, there are no weak tracks, but this one doesn't stand out as much as some tracks from the first half of the disc.  \\"Get It Hot\\" 10/10: Probably the first AC/DC song I know that's only two and a half minutes, but definitely NOT filler. The riff is simple, but catchy, and this would serve as a great song to dance to.  \\"If You Want Blood (You Got It)\\" 9/10: Another catchy one that just seems to be an awesome track to listen to while driving down the highway, for some reason or another.  \\"Love Hungry Man\\" 9/10: Once again, the lyrics really accompany the rhythm, and this is a great track about a common rock and roll topic... basically, finding a great woman by love at first sight. It's been done before, but this is something of a stand-out.  \\"Night Prowler\\" 10/10: Slower, almost epic song and an interesting way to close out the album. Although it's kinda dark, I heard somewhere it pokes fun at something or another. I don't really know what, but this song is, kinda obviously, something to listen to at night. Right at the end, Bon Scott quotes Mork and Mindy by saying, \\"Shazbot! Nanu nanu!\\" This was rumored to be the last take ever recorded by Scott, and the creepy thing about it is how \\"Shazbot! Nanu! Nanu!\\", was a way Mork used to end transmissions with his home planet with.    Anyway, \\"Highway To Hell\\" is a classic rock album that should be in everybody's collection, especially if you love '70s music, hard rock, blues-based stuff, and of course, AC/DC! Rock on!
B000HBKCDC|5.0|I've come to realize that I like my Christmas music to be--as I said in the title of this review--wistful, haunting and gorgeous. This new recording suits that longing. Many of us yearn for the Christmas of our childhood (or our dreams) and somehow, Wintersong captures that longing. Hearing songs from my youth (Lennon, Charlie Brown) mixed in with Sarah's unique arrangements of classic carols and original tunes is just what I need.  <br /> <br />It's not even Halloween and already the stores are filled with Christmas decorations, making me feel cranky and jaded. Sarah's music rescues me from that and will be my preferred gift to give this year. Well done!!!

The Reader was snared by his own trap, and her name was Hanna. I read this book in one sitting. It was thoroughly engrossing. Highly recommend for its content and excellent translation.
B000089RVX|5.0|Some classic albums have 1 or 2 timeless and great songs.  This album has at least 3 songs in the \\"best ever\\" category:   <br /> <br />\\"Bring Me To Life\\" - The ultimate Pinochio cry to become real by ending the lies. <br /> <br />\\"Going Under\\" - Musically captures the feelings of a no-win situation. <br /> <br />\\"My Immortal\\" - A song about the many facets of undying love. <br /> <br />I usually have lots of words and reasoning for why I recommend something.  But in this case, words fail to capture the emotional environment these songs create.  So I guess the purpose of this review is just to be a large arrow, pointing at these songs, saying simply, \\"Try these.  They rock.\\"
B00005LQ04|3.0|I consider myself a horror movie fan, so after reading about this movie so many times, I figured I just had to see it.  Based on what some other Amazon reviewers had to say, I was under the threat of being an unsophisticated loser who doesn't appreciate anything beyond the simpleton creations of Hollywood if I didn't like this movie.  So I tried to see this as a \\"masterpiece;\\" lord help me I TRIED to be as sophisticated as those other reviewers who would consider me a cretin for not appreciating it!<br /><br />Seriously though, I wasn't blown away.  It helps to try and think what it would have been like to see this movie back in the 70's, but I still wasn't as happy with it as I wanted to be.<br /><br />I gave it 3 stars because it had its great moments.  For example I loved it when, before the girl jumped into the barbed wire room, she watched as a knife came through a crack in the door trying to jimmy the lock open.  The way it was silent except the slight clicking of the knife against the lock was pretty terrifying.  (By the way, why did she go and get in the fetal position instead of simply pushing down on the lock to keep the knife from getting it open?  Oh sorry, I failed to do the belief-suspension thingy.)<br /><br />Anyways the barbed-wire-room scene was creepy, as was the final scene.  I mean I don't think anyone's horizons will be broadened by these scenes, especially nowadays, but they were quite delicious and effective when it comes down to it.<br /><br />I guess much of the movie just didn't intrigue me.  The initial, supposedly infamous murder scene didn't have the impact on me that it should have, but maybe that's because I had read too much about it and it was built up too much in my mind beforehand.<br /><br />So yes, I can see Suspiria's appeal, and I realize it's supposed to be quite the influential work.  But I still wasn't feeling the \\"masterpiece\\" vibe!  Even worse, I DO enjoy some of the typical Hollywood horror fare.  Oh what a small-minded loser I am ...mall-minded loser I am ...

B000GY729M|5.0|I can understand some people not liking the new direction of the band, but the constant comparisons to Hot Fuss are ridiculous. If they had done a second album that was just like Hot Fuss, everyone would complain that they should've called it \\"Hot Fuss II\\". By taking a different direction and showing growth, maturity and innovation, they are the subject of complaints because it doesn't sound like Hot Fuss. No wonder there is the so-called Sophomore Slump--you can't please everybody. I think Sam's Town is one of the best CDs of 2006. I, like many on here, eagerly anticipated it. From the opening rift of \\"When You Were Young\\" when it was released as a single through the first and second listen of the entire \\"Sam's Town\\" disc, I have been pleasantly surprised. I thought the band with stick with a familiar sound--especially one that sold 5 million records. Sam's Town may not please everyone, but it will be looked back upon one day as a brilliant next step for The Killers. Not to be missed. Oh, and who cares what Rolling Stone and other magazines give it? Please.
B000HCO83Q|4.0|I saw the first X-Men movie, missed the second one, and just saw this one.  I'm not a huge fan of the comic books so any complaints that others have about the weak characters doesn't apply to me.  I still think Halle Berry is a pretty flat actress so the fact that Storm had such a huge role in this movie was a big drawback for me.  But other than that, I thought it was good. It was action-packed and entertaining the whole way through, which is all I was looking for.  If you're a huge fan of the whole X-Men franchise, I've heard from friends who are Marvel devotees that this one was a disappointment.  However, if you're just looking for a night in with a good movie I think you'll be pleasantly entertained.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|I love the smart, realistic, and sexy writing, characters, and fashion of this series.  I saw it from the beginning and like Melrose, Queer Eye, DWTS, American, Idol, Six Feet, Nip/Tuck, and Friends; I also liked and raved about it before everyone joined the wagon.
0743289412|1.0|I used to love King's books, but lately I do not even recognize these books as King ones. They are the most rehashed and drab pieces of junk on the planet. Steven King obviously has run out of new ideas, and is just trying to make more money. What a total joke. Anyone who likes this book is just kidding themselves, because they do not want to admit that King sucks now. I am at least willing to be honest with myself and deal with it. Its time to go find a new author to read.
B000BB1MI2|4.0|I'll start off by saying I've never been a fan of Johnny Depp.  So it surprised me that I really enjoyed this movie - and have watched it multiple times, all because of Depp.<br /><br />Yes, I grew up on the original film version of the book and Depp's performance of Willy Wonka was one of an eccentric chocolatier. One that Gene Wilder tried to pull off, but wasn't as successful. Depp's Wonka clearly is more insulated the Wilder's and is creeped out by kids and parents alike. Wilder's Wonka was mildly removed.<br /><br />The costumes, hair and the teeth only accentuate the left of center behaviour that Depp portrays.  Anyone thinking his is a throw away performance needs to look closer.<br /><br />The story is no less child-friendly than 'Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory'...though I don't find Elfman's 'Oompa-Loompa songs as enjoyable. The kids are ok - Charlie being the best of them, though I loved Veruca Salt (still not as good as the original Veruca).  I will say I didn't not understand Violet's 'flexibility' at the end of the movie at all.  And the kid they got to play Mike Teevee has eerily physicial similarities of the original kid.<br /><br />..and really...you can't go wrong having Christopher Lee as Wily's dad.<br /><br />Visually, there was no one other than Burton to (re)make this movie. I thought both he and Depp did a great job.
B00005JOLK|3.0|I've been watching the trailers over and over and after reading the books think this could be a problem... Probably shouldn't of read the books first. Mainly I'm going to see this movie for Brom, Murtagh and Ajihad. I love Sienna Guillory from Helen of Troy (and Arya is one of my favorite characters) but I'm confused about the way they made her look to play Arya. For one... Arya has dark hair (not strawberry blond)... and the major thing... she's an elf. The author repeats over and over that she has dark hair and pointed elf ears (think Arwen here). So what's up with the regular human ears and the light hair? Didn't the people who made the movie read the books at all? <br /> <br />I'm hoping the movie does live up to the book but I'm not entirely sure based off the way it looks now. Saphira, Brom, Murtagh and Ajihad look great though so I'm looking forward to watching them. I hope Ed Speleers' Eragon lives up to his role in the books and I hope the movie doesn't make me regret buying the tickets.

6304712936|5.0|Despite the many protests from scholars and Mozart fans alike regarding the accuracies or inaccuracies of this film to Mozart's true biography, the viewer still cannot help but be moved, inspired, and entertained all in one fell swoop!<br /><br />One of the marks of a true classic is something that stands up to the test of time.  Amadeus fits the definition as much as Casablanca, Gone With the Wind, and many other films that are still watched and discussed to this day.<br /><br />Amadeus celebrates one of the true musical geniuses ever to walk the Earth.  Compare the number of works of Mozart to the Beatles, and the Beatles throughout their career would barely scratch the surface of Mozart's over 600 works.  What makes this fact even more compelling, is the number of his works that are considered by many scholars, critics, and fans alike as some of the best music ever written.<br /><br />This film is a tour de force as far as acting goes.  F. Murray Abraham gives one of the best performances in film history as the likeable, yet envious Antonio Salieri who finds his own works to always be secondary to Mozart.  The irony regarding the depiction of these two composers in this film is that Salieri is shown to be the only one who truly marveled and understood the genius behind the music of Mozart. Salieri represents the \\"normal\\" man, or as he says at the end of the film, \\"I represent mediocrities everywhere.\\"<br /><br />Not to be out-done, Tom Hulce is fantastic as Mozart.  Hulce himself practiced on the piano for four hours each day so that he would appear convincing on film.  Despite showcasing Mozart with obvious arrogance and lack of humility, Hulce portrays Mozart with an almost child-like quality.  The cackling laugh of his still brings a smile every time you hear it.<br /><br />Perhaps the beauty about Mozart's character is that he isn't a \\"pleaser.\\"  Salieri has taken drastic steps to please himself before God, who he hopes will embue him with the ability to write \\"perfect\\" music.  And yet, he's astounded by Mozart who hasn't any humility, who isn't chaste, and who seems to repeatedly do things that would fly directly in the face of God.  It is this that Salieri takes exception to, and not necessarily the person of Mozart.<br /><br />If nothing else, Amadeus seems to \\"burst the bubble\\" as far as our views on what a \\"genius\\" should look like, or how they should act.  This is shown when Salieri first sees Mozart.  He's looking for an inspiring-looking man, but insteads finds an immature and selfish young man who could care less about the opinions of those around him.<br /><br />Perhaps the \\"lesson\\" here is that it doesn't matter how Mozart is depicted on film.  We can argue and complain about how the man truly was, but no one can ever dispute the genius behind his music, and isn't that what truly matters?bility to write \\"perfect\\" music.

0679422714|5.0|A brilliant piece of research.  China is in the news these days, but very few people know the true story of Mao.  Jung Chang's book is clearly polemic, but it is based on enormous factual research.  One of the book's strengths is that typically such a carefully researched acadmemic piece would be a dry and dusty read.  By contrast, the prose is clear and the story is gripping, which makes the huge quantity of information easier to plough through.

B000GCG59W|5.0|This is my first review ever on Amazon, but I feel compel to let everybody know how great this album is. It is jazz, it is blues, it is Spanish music at its best. This one is on my top 5 ever. It is just brilliant.
B0000640SB|5.0|The actors are great, the concept is clever, the script is sharp, and the direction is fast-paced. You won't give it a serious thought once you finish the viewing, except for the fact that you realize you won't mind seeing it again someday, because it gave you quite a nice time.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|Ask any naysayer and they'll tell you My Chemical Romance sucks for one or more of the following reasons: a)they're all style and no substance, b)The Black Parade is contrived and unoriginal, c)they're mainstream sellouts, and d)they're marketed to teenaged girls. Yes, MCR have a penchant for wearing make-up and red ties, their new album draws influences from nearly a dozen classic rock icons, their ability to craft memorable choruses and hooks have landed them on the covers of coutless magazines while helping to propel their 2004 breakthrough Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge into the sales stratosphere, and yes, girls like them. While the Anti-MCR Brigade make many a valid argument against the princes of goth tinged post-hardcore, there is one thing not even the most vehemntly outspoken hater can refute: The Black Parade is one hell of a well-written record. <br /> <br />Boasting some of the most bombastic and energetic song structures ever devised by a band of the Warped Tour generation, MCR's latest effort showcases the group's previously unexplored high-level musical ability (listen to Ray Toro's blistering guitar solo on the Cheap Trick inspired Dead! and Gerard Way's Steppenwolf-esque croon on House of Wolves). Each of the album's fourteen songs (all of which are single quality) serve as Romance's interpretation of classic rock legends ranging from Pink Floyd (The End.), Queen (Welcome to the Black Parade), Aerosmith (I Don't Love You), and even Foghat (Teenagers). And to imagine that the shamelessly over the top power balladry of Disenchanted won't be playing at every suburban high school prom next year would be kidding yourself. <br /> <br />Explosively epic and well-written, The Black Parade is arguably one of the only soon to be platinum selling rock records this year truly deserving of the Grammy its almost sure to garner in 2007. <br /> <br />
0393327655|1.0|For Sam Harris paradise is probably former communist Albania or present North Korea, where religion is forbidden. For Sam Harris, hell is certainly the United States and Western Europe, where a strong judeo-christian heritage has made a substantial contribution to contemporary legal and political institutions. Sam Harris seems not to understand that the problem of humanity is not religion, but sin. And since we are all sinners, we are all part of the problem, whether we are religious or not. Jesus Christ is the only solution, since He took our sins on the cross and will restore our fallen souls and this fallen universe. A proper religious understanding will warn us that we should be carefull with sin in our lives and in the lives of others, religious or non religious alike. We should develop a politics of distrust, since sin is everywhere, but also a politics that has room for redemption and moral progress, since abiding by the right principles can have a positive impact of society, even if perfection is and will always be impossible. We are not angels, and our system of govern must begin with that assumption. But we are made in the image of God and are moral beings, capable of making moral decisions freely and responsibly. Getting rid of religion will not wash away our sins. On the contrary, it will probably lead us to accept a law of nature where survival of the fittest and predatory behavior is the rule. In his radical and childish attack agains religion Sam Harris doesn't really know what he is talking about. Based on an over simplified understanding of religion and on a selective reading of history, his book is absolutely pueril in its arguments. It sounds like a child crying out loud when Mama commands him to eat his soup. This book is important, though, because it reveals to the Church how spiritually, philosophically and historically ignorant atheists can get, as well as how radically intolerant \\"rationalism\\" can get when it gets disconnected with the Absolute LOGOS, Jesus Christ. We must say to Sam Harris: study more, learn more, know more. First grow up, and then show up!
B0002B15XI|4.0|If you can do that, then Robert Altman's famous movie based on the popular book will please you. If you can't forget the actors and characters you saw for 11 seasons on the small screen, the 1970 film will not seem as good as it did when first released. Several of the characters in this film were deleted by the second season of the television version, and others were added, and new actors in the continuing roles obliterated memories of the film performances. It is still funny, but if you liked the TV show, seeing Robert Duvall as Major Frank Burns will be a \\"major\\" surprise. This is one of Altman's most accessible films, and its success changed American movies in some large ways. With the Iraq and Afghanistan wars raging, a movie that reminds us of the wounds, and the deaths, and the doctors who try to minimize both under horrid front-line conditions is not really dated. <br /> <br />
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I listen to everything in music, except rap and country. Country is just too accentric and white for me.. and rap has spiralled down ever since the originators passed the mainstream torch down to the next era. plus, i can make almost any beat on the market within 10 minute of my fruit loops, and i'm still broke at home with more quality to offer. anyways though..<br /><br />I never really was a big fan of Madonna. She's been around since I've been around, which is highly respectable considering artissts decline forever after about 4 years if they go that long.. But she's still kickin and when she came back with Ray of Light I took it as a comeback, and thought it would be good since she's going overboard with the producer. Turns out so too.. Years later discovering Orbit, I decide to check his tie to her with the reviewers pointing at it. Here I am, and suddenly tossed $25 on Ray of Light, and Confessions on a Dancefloor.<br /><br />On Music, I didn't lie saying I actually liked the single. But that's about as far as I looked into the cd. It had a few good tracks on it but the rest was just not for me.<br /><br />Now this album comes out, and I'm over it. It has the late 80's synth pop that I dig a lot. It has techno and dance written all over it, like something you'd catch off a show on FX or Bravo or something. I don't know exactly how to go into detail on this review but I just bought it after the sampling of it and I'm stoked for it. If that doesn't say its a gem then I don't know...<br /><br />I will write a better added review once received though. Juyst thought I'd poke my head out and say check it out!
B000059TEP|4.0|The tragic love story between Demi Moore and her murdered boyfriend Sam is one reason to see \\"Ghost.\\" The fine and funny performance of Whoopi Goldberg as a fake psychic who becomes a gifted one is another. A third reason is to root for the ghost of Sam to somehow conquer the laws of physics in order to bring his actual killer, and the man who hired him, to justice. There is a lot of food for thought here, although most of the movie is played for either comedy or melancholy, about life after death and heaven and hell, and whether or not our souls bear any memories of, or real relationship with, our personalities on earth. I'm a guy, yet I have enjoyed this movie many more times than once.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JNS0|4.0|Rookie race car Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson of \\"Rushmore,\\" \\"Shanghai Noon\\" and \\"Behind Enemy Lines\\" fame) finished the Piston Cup in a three-way tie with two other cars, including The King (Richard Petty), who is retiring.  The King is leaving behind a position as a product endorser that Lightning McQueen would love to have.  Another race between the three winners is ordered to determine the winner of the Piston Cup.<br /><br />Lightning McQueen heads off to California in a trailer pulled by Mack (John Ratzenberger).  McQueen insists Mack drive through the night to California.  Unfortunately, Mack falls asleep and leaves McQueen in the desert.  Reminiscent of \\"Doc Hollywood,\\" McQueen ends up in the town of Radiator Springs, where he needs to perform public service.  Similar to Michael J. Fox's character in \\"Doc Hollywood,\\" McQueen is arrogant and over-confident.  Fortunately, his experiences with the denizens of Radiator Springs may change his attitude and his life.<br /><br />Radiator Springs is filled with all sorts of characters.  Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt) is a former big-city attorney who dreamed of a slower pace and the beauty of the desert.  Doc Hudson (Paul Newman) is an enigmatic character with a secret past.  George Carlin is amusing as Fillmore.  Cheech Marin, Tony Shalhoub and Larry the Cable Guy all voice various characters with their own hopes, dreams and past.<br /><br />The question remains, where does all this lead?  The answer is that it leads to a funny story with a moral hidden behind it all; perhaps more than one moral.<br /><br />I was reluctant to see this movie in the theaters when it came out.  I am not a NASCAR fan and the commercials for this movie seemed to focus too much on the racing aspect of the movie.  Fortunately, while the movie opens and closes with a race, the rest of the movie is about life, and life, just like this movie, should be enjoyed, and there should be humor, which this movie has.<br /><br />This movie is a bit lighter than previous Pixar films.  However, the graphics are phenomenal and the story is easy to follow.  The detail in the scenery and in the machinery continuously amazed me.  Digital animation has come a long way in the last couple of decades and \\"Cars\\" is contains every technical achievement possible in animation.  I think the kind of animation in \\"Cars\\" no longer amazes many of us because we have seen it so many times before.  Fortunately, the story is enjoyable and there is reasonably good humor to keep you interested to the end of the movie.  There is a slow spot in the middle of the movie, but the animation fascinated me at that point and I was trying to figure out how this movie might end so that I hardly noticed the slow point.<br /><br />\\"Cars\\" has it all.  Great animation, a reasonably good story, an all-star cast, and humor.  There are a number of inside jokes, most of which I failed to catch.  The movie is also family friendly, even for the youngest members of the family.  This movie will be one that most families will want for their DVD library.<br /><br />Enjoy!movie is a bit lighter than previous Pixar films.

B00005U8EM|5.0|This is a great film, exploring a vain and selfish man's willingness to improve his character via a quest for the love of an irresistable woman. He is helped on this journey by getting stuck in a one-person time warp, having to relive the same day again and again until he gets his attitude toward life right. Surely you've seen it already, but it rewards repeated viewing.
0316776963|2.0|I picked up this book after seeing David Sedaris on a late night talk show. He seemed hilarious, almost like a younger, bemused Woodie Allen type.  <br /> <br />While the book is well written, his views on life are very disappointing to me. In his previous professions/stages of life, he was a ne'er-do-well, a loafer, well, basically a bum. Many of his stories are made up of snide commentaries on others around him who were progressing through their lives. These folks were getting in the way of David's quest of just figuring out how to get the next hit of recreational drugs.  <br /> <br />He can become the poet laureaute for the younger generations whom life is never easy enough and can't put enough blame on those around them.
B00002ND77|5.0|Perhaps the critics were right in saying that this production came off as a bit too long, and a bit too reverent, toward one of the chief civil rights leaders of the mid-20th century. Malcolm was macho, and had an air of danger, and he made Martin Luther King's protestant pleas for integration seem mainstream, compared to his Islamic separatist stance. But the country needed a Malcolm X, and I started out as a  white teenage hater of him, until reading the autobiography he published with Alex Haley. His death at the hands of other Black Muslims who stayed loyal to the disappointing Elijah Muhammed was indeed a tragedy, not equivalent to the loss of both Kennedys and Dr. King, but first, and more important in retrospect than it seemed at the time. And now that the USA is at war with certain kinds of Muslims, but not particularly the black American ones we feared in the late '50's, it is clear that Malcolm is deserving of a big screen epic biography. Denzel Washington is super in the title role. If you have any interest in the Civil Rights Movement and its early struggles, don't miss this movie.

078322737X|5.0|When somebody I'd never heard of named George Lucas stuck this tale of a long night for some California teens into the theaters, I wasn't interested in it until I read a rave review in Time Magazine. So I saw it. And then took a girl to see it. And then talked some guy friends into seeing it. And then took another girl to it. And then saw it alone. All in all, I paid eight times to see this on the big screen in about eight weeks. So I like it. It made a few careers, not the least being Mr. Lucas himself, and introduced some important entertainers to the screen. The music score of pioneering rock numbers is as good on its own terms as the movie is. I still enjoy it when it shows up on cable television. If George had only had four film projects in his life, this one and the first three \\"Star Wars\\" films, he'd be just as important in movie history as he is anyway. I'm not sure any writer/director/producer ever had a better first ten years in the business than Mr. Lucas.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000524CY|5.0|The Exorcist is by far the most frightening film ever made - nothing else even comes remotely close.  Those who say that the film was \\"boring\\" or \\"almost funny\\" must be in some kind of fear-induced denial.  I remember when I first saw the film back in early 1974, I was 16 years old and I couldn't sleep for weeks.  I remember laying in bed watching TV in those days after seeing the film, and when a TV commercial for the movie would come on, I would close my eyes and cover my ears until the commercial was over.  The film preys upon human beings' most basic and fundemental fears.
B000H305U0|4.0|I like an Artist who isn't afraid to experiment. FutureSex/LoveSounds has the freshness that I've been searching for in music these days.  Justin has always had a soulful flavor to me, but it's also his other flavors that I like. This album has a little R&B, a little Pop, some Jazz, Hip-Hop, it's all there. I even heard some 70's disco flavor. A good effort, and Justin is an artist with some staying power. Very few albums stand the test of time but this album is filled with songs that have some relevance, something that you would listen to a few years from now and still feel the meaning. <br />Actually, Justin doesn't need the featured artists (in ex: T.I.)        but they don't detract from the album either. I happen to dig the title of the album and love his tight-fitting suit. This album is enjoyable from beginning to end.
B000I5Y8ZU|4.0|My Chemical Romance has redefined their image as goth-punk rockers, to a more mature, relatable band. They have the undeniable talent to change up their sound with every album they make. As this band's career has progressed, they have been able to alter their music and keep the critics and the fans guessing. I found this album an incredible addition to their already polished standing. The Black Parade was able to be heartfelt, melodic, and still dark and off-beat at the same time. This band is not the same as all the other soon to be forgotten \\"emo-wannabees\\", and I am certain that these songs will not only be successful, but they will end up defying a generation.
B000FP2OPY|4.0|I wish I got the WB channel out here in the country.  I am subject to sattelite TV (with only the channels I can afford), have dial up internet, and the icy commute to town for 1/2 hour in the winter - and the bug riddled windshields in the summer.  So, I appreciate being able to hole up at home and find a good DVD series that I don't regret buying on Amazon.com [...]......and SUPERNATURAL is a GREAT show!<br /><br />Jensen Ackles, as Dean, the eldest of the spook-fighting brother team, is a fine actor (I've been a fan of his since seeing him the 1st time on Dark Angel) and I'm glad to see that he finally got his big shot at a lead acting role. The writers, however, as good of a job that they do on this show, should take advantage of his talents and refrain from the soap opera-type freeze shots.  I am sure that he puts in a lot of his own ideas for the character, on set.  Maybe they can get some of those writers over from Dark Angel to help out? Or maybe you do, what ever, but I think more FUN PERSONALITY, instead of the bickering and brooding stuff, makes shows more interesting. Especially when you combine some humor with the horror, I can take my hand off of my eyes on those terribly predictable (yet still, horrifying) suspenceful BOO shots!<br /><br />The 1st time I ever saw Jeffrey Morgan (as the dad, John Winchester), was just recently on the 2nd season DVD series of Grey's Anatomy.  Wow, what a fine actor, and a plus to this show as the father of Dean & Sam!  I'd totally believe anything he said, as crazy as it seemed!  And he looks so much like an older version of Robert Downey, Jr., that if he was available (and able) to act on this show as some kind of relative, or younger version of the dad, it would be so incredible!<br /><br />Speaking of younger versions: the better episodes are the ones that show their earlier years.  It makes it more interesting to know some history of the characters, and started to make me believe these boys had the abilities to fight the supernatural demons they encountered each show.  It was slower for me, in the beginning, to really take to the show because of this.<br /><br />Over all, though, I think this show from the beginning of the Pilot to the end of the 1st season, which I have just finished watching, has great promise.<br /><br />And McG...YOU ROCK!  There should be more people in show business like you, Joss Wheden & JJ Abrahms!<br /><br />Keep up the good work -I look forward to NEXT YEAR, when I can purchase the 2nd season!s they encountered each show.

B00026WUBE|5.0|I love Planet Waves for its warmth, resolve in the face of uncertainty, and  beautiful collaboration between Dylan and the members of The Band, who together create a kind of improvisational rock chamber music.  The album's recording in November 1973 occurred precisely at a central turning point in Dylan's career--his reemergence as a touring artist after an interval of more than seven years.  Dylan's decision to resume touring (with The Band) resonated with the source of his musicality, the \\"planet waves\\" underlying all of music, love, family, and history.  Planet Waves is many things.  It is the start of a narrative of departure into the unknown (\\"Going, Going, Gone\\") and a telegraphed message that \\"the prison walls are crumblin', there is no end in sight\\" (\\"Tough Mama\\").  It is a confession of self-hate for having loved a sinister enemy (\\"Dirge\\") and a ringing declaration that now \\"my hand's on the saber\\" (\\"Something There Is About You\\").  It is poems of winter and shared solitude (\\"On a Night Like This,\\" \\"Never Say Goodbye\\") and of love anticipated and found (\\"Hazel,\\" \\"You Angel You\\").  It is a blessing for Dylan's children (\\"Forever Young\\") and, above all, a letter of deepest love for his wife Sara (\\"Wedding Song\\").  In its entirety, Planet Waves is a summation of Dylan's life at the threshold of a new and better world.      In style and theme, Planet Waves and its successor, Blood on the Tracks, are near opposites.  Planet Waves is photographic, with a focus on the present moment (the album's cover lists the exact recording dates).  In contrast, the structure of Blood on the Tracks resembles a cubist painting.  Blood on the Tracks makes time crystalline by reflecting against one another the past, present and future, the observer and the persons observed.  Using this technique, Dylan tells anguished yet profoundly analytical tales of broken relationships.  The lesson of Blood on the Tracks, as I understand it, is that love exists in a realm apart from, and not fully compatible with, the ordinary events of our daily lives.      Planet Waves and Blood on the Tracks each rank among Dylan's supreme achievements for their sweep, depth, and internal cohesiveness.  Perhaps some day, as a culmination of his career, Dylan will harmonize the divergent visions of these two works.  Even if he does not accomplish this, I will always believe in the hope offered by Planet Waves.

Who knows, it may be more accurate than the Iliad.  In any case, it captures the spirit common to both retellings.<br /><br />The large cast of characters are all developed to a surprising depth.  Both sides of the conflict are fully represented and both receive the viewer's empathy.  There is no clearly defined \\"bad\\" side, and no clearly defined \\"good\\" side.  Instead there are heroes on both sides,and their stories are well-told.

B0006A9FKA|5.0|Truely one of the few movies truely worthy of a five star rating. It's so offbeat. On the second day when everything is going to pot, Shaun and his worthless buddy see a woman out in the flower bed. When she fianlly turns, groans and comes forward they says, \\"She's drunk!\\" Another good scene is when two nighbors come at them and they try to kill them with LP's. While the two zombies shamble towards them, they argue over which records they can afford to use. Sade, of course, is one of them.<br /><br />You have to be tuned into this movie from the get-go in order to discover every comedic nuance of it. Of course being well versed in the prior Dead movies is a must to fully appreciate it.<br /><br />Excellent all way around. I even had to kick my kids out of my room so I wouldn't miss any of the action.
B00007KWHG|5.0|I don't know what it is about the Four Seasons, but their music always reminded me of REALLY old music, almost like retirement home music.  That's honestly not an insult to the excellent way the songs were created- they had a very distinct singer who really brought some interesting musical ideas to the world of pop.  His trademark voice will always be remembered.  I love this collection and I believe anyone who's open to classic rock will like it to.
B000HT386M|3.0|I went into Click thinking that I would be getting a comedy with Adam Sandler running around acting silly like Billy Madison with a remote control that controls anything he points it at. I was half right.<br /><br />Like the trailer for the movie implies, in Click Adam Sandler does indeed acquire a remote controller that controls pretty much anything he wants to control with it. Sandler's signature style of humor is abundant, but the Billy Madison, adolescent humor is mostly out and some good adult humor is in, along with a pretty good story, a good cast and some good acting.<br /><br />There is an equal dose of comedy and drama in Click. If fact, Click plays more like a Twilight Zone episode than it does your average everyday routine comedy flick.<br /><br />I can hear Rod Serling introducing Click: \\"Michael Newman. A man with a good family and a career moving in the right direction. Everything any man could ask for. But Michael is an impatient man. He wants to know how it all turns out; he wants to read the last 10 pages of his life story before he reads the first 390. He wants to see the end of the movie before watching it in its entirety. But in life, there are no short cuts to the final chapter.  Unless, of course, you take a short cut through a small door at the back of your local Bed Bath and Beyond. It's not the door marked Bed or Bath. It's the one marked Beyond. The one that leads you to a shortcut through...The Twilight Zone.\\"<br /><br />Click is a good movie that pushes the family emotions button (and would have made an excellent Twilight Zone episode). Definitely entertaining and worth a rental.
B000002UB3|5.0|I grew up addicted to this album, and positively sure it was the best music the Beatles ever did.  Today, it probably still is the best Beatles album (though the White Album is a close second). <br /> <br />Something about the diversity on this album just clicks and everyone can enjoy it.  That's what made the Beatles so great.  They were incredibly talented.  Please buy if you haven't already.
B00005V0X5|5.0|This is a fabulous album from the one and only Megadeth! Megadeth has always had unbelievably talented musicians, and that talent is definitely brought to the forefront on Killing Is My Business. In my opinion Megadeth's phenomenal guitar skills shouldn't even be questioned, and on this album, Dave Mustaine and fellow shredder Chris Poland play plenty of jaw-dropping solos. The talent isn't just limited to the guitar playing, as jazz fusion drummer Gar Samuelson lays down some very impressive beats while bassist David Ellefson gives the songs fantastic bottom end with some awesome bass lines.<br /><br />1. Last Rites/Loved To Death: Very fast tune with some violent, devastating guitar riffs and a furious Dave Mustaine guitar solo. 10/10<br /><br />2. Killing Is My Business...And Business Is Good!: This tune is short, but man is it EVER awesome! The technical guitar riffs on display here are unbelievably amazing, showcasing Mustaine's incredible prowess. Mustaine isn't the only one demonstrating guitar heroics here, as Chris Poland rips his guitar to shreds towards the end of the song. Definitely not to be missed! 10/10<br /><br />3. The Skull Beneath The Skin: 10/10<br /><br />4. Rattlehead: 10/10<br /><br />5. Chosen Ones:  10/10<br /><br />6. Looking Down The Cross: 10/10<br /><br />7. Mechanix: 10/10<br /><br />8. These Boots: 10/10er great slayer-like solo at the end. A Thrash Classic! 10/10 <br /> <br />4.RattleHead: This is another one of my personal favorites because of some more great guitar work done by Chris Poland. Chris Poland is arguably the greatest guitarist Megadeth has ever had besides Marty Friedman. His solos have a great sound to them that you don't find from other guitarists. This song kicks off into high gear with some guitars coming in and then Dave starts singing. This song is about Megadeth's mascot, \\"The VIC Rattlehead.\\" After the first wave of vocals, Chris Poland does a short bluesy type guitar solo wich I love. Some more vocals come in and then Poland does another great solo. After Dave says \\"Rattlehead,\\" Poland does another fantastic solo. Another verse of vocals come in and then Poland does yet another great guitar solo. After the last sentences of vocals, Mustaine does a great solo, his only one in the song. The last vocals including \\"Rattle your god damn head!\\" finish the song. Another thrash classic! 10/10 <br /> <br />5. Chosen Ones: This is another heavy song. It's about Monty Python and The Holy Grail. The song starts off with some guitars and then the vocals come in quickly. After six verses of vocals, Mustaine does a short but great guitar solo. Ater Dave says \\"Lookout,\\" he does a longer guitar solo. It's another great one. After one wave of vocals, Dave Ellefson does his only bass solo in the entire album, but it's a good one. After two more waves of vocals, a great drumming solo ends the song. Another fantastic and heavy song! 10/10 <br /> <br />6. Looking Down The Cross: This song is about when Jesus Christ was hanging from the cross when he died. It starts out with a cool and creepy-like guitar solo from Mustaine. I like the sound of it. Then the vocals come in. Dave Mustaine has a really creepy voice in this song which gives me goosbumps. After the first two verses of vocals, Dave pulls off a terrific guitar solo. After the next four verses of vocals including a very heavy one where Mustaine yells some stuff, Dave Mustaine pulls off yet another great solo. The vocals of \\"Looking down the cross, speak no evil,\\" and a howl from Mustaine end the song. Another great track! 9.5/10 <br /> <br />7.Mechanix: This is another great song. It's about when Dave Mustaine used to work at a gas station and started fantasizing about sleeping with this rich woman who came there. This song has some of the most hilarious lyrics I have ever heard of. The song starts out with some guitars and then some drums kick in. After that, a guitar part starts and then the songs kicks in to high gear. Eventhough the vocals are hilarious, that makes the song special and fun to listen to. After vocals and more vocals, a great guitar solo yet again from Mustaine ends the song. A great song! 10/10 <br /> <br />8.These Boots: I'm really not going to tell you a lot about this song or give a rating to this song since it seems like Megadeth didn't even finish it. What I can tell you though is that it is a cover song by Lee Hazelwood. The most hilarious thing about this song is the bleeps that appear on it. In fact, the song ends on a bleep and I laugh at it every time I listen to this. I don't really listen to this one much though, I usually skip it. <br /> <br />Overall, this is a thrash classic and truely one of Megadeth's most underappreciated albums. Eventhough albums after this would have even stronger material, this is where it all started. This is a masterpiece of an album! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002GFC|5.0|Cream were a very good hard rock band that influenced many other hard rock bands.  This is a talented band that released only a few albums.  This collection of their greatest songs is one you should own because it has all the essentials.   <br /> <br />I can't imagine a better deal than buying this wonderful collection of songs for such a good price.
B000B0QOJA|4.0|I was really annoyed by the announcer stepping all over the best parts of some of the solos but even more annoyed that the best tunes are cut off probably only half-way into the tunes. Just when Trane starts stretching out, the announcer comes in and the songs are cut. Get the Village Vanguard recordings first. I saw Pharoah Sanders do a version of My Favorite Things at Blues Alley for over an hour and it was a spiritual experience that will never be equalled. I hate to think of what I missed with these recordings... it's depressing.
B000002UAX|5.0|I listened to this last night and I dont know what to say....a masterpiece by brain is still sore. They were in a league of there own no one comes close.....
B000JHS20E|4.0|Loved the colors and movement of the mobile.  The remote was a great idea, makes it easier. <br />BUT <br />has 2 volume control  BUT even the loudest setting isn't loud enough <br />wonderful remote BUT you have to start it from the base BEFORE being abe to use it AND if it remains inactive for a perid of time (like an hour or so in the middle of the night) you HAVE to restart it at the base. <br />MY SOLUTION <br />Have a cd player available and remote You get the music or sounds at the vlume you want and still have the BEAUTIFUL MOBILE.   <br />BUT  <br />the idea of a music box/nightlight after five months REALLY is not useful for us.
B000001IQH|5.0|I think people who claim to dislike this album are either giant snobs or totally lying.  Or both. <br /> <br />This album is a classic from a band that was the cornerstone of the 90s punk revival.  In an era of punk that was fairly flaky, Rancid still stands out as one of the more genuine acts. <br /> <br />Fact is, \\"Out Come The Wolves\\" is an enjoyable album, filled with top-notch punk music.  They may not be innovative at what they do, but Rancid does it really really well.
B00005JO1R|3.0|Joaquin Phoenix may have captured the look of Johnny Cash, but little else in this well-meaning but shallow biopic of the country legend.  The movie takes us back to the days before Cash became the Man in Black, subjecting us to an insecure man who struggled with his marriage, love for June Carter and drug addictions, while soaring to the top of the country western charts in the late 50's.  The film is visually very satisfying to watch as Phoenix and Witherspoon subsume themselves into the roles of Cash and Carter.  There are a number of fun cameos such as Jerry Lee Lewis and a young Waylon Jennings played by his son Shooter.  The concert scenes are the most fun, as we get a sense of the road shows that were put on culminating in the immortal concert at Folsom State Prison.<br /><br />A deep sense of anger and resentment underlies Phoenix's performance, but one never really gets a full sense of the motivating reasons.  All the viewer is given are visual references to Cash's boyhood years when he lost his brother in a sawmill accident and of his father who never forgave him for leaving his brother alone.  Cash seemed to carry this with him throughout his early recording years, but the movie leads us to assume that he drew most of his music from vicarious outlets, creating the impression that this was a man that had been to hell and back and lived to tell the story, with him ultimately admitting in front of Folsom inmates that he never experienced what they were experiencing.<br /><br />It seemed that what Cash struggled most with was his newfound celebrity status, the unreciprocated love he felt for June Carter and his embattled marriage.  Unfortunately, we never see the charismatic man that thrilled audiences and fans.  Instead, we see a deeply troubled man unable to cope with his life, and June Carter eventually rescuing him from the hole he dug for himself. This movie may have been faithful to his early years, but it was sorely lacking in the energy that propelled Cash to international stardom.tional stardom.
B00005QK3W|3.0|This isnt Pauls best work but it is a great little album and has some awesome songs.
B000HKWJDY|1.0|This service has yet to work for me.  Constantly get \\"Insufficient license\\" message.  In any case, most of these shows can be found on cable tv for free anyway.
B000002ULO|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums of all time by one of my favorite artists. Flaming Pie is genius from beginning to end. You need to listen to it. Now.
B00005JPBJ|5.0|This movie Is more gruesom and graphic than the first two movies <br />It ties in a lot with flashbacks from the previous films explianing more in depth situations you may have been puzzling over in the first few movies The story line in this movie is pretty good as well when everything unravels and you find out exactly what has happened you will agree to.  If you liked the first two Saw movies go see this or buy it when it comes out
B00004Y2QT|5.0|This DVD is the bomb! Why?  Prince puts on a show. From Morris Day and the Time- (a Must see) to the Lenny Kravitz and Prince Jam session. True Prince fans will love seeing his energy and creativity.  <br /> <br />Prince is a real performer who puts his heart and soul in every dance move and song.  <br /> <br />As for the spirituality aspect, I loved to see that side of him. <br />The song he sang was powerful and heartfelt.  <br /> <br />Get the DVD. You won't be disappointed!
B000002UDB|5.0|Is it that hard to make music like this for the musically accomplished? All you need are some surreal lyrics, orchestration, and playfulness. And, no: drugs aren't required either. Really. Goo Goo ga joob.    Even in the 60s bands stopped making music like this (appr. 1968).    Musicians have been boring people ever since.    Someone should have a psychedelic poetry contest or something.    Resurrect the fields from sour grapes. Electric peels. Now.
B00006IUL7|4.0|This is a great movie. I think Al Pacino and Robin Williams definitely clicked in this movie. The plot was excellent and Pacino shows why he is one of the greatest actors of all time.
B00005ATZT|5.0|This is without a doubt, one of Harrison Fords greatest moments. An incredible film with some of the best visual effects I've ever seen. Very dramatic with a lot of suspense. A very well written plot and an all star cast make this a very enjoyable experience to view. A film you will want to see again and again. Action, mystery, drama, thriller. There are a lot of goofs in this film if you are into looking for such, but they don't in any way detract from the overal quality of this very well done suspense drama. I highly recommend it.
B000ETRCMQ|4.0|Felicity Huffman is fantasic in this movie..a woman, playing a man, trying to become a woman..now that is a tough assignment and Huffman hits it out of the park.  I really thought she deserved the Oscar, but im sure her being on a nighttime, prime time soap, did not help her to be taken seriously in this great performance.  The actor that plays her son is good as well, and drop dead hot, he and Huffman have great chemistry so that when she must tell him the secret she has been keeping you feel the angst they both feel at this revelation.  Wonderful performances through out, the actress the plays Huffman's mother is fantastic, she really nails the part.  I highly recommend this movie, even if maybe the subject matter is something that your not that comfortable with, this film is worth the time of a viewing, you come away feeling better for the effort. <br />
B00004RFFI|5.0|This is a great suspense movie. Helen Hunt shines in her performance. Never a dull moment as you get a little taste of what it's like to live in \\"tornado alley\\". The visual effects are awesome and the whole film was incredibly well done. Very realistic and dramatic while giving a good mix with comedy and suspense. A five star cast, wonderful acting. Top notch in my opinion and hollywood has not turned out many movies any better than \\"Twister\\". Definately an addition to my list of all time favorites. You probably won't ever want to live in Oklahoma after seeing this film. I recommend this one to anyone looking for a good entertaining film. You get disaster, a love story, a few laughs, a little education on weather forecasting and a lot of entertainment. Definately the best disaster film I've seen.
B000AARKOO|5.0|Make no mistake; Kingdom of Heaven is a great movie. True, it may not be factually accurate to what we know of the crusades but what we know isn't very precise. There were no real chroniclers of the events that unfolded. What we know is sketchy at best and of course viewed and skewed from the Christian perspective.<br /><br />The movie stars Orlando Bloom as Balian, a French blacksmith. His estranged father Godfrey (Liam Neeson) a knight of Jerusalem, with a small contingent of men, visits to acquaint himself with his son. It is a time of personal anguish for Balian who is in mourning. His wife had just committed suicide after the death of their infant and a dogmatic local priest is having her disinterred so he can cut off her head. A custom, the movie explains, with those who commit suicide, so their soul cannot find their way to heaven. After Balian gives his absentee father a cool reception and sends him on his way, in a fit of rage, he kills the priest, while his shop burns to the ground.<br /><br />Now a fugitive, he seeks succor from his father and catches up with his group in time to fight off his pursuers. Though they vanquish the pursuers, Godfrey falls and dies in the arms of Balian, whom he tasks to take his place in Jerusalem. Thus begins an odyssey which finds the lowly blacksmith, Balian, not only thrown into a lordship but eventually leading the defense of Jerusalem against a provoked hoard of Muslims led by the legendary Egyptian general, Saladeen.<br /><br />Bloom and Neeson's performances are excellent and I even pictured the bearded Bloom as a young Errol Flynn. Other noteworthy members of the giant cast are Jeremy Irons as Tiberius - the kings regent, Ed Norten as the leprous King of Jerusalem and Eva Green as the King's sister and Balian's love interest.<br /><br />This was the first movie I have seen with the lovely Eva Green since her saucy performance in the highly erotic Dreamers. Although I enjoyed viewing her in the altogether it was nice to see her clothed and moving on to bigger things.<br /><br />The pomp and grandeur of the movie cannot be overstated. The cast overall was magnificent as were the truly imaginative battle scenes. The colorful costuming was spectacular and the sets, especially Jerusalem were superb.<br /><br />The movie, ably directed by Ridley Scott was filmed in Morocco (three thousand miles from Jerusalem) yet the location was perfect. It gives the viewer a true feeling of the scope and majesty of the Levant - The Holy Land - as if being there.<br /><br />This is not only a must see it is a must own. Five plus stars.it was nice to see her clothed and moving on to bigger things. <br /> <br />The pomp and grandeur of the movie cannot be overstated.

B000IMUYJM|5.0|Back in the 70's was a great year for horror movies. We got some great classics such as Last House on the Left, Halloween, and this little unknown gem Black Christmas.     This movie is set around Christmas time and has a crazed psycho tormenting a group of soriroty sisters. From the opening credits you see him sneak into the attic and it is just plain frightening.     This movie doesnt rely on gore, or nudity. Actually our hero is thinking about an abortion. The film relies on suspense and vivid murder sequences. I know I'll never have a unicorn in my home again.     After recieving my review copy in the mail, I was pleasently suprised. The anamorphic HD transfer looks amazing, very little dust and debris is shown. The commentary is very fun and gives us a look into production of this little Canadian masterpiece. My review copy had none of the other features included.     I am actually impressed as to how this movie turned out the way it did. Bob Clark is most famous for Porky's and A Christmas Story! In a way it is fun to know this fact. Try watching BC and ACS one after another and see what happens.     This movie is far better than Silent Night Deadly Night and Christmas Evil (Which were protested) This movie is just wonderful.
B00067189O|5.0|I traded my old AAD copy of Kind of Blue to get this.  I don't know what all the complaints are about.  It plays just fine on my MAC and in my DVD player.  No complaints with it in any CD player I've popped it into.  I don't know about the software download alledged by one reviewer.  I've heard of this sort of thing, I don't think I've played this on my Windows machine other than the one at work and again, no problems.  If it had tried to install a program, my machine at work would have caught that due to strict admin controls (I'm a software developer by trade).  I was able to rip the disc and play it all the time when I'm at work, so the complaint below that you can't rip this edition is simply not true.<br /><br />I found the extras on the DVD side enjoyable, especially seeing Jimmy Cobb, the sole surviving member of the ensemble that created this music.  It was also fun hearing Miles giving direction on the session tapes and the interviews with Bill Evans (radio) were great.<br /><br />I really think that those who are rating this less than 5 stars must be audiophiles of the highest order.  I love the Dual Disc format.  As far as not being SACD as one reviewer claimed, I turned the packaging over inside and out and could find no claim as to this being SACD.  If you want SACD quality, you have to buy it.  As far as Sony pulling the plug on SACD, I hardly think a review of Kind of Blue is the place to air such complaints and then misinform those reading the review that this release is something that was falsely advertised.<br /><br />If you want to see the interviews, buy the dual disc.  If you don't care about the interviews, by the 24 bit remaster.  it's that simple people.
0671027387|5.0|Dan Brown is an awesome writer. His research and attention to detail are what makes his books so very real to us, his audience. Two nights in a row I found myself in the wee hours of the morning saying to myself, \\"I have got to put this book down, I have be at work in 5 hours!\\". And the hours just fly by as he pulls you completely into the story! This is a great book, and I can't wait to read his other works!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I have never read or viewed extensively the works of Elizabeth Gaskell, however, I have found I am a devoted fan after viewing \\"The Buccaneers\\" and   \\"North and South\\". <br /> <br />North and South has become my all time favorite love story, better than Pride and Predujice, Gone  With the Wind, and all proceeding stories of the 19th century. <br /> <br />Miss Gaskell describes the difference of the new working class  compared to the gentry, and how hard it is for change in society of any kind. <br /> <br />This story combines literature, period movie, movies to see and romance all in one.   <br /> <br />I have friends and sisters who have come to visit me and watch this movie, who have gone on to order a DVD of their own.
B00003CWTI|5.0|Yeap. Is not something easy to say. May I made a fast judgement, but I'm affraid not. It's just perfect. The whole experience. Doesn't the best sound, but works anyway. PTA is a master, a brilliant Director. The actors are on the top. Julianne Moore gives the best acting I ever seen. Aimee Mann did the perfect song that matching with the story. If you don't see yet, wait for the next rainy night, take three hours of your life, stop every thing, disconnect the phone, cel and other stuffs, open your best bottle of wine and wait for to see one of the most important films ever.
B000005L86|5.0|Worth the price for two songs, 'Nicodemus' (left off the original release?) and 'Ark of the Covenant', truly some of the very finest reggae ever made.  All of it is.
0618001905|4.0|The legacy of \\"the horror\\", as Joseph Conrad put it, that the Belgium king in the title of this book imposed in the Congo is an indictment on turn-of-the-century colonialism and slavery. That the king was crafty enough to evade international scrutiny for his crimes against humanity for so long was testament to how shrewd and power-hungry he was.  <br /> <br />This book takes starts off with young Leopold's dreams of a colony for the small country which is fed by an international fixation on exploring the \\"dark continent\\" whose rough terrain and crippling diseases killed off many an exploring expedition. Of these explorers, none was more press-savvy than Henry Morton Stanley and much of the first half of the book chronicles his carreer and international stardom which draws the attention of Leopold. <br /> <br />The events that follow will scar the Congo and its people for generations. Adam Hochschild's accounts of this legacy are often difficult to read: entire villages killed to set examples to others, forced labor with the advent of the rubber industry, white officers acting as delusional madman presiding over harems, sexual torture, punishment with a chicotte (whip) and thousands of hands cut off. The advocates of \\"Congo reform\\" are also featured who range from an African-American minister who first wrote an expose on Leopold's Congo, a British consul, and champion of the cause: E.D. Morel who confirmed the use of slaves in the Congo and meticulously chronicled the autrocities there. <br /> <br />That there are many comparisons in the book of Belgian forces to the German SS of a few decades later are not suprising. The estimated deaths that Hochschild arrives at are nearly twice those of the estimated deaths of the Holocaust. That there still exists \\"a great forgetting\\" is humanity's crime against the Congo today.
B000286RNY|4.0|By all traditional aspects of how to review a movie, Shaolin Soccer was a bad movie.  It has bad acting, a predictable plot, horrendous dialog ... the best thing you could say about it was the the effects were very well done.  But it was oh so much fun! Put away your sensibilities and you can sit back and just enjoy the show.
B0006399FS|5.0|Been listening to U2 for a long time now and consider myself a fan of their work. For me this album is one of their best, if not their best beside Joshua Tree.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|This movie was great, and the directors cut was even better.  I would recommend this movie highly to anyone who likes this type of movie.
0743289412|1.0|I'm somewhat amazed at the number of excellent reviews of this book.  It's about as exciting and suspenseful as Virginia Woolfe's \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\".  I have always been a fan of Mr. King's and have usually devoured his books.  Unfortunately, that has not been the case since the late 90s.  And this one is no better.  There is obviously something in it the critics like--it's gotten very good reviews.  And I kept reading it, to a certain degree, with that in mind--certain that it would eventually start to \\"talk to me\\".  It never did.  I found his incessant word creation disruptive and tiring.  There has usually been a little of that in previous books--and a little went a long way.  But it was constant in \\"Lisey's Story\\".  Based upon reviews and opinions I have read thus far, this book will do very well; however, to those who are more of a fan of King's pre accident writing (and it has changed considerably over the past few years), this one is likely to disappoint.
B0002V7O3S|3.0|This is based on a true story involving young logger Travis Walton who was allegedly abducted by aliens and had bizarre experiments performed on him.  Is it true?  I have an open mind, and this movie never tries to convince you, it just goes about its business of showing the turmoil and disbelief that shrouded the other loggers who witnessed the alien invasion, but not the actual abduction.<br /><br />While D.B. Sweeney who plays Travis gets top billing, the movie really focuses on his friends, mainly Robert Patrick as his best friend who finds himself ostracized by family and friends, and even accused of murdering the missing Travis.  Sweeney and Patrick are both quite good in their roles.  The friends are well embodied by Peter Berg, Bradley Gregg, and Craig Sheffer.  James Garner is his reliable old self as the state investigator who never believes the abduction story.<br /><br />What really keeps this from being an exceptional movie is the slow pacing and unimaginative direction.  Filmed in 1993, special effects weren't as sophisticated and the lack of any explanation for the abduction and Travis' release only adds to the skepticism, but UFO buffs will probably eat this up.

B00004YRQA|5.0|The truth is that these memory cards do not have all that much space on them, so you will certainly want to buy two... <br /> <br />I've made thousands of saves on these cards and only ever had ONE go corrupt so to say these cards work extremely well has to be an understatement. Plus, they come in a variety of different colors. <br /> <br />There are many cheaper memory cards made by various manufacturers, but almost all of them seem to have issues of some variety, some have problems where data magically disappears, some has issues with saves failing, just avoid that hassle altogether. The cost/value ratio may seem poor at first but just surf around the web and find 2 for 29.99, you won't regret it in the long run!
B000784WMW|5.0|Jane Eyre is my favorite book, and although I have seen every version of Jane Eyre that I know of, this is the only version that I own. I believe I have seen my favorite scenes nearing thirty times, and the entire movie start to finish five or six. Recently I have been watching it while I walk on the treadmill. I never tire of it. It is wonderful. There is nothing that comes close to this version. The first time I saw it I fought back disappointment that Zelah Clarke was not prettier, but I have long since thought her performance deep and layered. Every viewing yields a new revelation. Ms. Clarke has the perfect voice for Jane, and her face is very expressive with minimal movement. She is an interesting and empathetic Jane, and a perfect fit to Timothy Dalton's Rochester. Yes, Timothy Dalton is much too handsome to play Rochester, but he is a pleasure to watch because of it, and beyond perfect in his interpretation of Mr. Rochester. He thoroughly understands Rochester. He owns this role. Period. The whole cast is wonderful, with the exception of the young Jane Eyre, who, I must admit, has always irritated me, and has not managed to \\"grow on me\\" in my mutiple viewings. But that is a minor flaw on an otherwise brilliant production. I highly, highly recommend this movie.
0307346609|5.0|When I first heard about this book, I could scarcely suppress a laugh figuring it was a farce.  Instead, Brooks pulls you into this fantastic world to the point were you start believing that there really could be a world cataclysm between the undead and the survivors.  The oral history approach gives it an air of believability and makes it a story that is hard to put down.  I'm not quite sure what it means or that it needs to mean anything.  Max Brooks has created a convincing and compelling alternate perspective on an apocalyptic vision.
B000GCFO0I|3.0|I played all of the Silent Hill games.  I used to say that proudly.  This movie is faithful to the videogame's original plot: it's a convoluted mess.  The movie looks fantastic, but I have no idea what it means.  Since it so faithfully recreates that element from the game, the fault is in the game, but why make a bad movie?  Because people like a videogame?  At least I assumed the game had a plot, as I'm still not sure what that is.  The main reasons I played the games were that the games were more about creepy noises.  I confess: it never made sense and neither does this movie.  The interesting part of the game was the 3-D free-roaming environment with monsters lurking around.  The games were good because they were 3-D and had a lot of odd linear perspective shots which were replicated for the movie.<br /><br />As much as I like the game's competition, Resident Evil has 2-dimensional backdrops which are semi-annoying, and it was cliche'd from the stories of George Romero's Night of the Living Dead trilogy.  However, the plot was at least more coherent than the muck of Silent Hill: I always knew that.  The reason for playing the Silent Hill games was not because it made sense, but because it has an original story and theme with a fantasy world like a David Lynch film, or like Terry Gilliam's Brazil, and particularly like David Cronenberg's older films, but even those films had some relevance.<br /><br />Perhaps Silent Hill was not supposed to have any meaning, but only be a fantasy of horrors with imaginative visuals and aurals to go with its gameplay.  Like Roger Ebert described, I wish the movie had not given me so much plot detail and story explanations because doing so gummed up the sensations of its mood.  The more it explained things, the less sense it made.  Silent Hill was meant as a purely subjective experience for videogame industry consumers of the time.  I confess that I never understood what the story meant when I played the games: I knew there was a cult organization, I knew there were characters, I knew there were horrors about ghosts and goblins, but I only accepted the creedence of these things at face value.  The movie should not have spent so much time with the secondary spouse character, and I don't remember that in the game or the connection with the real world either.  It could've just been a movie with a haunted house setting and interesting characters.<br /><br />Think about it if you care: the game initially started on Sony's first Playstation, and Sony was emphasizing 3-dimensional graphics, although the memory of its console was not so capable.  It was trying to compete with Nintendo who always gave videogame consumers stuffed-plush animals as protagonists.  Sony in making games with adult content, especially the first Silent Hill game, was a declaration of revolution in an industry of stuffed animals; THAT FACT GAVE SILENT HILL A LOT OF WEIGHT IN ITS IMPORTANCE AS A SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE.  Since the release of the first Silent Hill game ten years ago, Sony has outdone Nintendo in the videogame industry.  Sony won; this movie isn't needed.  Silent Hill was an extremely playable game even without a story coherence, and one with a lot of adult situational blood and violence, more as in paintings, and that was what it was worth.  The game was very playable because it offered a whole city, or town, with a completely free-roaming 3-dimensional environment, which also added greatly to the game.  But, contrary to the belief that this game would've made a great movie, I insist not.  Everyone who said so should admit to it as a mistake.  The movie has now hurt the game with answers and meanings it was never meant to have.  The events were curious enough to keep a videogame character moving to witness the violent and disturbing images for subjectivity, but I'm happy I know a bad movie when I see one.<br /><br />If the movie has one good thing going for it, it's the exceptional cinematography and that it wasn'tas brainlessly superficial as the Resident Evil movies.  Perhaps not, but this one was a bore with intresting pictures.he Resident Evil movies.  Perhaps not, but this one was a bore with intresting pictures.
B0000T70K4|3.0|Intriguing concept for a novel, and the writing is interesting. It's certainly a fast read, and worth the time. Not a mojor work, but entertaining. Certainly cosmopolis is better than End Zone, and Body Artist.
B000002AH7|4.0|there's not much more anyone can say about this recording, those of us who like it really like it and probably continue talking it up. <br />i owned the vinyl copy, without the additions, and that's how i grew accustomed to listening to it as a total piece of music. the cd copy left on the player playing the additional pieces becomes a new listening experience, one i don't really appreciate. <br />i also have a cassette copy, without the additions. not too long ago i was on a beach with headphones, listening to sketches of spain, while watching the water of the sound as it flowed in from the ocean against the blue sky, filled with seagulls and the sun shining. a very pleasurable listening experience of sketches of spain. i doubt any other piece of music would had made the day so pleasurable.

0156027321|2.0|This had some great moments: better understanding of animal behavior, the debate between different religions.  But the only way I could finish it was by speed reading.  It's claim to be a story that will make you believe in God was the most unbelievable part.  Where did that even enter into the book?  Pi was spiritual and loved God but there wasn't anything that made this survival story make you believe in God more that the next.
B000641ZA4|4.0|<br />These great Genesis songs have never sounded better than on the surround sound setting of this DVD.  They did a fantastic job of remastering these songs and making them sound great.  This treatment makes other music video DVDs I own sound tinny by comparison.  So 5 stars for the most important aspect of a music video collection -- the sound quality. <br /> <br />While this DVD is absolutely worth owning for any Genesis fan, there are some flaws: <br /> <br />-The video quality does not match the sound quality.  Many of the videos appear fuzzy and grainy.  They could have done a better job of cleaning up and restoring them. <br /> <br />-I couldn't pause, move forward, or rewind.  I've never owned a DVD where these functions were disabled.  Strange. <br /> <br />-There are no Peter Gabriel-era tunes except a 1999 cover of \\"Carpet Crawlers\\" which wasn't very good.  Surely they could have found some vintage concert footage or something to include, because Genesis had some of its most creative, if less well-known and more offbeat, work before Collins took over singing duties.  The post-Collins videos appeared high-budget, but somehow the grungy and lyrically lame \\"Congo\\" doesn't sound like Genesis to me.  I would have gladly traded that for something from their 70s work. <br /> <br />-The non-chronological video sequence seemed arbitrary.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|I have been a fan since the beginning, and I have to say that \\"A Matter of Life and Death\\" is the best album Iron Maiden have done since \\"Number of the Beast\\". If you are a long standing fan like me, then you will love this album. If you have never heard Maiden before and wonder what all the buzz is about, then buy this album and you will find out!
B000IFS0HM|5.0|One of the distinctive signs of a really, really good book, one that you can call a masterpiece, is that it leaves you something, it leaves you enriched with a little treasure of memories and imagination thaa remains with you forever. As one of Frank's teacher says in this book, talking about studying in general, it \\"stocks your mind\\". What this book does, beside being a pleasant and charming read, is exactly that: enrich your mind with all the emotions, thoughts, experiences, fears, hopes and sensations of an irish child living his desparate but passionate childhood in the slums of a little irish town. Along the way, it gives you the chance to reflect on the many aspects and consequences of war, poverty, family life,alcoholism, on the hypocrisy and damage that a religious education is often responsible for...but the real heart of this book is really in the many emotions and memoirs that bacome a little part of you.<br /><br />A friend recommended this beautiful book to me, I recommend it to you.
B000AMWIVM|3.0|I am not a fan of the slash and gore genre, but through some persuasion, my daughter got me to agree to watch Saw. Talk about quality time. It is a story of psychological and physical torture and is done reasonably well. It crosses back and forth between cheesy B movie and A material. The story of a pair trapped in disgusting and strange circumstances with the promise of release if one murders the other, it unfolds with a beautiful plot twist at the end. If you accept the premise it has gratuitous violence you can see past that to a well-crafted tale.<br /><br />Cary Elwes has a bit of a time suppressing his English accent, and his acting is somewhat corny. But it adds to the effect that the movie is low budget and to the expectation of creepy and unexpected things. Danny Glover puts in a good performance as the crazed and monomanical cop.<br /><br />I give three stars, meaning above average, because it has entertainment value and some elements of cinematic art.
B000002UAU|5.0|There are over 1,000 Amazon reviews of Sgt Peppers, which, in itself is a recognition of how many people have been touched by this legacy.    Thanks to the ease with which music today is made available (web), and listened to (Ipod), younger generations have a decided advantage with which to experience musical history.  The 60s produced a juggernaut of popular music, and musical syles that continue to proliferate.  Even a casual overview of music from that period will include the Beatles.    Sgt Peppers, Abbey Road, the White Album, Magical Mystery Tour, Rubber Soul, and Revolver represent at least a portion of the best of popular music.  Take someone like Jack White of the White Stripes.  The WS did a concert recorded on DVD at BlackPool UK in reverence to the Beatles concert there in the 1960s.  Someone with Jack's talent would not exist today without the Beatles influence, and Jack knows this.    In 1967, NBC's The Today Show at the time of Sgt Peppers release, noted how unique of an experience a concept album like Sgt Peppers was, and played \\"A Day in the Life\\" on the show.  I don't believe the Today Show staff realized that they chose the ultimate Lennon/McCartney recording to preview the album.  Before any well-documented tensions about the leader of the band, jealousy, or Yoko, had time to marinate and adversely effect their creative and healthily competitive union, John and Paul came together and did what they did best.    Sgt Peppers was the perennial recording of the band, The Beatles, in what was their last, truly unified expression as a group.
B000I5Y8ZU|2.0|Crap.  The only reason I give this album 2 stars is because these guys are almost good musicians and they play rock.  The vocals really stink, and the concept stinks.  This is MTV driven trash. Horrible.
B000683VI4|5.0|I love this movie!  Yes, it is an unabashedly romantic, chic-flick tearjerker (but hey, you're talking to someone whose top 10 favorite all-time movies include Somewhere in Time and 1994's Little Women).<br /><br />I won't rehash the plot, but let me mention my favorite thing about this movie (I plan on reading Nicholas Sparks' novel someday when my schedule is less hectic)...unconditional, undiminished love. What a beautiful gesture for the elderly Noah to spend all day reading \\"The Notebook\\" in order to get his wife back for just a few minutes. When Allie becomes herself again, she asks, \\"How long do we have?\\"  The lovers know that they only have a few hard-won minutes before dementia takes Allie away again. If ever two people were soul mates, it would be Noah and Allie, from their love spats as youngsters to their deep mutual devotion until the end of their lives.<br /><br />The acting was great, and I was impressed with the range of Rachel McAdams.  I kept thinking, that girl looks really familiar, until I realized she had been Regina in Mean Girls.<br /><br />I look forward to renting A Message in the Bottle soon. Nicholas Sparks must understand his female audience very well--we love stuff like this!  Keep it coming!!!

They deserved every uprising and revolution that they got.<br />French knighthood is singled out as one of the dumbest groups of people that humanity ever contained.<br />If there is anything about the 14th century that you always wanted to know, you find it here.

Coucy is drawn as a bright shining exception to general ineptitude, but still caught in the time's mind set and habits.<br />As not boring as it is possible to be.<br />However: I find the \\"mirror\\" metaphor a little overstretched. Yes, the century was a mess and very interesting, as was the 20th, but was it really a mirror for people looking back from the 20th? BT hardly every really goes into that. Anyway, we never learn from history. Or do we?ry really goes into that. Anyway, we never learn from history. Or do we?
B000053VAZ|5.0|I saw this around the time it was first released and have recommended it over and over--it's near the top of my list of favorite films. As far as I'm concerned, this is a must-see and am glad I finally own it. The captivating storyline portrays real-life difficult situations that anyone could experience and keeps you guessing. The performances from both the principals and the supporting cast are all superb. This is truly an ensemble cast; the three principals don't overshadow the supporting cast at all. (I was particularly taken with Dan Hedaya's performance; he impressed me in The First Wives' Club and does the same here.) Depp's seemingly effortless portrayal of a physically demanding role provides jaw-dropping amazement and humor on a grand scale. His performance here just ratchets up my admiration for his mastery of his craft. (The DVD extras didn't spend nearly enough time on how much training he went through, but what -was- shown was astounding. An excellent illustration of what hard work goes into portraying a role.) Great music, comedy, a believable and excellently portrayed story of comedy, romance, and conflict between self-sacrifice for family duties and responsiblities vs. letting go. This is a heart-warming film that will have you humming the music and leave you with the feeling that difficult situations can be resolved with the best possible outcomes for everyone involved--given some imagination, trust, and love.
B000FS9FCQ|4.0|Couldn't figure out why they hate it so much, after all anarchism is just one step above liberatarianism. But alas, this is a pretty fine movie, whether it follows the outlines of the original V for Vendetta book or not. All in all it is rather engaging and enjoyable to watch... if you are so inclined, then you will probably think about it for a little bit (and perhaps read up on Old Bailey). <br /> <br />The plot concerns a literally faceless, mysterious man who dons the mask of old school anarchist Guy Faulkes. He, his name is V, goes around and blows up building and kills coppers. He also meets a girl. She is rather smashing. Apparently the actress also played a princess in the Star Wars movies (of course, here she wears much less make-up). The government wants to stop him because they think that they are right. Maybe they are? Maybe they are not? Who is to tell anyway? <br /> <br />Remember those guys that made The Matrix, well it was the same folks as made this nice little movie. As always, their movies are greatly concerned with seemingly pleasent societies that turn out to by dystopic in reality. Also, their movies are drenched in philosophical discourse. Just as the Matrix concerned itself with causality and whatever else, this movie concerns itself with the dichotomies present betwixt deontology and teleology. For those out there who are unfamiliar with the said terminology, look it up, eh... Regardless, this movie does not necessarilly feed you the answers to these questions, because it is quite possible that there are no answers to them. Apparently the comics are more morally ambiguous, but the moral ambiguity here was quite enough for me. <br /> <br />All in all, this was certainly a movie worth seeing. It killed off 2 hours of my day and I am not sad at all. In fact I am happy. I was able to escape to a world more miserable than my own. And for people who are hopeless, remember that even in totalitarian societies hope exists and it might solve problems... or make more of them... who is to say.
0060776757|5.0|Reading this book is incredible.  You get the feeling that Larry, Adam, The Egde and Bono are your best friends when you finish it.  They \\"let you in\\" on what they feel, have felt and thought about their lives as U2 and outside of U2 as well.  It's very easy to read, great pictures and wonderful stories based on the songs, and times of thier lives and how each felt during.  It made me understand more why U2 is the greatest Rock Band in The World. And I feel like I can call all the guys friends.  I would definately recommend this book to any U2 fan, and it will make a great gift to those long time and New Fans alike.
0553801503|4.0|10-29-06 <br />First of all, let me start by saying that I'm addicted to Robert Jordan books because I need something to put me to sleep at night (LOL), and George's Fire & Ice series just manages to keep me awake. Oh well, you can't have it all I suppose. You see it takes me a year to get through a Jordan book (one paragraph and I'm falling asleep), but takes me a week to get through Martin's books. Hmmm...which book gives me my money's worth? <br /> <br />EVEN SO, this book slowed the pace a little in the series for obvious reasons, that Martin did explain (no I don't want to spell it out for you-just read the stinking book). <br /> <br />But even though it slowed down, that just doesn't bother me, I mean he's only at book 4 people. Give him a break. Where's Jordan at...book 11 !!!!! Plus a worthless \\"prequel\\"!!!! There's no denying that George has covered far more significant ground, literally written circles around Jordan with far more depth and realism, and plot. <br /> <br />I wonder who's actually making more money, Martin or Jordan? But Jordan is obviously ripping people off - and probably being very smug about it. <br />  <br />None of George's books prattle on about mindless meaningless detail (as does Jordan...ceaselessly & shamelessly going on about Tar Valon and what one sister thought about another, blah blah - I just find myself wanting the Dark One to escape and destroy them all). <br /> <br />But in Martin's 4th book, I do suppose I was getting a little tired of Jamie and his sick sister, (and their whole family for that matter) but was very glad to see how it came out in the end (only it isn't quite the end is it?). <br /> <br />But it's like, George has all the different factions and such, and family history, and culture, and you have to admit, the characters are all believable, as crazy as it sounds. The evil are believably ruthless, and the good are not ridiculously good, and there's definitely no shallow characters here - all have depth, even the hedge knights (nice touch George). Touche'! <br /> <br />BUT GET BACK TO WORK!!! I'm tired of waiting for the next installment!
0792164903|5.0|The first thing to keep in mind about this wonderfully macabre Halloween horror flick is that the plot has very little to do with Washington Irving's original story, in which Ichabod Crane was a schoolmaster, not a New York City detective sent upstate to solve a series of murders. Having said that, though, Tim Burton's film is a beautifully scary piece of work. (He has said he deliberately included a lot of the feel of Disney's 1949 animated version.) I love Johnny Depp's slightly histrionic, over-the-top performance as the neurotic Constable Crane -- and the wild-eyed Christopher Walken is perfect as the Hessian swordsman with teeth filed to points. I don't think Christina Ricci is all that attractive so I don't find her a convincing love interest, but whatever. Among the excellent supporting cast, Ian McDiarmid (\\"Senator Palpatine\\") and Miranda Richardson are especially good, and Christopher Lee even has a small part. The cinematography is dark and stormy, the trees are gnarled, and Danny Elfman's score is quintessentially spooky.
015626224X|3.0|George Orwell, whose real name is Eric Blair, was born in India in 1903. He served in Burma with the Indian Imperial Police and spent the end of the 1920s - as any self-respecting author would've done - living in Paris . Orwell later fought for the Republicans against Franco in the Spanish Civil War. He became well-known following the publication of \\"Animal Farm\\" (a satire on Soviet Russia) and died in 1950, shortly after the publication of \\"1984\\".      \\"Down and Out in Paris and London\\" was first published in 1933 and is a largely autobiographical account - though there have been a few tweaks here and there. It covers Orwell's times living on the breadline : working as a plongeur in Paris, being caught out by con-artists and life as a tramp on his return to England. The book was originally called \\"A Scullion's Diary\\" and - it would appear - focused only on his days in Paris. After it was rejected a few times, Orwell tried his luck with the stories of his life on the streets in and around London added. To be honest, I find it a pity this happened, as the stories set in Paris are much more readable. While some of the characters we meet - Charlie, for example - are far from admirable, Orwell himself doesn't come out of the book entirely unscathed. His occasional foolishness is forgivable, but his apparent snobbery and insincerity can be a bit hard to take. For example, as the book closes, he comments he'd like to know people like Paddy (a fellow tramp he'd met in England) \\"intimately\\". However, on the very same page, the news of Paddy's apparent death is met with barely a shrug of the shoulders : \\"perhaps my informant was mixing him up with someone else\\". More honestly, it's clear from how he wrote about Paddy that Orwell considered himself better than his 'mate' and - rather than getting to know him intimately - just didn't care.      Recommended with reservations : if you only read two books by George Orwell, make this your third pick.
B0001611DI|4.0|(3.5/5 stars) Listless beings meandering about the mall aimlessly, ashen-faced with blank stares; where is the horror in that? Sounds like a typical Sunday afternoon at the mall to me. In fact, Dawn of the Dead (1978) really does seem more like an action movie than it does a horror film. More or less picking up where \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" left off, zombies are on the hunt for prey across Pennsylvania. Four people arm themselves to the teeth with guns and other gear in order to survive the onslaught of lurching zombies. They take refuge in a shopping mall, which provides just about everything they need. They work together as a team and bond in the process of learning they need one another to endure. The walking dead are motivated by hunger alone and don't bring much in the way of strategy. It would be like shooting fish in a barrel if they weren't so tenacious. The four know they need to hurry out of there because there is talk on the TV of bombing areas of high zombie concentration. They have hope this epidemic is limited in area and that they will be able to find refuge among the living elsewhere. What does fate have in store for them? \\"The Night of the Living Dead\\" took place, obviously, at night and in the dark, which provided a much more frightening backdrop. It was also in black and white, which masked the deficiencies of the inexpensive zombie make-up. This is not the case with \\"Dawn of the Dead,\\" which is in color and takes place during daylight. The \\"zombies\\" are people dressed as they normally would, but with their faces painted grey. The result is anything but scary. Tom Savini's effects are hit and miss, though always disgusting. Nonetheless, this is a decent film that features some above-par acting and a decent script. The Anchor Bay Divimax DVD is also noteworthy, with a clean transfer and DTS sound mix. An extra ½ star for the effort.

B0002TT0NM|1.0|The Prisoner of Azkaban <br /> <br />Young Harry suffers as an adopted child and family servant. An insulting relative is blown away, and Harry leaves too. A magic bus takes him away. The special effects are extravagant, but seem senseless. The oddities are like something out of \\"Star Wars\\", amazing but irrelevant. The `Hogwarts' school seems to be overproducing the amount of wizards needed for their economy. Or do they have a short life in their future? Great power may create great faults. <br /> <br />The computer generated images are what makes this film interesting. The hippogriff looks great! Let's hope it doesn't drop anything on the students. Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban, where they keep the wizards who have gone bad. Black is said to be going after Harry Potter! This time we see the game of quidditch played in the rain. The winter scene and the invisible Potter recalls \\"The Invisible Man\\". Overall there is a creepy feeling to the adult characters in this film. The story begins to drag in the middle, but a big black dog shows up to drag Ron into his underground lair. A tree comes to life and attacks Harry and Hermione. Then they find a secret tunnel that leads to the castle and a surprising revelation. [Does any of this make sense to you?] <br /> <br />Special effects are no substitute for a good story. It seems confused and meaningless. Can the wing loading of a hippogriff support three people? All seems to end well given the prior events. Professor Lupin resigns, his secret life-style has been found out and the parents of his students won't approve of this behavior. Parents don't like a teacher who exploits the students. <br />\\"Harry Potter\\" panders to children in giving superhuman powers to a select few who aren't fit to handle these powers. Or is this a subtle criticism of the aristocratic ruling class? <br />

0743289412|2.0|Another 'chick book' from SK in the vein of Gerald's Game(good) , Delores Claiborne(bad) ,Rose Madder (awful) , etc.,more proof that his days of writing exciting page turners are seemingly in the past .Hasn't he written enough stories/novellas about writers by now ? The first 4 Dark Tower books were very well written , the last three an exercise in egoism by writing himself into the story(with a total copout of an ending ,if you don't like that ending -keep reading ! ) and basically a sad example of a writer with a well of ideas running dry . In this book ,a  parody of him and his extended family it's apparent that there is nothing left .Such clunkers like From a Buick 8 and Cell fortify the notion that Kings days on the best seller list will be shorter than in the past. Sad that the books like The Stand ,IT, The Dead Zone and short stories/novellas like Rage,The Body , Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption ,etal are a thing of the past . I love ya dude ,but take a long vacation and recharge your batteries before writing another book about yourself or an interdimensional portal in a  haunted car, which sounds silly even just writing it !  The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon , the subtly engaging Colorado Kid , and The Things They Left Behind are proof that you can still take it to the paint ,if only in less lengthly books !  A good book need not be overly filled with useless backround and silly  baby talk as this one was  ,but at the very least be interesting enough to hold the reader's attention  !I guess I'm the wrong audience for this book not being a reader of romance novels ,but Dean Koontz's The Husband showed he can still write an exciting page turner (when I thought he was done) no reason why Stephen King can't ,unless his wife wrote this book  !
B00005JPAD|4.0|Martin Scorsese has done many incredible things and its doubtful that this will be remembered as his masterpiece, but had anyone else directed it, the Departed would be heralded as a jewel.<br /><br />Nicholson, DiCaprio, Damon, Wahlberg, Baldwin and Sheen are all extraordinary and stretching themselves, but it's Vera Farmiga who steals the show. Maybe it's testimony to something about DiCaprio's ability to truly share the screen, but Farmiga is just as exceptional in this film as Cate Blanchet was in the Aviator. Furthermore, Farmiga is every bit the equal of Pfeiffer in her similar role inTequila Sunrise.<br /><br />Long the best part of shows like \\"Touching Evil\\" and \\"UC: Undercover,\\" Vera Farmiga brings a vulnerable honesty to her role, even as she plays against some of Hollywood's heaviest hitters.<br /><br />That said, the plot gives the audience an interesting twist on the roles of the police and criminals as each side shows its factionalism and parallels.<br /><br />It's less a tale of good and evil, than one of revelation, distrust and continuous compromise.<br /><br />It may not be Scorsese's best, but let's face it doesn't have to be to be an exceptional film by any standard.
0743289412|1.0|I'm not some fine connoisseur of great literature or a published critic which is where I expect the many positive reviews are coming from.  I'm just your average, lifelong Constant Reader.  I've purchased and read every book he's written.  And with the exception of maybe the Dark Half I've enjoyed them all.  But for me personally this was the least enjoyable work he's produced.      Certainly a big part of this is the fact that it isn't typical SK.  I get the impression that he's bottled up a desire to write something different for a long time and now that he's winding down his career he's letting it out.  Which is understandable.  But it's not just the genre-switch he pulls here (from typical SK to a grieving/romance story).  That doesn't warrant a 1 star review.  There were things about this novel that just put me off.    As an earlier review mentioned, the endless usage of fictious language, euphemisms, and phrases is incredibly irritating.    The depection of Lisey and the deceased husband as nearly perfect human beings in every possible way is also grating.  Typically SK characters seem human, good but at least slighty flawed.  Not these two.  But they are just besieged with messed up relatives, gunmen, psychos.  Poor them.  It's just too much...  Combine that with the endless language from the earlier point and it's just way too much.    Lastly, the style of the writing (particulary at the beginning) seems what would almost be considered experimental writing.  Which is probably a blast for English majors.  But needlessly confusing and complicated for the rest of us.  Flashback after flashback after flashback, mixed in with the present... It made the reading of the novel a chore.    I still think SK is the most entertaining writer of all time.  He's done enough good that 10 bad novels in a row couldn't change that.  But I implore the average reader out there, to sample this one in a bookstore first before you buy it.
0790729393|5.0|Sleepers is a deeply disturbing movie, and is difficult to watch at times, only because of its touchy subject matter. While the incidents that take place are never witnessed by the viewer, they are implied, but are necessary for the foundation of the whole movie. Whether this story is true or not, the storyline is gripping and is a good follow up to the novel 'A safe place' which would have also made a good movie. The all star cast is what will entice most viewers. With the like of Robert De Niro, Kevin Bacon, Dustin Hoffman, Brad Pitt, Billy Crudup, Minnie Driver, Jason Patric and Bruno Kirby - it is hard not to be impressed by each and everyone of their performances. Kevin Bacon is outstanding as a sadistic guard at a juvenile detention center.<br /><br />The story revolves around four boys growing up in Hells kitchen and the first half of the movie focuses on them growing up and doing their time in Wilkinsons home for boys. It is then after this we fast forward 13 years when they have all grown up and fate will have them facing their demons for the first time. Barry Levinson directs a powerful drama with an excellent music score, great dialogue and excellent pictures. The sound is also good in 5:1 surround. The DVD is lacking special features unfortunately, as you only get a trailer. A behind the scenes featurette or interviews with the stars would have been much aprreciated.<br /><br />Overall, this movie tells a very good story, one than will leave a lasting effect on you, for better or worse.

B000003C5C|5.0|Death is one of those bands who fell through the cracks to some degree and never really received the full respect and recognition they truly deserve. Chuck Schuldiner, in my opinion, is one of the better heavy metal writers and guitarists to come along and I've heard a lot in my life (hint: I'm over 40). <br /> <br />\\"Leprosy,\\" being Death's second album, stands out as one of the classic death/speed metal albums of all-time. Granted, Death's music changed dramatically as their career grew and transformed into the great releases such as \\"Symbolic,\\" and \\"The Sound of Perseverance.\\" But for those albums to have ever existed \\"Leprosy\\" first had to come. <br /> <br />My favorite songs from \\"Leprosy\\" are: <br /> <br />1. Primitive Ways - Wow. What a driving, pounding, relentless example of pure heavy metal power. Rip-sawing guitars tear away following the initial drum roll to open the song. This is one of my top ten all-time heavy metal songs. <br /> <br />2. Left To Die - My first thoughts when hearing this song is their introduction on the live video, \\"Ultimate Revenge II.\\" This is Death in one of my favorite periods when they were still raw but very much refined. A very good, driving, maniacal heavy metal song that stands out amongst others. <br /> <br />3. Pull The Plug - A guitar masterpiece that, like so many Death songs, pounds and pounds and pounds and then pounds some more. <br /> <br />All in all, Death is one of those gems who will eventually receive the credit they're due. As more people hear them and find out about them more people will realize just how great they really are. <br /> <br />R.I.P. Chuck Schuldiner
0743298020|5.0|I have now read the first 35 pages three times.  Once to get a sense of what to look forward to.  The second time, to spend time with someone who loves books and reading as much as I.  The third, to move on to the story.  Even if the remaining story was not as wonderfully engrossing as it is,I would want to own and reread this for the shared enthusiasm of Margaret who describes her love for the bookstore, the books that she \\"cares for\\" by reading them and the art and life changing experience of reading. <br /> <br />I can't wait for more from this author.
B00008CMR6|3.0|As many other reviewers have noted, Rio Lobo is not one of John Wayne's better western tales. Overall, it is pretty entertaining, but there is not much new to offer. In fact, the Duke kind of seems over the hill in this one.<br /><br />The plot is pretty simple to follow, and there are some pretty good gun fights. But, the acting is pretty lacking. Therefore, I do not recommend watching this movie, unless you are a pretty big John Wayne fan. If not, check out some of his earlier Westerns.

B000G73UEU|4.0|Unlike most reviewers here, I'm totally unfamiliar with Leonard Cohen's music so I won't be comparing the songs on this soundtrack to his versions. I was introduced to this CD by a friend who knows my diverse taste in music and I love it.<br /><br />Taken from two concerts, the soundtrack comprises a selection covers of Cohen's melancholic, poetic songs that featured in a tribute documentary to the man.<br /><br />Quite a lot of my favorite artists are on this CD; Nick Cave' doing the pleading jazz/blues `I'm your man', Rufus Wainwright (he can sing the phone book & I'll be happy) does the beautiful drawn out acoustic ballad `Chelsea hotel no.2' and the more upbeat blues tinged `Everybody knows', Beth Orton goes back to her folk roots for the acoustic `Sisters of mercy', Pulp front man Jarvis Cocker does the ghostly, faintly galloping `I can't forget', and U2 team up with Leonard Cohen himself for  the grainy melodramatic spoken `Tower of song'.<br /><br />Other songs come from Rufus' younger sister, Martha Wainwright, who does a solo eerie acoustic version of `Tower of song' and `The traitor'. Nick cave teams up with Julie Christensen and Perla Batalla to perform `Suzanne', but one of the highlights has got to be the gentle haunting piano ballad `If it be your will' by Antony.<br /><br />A good introduction to Leonard Cohen's music.
0385751060|4.0|I just found this book in a store, featured on a Notable Children's Books display. The jacket gave no clue to the subject of the book, stating something cryptic about it being too hard to describe, but merely letting on that it was about a very appealing 9 year old who finds himself at a mysterious fence (rather Lemony Snicket-ish and irrestible to any 10-12 year old). Fortunately, I decided to take a peak inside for myself to see if my 12 year old might enjoy reading it. I found it to be compelling and finished it in a single sitting, but I also found it to be entirely inappropriate for any 12 year old. This book should not be read by any child that has not already studied the holocaust and become intimately familiar with the atrocities that occurred in the camps. Of course, as an adult, I realized where the book was headed, but still found it very poignant and powerful, and will not be able to get thoughts of Bruno and Out-With out of my head for a long time to come. If a child picked this up and did not know that he was reading about the holocaust, or merely had a textbook overview of the holocaust (e.g. perfunctory knowledge that Hitler killed Jews in WWII, without knowing any details of the horrors), he would be very deeply disturbed. This book should have a Parental Advisory sticker affixed, indicating that it is only appropriate for age 16, and then only with prior knowledge of the Holocaust.
B00005JPB4|5.0|One might find an irony in the fact that this wonderfully moving, sober, sad, stirring, mournful and yet, finally, uplifting film on the horror of war and the cynical, and yet necessary, propagandizing of heroism is directed by Clint Eastwood, whose own career has often been in the service of creating mythic heroes. But Clint's heroes always had a dark side, and now in the full flush of his maturity as a filmmaker, I can't think of anyone who could have handled this material better. This is a wise and knowing film, and the themes are dealt with an understated and deft touch that can only come from someone with a lifetime of experience and a sure hand on his art.  The film is artful and direct, paring away flash and filigree for surehanded simplicity.    First of all the production is glorious.  The recreation of that sulfurous, stinking rock that was Iwo Jima is faultless.  You need only look at the montage of authentic pictures accompanying the credits at the end to see how closely these craftsman have come to getting the look of the film exactly right. 1940's America is likewise expertly captured. The late Henry Bumstead was credited with production design, and it is a wonderful final tribute to his talent.    The performances are fine, with Ryan Phillipe as the stoic \\"Doc\\" Bradley, Adam Beach the troubled Ira Hayes, and Jesse Bradford the opportunistic Rene Gagnon.  These three survivors of the original six flag raisers carry their experiences on Iwo differently, and the toll taken on them is expressed in different ways. We are told enough of the their post-War lives to learn how different civilian life may play out for \\"heroes\\" when the bands stop playing, and the crowds stop cheering. Especially modest and reluctant men who have had the label \\"hero\\" thrust upon them.    The film is an elegiacal meditation on valor and heroism.  As it cuts back and forth from the 7th Bond Tour's pragmatic \\"show-biz\\" to the real and horrific savagery of the actual battle, it isn't so much finding villains to jeer at, but rather exploring the somber tragedy of the whole enterprise of war.  We learn the Bond Tour is necessary, because back-then the Goverment actually had to finance the war through public contributions, and they were running out of money.  The Flag Raising tour was wildly successful and probably helped to finish the war.  We see among the civilians those that didn't go to war but profited at home, but they are simply noted as a fact, incongruous and often awful, and terribly human.      The cutting back and forth from the battlefield to the tour also allows us to profoundly understand why these men were often so reluctant to talk about their experiences as we see first-hand how inexplicable that experience is to a civilian life light-years removed from anything remotely approximating its stark horror. The ghastly randomness of the violence that causes the loss of beloved friends is unflinchingly brought home.    Finally, the film is truly about heroism.  The simple valor of young men and their love and sacrifice for each other, if not for a greater cause.  This is a fine and wonderful film, full of quiet emotion and a tribute to the sacrifices many have made on our behalf.  It speaks volumes in few words.  Clint's \\"Autumnal\\" films have been a wonder.  I just hope he keeps finding materials worthy of the experience and depth he has to bring to them.  This is Master work here.
B000HIVO64|2.0|This album seems to be going everywhere and ending up nowhere.  What sounds like rap influences make the surrounding music sound like its falling down a flight of stairs.  To me it was disappointing, I don't mind the direction of the sound, but would listen to David Bowie's \\"Low\\" or George Harrison's \\"Wonderwall Music\\" first.
0385335482|5.0|Rebecca Bloomwood is a 25 year old just making her way in the world of London.  However, she has a problem: she's never met a sale she didn't like.  Her line of credit that she received at graduation is now requiring payments.  Of course the irony of this is that she works for a financial magazine.<br /><br />Her excuses to avoid making payments get wilder and wilder (the letters from the various cards serve to introduce many of the chapters) and she eventually resorts to just chucking them all in trask with out reading them because \\"then she can't be held responsible.\\"<br /><br />She attempts to reduce her expenses -- but winds up spending more (\\"Well I have to buy a new pen to make the list\\")<br /><br />Then she tries a second job as a sales clerk and winds up fighting with the customers over sale merchandise.<br /><br />When both these fail she starts planning to marry a multi-millionare (amazingly she has 2 to choose from) but when that doesn't work she just *knows* she's going to win the lottery.<br /><br />I went through the book in an afternoon.

B00005JPAJ|5.0|Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu and his creative partner Guillermo Arriaga are becoming two of the more significant artists in film of this century. They have worked together on 'Amores perros' then '21 Grams', gradually going from independent low budget, highly sophisticated controversial films to the point where those who produce films are willing to invest the big bucks that it takes to create a film like BABEL. The two men, writer/director and  writer, seem to maintain an almost theatrical company around them: many of the same actors appear, the same crews, etc and the result is ensemble filmmaking whose final impact rests solely on the message of the film itself.  Though this is one of the finest casts assembled yet this year, it would be difficult to select one or two as Oscar contenders, but it is certain the film and its director will gather awards wherever they are wisely and thoughtfully given.<br /><br />The story seems complex, spread as it is from Morocco, San Diego, Tokyo, and Mexico, but the unifying element is so simple that it makes the audience shudder.  A rifle owned by a Tokyo based Japanese hunter is given to his Moroccan guide who in turn sells it to a poor Moroccan peasant whose two young sons guard and use for innocent practice until the younger son shoots at a tourist bus, injuring an American woman who is traveling with her husband, mending a strained marriage.  The couple's children are at home in San Diego with their Mexican nanny who adores them and when no friends will help her is forced to take them with her to Mexico with her loony nephew to attend her son's wedding.  All is well until the time to return home involves a foolish car chase through the Mexican American border and the nanny is arrested as an illegal immigrant despite her fifteen-year presence in California as the beloved housekeeper for the vacationing couple.  Meanwhile, in Japan, the deaf mute young daughter of the man who began the problems with his gift of the rifle to the Moroccan, longs for attention from her father and escape from her misunderstood world of silence and goes to sad extremes to gain male affection, affection which involves the police who merely want to question her father about his rifle gift.<br /><br />Sound extraordinary? It is, and yet the manner in which Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu and Guillermo Arriaga tell the story the string of bad luck coincidences focus on the problems of communication (from foreign language to sign language) deficits, misguided political obstructive processes, and the desperate need we all have for love and caring and understanding.  The cast is enormous and uniformly outstanding: Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchette are the parents, Elle Fanning and Nathan Gamble their children, Adriana Barraza their nanny (a stunning actress this!), Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal her irresponsible nephew, Michael Pe&ntilde;a (so memorable in 'Crash') and Clifton Collins Jr. the border guards, Rinko Kikuchi the deaf mute young girl, and a group of Moroccan and Japanese actors that are too many to list.<br /><br />The cinematographer is Rodrigo Prieto, the incredibly important film editors are Douglas Crise and Stephen Mirrione, and the astonishing music score is the product of the gifted  Gustavo Santaolalla.  But it is the devotion of Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu that leaves us with the punch-in-the-stomach ache that this superb film produces.  This is a tough movie to watch, but one we should all see and see again.  It is as fine as any film to be released this year.  Highly Recommended.

1596912367|4.0|Alternating between 1976 and the years 1939 to 1941, Restless is an engrossing and compelling literary thriller set in Oxford, and London, and also in Canada and the United States. A truly international accomplishment, the novel tells of an era where British Special Forces and spy networks were bought and sold in an environment where no one is who they seem, and where international humiliation was to be avoided at any cost, regardless of the consequences to the lives of loyal individuals.     It is the summer of 1976 and England is reeling, gasping for breath, almost \\"pole-axed by the unending heat,\\" when Ruth Gilmartin learns that her mother, Sally Gilmartin, is not the person whom she thought she was. Born in Russia and a British spy during the Second World War, Sally is actually named Eva Delectorskaya, who as a young girl, lived in France, and was recruited by an enigmatic Englishman, a Mr. Lucas Fromer to work as a spy for the British intelligence services, first in Europe and later in America.     At first, Ruth treats her mother's confessions like a fiction, before finally letting the dawning truth arrive. Her world is rocked at her mother's sudden revelatory detonation that her life has been built on lies. Sally, however, has finally decided to confide in her daughter, anxious to let the truth be told. A dark current of fear has begun to flow beneath the placid surface of Sally's ordinary life, and after years of serene and unexceptional living in a peaceful Oxfordshire town, she has a very real fear that someone is out to kill her.     In an effort to alleviate her paranoia, Sally enlists Ruth to track down the elusive Lucas Fromer, perhaps because only he can answer and finally put to rest Sally's hesitations about her past and the deadly game of cat and mouse that she became caught up in. Ruth learns that upon the death of Kolia, her mother's brother, Eva was enlisted by Fromer to participate in undercover operations in France, before sending her to off England and Scotland where he had her trained in Morse code, breaking codes, tampering with documents and various other covert operations.      Complete with her new talents, Eva began \\"to look and analyze the world with a precision and purpose that went far beyond anybody's simple curiosity,\\" and was eventually transferred to New York, assigned as a news reporter for the TransOceanic News Agency. Everything became undercover, and Eva worked hard alongside the British unparalleled propaganda machine, which had only one solitary and vital task: to persuade America it was in her interest to join the war in Europe.     Meanwhile, Ruth is left to draw together the fragments of her mother's incredible story where the main rule was always to trust no one and where this war time fiction moved on steadily through the international news media, accumulating weight and significance, confirming its emerging status as fact, all designed to bring America into the war, to cajole and nudge persuade and convince.     But Ruth also has her cross to bear, a single mother, and a teach of English as a second language, she is forced to confront the attentions of Hamid Kazemi, a stocky, bearded Iranian engineer who hates the Shah of Iran with a special fervor and who has been learning English from Ruth. She also has to put up with the freeloading brother of her German ex-lover who is earning extra cash as a part-time porn star and is in some way affiliated with the Bader-Meinhof gang and the world of urban terrorism.    When fragments of Eva's own forgotten past begin to surface and the associations become too evident to ignore, Ruth discovers her mother's involvement in a web of duplicity stretching from New Mexico to Canada and all the way back to England. This covert world with its interconnecting lines of deception was effectively a whole British security and intelligence apparatus right the middle of Manhattan, hundreds of agents all striving to persuade American to join the war, despite the express and steadfast objections of the majority of the U.S. population.      When Eva, however, botches a clandestine operation, a delicate balance is disturbed, and she is forced to take desperate measures to her cover tracks and to muddy the water.  Author William Boyd presents a deeply compelling account of Eva's story, as her journey of wartime espionage eventually catches up with her. Ruth tenaciously pursues any leads she can uncover, determined to hunt down Fromer, partly to assuage her mother's fears and partly to satisfy her own underhanded inclinations.       As the tension mounts and Boyd steers his story towards the inevitable showdown between Eva and Fromer, Ruth realizes that her mother's life will always be covert, and fearful, and forever watchful, always restless, always under surveillance, and suspecting. The author steadily builds the tension and ratchets up the action, especially when Eva is forced to go on \\"the run\\" to Canada. The final dénouement is particularly gratifying in a total page-turner that evokes a shadowy world where we all have secrets, and where no one knows even half the truth about anybody else, however close or intimate they may be.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|Serenity was superb!!  If you get a chance, watch the Firefly series.  If you don't you will be missing out on one of the best shows ever made.  The characters, the plot, all the action....I could go on forever.  Mostly the characters.  You truely begin to love them for who they are and you are almost right there in the show rooting for them through every adventure.  This show is an absolute MUST SEE!!!  I would love to see a second series (third, fourth...) or even a sequel to Serentiy at the very least.  I can't tell you how many times I've watched both. <br />Firefly was (and is) a jewel among so many shows that we've seen before.  Buy, rent it, WATCH IT.   <br /> <br />
B0002F7I9Y|1.0|I was disappointed in some of the songs on this CD, particularly the one with Willie Nelson. Ray and Willie's rendition of \\"Seven Spanish Angels\\" would have been a much better selection for this CD than what they did. I skip that song when listening to the CD. He and Nora Jones did a fabulous job as well as he and Gladys Knight, and he and BB King. The CD is worth having for those three songs. <br />
B0009353IW|4.0|Being a long time Cooder fan since the 70's this album is a classic case of excellence.Sung mostly in Spanish the tunes are colorful as is rich.The opening track Poor Man's Shangri-La to Soy Luz y Sombra the last one are wonderful.Ry isn't afraid to explore any area of music whether its rock,jazz,folk or pop.He's the kind of person who never forgets where he came from and his grace and humbleness is award winning.One song I forgot to mention is 3rd Base,Dodger Stadium.One verse goes like this....Mister,you're a baseball man,As anyone can plainly see.The straightest game in this great  land,Take a little tip from me. This album is not for fast Ry Cooder fans after all he's not in his 20's or 40's anymore he's calmed down in the slow lane but not in his story telling. Enjoy! God Bless you! Ry
B0007PLLQ0|2.0|Okay, I've wanted this film for a very long time, so this year I finally get around to ordering it.  However, I wasn't aware that Ridley Scott ever put together a director's cut nor does the information contained about this particular edition say anything about this DVD being the director's cut.  So, it gets delivered, I open it up excitedly...and see a box on the cover that says INCLUDES RIDLEY SCOTT'S DIRECTOR'S CUT WITH JERRY GOLDSMITH'S SCORE.  Okay, cool.  It INCLUDES the director's cut.  That implies that BOTH the theatrical release AND the director's cut are on the disc.  Not so.  This is ONLY the director's cut...and to be honest, it's not all that great.  And Goldsmith's score is NOT one of his better ones.  I was WANTING the Theatrical Release with that wonderful score by Tangerine Dream, the version I remember seeing so many years ago.  So, now I have to shell out the money for the ULTIMATE EDITION which has both versions on it.  If Amazon is going to sell two versions of this film it really needs to state clearly which is which.  I feel about as shafted as when I bought \\"The Exorcist\\" on DVD...only to get THE VERSION YOU'VE NEVER SEEN, which was equally lame.
B0009VRHLK|5.0|Beautiful film. Certainly not for everyone. Take a look at the reviews below. If you prefer something action-packed, explained, traditional cinema, then this may come off as boring and/or pretentious. But if you are able to enjoy film that ventures to the netherregions of cinematic convention, then this is one that IMO is a winner.<br /><br />Much of the film is Bud Clay's cross-country trek filmed with little to no dialouge with scenes lasting more than several minutes of mere face shots and road scenes accomponied by sad ballads. All we know is that he is traveling to a race from PA to CA and is trying to locate his ex-girlfriend whose brown bunny has outlived the possible lifepan of a bunny.<br /><br />Even the most patient viewer may get a bit frustrated, but come the haunting ending, I think the patience will have paid off in a grand way.<br /><br />Vincent Gallo has created another gem (the other being \\"Buffalo '66\\")<br /><br />Check it out, but be warned.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|I have to admit I am far removed from the MTV scene being that I was born in the 60's.  So with that in mind understand that when one of my college students made a copy of The Black Parade for me I was skeptical.  The title conjuring up images of teenagers huddled in their parents' basement devising some scheme against \\"those who do not understand them\\".  He explained that because I listened to music from the 70's that I would like it.  I scoffed but decided to give it a try because I knew he would bug me until I did.   <br />I have to admit this album is impressive.  These young musicians were obviously influenced by some of the great music that I grew up listening to.  It is smart, fun and catchy.  There is, shall I say, a grandness to it that harkens back to those theatrical musicians that I love...Pink Floyd, Queen, David Bowie, E.L.O. and even some Cheap Trick. <br />I have had it on repeat now for a good part of the day and I hear something new each time.  For those of you from my generation who may be opposed to anything new I suggest you give it a listen.  It is good rock.   <br /> <br />
0060723513|3.0|my sister shared this book with me back in march when dad was first diagnosed.  someone she knows shared it with her.  i will pass it on to my neighbor who is going to the outback--in hopes that it will enhance her journey.  i am lost in my imagination about this woman's life--particularly her life after re-entry. <br /> <br />in this book, marlo morgan, an accomplished doctor from kansas city, a middle aged white woman who attends conferences and gets invitations and accolades and honors, a regular overachiever, finds herself abducted by a tribe of aliens in the australian desert--and she crosses it with them, learns their secrets, gets inducted into their society and expelled, rather abruptly, from their group with the dictate: carry our message. <br /> <br />her aliens are a secret, forgotten aboriginal tribe who go on walkabout, eat bugs, are usually naked, and claim to be the real people--the original people--the unaffected tribe of actual human beings who remain, largely, as god created them--with little interference from other cultures or civilizations.  they are a fascinating bunch--who the reader comes to regard with the writers admiration--that tell a cautionary tale about what disappears, what dies out, what gives itself over to extinction when it seems impossible to find a way forward without assimilating, and thereby losing, your way of life. <br /> <br />though i never warmed up to the character of marlo or any others in the story, i cut the writer a break--as she is mostly accomplished doctor rather than great writer.  i chose to feel her feelings for the tribe--though they are conveyed in guarded ways--full of the secrecy she was asked to keep.  marlo, though not a warm character, is a character i can relate to, and her journey--no matter how much of it is imagined--is compelling and wonderful and gory and interesting and gross and provocative and mystical and feels true. <br /> <br />i am lost in the world she created--thinking often of how hard itis for me to come all the way back from world experiences that change me--and wanting the sequel of her re-entry saga.  i would love to attend a lecture by the author--or meet her in a kansas city supermarket and share my fascination with her book.   <br /> <br />i recommend the reading--the book provides unique insight about humanity's origin, what we REALLY need,  what's really important to our survival, what we've lost, and what we haven't really gained.  it is a powerful idea to contemplate: what do we not know about that we lose by living the way we do? what else disappears from the earth when we chose global warming over a deeper understanding of the globe and those alive on it?
B000003CM9|5.0|What a masterpiece this is! If you enjoy a combination of  rock, soul, blues, jazz then this will appeal to you.<br /><br />Although this is a short album, the brief nature of it works well...it leaves you wanting more. The duel guitar playing was so tremendous that it made the solos sound like vocals rather than self indulgent notes.<br /><br />It starts with \\"Revival\\" which is perfectly titled. The song starts out as a jazzy, instrumental but then turns into a wonderful call and response tune. It is very uplifting and one of my favorite Allman Brother songs.<br /><br />\\"Don't keep me wondering\\" is a scorching rocker with great, greasy, slide guitar. Dune Allman employs a terrific fat tone.<br /><br />\\"Midnight Rider\\" is a classic song that epitomizes the Southern Rock sound. Check out the interplay between the guitars of  Dickie Betts and Duane Allman.<br /><br />\\"In memory of Elizabeth Reed\\" is an instrumental. It is jazzy yet it also remains in a true song structure rather than an excuse to play a lot of notes. The Allman Brothers never noodle on the guitar. Every note counts<br /><br />\\"Hoochie Coochie man\\" is another blazing rocker featuring Duane Allman's slide.<br /><br />Besides the awesome guitar you also get Greg Allman's soulful, whiskey throated vocals and classic Hammond organ sounds.<br /><br />The duel drumming rocks, Berry Oakely's bass playing is stellar and most of all, this was an incredible work for such a young band.<br /><br />For anybody not familar with this band, this is an excellent starting point. I do not believe in compilations for this band b/c they were too good and have way too much depth. You cannot reduce a monumental band like this to a compilation. \\"Idlewild South\\" reflects a great period of this band when they were building maturity and confidence that would be more fully demonstrated on the next album, \\"Eat a Peach\\"
B000EULJLU|4.0|Tool fans have waited 5 years between albums for the second time in a row.  From Aenima to Lateralus, and now 10,000 Days.  The wait is over and the new sound is absolutely astonishing from the first note.  The opener, \\"Vicarious\\" has an eerie yet familiar intro to get the listener begging for the song to break.  When it does, the sound fills your soul with incredible force!  Going right into #2, Jambi, the energy continues with some very eclectic drumwork by master Danny Carey.<br /><br />The standout and obvious choice for best track is #5 \\"The Pot\\", a reference to an idiomatic term for hypocrisy (i.e., the \\"pot calling the kettle black\\").  Opening line.....\\"who are you to wave your finger, you must've been out of your head\\".  Anyone who finds this and the two opening tracks less than stellar are certainly out of their heads as well.<br /><br />There is a fill of instrumental work strewn throughout the album to showcase the musicianship of Tool, while these heavy hitting songs listed above create a lyrical labyrinth for the listener to follow.
0896762173|3.0|Excellent reference for illustrators and animators. However, \\"Costume in Detail\\" only covers women's costuming, which is unfortunate considering the attention the author paid to the material.
0743289412|1.0|This is more a commentary than a review, because I'm still reading the book. I like the story so far and as I read on I'm looking forward to enjoying the good things about this book that other reviewers have pointed out. However, it's good to see that other readers also think King way overspent his treasury of invented words this time.  <br /> <br />Usually, the invented words add a nice touch of realism to King's books; most families, spouses, and friends have phrases or made-up words that have special meanings, so the neologisms help to make the characters come alive. In Lisey's Story, though, it seems like every other paragraph contains one of King's invented words, and they're so overused that they become tiresome. \\"Smuck\\" and its variants are especially annoying -- King uses it liberally, but he also uses the actual sound-alike curse word elsewhere in the book. So why invent \\"smuck\\"? King should have either used the real word consistently, or deleted it altogether. Fewer invented words in general would have been better.
0399230343|5.0|Little Cloud is one of Carle's more recent books. Carle started illustrating and writing books in the late 1960s. Of the Carle books I've read there are only two that I don't enjoy: The Very Hungry Caterpillar and The Very Greedy Snake as both are focused so heavily on gluttony.Little Cloud instead teaches through example the importance of being an individual and being a contributing member of a group. <br /> <br />Until the end, each page has a different shape that Little Cloud has created on his own. There's an airplane, a hat, and a variety of other shapes that children will easily recognize. In the end, his hat joins up with the other clouds who have together formed a clown.
0307346609|5.0|I love The Zombie Survival Guide.  I didn't exactly laugh out loud while reading it, but it was exactly what I expected, as an avid lover of zombie cinema.  Max Brooks is a very talented writer, and that really gets a chance to be displayed in this book.<br /><br />I wouldn't exactly call World War Z a story, because it has no narrative.  The book consists entirely of Max Brooks (the fictional journalist responsible for writing the survival guide that got many people through the Zombie War) interviewing people who survived the war, and had important roles in it.  Almost every possible angle is covered.  There are interviews with military personnel, scientists, government officials, and regular citizens who survived on their own.  Brooks' writing creates a desolate, horrible world during and after the war that is truly more terrifying than most horror books I've read in my lifetime.<br /><br />This book is not only for zombie fans, although those of us who are obsessed with the walking dead will love it that much more.  Literally any reader can pick up this book and love it every bit as much as I did.
0765315246|4.0|Just as Bob Seger only wants \\"old time rock n' roll\\", I only want old time sci-fi.  Mr Scalzi takes an old premise, hangs a new hook on it, and carves out a unique niche in military sci-fi.  He combines elements of \\"Starship Troopers\\" with \\"The Forever War\\" and throws in a dash of John Ringo to produce a book of superb sci-fi. <br /> <br />His premise -- that it is the old (over 75), who fight the wars in the ideal, extremely augmented, cloned bodies of their youth  -- is the core of a novel that deals with sexuality in a way Heinlein couldn't in the '50s, with the futility of war in a different way than Haldeman did in the '80's and '90s and the humanity of the soldier in a way that Ringo does so well in his \\"Empire of Man\\" seies. <br /> <br />Well thought, well conceived sci-fi, Mr Scalzi is on my must buy list.
B00009NHC5|5.0|I always loved this film. I love any film with Audrey Hepburn but this one is exceptionally good. It's such a great story! Audrey convinces the viewer that she's the character and \\"she\\" takes him/her to that world she lives in. It's classy, it's beautifully done. A must see.
B000056NX5|5.0|The final week of Jesus' life makes for masterful storytelling. It's full of the agonies of deep reflection, and the hope that human existence is not without some meaning. It's got jealousy, rivalry, hate, lust, greed, torture, fear, self-doubt, and, yes, all-out betrayal of the most brutal, blood-soaked kind. Yes, the story of a vacillating Jewish mystic who was the inspiration for a major religion is great, and this version of Andrew Lloyd Webber's still-controversial 1970's musical is my favorite of the many productions I've seen. Here a nice twist comes in and takes the form of the evolution of the set and characters, as we begin with pseudo-modern-looking performers and backgrounds, and gradually over the course of the next ninety minutes everything shifts to looking like some neo-post-modernist version of Jerusalem circa 30 CE. The excellent Glenn Carter in particular takes his version of Jesus from a man who'd garner nary a sideward glance on twenty-first-century streets, thru a vaguely Greek-looking Christ, to the full-fledged Jesus of Sunday School familiarity. The cast here, mixed in ethnicity and nationality, achieves a superb synthesis of purpose and meshes together as few groups of actors do, until these individuals convincingly weave together a story that is ancient and modern, timeless, universal, and as powerful now as it was at its first telling nineteen-hundred years ago. Jesus Christ Superstar has it all: great music, outstanding performances, and a re-telling of a story that launched a change in world civilization that continues with no end in sight.
B000IOM0YM|5.0|On Saturday night, Oct 28, 2006; VH-1 broadcast about half of the Houston concert, and showed clips from some of the other sections of the DVD's, along with previewing some of the Easter Eggs. For instance, one of the Easter Eggs is the ONLY make-up era KISS performance without make-up -- at Ace Frehley's wedding! The band was DRESSED TO KILL in their black tuxedos, and there are some other very cool surprises as well.<br /><br />Some of the video footage was grainy and looked aged, while other footage looked like it was shot last night!<br /><br />Vol. II (1978-1992) and Vol. III (1993-2005) will feature some great stuff as well -- such as a Dynasty era show in which all the solo album singles were performed as part of the same set list, a show from the Creatures of the Night tour, and some concept video footage from The Elder.<br /><br />Vol. III will feature footage of the KISS Conventions, with the performance in which Peter Criss joined the band for a couple songs, and of course, there will be a show from the reunion  1996-1997 Alive Worldwide tour, some Psycho Circus material, and lots of rehearsal, soundcheck, and pre-show and post-show backstage footage will be also included.<br /><br />This is the MOTHER LODE -- and these nine DVD's (including the limited edition BONUS DVD's that will appear in the first pressings ONLY) may go down as a piece of musical KISStory on the level of The BEATLES and LED ZEPPELIN DVD sets!
B00005K3NR|5.0|\\"Carrie\\" from the mid 1970's remains among the very best in horror cinema even today! The atmosphere holds a solid chill in my bones from start to finish. The performances by the two leads Sissy and Piper are Oscar worthy! The rest of the cast fall right in order with perfection. The films finale in the gym and to the closing credits is shot with brilliance by the superb Brian DePalma. \\"Carrie\\" \\"may\\" be the best Stephen King adaptation ever.. it differs from the book in ways but, it still holds true to the just of the novel enough for me. Both the movie and the book stand on their own.. you can watch the movie and be surprised by things that arent in the book and vice versa. Of course with all book to movie films, there is always things from the book that do not make it to the motion picture. This film is a true tale of revenge and, deserves to be hailed as the masterpiece it is!<br /><br />Other good King adaptations: \\"Stand by me\\", \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\", \\"Misery\\", \\"Dolores Claiborne\\", \\"The Green Mile\\", \\"Pet Sematary\\", \\"The Shining\\".
B000HCO83Q|1.0|I absolutely love the X-men.  I've followed them all my life... some 35 years.  I've watched all the different X-men cartoons on TV.  That's why I hate to say that I'm horribly dissapointed with this movie.  This story completely ignored the cartoon plot or anything I know about Phoenix.  They killed 3 of the superheroes, all of who died for no good reason.  The movie felt like I was watching friends get murdered.  I'm going to watch Xmen I and II and pretend like Xmen 3 was never made.
0684135051|5.0|What can I say about EZ that has not already been said?  She was a wonderful lady who didn't hold back and was passionate about knitting, without apology.    She legitimized my method of knitting when I felt so alone in the world.  While I don't share her dislike of the purl stitch, I do like her conversational writing style.    She taught me what a \\"real sweater\\" is.  And for the first time in my life, I've been enjoying them.  She taught me to love wool, a much misrepresented and misunderstood fibre.  I love the \\"bathing a baby\\" feel of washing handknit socks and real wool sweaters.  And the difference in comfort between a real wool _sweater_, and a cotton knit top or an acrylic monstrosity (which I never felt comfortable wearing), is worlds apart.    She taught me independence.  There are people who are taught how to KNIT, and people who are spoon fed via patterns.  For many years, I was one of those - stuck in a pattern dependency rut, although there was clearly an independent knitter screaming to get out. Understanding the basics, the theories behind shaping garments is essential for understanding knitting in general.  She flipped on the light switch for me where that is concerned.  Now, instead of \\"looking for a good pattern\\" for something, I am using my own head to create, and that is such a good feeling.      Even though I am a visual learner by and large, she explained it much like my grandma would, sitting beside me in the living room beside a warm fire.    This dear lady left a legacy that I am glad her daughter Meg Swanson is carrying on - a love of knitting that will last for generations to come.    My only criticisms, which exist but are not enough for me to remove stars, are that this book is NOT for true beginners, and that it is not visual for those who need many pictures.    If she had been permitted to give her book the title of \\"The Opinionated Knitter\\", perhaps people would not have been led to believe that it was a how-to for rank beginners.  This was not her fault.
0743270754|5.0|Fantastic read.  Goodwin makes well-travelled history new again by focusing specifically on Lincoln, his cabinet, and how he dealt with the various political conflicts during the civil war.  Excellent description of how Lincoln played off the various factions to unite the North.  NOT about specific battles, except in their political context, and very brief at that (Gettysburg occupies all of three pages, though the address covers a bit more paper).  NOT particularly about the generals either, except how they interacted with Lincoln and his cabinet.  It's a long read, and you won't get through it very fast, but it's worth it!  I learned a lot about Seward, Bates, Stanton, and Chase.  Ideal for those interested in a different side of the civil war, those interested in Lincoln, or those interested in American political history.
0060574216|1.0|F this self-help industry crap. Quasi-astrological poppycock at its worst. I can tell this book clamps on to the mind and squeezes it to death merely by reading the cliched title. Humans are far more complex than the hack Man-Warrior/Female-Maiden title what's-his-name gives them. And remember, this \\"doctor,\\" is quietly making mucho mucho bucks off your poor purchase. Your goddamned ancestors never needed a book to run their lives, so why do you? Let's push all the life coaches off cliffs and put the self-help industry to the torch. That's a great start to a sane life.
B000IOM0YM|5.0|As others have said, KISS collectors have seen most, if not all, of this material.  But this DVD puts it all together, in the best possible condition.  A very welcome addition to any KISS collection, particularly so for those fans who long for the good old days. <br /> <br />This is it!  A must-buy.
B000I5Y8ZU|1.0|its terrible, its derivative, predictable and a huge disappointment...if you liked the frenetic paced earlier albums you will hate the Black Parade. Sure they throw in some interesting nods to 70s rock with this 'concept' album but it comes off as ill-conceived. Its basically punk by numbers, prime for MTV airplay and the genero-rock fans.
B000HT3P7E|5.0|This is a great TV show currently out right now. The show is about a middle-aged man, Ted Mosby, who tells the story to his teenage children of how he met their mother.  This is easily one of the best shows of the decade.  The humor and sexual innuendo are outrageously funny.  The narration of the story to his children shows a sentimental spark.  It is definitely a great DVD set for those who enjoy modern 21st century humor or have a special place in the heart for a special someone.
1400032717|5.0|As a teacher, I found this book to be very informative.  For the first time, I really feel like I am better able to understand what goes on in the mind of some of my autistic students.  Yes, I've read books and watched videos on the topic, but this very entertaining book gave me some great insight!  A quick read, informative and very well done!
B000050FEN|1.0|This movie is weak, poorly written and has some laugh-out-loud stereotypical cop-schlock dialogue. The acting is sub-par for such a wonderful cast. How numb are we to poor writing that we accept such drivel? I'm amazed at the way people compliment this film. Really- Deep? Symbolic? c'mon! This is film is as about as deep as a kiddie pool.
B00006F7S4|5.0|Thought i would add my 2 cents on this album, I love it!! Everyone says \\"Mutations\\" But i love this album because Beck drops the \\"Lyrical Sctick\\" and just plays from the heart, not to say the lyrics arent great they are very much so, they just seem more thought out and less off the cuff. \\"Guess I'm Doin Fine\\" is a great song \\"Lost Cause\\" is one of my favorites by far on the album \\"Round The Bend\\" \\"Already Dead\\" \\"Sunday Sun\\" \\"Little One\\" ALL Marvelous songs, Buy it!!
B000EHRVP6|4.0|Gore and horney backpackers aside, this movie was very good.  Disatisfaction abounds with the super wealthy, here they are, they have everything money can buy, trophy wife, yacht, servants, 3 or 4 homes around the world a garage full of cars.  And yet, they still want more.  What they really want is satisfaction and inner peace.  And that is gotten thru spiritually.  Enjoy!
B00005JPBP|4.0|This is basically a good, but not great, movie--I'd give it 3.5 stars if the system allowed. It's a tale about two competing magicians whose intense rivalry escalates to the point of obsession. There are plot twists aplenty. Even though I figured out one big reveal early on, there were lots of other mysteries and surprises to keep my mind engaged. <br /> <br />The only problem, the reason I'm giving it a merely \\"above average\\" review, is that it was all so cleverly done for about half the movie--everything that happened had a logical (though perhaps far-fetched) explanation so that you could figure out a lot of things if you were paying attention. I was having fun trying to keep up! Then, suddenly, there's a deus ex machina plot device that demands utter suspension of disbelief ... I found that quite disappointing and it detracted a lot from my enjoyment. <br /> <br />Other than that--great movie. I just wish they'd been clever enough to work out the plot in a more plausible way.
B000JLTRIG|5.0|Season 7 is a very interesting year for the world of Charmed. When it is bad, it is REALLY bad but when it is good, it is REALLY good. It really is a hit or miss situation. <br /> <br />The best episodes would have to be the ones near the end of the season but there are also some spread out through the season. Some of the best: Something Wicca This Way Goes, Witchness Protection, Charmed Noir, The Seven Year Witch, Srcy Hard and Death Becomes Them. <br /> <br />The worst episodes: A Call To Arms, The Bare Witch Project, and Once In A Blue Moon. <br /> <br />The Complete Rundown: <br /> <br />1. A Call To Arms - When Piper and Leo attend a Hindu wedding, they become possessed by Hindu gods. This episode is alright, but doesn't seem strong enough to be a season opener. <br /> <br />2. The Bare Witch Project - A student at magic school accidently conjures Lady Godiva, and the sisters must help return her to her time so she can finish her ride. Slightly better than the premiere but still doesn't live up to \\"Classic Charmed\\" <br /> <br />3. Cheaper By The Coven - Chris' wiccaning is upon us and the sister summon Grams for help, but when a spell goes awry, the sisters revert to their teenage selves. Fun episode that brings back favorites like Grams, Patty and Victor. <br /> <br />4. Charrrmed! - A pirate comes to town searching for the fountain of youth. Most people did not like this episode, but I did find it entertaining. Depends on your tastes. <br /> <br />5. Styx Feet Under - The Angel of Death is back after Paige casts a spell that blocks all death. Very well done episode, really good acting here. <br /> <br />6. Once In A Blue Moon - The sisters are transformed into beasts. Bad episode. Really boring. <br /> <br />7. Someone To Witch Over Me - Guardian Angels are being captured. Meanwhile Leo goes on a vision quest. Fans of Drew Fuller will enjoy this because Chris makes an appearance. <br /> <br />8. Charmed Noir - Paige and Angent Brody are trapped in a 40's Noirbook. One of the best episodes of the season. Smart, fun and true to the time period. <br /> <br />9. There's Something About Leo - The sisters find out Leo is an avatar and the consequences are dire when Kyle Brody finds out. Interesting episode. <br /> <br />10. Witchness Protection - The Seer is under attack and the sisters reluctantly help her. One of my favorites, Charisma Carpenter is great as the Seer and she finally gets more screen time than in Cheaper By The Coven and Styx Feet Under. <br /> <br />11. Ordinary Witches - Paige takes Kyle back to the past to find out how his parents died. Interesting episode, but more leading up to the next episode/s. <br /> <br />12. Extreme Makeover: World Edition - The sisters are about ready to makeover the world, when Kyle casts a paranoia spell on them. Good episode. Serves as a part one to Charmageddon. <br /> <br />13. Charmageddon - Leo forms an unlikely alliance with Zankou so he can try to reverse the change. Good episode, conclusion to Extreme Makeover: World Edition. <br /> <br />14. Carpe Demon - Drake, an ex-demon, applies for a teaching position at magic school and ends up taking Phoebe on a wild ride around San Francisco as Robin Hood. <br /> <br />15. Show Ghouls - Phoebe and Drake are transported back to 1899, to help find out what happened at a cabaret. Fun episode. <br /> <br />16. The Seven Year Witch - Piper ends up in a coma, Leo loses his memory and tries to find his way back to his family and Cole returns to restore Phoebe's faith in love. GREAT episode, and also features the final appearance of Cole. <br /> <br />17. Scry Hard - Wyatt shrinks Piper and Leo into a dollhouse. Good episode, exciting. <br /> <br />18. Little Box Of Horrors - The sisters must find Pandora's box before someone unleashes the evil inside. Good episode but not as exciting as some episodes before it. <br /> <br />19. Freaky Phoebe - An ugly sorceress switches bodies with Phoebe. Alright episode. <br /> <br />20. Imaginary Fiends - Wyatt's imaginary friend is a demon who is trying to turn him evil. Good episode, also sees the return of Adult Wyatt. <br /> <br />21. Death Becomes Them - Dead innocents from the sisters' past comes back to haunt them, thanks to Zankou. Great episode. Dramatic, emotional and all around good. Also serves as a part 1 to Something Wicca This Way Goes. <br /> <br />22. Something Wicca This Way Goes - The girls finally go after Zankou when he gains control of the Nexus. Great episode. Was originally intended to be both a season finale and a series finale. Conclusion to Death Becomes Them. <br /> <br />As you can see, there are many more good episodes here than bad. There are just as many clunkers here than with any other season, perhaps even less than usual. With the show still up in the air, the finale was intended to be a series finale if necessary, but thankfully we get one final season. <br /> <br />I recommend this to all fans of the show, especially seeing as we are now in the home stretch. 7 down, 1 to go! Enjoy it while it lasts!
0783219695|5.0|As someone who has been fascinated with space flight since childhood, and who well remembers the real Apollo 13 from his teenage years, I found this movie a fascinating reminder of history. It even includes clips from old TV newscasts.<br /><br />There are only minor omissions and inaccuracies in the film. The first critical burn of the lunar module's descent engine, done some six hours after the explosion and designed to change the hybrid trajectory back into a free-return trajectory, is not shown at all. The lunar landing is portrayed as doomed when the decision was made to (irreversibly) shut off the remaining fuel cells in the (incorrect) supposition that the oxygen leak was originating from the fuel cells. In actuality, the lunar landing itself was doomed the moment the main Bus-B under volt occurred, indicating that the first fuel cell had died. (Mission rules forbid a lunar landing if only one fuel cell becomes inoperable, even if nothing else is wrong).<br /><br />The movie captures the drama of ground control trying to figure out what went wrong. Simulations had allowed for the failure of one oxygen tank or perhaps one or at most two fuel cells, but no one imagined the loss of both main oxygen tanks and all three fuel cells, leaving the Odyssey itself with only several hours of remaining oxygen, water, and electricity. The initial belief was that a meteoroid must have hit the ship. This one-in-a-million possibility was soon discounted, and the real culprit was later identified: A short circuit inside an oxygen tank leading to a fire, followed by an explosion that not only shattered the oxygen tank, but also ripped off the entire side off of the service module and which punctured the remaining main oxygen tank.  With no oxygen to support them, all three fuel cells started dying.<br /><br />The movie captures the decision not to attempt to fire the service module engine in order to reverse the flight direction in a deep-space abort. But this lengthened the return trip and led to the realization that the lunar module had insufficient electricity and other consumables to support the crew of three all the way back home. This led to the decision to power everything down--a strategy that worked, just barely.<br /><br />The severe cold aboard the ship, a secondary consequence of the powering down of all nonessential equipment, is well illustrated. The astronauts had a frosty breath. Some got urinary infections. They had a hard time getting comfortable enough to sleep.<br /><br />The astronauts were slowly being poisoned by their own carbon dioxide. This was solved by the jury-rigging of the lithium hydroxide \\"scrubbers\\" of the command module to get them to fit into the circulation system of the lunar module.<br /><br />The astronauts were not out of the woods even when they were finally close enough to earth for re-entry. The movie shows the remaining danger points: Could the electronics of the command module be functionally revived in spite of the dormancy and the cold? Did the heat shield of the command module get cracked during the explosion? Could the cold have immobilized the thrusters, making it impossible to orient and steer the command module during re-entry? And, finally, is it possible that the parachutes had been frozen together by the cold? For those unfamiliar with the ending, I will not reveal it in order to maintain the suspense for the reader who wants it.the return trip and led to the realization that the lunar module had insufficient electricity and other consumables to support the crew of three all the way back home.

0060012218|3.0|This novel is quite well written .. it flows and the characters are real -but they all lacked enough depth.  I wanted more from this book - I wanted more real feeling and more real emotion. I kind of felt like I was reading a police report - just the facts and nothing more.<br /><br />It's a simple little book that is easily read in 1 or 2 sittings. Although not perfect, this book is worth reading and can be enjoyable enough. Not a stand out novel but not something to forget about either.
1932100660|5.0|A book is most impressive when it causes one to reconsider long-standing beliefs. This is such a book. I admit to always being vaguely suspicious of the health benefits of vegetarianism, thinking that it was based more on the principle of animal welfare than an informed lifestyle choice. In a well-written, methodical argument based on high quality research evidence rather than pseudo-science, the author makes the case that excessive dietary animal protein is a significant risk factor for many of the most common Western ailments, ranging from heart disease to breast cancer and autoimmune disorders. The title refers to a large population study comparing disease rates and dietary habits throughout China, which is then put in perspective with Western trends and laboratory research. Although dairy protein doesn't come out of all this looking very good, Dr. Campbell avoids overstating his case by counseling a \\"whole-food, plant-based diet\\" based on his population studies, rather than the manipulation of specific nutrients in isolation. He presents evidence that adopting such a diet can prevent or reverse at least some of the diseases considered. <br />After his eye-opening account of how meat and dairy ended up being included in the \\"healthy food guides\\" ingrained in so many of us, I was struck by the author's comment that \\"science is not always the honest search for truth that so many believe it to be. It far too often involves money, power, ego and protection of personal interests above the common good.\\" After a long and distinguished research career, Dr. Campbell may have some suspicion of the beef and dairy lobbies, but his arguments have a candid rather than paranoid ring to them. I believe his motivation to write this book for a wide audience is simple and noble: to share what he has learned for the common good. Even if some of his concerns turn out to be exaggerated, I appreciated his thought-provoking effort. <br />
B0000AUHPK|5.0|This was just what we needed.  My grandson was studying the book at school and the movie brought it all together for him.  It made it more timely and real.
B00003CX95|5.0|I was very impressed with this movie.  Mel Gibson plays an incredible role in a movie symbolic of the importance of freedom and the desire to have a country of one's own.  Many academics have criticized the movie for not accurately depicting the historical events that have occurred.  I say, that's largely irrelevant as the thing that the viewer will notice most of all from this movie is not a hodge podge of historical events, but rather a larger, abstract goal of freedom and the desire to have autonomous lines of a country that reflect a nation.  America also did not want to be ruled by England, and we went to war to accomplish that.  This movie explains that in great detail:  it is an amazing story.
B00029QWII|5.0|This is probably the most accurate portrayal of the Crucifixion and the events leading up to it that has come out of Hollywood!  While no one can know for sure and certainly there are some Hollywood enhancements and additions, much of the movie closely follows the Biblical account (including using the languages of the day).  It is bloody and cruel because that's how Jesus was treated.  I don't see how anyone can watch this movie and not be moved!
B000HBK3MM|2.0|While I will probably get slammed for not falling under Corinne Bailey Rae's spell, it's not for lack of trying. This woman is revered in her native England and has received universally good reviews around the world, so it seemed like a no brainer for me to buy this release.<br /><br />I listened to the whole release several times and I could not believe that I was entirely indifferent to it and that is not a good thing. Sure \\"Like A Star\\" and maybe \\"Put Your Records On\\" are nice enough, but for the most most part I felt like I say listening to background music that lacked intimacy, intensity, and emotional connection. Corinne has been compared singers like Macy Grey, Norah Jones, Sade and even the one and only Billie Holliday, but I see none of it.<br /><br />Some may think that my review may reflect a total lack of appreciation for the more quiet, subtle sound that is the anti-Britney and the like, but it simply is not true. I love singers like Kate Bush and other left of center acts, but Corinne's voice seems too light for me and the arrangements are plain flat.<br /><br />This is not to say that the lady is not without talent as the two songs that I mentioned above say differently, but this record simply does not hold a candle to the work of say Rickie Lee Jones, who to this day does not get the credit she deserves.<br /><br />If you are looking for a safe record that will not offend, you could do much worse, but if you've listened to all the hype, you may want to lower your expectations. I don't hate this release, it just does not resonate with me.
B000FL7CAK|4.0|info first, the announced subtitles are not on the discs...again, like on NUMBERS SERIES 2. <br />no question, seeing veronica mars can you lead to an addiction of this series... <br />all joking aside, this tv-show is one the few which is interesting for all age groups. the humor is fresh, a litte bit provoking and straight. <br />the story is intelligent (you don't know until the end, who let the bus crash) and the actors are stunning especially Kristen Bell was born to play that part.  <br />The only negative aspect beside the missing (and announced) subtitles (producers, please, don't do that again, o.k.?) is the long time to get season 3. <br />But, fortunately, there are some other good tv-shows to fill the waiting time before verconia mars is investigating again.

0425180638|4.0|It seems to me that everything possible has been said about this book. I do want to add something which is this: It took me quite some persistance to get through the beginning (e.i. the first 1/3 part) of the book but I was determined, and just knew it had to get better SOMEWHERE. It did. The middle part truly was one of the best suspence ever. But I got a strong feeling that the whole story would go out like a night candle and lo and behold, it did.<br /><br />And that was the biggest disappointment EVER. There, I've said it.
B00028HBKM|5.0|This is probably the most accurate portrayal of the Crucifixion and the events leading up to it that has come out of Hollywood!  While no one can know for sure and certainly there are some Hollywood enhancements and additions, much of the movie closely follows the Biblical account (including using the languages of the day).  It is bloody and cruel because that's how Jesus was treated.  I don't see how anyone can watch this movie and not be moved!
0380733358|4.0|Eye of the Needle is the first book Follett wrote that became succussful and established him as a great writer, especially of historical, WWII novels.  Now, after several years and several novels, Eye of the Needle holds up well.  It tells the story of the Allies' deception at D-Day.  The Allies convinced Germany the attack would be at Calais, not at Normandy.  How did they do this?  Follett writes about it in this novel.  Germany's success in spying on the Allies has been mostly a failure, but one spy has mananged to avoid authorities and also found out an incredible truth:  The plan to attack at Calais is one big fabrication.  How will he get the info to Germany.  The Germans won't trust a radio transmission because too many agents have been turned by the British.  This spy, the Needle, has to get photographs to Germany.<br /><br />The Needle is the main character, and we follow him as he travels across the country always one step ahead of the authorities.  The story also follows the British men in MI5 trying to track the Needle.  These men are civillians pressed into duty for their country and do an admirable job.  Another part of the story is that of David and Lucy Rose.  On their wedding night and the day before David is supposed to report for duty, he is involved in a car wreck that takes both of his legs.  He and Lucy move to Storm Island and become recluses from society.  David also withdrawals from Lucy which leaves her desparate for human interaction.  Lucy is a strong character, but she doesn't become a part of the story until the later.<br /><br />This Follett novel is very good and in it you see what made him so successful.  Still, it is not one of his bests, but definitely a must read.
0385720920|4.0|This book was written by Chuck Palahniuk and it is a story about a troubled man named Victor Mancini.  This novel is full of dark witty humor that exemplifies the reluctance to accepting love.  Victor goes to restaurants and pretends to choke on food, attends weekly sex addiction meetings and has an ailing mother in need of a stomach pump.  He is a man but with a deep past, a past that he thinks he has settled.  As a child Victor moved from many different foster homes, he always ran away back to his mother, who was in and out of jail for her actions that showed she was not of mental health.  The beginning of the novel starts off in the middle of the night, at the edge of a forest near the base of a rock cliff.  Victor is standing in the freezing winter snow, completely naked except for jeans; he is standing in front of a bus facing its high beams and he is waiting for his mother to finish spray painting his shadow against the rock cliff.  She tells him to stand up straight or he will ruin her work of art, she says sculpture and pictures were started from a shadow and that one day Victor will understand.  She returns to jail soon after this and Victor is left with pneumonia and a feeling of disgust at his malleable former childhood self.  Victor refers to himself as a stupid little boy because he was so eager to have love, which he thought was what his mother was doing but in reality she was mentally unstable.  Victor endured moments like these and countless others.   <br /> After this particular moment, his life is built around his rejection of love, he views himself as unlovable.  He has sex randomly, often masturbating in public, with numerous people and all the while he goes to restaurants across town and pretends to choke on food.  He describes his first time choking, not purposely and notices that \\"you [have] to risk your life to get love\\" (3).  Chuck Palahniuk shows Victor as someone who is choking on food for money to pay off his debts he owes on account of his ailing mother who is on her death bed.  However, the underlining message is that Victor fails to notice that his life is built around love; he is loving and has a good heart but disregards this aspect of himself through lying and swindling money out of people.  Palahniuk clouds Victor, justifying his actions of choking by stating that everyone wants to be a hero, leaving Victor to play the victim, the helpless boy that cannot survive well enough on his own.  Palahniuk creates two worlds, one in which Victor is just a sex addict who cheats people out of their money and pride however there is a less obvious and more subtle alternate reality that shows Victor as someone plagued by his past, someone struggling to love himself and allow others to love him. <br /> Victor attends sex addiction meetings three times a week however he usually doesn't make it to the inside of the meeting room because he is having sex in the janitors closet with another group member.  Each addict most complete a twelve step program, Victor is stuck on his fourth step.  In order to complete this step Victor must take inventory of his life, write down every moment of addiction he has, not just sex but moments that have stuck with him.  Throughout the whole novel Victor delays on completing this step, here Palahniuk sheds light into Victor's hurtful past.  Victor sees the reasoning behind the fourth step and even states that \\"those who forget [their] past are condemned to repeat it\\" (8).  However his reluctance to complete the step is an issue Palahniuk creates in order to cloud the softer side of Victor; his softer side isn't as obvious as Victor's sexual drive or his willingness to steal from helpful strangers.  Victor lives a life that demands too much of him, forcing him to foolish means.  Palahniuk does an excellent job of creating Victor as the enemy, while reading Choke I noticed myself feeling angry at the stupidity of Victor's actions however my contradicting feelings towards Victor exemplifies Palahniuk's ability to appeal to all levels of his readers emotions.   <br />Chuck Palahniuk allows for a broad range of feelings and does an excellent job of creating two worlds within the character Victor.  These two worlds can go unnoticed to the untrained eye but there is no denying Palahniuk's skill for deeper meaning while assessing his ability to craft witty, dark humored sentences.  Choke and more importantly the character Victor is filled with the usage of double entendre, everything is more than the surface and Palahniuk gives subtle hints to the two lives of Victor Mancini; the person Victor is fighting and the person he would be if he stopped fighting.  Throughout the novel there is only a faint recognition of this however the end of the novel is where things come to surface.  At the end I found myself with one word at the tip of my astonished lips and that was `wow'.  <br />         <br />  <br />       <br />
B000E41MS6|4.0|There are plenty of reviews here.  I want to just make some comments which hopefully will be helpful.  I am a Doctor Who fan of old, I have nearly all the episodes (that are avaiable) from the first 6 Doctors.  So here are some comparisons from the old series. <br /> <br />1.  I don't like the new Tardis.  It's too dark, it's not what the old show had. <br /> <br />2.  This is high-tech Doctor Who.  This isn't your old fake monsters and cheesy sets.  BBC puts some money into this series. <br /> <br />3.  The \\"continuity\\" from earlier Doctors is not good.  Yes, there are episodes on the Nestenes and Daleks, but the \\"link\\" with the older Doctors needs to be improved. <br /> <br />4.  Almost every episode in this series takes place on earth.  Please.  Let's go somewhere else, ok? <br /> <br />5.  Christopher Eccleston made a good Doctor.  I was pleased with the job he did.  I hated to see him go.  Billie Piper is fine as an assistant, nothing special. <br /> <br />6.  This is a new age Doctor, not just a children's show any more.  A tad bit of romance and something for everyone, including queers, since in the last episode there was a man-man kiss.  Quite revolting, actually, but it didn't ruin the whole series. <br /> <br />7.  Bottom line, if you're a Doctor Who fan from way back and haven't gottent this one yet, go ahead and get it.  It needs some improvement, but it's worth the money

B000H0MKGK|5.0|I will buy any of John Mayer's albums because it is rare to find an album where you actually enjoy each and every song.  John keeps changing his sound and getting better.  This album is more \\"bluesy\\" than his previous releases and is great!  I especially love \\"Slow Dancing in a Burning Room\\" and \\"Heart of Life.\\" A definite must have for anyone who appreciates REAL talent.
B000002HPV|5.0|Any music fan should have this album in their collection, if not worship it. I think my favorite album ever.
B000EQ47GS|4.0|Not exactly communists, but whatever... <br /> <br />Great 70's music with cliche tedious liner notes. What else can be said about the music. It's longevity speaks for itself. <br /> <br />The liner notes go down the old worn path of stupid music execs just not \\"getting it\\" and Poor Tom almost giving up (damn The Man!). But all it took was adding a great drummer and Brad Delp's angelic vocals and, Voila! Stardom! <br /> <br />Well, take away Robert Plant and John Bonham and what to you have? Outrider. Great guitar work on a realitively unlistenable album. Gotta give Tom credit for his multi-instrumentalism, but did we really want just what he cobbled together in his basement in 1975, or the professional output of 1976, with Sid, Brad, and The Man? <br /> <br />
B000000OF6|2.0|When you plan to make a \\"Greatest Hits\\" compilation for such a quintessential rock band as Queen, you can do it right if you include ONLY original, FULL-LENGTH versions!  This 2-CD is filled with \\"Singles\\"!!! Instead of it, save some extra money and get the whole Queen album collection... Being the case of this unparalleled Rock band, it is worth the price!
B00006CXSS|5.0|I wasn't even into WWII until I saw this. I am much more of an earlier American History buff (American Revolution, Civil War, etc.).  Band of Brothers is so beautifully done and the acting so good.  We watch these over and over again at our house.  What an amazing generation!  Too bad we cannot be more like these heroes today...Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks do an amazing job of keeping this generation's legacy alive.
B00005JPB6|5.0|I am the son of a veteran of Iwo Jima. Occasionally, my father would talk about his experiences there, but not with any detail. And every time he spoke about it, he quickly changed the subject. Today, he is in his 80s and is brought to tears every time he sees what is going on in Iraq, let alone when he thinks about the hell of Iwo Jima. <br /> <br />Even though I, myself, am a veteran of the Vietnam era, I was not prepared for what I witnessed in this remarkable film. It is impossible to walk away from it and not understand that these Marines were very special people - people who did not understand how important they were to the war effort and the fight for freedom. <br /> <br />My father will never see this film or read the book because he has always refused to watch WWII movies or to read books on the subject. But as for me, after seeing that film, I sure do understand my father a lot better than I ever thought possible. Experiencing this film was a special moment for me and I am so glad I was privileged to see such an amazing work of historical art. I personally want to thank all those who made this film and for exposing the truth in such a powerful and amazing way.
B000055XMF|5.0|As a huge Who fan I loved this flick.  It brought the lyrics of the album to life.  Pretty well acted too.  Phil Daniels as \\"Jimmy\\" was great.  You do need to pay close attention to the dialog as the british cockney accents are very strong.  Gives you a true feel for life in early '60s England.  I have an old VHS that I copied back in 1980 and I'm thrilled to be buying a DVD edition in 5.1 quality sound to rock out to the Who's best album (in my opinion) all over again!  Sad to think there's just Pete and Roger left of the Who now but their music lives on forever!!  If you get the chance, check out this movie!
0307237699|5.0|The first thing Obama accomplishes in _Audacity_ is to stake out his position on the major issues of the day.  For the most part his is a consistent liberal stand- he's for abortion, against the death penalty, against the Bush tax cuts, against the war, he voted against CAFTA, and he's for expanded government health care, a higher minimum wage, and against privatizing social security.<br /><br />All these are classic liberal positions, but as you read his book you will notice that he doesn't advance simplistic liberal arguments for his positions.  He understands how free markets work.  He's for affirmative action, but he argues that racism is not the primary cause of back inequality.  He's the last one you would hear blaming racism for the Hurricane Katrina mishap.  He understands that poverty in Africa is caused by corruption; liberals argue the reverse.  He supports many of the policies of the teachers' unions, but understands that they are part of the problem.  Although he consistently comes down on the side of liberal policies, his reasoning is moderate.  He has yet to find a hot issue that would separate him from the liberal crowd (merit pay is one, but it's not hot) as Clinton did with the death penalty and welfare reform.<br /><br />The author to whom he is most indebted is William Julius Wilson.  Like Wilson, he sees the both racism and cultural failure as a major cause of racial inequality and his policy recommendations (for universal rather than targeted social policies) come very close to what Wilson called the \\"hidden agenda\\" in the _Truly Disadvantaged_.  And his politics and political strategy draws much from Wilson's _The Bridge over the Racial Divide_ with its somewhat naïve hopes for transcending partisanship.<br /><br />What clearly separates him from many of the other candidates is that he understands the arguments on the other side of these issues. He describes the arguments for many Bush administration policies far better than even Bush does.  He voted against CAFTA but explains why it was not an easy choice. More than most, he understands that almost every policy decision has its plusses and minuses.  Contrast this with our president and many other politicians, liberal and conservative, who see almost every decision as a choice between right and wrong.<br /><br />In the end, presidents face choices that are far more complex than the simplistic issues that come up in campaigns; if you understand how a candidate thinks (or, in the case of one successful candidate, refuses to think) and deals with those who disagree with him, you will have a much better idea of what kind of president he is going to be.<br /><br />And Obama writes better than Wilson does, and better than he did his first book (which dragged on an unnecessary 40 pages).<br /><br />My grandmother used to say, \\"politicians are like nails -- the go in straight and come out crooked\\".  I hope Barak is the exception.<br /><br />Gary Klass<br />gmklass@ilstu.edue voted against CAFTA but explains why it was not an easy choice.

B00004RFFS|4.0|Its so rare in this day and age to get a great book made into a very good film with great actors. Anne Rice was understandably happy with the performance of Tom Cruise as Lestat as he really eats up the screen when he's in any scene. Brad Pitt has his work cut out for him making a whiny character like Louis into a likeable sympathetic hero, but just about pulls it off. Kirsten Dunst is wonderful as their daughter, but the star of the show is probably (and surprisingly) Antonio Banderas who is superbly convincing in his part, hinting that he could have been a far more respected actor than he gets credit for these days. Admirable support is provided by Stephen Rea and a slightly underused Christian Slater in what is a wonderfully moody and dark tale. Excellently directed and only occasionally a little slow, Interview is a darn sight better than it has any right to be. An intelligent horror film, not for those who like no brainer vampire flicks of which there are many.
B00005Y1TL|4.0|Many years ago, when I first heard this CD, I thought that it was rather empty, bleak, and just dull cold electronic music.  There wasn't much like it around at the time, so when I played this CD a few times, I got tired of it rather quickly.  I even ended up giving it a way to a friend.<br /><br />Then, a few years later, I saw a movie called \\"Pi\\".  It was a low budget black and white film based on the subject of intelligence and insanity, and the soundtrack that supported this film had a series of artists that I have never heard of before.  Watching the film, I just loved all that strange electronic music playing in the background, so I knew I just had to find the CD soundtrack of the film \\"Pi\\".<br /><br />On the soundtrack, I saw that Aphex Twin had a track on it.  I don't remember this track in the film \\"Bucephalus Bouncing Ball\\", but I sure loved this bizarre electronic collage of dissonant noise.  Plus, this CD soundtrack introduced me to alot of new artists, all making a new sound in electronic music that I have never heard before.  This new music is called IDM, which means \\"intelligent dance music\\".  But, I think it should be called ADM meaning \\"addictive music\\", because that's what this new music has become to me.  I have a hard time listening to regular music anymore.  This IDM is very motivational music to listen to.  This music gives me all sorts of nervous energy which has turned me into a healthier, more physically toned, workaholic.  When I'm in an IDM music euphoria, I can't sit still.  After buying the soundtrack of \\"Pi\\", I ended up buying this Aphex Twin CD once again and listened to it with a more optimistic, more educated awareness, of what is being played here.<br /><br />But, you know, you can't just allow yourself to be satisfied with this one CD.  You have to let yourself explore more music like Aphex Twin.  And I'm not too crazy about all of Aphex Twin's CD's (Selected Ambient Works: Volume Two is actually a very boring double CD to have to listen to, and it's nothing like this Volume One).  However, if you don't have a lot of music like this, than it can seem to become too repetitious and become tiresome rather quickly if you let yourself play this CD too much.  Even I don't care to sit through the entire playback of just the one CD.  But, I have determined that this music from Aphex Twin should be played within a mix of other Ambient Dub and other various glitch and IDM related electronica.  To just play these 13 songs over and over, end to end, can get dull quickly.  But if you listen to these songs mixed in with about another hundred IDM instrumentals than you will truly appreciate Aphex Twin's participation in the overall bigger picture of today's electronic instrumentals. Today's IDM.<br /><br />I have this Aphex Twin CD shuffling amongst others in my 200 CD carrousel.  These tracks by Aphex Twin are being mixed up with tracks by Autechre, Gescom, Squarepusher, Pete Namlook, Biosphere, The Orb, The Higher Intelligence Agency, Phutureprimitive, Sounds From the Ground, Electric Skychurch, Plaid, Boards of Canada, and various other similar artists of which Aphex Twin belongs with.<br /><br />I also have these songs and other IDM and Ambient Dub tracks burned onto ATRAC CDR's that is made through the SonicStage program made available only by Sony.  (Check out some of Sony's ATRAC CD players and find out why burning hours of your favorite tunes onto a single CDR is better than just loading an ipod with mp3s)  Burning hard copies is definitely better than just floating your music in a temporary storage unit like an ipod.

037571457X|5.0|I loved this book for many of the same reasons other reviewers did. As others mention, there's a lot in this book that's unique:  the freshness and the perfect fit of the comic book style to the content, the heroine's pluck and total believability, and the author's success in portraying both the \\"good and the bad\\" of growing up in post-revolution Iran with amazing lack of preachiness, or heavy-handedness (she lets the story speak, and lets us judge accordingly). True such an accomplishment can be viewed in numerous other first hand accounts of foreign cultures. But Satrapi truly stands out as a genius in this genre. When I am taken on a voyage along with a girl (or boy)into the heart of a \\"different\\" culture by an author as skilled as Satrapi, a series of transformations take place in me, that lead to my acute awareness of that well-kept secret in this world of ours that I too always seem to forget--that what is common among humans (which includes most of what is in our hearts) completely transcends time and place. I see yet again how ephemeral this insight is, and how easy it is to fall prey to the thousand-fold repeated LIE: \\"we are different from others, and we must believe the self-appointed authorities on HOW we are different\\".  This book once again shows me the light--and this time, with the help of Satrapi's story, so lightly yet so compellingly delivered, I have more faith that this truth will stay with me.  And I hope that its magic will do the same for all its readers.
B000AL730O|5.0|A Fine Line is a fine hit song, but the rest of this album deserves multiple listens. Jenny Wren and Too Much Rain are stunning songs. English Tea is a riot. McCartney's optimism regarding love is here but with deeper, more mature tones--not silly, it isn't silly at all.
B0000028VT|4.0|The album was first rate..except the bonus track (on the orginal CD)..\\"Everything Fades Away\\" was missing.... This bonus track was a highlight was ordering the product online...else the CD quality,re- mastering..the packaging etc are all superb.. <br />
B0000DZ3HM|5.0|As has been noted by nearly every reviewer of the recently reissued DVD version of \\"One Night With Blue Note\\", the changes to the original film (made in 1985 and released on VHS and laserdisc) are controversial and questionable. No one can say the enhanced image and sound quality aren't improvements, and the additional music is certainly welcome, but this was a movie made by a filmmaker with a very clear intent - to show the intimate interplay between jazz musicians. This was accomplished through extended close-ups and very observant musical intercutting. Director John Jopson and Cinematographer Ernest Dickerson did a masterful job in capturing the personalities of the musicians and it seems a shame to randomly throw in audience shots from some other event - and in video format at that. (I wonder what those people think watching this DVD, seeing themselves enjoying a show they never attended.)<br /><br />To film more than forty of the greatest jazz musicians in the world for over 3 hours is a daunting task. This movie was shot on film, not video, so there had to be film magazine changes every ten minutes on each of the multiple cameras. To do this without missing important moments is incredibly difficult and requires planning, a good ear, and spontaneity. On the original version there was a great interplay during one set where we see Freddie Hubbard's amazed reaction to Herbie Hancock's piano solo. This shot really said something - how these musicians can blow each other away. Throughout the film the Director doesn't hesitate to cut away to what the other musicians are doing, even during a solo. To be fair much of this artful editing is still intact, but it's a disservice to the filmmaker and the viewer to go back in and change the intent.<br /><br />Most importantly, thanks to Bruce Lundvall and Michael Cuscuna the greatest night in jazz history has been well documented, and at least we know the original footage is still in the Blue Note vaults in case some futureaficionado wants to restore the film to its original form for the next generation. Or how about releasing a Director's Cut? I'll bet everyone who owns the DVD would buy yet another version: We know from the CDs and the tracks that were removed from the original version (ie the Charles Lloyd and Stanley Jordan tunes) that there must be a lot of footage yet to be released.<br /><br />Nevertheless the DVD version is still an incredible film and well worth the investment. If you're a jazz lover buy the DVD and look for the vhs or laserdisc on eBay. \\"One Night With Blue Note\\" is simply the best jazz movie ever made.
B000I5Y8ZU|4.0|I'm writing this review for all the ancient relics (i.e. those old enough to drink) who may have read about this new My Chemical Romance album but aren't sure if they should care about it.  Begging your indulgence, I'll also be making numerous references to a lot of past albums.  This is mainly because MCR themselves seem to be self-consciously referencing these albums to fashion \\"The Black Parade.\\"  While I suppose that may signal some of you to assume that no, you really shouldn't care, I'll tell you that you should, with a definite, resounding and emphatic \\"maybe.\\"<br /><br />First off, I'll get those pesky references out of the way.  One of us old folks, a geezer named Billy Corgan, is probably gnashing his teeth at the very thought of \\"The Black Parade,\\" since it clearly and obviously pays a huge debt to his old band the Smashing Pumpkins and their massive and self-consciously important concept album \\"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness\\" (still one of the most ridiculous titles for an album, even after all these years).  Of course, massive and self-consciously important concept albums have a long and venerable history in rock, and \\"The Black Parade\\" manages to remind us of almost every single one of them.  Aside from \\"Mellon Collie,\\" one can easily find bits, pieces and even whole undigested chunks from \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" (of course), Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\" (the story of the life of an alienated rocker), Nine Inch Nails' \\"The Downward Spiral\\" (dark lyrics, frequently about suicide and disease) and even Marilyn Manson's \\"Antichrist Superstar\\" (the transformation of a nobody into Somebody Important).  There are also plenty of musical nods to Queen (\\"A Night at the Opera\\") and yes, even Green Day's more recent \\"American Idiot.\\"  I myself was also reminded a bit of Husker Du's indie-punk landmark \\"Zen Arcade\\" (has MCR even heard of that one?).  I could go on, and you can probably add to the list, but us old folks need a breather sometimes, you know?<br /><br />Anyway, what does \\"The Black Parade\\" add to the sub-genre?  In theory, not a whole lot, but in practice, the band's tuneful punk (I refuse to say the word \\"emo\\"--damn!) melds itself pretty well with multi part anthems like \\"Welcome To The Black Parade\\" and \\"Famous Last Words.\\"  While the lyrical content gushes with teen angst and overblown despair (\\"Have you heard the news that you're dead?/No one ever had much nice to say/I think they never liked you anyway\\"), it's played with so much energy that when they get to the inevitable uplift (I am not afraid to keep on living/I am not afraid to walk this world alone\\") it seems almost unnecessary.  I suppose one can complain about their lack of musical diversity--they stick mostly to the old-fashioned guitar/bass/drums lineup, albeit every bit as overproduced as any of the albums mentioned before.  Compare, if you will, with the more lo-fi, but way more musically adventurous \\"In the Aeroplane Over the Sea\\" by Neutral Milk Hotel (zanzithophone, anyone? wandering genie?).  On a couple of tracks, MCR do add a certain Weimar Cabaret feel.  Okay, so have the Dresden Dolls and even Marilyn Manson (\\"The Golden Age of Grotesque\\"), but do those guys have a cameo from Liza Minelli?  She appears for a few brief but insane moments on \\"Mama,\\" even if it goes by so fast you hardly notice it.  Really, the whole album breezes by so fast you hardly notice it, much less stop to ponder all those other albums or what this album has to say, all in all.  I'll leave that one open for interpretation, but I'm sure the masses of immature hormonal youth that idolize the band will fill in that just nicely.  Actually, I kind of feel the need to apologize for liking the album, since the kind of ambition it requires to make such a grand statement inevitably leads to a total sacrifice of street cred.  Still, my fellow hoary crypt-keepers, if you can tear yourselves away from your nostalgia to the bygone days B.D. (before Dubya) for less than an hour, you mayeven want to join in this parade.may even want to join in this parade.
0393317552|4.0|This book is a must read for all social science academics and the like.  J. Diamond presents a clear argument for why certain societies are more advantaged than others.  Although he is believable, his argument is flawed which makes for a great paper topic.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|If there are moments that make you think of Queen's \\"Night at the Opera\\" and David Bowie's \\"Ziggy Stardust\\" just remember those albums are thirty years old and still around....... <br />MCR has created nothing short of an emo masterpiece - expect this album to be referenced for years
B00000DQWT|5.0|This is an excellent soundtrack. PMG show another side of their musical journey with a more atmoshperic and emotionnal journey. If only every soundtrack were this good. One big surprise that I encountered while listenign to this album is the lack of solos, but this lack works really well, the atmosphere is what sings to you on this album unlike previous Metheny albums.  <br />Reccomended to fans of atmospheric and laid-back music. If you're debating on this purchase, buy it right away, you will not regret.
B000H7JD4K|4.0|Much better than last 2 since reforming with Dickinson. A few songs drag out a little long, but i like the straight forward, clean production. No surprises (no synths, effects), which is a good thing. They seem to have gotten their focus back on this release. Maybe they can trim it down a little more, but i am happy. The DVD is pretty cool as well. Good value.
B00000DGXN|5.0|What a lineup of musicians. This album grabs you solo after solo and doesn't let up till the end. Reccomended to fans of fun, improv-friendly jazz.
0375831002|5.0|Perfect words for how I felt when I finished this masterpiece.  Just read it.
6305949980|5.0|Wow, THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CRISTMAS has to be one of the greatest animated films ever made. In it, Tim Burton creates a fantastic and brilliantly imagined world full of magic and wonder. The movie captures the viewer's imagination from the beginning and never lets go. Each frame is filled with enchanting imagery, from pumpkin patches to glistening snow fields. The musical numbers are superb, ranging from jazzy show tunes (Oogie Boogie's Song) to hauntingly beautiful ballads (Jack's Lament.) These songs have wonderful melodies, superb vocals and intelligent lyrics that add emotional depth to the film and advance its plot. The amount of detail in this movie is just amazing and rewards repeated viewings. The characters are fascinating and their voices, motions and expressions are all flawlessly done. Danny Elfman really deserves a lot of credit for putting so much emotion into the singing voice of Jack and writing such a great score. The movie goes from darkly funny to moving and everything in between. A wonderful film that delights the senses and imagination.   DON'T MISS IT!
1400032717|1.0|Started out interesting and kept my attention but then got really long and tedious. About mid-way the book lost my interest and got really, really boring!
B000FIMG68|5.0|I came to \\"Lost\\" a bit differently than some people in that I watched the entire first season on DVD before I ever saw an episode on television. I saw the last few episodes of season two on television and then got all caught up when the second season came out on DVD. This is actually a great way to watch \\"Lost\\" as you don't have the frustraton of waiting a week between episodes.<br /><br />I haven't decided if I think season two is stronger or weaker than season one. I just look at it as part of a continuing journey. I am not as concerned with the island mysteries as I am with the characters. To me, it is all about how these people react and cope with whatever is before them. The acting and writing remain fantastic. And I love the way the show does the unexpected, such as focusing on Desmond, a character not seen since the first episodes of the season and probably forgotten about by most people, for the season finale. And it was a great finale.<br /><br />I hope the show maintains its high level in season 3, and as long as the writers stay true to the characters, I'll be watching.
