B003U4UNPK|5.0|Best TV series ever. Great story. Great actors. Hawaii is beautiful. Engrossing and well connected story. Stays with you long after story is told. A very good, very long story. Well developed characters and themes.

B008ROG6E0|4.0|You can definitely tell that this movie was made in the 1970s, but it gives an interesting insight into society at the time.<br /><br />Additionally, the basic story was good enough to make it worth it.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|This has been a very long journey, I am glad that it has come to an end now.  There wear some loose ends, bit I think this is the ending that Robert would have written.  Some surprises, disappoints and a lot of fun.

B009K0OL06|5.0|Deep revenge is what we all want. Our upbringing prevents us from fulfilling this sweet desire. Karma has a way of soothing those with patience to wait for it to even the score for them. And what would revenge be without a smattering of love/deceit mixed in just for good measure?
B00BESNKB8|2.0|This was an American movie with Chinese props. The Man with the Iron Fists needed more story line and less action.

B008JFUO4U|4.0|I might as well admit I went to see this because I wanted to see what it felt like to purchase a ticket to oblivion.  The story, as far as I can tell, is one where the hero is either awake, dreaming, dreaming he's awake or dreaming he's dreaming.  Not exactly Total Recall, but if you think they ran Blade Runner through the office copier for Total Recall, Oblivion borrows from everything from Planet of the Apes to Aeon Flux.  One thing these mega movies teach us is that money does not buy originality.<br /><br />In the end, I think it's the effects and visual design that make Oblivion entertaining.  You know there's trouble when Morgan Freeman has to fill you in on what's up with the story around the 90 minute mark.  Anyhow, my take on the story.  There has been a war.  The earth was victorious but the planet was left uninhabitable except for a little spread that Tom owns, but that comes later.  Since nobody can live on earth, security is handled by a crew of just 2 people; Tom and a gal who looks like Kate Winslet on a crash diet.  They live in a 50's modern glass house on top of a microwave antenna.  The house has a pool that's like a Corningware baking dish, but larger.<br /><br />One day, Tom falls through the ceiling of the reading room in the New York Public Library.  He looks for books by L. Ron Hubbard, but the place is a mess and all he can find is a book about dying with honor and purpose.  Then, his wife shows up, which creates a little friction at home, so Tom starts staying out late in his spaceship even though things on earth are dangerous after dark.<br /><br />In the end, Tom discovers the whole setup is a hoax, run by the folks in the big space station overhead.  You can guess the rest but I won't tell you, except to say he goes up to the big space HQ and it's filled with humans who are in cold storage.  In one of Oblivion's few innovations, these folks are stored sitting down which, I'm sorry to say made it look like each was on the toilet.  End of world but with clean restrooms, I guess.  BTW, I forgot to mention Tom also discovers that he is somebody else, somebody else is him and they fight over it.<br /><br />Whatever Oblivion was about, I liked it for the effects and soundtrack.  So long as you don't get hung up trying to figure out the story, I recommend it.world but with clean restrooms, I guess.

1455519006|4.0|This is my first David Baldacci read, but won't be my last.  The &#34;Innocent&#34; is a page turner and fast paced escapism.  Baldacci's pacing reminds me of Dan Brown novels.  At least with this book.  Both Brown's books and the Innocent feature tight time frames measured in hours that encompass only a couple of days of non-stop action.  While Baldacci doesn't decorate his book with historical back stories and vignettes, he does create imaginative set-ups that gives the reader a clear insight into the mind and personality of his protagonist.<br /><br />Will Robie is a US agent who operates in the black world where foreign problems have to be settled through the muzzle of a gun.  He is very good at killing around the world and never sees his actions as anything other than a job which he is very good at.  Until an assignment takes him to an apartment in Washington DC where his target turns out to be an American citizen - with young children in her bedroom as Robie is forced to contemplate what the limit is of what he will do in service of his agency. That contemplation makes him a target and sucks him into an intricate cat-and-mouse game of survival and the prevention of mayhem that unfolds around him.<br /><br />He has not one, but two sidekicks - both female, but one is a fourteen year old who has witnessed her parents being murdered over what looks to be a drug deal gone bad and  whose life Robbie saves while himself fleeing his predicament.  The teenager is an interesting pairing and very good character for the steely-killer to play off as they work to solve both of their issues.<br /><br />This book is very good weekend escapism.  It is well written, intricate and believable.  All the thing an action novel should be.

1426209584|5.0|As a retired wildlife biologist and dedicated birder, this book is an incredibly beautiful addition to my avian library.  It's unlikely I'll ever get to see birds-of-paradise in the wilds of New Guinea, but the splendor of the photographs in this book are certainly some considerable compensation. I disagree with some previous comments indicating over-saturation of color in the photos.  Too often I've seen photos of birds in other books that don't really compare to the intensity of color one often sees when observing birds in the wild.  However, I do have a little other criticism of this publication.  One is the letterbox format, which makes it difficult to attempt holding and reading--it works best to just lay it flat on a table and savor the photos.  The lead-in text to several sections is printed in a light grey font on white background, which can be a bit difficult to read easily without perfect lighting.  This is a problem shared by many book and magazine designers these days, who seem to believe an off-color text is artistic.  That may be so, but it makes some things difficult to read, and I wish publishers would all return to text that contrasts highly with the background.  Finally, the authors make frequent page number references throughout the text, but only some pages are numbered.  There are often many consecutive unnumbered pages, thus making a search for the referenced page a little frustrating.  But in the final tally this book still deserves 5 stars as one of the most captivating books on avian life I've ever seen.  It's worth a place of honor on any coffee table or in any library.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Brain candy. I enjoy the higher levels as a little more of a challenge but the first levels are relaxing and hard to put down.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|One of my very favorite series on TV.  Love that time period.  I loved the 1971 Upstairs Downstairs series, and this is very similar to it.  Another similar series is Backstairs at the White House.  All truly enjoyable series.
B009OYTAL8|4.0|The story is solid and representation of comic character in real world is pretty cool as well. Reminds me of what Nolan did for Batman. Keeps you involved and wanting for more. It has a little drama similar to tv soap sometimes but for the most part its action packed. Very satisfying season finale.
B008E9R50C|5.0|Once again Lisa Gardner has not disappointed me ! Her plots are always full of the unexpected with interesting endings and twists. In this one the accent is on Bobby Dodge with D.D.Warren taking backstage, but it is no less exciting ! Highly recommend it.
B00C4XYEBW|5.0|I've seen a preview of this film, and it's very reminiscent of the Epitaph Concert I went to back in October of 2011. While the band's past their prime, there's no doubt they still have plenty of talent left to spare. Maybe I'm biased because this was my first concert experience, but the Epitaph DVD is a good send-off for the band, and has the best version of \\"Victim of Changes\\" I've ever heard.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I will not summarize the story as have many reviewers.<br /><br />I will say that Emma Chase has an exceptional story that actually makes you laugh so loudly your dog cowers under the sofa and your children hide because you are embarrassing them (just ask my family).<br /><br />This is an engaging story; I'm not sure I've read an entire book from the heroes point of view. Ms. Chase did an excellent job letting us live this adventure through  Drew's voice.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and read this book.  You will not regret it; you will probably try to remember when you liked hating someone so much one minute and loved him so thoroughly the next.
B00BTJMS1A|4.0|Got this as the FAotD.<br /><br />This is a \\"Match 3\\" game, where the Match 3 mechanic is used for combat and actions in a classic dungeon crawl.  If that sounds complicated, it's not.<br /><br />PRO:  Not frustrating.  There's a little bit of a learning curve, but not too much.  The gameplay is fun and it has that \\"one more turn\\" factor going for it.  I personally dig the retro graphics and audio, though I wish the actual matching section featured improved graphics for ease-of-use.  The upgrades are good and seem well-balanced... you can use different strategies for getting upgrades to get a different game experience.  It's fun.  You'll put more than just 1 or 2 hours into this to beat it.<br /><br />CON:  Sometimes the game will not respond to my touch, so when I go to swipe a line it won't move.  That's a pretty annoying problem/bug and that alone is probably the one star off I gave it.  It needs to respond better.  Also there's not necessarily good documentation on what different upgrades do or how to get them.<br /><br />SUMMARY:  If you hate Match 3 games, probably stay away.  Otherwise there's a lot of fun gaming in there for just about everyone else.

B00AAX68HG|4.0|This game is so much fun and it will keep you busy when you are bored. The only dreading I game it a four is because you have to hug the hints after you use them all. If they we going to do that they could have lease gave you 10 or more.

0345803507|3.0|It's exactly what all the reviews said it was...a very easy read, poorly written, slightly disappointing. But overall it was OK.
B007SSEZNA|4.0|I have watched this version of Emma and the A&E (Kate Beckinsale/Mark Strong) and BBC (Romola Garai/Jonny Lee Miller) versions too.  I liked all of them, but my favorite is the BBC version.  Gwyneth Paltrow was convincing enough as Emma, and her relationship with her insipid father was well portrayed.  Jeremy Northam was fine (and handsome) as Mr. Knightley but there was too little shown of the relationship between Knightley and Emma.<br /><br />I am not a purist, so if the movie version doesn't follow the book to the letter, I'm okay with it as long as the main points are shown, the relationships are fleshed out and most of the dialogue is true to the author's written word.  This version disappointed in showing the intimacy of the Knightley relationship with the Woodhouse family.  But at  only two hours it's going to be disappointing in one respect or another.  Too much Harriet Smith, not enough Knightley, or the relationship between Churchill and Emma too.<br /><br />If you're not a purist, I say watch all of the versions out there!  They were all enjoyable in their own ways.  :)

B00COMLLX2|4.0|It's a good pinball game that I've been playing for hours but can't unlock any other tables but otherwise it's awesome!
078617465X|5.0|I had borrowed this from a friend and it took me so long to read it, ended up purchasing my own copy because it is so beautifully written, so that I could return the book to my friend and have my very own copy to finish and to lend to others.
B00005JNTX|4.0|I thought for a violent but comic book feel kinda movie it was really good. One of those movies that are different from the get go but its for those that can dare to check different paths of movies. Really liked the use of black/white to shoot the film but had little bits of color here an there which made the movie different too.<br />If you were looking for a flick to pick up with a lot of good actors I would recommend this.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a Great Series. Can not wait for Season 3.<br />I have no idea the difference between the UK Version and what was shown on TV here.

B00BSBUZT6|5.0|If you are an Eagles fan casual or serious you will absolutely like this DVD! The history behind this band is impressive. By the end of the DVD you will be amazed at how good this guys really are. The internal workings of the band (how they came to be) and the relationships were fully detailed, nothing was held back! I absolutely recommend this DVD!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I love this game. It has amazing symptoms and mutations to chose from. I just wish that you had more starter plagues. The game play is very realistic. I would definitely recommend it.
0307346617|3.0|This book was well written but without a central character in the action, it felt a bit anti-climactic.  Presented as a bunch of interviews, we never really know the interviewer, but each story told is fairly enjoyable.  If you like zombies and the walking dead tv show, you will probably like this.
B008B1BL4E|5.0|Great book on WWI and what caused it.  Detail new information that updated The Guns of August.  What made me mad is the way the European powers expressed their imperialism and took what they wanted for their own needs.  Wish Christopher would have spent some time acknowledging this fact.  Well...I have about 120 pages left...maybe he will do this in the last pages.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Intense, rousing, cynical and compelling. The life of many reflected in the life of one. Americans grow up with so little understanding of real want or deprivation. This window of work shines but a small light on what evil is possible in the world of men. A reminder perhaps that what is taken for granted is also transient and impermanent. It is so different, the world outside, what we regard as &#34;God Given&#34;. Perhaps there is something to learn here.
B00821OUT6|5.0|Great Cast. Cool camera angles. I didn't know what to expect, but I'm happy I gave this show a try. First season was great and I look forward to watching season 2.

B006GHA9QQ|5.0|I love the music from the firstmovie. I love the story and am looking forward to seeingthis movie at home
B008JFUP0I|4.0|If you weren't impressed with the trailers, or you're not a fan of this series, then you probably shouldn't bother with this movie. This entry won't win you over. Now, for the fans of this series (like myself) you are in for a treat!<br /><br />\\"Fast and Furious 6\\" (alternatively known as \\"Furious Six\\") picks up directly where \\"Fast Five\\" left off: with the revelation that Letty (Michelle Rodriquez) is alive. With this information, Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) persuades Dom (Vin Diesel) to help track down Owen Shaw (Luke Evans), a former soldier now leading a heist gang of murderers, whom Letty is working for. Dom now brings back the old crew to help bring down this gang and to figure where Letty's loyalties lie, resulting in \\"vehicular warfare\\".<br /><br />\\"Fast Five\\" brought new life to the franchise, and this entry takes what was great about \\"Fast Five\\" and expands on it, making this arguably the best chapter in the series.<br /><br />THE GOOD<br /><br />-The acting. No Oscar performances or anything, but still great. Most of the cast has returned in this film, and they all do a great job (again). It's one thing to have an awesome chase sequence, but it's another thing to have an awesome chase sequence with characters you actually care about, making some of the action pretty intense. Tyrese Gibson and Chris Bridges are great, their back-and-forth bickering is funny and they give their characters a great friendship. Dwayne Johnson was a great new addition to the cast in \\"Fast Five\\" and in this one he gives an even better performance, and delivers in every action sequence. Luke Evans isn't anything sort of amazing, but, he is still the best villain in the franchise so far. He seems to be having fun, and at least gets to participate in the action, making him more dangerous than anything Dom or his crew have ever faced before.<br /><br />-The comedy. I was surprised out how many times I actually laughed during the movie. No laugh-out-loud moments or anything, but it stillmakes the movie more enjoyable. A lot of this is due to the chemistry the cast has, and their delivery of one liners make them even better. Does all the comedy work? No, but there wasn't a moment I found myself rolling my eyes or anything.<br /><br />-There are also one or two twists here I wasn't expecting. This movies plot is as generic as you can get when it comes to action movies, but there were at least a couple of twists that made it more interesting than it needed to be.<br /><br />-The action. Well shot, well directed, and well choreographed. Most of the credit here really goes to director Justin Lin, who gets better and better in each installment. Every chapter in the \\"Fast and Furious\\" series gives audiences car chases and action they have never seen before, and this movie follows that tradition. If you've seen the trailers, then you know how over the top and ridiculous the action gets (there's a certain sequence with an airplane that, although cool and original, must have a sixty mile long runway) but I never thought the movie crossed the line (or at least it never went to the extent of someone surviving an atomic bomb explosion in a refrigerator).<br /><br />THE BAD<br /><br />-The pacing. The movie seems to lag a bit in the middle, and there is a subplot with Brian (Paul Walker) that ends up not being important at all. The only reason why this is here is because Paul Walker is the original star of the series so they wanted to give him more to do. Cutting out this subplot would have fixed pacing issues and would have made the full movie short, sweet, and to the point.<br /><br />-The plot of the movie: Letty is alive, there's some evil computer chip bad guys want, and the Rock and Vin Diesel try to stop them. There you go, that's the plot. This is the only reason why I gave the film four stars instead of five. However, there are twists and strong character moments that really save the movie from falling apart, and despite how cliché the plot is in the movie, it knows what it's trying to be and doesn't take itself too seriously. Justin Lin is just trying to make a fun movie, and succeeds at that.<br /><br />Overall, this is one of those movies that is really pointless to nitpick or criticize because it really doesn't try to be more than what it is: A dumb, yet entertaining action movie with strong characters. If you are a fan of this series, the only reason why you wouldn't like this is if you don't like how unrealistic the action has gotten (the first \\"Fast and the Furious\\", although over the top, does have somewhat realistic action). But for all the other fans of this series (or just action fans in general) you are in for a real thrill ride. Also, stay after the credits. There is something there fans will really appreciate, and got me very excited for \\"Fast and Furious 7\\". I honestly have no idea how this franchise has lasted so long, but somehow it's gotten even better! So screw it, the more the merrier!

B0087YYHZU|5.0|This movie has stood the test of time. After all these years it remains fresh, vibrant and cutting edge. The choreography is masterful, the music stirring. As terrific as Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds are, this movie's comedy is entirely due to Jean Hagen (Lina Lamont). What a terrific comedienne!!! A lovely day brightener.
030746363X|4.0|After a particularly decadent thirty day vacation, I had gained 20 pounds of fat placing me over 25% BF. I became aware of this book and the hype around it and decided to give it a shot, without very high expectations. The claims seemed very unrealistic, but as Tim Ferriss' approach was experimentation, I decided I would put them to the test.<br /><br />For the record, I followed the Slow-Carb Diet with moderate milk consumption, as well as the PAGG stack supplements, though my exercise routine was more vigorous than his proposal of four hours per month. I followed it for thirty days and easily lost the 20 lb of fat I gained, while moderately increasing my lean mass (as determined by bodyfat calipers).<br /><br />Compared to the claims by the book, this fat loss is not successful. However, I was more than pleased by the results. The diet was very easy to follow, inexpensive compared to my standard diet, and satisfying. The all-out days on Saturday were fun, though I felt gross and bloated each time I did indeed go all out, and desired to eat junk food less and less each week.<br /><br />The main attraction points to the diet for me were:<br /><br />1) Easy to follow and well-structured - the book lays out what you can't eat, what you can eat, and what you should eat in moderation. It is not terribly difficult to give up certain foods that are not \\"slow-carb friendly\\", especially knowing you can eat as much as you want of it at the end of the week.<br /><br />2) Little preparation needed - though the book doesn't go into great detail about recipes, the meals I ended up eating on a regular basis were very simple and not elaborate. This helped keep me focused rather than preparing elaborate recipes.<br /><br />3) Not excessively regimented or strict - if you can deal without cheese and sugar, then following the diet is simple. There are no \\"macronutrient ratios\\" to worry about, no set meal times, and no excessive calorie restrictions.<br /><br />I can't say how well this would work for someone who is already very lean, but I was more than happy with results and returned to my ideal weight after rapid weight gain. I say give it a shot, and if you don't want to pay for it, there are plenty of resources all over the internet available after a quick Google search so as to follow the diet without the book. The book itself was an interesting read, but unnecessary if you only wish to follow the slow-carb diet.

Also just because you click &#34;like&#34; then all this crap shows on the right hand side of everything that was &#34;liked&#34;.<br />FB needs to be more to friends and only show these pop up advertisements to that one persons &#34;like&#34; and not to everyone else who they are friends with or FB should make it to where you can click on those advertisement ads as &#34;delete&#34; and not &#34;hide&#34;. By doing the clicking on &#34;hide&#34; or &#34;hide this spam&#34; is just that and it pops back up when someone decides to click on &#34;like&#34;.

B0041D843M|5.0|After reading the criticism of this book and researching the basis of the claims against it, I can wholeheartedly side with Campbell. This book is a straightforward and well presented collection of work which strongly supports a whole-foods plant-based diet. No one study alone can conclusively PROVE that this is the proper diet for humans, but the plethora of studies, research, and anecdotal evidence all create a very clear and undeniable message. Those downplaying the significance of this book and Campbell's work are in serious denial of the reality of our evolution and the necessity of this lifestyle; for the earth and the future health of humanity.

B000FC13MM|5.0|I read this when I was a kid and was so happy to find it on here. the way he sets the surroundings and the subtle magics is awesome. I'd love to read more from this series if he goes beyond the four already out.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|My 8 year old nephew plays it . We compete to see how far we can get and what vechile we can get to.
B003WH765U|5.0|I first saw this movie with my parents when I was 8 and have loved it ever since. Despite the constraints of the 50s, the movie is open and the acting is first class.
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|this game is awesome best thing ive played in years. Y'all need this game aight this game has great grafics and is royalty go every game out there.
0553801473|4.0|The book is amazing, pretty much in love with the story. The conditions of the actual book were good. The book jacket has seen better days. Bent and slightly worn but it would have been worse. Overall really good.
B008YKGQR4|4.0|I didnt have any problem downloading it on my kindle fire. I use the full site &amp; have no problems. Great app.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|This was a gift my Mom requested for Mother's Day.  She was so pleased to get it.  Thanks for getting here on time.
B004J4XGN6|5.0|Eric does an amazing job pulling together his experience, industry theory and industry experience with practical recommendations on how to implement lean approaches in your startup or large enterprise. I've read a lot around how to organize around lean and agile practices with dense and amazing content from books like Scaling Lean & Agile Development: Thinking and Organizational Tools for Large-Scale Scrum, by Bas Vodde and Craig Larman[[ASIN:0321480961 Scaling Lean & Agile Development: Thinking and Organizational Tools for Large-Scale Scrum]]. While very interesting, queue theory is fascinating for modern worker efficiency by the way, they are still difficult to apply. The Lean Startup makes it clear what tools you should use and hinges on a critical element of using data in a rigorous approach to be your guiding star on what the next most important task should be. Great stuff.<br />One of my favorite exercises in team and employee efficiency is the envelope problem, very mind blowing on challenging commonly held efficiency beliefs. Check it out on Eric's blog under The Power of Small Batches, by Eric Ries.
0307165485|5.0|My son grew up with the Richard Scarry books, and this is just one in the start of our grandsons library.  I know that each of them will be well loved.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|I got this for my 3& 1/2 yr old granddaughter and she absolutely LOVES it!!! She loves these types of things on the Kindle.
B003DTLUFO|5.0|First nendroid purchase that was not a fake, and I am very pleased with just how much better the quality is in comparison. I will be buying a lot more of these.
B008MBXFEM|4.0|Film Score fans always seem to be divided when it comes to Hans Zimmer.  The self proclaimed &#34;purists&#34; think of him as the anti-Christ while others, like myself, feel he is the best in the business.<br /><br />For me, Dark Knight Rises proves Zimmer is at the top of his game. While themes from Batman Begins and Dark Knight are brought back, the music feels new, rich and full of energy.<br /><br />The one downside to this album is that it is missing a fairly large amount of music from within the movie. Even with its many unnecessary deluxe tracks, The Dark Knight Rises is a great addition to any OST collection.
B000FBJF6Y|5.0|Just a delightful read. Insightful look at Botswana's culture. Vivid characters and a wide range of compelling mysteries to solve.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|This box set is very nice.  All DVDs are in good working order and I am enjoying them every night.
0425220931|5.0|A must read for anyone looking to improve their musicianship and life. Looks at the nuances of music and how they affect the listener and the player.
0061950726|5.0|I am reading this book for our FL bookclub: and the author is doing a presentation of the book in Ellsworth, ME in July 2013 for the library book club there.  The public will be invited.
0316056898|5.0|It made me laugh out loud...it's funny.  Plus super fast shipping.  I love Tina Fey.  She is awesome.  Thank you
B008ZCWFEE|5.0|Well thought out, well executed. My 4 6 &amp; 10 yr old boys love it. Healthy mind food. Pairs very well with algebra touch.
B004G606K8|5.0|I absolutly loved this book!  All the characters have well-developed personalities that can easily pull the reader into thier world and keep them there.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|I had trouble mounting my iPhone 4S in my clock radio because my iPhone case comes too close to the connector. This little device took care of it.<br /><br />You do have to be careful in a cradle situation as the weight of the phone is suspended at the end of what is essentially a lever with no actual support for the phone body. If you were to accidentally knock the phone while it is propped up on top of this in the cradle, it's possible something could break - either your cradle device, this adapter or worse yet, your iPhone connector. Or maybe it would just fall off my clock radio. I am not going to try it.<br /><br />It has been working for 4 months without issue.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The color of war is not always black and white.<br />A heartfelt, believable story from the bleakest time in history with moments of golden sun shine.<br />This is a must read book!
B006LSZECO|5.0|A well thought out, AMAZING story. A little speechless at the moment. Wishing the ending was different but I need to ponder the last few chapters. I feel like I've known women like Amy!
B001DM1VXE|2.0|I actually watched the whole movie and didn't care for any of it.  I'm sure this would appeal to some but not me.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|An extraordinary account of one marine's account of the terrible battles in the south Pacific during World War 2. I was impressed with the honesty and details contained in this book. A must read for any veteran. Especially a Marine!!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I didn't want the movie to end.  Loved the movie and I can hardly wait for the sequel to follow.
B0026OR1UK|5.0|Coyle documents the correlation between intense (or deep) practice and acquired talent.  In the process he debunks the myth that greatness is born.<br /><br />This is a must-read by any parent, teacher or student suffering with the illusion that greatness will somehow manifest itself without deep-practice. The book is particularly useful in describing the form, through numerous examples, of practice necessary to develop talent.  Perhaps most useful is the process of &#34;chunking&#34; to break down practice into manageable steps.  Anyone who reads this book will never look at the learning process the same way.<br /><br />This book is a game changer in the field of learning.
1452110581|4.0|I thought most of them were really clever but I thought the book was overpriced at full price.  I'm glad I got it for a discount.
B00847KFDS|3.0|Loved John Fogerty since 1968's Creedence Clearwater Revival debut, but i knew this wouldn't be one of those albums i could set down and listen all the way through.  It has it's moments with The Foo Fighters \\"Fortunate Son\\",  Miranda Lambert and Tom Morello \\"Wrote A Song For Everyone\\" and Brad Paisley does justice with \\"Hot Rod Heart\\".  I'm sorry but \\"Lodi\\", sounds comedic, \\"Almost Saturday Night\\", with Keith Urban doesn't have any flavor at all.  Zac Brown Band, Bob Seger, Alan Jackson, Kid Rock, Jennifer Hudson and My Morning Jacket don't cut it either.  Love his 2 solo cuts the country rockin' \\"Mystic Highway\\" and \\"Train Of Fools\\".  Something about collaboration albums there's a lot of s*&t.  John don't listen to your wife Julie again on something like this, just give us another solid album.
B008YRVW0I|4.0|Fun game. Good graphics. I liked being able to make my own tank and decorate with fish and extras. Thanks
B00C25TCZ0|5.0|For this 52 year-old, the Black Star Riders \\"All Hell Breaks Loose\\",  is a classic rock and roll album.  Led by guitarist  Scott Gorham (Thin Lizzy), with Ricky Warwick (The Almighty), a very strong lead vocalist, guitarist Damon Johnson (Brother Cane and Alice Cooper),  Marco Mendoza (Blue Murder) a solid bass player and a great drummer Jimmy DeGrasso (many rock acts).  They give us their Thin Lizzy sound with their own view of hard rock.  We get great tunes in the title track, \\"Don't turn your back on me\\", the great first single \\"Bound For Glory\\", just wish somebody would play this.  The Irish romp of \\"Kingdom Of The Lost\\", nice uilleann pipes by Patrick D'Arcy.  \\"Bloodshot\\", a smokin' rocker, love the dual guitar of Gorham and Johnson.  The all out assault of \\"Kissin' The Ground\\", Mendoza and DeGrasso are a great rhythm section.  \\"Hey Judas\\", should be a hard rock classic, but with no airplay don't count on it, Scott cooks here.  \\"Hoodoo Voodoo\\", solid, Warwick in prime form.  \\"Valley Of Stones\\", straight ahead rocker, Gorham and Johnson shine here with Marco Mendoza.  \\"Someday Salvation\\", this has that Thin Lizzy vibe, very strutting tune, nice drums by Jimmy.  \\"Before The War\\", classic, great rock tune, the band was rolling here.  \\"Blues Ain't So Bad\\", speaking of classics, here's another one, Mendoza and DeGrasso keep that beat and Gorham and Johnson put in some solid riffs, Warwick sounds excellent here.  This ranks with Deep Purple \\"Now What?!\\", as 2 of the best rock releases of 2013 so far.  Produced by Kevin Shirley who has done some fine work lately with Black Country Communion and Iron Maiden.  The music scene stinks right now, but this is a classic album.  One more note, most kids today, have no music taste!
B0091REZMW|4.0|I played this before on facebook. hopefully I wont have to get friends to play Cuz they wont and then I won't be playing. I won't be spending money on top of having to enlist friends. I give it four stars for fun
B009CF3MEK|3.0|The acting wasn't believable at times, it reminded me of a soap opera. I liked this movie more when it first came out.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|Again these criticisms are purely aesthetic the visuals are fabulous. Effects and the acting are top-notch. While any swords and sorcery movie is going to have violence this one has been kept to a tasteful and almost family-friendly level.
B008NAFU9A|4.0|Ophelia's is a young woman who has been successful at hiding her true identity when keeping low profile at a mansion with some rich lady to find out what happens to her mother. Until one day she looked in the mirror and discovering the mark of the serpent on her neck. A death sentence in this time of year (1880) before you know it the people think you're a witch and hang you. When she is send out by her mistress to deliver a letter late in the evening she find trouble. Rescued by the hands of the mysterious Ethan is soon finds out there is more about Ethan than meets the eye. This is the start of the story and the FOREVER GIRL SERIES. Ophelia discovers there is not only more about Ethan but she as well is not hundred percent human.<br /><br />Her Sweetest Downfall is a sweet short introduction to this series. although some part felt a little tight and cramped with all the explaining about the types of paranormal beings that exist in this series. To many to name and way to many for me to even repeat one, or even know how to write the difficult names of the species even tho I just finished this book yesterday.<br /><br />It almost felt like Rebecca tried to explain the whole scenario before the readers begin the first book of this series and was checking off a list with the families, names and paranormal beings she liked to mention in this Novella.<br /><br />I also had a little trouble with the main character. Although I liked her and the story and world building are phenomenal I still had problems with determining the age of Ophelia. First I thought she was a teen (virgin maybe, immature behavior about keeping her mark secret) but after meeting Ethan she didn't hesitate to jump in bed with him. But with all the talk about her mother and murder of her father I found it a little confusing.<br /><br />But I think we will soon find it out with the first book of the Forever Girl series.<br /><br />This book is in an alternate Regency England, \\"\\"Her Sweetest Downfall\\"\\" is a standalone novella in the \\"\\"Forever Girl\\"\\" series, written as a gift to fans of the Forever Girl series.a standalone novella in the \\"\\"Forever Girl\\"\\" series, written as a gift to fans of the Forever Girl series.
B003W9JELC|5.0|So i been watching movies lately and i stumbled upon this movie and brought back memories on when i used to have a crush on Miley Cyrus \\"Exposed hehe\\" so i thought lets watch it and to my surprise the movie was not bad at all it was super interesting \\"In my stamp point of view.. exposed again\\".<br /><br />If your a fan of Miley and been there for her since the very start like me pick this up Buy it or Rent it its a good movie i myself rented it i might pick up the Physical Copy
B008IJT0CE|4.0|I'm a little glad I got this app as the free app of the day and didn't have to pay for it. Its nice, but ive never needed anything like this to fall asleep. the one thing I will use is the binuraul things. I was wide awake, turned on the low one, and almost fell asleep within 5 minutes! then I tries the higher one and got past a level on a game that I have been trying to pass for weeks. overall, I'm pretty impressed.
0545265355|5.0|Decided to read the books after watching the first movie. Easy read and very entertaining. The books also cleared up some questions I had after watching the movie. I would highly recomend them.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game. Love the set up and graphics. Its really fun and enjoyable... easy to use!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I first read Wool Omnibus last summer on my ereader while camping at the beach with my grandkiddies. I read with many distractions of little kids huddled in my tent, fireworks going off, people talking loud all around my campsite, etc. In other words, it was very LOUD. It didn't matter. I was enthralled and flipped from Wool 1 to 2 through to 5 within a few days even with all the noise. Hugh Howey's talent as a writer has put him in the big leagues going from working at a bookstore to traveling the world doing TV shows, interviews, book signings, you name it! When his book was published in hardback, I snatched up a 1st edition and have spent the last week rereading this amazing book, this time in the quiet and comfort of my home! It was even better the second time around!<br /><br />Set in a, hopefully, distant future, the descendents of survivors live in a silo deep beneath the earth. The characters, the world building and the story is absolutely amazing and I devoured it again!!<br /><br />My signed copy of Shift Omnibus Edition just arrived direct from Mr. Howey, himself, and I plan to reread each story continuously just as eagerly as I did when each was released. I cannot get enough of this world of Wool that Howey has created. Well done, sir! Very well done!
B00COHAUD4|4.0|Not the betst special effects, but if you like an old fashioned kind of scare you off of your seat movie, Mama was great
B00CH87HF4|4.0|I have played this game for  a few days now with several classes. The potion system would be better used with in game coins but I enjoy games with a bit of grinding. Perhaps it would be nice to lessen the time it takes to regenerate potions but all in all I have made very few problems.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|The tornado hockey I can pass it on my ipod; but cannot<br />pass on the kindle. I am rating this game a 1 star because it is very frustrating. Not Good for the kindle!!!!!!
B0046B3QTG|5.0|Great animated feature with hysterical characters and a decent plot line. The &#34;minions&#34; were particularly funny. Smart enough for adults and very funny for kids.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This app is really fun, but it is really expensive. I mean, seven bucks? A reasonable price is probably $2.99. I reccomend buying the free version to see if you like it. And don't buy the computer version, it is twenty-five dollars.<br /><br />P.S. Don't play this app too much, or else you might start to think and see in minecraft, and become a minecraftian. Don't say I didn't warn you.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|\\"The Misremembered Man\\" is one of the best books I have read. With a history of abuse and  the effects on his life as an adult, I was pleasantly surprised at the end. Have your tissue  ready for shocking events during the book and happiness at the end.<br /><br />Very well written!<br /><br />\\"The Misremembered Man\\" is a must read!
B006M4F67A|3.0|I have this game on my phone (S3). It's your typical Mahjong set-up, but I find the tiles too small to easily play.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|Disappointed there wasn't a central character, but enjoyed the what if scenarios and insights that Max Brooks introduces to the reader.
0743201140|5.0|This covers all the basics of the StrengthsQuest models and adds enough supportive information to enable the reader to understand the program very well. Well-written and concise.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Loved this game.  Kept me on my toes and guessing at every turn.  One of my favorites games so far.
B000LJ9ZWO|3.0|When this movie was released in 1973, the idea of computers and robots run amok was much fresher than it is now (2013).  And, Westworld's pacing is inconsistent, perhaps due to Crichton's inexperience as director.  Despite these drawbacks, it's still worth seeing; it provides a window into how computer technology was perceived in its day.
B000GWE44U|2.0|A mother and son who find themselves trapped at an empty hotel with an axe-wielding killer are the ones I'm supposed to rooting for, but all the while I'm hoping he chops them to bits. Then I'll no longer have to look at their asinine facial expressions. They're terrified, yes; if an axe to the face isn't scary enough, the hotel is also haunted by ghosts; but director Stanley Kubrick doesn't seem to realize that it's possible to be terrified with a straight face. Exaggerated grimaces, especially in the case of the mother; the pathetic victim type a villain in this type of movie thrives on; takes away from any potential realism The Shining has to offer.<br /><br />But that's a side issue. The main problem here is the story itself, which, thanks mostly to an unnecessary reliance on paranormal activity; \\"shining\\" apparently means a form of telepathy; is often nonsensical, or, at best, confusingly random. Is Jack Torrance going crazy or is he really seeing ghosts? That seems like a valid question until his wife starts seeing them too. Then the answer should be that he's not going crazy. But he obviously is. So the answer must be both, which is all too convenient for the plot; a plot that is now allowed to lazily throw logic out of a hotel room window in favor of creepiness for the sake of being creepy.<br /><br />marcellee.com
B00992CF6W|4.0|I say this game is good for nerds and it is very fun on the go. With me I'm a LEGIT gamer and honestly this is good for when your bored this game makes you think but I don't give a ship I just have fun.
B006ZZC3D6|5.0|This game is awesome. I love playing it. Keep up the good work. I would recommend it to everyone. Download it.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Very cute fun educational game for all ages clean game fun entertaining  and fantastic game where u get to plant and take care of fish u also learn what fish live in what
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Quick, easy to use and reliable.  Select your product, pay for your selection, and receive your selection within minutes.  What could be simpler ?
B004IQMXD4|5.0|What can I say that has not been said about Stevie Nicks, She is just fantastic as she has always been.
B000VSAEYI|5.0|I bought this last year for my then 1 year old.  He had a blast with it in the backyard.  This weekend we got it back out the garage half expecting it have a leak somewhere, but was pleasantly suprised that it did not!  The slide needs to be kept wet for it really be slippery enough, but that is no big deal since my kiddo prefers to play with the hose while in the pool anyway.  He played in it all weekend having just as much fun now that he's 2.  Definately worth the $32 last summer!
B0044XRIMW|5.0|Between Julie Andrews, Chris Plummer, and the children that were cast, this is one of my all-time fave movies out there...
B00124BNF4|5.0|The Talking Heads are always fantastic, and it's nice to have so many hits in one compilation. A great album.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think that this game is really interesting, and is fun to play. It reminds me of temple run but in a good way.
B0027MJU00|4.0|This was my favorite of Gillian Flynn's novels. It's a crazy story with the same tone as her other books (Gone Girl and Sharp Objects), but the suspense of Libby's journey to figure out the story about her family will keep you turning the page.
B008MM9630|5.0|Kind of expensive if you get too addicted!  I love it tho! I would recommend it to friends :-) . Great for all ages
B001GXF2YY|5.0|The character of Harry Bosch appears in a preview I know it will be another great story in the series. I like how Michael Connelly allows the character to grow and change from book to book.
B00C7TAF3Y|1.0|Haven't been able to access this app since I purchased it.  Should explicitly state not compatible with Kindle Fire if in fact it isn't.  It just says its compatible with Kindle tablets.  Not the same device obviously!
B0090EHVMC|4.0|This movie was very entertaining for our family.  The kids loved it and it delivered a good message, so what else is there to say.
B008KYOCA2|4.0|So far so good. Wish I could sync to my Google calendar and perhaps I can, just have to take time to try it.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|entertaining and eventful read.  enjoyed the book much better than the movie, but I like most books better than their movie counterparts.
B00111NDQU|5.0|Timberland always makes excellent quality boots and this one was no exception. They fit is perfect and the leather is great quality and they look fantastic. I would highly recommend this product.
B003B02O7I|5.0|This is one of John Grishams best books I have head and I have read them all.  I would recommend this one to all of my friends.
0345803485|3.0|Not for men. My daughter liked it but I found it too honey coated to suit me. But you might love it.
B003B02OOG|5.0|This is a great book, I have read all of John Grisham books and would highly recommend this one.  It is a combination of a lot of events in Ford County.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Love this game it is super fun my husband and I lie in bed playing this game together. We both love love love it.
B00COGY6YO|3.0|If you've played Lego Batman 2, there is no need to watch this movie.  It is honestly just the cutscenes from the game
B004SIP7S0|5.0|This work told the life of Frida with realism and truth. It was very explicit and did not hide anything.
B001RCD2DW|5.0|There are probably better reviews, but the sound these headphones produce is nothing short of amazing. I recommend these to anybody looking for actual sound quality, not just a brand name.
B00CRS5HII|5.0|Darius Rucker has such a wonderful voice. This CD is full of wonderful songs. I loved every one of them!
B002WLTI62|5.0|(Cheaper than the download, and you still get the instant download + a cd). I bought this entire CD since it was so cheap. I wasn't familiar with any of the songs except for She Wolf, but I ended up liking the entire CD! Every song is good! Fun to dance to!
B004GYY714|5.0|TuneIn Radio is the best App I have downloaded.  I have used it to listen<br />to my favorite radio stations regardless of where I am located.  I have listened<br />to other radio stations around the world for a different perspective and this<br />app delivers.
0385344228|4.0|What are we doing to our children?  What are we not doing for them?  These questions are the underlying themes of this page turner.  For this reader, however, the most important question is not how to defend Jacob but how to defend the parents of Jacob.  A very sad book in which there are no winners.  I do not recommend this book for parents of troubled teens.
B004L9MFM2|3.0|It's a very long period of time and far to many characters you have to follow  in order to understand the plot......meaning by that you cann't stop and put the book to rest and then continue sometime later.<br />Over all its catches your attention and make reading addictive.
1439153663|4.0|The cast of landed gentry in this story are led by a sadistic alcoholic and his crazy, laudanum addicted mother.  Their Negro slaves, in contrast, are devoted family members who lovingly raise the white immigrant child who turns up in their kitchen house.  The plot twists and turns while the reader watches the deterioration of this plantation and the beginning of the end of slavery. There are plenty of complicated love affairs in both camps, and it is interesting to note the differences in the meanings of love and marraige in the plantation house and the kitchen house.
0446604844|5.0|Baldacci at his best.  Exciting, circuitous.  A great read for Baldacci fans!<br />Keeps you guessing until the end.  Highly recommended.
B006O3MU96|4.0|I enjoyed playing this game (or a variant thereof) at an arcade.  So when this came up as a FAOTD, I grabbed it.  It's fun for random free time as it usually is quick, however, it does get a bit repetitive.  I usually on make one or two attempts before I switch to a different game.
0062059963|3.0|Frustrated Reader<br /><br />If there is another book to the Selection Trilogy - as in The Prince is not included as part of the Triology - I would give this a much higher rating.  If not, this book was a complete waste and left me with with the same questions I had after reading The Selection and more.
B00846F1YW|5.0|Love the hidden theme game. The story line was corny, but the puzzles were very challenging. I look forward to the next mystery.
B0018RWMNM|5.0|This blu-ray transfer came out better than I ever could have hoped for. And for this price? Amazing! This is one of the best westerns in any medium.
B008PZZFHA|5.0|This is certainly the best ever South Park movie.  One has to wonder &#34;If they made a second, what would the title be?&#34;
1416575464|5.0|Domino: Book of Decorating is a great book that has taught me how to decorate each room in my home with ease. The pictures are coordinated to help me put together colors, textures and furniture that I thought would never complement each other. This book of decoration has opened up a world of decorating creativity that i did not know i could do.  Domino: Book of Decorating has changed my entire home!
B007TKT2SK|4.0|This app comes in handy with my carpentry work.  It's a simple app and very easy to use.  I just happened to stumble across it but it makes life much easier and saves me from simple mistakes.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|I didn't find this movie funny, which is sad as I found is semi prequel &#34;Knocked Up&#34; funny. It was a long, unfunny movie. :(
B008IJT0CE|5.0|My fiancee` is a very light sleeper and since we got this app on our kindle, we both get a much better nights sleep. Now we listen to the rain and fall asleep right away. I HIGHLY recommend this app.
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|The historical context for Downton Abbey is terrific.  The acting is well-done.  The clothes, the cars, the setting and the architecture are great.  But at the core of Downton Abbey, it's a soap opera.  It has more in common with JR Ewing than it does with JP Morgan. I wish them well, but be forewarned: the cliff-hangers and interpersonal drama drive their stories, not the historical drama.
B005S9EJ46|5.0|Beautiful performances dealing in an amusing and up beat way with the acceptance of old age, and yet finding ways to have a positive outlook on it.
B0063M22QO|3.0|THIS APP MAY BE GOOD FOR BEGINNERS AS IT GIVES INSTRUCTION.  I'M . LOOKING FOR SOMETHIN A BIT MORE CHALLENGING TO ME.
B001AQO400|1.0|It made me feel like I was experiencing a male menopause.  The direction drags, Bill Murray is too introverted and there is little to entertain except some pastiche scenes capturing modern Japanese big city life.
B00536OCZA|5.0|the original record was great but this remaster from the original was excelent. is cool to hear new remaster dark side of the moon from my old turntable
B00AHTYGRW|3.0|It is a perfectly ok movie, very reliant on history, but not particularly suspenseful.  It is testimony to the enormous popularity of Affleck, and to the psychosis in the American mind that still grips the nation - of outrage - that Americans could be treated so disrespectfully.
B0018RFLQ2|5.0|My husband and I along with our 7 and 9 year old daughters watched this move.  We all thought it was great.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|While the series goes very near to melodrama on almost every episode, the acting, direction, and recreation of the period is absolutely rivetting.  I cannot recommend this series enough.
B0045HCJRG|5.0|We ordered this DVD because it represents in part anyway our era 50's & 60's.  The songs and the cold war threat.
B001EIOOVS|5.0|It had the feel of the New York City that I remembered when I visited at the time the operation was full blown.
B00169N0BK|5.0|This is an amazing product. At first, I was disappointed because the prints didn't match the monitor. Then, I made the prints come out perfectly. Here's how I did it with a Mac Pro, 2 Samsung Monitors and an Epson Stylus Pro 3880:<br /><br />Make sure that you print the test charts without color management of ANY kind. At first, I didn't use the profile, but it reverted to printer management. Make sure that you are printing with ABSOLUTELY NO printer color management. The directions say this clearly, but didn't warn to watch that it doesn't revert to printer color management. This yielded much better, but still mediocre, results. Then, I downloaded the Printer Evaluation Image from http://www.outbackphoto.com/printinginsights/pi048/essay.html and used it to generate the third test pattern, using the previously made printer profile. Bingo! I went from just barely acceptable to spectacular. It looked like I could pick the strawberries off the test print. I've never seen color like this from the Epson. Maybe everyone else knows this, but I found out that when you get the profile EXACTLY right, the colors leap off the page. I'm reprinting a lot of pictures that I was very proud of before, but now are just breathtaking! AND, I hit it every time! I'm also using the cheapest paper I have found, Kirkland from Costco (8.5 x 11 in the store, 11x14 and 13 x 19 on the Costco Website), along with InkJet Mall's inks. The prints are truly museum quality, and I'm very critical and almost impossible to satisfy. These prints look like the dye transfer prints I used to spend hundreds of dollars on EACH, or the old Cibachromes on the rare instances when I nailed it after a whole evening in the darkroom.<br /><br />Don't waste your money on a monitor-only solution. What good is a perfectly calibrated monitor when the prints don't match? That's what I had with the i1 express2. I'm glad it became obsolete with Mountain Lion, because it forced me into perfection.
B00A81NFAS|4.0|Lower middle class family issues are not my favorite topics but as I got into the movie I began to like it more and more.
B00BLGZDVS|1.0|I looked forward to seeing the Master since it opened in theaters.  I could not get interested in the story and stopped watching it after 30 minutes.
B002SJIO5E|3.0|A fairly outlandish plot and obviously low budget, but it was played and directed well. A part of me found it quite silly, but I allowed myself to get drawn in.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|Funny look from man's perspective. Very insightful. Laughed mostly. Didn't care for preachy parts. Enjoyed cast. Great choices of men depicted too
B00CWV8X04|4.0|A unique film that kept us all intrigued from beginning to end. I would recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys a good suspense movie.
B005H9B44A|5.0|I have always thought that the Marvel movies about their comic book heroes were well done, and this continues the streak for me.
B003ASLJK4|4.0|was updating the collection and decided to add a few more of Ms Streep's films...arrived on time and in as advertised condition
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|This was a good movie.  It dragged a bit here and there.  A bit of a disappointment but still entertaining.
B004EPYZUS|4.0|Another Tom Cruise movie....Needed this one to complete the mission Impossible series...dvd was on time and in as advertised condition
B00AFEY354|5.0|This is a fun movie something you can watch with your 15 year old and still enjoy it yourself. I would recommend this movie
B000X2H8G4|3.0|The Super Ear product arrived as described, and in perfect condition. My complaint pertains only to<br />how use of the amplification system impacts my experience as a birder. I find I'm better able to hear<br />bird calls and songs, but have difficulty judging the distance or directionality of the sound, so I'm<br />unsure where sound is coming from. I don't know where to address my attention or the binoculars.<br />Basically, I probably need an expensive ear-insertion type hearing aid, since my hearing deficit likely<br />exceeds what the Super Ear product can resolve.
B001UV4XUG|5.0|this was a gift for a teen girl and she loves it. Think she has watched it 20 times now

B00BRBIA6C|5.0|Agnetha's album 'A' is making a great showing on the European &amp; Aussie Album Charts!<br /><br />The current (05/27/13) peak position on the Album Charts is:<br /><br />Number 2 in Sweden, Denmark &amp; Switzerland<br /><br />Number 3 in Norway, Australia &amp; Germany<br /><br />Number 5 in Scotland<br /><br />Number 6 in the UK &amp; Belgium<br /><br />In North America the chart position is a bit more southward ... the album is at Number 138 on the Canadian Albums Chart and number 186 on the US Billboard 200.<br /><br />(It should do better though with the U.S. single release of the disco style track 'Dance Your Pain Away')<br /><br />According to Agnetha F&auml;ltskog's official website, 'Dance Your Pain Away' will be released in the U.S as a digital only single and feature two brand new mixes by Smash Mode.  This energetic disco track can gain popularity as a club hit, propelling the album higher on the North American Album Charts :)<br /><br />As both an Agnetha and an ABBA fan, I say 'Thank you for the music, for giving it to me' ...<br /><br />A great comeback album Agnetha ... thanks for singing a new song Chiquitita!<br /><br />Jeffrey A.

B003QSPTAY|5.0|This was one of my favorite movies growing up and now my daughters love watching it to. Great chick flick for little girls get togethers.and great for watching with mom and daughters. cute, fun movie.
B005H0CBZ0|3.0|A disconcerting number of errors, in the translation to Kindle.<br />- disconcerting when you have to stop and reread a sentence or paragraph and correct the error.  Misplaced words and simple typing errors.<br /><br />The story became tedious in the later stages of the novel, but overall the book is an enjoyable one.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Best book ever!<br />It talks about real life situations. I liked that you could relate to the problems.<br />I would recommend this book to my friends and family.
B00B23O96A|1.0|Bought this album without listening to any of the clips, simply because it was Clapton. I mean CLAPTON... how bad could it be?  Well, I have rarely been this disappointed with an album. Complete waste of time and money. As a devoted fan of Clapton I just can't believe how lazy and insubstantial this album is from beginning to end. NOT ONE SINGLE MEMORABLE SONG. It really is as if Clapton was just wasting some time in a studio and they decided to make an album out of the dross he produced, seemingly in his sleep! Old Sock (sorry, I just cant resist)STINKS! Did he even pick up his guitar during these sessions? Acoustic or electric? Sure doesn't sound like it. Strongly suggest fans of Clapton ignore this sloppy, sad, meandering mess and look elsewhere for their blues guitar thrills.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|my daughter loves playing this game! I even find myself playing just to earn her more points. the games are challenging for her but she can still manage most of them.
B00006FDCD|4.0|Fortunately I like both the book and the movie. Both are scary. But I have to wonder why Richard Mauser is top-billed since he's onscreen for less than 5 minutes.
B00563K3DA|5.0|At first I wasn't sure about that book. Yeah! another book which tell me that poverty is a gift and that looking to be more comfortable in my life is nearly a capital sin. But no! I do found an inspiring philosophy in this book and I believe that it is a very good book to read no matter your expecting are.<br /><br />MarKo

0385366752|2.0|The story line is highly unlikely and the plot twists just don't sound plausible.  I love a good mystery but this author stretched the limits of possibility in my opinion.
B004H4XDBI|5.0|I love how this story pulls you in from Adams side! I felt every single feeling he felt the ending brought me to tears. BEAUTIFUL writing by Gayle foreman I can't wait for more books from this author!
0307341577|3.0|So I guess this is what disappointment feels like. After reading Gillian Flynn's debut novel, Sharp Objects, and loving it to the moon and back, I expected to pick up Dark Places and instantly fall madly in love with it, what with the author's now-established dark and grimy style and everything.<br /><br />Dark Places proves it's true, what they say about keeping your expectations low. Except for the main character, Libby, her mom (who is also a POV character in certain chapters of the novel), and a couple of other barely-there characters, pretty much every person depicted in this book is the sort of screwed-up you'd just itch to backhand in the face multiple times. I remember reading Sharp Objects, a book laden with horrible people I was interested and deeply afraid of at the same time, and boy, have those characters nothing to do with the collection of soulless pricks in Dark Places.<br /><br />Ms. Flynn's writing remained great and engrossing, the pacing was pitch-perfect, and I was glued to the book chapter by chapter, especially since they alternated between POVs and always left me wanting to know what was going to happen next. Except not much happened by the end, and instead of closing the book with some shivers and a sense of my-god-this-book-was-a-ride!, I just glared at its cover like I'd been cheated.<br /><br />In the end, Dark Places is a superbly-written novel about arguably good people who were either brutally murdered or are psychologically scarred for life, and definitely irredeemable jerks who never got what they deserve.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I found the book very exciting. It is a book that you do not want to put down. I love authors who capture you within the first chapter. I read often and if I am not captured right away, I will put down the book and may never pick it up. This book is for adults only. The sex in the book is somewhat graphic in certain parts so it is not for children. I love the author and I hope that E. James writes more of these types of books.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|It is not a hard read, but not at all dull. Keeps you wanting to see the answer to the next question and these questions continue to come up during the entire book.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Let's be quick, because this review will sink into the crowd in a few days.<br /><br />In spite of a small budget and rudimentary effects and broken laws of physics, this may be one of the very best interpretations of the \\"Space Opera\\" genre. It had at least four mysteries in its back story. And in these scant 14 episodes none of them were resolved, however in the film, \\"Serenity\\", two are resolved. There is also the arc of the romance between two characters. And with nine characters on the \\"Serenity\\", four of which have mysterious backgrounds, that's more than enough to keep things interesting. But that's water over the dam.<br /><br />If there is anything which defines the difference between \\"Firefly\\" and \\"Star Wars\\", its the way Nathan Fillion interprets the character of the captain of the \\"Serenity\\". Fillion is much, much more realistic than Han Solo as both an outlaw and a captain of a ship with some noisome crew members and \\"passengers\\". Most fun comes form Adam Baldwin, who is playing his signature \\"Animal Mother\\" character from \\"Full Metal Jacket\\".<br /><br />One very important law of physics which is obeyed is the time required to travel great distances. Unlike the universe in Star Wars, the venue for Firefly is just one planetary system. One or maybe two suns around which several planets and their moons circle which are capable of being terraformed, and have been made earthlike several generations before. Therefore, there are no interstellar jumps, and it is harder for the transporter / smuggler / bandit crew of the Serenity to hide from the authorities of the government of the inner planets. That mean it is not at all implausible that the outer planets have a wild west feel to them, not unlike Tatooine. It is probably easier to transport a colt to a world with no gas, but lots of prairie, and use horse power.<br /><br />One wonderful backstory unexplored is why so many actors break out in Chinese speeches. It's a lot like better Sci-Fi back stories like \\"Clockwork Orange\\" with its Russian slang and \\"Blade Runner\\" with its \\"city speak\\" (sic). Only in the audio comments do we hear that its based on the idea that before emigrating to this new system, earth was controlled by two cultures, American and Chinese. So all business is conducted in English or Chinese, or a bit of both.<br /><br />One thing which adds a strong sense of reality to the filming is that the entire interior of \\"Serenity\\" was built as one complete set, with loads of realistic looking \\"used future\\" fixtures. They can film long steadycam scenes from one end of the ship to another without a break.<br /><br />Here's hoping someone gets the wherewithal to do for \\"Firefly\\" what they did for \\"Star Trek\\".Clockwork Orange\\" with its Russian slang and \\"Blade Runner\\" with its \\"city speak\\" (sic).

B009NNG202|4.0|I was mesmorized by the storyline from his birth to manhood but was alittle taken by the way he got away with the murders.<br />Other than that it was an interesting movie and entertaining.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Very enjoyable.I laughed out loud .I usually do not find myself laughing aloud,but this book is poignant,funny.sad at times?Thoroughly enjoyed it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I enjoyed the game, though it was quite frustrating at times. Can't wait for the next one, I will definitely get it!
B00CWM3F4C|5.0|First off, to the \\"complainers\\" who are still b$itching about the vocals; we all miss Staley people but isn't it time to move on?<br /><br />AIC brings yet another tightly produced, sludgy-masterpiece with the lyrical content/melodies to satiate the most critical of fans.<br />Let's give Duvall some credit were credit is due: this man stepped into impossible-to-fit-shoes; he has crushed the vocals on the last two albums via his drone (and almost copy-cat) style of singing, that somehow manages to not disrespect Layne's legaacy.  Furthermore, its obvious that Cantrell recognizes how well Duvall's style so perfectly compliment his monstrous riffs. Compound that with the duo's ability to write and perform some truly beautiful melodies/harmonies and you get an end-product that once again earns its place along-side the Layne-led material of old.<br /><br />I really respect these guys for persevering over the past 25 years; they've kept true to their distinctive sound and style and continue to produce simply superb music.
B00BF123WG|4.0|this is an excellent depiction of the before and during of the navy seal operation to capture/ kill Bin Ladden, but before watching it one needs to be prepared to watch graphic scenes of torture.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Hannibal is a fantastic show from creator Bryan Fuller, who also made Pushing Daisies and Wonderfalls. Really great performances from all the leads. It's a very layered show, with emotions, humor, and mystery. And the lead men are both really sexy, so there's that, too. Highly recommended.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This is a really cute movie that is good for kids and adults alike. A little scary for the under 8 crowd.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|The first 500 pages build up the story. The next 400+ are huge event after huge event. It doesn't feel too long, nor does the plot wander aimlessly. This is the saddest, fiercest, best book yet.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|Loved this movie! Interesting plot, excellent acting from all characters, great special effects all make for a fun filled ride!
B00AEFY3MC|5.0|Excellent entertainment, very funny. Never get tired of looking at this very funny film.<br />Recommend this movie for everyone and all ages.
B00C90T4QK|3.0|I don't know about anyone else but I want to hear some original music from Buble and not so many re-makes. It was ok. I had high hopes for this album.
B005XLN97M|5.0|I got this for my daughter for her birthday last December. She and her two year old sister will still play with it, which gives this toy more staying power than most toys in our house. Even though the house is plastic, it is sturdy enough that my two year old has not distroyed it. I also like that it is big enough for both girls to see into it and play without being so big that it takes up the whole play room.
B00BEPVAV8|2.0|It's ok. I think it can be better. I think people should get it. Don't listen to my opinion. It's not that bad.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|SInce purchasing this CD, and popping it into my CD player, I haven't stopped listening! Boz's gorgeous vocals, surrounded by master musicians....every song is a true masterpiece.  There are no \\"skippers\\". Trust me, people...you will not be disappointed. Boz continues to enchant ! :)

B004YW4L5K|5.0|There is too much truth to this novel. Beautifully written to reveal each point made in just the right way to hit home.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Awesome game very addicting hard to put it down once you start playing it. I would recommend this game for kids and adults
B00BHNR1KQ|4.0|My husband and I thought this was one of the better horror movies in recent years. Thought it would be hard to watch with some of the material in the preview, but it was done right.
0792846443|5.0|I enjoyed the movie. To anyone wanting to order a movie, I would highly recommend it. I will be ordering again soon.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|This movie was enjoyable.  We liked how It highlighted the bipolar condition and its issues while not making it too uncomfortable to watch.
B00CWV9FQA|4.0|This was a fun movie to watch on a lazy afternoon. It's not too long so the little ones won't get bores. And there are plenty of fun for adults.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This second book was as riveting as the first. In fact, more so because of the first one. I can hardly wait to see what happens in book three!
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I wish whole seasons didnt cost so much so i could buy a couple of seasons. If full seasons only cost $15 i would buy at least 2 seasons.
B00CO52NLI|1.0|This game cant get though on my kindle fire. It is always getting stuck on the trivial screen. I thought this game would be fun, but I can't find out myself if the game won't let me play it. Very disappointed.
B0031QVW2U|4.0|Provides a very snug fit for the strap.  Would have been nice if it were already included with the strap at that price, but I am happy with the purchase.
B004PGNB1K|5.0|I've loved the 1st one, but found the 2nd even better. It's just sad I have to wait for the next!<br />The writing is extremely pleasant, the story keeps you on your toes, the characters are simply all well thought and it makes you feel as if you were living in that same world.
8866135909|5.0|I was a naval officer, and one of my last assignments before leaving active duty was as operations officer aboard a guided-missile destroyer. For those who aren't familiar with that world, that meant I was the guy writing the plan for the ship, and making sure it was \\"deconflicted\\" across every department as well as every other ship in the area so nobody tripped over anyone else. I tried on a few different planners when I was learning my way around that job, and this is hands down the best one I found. The left side gave me the ability to list my appointments and meetings by day and time, and the right side gave me a place to list all the \\"taskers\\" that just needed to get done sometime before the week was out. That format worked extremely well for me, and the dignified exterior struck exactly the right aesthetic note a professional accessory needs to. The only thing I would change would be to double (or quadruple) the number of regular lined pages they put in the back of the book for notes, because I definitely needed more of those. I ended up keeping extra notepaper folded and tucked in the pocket after I'd burned through all of what there was, and that worked well enough, but more paper in the book itself would have been preferable.<br /><br />Overall, I was extremely happy with this product. I had many other resources for keeping the ship's schedule in order, but as something to carry around and pull out several times a day, this was the best tool I could have asked for.
B005SAYRA6|3.0|I payed an extra $1 for the HD extended version but there are parts that are pixilated and a part where the screen froze for 2 seconds and I don't see any extended parts in the movie I've seen it a couple of times and rented it for my husband to see before we watch the 6th fast & furious, but there are no extra or extended parts.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved it so so much. I will definitely be watching the movie and reading the other two books in the trilogy....
B005LAIIJY|5.0|Very enjoyable, and I have viewed it many times. It was funny and also serious. I was satisfied with the ending.
B005JTAP4S|4.0|I was given an advance copy by the author in exchange for an honest review. \\"Peter: A Darkened Fairytale\\" is a magical story about a young boy who is transported to an alternate world on his tenth birthday. He meets Hally the lifelongian, Arnica the maiden, Wind Sail the white witch and a beautiful elf called Slip. There is a quest motif and an imaginative journey that every child will enjoy. It reminded me of `The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe' and, to a lesser extent, a darker version of the Alice books by Lewis Carroll.
B00BAYLQI0|5.0|It was interesting. I now know more about sunamis and the destruction they cause. I wondered why there was not a warning of the coming disaster.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|this has never been updated. And that means they will not be able to run on any device running Android 4.0 or above.
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|At the beginning Matt was faced with serious problems regarding his family. With the help of his daughters his problems lessened. The blanket that covered his wife in the hospital was used in the last scene as the three watched TV and ate snacks. I felt this was symbolic of the closeness that developed by the passing of the wife and mother.
B002BWP49C|5.0|This movie was no disappointment and definitely lead to the final chapter of an awesome series.  I have the whole series now and would love to find the time to go all the way through them.  The author did an amazing job!  Sorry to know they are done now, as far as I know!
B00BQI4AU6|4.0|I'd go 4 1/2 if possible.  Totally dig this album and I'm glad it is seeing the light of day.  One can certainly hear the influences of the blues and late 60s/early 70s Stones and event some country influences.  Let's hope there's more coming in the future!
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|Robert B. Parker writes an excellent series of Jesse Stone as the little town police chief.  I love this series!

B000OVLBFS|5.0|Robert B. Parker has written an excellent series and made it a top hit with Tom Selleck as the main character.  A win-win situation for sure!!!
B00AM0C6YG|3.0|I purchase this album after listening to a feature on Laura Mvula on NPR.  I've only listened to the album twice, so there's a good chance her album could grow on me.  As of now, I find Sing to the Moon oddly disturbing.  Laura has a very nice voice, and some of the tracks are quite listenable. Other tracks make me think I have discovered a long-lost album from the 1960s. Not the psychedelic 60s, the Henry Mancini 60's. Heavily orchestrated, and sounding dated. I thought she needed to choose her material more carefully, and then realized that she either wrote, or co-wrote all of the songs. She is also credited with the arrangements. Maybe she was going for a retro sound, but the overall effect for me is one of superficiality.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Cut the Rope sgaa will bring you hours and hours of goo entretaiment !!!, it is a very very good choice for your android game collection!!
B0057URWSQ|4.0|I had never watched this show on USA. It looked like it was cotton candy TV. When it started on here I decided to give it 30 minutes of my time. I was pleasantly surprised. The characters are likable and you end up rooting for them. Now I am watching one episode after the other.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I choose to read this book when I saw that it had been written by Khaled Husseini.  I so enjoyed the Kite Runner!  I loved it so much as I did this book!
B00992CF6W|4.0|Sup guys, this is raven here this games is pretty good you can make pretty much anything, it's really credit right now but they have the updates comming so it should be so much better!
B000O8OTNC|3.0|This sharpener is compact and might be good as a kids knife sharpener. I would not recommend for good hunting style knives, but it worked well on general purpose knives like my Leatherman's.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Wheat Belly is a must read for everyone's health.  It is a tad technical, but those parts can be skimmed.  The author demonstrates that wheat is one of the causes of a long list of diseases, including cancer, diabetes and myriad aging diseases.  The evidence is too clear to ignore.  The author has done all of us a service with his insigts.  I, for one, intend to follow his advice to the best of my ability.  Don't miss this book.
B00005JM4Z|4.0|This wasn't bad. It's true to the type of movie it's meant to be: fast cars, hot women, Paul Walker. It was decent enough and kept true to the storyline of #1, at least in my opinion.<br /><br />Shipping was great, packaging is great, everything that way was great.
B00COGY2P2|3.0|It's ok. I expect more from a Tom Cruise movie. I would only recommend if nothing else is on. DVD only.
B0053FANRC|2.0|Tokyo Drift, for me, was completely pointless. Yes, the movie was okay. Yes, the cars were fast. Yes, the women were scantily clad. But the characters were different and I don't understand where this fits on the timeline. Having seen all six movies (#6 just came out this past weekend), I'm really upset with the timeline. Everything is all messed up and Tokyo Drift is at the heart of this disaster. I never really liked the movie anyways, and I ended up not watching #4 or #5 until just before going to the theater to see #6 because Tokyo Drift really annoyed me.
B00006LFGD|5.0|Love Barbara and have many of her songs. Tone is great and I could listen to them over and over and then listen again.
B00005R87Q|5.0|This movie has always been a favorite. I liked the team dynamics and characters. I liked that the &#34;heroes&#34; of the movie weren't so clean and white - they have records and pasts. I liked that our main hero (Paul Walker) didn't really get the girl in the end. I really liked that strong female characters here.<br /><br />Packaging and shipping were great - no problems there.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I have to say that this book was so much fun to read, especially from the guy's POV.  I just loved it..... loved the story line, loved the characters, everything!!!!  It's LOL funny and you MUST READ!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|AND THE MOUNTAINS ECHOED is the third novel by Afghan-American writer Khalid Hosseini, a rich, detailed incredible book about the bonds between family, set during the years between 1949 and the present. Each chapter is told in a different style by a different family member, with some stories by outsiders. Each story adds to the completion of the family narrative while standing out as its' own story. At the heart of the novel is the separation in 1952 of 10-year-old Abdullah and his three-year-old sister Pari, and the journey of their families over the next sixty years. With locations ranging from Kabul, Afghanistan to Greece, Paris and Northern California, the novel is rich with detail, dialogue and characterizations. Much like his debut novel, THE KITE RUNNER, Hosseini has distressing, traumatic moments that haunt the characters and influence later decisions and motivations. Seemingly unimportant stories echo back later. Some of the chapters are first-person, most third-person with an incredibly comprehensive epistolary chapter that could easily stand alone. Hosseini has done well to limit this story to 400-pages; it could easily double that, but his economical story telling is descriptive and detailed and misses nothing.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|As a watcher of all things Sherlock Holmes I thoroughly enjoyed this season.  I have seen the British version of Sherlock, and after watching this season through I am convinced this version has the upper hand.  Wonderful acting and wonderful writing.
B00428CPUY|5.0|Not quite as good as the 2007 but still great artists.  These are collectors items already.  When the 2013 Crossroads comes out I'll be buying.
B00CRW2066|1.0|Such a boring record. I know everyone loves The National, and I got sucked in after reading some glowing reviews. I catch one of their older tracks every now and then on shuffle, and figured it was worth trying this out. Since I'd never listened to their records start-to-finish, I thought there would be no better way to experience this new record garnering such glowing reviews.<br /><br />WRONG. I listened to it twice, back to back, just to be sure. This is like elevator music. Nothing about it stands out or even broke through my work-fog. Totally forgettable, totally boring.
0345803485|2.0|I tried... I really did.  \\"You shouldn't bash a book until you've read it.\\" Well I read it, most of it (and I won't bash it but I won't be suggesting it either).  Turns out everyone had a pretty accurate description of the book.  Except no one told me it would suck me in with a love story.  I enjoyed the first 7 chapters (super funny) but oh my goodness after that I was skipping more pages than reading so I stopped.  I looked up the synopsis and looks like there really isn't a story after that so... I'm glad I didn't keep reading.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Just couldn't wait to find out what happens in this third part of the Clifton/Barrington saga . . . I was not disappointed as I read on.  Anyone who followed the story from the beginning would have been enthralled.<br /><br />However, as I read on my Kindle, I kept tapping the screen thinking my Kindle was stuck . . . hoping the author hurries up and &#34;quenches&#34; my anticipation.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wow. Where to start.  First off.....This is my favorite book. I'm not even sure what to say. It was so different from anything I've read.  I could hand this book to anyone and know they were enjoy it. I became attached to characters over and over again. I loved the visual picture created. The detail. The world.  Such a lively full world and yet it is pretty much in a box. Amazing.  I can understand why this book has done so well. I know that I will be spreading good praises and buying it for people. Fantastic. Thank you Hugh for the adventure.<br /><br />p.s. the best part of the book was how well the characters were developed. I felt like each character young, old, male, female, down deep or up top were really portrayed accurately.  They were so real! Marnes and Jahns made me smile. They had the most adorable, believable interaction.  I felt like everything was paced so naturally but never left me bored. Love love love
034580404X|4.0|Once you get over the sex which was well written and explained.  I found that I real real liked the story.  Christian's was always respectful of Anna and real cared about her without either one playing games.  My only compliant is that all of the Charaters in the story are beautiful and all the males in love or lust with Anna.  She could have been beautiful  24 or 25 year old virgin and not (again) a delicate almost petite beauty that men are attracted to and want to protect.  Women that are tall or average in height and strong enjoy men that are strong take charge types to.
B00C061I3K|1.0|This is just all bad.  It sounds like they took their song Revolution 909, slowed it down to a disco 70's crawl, then split it up into 13 painful tracks.  Oh how the mighty have fallen.  I hope they come back with an album that is a polar opposite to this one.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This lasted way longer than most games of this type which I liked very much.  Highly recommended.  It's very addicting.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was my first book by Colleen Hoover.<br /><br />I have read more books then I can count and Hopeless is by far one of the best books I have ever read.  From the moment I read the first page I knew I wouldn't be able to put it down. I fell in love with Sky the moment she was introduced. She was an amazing girl and I love watching her life unfold. My heart broke for her and tines when she wouldn't allow herself to cry. I cried for her. She was such a strong female considering what hand she was dealt in life.<br /><br />Don't get me started on Holder. That is one perfect guy in all they ways being perfect matters. He was there from the very beginning and I was so proud at is level of compassion towards Sky. He knew that she needed him even when she didn't say it. And he was there. Throughout the entire book.<br /><br />Neither one of them believed in fairytale endings but them finally being together after everything that happened in both of their lives was a fairytale ending in its self.<br /><br />I will continue to read more books by Colleen Hoover. She is an amazing author and I loved this book.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Obviously these books are filled with smut, but I still found them to be a great read. There's words or phrases that could have been done differently for sure, but overall they are good books. The third is the best in my opinion, a lot more suspense and thrill in it than the other two.<br />I would read it again.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Very readable and enjoyable.  The inclusion of the interface between Lincoln and his cabinet was masterful and even more interesting when compared to today's political negotiations.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|My brother enjoyed reading this and I did to. This book is good if you like funny stories and this book gets you attached to it like you are watching things happen at that time. I would share this book with others because I think I think this is a good book.
B007R41E8O|4.0|Good adventure game with a good story line.<br /><br />Good hog with little of the black on black issues which plague some.<br /><br />Very good length for the price.<br /><br />But the game frequently resets in the middle of puzzles causing you to have to redo them over.<br /><br />I am running on an Android smartphone.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Great story describing the inner workings of Westeros and Mereen, as well as several other places and concerned characters.  I only hope that the next installment is not another four years in the making.  &#34;Winter is coming.&#34;
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Soooo many laughs!  Had to highlight parts that I can reread and laugh again and again.  Tina's wry observations really made me giggle.
B003ZDO90G|3.0|Although I found some of these stories extremely powerful and gritty, there were others that I found less interesting. However, there is no doubt Munro remains one of the world's great short story writers.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|3D very cool. Worth it. Couldn't wait to get it used. Highly recommended. Bring on 3D version of Lord of the RIngs!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Love this book. I would recommend this book to anyone I've read it at least 4 times! Best book ever.
B00COGY2P2|4.0|The story was OK, interesting plot.  I like Tom Cruise and he did a reasonable job.  Thought the female lead was week.
B0091TGWYE|4.0|Items ordered were as described by the seller to an extent. The case was too tight for my phone, I had a bit of trouble taking my phone out of the case. Furthermore, the items were received promptly. I would probably buy again from this seller.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This novel keeps the reader's attention from beginning to end.  Slavery, freedom, heartache, hardships, strength, weakness, good, and evil are all covered in the book.  Everyone in my book club loved it!
B003E8P9G0|5.0|My 11year old and I enjoyed reading this book together.  It had just the right amount is suspense to keep him interested in the next chapter.  A bit long but worth the effort.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|This book is amazing!  It is an eye-opener on the &#34;real&#34; North Korea.<br />Journalist Barbara Demick spent years researching families who had escaped from North Korea to South Korea.  Through her interviews, Demick pieces together the incredible struggles that ordinary people endured to survive in Communist North Korea.  The author covers three generations of North Korean leadership -- Kim Il-Sung, his son Kim Jong-Il, and his grandson (and present leader) Kim Jong-Un.<br />I would suggest this book to anyone who wants to understand other cultures of the world.  It weaves history and anthropology together in a cohesive, engaging, and educational story of survival.  You will not view headlines on North Korea the same after reading this book.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|I play this at least 4 or 5 times a day. Missions and Challenges are all splendid. So if ya love The Amazing Spider-Man for XBOX or PS3, You'll pretty much like this too.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|My boys LOVE Angry Birds and begged for Bad Piggies when it came out. I was reluctant to buy another one, but shouldn't have been. Bad Piggies involves building and problem solving and is very hard to put down! It's a great brain stretch disguised as a video game!
B004J8HX5E|4.0|book looked a bit used :/ with coffee smudges but its okay, the pages were still readable and no pages were missing.... still worth the 11$ I payed.
1582701709|5.0|This book was life changing for me!  Would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking to change any aspect of their life!
B0095P29EG|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Thor. He is my favorite Marvel superhero. The movie was a great action adventure film; the costumes, acting, and storyline I thought were all great. I also liked how there were little clues and subtleties that connected this movie with other Marvel superhero movies and &#34;The Advengers&#34;. I cannot wait for Thor 2!
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|wonderful album, very unique and not at all what I was expecting.  Sounds like your in a futuristic version of the 70's
B00785P2QC|4.0|very fun to play and a very good strategy game I had a lot of fun playing it not challenging either
B00BF11STU|3.0|I enjoyed this movie but it isn't one of those that will stick in my mind forever.  Did a good job in revealing our high and mighty hypocrisy on the issue of torture.  Or was that in another movie I saw????
B005HEQ4XQ|5.0|I enjoyed my free time watching this. Would highly recommend this to people who enjoy a good sci-fi television series
B00BI73CVI|4.0|I don't care for Musicals but this one was quite good.  It has a great dramatic storyline and the actors were fabulous.  Well done, indeed!
B0007MWZEK|1.0|BEFOR IT WAS SHIPPED OUT I CANCEED BOTH OF THE ORDERS I THOUGHT BUT ONE WAS SENT ANY WAY  I KEPT IT ONLY SO AS NOT TO HAVE TO PAY RETURE SHIPPING , I ALREADY HAVE FOUR OF THESE. THAT IS WHY I DO NOT NEED MORE!
B00ADS98FC|5.0|I've watched this movie four times in the week I've owned it. Love it, it's hilarious, and refreshingly not dirty.
B000SX9IXO|5.0|This is one of the greatest albums of all time. My original vinyl just got too painful to listen to.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Enough of a relaxing vs hard combo. Just what I need to mental break and regroup. Love it and ut really runs smooth on my kindle.
B0079R8KXG|2.0|I do not like this and sent it back for exchange. I like the micro type cover better. This seemed to bulky for me.
B007EECSFA|4.0|Through twists and turns and insight in to WWII England, Morton keeps you guessing and wanting to more as she takes you back to the terror of the blitz, and the current ache of a family losing their mother.  Just when you think you have things figured out, she shakes you up and takes you down another path. She keeps you from frustration by her descriptive texts and incredible empathy for real life pain and fear. . . . Fear of loss, fear of trust, fear of never getting what you think you want.  Well done.
B00000099Y|5.0|Every now and then a good band comes out with a great album that you can listen to ever and over without skipping one track. This is that album. From beginning to end, this is a great album. And the only one that doesn't have repetitive, droning bass and guitar riffs that annoy you more than please your ear. Check this album out, even if you aren't a TOOL fan!
B00669MFA2|5.0|Loved it. Really hope a new Harry potter emerges in the future. I Will start from the beginning again soon.
B00BVVA138|4.0|Jesse Leach, the original KsE frontman is back. Great news for OLD KsE fans. For KsE fans during the Howard Jones era, it depends on how you like the change from Howard back to Jesse and how it affects their music. When Jesse is at the front, the riffs are definitely harder-hitting, partially (in my opinion) due to Leach's vocal style and delivery. More screams. KsE when Jones was in front was a bit more melodic because (again, my opinion) of Jones' style and delivery. More singing than screaming. I like the music either way, but definitely more so with Jones at the front. The music just seems to harmonize better to me. All in all, a still-solid effort for KsE, just not my perfect cup of tea.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|Product was in Great Condition when recieved. This was a great movie to show in my reading class before Christmas Break!
B009POHHR6|4.0|Well if you are looking this comic up, then you probably already know what it is about. Superman is re-imagined as an alien that landed on the other side of the planet. So instead of Kansas, it was Soviet-era Russia. However, Supes still has that strong moral code that won't just let him blast America into oblivion. The story is definitely an interesting one, giving into other re-imaginings of other characters as well. The story as a whole was fantastic. The only thing I didn't quite appreciate was the ending. They kind of threw a dumb loop in there where they could have just left the entire story alone, however imaginative the &#34;naming&#34; of Kal-el is at the end. That is the only reason for the 4 stars. I wish they would have left it alone, but alas, they didn't.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Bittersweet but enjoyable. Haven't seen the movie so I can't compare. Overall I did enjoy it. Filling more space here.
0670026557|5.0|Excellent read! Great insights about reciprocity styles and why we are where we are in life, and who the other people in our lives are. Must read for those who wish to grow relationships.
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|I enjoyed the movie because it showed Schwarzenegger as an aging sheriff  who out wits this drug cartel's effort to pass through his border town to free their boss.  The movie has an Interesting cast of characters which fit the probable characters who would live in a small border town in Arizona.  Prototypically for Hollywood, this movie elevates a Mexican drug lord to this invincible man with unlimited resources to defeat federal and state police but gets defeated by a small town sheriff and his rag tag group of deputies.  As unbelievable as the movie is it is entertaining and worth the time to watch.
B008518MOW|5.0|I was skeptical about the whole home 3-d experience, but it was really fantastic, and i liked this movie anyways.
0762777931|5.0|I love Kris Carr and first learned of her at a Hay House conference in September 2012.  This book does not disappoint.  I love her  quick and sharp writing, she doesn't mince words but her sage advice  comes across  with a caring and compassionate voice.  She truly believes and follows her own advice.  You feel like you're sitting across the table from a girlfriend while reading this book.<br /><br />I have an autoimmune issue and originally picked up this book for that  reason.  With the addition of juicing and switching to a plant based diet my flare ups have virtually vanished and I feel better than I have in a long time - and I'm only 32!  It's really a fun book to read with lots of useful information.  Definitely worth picking up.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Rwow i really just like this game its super Mario fun man you should try it out because i made this game up you son of a man you  try it now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Love ,camila
B00CE03UOC|5.0|Thank you very much for the free flow games.  I downloaded just about all the Free Flow games.<br /><br />Again, thank you!
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Very little of human day to day life, or the relational world of the North Korean people, has been written about.  This was a powerful work of fiction based on the author's own research and haunting residual thoughts drawn from his senses following his trip to North Korea.  The author poignantly points out in a narrative in at the end, the common thread throughout the story, are the master writer(s) of three generations.  Brilliant work!  Absolutely deserving of The Pulitzer prize for Fiction!  Bravo!
B00CATSONE|5.0|This was an excellent read. The author keeps the book short and to the point, avoiding many of the extraneous details that tend to clutter up popular biographies of modern heroes. The work focuses solely on Tesla's scientific achievements rather than on his personal life, or his education. This is used not only to discuss the traits of what creates the great innovators of our times but, to point out that Thomas A. Edison was not the only scientist working on the development of electricity as a means of providing light and power to the common people. Overall this book deserves 5 stars. I would recommend this to any reader interested in the sciences or the inventions of the late 19th and 20th century but, this book seems specifically suited for middle and high school science classes.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|the person who received it was very happy and enjoyed listening to all the songs, brought back a lot of memories
B003TQKVGU|5.0|This book makes a great gift.  Joseph Murphy writes in a manner that is easy to understand<br />Each page seems as though it was written just for you.
B00785P2QC|4.0|it is ok I don't like that you Have to buy things or wait forever to get it like I am waiting so I have enough cards. plus some of your goals you have to have a facebook
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game so much I have it on every single one of my gaming devices  which is five devices
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Bought this gaming mouse after looking at a few others with the same features, and this one was by far the cheapest, which made me a little wary. However after a few weeks of use I am extremely impressed. This mouse is great for gaming with the extra buttons and speed, and is also completely customizable which love. If you're looking for an inexpensive gaming mouse, look no further.
B0010YPTGU|5.0|Andrea is superb. From the very beginning walking onto the stage with his two sons, you knew this was going to be special. He is totally relaxed, being in his hometown, in a theatre he created just for the people of Tuscany. And his guest list is phenomenal.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|took forever to download and when it was finished loading the game it kicks me off and it wouldn't tell me why
B009K0P10K|5.0|I have been a revenge fan since day 1.  I was moving so had to watch my missed episodes on my kindle.  I was so happy I did.
B00CFOGCAG|5.0|It's a good game and I really enjoy how I can still play while on the go that's a really important thing to me.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I thought this was the perfect way to end the series.  Sookie didn't belong with the vampires, she loved life too much and the vampires caused her 14 books worth of misery.  All she wanted out of life was to be loved and live in her small town in her little country house.  I guess others thought she should be turned and become queen of the vamps but I think Harris ended the series the way it needed to be ended and the way SHE wanted it to end.  I wished HBO hadn't screwed up the series cause it's totally off the wall.
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|Surprisingly enjoyable game. Straightforward point and click game, challenging but not nearly as hard as something from Alawar or other big games, so it would be great for a beginner. It's also longer than I expected - it's in three parts, so when you feel like it's about to be over too quickly, you actually have two more connected parts to go.
B00CW665VI|5.0|OMG!!!!!  What great story from a guys point of view..  I laughed throught the entire book..  l justed loved it :)
B009NY43NY|3.0|Needed a more closing ending to the sookie and Sam story, but overall pretty good. Don't like the Eric ending
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game ever at first I siding know what it was so I thought it was stupid I kept on playing and bought a app that let me cheat and I  had infinite life and had parties with zombies and thought it was the best game ever
B008YRVW0I|2.0|Liked playing the game but the aquarium building was pretty limited. Couldn't go further without purchasing so lost my interest.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is a great app. Lots. Of fun to play. Not very expensive to buy extras.  Meet a lot of fun people in chat from everywhere in the world.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I read the first one, because it was all everyone was talking about. It sucked. I was amazed at how big it was.... then people would say, \\"Oh they get better....\\" So I made it through the second, painfully. This one? I couldn't do it... I started it. I tried.... but it's too much \\"Mr. Grey this\\" and \\"Yes, Mrs. Grey that...\\"  Enough!
B007Q35PLI|5.0|I loved this movie, it is very inspiring to see a person with autism succeed in life. I truly recommend watching this film, it explains a lot of what people with autism go through.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I can't explain why, but I really enjoyed Night Circus. It was easy to get into, kept me intrigued and was nothing like I've ever read before.
B004HD61KE|5.0|Captivating, fascinating, thrilling, and many more adjectives! One of those novels that feels so real, then in the Afterword, you discover how many of the things touched upon ARE real! Within several \\"nanoseconds\\" (heh, heh, heh) I'll have another of Rollin's Sigma Force novels on my Kindle, ready to dive into!
B007ZD17XO|5.0|This game plays great on the Kindle Fire. I it has great music and graphics. This is one of the best jewel games out there. Especially considering the price.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I actually enjoyed this game. It really makes us think. However I would have liked to continue further into the game without having to pay for the full version. :/
B004Q3UL2O|5.0|I love that you can rent movies through Amazon now. Love & Other Drugs is sexy and sad. Great movie.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|Loved the concept of the movie but the implementation was a bit flaky.  I feel like all the different legs of the story were never tied together.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It helps me to study yhe bible. Its very handy and accessible. I enjoy the different versions of the bible and all its features are necessary for daily study of yhe binle.
B0011MZOEI|4.0|The movie was enjoyable and typical of the Die Hard series. It is a good escapist way to pass the time.
B001VM0LAK|1.0|This film is nothing but gratuitous violence and foul language.<br />I was shocked that actors of this caliber would do a movie like this.<br />Do not waste a minute of your time watching this movie.
159562015X|2.0|For me, this book serves as a jumping-off point for talking about personal strengths, but doesn't really offer anything more.  My survey results were way off the mark, and included a disclaimer that stated that the results weren't very strong.  (Glad I didn't pay for it.)<br /><br />Some sloppy thinking went into the book - in order to pad out the number of 'strengths', the authors seem to have shanghaied 'personality traits' as well.<br /><br />The writing style was oddly familiar, until I realized that it's the same vague sort of sentences you find in horoscopes and fortune cookies.  Go to a bookstore, pick up the book, and turn to any page in the last half and read a few statements without looking at the 'strength' described.  Sounds just like you, doesn't it?  Why, yes, I 'have core values'!  And I'm 'inquisitive'!  Balance, relationships, and a sense of humor ARE important to me!  (At least you get a snack with the fortune cookie).<br /><br />I also read Gallup's white paper describing their methodologies, and they state that these have never been tested using a placebo control...so there's no way of knowing whether using their metrics are helpful, or merely giving added attention to employees and managers provided a bump.  (In addition, I'm suspicious that their white paper does not mention anything about how Gallup handled any sort of testing bias.)<br /><br />There's one good idea at the core of this - that we should give as much attention to strengths as to weaknesses.  Everything else is just padding.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very fun game I play it all the time with my friends I have always loved horse's but I have no time for a real one so this is a good game if you want a virtual pet or you just want to have fun.
B00CRWJ7VC|4.0|While I thought I made a mistake at first,  the longer I watched the better I liked the movie.  In the end,  I am glad I rented it.  Hard to follow yes,  not sure if there was some &#34;message&#34; but liked it never the less.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It is so rare to read a book that has it all: A great story to tell, great characters that actually change and grow (sometimes more slowly than seems tolerable), realistic dialogue, quality writing, and something I call unputdownability.<br /><br />Collins grows her characters slowly through three books--an incredible feat of restraint--and keeps us guessing what will happen and who will survive right up to the end.<br /><br />A real masterwork of literary craftsmanship.
B00992CF6W|4.0|My 8 year old Daughter Loves it! She plays a little everyday its great that the Kindle Fire allows you to limit the time played or she would play for hours.
B001GMQE7E|5.0|I simply love Ludovico's piano music. It touches me in deep places, and I enjoy dancing to it. I have a few albums and enjoy them all.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|One of Tom's better movies.  A good action flic and it may keep you guessing to the end.  I would watch it again
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I have about 48-55 of each prize and over 86th coins but only 2 dozed dollars! All the puzzle pieces are done but cant get more!
B0061S073A|4.0|this helps to control your children's time on the device and limits access to things that need to be restricted like accidentally purchasing items or accessing adult content
B0095P33IW|4.0|Aside from the weak ending, I liked this adaptation and integration into the Marvel movie universe.  It has it's share of stupid bits, but so few movies these days don't.
B003QSMC18|5.0|Took my 4yr old granddaughter to see Disney On Ice just recently and this was a featured tale in the production. so when we watched the tale on my kindle  her eyes lit up.
B003Y3AZSW|5.0|I bought this because I wanted a compact set of chopping boards.  This not only looks great, they are solid and durable and are worth,  in my opinion, the extra money.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Outstanding portrayal of the last few months of this president. My husband and I were not disappointed. It had untold insight of the struggle that our country faced both blacks and whites and the deals and dirty business of politics that take place to bring about change both good and bad on both sides of the isle.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Okay I am a late bloomer when it comes to Rod Stewart. I didn't start to like him until about 15  years ago.  But  I saw his performances 3  different times times in Las Vegas, so I guess that makes me a fan.  I enjoy this  CD  &#34;TIME&#34;-- very upbeat.  SHE MAKES ME HAPPY, BEAUTIFUL MORNING,  TIME, BRIGHTON BEACH, stand out as my favorites. If you are a Rod Stewart fan, buy this CD..but then if you are a fan, you probably already did buy it.
B008XBHIEY|5.0|I am familiar with this movie when it first came out many years ago and now I have a 8yr grandson who loves sharks. He was thrilled with this movie even though by today's standards it lacks the high tech special effects that make movie more realistic. Yet it was no so gruesome that it scared him to death.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|It's admittedly hard to follow Kite Runner or A Thousand Splendid Suns.  By any other standard, And The Mountains Echoed would be an excellent work of fiction.  But, for a Hosseini fan who has eagerly anticipated this work for six years, it just didn't measure up to the others.  I was engrossed from the beginning, and I love how Hosseini skillfully tells the story using the voices of the different characters.  Only as you make your way through the book do you discover how all the characters are connected, causing it to read like a suspense-novel at times.  My biggest complaint about the book is that Hosseini seems to attempt too much - there are too many characters, too many connections, too many sub-plots.  The end effect is that the central story line - that of a brother and his lost sister is watered down in the process.
B008Q00BOQ|4.0|it's a typical man's action macho movie love watching it with my macho man lots of male fighting and explosiions
B009HUB40Y|5.0|Love playing this with the volume up. Everything bouncing around and making noise and the faster I go the more fun it is.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|its nice to see a movie that has a great story line. the way they all come together to save all worlds is cool :)
B007HUD6OS|5.0|Great story as usual, love all the John Grisham books, have them all, mostly hard cover and read them all
B004WR125O|5.0|I simply plugged this Wireless Adapter into the slot on rear of my receiver and followed the easy set up instructions on screen and connected it to my wireless network (home installation-not work) and it has been flawless.
B00BQ1D7X4|4.0|this is another solid offer from AIC that pales slightly in comparison to its predecessor, Black Gives Way To Blue. I'm not gonna attempt to compare this to classics like Facelift or Dirt, because those albums were from a different time and from a different incarnation of the band. In contrast to BGWTB, this new release is a little more plodding and mid-paced ; it still rocks though. The midsection of the album is a bit lighter and gives more breathing space to the instrumentation. I was pleasantly surprised by BGWTB and it made me eager to hear the next album by AIC. Now that I've heard TDPDH, I can honestly say that I enjoy it and it's a good rock album; unfortunately, it may be the least memorable of their discography.
014242613X|5.0|My grandson and I read this book as his reading assignment for every night.  He loved the book and I loved it also.  It is John Grisham quality and I ended up ordering the other two books in this series.  Good story and some very funny parts that we both enjoyed.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I have seen all the episodes, bought the DVDs for my mother. Looking forward to next season. Don't want to give any spoilers but Maggie Smith is great.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I read this is a matter of hours, and it was amazing. I could not put it down. It was definitely a tearjerker. I read it in an airport too, so I got quite a few stares. Hazel is such a relatable character and so determined. Her relationship with Augustus was beautiful to read about, I could feel their love. The book was amazing, and I am very glad it did not end like Hazel's favorite book, An Imperial Affliction. The book definitely deserved a five out of five.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I have seen all the episodes, bought the DVDs for my mother. Looking forward to next season. Don't want to give any spoilers but Maggie Smith is great.
B009GIPDQS|2.0|Week plot easy to predict what would happen next,fanciful and boring, written to sell on reputation not worth the cost paid
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|Could be me but Argo was not as gripping as I expected. Thought that John Goodman and Alan Arkin were perfect for their roles.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|always looking for something to  do while traveling, and get bored just reading all the time.  I'm enjoying this game.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|This is a challenge.  Fun game that will really make you think.  Great game as a free App for Kindle.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|I love this movie but when it is shown on TV it comes on to late and it is filled with commercials.  this I can just pop into my dvd player and watch at my convenience with out commercials.
B0049VZ222|5.0|Watching the first episode is all it takes to become a fan! I love The Walking Dead! Can't wait to see what happens next!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This app is great, at first I thought it looked stupid, but my friend insisted it to me. So I got it. Now, I check it every hour or even every 25 minutes. I get so excited to get a rare Dragon or at least a Dragon that was very useful. I could keep going on but I'd run out of room. Please get this game.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I am still only half way through it,  this is the sort of book I can get my teeth into, its got everything.  Story telling at its best. Real people doing really human things,  simply powerful!<br /><br />thank you
B004YW4L5K|3.0|The book was a fun read, but does not leave you with that feeling of post-epic hangover that you might expect for the subject matter, length, and talent of the writer. The story seems to be constantly building, and the crescendo is somewhat of a letdown.<br /><br />The commentary the book makes on society, deities, etc. is compelling, but I found that I was never that interested in what would ultimately happen to the book's anti-hero Shadow (or any of the other characters for that matter).<br /><br />Worth reading: Sure, if you have the spare time to plow through almost 600 pages, and nothing else on the \\"To Read\\" list.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I think you'll find this book is an easy read by an educated man that had an amazing experience.  He brings you to and through that part of his life like a seasoned author. I think you'll enjoy it!
B00CW665VI|5.0|I don't normally leave review but i had to do it for this book. In fact is the first one i've done so you can imagine how good it was. I swear my face hurts from smiling so much throughout the whole book. I seriously love Drew Evans in every way possible. I have to say Emma Chase you are THE BEST.
B00A8ZZ2Z0|5.0|Very good city is playing in my car stereo since day one i buy it cant wait to see them live
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|it's kind of a cross between Galaga and Warning Forever with the art style of Geometry Wars, very fun and addicting
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Basic calculator with large keys. Great for balancing your checkbook and doing basic calculating. Easy to use. Would.recommend to everyone.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|As someone who always struggled with math, I love that a calculator like this now exists.  Even if you work out the problem by yourself on paper first, this is a great way to double check yourself.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|Finished watching this a few nights ago. Not many movies out there really going for the playing of the mind like this one and it makes you terribly scared of medication.
B004P4S4NM|5.0|Adele has a great voice as we all know by now, and the things she sings about, and the feeling she puts into her songs--this is really a great album that deserves all the accolades its been getting.
B00COO2D6O|4.0|like this game. worth the wait. only wish you didnt have to redo upgrade each time. like the new planes. i
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|Another winner from Aardman Studios.  Only wish there were more to watch, but creating this kind of animation is very long process and we have to be happy with what they can do.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Reacher could have solved this story in the first chapter if he wanted to, but he didn't.  It took too long to get to the meat of the story, in my opinion.  It was a good read but not one of his best.
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|I want to start off saying that I haven't read the novel. But after watching the movie it makes me want to read it. This was a very cute movie. Even though it lacked certain parts. Also, I have very experienced a movie that was EXACTLY like the book (ex. Twilight, Hunger Games), so I hardly ever expect it anymore. So overall It was a cute movie and it deserves 4 stars
B004HW7JH4|5.0|I do wish Don would get some therapy but this the 60's and men did not do therapy.  After all, real men solve their own problems in there own way, like screwing as many women as possible for no apparent reason.  Add addiction to booze and cigs and you have a complete trifecta.  I am getting tired of his macho attitude but what would the series do without his disfunction?
B000GT6L9Y|4.0|This is a great movie.  Kids love it and watch it over and over and over!  I recommend it for family night.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|This game epic is all fun and games . I would recommend this game to anyone that has an adventurous mind or someone that is looking to just have some fun in there life.
B0094LZY2A|5.0|This is a great family movie.  Even my 18 month old watches it.  I love Robin Williams.  He is a great actor.
B000J10ER4|1.0|This DVD does not work!  I have tried to play it in 2 different DVD players and will not work in either one!  I need to return it!
B0057LUI0O|5.0|It is such a cute movie.  Not sure if it is because we are from MN but the music is catchy and catches the kid's attention.
B000IJ79WU|1.0|It doesn't work...I have tried to play it in 2 different DVD players and it won't play!  I need to sent it back!
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|First time I've played a matching game like this, really enjoyed it. Easy enough so I can finish it and free the poor guy.
B000059Z8J|5.0|I purchased this DVD along with II and Superman returns.  This is the only one out of the 3 that will play.  I will need to return the other 2 and either get new ones or get my money back!
B006M4F67A|4.0|I enjoy playing mahjong. This game has nice graphics and it is a standard mahjong game, nothing more to say.
B005H9B44A|5.0|AWESOME MOVIE!!! Plenty of action and witty humor. I would recommend this movie for anyone who loves action with witty humor
B003U69IX6|1.0|Both of my kids have a Kindle HD Fire.  This past weekend, we were going out of town & wanted the kids to both have a video to watch.  They each chose a rental from Amazon.  Because we would be driving and have no access to wifi, we wanted the videos to be downloaded to their devices so they could watch during the 4 hour drive.  My daughter's video (Lemony Snicket) downloaded with no problems.  My son's (Percy Jackson) never fully downloaded, and then it expired before the 48 hour rental period was even up.  I would appreciate a refund for his rental.
B0058SNNOE|5.0|i wanted something comfortable for my daughter and stylish so i purchased a pair of crocs for her, and the fit was great she loves her shoes and wears them all the time
B00B2166BS|5.0|The fact that the Nexus 10 has the pogo pins but did not comes with the Pogo cable is baffling! Like I said, should've come standard with the Nexus 10. Now I can use my Micro-USB port for my OTG cable!! I have zero issues with it. Worth every penny. Had to wait quite a bit though to get it to Singapore.
034580404X|5.0|When I started Reading the books, I couldn't stop Reading. It's a beautiful love story that any women would love.
141694737X|5.0|My toddler received this book as a gift for her first birthday. It is her new absolute favorite.  I would highly recommend it!!
B006WAIV6M|5.0|Tremendous impact...often the reality might be in front of us, and we would not notice. This author presents a rare perspective of why habits take hold of us, and there is no mistaking the painstaking research which has gone into this. Helped me cultivate new habits and let go of bad habits in a snap
0345529057|5.0|Saw this exact same set selling at Barnes and Noble, but it was about a dollar cheaper here. Got free shipping because I needed to order other items, so it was even a better bargain!<br /><br />Books arrived in great condition. Books feel good in the hands and pages are pretty substantial to flip through. I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in reading the series. The fifth book isn't in this set, but since that's currently selling for about $14 by itself (almost as much as this whole set!), I'll probably wait until it is cheaper to buy.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I can't open the games I play. maybe too much to load. but ok for seeing if I have any messages.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|this book is like riding the tide from one wave to another and another and .........interesting review of the last 100 years,<br />laugh out loud funny in places, this is the first book i haven't wanted to put down in years - loved it
B008M721MS|3.0|It shuts off the video or picture after a few minutes. The sound ok. but can't see others??? That is what I wanted, so not to good...
B003H6KRIE|5.0|This was one of those movie trilogies that I wanted to have in our rack. After watching again, I've picked up on things I'd originally missed.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|Not the greatest game in the universe of a toddler or 3 or 4 year old.<br />They have more fun games and venues available to them.Dont play
B008J34466|5.0|He loves her music even at the young age of 65! He plays it on long trips and listens to it with my 13 year old grandson. Grandson was amazed an &#34;older&#34; person would like Pink....we like to consider ourselves ageless! You will like the album, Pink is more than just a pop artist.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|If you are a fan of fantasy you'll be swept away by this whole series.  Cassandra Clare has a flair and a unique style, and even though these are in the YA section at my local stores, I'd recommend them to any lover of fantasy fiction as they are beautifully written and never dull.
B007TB5WE2|4.0|Fascinating and engaging account of what might have been one of the last days of the British colonial life and its murky people and their intrigues
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I  think this game is great its fun for the whole family and the little ones can learn about the different animals
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is a lot of fun.  Twisting and turning the cube like a Rubix cube.  Not real challenging but a lot of fun.
B00BGIC4I6|4.0|I enjoy Judd Apatow movies (most of them, anyway), and I love the actors in this film, so it wasn't a stretch that I would like This is 40. Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann are likeable and funny. Albert Brooks and John Lithgow are welcomed additions as their fathers. Melissa McCarthy an the easy in-and-out comedic moment. That's just the actors I was happy to see.<br /><br />The story - and there is one, if you're of the Seinfeld generation - it one that will be familiar to the Gen X crowd. We're older now, with mortgages, careers, and children, but we don't feel any more adult than we did at age 20. We don't know what the hell we're doing sometimes. One day, we were partying to Pearl Jam, the next we're hiding the cupcakes we're eating so our spouses don't give us hell about our cholesterol. That's it; that's the story.
B00127RAJY|5.0|LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT.... JUST WHEN YOU THINK YOU'VE MASTERED THE LEVEL AND THEN YOU MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ONE... WOW AND JUST WHEN YOU THINK YOU CAN'T HANSLE ANY MORE THE WORKOUT IS OVER...LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT
0316227706|5.0|Ever wonder what the pooch diving for that ball looks like from the balls perspective?  This book shows that intensive look and wild eye stare.  I don't even have dogs but purchased two of these books as presents.
B00CDXOPYE|5.0|I can't say too much about this movie or I'll give everything away. Quick watch it before somebody tells you how it ends. Very good chick flick but the guys will like it too.
B00CL68QVQ|1.0|There wasn't one likeable character in the entire movie. I honestly don't understand all the admiration for this boring movie. I'm only glad I didn't pay $10 bucks to see it at the theater.
B009CGR0LA|2.0|Weird weird weird, that's all I can say. Wasn't my cup of tea (or any other beverage for that matter).
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Enjoyable read from start to end. Worth the time taken to read this book and can be enjoyed by all.
B00CFQN12Q|2.0|Sequel aren't always the best and I think this one proves that Die Hard may be Dying Hard. I'd rate this somewhere near Rocky  XXXVI if they had made that many. Plot is very strange and I'm not sure I understood it completely. Having said that if you like to watch shet blow up then this is the move for you.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I really liked this book.  I read it cover to cover.  It is a complete story - YAY!!!<br /><br />Drew was hilarious if you like male thinking.  I actually felt that was spot on.  It in some ways reminded me of the book I hope they serve beer in hell by Tucker Max.<br />Drew was a bit like the refined version of Tucker.  Drew uses bad language, I can not say he uses women because like he says in the book - (paraphrase) if you are gonna give it up within an hour of meeting a guy, you are not in it for a relationship just for a night.<br /><br />Kate was amazing, she was strong and smart.  She did not take his crap.  They were perfect together.  Kate actually makes Drew a better person.<br /><br />I will definitely be looking for other books from this author.  I love someone who can sound like a guy when they write. This book actually made me laugh out loud, that does not happen very often.  Great read.<br /><br />If you can not handle the F Bomb, skip it, or if you don't really want to know the way guys think, because lets face it they can be offensive. :)<br /><br />If that does not bug you - go for it, so worth it.
B002HSSAY6|4.0|Not like any other movie I've ever seen. EVERY scene is a Norman Rockwell Painting. This much attention to detail will probably never be repeated in any other movie.
B00CDSVZHY|3.0|Just what you would expect from a Tarantino movie, but unfortunately too much of an attempted social statement as well. And please don't have Tarantino provide cameo appearances any longer in his movies.
B0026QC0YU|4.0|This is just a stepping stone for the M.I. franchise. The films,sequels, just keep getting better. In my opinion at least.
055321263X|5.0|Like so many other reviewers, I had never heard of Wilkie Collins until I got my Kindle and it was on the \\"free\\" list. A truly engrossing and amazing book, surprisingly modern despite its being written in the late 1850s. The text is quaint, but what I mean by modern is it's subtle humor set against the mystery, such as in the character of the uncle Mr. Fairlie. I found myself laughing out loud in some places. Wilkie Collins has carefully fleshed out all the characters with depth and believability. The only stereotypical character is that of Sir Percival Glyde as one of the antagonists- a charismatic individual who is, of course, hiding his true nefarious self. It is an engrossing mystery that was very difficult to put down-I read it while eating, instead of watching TV and into the late hours of the night. I could not wait to find out what the SECRET was! At times I would think I had figured it out, only to be thrown off again. Written in the first person by several of the characters-in the form of biography, journals and depositions, gives the book its depth. Wilkie Collins, in real life, was sympathetic and passionate about the lack of women's rights in the nineteenth century and he uses this book to illustrate some of the injustices afforded on women. Since this was first written in serial form, it must have been torture for his readers to wait for the next issue to be published! I highly recommend this work, even to those who don't particularly care for 19th-century novels or mysteries.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is lots of fun.It is a good game for kids, teens, and parents. It has great graphics and game-play.
B00BHU261S|4.0|Great acting, good mix of drama and humor.  Describes the complex relationship with Hitch and his wife...and made me want to watch Psycho.
B005U9QJY2|2.0|I'd recently re-watched movies I'd grown up with like \\"Labyrinth,\\" \\"Return to Oz\\" and \\"The Neverending Story\\", all of which seemed to hold up. But for some reason, this one just didn't speak to me. I think my expectations were a bit too high.<br /><br />On the plus side, I do appreciate the craft of creating a whole world with puppets.
B0091REZMW|5.0|this keeps me busy and gives me something fun to do. I really like it. it requires. a lot of visual coordination
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|...Kim Jee Won, the director, asks for a lot of suspended belief. There are many excellent stunts, which is to be expected I reckon with Johnny Knoxville on board, but the gun battles remind me of the ones I saw as a kid on TV's The A-Team. You know the ones, with people standing out in the open, firing automatic weapons at one another....and largely missing. Cars being blown up right next to people....and they survive. Arnie...poor old aged Arnie, getting veins slashed, getting shot, getting stabbed ---and still fighting like he did in the Commando. Really?<br /><br />The sad thing is this movie has a good cast. Forest Whitaker is a great actor, but in this, his talent is squelched to the ninth degree. Luis Guzman is also a seasoned actor who's real talent is not evident here. It all comes off like a TV action show with a few blood and gut shots thrown in to make it feel like a movie.<br /><br />And then the cars?  What?  Come ON!  I can take you back to the 1970's and THE FRENCH CONNECTION and you will see a far better, more exciting car chase sequence than in this movie. That is sad.<br /><br />Apparently, this was just an advertisement for Chevy --I reckon Obama Motors needs the publicity since The Volt is pretty much SUNK!<br /><br />As far as Arnie goes, please, get out while you are somewhat ahead. You destroyed CALI-FOR-NI-YUH....and now this???<br /><br />Let this be, indeed, your LAST STAND!
B006PTNQGU|5.0|This is a classic Macaulay Culkin film, are you kidding! I love living vicariously through the fantasy rich and it streams for free with Amazon Prime
B0087IT8FK|5.0|A group of 17 ladies joined me for a 'girls night in' to watch this movie and we just laughed and laughed. I really enjoyed the cheeky humour.
0679805273|5.0|There are so many people out there who have read Dr. Seuss books, as there all unique and he stood out from any other, as this book and others that I have read, ones that are not famous have really changed the way kids imagination. You put craziness with brilliant and you get this book, I have read it so many times and enjoy it to read with my younger family.
B007AL48UK|4.0|I give Summer Mahjong a 4 star rating because I think it is entertaining and relaxing.  Not so much pressure since you are only competing against your own time.  You can play the same segment over and over again and it always seems different.
B0034G4P7Q|4.0|Pros<br />great movie<br />1080p<br />tons of bonus features<br /><br />cons<br />the case feels very flimsy and is easily damaged<br />weird sleeve instead of a standard case
B00BWJARHO|4.0|Although a bit too long and with scenes that really didn't seem to fit the overall storyline, I liked the new characters and am interested in seeing how they take back their homeland.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|This story is so fabulous but very depressing... I was hoping for a happy ending but it just didn't really get happier and it kind of ended abruptly. Loved it though!
B00BETX5PS|3.0|Watched this movie because it had good a good rating but was disappointed. The story was choppy - no fluidity even if the plot was suppose to be a about a central theme. And I felt like the action scenes were placed there to call the movie an action movie, but it did not really show relevance.<br />To be direct, this movie is like listening to a grand orchestra play without its conductor.<br />The theme song, on the other hand, is one of the best ever. And Daniel Craig is a good actor, too. He deserves more than this poorly conceptualized project.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Wonderful story line that makes you consider your ancestry.  The scenery and characters become so real.  You don't want it to end, yet you can't put it down.  Can't wait to read more books by Kate Morton.
B001L5YW9I|5.0|One of my favorite movies.  I love everything about it including the music. Scenery in the movie is breathtaking. There is quite a lot of blood shed in this movie so I would not recommend for young children.
B0047SF41G|4.0|Many of the other reviewers have captured the gist of the story line and most have referenced the obvious flashback to the original as this instalment returns to the jungle. I don't have anything bad to say about the acting. I felt the cast all worked well together and enjoyed the plot. They could have built more into the use of additional alien creatures but they chose not to. They could have built more on the internal predator war but they chose not to. There were a few holes in the continuity like an early reference to the sun not moving but then later it becomes night. Also... one of the characters knowing so much about the flora of an alien planet seemed a bit of a leap... but then again... the fact that they were on an alien planet sort of renders that moot anyway. All in all not a bad addition to the saga. Certainly opens the door to future follow ups. They really could build a great sequel if they take the time to think it through (of course that doesn't always happen). Worth a watch if you like the rest of the predator series... it is as good or better than the Danny Glover contribution but that is just me.
B0006A9FMI|3.0|Well, I read and read and read about the US release of this DVD and thought I'd discovered the 'holy grail' when it came to this movie. Specifically, the release with subtitles, not closed-captioning. Alas, the &#34;V4&#34; release still has the same [helicopter approaching] captioning that I was desperate to avoid. So that earns this DVD three stars.<br /><br />The film itself is pretty awesome....but the closed-captioning really is distracting.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I do not believe my words in this review would do this book justice. I do not usually read this type of subject, but I am glad I did. This book had such an effect on me, a lasting impression long after I was finished, I felt so connected to these beautiful characters Landay created. I could see myself making these same decisions of Jacob's parents, having children myself I felt so torn at what they had to face I knew I'd defend my child probably at all cost, no questions asked. This story was so amazing, written so life like so real, this was a heartbreaking story for me.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Good summer read, easy quick. Not a very deep story, but enjoyable nonetheless. The book seems best for a younger audience.
B00BF11STU|3.0|This movie was ok at the end but the 2 hours leading up to the finale was very slow, dry and often hard to understand as the accents were thick and the sound quality wasn't great.  The ending was good. Skip the first 90 minutes and save yourself some time.
B002PEP4C8|3.0|I love the way things are described, but it can get very gruesome. It is a very good book though.
B00CS65JS2|5.0|Long time fan.  Have been looking forward to this album for quite a while and am not disappointed.  It may not sync the first go-round, but after a few spins, you'll be a fan.
B00CJ32S74|4.0|checked out a few of the songs and ended up liking the whole soundtrack really liked how various artists collaberated
B004TTMYQG|3.0|Cannot sync Biz calendar on phone  with Google calendar from my laptop to my phone which is the main reason I bought this app.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Hardest riddle game on Amazon and I loved it. That puzzle box is probably the coolest one I have ever seen I want one! I can't want til the next one.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|**spoiler alert**<br /><br />When you watch a special about John F. Kennedy or Abraham Lincoln, you know it's going to end badly. And so goes a book about a young girl with terminal cancer that falls in with a young boy she meets in a support group that is also recovering from cancer.<br /><br />I am not really into reading books that I know are going to be sad, and I really only read this because my book club was reading it. In fact, I am a little surprised that this has been at the top of the New York Times best seller list for young adults for so long.<br /><br />The entire time I was reading this book I was just waiting for the characters to die, and as the main character, Hazel, fell in love, I found myself wishing both her and her boyfriend would survive, and live happily ever after, knowing all along, one or both of them is probably going to die soon. That being said, there is still some uplifting and beautiful dialog between the characters, which would be suitable for someone looking for content to write a eulogy-which is the only reason I did not rate this less than the generous 3 stars I gave it.<br /><br />I would not recomend this book, unless you are the type of person that enjoys Chicken Soup for the Soul style stories and you are looking for a good cry
0786956291|5.0|Everything you need to get playing is right here. It is too good to be true. I have been sucked into Dungeons and Dragons. The only downside is, in order to have fun with this, you need a group of people not only willing to play, but also wanting to play.
B000FBJFSC|5.0|I adored this book.  I don't know how I missed it when it first came out back in the 90's!<br /><br />Frank McCourt drops you right in the flat he grew up in-with the stench of the shared outhouse next door, his mother puffing on a cigarette in the empty kitchen and the glowing coals of the fireplace heating water to make tea for the third time from the same batch of tea leaves.<br /><br />Beautifully written this memoir describes the life of povery the author experienced growing up in WW2 era Limerick, Ireland.  Raised poor, filthy and under the watchful eye of the Catholic faith, McCourt found plenty of delight in life getting into the mischief that young boys do.<br /><br />I just downloaded 'Tis and can't wait read the next chapter in Frank's life!
B007TNQ7EY|3.0|Gangster Rio. Gangster Rio is a good game. but on kindle fire, the driving kinda sucks. It is a good game though, not recommended for children under 12 or 13
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|I enjoyed all the historical information along with the wonderful story.  Would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for an interesting book.

B004UID2LC|4.0|Its great. I wanted it  so I can download funny videos. Everything works but its a little slow to download stuff.
B000OLROWC|4.0|I haven't watched this in a few decades.  I'm going to volunteer with the city to paint a few houses, so I thought this movie would be a good refresher.  Daniel was kinda whiny at the beginning, leading me to root for Cobra Kai, just a little bit.<br /><br />I will update this review if my painting performance seems better than average next Saturday.
B0030BYWKK|5.0|A beautiful album from beginning to end. Great lyrics and fantastic music.<br />I would be hard pressed to choose between this album and The Trials of Van Ocupanther
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I am addicted to match three type games and Fishdom is one of the best that I have played.  You can play for a while for free but if you want to go further you have to belly up 5 bucks, it was worth it in my opinion. Go for it.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|I very rarely leave reviews, but I've noticed this on several of the MJ Solitaire games:  I have looked very carefully at all the settings, but can't seem to find any way to \\"un-highlight\\" ONLY the available pairs.....this makes it much less challenging, and I won't play.  If anyone has found a way to do it on this game a hint would be very much appreciated.<br /><br />7-13-13.  Ok, the review has changed: The developer did update the game, and removed the highlights.  It's not the best Mah Jongg game I've played, but it is emenently acceptable now.
B0063GORYU|5.0|For all you Solitare players out there, you will definitely love this game! It is very addicting. My friends love it as well as I do. You will not want to quit.
B0018RFLN0|2.0|Having just watched the first three M:I movies this weekend, I must say this is by far the worst of the lot. The acting is wooden, the cinematography dull, the female characters cardboard cutouts. It feels much older than its 1996 vintage, and massively dated next to M:I2, which is only four years newer. Skip this installment and watch the gorgeously cinematic, John Woo-directed sequel instead.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|We cannot understand why this movie did not win the Oscar.  It's sheer beauty is amazing, and the story remarkable.
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|If you've loved Leonard Cohen for the last four decades as I have then get this concert DVD. You will not be disappointed.
B0040ORC1M|5.0|This movie is so good.  Ihaven't seen it since , theater.  The roles of Johnny Cash, by Joaquin Phoenix, and June Carter were so sincere and sound track is great
B008VO3PA4|1.0|I have been a cat lover all my life.  I downloaded this on my Kindle Fire a couple of days ago.  It took me less than 1/2 hour to read and I kept thinking \\"this is it?\\".  $7.99?  Seriously?
B009X012XM|3.0|Like many other reviewers, I wonder why they didn't add some sort of a clasp to keep the cover closed. It just flops open. Regardless, the case back seems to protect the Kindle well without making it overly bulky. The cover seems flimsy but only time will tell. As a stand, the angle is more inclined to work for an adult's height. We bought the Kindle primarily for our child to use and when we set the case in stand mode on a table the angle points up and is difficult for him to see. I have to imagine that this would be the case with most of these standing cases though. It's not bad, just could have been better.

159102594X|5.0|I would defiantly recommend this book (and the first law trilogy) for anyone looking for a good fantasy book to read. The characters are very well developed and has an excellent story. I wanted to read the next book in the series as soon as I finished this one.

B00BU8RNCE|3.0|The movie was okay. Seem like it was drawn out...you knew what was going to happen. I wish i wouldnt have spent the money on this movie
0345803507|4.0|Seller did a good job. EL James didnt the do story justice by ending it the way she did. If you do finish the trilogy, dont read the last 22 pages of the book.
B009EHDU7U|3.0|An interesting concept & a good read, reminded me a bit of Forrest Gump, being a simple, straight forward man who lives an extraordinary life. Well written, but best enjoyed if you like history.
B0052UYJDC|2.0|The book's main message is good however the way it was presented wasnt my favorite. If you want to learn about minimalism, then google it instead of buying the book

B000002H5I|1.0|Self-righteous, self-indulgent crap.  Musically simplistic and utterly dull.  Not a singly sly or subtle lyrical twist.  Many people think, because she's black and a lesbian I guess, that she's the second coming of Joan Armatrading.  She couldn't carry Joan Armatrading's frikking briefcase.

B00CL68BK2|4.0|Great movie. Doesn't need high def. No bonus content (like a DVD would have).  More convenient than red box or Netflix DVDs. Plus its easy to get in high def on amazon. Cheaper than going to the theater.

B000NQRE1E|5.0|This is one of my favorite Movies.  Thanks very much. My grandson cannot wait to see it on Blue ray.  Thanks
B00COGY2P2|4.0|Good movie! The female lead seemed to overact a bit, but the storyline was interesting and kept my attention. The final scene in the quarry was also a little overplayed. I did like the pace of the film and the ending. I would like to see a follow up to this film
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Filled some long bus rides, and was definitely entertained. I'd heard great things about the series, and was not disappointed.
B00A0R0CG0|1.0|Given the good track record I have with Pixar movies we decided to show this one to our kids without previewing it first. I found that to be a mistake. This movie was &#34;geared&#34; differently than the previous Ice Age movies. This is the first Pixar movie I regret having purchased for my kids.
B004M3GDI4|5.0|awesome work light, just what I was looking for, tired of dealing with the $15 energizer's and glad Petzl came out with this work version,<br />Super easy to change battery's, AA. remove from the clip and move to helment way to easy! Rubber guard around light and overall build quality is top notch, does not feel cheap. Paid twice for a sure fire headlamp and the Petzl easly beats it in function and form.Range of adjusment is smooth, I think the light power is great is for a 2-AA.  Would love to see a recreational version of this light, with red light and sos feature to replace my petzl tikka
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Loved it, I think it is better than Anger Birds just cause you build an apparatus to get to ONE goal and not use many birds to destroy many targets.  Love anger birds, but love this more

0679805273|5.0|I love this book!  I hope that reading it to my children can instill an understanding for lifes up's and down and help boost their self esteem.  I have my children's teachers write a note in it at the end of each school year.  When each child graduates we will gift them with this book signed by so many people who helped them on their way!
B0091REZMW|5.0|The game is fun to play and it's non-stop fun!! It's hard to put down. I love all the different types of puzzles. The game keeps me going on the edge of my seat!!!
0786948523|5.0|This book is in really awesome condition. It said there was a line on the outside of the pages (it is really just a dot). My husband who used to play D&D says that these books are lacking in some detail in comparison to the older ones.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Most definitely not my usual choice of book...it has pink on the cover for a start!<br />However it was picked for the reading group I attend and I can't deny that it was unputdownable. Because I thought it was going to be 'fluffy' I put it off to the very last minute to read even though it was a chunky 480 pages. My 'cunning plan' was to read as much as I could then blag the rest. I finished it in a day!<br /><br />I'm still not a 'pink book cover' type of reader...and have an aversion to reading about iced buns and people who are obsessed with the gym but there was actually much more to this novel than that.<br /><br />Will and Louisa, the two main characters are very different but completely likable and very realistic. The story line was slightly predictable but with a revelation just before half way that I wasn't expecting. You just HAVE to read on to see what happens. I felt so attached to the characters that I had to keep fighting the impulse to flick to the back to see if it ended the way I wanted it to...
B002BBJ52U|5.0|This is a really good movie. This is my go-to chick flick. I think I've watched it 100s of times.
B00BF123WG|3.0|I found it interesting, and the mission itself was fascinating, but I was not pulled into the whole story. I was glad to see mission accomplished, but didn't care how it affected the individuals characters involved.
B000FC13MM|4.0|It kept my interest. Nice plot. It was well written and I would recommend this Sabriel (The Abhorsen Trilogy) to friends.
B0007TKNII|5.0|I bought this for my grandmother whom is in love with the actual broadway play so much that she's seen it 5 times. Well I bought this as a surpise and the surprise was on me since when I sat down to watch it with her I found myself truly enjoying it.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|Not sure what this story means. Not sure of lesson to be learned,I would give it 3 out of 6  stars.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Fun game. Easy to master but strangely addictive. Can't beat the price either. All in all, I'll keep playing it for the mental stimulation.
B00B4804KS|5.0|I love Jurassic Park the movie.  For me it is worth to have it in all formats.  Especially the 3D format (If you have a 3D capable TV). Bluray and DVD formats are also included with this package.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|well done. brings the man to life. all actors did well. part of my esential civil war collection. Tommy Lee was good too.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I found it incredibly sad and well written. I'm always pleased by a John Green book, and I still am
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|I recently rewatched in anticipation of Before Midnight.  I was again so moved by this film, I think it's perfect.  Could be post pregnancy hormones at work, but at many points during the film I cried.  It's just that beautiful and important to me.  I really do hope they make these films until Celine & Jesse are in there 80's.  I can't say enough great things about it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|great app! it doesn't hurt that its free either. you will absolutely love playing solitaire on your device with this all.
0062082353|5.0|This book was a thriller from start to finish. It was hard to lay down without wondering what was coming next. Chris Kyle was an expert in the field of Seal Snipers. The language was quite harsh at times. It was a terrible tragedy that his life ended trying to help others right here in the USA.  Jasper Kranke  Mobile AL.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Definitely worth the wait but there were times when I just had to put it down to take a break.  The book is intense and a fitting conclusion to an epic story.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I'm addicted to it.  Can't watch just one episode at a time.  My bedtime is an hour later than before Downton Abbey.
B00CTSDDVO|4.0|Star Trek Into Darkness is an action packed, fast paced movie that will keep your attention. There are very few quiet moments in this movie as it is filled with plenty of chase scenes, Starfleet being attacked, and a run-in with the Klingons. If you like movies that have continuous action, with little character interaction, you will love Star Trek Into Darkness.<br /><br />I would have loved to seen a bit more interplay with the characters as I wrote earlier this movie was dependent on providing an adrenalin rush for the movie viewer. There are a couple touching scenes, one where Spock does a mind meld; and another where a key character dies while trying to accomplish an impossible task. The character succeeds but pays for his actions by dying. I won't write more as this would be considered a spoiler.<br /><br />One of the things I did not like was the depiction of the Klingons. The Klingons were a bit creepy and seemed a bit out of the mold for what Klingons typically look like.<br /><br />Overall, this was an excellent movie, especially if you love action movies that are less dependent on character interaction.<br /><br />Recommend.
B000HF6ZR0|5.0|This is a great scifi film, keeps you thinking, suspenseful and the soundtrack matched perfectly! A must have for your collection!
0425252868|5.0|I read a lot of WWII stories and this has surprised me the most.  What seemed at first glance to be a rather simple story spun out in a fairly deep 2\\" book has turned out to be the most comprehensive and fascinating story of the German flying experience during WWII.  Absolutely brilliant story - brilliant research and incredible \\"bit'o' luck\\" to find and document so well. Thank you Adam Makos for a wonderful reading experience!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Much appreciation goes out to Suzanne Collins for this amazing trilogy. Can hardly wait for the next film to come out.

B00BMTX5IW|5.0|I took a risk on this album after I heard a snippet of \\"That Man\\" on the radio and loved the sound. I didn't regret it at all. It's a hugely enjoyable album with a 30s and 40s swing sound (and hints of the Andrews Sisters) combined with 2010 production. Caro Emerald is a really good singer and she gives very good material a real sparkle. There is an excellent brass section, a fine keyboard player and terrific rhythm sound from percussion, guitar and double bass, with the addition of a bit of synth and scratching. I'm not a fan of scratching at all, but it isn't obtrusive and works really well here. The overall effect is irresistible from smoky ballads to swing numbers you just can't sit still to.<br /><br />This was a real departure for me, but I'm delighted that I've discovered it. If in doubt, my advice is to buy it - it's a classy, joyous treat.
B005PK1G76|5.0|It fits on the stroller and is easier to use than the all fabric versions.<br />I can also hang it on a wheelchair.<br />BUT it is described as insulated and having a pocket but the pocket is mesh and not insulated<br />and an insulated 'bowl' does not hold in cold.<br />It is perfect for keys, cups, snack cups and any other small item you need handy.
030758836X|1.0|I am forcing myself to finish this book. I found it very boring, but now I just want to get it over with. I had hopes it would be good since it has been on the bestseller list for so long, but I don't know why. My sister warned me, I should have listened!
B0034G4P9E|4.0|good. I need to type nineteen words but have nothing to type. Good is all I have to say here.
B0010SKUYM|1.0|I am so disappointed in this book.  It started out great, mysterious innkeeper with an equally mysterious sidekick, attack by strange beings that came from elsewhere, foreboding atmosphere hinting at encroaching dark times.  Then, we learn that the mysterious innkeeper is a famous (infamous) \\"wanted\\" person hiding out at the inn.  I thought the book was getting better and better.  However, once Kvothe started telling his story, the plot quickly slowed and became tedious.  Did we really need to know every single thing that Kvothe did every day as a 9 year old?  I understand that a certain amount of the time Kvothe spent with Abenthy was necessary to explain \\"sympathy\\" and \\"naming\\", but really it just went on and on.  The whole time Kvothe spent in Tarbean should have taken up a couple of pages rather than endless pages.  Finally, Kvothe gets to the university and all we hear about is his endless poverty and how he is in danger of getting kicked out every term if he can't come up with the coin to pay his tuition.  Again, a certain amount of what happens at the university is necessary to explain the \\"workings\\" of Kvothe's world, but it really is endless.  I'm about 75% through the first volume and I don't know if I will be able to finish.  Nothing is happening.  We are no closer to learning what is going on in the present day.<br /><br />I don't find Kvothe unlikable as many people with negative reviews.  He's telling his story of the time when he was young.  The young Kvothe is very arrogant and full of pride.  He thinks he knows everything.  Well, when I was 15 I thought I knew everything too.  The problem I have is he doesn't seem to grow.  He doesn't realize the consequences of his actions.  He doesn't mature.  Perhaps because the book is so tediously long?  Does it really take over 700 pages to recount one person's life from ages 9 to 15 or 16?  Really?<br /><br />The writing is fine; although I feel like we are suffering from the author's over active imagination.  We know already that the author can create endless scenes and characters.  However, if those scenes and characters don't move the plot forward or are rather uninteresting, why include them?  There are some great moments and some funny moments.  However, I really want to know what's going on in the present day Kvothe world, but don't see how I can wade through another volume.  Why is Kvothe hiding out?  What happened?  Why has trading diminished?  What happened in the past that led to the future?  I might just skip the second volume and go to the last volume (if it ever comes out).  The summaries I've read about the second volume don't really bring us any closer to what's going on in the present day world and Kvothe's part in it.We know already that the author can create endless scenes and characters.

B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|If you're going to watch this movie, you will need to take notes.  I have seen movies where you bounce back and forth, through time, and deal with different characters, but this movie bounces through so many time periods, both past and future! You have to pause it for a second just to think, &#34;Okay, this is what these people are dealing with.&#34; It could've been better with less bouncing around, I think.

B00BSBUZT6|5.0|Saw this movie with the band at the Sundance premiere. They had a Q&A with the band after. They guys were awesome hung around for like an hour answering questions and reminiscing about the old days. This set is a must have for any fan of the eagles or music of that era, or just music fans in general. Absolutely awesome insight into one of the greatest group of singers songwriters and musicians of the era or possibly ever. Loved it!!!

B00AFPTSI0|5.0|This book is bound to become a classic, and combines poignant story telling with cutting edge research to paint a picture of what success should and could look like in the 21st century.  If you've ever wondered whether a kinder, gentler, more humane approach to your work could result in incredible success, Adam Grant not only says &#34;yes&#34; but also shows you precisely what that looks like, generously backs it up with evidence from research, and highlights some of the pitfalls along the way.  I think this book should be required reading for anyone entering or working in a leadership role.

B0061PEAUY|4.0|&#34;Bones Are Forever&#34; is another marvelous forensic anthropology thriller by Kathy Reich. As in all her books, this one is filled with fascinating medical, forensic, criminal, historical, and scientific details. The characters and dialogue are skillfully realized, the story authentic and believable...and each chapter irresistibly propels you into the next with clever (and often annoying) cliffhangers. In fact, it's quite hard to put the book down! Best of all, it's easy to get lost in the story and forget you're reading at all. At times, it seemed like events were playing themselves out in my mind's eye like a movie or TV drama. <br /><br /> The book starts with the discovery of the remains of three newborns in a small squalid apartment of a young prostitute living in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It appears the woman has been killing her full term babies as soon as they are born and stuffing them in various hiding places in her home. Temperance Brennen, a forensic anthropologist, and the star of Reich's series of &#34;Bones&#34; thrillers, is called to examine the decayed body, mummy, and bones of the three tiny victims and to help with apprehending the killer. The case takes Temperance--along with two male criminal investigators--to Edmonton and later to the far northern frontier settlement of Yellowknife. Temperance has past and current romantic relationships with both of her colleagues on this case, and this adds  complications and interest. As the evidence mounts, the case becomes a jumble of conflicting and confusing leads. There are more questions than answers and, as usual, Temperance seems constantly to be getting herself into dangerous circumstances in order to uncover the truth. <br /><br />When I was seventy percent of the way through the novel, I figured out the why, but it wasn't until the end of the novel that I knew the who. I was satisfied with the ending and felt it was well supported by all that had come before without any overt literary obfuscations or tricks. I learned a great deal about the First Nation people of Canada and about some of their existing social, economic, and cultural problems.

B00AQMSJI2|2.0|game requires too much time and really costs a ridiculous amount of money to actually enjoy playing and it is cheaper to buy a pc game for that matter.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|I expected more from a physician.  Nothing  convincing.  At least h  referred to the Divine presence generically vas God, no t Jesus, Allah, or Buddha, which would  have caused me to write.off.this  book as another Jesus freak<br /><br />Save your money.<br /><br />Agwesq
B001NA6096|5.0|It is about honestly and vulnerably building relationships.  The Q and A scenes and the restaurant telephone scene are beautifully and cleverly done to evoke who Celine and Jesse are and how they feel about things and each other.  I have now seen Before Sunrise and Before Sunset and anxiously await the release of Before Midnight here in Tampa.
B0090XO57C|5.0|I bought this series for my grandaughter and grandson.  She is 9 yr., he is 4 yr.  They both loved it and were attentive and interested in the entire series.  I was very pleased with the series, the children were asking questions and commenting during the program.<br />It is well worth the money.<br />In this day and age,so much is missed from our schools in regards to science and the planet earth.  There may be one day when many animals seen on this DVD will no longer exist.<br />This series allows the children to visit places they may never see and learn of animals,places,species who are not familiar to them.<br />We have watched it several times, each time catching &#34;something new&#34;.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Avengers Assemble! The best superhero team movie to date! The movie is excellent in all areas, Action, Adventure, Drama, Comedy. The plot is as close as the original comic book story, updated to our times of course. But everything else is dead on. From the team roster; Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, Captain America, Black Widow, Nick Fury, to the villains, Loki, and the Skrulls. It was a joyride from beginning to end, can't wait for the sequel. Buy it...
B00CW665VI|4.0|I wasn't sure about the POV at first. I had it in my head that t was a woman author how is she going to write from a guys/mans POV (guys/mans explained in the book by Delores)? But she did it.and did a good job in my opinion. I gotta say Mackenzie is my favorite. Laugh. Oh man how I laughed.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Star Wars! what else can you say about it, oh! It's on Blue Ray! Finally! Both sets of movie trilogies in one package, still hold well to today standards. Of course, the first set (4,5,6) are the most sought after. As a set, it is a good buy, for collectors and movie fans alike. The package could have been more durable, it's compress carton, and it will wear off with time. But as any Star Wars fan out there will say, highest possible recommendation, until there is another set available with all the movies from the saga, this is the one to get.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|My favorite of Gillian Flynn's books. I read this third, starting with Gone Girl, then Dark Places, and finishing with Sharp Objects. LOVED.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is very challenging and once you play it, its hard to quit.  Give it a try and see for your self.  Good Luck!
B005LAIIJY|5.0|Very action packed from the start to the end.  Lots of gore, great story and amazing acting.  I was never a fan of Tartentino's work.  I think his &#34;comedic&#34; use of gore is just over the top.  With this movie I feel like it was tastefully done and made the movie more exciting.
B001MSMULG|4.0|Enjoyable thriller with the usual pretty girls, exotic locations, double crosses and exhaustive details about weapons and in thus case art restoration. A friend recommended I try this series so I started with the first. Will give the 2nd a try as it was realistically believable and exciting. Similar to the Dark Rain series.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|My GF brought this movie over and I thought, &#34;Oh great another awful chick flick I have to watch where i'll never get my 90 minutes back.&#34;  I was wrong.  I laughed constantly throughout this movie.  Very witty.  Had a Bridesmaids kind of feel to it.  Just because its about singing and has only girls on the cover doesn't make it gender sensitive.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|My granddaughter, age 6, loves it.  The graphics are cool.  It just seems to be a bit monotonous to me.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Got it before the rainy holiday weekend.  My husband and son played most of Monday.  They love it.  They tend to play until they have beaten all the levels if there is a challenge.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|This story is about the ways different people from different races learn how to communicate and hopefully survive against the backdrop of the American south during the days of slavery. There are 2 voices, one a young Irish girl who finds herself with one foot in both worlds as well as a young slave woman whose father is the plantation owner. For the most part, the characters are well developed and complex although some are too stereotypical however historically accurate. The end is a little too tidy but some of the characters, Mama Mae in particular, are very interesting and endearing. definitely worth the read.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|As often happens with books-to-movies, there was a definite attempt to cram too much of the book into the short film time frame.  Still, there's some decent acting and you can easily &#34;see&#34; what the latent emotional content is supposed to be.  Not too deep, but decent storyline and a good ending.  Worth seeing!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I use this app along with the one on my galaxy phone and so fars its been good. I have no complains for this app.
1583334386|5.0|while it won't guarantee success is habit modification it certainly helps. First read and re-read this on kindle and then ordered a copy to pass along to friends that haven't entered the electronic reading age.
B00AMBK6J2|2.0|I had heard great reviews of this movie and parts were funny but it really wasn't all that good .
B00007KWHG|5.0|went to see jersey boys and had to buy the cd of the guys themselves - it's great - i love it !!
0880796863|5.0|I have over 10 decks of tarot cards and this is one of my favorite to use to do readings. I highly recommend this deck as a staple in your tarot cards selections.
B0063IH60K|1.0|Too many pop up ads. Charge 99c and give us a break! Once they pop up you can't get rid of them.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. This book was mentioned several times at Opscode conference last month, so I decided to read it. I do consulting and work for all kind of companies. So I've came across many of the scenarios mentioned in this book. This book emphasizes on the fact that IT is not an another department, it's the core competency. Author talks about constant chaos due to isolation between IT and other departments. Also great amount of particle information about finding constraints, visualizing the works flow using Kanban. There is so much good information in this book I will most likely read it again
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This needs a bug fix, due to the fact that it is crashing for no reason, imangi studios, fix it please
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My eight year old is loving it! If you are familiar with Angry Birds, this gives it an interesting twist.
B00170KA0C|4.0|Played well on my Kindle fire. Amazon makes me write more than this so I am still writing. Yay banban.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|My eight year old son would play this one all day if I let him.  It's fun for kids, adults might want the kids to wear headphones or turn the sound down.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|The basic story of Les Miserables is truly incomparable.  Victor Hugo does get a little carried away with the fine details, the battle of Waterloo for instance went on and on too long I thought for what it impacted on the story.. The detail about the French sewers also seemed too much for its importance in the story.<br />In spite of going on a little long on some of the details, it was a fascinating read, and learning more of the story behind the movies and musicals was very rewarding.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Downloaded this one for my son, though I'm anxious to try it myself!  He'll probably have to tutor me, which he'll enjoy as well.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|Package as depicted, product was NOT expired, no problem using batteries.  Shipping took forever, but, like others, I am happy to trade a bit of time for a great price.
B001JIDE3M|4.0|Watched it with my 8 year old son and we both enjoyed the special effects.  Story line is easy to follow and the dinosaurs were a big hit with him.
1594204217|5.0|Sound advise and good look at whole food cooking from differant cooking angle and styles. Interesting reading rather than just recipies.
B000W9DSVW|4.0|A great product, just the thing I was looking for. I got it on time and it was in perfect conditions.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Loved this book.  One of those page turners, that you can't put down.  Gillian Flynn is a very good writer, I could picture each scene as if I was there.  Both of the main characters were a mess, Nick was a spineless cheat, and Amy was a sociopath.  What a pair!  I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes thrillers.
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|This could win an award for the most disappointing movie with a great cast, it's somethinng like Pulp Fiction meets Dr. Who, with out the awesomeness of Pulp Fiction or the Mediocrity of Dr. Who....<br /><br />Ughh what a waste of time
B008LVCKH6|3.0|It was very repetitive, every new character was informed again, of his past meetings of presidents or important people!<br />I like the present story best and I liked the detective that was after the group of them, and that he joined with them in the end. LOL! Great imagination but not believable. Book club pick or I would not have read it.
B006R1T40I|5.0|What we have come to expect and more from Mrs. Raitt.  Includes some new songs with an exciting twist we much enjoyed--you will love it!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Although it takes a while to get used to katniss' short choppy sentences, and the plot is somewhat  ruined by my having seen the trailers for the 2nd movie before reading this, I didn't expect the ever so appealing complicated-love thing underlying the whole book. Collins does a good job describing scenery, and the whole scene with Rue is touching. The plot contains many literary sub-plots that are quite frequently favored by writers, but overall it's a decent story.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|This is an exceptional book to read alone or a companion to The Orphan Master's Son. It gives the reader a sense of what life is like in North Korea, through the eyes of several recent defectors.
B00COHIFQS|1.0|This is a stupid movie, I just couldn't watch it all the way through.  Why I ever ordered it, I have no idea!
B0091REZMW|4.0|A very enjoyable game.  Love the search and find aspect.  The different levels of difficulties in each room makes it fun.
B005MLP71Y|5.0|Our 5 year old daughter wanted to watch it on a roadtrip and she was laughing alot. She said it was funny!
B0052QXAEK|5.0|Enjoyed the message.  Enjoyed that even when he was being a jerk, self-centered individual that in his eyes you could still see a &#34;boy desiring to be loved for himself&#34;.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Loved this first season. I'm a Sherlock Holmes fan and have seen a lot of different takes on the original stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. I was hesitant about this series at first given the modern setting; but within the first few minutes, I was sold. Characters are well-developed and immediately recognizable. Plot lines are fresh and interesting, and the shows make for entertaining evenings while holding true to the spirit of the original stories.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Have enjoyed seeing life during the Vikings era.  Would like to see more of what everyday life was as a dominate part not just a backdrop.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|I stopped reading after only a few pages.  It promised to be too cruel for my taste and I decided not to finish it.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|Really like how it is written where one starts a sentence and then each agent adds on to the sentence going around the room to explain what is occurring.  That the thought process to the answer is out loud and is steps being worked through.  Actors are amazing!  I am a devoted fan, especially of Penelope.  Love that girl!
0345440900|5.0|This book has some great tips and advice. It helped with me creating a routine (not a hard-and-fast schedule) that works for my family and my baby. It also had some great advice on how to talk to your baby. It helped me greatly!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Having heard this title as a movie, but knowing nothing about it, I decided to see what it was about. I wouldn't have guessed the story. It is a delightful, heart wrenching one. I can't wait to watch the movie, but I usually find that the book is always better than the movie. That will be okay. Open the book and enjoy Pat, Tiffany, and all the others.
B00884GR0W|5.0|I will pay 10 Dollars for this game. Because it is so fun. That was just my opinion.so what do you think.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|An incredible show. Joss Whedon at at his best with the sharp wit and crass humor for which his characters are known. It had so much potential.....
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Book keeps you wanting more...suspenseful, and slightly addictive...Suzanne Collins is a heck of a writer. In love with Hunger Games.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|Yes, worth every penny and I hope the series continues.<br /><br />Very interesting plot, and held my attention each episode, all I really look for in a TV show.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|This has been lots of fun, and I enjoy Oprah comments and being able to respond back to them! This site keeps one in tune with what;s happening in today's Society!
B005BGBPBG|5.0|Love Kate Hudson and this was a great movie ! This was romance story with a twist and very well done .
B008IJTFYW|5.0|yea....I can finally rest instead of counting sheep .. I would highly recommend this for anyone having problems resting. u can really have fun with this app
B00CP2Z5TC|4.0|While this may not be my favorite Vampire Weekend disc, it has some very good songs on the CD.  I especially enjoyed their willingness to experiment and try new things with their music.  A song or two just appears okay and maybe need some extra listens to really get their full enjoyment, but overall a solid effort.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Wow this game is very entertaining! I was going on vacation an  I knew it was going to be a long bus ride, so I decided to purchase this game because it looked interesting. I finished the entire game in 7 hours!
0553801473|5.0|Here is my advice:  If you love the HBO series on television, then buy the books and read them.  Or, if you like stuff like King Arthur, Merlin, Medieval Times, Tolkein, then you will enjoy.  Just an epic adventure!<br /><br />With the sex and violence comes the caution that these books are NOT for kids.  I think I would say 18+ on the books if your children are asking for them.<br /><br />Only critique is that there are SO many characters added, and so many places in the realm, I sometimes find myself referring back to another book or to the maps (which can be kind of fun too!).  I also missed some of the characters that he killed off or those that didn't make the cut to this book.  Can't wait for the next one!  Brilliant Author!
B0042X9L6A|5.0|I have had this flash for over a month and have used it extensively, but only on camera with the diffuser attached. It is very easy to use in this mode. One doesn't have to master a lot of details to get great results. It just works. The SB-700 has much more power than the built in flash so it can be used at greater distances. I think it also does a better job covering a wider area at the same distance, so it has been good for larger groups of people. It also strikes me as producing more flashes from one set of batteries than other flash units that I have used. The diffuser reduces harsh shadows and red eye. By the way, a diffuser cap and some filters come with the flash unit, which is not mentioned in the specs. I haven't begun to master the power of this flash in different types of settings and uses - especially with multiple flashes. I look forward to learning those techniques.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|wonderful , cannot wait for seson two on Prime.  This is one of the most entertaining shows ever and the talent is unsurpassed.
B00C8985DU|5.0|I was there...and now I'm back and the sound is INCREDIBLE.  What I loved in the day are those Muscle Shoals HORNS pumping and blasting away into the heart of Paul's tunes.  It makes me a little sad when I see where we are today---there is no room for the dynamic talent like Paul---composer, singer, player given free reign to extend and explore his brilliance.  Those days are OVER.  What is lovely is to hear this uncompressed---open---dynamic----CLEAR as a bell.  In those days Paul played his bass like a lead guitar---like a rocket and it was rocket and roll baby.  Remember we're talking just six years after the break up of the Beatles, so it was still SEEING and HEARING a Beatle that was such a thrill.  Live you could hear his genius.  His old school Al Jolson showmanship---Paul brought with him music stylings all the way back to Jim Mac's day and he knew how to put er' there.  Gone. Gone. Gone baby gone.  These days of MUSIC and HARMONY without choreography and auto tune.  We needed nothing more than the MUSIC ---the pure high octane sound of the soul and this album is a YOU ARE THERE sample of what it was like in the day.  Yeah, we were more innocent and pure.  Yup, gays and blacks don't look back upon those day's fondly---though their music shined in the day.  But to go back on a this aural magic carpet ride is a thrill for this guy who was there in Madison Square in the day.  I saw John too there.  But there was nothing and is nothing like our Sir Paul who I've seen a good dozen times since.  He still rocks and entertains like there's a gun to his head....but his age is taking it's toll a bit and there are certainly age appropriate cracks to be heard.  But in 1976 it was all pure, delirious FUN.  We were one connected species in one mammoth room, all FEELING the very same thing.  The Beatles were fast slipping away nostalgia and we were longing for one more lick; one more taste and man, we got it: cause we listened to what the man said.  BUY this if you want to take a time machine back and FEEL and HEAR the cadence of the thrill ride that was.  BUY this if you want to go back to where you once belonged.  Bravo you technical wizards of today who were able to take the crappy sound of the Columbia recordings from years back and turn them into the magic that I'm listening to pumping into my PSB M4u1 headphones that make the singer LEAP into your skull.  Buy, buy, love.  Buy, buy blackbird.  It's all a wondertake a time machine back and FEEL and HEAR the cadence of the thrill ride that was.

B0050X1OQ6|5.0|I probably didn't need  this for a home NAS but for the money I couldn't resist.  The memory went in easy and I  have seen no problems with the performance of the NAS since I  put in the extra memory.  Honestly I  cannot see any performance  improvements  yet but I haven't pushed the unit hard enough to test it out.<br /><br />For the price I don't think that you can  go wrong.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Enjoying getting to grips with this, although constrained by lack of energy and invest points (probably my fault). One minor criticism is that a major way of getting invest points is to post each minor achievement on Facebook. If you don't do that you're at a bit of a disadvantage.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|This game had some challenging puzzles and I enjoyed the chapters overall.  I would have liked it more if it had a few more chapters.
B009R659L8|5.0|This book I read fast.  It kept you wanting to see what happens next.  I recommend this book - very good story.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is a fun game! It is so cool it couldn't be better you should buy it. Get it now
B005V2EVBQ|2.0|I have 2 cases, one for each of my Kindle Fire 1st Gen.  Case worked fine but I kept having problems connecting to Wi-Fi.  After many attempts of re-booting, being sent new device, resetting to factory defaults, we (customer service and I) were amazed to find out it was the case!  Took it out of the case, re-booted, Wi-Fi connected easily.  Wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it myself.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I finished this book in just over 24 hours.  I seriously could not put it down and I can't wait to read the last one to see how it all ends.  You really need to read the Hunger Games first or parts of this won't make sense.  My only regret is that I didn't read this series sooner!!
B00A8MGIZG|1.0|I'm not one of those who \\"loves to write negative reviews\\", and I bought this movie because of the Actors (I'm a big fan of all of the stars in this flick), and because I thought I was going to see a sane approach to reincarnation and past lives.  The movie jumps around far too much, creating confusion as to the characters and the actual message.  With the suicide scene being focused on the way it was, I can only conclude that this story is simply some Psychiatrist's version of \\"Past Lives\\".  The acting is GREAT.  The story is confusing, not very real, and . . . bottom line - sucks.  Sorry Tom and Halle.  I love you and your awesome talents, but you should have let this one pass.<br />Sincerely,<br />Doc
B002ZG9968|5.0|Fabulous movie.  They paired just the right two people to pull off this story.  I've watched it over and over again it is so good.  Buy it and make your day.
B00CL50LEC|4.0|This Zombie film was written and screen played with great ideas behind it. It was enjoyable to watch a zombie flick from the perspective of the actual zombie. I am going to watch it again and really engage myself in it.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|Very disappointing that this app that worked on my tiny ipod does not work at all on the new Kindle Fire HD that I received as a birthday gift. It is one of the only games I play with some friends and the error code marmalade v5.2.1 keeps crashing the app. Apparently the app developers are not fixing this issue.
0061122092|5.0|Paulo Coelho and some of my favorite quotes are from this book.  It's an interesting love story, and I'm suprised at all the things Coelho is willing to cover in his stories.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I've been playing this on my laptop, then tried on my phone but the screen was too small. Got a Kindle and downloaded the app right away. The game plays smoothly, loads quickly, and the size is perfect for viewing/playing.
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|I like Tom Cruise, and really bought the movie simply because I wanted to fill in a boring weekend I knew was coming up.  I was not expecting much as the title didn't really grab me.  However, I was very pleasantly surprised as I sat there riveted throughout the entire movie.  I'll let others get into the plot in greater detail, but I highly recommend you buy it.  You won't be disappointed.<br />Sincerely,<br />Doc
B000MQC9H4|5.0|This movie has paired two wonderful couples that pull at my heart strings.  The whole story line is lovely.  Even thought it is a Christmas movie, I find myself watching it all the time.  Buy it you'll be glad you did.
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|Fans of the Harris novels and movies alike should find enough similarities to their beloved characters to love the series, yet it breaks new ground.  The uninitiated should also like the series so far because it is somewhat of an origin story. Either way plenty of serial killer porn, forensic porn and a touch of drama where it propels the story instead of dragging it down.
B00C7O8TSM|3.0|I wish someone would define the word \\"live\\" as applied to music recordings supposedly done before audiences and outside the normal recording studio environment.  Anyone foolish enough to believe that this or any other \\"live\\" recording by a pop-rock group in the past 30 years has not been \\"doctored up\\" in the studio after the fact....well,  may you continue to enjoy your ignorant bliss.  I've been an audio engineer and a professional musician for half a century. Sorry folks, but most of what you hear here vocally happened many weeks after the actual concert, back in the recording studio.  Fact:  all of the original Beach Boys are in their 60's and none of them can sing anywhere near as good as they could 40 years ago.  The guy who saves this band live is Jeffrey Foskett, with his near-perfect replication of Brian's once choirboy-like falsetto.  Even with that, 80% of the vocals on this album have been re-recorded after the fact.  But what really makes my skin crawl is the amount of Auto-Tune being used.  Auto-Tune is the most heinous invention in audio history.  It completely removes the soul and the beautiful imperfection of the human voice.  Auto-tuned harmony vocals are totally lifeless and artificial sounding.  40 years ago, the Beach Boys produced incredibly beautiful, shimmering harmonies and they did it without any Auto-Tune.  It's the slight imperfections between multitracked vocals that create the beautiful, rich  thickness that's absent from the vocals on this recording.  But the \\"industry standards\\" now dictate what everybody's recordings have to sound like to be publicly acceptable.  I wasn't a fan of Joe Thomas's production on \\"Imagination\\", and I sure don't like it on this one.  There's no real \\"punch\\" or power.  For a 13 piece band with 5 guitar players, I expected a little more excitement.  I guess I am alone in my belief that there's no crime in a having a couple of mistakes or off-key notes on a recording - that it reminds me that I am listening tohumans and not machines.  I actually breathed a sigh of relief when I heard Mike D'Amico's bass mistake a minute-five into \\"Hawaii\\", so I guess the music tracks are all the original live ones.  Even the audience response sounds \\"canned\\" in places.  All that said, I grew up with the Beach Boys and their music changed my life.  I've bought everything they've ever done and will continue to do so because I love 'em to death.  I hope this album makes them lots of money and their fans happy, but I much prefer listening to the studio versions of their stuff.<br /><br />Additions:  After more careful listening, I'm finding a ton of mistakes on bass guitar.  Don't know who because there were 3 different rotating bass players on the tour; Mike D'amico, Probyn Gregory, and someone else I can't remember now...but you'd think someone would have patched up the bass clams on this release.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|LOVE TO SEE MORE OF THESE FREE SERIES IN THE FUTURE.  WILL BE BACK TO CHECK FOR MORE SOON. THANKS
B00138KJY0|5.0|This album should be part of the foundation of every Michael Jackson fan's collection.  Every song is a memorable classic & nearly every one was a number one hit. You have to buy it.
B00C7NKPPS|2.0|Great to see & hear the re-mastering of the McCartney archives.  Some of these desperately needed it.  Especially WOA.  But, as with the others so far in this archives collection series, the packaging is sub-standard and crap.  Comes in a cardboard box that does not hold the CDs in place.  My Disc 2 was scratched and am going to have to return.  Why go to all the trouble of remastering, adding bonus tracks to editions, digging through archives of old photos - all to make it a special thing - then skimp on the packaging?  I don't understand.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|love Nicholas sparks, always romance w/ a message.  wonderful story that also comments on important issues of our time.  domestic violence, dealing w/ loss, cancer mortality, single parenthood.  it is uplifting and inspirational and I loved it.

B001NHNG64|5.0|The characters and the plot are strong.  Lots of good background info, but still fast-paced.  I read it in 2 days.  I could not put it down.  I really like characters that have instincts to do what is right, with honor and integrity.  Both Jack and the lead female character were that way.  I like it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book is amazing the author has a wild unique imagination I highly recommend the book to readers who have not let read it.

B009LMTDL0|5.0|\\"We cannot change what we are unaware of, and once we are aware, we cannot helpbut change.\\" ~ Sheryl Sandberg, COO Facebook<br /><br />Sheryl Sandberg's recent book, Lean In, prompted a flurry of controversy even before its official release. Some claimed Sandberg blamed women for our low representation in prestigious leadership positions; others criticized her for solutions that were too simplistic or not realistic.<br /><br />Personally, after reading Lean In, I don't quite understand the hubbub. I interpreted the book as more of a clarion call to action and a reminder that together we are better.<br /><br />Sandberg does not claim to have the prescription for every woman's professional path and the answer for getting more of us in the C-suites of corporate America. \\"I do not believe that there is one definition of success or happiness,\\" she states right in the introduction and multiple times throughout the book. \\"I would never advocate that we should all have the same objectives. We each have to chart our own unique course and define which goals fit our lives, values, and dreams.\\"<br /><br />And since women hold just 14% of Executive Officer positions at Fortune 500 companies - and only 4% of Fortune 500 CEOs are women (Catalyst, 2013) - I, for one, am thankful that Sandberg has made her experience accessible for the rest of us.<br /><br />I took away 3 key calls to action from Sandberg's thought-provoking book:<br /><br />1. Lean In<br /><br />Sandberg suggests that for those women aspiring to leadership roles, we need to lean in - figuratively and literally. Sit at the head table, take initiatives and healthy risks, and stay in the game as you advance your career path.<br /><br />She shares a powerful example from a meeting held at Facebook which involved 15 executives, including 4 women. When Sandberg asked everyone to take their seats, most gathered at the main conference table, but the women sat in chairs off to the side of the room. Sandberg waved them overto the main table, but they demurred and remained in their seats.<br /><br />\\"As women, we constantly underestimate ourselves,\\" Sandberg shares. She later quotes Alice Walker: \\"The most common way people give up their power is by thinking they don't have any.\\"<br /><br />Confidence is key to leaning in. Stand in your power, know your purpose, speak up. Sit at the table, knowing that you belong there.<br /><br />2. Reach Out<br /><br />As we lean in to advance our professional success, we need to reach out to help other women advance theirs. Yes, a single person can make a difference, but we can make a bigger difference more quickly if we support one another along the way.<br /><br />We can reach out to peers to offer - and accept - support.<br /><br />We can reach out to those who have helped pave the way to learn from them and help them progress further.<br /><br />And we can reach out and mentor those following in our footsteps, and encourage them to pay it forward.<br /><br />3. Rise Above<br /><br />While we need differing opinions in order to have honest discussion and generate real solutions, we can disagree respectfully and in the spirit of growth. To promote stronger leadership - by both men and women, small- and large-scale - we'd be well-served to transcend \\"arguing for the sake of arguing\\" and build a leadership foundation that supports and elevates.<br /><br />In particular, we can rise above:<br /><br />* The claim, when things aren't working, that \\"this is how it is.\\" We've all heard the definition of insanity as doing the same things over and over and expecting different results. Take your passion, rise above the path of least resistance, and instigate real change.<br />* Thinking that work and family is an \\"either/or\\" proposition. Let's look, as the late Dr. Stephen Covey suggested, for the 3rd alternative - the \\"and.\\"<br />* Viewing each other as competitors in situations where we are not. In Lean In, Stanford professor Deborah Gruenfeld says, \\"As [individual women], we have relatively low levels of power. Working together, we are 50% of the population and therefore have real power.\\"<br /><br />Again, we are better together.<br /><br />I believe we need both men and women, we need both leaders and followers, we need both dreamers and detailers. Our diversity can strengthen us when we build from a common foundation and work towards an empowering vision.<br />I agree with Sandberg that we've come a long way, but we've got a long way to go.<br /><br />So I celebrate Sandberg for raising the dialogue. I honor women and men who work together to elevate our combined experience. I commit to leaning in, reaching out, and rising above as often as possible to enrich my own life as well as hopefully all those I encounter. And I encourage leaders to read Lean In and join the dialogue around the rich topics Sandberg has brought to the table.
B00A2XU9IS|5.0|The kids like to play with this app all year long.  It tells a story but also has interactive activities for each day.  After each day has passed you can go back and replay them.  They can't wait for this holiday season in hopes there will be a new story.
B000FCK65W|5.0|One of my favorite book when I was growing up. Bought it for my grand-daughter for her to read while we were on vacation. Was hoping she would like it as much as I did when  I first read it. She did not disappoint me, A Tree grows In Brooklyn did not disappointment. I hear it is on this years must read book list. Would recommend to any pre-teen/teen to read
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|it's just like Mario, thats why i got the game, works great on my Kindle.  it's cool i have both this one and the first Lep's World.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|If looking into and questioning what you think you know engages you, you will love this film.  If being engaged by what you don't immediately comprehend is something you find faulty or broken, then the gifts this film presents may appear as a serious detriment.  But do you want yet another movie that unfurls plot lines you've seen before with slightly different details designed specifically to not challenge you as a viewer?
B009NY43NY|4.0|OK I LOVE ALL THINGS SOOKIE!!!!!!!!! Yes I know that some people were not happy about the ending of this epic series but I did. I love Charlaine Harris's writing. Her stories are witty, charming, and full of suspense and I love every minute of it.<br /><br />Sookie is one of my all time favorite characters. I love the fact that she expresses everything she feels and holds NOTHING back!! She is always into something and there is always someone after her.....<br /><br />You never know what you are going to get when you begin a Sookie Stackhouse novel but you know this....IT WILL BE GOOD!!! Every new character that pops out is just as fascinating as the one before.<br /><br />Sookie is my favorite character but there is a close running for second between her best friend/boss Sam and her ex-vampire boyfriend Bill. There is just something about Bill that I have always loved. He always fights for Sookie no matter what. Even after their relationship ended he always swore he would watch out for her and he does...<br /><br />Another character that I enjoy immensly is the bitch of all bitches, Pam. Pam is Eric's (Sookie's \\"current vampire love\\") child. Pam is just fascinating. She is mean and vindictive but yet you know she will always have your back.<br /><br />When thinking of how I would write my review I ended up with the decision to not give away any spoilers. The shocks and secrets are what make this book good. I will say that yes the ending is not what alot will expect especially with how this series has been going and being shown on tv (True Blood.) But die-hard Sookie fans (such as myself) will love the book no matter what. I am truly sad that this is the last book in the series. I will miss Charlaine's writing and her story-telling....
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Very  cool graphics and a fun concept. I don't like how you have to either buy more pearls or wait for the reward chain, but overall, it's pretty good.

B00AHQNHSY|4.0|I have a Kindle Fire (2nd gen and NOT HD).  I was recommended this app to play some personal videos I had loaded.  It plays all my videos that I had converted to MP4 just fine.  Easy to use.  Just open the player and select movies.  They were all right there.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like is that there is no volume control.  I have a couple videos that play a little low and volume control would have been nice.<br /><br />In the description, it states that the player shows video thumbnails.  Well, not on mine.  There's a generic \\"movie\\" box with the file name beside it but no actual scene from the video shows.  It's a minor thing though.<br /><br />Nice player and it was FREE!  Can't beat that.

B004J4WLB4|5.0|I found the characters compelling.  A very interesting reflection on individuals who are in deep and complex ways disconnected from society, and on how they find a common lifeline.  Well written.  Made a strong connection with me and kept me turnign page after page tl the end.

B009ZXT4BY|4.0|I really enjoyed this game, but it need more time. They should maybe make some items available in the full version and give you unlimited time to play.
0385349947|2.0|I have to give this book mixed reviews.  This is an excellent book about women in leadership positions in corporate America.  It is an excellent book about obstacles women encounter in trying to ascend the corporate \\"jungle gym\\" and societal and personal expectations.  Sandberg gives excellent testimonials, is honest, vulnerable, and transparent, and she tandems her own experiences with good research and scientific data.<br /><br />However, this is not a book about mothers in leadership positions.  As I turned through the pages chapter by chapter, I was expecting to learn how she blends motherhood into her corporate life.  I was sorely disappointed that the discussion wasn't there.  When I finished the book, I needed to reread the jacket to see if my expectation was misplaced.  But no, she bills this book as the mother who can do it all.  Even the opening sentence, \\"I was pregnant with my first child in 2004\\", suggests a discussion about parenting.  There are no testimonials about her own parenting experiences, or dialogue about how her children fit into and are affected by her corporate leadership life.  After reading the book, I know more about her relationship with Mark Zuckerberg than I do about her relationship with her children.  She doesn't even share how many kids she has, or their age and gender.  One very heart-felt testimonial involved a woman who would dress her kids in their school clothes<br />at bedtime so she could save 15 mins in the morning; but this wasn't her story, it was the story of one of her colleagues.  There is another story about a female subordinate who sits through a dinner time meeting, shifting anxiously, becasue she needs to nurse her child and doesn't feel she can leave the meeting early.  But again, this is not her story.  When she does try to devote discussion about parenting, there are no personal accounts and it comes off as clunky, inauthentic, and dishonest.  She fails to give the same honest, vulnerable account of parenting that she provides in her discussions on leadership.<br /><br />If this was a book about women in corporate American, I would give it 4 stars.  But I actually find it a little deceitful that this is billed as a book about how a mother balances parenting with her rise to leadership.  It's a good read, and certainly worth reading, I just find it is not the book it promises to be.
B009CQMZ6K|3.0|Purchased this for my Samsung Galaxy Note II.<br />I thought it would not open wide enough to fit the SGN II in landscape...to my surprise, it does!<br />The photo showing the stand/cradle holder seemed edited.  What I mean by that was the color is saturated so the &#34;red&#34; rubber pads looks really red and the white version looks really white...in real life, it is not.  You can't always get what you pay for and for the price, it's Ok.
B005C8ENI0|5.0|loved this movie for men and woman!! and of course Mathew was in it so how could it not be good!! but overall, nice plot to it and keeps you watching

B00127RAJY|5.0|As always Jillian delivers. Sure, there's always &#34;easy&#34; parts, but you can always change it up.  You don't HAVE to do the exact same thing the actors are.  And like she says, &#34;hit the up button! grab a heavier set of weights!&#34;  A lot of truth to that.
B00CLVF2N6|5.0|This digital HD Unrated version has an absolutely beautiful picture. The unrated version really makes this version. If you don't have Blu-Ray, this is the only way you'll get it unrated. (At least for now). The story is strong and the humor very black indeed. Hansel even has diabetes because the witch made him eat so much candy when he was a little boy. One of my favorite scenes is in the beginning where they get revenge on the witch that had planned to eat them and throw her in her own oven to burn to death and little 'Gretel' says &#34;Hot enough for you now, b***h!?&#34;.<br />This may have not been a summer blockbuster but it's a very good time waster. Buy it from the digital Amazon sight and you'll enjoy every minute of it, especially when Famke Jansen makes her debut in the film as the most powerful witch around.

B00479SVBU|4.0|Only issues I have is setting up an easily browsed filing system and the remote either has a weak battery or the range sucks. I need to be at the right angle and close to the device to use it. Instructions are lacking as well, but it does seem to work well once I can find the song I am looking for. Would help if they included a visual of how to setup the 99 folders five levels deep with examples.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|In 1969, I wrote my doctoral dissertation on Old Norse literature and J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. I have, during the ensuring decades, continued my passion for all things norse, viking, and Tolkien.  A few weeks ago, the New York Times ran an article about this series. In it, the author said that the Vikings could not read or write.  I instantly wrote a letter to the editor citing the five volume complete sagas of the Icelanders sitting on my book shelf as a contradiction.  And in fact, they have been casting and reading the runes throughout this series.  I have high standards, and I have loved every second of this series from the initial sighting of lord Odin to his invocation in episode six to the pending battles with the wicked king Aella.  If you like JRRT, vikings, and things scandinavian, this series is for you, along with the Swedish Wallanders.
B00597A6NU|4.0|This movie is a historical fiction movie about the crew of the Memphis Bell bomber in WWII. It is not an action movie, but depicts life of the air crews during WWII and specifically the crew of the Memphis Belle between their 24th and 25th bomber missions.

B007N5YIUS|5.0|As you've seen in some other reviews, Angry birds space is a breath of fresh air.  I love the gravitational fields, even though the story-line is kinda weird.  By the way, if you like this game be sure to try angry birds star-wars.  Its actually cooler than you might have heard.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|great movie but the sound track missed lots of good songs but love the movie would watch many times over
B0078XFYDA|5.0|This is a great book, the second Richard Dawkins book I am reading after 'The Selfish Gene'. Unlike the latter this one isn't too technical nor biology focused. Think of it like Bill Bryson's 'A Short History of Nearly Everything' with some illustrations and a more 'English' touch to it (in terms of the language or the voice of the author).<br /><br />The first few chapters are on evolution and that's what I thought this book would be about. But it soon moves on to other topics such as Physics, Geology, Truth, and so on. I was a bit turned off by this since my expectation was this book would be about evolution, but the topics are well presented and it was good fun and informative reading them. A lot of things you learn in school - planets, spectroscopes, the earth, crust, etc - are all touched upon here. And Dawkins explains them easily without much jargon, sort of like a high level overview so you understand and appreciate what's happening, and he is nice enough to leave the techie bits out and also say at certain points that most of the techie bits don't make sense to him either but that's fine because people in that field know what's happening and so we can take their word for it.<br /><br />The illustrations by Dave McKean are good. I just wish there were more. Each chapter starts with an illustration symbolizing the topic of that chapter and they are very well done.<br /><br />Another nice touch in the book is all the myths the author starts each chapter with. Amazing to know the kind of myths around the world and it also puts your own religion/ place/ society myths in perspective. Plus it shows how dull the myths are in terms of explanations in contrast to the scientific explanation.<br /><br />This is a book everyone should read. And probably re-read when they have kids going to school and are learning such topics. And then pass on to said kids so they too appreciate their studies better. The book will help condition their view to studies and also towards science and truth/ explanations in general. As I said, the latter parts of the book (the last two chapters) are more about truth and science in general than about explaining any particular item - I find these to be a good way to round up the book and also give an idea to readers on why science and experiments really matter. (In this regard I was also reminded of a great book by Richard Feynman - 'The Meaning of it All' - whose first chapter is similar in vein. That's another great book to read, by the way!)<br /><br />Overall, a highly recommended book. Just bear in mind it's not totally evolution centric. It's about reality and that includes many more branches of science!ence and truth/ explanations in general.

B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|The story is decent, but the book is about 100+ pages longer than it needs to be. The kissing. Good gravy, there was a lot of very descriptive kissing. Far too much. And some of their conversations were so \\"deep\\" that it seemed fake. The conversations they had were written in a way very reminiscent of the Eve Dallas/Roarke characters by JD Robb. There's only so much smoosh you can take.<br /><br />The story didn't really get started until about halfway through. I'm glad I kept trudging through it because the storyline really wasn't bad.

B0052U6B0Q|4.0|I was looking at the lady's shoes online and thought the prices were a little steep, but when my boyfriend pulled up the mens I thought they'd be worth a try since the prices were all over the place. These aren't my first choice in color but  the show fits exactly as I hoped and is very comfortable with a little arch support. They feel great while running on gravel, trails, roads and anything. The sole is thick enough to absorb the hard edges of rocks while allowing you to feel the ground beneath you. They're awesome!
B002ZE85YW|5.0|Fabulous Tongue-in-cheek visual effects, Storyline is not so important since is a great entertaining Sci-Fi time-traveling saga that hasn´t been too even as a whole set of movies.... so take the good things of it, a big bowl of pop corn and have fun!

Bacteria, viruses, fungi, all the baseline microbes are here, but the game gets really interesting when you unlock the neurax parasite and the necroa (zombie) virus. Definitely worth the dollar price tag, if not more.
B00992CF6W|5.0|WARNING! HIGHLY ADDICTIVE! this game is great. I play it all the time and can almost never put down my kindle.
B00BNWWVFG|5.0|This was much better than I thought it would be with Jude Law and Catherine Zeta Jones playing very interesting parts.  It kept you interested to the end....
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|it was nice to read about how she got started but it dragged and was not as funny as i thought it would be
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I think Alien took a turn in here! The master himself who initiated the terrible saga, evolved his own cinematography into a new vision, almost art cinema in visual direction, the story takes you really back in time and explains a whole new panorama in the whole cosmovision of the saga, maybe some will detract it since it is only one lecture of what could-have-happened in the past, but doesn´t dissapoint at least for me. Beyond that I´m waiting the sequel of the prequel! and I hope Cameron, Emmerich or someone with an impulse for Sci-Fi cinema takes the ride!....
B008478VE8|5.0|My 13 year old daughter loved it and so did I. Love books that make you think. Great work and very interesting.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I have been an avid reader of the Trueblood series, as well as a faithful watcher of the television series. I was looking forward to this book for months, and to put it lightly it was horrible. I would warn fans to not even read this book because it ruins the entire series altogether. The breakup between Eric and Sookie was so matter of fact that it didnt give their budding relationship justice, and for her to end up with Sam is ridiculous. Also, this book didnt even read like the others, and there was not a one good sex scene. The only sex that occured was between Sookie and Sam and it wasnt detailed at all.... In my head and heart Sookie ended up with Eric...I hate this book and wish I would have never read it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B009JZTOG8|2.0|the story line was good but the casting was terrible! that kid couldnt act for a million backs and when he was supposed to look sad he looked perfectly fine about his mom dying
B00BZAZVV2|5.0|Loved the pace and the way the director depicted life back then. a lot has changed and they saw the changes. Wish i was born back then.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|LOVED THIS MOVIE!! LAUGH OUT LOUD FUNNY! The boyfriend and I have not had a vehicle for a while so we don't get an opportunity to go to town much, we watched this movie as a stay at home date and it was perfect!!
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I was surprised by this book. It was funny right at the very beginning. It was really entertaining. I recommend it.
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|I saw this film in Pittsburgh with the author/director giving a Q&A. When he said that he had filmed the poem from the book and only ever had intended it for the Blu-Ray, I knew I would be getting this disc. I was not disappointed.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Star rating-5<br />I found this book as well as the two previous in the trilogy, excellent. They kept me intrigued and interested until the very last page.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|If I could give this zero stars I would. I don't even know where to begin as to the deplorable value of this movie to the cause of humanity, entertainment, anything. I would like to get my $3.99 back but I have a better use for my money: remove the movie from amazon and alleviate the need for anyone to endure this B-movie. Actually I've seen better B-movies!
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. It's one of the funniest I've ever watched. I will say however that if sex and language offend you, then this movie is not for you. It's unrated for a reason. I'm going to watch it again!
0470876417|3.0|This was purchased for our managers in our group, they thought the books was insightful.  Good reading for modeling thanks
B0091REZMW|4.0|The game is fun but difficult to do well unless you are willing to purchase game tokens such as diamonds and the game controls your deen to do so.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I wanted a fast way to check the weather. Downloading this APP to my Kindle lets me check the weather quickly.
B001BKVWYG|4.0|This CD is fine but do not like it as much as Coming from Reality. I have nothing more to say.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|i'm glad that I was able to find this series on amazon because I didn't know that there was another great cop show on tv.
B007SGM084|5.0|the books were great and because I downloaded kindle for my apple, I read it right on my lap top and did not have to carry my books around.
B000LB7G00|4.0|Suits our needs for design work, ergonomic, and can be learned fairly quickly over the other mice on the market.
6305278016|4.0|Detective Nick Conklin (Michael Douglas) is under investigation for corruption. He and his partner Charlie Vincent (Andy Garcia) are having a drink in a bar when they see leading members of the local Mafia dining together with key figures in the Japanese Yakusa. Suddenly, a young Japanese bursts into the restaurant and after a violent verbal exchange with his fellow countrymen, stabs one of them. Conklin and Vincent try to capture the assailant but he escapes. When he is later captured, the two detectives are charged by their superior, Captain Oliver (John Spencer), with delivering him back to his homeland. They hand him over at Tokyo airport only to find that the `policemen' to whom he has been surrendered are bogus. The rest of this very exciting movie is about the efforts the American detectives make to recapture their suspect, evading the Japanese police (as they are acting without authority) and trying to find out what the fight in the restaurant was all about. The head of the local Yakusa claims that they do not forge counterfeit U.S. currency for profit but to repay America for the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki that produced days of `black rain' in their wake. The Japanese dialogue is given subtitles when the information is relevant. A good movie!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I can't brag this mouse up enough. You get far more than you pay for. If it was a Logitech it would cost you well over $150.<br /><br />Don't miss out on this one.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|I like the wording and musical arrangements on this CD. No more comments! Sorry but I have nothing more to say.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Fun and easy. My kids really enjoy it.  The music is nice and graphics are so pretty. Great app for the kindle fire.
B00C061I3K|4.0|I now have a Daft Punk album to listen to when I want to mellow out and calm down. Very smooth and wonderful sounding album with some great collaborations. Love love LOVE the Giorgio Moroder track!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|A coworker who's son loves legos as much as mine told me about this game and she was right. He loves building and this allows for that plus engineering and major problem solving. The fact that the characters are &#34;bad piggies&#34; makes it super fun!
B00009TB5G|5.0|The LOTR set was a gift for my son who loved them and has not had any problems with them.
B00BMT9C84|4.0|This is a very cute, funny & moving story. I liked that it shows the interaction between doting Mom and know-it-all only son, who turns to Mom for &#34;help&#34; without actually admitting it. Barbara Streisand plays her role perfectly!  It was nice to watch Seth Rogen play something other than a stoner. I recommend this as an example of believable and easy on the ears, language wise, entertainment. Enjoy! :)
B0083EY9EI|5.0|Emeli has an incredible voice. I downloaded this  on my Kindle Fire and listen to it often. I never tire of the beautiful songs.
B000000993|5.0|As a guitarist and aspiring songwriter, I respect Tool immensely as artists.  This album is great place to start to see Tool at the beginning of their career.  The songs are a little more straightforward in comparison to their later material.  However, this does not diminish the quality of the material.  Unfortunately, the genres of rock and metal have countless bands but many of them don't have anything worthwhile to say.  Tool is a band which does not come around often.  This is a band who can be musically complex and dynamic, aggressive, emotional, intelligent, and always has something worthwhile to say.  I would definitely recommend this album to anyone looking for something more from the genres of rock and metal.
B00CEIGYAG|4.0|I love the bass line on this track, and Nile Rodgers has made me want to learn how to play funk guitar! Very enjoyable listen and a nice change of direction from the over-the-top electronica that Daft Punk had been making.
B003UYUP58|5.0|This is a great book, I am really enjoying, it is very well written and although long, easy reading it
B00C4YZ12C|4.0|would give 5 stars if i could save my progress and come back to where i left off.  Am on level 65 and had to stop.  Had to restart on level one.  That being said, leveling up is very quick.  Otherwise this is the best space shooter i have ever played.  Great job developers!!!
B00499QUK2|4.0|fairly well done. Not as cliched as it could have been, characters seemed real enough. So, a rather interesting series.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Slow from the start. Picks up f or a while,then Adirondack<br /><br />Starts slowly ,then picks up, thermally<br /><br />Very slow,then it gets even slower.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I have been taking guitar lessons for several years.  Recently, I have started to write songs using a Line 6 UX1 and Garageband on my iMac.  Since I track multiple tracks (guitars, bass, drums, pianos, orchestral strings, etc), I needed to purchase a pair of recording headphones to properly adjust the volume levels of these tracks.  These headphones were recommended to me by my guitar teacher.  He told he personally uses these headphones.  In addition, my guitar teacher was recommended these headphones by a fellow guitar teacher who owns his own professional recording studio.  These headphones are phenomenal.  They cancel out the noise around me so I can properly adjust the volume levels of the multiple tracks in my songs.  I would definitely recommend these headphones to anyone who does recording whether at home or in a professional studio.
B007MDB71O|5.0|Was pleasantly surprised of the animation and plot. Family loves it. Very cool characters and scenery. I would recommend this movie to anyone.
B00C25TCZ0|5.0|I've been a long time Thin Lizzy fan and ever since I heard Black Star Riders' first single - Bonud For Glory I counted the days for this album to be released. As much as I liked that first single I must say that I did not expect the album to be as good as it is but was cautiously optimistic about it. So what do we have here? First of all I like the fact that the album was released under different name, releasing the album as Thin Lizzy with only one original member would just not be right. That being said this is as close to Thin Lizzy as anybody is ever going to get. The band obviously made conscious effort to sound like Thin Lizzy and to evoke the spirit of Thin Lizzy which may bother some people but I'm more than ok with that. At the end of the day who cares, as long as the songs are good and they are VERY good, some of them are even great. My personal favorites are: Valley Of The Stones, Bound for Glory, Kindom of the Lost. The only songs that I don't like as much as the others are Hey Judas and Kissin' the Gouund (still not bad at all). I give this effort 5 stars easily especially considering the fact that finding decent new classic hard rock music nowdays is virtually impossible.<br />To sum it all up, if you like Thin Lizzy and hard rock in general do yourself a favor and get this release.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|I had read the book before I watched the movie and to me, it didn't even come close to the book. I understand some differences due to it being a movie, but goodness you could have got the littlest details right. It was a two hour movie after all, it should have had some scenes played out better. Overall, the movie was ok. Aside from being nothing like the book, I enjoyed it.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This works great without jacking up the blade...which I did with a stone. Works on kitchen knoves to pocket. I love it.
B00B1L6B4G|4.0|Mr. Kerr is quite in keeping with noir mysteries, and he creates characters who transport us back to a time in history about which most of us know very little.  However, he does it in an interesting way, and he also creates an interesting mystery.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|It took me 6 months to read,I was determined to finish what I started. I also wanted to see what all the hype is about ....
B003SI3URQ|4.0|Enjoyable and fun for kids to supplement study of Greek mythology. Silly at times, but not good for under 5.
B000IDGBWU|3.0|but I do. And I've watched it many times over the years since it was initially released on video in 1989. There are points that make ZERO sense--but who cares? All tolled it really is a fun pseudo-musical, and a quasi-historical record of what many Americans of a certain status did ever summer. My favorite performer has to be Jane Brucker who plays Baby's tone-deaf sister Lisa; for some reason I cannot keep my eyes off her.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|I loved the story.  It was engaging, and I loved how the characters developed.  Although it was predictable, I still enjoyed it.
034580404X|5.0|Quite a series that leaves the reader wanting more.  I gave this trilogy as a present to my daughter and she loves it.
B00B7G3Y4U|1.0|Listen, I am not expecting an academy award winning film, but this was an insult to fans of the franchise. At the end when they ran the credits, I laughed at the fact that there was a screenplay writer credited. Someone put thought into this storyline? It was 10 steps back from the original. There was no thought put into this film whatsoever. It was predictable to the point of insult. It was as if they said &#34;we have your money sucker, so we are just going to phone this one in with a few jump scares and the same crap ending.&#34; Same predictable ending and scare tactics, no development of the overall franchise arc, plot holes, and a stupid ending. They could have attempted to develop a heroine with the protagonist (even if it doesn't end well for her at least let these people take some sort of action), she was cute and likeable, but instead it was the same old sheet. I honestly have never been so pissed at the end of a movie, look at my other reviews, I am usually pretty nice, but this POS had me livid. The only nice thing I have to say is the young girl and her boyfriend did a good job in their roles, they had a cute relationship.
B00A4SJ61W|5.0|My kids been wanting to see it, after watching numerous trailers.<br /><br />It's a good movie, but not worth adding to ones library.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Our 6 and 9 year old grandkids enjoyed their visit with us and this is one of the movies we rented from Amazon.  It was a winner with them.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Originally, I downloaded this game for my children.  I always test every game for them to make sure it is age appropriate.  I kept playing and playing and unfortunally, my children haven't had the pleasure to play because I cannot stop!  This game is so addictive! love it!
B000NI8F5G|5.0|Outstanding musical with an enjoyable story line, fantastic dancing by Gene Kelly,ably assisted by the comic Donald O'Connor and cute Debbie Reynolds. Gives a hint of the difficulties encountered when movies went from silent to talkies. A classic!!!
B00APJLFEG|3.0|Oy.  Another allegory of mysterious outsiders - superior and excluded because of it - representing the Jews.<br /><br />The main point is that now-a-days the rest of us aren't as evil as we used to be.  What  grace.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie, but utterly hate what's behind it.  Oh crap, that makes me a hater!
B00COGZ8FU|1.0|This was such a bore!  Tom Cruise was his usual insipid self.  I love the Jack Reacher novels, but this didn't even come close.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I find this battery indicator app as very helpful with absolutely no downside. If you've tried the free one, now's your chance to get this upgraded version. No annoying ads. More added functionality but more importantly you will always get clear animated view and breakdowns of various services you utilize on your Kindle Fire !!  :)
B00BP4WAZS|4.0|Watched it with family. Really cute movie. I was totally surprised about the storyline but enjoyed it. Quality was great too.
B004J4WKTW|1.0|Rating: Virgin<br /><br />Ahh, someone please help me out with this one. Everything about it screams that its a must read. The cover is gorgeous, they synopsis in intriguing, the reviews are excellent. So why can't I finish it? The shifting perspectives & timeline make it difficult for me to connect to the characters. I am at 42% but I keep putting it down and starting something else.<br /><br />Did you finish it? Want to send us a review? Do it! I am dying to know what's beyond 42%. Email: Bartender@thebookbar.co
B009GEAWOU|5.0|With the 9th and final season approaching, HIMYM season 8 is a must watch as all points begin to converge on the big wedding, and of course, it's full of laughs too. Absolutely recommended for any fan!
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|I expected nothing from this movie since the reviews were rather cool.<br />This is a sweet love story and the creatures really are beautiful.
B0086QS7N2|4.0|Easy to read, enjoyable.  Somewhat like a fairy tale.  Could use a little more depth, but fairy tale level is what this is.<br /><br />As a companion to the album, it's fun.  The book is based off the album, somewhat an independent work, so not necessary to read to enjoy the album.<br /><br />I actually miss reading it, may check out some more of his books.
B00005JMEW|5.0|This is a GREAT movie, it has tons of action & it's a Quentin Tarantino film, had to have it!!!
B000MVN8GK|5.0|It was awsome. I wish they had more season. It was kinda short and they left you in spence at the of the season.
0778328821|5.0|This book had me in because of the Beautiful cover. If you are a knitter you will understand. I was not prepared for the characters that totally had me transfixed. If you read this book, you will want to read the rest of the series in fact you won't be able to help yourself.
B00932A4XE|3.0|I thought this movie would be more about the dad's club. The preview seemed to focus on the group of accepting and supporting father's club. Turned out to be more about the whole families involved. More touching and less hilarious than I was expecting. Still, an OK movie!
B00BY1F8UQ|5.0|Five VIRTUOSIC Stars.  Jazz Trio Excellence! \\"The Standards Trio\\" of piano icon Keith Jarrett, inventive bassist Gary Peacock, and drum master Jack DeJohnette is in outstanding form in this 2009 concert recorded live in Lucerne Switzerland.  It's been over 30 years since this most highly-influential trio began playing together as a unit in live and recorded  'summit meetings' to critical and popular acclaim.  Each performance is wonderful and the 'best of the best' begins with the beautiful 'solo piano to trio' reading of \\"Deep Space/Solar\\" with marvelous solos from Jarrett and Peacock over DeJohnette's percussive commentary. \\"Stars Fell on Alabama\\" and \\"I Thought About You\\" get the mellow, inventive Jarrett ballad treatment with great support from Peacock and DeJohnette. \\"Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea\\" and \\"Tonight\\" are swinging, off-kilter performances. And perhaps best of all the amazing bolero-like vamps surrounding the 19 minute convergence of \\"Somewhere/Everywhere\\", which gets a roaring ovation. These are 'killer' performances with highly-intuitive trio interaction and solos, recorded on the pristine ECM soundscape in front of an enthusiastic audience, by one of the greatest jazz trios in history which seems to get better with each 'new' time-lagging ECM vault offering. My Highest Recommendation! Five LYRICAL Stars. (6 tracks; Time: 65 minutes: 33 seconds )
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Another home run hit out of the park.  His description of the action is superb and thrilling, to say the least.  Enjoyed every moment!
B00005JMUA|5.0|What can I say about this movie, I believe that two words will sum it up, Quentin Tarantino, enough said :)
B002Y0TGOU|4.0|Very good reboot.  The new actors do a great job of inhabiting such iconic characters, and the special effects are top notch.
B008YU0AOE|3.0|It gets the job done. For a free calculator it does what it is suppose to and thats all you could ask for. Its not the greatest but it works.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game. It is very fun and addictive. Well worth every penny I spend on it. Play it every night before bed.
B00BXUG0KU|5.0|\\"I Thought About You (A Tribute to Chet Baker)\\" captures the famed jazz master pianist & vocalist Eliane Elias and friends, which includes drummer Victor Lewis and her husband, bassist Marc Johnson, both of whom actually played with the legendary 'cool jazz' trumpeter/singer. The group also has Steve Cardenas on electric guitar, Oscar Castro-Neves on acoustic guitar, Rafael Barata on drums, Marivaldo Do Santos on percussion, and Randy Brecker on trumpet/flugelhorn on 3 tracks, all in various combinations. Elias plays some of the most memorable songs associated with jazz Hall of Famer Baker's storied career. The 'best of the best' begins with a stirring performance of \\"I Thought About You\\" with Eliane's smoky 'voice as an instrument' phrasing and sizzling piano solo. \\"This Can't Be Love\\" swings hard with interesting rhythmic breaks. Brecker's theme intro and solo on \\"That Old Feeling\\" is impressive, as is Eliane's vocal phrasing and piano solo. And perhaps best of all, the tempo-shifting \\"There Will Never Be Another You\\" featuring more hot solos from Eliane and Randy Brecker and, at the recording's end, Eliane alone with her mellow voice and reflective piano on a moving version of \\"I Get Along Without You Very Well\\". This is a great performance by Eliane Elias and friends which is a fitting tribute to Chet Baker that is sincere appreciation, not imitation: beautifully recorded and produced by Eliane, Marc, and Steve Rodby. Highly Recommended. Five IMPRESSIVE Stars!  (14 tracks; Time: 54 minutes; 47 seconds)
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Just to listen to Mark Twain use the southern dialect needed to make the characters come alive is worth reading this incredible piece of literature.  His use of the English language common at the time of the story is worthy of praise alone.  I had to use a dictionary at times to keep up with him.  His ability to paint word pictures  is so dramatic and accurate, while maintaining a comedic flavor is totally amazing.  I never thought reading a children's book could be so interesting, thrilling, entertaining, and educational all at the same time.  This needs an updated movie version to bring more people back in touch with this great American author.  I started &#34;Huck Finn&#34; as soon as I finished &#34;Tom Sawyer&#34;, and I love that too.  I enjoy it so much, I read it out loud.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I passed this book up many times but decided to read it because it was a best seller for so long.  I really enjoyed it and its unexpected twists.  I will look for more books by this author as I like her style.  I was sorry when it was over!
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This game has great graphics and isnt complicated to play. my toddler likes it as much as I do! I only wish that pearls were easier to come by, but that's how all these games are.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|This book is perfect!! I absolutely love it(: I read it in less than a day I couldn't put if down !!
030746363X|3.0|This book seems ok, but I didn't make sense to eat healthy all week then have a cheat DAY. I have heard of a cheat meal, but not a cheat day.  And then to basically gain a whole bunch of weight in one day and then keep losing it in like a week.  Doesn't seem like a good idea to me.  The basics on what to eat for weight loss seems legit.  I haven't read the rest of the book other than the incredible sex part.  Some of the positions are helpful lol
B0091REZMW|4.0|I am enjoying the game mainly. I do not much like being in the dark in the rooms.  would give it five stars except for that.  I like the music a lot .  The game is fun and  not to easy and not to hard.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|This is my first Adele CD and I will be adding other's to my collection. Her voice is a rare one and lovely to listen to.
B00CXX8KTA|5.0|Well, expectations from the band were clear as Scott Gorham had indicated that the Thin Lizzy sound will be present in the album (as respect for Phil Lynott the band at the last minute decided not to release this offering under the Thin Lizzy banner).<br /><br />It doesn't seem to sound much like a Lizzy album on the title song `All Hell breaks loose' a nice rocker with a good riff . Good song with Ricky Warwick not sounding much like Phil Lynott, but all that changes with the next song `Bound for Glory' which starts very similar to early Lizzy number `South Bound', Phil's influence on Ricky's vocals and lyrics is very evident. The guitar work by Scott and Ricky (I guess) is totally reminiscent of the early Thin Lizzy dual guitar work. A great song in spite of it's the derivative nature.<br /><br />`Kingdom of the lost' seems to be the bands effort to do a Roisin Dubh (Black Rose) with clear Irish influences and similar structuring, though in no way similar to the original.`Bloodshot' is another song one could attribute as an average Lizzy song.<br /><br />The influence of Phil Lynott is though out the album... at times in the vocals, some times in the lyrics and also in the song arrangements... well the later can be expected as Scott is still the riff man.`Kissing the ground you walk on' is a good rocking number with the rhythm quite different to a normal Lizzy song.`Hey Judas' starts like a slower Lizzy number and moves to arrangements that are not common for Lizzy but the unmistakable vocal style keep one aware of the influences.<br /><br />`Hoodoo voodoo' is a boogie rocker with Ricky at times trying a slightly different vocal angle (Billy Gibbons maybe) and the band sounds a bit different but there are still many similarities to Lizzy tucked in the song.With a `Cold Cold Sweat' sounding start `Valley of the Stone' is probably the most rocking number with some classic guitar hooks.`Blues ain't so bad' is a wonderful bluesy song; uncannily it feels like Phil's singing the blues.<br /><br />Over all a good album for nostalgic Thin Lizzy fans as this album is very close to the Thin Lizzy sound we are all accustomed to. Now the question is should a singer copy his idol so much that he sounds totally like him, I really cannot answer that but this album does brings back memories of the great work by Thin Lizzy and is a great tribute to the band.<br /><br />If one were to not compare this album with Thin Lizzy and take it just on its own value I would say it's a cool `Rocker' (pun intended) and like a breath of fresh air (despite it's somewhat lack of originality) in the current rock scene. A real nostalgic trip for us oldies with thundering guitar hooks, melodic solos and melancholy vocals that we sorely miss in the current scene.<br /><br />Go for it or else miss some real cool rock n roll....
B003O86FMW|5.0|I am so emotionally charged right now! I'm so confused right now I just need to go get the third book and hide in my room for a day or two.
0062059963|5.0|This book was one of the best books that I have ever read, I read the selection and waited for the elite to come out and I am beyond happy with the results, the only bad thing about the book is that I now have to wait a year for The One... Kierra Cass you're killing me!
B00899F0G8|5.0|I absolutely love this show.  One of my favorites!  It keeps you on edge and makes you want to know who the flip A is!!!
B006TVQU6C|4.0|This was my first build and I really liked the case. The case was spacious and easy to cable manage. The only problem that I had was that the front panel ports are all connected to the front panel. Whenever I wanted to lift the front panel, I had to make sure I didn't pull on the wires connecting to the ports. Installing a front fan was a bit difficult because of this.
B0043WHUGS|5.0|Eash time I watch this and sing a long, I enjoy it as if the first time! Glad I bought it!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I have read the series countless times.  Very easy reads that never get boring.  Books two and three are my favorite!!!!
B000I8G5GW|5.0|When I come back to movies I have fond memories of, those memories are often dashed (Peter Sellers in the Pink Panther movies come to mind here). This not only held up, but it was still a great experience. Good story line. Great acting. You name it. Well deserving of its classic status.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|Cool and im 10 or 11 in a week and I FELT like a horrible person NOT to get this Free games
1452115567|1.0|This is really just a picture book and not a book describing a year-long road trip taken by a man and his dog, which is what I was expecting. The first few pages are text but the rest are all pictures.<br /><br />The book is titled &#34;A Super Serious Project About Dogs and Physics&#34; but there is virtually no discussion about dogs or physics in the book.
B00321MGPG|5.0|Makes you understand how amazing this Planet is with it's rich variety in life.  Motivates you to do your part and protect its valuable beauty.
1433502410|5.0|Great value and great Bible. Love the English Standard Translation. Very accurate and when you read this Bible you won't want to stop. Hard back is very sturdy.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This book had me yearning to be in Oxford. The characters and the scenery draw you in and make it difficult to put this book down. Highly recommend for a fun escape.
1419381032|5.0|I purchased this for a gift for my wife and she loved it, Dana Gabaldon is execellent.  I reccommend this.
B00B2G2RG6|2.0|This was very intense and too gruesome to continue watching.  I watched the first few and liked the plot idea but couldn't handle the intensity.
B006885EFE|5.0|What can I say other than I was so moved by the acting and tribute paid the these couragious men and the sacrifices they made for our freedom.........................
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This is the best fps I've found on the kindle so far and for such a good price love the weapons and the missions are just the right length
B005K17RU0|1.0|this app was great before the update. I don't need the hourly temp and all that extra crap. I used to love the nice large 7day forecast at a glance. and if I needed more info I could click on it. why do u ruin things with updates.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|If you live horses you will love this game. You get to take care of them. feed them, bath them and every thing
B0057R5XRG|5.0|This is an excellent movie collection. I really enjoyed it very much. Now I can watch it everyday with my family.
1616550414|5.0|Seriously this book is amazing. The illustrations are wicked sweet and it looks totes awesome sitting on a coffee table or something. 10/10 would reccommend
B00ADS98FC|5.0|I love the comedy and music...it makes me laugh every time!  I've never watched a movie more than I've watched Pitch Perfect!!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I loved this book ! I was engaged and thrilled throughout this book. The characters  are interesting and the concept, once accepted,is unique . I didn't think the book was very deep but I also couldn't put it down. I've read it three times.
B0087ITBPC|1.0|This is a terrible film and it is terrible because of Ms Striesand. Trying to pass as a menopausal mid fifties yenta is pathetic. She is in her seventies! Filmed through gauze and vaseline smeared lenses it is a vanity project without redeeming features and even Rogen cant save it. It is not funny. It does not enlighten or illuminate. It is just Babs chewing the scenery and trying to pass for fifty. Poor Seth Rogen. Avoid this mess at all cost. If I could give less than one star...I would
0689877692|5.0|I don;t know how long it will last in a house full of kids but all the grownups had to read it!
B00000JNNY|5.0|Quality is very good and I am glad I decided to buy it.  Would recomment it to my friends who love Etta Music.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Totally boring. Lack of action & drama. Only 2 characters in the narrative which leads to falling asleep while trying to read this waste of time.
B003V1WTMM|3.0|I absolutely loved Kate Morton's The Forgotten Garden.  This one, however, left me pretty disappointed.  For starters, it took probably 200 pages just for me to get moderately interested in the story.  The only reason I stuck with it was because I loved The Forgotten Garden so much.  If this had been my first Morton book, I probably would have put it down never to pick up another.<br /><br />Once I became interested in what happened, it did pick up.  I enjoyed the latter half of the book.  A good third of it could probably be omitted entirely - just way too much description and not enough action.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|Love it and my kids love it too. Wish they had more tanks though. Or maybe one really big super tank!
B00A3T5CGU|5.0|I downloaded this app and it works flawlessly. I have not had any issues with navigation. I don't understand why people are saying it is difficult to use. Great product, thank you and keep up the good work.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|So glad I decided to install this game.  It feels like I'm playing dungeon siege.  I wish there was more different weapons and armor to get while you level.  I also wish the weapons had elemental effects when you put fire or ice gems in them.  All in all I can't complain it's a great game. The game has great graphics, Although I wish the view was not so close at times. I like playing the archer and further distance of view would be better at times.  I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes rpgs.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|i love this game it has lots of maps and lots of vehicles very fun (hint: best map is moon)
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|A lot of the same cast in this movie from Knocked Up.  Lots of good comedy but definitely not for younger children.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Fun family movie - Our whole family enjoyed this movie (from oldest who is 12 down to youngest who is 5 years old).
B00BSBXA98|5.0|I didn't get to see it on the big screen but even on our flat screen I was drawn into it. I felt I was on a journey into the life of water, music and whimsy. I would highly recommend this amazing production and thanks to the film makers for making it possible for me to experience it right in my own home! I can't wait to show it to my grandsons!
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I love this movie. I wish it had some more of that old school sci-fi to it, but that doesn't stop it from being very good.
B0072NWJRK|5.0|This is more than a mystery, it's a snapshot of a time and place when politics, war and power overwhelmed a man whose innocent daughter was gruesomely murdered. As civil war rages between Chinese Nationalists and Mao's Communist forces, Japan is waiting not so secretly in the wings to overwhelm the city. Living in the city are the remnants of decadent European powers still separated into their own little domain as well as gangsters, soldiers and exiled White Russians, all desperate people. At the base of a tower considered haunted by the natives, Pamela, a young Englishwoman is found viciously murdered. The investigation of the death is mired down in questions of jurisdiction and authority as the city holds its breath for Peking to fall. I'm haunted by this book in the best possible way.
B0047WJ12K|4.0|I won't go over the plot because it is already well covered in many other places, but will just give an overall review of the tone and pace of the movie. The storying is very intriguing, and, like a lot of complex movies these days, it can be difficult to follow unless you are ready, willing, and able to follow the plot very carefully. It is a good dinner movie to watch with good friends, but not necessarily a movie to watch with people who are used to a slower-paced movie or a movie with fewer intricate ideas. Watch with sci-fi friends or friends who like complex plots, and then you are guaranteed to have fun. Good filming, great acting, great plot for those who like complexity!
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Kids enjoyed this  - Our 10 and 5 year really liked this movie (girl and boy). We recommend it for family viewing.
B00CFQN12Q|2.0|Has action but story line and cinematography are poor. Look somewhere else for a story, although Bruce Willis carries the film.
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|Glad I was able to find these on-line. Could not find in the stores anymore and camera is still in good shape.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Just when you think you know what's coming, you are wrong. Makes you think twice about your first love. Amen.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|The story lines are complex enough ( especially with any flashbacks ) that I'm sure I will see now things the second time around.  I love that the villans are complex and have back stories.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|Fantastic movie and music - I think the soundtrack to this movie was wonderful and the story line was fun too.
B0097K21YW|2.0|I found this game to be too simple and actually quite boring. Don't think I will be wasting too much more time with it.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|A very well done picture, that truly deserves it's best picture rating.  The drama is intense, the action will have you on the edge of your seat.  From beginning to end, I can't remember a single &#34;slow&#34; spot.  One of Ben Affleck's better movies.
B009SCRERI|5.0|This is a good kid movie and it's able to hold my attention as well. It's great when you can watch a movie with your child and you can be entertained too.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|One of the few reads where I have finished and felt the floor drop.  This novel has so much to say about the world we live in and is so wonderfully well written from Jacks perspective. Well done!
B00846REIS|3.0|Too much like fifty shades of gray but lacking class some of the class. I do plan on reading the third book.
B004MC0FO8|4.0|Name that tune app.  Works most of the time. Need 11 more words for some reason so here they are.
B00005NVDF|5.0|I can watch this movie over and over again and still laugh as hard as the first time I saw it back in the 70's.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|Never was much of a &#34;Trekkie&#34; when I was younger. I originally only wanted to see this movie when it first came out in 09 to see how much better it was than all the original ones. After seeing it again before I go see the newest one it was still just as good as the first time I saw it. It's a good movie with great action and can't wait to see the new one now
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|Great fun movie that is meant for the whole family. With enough references to satisfy the gamers. I wish they could have expanded more on these &#34;worlds&#34; but they tackled the usual genres. Highly recommended.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|It has me addicted, even at work I find myself playing. Fantastic strategy game. Reminds me of Age of Empires, great interface and often updated.
B00COGZ8FU|2.0|Not a great use of my time. Boring...Tom cruise needs to stick to sci fi. The acting was stiff and it was poorly cast.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This story made me want to cry.  It was very well written, and I am excited to read it from Holder's POV.
B008602KQI|4.0|i was hesitant to watch the movie bc i had really liked the books.. i was pleasently surprised and look forward to the next one!
B00BI73CVI|4.0|I don't normally don't like musicals but this movie was well done. If you don't know much about musicals be prepared everyone line is sung by the actors. Who knew Russel Crowe could sing?
B00CS65JS2|4.0|Doesn't have the same party mood as Discovery, but it is a good chill album (good for work, study, hanging out, etc). I dig the strings they have in there too.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|awesome, it was a great animated movie. It was age appropriate and would be willing to watch something very similar if asked.
B001GCUO5W|5.0|In all the confusion throughout the film, one thing is consistently clear: this movie is brilliant. The quality visually on blu ray is top quality and the storyline follows such. A must add!
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|I got this for my child, recommended from the k12 school.<br />Its a great demo, then we got other paid minecraft games.<br />Hours and hours of fun.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book was the recent choice in our book club and I had the privilege of chairing the discussion group with our book club.  Although certain people were dwelling a bit too much on the sadness of the ending, I felt totally different about it. There was no choice for the mother but to do what she did ...to save him...and all his future victims.  A lot of hereditary issues came to the surface and are still food for thought.  I felt for his parents, having been the parent of a bi-polar child (who luckily didn't suffer the same fate).  Their emotions were raw and I could totally relate to them.
B008Q00BOQ|2.0|I watched for 30 minutes hoping for something, anything, to develop. No plot, no character development. Two stars for the nice looking people and sets. Where's the movie?
B003R50FRI|5.0|I loved every minute of this book. Could not put it down. Having recently been to Bombay I could relate to the places mentioned. It gave me a clearer insight into Indian life especially the part when he was working as a doctor in the slums.  It was also very informative about the workings of the mafia in Bombay and the war in Afghanistan. Would love to read a follow up if he ever writes one.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was recommended to me and I am so happy that it was recommened.  Shocking story but really a good read.
0143038419|4.0|This is a book that makes you think.  If you're introspective at all you'll find it to be a good read.
B009NY43NY|2.0|The whole book feels like what should have been the last chapter of book 12.  None of the suspense of previous books.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|Very good movie.  Great cast!  Runs the gamut of emotions...funny, touching, a little sad.  And not just a chick flick.  I know a lot of men who have loved it!
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|We enjoy playing this game, but feel frustrated that it is nearly impossible to meet goals without purchasing additional currency. Disney/Pixar is not a small, struggling company. Perhaps they would be better served by using this game to make people feel good about the Nemo brand in advance of the new movie, rather than nickel-and-diming folks out of their movie budgets.
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|Poor Tom. I love CATS. This game is not fun.<br />I am not understanding the point of the game.<br />Sad!
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|ESPECIALLY IF YOU WANT TO KILL TIME AND JUST SEEM LIKE YOU ARE ACTUALLY DOING SOMETHING PRODUCTIVE... LIKE WHEN WAITING ON DR'S OFFICE TO CALL YOUR NAME... OR SETTING AT A TABLE WITH LAME PPL.. YEAH.
B004J4WN0I|4.0|I've read all but the latest novella from Hearne. I enjoy his method of incorporating ancient gods and characters of myth into an urabn fantasy setting. As one who has studied myth, I appreciate that Hearne makes use of the actual gods and goddesses and their history rather than fabricating a character/backstory to his liking loosely based on the originals (which seems a common trope these days- why reinvent the wheel?). That said, I do not find Atticus a likable protagonist. He's too much of a frat boy marty stu for my tastes, and Hearne's gore galore descriptions of battle scenes do not apeal to me. Overall I enjoy the series enough to keep reading them, and would reccomend them (with the above disclaimer) to avid Urban Fantasy fans such as myself.
B008EKOO46|4.0|It's good to look at the \\"living\\"history to reflect on choices we have made personally as well as a society. Diamond again uses his unique ability of framing to  highlight the differences we can make by choosing a different path.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I started reading the first book in the series by accident and immediately was pulled into the series.  Archer's writting style puts the reader right into the book.  You can feel the struggle and the victories of each character.  You can relate that both the faults and the good points of the characters as well.  Archer leaves the reader with enough tension and mystery to want to keep reading the next page, chapter, and book!  I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good read.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|The first time I heard the music, I loved it!<br />The music makes me feel good. I want smile and dance!!!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is truly amazing and everyone whose anyone should put their noses in it.<br />Jeff Kinney is an amazing author and I can't wait for the next book to come out.
B00COHIFQS|3.0|I'm glad I waited for the movie to come out on dvd to rent. I absolutely love the way this movie begins. Then after that it just turns into a mediocre film. It wasn't frightening at all. I was waiting for the big surprise and it NEVER came. The story line was strange and it ended in such a bad unexpected way. I recommend this movie when there's nothing better to watch.
B000002LFZ|3.0|This was purchased for friends celebrating 25 years of marriage...this was music from &#34;their era&#34; and they liked it.  I did not listen to the CD.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|This game is so fun and the cartoons are so cute I just love om nom so much and he's so cute. Get the app today!!!
B00364K6YW|5.0|Loved the simpler time period when lovers left it to our imagination. GREAT movie for the family and especially the ladies.
B00973902K|5.0|east to find and purchase on amazon<br />music - upbeat and fun<br />great for exercising<br />great summer song<br />reminds me of going to the beach
B00COHIFQS|3.0|A twist on a ghost story, but overall it was pretty flat.  Aside from a some &#34;gotcha&#34; scares the story was bland.  I am not sure how this crazy of a story could come off a bit boring.  If you like horror movies take a peak, but don't expect it to blow you away.<br /><br />On a side note:<br />Nikolaj...whatever his name is...Jamie Lannister... should be in more movies.  He is simply cool.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book was awesome. This author really nailed it. Perfect combination of plot, sex, and torment. I absolutely loved it and will be recommending this to my friends.
B000OYC3J8|5.0|I am such a Jack White Fan!!  I feel he is so talented..  I want to see him live...  Come to Upstate New York!
0800141660|5.0|Loved this classic, clean movie for its tenderness and classical love theme. This movie is great for the entire family but especially the ladies.
B00AF7Z44K|5.0|Merlin is one of my favorite shows. I spent the better part of a year looking for season three in the stores, such as Walmart, Shopko, Target, Hastings and Best Buy, before I finaly wised up and looked here, on amazon, for it. When I searched for the product I was exstatic to see it come up emediatly, and even more over joyed to see that it was in stock. I ordered the product and it arrived in my mail box quicker than I had expected. I now own Merlin seasons 1-5 and my collection would have a huge gap in it with very important information to the series being missing without this purchase being made. Thank you so much for ending my search!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|A story that combines magic, love, friendship, intrigue, and devotion. I loved every page and will undoubtedly read it again.
B005EGXNLS|2.0|I've read all of the previous books in this series and enjoyed them well enough, though I thought I would scream if Cornwell explained the protagonist's derogatory nick name AGAIN (which he did, repeatedly in every book just in case we missed it the first 20 times).<br /><br />All that I can really say about this book is that I finished 80% of it and forgot that I was reading it. Was it good, was it bad, how did it compare- I don't remember. I found it utterly, surprisingly forgettable.
B00AAQWMB4|5.0|I enjoy this game quite a bit.  It is fun as a time killer, and yet it is challenging enough to require some thought at the same time.
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|I was not at all impressed as with the other Lord of the Rings movies.  It was so 'regular' that it took me all day to watch it.  It came very close to being down right boring and I kept pausing it to go do other things.  Very disappointing. I would not pay over $5 for this DVD if given the chance again.
B009KNPNT6|5.0|Forgive me if I overlooked it, but no one seemed to mention Yvonne Elliman's beautiful rendition of \\"I Can't Find My Way Home\\". I saw this band at the Philly Spectrum in '76 (I think) and except for the strange character near me who kept yelling, \\"PLAY WHIPPING POST!\\", while giving Eric the finger with both hands, it was one of the greatest concerts of my life. A few months later he came out with a new album that garnered little attention but I loved it. It was a nice, laid back companion to 461, the aptly titled, \\"There's One In Every Crowd\\".<br />This record is a must have for people who loved that band. So much new material and SACD recordings are so rare these days. For $20, a tremendous value.
B00CRWJ7VC|3.0|I understand that this movie spans across several time periods.  However, I fail to understand it.  How do all these &#34;stories&#34; relate?  I would have to watch this 20 times at least to even have an inkling of what the movie is about.
B00499QUK2|5.0|Love the wit and mystery.  If you've read any of the Sherlock Holmes book, they will be brought to life watching these episodes.
B00BTJMS1A|4.0|Fun little game to play when you have time.  However, it does get a little repetitive after a while though.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Lo Imposible - One family's true story of survival<br />Spanish disaster drama directed by Juan Antonio Bayona and written by Sergio G. Sánchez.<br />Ewan McGregor as Henry and Naomi Watts as Maria were excellent in this movie.<br />It was as if you were traveling along with their family to the beautiful island<br />and through the tragedy of the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami .<br />Tom Holland also does an excellent job as Lucas the oldest son who helps<br />his injured mother find help.Heart wrenching and heart warming.<br />The ending is worth the wait!<br />Nothings more powerful than the human spirit.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|I enjoyed this booked very much. He intertwined a couple story lines that all made sense once you got farther into the book.
B00AYR2FPM|3.0|The album sleeve was ripped on both sides which sucks. I will probably never buy an album from Hastings again. Phosphorescent is amazing though.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I like it because it intertans you but its not cheap it should be 99 cents I think we should wait till the have a another sale.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I really enjoy this kind of game, it's a matching and puzzle game combined.  The story line is cute but not really necessary.
B002RRWWQ4|4.0|This is the first of the 8 films that I truly loved. They did a great job with all of the last three.
0061906220|5.0|He loves to read this book every night. It helps him learn colors and Pete the Cat has a awesome song we sing together.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Watched the film in IMAX 3D, glued to the chair for the entired duration, including the final credits just because a sense of feeling of wanting more.<br /><br />This was one of the most entertaining film that I have seen in recent years, the sights, the special effects, the sound and what was unexpected when I walked into the theater was the acting, very emotional and quite moving through out the story.<br /><br />Well done and can not wait for the next installment, hope to get my copy of the Blu-ray soon.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Good game' but the progress is slow and you need investment points to make it worthwhile which cost money.....instructions could be clearer from the beginning.
B00CW665VI|4.0|Synopsis:<br /><br />Drew is your typical top-of-the-food-chain playboy with a no nonsense, tell it like it is attitude. He is the best at everything and is used to getting everything he wants. Women are nothing more than a release to him and love doesn't even factor into his thoughts. Until he sees her. She is the most beautiful thing he has ever seen and the most intriguing. She doesn't fall at his feet begging to go home with him, she walks away. Little does he know, she is just starting a new job at his firm. Things are about to get interesting.<br /><br />Review:<br /><br />I decided to read this book based upon the rave reviews it was getting. The fact that it is written from a man's perspective is great. And the fact that he isn't an angsty romantic, but a total guy in all of his glory is even better. I laughed my ass off reading this book. The fact that so many of my friends are male and I happen to know that they think exactly like Drew, made it even funnier. In fact, I think I have actually heard a few of these lines before in real life.<br /><br />The characters in this book are funny and play their parts well. I loved Drew. Not because of his looks or status or anything ridiculous like that, but because he was real and didn't apologize for it. Men just aren't men like they used to be, and it's nice to read a character like this, even if he does have his slappable moments. Kate is one tough cookie and I loved that. She wasn't a lay down and take it type of girl. She is strong and independent and fights to get hers. I loved that she wasn't portrayed as weak even once in this book. The supporting cast is great as well.<br /><br />The relationship between Drew and Kate develops nicely. There is a definite attraction, but it isn't love at first sight. They have a love/hate thing going on and its pretty hilarious. I also have to mention that this book has some pretty hot sex scenes. One in particular was one of the sexiest I've read.<br /><br />I really wanted this to be a 5-star book, but I wouldn't feel right rating it above a 4. Don't get me wrong, it is great, but there was a piece missing. I can't really put my finger on it. With all that said, this was a pretty great debut for Emma Chase. I will definitely be following her future work. READ IT!this to be a 5-star book, but I wouldn't feel right rating it above a 4. Don't get me wrong, it is great, but there was a piece missing. I can't really put my finger on it. With all that said, this was a pretty great debut for Emma Chase. I will definitely be following her future work. READ IT!
B00CHIMG6Y|3.0|First, I don't mean to belittle the magnatude of this event at all by my review of the movie. That said, I really didn't like this movie at all. I watched most of it fast forward, partially to get to the plot points and partially to skip over the many gross images. Not sure what I was expecting, but this wasn't it. It is a very well acted movie and the visuals appear to be true to life. Just wish I hadn't rented it. :-/
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|I have purchased all the twilight series on dvd's as didn't get time to see the movies in person and now am able to enjoy watching them at my leasure.
B0089LOG02|3.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. And then towards the end it felt like the author hurried to complete it. It was rushed at the end. And there is a part in the book that makes no sense to me.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I think it is really addicting. Most of the time, if I set down my Kindle, come back 15 minutes later, and I'll have twice as much coins than I did before. So the whole IAP isn't to bad with me.
193700788X|1.0|This book is just plain terrible. I am extremely disappointed with Charlaine Harris and her choice to hastily and sloppily put this series to an end. With every turn of the page I got a little more angry for investing so much time in the Southern Vampire Mysteries. I wouldn't recommend this series to anybody.
1476734941|5.0|I jumped on this book as soon as I discovered it.  The science and logic are solid. And I can say that I have had great success following it.  In fact I see it as a diet for life.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|different themes awesome action. I hope they continue to make another series but ultimately make a movie. If you love SN<br />then you'll  appreciate how the  they get out of situations in this series.
B00CFOXBX2|1.0|not happy with this at all wish i could have my money back and the time i wasted watching this
B006VFLIYK|5.0|An  assasin  for our govt. has begun to question his &#34;humanity&#34;. When he refuses to carry out an assignment and crosses paths with a young lady who is on &#34;the run&#34; , he not only regains  his belief in himself but in his purpose.<br /><br />I found this to be an excellent read.
B0082Z447U|4.0|I was at first discouraged after starting this book that is was written in the old proper English. Because of the high ratings I saw this novel received, I decided to labor on. By the fourth page I was hooked and couldn't put it down. A wonderful mystery unfolds with lots of twists and curiosities. The way it is written with the different characters submitting their own narratives adds an interesting perspective and intrigue. I was entertained until the last page.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris Kyle was an amazing seal.  This book is very well written and exciting to read. I found it to be a real page turner, and had many rough mornings at work due to my inability to stop reading the night before.  American Sniper has a unique style that makes you feel like you are sitting down with Chris sharing war stories.  He takes you from his growing up years all the way through training and his multiple tours in Iraq.  He was an amazing American, man, and patriot.  It is really sad a points in this beek when Chris talkes about his family and how much he loves them considering his final fate back home in the States.  Your only regret will be when you finish the last page.
B00CRQV1TY|2.0|I gotta say that most of the songs on this album have already reached their \\"perfection\\" 40-some years ago. There was a strange wind, unusual vibes, other-worldly layers going on during those times and the music seemed to spring from perfection and remain in perfection. I don't want to hear any other versions of them on a CD. In someone else's concert, maybe. But I've already bought them once, and they have been seared into my memory banks, into my very cells, and I can't stand to hear them over again in a lesser fashion.<br /><br />At 68, John Fogarty should not be geniused out. Maybe he's never changed -- that would be sad. Maybe he never deepened, grew, learned, matured into the new and the thrilling? Maybe he lost confidence. I don't know. What I do know is he is selling us the same old stuff under a different label. I won't put my money down.
B00C90T4QK|5.0|I have a few of his cd's and I really like listening to his music.  Would like to see him in concert sometime.
0765325950|5.0|Some Spoilers Included!<br /><br />Overall great end to the series.  Did it answer all questions and end all plot  lines completely? No, and it couldn't/shouldn't have, neither should we have expected it to. To do so would have been like Rand vision of the world without the Dark One, empty, bland and very Ghostly Hollowsish. People are still going to suffer, lives continue on in their messy way.  Besides, Jordan loved to watch his fans anquish over small plot lines, why should that end in the last book? He's smiling down on us still laughing at his fans' attempt to fully understand his world. I personally liked the fight between Rand and the Shadow, it was the final evoluton of his charachter, without which he would not be able to understand the reason why the Dark One should not be killed. I love how Mogheidean ended up, although, Fain's ending seemed somewhat bland.  I still don't get why Siuan/Gareth/Egwene ended up as they did, but that is war, messy and without remorse.  Great Series, I'm kinda relieved its over just so I can move on from something I have been invested in since Junior High School. But it is a satisfied relief.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I enjoy the side puzzles. The graphics are pretty good. I haven't been playing long enough to comment on the story line.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|This is a great movie and I love to watch it.I bought it for my grand children to watch with me.
B005QJZ5FA|4.0|I love Lana Del Rey's voice, and she has such a unique style.  Some of her songs really stand out, and this is a good CD overall.  Born to Die is probably my favorite song of all Lana Del Rey's music.
B003B02O14|4.0|I liked this one because it wasn't the standard Grisham legal fare in a different wrapper. The last few Grisham books, in my opinion, For those of you, like me, who thinks Grisham's books were getting a little stale with the same basic theme, &#34;Small firm or entry-level big firm lawyer risks life and limb defending the little guy and taking on giant multi-national corporation, etc etc...,&#34; this novel might be worth your time.<br /><br />Our main character in The Partner is, in true Grisham fashion, a young attorney slaving away trying to climb the ladder in his firm when a terrible and fiery car crash claims his life. Where this story varies from the typical Grisham is that the lead character is essentially a criminal himself, albeit one who designs an elaborate plan of stealing from high ranking, corrupt officials by out scheming the schemers -  the story, for the most part, is not centered around legal maneuverings as much as it is about a lonely guy whose life lacks meaning trying to change things for the better. A failing marriage, a career he doesn't enjoy, corrupt bosses, financial hurdles. He finds meaning in an unconventional way and the story unfolds with &#34;only in a Grisham&#34; suspense and detail. Throw in a devoted love interest, unforeseen plot twists, and a dazzling ending, and you have the best Grisham effort in several years.
B001N3GUIE|4.0|great cast, but I thought the original play was better than the screenplay.<br />I'd give the Tempest a higher rating, being Shakespeare's farewell to<br />sci-fi.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft pocket edition is a good choice for kids to have fun with the game. The game is silent and is good luck with your kids
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Proper size to carry two DSLRs with lenses and all necessary accessories for one day landscaping photography.  It won't let you feel a burden when you carry it.  Nice design and plenty of compartments make the management of your DSLRs, lenses, and accessories easy.  I'd rather have this practical backpack than the one with luxury look when I travel and photography in foreign countries.<br /><br />As Amazon always do: a prompt and promised shipping.  Good product! I am happy with it and looking forward to seeing more products with Amazon name.
B00CL50LEC|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie even though it was a bit predictable. It was basically exactly what I expected from watching the trailer and I really liked that. It was a good movie to just watch because you didn't really have to think about it. The two main characters acted really well during their roles. The movie dragged a bit at parts, but the rest of the movie made up for it. I would very well recommend this movie.
B0018OFN4U|5.0|This has to be the funniest movie I've seen and I've seen a lot of movies! It's thrilling and so entertaining! This is on my top 3 movies. It has a great cast and great plot. Very well done. It's a must see movie!
B00127RAJY|5.0|The workouts in this video are incredible. I am always dripping with sweat afterwards. I feel a huge difference in my endurance since starting these workouts.
B0082SU98U|5.0|Well at end the book brings tears so enjoy<br />And all my friends that have read it say it is awesome
B007FIY3VW|4.0|I have only used it once on my Kindle and I could takes notes and save them easily.  Best .99 I have spent lately
B007UXT6T6|4.0|definitely worth the watch. Writing reviews is annoying. Please stop making me do this. Writing reviews is annoying. Please stop making me do this.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|I thought it would be a great and funny movie but it was just WAY too inappropriate and I didn't like the characters. It does show the life some people live as they just argue with each other. This movie did the same things over and over again like fighting and hatred.
B006S53QCK|3.0|This one kinda' lays there and smells a little bit lame and I think the story line, what there is of it is small and weak. Oh well, you can't win them all.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I admire his strength and attitude under such trying times. He is a true hero and I wish him all the best for rest of his life. This is the kind of story you can read over and over again. Thank You Marcus for sharing your story with us.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I actually love this app! It's great and amazing I can't think of any other game that's better great job imangi studios but only one dislike when I try to turn to get the coins sometimes it won't let me but other then that it's great I wish I could put four in a half stars but I think it's great maybe it's just my device I don't know I'll take a look at it but I suggest you get it if you liked the first temple run you'll love this one it has great new upgrades LOVE IT you should really get it I give it four in a half stars
B009NY43NY|4.0|I've read many of the reviews for this book which were surprisingly negative.  However I could not leave this series unfinished based on some reviews, so I read it.  It was better than I expected and really tied things up this nicely.
B000SZNET6|5.0|This has to be the best and most original of all the Die Hard movies. I can't imagine anyone disliking this movie. It's a classic and deserves 5 stars!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Can't wait for season four. Downton Abbey has become my favorite show on television by far. Thank you Amazon. Time to do Amazon Prime.
B000YIGNKE|3.0|This film is not terrible but if you have the option of watching the 1995 version, which is vastly superior, I would not waste time on this one. There are a couple places here where the camera shakes so much I had to look away. Why the filmmakers choose to depart from the novel and from historical accuracy in certain ways I shall never know: Captain Harville hands Wentworth's note to Ann (this would never happen as an unmarried man could not write to an unmarried woman he was not engaged to); Ann runs all over Bath (most unladylike behavior); Ann runs out of the concert and after Captain Wentworth; the setting of many exchanges was changed but for no apparent reason. The actor who plays Mr. Elliot is forced and Ann's reactions whenever Captain Wentworth's name is brought up would lead anyone to see that she is pining for him--ridiculous as she would want to hide this. Also, the chemistry that exists in the 1995 version between Ann and Wentworth is lacking here. The last 10 minutes are cringe-worthy and eye-roll inducing: It takes them forever to kiss, Ann's mouth seems full of saliva, then the camera twirls around and around. Oh, brother. One good part of the film: the actors who plays Wentworth and the Crofts (though I still prefer the ones from the 1995 version)--they just needed a different script, director and co-stars.
B001GJ3BPU|1.0|My son is really into the superhero movies and with caution he has been able to watch most of them. However he was quick to point out how many people died or got killed in the movie. It was way to violent so we stopped watching it early on. I had seen the movie years ago and couldn't remember it being that violent, so this one Marvel movie we will pass on.
B0011MZOEI|5.0|This movie is so great and very interesting. The cast is great and the plot is worth while to see. It is great that it's current with how much we use technology these days. It's a must see movie!
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|paul rudd is always good !<br /> this show is better than the first one they were in together playing married couple in Knocked Up.....
0525478817|5.0|Such a well written story.  I fell in love with the characters and was so sad when the story came to an end.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Puzzle addicts will delight in the twists in this game. Rate it 5 stars even if a little short in gameplay. Enjoy a challenge? This is it! Have fun!
B000I9W0I8|5.0|I love this movie and every time I watch it, It still feels suspenseful. It never gets boring and I love this action even though I don't watch action movies very much.
B004IPPINW|3.0|Read it because I heard a review questioning how a movie is going to be made  and now I know why. A good read.
B00452VF4O|3.0|It was good.<br />It is very annoying that I have to have a minimum number of words for this review!
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This has to be one of the most powerful, beautiful and soul stirring books I've ever read, and one that I've always read when I need guidance - and I've always got it.  Life is simple, and this story reminds one to stop complicating and to let oneself evolve.<br /><br />Gratitude and blessings to the Paulo Coelho for writing this book, my life is certainly more enriched every time O read it.
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|this app is awesome there is so many people i know that has it i cant belive its that popular
B0040X46TE|5.0|If you have ever been to Hawaii or are thinking of going, this will help you remember or put you in the mood for a wonderful trip.  The first few times I heard it, I stopped whatever I was doing to just listen.  It's a beautiful and memorable experience to listen to IZ.
B001UGB1X8|3.0|Pretty good movie. It will keep you entertained. Nothing to write home about. Definitely one of the best free movies though.
0553384775|4.0|\\"The Wolf of Wall Street\\" is Jordan Belfort's memoir and confession, which represents a stage in his life where there was no limit to his social and business audacity as the charismatic boss of investment firm Stratton Oakmont.

B0076HNCTQ|5.0|My traveling schedule back during the early 90s was pretty crazy, so I didn't have much time to watch TV (No, kids.  We didn't have Amazon Prime back then).  So, even as a huge Lynch fan, I missed out on this series during it's original broadcast.  Granted, there are some pretty quirky, well written shows on cable networks now, but back when Seinfeld, Fresh Prince and 90210 ruled prime time-it's pretty amazing this show got the viewership it did. (Although, to be fair, Northern Exposure was another notable network exception).  Lynch's \\"Blue Velvet\\" is one of my all time favorites, and \\"Twin Peaks\\" unfolds almost like a serial version of that film.  Kyle McLaughlin even once suggested that part of his take on Agent Cooper was to present him as a \\"grown up\\" Jeffery Beaumont.<br /><br />Although the show occasionally ventures into stock Prime Time Soap Opera territory, it's overall bizarre tone always keeps me engaged.  I hear the second season goes completely off the rails...can't wait to watch it next!
B0058YPL66|5.0|i had the series thru netflix and i had to have it  i feel in love with the series Now my wife and I can watch it whenever we like. Its a great buy.
B00BP3DPJY|4.0|This album is fantastic. Its one of my favorite albums and I've only had it a short time. Definitely recommend.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I already had the free version of this app so I was excited to see it as the faotd. I love this app to help settle down and get my kids ready for bed.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|It was a good book, you never learn what happens.  Has can a mother have so little faith in her child.
0470913029|5.0|People do not appreciate how many carbs they consume and what it does to them regarding weight gain.  This book explains how carbs affect you and gives you a diet to follow for the short and long term.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|I was interested in seeing the beginnings of Dr. Who (at least this version).  I love Billie Piper as well.  While farfetched, it is entertaining.
B002WJI66C|4.0|This is cute, My son is so excited when he got it, me personally i thought it was ok it wasn't too soft and it has like a long thingy on the back.. But overall as long as my son is happy i'm happy :)
B00C8985DU|5.0|I have the original on vinyl & CD's but, had to get this one for the collection. I really think it is still a bit pricey and recommend the regular version for the common fan but the sound is pretty good on this new edition + added tracks and a DVD as well. So if you want a a excellent \\"Live\\" album from \\"Wings\\", then this one is the one to get, of course this edition is, as I say expensive, but really a nice complete package with all the goodies. As I say, recommend it, the deluxe edition if you have the bread to spend on it, if not, the regular version is excellent as well.<br />Drop by my Website sometime @ \\"JudeMac Forever\\" & look around.
B00BWJ7LYG|2.0|I think the story of this movies is poor. May be that I was expecting too much from this after watching the earlier series.
B008602KQI|5.0|I loved this movie. J Lawrence did a spectacular job in this movie. Highly recommend for you to watch it
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|There are different views of this program that makes it interesting.  Wish that you had different sigs on some of the pieces.  Great pass time.  Love it!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Lots of twists and turns. You won't want to put this book down once you've started it! A great read.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|This is my 4 or 5th Plantronics headset and this is definitely the best one of them all.  Very easy to set up, great sound quality, and very comfortable and lightweight.  I highly recommend it.
B008Y6RYDS|1.0|This is quite possibly the most motivating anti-drug propaganda ever produced, what a stupid pointless lifestyle to live. Best part is the end when these 2 loser drug addicts get killed by a hillbilly!
B009NY43NY|3.0|Spoilers<br /><br />Not where I thought she'd go with the ending. I hate that Eric had so little a part in the end. Seems like she just ended up back where she started and it was just a lot of pain and suffering along the way. It's as if she wishes it had all never happened or she just wakes up and the whole series was a dream or something. The ending was not satisfying to me, just kind of forced and blah. Still love this author though.
B002OSXDAU|5.0|A classic!  This should be required reading for all students.  And it should be required reading for all government officials.
B007OWQCIG|5.0|Bought it as a gift for a friend because she couldn't find it anywhere else and probably should have bought one for myself as well!  Such a sweet, romantic, yet suspenseful story line.  Action and romance!  It just doesn't get any better than this!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Fairly good book. Didn't take  long to read. Looking forward to the next harlequin book I have waiting for  me  to read
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This is the sequel to &#34;Fall of Giants&#34; which covered WW I and the run up to it.  Winter of the World covers WW II and continues the stories of the lives of the main characters in the first book.  Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia, Wartime in the domestic US and major battles are coverd - an easy way to learn or recall history in the form of a novel.  Very readable
B003JTHWJQ|2.0|Richard Dawkins presents bad philosophy and logic in this book. It is quite easy to counter-argue his arguments, making them (to use his own words) spectacularly weak. But besides that, it is a really hateful book. It was hard to read through. He spends the majority of his time disliking religion, using hateful words to describe God and those who believe in religion. It thus makes him no better than those people he is criticizing. This is not an open minded book and Dawkins clearly demonstrates his inability to listen to opposing arguments. So if you're looking for a good argument for atheism, keep that in mind. Dawkins may be good in his field of biology, but is wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy out of his league when dealing with theology, religion, or the subject of God.
B0076I624W|5.0|I just had to have my own copy of this movie to watch over and over.  I just can't seem to get enough of this movie.
B008B3MZNI|5.0|I was waiting for this video longtime ago.at the end. It worth . I miss all those years when music was a pleasure. There are the classic line up and the repertory is fantastic. I recomend this blueray for lovers of the 70's and I recomend amazon for been very well at it's commitment. Thank you amazon.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Wife got me watching this series and then I could not stop !!!!......We are both addicted. It just seems now a days it's very seldom that you find any shows/series/movies that are produced with the quality of actors, story line, and detail/accuracy of the time period props/settings that you have in this outstanding series. We are both ANXIOUSLY awaiting the 4th season !!! WATCH THIS, YOU WILL LOVE IT TOO !!

1451695195|3.0|This book is ok but not as good as all the reviews lead me to believe.  My husband passed away in Oct. 2012 and this didn't do it for me.  Just didn't make sense to me or resonate....
B00C061I3K|5.0|This new album got to my house on the day it was released and before 5pm. Nothing is wrong with the product nor was there any problems with the delivery.
B000HD1AEA|5.0|Great CD that has complete concert from Mirrorball Tour. Had the DVD of concert, wanted the complete show in order, as original CD had the &#34;best of&#34; type of songs, leaving me wanting for the missing songs i love too.
0525423656|2.0|I really did enjoy Matched. Not amazed by it, but enjoyed the entire book. Crossed however totally drops the ball. Nothing really happens (at least as far as I read) and the voices of Cassia and Ky are SO similar it was distracting. I had to keep reminding myself which character's head I was supposed to be in. And there is so little description. I'm not one who likes gobs of description, but this was too sparse.
B004E2XAFW|5.0|WT deserves a bit more recognition in the US than they have garnered--most likely due to record labels not wanting to lose certain \\"investments\\" in already established goth rock bands or female fronted rock groups.  However, make no mistake, WT is without a doubt, so much better and more talented than those \\"investments\\".  You will not be disappointed with this album nor any of their other albums, except maybe their very first when they were into the death growling.<br /><br />The Unforgiving is definitely worth the money you'll spend.
B009ZQJVAK|4.0|Saw the play in New York in April, loved it and rented this for my husband.  He loved it too.  The play was a bit more exciting music and dancing wise, but this was close.

B00APUYWYA|1.0|I got about half way through.  STUPID movie.  The horrible acting doesn't even try to make up for the cliche script.  Are teenage/college kids really this dumb?  There must be a lacking for movies that appeal to non-Harry Potter and Vampire fans, if this is what becomes popular.  And guess what?  We did the cup game back in the 90's, so don't go thinking you're all clever discovering this new fad.
