B008J9EYFG|3.0|I love Beth Orton, yes, I love her music. I own her previous five albums, shoot I even bought Pass In Time the remix album, and enjoyed that. Six years without a new album by Beth Orton is a long time. Oh, I'm so sad to say I don't love Sugaring Season. Overall it is a good album; there are moments of brilliance, Magpie, Dawn Chorus, Candles, and Poison Tree. There are two tracks that sound like fingers on a chalkboard to me, Something More Beautiful and See Through Blue. The remaining four tracks are good.<br /><br />The four tracks I loved are more like classic Beth Orton, her beautiful mid range voice with just the right amount of music. By the time the album gets to See Through Blue, Orton is channeling Edith Piaf and happy go lucky turn of the century music. Something More Beautiful has two crescendos of orchestral music that has an irritating dissonance with her voice. It should sound like passion rising, instead it is painful.<br /><br />The recording is nice, clear with excellent range. Unfortunately some of the songs just added too much orchestra or needless instruments. I love Beth Orton's voice and I think she sounds best with an acoustic guitar or piano. All the other production is just extra fill that I don't think she needs. The album does close with a beautiful sparse song, Mystery.<br /><br />Four brilliant tracks, four good ones, and two stinkers make for a mediocre album, even if I love Beth Orton. Six years to wait for this was too long.

B007STBUIW|5.0|I don't think I need to justify how great or important this film is, so I am just going to note some interesting and pleasant details on the bluray release. This bluray release is amazing and a must own for bluray collectors. The frame-by-frame restoration they went through took a ton of work and really made the film look new again. You can see the details on how they did this in the special features. The special features also include a 2-hour long documentary about how they made the film and although this is in SD it looks fine and was very interesting. I was extremely pleased when I realized that in the digital copy you get the SD and HD versions and extras that include the documentary! They really served customers right in getting a decent digital package unlike the featureless SD disappointments that usually come with bluray purchases. The ET bluray I just purchased is also giving me the same type of digital downloads as Jaws so I have to say I am very happy and hope other studios follow Universal's lead on this.

B005CWRB44|5.0|I own several LED lights made by Fenix, they are all great. I had purchased the Fenix compact 140 Lumen LED mini pocket/keychain light. It uses a CR123-A battery which will power this little light at an incredible brightness that you will not believe your eyes when you see it. It uses a twist on and off and to control the brightness level. It starts off on Med. which is more then most people will have a need for, the second is low and third is high. It's so small and compact that once you switch it on, it's hard to imagine all the light emitting from such a tiny little thing. It's perfect for anyone.

B007THA4FI|4.0|The things these English parents did do their children without even thinking about them finally caused the downfall of careers, and worse, a death of a young teen who was on the brink of being saved by the one person who cared about her and died an untimely death.  I think Rowling harbors a great deal of anger in her soul towards adults who are unkind, uncaring, and unfeeling towards their children.  This was evident in the Harry Potter series, but the young had recourse to magic.  In this book, the young have no recourse other than revenge by anonymous internet sabotage of the adults who have been monstrous or just plain stupid in their dealings with children and teens.  Personally, as I grew up, adults around me were so engrossed and occupied with their own problems, hang-ups and leftover hurts from their own childhoods, they were not able to see their own children objectively

0812992784|4.0|After I got maybe half-way through Joseph Anton, I picked up a few of Rushdie's novels at the library.  When I was checking them out, my husband said, \\"I had no idea he wrote more than that one book....what was it called?\\"  And, in many ways, that's what the book is about: how Salman Rushdie the writer becomes the Rushdie of the Satanic Verses and, worse still, a Joseph Anton who does not really exist.  Because of the fatwa, Salman Rushdie had to give up his freedom, his name, his home, and even for a time his ability to write.  And the insanity of it all; the fear for your life, the profound disorientation, the press of events; the being history in the making without wanting to--all that is vividly portrayed in these pages.<br /><br />And there is more.  There is the way the British government behaved towards this threatened writer.  Put simply, the British government did not feel Salman deserved to be protected; saw him more as a nuisance than anything else.  And this, despite the fact, that in the wake of the Satanic Verses, there were calls to ban (among other things) \\"The Life of Brian\\" as well.  You would think that the idea of banning a film that calls on people to see the funny side of life would bring folks to their senses; would make them see how insane the whole thing was.  It didn't.  And the \\"debate\\" over what is (and is not) permissible rages hotter than ever, with ever more people in hiding or dead because they shot the wrong film, drew the wrong picture, wrote and published the wrong book, or were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.  All this, is made very clear in Joseph Anton--as is the personal price that must be paid by a writer who writes \\"the wrong book\\".<br /><br />But there is another book inside this one.  The personal book.  It is a book, not just about Salman Rushdie the historical figure, but Salman Rushdie the man.  The terrible husband, the far better father, the scared man, the son, the writer.  Inside these pages there is the son of the a-religious father fascinated by the history of Islam; the scared man who would proclaim himself a Muslim in the hopes of lifting the fatwa; the husband who cheated on his wives; the man who tried really hard to be a father in impossible circumstances.  That too comes through loud and clear in these pages and the two stories: the story of the political and the story of the human interweave almost seamlessly and frankly until I sat down to write this review I did not realize how many stories were in this one book.<br /><br />And there is more still.  For this, after all, is the story of a writer and a writer must first of all be a reader.  So this is also a book about the authors who inspired Rushdie himself: Saul Bellow, Joseph Heller, Susan Sontag, and many, many more.  (Those of you who are familiar with Norman Mailer and Saul Bellow might recognize a few of the literary devices employed in this book.)<br /><br />And finally, tying it all together is the humor: the policeman who is guarding Rushdie but can't protect his car from a petty thief (he leaves it unlocked), his failed attempt to hide beneath a wig, Mike Wallace's question about his sex life on 60 Minutes and so much more.  It's the humor that ties all the stories into one and makes the book seem human and eminently readable.<br /><br />It may not be Rushdie's best book but it is, perhaps, his most important one.  I recommend it.son of the a-religious father fascinated by the history of Islam; the scared man who would proclaim himself a Muslim in the hopes of lifting the fatwa; the husband who cheated on his wives; the man who tried really hard to be a father in impossible circumstances.

Gibson directs this beautiful piece in which he stars as Scottish hero William Wallace - a man who's quest for revenge turns into a fight for freedom from tyrannical British rule.

B007MDB6L0|5.0|About halfway through this movie I looked over my 8 year old daughter, and almost 12 year old son, to my husband and said, \\"I can't believe I'm getting goosebumps from a Tinker Bell movie.\\"<br /><br />Yes. Goosebumps.<br /><br />My daughter and I have watched all the Tinker Bell movies in the franchise, and have even watched the specials on the Disney channel. I have to say that we've loved all the movies, but I think Secret of the Wings is now my favorite.<br /><br />I won't bore you with the synopsis, as you can read it above, but I will tell you about what we liked,<br /><br />-New characters!! Not only do we get to see all the favorites, we get lots of brand new characters as well, including Periwinkle (of course), Dewey (the Keeper), Lord Milori (voiced by Timothy Dalton! Yes!), and a host of new friends from the Winter Woods.<br /><br />-No bad guys. I realized when I was watching this that there are no bad guys in a Tinker Bell movie! There are bad things that happen (and an occasional stray cat), but there is really no one bad guy. I love that! I love that it teaches my daughter that bad things can happen but if you work together, and think outside the box (like Tink), you can solve almost any problem.<br /><br />-Personal sacrifice. As one of the other reviewers here remarked, there is a moment of personal sacrifice made by Tinker Bell that truly makes the film. It shows that while her main focus is getting to know Periwinkle, she cares more about all of the fairies, and the great pixie dust tree, than her own wishes.<br /><br />-Great music. I'm still singing...\\"and the great divide...doesn't seem so wide...\\" although I do miss the Celtic music from the previous movies.<br /><br />-The story! How can I put this last? The story is FANTASTIC. Simple enough that children can understand it, and complex enough that adults will enjoy it (note: my husband and I were going \\"Ooooh - I know what's gonna happen\\" as there is quite a bit of foreshadowing, but it didn't ruin the movie at all!\\"<br /><br />All in all, the entire family has marked this as one of the best Tinker Bell movies yet! Even the animation is getting better (the bobcat looks so real!).<br /><br />Thanks, Disney, for making an amazing franchise - so...when's the next movie?!ruin the movie at all!\\"<br /><br />All in all, the entire family has marked this as one of the best Tinker Bell movies yet!

B00932HEX2|5.0|This is a solid serial drama. If you liked the idea of 24 but found the whole execution too implausible to enjoy, Homeland might be what you're looking for. The acting, writing and plot line are way better than 24. Plus, Claire Danes is in it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is awesome and addicting dont buy it unless you have the time to spare! highly recomended :) and have fun
B003O86FMW|4.0|OK, as with most things the sequel is never quite as good as the original Hunger Games book but still did enough to keep me going through the book at a fast pace.  The plot was relatively slow to get going (but you just wanted to know what happened after Katniss won the original Hunger Games so you plow through it anyway) but there are definitely some interesting twists half way through when the Quarter Quell is introduced.  At first, I thought going back into the arena would be relatively boring but the author paid less attention to games itself and more on the personalities inside.  And for good reason because they are all playing a particular role in a much greater plot which all becomes clear in the third book - Mockingay.  Overall, I thought the book was a good read, kept me interested (which is difficult when reading!) and is an absolute pre-req for reading the final book in this trilogy.
B0031RAOVY|1.0|The packaging of this DVD is very misleading. Nowhere did it even allude to the fact that this movie is about death and grief. My seven-year-old sobbed and sobbed for about the last 40 minutes of the movie. After his beloved owner dies (Richard Gere), the dog Hachi is grief-stricken and for the rest of his life waits at the train station for the master who will never return. It was heartbreaking. I have no interest in watching this movie again and regret that I bought it and showed it to my daughter.  I'm surprised it was rated G.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is really fun there are spiders and best of all creepers it is great but not as good as the Pc version
B008Y1YK9Y|3.0|Let's be honest, the first Men in Black was FANTASTIC! It was something new, unique, funny, and had some action. Positive reviews and a strong box office later, it was pretty obvious it would get a sequal. Unfortunately, everything that I loved about the first Men in Black was pretty much ruined in the second.<br /><br />Moving on, 10 or so years later we get, surprisingly, a third entry in the series. As long as this one was better than the second, I would be fine. And fortunately, this was a BIG improvement!<br /><br />So, MIB3 starts off with a MIB \\"alien prison\\" on the moon, and one of the prisoners, a crime lord named Borris the animal, escapes seeking revenge against agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) who is the man that took Borris down. Meanwhile, Agent J (Will Smith) and K are dealing with normal \\"MIB\\" matters on earth, however, Borris breaks into another facility, and uses a special \\"time travel\\" device and goes back in time to 1969 and kills the young agent K (Josh Brolin). This erases our modern agent K from existance, and the world has completely changed. An alien invasion is now spreading across earth, and the world is pretty much facing an apocalypse. Agent J, however, is the only person who seems to remember the existance of old \\"Tommy Lee\\" agent K. So, Agent J then gets a hold of the \\"time travel\\" device and goes bak to 1969 as well, to stop Borris the animal from killing the young K (if anyone thinks that was confusing, don't worry, you should follow it pretty well while watching the movie, just don't think about it too hard.)<br /><br />The POSITIVES:<br />-None of the scripts in these movies have been that spectacular, and this one is pretty much on par with the first two.<br /><br />-The special effects and action never dissapoint! This one easily has the best action of the trilogy (and a VERY entertaining climax!).<br /><br />-The sets and costumes are fantastic. The most interesting parts (for me) was the middle, where a large part of the film takes place in 1969, and the setup in this time period is really entertaining to watch.<br /><br />-The acting is great, each player does their part well, especially our three leading men.<br /><br />-Alot of people have complained about the ending plot twist, saying it is \\"illogical\\" or \\"unnecessary\\", but come on, it's MIB we are talking about here. It was still emotional, and well done. And you shouldn't bother scratching your head over this, considering how confusing the time travel aspect of the the plot is.<br /><br />-A specific actor, to note, is Josh Brolin as Young agent K. He gives an AMAZING performance as K, and gives an oscar worthy impersination of a young Tommy Lee.<br /><br />The NEGATIVES:<br />-When it comes to the time travel element, there are too many things that you are forced to question, and really should have been explained better. Specifically, after old agent K is wiped from existance, they never really tell you WHY agent J remembers agent K's existance while everyone else does not. They do briefly explain how, but they don't give you a full explanation, and it would have been nice if they took an extra 5 minutes to help explain this stuff to the audience. Another thing to add: If old K is wiped from existance, then how is agent J even an agent at all? In the original MIB, old K personally recruits J. There is a scene at the end of the movie where you might get an idea at how J still ends up becoming an agent, but it still isn't quite enough. Point is, the movie needed an extra 5 minutes of dialogue to help explain the time travel element, so you aren't left scratching your head.<br /><br />-The comedy. Specifically, the first 20 minutes of the movie. There are too many skits that just don't work. Quite frankly, there are 1 or 2 scenes where I was questioning walking out of the theater or not. Sure, the scenes with Will Smith and Tommy Lee are great (they continue to work great together) but it's nothing we havn't seen before. After the first 20 minutes or so, the humor started to get funny, and although there are still a few later parts that fall flat, they don't last long and the movie moves on pretty quickly.<br /><br />-The music isn't very good at all. The majority of the film was OK, but the theme at the beginning was TERRIBLE! What was even more dissapointing was the fact that I LOVED the music in the trailers, but I was NOT pleasently surprised when I found out none of the trailer music is actually used in the movie. And I was shocked when I found out Danny Elfman did the music. I love most of his work, but he seriously droped the ball with this movie.<br /><br />-Agent J. If there is one good thing to say about MIB2, it's agent J's character. Sure, he was still that same kid, BUT, he had definately matured greatly. In MIB3, however, Will Smith is still trying to be that same goofy kid from the first movie. In this he is over 40, so it just doesn't work. Don't get me wrong, I didn't want him to be a mature strict K, but I just wanted to see his character developed more. However, we do get a great emotinal scene with J in the end, which worked really well for the character, so that was cool. And im NOT saying anything bad about Will Smith (who gives a great performance as always) I just didn't like how he was written in the first two thirds of the film.<br /><br />Overall, MIB3 is a fun ride. Sure, it's not NEARLY as good as the original MIB (which was an instant classic), BUT, this is a GREAT improvement over MIB2, and overall, is still a good movie. If you liked the original MIB, you should have fun with this, just don't expect TOO much from it. But, if you didn't like the first MIB, you MIGHT have fun with this one, but I highly doubt this will when you over. Overall, a good, fun movie.
B0098VYCCE|1.0|I desperately need to understand how this girl has a career as an actress. Seriously, will someone tell me? Surely she hasn't banged EVERY director she's worked with. Her excruciatingly dull performance not withstanding, the rest of the movie is kind of entertaining.The script is weak, but Charlize Theron is perfection as the queen. And the special effects are beautiful, but it's not enough to carry the film. Casting agents: There are a ton of talented young actresses out here. Try harder next time.

0312945973|3.0|The protagonist/narrator, Taita, is an artist, architect, inventor, military strategist, surgeon, singer, and more. His mistress, the Lady Lostris, is the most beautiful woman in Egypt, brilliant and beloved by the people.  Her lover, Tanus, is the greatest soldier and leader. He is so honorable and noble and he would die rather than betray a promise. Lord Intef, the antagonist and Grand Vizier, is totally evil. There is not a compassionate or unselfish bone in his body. They are all too too much, so they seem like caricatures rather than characters at times.<br /><br />Lostris does come off as a whiny Valley Girl in her younger years. And Tanus occasionally behaves like a thick-headed jock. Taita has no sex organs. So, they do have faults. But, a very good book would be a great book were the important characters more subtly drawn. Strangely, a lesser character, Pharaoh, is the most \\"real\\" character in his complexity.  But then, his \\"son\\" is so perfect as to look and behave \\"like a god\\".<br /><br />The story is engaging and the combat is especially gripping. Taita's trials and tribulations draw the reader in to care deeply about him. The love story of Lostris and Tanus can pull tears out of hard-bitten men. It is well worth reading.<br /><br />Final caveat: Don't expect to learn much accurate history about ancient Egypt. It really is fiction.<br />[[ASIN:B007TAF1JY MONSTERS OF THE MIDWAY: 1969 - Sex, Drugs, Rock 'n Roll, and Football]]

B009GEN0JO|4.0|I was studying the history of Bond movies and decided to purchase and watch this movie online at Amazon.com. This is a remake of Thunderball years later, both staring the same actor, Sean Connery. Since Thunderball was an official EON release, and after a legal battle Never Say Never Again was released later independently, Never Say Never Again is sometimes counted as an \\"UNofficial\\" Bond movie. You can read a lot about this conflict on the Internet, but in my opinion even though this movie was made 12 years after his last Bond movie, Connery is a little older, wiser, and mature as an actor, and does a fine job. Though the underlying plot of both Thunderball and Never Say Never Again are essentially identical (bad guy steals two nukes... Bond has to find them) and even though there are underwater fights and stuff, both movies have their good and bad points. I enjoyed this one and it kept me entertained. Search Google for \\"Thunderball vs Never Say Never Again\\" and you'll find great comparative reviews.

B000SEGCRS|5.0|I am very new to digital photography. I recently purchased another book besides this one to really get the basics down. I would describe this book as more of an immediate to professional level book. The book talks about basic concepts in passing and doesn't really take any time to discuss what aperture, white balance, ISO, or any other basic concept is. The writer describes himself as telling you the same things as if you were his shooting buddy. That said, there are a few times in the book where things are \\"just do it\\" but he does offer some explanation.<br /><br />One other things I really love about this book is that if you are like me and are on a budget when it comes to cameras and equipment, he does a very good job talking and denoting items based on either having a budget, being able to afford more than your budget, or simply not having a budget at all. He offers a lot of descriptions and suggestions for where to purchase items, what to look for when purchasing items, and other good information for each kind of person.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this book for anyone who understands that basics but wants something a little more. This book is one of those books that I would carry with me and reference in whenever I need it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I don't know why people are making this a popular book. It is just pornography with no romance and is disgusting.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Have used the battery HD app since it first came out.  It has been a great help to me in keeping an eye on the status of the battery in my Kindle Fire!  This app is a &quot;Must-Have&quot; for the Kindle and I have come to depend on it when I use me Fire.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love it!!!!!!  Yes it is a time waster but its  great entertainment you just keep wanting to get prizes and coins.
1451627297|5.0|I've been a huge King fan for a very long time and always preferred his older-style to some of his new works, but this book definitely changed that. The story sucks you in within a few pages and you start reading faster and faster to see what happens, its so engrossing. I really liked Under the Dome, but I LOVED this one, definitely Top 5 King.
034580404X|1.0|This poorly written sexed out book is fifty shades of \\"BS\\". It has many misspelled words, is very unorganized and is the worst book I have ever read. The plot is weak and overall it is very boring. I purchased the trilogy because of the \\"hype\\" in the media. After reading half of book one, I realized I wasted my money and time. Reluctantly, I read book two and half of book three hoping I would be able to enjoy the trilogy. I read every night when I go to bed and I found myself regretting to read. Finally, I allowed a co-worker to tell me how the book ends so I wouldn't waste any more time. When I heard the ending I was thrilled I didn't finish it! SAVE YOUR MONEY AND TIME.
B0058YPGL6|5.0|At first I was very skeptical about watching this show since it was MTV. My favorite show of all shows is Skins UK, and when MTV redid the series I was pretty pissed and decided MTV should just stick to reality shows, it's the only thing they're good for. But if you're on tumblr, then that's pretty much all I have to say. This show is easily one of my top 5. And while at some parts it's cheesy, it's endearing. And the second season is way better. I can't wait to see what season 3 will be like!
B0038BBA4I|5.0|Great Album and SUPER EASY to buy and download at a much lower cost than expected.  I bought this for my 17 year old son and decided to check it out myself.  I am an Avett Bro's fan and my son suggested that I might like Mumford as well and he was correct.  Looking forward to hearing more from these guys!

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Excellent book. Easy purchase with Kindle app on my phone. Good read, definitely a page turner that I couldn't put down.
1908117230|4.0|Pierre Herme is considered the God-father of Macarons. In this book he focuses on the method he uses in his shops, which is based on Italian Meringue (Italian Method). It involves whipping your egg whites, then cooking them by slowly boring hot sugar syrup into them. Like another reviewer said, it doesn't talk about swiss or french method, which would have been nice, but if you think about it, Herme is offering his style, and not selling this book as a Macaron encyclopedia, so I am ok with him leaving those out. This book gives you lots of flavor and assembly ideas, but can get kinda involved in some of them. I actually prefer the French method myself, its faster, and has a different texture then the Italian. I am glad to have this apart of my collection, and is a must have for any Macaron fanatic!
B0085Z3B2Q|2.0|I was very disappointed. Of course, being a PG movie implies that it is for kids, but usually they attempt universal appeal. Bottom line, it wasn't funny and the story was very dry. The animation was beautiful and the voice acting was pretty good, but nothing else materialized that was of any value. The first half hour is promising and foretells an intriguing story, but nothing really happens. The humor was obviously meant for five year-olds, as it was 90% slap-stick \\"guy runs into pole/gets hit with a fish.\\" I went into the movie knowing that it would be preachy, but this was overkill. This movie just was not good. A child may enjoy it, seeing as story isn't one of their focal points, but I can't foresee this as a movie any adult would watch a second time. It wasn't an awful movie as the film itself is absolutely breath-taking, but the story is a huge let down. The three bonus mini-movies were all under five-minutes, which isn't really an issue. They focus more on the animals which is the film's best part, but they weren't funny either. It just seems like a missed opportunity. Everything looks so great and the characters are pretty interesting, but the story is too minimal and too boring.

B009B50QOU|5.0|I didn't know what to expect for this album, but when it came out and I heard the songs, I had to buy it.  I like almost all the songs.  No liking 2 songs was no reason to deduct a star because the rest of the album is so good.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Whats there to say? Great app, easy to use, and improved my battery life by a lot...i lost my kindle for 2 weeks, when i found it, it was still running on standby  mode.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Even though it does leave you on a cliff-hanger at the end, it is a book everyone should read!!!!! This book keeps you guessing and is filled with very humorous and suspenceful moments!!!!!!! Read it!!!! :):):):):):)
B0072OFM28|5.0|Just as great as the first one. Looking forward to the last. Miss Andy, but Liam is a great actor.
034580404X|5.0|The Trilogy was great. 50shades of Grey-very Best of the trilogy,Darker-Good,Freed-Better.  I have started rereading them.(6stars).<br />I was very dissappointed when I had finished. The stories made you feel like you were there. They seemed  so real. Can't wait for the movie or a sequel. E.l.James did a great job.<br />I received my books in a timely manner and jump right into them.
B009KHBDUU|1.0|We didn't have very high expectations when renting this movie, but did think that it might be kind of campy and fun, given the cast. We were wrong.  The cast is totally wasted here and they all appear to be sleep-walking through their roles.  The only one who looks like he's having any fun is Alice Cooper, but he's not on screen for long enough to make any difference.  If you must see this, wait until it comes on regular cable for free and even if they do the usual editing for length and content, you won't be missing much.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|i am now on book three and can't put it down...it has been many a year since i have been so excited about a series of books...don't think twice...buy it and enjoy!!!
0385536828|5.0|Does intelligence drive imagination or is it the reverse?  To me, Sweet Tooth is the culmination of Ian McEwan's work.  In it he incorporates themes he's explored before to heightened degrees.  His integration of the destructive effect of obsessive love fueled by world events is combined with an unparalleled literary expertise.  As in Atonement, calamitous events are set in motion by the slightest gesture which in is misinterpreted by another.  Jealousy, revenge, deception -- all are taken to cleanly original places.  On a personal level, it was fascinating to read this book shortly after finishing Joseph Anton, Salman Rushdie's memoir which also makes considerable use of the London literary scene, and, despite a 20-year gap, several players appear in pages of both.  The Man-Booker award, which McEwan has won and been nominated for multiple times,  is brought in almost a a character, and I suspect that there are many inside jokes here that I am missing.  But that did not take anything from my enjoyment of this  novel that educates as well as entertains.  The late 70's was a dark time for Britain, a fact nostalgia can overlook.  There is so much meat on the bones of this book, I am afraid to overpraise its quality.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|fabulous fascinating book...well worth the money! i was amazed at all the information and facts...so much is happening behind the scenes and out of the public eye!
0307592731|5.0|Perhaps I'm secretly a bit of a voyeur because I must confess to loving the glimpse into somebody else's life that memoirs provide.  And this peek into Cheryl Strayed's life during a time of personal crisis is indeed fascinating.<br /><br />After losing her mother at a young age, destroying her marriage with impulsive decisions, and failing to complete college even though she was within a stone's throw of the graduation cap and gown, Strayed brashly decided to hike the Pacific Crest Trail solo.  As some of you may already know, the Pacific Crest Trail, or PCT for short, is no leisurely day hike; it extends along the highest portions of the Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges from Mexico to Canada for 2,663 miles and reaches elevations of 13,153 feet.  This makes the PCT a treacherous and challenging journey for the most-experienced and best-prepared of hikers.  And Strayed was neither of those.<br /><br />Indeed, Strayed's candid account will likely leave you feeling worried and frustrated as she encounters wild animals, inadequate water supplies, freezing temperatures, and men sometimes more threatening than the bears.  But what she lacks in planning, she makes up for with persistence.  By the end of the book, I predict you will be impressed by her progress and cheering for her success.<br /><br />You might find it coincidental that a woman with the last name of Strayed wrote a book with the subtitle From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail.  However, her name was not Strayed when she started the hike; to find out how she got this last name, you'll have to read the book.<br /><br />If you are familiar with the West, you will enjoy reading about the recognizable landmarks she describes including the Mojave Desert and Mount Shasta in California, Crater Lake and Mount Hood in Oregon, and the Columbia Gorge that marks the Oregon-Washington border.<br /><br />Ultimately, it is Strayed's emotional journey (even more so than her physical travels) that will resonate with you in the end.nate with you in the end.
B008RV5K5E|2.0|When they said it was an \\"all new original movie\\" I didn't expect to get some old rehash of Frank Miller's original work.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This has hit the top of my list as the best book I've read this year! I'm not a fan of Sci-fi or Fantasy stories. I usually go for mystery and crime. Mr. Howey has created a world that drew me in. This is so much more than a fantasy or Sci- fi. I found myself talking out loud more than once while reading this story. My emotions became entwined with the Characters. This is a sweeping saga of love, war, pain, failure, joy,deceit and sorrow and what people are  willing to go through to find out if there is more to life than what is in front of them. This is an instant Classic. I only have one problem...I am not a patient person, Mr. Howey, when will there be more!
B00932A2MC|3.0|This was a fun movie.  Not super intelligent but very entertaining. Popcorn,  twizzlers and nothing to do this is your ticket.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I chose to read this book after reading 50 Shades of Grey and I think I like this story line better. I can't wait for the next book to come out that is in Travis's point of view. This book kept me completely interested and I finished it in just a few days, unable to put it down. I was struggling to find something after 50 Shades of Grey that could keep my interest and this book did just that. I have since downloaded Jaime McGuire's other books and can't wait to start them!
0525953728|5.0|This book was hard to put down. Not only is the content itself gripping, but the way the author tells it keeps the pace quick and suspenseful. His dry wit doesn't hurt either. The story surprised me--I was afraid it would be too graphic but it wasn't. This is not a blood and gore book, despite its main topic of killing UBL.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I think having the pieces scrollable on the side is fantastic. I paid to get rid of the ads - thanks for offering that. I wish there was a scrollbar for the pieces. its very hard to get them to scroll sometimes
B008QE9VJI|3.0|I went in to watching this movie with low expectations. I remember watching several of the original episodes on TV and knew it was not going to be like that. As a standalone movie it was OK and better than I thought it would be. The best part of the entire show was watching the red `Cuda' drive around.

B005LAJ1H2|5.0|It was a \\"must see\\" after seeing the first season!  I must admit that it would be for mature audiences only, as there are many instances that would be considered X-Rated.  It is a well written thriller that kept us on the edge of our seats.  Steve Buscemi is great in the roll of \\"Nuckie\\"' and I can't wait to see the next season!
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Love this game. The various degrees of difficulty makes it fun to play. Wish there was a way to clear previous scores in order to restart.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Loved the way the author ultimately brought all of the characters together.  I will now read the first book of the trilogy.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Gillian is a great author.  I started out reading \\"Gone Girl\\" and then ordered her two previous books.  Her characters are flawed but you can't help but feel for them.  Dark and dysfunctional but I enjoyed it.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I first watched this movie on the flight home after spending 2 months working all over India. It made me want to get off the plane and go back immediately! Top class acting and a very accurate portrail of life in India! So good I bought it off Amazon and watched it again!
0984183523|5.0|Hi,<br />I believe that the Case Interview Secrets is a good starting point for preparing for Case Interviews. It gives a good overview of what really matters and why it matters.<br />Don't expect that the book can replace practising! However, the major frameworks presented here will be applicable to most cases.<br />It's definitely good value for money and with following the guidelines in the book and a lot of practise, you should be ready to go!
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|The combination of the substantial firepower of the super people coupled with the anti-procrastination of the strategic domination equaled an unsurpassed annihilation of the evil doers.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|My son recommended this book to me, knowing that I would draw inspiration from it just as he had when he read it.  What I got from this book is that one must discover one's purpose in life and act upon it.  Also, that when obstacles and events seem to be working in opposition to one's dreams, one should never give up; instead those obstacles and events may be playing a part in helping to achieve one's purpose. This is a book to read over and over again.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I loved this book!  It was gripping, hard to put down and well written. It brings the entire event to life through one of the  men who lived it! It has given me an entirely new appreciation for the men and women who serve our country. I would like to thank the author for writing this book to set the record straight.
B0091REZMW|4.0|its a good way to waste time. fun. if you like these types of games then give it a try.

B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Having read alot of positive and negative reviews I decided to get this movie on bluray today and make a decision for myself.  I have to say from the time the movie started till the very end, I never found a dull moment to be honest!  I think alot of people were expecting this film to be similar to Aliens, with tons of aliens raging about killing people.  I really didn't want to see another similar flick like that, instead I very much appreciated this one, it was rather refreshing to say the least! I know not everyone agrees but it all boils down to our expectations of a film and how we perceive it!<br /><br />As far as the special edition 2D bluray is concerned, I did have a problem with mines when it started to break up in blocks around 1 hour 28 minutes into the movie. Then the problem got worse and the picture became all fuzzy and froze. I couldn't operate the remote or power it off, so I had to unplug the player from the outlet, power it back on and eject the disc.  I have read on avsforum.com that certain batches of this bluray dvd have the same problem.  I decided to load the regular dvd and continued watching from that point onwards with no issues at all.<br /><br />I must say despite the problem I encountered with my bluray disc, I will still rate the picture quality as 10/10, and the sound is fantastic as well...10/10. I never had to adjust my volume control like I have had to on some other movies when it came to the dialogue and action.<br /><br />Here's an update for October 14 @ 3:30 P.M.<br /><br />Ok! There is a solution I've found for those defective discs! Ofcourse you have all read my dilemma with the bluray disc but here is what I did and it worked flawlessly.<br /><br />Go to the player's own menu. Go: Setup > BD / DVD Viewing Settings > BD Internet Connection > Do Not Allow or Disable.<br /><br />You will need to turn it back on after you're through watching the film for your other applications if need be. Hope this helps all of you. Keep me posted, thanks!ted, thanks!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I absolutely loved everything about this game!!! One if the best hidden object games yet!!! Cant wait for the Enigmatis 2!!!! Great job developers!!!
B0072OFOM6|5.0|One Of the best shows out there! It has everything a guy would like in a show! Beautiful women! Violence nudity language and a great story line! Get all three seasons! Before the next one comes out on Stars in February! Whoever didn't give the whole series 5 stars.... is a idoit!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I initially installed the weather channel app to my kindle fire and after a while got very dissatisfied with it.I looked to see what other apps where out there and found this one,  accuweather.wow what a pleasant surprise!  this weather app is great. no problems with it at all so far. updates automatically and is accurate. the updating thing is a big issue because the other app I used did not update even after turning the kindle off and back on!  I also like the appearance of the app,  it has little rain drops on the screen when its rainy out and other graphics like that.  I also like that the app is always active.on my notification tab so I can tap on that from wherever I'm at and find out the weather. accuweather rocks.  great app,  especially since it is free!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Really enjoyed this film.  I am not a comic book buff so I don't know the stories behind each of these characters. I was entertained by the film and felt it was not a waste of money.
030758836X|4.0|I liked how Gillian Flynn kept the two main characters seperate.  She wrote differently for each of them, yet consistently with each.<br /><br />I enjoyed the suspense of figuring out that she was not actually missing.  I also rooted for each character.<br /><br />A good read - but, as a fast reader, it went too fast!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Its a fun game that u ride thrum a laboratory or somewhere random on a jetpack! it truly is a jetpack joyride :)

B008D4AKYQ|5.0|Sgt. Peppers? Are You Experienced? The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway? English Electric!! I often hear people say that the music of today is not as interesting as the music of the 60s and 70s. Of course, I have never agreed with that entirely. I know that in order to have legends and landmarks in music you have to keep an open mind and ear. Most people only like what has already been declared legendary over time. My life is filled with the music of yesterday AND the music of today! In my opinion Big Big Train have created a modern masterpiece of music. And this is only PART ONE!
B007THA4FI|2.0|Vacancy was very slow moving.. hard to get into the characters.. too much time spent on characters ruminations and not enough substantial action
B009B2U73I|1.0|While the seductive artwork will be enticing enough for many to pick up the CD, the musical aspect is lacking.  It's not jazz.  It's not particularly interesting.  It seems this has been the course for a while now.  More emphasis on her body and less on her music.  This CD continues that course.  Artwork 5 Stars.  Music 1 Star.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I was hoping for a \\"clean\\" adult book with intrigue, challenge, and fun. What I found was a dirty soap opera. Unfortunately, this was one of those times when I couldn't even finish the book. I read somewhere that Rowling was willing to take criticism for this because she wanted to write something totally different from Harry Potter. Well, she did and she will. I will read another juvenile fiction that she writes, but if she does a sequel to this book (or even in a similar vein), I won't waste my money.
B0042816YK|1.0|I read the book and was surprised how much I liked it.  Very honest and amazingly wise.  Then I saw the movie.  What a mistake Gilbert made to agree to it!  It made her awakening experiences trivial, her honest emotions sentimental. I could hardly bear to watch it.  A terrible script and poor casting choices.  Don't see the movie.  Read the book.
B008C1O8CA|4.0|\\"Uno\\" by Greenday piqued my interest due to the \\"Oh Love\\" song.  I had heard the song from youtube and was curious to check out the cd. I understand that others may take the cd to have different meanings, but the theme of feeling adoration is my current interpretation of \\"Uno\\".  It is just that \\"Stay The Night\\", \\"Troublemaker\\", and \\"Oh Love\\" seem to embody the highs and lows of endearment. \\"Angel Blue\\", \\"Sweet 16\\" and \\"Rusty James\\" are also appealing tunes. \\"Uno\\" is a fitting choice for those who like at least five Greenday songs.
0143038419|5.0|I found this to be an honest very well-written story of a woman's search when her life was falling apart.  I particularly liked part two in India at the ashram which reminded me of long meditation retreats I have attended.  Do not see the film.  It is terrible and trivializes Gilbert's whole experience.
B008B0QH5S|4.0|\\"Elysium\\" by Pet Shop Boys streamline musical tunes that evoke a placid feeling.  I found out about this cd prior to its release because of  the \\"Invisible\\" and \\"Winner\\" songs.  \\"Winner\\" is currently my favorite song but these other songs also caught my attention: \\"Your Early Stuff\\", \\"A Face Like That\\"  \\"Memory Of The Future\\", and \\"Everything Means Something\\". \\"Elysium\\" by Pet Shop Boys is a suitable choice for those who like at least one Pet Shop Boys compilation and/or music containing chill-out elements.
B001NHN7TU|5.0|Great cast.  The story works.  And the \\"making of\\" feature is fabulous.  I have always loved this movie and this package is fantastic.
B008NW67E0|4.0|\\"Babel\\" by Mumford and Sons is certainly a different musical departure from \\"Sigh No More\\".  As with many other people, \\"I Will Wait\\" was my introduction to \\"Babel\\". \\"Holland Road\\", \\"Lover Of The Light\\",  and \\"Lover's Eyes\\" are some of the songs that embody the heart of \\"Babel\\".  I also like \\"Not Haste\\" and \\"For Those Below.\\" \\"Babel\\" is great for those who enjoy \\"Sigh No More\\" and/or are open to listening to folk rock.
0061537969|5.0|Get ready... get ready to have every single one of your emotions tugged. The Art of Racing in the Rain is now one of my all-time favorite books. It offers so much more than a singular, one-dimensional plot; as with all books of merit, this one is not meant to be dissected, but rather, one upon which to meditate -- leave your armor at the gate before entering and allow yourself to savor the philosophy. If you spend too much time analyzing whether or not relationships such as the ones presented are realistic or if the storyline is too contrived, then you will miss the grand point of it all. Well written books purposefully use characters and scenarios to guide the reader along the author's carefully cultivated path in order to present ideas and conjure up emotion, beckoning you to contemplate \\"Now, what do you really believe about what I just said now that you're safely tucked away in the cocoon of your own mind where nobody can judge you?\\" The Art of Racing in the Rain has accomplished this more beautifully than any other book I've read. There are so many things about it that I adore: Enzo, the wonder dog and narrator extraordinaire (gawd, how could you not want to take him home with you?!); the love and friendship shared between Enzo & his best friend & caretaker, Denny; Denny himself, despite his flaws; the ingenious racing car metaphors; the courageous undertaking of controversial themes regarding life, death, and the afterlife that thread the story together; the subtle reflection regarding one of life's biggest questions... how far will you go to chase your dreams before it's no longer worth the price of admission? This book is a roller coaster of sensations that will take you so far down that you get angry at the author, Garth Stein, for making you care as much as you do before he gently lifts you out of the depths with his well-planned rainbow ending... but not before making you shed a bucket of tears before you get there. The Art of Racing in the Rain is no less than a stunningly beautiful book to be embraced.<br /><br />Thanks go to T H Water for this review.
B007THA4FI|3.0|not all bad. she should return to the style who suits her better. I have faith in the future of this writer
0062197258|4.0|Here is what the book did well.  It was a nice portrayal of how Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) works, especially as a coping mechanism for trauma.  Plus its separation of OCD and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) was nicely explained and demonstrated by the lead character Cathy.  Essentially it clearly showed how an individual with OCD tendencies could lose control of their life when subjected to a vicious long term attack.<br /><br />Too often we would look at those exhibiting OCD symptoms and wonder why they just don't knock it off (They door is locked already).  Mrs. Haynes wonderfully opens up this world of compulsion and the need for safety that is beyond their control.  How they are always seeking comfort and security, and how they wish they could just leave it more than you do.<br /><br />The other thing I really liked was the reliance of friendship and support.  When Lee (the villain) was able to infiltrate Cathy's closest friends and sow the seeds of doubts, she became more and more isolated.  This allowed Lee to gain more power over her life, cutting off all avenues of escape.  It wasn't till many years later through the friendship of her neighbor was she able to start her recovery.  When times get tough it is our relationships that will get us through.  We need others for support and love when life doesn't work out.  That is why it is important to just be there for our friends when they are suffering, not necessarily to provide solutions, but just to listen.<br /><br />As a point of personal preference the author told two different timelines in alternating chapters.  We see Cathy as she gets involved with Lee paired with Cathy 4 years later in recovery.  This style worked but I would rather have had a part one and two, but as I said that is not a knock on the book; it is just what I like.  I supposed the advantage is we got to see the parallel of Cathy going from a free spirit to a mentally destroyed individual with a traumatized victim gaining her inner-strength back.  Clever, but a little to much in your face for me.<br /><br />Finally I thing a PTSD/OCD challenged girl just happens to have a trained psychologist move into her upstairs apartment just when she is ready for recovery was a little to convenient for the plot.  It detracted from the tension the author was presented with the rest of the book.  Anotherwords it was hard to get into the serious darkness of the plot when a metaphorical flashlight was right there.<br /><br />Overall an excellent first novel that kept me entertained.  I very much look forward to Mrs. Haynes sophomore effort.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Really enjoyed this book, great central character, can't wait for the next one.  I immediately looked for book two when I finished, hope it comes out soon.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Sons of Anarchy is the best series on TV, hands down!  Kurt Sutter is a masterful writer; each episode leaves you thirsting for more, and Season 4 does not disappoint!  The characters in this series are so flawed, the story line so deep, you can't wait for the next episode to see what's going to happen.  Jax's journey is intoxicating--his internal conflict between what's right and wrong, his passion for SAMCRO and his family, his constant struggle between his loyalty to what he loves and his growing disgust from what he's learned--all make for such a complicated and, yet, addictive story.  All of the actors in this series are amazing; they make their characters so believable, it's hard to remember it's fiction!
B009HSVHV2|5.0|Can't stand the comparisons to the old days. It's not any of the other era's, it' something fresh and new, but it's definitely KISS. I think it's a stronger release than Sonic Boom overall with greater variety lyrically, in particular for Stanley. Upon multiple listens there are some fantastic tunes.<br /><br />Shout Mercy, Long Way Down and Freak are outstanding Paul tunes, with greater variety in his writing than we've seen in some time.<br /><br />Gene is in rare form. Love Gun era good. Back to the Stone Age and Wall of Sound are absolutely fantastic.<br /><br />This disc will get multiple spins.
B007SGM084|4.0|Okay, so this book didn't become a bestseller for the spectacular writing.  The writing is a little pedestrian but that beats the heck out of pretentious.  Reading the trilogy is an indulgence, like hiding a box of your favorite chocolates all for yourself.  If you are worried about the \\"naughty\\" bits - relax.  As much as the main character bemoans \\"vanilla\\" sex, even the bondage and S&M is quite tame by most standards.  The trilogy starts off with a BANG that really hooks you but by the third book it gets a little \\"bleh.\\"  By that time the author throws in a little cloak and dagger with the whips and chains just to spice things up.  Don't get me wrong, the book is still worth the read and almost worth the outrageous price for the Kindle download (don't get me started on that).  I gave this book 4 stars for originality, fresh perspective, and daring to go \\"there.\\" If you're going to give it a try, do yourself a favor and read all three of the set.

B000FQIRXQ|3.0|This movie was exellant as far as I could tell. However I am extremly<br />hard of hearing and this DVD was advertised to have \\"closed caption\\"as did the back cover say the movie was \\"closed caption\\".Of<br />course it was not \\"closed caption\\" nor did it have sub titles.I do not blame Amazon for this as they had no way of telling.However I do<br />fault whoever makes these dvd's for BBC. BBC needs to be aware that<br />at least this dvd was not as it should have been. I did however watch<br /> the movie with hearing aids in, but could still understand very little<br />of what they were saying.
B006R1T40I|5.0|Bonnie Raitt is one thing<br />  That is one fine and incredible artist as anyone with any brains knows..<br />  We were lucky God created her for our enjoyment.<br /><br />This is another incredible CD by her.<br />  One that will be in the records books and our CD racks for many moons .<br /><br />  I am just happy I am on her list for Pre Orders.....so I don't miss any of her new CD's<br /><br />Not much that's a hell of allot better than putting 5 Raitt CD's in my player ( that's the max that will fit in my player) and just do whatever I am with her in the background and especially the foreground if I can give her my full attention!
B000GCFY0I|5.0|I read this entire series very quickly. The few weeks after reading it I kept finding myself saying things like \\"This is dizzy-making\\" and adding -wa to the end of everything. This is an amazing book and is much better than the Hunger Games.

B008Y2FRFO|4.0|its just a little game to pass time. requires a little skill but not something that will get you frustrated.
1476712042|3.0|I liked the book.  I didn't like that Travis had the ability to be very violent, but I think that will be explained in \\"Walking Disaster\\" so I am holding my judgement for that.<br /><br />Abby \\"Pigeon\\" was not well developed to my taste.  I actually liked Shep and America's characters better and they were definitely more likable.  There are a bunch of grammatical errors and repetitious dialogue.  I don't need every character's name to be repeated in the dialogue.  The average reader can figure out who said what.  It is really not that hard.<br /><br />The one thing I would suggest to the author is to get a good editor before publishing \\"Walking Disaster\\" because she is in dire need of one!
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This was my first Blake Crouch book and boy was I not disappointed.  I was so intrigued with this story and the multiply twists and turns that I couldn't put it down.  Every time I thought I had an idea of what might be going on I was pleasantly surprised by the author with more twists, which left me scratching my head and wanting nothing more than to read on.  I was fully drawn into this story as if I was in this mysterious little town myself and was observing everything Ethan was going through. Wonderful imagination and right up my alley when it comes to a shocker.  I won't say anything beyond that, as I would never put any spoilers in this review.  Pick this one up and read it if your into the X-Files, Fringe, Twilight Zone, or any of those types of mysterious Sci-Fi shows and want a great little story that you haven't heard yet.  Enjoy!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app for my kindle fire but it does &quot;quit unexpectedly &quot; a lot..... hopefully they can update it from doing that then it will be perfect!!

B0098VXE50|4.0|This is not your average Snow White movie. In fact, it is better than the fairy tale. Lots of action and great acting from the mighty Thor and of course your Twilight actress. Defintely a good movie and worthy of being owned.
B0061S073A|5.0|Love this app.  It makes it safe for me to let my 2year old play with my kindle fire.  I highly recommend it!!
B004O3YGMC|4.0|The product does work, although there is a delay in actions of operation. It is slower than actually working directly on your computer.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I think that spending time in God's word is vital to having a close relationship with him. We as christians have a large role in holding up society and solving problems wisely and we can not do it without God's wisdom and the encouraging words that he gives us in the Bible. I strongly believe that his words are a place of refuge in our times of greatest need. I do enjoy speaking with him through his holy word recorded in the Bible and I believe that any person who dares to call himself a Christian should as well. For in the words ofGod believers are commanded to read and obey.

B007IXWL2C|1.0|Fifty shades too much!  Unreadable.  I never would have bought this book if it was not for my 21 year old daughter, who loved the first two books.  The trilogy should have been combined into one book.  I guess the author wanted the money.
055357342X|5.0|I love this series, and this book (the 3rd) has been the best of the first 4. I haven't read book 5 yet, but I am hopeful it will be as good as this one.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|I thought the first book was readable.  I thought this book was redundant.  The author uses the same words and phrases over and over.  Very predictable.
B008C1O8CA|1.0|They were an ordinary 90s band with their major label debut, then later wrote cliched tunes that were mistaken for being 'serious' by the average idiotic geeks that are likely to watch Friends, go to Starbucks, and use obnoxious 'i'm lygge' language. They have only gotten much worse with time as evidenced here, and their stardom is the cruelest of jokes, alongside the rise of Lindsay Lohan, the Kardashians and others.

B005QUQP76|5.0|Initially the mouse caught my eye because I am a BIG Corsair fan.  Excellent quality products and a company that stands by them.<br />Now that I have had this mouse for a while, man it rocks.<br /><br />My wife even posted on her Facebook page stating that once again it is proven that \\"This proves you really do get what you pay for\\".
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|The Evernote app for Kindle Fire HD loks good and works well. Many apps don't run so quickly and smoothly on my new Fire HD. Evernote deleivers...again! Of course, I really love the ability to share and use notes across all of my computers, tablets and my iPhone.
0385344333|3.0|This book is a page turner, with a lot of fun facts (how many people know 1/81 = .01234567890123456789012345...) and interesting reasoning.  But I was disappointed in the last third of the book, where it got a little too complex for its own good. And come on, are any FBI agents going to take directions from a hitchhiker, no matter what his past creditials are?  Or is it because they are women?
B008X8QCTO|2.0|Not at all happy that I had to pay for a game twice. It says extra content but its not! Its just so you can finish the game! Very disappointed.
0307279189|5.0|This book by McDougal is wonderful.  If you truely \\"love\\" to run you will find this book inspirational.  I wish I could have been part of this group!

159514188X|5.0|I listened to the audio of Thirteen Reasons Why, and I recommend that over reading the book. The audio was done by two narrators, a male for Clay and a female for Hannah. The way it was read it was like we could hear Hannah's tapes the same way Clay did. It brought the reader deeper into the story than just reading alone would.<br /><br />I love Clay. The author was fantastic at his conveying emotions and feelings, and he is just an overall nice guy. I love Hannah too. She seemed so sweet but sad. The things leading up to her suicide seem small as single events, but add them all together and they cumulated to drive her into depression and despair. I think the thing that really made this book great was that the characters seemed so real. Hannah could be the girl sitting alone at the back of the diner while you are messing around with your friends. She had such an ordinary life, but somewhere along the way things started going wrong. She represents all the girls (and boys) who are somehow overlooked in life.<br /><br />I love how the author had 13 stories on 13 tapes but was effectively able to weave them all together. He also showed how small, seemingly insignificant actions can have huge effects. The author was able to put so much emotion in this story, from happiness and joy to pain and sorrow, so be prepared to cry...
B003YL4LYI|5.0|A Dance with Dragons maintains the excitement and originality of the 1st four volumes of A Song of Fire and Ice.  I disagree strongly with the disappointed reviewers.  If GRRM had kept up the same level of conflict as in the first 3 volumes, there would be none of the original characters left at all; there are few enough of them as it is.  GRRM's decision to treat one group of characters in v. 4 and another (favorite?) group in v. 5 rather following a single time sequence is unusual, but workable. I can, however, sympathize with readers who read v. 4 long before v. 5 DwD appeared. There are a number of threads of the plot that are still unresolved.  There is definitely a v.6 in the works, and I look forward to it.
B0057B8PT0|5.0|I fell in love with Olly's radio hit \\"Heart Skips a Beat\\" and decided I needed to hear more.  Realizing there was a British version of the cd with 3 extra songs, I decided to track one down.  I was not disappointed.  There is not a song in the 13 that disappoints!<br /><br />I can honestly say I don't have a favorite song on the cd -- I love them all!  Some songs have a 50s or 60s vibe, but with a modern feel.  On some, he reminds me of Bruno Mars.  This one is a hit with everyone in my household (age range 18 to 54!).  Go for it!

0345472322|3.0|Mindset is a simple concept, but difficult in practice.  The application of which, takes daily vigilance.  I do agree that a mindset can be changed, but it takes time and energy.<br />One problem I anticipate is that those who should read and learn, are those who have no interest.<br /><br />As the book demonstrates, a mindset permeates the full spectrum of your life: Parenting, business, school and relationships.<br />It is a constant battle not to remain in one&iexcl;¯s comfort zone:  how to perpetually view your daily life through a different lens.  I did find interesting the point of importance of the journey and not the destination: Self introspection.  Each day, each action, should be reviewed to improve one&iexcl;¯s life. Learn and improve.<br /><br />But, it does simplify the process.  How does one define improvement?  Often, it is a swing of the pendulum.  How much analysis and learning before a decision should be acted upon?<br />What learnings and more importantly what legislation will come from the financial crises in US and Europe? The natural and nuclear disasters in Japan? The unrest in the Middle East?<br /><br />One point, is that the book provides examples of the growth mindset, but I would highly recommend It Worked For Me ¨C In Life and Leadership by Colin Powell to breathe life in the words of a growth mindset.<br /><br />The final checklist is a very good summary.  A growth mindset leads to a desire to learn and therefore a tendency to<br />1. Embrace challenge<br />2. Persist in the face of setbacks<br />3. See efforts as the path to mastery<br />4. Learn from criticism<br />5. Find lessons and inspiration in the success of others<br />6. As a result, they reach ever-higher levels of achievement.<br /><br />Finally, there are several references of continuous improvement noted in the book; and the vocabulary required to create a learning atmosphere.  I have noted personal key reference points.<br /><br />1. When do you feel smart: It&iexcl;¯s about learning something over time: confronting a challenge and making progress.  Nothing comes simply.<br />2. Praise the effort, not the achievement.<br />3. Ali: that all victories come from here, &iexcl;°hitting his forehead with his index finger.  Then he raised a pair of fists, saying:&iexcl;± Not from here.&iexcl;±<br />4. Take charge of the processes that bring success ¨C and then maintain it.<br />5. Good to Great Leader: self-effacing people who constantly asked questions and had the ability to confront the most brutal answers ¨Cthat is, to look failures in the face, even their own, while maintaining faith that they would succeed in the end.<br />6. Constantly trying to improve.  They surround themselves with the most able people they can find, they look squarely at their own mistakes and deficiencies, and they ask frankly what skills they and the company will need in the future.<br />7. Andrew Carnegie: I wish to have as my epitaph:&iexcl;± Here lies a man who was wise enough to bring into his service men who knew more than he.&iexcl;±<br />8. Gestner (IBM): True self-confidence is the courage to be open-to welcome change and new ideas regardless of their source.  Real self-confidence is not reflected in a title, and expensive suit, a fancy car, or a series of acquisition.  It is reflected in your mindset: your readiness to grow.<br />9. Hierarchy means very little to me.  Let&iexcl;¯s put together in meetings the people who can help solve a problem, regardless of position.<br />10. Genius is not enough; we need to get the job done.<br />11. Groupthink can happen when the group gets carried away with its brilliance and superiority.<br />12. Herodotus: Whenever a group reached a decision while sober, they later reconsidered it while intoxicated.<br />13. Everyone has virtues and foibles, and that, really, if you looked only for perfect people, your social circle would be impoverished.  There was, however, one thing she would not put up with: People who made her feel bad about herself.<br />14. You have to apply yourself each day to becoming a little better.  By applying yourself to the task of becoming a little better each and every day over a period of time, you will become a lot better.<br />15.

B001QOGYFO|4.0|Kate Beckinsale stars as a US Marshal at an international research station in Antarctica while Tom Skerritt plays the friendly doctor. The Marshal's about to leave the station as the Winter season sets in when she's forced to investigate a questionable death that becomes a murder investigation.<br /><br />Although the trailer hints of a supernatural film a la [[ASIN:B0002CHK1S The Thing (Collector's Edition)]], this is actually a mystery thriller with an [[ASIN:B0006B2A42 Ice Station Zebra]] flair.<br /><br />Some of the plot turns are predictable and there's not enough character development, but the spectacular arctic locations and the effective filmmaking compel me to give this 4 stars. Maybe a weak 4 stars, but 4 stars nevertheless.<br /><br />I said \\"arctic locations\\" because the film was shot in Manitoba, not Antarctica.<br /><br />Pay no mind do those who say this is a crappy film. If you're in the mood for a modern Ice stataion Zerbra film with SOME elements of The Thing then Whiteout should fill the bill. It won't blow you away or anything (except maybe an early shot of Kate, lol) but it's a solid arctic mystery-thriller.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|After reading the first two books, I was a little scared to read the third. So many things could happen but I didn‘t see a “Happy Ending“ for the Girl On Fire. Reading this book brought so many emotions to the surface; fear, anger, confusion, etc. But most of all: hope. I hoped with all my heart that somehow Katniss would survive the war in one piece. I‘m not one to spoil a book so I won‘t go into details but this book was everything I could've asked, wished or begged for. It was amazing!

1475143389|2.0|I would certainly recommend the book for any novice or someone relatively new (1-2 years) to hypertrophy training. It is well written and provides a good deal of useful information. Note that the book has a large percentage dedicated to diet, which may or may not put off some readers.  The aforementioned points in isolation would result in a 5 star rating.<br /><br />However, I am going to penalise the book by 3 stars for the following reason:<br /><br />Michael slams evil protein powder companies and the like, saying that body builders and magazines are all tied to these big companies. Unfortunately he then provides a link to a one year program he created, of which it is filled with his specific recommendations for what to buy AND links to Amazon to buy the very products he promotes. There is no disclaimer (unless I overlooked it) that he has no conflict of interest and does not receive a commission from these companies to promote the products. My trust in him largely went out the door on this point. I quote \\"They (the magazines) give you a lot of advice that is geared first and foremost to selling you products, not helping you achieve your goals\\" (page 3 of introduction, and similar other quotes throughout the book). I therefore found his direct links to buy certain protein products and gym equipment a bit hard to swallow. What a letdown!<br /><br />If you can live with the above and therefore believe you can perhaps ignore this contradiction and trust the guy, parting with the $10 or visiting his website for the free download (which publishes the routines in any case) go for it.

B004PVKFR8|5.0|Bought this album after hearing and enjoying \\"Sail\\" & \\"Not Your Fault.\\" Definitely one of the best decisions I've made recently - the songs are catchy, interesting, and manage to blend a variety of music genres in a harmonious way. Can't wait to hear more from these guys.
B007VUCAVO|4.0|I like the look and function. I have not run the indivdual callibration because it says it take over an hour and the battery needs to be 60%. I usually use my Fire to read & browse in bed and the battery is usually below before I'm ready to go to sleep.<br />Also, I like the spoken battery level alert and have all the 10's set, but it only tells me the 1st discharging (ie, 90%). Even though I also have 80% checked to alert, it doesn't. When charging it only announces when the battery is fully charged, although I've checked 10%, 20%, etc.<br /><br />I still liked it enough to buy the Pro version.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|We all have those things in our pack that dont seem to make their way out, mine was a three grit stone. Why dont I have this? I dont anymore, I got this. Course and fine (carbide,ceramic) stones. About three inches long very nice! Put a cord loop on it, and you cant go wrong. Other models I saw didnt get as good of reviews on amazon and I'm glad I bought this one, the stones are replaceable. The rod is a little narrow for the serrations in my knife. I would buy a few more, a good stocking stuffer as well!

B007TK77QE|1.0|I was so looking forward to reading this book as I am a huge Harry Potter fan and think JK Rowling is a genius. However I just cannot get in to her new book. I have read almost 50% and am struggling to get in to the story at all. It is as if the author is trying too hard. I sure hope the story picks up or I may not bother finishing it. Harsh words from someone who has read each of the Harry Potter books  at leats three times.
B0029QRA1U|1.0|I read the reviews and knew the player was garbage, but I didn't want to spend a whole lot and this one was cheap. I bought this January 16th and its now crapped out on me. The speed has slowed down and the records aren't played at the appropriate speed.<br /><br />Whoever reads this and you're thinking about buying it because of the price don't. Save your money and buy a better one.
B009NPKTN6|2.0|As someone who grew up the Eighties, Who lived that music, saw many of those bands play live, and had every one of those albums the day they came out, I have to say this movie pretty much just took a dump on everything that music represents for me. What the heck? Those songs were one of a kind originals, performances by artists that are not meant for a musical. They are Rock and Roll songs, music with Balls and raw passion, not Broadway songs to be performed with that sterility, by actors and then overmixed. Gah!!! Gah!!! The only good line: \\"I just threw up. In my pants. Out of my ass.\\"
0385343175|1.0|I have ups and downs with Danielle.  I have read about 5.  Liked two.  This one?  OMG this was a story about a great little kid who grew up to be a brat BRAT as a young adult.  Surrounded by a hotel.  Throw in a Dad who spoilt her rotten and his girl friend who should have stayed away.  Sorry, little venting there.  This book was one of those books you kept thinking, maybe it will be better in the next chapter and then oops, you are done reading and you think....what was this?  Seriously, if this was DS first book yes but hello she has written a ton of successful books.  Then how things wrap up to get to the ending was too mediocre for me. I don't know how reviewers gave more than one star unless they are diehard DS fans and like everything she writes no matter what...not me, guess this is the last for me..mad at myself for finishing it.

B008N9AAQ4|3.0|I saw Samsara about a week ago in the theater. It was originally released back in September 2011 at the Toronto International Film Festival. I had checked out the critics reviews and most gave the thumbs up. Let me say I have seen Baraka and have it on blu ray and was blown away the first time I saw it. When I heard that Samsara was in production starting in 2007 I eagerly awaited it's release for 4 years. After watching Samsara, I came away disappointed. It did not have the same powerful emotional or visual effect on me that Baraka did and still does. I have watched Baraka many many times. Samsara seems to be image without coherence like one other reviewer has stated. To me the music also did not have that powerful emotional kick that Baraka does. The images are very good in Samsara and some of the music is good. I will buy Samsara on blu ray, but for me Baraka will always be the litmus test.
B0055SWM08|5.0|this is a relaxing game to play anywhere. it works great on the kindle fire and has beautiful graphics and sounds. it's just a nice little game, and it is dedinitely worth the $0.99!

B003YL4LYI|5.0|The book itself is fantastic. Martin impresses yet again with a fantastic piece of literature. I'm still getting used to reading on a kindle, but it's been fun so far. It's nice to be able to take it around with me wherever I want without lugging that big, heavy tome with me.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved this book just like the first one! I love Christian and Ana's love. The suspense is great. Cant put it down.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I LOVE the Jack Reacher series, and I've them read all. I usually can't put a Jack Reacher novel down once I start, but this one sometimes took a backseat to Free Cell.  Although the action-filled climax was as good as usual, for the most part I didn't care about the characters.  It was the least satisfying of the series so far.
1577314808|5.0|A book that shows you how you've lied to yourself, how it's caused you pain, and leads you to discover truth.
B006PTL1QM|5.0|I think this was an exceptional and brilliant film and give it 5 stars, but I have been reading the work of Freud and Jung for thirty years and I think that many people unfamiliar with the history of psychoanalysis would find this film too complex and dense to be enjoyed. That is a shame since the themes explored are fascinating and the acting was first rate. But the bottom line is that this is a film that will appeal to a limited audience of intellectual viewers.<br /><br />The primary focus of the film was divided between the psychological struggles of a brilliant young woman and the sexual and intellectual struggles of a brilliant psychologist attempting to forge a model of human consciousness and unconsciousness while at the mercy of his own desires and impulses. A secondary theme was the professional scientific and personal relationship between Sigmund Freud and Carol Jung over a 7 year period critical to the development of the field of psychoanalysis.<br /><br />Carl Jung was very familiar with the work of Sigmund Freud and began writing to him about there mutual interests in abnormal psychology. But the two men were very different in many ways and these differences eventually lead to tension in their relationship. The film does a credible job of contrasting Freud, an Austrian Jewish physician, and the wealthy Jung, a privileged Swiss psychiatrist. Early in the film Jung begins to use Freud's method of analysis whereby the psychiatrists sits behind the patient so as to reduce projection onto the psychiatrist and to create a more ambiguous sensation for the patient so that they can actually focus on their own projections and images without looking to the therapist for approval or disapproval. Jung complains that Freud writes much about the intellectual side of the analysis without giving many details as to the actual implementation of the methodology, thus early in the film Jung's independent thought is demonstrated.<br /><br />Freud saw Sabrina Spielrein as apatient when she was 19 years old and published her case history as the case of Sabrina S. It is Emma Jung in the film who tells the viewer that surely this Sabrina S written about by Freud is the same Sabrina Spielrein who has been admitted to the psychiatric hospital under the care of Dr. Jung.<br /><br />Michael Fassbender does an outstanding job as he plays Carl Jung. The character of Jung is pivotal in this film and Jung is a brilliant but conflicted human being. Jung was an outstanding genius, comparable to the genius of Freud, but he loses his bearings when he begins an affair with Sabrina Spielrein. His attempts to gain control of himself and the relationship reveal his cold determination which Fassbender plays very well. Fassbender's athletic sexual physique appears to be ready to explode out of the tight Victorian clothing that binds him much as Jung's sexuality is exploding out of his overly controlled intellect. Jung may appear overly harsh, controlled and rejecting as he ends the affair with Spielrein but he was becoming unhinged from the ground upon which he had built his personal, intellectual and professional life.<br /><br />Kira Knightly does a superb job of playing Sabrina Spielrein. Spielrein has neurotic tics that manifest when painful or conflicting memories emerge. The early scenes where Spielrein relates to Jung how often her father whipped her naked behind and then forced her to kiss his hand after the whipping are very powerful. As a child Spielrein would sometimes urinate in fear while being whipped and her father would whip her again for the urination. She now dreams of a catlike creature whispering into her ear as a slug like creature crawls on her lower back. Jung is able to connect that Spielrein would masturbate to images and memory of physical punishment and that pain had thus become eroticized for her. Knightly was able to portray mental illness, repressed eroticism and intellectual acuity in one outstanding performance.<br /><br />Vincent Cassel deserves mention for the part he plays as Dr. Otto Gross, another brilliant but unstable mind in an addict. However it is in conversation with the way-out Gross that Jung comes to terms with his passion for a brilliant and beautiful patient.<br /><br />Viggo Mortensen plays Sigmund Freud with careful understatement. Freud believed that in Jung he had finally found the champion, the heroic son, who would carry his theories forward. Much of their relationship in the film vibrates between a father-son relationship, a mentor-mentee relationship, and a professional competition. Of course the scene is included where Freud and Jung share dreams on the voyage to America and Freud tells Jung that one dream he can not reveal since he would lose his `authority' which Jung relates as the point where Freud lost all authority for him. It is to the film's credit that it includes the discussions between Freud and Jung on strategy whereby Freud wished their work to remain focused, concentrated, demonstrable, and repeatable whereas Jung was becoming more expansive, overly inclusive, and willing to explore paranormal experiences that are almost impossible to demonstrate or repeat under controlled conditions. Both strategies may advance scientific thought but the tensions eventually disrupt their personal and professional relationships.<br /><br />Eventually the tables turn as Spielrein emerges from her neurosis and becomes a brilliant psychoanalyst in her own right, mentored and complimented by Sigmund Freud.<br /><br />Thus this 99 minute films is about two complex themes; the development, expression, and repression of sexual desires as demonstrated in the relationship of Spielrein and Jung and the creation, translation and re-creation of complex scientific ideology as demonstrated in the relationship of Jung and Freud.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|The best book in the series! The quality of writing is not the best and the author jumps around alot which is annoying and seemed like she got tired of writing so she just stopped a scene. Other than that it was fun and entertaining. Guilty pleasure!
B0041KKYEM|2.0|I must say this movie was incredibly disappointing. A very bad film. Neurotic Natalie Portman doesn't get an anxiety-filled look off of her face for one minute. She is thoroughly unappealing as a character. Throughout she is a tortured soul--but one who no one could ever care about. Her demonic female rival in the film, Mila Kunis, who is out for ballet blood, is equally unappealing. There is no worthwhile revelation in this film: We all know the unbelievably intense desire it takes to be a successful ballet dancer. This film does nothing to elevate our knowledge. Well then: Is it supposed to be scary? It wasn't. Is it supposed to increase our awareness of the pressures of \\"dance?\\" It didn't. Was it supposed to show us complex artistic personalities? Forget that. Mission not accomplished. If the purpose was to illustrate that masochism is around in this artistic genre...well maybe. That's about all the various major characters in this film are good for. But even the masochism is poorly portrayed. What I mean is that one sees the pain and just says \\"yuck\\" as opposed to \\"I wish it wasn't happening.\\" Winona Ryder--whose character was the former ballet lead until she suffers a debilitating accident--was wasted in this movie: She just seemed like a player in a bad \\"B\\" horror flick. One doesn't care about her either. The male mentor of Ms. Portman, Vincent Cassel, is just an oversexed crude cad. (Why would anyone go to him for advice as Ms. Portman does? Why would any woman find him attractive? And why--one ponders--was he ever hired by a reputable ballet company? Yet he's central. (As he would be in a badly done feature like this one.)  If Barbara Hershey, Portman's mother, had sprouted horns, it would have added some sane symmetry to the putrid movie--as in what should happen in a bad pic of this kind.<br /><br />Even the dancing was uninspiring in this film, although the dancers do manage to get up on their tippy toes. But we don't see much of that. What we mostly seeis people in wheelchairs cutting themselves, female neurotics cat-fighting or bloodily wounded, weirdo hallucinations, and an all-around strain of repulsive creepiness within characters that is hard to take.<br /><br />Some viewers might say the film was \\"interesting\\" or \\"unusual,\\" a \\"psycho-thriller.\\" I say: I can't remember using my fast-forward button so much, and that I just uttered \\"good riddance\\" when Natalie Portman was lying on her back severely stabbed at the end of the movie.
B001DJ7PNW|5.0|This movie has all the hallmarks that make it special. It's riveting viewing from start to finish. The acting is excellent and the quality of the blu-ray version is top class.<br /><br />The thorough analysis of the assassination of JFK as portrayed in this movie is a great starting point for anyone wishing to understand this very tragic event. The investigative procedure embarked upon elicited in me the image of one peeling an onion for the first time and then discovering surprises and great revelations with each new layer.<br /><br />This is a movie that entertains and is also thought provoking. Although it's a very long movie I thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish.
B0042RJWTC|3.0|The set itself is nice, i love the case it came in, but most the discs skipped and i would have to go back and rewind it to attempt it to play through or just skip the scene all together. I love the series either way so i can deal witg missing a scene or 2 on most discs.

B0074D3CAQ|4.0|Harold's  pilgrimage was an unexpected pleasure.  I found a delightful mix of descriptions of the  English countryside and the odd gaggle of characters met along the way.  Each revelation of Harold's history and character added depth and truth to the man looking for some redemption for a life more observed than lived.  This story took me on a lovely, charming, and bittersweet pilgrimage of my own.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved Eva and Gideon love story but this book was driving me crazy. I hated and loved Gideon all at the same time. The author had me in full anticipation trying to figure out what Gideon was up to the whole time. It just killed me that I waited two months to get the book and read the whole thing in a day for now wait two more months for the third book to come out. I cant wait to read how Gideon and Eva turn out and hoping that their love is strong enough to survive everything that they have already gone through and what they will go through in the third book.

B001BR5NN0|3.0|I love this movie. The only problem is that there must be more than one version. Where is the part where they take up a collection for drinks at lunchtime? Remember, Molly Ringwold asks for change for a hundred? Other than that, it is an AWESOME video!
B001RUXW48|4.0|Held my attention for two hours. Wasn't entirely predictable. Acting was good. More than I can say for a lot of movies I've seen recently.

B002GY9F9K|5.0|I watched this on NetFlix and became completely addicted - excellent entertainment & exceptional production quality!! Had to own it - I have watched it 3 times and so enjoy the complexity and how masterfully interwoven the plot & characters are. Originally ordered with Amazon, but they cancelled my order after I paid - becoming all too common on Amazon these days :( - Went to Ebay and found it for ten dollars with free shipping - turns out it was my win :) Enjoy!!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The first book in the trilogy is definitely the best out of the three.  One would definitely need to read them in order to understand.

B008E6I1K8|5.0|I've put over 30+ hours into this book and I love it.<br /><br />It's title lives up to the name. A clear and precise approach to what feels like everything in C#.<br /><br />I've discovered some real gems in this book even though I've been developing for several years in the .net framework.<br /><br />I recommend this book to everyone. It will be my reference book for a while.

B000MRX2DI|5.0|This product was purchased as a gift between two of my children.  It has added nicely to our collection and will be enjoyed for years.  Arrived promptly and as advertised.  Great transaction.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|great game. A lot of fun. Just like at the fairs. very, very addictive and you can't put it down. Kids will also love it. Try it you'll love it.
B009GEEMLY|3.0|This movie was okay. The story line was a little off. The action scenes were pretty good. Some of the acting was really cheesy.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Throughout the books, the love scene chapters were just too redundant.  I liked the story line.  I wish the author had a larger palette for descriptors.
B007THA4FI|5.0|This book was fabulous, heart wrenching and depicted flawed people at their worst. Characters were well developed and beautiful. Looking forward to her next one!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I enjoyed the banter between the Dom and the Girl - at least the emails to each other were clever and fun to read.  In general, I liked the series or I would not have continued reading them.  Just the lovemaking became quite boring to read the same - o, same - o.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|As usual- Kurt and his team nailed it!!!! The only drawback is having to wait for the next season!!!!  Awesome show!!!!
B000007UTN|5.0|I received my vinyl copy of Radiohead's 1997 release \\" Ok, Computer\\".  2 days ago and haven't stopped playing it yet. I suspect that it will be the only album on the turntable for a while.As I unwrapped it I noticed how much more it seemed to weigh (180 g vinyl) . It was definitely put together with deliberate care. The album has 2 discs / 4 sides of music; each disc is in a separate paper sleeve with a plastic lining in addition to the original cardboard sleeves with the album art printed on both sides. To tell you the truth, I'm impressed.<br /><br />As I slip a disc from its' sleeve searching for \\"side 1 \\" I notice that there is hardly anything printed on the manila colored disc labels like minimalist art , except at the bottom of each disc  you find  the Radiohead logo \\" 2 little stick figures with round heads shaking \\"stick hands\\" and some print designating the order of play for each side. The print is very small, at my age (56 yrs.) I almost have to get a magnifying glass to make it out; however, my bifocals suffice.  The order of play for each side is designated by a simple rhyme, \\" eeny, meeny, miney, moe\\" or one through four accordingly.<br /><br />Put \\"eeny\\" or side 1 on the turntable. The first thing that I notice is the bass response. Sounds like the bass player is standing in the room. And that can be said of all the instruments. I admire the layer of guitars in their songs and this album allows each track to break through in clarity. That is why I enjoy this album so much. The format accentuates their sound by making prominent sounds clearer and subtle sounds more pronounced. What you get is like glass that's been polished. Brilliant<br /><br />And just for the record , so to speak. I don't care what they say about small speakers of present day being as good or better than the stereo speakers of yesteryear; with our tweeters, and our midrange speakers, and that big ole 15 inch woofer on the bottom , that vibrates the ashtrays right off the table and make small animals run for cover under the bed. While here are some wonderfully crafted speakers designed to fit quite easily on a book shelf, or some other space of convenience , Bose comes to mind; I feel unequivocally my big honking stereo cabinets can't be beat.<br /><br />The investment I made to upgrade my turntable to the Audio-Technica AT-LP120 with a Shure cartridge really did allow this wonderfully crafted piece of work to just shine. One thing about Radiohead is either you love 'em or you just don't get it. My impression is that \\"OK COMPUTER\\" is a masterpiece, on vinyl or CD . However, this album gives the listener a full range of frequencies that are just not possible reproduce in a compressed digital format.<br /><br />The only minus to this vinyl version is the album being broken up among 4 sides. I believe that \\"OK Computer\\" is best listened to from beginning to end. The songs seem to segue  into each other, as the CD version allows. However, when it is broken up between 4 sides , the continuity is broken. But all of that said, I still feel this album would be a wonderful addition to anyones vinyl collection.ke small animals run for cover under the bed.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|This was horrible. I didn't finish it. I kept hearing the children's song \\"oh be careful little eyes what you see\\". There was nothing even remotely like a love story. Granted I didn't finish it. I couldn't get thru it!!

B005IQZB14|5.0|For some reason I wasn't expecting much from this book.  I've read a lot of books about hiking the AT but never the PCT, and I don't know much about it.  But it did not matter for this book.  I learned a lot about the PCT and so much more.  Cheryl was unbelievably honest and told us of her every thought/experience, no matter how bad or good.  I loved this book & could not put it down! I'm telling all of my girlfriends and several have read it or going to.  I've already started one of Cheryl's other books.  She is a very skilled, thought provoking and enjoyable author.  I plan to read all of her books!  Thank you for sharing Cheryl!
B00065MDSQ|4.0|A great addition to the classic rock collection.  Well remastered and it brings back great memories.<br /><br />If you're not familiar with King Crimson, listen on YouTube or something first cuz this isn't traditional rock music.<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />AU<br /><br />//(~_~)\\
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is a simple game with good graphics and a patient time line. I love the cute animals. I enjoy the humor. I appreciate the basically undemanding need for attention.<br /><br />As mentioned in other reviews, accidental purchases can happen. I am glad to have been warned.
B000RLHDUM|5.0|The Thomas Crown Affair is an excellent movie, filled with action, suspense, intrigue, and of course a growing love affair.  Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo have never been better than in this classic remake.  Just like Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway in the 1968 original, this movie is great.  I purchased both the original and the 1999 remake from Amazon.com and could not ask for better service or quality.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The first 9/10 of the book are so engaging and captivating....the end is not on par with the rest of the story.  However, still worth it for the terrific 9/10.
B007SGM084|5.0|The trilogy was very interesting, exciting. E L James, captivated his reader from start to finish...  A series of books that is worth reading again... Much enjoyed.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Not a Bad time passer. Game play feels a little slow and a little slow at earning coins. I like a game that rewards with bigger coin payouts. That's what keeps me playing.
B004I744AS|5.0|i really needed this app for educational purposes and it works very well! it is just like the online version, and the formatting of the app makes it very accessable. thanks for this amazing app!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game. I had it on my opossum and when I saw it for kindle fire I was so happy. I can play whenever I want to.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Fun and simple. You can play for hours. It's very addicting to play. Graphics are good and sound effects fit in the game nicely.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|great app I love it great for when you are lonely not very many people know the Bible and those people need
B000FC1K66|3.0|I first tried the movie, and then the book. Both seemed beautiful. Even though Hanna's images changes as she gets old and that made Kid (I've already forgot his name. I remember Hanna.) shocked, Kid stays close to Hanna, and the movement of his heart shows how sensitive he is.
B000YAA68C|5.0|This review is not about the film, but about the packaging and quality of the item itself. The DVD was packaged well, no scratches, and was just as I remembered when I had seen it in theaters. Great purchase!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I loved reading this book because people are always telling me \\"You look like Tina Fey!\\" and so I like to imagine that I act like her, too. It's been confirmed- I'm not nearly as hilarious but we do have self-deprecation in common. I consider that a win! You will laugh out loud- so don't read this in a library or a church. Enjoy!
B00795P4EG|3.0|This app does a great job with photo retouching. However, it often times randomly zooms out or completely closes the photo I'm working on. That's annoying. Hopefully it will be fixed in an update. Running on Kindle Fire HD.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|[[ASIN:0385344228 Defending Jacob: A Novel]] It grabbed my attention right from the beginning. I couldn't put it down. I especially liked the surprise twist. The author did a great job pulling you in and keeping you there until the very end :)

0440245931|5.0|John Grisham's \\"The Pelican Brief\\" is a thriller that takes a young Tulane University law student named Darby Shaw from a life focused on her studies and a love affair with a professor to a life threatened by death at every corner brought on by the assassinations of two Supreme Court justices.  The plot unfolds after the release of a legal brief written by Darby that exposes suspects and a motive behind the slayings of the justices<br />  The story begins in Washington D.C. with the assassination of the liberal Justice Rosenberg in his home by a lone shooter.  The same assassin strangles the conservative Justice Jensen the same night in a nearby gay porn cinema.  The media immediately jumps all over the assassinations and begins spreading conspiracy theories.  These assassinations are the basis of the story's plot.<br />  The story shifts focus to Darby Shaw and her lover and professor, Thomas Callahan, in New Orleans.  Darby is a dedicated law student at Tulane who decides to research and write a legal brief, \\"The Pelican Brief,\\" exposing who assassinated the justices and what their motive was.  Little did Darby know, her brief accurately identified the conspiracy behind the assassinations and set in motion the crisis of \\"The Pelican Brief.\\"<br />  Darby shows the report to her lover Thomas.  He is intrigued by the theory and sends a copy to his friend Gavin Verbeek, a lawyer for the FBI.  Gavin in-turn shows the brief to other friends and soon enough the brief is being read by several government agencies throughout Washington, to include the White House.<br />  After a night out drinking in New Orleans, Darby fails to convince a very drunk Thomas not to drive home.  Thomas is killed when his car explodes.  Thomas's death turns Darby's life upside down.  She is now a target of the same assassin that killed the justices and now her lover. Darby turns to one of Thomas' friends for help but he is quickly killed by the assassin.  She becomes even more suspicious of everything and everyone.  She is afraid that anyone she turns to will end up dead.  She seems almost accepting that her fate is sealed.  She is convinced that she will stay on the run hiding in alleys but eventually she will be found and killed.<br />  She uses disguises and frequently changes hotels trying to stay one step ahead of the assassin \\"Patience will get me (Darby) killed. They're after me\\" (Grisham, 1992, p. 146).  Eventually Darby relents and realizes that her running cannot continue she will soon run out of places to hide.  Darby seems defeated and reluctantly reaches out to a reporter for help.  Darby leaves New Orleans and travels to New York and eventually meets Gray Grantham, the Washington Post reporter.  She remains very cautious keeping her disguises and moving covertly and only meeting Gray on her terms to maintain a low profile.<br />  Darby frequently reminisces about life before she wrote the brief.  She thinks often about Thomas and how much she loved him and misses him \\"but after her eyes open...her first thought was always of Thomas\\" (Grisham, 1992, p. 197).  Yet she sees no future for herself, as if her life ended with Thomas.  Darby seems to be on a mission to survive not for the sake of saving her life but to not let the assassin win.<br />  Grisham shifts occasionally from Darby's struggle for survival to the actions taking place at the White House and other government agencies.  The White House receives information that the brief might describe the President receiving campaign contributions from the assassin.  The White House is feverishly trying to determine who wrote the brief, what it says about the president and who else has read the brief.  The CIA and other agencies are searching frantically for clues and developing contingency plans in case the president is implicated.<br />  Darby is getting tired of running and is getting desperate to find safety.  Gray convinces her that they must find evidence to support the brief and go public with the story.  After several meetings with Gray, Darby slowly lets down her guard and begins to trust him \\"His face said `Trust me' And why not\\" (Grisham, 1992, p. 247).  She even begins to gain hope that Gray will be able to help.<br />  Darby and Gray travel to Washington and go on the offensive.  Her mission has changed from surviving to pursuing the assassin \\"I'm just trying to nail the man\\" (Grisham, 1992, p. 322).  She is after the evidence to get justice for Thomas.  The tension ratchets up when Darby and Gray finally track down the tapes that prove the brief.  Although she is still in danger, Darby gains the upper-hand when she and Thomas arrive at the Washington Post office with the tape and brief in hand.  She lays out her demands to the editor and staff.  Darby gets vindication when the newspaper editor calls the White House and the lawyer for the assassin to break the news.  Darby knows that now the story will be published exposing the conspiracy and giving Thomas justice.<br />  Darby has come to trust Gray, but she still does not trust anybody else.  To ensure that she is not followed, she demands a getaway that includes several detours to avoid being followed.  She will never fully trust everybody but she has found peace on an island in St Thomas and a friend in Gray.<br />  Grisham's \\"The Pelican Brief\\" is an exciting thriller that follows a law student as she narrowly escapes death in her pursuit to get justice for her lover.  Darby Shaw goes from New Orleans to New York and onto Washington to expose an assassination conspiracy that reaches up to the White House.<br /><br />Grisham, J. (1992). The Pelican Brief.

B0000DI886|5.0|Both of these movies were birthday gifts for a 14 year old.....she really, REALLY enjoyed them! We watched these movies together and they sure did bring back some good memories!
B00913DPW2|3.0|This game was far too difficult.  I like a good mystery but there was nothing intuitive about this application at all.  You just go back and forth through the rooms of the house collecting objects and then have no idea what to do when you find them.  The mini games, which are the backbone of the hunt, are ridiculously difficult and make no sense at all.  Overall, frustrating and boring.  I just didnt get it.  If you want to keep people interested you have to throw them a bone now and then.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|It is fun but is like a money eater. Not good for little kids<br />because you can spend money without knowing it.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This is only my second adventure game, and I really enjoyed this one.  I found it to be incredibly difficult and time-wasting in a good way.  I was at times stumped on several of the puzzles and did get frustrated.  This was a thinking game and not nearlt as simple as the previous one which was more or less just a glorified I Spy game.  Overall a good level of challenge.  Graphics and storyline were excellent.  Well done!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This movie was fast-paced and fun. The dialogue was my favorite part. Even though it was a fairly long movie, there was not enough time to fully develop all of the characters, since there were so many main characters. Still, it's well worth an investment.
B0086700CM|5.0|Some of the reviews say that this game lags, but my kindle fire has not only been flawless when playing this epic, highly addictive endless running thriller, but it's graphics are very high quality. I recommend it to literally everyone.
1609611543|5.0|I have not found anything so far that is not true about this book. I was shocked by some of the things.... but so far, I have found it all to be true enough. And I have so far lost about 20lbs although I cut out more than just wheat. I have had no stomach aches which I used to get. Overall inflammation is much improved as is rashes and my wifes dark circles under her eyes. We have been following a ketogenic diet and our blood sugar is stabilized... no more ups and downs because you eat a muffin. That really is kind of nuts.<br />So I would recommend this book to any thinking person.

B000OZ0NXA|3.0|I so looked forward to reading the jack reacher novels by lee child.  Starting with the first book in the series seemed like a good idea.  When the novel was ported to ebook, did nobody actually look at how the book would appear on the kindle?  Micro sized print detracts from the reading experience.  Each chapter starts with the first line in micro print?  Ebooks may be a new medium for selling books but if you can't read fine print, this novel will drive you crazy.  Just sayin
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. it has a good story. is challenging but not too hard. isn't too short. graphics.  are great. really enjoyed this game. hope to see more games apps like this.

0316228532|4.0|A novelist who switches genres (i.e., from children's fiction to adult fiction) risks disappointing her fans.  The reviews I've read so far speak to the dissonance Harry Potter fans feel when they encounter a novel that echoes (in my estimation) those of P. D. James.  James's characters are seldom likeable, but James strives for truth-telling:  most people, in life as in her novels, are not pleasant people.  The same is true of Rowling's new novel:  telling the truth about one's characters is what Rowling's novel is about.  It's not sweet reading.  But it has the punch of truth:  the truth, as Rowling sees it, is not pretty.  If you want pretty and nice, stick to her novels for children;  if you want to understand human nature, read The Casual Vacancy.  The only problem I had with The Casual Vacancy was keeping track of who was who and how the characters related to one another.  But I'm willing to think that this problem is MINE, not the author's.<br /><br />This book is adult reading, not kiddy-lit.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I heard a lot of complaints about how this season stacked up with the previous ones. Granted it wasnt the best season but it was by no means a bad season. A couple times I was left wanting more and it seemed like plot devices were added that didnt make sense for the sake of making it interesting. But overall still a good season. The main baddies this time around left something to be desired however. As dangerous as they were hyped to be I never felt that from the actually story lines. Although I will admit these were a very different type of monster then what the brother were used to. More cunning and stealthy and organised. Still watching the show and excited about season 8.

B007TK77QE|4.0|I HAVEN'T FINISHED THE BOOK YET,BUT AM ENJOYING IT.  THE SOCIETAL JUDGEMENT AND THINGS WE COVET IN SOCIETY ARE DETAILED PERFECTLY IN THE STORY!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I finally let all the hype talk me into reading this and I wish I hadn't. I can usually find the time to finish a series this size in a week- even one I don't really enjoy a lot. I was so annoyed with the repetition of words mumble, mutter, and grey right of the bat that it took me two days just to get through the first two chapters; I kept having to throw it down. You could just instantly tell it was poorly written and poorly edited. It it such a simple read you can tell on certain words she used a thesaurus changing very simple words into the largest word on the list. My English professor would have tossed the book just for that. I can usually find something good to say about a book even if it isn't something I liked but with this, I can't think of a single good thing to say about it other than it ended! I enjoy simple reads when I am really busy, something I don't have to think much on and can kind of let my brain take a break, but this is just awful.<br /><br />As for the characters, it is easier to relate to Grey than it is Ana, and the book is in her point of view. She lacks substance, confidence, strength and the list goes on. I feel the author has failed to give the reader any ways of relating to her characters which makes it hard to connect with them and therefor the book itself. I know it's an erotic Twilight knock off, fan fiction, but these book are weak. Even if you aren't a Twilight fan you can give Stephenie Meyer the ability to develop a solid character that has just enough flaws to make her human but balanced with enough strength that you can see she is the heroine. At least in these books, Grey knows who he is and what he wants, even if he is beginning to struggle with it. The strongest character in this book seems to be the friend Kate, who we don't here much from. I generally read a complete series to know what happens, but in this case I am done after finally finishing the first book. I don't care what happens in the rest, this was so bad, I won't even take the time to look up the synopsis of the other books.
B008XG1X18|3.0|i love pinterest. but it often doesnt work and whoever made this app needs to work on fixing it up a bit.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Rowling's venture into the adult (very adult) novel is good, but no Harry Potter in any way.<br /><br />Her writing is of course superb. Her editor, however, could have been more ruthless regarding early longueurs and overall length. Kudos, however, for getting that \\"casual vacancy\\" established early and quickly; also for the occasional flashes of Rowlingian whimsy despite the somber plot.<br /><br />I won't synopsize that plot here (see preceding reviews). Like Metalious's \\"Peyton Place\\" of the fifties, it packs most of the iniquities of humankind into one very small village. None of the \\"seven deadly sins\\" is left uncommitted here, and few are regretted.  There are a few unlikely happenings, but they do support the developing plot and tragedy; just take 'em with a grain of salt. The characters are generally very well drawn, the women and girls more so than the men and boys.<br /><br />I don't agree with those who consider all the characters except the late Barry irredeemable. Some indeed are. Others, like one (not both!) of the teenage boys, suffer mainly from home life problems and just from being sixteen. A bullied teen turns from depressed and troubled loser into courageous heroine. The tragic character around whom the action revolves is too complex to describe without spoilers, but she might well have triumphed over every obstacle had not Councilman Fairbrother died untimely.<br /><br />**** minus. Pagford is certainly no Hogsmeade, but this is a compelling read whose characters and events will stay with you.<br /><br />Dave<br /><br />P.S. I had no problems with the Kindle version, except for the price. Surely Amazon must have more leverage than that!!<br /><br />Edited to add the following:<br /><br />In surfing through other reviews, I've noticed that some reviewers feel somehow betrayed because this is so gritty a book, featuring so many unlikeable and unsavory characters and unpleasant events. To them, JKR has lost her animated portrait in Dumbledore's office and fallen from grace. After all, even 4 Privet Drive is a way better place than Pagford Village.<br /><br />That's a very unfortunate perspective. It was always clear that \\"A Casual Vacancy\\" would be a new departure. And we all knew that the author's early womanhood was not easy, and had doubtless given her plenty of background on the less pristine side of life. No one had any reason to expect this adult novel to be about Harry and Ginny's halcyon days post-Voldemort.<br /><br />All kudos to the author for having had the guts to write this brave book. You go, Joanne!<br />daa
B0086700CM|5.0|I first downloaded this app and deleted it after trying. ot was lagging and was not at all like the temple run for apple devices. then about 2 months later I got the app again and it is perfect. I give temple run 2 thumbs up.
0307730697|5.0|I just finished reading \\"Fearless\\".  The story is so well told... I feel as if I actually knew Adam Brown.  As a retired Navy veteran and father of two children, the description of his children and his feelings towards them just hit me right in the heart. The sacrifices he made and the difficulties he overcame were just amazing.  The story of his faith is so well presented and shows how a man can be \\"far from perfect\\", and still be a Christian and a Great Father and a Navy SEAL.  Adam's story touched me deeply and brought tears to my eyes.  I STRONGLY recommend this book to everyone. It is so much more than a story about a Navy SEAL.  It is a story about a man, his life, and his struggle to overcome addiction and other evils in his life.  And yes, it is a story of triumph and bravery!  Adam Brown will be sorely missed. Our country has lost a Hero.
B003LFLPGY|5.0|This episode scared me sooooooo much.  I had to use a nightlight during the night because I was so scared of the Weeping Angels and I didn't want them to come and get me!!!!!!!

0385342063|4.0|4 out of 5 stars!! Ms. Kinsella does it again with this fun & quirky novel!! Poppy seemed like a great mix of Emma from \\"[[ASIN:0440241901 Can You Keep a Secret?]]\\" & Samantha from \\"[[ASIN:044024238X The Undomestic Goddess]],\\" making her the typical-quirky-heroine type that Ms. Kinsella puts out and we all love while still having the enjoyable humor that keeps the books lively. Plus, I could not get enough of Sam! He is a stoic yet sexy man who develops into being a great guy in this novel. Sam and Poppy are so cute and sweet together that you just want to root for them and their dreams!!<br /><br />However, this novel will definitely keep you on your toes throughout this fast-paced comedy, especially with all of the sudden twists that arrive in the last few chapters! Some of the twists will shock you and some are ones you probably were hoping for (like me), but all of them make this novel into one that you won't forget about anytime soon!<br /><br />I recommend this novel to those who are fans of Sophie Kinsella, as well as, anyone who enjoys contemporary comedic romances!!<br /><br />- On a side note -<br />I liked the varied footnotes throughout this novel since I thought it was a cute way to enhance the plot. Also, for those who've read Dayla from Confessions of a Book Addict's review of \\"[[ASIN:0385342063 I've Got Your Number: A Novel]]\\" I'm just going to say don't worry about the binding your books since I got my copy at a local book store and it was able to put up with my one year old's antics (like dropping it on the floor repeatedly but accidentally) and still is in one piece looking very good! =0)<br /><br />Review By: From Me to You ...

B008BIN9EW|5.0|once I bought it on my kindle fire I couldn't put it down<br />for a week. challenging campaign,  online gameplay<br />and the ability to have 2 people take turns killing each other on the same device. I love this game
B008G8SFGO|4.0|I have listened to the cd 2 times through. I feel the best song is Hell or Hallelujah. There are about 5 strong songs on the cd. It is great to see KISS finally releasing new material. I gave it 4 stars because I think it stands up to any cd without Peter Criss and Ace Frehley on. If you took the top 4 songs from Psycho Circus, the top 4 from Sonic Boom and the top 4 from Monster, that would be a 5 star album comparable to some of the classic KISS albums we love. I think this cd should be in any KISS fan's collection and also for the new fans. The reason I did not give it a 5 star rating is Paul seems to like to include nursery rhymes on a few songs every album. This started I believe with the Revenge cd and every cd after that. You right a kick ass song then you sing nursery rhymes in the middle of the song. Go figure.... I am glad Kiss finally is releasing new material, we all should be glad and accept it for what it is. What it isnt is what the cd label said  \\"NO FILLER, NO BALLADS, JUST FULL-THROTTLE ROCK N'ROLL.!\\" I think that sums it up. With this album, you get some heavy guitar riffs. I feel Tommy and Eric hav both grown as singers since Sonic Boom. Playing and singing wise, I feel Kiss is at its best, it has been in since the 1st reunion tour. Check out the Monster and let us know what you think!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved this book after hesitating for months to read it.  I was amazed at how I got so attached to and fell in love with the characters.  This is not the type of book I would normally read, but I have to say I was not disappointed.  I can't wait to finish the series and see what happens.  I am also pretty sure that I'll be sad when its over.
B003O86FMW|5.0|a very good second installment from the author, and I‘m looking forward to the last book,and I‘ll be sorry to see it end.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|This was a great movie.  Will most likely watch it a few more times.  The only downside was trying to get it to play through the ps3 onto our tv.  We had to take the laptop and connect it to the tv in order to watch on the larger screen which took away from the graphics slightly.<br />The movie itself is awesome.
0545123275|5.0|One glance at the first page and you will find yourself whisked into the world of Shiver, a love story between wolf and human. Grace, a girl who lives on the edge of an unforgiving forest, always sits in the dead of winter watching the yellow eyed wolf, who watches her back. This wolf is like no other. He saved her. As he watches back he longs to be with her. He enjoys her presence as he lingers at the edge of the woods, the edge between humanity and the fantasy of the ever changing wolves. It all changes in the summer when the heat allows Sam to remain human and they find each other. So then the love story begins. Filled with romance, supernatural fiction, and fantasy this book is one you won't want to miss. It conveys a story with an action packed plot and has a great balance to it. Even more, there is a whole three story trilogy, The Shiver Trilogy: The Wolves of Mercy Falls. This well written novel will have you face to face with the wolves of mercy falls and the unforgettable love of Grace and Sam.<br /><br />-ARB

B008PE9GSA|2.0|There are only three good songs on this whole CD.  Well, maybe two good songs and one decent one.  The rest are pretty lousy.  The instrumentals are fine, but the lyrics (or lack of anything reasonably close to decent lyrics) doom the rest.  The best on the CD is It's Too Easy, Manana, a slow and grinding blues tune.  Heartache in Blue is the most classic blues song, with strong harmonica interplay. Have a Little Mercy is a solid ZZ version of a pop rock song, something with a faster tempo.  Get these three but pass on the rest.

0307744434|2.0|Night Circus's mystical romanticism is evident in luscious descriptions of Paris, frozen wonderlands, magical displays, multi-course meals, and five-star carnival food. It is filled with shimmering, glittering, glowing, scintillating, sparkling, radiant, dazzling, gleaming, shrouded, colorful, and dancing adjectives. Nothing wrong with any of that. But after 200 pages, I was desperate for something bitter to offset all that candy floss.<br /><br />And the story is utterly lacking. Oh it has things we've seen before - in Harry Potter, in Shadowland, in Water for Elephants, and in multiple fantasy novels. But not enough of those things. Harry Potter worked because we felt Harry's pain and could see that Voldemort was indeed evil and needed to be stopped. We could also relate to youthful rebellion against authority. But we get almost none of that here. The teens that must compete with each other do little to push back against their forced entanglement. Though why would they? The adults that force the kids to compete are clearly bad parents, but not evil, though we never really understand their motivation enough to care. And there is nothing really at stake. The magical world the competition creates is little more than a hyper clean, high-quality carnival. (It reminded me of the simulacrum of Martin Dressler; only in that novel it seemed the emptiness of novelty was part of the point.)<br /><br />All too bad really. Morgenstern is a master at creating mysterious scenes. Now she just needs to fill out her characters, create a better story, and perhaps turn down the proverbial volume on her descriptions - not every meal needs three courses with sculpted caramelized sugar tinged with honey and cinnamon. (Dan Brown sort of proved that with Da Vinci code: clichéd writing, cardboard characters, but lots at stake.) I'll probably give her next novel a chance; but this one was just too much style.
B006O6F932|1.0|We are huge monster high fans in our house and my daughter has wanted this play set since it came out. So, today we went and got it. Within 5  minutes I knew it was a mistake. It is so flimsy that as soon as you start playing in one section everything falls over in another section. I watched my daughter play with it for about 20 minutes. After she had to keep picking everything up that had fallen I asked her did she want to keep it or spend the $80 on something else. We just boxed it up. While it has a ton of cute accessories and the school itself is very cute it is not built to play with. This was something she has wanted for awhile and I let her make the decision to keep or return it. Unfortunately, it is just not practical for kids to play with using the monster high dolls. The desks fall over if a doll is in it, the dolls fall off the bleachers, the DJ stand constantly tips over. I would not recommend anybody buying this set. If it was a gift I am sure we could get some use out of it but my daughter saved for awhile to be able to purchase it and it was just not worth the money.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved this book. loved the drama in it. i cant wait to read the third one to see what happens!

So honestly written, very entertaining and hard to put down. It's a must read for anyone who has ever worked in restaurant, especially the kitchen!
B0008ENHUI|5.0|Wow.  Steve McQueen is one of the best.  This is a great movie.  I loved it. Delivery was great.  Packaging was secure.  Not rolling around like some of the videos  I have received.  Thanks for a great movie.
B004LROUW2|4.0|I am not usually a fan of fantasy. This novel is skillfully  crafted. It makes the unbelievable believable. Because of the author's painstaking character development I began to care deeply for the main characters.  Despite the length of this novel I had a hard time putting it down.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Again Ken Follett has captured our attention in the second book of this trilogy.  My only complaint is that it was rather expensive for a kindle download.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Awesome movie. Great Hd quality that will not disappoint anyone. You can have fun just by pausing the video and checking the details.
030758836X|2.0|I could see the story being made into a pretty good movie, but in book form it was pretty unpleasant to have to slog through. After you get to know the characters well enough, you (well I, at least) can't help but not care what happens to them, as they are continuously frustrating the reader with how unbelievable they are. And when I was reading this book (which I was really trying to get into after reading about how great it was and paying money for it) I just couldn't believe the story at all. I felt like I was reading words typed by the author trying to tell a story that even she wasn't buying into, like she was holding back emotionally and couldn't do much more than give Nick and Amy's poorly written parts any more purpose than to torture the reader and tempt him or her to finally give up before finishing it, to pick up something better, which is what I ended up doing around page 300, and I almost always finish a novel I start, so this was a rare exception. (SPOILER! SPOILER!-----)And as for the twist mid way into the book? It was flat out cheap. The author basically tells the story one way (through Amy's ridiculous diary entries), and then pretty much says, \\"Haha I fooled you! Those diary entries were phony the whole time!\\" -I don't know, but to me that doesn't seem like a very good twist, I felt ripped off from it, actually.<br />This was my first Gillian Flynn novel I read and I probably won't bother reading the other two.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I'll be honest I don't play but my little kids do.  They are 5 and 8 and go to the creativity land and work together to build houses, blow up house and create lots of cool things.  We have two Kindle Fires and so they get to link up together and have a lot of fun but I have to limit their time because they would build and destroy all day if let them.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I have had the best time with this app.  I usually get frustrated with these type.  but this one was fun.
B005LAIHR2|4.0|Heard this did not do to well on the big screen. Wanted to rent it from the video store, but they had no plans of getting it in, I guess. So, I dropped the $20.00 at Walmart for it. Glad I did. With the DVD came a cd music sampler. Bonus for me, since the songs that were on the sampler were all the ones that I did not buy here on Amazon.<br />Back to the movie. I cant believe it did not do better in the box office. I thought it was a great movie. The all star, and not so all star cast, were all put in there right places. Great music throughout. Some humor, little love story, so, good to watch with the girlfriend. Tom Cruise does a great job, as does the newer Juliane Hough. It did not get 5 stars from me, because, well, I know this is a musical #, but it just takes off into that a little much for me. Other than that, it was great. Also, a little bonus on the DVD was some Def Leppard live, but I think they through in some of the crowd noise in there on this. Well worth the $20.00. Also get a digital download with it.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I think this is the best app ever. you should come up with a another idea but in it should be a girl.I love it woo much
B006GWO5NE|5.0|If you only have a computer or even any electronic device that has a USB connection.  I would suggest an outward bound USB port such as one of the newer Cable boxes, DVD, BLU-RAY and even the more advanced Surround sound 5.1 to 7.plus units that have a USB direct connection as most computers do today.  Then purchasing this additional cable is for you.<br /><br />  It would also include those individuals who may have the luxury of such connections within their high-end vehicles, RV's or Yacht's.  Of course you may also purchase the super fast charging unit through Amazon as well.  Of which I too, would recommend that you do for your personal convenience.  After all, I have only found my affordable Kindle's to provide direct current charging systems using a basic plug with an interchanging solution allowing you to use a single unit to charge a multitude of USB powered devices without requiring expensive computer or cable equipment.<br /><br />  This is a first for me when it comes to power solutions thus making me biased but I find that for those of us who survive on Social Security below most individuals expectations.  I find it highly refreshing when large corporations realize there are a lot of us who merely try to keep up with the more fortunate families catered to by our governments sharing of information on programs anyone can access, if only they would tell the general public and not just those who supported their campaigns.<br /><br />  Again, this device only needs to be ordered either as a replacement part or if you have multiple locations in which you may find yourself putting your Kindle reader down.  The device is not at all limited to any one of the Kindle Fire units either.  These cords work across the entire line of Amazon eReaders!
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Very suspenseful,never knowing what will happen on the following episodes,I'm only on the second disk,and stretching them out as long as i can. As a former Vietnam  combat Marine, I find him very convincing.
B007SGM084|5.0|In spite of the many explicit sex scenes, I saw this book to be a twisted love story.Christian was not depicted as a spoiled rich brat, but more so as a man with a very troubled past who became a very wealthy and powerful business man. He really had a good heart and did a lot of good things and made no excuses for being rich. Was glad to see he and Ana work out their differences in order to make things work for them.She was right for him. Was happy for the happy ending. Would like to see a movie made. Interesting read that I found hard to put down.
B009GEAPYW|5.0|Loved it the story was amazing, batman coming out of retirement as an old man in his 50's doing what he does best tells you his spirit never gave up and no matter what age he's always going to be the batman.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I read this only because of the hype. I teach 9th grade English and half my girls were reading the book.  I like to stay \\"up\\" on what is popular in literature at the moment so I can tie in the classics with what they are reading. I just have to say, I'm not a prude, but this is WAY too mature for 14 year old girls to be reading!  I realize that they aren't the intended audience, however, when a book becomes this popular, teenagers are going to jump on the bandwagon. This is such a twisted view on what defines a good relationship, its the very last thing a girl looking for romance should be reading. There were some plot similarities to Twilight, but it lacked the character development and imagery that Twilight contained. Which brings up my second issue.  The writing just flat stunk. I couldn't really even picture the characters because the only good descriptions written were during the sex scenes.  I had been told that the book was essentially \\"mommy porn\\", but with such good reviews, I was hesitant to believe that.  Unfortunately, it's true. So mom's, DO NOT let your impressionable baby girls read this unless you want them to start looking for really bad guys that they think they can save.  (It doesn't actually work that way, by the way). And if you want a well written story, you won't find it here. If I could give it zero stars, I would.....
B006OCM0G0|5.0|ok I haven't tried this game yet but based on how awesome petshop story is!! I have no idea what.....stay away from teamlava was talkin' bout!!
B002BI6SMI|5.0|The video was great, loved every moment of it. I recommend anyone who does not own this movie to buy it to watch over and over again. Best thriller of all time.
B007SGM084|5.0|I decided to buy the trilogy after hearing about the author and the fact that these books will make it to the big screen. And now, I'm already rereading it for the second time. Be careful, if you start reading the whole trilogy, it might not be easy to stop. I read the books in 4 days, which means I didn't sleep much! It's just really hard to put them down.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B000URWYTS|4.0|This novel gives the reader an insight into the life and loves of Frank Lloyd Wright.  It was a beautiful love story, yet for Frank and Mamah, it was difficult for them to reconcile their lives together.  I really liked the way Mamah's sense of self evolved throughout the novel; she struggled with her conflicting feelings about her various roles in life.  All in all, this was a great read; a 21st century reader is reminded that life and unconventional love were not always as easy in earlier times.  I am very interested in Wright's architecture and his thoughts and concepts behind his buildings, so this gave me insight into that also.
B00854BQ9M|5.0|Love, love this book<br />So many themes, so well written, such a great story of survival!!<br />I've bought extra to give out!
B008TMA1LY|3.0|it would be a fun game if it was a little faster. its just to slow for my liking. need a wat to earn hello Kitty points would make it better too.
0316228532|1.0|Wow! I knew going in that my expectations of Rowling were too high so I put that aside and prepared to read. Currently on page 70 and I'm pretty sure I'm throwing in the towel soon. There's no plot.... No one seems to be able to say this is a book about____. So in the midst of a sea of dark random moments, characters I can't stand, and cursing I think I'm done
B008NCSZQ8|1.0|At my house, I don't have the greatest internet connection. That being said, whenever I try to watch the video, it continues to buffer endlessly, never playing the video. I will never by a video from amazon again, until I can download the media to any device I own.
B008XG1X18|4.0|love the app and very easy to use. it has crashed on me once,  but I'm sure it was because of how long I was on the site. no complaints otherwise.
B0082JYAZ2|5.0|I am very happy with this album. Regina delivers her usual masterpieces, with a quirky and fun style. The song that most surprised me was \\"How\\". At first it sounded almost like an 'oldies' type song, but she really made it her own and it turned out quite powerful.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I've been on a reading binge lately, which is kind of a bad thing for me because once I start a book, I find it hard to put it down before I finish it.<br /><br />I've been reading some of the highest-rated science fiction books of the year, and they've mostly disappointed me. Embassytown was long winded, unbelievable and just not that much fun. Reamde started off well and then turned into a very extended B movie for the last 500 pages... I could go on.<br /><br />Ready Player One though, starts fun and stays fun all the way through. It's such an enjoyable read, very believable, and I actually cared about the characters. It's also full of good ideas and totally feels plausible.<br /><br />In fact, it's so good that I couldn't believe it was the author's first book, but it is. I just hope his next book comes out before too long, because I can't wait to read it!
B002SJKWZ4|3.0|The difference between the actions for the remote functions are very subtle.  It is not uncommon to find yourself raising the volume when you really wanted to change channels.
0307887448|4.0|What would happen in a massive online game if it became an immersive experience, synonymous with the internet itself, better than the hopeless reality of life in the future, where people scratch a meager existence from the ruined earth? This novel explores that possibility with a fascinating story, some great characters, and nonstop suspense. The action centers on a series of mysteries, puzzles that demand imagination, and knowledge of pop culture and video games. I was totally captured by this story during the short time that it took me to read it. Ernest Cline has written a real winner with his first novel, and won a lot of die-hard fans, most of whom are hoping that he will write another one soon.<br /><br />Some reviewers complain that the novel's appeal is narrow, since it focuses obsessively on gamers and 1980's pop culture. Most of the action takes place in virtual reality. I am not a gamer, although I would probably be one if I was 25 years younger. Still, I thoroughly enjoyed this, and I recommend it to a wide range of people. Comparisons to Neal Stephenson and William Gibson are inevitable, but Cline is an even better writer, and his character driven novel will appeal to a wide range of readers. There are a lot of references to 1980's trivia here, and even a list or two, but it didn't derail the story, and in many ways it was a necessary part of the story. I enjoyed it, even though I completely missed the 80's, and didn't really like that decade's style or music.<br /><br />I do have some criticisms, but these are not about the quality of the story or the writing, more about the content, which is purely subjective, even more subjective than my other comments. I didn't like the way Wade disses everyone who believes in a higher being or an afterlife, dismissing faith as \\"total bulls**t.\\" I felt that it was the author speaking directly to his readers, announcing his own beliefs with an insult to everyone who disagrees with his point of view. Through most of the novel Wade takes the high road, but not here. Of course, an author is free to take any tone they choose, and to insult anyone they care to insult. That is freedom of speech, and I must cheer for that, especially when I don't like the speech.<br /><br />Another thing that surprised me was the author's lapse into preachiness when two of the characters meet in an old RV. After 320 pages of hard, cynical realism, the author suddenly becomes idealistic.  I agreed with the sentiment, but the way it was done made me wince. Otherwise, this was a high quality production. I recommend it.he novel Wade takes the high road, but not here. Of course, an author is free to take any tone they choose, and to insult anyone they care to insult.

B005OCHOZS|4.0|This was a great read following the famous book \\"born to run\\". the powers of the human body continue to amaze me.  cant wait to try some of the tasty vegan recipies he gratefully provides throughout the book
B006LSZECO|3.0|\\"Girl Gone\\" was well written but I hated it and I hated the ending even more. To be fair after reading the book description and comments, I never would have purchase it. BUT it was gifted to me and I thought the polite thing to do was to read it. The first quarter of the book was full of psychobabble and questionnaires. It was so boring to me that I only read the book when I was at swim practice waiting on my grandchild. The last 75 percent of the book was not boring but just not to my liking.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|good way to pass time.  just like coin games at the kiddies restaurants. wish I did not to wait so long for coin refill
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Big fan of the series. Well-written. Good character development. Also, the show has used several songs sprinkled here and there, songs that I'm not familiar with (save for Bob Dylan at the end of season two). I would love if they'd release a soundtrack, but so far I cannot find any such thing. Anyone know anything about the songs they've utilized so far ? I would love to get a hold of them, even if I have to buy them separately.<br />Thank you.
B004QL7K6G|1.0|This movie was painful to watch. It actually wasn't so horrible until a little bit in. For once someone in a Jennifer Aniston movie was more annoying than her character. Paul Rudd was horrible. In one scene he's talking to himself in the mirror to pump himself up for sex and saying things like, \\"I'm gonna get all up in that vag.\\" And then he repeats this and the like for what feels like forever in some of the dumbest voices I've ever heard. Not funny at all. I'm hard to offend but this was just BAD. It would be insanely uncomfortable to watch this with any older members of my family. God, it was uncomfortable just watching this alone. Would any woman sleep with this man? The fact that two women in this movie wanted to seemed insane and just wishful thinking on the part of whatever idiots wrote this script. I kept praying some wild animal would eat Paul Rudd during this scene just so he would shut up.
030758836X|3.0|Gone Girl was our book club's book of the month for August.  I had read a little bit about it before but I was not sure of what to expect.  A lot of twists and turns, but very good.  Very twisted ending, but they deserve each other.  I would recommend this book.
B002NZV68U|5.0|My 3 kids loved this movie!!! Ages ranging from 5, 8 & 14. I personally liked the classic one better. Majority rules in our household.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Wool 1-5. The characters were believable and very likable- except for the bad guy! I was constantly surprised by what happened next and was so engrossed by the story that I actually held my kindle in one hand and vacuumed with the other. You will not be disappointed with this story and will feel a sense of sadness when you finish because the story is over..... For now!
B001KVZ6HK|3.0|I bought this set for the 3D Blu-Ray version, but I first got an error message saying that my TV (LG 3D LED) or my 3D Blu-Ray player (LG BD670) were not recognized as 3D compatible. After searching online I found that the error was coming from the way my HDMI cables were connected. Having your Blu-Ray player connected to your sound system then redirected to your TV create the problem. You have to connect your player directly to your TV, and if you want to have surround sound, connect your TV audio out to your sound system audio in (using HDMI cable). It fixed the issue for me. I gave it a 3 Star because I think that we should not have to deal with this kind of issue, especially when regular Blu-Ray disks worked fine with my initial Home Theater set-up.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|I absolutly love this show. It's like the sopranos but on motorcycles. The story lines are great. The cast is fantastic. Curt Sutter is an awesome writer. I highly recommend this series.

B008TMA1LY|1.0|I let my little girl play this game, and I turned my head for just a second. Next time I looked, the game was hourglassing and it said \\"purchasing\\". Somehow she got to one of the pop-up screens that seem to pop up QUITE FREQUENTLY, and accidentally purchased some points. I tried to undo it, but it would not let me. I also tried to contact Amazon about it - to no avail. The parental controls were not set yet because I just got a new device and my little girl was so excited she wanted to be the first one to try it. So, all I am trying to say is to beware. They charged me OVER $20 for some POINTS!!!!!!!!!!!! That is so ridiculous and I am highly upset about it!!!!!
B002PEP4SC|5.0|It may be that watching the television show adds to being \\"in the moment\\" with the action of the book and to developing the characters.  So much so, I read two on the beach during the last vacation.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I love this app, its very addicting...but its constantly freezing or not responding then it closes. I hate that because then I lose my spot and can never find where I was at again. So frustrated!
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is my new favorite game.  I have regular Solitaire, but Spider is much more fun.  When I get more comfortable with it, I'm going to add another suit. Graphics are great.  Addictive.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|There is no substance to this move except for some special effects. The characters seem to be brain dead, it feels like a \\"zombies vs alien\\" movie.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Thank you Mobility ware. I am enjoying this game so much.  I have played Solitaire for years, but this is my first time on a kindle fire HD. Easy with stylus or not, I believe it is a hit.
B00005JLR2|5.0|I had never heard of this movie, but saw a trailer when watching another cartoon movie with my grandkids ... read the reviews on Amazon and decided to try it.  Liked it so much bought copies for all my grandkids (3 copies, one for each family).  They loved it!  The graphics and story line were first rate.  Robert Louis was an ancestor of mine ... and I think, from the stories within my family, that he would have enjoyed this rendition of his classic.
B001O7JHSE|5.0|Great movie, hands down! This dvd is a must buy for anyone who is a Edward Norton fan.  Def his best acting for this classic
0307742997|5.0|This is a powerful murder mystery,  set in Oslo. It is another in the series featuring police detective Harry Hole. He is a tough character, he drinks too much, and he is a talented investigator. I have not read any of the other books in this series, so I cannot speak to their quality or the quality of the series as a whole. But this novel is a real winner.<br /><br />It begins with a snowman facing a house. Murder follows. And we discover the modus operandi of the serial killer. There is the snowman-p-and there are other unique characteristics of his sanguinary assault on people. There are a number of threads in this novel--Harry's old girl friend, Rakel; his new police partner, a hardboiled female detective; a tale of a previous investigator who was investigating the snowman--and his demise; the various murders.<br /><br />Nesbo is a craftsman as he pulls these various plotlines together in a taut and suspenseful novel. And the author creates a credible atmosphere, with the winter in Norway an element of the drama.<br /><br />There are hints as to whom the killer might be, and several times one might think that we have identified the murderer. But these are red herrings. As unbelievable as it seems, I actually guessed right on the perpetrator (that's very rare for me in a well crafted mystery).<br /><br />In the end, a fine murder mystery, with intriguing twists and turns and a pretty satisfying ending.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|great game for when your just relaxing watching a film with the girlfriend or trying to ignore :) also fun just to have incase the dentist appointment comes around the corner
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I bought this game for my 8 year old son's birthday based on the reviews and knowing how much he likes to play table top games.  His other favorites are clue, pokemon, and card games like uno.  I originally thought this game would be like risk but more fun for younger kids, but I think it is very different.  It's a game where you gather resources and expand your kingdom until someone reaches enough points, based on the size of your kingdom and some other factors, to be the winner.  So far we have played only three person games with his older sister, 9, and they both ask to play this game every chance we get.  We've owned this game for about a month now and it has excellent replay value because the board and starting positions can change every time.  The only con I have had from the game is that the board pieces are fairly cheap cardboard.  If anything gets them wet they easily get damaged and warped.  This happened from just the condensation of a waterglass on our table.  However, this is the only thing I could suggest to make this game better.  We are looking forward to buying the expansions and having more enjoyable game nights in our future.  A+
B004FRX0MY|1.0|reinstalled way too many times and it still won't open, am extremely disappointed in this app, Amazon needs to fix this issue.

B008JFC6F0|5.0|Basically, my caption sums up what I wanted to say as the other reviews here have covered this new Tame Impala album very nicely. But to expand on that, I first heard Tame Impala's \\"Runway Houses City Clouds\\" (from \\"Innerspeaker\\") on an internet psychedelic station and the airy Beatlesque vocal work in that simply blew me away. I ended up getting that album and was not disappointed with this band's extremely vintage psychedelic vibe via/John Lennon-style vocals so began wondering what they could come up with next. Well, they've answered in spades with Lonerism, an album that lives up to the promise of Innerspeaker and once again brings that Lennon/Beatles influence into the 21st century like no one else I know of. At the moment, the track that really stands out for me (and sounds like a great choice for a single) is \\"Apocalypse Dreams\\", but the same level of terrific melodic songwriting & production is also heard throughout the album - it's like this is one of those albums where you'll find yourself having different favorites over a period of time. So far, I've been listening to this via streaming audio but my purchase of the physical CD is forthcoming, just like with Innerspeaker. In closing, I think what impresses me most about Tame Impala is this: I'm not much of a fan/listener of any current music trends or present day artists but this band and their two albums is one glowing exception to that.

1402790546|5.0|Wow...what a book!  I could hardly put this one down.  Probably the best book out there concerning the WWII bomber pilot.  You meet interesting, real people involved in their own private dramas on both sides of the English Channel against a backdrop of total war.  The flight scenes, both the Allied bomber and the German fighter point of view, are unbelievably exciting.  The devastation of the actual bombing raids is felt all too strongly as it impacts German civilians that we have gotten to know and, in some cases, sympathize with.<br /><br />If you are a WWII aficionado--even if you're not--don't miss this great read!

068484267X|4.0|Frank McCourt writes his memoir much like a run-on diary.  I didn't mind this, but I did question some of what he wrote.  This book encompasses his life from age three to age nineteen.  Most of the book focuses on his earliest years in this time span...from three to nine or ten.  I found it difficult to believe the minute details described by Frank from the very beginning were actual memories.  I certainly don't remember what I was doing every day of my three, four and five year old existence.  He describes returning to Ireland when he was three and his Dad carrying the twins who were crying from hunger, his Mam stopping every few minutes to sit and rest on a stone wall, watching the sky and listening to the birds.  Page after page, he describes precise conversations on non-consequential things, describes when and what they ate (or more precisely what they didn't eat).  It seemed the entire family lived most of their lives drinking tea and eating fried bread.  Three of the children died, and when reading the book, you will wonder how it is that any of them survived.  They lived on the public dole through the majority of Frank's years in Ireland.  The story is fascinating, but the author has been accused, by his Irish neighbors, of exaggerating the poverty and other events his family endured in the book.  When reading his bio, his own mother, Angela, discounted some of the story.  Whether she didn't want to admit to these things out of shame or was being truthful is something you will have to judge for yourself.
1423140605|4.0|Like so many, I was anxiously awaiting this book since the end of Son of Neptune.  It was definitely a great read and I was not disappointed!<br /><br />The only downfall to this book is that, with so many characters all crowding the limelight at once, some unfortunately fall to the wayside.  Piper was one such character.  Every time things went to her perspective for a moment, I had to strain to remember exactly who she was and what she was doing there.  Frank was another; he's shown plenty, but so one-dimensional.  He's either being embarrassed about his gifts, or else expressing prepubescent signs of blatant jealousy.  Hazel fell to the wayside, too, which is a shame because I love her character.  In this book, I wanted to connect with her again, but couldn't.<br /><br />On the flipside, some characters got lots of attention.  You get to see more of Annabeth than you've really gotten to experience in the previous books, and while I had always been sort of indifferent to her before, I really like her character more this time around.  Leo is the one who really got to shine.  I liked him before; I absolutely love him now.  He got to be more than just the goofy kid with a painful past; you got to experience some real emotional struggles with him, and see him show his strength in a whole different way than most of the demigods (without giving anything away, there is a brief few lines about how Leo keeps manning the Argo II almost robotically without having slept, determined to keep going - a whole different kind of strength than Jason and Percy's fighting power.)  He's still a wise-cracking hyperactive mechahead, but he showed a more mature side in this book without losing the personality that made him likable in the first place.<br /><br />There was a LOT of attention on the pairings in this book which was a little off-putting at first, but I am also an adult reader and remember these sorts of things being forefront on my mind as a kid, so while it bothered me a little, I understand the placement.  It also becomes more relevent in the story later on, so if you're bothered by this in the beginning, read on!<br /><br />As always, I really enjoyed Riordan's modern interpritations of Greek and Roman gods and heroes.  Can't wait till next fall for the next installment!

B008MG1E4A|5.0|The author takes the reader right alongside the warrior. The training background gave enough information without stepping over the line. I laughed at some of their hi-jinks and humor. I cried at their frustration when the rules of engagement were changed. These men have earned our respect, our gratitude for their sacrifice and courage. Their families, too, deserve our respect and gratitude for their sacrifice. The author achieved his goal of explaining these very special men and that one mission they knew they could not fail.

I was interested in the topic because it will remain one of the most important moments in our military history. The amazingly detailed description of this event makes you feel as if you were there alongside the author when the top secret mission unfolded. Not only do I thank the author for his service to our country, but also for writing this amazing first hand account of his journey as a SEAL. I am recommending this book to all of my friends.

B006S053K8|5.0|Given all the 'noise' around Kristen Stewart in the past few months this movie is fascinating to watch in ways that no one could have imagined when it was made.  A young girl having an affair with a married man and with a crucial moment being the fact that she is seen in a car with that man?  Fact now collides with fiction.  This is a must see.

God Bless you Mark Owen for telling your story-----the truth. You and your team are heroes.  God Bless America.

B005DF2QMC|3.0|The product arrived and everything promised was there. Downloading the software was easy and quick but that was the last thing that went with any speed.  The transferring was at regular speed and as I had around 50 cassettes to transfer it was a slow process. You can't listen to the music as it was transferred so it was hard, at least for me to tell when it was finished. I would rate myself just above beginner for technology and I found it quite challenging. The final input into Itunes was really difficult, again, for me.  I'm sure the product is fine but I would recommend it for someone that feels really comfortable with this technology.

B000IEXVCC|5.0|I didn't find this movie as hard to follow as some other reviewers have indicated.  The movie did require me to be flexible in my assumptions regarding what is happening on the screen (but possibly only as a character's perception or dream), and what is \\"real.\\"  Once I did this I found the narrative threads compelling and even spellbinding.  The movie is extremely poetic and haunting visually and with regard to its dialogue.  There is a sense of brooding menace throughout which Lynch accomplishes with almost none of the usual tricks (thematic music etc.).  This is a powerful and deeply metaphoric film.

B007TK77QE|5.0|Every review of this book seems to start with 'This is not Harry Potter..' and that's correct, it's not. And as long as you're not expecting Harry Potter you'll be fine. Otherwise you might want to go read, well, Harry Potter.<br />This is a wonderful account of current day Britain and current British class struggles. If you live in, or have ever lived in Britain you'll most likely have met all of these characters before.<br />The book is thought provoking and well written, the characters are all very interesting and all very flawed, the setting is mundane and the story is common but Rowling's writing is flawless. This is a great book in its own right and i hope people give it a chance.

Also nice to read something that I can comfortably recommend to teens. No gratuitous sex, but it still appeals to adults.  Looking forward to future installments!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Book three of Fifty Shades is more of the same thing in the 1st two books.  The interesting part is to see how the characters' relationship develops.  But the intimate scenes do get old after a while and I find myself skipping through those parts after a while.  And when you skip over those parts, the book becomes very short.  So I would say there is very little substance in the book, but if you want to read it for the erotic parts, then this is for you.
B004ZISVWC|2.0|Boring movie, think blair witch project, but about a troll.  Nothing original, not interesting.  The plot, what plot?  It seems more of a weekend camera projet than a movie.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Anita's detailed account of her near-death-experience is truly inspiring.  She tells her story - from her upbringing, through her illness, to her NDE, and how it changed her life - with such a genuine touch that it's difficult to put this book down.  What she experienced during her NDE is, amazingly, not so unique; but she explains the formless with admittedly inadequate words so well that the reader gets a good sense of the true nature of reality, and our place in it.  I felt very connected to her writing, which makes sense, since it arose from the universal 'self' that we all share.
0765316994|1.0|Redshirts is a story about other stories. It's a humorous framing of the question asked by every TV drama viewer (in this case, every Trekkie) at some point in his life when a character does something insanely foolish and gets killed for it: \\"Why would they *do* that?\\" Andy Dahl is a young ensign assigned to the flagship exploratory craft of the interstellar galactic alliance (or whatever it's called). His initial excitement turns to paranoia when he discovers that, with the exception of a few executive bridge officers, no-one who goes on an away mission survives for long: other young ensigns are regularly exploded by terrorists, eaten by horrible monsters, chopped  to bits by alien warriors, or turned into goo by some interstellar pandemic. He's been tapped to go on away missions, and he and his friends are quickly possessed with finding a way to escape what seems to be certain doom and to understand how it has been happening for all these years.<br /><br />Great premise, isn't it? I thought so. I thought enough of the premise (and the awards that Scalzi had won) to buy the book - in fact, to pre-order it. More fool me. This book disappointed on every level. The plot is deeply unsatisfying. That whole great setup? Want to know what's really going on? Here it is (SPOILER!):<br /><br />... the lives of the main characters are being controlled by the writers of a Star Trek knock-off TV series that was popular a thousand years before the characters lived. In order to prevent their horrible deaths, the characters travel back in time and negotiate with the writers and producers.<br /><br />I guess it could have been funnier in its execution (a la Stranger than Fiction), but it wasn't. I smirked a time or two while reading the book, but that's it. And it definitely wasn't funny enough (in fact, I don't think it could possibly have been funny enough) to offset the constant cursing and filthy talk that continues to build throughout the book. It's hardly what I expected from a Star Trek send-up, working as it does off of family entertainment. Not funny. Not interesting. Not recommended for anyone.a Star Trek send-up, working as it does off of family entertainment. Not funny. Not interesting. Not recommended for anyone.

0765357151|5.0|Let me start by saying that this has virtually none of the elements that are associated with popular horror: gore or gross-outs, demons, boo! moments, or anything else like that. This is a first-rate psychological drama with a science fiction setup. Don't be scared off if (like me) you have no interest in zombies or vampires.<br /><br />This is the story of Robert Neville, the last human being on Earth. This short novel, told in three vignette-like segments, follows the psychological (and occasionally physical) struggles of a man utterly alone in a world of blood-crazed killers. Though there are some vague references to bombings and germ warfare, the story begins in media res with Neville fortified in his house. Thanks to his foresight, cleverness, and immunity, his basic needs are taken care of. Each day he ventures out to destroy as many of the slumbering vampires as he can find. Each night he sits alone in his home as the monsters assault it to no avail. Neville's real enemies, it quickly becomes clear, aren't the vampires: they are alcohol and loneliness. The fantastical themes in the book serve as an excellent backdrop for the story within of a man standing on the edge of sanity. The remarkable paradigm shift that takes place at the end of the book is worth the price of admission.<br /><br />I first became familiar with this story after seeing about half of the movie adaption starring Will Smith (a travesty akin to Smith's adulteration of I, Robot ... one wonders whether he might adapt Jane Eyre to be the story of Rochester, the hard-bitten ex-cop who falls in love with Jane, a stunningly beautiful cyborg assassin who helps him kill his undead wife). Although the book was spoiled for me when I happened to read a list of great sci-fi endings, I still found it a very enjoyable read. Matheson's skillful development of Neville as a character as he faces the terrible mental pressure of loneliness makes the book worthwhile, even though I was denied the pleasure of the `twist' ending.  When I went to get a page count off of Amazon, I was surprised to discover that this book was written in 1954. It has a very modern feel to it for a sixty-year old novel (though the word `Mohommedan' did strike me as a bit odd).e `twist' ending.

0756405890|4.0|The Name of the Wind is a story within a story; it is the story of Kvothe telling his own story of how an apparently humble innkeeper went from a happy child raised in a family of actors to a wild young street-thief to one of the most ambitious, talented, and reckless young arcanists ever to attend (or be expelled from) the University. How his pursuit of the unreachable woman he loved came to tragedy and how he came to fall in with faerie-folk are kept for other volumes.<br /><br />After I had purchased this book, I opened it up and saw with a groan that it was subtitled The Kingslayer Chronicle: Day One. If I had known it was part of a series, I wouldn't have bought it. My initial disappointment faded, however, when I started to read. This is an excellent little novel - unremarkable in its fantasy elements (except for the really creative and interesting system of magic) and philosophical scope, but well-written, easy to read, and liberally interwoven with some of the poetry and elevated tone that make Tolkien so powerful. A much more conservative approach to objectionable elements is refreshing (given my disappointment with George R.R. Martin). It's still not suitable for everyone, but it's tamer than most TV programs.

0060557818|4.0|I picked this up out of curiosity to see what Gaiman is all about. This is the story of Richard Mayhew, a hapless London businessman with a Type-A+ girlfriend. One day they happen across what appears to be an injured homeless girl. Over his girlfriend's protestations, Richard stops to help the girl. This act of kindness sends him hurtling into a world beneath the city (London Below) populated by all manner of fascinating, disturbing, and murderous people, and into a desperate attempt to escape killers whom no doors can keep out.<br /><br />This is what Charles Dickens would have written if fantasy had been popular in his day. The book has a very strong mythic feel to it, being populated not so much by characters as by archetypes - an incredible variety of archetypes, including cultists (the Rat-Speakers), rogues (the Marquis de Cabaras), murderers (the horrible and hilarious Croup and Vandemar), warriors (the woman Hunter), outcasts (Old Bailey), demons (the angel Islington), and more. There is scarcely a role in the story that doesn't seem familiar - familiar because it has leapt from the ancient pages of human stories. The only character that feels flat is Richard, not so much because he's not mythic and cool, but because he's a bit of a whiner. He gets his act together about halfway through the book and starts acting like a man, but it takes rather too long. After I had read the book, I discovered, much to my surprise, that it's actually a novelization of a BBC TV series. This might be the only screen adaptation to ever make it onto a list of best anything, anywhere. Overall, despite the lack of big ideas or compelling subtext, this is a thoroughly original and enjoyable RPG adventure writ large and writ well.
0545123275|4.0|Love the author's writing style! Very eloquent and polished! It was a good, entertaining read with a powerful introduction and a decent pace. Overall, I felt the author's writing deserved 5 stars, but gave this book 4 mainly because I felt there were way too many similarities to Twilight. Still, it was a good book.
0671646788|5.0|I wish I had read this book earlier, when I first started working. I would've been a MUCH better employee over the years. I've read a lot of reviews here that say that they already knew everything that was in this book. Well I'D never heard the stuff that is presented in this book.<br /><br />I've always been a mediocre employee who just \\"did what I was supposed to do\\" at work, because I always looked for jobs in careers that I hated, because I thought that that is what people are supposed to do. I never did well at these jobs, and I couldn't understand why - after all, wasn't I doing what I was \\"supposed to be\\" doing? The first several chapters outline why you will never advance at work if you just do \\"what you're supposed to do\\".<br /><br />So then I felt really really guilty reading this book because it made me feel like I didn't do well at work because I was \\"mediocre\\". But then I reached the chapter on desires and goals, and I discovered that the REAL reason I never did well at work was because I didn't have the desire to do so! I suppose people who are well-read on positive thinking and all that probably think that it is obvious that in order to do well at something, you must have desire. But for me, that was totally new. I had always believed, in fact, that it is \\"wrong\\" to have desires, and that it is wrong to pursue what you desire. No wonder I always failed! I was always doing what I DIDN'T want to do because I thought it was wrong to do what I wanted to do!<br /><br />Now from reading this book I can understand that I had it all wrong, and that it is NOT wrong to do what you want to do but rather, completely the opposite. That it is actually RIGHT to do what you want to do, and therefore I needn't feel guilty anymore when I do what I want to do (like pursue the career that I want, for example). Very, very liberating.<br /><br />I had also read Napoleon Hill's book, but I got bored with it right away and couldn't read past chapter 2, because I was so bored. I guess it's just a matter of personal style, I suppose Napoleon Hill just doesn't have a style that appeals to me, I'm sure the INFORMATION in his book is perfectly sound.<br /><br />The one thing that perhaps I would've liked to see Dr. Schwartz talk about a great deal more, but he didn't, would've been to see him address people who have the major problem that I had: most of the people with wrong thinking in his examples reacted to adversity by blaming other people or outside situations and circumstances. I tend to react to adversity by really hitting myself on the head and beating myself up a lot, spewing a lot of venom towards myself and having rage attacks against myself. I wish Dr. Schwartz would have expounded more on how that also does not work in trying to make you a better person.<br /><br />I always thought that, you know, when you are a child, you do what the mean teacher tells you to, right? Because you don't want them to scream at you again. So I thought that if I screamed at myself the way the mean teachers do, that I would get myself to do what I wanted myself to do. I wish Dr. Schwartz would have explained more clearly that that approach DOES NOT work in the long-run, because when you hate yourself so much, you won't succeed at anything. He actually only touches on this problem, however, in one chapter, I think, where he explains how a successful man advises people not to berate themselves or get mad at themselves if they fail, because he (the successful man) had never done so, and he would not have become successful if he had spent all his time berating himself and getting mad at himself.<br /><br />I also wish he would have emphasized more about constructive ways to react when other people criticize, reject or disapprove of YOU, rather than only how to avoid criticizing and rejecting OTHER PEOPLE. He only uses examples of people who gave up when they were criticized or rejected as examples of people who didn't succeed, but he doesn't explain howto GET OVER negative criticisms or remarks that hurt you, except to say that you can take comfort in knowing that those people who acted that way towards you will \\"not succeed\\" in life and will remain mediocre all their lives.<br /><br />Other than that I think this is a really really good book. Someone else also mentioned that they thought the author wrote like a \\"14-year-old\\". Personally, I didn't notice that, but if that is the case, it only helps me to understand better what the author was trying to say. He has a Ph.D., but if he had tried to write the book like a doctoral thesis, I'm sure a lot less people (including me) would have been able to understand it.<br /><br />Anyways, as I said before, most of the information in this book is actually new to me. This isn't because I'm unaware of other books in the genre, it's rather because I've tried reading other books in the genre (like Napoleon Hill, or the book on the 7 Effective Habits) but I got bored with them, because of the personal styles of the authors. So I think not only is it important for the information in the book to be sound and helpful (and the information in THIS book is some of the best advice I've ever read anywhere), but it should also be presented in a way that is interesting, appealing and understandable. I know that that depends entirely on your personal tastes and preferences, but for me, personally, this is the book whose style I found attracted me and drew me in the most.<br /><br />I also like that it is actually very very practical and ordered in easy-to-follow steps, something which someone as hopelessly scatter-brained and disorganized as me really needs! In each chapter he gives a series of action steps which you can take to incorporate new ways of thinking and new behaviours into your everyday life.

B005WUHAX8|3.0|When I first got this case, I really loved it. I could bring my phone in the shower without worrying, and I also didn't have to think about walking outside with my phone in the rain. However, after 3 months of having the case, a bit of plastic on the charging port opening broke off. This basically rendered the case useless, because it was no longer waterproof. Now the charging door won't stay shut because the whole piece of plastic came off. This would have been under warranty because I bought the case from life proof, but they didn't make it clear that the warranty was only a year if you took a survey. So I was out of luck. I didn't have the money to buy a new case, so now I'm still using it about a year later. Everything else has held up, but a few things are a bit annoying. First, I have absolutely no idea how to take the case off. It is definitely not easy to remove. Second, between the phone and the screen there are bubbles that look a bit like an oil slick. These have been there since the beginning so I'm used to them, but people comment all the time asking what happened to my screen. Third, it is very inconvenient to have to carry around a headphone adapter. I seem to always lose it or not have it with me when I want to use headphones. But, despite all of the things I don't like... my phone is still safe. So there is something to be said. I really want to be able to justify buying another one of these cases now because I really am in desperate need of a new one, and I loved the case for the first three months that it worked. However I just can't justify it, and I need to find a different case. I don't really recommend this case to anyone until the charging port door is made a bit more durable, and until the headphone situation is worked out.

0670022705|1.0|A monumentally boring book which reads like an ad for the British Museum. The text around the objects is<br />dry, mundane and factual, with a bit of equally mundane speculation where the facts cannot be<br />established. The thematic endeavors are feeble and laboured. There is a  lack of<br />appreciation of the symbolic dimension of the objects and absolutely no sense of the<br />poetry of the objects(as claimed by the blurb on the back cover) - but then I assume by the<br />Surname that the author is Scottish and their idea of poetry is \\"Rabbie Burns\\". I can say this<br />this with impunity because I' m Australian and our idea of poetry is \\"Banjo Patterson\\". Sad.

098555780X|5.0|It's a great book l'be learned things I didn't know and it's very easy to learn how to ty different knots. I recommend this for anybody at any level to get this book you'll be surprised at what you may have not known.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|app works great, eye pleasing graphics. Game is simple to use and just as addictive as the real thing. Free app at time of purchase, still worth buying.
B008QE9XD2|3.0|This is an amusing romp, at least from time to time, and you cannot beat the 70s vibe with the music and costumes and the amazing production design.  The story lacks, though, despite the actors' best efforts.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Very touching and moving. Marcus Luttrell puts you in the time and place of the operation. He illustrates the sacrifices he and his team made so that we can still be free in the United States.<br /><br />This book is an excellent read, and I recommend it to everyone.<br /><br />I am a Marine, and give praise for their dedication and willingness to go above and beyond.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|The book had so much killing. it was terrible. i wouldnt read this book if i had to... it was good... but it wasnt the best book

B008XG1X18|3.0|I love this app! it does take a little time to open sometimes on my kindle fire, but i spend so much time on it! so great!

B007TBZ63Y|2.0|I have many books on my kindle, but this is the only one that crashes, and the words are also gray for some reason. This makes me very upset because I like the series and I was only able to read it by buying a hard copy of the book. I tried everything from uninstalling it to refunding it then buying it again, I hope they fix the error.
B007SGM084|5.0|I read all three books in exactly 2 weeks.  VERY well written.  I can't wait to read the story again.  Christian Grey definitely reminds me of Edward Cullen from the Twilight series.  The mystery and charm of his character left me feeling envious of his lover(s).  What a fantasy to have such a romantic, extravagant life!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app becuese whenever my kindle fire is going dead I can check how much energy I have left. Im so happy that I got this app becuese me &amp; my sister loves this app.Thank you for this app app store.

0525953728|5.0|For those of you who might shy away from this book thinking it's only for the types who are into military literature, read the book. The storytelling is captivating and the author gives you enough detail to where you feel like you're actually at the side of these men while they conduct their missions.<br /><br />I loved Owen's realistic accounts of what actually goes down on the battlefield. He admits there are times they screwed up, times when things don't go as planned and times when they're lucky to get out alive. I liked that he didn't act like the SEAL's were infallible commando types but a group of guys who must use every bit of their wit, strength and training under unbearable pressure.<br /><br />My favorite part was the fact that all the SEAL's signed fake names on the flag they gave to Obama. I know it was for security purposes, but I also loved the subtle eff you it gave because of all the leaks coming out of Washington.

0385344333|2.0|Lee Child's Reacher novels have been some of the most enjoyable and sometimes innovative works in thriller genre fiction. I've bought 'em all as they've been published. The appeal is strong for a step out-of-one's-skull fantasy. I mean, here's a protagonist who never does laundry (he just throws away his clothes and gets new stuff), his only possession is a folding toothbrush, and he can beat up any kid on the block. The books, up until this one, have been great escapist fun. Alas, I'm not sure whether Child is running out of ideas, was pressed for a deadline, or just had more important things to do than write this book. The first half of the novel is comprised of a ride in a car, and the conclusion is a jumble of improbable unsatisfying mishmash. If you're a Reacher fan, give this one a pass. Everyone goes through a slump every now and then-- life is cyclic. Let's hope Mr. Child can get back in touch with his character. But after getting burned on this book, when the inevitable next Reacher comes out I won't be snagging a copy sight unseen. I'll be reading the reviews prior to investing.

B008RYN44U|4.0|I wasn't expecting much from No Doubt's return when I heard \\"Settle Down and Push & Shove\\" but after listening to 30 sec clips of the album I was hooked and couldn't wait for its release. It's clearly not your typical No Doubt record but a good one for sure, seems the band has gone a bit more POP than Rock yet the sound seems to work. Tragic Kingdom fans BEWARE, this is no where near the sound that made them superstars. New listeners will instantly clinch on and sing along. Highlight tracks are One More Summer, Easy, Gravity, Undone, and Dreaming The Same Dream.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I don't usually write reviews for books because I find the experience of reading a book to be so personal and so subjective it's hard to translate that into what I think someone else's experience of the book might be.<br /><br />But this book has made a quick, yet deep and lasting, impression on me.<br /><br />Rowling is skillful at quickly creating a vivid world with deeply felt individual characters about whom we care instantly. The story is filled with a wide cast of characters, each of whom is given time in the third person narrative to become truly fleshed out human beings with both admirable traits and understandable flaws. No character is let off the hook from being scrutinized and yet each differing opinion offered, each inner life exposed, make the characters each likable in his or her own way and their motives understood by the reader.<br /><br />She weaves this cast through a simple story line: a small town recovering from and responding to the death of a local man and to the vacancy he leaves on the local town council. Yet the story is far from simple as each character's rich inner life creates it's own sub-plot that spider-webs it's way out from the primary story. What we see in each sub-plot makes us wish individual dreams will come true and makes the reader dream of a better life for these fragile humans.<br /><br />Rowling ties each of these characters together through the events of the story and while not every turn in the story is a surprise she has the courage to take the story to an ultimate climax that is not entirely expected. It left me weeping with real tears for the characters I had grown, so quickly, to believe I knew as people.<br /><br />More over, Rowling's deft use of wildly differing characters, and the ways in which they all come in contact with one another, left me pondering the way in which our very social fabric is interwoven and questioning whether or not we can ever do enough for one another.<br /><br />Forget about Harry Potter,as good as it is, this is not a fantasy story or a story for children. But all of the masterful storytelling Rowling displayed in the Harry Potter series is alive and well in The Casual Vacancy.
B001CTDH76|5.0|I have been a big fan of the Mentalist.  Season 1 was hard to find and this allowed me to catch up with how the show unfolds. I have viewed all of the episodes and thoroughly enjoyed it.
B008V0OLOW|5.0|Diana Krall has picked some great songs dating back to the 1920s that you don't hear often and her renditions are so enjoyable.  I played the CD three times and I'm still not tired of it. This is maybe a little different from her usual vocal with piano but I think it is one of the best things she has done.  Some of the songs are uptempo and others are a little on the melancholy side but done with such class.  Hooray for Diana!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Easy to use; easy to set up; wide selection of Bible versions. I am using this software for a Bible study based on the ESV; not a version I have in my study library. Your selections are made from drop down menus. Pick your book, then the chapter and then the verse. Very simple. Arrows will take you backwards or forwards. Scroll down to read additional verses.
B008PE9GSA|4.0|Almost back to Rio Grande Mud, definitely Fandango and Tres Hombres.  Great blues style, superb combo vibe -- the boys bring it home!
B004UJAOLM|4.0|I had to read this in high school (16 years ago), and I remember it being a much easier read at the time than it is now (for me).  Although I love Bronte's extreme detail of setting the scene or describing the garb that her characters wear -- the old English writing is definitely something that took me a bit of getting used to.  I re-read several parts til I absorbed what what being said or who was saying it.<br /><br />The story of Heathcliff and Catherine is definitely an amazing one, and was the reason I chose to do this re-read.  With so many references in 'Fifty Shades of Grey', and that character's love for old English writing I chose to re-read this classic & keep it on my main page of my Amazon Kindle for easy access to read it, refer to it & mull over.<br /><br />It is a classic re-read, but if you are not used to the old English you may want to use the dictionary on the Kindle and look up some of the 'lingo' that the Brontes were so famous for using.<br /><br />All in all, it is a great book with deep rooted characters, unrequited love, anger, and jealousy -- and much more that I do not want to give away.  For that, you need to acquire this classic for yourself!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had to read this book for summer reading. I was expecting the worst but after reading the first book I went on to complete the series and fell in love with it.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|This book is one of the many I've read written by Ken Follett.  As usual, Ken has met my expectation.  The characters meshed very well with historical events with which I'm familiar.  There are a lot of characters to remember and I found myself looking back several pages to refresh my memory. I read this book on my Kindle and it's great except that if I had the hardbound book I could refresh my memory of who's who by going to the front of the book where the main characters were listed.  I'm looking forward to book three.

B008220AVW|4.0|My nine year old daughter really wanted to watch this movie.  I was concerned, but got the movie anyway as a celebration for a job well done.  We watched it together.  It was entertaining; I enjoyed the coverage of the live performances from her California Dreams tour.  It shows how hard Katy Perry worked to become a star and how hard she must continue to work to realize her dream.  She is family oriented.  The relationship between her and Russell Brand wasn't showcased but had a steady thread throughout the video.  Both my daughter and I enjoyed the film.  I do not regret the purchase.  It became another opportunity for communication and enforcing values.
1451690215|5.0|Dawkins hit another home run. Make sure your read this book, then make sure your children read it. Buy a copy for your friends this holiday season.
B005ZO6NRA|3.0|I don't agree with all the spite and single star reviews directed towards this movie. Honestly it was an okay effort. The plot, dialogue, and villain could have been worlds better.I thought the actor cast as Conan was terrific but could have been aid with a few more lines, and less campy one liners. The action was top notch the kind of gore and brutality you expect from this type of film. I didn't feel Morgan Freeman's southern drawl fit as a proper narration for the movie and the main females character was completely underdeveloped and unmemorable.<br /><br />I believe if they learn from their mistake the second film will be just right.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A good, first account of what the Navy SEALS train for and are expected to do for our country!  The bravery and honor they exhibit, truly makes<br />them American heroes!

B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I see that many of us here have experienced our Kindle cord coming apart.  I haven't had my Kindle that long either.  Clearly the original cord wasn't well made.<br /><br />Amazon, true to it's great customer service reputation, has provided me with this new, improved cord.  It's improved because it feels much sturdier than the old cord did.  It is stiffer, and covered with a more indestructible outer coating.  It works.  I expect this new cord will outlast the old one by many years.<br /><br />I had purchased this as a replacement cord, but then called Amazon and they agreed to refund my purchase price.  Amazon has earned my loyalty with such fantastic service.
B007SGM084|4.0|I read these books on vacation.  There was no way I could read these books at work!  Too hot!  It took me five days to read all three books.  The dishes didn't get done, the cleaning or laundry didn't get done and I resented any phone calls while I was reading.  My eyes were buggy but I could not put the books down.  Not my usual taste in books but there was something about them that drew me. It was like the movie 9 and a half weeks with much more loving characters.  These books simply take you away from reality and any problems in your life.  I will definitely read them again.
B008LZHA3G|4.0|I have listened to and loved Dylan since the late 60's and have tried to collect every album and CD he's produced.  I love this music.  I love the lyrics. But just as when I saw Dylan in concert two years ago, it's just simply time for him to turn the lyrics over to someone else.  His voice is tired and graveled and while I still think he's the best poet of the 20th century, it's just time to let someone else give his work a voice.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Though I took a bit to get into the first book of the trilogy, I was hooked enough to eventually read book two and then HAD TO move on to book three. Book three is my favorite of the trilogy because of the development of the key characters. It was also just a lot of fun reading about the over-the-top experiences and places visited. A page-turning winner of a book!
B007FEFLTO|3.0|In continuing the story that began with Fall of Giants, Follett seems to have less interest in the characters of the second generation of the five families he began with. The times ( the depression, World War II and its aftermath) are turbulent, but his people are hastily sketched out and the implausible coincidences are much too easily constructed. His plotting is nowhere near the addictive story line of the first book in the series. If anything, he seems to be more intent on building a bridge to the reported next chapter in the saga. There are certainly enough offspring to populate the next novel, which is supposed to take us to the end of the 20th century. I hope he will then take more time in his character development and also give his readers more credit for their ability to handle more intricacies in the prose.

We are now giving the books to our grandchildren and making sure we have all the movies as well so they can watch them with us when they visit.

B005S9ELM6|5.0|It was only a few weeks ago that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated the threat of a Nuclear Iran with his undistinguished cardboard bomb chart. At this delicate time, it would seem a film about the 1979 Hostage Crisis could add fuel to the fire of an aggressive position on Iran. At least, it would seem that Argo would be a film to anger or frustrate one side of the political spectrum. Yet, it miraculously doesn't. And for that, it cements Ben Affleck's reputation as a top director.<br /><br />Argo tries to understand the 1979 Hostage Crisis in which 52 Americans were taken hostage for over a year. The film centers on the six people who secretly fled to the Canadian Embassy. The film focuses on the attempts of the American government to bring back these six through a myriad of unusual and strange tactics. Their best \\"bad idea\\" is to set a fake film production, Argo, in Iran, and guise these individuals as part of the crew. Supplied with fake credentials, the hope is to get these people on a plane back home.<br /><br />Argo is simply bizarre for the standards of Hollywood political thrillers. The film starts by establishing the reasons for Anti-American sentiment in Iran and reinforces these sentiments throughout the film. It also shows the anger of Americans without resulting to exaggeration. The most impressive thing about the film is Affleck's eye for detail. Either he researched a lot about Iran or had good researches on his side, as his film showcases a very realistic revolutionary Iran. Filmed in Mclean, Virginia, Washington D.C. and Istanbul, one still get the sense of being in Tehran in those historic days. However, a criticism can be made that Argo shows a more conservative Iran that would have been seen in 1979. The conservative, Islamic image may be appropriate for early 80's Iran, but may be a little too drastic for the eve of the revolution.<br /><br />Affleck has made two movies: one amidst a revolution and the other in Hollywood. The fake film, Argo, eats away a portion of the time duration but not enough to be intrusive to the flow of the movie. Affleck makes some insider Hollywood jokes, but quickly phases back in to the hostage crisis. He avoids the damning curse of actually filming anything with his fake crew when his character arrives in Iran. He smoothly transitions between the frustrations of Iranians, the fear of the hostages, the artificial Hollywood atmosphere, and the unpredictable mood in Tehran.<br />Argo is better than the vast majority of this or the past decade's political movies. It avoids the obtrusive political jargon and leftist positions of films like Syriana. Even though George Clooney is one of the producers, the film succeeds by not becoming another Clooney-like political thriller. That is, a movie so simple in its philosophy yet so complex in its execution. Simply but, Argo is a magnificent achievement for Affleck. Though Gone Baby Gone showed his potential, Argo establishes him as a true auteur. At the end of the film, we don't really hate the Iranians or root for the hostages because their Americans. We want them to escape because their innocent bystanders caught in a political game.

B0031YJFCQ|3.0|Larsson's final book in the Millennium Trilogy came as a disappointment in the series starring Lisbeth Salander, the petite, kickass heroine who's misunderstood by nearly everyone in mainstream Swedish society except Michael Blomkvist. While the first two novels were just the right mix of history, action, and backstory, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest seems to lack a good deal of editing. Difficult to read through pages of Swedish government history and backstory. I keep going back to it, hoping the pace will pick up, only to be disappointed. Recommended only for those who absolutely love Swedish government and history, and those who MUST find out how Lisbeth retaliates with ultimate revenge.
0375869026|4.0|A lot of times, the cover alone is what draws me to a book.  That was the case for this book.  I purchased it at our school Scholastic book sale because the cover and synopsis intrigued me.  I have boys that are 11 and 12 and I work at our middle school/high school, so I am familiar with how cruel kids can be.  I wanted to see how the author tackled this delicate subject and how realistic she portrayed the classmates.  This is Palacio's first novel and I will be watching for future ones from her.<br /><br />This story broke my heart and as a mom, I tried to imagine myself in the mom's position.  Would I have been brave enough to send him \\"like a lamb to slaughter\\" as his dad said, or decide it was time he was in the \\"real world\\"?  For many years, Auggie was protected by his family on outings and his face was only shown when necessary.  He wore an astronaut helmet, a hat, or kept his hair long to hide himself from the public.  When others saw him, their expressions ranged from shock to horror.  The doctor himself fainted when Auggie was born.  This type of facial deformation is beyond my imagination and reading stories like this make me appreciate that we were blessed with healthy children.  Auggie is a bright and witty child quick with a one-liner and once he had the chance to be himself, others fell in love with him.  But, do we give kids like Auggie that chance?  One of my favorite lines from Auggie in the book is when he is meeting some students from his new school and one of the asks why he hasn't gotten plastic surgery.  Auggie replied, \\"This is after surgery!\\".  This was the perfect way to lighten the mood and show Auggie's true personality.<br /><br />The book is told through short chapters and in parts told from each character's perspective.  The story flows quickly and gives you everyone's perspective which I appreciated.  I think my favorite section was from Auggie's teenage sister, Via (short for Olivia).  Via has always been Auggie's biggest fan, but as she begins high school she wants to be known as Olivia, not as Auggie's sister.  I appreciated how honest the author showed Olivia's fears and desires to have a life separate from Auggie, as well as the changes that happen to friends once high school begins.<br /><br /> How often do we judge others by their appearance?  My sister-in-law sees this every day in her work with the homeless.  I know I have been guilty of looking first at the appearance of someone before approaching them.  In the book, Auggie wonders what the world would be like if we all wore masks and got to know each other before we knew what we looked like.  Wouldn't this be a fun experiment to try?!<br /><br />In the story, Jack was one of the children chosen by the Principal to welcome Auggie to the new school.  Not all of the chosen kids took their job as seriously as Jack did and really did like Auggie.  Unfortunately, he makes a mistake in the story and hurts Auggie deeply.  Again, I felt like Jack was any number of kids I know, struggling between being in the \\"cool\\" crowd and being \\"real\\".  Adults have a hard enough time struggling with making the right choices and Jack really came through.  I want my kids to be like Jack.<br /><br />This book was filled with solid, moral lessons.  I will be having my boys read this and should be required reading for all middle school kids AND parents, in my opinion.  The story of Auggie is a lesson in itself, but how he relates to our reality is what really opened my eyes.  There will always be jerks in the world, people who don't get it and never will, but as long as the number of good people outweigh the number of bad, the good will always win.  At least, I am hoping that is the kind of world I am living in.<br /><br />\\"Wherever you are, whenever you can, try to act kinder than is necessary.\\" Page 301she begins high school she wants to be known as Olivia, not as Auggie's sister.

Again, I felt like Jack was any number of kids I know, struggling between being in the \\"cool\\" crowd and being \\"real\\".  Adults have a hard enough time struggling with making the right choices and Jack really came through.  I want my kids to be like Jack.<br /><br />This book was filled with solid, moral lessons.  I will be having my boys read this and should be required reading for all middle school kids AND parents, in my opinion.  The story of Auggie is a lesson in itself, but how he relates to our reality is what really opened my eyes.  There will always be jerks in the world, people who don't get it and never will, but as long as the number of good people outweigh the number of bad, the good will always win.  At least, I am hoping that is the kind of world I am living in.<br /><br />\\"Wherever you are, whenever you can, try to act kinder than is necessary.\\" Page 301
B008KMHFJY|5.0|OMG! I absolutely loved this book. This kind of romance is now my thing. I had to read this novel so fast because I just couldn't stand the characters not being together for even one second. Well done to the author for making me so invested in the book - it really is a beautiful disaster!
0316228532|5.0|The Casual Vacancy was a great read. The first few chapters give you the background on the town and the characters and it was important for JK to do so. I laughed, cried, was shocked and mad all in one book. It is a roller coaster ride. JK did a wonderful job of showing a glimpse of the minds of very different people while connecting them all. It left me wanting more and I cant wait to read another adult novel by JK... so I hope she writes one soon! Dont listen to the complaints about this book, read it and love it!

B000FCKGPC|4.0|This is the fourth book in Martin's massive fantasy series and it is equal to the others in quality and scope.  He is a master of detail - even if it is imagined and a product of his own genius.  The saga continues and the final three books of the original seven promise to be as good as the first four.

B0036R92V2|4.0|I first got turned onto Django through Takashi Miike's \\"Sukiyaki Western Django,\\" which was his controlled, yet frenetic, reworking of Corbucci's original, released right around the time as \\"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.\\"<br /><br />The film is definitely dated, yet stands well in storyline and cast.  Do not want to lay out the story as you can read that easily enough elsewhere on this site, but would highly recommend owning this classic \\"spaghetti western\\" to anyone who is either a fan of the genre, or any Quentin Tarrantino devotee who also considers themselves a true film (not \\"movie\\") aficionado.
B003XQM2YU|5.0|Of course, its just a movie.  You cannot expect any movie to tell the complete truth.  But this one did - for the most part.  The story begins with King Richard \\"the Lion-heart\\" feeling betrayed by having been abandoned by King Phillip II of France who abandoned the English king during the Crusades.  The reason was because Phillip felt his duty was to France - his father Phillip I had died - and France needed a King.  So Lion-heart on the way home attacks a string of strongholds (castles) along southern France.  Here the King is shot with an arrow, and due to bad medical practices of the day - dies of gangrene.  This is one example of good research making a good film.  Many \\"Robin Hoods\\" have depicted the Lion-hearts return to England.  It never happened.  Enough said ... see the movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and it made me want to read the next book in the series.  If there is a flaw, it is that there are no memorable lines.  It is easy reading and she doesn't write anything that makes me stop and think... wow, what a way to describe this.

B008LVCKH6|4.0|This book is an interesting read that start out well, drags int he middle then picks up speed at the end. There are some flaws.<br />Some of the retrospective revelations are too fantastic to be believable, others like the sudden reversal of surgical impotence are ridiculous.  It is a translated book and perhaps suffers from that.  I do not regret reading it but would not reread.

B008673ZAQ|4.0|Gideon and Eva seem to be on a seesaw relationship in this book, with trust issues, jealousy and insecurities, but in the end a satisfactory conclusion and definitely looking forward to the next book. Gotta say that the sex was super super hot! Gideon is a fine piece of man. Aside from them, I have to add that I find Eva's friend Cary to be pretty disgusting at times. I have no idea how his on again off again boyfriend can be so pathetic to keep coming back. I am really hoping that Cary acts like a mature adult and not the selfish person he keeps showing.

0374275637|4.0|I have read many books that have referred to Kahneman and Tversky's  research and am a huge fan. This is a review of Kahneman's book and not of his outstanding research. It is hard for me to give the book fewer than 5 stars, but Kahneman, himself has contributed to my learning that I should hold the \\"halo effect\\" in check. As expected, his book was interesting and cited numerous interesting studies. Many of the studies were familiar to me from my past readings, but for people who are not familiar with his research, this book is filled with fascinating, entertaining and intriguing studies in psychology and behavioral economics.<br /><br />I wish Kahneman had organized the book better. There was lots of repetition and a few studies were not explained adequately. The material in this book has huge implications for every person. We can learn to improve our decisions and can learn to question our intuitions and demand our \\"System 2\\" to spring to action. I think he could have added value by providing a short checklist that could be accessed when we are faced with decisions in everyday life. The cognitive biases and fallacies are very well explained but lack of a proper framework in the book makes the valuable insights hard to apply to everyday life.<br /><br />This is an excellent book overall and highly recommended especially for those who are unfamiliar with Kahneman's work. If you enjoyed this book, I also highly recommend Dan Ariely's books.
1401235166|4.0|The Fables universe has enough potential variety in it for any story's purpose - after all, it's the universe of all stories. Like any long-lived series, I've seen some ups and downs along the way. Once in a while, I've almost wandered away from it. Each time it seems to lag, though, Willingham finds some way to reboot the series, give it new life, new characters, and new adventure.<br /><br />This time, the characters aren't exactly new. This time Snow White's seven little people take center stage - no, not the dwarves, but her children. And, through their father's lineage, one of them stands to inherit the role of North Wind. The test offers plenty of excitement, with more to come as the other Winds jockey for control of North's power.<br /><br />I don't see this as a must-have comic - but, every time I see a new collection on the shelves, it comes home with me. If you dare to risk the addiction, you'll probably do best to start at the beginning. Even if you jump right in, though, you'll get the hang of it quickly enough. It doesn't matter so much how you approach, though, just as long as you do.<br /><br />-- wiredweird

0765322889|1.0|Wow. I'm actually very surprised at how bad this book is, since it came so highly recommended to me. As many reviewers have already pointed out, it is poorly written, the character development is minimal and the 'plot' is very confusing. On top of that, the dialogue is pathetic, and the over-reliance on magic and gods gets very tiresome. The books really comes across as juvenile or awful fan fiction and that becomes very grating, very quickly. Finally, it may seem like I'm being pedantic, but the silly character and place names does not help in taking this rubbish seriously.<br />Overall this is a children's cartoon, not an epic film.

B007THA4FI|3.0|I went into this book with an open mind, fully understanding Rowling wanted to do something totally new from her Harry Potter series. That said, I was left thinking, why should I care? While the characters are excellently fleshed out, like people you might really meet, the entire story has a rather parochial feel, like a gossip column in a small town. After several chapters I wondered when anything relevant to me would happen. If you like a story about bigger themes, the wider world, this is not the book for you. If you like a small, regional story about petty people you might enjoy it.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|I could not wait for this book to come out and was not in anyway disappointed. I loved the twist the story took. I loved 50 Shades of Grey, but enjoyed these 2 books for the difference in them. I loved the way Reflected in you veered from the expected to a different story. The best part of a book is getting caught up in it. I read it in one setting and was amazed how well it flowed. Now to wait for the next edition.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|It's a good book. I do suggest reading the previous books before this one or you will be lost. There are many different characters and there are lots of references to characters from the previous books.
0062060554|4.0|Christine wakes in the morning not knowing who is the man laying next to her.  She's wondering what she did the night before and where she is.  She goes to the bathroom and really doesn't recognize the face she sees in the mirror.<br /><br />When 'the man' wakes up, he tries to explain to Christine that he is her husband and she was in a terrible accident and no longer had any memory at all.<br /><br />Poor Christine doesn't know what to think but she believes the part about the accident.  She muddles through the day but when she wakes up the following morning it's the same thing over again.  She's told the doctors said she may regain some of her memories, but for the most part it is doubtful.<br /><br />One day a man shows up at her door stating he is her doctor/psychiatrist and tries to explain that she is in her home and that is her husband.  She's afraid to trust him but eventually agrees to keep a journal everyday and read it every morning when she gets up.<br /><br />Throughout the story with the help of her journal she, at least daily, learns more and more about her life.  Eventually she finds out she did have a son but he was killed.  Her husband tells her that's one memory he really didn't tell her about.<br /><br />It's very hard to write this review without giving the mystery away so I'm thinking what I have written does not give you much of idea of what this book is about, but it's got a great twist!<br /><br />But I can tell you this is a really good book in that as you read more and more of Christine's life is revealed.  There are several surprises that Christine must question and again she is not sure who she can trust.<br /><br />Although this isn't the best review I've written, I can recommend it for those interested in a different kind of mystery.<br /><br />Thank you.<br />MEF

B008AX18Y6|5.0|I bought this book IN HARDBACK to help Salman Rushdie in his struggle against religious fanatics, who believe their particular superstitions and baloney are somehow not only holy but beyond criticism of any kind. No wonder some people are still living in the seventh century! The irony, of course, is that Rushdie's SATANIC VERSES is hardly a diatribe against Islam. Like so many things in life, people over-react to very little, justifying their rage when they haven't even read the book they are raging against. I am convinced some people get so bent out of shape because they DON'T READ. Probably they can't read very well. Instead, they indulge themselves in emotional alcoholism. How strange the history of literary fame is, with books achieving notoriety for all the wrong reasons, from ULYSSES to LADY CHATTERLEY'S LOVER to the one next month.<br />  Rushdie in JOSEPH ANTON details what he had to live through once some aytollah in Iran issued a fatwa calling for the author's death. It meant virtual imprisonment with constant changing of address, fear of assassination, and terrible anxiety. (He also got to write a lot!) Rushdie manages to spell it all out, while trying to deal with a growing son, unfortunate wives, unhelpful British protectors, unsympathetic writers and politicians. He is not exactly Mr. Nice Guy, but why should he be? He had the most personal troubles, it seems, with his writer wife, Marianne Wiggins, who lied a lot and even took his possessions. The author falls for several women with perhaps predictable results, choosing beautiful women out of his league physically. But Rushdie also goes out of his way to thank the people who lent him their support in all sorts of ways. He also settles some scores with the likes of Roald Dahl and John La Carre, who foolishly took the side of the bad guys in the matter of murderous censorship.<br />  Rushdie is testy sometimes with people who tried to use \\"his\\" story in works of their own. But surely \\"his\\" story has become a universal tale available to all as an archetype. (He also doesn't hesitate to use other people's lives for his books. They just aren't as well known as he has become. But that's how writers are!)<br />  There are pages and pages of fascinating material in this rather long book. Some details could have possibly been trimmed away. Overall, Rushdie is cranky,<br />honest, brilliant on the nonsense of so-called \\"Islamophobia.\\" (Give us all a break!!) And I salute him for fighting the good fight in a cause that every writer and every book reader should fight for with every breath they have. --Daniel Curzonome a universal tale available to all as an archetype.

B00992CF6W|3.0|Ok, first off I want to say that this game is decent with a few key flaws. Here's one problem. This game is mostly for creative mode. Creative is pretty basic, same as regular PC. THERE IS NO HARDCORE MODE. Survival has a few issues. There is no hunger bar, there are no cave spiders, and as far as I know there are no spyder jockeys, also the main problem I have with this is that, as far as I know, there are no mine entrences. You have to dig and hope you find iron or diamonds. Sometimes you can find exposed coal or if you are really lucky, iron. never, ever, diamonds. I would buy a seed app along with it otherwise you end up with the same world every time. Or you can look at the pictures of the seed app and use the exposed ones, that's what I did. Good luck and may the creapers always fear you!

B008JAFXOQ|4.0|Kenneth Lonergan`s \\"Margaret\\" is a movie completely devoid of conventional thinking and cliches.  In fact, at any given moment, its characters are likely to do or say something that seems wholly out-of-character, counterintuitive and unexpected.  That may be off-putting to some who prefer a bit more predictability in their narratives, but it becomes a highly rewarding experience for those who don`t.<br /><br />And no one is more inscrutable than Lisa, the movie's protagonist (the title, \\"Margaret,\\" comes from a character referred to in a poem). Trying to probe Lisa's motives for why she does what she does can be frustrating at times for the viewer (and that`s putting it mildly).  As played by \\"True Blood's\\" Anna Paquin, Lisa is a moody Manhattan teen who becomes even moodier after she inadvertently causes a fatal accident while flirting with a bus driver (Mark Ruffalo, in a truly compelling performance).  Trying to find a way to process her guilt, Lisa turns to various people in her life, including her harassed and harried actress mother (J. Smith-Cameron), her physically and emotionally distant father, an eccentric friend of the woman whose death she caused, the bus driver himself, a teacher she has a crush on (Matt Damon), a random sex partner, the police, and various lawyers who become involved in the legal proceedings surrounding the accident.  But every action she takes seems to make matters only more confused and complicated, till finally she seems to be lashing out at people with no real rhyme or reason for why she`s doing so.  But the strange sense of imbalance this causes is what gives the movie its verisimilitude, for we sense that this is indeed what life would be like for people caught up in a tragedy of this magnitude - a sort of random but cruel cosmic joke that no one could ever be expected to process in a neat and orderly fashion (as most movies on such subjects might be tempted to do).  Life and relationships are messy things, the filmmakers seem to be saying, and \\"Margaret\\" captures that truth with unerring precision.<br /><br />Nothing in \\"Margaret\\" ever seems stage or planned, not the plot twists and certainly not the interactions among the characters.  The relationship between Lisa - a fairly typical teen who thinks she knows it all and looks with scoffing disdain on the adults who are all obviously too foolish to really know what's what - and her mother, who doesn't understand why she and her daughter have begun suddenly drifting apart, has the definite ring of truth about it. That goes for all the other relationships in the movie as well.  And, true to the code, the ending does not come in a box all neatly wrapped with a fancy bow on the top for the audience to take out of the theater with them. It's just a single moment caught in time, no more or no less definitive than any other moment in life.<br /><br />Along with the fine writing and direction, excellent supporting performances by Kieran Culkin, Olivia Thirlby, Alison Janney and Jean Reno enhance and enrich the experience.be saying, and \\"Margaret\\" captures that truth with unerring precision.<br /><br />Nothing in \\"Margaret\\" ever seems stage or planned, not the plot twists and certainly not the interactions among the characters.

0307477479|4.0|Jennifer Egan<br /><br />\\"A Visit from the Goon Squad\\"<br /><br />The book is a little hard to follow because it's not linear and so sometimes you forget which character is which. You leave a character before you spend enough time to remember who they were--which is interesting because the book deals with short encounters and vague memories. In a way, the book itself works with the aspects of memory and time as we actually experience it--fragmented. Not able to quite place why a name sounds or a face or even a place seems familiar.<br /><br />The book addresses those weird things that sit in our minds. What is time? Will I remember this moment ten years from now? Will I still love you? Why does my childhood feel like a dream? Who was I then? Why do I feel the same but am not the same? Where does time go?<br /><br />It also deals with success. How arbitrary it is. How being ``inside'' is so close to being \\"outside.\\" How strangers in a restaurant are unconnected but when the famous person comes in the room we are one--she is the famous and we are the not famous. Valued and not valued. Her. And not her. How fame can be fleeting. The pathetic struggle to get it back. How being in the corner office can flip to not being in the corner office. How temporary everything is. How temporary your youth is. Your stature is. You is.<br /><br />Egan catches the modern backlash against women, a resentment against worldly success--something I suspect many men do feel but is rarely written about in this indirect way. Through Facebook I've become familiar with a group called \\"A Voice for Men'' and have been shocked at the hatred out there for women by these seemingly ``every day'' men. (Recent republican statements during this election year follow this same extremist view but are absorbed culturally as if they are an opinion as opposed to a call for violent subjugation.) The scene where the journalist tries to rape the starlet captures this subtle internal hatred in a brilliant way--sothat before the scene as the reader you actually think the attack was an exaggeration for the benefit of the spoiled little movie star and that the journalist--because his image is given to us initially through his sister--is lost but a nice guy. It's a minor scene in the book but weaves through this theme of male resentment toward successful women in a way that I've never seen before.<br /><br />Egan does this with \\"success\\" itself. I've always suspected that success and failure are much more closely intertwined than the successful would have us or themselves believe. I love the line where the failed musician says, how did you get from A (when they were the same) to B (where he is rich and powerful in the music industry and our other character is a janitor at a school). The music industry fellow says something like, I worked my balls off. And the janitor simply says, ditto. There seems to be these invisible forces, arbitrary winds that catch the sails of some and not others. Then the writer goes on to describe the janitor as someone that wasn't unlucky but not really lucky, whose luck sometimes swayed to the unlucky. How many of us feel like that? And do you know someone who has done very well but wasn't that talented? Most of the successful believe their winnings are the result of some extraordinary aspect of themselves, ignoring the power of arbitrary fortune.<br /><br />The book moves a decade into the future where smart-phone like devices easily manipulate and promote and literally move masses of people. Ten years from now everybody is a celebrity. Everybody endorsees. Image and reality blur. A near-by future where technology will corral us into strawberry fields where nothing is real.

B0084ANCBC|5.0|Although I remembered reading Vanity Fair in college, more than sixty years ago, I didn't remember how funny it was.<br /><br />Although many of the characters are caricatures, they are nonetheless plausible and memorable.  Becky Sharp is a vivid reminder that you can't fool all of the people all of the time, but some of the time is enough.<br /><br />The interweaving of the stories of the three families, the Sedleys, the Osbornes, and the Crawleys is handled adroitly.  We remain interested in all of them, although it's hard to like any of them.  The one admirable personage, Major Dobbins, makes us want to kick him and tell him to wake up and smell the coffee.

B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is really fun and doesn't slow anything down. I play it all the tine and it has so many things to try to unlock tobmake you keep playing it
B005PK1G76|5.0|This is great for a great price.  Really questioned if should spend the extra money and getting the official Baby Jogger bag and SO glad I didn't.  I love the one large compartment and it is so easy to attach.  Really good item for the price!
6303215734|3.0|Have always LOVED this pix.  But this is the WORST colorized version I have ever seen of ANY colorized picture.  MOstly black/white, but some colorized, and so faint cannot tell.  Not much colorization.  VERY Disappointing.  I did not bother with returning, but SHOULD have!  This Vendor needs to get his money back from whomever he ought it from!<br />Cecy Ivie
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this trilogy!! This book was so easy to read and enjoyable! Would recommend this book to everyone to read!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I tried the \\"Sneak Peek\\" and was immediately hooked.  Wool 1-5 are amazing stories with engaging, memorable characters that I find myself thinking about even after I've long finished the books.  Do yourself a favor - try this.  You won't be sorry.
B004LWZW6K|5.0|My cousin told me about the original, Piranha 3D (P3D). We watched it over at my house and enjoyed it a lot so when I saw 3DD as a pre-order on Amazon, I just had to grab it. My cousin and I, again, watched it and laughed even harder.<br /><br />You have to realize that this movie is a essentially a comedy/horror and almost none of these movies are meant to be Oscar winners. They are meant for pure popcorn, cheesey fun and that what this movie is (Hey, it has David Hasselhoff in it). Piranha 3DD has more of a dramatic tone to it compared to P3D but the results is the same, horrible, laugh-out-loud fun with great 3D. Did I mention it has David Hasselhoff in it? He plays himself and he is funny!
B0058VW36U|5.0|this game is so fun. I first played on my mom's iphone.<br />so that's what got me to want the game.
B007C4ZJ3K|4.0|I am a lover of well choregraphed fight scenes. From Bruce Lee classics to Jet Li, Jackie Chan, and beyond, I have seen and loved many a fight scene. My recent favorites have been Ong Bak, Unleashed, and The Raid. While this film doesn't come close to these films, it does leave a mark in its own way.<br /><br />The other martial arts films mentioned are based around fighting multiple baddies at once, and big boss-style battles. They also feature high flying styles of fighting. This film has several fight scenes that showcase Carano's MMA skills. Mixed Martial Arts is the most practical style of fighting around. It combines jui-jitsu with wrestling an other stlyles. What it ends up looking like on screen is a really well choregraphed and skill-ful brawl. No backflips and spinning roundhouses here. Just realistic, grounded, and brutal violence.<br /><br />The movie itself is not too bad. Carano's acting is a bit choppy, though its her first film. Some of the characters don't get their stories fleshed out too much. But I liked Channing Tatum (good fight scene), Ewan Magregor, and Antonio Banderas. The music is brilliant. Perfect 70s B movie awesomeness.<br /><br />I want this movie on Blu-Ray but not for the current price of $25. That's ridiculous. I'll wait for it to go to $15 or under.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|The author totally wanted to end this book with the least amount of detail and continuity. Such a tragically bad ending to a very good book series. There was nothing worth while for this ending to consider it a good series. So much she could have done seemed to me she just gave up at the end.
B00933JL0A|4.0|townsmen is an awsome game if you like city building games. in my opinion i love it and give it a waping 8.9.also you should get townsmen premium.and check out Gameloft and EA games on kindel fire awsome.
B00008WT5M|5.0|Got my order in perfect condition, as pictured and described. It's a music CD, not much else to say, so that concludes this review. Thanks!
0802473156|5.0|This book came recommended by my counselor.  I read it.  I gave my copy to my wife.  It is most insightful.  In short fantastic.  Over three million copies sold in different languages.  The author is very well respected.  His methods are tried and tested.  My wife and I have discussed his methods.  They work, I can really tell you that.  I recommend this book to ALL married couples. I bought the authors book on anger.  That is also very very good and I highly recommend it to everyone.  I had severe anger issues.  Again, his methods work.  I feel so much better.  I will continue to use the methods taught to me in these books for the rest of my life.  Thank you Dr. Gary Chapman.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I can no longer download or purchase new items for my Kindle for Android apps because I already authorized my last 6 phones, which I no longer have because they were either broken, lost or stolen. This is retarded.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Totally left me hanging...guess thats why its a series. 5 stars. very hard to put down. well done, well done.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I want my money back. I cannot believe this is a best seller. I had to force myself to finish it and only did so from some misguided hope it would get better. It didnt. It is evey cliche from a porno and romance novel combined into one boring story with so much absurdity that I had to \\"roll my eyes\\"; at it. There isnt even at least an interesting plot, characters or story twist to save it. I didn't expect great literature, but thought it would at least be a good erotic excitement...but nothing in it is even a turn on due to really poorly written sex scenes (down THERE?????). Wont be buying the second one. However, the reviews here are hilarious. I say forgo the book and read all the reviews, some of which had me laughing outloud, and none of which were wrong in their content and opinions (except those that gave it 3 stars or more!).
B008KEQMDC|5.0|The movie arrived quickly and it's just as funny as the first time I saw it!  It was a good price for a new DVD.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is amazing I like it because you have so many games you can play but if you want more games you have buy them with the points you already have.
B003MC5N28|5.0|I read this book many years ago when it was first released, I have vague memory of it, I remembered liking it, I think I remembered crying over it, but I didn't really remember what it was about. With the quartet completed I decided to go back and re-read this book and it took me awhile to get into it. It's written very simplistically (of course it's written for kids) but there is just So much depth to it. I don't think I could have possibly grasped all that was going on when I first read this book as a kid, but reading it as an adult it was just heart wrenching. This society has existed for many generations and science has somehow made it so everyone is the same, there is no color, there are no feelings, no one has choices and if you don't fit into the mold you're released. To be released sounds so gloriously wonderful to everyone until you realize what it entails. It's just heartbreaking. What's really sad is I bet if we could have this perfect society someone would try to go there, someone would try for sameness, for a perfectly moldable society that had no war, famine or strife but with the loss of everything that makes us human. It's a well written book, it truly is, the beginning is slow, but gives you everything to understand the society that Jonas lives in, so when everything becomes clear there is just a great impact. Loved it.
B005LAIGSM|3.0|There was nothing wrong with the product but I was disappointed in the story line.  I think it could have been better done.  It's like a movie from the 60's when acting wasn't as good.  If I knew then what I know now, I'd have rented it instead of buying it.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|Departures is a movie that will make you laugh and cry and make you see the beauty in life.<br />It is defiantly for a mature audience, but I think it is a movie that every once should see some time in their lifetime. It will make you look at life and death differently as well as the relationships that you build. Overall amazing!!!
0385344333|1.0|Lee is a very good writer, but after pages and pages of nothing happening or pages of math and mesurements I almost gave up. This book was a waste of my time and money. Jeezzz, write a different type of book, Reacher has just taken too many hits to the head.
B006VGGAC4|5.0|This book is hard to put down! Yes he has made mistakes in his life, but he is compeletely honest! I was struck by his desire to come to American<br />and make a name for himself from dirt poor past!
B0012FHGCW|5.0|Sean Penn did an excellent job interweaving past and present, delivering us to the dramatic ending.<br /> We are made to believe he was a heroic independent spirit who got in over his head. The fact of the matter is that he was a little arrogant, didn't take the advice of others, got by on his own dumb luck and the mercy of strangers, until that luck ran out and there was nobody around to help him. There were major facts left out of the initial pick up truck ride and the conversation with the driver that should have been included in the movie. This is a dream that can be achieved, living the summer in the Alaskan wild, if you bring the proper supplies and learn from the local population. The fact that he brought a bag of white rice to supplement his hunting, white rice has no nutritional value, leads me to believe he was malnourished before he even got to Alaska. The bus was probably the worst thing that happened to him. It made him lazy and complacent. A hunter has to keep moving.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I played the game for 10 minutes and I got addicted.This game is going to give you unlimited fun for all ages.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|I think everyone should read this book, especially if they are tired of \\"same ole', same ole' fiction. There is some funny stuff here.  One-liner surprises sprinkled throughout.  I think I must read it again soon - I'm sure there's a lot I missed first time.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Lots of fun! Just like being at the carnival! Once you start playing you can't stop. Wish it gave coins quicker.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I could not put this book down. I loved the plot. It kept my interest. Just when u think it was safe and she found her happiness something tragic happened.  One big guess up until the end. You don't know who she will end up with.
B009CPJHY4|3.0|The movie has it fun parts, especially the Quixotic antics of the ambitious young innkeeper.  The scripts touch on various themes--aging, class distinctions, cultural differences, marital difficulties, and emerging moral issues.  The story line of the latter theme doubtless appeals to many but was too gratuitous and patronizing for my taste.
1439153663|5.0|This book was very clear in its depiction of a terrible period in our country's history.  It also illustrated the good in people; how the integration of conscience and character were responsible for helping to deliver Virginia slaves to a better life.  You must read this well written novel.  You will not put it down.  The author deserves accolades for her debut work.  Congrats and 5 stars
B004P4O87I|5.0|This is a good set. The minifigures are excellent. Commander Cody has 2 lights, a sun protecter thingy, and 2 antennae to go on his helmet.Ki-adi-mundi is very well done, I like the top thing on his head.The geonosian is simple but excellent, I think they should've included a gun to go with him.The starfighter is awesome, I like the bomb-dropping feature.Overall this is a great set and I would recommend this to any star wars fan.
B0091XRL86|5.0|Being a fan of Ardmen Studios creations,  I can hardly give an unbiased opinion. I liked the movie.  Pure entertainment
B009B50QOU|4.0|I have listened to all of the songs several times and really do like it.  It tends to be more like the earlier Green Day music.  My favorite song is Nuclear Family.  It is a very fun song to listen to!!  My only reason for giving this review a 4, instead of a 5 is the occassional Explicit language.......but, that it Green Day and always will be.
B000001GAM|5.0|There are superlatives all over the place for this Bruckner No. 9, and all are dead-on--but insufficient.  Perhaps a mathematical expression might be appropriate so that all could understand the majestic power and mystery of this once-in-a-lifetime recording from Maestro Giulini.  It just may be the closest thing to a religious experience one may get in a secular setting.  Under this Maestro's baton, strings are searing and soaring and the horns exert a commanding power that I have never heard presented in any other performance or recording of this masterpiece.  I had listened to von Karjan's very adequate 1966 version on DG, and the experience was wonderful.  Walter's 1959 rendition was beautiful, something that brought tears to my eyes.  But Giulini's sublime reading leaves one breathless, as if something epiphinal has just happened, as if one has been able to reach out and touch the fabric of the ethereal plane.  For years, this recording could only be purchased as an import, and was priced at over $30.  Now it is available for a reasonable price, and I urge you to pick up this version, with whatever other Ninth that you may have, so that you too may share that wonderous, unforgettable hour with Bruckner and Giulini.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I absolutley loved this book!  I have read it twice in the last 3-4 days---it is just that good!  Travis and Abby's love story is off the charts.  I can't get enough of this book and will probably read it another dozen times!  Can't wait for Walking Disaster to get Travis' POV.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I loved the Avengers in the theater and couldn't wait for it to be released on video.  Amazon instant video was great!  Watching the movie on my Roku was seamless.  From purchase to viewing was about 20 seconds.  You can't beat that!  A definite recommend both for the movie and the instant video service.

B005RZB65Q|5.0|Have you ever said that you can't learn something because you weren't born with the ability?  Have you ever said that you are the way you are and can't change?  Do you think some abilities you're born with and you've either got them or you haven't?  If you agree with any of these questions then you probably have a fixed mindset.  If you think human beings can do anything they are determined to do and you only learn from making mistakes and not from getting things right then you probably have the growth mindset.<br /><br />The author demonstrates through comprehensive real life examples how these two mindsets can work out in practice.  She shows how children who find school work easy may never learn very much and may not fulfil their early promise.  Anyone who has the idea that they cannot learn a subject may hamper their future development.  Praising children for their abilities rather than what they've actually done may result in a child who believes if they make mistakes their parents won't love them.<br /><br />Having a fixed mindset and running a company do not go together.  If you are a CEO and cannot bear your employees to have better ideas than you have you may stifle growth in the company.  Having employees who are afraid to use their initiative can have disastrous results.  Enron collapsed because its whole culture revolved round the people at the top being right in everything they did.  No dissenting voices were allowed and anyone warning of trouble ahead was sacked.<br /><br />A CEO with the growth mindset is likely to surround himself with people who are not afraid to tell him what he proposes to do won't work.  CEOs with this sort of thinking run companies which grow and change as conditions change - and respond to challenges - because the company doesn't revolve around ensuring the CEO is always right.<br /><br />Changing your mindset isn't easy but it can be done and can result in a very much more fulfilling life.  Having read this book and though about examples from my own experience I can see how and why having the growth mindset works.  I enjoyed reading this book and found it a real eye-opener.  It is well written in an easy accessible style but there are also lots of notes on the text, a list of recommended reading and an index.  Read this book - it could change your life.ut examples from my own experience I can see how and why having the growth mindset works.  I enjoyed reading this book and found it a real eye-opener.

B0071XO8RA|4.0|I am not a reader of science fiction. I prefer my fiction world to be rooted in the truth I see around me for it to keep me engaged. However Wool is different: it's science is believable, its character (yes, singular) real enough to get me to invest some emotion, and it is well written. A worthwhile half an hour spent.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|I had first seen this movie first on Movie Pass (On Demand), and fell in love with it instantly. Not only are the visuals completely stunning, the story is so compelling and it captures you right away. The acting is brilliant as well. I'm a huge Lee Pace fan and this is one of his best; it's what made me a Lee Pace fan (this and Pushing Daisies of course). Alexandria (Untaru) is the cutest child actor! Her acting is so natural, some of the scenes in fact are natural, like when she's talking with Roy. Every time I watch this movie I catch something new that I didn't notice before. If you like fantasy, dream-like worlds and stories that you can lose yourself in, while still retaining its messages and seriousness, this would be a good movie for you.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I got Pinterest for something to do when I have nothing to do. I works fairly well but can be a little slow a times.
B004GYY714|5.0|I like being able to listen to any station and to pick the genre I prefer at any time. When you listen to an actual radio, you ony get stations in your area and even then they sometimes fade in and out.
B0098VXBIA|2.0|What to expect when you're expecting to watch this movie, its boring, with a couple of laughs, bad acting. Rent/buy another movie.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app it is very useful it helps me see the exact percentage of my battery level. yay! ;)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is needed to complete the storyline. It holds your attention from start to finish. Very well written. I thoroughly enjoyed the series.
0393343405|5.0|Well, the Pulitzer people got it right this time. The Swerve is both compelling intellectual history and a fascinating read. It's also a damning account of the pleasure-hating anti-epicureanism of the Christian church from the dark ages through the Renaissance. A must-read that should find its way into classrooms everywhere.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|this an excellent, challenging game. lots of fun and very addictive. i would rate this game an 8 out of 10.
B00328G4V6|4.0|Very good album. Glad I bought it. Well worth the money.  It was a dream of mine to own this album.
B0090X4GLW|4.0|It is a great soundtrack but it's missing some movie favorites!! My favorite song was the mash-up of \\"The Sign\\" by Ace of Base and \\"Bulletproof\\" by La Roux that they did in the Semi Finals. Also, would have loved if the CD contained Becca's Remixes. Other than that, it's a great amalgam of the music from this great movie.
0385344333|5.0|I found the book most interesting, as you get further into the book you learn more about Jack Reacher. the other characters were well represented too. I'm sure there are people and places lke this in the USA.
B00846REIS|5.0|great reading, I have already bought and have started the next book.If you like Fifty Shades of Grey you will like this. Wonderful love story.
B00466HM28|4.0|It works great , but the pads aren't really pressure sensitive . Like if that's really important to you, look elsewere . I ended up just disabling velocity with FL Studio( Fruity Loops), and it works great . I mainly use the pads , but being able to lay down some keys is also great .<br /><br />Your best bet if you want that MPC feel is to ether buy this , use it with FL , Reason, or some other software .<br />OR<br />Buy machine which comes with its own controller .
B0054TVW04|5.0|I saw this book at kinokuniya and was very intrigued by it.  It opened up my curiosity about how the West came to dominate the rest (chinese civilization during thr Qing Dynasty and Ottoman empire) especially during the mid 18th century onwards till present.  History still has a big part to play in our modern lives today. Read this book and you would know why  enjoy!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Time flies while playing and you seem to get hypnotized by the slow rythym of coin sweep. Almost as much fun as the real thing.
0553801473|4.0|In 2011 the highly anticipated book A Dance with Dragons, the fifth book in an epic saga written by Mr. George R. R. Martin was released. The book continues the story of the seven kingdoms and characters such as the bawdy dwarf Tyrion Lannister, the dragon princess Daenerys Targaryen, the knight commander Jamie Lannister, and of course the bastard turned lord commander John Snow. The story gravitates along the idea that humanity is more than the sum of its parts. With love, sex, tragedy, battle and plenty of betrayal, Martin thrills with reader with realism that permeates from fantasy to reality.<br /> The characters truly come to life as John Snow and Daenerys Targaryen battle with what is right and what is necessary and where it all fits in the great framework of society. The common theme and question, do the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few is asked over and over again as both John and Daenerys are forced to examine what kind of leaders they are and if they are willing to sacrifice for the good of their charges. As the story progress the endurance of their will comes into play.<br /> In typical Martin fashion, the human spirit continues to play a large role in this part of the saga. Many characters such as the pitiful reek and the ever mouthy Tyrion come face to face with death and have to find something worth grasping for. The burning desire for revenge or to prove ones worth, or to fulfill ones destiny are all common themes and drive many of the central characters. The ideals or base beliefs of each character in the story are brought out in vivid detail that the reader can empathize with.<br /> In a more prominent role, religion drives a large part of the story. Poor Arya Stark in the temple of the many faced God, the emergence of the Seven, the Red God, and even little Brandon Stark who plays a role reminiscent of  druidic lore fill reader with a communal feeling. As the kingdoms struggle and death runs rampant the people seem to band together to the ideals and philosophy common to their nature. They become more and seem to actually empower their gods which create a more supernatural tone in this book.<br /> Dragons notwithstanding, the human spirit plays well into this book  blends with the idea that humans are more than flayed meat and severed heads. It is made clear as Jamie faces internal strife that a man is more than the sum of his deeds, that beliefs and foundations of spirit are critical to hold to in an ever changing world. If the book does nothing else for the reader, it creates a background for the message that while the individual passes from this life, the ideals and morals upon which they stood can never be purged, even by fire.

B005GFPZYK|4.0|Read [[ASIN:0525953728 No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden]] first and was recommended this book by Amazon. Saw this author on SONS OF GUNS and was interested in reading story behind the man. Was impressed by the character build-up and found it intersting as he and I are the same age. Enjoyed the read and look forward to further books providing insight to what exactly happened after the attacks on 9/11/2001.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Couldn't put this down!  I was skeptical at first, but I do agree with other reviews that this will become a sci-fi classic.  Well written, easy read.  I identified with the main character Juliette - at times I wondered how can she be so strong and keep going on, to survive?  Is that realistic?  Absolutely.  We're all doing it, every day of our lives.
B008RTE066|5.0|...and this time, they got it quite right.  The smiling begins the moment you open the Amazon box and lay your eyes upon the beautiful nearly 10 x 10 box which encases this very nicely put together set.<br /><br />Some may complain about having to pay for the two disc formats; if it means, however, getting this overall deluxe package, it's worth not letting this one detail get in the way.<br /><br />Before getting to the \\"main event\\", we have a nice set of bonus features.  My personal favorite of these is the \\"outtake\\" video of Your Mother Should Know in which we see \\"the boys\\" clearly enjoying themselves amidst smiling stumbles and do-overs.  When I was getting to Hello Goodbye i expected the \\"usual\\" Sgt Pepper outfitted performance video.  Instead I saw something I, myself, had never seen before..a black and white sort of scripted concept piece set to the music interspersed with scenes of the group going over parts of the film on a viewing machine.<br /><br />One thing to point out about the bonus sequences is that the video quality of these outtakes was not 'corrected\\" all that much if at all...there's a little bit of \\"grain\\" and \\"scratch\\" but not something to get too upset about. Also, in the musical sequences, the sound, while quite good, is not as aurally enveloping as in the actual movie.<br /><br />The book which accompanies this box is, in a word, a delight to read and look through.  In words, it aptly catches the spirit of the times both in terms of The Beatles' world and the world around them at that phase in their careers.  Pictorially, it's beautifully layed out adding effectively to the overall \\"flavor\\" and 'color\\" of the Summer of 1967;  some shots are very familiar, some not as familiar...it's all good.<br /><br />The double EP vinyl set-a reproduction of the original-was, for me-a vinyl lover-quite a treat and, perhaps, the main reason I salivated over this deluxe version.  We get the original mono versions of the six movie songs pressed on Parlophone repro labels.  Not only is the sound quality deep and vibrant, the actual heavy quality vinyl pressings are quiet and near flawless.  These, by the way, are far superior to the Capitol 45 RPM re-issue pressings appearing in the Target and record Store Day boxes.  As a continuing fan of the \\"record\\", I'm extremely happy with these.<br /><br />...and, finally, the movie itself;  as  always , it continues to be a joyful watch as a time piece representing-as the book states-The Beatles within the context of The Summer of Love.  The visual quality-given the shortcomings of the original film-is gorgeous;  the sound-with most consideration given to the song sequences-is breathtaking.  This is, by far, the very best these songs have ever sounded in my opinion.<br /><br />If you are an average fan of The Beatles I recommend the bluray/DVD disc on it's own.  If, however, you happen to fall into that sacred group of \\"serious\\" Beatle fans, this deluxe version is a must-have as far as I'm concerned-most especially if you're a fan of vinyl-not only for the records but for the beautiful reproduction of the story book as well.  Well done, Apple.
B003WTE886|5.0|Bought this for my daughter for her birthday.  In my daughter's eyes Taylor Swift can do no wrong.  She loved the CD.
B0081BU42O|5.0|Iain Banks writes very insightful and realistic science fiction, exploring deeply the ramifications of a future where AI for all practical purposes rule the world. This book is also very entertaining and a pretty lightweight read, compared with his recent rather dark stories. I'd still rate higher though his \\"Player of Games\\" and \\"Look to Windward\\" novels.
1781161097|5.0|Great collector's book! An early depiction of the movie and how the concepts and ideas started. Very beautiful conceptual art photos.
0316228532|1.0|I couldn't imagine that JK Rowling could write an awful book after Harry Potter, but, sadly, she has.  This book is unreadable-- it's world is miserable, sadistic, hateful, bleak and totally uninspired.  And couldn't her editor have clued her in to the fact that in print, a little of the F word goes a long way and a lot of it is just lame. I soldiered through 46 pages before I began skimming for about ten minutes, and then skipped to the end. In HP, the Muggle Dursleys were deliciously horrid, and was the family I loved to hate.  I CV, Muggles are just horrid and mercifully, completely forgettable. The ending was not remotely sad, it was just the rotten cherry on top.<br />My husband suggested that Rowling channeled HP and this is how she really writes. She did say that the entire saga just fell into her head and it was lucky she didn't have writing tools with her as it would have slowed the story that came to her.  Hmmm....That's as good an explanation as any. Don't waste your money or your time.

B001RI3DZI|4.0|Great movie - suspenseful, good acting, engaging. Takes your mind for a ride but not as thought-provoking as a movie like The Departed. De Niro and Pacino are a great team and you fall in love with their in-your-face attitudes. Would recommend this movie if you like crime thrillers. Not much criticism - if anything, it wasn't quite as captivating as other crime thrillers like Lincoln Lawyer, The Departed, or The Town. Still a great movie though and I certainly don't regret watching it.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|It should be embarassing to The Weather Channel that their Hi's and Low's often don' t match from the 'right now' to the 'hourly' or '10 days' views.<br /><br />The figures are sometimes off by 10 degrees from each other's view.<br /><br />At least it's priced correctly for its worth. Free.

B008FSCNTK|4.0|I think we can say goodbye to Diane Krall  and the great American Songbook.  In a move that will drive her old fans crazy, she now is experimenting in a more roots oriented sound, with T Bone Burnett as a producer.<br /><br />Best description of this album:  it sounds like she's taking the new car out for a spin.....she takes some curves too fast, and she's popping the clutch at some stoplights,.....but when she gets into driving gear, there's a hum to the engine.  For the most part, this album works, albeit there are some times she sounds a bit uncomfortable.<br /><br />Those Krall fans that pine for the day when she sings nothing but Gershwin and Jerome Kern, better suck it up and learn to like this direction.  I don't think she's coming back....and it's a good thing.  An artist who wants to grow will always get a listen and 12 bucks from me any day
B006YTTVHO|5.0|My day involves constantly talking to people(often strangers or people that I really wouldn't socialise with out of choice).<br />I do realise that is a chore or even scary for many people to strike up a conversation when confronted with a social situation.<br />This book is a very handy guide to help those people. I am a doctor, and more than a few of my patients suffer from shyness or psychological issues that inhibit their ability to communicate. I have recommended this book to several people and though it's not a 'cureall',it's certainly a good start.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This games is an utter joy. So many games are just more of the same thing, but this is a peaceful, relaxing puzzler that gets you to think. I highly recommend it.
B00421IR5I|1.0|No French subtitles, no thanks.<br /><br />Why is it that the producers of French films ignore us, the francophiles?<br /><br />I will buy any DVD from French films that have FRENCH SUBTITLES.<br /><br />My French is not perfect, j'ai besoin des sous-titres pour comprendre le dialogue, nom de Dieu!
0385344333|1.0|What in the world was this?  OK so maybe the first 100 pages or so set up a decent story, but after that nothing, zip, nada.  What you read is go east, no go west, no go south, no take this exit, stop at this gas station, my GPS says it's near here, are you klidding me?<br /><br />OK so there is one, and only one place in the book that is so Jack Reacher. At the start of Chapter 44, on page 208 - he's driving with Sorenson (she's driving) the FBI gal and this happens ......<br /><br />Reacher said, \\"My mon always told me I shouldn't put myself first. But I'm afraid I'm going to have to this time.  How much trouble will you be in if you don't deliver me?\\"<br /><br />\\"A lot,\\" she said.<br /><br />Which was not the answer he wanted to hear: He said, \\"Then I need you to swear something for me.  Raise your right hand.\\"<br /><br />She did.  She took it off the wheel and brought it up near her shoulder, palm out .....<br /><br />He took her arm and twisted it and got her gun.  That's it my book loving friends - from there on it's down hill fast to a flat story with a plot that is goofy.<br /><br />Yes some decent shoot'em near the end, but this is not worth you time and certainly not your money.<br /><br />Run for the hills, this book is terrible.  I've read everyone Reacher book and couldn't wait for this one.  But it worthless - just an empty suit, like you know who !

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|AMAZING!!!one of the best movie ...and it's cheaper than any store out there.some of the store charge you for $29.99,and it's only the blu-ray copy(not include digital copy and dvd). really good copy too..i bought The TRANSFORMERS blu-ray 3movie set before,and i think it's was a bad copy.the movie and the sound doesn't sync.so i'm a little worried too with this AVANGERS copy before.because the price is really cheap,it was $29.99,but then amazon drop the price to $19.99 ..really good deal here,but if you check the price it's $34.96 now.i don't know why they keep changing the price up and down like that.

B008G12ERC|4.0|Don't call it prog-rock, or it'll scare fans away. BUT... to this old prog-rocker, it sounds exactly like prog-rock, just a little updated to take into consideration more modern sensibilities. Remember, the original prog-rock experimented with the new (the synthesizer, anyone? electronic percussion? sequencing? computers?) way back when. I'm kind of new to Muse, but the recent combination of the Olympic song, the pre-Adele \\"Skyfall\\" trailer, and their recent appearance on SNL all conspired to make me pay some attention. I like this Muse album better and better on every listen. Yes, it reminds me a little of U2 (okay, more than a little!), throw in some Radiohead (as everyone says), some classic-era Queen, and I hear a little Hogarth-era Marillion, too, not to mention some dashes of Floyd and even the Beatles. A fair amount of electronica, but also strings and choir. A horn section! Anthemic melodies and soaring harmonies, some funky bits that mix up the sound, and -- guess what? -- a \\"concept.\\" Yup! Prog-rock, all right. Maybe through a modern lens, sure. Listen, I started out liking \\"Madness\\" and \\"Supremacy,\\" but \\"Prelude-Survival\\" rapidly followed, \\"Explorers\\" (reminds me of Marillion), and the soaring ending anthems \\"Unsustainable\\" and \\"Isolated System\\" (both parts of \\"The 2nd Law\\" referring to Thermodynamics, of course). Every other cut flows nicely in the order they laid out. Good vocals, excellent bass, some tasty guitar and in many places a real groove alternating with the over-the-top grandiosity that shows their tendency to explore and expand... don't call it prog-rock, but accept and embrace -- that it is.<br /><br />-W.D. Gagliani, author of SAVAGE NIGHTS
B005HPMB6Y|5.0|Wonderful story. Loved every minute of it. Could not put this book down until I finished it. Definitely recommend this book to everyone.
B009IQ1HBI|5.0|I rarely rate albums I purchase, but this one deserves the praise.  Very soulful lyrics & melodies - in addition to the pleasantly unique voice of the artist.
B005VOMX14|5.0|In retrospect, Wham! was ahead of its time both musically and visually, and set a high standard that they can still remain proud of today.  Wham! the Final captures the essence of a group that had a perfect image and sound.  Their music may have been 80s in conception, but feels quite timeless overall. This compilation is chock-a-block with hit tunes, and one wonders if the party could have lasted just a bit longer with better management.<br /><br />As it turned out, George Michael would further his own voice, and enjoy a brilliant solo career.  But Wham's charisma was unmistakeable and features some of Michael's best work, so much so that one wishes that the great George would take himself less seriously and return to the abandon of his early days.  Wham's influence was huge but underrated, and a critical part of George Michael's music career.
B006BAEQB2|4.0|The Kingmaker's Daughter provides another viewpoint into the War of the Roses, this time via Richard Neville, Duke of Warwick's family. His two daughters, Isabel and Anne, were like many children of their time, used as political pawns to grasp power. The story follows the Duke's early fall from power when his puppet King Edward throws off his influence by jilting his arranged political marriage and instead marries Elizabeth Woodvile for love. Duke Richard then begins decades of espionage in an effort to obtain the throne via one of his daughters, with King Edward's brothers displaying varying levels of loyalty.<br /><br />After reading The White Queen, the story told from Elizabeth Woodville's perspective, it was interesting to read the same circumstances told again from Anne Neville's perspective. History requires a bit more filling in of blanks on Ms. Gregory's part for a meaty tale of the latter, but I did enjoy how her able storytelling made it possible to engender sympathy for both parties, though they were certainly competitors in the most vital sense. The novel keeps a good pace, and though it should not be used as a historical reference, as many details are changed or omitted to help with an engaging storyline, it was a riveting read. I highly recommending reading both novels, as one of the great pleasures I found was the sympathy I had for each character and their story.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game its fun to play when you have nothing to do. My world is ashlyn's dino. Friend me ? Well have fun playing this game.
0061339202|5.0|There are many paths to happiness.  We often talk about the sort of happiness associated with a big event, like getting married or having a child.  We forget about the happiness that comes from a job well done -- and not the completion of the job, but rather that feeling of being truly involved in what you're doing and knowing that you're making appreciable progress towards your goal.  It's that feeling of being truly involved, which has a million other names like \\"in the zone\\" or \\"in the groove\\", that is the experience of flow.<br /><br />Flow is when you lose track of time because you're so involved in what you're doing.  People in flow are happy, and it's this kind of happiness which is probably the one that's most important to our lives.  The big headline kinds of happiness don't happen frequently, but flow is something that can happen every single day.<br /><br />This book talks about the science behind flow, how to get into the flow state, what happens when you're in the flow state, and what the outcomes of flow are.  While you can get into flow in everyday activities like washing the dishes or doing the ironing, flow can also help you attain life goals.  It takes having a goal that is attainable, and doing work that makes appreciable progress towards that goal.  So while it's probably not an attainable goal for me to cure cancer since I'm not in the medical field and have no intent of getting there, there are big but still attainable goals in my chosen field, not to mention in my personal interests.<br /><br />Overall, the book served to remind me that I've been overlooking a lot of potential happiness of late, and that it's time for me to set another big goal for myself and start on the road towards it.

B008O69SZ0|4.0|Ian Hunter has written some of the finest rock tunes and ballads, over the past 37 years that no one has ever heard.  This ex-Mott the Hoople, star, remains one of the best kept secrets in rock n roll history.  Yeah, he has his legion of dedicated followers, but what is sad, is he never connected with the masses and that is their loss.  The 73 year old Hunter, doesn't act his age, and has just released a treasure of rockers, and ballads, on his latest release \\"When I'm President\\".  He sings with that homegrown english accent, that is just as distinctive as Dylan's whine!  As a matter of fact, I consider him the european Bob Dylan.  The songs here, are never boring, and pack a punch, as the Rant band kicks into high gear, so typical of an Ian Hunter release.  The title track,  sets the tone for this collection, and brings back memories of some of his best tunes, as they are sung in the same vain, as his classics \\"Just another Night\\" \\"Irene Wilde\\", and \\"Twisted Steel\\" .  I have made plans to go and see him this Dec 2012, after all, when you are 73, you never know when he may want to retire, but he is living proof, that age is just a number, and rock n roll, is alive and well for some classic rockers, who can still make the grade, and show all the young dudes!

B004132HZS|5.0|The best time you can have legally.  Taken from Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories, this series is terrific.  There is a lot to watch out for.  Dialog, taken from the original stories, pops up all over the place.  Bits and pieces of clues are tossed in and mixed well. The cliffhanger at seasons end make you crazy wanting more. Episodes move fast...just like Sherlock's mind.  I have to admit that I was not thrilled when I heard the stories were to be set in present time (what for???) and with a younger Sherlock (what for???) and was a bit reluctant to watch.  BUT.  This series works.  The actors are very good and understand their charaters perfectly. The writing is wonderful and inventive, and the camera work is terrific.  Doyle fans will find that this \\"modern\\" Sherlock is right up their alley.  If you have never read any of Doyle's Sherlock stories, watch the show and then read the Complete Sherlock Holmes - Wordsworth Library Collection. You may then have an understanding of the love and respect that the writers have for these characters and how perfectly this transfers to the screen.
0385344333|3.0|Not his best.  I felt like Reacher was much more of a common man in getting ready for Tom Cruise to play his part in the upcoming movie.<br />I don't understand using Cruise in the role of a BIG man who takes on all comers.  Wanted Man did not have the usual encounters with Reacher matched up with three or four foes at one time.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I really enjoyed this Reacher story.  The plot had more twists and turns than the usual Reacher story, and thats a nice change.
B00190N4E4|5.0|I must admit, watching this movie was a class assignment that I was not looking forward to.  I kept dreading having to watch this long, long movie about history that I wasn't familiar with.  The assignment was to watch the movie and write a review and now, after having sat unglued to the screen, all I can say is....WOW!  I sure wished I would have watched this movie when it first came out.  I was so inspired and touched by this movie, words cannot begin to describe.  I could kick myself for not watching this before now!<br />From the first half-hour of the movie, I was drawn in.  I imagined myself living in a land like this and seeing things through Gandhi's eyes.  As he traveled back to India from South Africa and saw all the poverty and despair around him, I felt the sadness in my heart and the \\"want\\" to make a change myself.  Ben Kingsley portrayed Mahatma Gandhi so well.  The scene that really got to me was when Gandhi's followers went on a non-violent raid of the Dharasana Salt Works.  Those followers loved and believed in Gandhi so much that several hundred of them walked confidently and willingly, straight into harm's way, allowing the British soldiers to beat them so badly they could hardly move, and they knew this was going to happen to them.  The females were already prepared to take care of their beaten bodies one-by-one.  Even though Gandhi had been arrested and wasn't there to walk with them.  They went on with the plan without him.  They had so much love and devotion for him it was unbelievable.  His words and actions changed so many lives, yet there was still so much violence.  He said a couple of times in the movie when some of his followers would try to talk him into fighting back, \\"An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.\\"  What a statement and how true it is.  Gandhi talked about  practicing non-violence and truth in all things and those words were meant for everyone in the world, no matter what religion.  He even spoke about being Hindu, Muslim and Christian altogether so people would understand that we are all alike no matter what our beliefs are.<br />I wasn't ready for the movie to end, especially when it ended with Gandhi being killed.  I felt like I was in mourning, just like all of those people who believed in him and followed him.  He was truly a great leader and an inspiring soul, all the while bringing peace to those around him.  Now I am going to read all I can about him because I am so intrigued with him and would have loved to have met him.  This was a wonderful movie and I hope more people will watch it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved the story - the sex was a little much sometimes.  Taylor apparently was able to transport himself faster than Christians

1840220767|5.0|With all the new movie and television Sherlocks out there, I decided it would be a good idea to see what the noise was all about.  This book is terrific for that purpose.  It's all in here... all the Sherlock stories.  Granted, these stories are dated (1800s to be precise) but they are fun and easy to read. If you like history and England (London) and murder and intrigue all topped by efficient story telling...this is your book.
B002QS1O36|5.0|My daughter fell in love with the stage play, and we bought this movie when it was released in 2004. She has since moved, and with her went our only copy of the movie. Missing it so much, I purchased my own copy from Amazon Instant Video. The sets, costumes, props, and casting are beyond imagination. The only thing missing is the crystal chandelier rising to swing over your head in the live theater! This is truly a classic, and a must-own for any theater, opera, or Andrew Lloyd Webber fan.

B007UPNA6Y|3.0|I have read all of the Jack Reacher series to date. I have to say this latest book lacked Reacher style. It is a good read but certainly doesn't leave me hanging for the next book. It didn't have me wanting to stay up turning page after page.<br /><br />To me it's like Jack has suddenly lost his old identity. So much of his old charm was not in this book. I think Lee Child either needs to ramp him back up or retire him. I wonder whether he was too busy being tied up with the movie deal and didn't focus enough on Reacher's character. It just didn't feel like Child's writing as it was a bit all over the place and repetitive at times.<br /><br />I feel like this book was actually written for a character like Tom Cruise. Whereas, the real Jack Reacher's character is way out of Tom Cruises league. I can't believe Child's actually signed him up - total suicide for a movie sequel if you ask me. It may go down well for the audience who has never read Jack Reacher, but for those of us who have, well...<br /><br />I hope that the next Reacher book doesn't disappoint me!

B000000WHC|5.0|GARY MOORE-STILL GOT THE BLUES: After a brief stint with THIN LIZZY in the late seventies and a series of largely ignored solo albums during the eighties, Irish flash guitarist GARY MOORE finally hit real pay dirt as a hard rockin' bloozer on this scintillating mix of covers and originals released around the time of STEVIE RAY VAUGHAN's untimely demise. MOORE's searing gut-punch axe work and impassioned vocals infused his lone radio hit STILL GOT THE BLUES, a ballad cousin of PARISIENNE WALKWAYS, which he co-wrote with LIZZY's PHIL LYNOTT. Fans of those soaring dreamscapes will also appreciate his sublime, soulful readings of AS THE YEARS GO PASSING BY and MIDNIGHT BLUES. On the fast track, the name dropping efforts TEXAS STRUT and KING OF THE BLUES are exceptional noggin-knockers. He also pumps up the power on rough 'n ready remakes of signature tracks from RNB legends JOHNNY &#34;GUITAR&#34; WATSON, ALBERT KING and PETER GREEN...even GEORGE HARRISON's THAT KIND OF WOMAN gets the patented &#34;more is MOORE&#34; treatment. A virtual greatest hits collection unto itself, this bombastic, roadhouse party platter remains the sorely under appreciated GARY MOORE's shining hour.<br /><br />RATING: FIVE ROADHOUSES

B0051BNRTO|5.0|I would first like to point out the irony of reviewing this book on a message board, as writing a review of an album on the internet is the central element of the book.<br /><br />Being a hugh fan of High Fidelity, I have expected every Hornby novel to equal it. However, most of the other works he has put out have been well written, but with unlikable characters (especially How to be Good). So, I kept my expectations low for Juliet.<br /><br />In this novel, Hornby goes back to his old standby...music and fandom. These are the devices that served him well in High Fidelity and Fever Pitch (a memoir...but still it fits). This time around, you are really behind Annie, willing to overlook Tucker's shortcomings and even Duncan, the aloof fanboy, is an all right bloke...considering.<br /><br />This is the kind of book I wanted Slam and About a Boy to be. It's funny and emotional that makes you appreciate music, the people in our lives and the events of our lives that shape our perspective.

B004LWZW24|4.0|There are a few movies that just scare me to the point of not watching them again, or at least not watching them alone.  The first two were the Exorcist and The Shining; now many years later another movie has finally reached that standard again.  This is a terrifying, spooky movie that left me unsettled. Very good atmospheric horror movie that is for the most part top-notch in every respect. Some will be put off by the 'final act' at the end of the movie but it is still very much worth watching if you want a good scare or if you feel many horror movies aren't up to the task of scaring you. Not without flaws, but in my opinion, this movie could reach 'classic' status among horror films.

B0000CBHOI|4.0|Seven 90 minute documentaries on various aspects of the blues by noted film makers, ranging from the slightly disappointing; \\"Godfathers and Sons\\",<br />\\"Piano Blues\\" to the sublime; Wim Wenders \\"The Soul of a Man\\" and Martin Scorsese's \\"Feel Like Going Home\\".  The other three films<br />fall somewhere in he middle.<br /><br />As a series the overall impact was less than I hoped for, but still very worth seeing.  I was surprised by the amount of overlap; not only are a<br />number of songs, and even specific recordings repeated in several of the films, but so are chunks of the vintage footage used.<br /><br />To my personal taste, I found the series most potent and alive when it examined the roots of the blues on not just a musical, but also a political<br />and historic level.  When it just presented little pieces of songs by various artists (especially modern ones) without the benefit of probing context,<br />it could feel predictably shallow.<br /><br />Still, an excellent overview of blues in the 20th century for those who already have a love for the form, and for the newly curious.
B009MO57H6|5.0|There was plenty of action and plenty of new characters and things going on to hold your interest. The plot is simple and doesn't need to be more complicated - rescue Alice! The visuals, the sound, the music is all top notch! This is Resident Evil at its best!<br /><br />The movie opens where RE#4 left off - on top of the Arcadia (freighter) with all the humans released and enjoying their freedom. I was hoping to have K-MART and especially Claire back. We aren't shown it, but are left to assume the worst for them. Based on how brutal the Umbrella attack is, it is a safe assumption that only someone like Alice could survive. The sequence is played in reverse, which was new and interesting.<br /><br />The action doesn't slow for very long (just long enough for Alice to get kidnapped, get into a skin tight dominatrix/cat suit, and escape). Alice is smoking hot here!<br /><br />I was beginning to think Alice was caught in a RE video game of sorts when the Tokyo sequence fired up around her (same one from the opening of RE#4, same people, same outcome). This was neat as reality and video game somewhat merges.<br /><br />A part of the mutation this time around seems to be the mutants are harder to kill and one blow to the head does not necessarily take them out. Alice does wonders with a chain and one handgun to stave off an army of these tougher mutants.<br /><br />Did you like the 12 foot axeman in RE #4? Try 2! Alice and Ada Wong team up to take them down! This is the New York sequence. Gotta love the subtle humor throughout! We hear the scraping of a big axe being dragged. Ada asks, \\"Do you know what that is?\\" Alice responds, \\"I have an idea!\\"  Indeed she does!<br /><br />Part of the zombie mutation this time around also seems to be INTELLIGENCE! There was a large bunch of Russian zombies operating vehicles and weapons with no problem (Moscow sequence)!<br /><br />There was a bit of a love story in this. Alice falls in love with a little girl who mistakes her for hermommy (Suburbia sequence)! Alice's strong bond with the little girl is evident when she chases down and rescues the girl from a giant licker (despite everything about to get blown to kingdom come).<br /><br />The zombies under ice was about as creepy as you can get. Alice sees them swimming under ice while battling evil Rain (RE#1). Rain falls under ice when Alice blows a hole in it; the zombies swarm up like piranha! One last attempt to break free as she says, \\"I'm coming for you!\\" Alice says, \\"Good luck with that!\\" as the zombies pull Rain under for good!<br /><br />Something else different - one of the good guys turned bad.. turns good again! Remember Jill Valentine (RE#2 and very end of RE#4)?<br /><br />The movie ends with a massive battle scene in progress (humankind versus zombies/dragons/red queen/etc.), and we know where it has to go now - but leaves room for RE#6. Alice and Albert Wesker versus the Red Queen (RE#1)? Perhaps in RE#6 they can get the help of the White Queen (RE#3)!<br /><br />There is no extra ending this time like RE#4 where the movie picks back up after about a minute of ending credits. There is no final blurb from Alice at the very, very end, such as \\"Is that any way to treat a lady (RE#4)?!\\" or \\"You're just another a****** (RE#3)!\\" I watched all the credits just to make double sure! No matter, I think there was plenty overall and well worth the time and money spent.<br /><br />I had seen the movie twice, and liked it even more the second time! There is so much action going on continuously that it's hard to get it all the first time! For sure I'll see more the 3rd time. Constant surprises!<br /><br />This is definitely a dvd to add to the RE collection!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|For a free game i love it. you can buy coins but also after time you earn them. Its fun when you are waiting around and have some time to kill. Great fun for kids.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|It is the best super hero movie ever made, but enough of the movie. The bluray amazon ships is not the U.S version but rather the canadian version. I noticed this while watching the movie where some of the scenes had french subtitles, that and the box had canadian film ratings and a maple leaf. Still a great value just thought people should know about this.
B007SGM084|5.0|I have read all three books of Fifty Shades and thought so much of them that I bought the trilogy from Amazon and put it on my notebook. As it states on the book covers, this is an erotic novel. I have had so many people grump about the content of the story being too erotic. But most that have grumped have also read all three books. I happen to think that if I don't like a book, then I'm not going to waste my time reading it. I don't usually go out of my way to give reviews but there are so many different opinions on Shades of Grey, that I just had to give mine. I write short stories and some of them tend to be a little daring or erotic if you will. E. L. James has put together three great books. Erotic describes them very well but to me the author has done a really good job with character developement and very nicely done descriptions of places and adventures, such as the soaring and the honeymoon on the yacht. Now most of us poor folk will never be able to do these things but its nice to think about doing them. The books are very well written and I and my wife enjoyed all three very much. We have loaned the books to friends and have yet to have them given back unread. Erotic and spicy to say the least,YUMMY I love them and I am currently reading them all three again. Opinions make the world go round and this is mine. thank you.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app. It gives me the percentages and everything else the kindle never did before! Just like my phone. Awesome! :)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The characters and the unusual world they live in is vividly presented to the reader, each chapter ending draws you into the next.  Hard to put it down.
B0090EIILU|1.0|I Can't Beleive I Was Actually Looking Forward To Seeing This Movie.<br />Sasha Really Failed With This One.<br />He Should Have Stuck With His Previous Characters.<br />Just Glad I Didn't Go To A Theater To See It

B0079R8IYW|4.0|met my expectations and utility for the computer where you use.and is intended to be used in the kindle fire does not preclude making any adjustments to the equipment
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Born to Run is my favorite running book of all time. I've read it three times and am still learning from it and enjoying it. It's a Great story but also chock full of helpful and interesting information. It made me want to run more. It also made me realize why running feels so good but is often so hard. And the Tarahumara Indians are a fascinating culture to learn about and to learn from.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Great way to relax. Have spent many hours with these puzzles and can't wait for the sequel. Thanks to the ingenuous developers of these games.

B005LAJ1H2|3.0|The seller got this item to me quickly and in excellent condition.<br />Too bad the series' 2nd edition didn't live up to my expectations. It was dull, dull, dull. A poor follow-up to a very exciting 1st series. I will not be ordering the 3rd season, if there is one.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I have had the pleasure of watching this epic film 3 times in theatres and each times it gets better and better. The Dark Knight Rises is the best film I have ever..ever seen!! I couldn't take my eyes off the screen not 1 single moment..no dull unnecessary scenes in this Masterpiece..it serves you entertainment at an all-time high..see this film so you will NT miss out on such an amazing treasure from Mr.Christopher Nolan.Nolan blessed fans w/ something they will never forget.Anne Hathaway was the business as Selina..she surprised me bringing her A game to her role!!!her character was a scene stealer in ever scene.Bane was brutal,evil,menacing best villain ever.Christopher Bale was at his best yet as Batman hope he receives an Oscar nomination.This movie is a classic work of art closing an EPIC trilogy..A+
B005IQZB14|5.0|I just finished this book and found it very inspiring. Not everyone can take the time out of their lives to do something like this. Oh, I wish they could!  I live near the AT and have hiked on it a couple times as a day hiker. My sons are Eagle Scouts and they have done the more serious backpacking trips. I have seen a pack as full as Cheryl's before when my husband got ready to take off on a trip, but he was only going out for a weekend!  We still laugh about the time that my son was going out backpacking and he was getting slower and slower on the trail. One of the Scout leaders looked in his back and found a hugeeeee tarp. My son was supposed to bring a tarp that would fit neatly under his tent. My son had picked up one that could have gone under everyone's tents!  The leaders did a \\"shakedown\\" after that and the boys were required to bring their packs and empty them out so they could review everything they had planned to take.  Cheryl could have benefited from a \\"shakedown\\" herself before setting off on the trip...but then, doesn't her way match how we all try to navigate through life? The events that break us and mold us make us what we are today. In addition, we met up with a few folks along the way that offer us a \\"shakedown\\" like the Eagle Scout Dad among others did for Cheryl.
0439023513|5.0|I was a hunger games fan after reading only a few paragraphs of the first book of the trilogy.  I didn't think the second book would meet my expectations and I was right; it exceeded them.  The third book was again a boost to a higher orbit in the story and I look forward to the next.
B009IJJ8UM|5.0|Show is well acted and the plot very exciting.  I wish much success for this show! I originally missed the show, so I was very happy that I could click on Amzon and watch it any time I wanted---Thank you Amazon!

B005NKGEP2|5.0|\\"The Expats\\" by Chris Pavone grabbed me on page one and didn't let go until I finished it twenty four hours later.  It truly lived up to the praise on the back jacket by John Grisham and Patricia Cornwell.  That this is a debut novel by an established writer of other works fits in the realm of \\"it was only a matter of time\\".  Characters that are fallible and accomplished and devious and compelling along with a breath-holding plot kept me reading at break neck speed.  Pavone seamlessly displays the immediacy that children bring to the bigger picture of adulthood.  The author's descriptions of place were so effective I could've sworn I've been to Luxemborg.  But most delightful and voyuerish at the same time are Pavone's examinations of what it is to be human.  The secrets that we harbor eventually become our reality.  The willingness, as easy and natural as breathing, with which one casts a blind eye to another's secrets and half truths is at the core of \\"The Expats\\".  And the ultimate exposure is one's capacity for self-deception as the author explains with \\"Honesty is a consensual continuum\\".  Pavone, thankfully, does not succumb to preachiness or shoulds or shouldn'ts, instead leaving the reader in charge of ruminations at the outcome.  Like a master chef, Pavone uses just the right amount of words to render the reader sated.  And he saved the best for last, a cherry on the top, with a closing paragraph of a single satisfying sentence composed of ten lines.  If there were six stars available, this book would get them from me!
B005LAIHY0|2.0|Scott if u wanted to do a remake of the Alien franchise please just do that next time..this movie was a boring,dull and lifeless failed attempt..ughhh highly dissappointed in this film
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Easy to learn, makes you think of angles you wouldn't normally see, and creative courses. No crazy graphics but it's worth trying :)
B0043UB0EI|5.0|This series is truly awesome.  It's really a shame that this guy died in real life, not only because death is tragic, but because he was an phenomenal actor to play this role, and the actor they got to replace him for season three did not do the part justice.  Maybe if you hadn't seen season two you wouldn't notice, but I would have really loved to see season three with the original actor.  Still, this was worth the money for hours of very violent & brutal entertainment (if you're in to that sort of thing).  A little overly mature (NSFW, lets say).  I ride a commuter train for an hour every morning and night, which gives me the perfect opportunity to watch one episode per ride on my Kindle Fire, it's perfect.  With this show I have to really hide the screen a lot so other passengers don't think I am some sort of pervert.  But that is commonplace for this group and it wouldn't be as good without it (NC-17 at least).  Male frontal nudity, graphic sex/rape scenes, homosexual sex scenes -- they really push the boundries of what you would expect to see outside of an adult video store.  But as I said, this is a lot of what made it so great.  They accurately portray what could potentially have been the real actions of people during the high point of the Roman Empire when put in these situations, whether it was showing how the politicians and wealthy people partied shamelessly, or showing the cruelty shown slaves and brutality shown gladiators, everything was true to the time period which made it so easy to get lost in and really suspend your disbelief.  I can't say enough good about seasons 1 & 2.  Season 3 was good, but it was not as good as its predecessors.  Don't buy this season and watch until you have seen season 1 though
B007FEFLTO|5.0|After reading Fall of Giants, I could hardly wait for the second book to come.  I purchased it the day it came out and have not been disappointed. A great continuation of the story lines started in the first book.  Now I can't wait for the third in the trilogy.  Ken Follett is truly the master of historical fiction.  Fell in love with his writing on Pillars of the Earth.  Highly recommended!!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Good game.  Entertaining pass time.  Not too difficult and absorbing at the same time.  If you can get it cheap and/or free, even better.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|quick, easy and very convienient! I use it all the time! shopping,  school everyday home use! I would highly reccomend this to anyone and everyone!
B000A1SZ2Y|2.0|I just got this \\"lens\\" a few days ago.  I was really excited to get it because I really like doing macro-photography.  Here are a few things you should know about this  product.<br /><br />1.  Putting the lens onto your actual camera lens takes a bit of practice.  It's not smoothing going and until you figure it out, there's a danger that the universal snap-on feature this lens has can snap away and scratch your actual lens.  I'm very careful with my camera and even so it does not mount easily...but having said all that, once it goes on, you and the lens should be fine.<br /><br />2. The product description said vignetting \\"may\\" occur.  I'm here to tell you that it's not a slight case of vignetting but serious vignetting.  The actual image is encased in a thick black frame with a circle holding your image in the centre. Naturally with macro photography in most cases, the edges of the photo are redundant to the subject matter but then again do you really want to crop every single image you take? Then you invariably end up with a square image which, when printed gets compromised anyway.<br /><br />3. You have to get really close to the subject matter for the image to be crisp and clear...really very close.  Finally, if you're a sony nex user like me, you'll note that this product is close to $80.  The Sony macro lens is roughly $250. I tried it in the store. Love.  (It's between that and the more expensive Zeiss lens.) I think you know what I'll be doing.  However, it might work far better on other cameras. The Raynox website has a chart to tell you with which cameras this product is compatible.
B008XG1X18|3.0|the app itself does exactly what you'd expect if you were on the Pc.however I have had more notices saying either the pintrest server is having difficulties or isn't responding properly and to force close than any other app.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|If you like daft punk and anime, this movie is going to be your favorite!!!<br /><br />it makes me happy somehow... its the classic style animation that makes the movie so cool<br /><br />everytime i watch it, it just makes me feel warm and happy inside, after i finish seen it i always keep an smile all day!!
B0092MKTL2|4.0|Well there are a few songs that are pretty dang awesome in this album, but like most other albums there are some that just sound not bad but ok.
B0092ZEIN4|4.0|Alright, so I accidently ordered a playpad pro instead of regular but as far as function they are the same, and seeing as amazon won't sell the pro till next year (only gamestop will) I will post here too.<br /><br />So well, as far as hardware it has all the buttons you should ever need, if you have used as xbox 360 controller you have used the layout (especially the pro). Battery seems to last a long time though I've only had it one day I think it was rated at like 30 or 40 hours that I read somewhere.<br /><br />Functionality I have been testing all day, they just finally got the playground app out but it is still in beta and has only like 8 games preconfigured on there. Another thing to take note of is that the touchscreen mapping ability is not yet released to us so it's just HID mapping which for most intents and purposes is fine.<br /><br />Test results<br /><br />Mupen64: Controls map fine and function pretty much normal ALTHOUGH, since it is HID mapping sensitivity to your control stick is either on or off, which makes most games feel odd. Driving games you are either cutting the wheel all the way over or driving straight, fps games you are kind of dashing from side to side more and you can't walk only run. For now most games should be decently playable like this, though whenever they get touch mapping working you should in theory be able to get the control sticks mapped to a touch control that will give it the added movement functionality.<br /><br />GBAoid - seems to work perfect, not alot of controls to mess with.<br /><br />FPSE - I was a bit sad about this one, the analog sticks won't function no matter what I try, it appears something just isn't right with the programming, hopefully the developer will remedy this, though alot of games you can get away without using them, AND if they add the touchscreen mapping I can just add a control stick on the screen and map the control stick to it.<br /><br />GTA III: works great, though their default control mapping is really screwy you can customize it to how you want.<br /><br />If you have any questions let me know, i'm still testing things. Overall its a fantastic gamepad and when they add touchscreen mapping it will allow me to do everything I like, get this for sure if you are going to get any gamepad i would say.<br /><br />EDIT: It appears I can get my control stick to work in fpse if I don't use my playpad with the playground and just sync it up to my tablet by itself. BUT it appears that using it like a keyboard like taht does not recognize all buttons and buttons, and as such the L2/R2 and right control stick won't function.<br /><br />UPDATE 12/15/2012: I would like to add that nyko has updated absolutely nothing on their android software still, there is still no touch mapping support or added games it's like they forgot about it, a bit disappointing. Hopefully soon they will do some work on it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|When I decided to read the book it was after watching the movie.  I don't typically watch the movie first but I was intrigued by the move and didn't want to wait for the second movie.  The book is so different from the movie.  I know the book is always better but usually the movie ruins the book for me.  This was not the case with Hunger Games.  I knew how the story ended but I still couldn't put the book down.
0307592731|5.0|Cheryl Strayed's life was turned upside down with the death of her mother at a young age.  Her mother was the glue that held her family together and without her, Cheryl's family fell apart and scattered.  Cheryl was 22 and devastated.  Cheryl eventually destroyed her marriage by being reckless and conflicting hurt because she was hurting.  Four years after her mother's death she was alone, dejected, reckless and searching for a way to repair her broken life.<br /><br />One day at an REI store in Minneapolis, Cheryl saw a book titled The Pacific Crest Trail, Volume 1: California.  On impulse she bought the book and made the life changing decision to backpack and hike the Pacific Crest Trail from California through Oregon.  This was a brave decision considering she had never backpacked a long distance before and she planned to do it alone.  She needed to change herself at the deepest level of her core and Cheryl knew this experience would help her piece her life back together.<br /><br />Wild is a memoir that spoke to me on a deep level.  As a backpacker and hiker myself I related to the trials and tribulations of the trail.  Sore and blistered feet, a pack to heavy to carry, full of the things you think you will need.  Dry packaged food and the search for the water, the fear of bears, silence and wondering if your following the right trail.  The beauty of the wilderness, the extreme temperatures, reading in your tent and the satisfaction of conquering the trail against the physical odds.  Strayed captures it all in the pages of Wild.<br /><br />Strayed takes readers on a tour of her life as she bares her soul.  Wild brought me to tears twice and had me laughing out loud.  Cheryl is a brave woman as she conquers the little traveled Pacific Crest Trail and the mountains and valleys of her life.  The trail is a metaphor for life and I think that is why I love backpacking so much and Strayed's book, Wild.  Everything you do, you need to take it one step at a time.<br /><br />I was able to meet Cheryl Strayed yesterday at the Twin Cities Book Festival.  We talked about the challenges of backpacking and hiking at an older age.  Thanks goodness we can travel through the experience of reading books.<br /><br />Travel with Cheryl on the trail and experience adventure, joy, laughter, fear, sadness, peace and life on the Wild side.br />I was able to meet Cheryl Strayed yesterday at the Twin Cities Book Festival.

B002CLBJPK|5.0|One of the greatest family movies ever made.  It's so delightful and entertaining.  It's worth having in your collection. Truly lovely and so fun to watch.
B006Z7Z3R2|5.0|Ti West does it again with The Innkeepers. Just like his The House Of The Devil, he spends the first 2 acts building tension with mystery, intrigue and a bit of comedy, then slapping it on heavy in the third act with the reveal and real horror. The House Of The Devil was a throw back to 1980's occult horror, this movie is a throwback to classic films about haunted buildings, like The Shining. Sara Paxton pleasantly surprised me as charming, cute and funny in this movie and really carried the film. While this movie may be predictable like most movies about ghosts, there is a nice kind of twist at the end that weaves everything together well and If you aren't looking closely at the final shot, you may miss a very nice little treat. Way better than I expected it to be, especially since most horror movies are a let down. I should have known better because I thought The House Of The Devil was brilliant, and this movie is no exception. I thought this movie was great. On Blu-Ray it looks clean, crisp and sharp. There is no visible DNR, blacks are deep and there is visible film grain. There is also a little bit of specks on the film but overall it's a clean transfer. There aren't a lot of special features but there are some good featurettes. If you liked The House Of The Devil, you'll love this. If you like funny, slow, tension building ghost movies, you'll like this a lot. Very highly recommended, especially this time of year.
B009B50QOU|5.0|Just awesome.  Green Day have a way of writing great songs, catchy, personal, interesting.  Just a rockin' good time!! From beginning to end I enjoyed this.  It is a bit differernt that the last two, but great.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I like it,  wish it worked a touch smoother.  I still use it because its relatively easy and dependable.  Thank you
161524350X|5.0|Good book. Nice for horror fans. Came on time in the mail. Book is in excellent condition, looks very nice. I would recommend this to others.
0553288105|2.0|I found this book rather irritating to read. The plot is good, but my problem is that every hundred pages or so a new section begins and introduces an entirely new cast of characters which makes me feel like I'm reading a completely different book and also makes it difficult to stay interested. I am really annoyed by this, so that's why I give it 2 stars. I wouldn't recommend this book.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|it looks awsome and it works  grate dose what i need it to and did i say it looks awsome
B0017JKEL8|4.0|I got this for my Girlfriend because she was instantly hooked. I however, was not. While I think the set's are great (most of the show is on sets I assume because it would be too costly to make the outside world look like 1960) the costumes sharp, the acting superb and the cinematography is better than most shows, I am not compelled by the melodrama of the characters. I think if you stripped away the charm of the '60's and made this a contemporary show, it would be like Desperate Housewives. The stories and arch of the characters really aren't that important, mainly trivial except to the characters themselves. This is not a bad show, it's better than most other shows on tv. I just don't think it's as amazing as other shows. I think shows like Breaking Bad and The Wire do/did a better job of making melodrama seem more important and less trivial by weaving them together better and over a more grand arch. On Blu-Ray this show looks immaculate. Detail is sharp and crisp, black levels are deep, and colors are vibrant and pop onscreen. If you like AMC shows like The Walking Dead, Breaking Bad or more dramatic shows like Game Of Thrones or The Wire, then I think you'll like this show too, but you'll also realize that those shows do a better job of making melodrama compelling and more interesting. Hopefully further seasons of the show flesh out more interesting and compelling stories that are a bit more entertaining. Recommended for people who like period pieces and great acting.
1451627289|5.0|Another heart stopper that I had a tough time putting down.  It is a strange tale of the possible way to avert an actual happening.  Only Stephen King could possibly come up with a topic like this and make it work.
0345536886|5.0|Doesn't have the same kind of suspense or any of the sex of The Firm, but it's every bit as enjoyable.  If you're going to read it you should probably skip all the detailed reviews, otherwise there won't be too many surprises left you.
0743437497|5.0|Great for the Shining / Stephen King fans. great buy, came on time. It doesn't look exactly like the picture, but thats fine. Story is great. I would recommend this to others
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|If you read one book on how to create a happy relationship, this is the book. It is an Amazon number 1 kindle in three categories, relationships, Marriage, and psychology and has been since it came out. It is only about 200 pages long, and honestly he could have said it all in less than fifty pages (although I enjoyed the extra 150 or so). It is so obvious when you read it, kind of like saying, \\"the sky is blue,\\" when somehow that fact escaped you.<br /><br />So the 10,000 dollar question is: Do you know how your partner most experiences LOVE? Because everyone experiences what they consider to be LOVE in different ways<br />Words of Affirmation: This individual feels most cared for (loved) when their partner TELLS them how much they care for them, appreciate them and such.<br /><br />Acts of Service: This individual feels most cared for (loved) when their partner DOES something for them.<br /><br />Affection: This individual feels most cared for (loved) when their partner TOUCHES them. Such as hugs, kisses, holding hands and sex.<br /><br />Quality Time: This individual feels most cared for (loved) when their partner SPENDS TIME with them, no matter how trifling the activity, this person does not feel loved unless their partner is spending some time with them.<br /><br />Gifts: This individual feels most cared for (loved) when their partner gives them MATERIAL THINGS.<br />I recommend this to anyone who wants to love and be loved.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Just finished reading The Book Thief and I know it will stay with me for a very long time.  Narrated by \\"Death\\" who is gentle and kind in his work to bring the souls of those who have recently died. It takes place in Germany during the second world war, but could have been in England, America, Canada or any other country enduring a war.  It's a story of the capacity of the human spirit in times of stuggle and the ability to bring forward the goodness in all of us in a world of hate and heartbreak. I found that despite the times in which the story took place, it reflects as well as tragedy, such optimism and moments of joy.  Loved it!
B007PYF1V2|5.0|I am a huge fan of the Big Bang Theory and Season 5 did not disappoint!  The witty dialogue, plot formulation and great acting all combine for hours of entertainment!  Highly recommended.
B0078XFYDA|1.0|I would have given this zero stars, but you have to give at least one. I didn't realize that the the Kindle version would not have illustrations. This is a book is illustrated and that's kind of the point. It was SO disappointing!<br /><br />: (
B009B53LA6|4.0|I Love No Doubt! I HATE albums with extra LOUDNESS! I hate the distortion it brings. Why in late 2012 to record company's still do this CRAP!  Some moron around 1996 started making CD's LOUDER by jacking up the volume and all the idiot record company's had to follow suite. It just RUINS a otherwise GREAT Album by No Doubt.
B005LAJ16I|2.0|The first few episodes were promising but the story line quickly falls apart with highly improbable, almost laughable situations with increasingly offensive language.  One tires of the Carrie character who seems to dominate the story with her hysterical outbreaks that may be drug induced.  If this series is to survive, better writers may have to be brought in.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|This was a good book. He harps on certain points which slow the book down a bit and becomes redundant. Once you get passed the buds week section its hard to put down. It's always fascinating to learn how our freedom is defended by the men who were there. This book is a great source of information on the afghan people and the issues that face those deployed there. It is great to learn the true story of what goes on there and not the fluffy nightly news version.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|I spent few hours playing it but it is a well written plot, predictable but well written. The clues and images are great.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Everybody  that believes socialism is the way should read this book and others like it most have no idea  this is evening happening  we as a country will never wake up to worried about polictal partys  this is were we are headed
0062202081|5.0|The book just getting started is a great book you get an inside look on what the struggles and life of being famous, Justin is a true inspiration how he always does his best for his fans and always strives to be the best.
B004SHGBDG|5.0|o produto é muito bom no que se propõe, é bem forte e podem comprar sem medo, ele realmente é fácil de manusear e funciona mesmo.
B008XG1X18|3.0|This app greatly improves the Pinterest browsing capability for Kindle Fire, but about 30% of the time it causes a Force Close error after following a link and trying to come back to the app.  But the bowsing and pinning capabilites are much nicer than just trying to visit the Pinterest site via Kindle Fire without the app.
B007THA4FI|5.0|What a great book. I am a huge JK Rowling fan and was wondering how her next offering would fare. It is totally different than her beloved Potter series and it is just wonderful. What a great voice she gives to the community and how wonderfully she weaves her spell of the impact that a death has on everyone involved. She ends it all wrapped up in a huge bow of satisfaction for this reader. Next?? I can't wait.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|One of my all time favorites. This book is very interesting and creative. I didn`t want it to end. Full of geeky references and humor. Nerds and others will love it equally. My only regret is that I didn`t buy a hard copy.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Howey has a sure grasp of plot and suspense, and a deft way with characters that do believable things on the basis of what they know so far.  I found myself genuinely curious how things would turn out, and that's rare for me in reading casual science fiction.  I read all five stories in the series, then immediately downloaded the Prologue, which is equally good if not better.  I'd happily read more from this author.
B005LAIHR2|1.0|I am not sure if I was crying last night from being emotionally unstable or Rock of Ages was just that bad. If I was Katie Holmes I would leave Tom Cruise too after his lead role in the movie. I gave the movie 1 star because I like the songs and big permed hair!
B002TJLEY6|5.0|Fantastic book on a particularly interesting and yet not largely known area. Stories of unprecendental cases and people who did the unthinkable- recovered from severe brain damage,strokes,in-born disabilities. All through mental and physical excercises. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in their own strength and the strength of our minds and bodies.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Great pace , and i didnt see the ending coming. kept me up all night! reccomended reading for sci fi thriller lovers
B0086700CM|5.0|your occassional slow glitches here and there but not so often it affects playing time or stats. good game keeps me busy... I would recommend to my friends.
B008XG1X18|1.0|While I appreciated this app when I first downloaded it, the last couple of updates for the kindle fire app have been nothing but frustrating. The last update made it challenging to add new pins, but this latest update won't even let me open Pinterest. It's worthless and if I could give less than one star, I would. I doubt that my review will sway anyone from downloadingthe app, but hopefully it will let other users know that they are not the only one experiencing on-going problems.
B004I8WD6E|4.0|well, first time having iphone, so i did not wanted to go all out on the cases,chargers, etc.<br /><br />so as i order two iphones, i looked up this cases the price is pretty reasonable comapared to other cases out there on the big retail stores, so everything arrived on time, the case is pretty sturdy, flexible and comes with a screen protector which was easy to install,<br /><br />it covers around the screen not bulky.<br /><br />so overall a good cover, now i liked the iphone so i will be upgrading to a more expensive case,.<br /><br />good luck
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Mockingjay is the perfect trilogy ending to The Hunger Games series.  It also gives enough background information that one would not have to read book 1 or 2 to understand what is going on.
B0063B2BNE|5.0|awesome show, the instant video is kinda horrible and slow though, just buy the dvd and save yourself some buffering time
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Another  good book by Nicholas Sparks.  Good story line as usual.Highly recommend reading it anyone who likes Nicholas Spark books
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved it. Fell in love with Gideon and Eva! Can't wait for the third book of this series to come out.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Easy to read. Really good character depth. Fairly entertaining. Really screwed up people as the two main characters. It did have an unexpected twist that made it very interesting.
B0091REZMW|5.0|it would be better if we could sign in with facebook and have the level and things we already have there on here and not have to start over!
B007THA4FI|3.0|I was very keen to read this book, and did read late into 2 nights to finish it. I love a good mystery story, and the plot was well-developed. Just found the end unsatifying... makes me wonder if Rowling intends to write a sequel.
B0090X4GLW|4.0|Great soundtrack.  Loved the film and the music is excellent (it's not exactly the soundtrack but close enough).  Play it loud and just go with it.  Don't think you'll be sorry.
B008F5YDRI|5.0|Salmon Fishing in Yemen is a great family movie. For older children and adults.  The characters make you believe that this could really happen. I would recommend this for anyone who wants a feel good movie. Chris
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitaire is a great game to play no matter where you find it and I love having it on my Kindle Fire.  By all means get this game!
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Even if you don't have a Blu-Ray 3-D player (I don't), the Blu-Ray bonus disc offers a wealth of special features that takes you from initial story genesis straight through the principal filming and post-production processes.  It is reminicent of the detail put into the Aliens Extended Edition Laserdisc release.  Truly a great film with bonus features to match.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I really like the Harry Potter books, so I jumped at a new book by J.K. Rowling. So far I am pretty disappointed. There just isn't a plot to this book - I feel like very little has happened and the entire book is just snippets of the characters relatively depressing lives. To be honest, I'm only about 35% of the way through - and if my assessment changes, I will come back here and change my review. I WILL FINISH THIS BOOK! Even if it kills me - mostly because I paid $17.99 for the kindle edition. Totally not worth it. Maybe the author should stick to writing young adult.
B001EBWITA|4.0|Constantine has accepted his fate and made peace with it.  He knows that death and a hellish afterlife are imminent.  Flawed and fatalistic, cigarette between his fingers, he plods along throwing himself into one horrific situation after another, in an effort to help a woman he doesn't even know.  It's creepy and powerful.  Angels, devils and friends.  The guilty and innocent. Keanu Reeves is perfect in this role and it's a movie to watch again and again.  Liked it a lot.  Reminds me of Sandman Slim stories.
B0096HIEE2|2.0|This went from being a happy, fun, wish I could be there movie, to what the hell just happened movie..... Word of advise best to rent not to buy!!!!!
1401310672|5.0|I found this to be extremely funny. I read some to my wife & daughter, but they didn't think it was all that funny. My best suggestion would be to google the title of the book which will give you some examples of this humour. Admittedly it's the same type of joke repeated over & over again but I kept laughing over & over again LOL
B0074PNCRM|5.0|Green enters the teenage mind superbly, with a warmth and compassion that's rarely conveyed. I'm the father of a toddler and I really hope that I have the sort of relationship that the protagonist has with her parents. Beautifully rendered, as is the main love story of the plot.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Fun and addictive game involving physics, bombs, villains, and damsels in distress. If like Angry Birds, this game will be right up your alley.
0316228532|1.0|I'm sorry I wasted my weekend on this Tawdry Tale.  What a waste of J.K. Rowling's considerable talents!  This dark, gritty book features a host of unlikeable characters on a collision course for disaster.<br /><br />It's as if a self-destructive J.K., weary of fame, set off a bomb to destroy herself and her loyal fan base.  By the end, I half-expected a revelation that it was penned by some hack saboteur: \\"the Ghost of J.K. Rowling.\\" The book is depressing and boring.<br /><br />Perhaps she was going for an English \\"Grapes of Wrath.\\" If so, her characters need to possess some redeeming virtues.  I believe she intended it as a scathing indictment of the corn-fed rich who casually turn a blind eye to the poor. But since most of the characters are despicable, it falls flat and doesn't fuel the desired sense of moral outrage.  Wish I had quit after the first few pages and grabbed a different book.
B008MEM24S|5.0|lots of fun just wish you would stop saying that I do not own it definitely a fun game though
B008XBHBX2|5.0|Beautiful hi-def print available for rent here brought new life and dimension to this classic. The restoration is incredible and what I would imagine this film looked like when originally released in theaters.
B007THA4FI|2.0|It's kind of trashy- like Jeanette Walls, The Glass Castle, but much better written. I feel kind of sick after reading it (and through most of the chapters). I would not recommend it unless you've got a strong stomach, a zest for unhappy marriages, and teenage suicide. It is expertly written, the characters well developed, and a good flow through the book, just terribly depressing. No thanks. I hope she tries again in her area of specialty- HP!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|great stuff. fast n reliable. very useful indeed. its a pity it asks you to write a review on it. it wont leave u alone till u do that.

0345803485|5.0|I like the flow of the writing. Written from the perspective of an intelligent traditional college student who we meet just before her graduation. Even though the story is sometimes unbelievable, I still found it believable. It's easy to slide in and you're hooked before you know it. Couldn't put it down. I am now starting the 2nd book. I am anxious to see what will happen next.
B004J4WKTW|1.0|This is by far the worst book I've ever tried to read.  I am only finishing it because it is the assigned book in my book club this month. It seems to be written by someone who is very high on drugs and I find that I am skimming through most of it because it makes no sense to me.  No plot.  Nothing to keep my interest.  I am curious to find out if my fellow book club members have found anything to enjoy about it.  Sorry to the author, I don't mean to be so negative about it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|IT'S IN THE TITLE LOL. I love this game and my family does too. it's pratically all I play and you should too.
0143039881|4.0|I'm forty four in 2012, and whilst I knew Eichmann was infamous, I didn't really know what he had done until I had read many more books on the Nazis I'm sorry.<br /><br />Because the book was written in the early '60s, it didn't need a background on Eichmann.<br /><br />Now certainly I, and maybe others too, would benefit.<br /><br />Cheers.
0062202081|5.0|I really liked this book, it's awesome. I read it in just an hour, not how to explain it but it's great
030758836X|5.0|Gone Girl!  What a ride this story is.  I loved each and every character, for they played their roles as reality, not fiction.  A fifth wedding anniversary is to be celebrated, and oh, my, is it ever.  A different type of mystery than the usual \\"who done it.\\"  It moved fast from page one.  Interesting detective work. A good read and full of surprises.  Want to read others by this author.
034580404X|5.0|When I ordered this I was expecting regular delivery but the books were received in 3 days. I wanted to see what all the hype was about & to my surprise I have enjoyed reading this trilogy. It's really a good love story with some mystery involved.  I know a lot of people that have been reading this & all seem pleasently surprised!
B008M34INW|5.0|I think it's the best movie I have seen this year so far. Mel Gibson did really good job on it
B008XG1X18|5.0|Once I found out about this site I immediately deleted my Facebook because I no longer needed it. When I downloaded the app I spent hours on it alone. Love this site.
B001DHXT20|4.0|I'm not the type to obstinately dig-in when I'm proven wrong.<br /><br />So I admit - I was wrong in dismissing this follow-up to the Ang Lee disaster.<br /><br />That first Hulk movie was just about the most blatant example of celluloid excrement I can think of when the category is 'super hero'. Admittedly, 'Superman's III and IV' and the moronic Joel Shumacher '[[ASIN:B000B5XOXO Batman]]' films certainly requires liberal doses of liquid brain bleach when screened. But I've always categorized those as infantile satire - not real films.<br /><br />No question Lee has talent - none. But let's be honest and say there are obvious limits to that talent. And his attempt at the world of comicdom is where that line exists. Sans flying kung fu priestesses and lonely men in tents, the first incarnation of the Hulk redefined the term \\"the living dead\\" - as most of the audience, including myself, were virtually flatlined having sat through that mind-numbing crapfest.<br /><br />An announced revamp of the entire project did little to recharge my enthusiasm. There was absolutely no way I was going to go through another monstrosity without the monster. A difficult decision given how much of a fan I am all the actors attached to the sequel; most especially Tim Roth, a favorite performer. But I usually make an effort to avoid the axiom definition of insanity.<br /><br />Fast forward four years. Just screened '[[ASIN:B0083SBMBM Marvel's: The Avengers]]'. Wow - incredible film!<br /><br />My curiosity was piqued. Watch the only original Avenger flick that I intentionally avoided? Take the chance of being ticked off again at expending funds and, more importantly, wasting time screening another pile?<br /><br />Ah screw it.<br /><br />Couple of hours later - I was wrong.<br /><br />This was not bad. Not bad at all. It wasn't quite the quality of the '[[ASIN:B004JMSIRC Iron Man]]' films, '[[ASIN:B0034G4P8A Thor]]' or '[[ASIN:B005IZLPMY Captain America]]' - but it was close. And any improvement from the Lee disaster would be reason to celebrate. So I'm giving a lot of credit to Director Louis Leterrier. He saved the character from the well-deserved bitterness directed at the utter failure of the first film.<br /><br />Had a decently fun time and, more importantly, I was able to engage the characters this time around. Bruce, Betsy, William Hurt's lesser interpretation of General Ross (Sam Elliot was the lone performance from the original that I enjoyed) and even the fully CGI'd Other Guy.<br /><br />The script struck the right blend of action and thoughtful insight - bringing us into the terrible existence of Dr. Banner as he runs, hiding in various third-world bleep holes, desperately trying to avoid the relentless pursuit by the government. The refreshing plot proposition that he's \\"property\\" owned by the United States, and not a man with an illness, certainly added unexpected depth to the story.<br /><br />Additionally, the clever nods to the original television Hulk - incorporating Joe Harnell's haunting soundtrack, the rain soaked walking man, and other fun cameos added a lot of value to the rental fee. However, I do kinda wish the filmmakers showed what happened to Stan Lee when he drank that very special bottle.  :-D<br /><br />Movie Note:<br /><br />- Again, having recently watched 'The Avengers', I noticed the calendar. Almost a full decade had passed since that terrible first film. Amazing how much better, how much more improved the character was when Mark Ruffalo took on the role. Proof that some particularly adept directors, like Joss Whedon, can learn from the mistakes of others. I'm always amazed that some directors actually listen to fans; they're usually so high on themselves, disconnected from reality - i.e. Joel Shumacher - that nothing penetrates their egos.<br /><br />Personal Note:<br /><br />- Disliked one of the plot threads because it was left unanswered: What happened to Bruce's dog? As a person who considers the four-leggedones his kids, stuff like this tends to irritate. Would you forget your kid? Just sayin'.ones his kids, stuff like this tends to irritate. Would you forget your kid? Just sayin'.
0142418471|5.0|I am a lover of quotes, and I have never in my life underlined more quotes in a work of fiction than I did in this one. There were so many universal truths hidden in the story that hit me straight in the heart-about love, friendship, and trust. I was absolutely baffled by how much I loved this book and how much I related to every single character-I read it in essentially one sitting. So amazing. If you read one John Green book, make it this one.
B002H1J2AO|4.0|Classic movie. Pretty much a must see, still relevant despite how long ago it  was made. I'm not a huge comedy fan but this one is definitely hard to beat.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|The new widget is a headache and impossible to use. But otherwise this is a really great well syncing and integrated note app (perfect if you have an iPad and an android phone)
B00571F26Y|4.0|Interesting read- I found the content and analysis of wheat very interesting and applicable to my stomach aliments, but the Author has a bland prose style. Regardless, very useful but depressing at the same time (say Bye-bye to all breads..sigh...)
0525478817|5.0|This novel was fantastic. I fell in love with all of the main characters and the way their story unfolded, tragedy and triumphs. John Green has a true gift when it comes to bringing characters to life and doing them justice by fashioning a beautiful tale. I am so emotionally tied to this book, both the characters and the story, that I can hardly see it as a work of fiction! Absolutely grand.
034580404X|5.0|I Loved this trilogy! I read all 3 books within a week! It's not your typical love story and has lots of attention grabbing events in it! So far this is my favorite set of books! I don't usually like to read but I would recommend these books to everyone!
B0044XV3QY|3.0|I saw this in the theatres (like everybody else under the sun I suppose) so I picked this up to watch it again. There aer a ton of extras and an extended cut in this package but you know, the visual spectacle doesn't quite do the business on television, even in Blu-Ray. The movie's plot is pretty thin, the acting isn't all that special, and Cameron's directing isn't all that wonderful beyond the special effects.<br /><br />If this was your favourite movie ever, then by all means splash out for this package. You'll love the extras, the deleted scenes, and so forth. But if you haven't seen this movie yet, wait for the Imax re-release. This is a work best viewed with goofy 3D glasses on a screen bigger than 46 feet, not the 46-inch TV currently hanging in my living room.

0316228532|5.0|Whatever else Casual Vacancy is it is a marvelously drawn account of true, largely-unrecognized virtue hidden behind the gritty exterior of the teen-aged girl Krystal Weedon from the wrong side of the tracks in small-town England.  Among the few who saw value within her was the man around whose death the book's story is centered.<br /><br />\\"Casual Vacancy\\" is what the town's governing council members call the opening left by the death of a member.  The sudden death of Barry Fairbrother is the event around which the story evolves.<br /><br />Ms. Rowling's knowledge of human nature and gift for story-telling is rarely equaled in the authorship of literature.  This reviewer classes her alongside Dickens and Trollope.<br /><br />The story is not pretty but it is not such as should repel even a gentle reader.  It is filled with characters that few other than Ms. Rowling are gifted enough to construct.  And any observant, intelligent resident of a small town will marvel at the skill with which Rowling depicts Pagford in all of its submerged but real personal distress and prejudices.<br /><br />You the prospective reader of Casual Vacancy should not be put off by the surprising number of negative reviews of this book.  You will have missed much that is good if you allow negativity to influence you in this matter.  And don't believe that certain classes and age-groupings do not speak with the crudeness of many depicted in the book. Perhaps not your neighbors but they are out there.<br /><br />ADDENDUM;  OCT. 29, 2012<br /><br />I just finished re-reading Casual Vacancy.  I did so because I enjoyed my first reading a few weeks ago so much.  My 2nd reading did not change my mind about its quality.  It truly rates 5 stars.  This reviewer only rarely re-reads fiction.  I mention this to illustrate the degree to which I liked the book.<br /><br /> Though I usually avoid books that are downers I do not consider Casual Vacancy to be such.  Rowling's writing is so good and she hassuch a fine touch in building fictional characters that I hardly noticed the salty language.  Rowling made her unhappy characters and their experiences so interesting that I was attracted to them and paid no attention to the down-side of the story.  Not many authors are able to do that for me.<br /><br />I suppose that the many dissatisfied readers are attuned to Harry Potter fantasy and to seeing him survive and prosper after so many hazardous adventures and so much unpleasant life at home.  (I did read all but the last two Potter books).  But masses of real people live lives that are little more than exercises in survival and a series of grasps at a bit of passing fun.<br /><br />Your advanced-age, well- educated reviewer has had jobs that took him into many, many, MANY homes occupied by destitute and/or desperate people some of them resembling the Weedons.  I can tell you that Rowling knows that of which she writes. And she knows her social classes and the proclivities of those who occupy them.<br /><br />I'll repeat that Rowling is up there with Trollope and Dickens.  I am pleased that the world recognizes and pays her properly for her expertise.
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. Written with complete honesty from both the author and Steve. Loved the worts and all approach. Loved that Steve was aware of his many faults and let the world see it. Inspirational!!
B0017JKEL8|4.0|Season One of Mad Men was probably its best. The writing had a huge amount of attention to detail (note Don's \\"Carousel\\" pitch), the writers and actors had more freedom to develop their characters because they were starting with a blank slate, and the story line was more tightly focused than it was in subsequent seasons. Also, because of directions that writers took in subsequent years, this season had the characters at their most likeable. While that may be unrealistic, and Mad Men is, after all, striving for faux-realism, it made for more compelling viewing and we not only wanted to watch the characters, we wanted them to be happy.<br /><br />The sets are gorgeous, the fashion is intriguing, and the plots make sense. This was Mad Men at its peak.

B0031YJFCQ|4.0|After reading the first 2 books I expected a let down.  However the last in the series was the best in my opinion.  The trial is amazing and the reading just blazes on.  Too bad this will be the last by this author.

B0085Z8F4A|4.0|The special efects were good, how ever the story line, not so good. I found alot of seens taken from other movies and programs. Sutch as the worm in the eye, taken from falling sky, the aliean fron \\"Alien\\" sitting in his navagation seat. The cilinders lined up,also from \\"Alien\\". But the worst part is the story line, \\"Anti christ\\".<br />  All actors actions blown out of proportion, like the christion girls action after her operation, not belevable.And the reasoning behind her travel to alien planet, with out at least a couple of the cylinders, as a supprise for there thinking of us. fair try at a story, but next time, alittle bit of intelagince please. I know its hard, what with the dumming down of crealivity by the liberals!

B000YABS8E|3.0|Blast Brom the Past Starring Brendan Fraser and Alicia Silverstone is a refreshing film that throws together the ideals of the modern day fast past skepticism of the American dating scene with the idealistic, honest, and trusting Blast From the Past. The two morals mesh well together, and are backed up by an all star supporting cast. So, grab a date and a bowl of freshly baked popcorn; or no date and a bowl of your favorite ice cream; sit back and enjoy Alicia and Brendan in this underated gem.

B006TJXZ30|4.0|I feel that the Hotmail App. which I installen onto my Acer A200 Tablet has all the functions that I need to keep up with my e-mail while I am away from home and my desktop computer..
030758836X|2.0|I'll admit, I'm not the most gracious, forgiving audience.  This is really a split personality review because most of the book is 4 stars and the ending is 0... so I met in the middle.  I don't have a lot of free time and I want my books to be compelling top to bottom.  When I started this novel, I was floored!  The author had such fun with language.  The story was intriguing.  And then the second act was such a terrific 180... I was hooked.  Maybe that's why I felt so betrayed when everything started going south with the story.<br /><br />The third act sounds like it was written by another author... someone who was mimicking the style of the first author, but lacked the grace.  The twists and turns that kept the story fascinating early on became utterly ludicrous.  And there was no one left to root for, where early on I vacillated between heroes, which was great fun. It felt like the author wanted to do a \\"gotcha\\" with the audience.  Oh, you think there's going to be some redemption.... well, you're wrong!  I didn't feel like the story ended so much as it stopped.  I was reading on a kindle so it looked like I was only at 95% when the story ended (due to the closing promos) and I think I sat there with this dumbfounded look on my face for a solid 3 minutes.  And then I pathetically kept flipping back and forth like... WHA HAPPENED?!?!<br /><br />Honestly, the first two-thirds of the book are such fun and so skillfully written, I'd say you should read it if you don't care about books ending badly.  However, I had to go with 2 stars because if someone had told me the last third was going to fall apart like that, I personally would not want to invest myself.
0385344228|5.0|DEFENDING JACOB<br /><br />I'm not usually one for legal and/or courtroom drama, but friends highly recommended this book to me.  In fact, one of those friends sent me her copy so I wanted to make sure to read this book, even though it is a genre not enjoyed by me personally.  I am glad that I did.  Thank you, girls!<br /><br />What would you do if your world was shockingly turned upside down by the news that a friend of your son's had been brutally murdered?  And then, to make matters worse, your own son is accused of this horrific crime?  Can you only begin to imagine?<br /><br />This is what happens to Andy and Laurie Barber -- their fourteen year old son Jacob is going to trial for murder.  The repercussions affect the entire town, school, and families,  but mostly Andy and his family.  Andy is the assistant district attorney so he knows the ins and outs of the system -- the system his son is now swirling in the very center of.  Andy is a parent first and a DA second -- he most certainly wants to help his son.  Evidence is mounted, witnesses called, the jury selected; the race is on to see if Jacob is guilty or not of murder.<br /><br />What I liked about this book was how author William Landay kept readers guessing throughout.  This reader was constantly second guessing herself, wondering who-done-it, knowing for sure who the murderer was one second, the next second, not quite sure who did what and where this book was heading.<br /><br />The writing was crisp and clean, the suspense constant, the sorrow of all connected with the case deep and heartfelt.  The consequences of the story kept changing; this reader always had doubts and faith, which would then be cast away with the turning of each page as I read further and deeper into the book.<br /><br />This book was a page turner, one I will highly recommend to my family and friends.  The characters were life-like and real, the anguish felt by every person connected to the case was authentic, the author's knowledge of the law impressive, and the courtroom scenes never dull and/or boring.  I was constantly thinking I had the plot figured out and was constantly proven wrong.  There was a gripping feeling of something 'being off' and 'not quite right' about certain characters in the book; a tribute and hats off to the author for making me feel this way.  This recurrent feeling kept the mystery and aura of the plot clouded, making it harder and harder to really figure out who was the real murderer.<br /><br />This is a book you would definitely want to read if you like a good mystery, courtroom drama, believable characters, and just a darn good story, with shocking twists and turns along the way.<br /><br />Enjoy.<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />Pamdge of the law impressive, and the courtroom scenes never dull and/or boring.

B009GEBBNQ|4.0|Easy to rent, had 2 days to watch it and was satisfied with my purchase. Will rent another movie from Amazon in the future.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Best app on my phone. Easy to use. At least now I can read the Bible without having to carry one evertwhere. In Portland Or. you feel awkward doing so. Reviews must be at least 20 words long
0345803507|4.0|This book is great such as the others, but it leaves you wanting more. Should have at least 2 or 3 more books to have a decent end....
B007GCY8FS|4.0|The first half of the book was a wild ride, literally and figuratively. There were so many twists and turns that I was on the edge of my chair waiting to find out what was really happening. Loved that part. The end was the predictable Reacher to the rescue. Lots of killing and mayhem. Then he walks off into the sunset. All in all a good read.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Homeland season 1....easy to download from amazon...reasonable price....convenient to view on computer or iPad.....now will have to wait til season 2 is finished to continue watching.....And I hope to  be equally satisfied!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Lots of challenges. fun scat game.. but very hard to get acorns other than paying real cash. The scat game is set to give minimums.
B006H5120E|3.0|Love the movie Titanic, and enjoyed watching it again, but the 3D is not jaw dropping by any means.  It does give a dimensional aspect that was not in the original but it's all going into the screen.  Nothing ever comes out at you, not even one little splash of water.  In Avatar, there was so much more dimension, but not here.  I think the difference is that when a movie is filmed in 3D it comes alive in that format.  When you take a 2D film and try and upconvert to 3D, it's never quite as spectacular.
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|Beyond ridiculous.  The story was idiotic.  The writing was simple and full of grammatical errors.  The author has an extremely limited vocabularly. I was surprised to read that the author is married because it seems like a 12 year old wrote the book - someone who has never been on a date and the only romantic experience she has had was reading Twilight.  And no, I'm not saying Twilight is romantic - I'm being facetious.  Save your time and money and skip this one
0525953728|4.0|It was good. Inspiring. Gave you a glimpse of who is protecting our country and what happens behind the scenes. Their sacrifice. Indirectly pointed out how politics guide action.
B007WFR0QS|3.0|I had heard Emeli Sande play an acoustic version of \\"Wonder\\" on TV.  I was impressed and so I took a chance on the CD.  I am a little disappointed at the production.  It's sort of \\"dancey\\"...where I was expecting more of a singer/songwriter type thing.  She has a beautiful voice and many of the songs are wonderful lyrically, but it all gets lost in the overproduction.  Hope she puts out something a bit \\"softer\\" one day...
B005IQZB14|5.0|thought provoking. entertaining. made me believe i could do anything. her honesty was amazing.  i hope someday i have an amazing story to tell
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This book is a fascinating insight into the treatment of children in irish orphanages and the long term effects on their lives. A nice twist at the end. Highly recommended.
0738727326|5.0|It has been almost 15 years since I have bought a new deck to do readings with. People sometimes give me decks as gifts, but they only get put away. This deck took my breath away online and it is even better in person! The imagery and symbolism in this deck is nothing short of fantastic. The colors are beautiful and the use of animals and nature is breathtaking. I am in awe of her interpretation of the Death card as a woman/phoenix. Most death cards are so scary to a client that it can be hard to explain that it doesn't represent physical death. This deck reads so easily that I have already begun using it professionally after only a few weeks working with the deck.<br />Shadowscapes definitely has a feminine feel to it so it is a great option to work with instead of the traditional Ryder/Waite deck. I also enjoyed the Universal Message spread in the back of the booklet that comes with the deck. It has become a regular option for me now.<br />I am confused by some of the other reviews stating that this deck is small. It may be a tiny bit skinnier that my standard Ryder/Waite deck that I use, but by no means is the deck small. I have no idea what size deck they are working with if this is small.<br />A splendid deck for any tarot reader at any level.
0790729644|2.0|The movie is great,and the packaging, shipping, ect.; was great. My problem is that you have  the full screen version on one side of the DVD, and then the letterbox version on the other. The full screen side will not play. I really wanted to send it back for another one but my work schedule has been too hectic, so I was rather forced to keep the DVD. Amazon was great , as always, with shipping, ect. I wish I could trade the movie for another copy of it.
B005LAIHR2|5.0|im not a fan of musicals. but when it comes to a rock musical, im gonna give it a chance and my verdict is, id buy it twice! i love the choice of songs in this film, yet i do wish more songs were included. i still wonder how pink floyd's the wall would be incorporated. i truly am surprised that no aerosmith material was included. but then again, the local radio station plays aerosmith practically every other song (hypothetically) so its kind of a brake. all in all, this is a great movie if you love musicals and/or rock music.
B001DMJ9R4|5.0|I loved this album, and the most amazing thing is that it comes with the live presentation at the LBC GREAT!

B007URVZJ6|4.0|I never got this item. And it is not on my items shipped page. So I can not make a review of this item.<br />I did not get this \\"Building Your Book for Kindle\\". What's up with that!<br />The one start is there, because I had to put it there, for this to go thru.<br /><br />I owe someone a big big apology. I was waiting for the paperbock book to come in the mail. I forgot I brought the Kindle ebook. I looked on my<br />iPodTouch and there it was. Please forgive me, I am very sorry about that. Please, please forgive me.<br />Thanks<br />meto
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This is one of my favorite books!  I loved the characters.  I couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen next.  I can't wait for the 2nd book.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Non-King readers, give this book a chance!    I thought this book was amazing. Let me preface by saying my review is going to be a bit biased. Not just because I'm a big fan of King, but because it reads nothing like a typical King book. Which in this case is a good thing. (That, and the central main character, is a teacher). 11/22/63 is the story of a man (Jake Epping) who is given the mission to go back in time and prevent the assassination of JFK.    11/22/63 has all the familiar elements of a King novel, but it's vastly toned down. The genre is more of a Suspense/Action with a subplot of Romance. It's a refreshing change from such graphic, unnecessary detail one would normally expect. This is one of the few King books I would recommend to everyone in any adult age group regardless if they don't care for his work.    Positives:      -The main character, Jake, is a wonderful protagonist. He is a character that is very easy to relate to. You are able to immerse yourself deeper into the book given his point of view. I've never been so gripped by a King main character.    There are so many hilarious bits in this book during the actual time travel. The many ways he screws up. Pure genius.      *****[START MINI-SPOILERS]*****    The idea that he genuinely believes his disguises make him look incognito....at 6'4\\". This made me keel over with laughter. What crowd is he going to blend into at that height?  -His thoughts. (Especially when he knows he just said something that gives himself away).  -The accidental spoken references to the future.    *****[END MINI SPOILERS]******    Negatives:    -The pacing. We get a very intense page turner for the first half of the book. However, like many of the lower-star reviews, the middle of the book is dense and painfully tedious. I would say there is a 90+ page window where you get pummeled with monotony. (Both in Jodie and Fort Worth). The welcome is overstayed in both cities. You will hit a brick wall, and you will be dying to get this section of the book over with. Worst of all, it isn't even crucial to the story. There is a LOT of looping in this book (which is normal for a time-travel novel), but there's too much of it. The climax is *very* fast, and then quickly deflates. This book could have easily shaved off 150 pages and it would never be missed..    -The abrupt resolution. It's no more than 4 pages long. (I can't say what particular part it is without it being a major spoiler). It undermines the entire point of the plot! It also sounds completely pulled out of thin air. Almost as if the editors were thinking \\"It's been 800 pages, I gotta wrap this up.\\" WHY is this part so short? The last 60 pages get muddled and rushed as if they were actually in a hurry to end it. The ending itself is very cute, and ends on a high note to this WAY too long story.    -The foreshadowing. It gets repetitive and old.    Blah, blah, blah...GREAT BOOK! One of his better novels. It earns a spot as my second favorite book he's written.
B001O03NCW|5.0|This is great and makes me want to see this movie again.I love the music and the movie that goes with it.
B00684J49U|5.0|Grey's Anatomy is a great show...watching this dvd is far better than waiting for reruns and with no commercials...well that's the best too!!!  also like watching the extras that dvd's have.  if you are a fan of the show like i am you have to add this to your collection.
B007THA4FI|4.0|This book showed a completely new side of JK Rowling and I really enjoyed it. The book was very honest about people and their feelings and thoughts. It reminded me that people are fragile and can be severely misunderstood. At times I would confuse the characters because there were so many of them, but after the first fourth of the book I had them all straightened out.
B007THA4FI|3.0|It was well written and I did enjoy it. That said, I did prefer the HP series to this offering by J.K. (which is probably my preference in books over any flaw in the writing). All in all, a good read, but if fantasy/upbeat comedy is your thing you just might be sorely disappointed.
B0083SBJXS|4.0|1. Picture - 5 stars<br />2. Sound - 5 stars<br />3. Movie duration - 3 stars (a little too long)<br />4. Fun factor - 5 stars<br /><br />I wish all Blu Ray movies had this type of sound and picture quality.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|I was looking forward to seeing this movie because I love Tim Burton's movies (usually). I also watched some of the original Dark Shadows when I was a kid (when it originally aired). This movie was OK but never felt like a Burton movie. I think Johnny Depp played it too serious. His movies are usually creepy the whole time but this one saves it for that last 15 minutes. If it had been 1/2 as creepy as the end throughout the movie it would have been great.

B006LSZECO|1.0|I was very disappointed in this book. First, reading it was a very depressing experience. The book dragged and dragged and then the ending was awful! The book was a complete waste of my time!
B0034G4OYA|5.0|-------------------------------------------------------<br />\\"Hotel Transylvania\\"<br />(Sony Animation, 2012)<br />-------------------------------------------------------<br />This kid-oriented animated comedy was an unexpected pleasure -- I went into it with my kid with mild dread, but enjoyed it from start to finish, and left the theater in a great mood. \\"Hotel Transylvania\\" is an extended spoof of classic monster-movie characters -- Dracula, Frankenstein, the Wolfman, the Mummy, The Blob, et al -- with lots of unsubtle though entertaining jokes based on their various traits , and a simple, wholesome message about parents and kids learning to respect and love one another.<br /><br />The story centers on daddy Dracula, who has retreated from the world and holed up in a remote castle which he built as a refuge for monsters who want a break from the hatred and persecution of monster-fearing, violent humans, and more importantly as a well-feathered nest for his daughter Mavis who -- at 118 years old -- wants to finally go see the world, but is still held back by her overprotective dad. Mavis is a stylish, laconic, Goth-y gal, sort of like the Incredibles' Violet but with a hipper haircut and some really cute little fangs. Like most of the characters, she isn't overdone; the tone is just right, as it is for her dad who, even though he's overbearing, is entirely likable and sympathetic. The script cheerfully traffics in formula and affectionately crafted cliches, as well as a nonstop barrage of inoffensive, kid-friendly humor (a few fart jokes, but nothing worse than that). It was just the right tone for families with younger children who want a macabre, monster-y theme, but don't want to get all Tim Burton-ed-out and irony-laden about it and don't want to see anything genuinely scary. If you liked \\"Monsters Inc.\\" you'll probably enjoy this as well -- it's not as great a movie, but it's nice, light fun and works as well for Father's Day as for Halloween. Recommended!

B008MEM24S|5.0|It seemed silly to buy another version of Where's My Water, but my 8 year old loves Phineas and Ferb and particularly Perry. It was only .99, so I said okay.  The ice to steam to water is clever and the graphics/sounds of Perry shooting through the tube really are fun.  He loves both games and we've bought a few of the extra levels for $1 or so each.  I kind of wonder if we will always buy extras, but when you consider the price of say a play station game that they may not even like, it seems well worth spending $1-3 for something extra, particularly before a vacation or long road trip!
B0087HT36U|5.0|This is one of my favorite android games. Must have if you like angry birds style of games. The only issue is aometimes it bogs down, but no big deal.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|Unfortunately, the trailer gave too much of the premise away.  It was too easy to connect Ridley Scott and the alien ship from the trailer to the original Alien film, which is one of my all-time favorites, for the ultimate connection to come as much of a surprise.  Sensing the connection, I enjoyed watching the many similarities unfold, but I might have enjoyed the revelation more if I hadn't already been expecting it.<br /><br />That said, all it took was a good measure of suspension of disbelief for me to enjoy the film immensely.  Sixty years of reading good science fiction (and a like period of watching good and not-so-good science fiction movies) has made that surprisingly easy for me.  As did Alien, Prometheus did an outstanding job of straddling the indistinct line between science fiction and horror.  The creatures were onscreen just enough to keep me worried, and the special effects that weren't creature-related were outstanding.<br /><br />Having bought the DVD, I'll watch the film again.  I'll probably put it on my shelf next to the Alien Quadrilogy with the mental note that the prequel is better than all of the sequels combined.
0307454541|3.0|I'm always the last one at the party when it comes to hot trends. I don't jump on the bandwagon--I follow well worn ruts down a deserted highway.<br /><br />So when I found a battered copy of Stieg Larrson's The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo on vacation this summer, I decided to see what all the fuss was about. This bulky international bestseller seemed like a perfect beach read.<br /><br />GWTDT wasn't what I expected. I was anticipating something edgy and raw. (Wasn't this book made into a movie directed by David Fincher, with music by Trent Reznor?) What I got was a quaint murder mystery that has more in common with Old English Agatha Christie and Ruth Rendell whodunnits than \\"Seven\\" or \\"Head Like A Hole.\\"<br /><br />There's a dated feel to this book that belies its copyright. Were girls with tattoos and piercings cutting-edge even a decade ago when Larrson wrote this novel? Today the malls and college campuses are filled with Lisbeth Salander look-a-likes. I think a girl with a dragon tattoo took my application for a bank loan the other day.<br /><br />An alternate title for this book could be The Editor With The Magnetic Hard-On, based on the way protagonist Mikael Blomkvist attracts the ladies. Indeed, Larrson, a magazine editor and investigative journalist himself (well, before he died in 2004, before his books ever saw print--damn, that's a bitch!), romanticizes the field of journalism to an embarrassing degree. Blomkvist has the superhuman idealism and incorruptible moral center that make Ayn Rand's characters so annoying.<br /><br />There is dark, murderous, incestuous, wickedness here, (though nothing that hasn't been covered before in the classic noir of James M. Cain or Jim Thompson) but Larrson keeps it carefully hidden for 500 pages. It's a long wait at times.<br /><br />Still, there's a sleepy charm to Larrson's writing that draws you in and keeps you there. The chilly backdrop of Sweden and remote Hedeby Island is perhaps the most interesting character in this book. Larrson adds complexity layer by layer, and the mystery of Harriet Vanger's disappearance (you need a scorecard to keep track of all the different Vangers in this book!) builds with clever twists and turns. This is also a tale of white collar crime and corporate greed, themes close the public heart in 2008, when this novel topped the bestseller lists.<br /><br />The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo IS a great beach read--though it took me two months to chip away at this 600-page monster! It's not the dragon tattoo that makes Lisbeth Salander so fascinating. It's her survival instinct, troubled past, and sullen, kick-ass attitude that makes this slow climb through the Vanger family tree so compelling.r in this book.

0307341577|5.0|This was my kind of book!  I loved it!  It was disturbing and very dark, but written so well.  I've never read a book that had this style of writing and I found it very enjoyable.  I could have done without the animal abuse (cow).  That actually made me squirm and was so upsetting and sad to me, but I understand that the writer was giving us another glimps of the characters' horrific mental state.  You really did hate them!  All in all I couldn't put the book down!  I'm so excited to go on to her newest book, Gone Girl!  Gillian Flynn is a favorite of mine!

B004T4LUPW|5.0|I have no idea if this was ever a free app. I paid full price and have not regretted it. I do not have an android phone, and I have FOUR different calendars that I use for work. It takes forever to update them all. Now I just use this and Google calendar. it reminds me anyway I want, SMS, email, pop-up, 15 times if I ask it too.  The only thing that made me give it a 4 star rating was the many, many settings, 90% of which were completely unfamiliar to me, and not really explained. It took several weeks of futzing with them to get it the way I like it. Now I can't see how I lived without it.  Update: 4/23/15 I still use this as my primary calendar, on my Android tablet and phone (paid for another version, too) and all my Kindles. It only reminds up to 5 times, but has many other features that help and I can put more than one thing in if I want 15 reminders (I don't!).  I increased my rating to 5 stars because now I get it! Or mostly. The website is not that great, no search so it is still hard to find what you need to know. A google search of the problem, like questions on floating dates, turns up the CalenGoo pages so all is not lost.

0374214913|3.0|I heard an interview with the author on NPR which made me so eager to read the book that I bought it instead of getting it from my local library.  I wish I'd had patience and gotten the book from the library.  It was an okay read, not a great read, and a little too nerdy for my taste.  I'm still a bit perplexed about the ending.  To paraphrase one reviewer, much of the book read like a really long, sugary advertisement for the 'cult' of Google.  I got sick and tired of reading about Google.  I think the author should have spent more time on character development.  He had some interesting characters, but they were merely stick people with no flesh and blood.<br /><br />I gave it three stars because it was well-written and fairly engaging for a first novel, even if I didn't understand much of the computer-speak.

0525953728|3.0|I rated this book a three star even though it was a good read but the early release took something away from the events. When missions such as these are made public they take away some of the power of the event. Truely we have brave men and women working hard but discloser of these events takes something away. Part of our strength is the mystic connected with these events and the discipline to keep them quite. This is a hard concept to understand by most people.
1423140605|3.0|So, a couple of days ago, I read the Mark of Athena. I didn't get a chance to do a full-on review so I'm going to take the time to do it now.<br /><br />I had pretty low expectations for the Mark of Athena. Rick Riordan is a brilliant author but he really let me down with the Heroes of Olympus. I loved the plot. But the characters...meh.<br /><br />So, when I started reading, I expected it to be Twlight bad. I'm glad to say that I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Characters:<br /><br />Percy - I loved him in Percy Jackson and the Olympians. He. Was. Awesomeness. In SoN, he was...different. He was more of a jerk. And when Hazel says that he has the good looks of a Roman god, I got really pissed. This is my Percy here. He does not have the good looks of a fricking Roman god. He is lovable, adorable Percy, not a Gary-Stu. And what the heck was it with all the romance? I mean, Annabeth didn't make an appearance but all he thought about was the romance between him and her. Um, they were dating for two months. They were friends for FOUR YEARS. And I was irritated because he remembered her, not his mother, just her. What is RR trying to say here? That the person he's known for all of his life is less important than his girlfriend? That was not sweet. It was irritating. But my theory is still that because she's his mortal point, he couldn't forget her. Plus, maybe Juno left him the memory of Annabeth because she would guide him, just like the memory of Thalia guided Jason.<br /><br />Sorry, got off track.<br /><br />In MoA, Percy rather irritated me at times. Like when he was mouthing off to Bacchus. In TLT, Percy mouthed off to Dionysus but he stopped because he knew that the god could drive him insane. He never pushed the god too far. But in MoA, despite the fact that he knew the Roman and Greek gods were different, (He admitted that in SoN when he was talking about Mars) he kept on being a smart ass.<br /><br />And then Percy also annoyed me when Hercules came into the picture. I expected him to mention Zoe Nightshade. Talk to Hercules. Do something. Zoe gave up her fricking life. But Percy doesn't even mention her name. I mean, Percy's probably busy. But for him to forget the girl who sacrificed herself for him and his friends? That's supreme jerkiness right there.<br /><br />I give his character 3.5/5 stars. He was okay. Not as good as I wanted. He seemed more like a filler character. He was just there. But I loved his bromance with Jason. I thought that was written rather well.<br /><br />Annabeth - I like Annabeth as a character. She has flaws and she knows that. But she tries to improve them. I think I would like her as a friend, too. We would probably kill each other if we ever met as both our prides are the size of the Atlantic but she's a cool person. In fact, I rather liked her in MoA. She was simply Annabeth.<br /><br />That being said, I had my own share of problems with her.<br /><br />1. She mentioned that she had had a crush on Percy since she was twelve. No, no, no.<br /><br />Percabeth was brilliantly written...in PJO. Part of the reason I adored it was because of their relationship. I loved how they had a complicated relationship and it wasn't all Insta!Love. And now RR is basically telling me that the wonderful Percabeth relationship was all a freaking lie?<br /><br />2. She mentioned that she thought Nico had a crush on her.<br /><br />That comment seemed so utterly out-of-place. It just irked me.<br /><br />3. She went on and on about how Reyna was all alone and bitter and how she felt sorry for her yet she didn't do anything about it.<br /><br />Come on. Siriusly? That's like saying, \\"I saw a puppy being beaten by it's owner. I feel sorry for her.\\" and then not doing anything about it. She could've talked to Reyna, been kinder, something.<br /><br />4. She was too powerful, for my tastes.<br /><br />Not in like, the Percy way. But the fact that from a glance she could decipher that Frank and Hazel were dating but not for long and blah, blah, blah. With a skill like that, you could exploit someone's weakness and destroy them within seconds. I wouldn't have minded if she wasn't that good at reading people. But the fact that she could just look at someone and decipher who they were, how they felt, what kind of person they were, who they liked, etc. was a power overload.<br /><br />Besides these problems I had with her, I liked her character. A lot. She told the story rather well. She wasn't a filler, like Percy.<br /><br />4/5 stars for her.<br /><br />Leo - I love Leo. He's just so realistic. Personality-wise, anyways. He's not perfect, he's the seventh wheel, but he's still a good person.<br /><br />In MoA, he's matured. A lot. And I liked it - a lot. He still had the humor thing going for him but he grew up a bit, too. I could go on and on about how much I love this character. I love him as a friend and a character. I didn't really have any problems with him. However, just to be very nit-picky, I'm going to have to say this:<br /><br />I didn't like how he just kept to himself. For some reason, I think that he's sort of the replacement for Grover. Because in PJO, Grover was kind of the person who called people out on their flaws. He stood up to his friends. Whenever someone's ego got too big, he decreased it. Without him, Percy's getting too cocky.<br /><br />So when I read TLH, I thought, \\"This is it, peoples. This is the replacement for Grover. He's going to be the one to stand up to his friends.\\"<br /><br />So you can imagine my disappointment when in MoA, all he did was think about his friends' flaws. He kept quiet about his complaints. That's the type of person he is. It's not really something I hold against him because that's just who he is. It was just a personal disappointment for me.<br /><br />I give him 4.5/5 stars. (That's really high in my book. To get that is an accomplishment.)<br /><br />Piper - To tell you the truth, I've never really liked her. I'vealways wanted to. I've tried so freaking hard. I kept on repeating her positive features but I never truly liked her. I didn't hate her. Definitely not. I simply disliked her as a character - a lot. Even in the middle of The Lost Hero, I realized that I really, really disliked her.<br /><br />So when I read MoA, I had low expectations for this character. Really low. But I really wanted to like her. I wanted her to be a good character.<br /><br />However, she just made it so hard. She had a lot of flaws. Usually, that makes a character realistic. But with her...*sighs* everyone thinks she's perfect. She's pretty Piper and even though she has a lot of flaws, no one calls them out. No one cares. She's perfect in everyone's eyes.<br /><br />1. She's selfish.<br /><br />Example a. She realizes that Venus might be influencing Jason. She acknowledges that their relationship was built on fake memories. But she doesn't care. Page 473.<br /><br />When you consider the possibility that your relationship with a guy might be fake and influenced by someone else, yet you don't care, well...there's something wrong with you.<br /><br />Example b. When it's Jason's birthday and he has to make a wish, she hopes that he wishes that the two of them will get out of the quest alive and be together forever.<br /><br />Um whoa, girl. What about Leo? Everything you've been through with Jason, Leo was mostly a part of it, too. And you call Annabeth one of your best friends yet you don't even think about her? What about Percy? Frank? Hazel? Come on, life is not a fairytale. Think about others.<br /><br />Example c. \\"Piper eyes flashed defiantly, like anything Reyna could do, she could do.\\" Page 213.<br /><br />Come on, this isn't about Reyna. This is about the world. Just put your selfish desires away and think about other people. And Reyna's already lost. Just, please, stop.<br /><br />Example d. She wants more and more alone time with Jason even though they were together almost all the time.<br /><br />Example e. She doesn't put enough effort into the charmspeak to stop the Greeks and Romans from fighting because she's so afraid that Jason will go back to the Romans.<br /><br />2. She's obsessed with Jason, once again.<br /><br />In TLH, it was obvious that she was obsessed with Jason. She mentioned him over and over.<br /><br />I own the Lost Hero and I have counted how many times they talk about each other's looks. Well, I started to but then I got tired from counting. But, in every Piper chapter that Jason makes an appearance in, Piper mentions how good-looking Jason is twice. And some of the chapters aren't even that long! Now, as for Jason mentioning Piper's looks, he mentions about 1.5 in each chapter that Piper makes an appearance in. Let's do the math, shall we? Well, there are 56 chapters in the Lost Hero. Now, Jason has two extra chapters at the end. Which means, we divide 54 by the number of POVs, which is 3. We get 18. Multiply eighteen times two and we get thirty-six. However, there are some Piper POV chapters in which Jason does not make an appearance in, therefore not giving her a chance to go on about his looks. Three of them to be exact. 18-3=15. 15*2=30. About thirty times for Piper. Of course, during some of those chapters, Piper doesn't get a chance to look at Jason, but I'm too tired to count all over again. But, roughly, this is how much Piper talks about Jason's looks. Now, for Jason. There are about five chapters in his POV in which Piper does not make an appearance. Twenty chapters in Jason's POV minus five. Fifteen. 15*1.5=22.5 Twenty two point five. That's how many times Jason mentions Piper's looks.<br /><br />That's a lot. Certainly more than Percy and Annabeth. Of course, one might argue that Percy and Annabeth met in different circumstances but I've read Percy Jackson and the staff of Hermes. Percy talked about Annabeth's looks twice. One in the beginning and one near the middle. That's it. No more. And the entire story had forty pages. The Lost Hero had 557 pages and 56 chapters. That equals to about ten pages per chapter. In each chapter of the Lost Hero, Piper would talk about Jason's looks two times. Which means that, in the Staff of Hermes standards, Piper would talk about Jason's looks eight times in the short forty pages. And Jason would talk about Piper's looks six times in the story, compared to Percy's two times for Annabeth. And Percy and Annabeth were actually dating unlike Piper and Jason who liked each other but weren't actually dating. That's shallow. And Piper is convinced she's different from other Aphrodite girls. Please.<br /><br />In TLH, at the campfire, when Drew called out that Jason was handsome and smart and the Aphrodite girls giggled, Piper thought, God, what a bunch of losers. How can she think that when she drooled over him during practically the entire book?<br /><br />Sorry, got really off track there.<br /><br />But yes, she is, once again obsessed with Jason. All she thinks about is him. That's exactly why most of my problems regarding her also regard her relationship with Jason. Because he's really all she thought about.<br /><br />4. She's so fake.<br /><br />Okay, so, somewhere in MoA, Annabeth comments on Piper's hair and how the white feathers braided into it look really nice against her dark hair. And then she goes on to wonder how Piper had time to do that while Annabeth barely had time to brush it.<br /><br />Okay, so Piper, the apparent \\"tomboy\\" has time to freaking braid feathers in her hair? She says that she doesn't care about her looks but yet she does that? She complains about being pretty and that's why her hair is choppy but yet she continually tries to look good?<br /><br />\\"[Piper] rushed to get dressed. By the time she got up on deck, the others had already gathered--all hastily dressed except for Coach Hedge, who had pulled the night watch.<br />Frank's Vancouver Winter Olympics shirt was inside out. Percy wore pajama pants and abronze breastplate, which was an interesting fashion statement. Hazel's hair was all blown to one side as though she'd walked through a cyclone; and Leo had accidentally set himself on fire. His T-shirt was in charred tatters. His arms were smoking.\\"<br /><br />Okay, so Piper, the apparent tomboy out of this group, is the only one who bothers to actually dress herself up? Everyone else rushes upstairs but Piper is the latest one? Come on. I can't believe she still calls herself a tomboy.<br /><br />Since Piper's review is getting too long, I'll quickly summarize the rest of her problems.<br /><br />4. She's hypocritical. She stereotypes all pretty people as mean yet she doesn't want to be stereotyped.<br /><br />5. She's too perfect.<br /><br />Yes, even after all of these flaws I've listed, Piper is still too perfect. Why?<br /><br />Because the Mary-Sue is not judged by the reader, but by the characters. So if I notice her flaws, that doesn't make her a realistic character. But if the other characters notice her flaws and call her out on them, that makes her realistic. But no one notices her flaws. She's simply too perfect that way.<br /><br />Annabeth's pride is called out many times. Thalia's little resistance to power is called out. Percy's pride and rashness is called out. Leo's insecurity and...third-wheel-ness, for lack of a better word, is called out.<br /><br />Get what I'm saying?<br /><br />She was more of a filler character. She didn't contribute to the plot. She was simply there, irritating me by gushing over Jason.<br /><br />I give her a 1.5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />But wait! All is not hopeless for this character. If Uncle Rick makes her more realistic and have someone call her out on her flaws, then she'll be a better character. But for her to be a better person, she needs to be called out on her flaws and try to improve her character. Of course, RR has to be careful to not make her too perfect but in the \\"I have no flaws\\" way this time. He needsto balance her out.<br /><br />Jason - When I first read TLH, I thought he was stealing Percy's thunder. And I hated his guts. But now that I'm more logcial, I understand that he was not really that bad of a character. He was bland, though.<br /><br />In MoA, I'm happy to say that he had more of a personality. He seemed more real. I also liked his budding bromance with Percy.<br /><br />Here are my problems regarding him.<br /><br />1. He didn't even apologize to Reyna.<br /><br />Look, I am not much of a Jason/Reyna shipper. Not anymore. But the fact that he didn't even apologize for leaving her and hurting her feelings...Come on, they were friends. The first thing he directly asks her is if he can show Piper around New Rome.<br /><br />He was a jerk then.<br /><br />2. He ignored his friends.<br /><br />Jason is a Roman. He remembers his friends like Dakota, Gwen, Hazel, Bobby, and Reyna in TLH. But in MoA, he doesn't care about them at all. Come on.<br /><br />3. He states that he's not going back to Camp Jupiter unless Piper comes with him.<br /><br />There are so many things wrong with what he said. First of all, he is a Roman. Camp Jupiter is where he belongs. By stating this, he is implying that the Greeks are better than the Romans. Camp Jupiter is where his friends are. It's where his duties are. He's lived there since he was two. That is his home. And he's going to give all that up for a girl he met a couple of months ago? That's a big, big no-no.<br /><br />That's really all of the problems I have with him. People disliked when he said that Percy needed an ocean to beat him but honestly, I thought that was okay. It was a flaw, was it not? It's his pride acting up. And I was okay with that.<br /><br />I would rate his character 3/5. He was much, much better than in the Lost Hero but the fact that he was a jerk kind of turned him off. But, once again, he was a filler character. He didn't do much. In HoH, I hope to rate him 4/5 or maybe even more.<br /><br/>Hazel - I think Hazel had more of a personality in MoA, even though she didn't have a POV. She had substance, especially during her interactions with Leo. But we saw so little of her. I didn't have any problems with her.<br /><br />I rate her 3.7/5 simply because she was not there too much for me to rate her anymore.<br /><br />Frank - Frank was more of a filler character. He didn't have too much substance to him. I liked his jealousy of Leo, obviously, because he seemed more real. I would give him a 3.3/5.<br /><br />Coach Hedge - This satyr was rather amusing at times. Other times, he was simply there. He didn't contribute to the plot that much. I didn't have any problems with him, really.<br /><br />I give him a 3/5 stars.<br /><br />Reyna - This character...in SoN, I adored her. I gave her 4.6/5 stars which is the highest rating I've given any of Rick's characters. Even though she appeared in 1/10th of SoN, I loved her that much, She just gave me a lasting impression, you know?<br /><br />In MoA, I was breathless.When I read about her, I felt her pain. I was touched by her. She was mysterious and powerful leader but she was also a teenage girl, you know? She was brilliantly written. One of the best characters Rick's ever created. Possibly the best.<br /><br />She was a great leader. She was able to put her emotions side and think about the greater good. She was reasonable, passive, stoic, and just a good person.<br /><br />Problems I have with her:<br /><br />There's nothing, really. Despite the fact that she's getting nothing while Perfect Piper is getting everything, there's really nothing else that I have to complain about this character.<br /><br />She's bossy because she's a Roman leader. She's uptight because she's been through so much and is, once again, Roman.<br /><br />The only reason I can think for someone to dislike her was because she's \\"getting in the way of Jason/Piper and/or Percy/Annabeth.\\" That's the reason most people dislike her. And that's completely illogical.<br /><br />I give her...*drumroll* 4.8/5 stars. That's the highest rating I've ever given any of Rick Riordan's characters.<br /><br />I'm hoping that she has a POV in the next book. And she needs to get a happy ending. My OTP is Reyna/Happiness, got that?<br /><br />Octavian - He has great potential. But he wasn't really an obstacle in MoA. But in HoH, he better have a bigger role. Because I love him. He's so real. He genuinely seems to care about Camp Jupiter. I am currently fangirling because I am imagining the possibilities.<br /><br />I give him a 3.5/5 simply because he didn't play a big role.<br /><br />Arachne - I enjoyed her character. She seemed like the real threat in MoA. However, I feel like Annabeth trapped her too easily. But I enjoyed how her flaws were brought to light and Annabeth used her brain to beat her.<br /><br />4/5 stars for her.<br /><br />Twin Giants - They didn't seem like they were that interesting. They were simply there.<br /><br />3/5 stars.<br /><br />I believe I've reviewed every character of great prominence in MoA.<br /><br />Next up is the plot.<br /><br />Plot: The plot was enjoyable. It tied together quite nicely. Unfortunately, because most of the characters were a little bland, the plot had nothing to bring it to life.<br /><br />Here are some of my problems with it:<br /><br />1. The fight scene between Jason and Percy seemed much too rushed.<br /><br />It was as if Rick wrote it just so it would match the cover. There wasn't any real substance behind it.<br /><br />2. It, at times, seemed like it was dragging on and on. It didn't grasp my attention like I hoped it would. In fact, at one time, I willingly put the book down for a full day and didn't bother reading it. Most of that happened in Piper's and sometimes Percy's chapters.<br /><br />3. The scene between Arachne and Annabeth wasn't as juicy as I had hoped. Annabeth solved the problem much too quickly.<br /><br />4. The eidolon problem was resolved rather quickly and by Piper, no less. It had the potential to become much more complicated but I was rather disappointed when Piper used her charmspeak to make them go away. Granted, they came back eventually but it was a little lacking.<br /><br />All in all, I give the plot 3.5/5.<br /><br />Relationships -<br /><br />Percy/Annabeth - There was an abundance of Percabeth but it was written well so I couldn't bring myself to dislike it. I was a little irritated though. But I enjoyed the relationship a lot.<br /><br />4/5 stars.<br /><br />Jason/Piper - I know that most of you already know how I feel about this relationship. I dislike a lot. And since Piper only talks about Jason during her POV, I started disliking this relationship more and more. Please, please, end this relationship. At least end the shallowness. Do something.<br /><br />1.5/5 stars.<br /><br />Frank/Hazel - This was written well. It wasn't as good as Percabeth but it was nice nonetheless.<br /><br />3.7/5 stars.<br /><br />Leo/Hazel - This was written so well...I just loved it so much. I love how Leo gradually had feelings for Hazel.<br /><br />4/5 stars.<br /><br />Jason/Reyna - This relationship was written horribly, as Jason didn't even bother apologizing to Reyna. Not to mention my anger at Piper getting everything she wants and Reyna getting nothing.<br /><br />1/5 stars.<br /><br />Percy/Reyna - This love triangle was so unnecessary. I had such a wonderful theory that Reyna only implied that she liked Percy because she needed him to be praetor to save the camp but now...*sigh* Okay, RR, TOO MANY LOVE TRIANGLES. Please, fix this.<br /><br />1/5 stars.<br /><br />Annabeth/Reyna - This friendship was written rather well. I enjoyed it a lot. I loved their grudging respect. I can see the possibility of them becoming close friends.<br /><br />4/5 stars.<br /><br />Jason/Percy - This bromance was written well. I could sense undertones of jealousy and am curious to see how their relationship will progress.<br /><br />3.7/4 stars.<br /><br />Annabeth/Piper - This friendship was really annoying. So now we have Insta!Friends along with Insta!Love? It was as if RR was trying to get us to like Piper by having Annabeth like Piper. This relationship sprung out of nowhere.<br /><br />1.2/5 stars.<br /><br />Piper/Leo - I loved the friendship between these two. It seems as if Leo's less insecure when he's with Piper and Piper's less obsessive and more herself when she's with Leo. Brilliant friendship these two have.<br /><br />4/5 stars.<br /><br />Bias<br /><br />It was obvious that RR was favoring the Romans over the Greeks.<br /><br />1. Both Jason and Percy have Greek girlfriends.<br /><br />2. Jason says he won't go back to Camp Jupiter without Piper.<br /><br />3. The Romans are shown to be cruel.<br /><br />4. The only two people who are shown to care a lot for Camp Jupiter is Reyna, who gets nothing, and Octavian, who's portrayed as a selfish and greedy teddy-bear killer.<br /><br />5. Four out of the seven in the prophecy are Greeks.<br /><br />6. Camp Half-Blood's leader, Percy, is shown to be more powerful than Camp Jupiter' leader, Jason. Like when both Nico and Hazel state that Percy is probably the most powerful demigod they've both met.<br /><br />Just stop. Enough with glorifying Percy. He's starting to become a Gary-Stu. Give Jason a fair shot. Stop shoving the Romans and Jason under a bus.<br /><br />I hope Uncle Rick gives the Romans a chance to shine in HoH. But then again, it says House of HADES. Which means that two of the titles have to do with Greek gods/goddesses and only one has to do with a Roman god/goddess. And even then, Neptune is really referring to Poseidon. :(<br /><br />I actually prefer the Romans more than the Greeks. I don't know why. But I'm praying that all of the POVs in the next book are Romans.<br /><br />I'm hoping for Jason, Frank, Hazel, and Reyna. Or maybe Octavian. No Greeks. I don't even want Percy. LET THE ROMANSGET THEIR TURN TO SHINE.<br /><br />Gods, that took a long time to finish. So this is my review of MoA. Critical? Yes. Untrue? No.<br /><br />For the entire book, I give it a 3/5 stars.<br /><br />I hope HoH is better. I hope that I can rate it a four out of five.<br /><br />As my fingers hurt from typing and I have a test to take, I better get going.<br /><br />KUDOS TO YOU IF YOU READ ALL OF THIS!

B004UXUX4Q|1.0|\\"The Descendants\\" is to great movies what packaged rice cakes are to fine dining.<br />With that said, I have to admit that this is a well-crafted film.  And because of its locale (Hawaii), visually interesting, too.  The acting is brilliant, as well.  Especially George Clooney in what had to be a challenging role.  I mean, he plays completely against the grain of what he really is: a handsome, confident movie actor.  And pulls it off magnificently.<br />The reason I so disliked this film, I think, is because I've seen one too many movies about angst.  Or, I should say more specifically, angst in characters I don't give a rat's patootie about.<br />Clooney plays an oblivious real estate attorney -- really more dork-like, I think, than oblivious -- whose family life disintegrated because of his habitual inability to see what really has been going on.  We're given to believe that he's been utterly clueless as to what his wife and kids have thought, needed and felt.  All because he was too absorbed in his \\"fascinating\\" law practice.  Or something.<br />Woven into that \\"melodrama\\" then, is also his status as the administrator of his huge family's (seemingly a hundred cousins) extensive island land holdings.  All of which seems comprised of the last of Hawaii's prime undeveloped real estate (and worth approaching a billion).  Which, naturally, his countless cousins start squabbling over when legal technicalities are about to force a liquidation.<br />Anyway, I just couldn't begin to care what happened to any character in \\"The Descendants.\\"  At its ending, had Clooney been washed out to sea by a tsunami, my reaction would likely have been, \\"Oh... that's one way to end it, I guess.\\"<br />In all fairness, this film deserves more than a single star (just on the acting alone).  But  because of my antipathy towards films featuring shallow, boring, self-absorbed characters, I'm going to go with my bias and rate it as I have.  I just couldn't get interested in people who had less  depth than a toddler's wading pool.

B001BZRUR4|4.0|With the follow-up novel to [[ASIN:0375842209 The Book Thief]], author Markus Zusak faced a big challenge: Could he match the perfect of \\"The Book Thief\\"?<br /><br />\\"I Am the Messenger\\" tells of the tale of 19-year-old cabbie and washout Ed Kennedy. The novel begins with Ed accidentally foiling a bank robbery, which results in some excellent publicity in the local press. In the wake of his moment of glory, Ed, an inveterate card player, receives some playing cards in the mail with the addresses of people Ed is supposed to help. Ed's father died an alcoholic; his mother is a nagging harpy; his siblings pretty much ignore him; his only real friend is a smelly dog named The Doorman. How can Ed possibly help anyone else? And who is instigating these \\"good deeds\\"?<br /><br />As in \\"The Book Thief,\\" the layout is inventive and the prose lapses into the poetic and philosophical. Is heroism born, or made? Does fate decree our destiny, or do we have free will? What is love? Don't get the wrong idea: The novel's a suspenseful and imaginative read. As in \\"The Book Thief,\\" \\"I Am the Messenger\\" both unfolds a riveting story and delves into important questions.<br /><br />Is the novel as good as \\"The Book Thief\\"? No, but it's still a great, philosophical read.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|Mark Owen's account of the Navy SEAL raid on a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan and the killing of Osama bin Laden is a powerful, must-read account. In spite of the uproar over whether Owen's book violated secrecy laws and that trust of the U.S. Government and military, it's a gem of an autobiography that anyone, from SEAL fans to those who want to know the truth about OBL's killing should read.<br /><br />Given the amount of media leakage that occurred following the raid, including revelations of the SEAL's involvement hours after the attack and identification of the author's real name in the media, it's understandable why Owen wanted to set the record straight after watching news outlets spin fanciful stories of what happened. The uproar against a retired SEAL who legally vetted the text for sensitive information is hypocritical given that no public action has been taken against anyone currently in uniform or serving in the administration who have leaked far more revealing information about the decade-long pursuit of OBL.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this book and give it high marks -- 5 stars. Better the truth from one who was there than the spin provided by the administration, by Hollywood through movies such as the upcoming \\"Zero Dark Thirty,\\" or the media's talking heads. That Owen tried to honor his fellow SEALs who put their lives on the line without the recognition they deserve day in and day out and is donating proceeds from the book to charities that support SEAL families is an added bonus.

Rather it makes sense to eliminate \\"dense\\" forms of carbs like most grains and some sugars. However eliminating fruit is silly too, since the sugars in fruit is fructose, which does not spike an insulin response because it's processed slowly in our livers. You HAVE TO have sugars in your liver to feed your brain (which runs 100% on blood sugar).
B0098VYKSA|4.0|Very good movie. Charlieze does another outstanding performance! The story is quite good too. Very good CG FX.  Overall very well done.
B0086UXYZO|5.0|I love the Vaccines and this CD does not disappoint! I've been listening to it constantly since it arrived. I can't wait to see them in concert.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Not the happy ending most people are looking for, but it's life. It's  how the real world works. <br /><br />I feel like most of this book was slow paste, not too much of a page flipper until the end of part two. solid ending to the trilogy. <br /> <br />P.s. i thought these were reviews. not spoiler reviews.
B004P4S4NM|5.0|This has got to be one of the best albums I have purchased in a long time. This gal has a hellofa great voice and I expect it to only get better and better as she matures.
1451673442|5.0|Good interactive book. Makes you really feel the gratitude in your life. You evaluate how you live the beautiful life you were given.
B004LTC15I|5.0|I discovered this album in a hard and demanding a lot period in my life... I found support, energy, inspiration, strenght and a lot of compassion in the lyrics... the music of the ballads is enchanting...<br />Cantame Tu Vida together with No Te Miento and Sera, Sera are my favorites...<br />I love the deep meaning of \\"The Best Thing About Me is You\\" worths listening beyond the text...<br />Enjoy!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I liked the hints when I got stuck. I didn't have to go and look for a walkthrough. I also think I got a lot of game for my money.
0062127241|5.0|I am reading \\"Who am I\\" by Pete Townsend. It is liking catching up with the older brother I always wished I had. If you are at all a Who fan, you have to read this book. He explains what the \\"Magic Bus\\" is and who the song \\"I'm a Sensation\\" is about. I have read half of the book this weekend. Thanks Pete.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|In a nutshell the three books was awesome read. I couldn't put down the books and read it whenever I had free time. I finished all three books in 2 weeks. The storyline was awesome. It gave you this awesome feeling of that moment of falling in love with that special person.  The drama that went along with the love story also kept you on your feet.  I can't wait to see movie.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Every American should read this book!  We are blessed to have incredibly well trained, committed and patriotic men and women serving this country.  The dedication and level of expertise that these soldiers and supporting individuals had to hunt down Bin Laden was extraordinary.  This is not a political read.  However, this chapter in American history will be recited along with the other formidable military exercises.  The first part of the book sets up the story and as you move towards the execution of the mission, you are unable to put the book down.  Although the book was published amist controversy as to whether it violated any regulations, it is a story that needed to be told.  There was too much speculation and fiction as to what happened.  As Americans, we needed to know about the most important take down in American history.  It is no ordinary book!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This second book is soooooo much better than the first one.<br />I think 5 stars is not enough to rate such a great book.<br /><br />Im inlove with this series and cant wait for book 3 to come out.
B007PFD90G|5.0|I haven't read The Satanic Verses or even Midnight's Children but when I read excerpts of Joseph Anton, A Memoir in The New Yorker, I was intrigued. I purchased the book. I was immediately hooked. Rushdie's writing is precise, insightful, intelligent. The economy of his language, its restraint, is enviable. Despite the occasionally annoying name-dropping, one can see the author's efforts to be fair and balanced, and give an objective account of his years of living in forced hiding (or at least as objective as an account of something so personal can ever be). Ultimately, this book isn't just about Rushdie, it's about freedom and reason free of passion.
B00026WU82|4.0|Highway 61 Revisited is a landmark album. You can listen to the songs 10 times and each time get a slightly different perspective. Lyrics that may cause a brain blister suddenly become a soothing mental musical ointment. The songs are timeless because your interpretations of what you are hearing change over time. What seem to be non-sensical lyrics suddenly come into focus and you are transported into an understanding. I have never heard any other music that can do that. My favorite Dylan album is Blonde on Blonde, but this one is something special. It can be hard to define the music of Bob Dylan. But it is a pleasant journey trying to.
1452110581|4.0|Funniest book!  I purchased two for gifts for cat lovers.  It is so funny because its all so true!<br /><br />It is a great collection of poems and the pictures are very cute.

B009GEAPYW|5.0|Any lover of batman will greatly enjoy this adaptation of the comic.  It stays fairly true to the original, and it only take a few liberties to update certain things from the comic to make them more modern.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|to get hearts you have to spend from 1 to 20 dollars! but I think its still coolly anyway though
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I loved this game, and can 't believe the price was so low!  It will keep you going for quite a while.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Very good quality headset worked over 50 feet through 4 walls.  Also with the battery life I get around 11 hours of total talk time before it starts to beep at me to recharge it within the next 15 minutes.  Voice changer is cool but not really what I was interested in.  The quality of audio with this headset input and output it in my opinion close to the quality of my logitech surround sound setup which I am very pleased with.  The bass is also quite responsive when playing various games.  Definitely worth the money.
B008PE9GSA|5.0|I have to say as a fan of 35 plus years It is great to have a new album with the same great sound of the 70's.As far as my favorite track's I like 1,4,5 but all are great if you are a true fan you will like this album.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest and now having it to go on my kindle fire is sweet. The program runs smoothly except for the occasional forced shut down but overall super nice to have it at my fingertips.
1476715904|4.0|The book is named after a type of poetry reading; I was very delighted to discover that this book is an in-depth look into responsibility and love. And, at first I thought the story was just for the teenage set, but after reading it, there was more to it.  A young girl of just 18 finds that her world is falling apart with the death of her father and a forced move to another state. She finds that not only the day-to-day living, but also the family's future falls upon her young shoulders for her brother and her mother.  In Layken's new neighborhood, she meets Will, who has a passion for poetry, is a little older than she, and is guardian for his younger brother.  It's a strong attraction between them, but soon they learn it is wrong.  The story unravels and you are looking to read the next book to see how Layken and Will work out all the challenges that befalls them.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I LOVE this app! even though I cant take pics on my kindle it still tells me how much time is left. Speaking of time I also love how it tells you how long you can do things! I would totally recommend this app.

B008G8SFGO|2.0|You can't deny KISS.  They are everywhere.  They are a worldwide brand.  Countless musicians and entertainers have been inspired by this band.  The classic music, to many fans, is the soundtrack to their lives.<br /><br />Now, you have Monster.  I'm a die-hard fan, so I am very conflicted by this band these days.  Monster is just average at best.  The songs run into each other and nothing stands out as anything I would want to hear repeatedly.  In fact, the low-lights are the memorable parts.  The awful acapella intro to Eat Your Heart Out is laughable.  Come on guys.  Don't ever do that again.  Gene's ridiculous speaking parts in songs.  \\"I like it.\\"  Well, I don't, Gene.  You sound more contrived than ever.<br /><br />I'm going to review this by band member rather than song just to be different.<br /><br />Paul Stanley:  The best front-man ever?  Could be.  One of the most underrated rhythm guitarists of all time?  Definitely.  His voice is still strong on this album.  I would honestly prefer a KISS album voiced entirely by Paul.  He's still solid and he's the standout on Monster.<br /><br />Tommy Thayer:  Nothing this guy can do to ever get out of Ace Frehley's shadow.  Ace is still just better than him.  Ace brought an edge to the band that Tommy can only copy...poorly.  His guitar style is so similar to Ace that it's a bit embarrassing at times.  His lone song is another \\"hey, did you know I'm the Spaceman?\\" song, and it's just not very good.<br /><br />Eric Singer:  I think Eric is the best drummer KISS has ever had, talent-wise.  Again, like Tommy, Eric is just in the shadow of Peter Criss - never to escape.  His voice is eerily similar to Peter's.  I can't get past the clone factor to believe in him as the \\"Catman.\\"  Peter is the Catman.<br /><br />Gene Simmons:  Gene.  Can't blame him for his ego given the success.  However, his songs, as usual, are the worst on the album.  Plodding, boring, \\"I'm the demon, devil, caveman, blah-blah-blah.\\"  In makeup thesedays, he looks ridiculous.  Bloated face, mugging in the camera, nothing feels genuine about him anymore.<br /><br />No songs from Monster should be played live.  Stick to the classics.  Get the classic lineup together for a few more shows and hang it up.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|amazing! get this app  watch the videos  you will be changed  Ted videos cover a wide range of topics. never boring.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|THE FILM HAS GREAT PHOTOGRAPHY. IT SHOWS AUSTRALIA IN ALL ITS VASTNESS. THE PLOT IS CAPTIVATING AND VERY MOVING. THE DRIVE THAT IMPULSED OUR SETTLERS OF THE WEST CAN BE SEEN REVEALED HERE AS WELL. I BELIEVE THAT WOMEN WILL ENJOY THIS MOVIE AND MEN WILL FALL IN LOVE WITH THE HEROINE.

B004HUE57S|4.0|I bought this mouse 2 years ago. I was having pain in my hand from working on a computer all day. I wasn't sure I wanted to spend so much on a mouse that might not alleviate my pain. Ultimately I decide to take a chance on this product and I'm glad I did. Setup was easy. I simply plugged the usb cord into the computer. The mouse comes with an installation disc, however since I don't have administrative rights at work I decided not to bother installing it. Works just fine without installing the program.<br /><br />I also adjusted to using it very quickly. It works just like a regular mouse, but instead of having your hand resting horizontally it is now at a hand shake position. I really love this mouse the pain in my right hand went away after a couple days of using it. I never want to go back to using a regular mouse.<br /><br />The only minor complaint I have is that the chrome paint rubs off after extended use. That's not a big issue for me. I plan on purchasing this product again once my current mouse breaks. It's holding up well except for the chrome paint coming off and some minor scratches on the rubber grip.<br /><br />One more thing I'd like to mention. This mouse isn't really intended to be picked up. If you're accustomed to lifting the mouse once it gets close to the edge of your mouse pad you may have a problem. By that I mean in order to pick it up your entire hand has to grip the mouse, which I imagine could get tiresome after a while.  This hasn't been an issue for me, however if you're doing drafting or design work you should take it into consideration. I suppose you could just work with out a mouse pad.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this product.

B003VANOFY|5.0|I bought this headset a few weeks ago now. I am 100% satisfied with them. The audio is AMAZING every thing sounds better. Youtube, Music, Games, Skype, Movies they all sound crisp and clear. The wireless distance is amazing. I love being able to sit in my living room and be on Skype at the same time. The batter life span is AMAZING I don't have to charge the things that often at all.  They were worth every penny. I highly recommend them.
B0083GQKQG|1.0|From the very start of the movie we know that something bad is going to happen involving Kevin. The movie is just one large build up and it feels as if the climax will never happen. The constant back and forth between past and present was really annoying. I'd say watch this movie if you're into creepy kids and a long drawn out story.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|I do so love a good murder mystery..Throw in an NYPD detective and one sexy reporter and you have magic. I love the show and now I'm hooked on the books! Off to read book 2!!

159420411X|1.0|I wanted to like this book.  But Nate Silver gives a detailed discussion of the stock market that tries to defend the efficient market hypothesis.  And his defense is based on entirely talks with professors at the University of Chicago that came up with that theory.  He gives no mention to the greatest investor of all time, Warren Buffett, or that his entire group of investors that studied at the foot of Ben Graham all had significant outperformance against the stock market for several decades each with their own take on value investing.<br /><br />In addition Silver mentions that Option Trading is way too risky, demonstrating a complete lack of knowledge of the subject.  Option investing, when done correctly, allows significant risk/reward accomplished with many strategies that have much lower risks than just buying a stock.  These include Vertical Credit Spreads, Vertical Debit Spreads, Diagonal Spreads, Butterfly's, and even in the money generic calls and puts.  It's obvious Silver has never been exposed to these ideas, let alone understands them enough to make such a comment.<br /><br />Finally Silver rejects technical analysis because it's difficult to tell the difference between some real charts and some charts that were used by a computer flipping a coin.  For one hasn't he heard of \\"Garbage in, Garbage out\\", so really this is no different than giving a statistician poll numbers by a random number generator within some would be reasonable parameters.  And secondly, isn't it possible there is more than one way for market technicians to look at a stock than just one kind of chart.<br /><br />The other parts of the book seem authentic and interesting.  But if I can find such obvious flaws in areas where I have an expertise, then I have trouble trusting the rest of his thoughts on areas where I do not.
B0090X4GJE|5.0|This album is amazing! The songs are beautiful and melodic. The lyrics are strong and the music is great. I have been listening to it non-stop (for the whole 5 days that it has been out)!

B006LSZECO|3.0|It was just okay as I didn't like the ending leaving you up in the air where they were going.
B007THA4FI|2.0|Throughout the book you continued to hope it would improve, that something would occur to spark your interest.  This never occured.  The were no likeable characters, no one to cheer on, and in actuality just remained a very depressing book.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I thought it was a really cool app but now I am thinking about it first it was telling me it was at 20% then 30% (it was not pluged in!) now it is 30% and 40%. Maybe it's my tablet but it keeps doing it. Other than that it is the COOLEST battery app as I'm writing it's telling me what my battery % is. ( every so often you can turn it off or select what % it will tell you) It shows you a graph of what your battery life was and is. It tells you what your battery life is if you do certain things like 3D games and 2D games I can check my notifacations and I have It tell me how long my games will last. If you think it is awesome at first glance wait till you play with the settings!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Enjoyed reading this one just as much as the first one....now onto book 3...I hope the next movies are just as good

B0081KTI0E|1.0|I really wanted to love this movie! I saw Daniel R. on the Graham Norton show promoting this movie, and Daniel seems Soo like-able. I was really rooting for him & the film ... But omg YAWN... such a sluggish film... slow starting and slow first hour. Seemed to me like a bunch of climactic music and dark corners and candle lights, all building up too... (wait for it) NOthing! Just my opinion.
B003WKOU0G|1.0|super boring movie. no narration at all makes all the footage seem pointless & disconnected. wouldn't recommend this to anyone & wish we hadn't rented it. couldn't even finish it.
B0087DFIOU|4.0|Mel Gibson is back in action. In \\"Get the Gringo\\" (also titled as \\"How I Spent My Summer Vacation\\") Gibson plays a hardened criminal (credited only as Driver) with stolen money. While running away from the law, the \\"driver\\" literally jumps across the Mexican border and ends up being caught and sent to El Pueblito, a real-life prison that looks more like a sort of a small town.<br /><br />There, while learning how to survive the chaotic community rife with corruption and violence, Mel Gibson's \\"Driver\\" befriends a ten-year-old cigarette-smoking boy (Kevin Hernandez) and his upright mother (Dolores Heredia). The Driver soon finds that tough and street-smart as he is, the boy needs protection from the gangsters, which the Driver provides. But that means mixing up with the Mexican mobsters as well as American ones.<br /><br />The premise sounds interesting, but don't expect Elmore Leonard. Characters, especially the criminals, are caricatures, not given personalities enough distinct to tell one from another. Still the film is entertaining with its dry humor, which comes mostly from our enigmatic hero Mel Gibson plays with a grim face. His character's story itself is not really as interesting as it should, but watching him play the man with understated humor is fun.<br /><br />\\"Get the Gringo\\" has a car chase, bloody shoot-outs and explosions. They are all competently done, and so is the set of El Pueblito, but it is Mel Gibson's strong performance as the mysterious driver that carries the entire film.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great way to pass the time on a rainy dau. lots of variety for kids of different ages as well. mine have had a great time
B008IYR2BA|5.0|A few years ago when I had Sho Time I saw an episode of Dexter in the middle of a season and did not like it. I couldn't figure out why they were making a hero out of a serial killer or who the guy that kept popping in that he called his dad when his dad was dead. Later on when I could watch the complete series from the very beginning it all made sense. He only kills people that really need killing. I have seen seasons 1-5 twice and never tire of them. The actors do an excellent job.
B005S9ELQ2|5.0|\\"Argo\\" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: The true story of the life-or-death covert operation to rescue six Americans, which unfolded behind the scenes of the Iran hostage crisis--the truth of which was unknown by the public for decades.<br /><br />The cast led by Ben Affleck (also produced and directed) (as Tony Mendez), Bryan Cranston (as Jack O'Connell), Alan Arkin (as Lester Siegel) & John Goodman (as John Chambers) is brilliant. The (Oscar-winning) screenplay by Chris Terrio (based on the article \\"Escape From Tehran\\" by Joshuah Bearman) is brilliant.<br /><br />The music by Alexandre Desplat is brilliant. The cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto is brilliant. The (Oscar-winning) film editing by William Goldenberg is brilliant. The casting by Lora Kennedy is brilliant. The production design by Sharon Seymour is brilliant. The art direction by Peter Borck & Deniz Gokturk is brilliant. The set decoration by Jan Pascale, set dressings by Michael Keith Aleshire-Rezendez, Doug Devine, Justin Freibrun, Selin Gungor, Mark Kwiatkowski, Gordon McVay, Cynthia C. Rebman & Michael A. Watt, set designs by Daniel R. Jennings & Barbara Mesney is brilliant. The costume design by Jacqueline West is brilliant. The visual effects supervised by Matt Dessero, Bryan Godwin, Lubo Hristov, Don Lee, Gregory L. McMurry & Thomas J. Smith, coordinated by Lauren Guerard, Rachel Faith Hanson, Shane Strickman & Mark Van Ee is brilliant. The special effects coordinated by Barry McQueary is brilliant. The stunts coordinated by Gary Hymes, Mark Henson & J.J. Perry is brilliant.<br /><br />This is a brilliant and well-made, well-acted film that is entertaining. This is another true story tale that has been done (filmed) well. This is another brilliant movie from Ben Affleck, right in league with \\"Gone Baby Gone\\" & \\"The Town\\". He also leads a well-acted ensemble, filled out with solid performances by Cranston, Arkin & Goodman, also Affleck himself, too. This is one of the best films of the fall season and of the year, with Oscar consideration talk on the plate. And it was, of course, the Oscar winner for Best Picture of the Year.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The basic plot is a well done 'did he do it?'. The reader will vacillate on their feelings of guilt and victimization. Though the story gets deeper as the plot unfolds, my interest in the main characters got less. I was never able to develop any real connection to Nick or Amy. Either good or evil, usually there is some connect that keeps your interest. I wanted justice to be done, but I never cared about Nick or Amy. Good story, very interesting plot, not very interesting people.

B008XX6J4C|5.0|Usually I only find a few songs on a CD that really make it worth the buy, but with this CD I love the entire CD. I have about three favorite songs. Song number 8 ~ Moonlight, has been stuck on repeat since I listened to the CD twice through. I think I love that piece more than Code Name Vivaldi, which is actually ironic since that is the song I bought the CD for in the first place. The music is beautiful, the composing is moving. That's what I look for in music, something I can feel when I listen to it--the passion of the piece being played and the dedication of the musician to draw the audience into each piece and take them beyond the present moment. So for me, this was one of the best CDs I have bought all year.

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read in years. I'm not a gamer and haven't played computer games in years, but I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The characters are great, the book is action-packed and the story line is thoroughly developed. Mr Cline has done a wonderful job researching all the little tidbits of 80's nerdiness from computer games, to music, tv and movies. I highly recommend this book to any fan of sci-fi.
B001NXDIMK|5.0|The episodes are each very exciting and leave one compelled to watch the next.  My husband and I watch one per night and look forward to seeing how things move forward in the next episode.  The twists and turns are complex and only resolve in tiny steps in each episode, so that one learns an answer and is drawn into another question each viewing.  The acting is superb, but then one would expect that from such a caste.  Meryl Streep is bone-chilling and real at the same time.
0316228532|4.0|Poverty.  Addiction.  Racism.  Abuse.  Alienation between spouses, and between children and parents.  These are some of the issues J. K. Rowling writes about in \\"The Casual Vacancy\\", her first novel intended for an adult audience. And these are real-world issues even harder to overcome than Voldemort.<br /><br />The novel centers on the seemingly bucolic small English town of Pagford, whose prettiness lies mostly on the surface. Her characters  come from all classes of society, something I like in novels, and \\"The Casual Vacancy\\" explores the ways in which these very different characters interact and affect one another.<br /><br />The book begins with the death of Barry Fairbrother, one of the leaders of the parish council. The election to fill the vacancy left by his death brings to the forefront many of the tensions simmering in Pagford.  Some of the reviewers have mentioned that the people populating Pagford just aren't very likeable. By and large, this is true, but Rowling does an excellent job giving us insight into these characters and making them very real and understandable to the reader. I was reminded of a quote I once read. Unfortunately, I can't remember it exactly or give credit to the author, but the gist of it was that everyone, if we could see their privates thoughts, would seem like monsters. Well, Rowling lets us see inside her characters' heads. We see them in their pettiness, their jealousies and insecurities, their self-absorption and their delusions, and their delight in malicious gossip. But some of the characters, flawed though they may be, do try to do their best. When another major event occurs late in the novel, we  see that while some people remain unchanged and just as nasty as ever, others are capable of changing and growing for the better, giving the novel at least a slightly hopeful feel.<br /><br />I was thoroughly absorbed by \\"The Casual Vacancy\\", and I'm glad I wasn't dissuaded from reading it by negative reviews. I really admire Rowling for having the guts to write something so totally different from the Harry Potter books. I hope she continues to be true to herself and write what she wants.  I for one appreciate her efforts and I'll look forward to what she comes up with next.owling for having the guts to write something so totally different from the Harry Potter books.

B007FG9LIE|5.0|No regrets with this purchase.  I thought the plot and development were novel and unpredictable.  Some of the writing was not as polished as some but the story kept me turning pages.  My wife would want to turn the lights off to go to sleep but I could not stop reading. Family peace was only restored after I finished this book.  Looking forward to reading more of Mr. Crouch's books.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Great time at the movies- fun, funny, witty, a little sexy and totally worth it. I am to a person to laugh out loud, and it did that several times. I bought the soundtrack right after the movie- and it is great too. There are some parts of the movie that could have gotten bogged down in histrionics, but didn't, and some parts that could have gotten vulgar, but didn't. Nicely edited, well written and just a really good time.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I had the Weather Channel app and loved that, but suddenly it quit working with my Kindle, which sucked because I always have my Kindle next to my bed and would check the weather first thing each morning. I tried a couple of other apps, but they didn't have hourly or long-range forcasts. This one has daily weather in 3-hour increments (not quite what the Weather Channel had) and a 15-day forecast (which is better than the Weather Channel app). Most importantly,  it's specifically for Kindle Fire, so it works. The problem I had with the Weather Channel app was that it quit updating automatically - I would have to reboot each time I wanted to check the weather. No problems like that with this app. It also has some nice graphics. I'm very pleased with it.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Worth the read, even for an adult, story held my interest for all three books in the series and is well written with good character development and plot.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I don't usually write negative reviews, but this is the most boring bit of erotica I've ever attempted to read - I couldn't finish it.  I'm amazed that it's a best-seller when there are so many great bodice rippers out there.  Not to mention the paranormal fantasy writers like J.R. Ward who does such a lovely job of incorporating erotica into a satisfying (if formulaic)story line.
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|As the movie starts a giant pale alien stands upon the Earth as he watches a large spacecraft hovering and beginning to leave him behind. He drinks a potion out of a sealed vessel. His body begins to disintegrate and he falls into the flowing water of a waterfall as his DNA dissolves and seeds the Earth for human life.<br /><br />Flash forward to 2089 where scientists find a cave in Scotland with ancient cave paintings showing people worshiping a giant alien who is pointing to a star cluster painted on the ceiling of the cave. It is the same star cluster as painted in numerous cave paintings found around the world and made by civilizations separated by thousands of miles and thousands of years. Is it an invitation to come visit the home world of the race that created mankind?<br /><br />In 2093 Prometheus is nearing the end of its journey to find the source of the alien message. It is 200 trillion miles from earth and its crew of 17 is awakened by the ship's systems and the on board robot who has cared for the ship during their sleep. Will they find the clues about the origins of mankind or unlock Pandora's Box....<br /><br />This movie is touted as a prequel to the Alien series of movies. It has a great story line and a good cast so the movie had a lot of potential. I wind up rating it as a 4 star film but it was somewhere between a 3 and a 4 star movie. The special effects were very good and the acting was also above average. What lowered the movie in my opinion was the silliness of the script and the actions of the characters.<br /><br />If you were to write down the 10 to 15 things that any intelligent person would not do in the event of an alien encounter while on another planet and watch this movie then you would see them do every one of them in about 2 hours. What is it with Hollywood that makes them think that having characters behave like this is entertaining?<br /><br />This movie had the potential to be a 5 star movie as the premise was excellent. The execution of the characters behavior was just outlandishly silly. I will not list the flaws of the movie here because it would expose too much of the details of the film but to me it dropped the films rating. I gave it a 3 star rating and my wife gave it a 4. Since my feeling was between a 3 and a 4 star I compromised to a 4 star.<br /><br />The movie is reasonably entertaining it just is not spectacular in its production. It is now where near as scary, entertaining or suspenseful as the first Alien movie with Sigourney Weaver. It had the same potential but poor script writing made you just wish that some of the characters would die because they deserved to for being stupid.<br /><br />It is worth while watching but don't expect a classic that will receive top notch reviews from everyone who sees it.cution of the characters behavior was just outlandishly silly.

1476712042|5.0|Reviewed by Lee Anne for My Secret Romance Book Reviews<br />This book was provided by the author/publisher in return for an honest review.<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster is a wonderful name for this story as it fits it perfectly! Abby Abernathy is trying to start over where no one knows her. She wants nothing more than to escape her father and her past. When she meets Travis at college,she takes an instant dislike to him as he represents everything she's trying to get away from.<br /><br />Overtime they become best friends. They do everything together. Abby can't imagine her life without Travis in it and he can't imagine his life without her. They finally decide to take their relationship to the next level, more than friends.And what a beautiful disaster that turns out to be!<br /><br />This is a wonderful story about two people who are so in love with each other but can't admit it to themselves. Travis is messed up and has so many emotional problems.Abby wants a chance at normalcy and Travis is anything but normal.<br /><br />I found myself crying through this book and had to keep wiping the tears out of my eyes. I was touched and moved by their story. They both kept making mistake sand hurting each other. It was killing me to watch them, while at the same time I had to keep reading to see if they would ever work it out.<br /><br />Abby is a wonderful character that is weak when it comes to having Travis in her life but strong about not taking any crap from him. Travis has a reputation and no one sees the real Travis, except for Abby. She sees Travis for who and what he is. She accepts him for everything he is. While she does see the real Travis and accepts him for what he is, she's no doormat who just puts up with anything. She pushes back at him and has a take no prisoners attitude.<br /><br />Their HEA was wonderful. While the ending was not a complete surprise to me, I was extremely pleased with it. I just found out some wonderful news. Ms. McGuire is releasing a second story and it is supposed to be from Travis's Point of View! I'm so excited about this!a second story and it is supposed to be from Travis's Point of View! I'm so excited about this!

B008Y2FRFO|3.0|its just ok because its kind of hard not to waste coins because you don't start out with many coins and you need a lot of coins to play this game. when you run out you either have to wait and it will give you more coins or you have to buy them with REAL money.
B0053O89KG|5.0|This season of Castle will not disappoint.  From the quick banter back and forth between Ryan and Esposito to the obvious tension between Castle and Beckett you will not be disappointed and you will only want more!
B00846REIS|5.0|Very good read I could not put it down. It wasn't a typical rich guy falls for poor girl the story was very well put together.  I also read the.second book and can not wait for the third one to be released.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Super engaging,  and well written.  Loved it.  There is a lot of wit and humanity in the writing,  and this really helps sell the fiction in this science fiction.<br />This is the best kindle deal I've ever had -  I'd have paid $10  for this book.
