B001KPYNR0|5.0|Love this album. Download experience was fine, once I realized I needed to do the upgrade my phone was prompting me to do.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This is a very addictive game and fab to play when your head needs to free- wheel. Don't take my word for it.Give it a go!
1401322786|4.0|Read this on a flight to Florida over Christmas. It proved to be a great use of my time. Ready to read more by Mitch Albom.
B001NHNG64|3.0|Entertaining book, but the ending is nowhere as strong as the first chapters. The ending is frankly implausible, and though it is still pretty exciting, it does not match the strong beginning...which has been the pattern with all of the first three Reacher books I have read.
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|It is great that I can still get the memory card that I need to use my camera.  I got the product quickly and I am very happy.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|It keeps her entertained. The challenges are occasionally tricky but entertaining. I am not certain how long this would entertain an adult, but its perfect for a child.
B0051XJ9YE|5.0|they are good diecast cars. Thay are fun for the kids, and most definatly worth what I payed for them
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Even though I have had some trouble following the characters through the family time line I have enjoyed the ride and am anxious for Book Three to come out.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My son and I loved this version of angry birds. We work together to destroy the &#34;pigs&#34; or &#34;darth-pig&#34;. Lol
B007HC3LHS|4.0|Well written, enjoyed the old past and newer past melding into the present.  It held my interest, didn't want it to end so quickly.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is such a thriller! Collins really keeps you going until the very end. I can't wait to read the next one!
B007SGLZP8|2.0|Not up to John Grisham standards. I couldn't care about the characters and didn't find the end twist worth waiting for.
B008NEMPTO|5.0|I bought this for my wife for Christmas. It is very entertaining. Amazon shipped the movie quickly and it arrived in perfect condition. I would recommend this movie to others along with the price and availability from Amazon.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|As always a good read from DeMille.  Love his characters sarcastic humor.  Left open the possibility for another follow up story.
B0085Z8F4A|3.0|The movie is interesting, but the 3D did not work properly. It faded in and out every second or so. I would recommend the movie, but not the 3D version.
B006RUJST6|5.0|This book taught me so much. I've read it twice and it never ever gets old. A amazing book. A+
B008FSCNTK|5.0|after not knowing much about this artists abilities I understand now why she is so captivating enter music so entertaining
B008XG1X18|4.0|Pinterest is working just fine. Except when you pin something it takes a while to get back to previous screen. Also little slow with the scrolling.
B00723NWJE|5.0|this CD provides much enjoyment and entertainment in a very mellow yet exciting manner. her voice is wonderful and the music is wonderful
B0094BB4TW|1.0|It only loads one hour worth of news feed. No settings to change that. Pictures are way too big, taking up the entire screen
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Is the best saga for me, y looked this movies when i was a kid, always want every thing about this saga like toys, or stuffs but nevers has a good quality in the movies in my house, now i have it this blurays, and im happy for this, i make a &#34;marathos&#34; in a weekend watching this saga in this quality and well well well... very well. the best rating for this product.<br />Regards
B004QBWU02|5.0|we have been looking for this movie for my husband the copy he had on vhs cannot be found and he was excited to get this for Christmas  thank you
1932735410|5.0|This is my gif for my girlfriend, she want to become a pmp certified, this is very helpful to her. the book is in ok state, the tasks, the larg of font, the graphs, and so on is OK
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|Plotless and nonsensical story with mediocre acting and inferior filming stye produces and event that is nearly a complete bore
6305558167|5.0|Pre-cgi excellence. A must for all kids when they discover knights and such. This looks more real than any contemporary movie because it is!
B000VNMMQG|5.0|A wonderful movie that shows how a great song came from the history of slavery in America. This makes the movie and song both bitter sweet. A must see for those who love history!
B000002JEV|5.0|An incredible assembly of live Zep tunes that are not readily available elsewhere. Traveling Riverside Blues and The Girl I Love She Got Long Black Wavy Hair are exceptional songs you won't hear elsewhere that are fantastic blues  numbers that illustrate where Zep came from in the early days.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|The best Marvel movie of them all ... even better than the superb &#34;Iron Man&#34;, &#34;Thor&#34;, and  &#34;Capt. America&#34;  films ...<br /><br />&#34;Avengers&#34; puts the &#34;Batman&#34; franchise to shame ... I cannot wait for &#34;Avengers-2&#34; to come out in 2014 !!
B001K3ENEA|5.0|These offer comfort & great sound at a great price. The long cable that's one one side makes them great for home studio recording as well as private listening that's a major improvement over ear buds.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|The tension is palpable from the beginning of Margeret's and John's first meeting. The passion that ignites is even more intense. I have watch it three times since receiving it.
B0063IH60K|2.0|This one figured out how to make the ads maximally intrusive. When they finally got to the point of expecting me to watch a full-video ad to play a game of freaking solitaire, it got deleted. Pity. It wasn't a bad app and the owners could have made a decent living with less obtrusive ads. Pigs eat, hogs get slaughtered.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|If you are looking for a read that is simple yet entertaining this will work. That being said I wouldn't buy it but it is pretty good as a free download.
034580404X|5.0|The packaging is very impressive.  The contents of the books are so very interesting that I can't wait to read the entire trilogy.  Highly recommended.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Wish I had limitless energy so I could keep playing . I'm glad it's on the kindle cause I had to stop playing it on my iPhone.
B00377Z0Y4|5.0|Once you've heard all of the xmas classics on repeat 40 dozen times, pop this baby on to mix up the atmosphere.  It still has a holiday feel, but with the touch of Ian Anderson, you know it'll bring it's own character as well!
B009SJ3GUK|2.0|The series is frustrating and drags along the foundation storyline while introducing new stories each episode. That's fine, but questions are answered too slowly and character development takes forever and then turns out to be a let down/predictable.
0143038419|4.0|Good book…followed the movie pretty well. Not really a genial public book though. Definitely geared for women. Buy it for your mom.
B005PK553C|5.0|Amazing twisted series. Haven't enjoyed a series like this in years. Very addictive so beware, you will want to know the ending.
B001V7UXG2|5.0|Before Hugh Laurie was &#34;House,&#34; he was the rackety Bertie Wooster, prize example of British Aristocracy. Stephen Fry keeps his charge looking good while deftly helping extract Bertie from the stunning array of mishaps. The Cow Creamer episode is a favorite.<br /><br />Looking for something funny that doesn't rely on vulgar words or scatological humor? &#34;Jeeves and Wooster&#34; is just the ticket.
B000HL09MG|4.0|Super long movie but kinky, twisted and fun to watch on a Friday night when you have nothing better to do.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|app does not work. It is upside down and will not change positions. Also app is very old looking. Don't spend the 99¢
B009RI4FRU|4.0|If you have enjoyed Wes' other projects, this will not disappoint. All the fantastic cinematography we've come to expect is here, and a descriptive, enchanting world sprawls out from the first minutes of the movie. Edward Norton carries the movie as a no-nonsense Scout Master. Bill Murray's expected appearance relegated to sparse appearances, with little opportunity for humor.<br /><br />The child actors aren't perfect, but the incongruity between Anderson's peculiar dialogue makes for funny and heartwarming scenes. Bruce Willis might seem completely out of his element as a small town cop with no Germans to blow up, but he still manages to carry his role well. The biggest gripe I have with the movie is how rushed it feels... particularly character qualities that aren't fleshed out properly.<br /><br />Overall another good addition to the Wes collection and far better than most movies, but not his best.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This awesome book details the courage and guts that it takes to become a SEAL and the dedication that they have for this country. Page after page was gripping and exciting. God bless the SEALs and all of our men and women in uniform.
B003KGBISY|5.0|There have been many spin-offs of this film, but this is the original. Seven Samurai is a great classic and a film that will be treasured for generations to come.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great time waster. It's addictive because it's easy but it becomes a challenge to collect all the prizes and complete the puzzles.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|I'm so happy gg went out with a bang! Wish it never had to best show ever!! Finally was the best finally of any show I have ever watched
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I liked this game.  Graphics were good.  Fairly simple.  I thought some of the mini-games were under-explained and it didn't take long to complete but it was fun for a couple of hours.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|Loved the special effects, the story line and it was only $1.99 to rent, would be nice if all the recent releases were that price.
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|I love it, what a great movie. my sons watch it over and over again. It reminds you what christmas is all about
B004U52VPS|5.0|My Grandson asked Santa for this Angry Birds Game, so I got it for him, ...he loved it, played with it all day. Not too many pieces to pick up, but many different options to build towers, I'm sure he would give it 5 Stars.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was very cool and captivating! I loved it so much! Great writing by a great author! I loved it.
B000NI8F5G|5.0|I watched it 30 years ago. And watched with my kids again yesterday. We all loved it. Highly recommend it to anyone who loves singing and dancing.
B003F3FJQO|3.0|It was a very good book<br />Great for teens and young adults i would recommend it to a lot of people
B007S3S8HO|3.0|The set is not exactly Lego quality but not a compete waste of money. I do not like that the bricks seem to come apart too easy so get frustrated trying to build with them. The set Figues are a great size and there are great directions on how to build the structures on the box. I wanted Lego brand angry birds for my angry bird crazy four year old but Lego did not make any angry bird products. I am not sure I would buy Knex again just due tithe brick quality. Although the bricks we got seems to work with Lego bricks.
0061997811|1.0|I recieved my copy of the book on time and it was amazing. It was better than expected, but the spine was cracked. I sent it back because it was torn and they have NEVER sent a replacement!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Another perfect book from colleen Hoover! I don't know how she does it. I fall in love with her characters so totally, that it's almost painful to finish her books. She is one of the most talented writers I've come across. I read 3-4 books a week and can safely say her books were my favorite reads of the year and some of my favorite of all time.
B005T87QCI|5.0|this is an awesome game.so I decided to give it at try. I advise people to buy it and play it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't put it down!  The action never stopped... not even a lull!  I read the last 2 pages breathless!
B0084BMUFA|5.0|This book brings me back to remembering why we are here - to serve others and to share with others. I try to read this each year near Christmas and am always thankful that I took the time. There are great movie versions but the book has such rich writing and imagery that can exceed the movies.  I will be back next Christmas for another round with Scrooge.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The news feed only loads the first ten or so stories then it does some weird thing where it doesn't show the poster's photo next to their name. Refreshing does not help. Please update.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|Very good quality film. Fast delivery and resonable price. Would recommend this product to anyone looking for a classic film.  The color on this film was really nicely done.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It is handy because i am not that good at speling so i need a lot of help so that i can get better
B009VLX8FS|5.0|this is my first mp3 song album bought from amazon. That is great. I like it to listen in amazon cloud.
B0034G4P80|1.0|Shiny, good cinematography, inept direction & writing, albeit racist version of the Norse religion.<br /><br />Great special effects, but otherwise astonishing inept. Terrible writing, casting, knowledge of the basic Norse religion, basic geography, basic ethnicity of the Norsemen, or for that matter not even a basic knowledge of the comic books. The guy playing Thor is fine. Anthony Hopkins is overrated as usual. Humongous errors in logic and historical storyline. I guess the bottom line, is letting Hollywood make a movie about the Norsemen and their heroes is best left to the people actually from that country.<br /><br />With regards to casting, aside for whether Anthony Hopkins is overrated or not, the casting for this movie was pretty racist. I mean c'mon, Asgard was about the Norse gods. Hello?! Norse Gods here?!  Casting the Norse god Heimdall (Guardian of the Rainbow Bridge) with an black-skinned actor is simply racism at it's worst. What's next? A remake of Braveheart, but we find out he was really Taiwanese? A remake of Zulu, but this time one of the tribesmen is a Eskimo? A biography of Muhammed Ali as played by Matt Damon? Certainly, much as in the 1930's there was the Hays code which regulated morality in movies, and today we are about the same with having the diversity regulations. But if you wanted diversity, just make the Earth characters whatever quota of diversity you want. Let me guess, in the remake of the Wizard of Oz, Toto this time is actually going to be a poodle.<br /><br />Oh...now I recall, in the new remake of Bambi, Thumper wasn't tough enough for today's crowds per Hollywood. This time Thumper is going to be a tattooed, rip-muscled, butt-kicking, mixed martial arts-using wabbitt who puts down anyone who tries to pick on Bambi.<br /><br />And what's all the nonsense about Odin wanting to make Thor King of Asgard? What? Odin is king of Asgard! It make absolutely no sense that there's some sort of chance for Thor to be king of Asgard, it'sjust ridiculous. Odin is king of the gods, hello? Is anybody writing this movie at home? Hello?  'Nuff said.<br /><br />Ok, one more thing.  While Stellan Skarsgard was in this movie, he has a much better character as a local king in Beowulf & Grendel. Although personally, i think B & G would have been much better without the sea hag, and for that matter without Grendel as well. Although, I guess they'd have to change the name then.
B0068MNNOE|5.0|I think this is the most under appreciated film of the past year..Expected to be a big hit until it got a cold reception on pre-release.. The only problem that I can see is that it can be hard to follow, especially for viewers that are not experts on the Elizabethan era.. If you are intrested but not certain I recommend that you pick it up at a price you are comfortable with.. I have watched it dozens of times and it gets better and more clear with each viewing.. LOOKS GREAT IN BLU RAY.....  dp
B00785P2QC|1.0|The original Virtual City was great, but this has turned into your basic money grab.  Before, you only needed to worry about having sufficient virtual cash to run you city.  This adds energy and investment credits to the mix, which ultimately take real cash to obtain.  Sure you can earn a trickle of energy by playing the game, but since everything you do takes energy (usually multiple credits), it won't last long unless you shell out real money.  The investment credits are even worse.  You can earn an occasional credit by completing some task, but most free credits require you to promote their games on Facebook.  The free credits don't come near what's required.  Ultimately, it's going to be expensive to play this game for long.  I'm hoping someone will just release Sim City for Android.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I love Michael Connely and Harry Bosch.  I read through this book in hours as they story is very fast moving.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|This is such an addicting program, and Claire Danes is Marvelous! I can't wait for season two to come out on DVD!
B0055PMJMW|5.0|Michael Connely is great, and Harry Bosch is the best detective!  I was happy to purchase this book and get all 3 books in 1.
B002RSQGQK|4.0|Great classic movie from a simpler time! From an era where all the money was spent on the actors, not special effects.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|with the new Jack Reacher series coming out, I thought I would start reading the series and see if they were any good.  It was great.  The story was interesting and had me guessing all the way through.  I can't wait to read the next one.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Gripping and suspenseful. Excellent characters and well drawn stories. It keeps you on the edge of your seat at all times.
B008JFC6F0|5.0|Unique, head-filling, complex, evocative. Everything I love in music. Masterful. (not derivative, but echoes, for me, Dungen, John Lennon, Ariel Pink (at his best).
B009VLX8FS|5.0|I have never bought any of tswift's previous albums but RED had enough songs on it that I loved, so i got it.  I'm pretty happy with it so far :)  If you're unsure of whether or not you like the songs, you can always youtube before you buy!
B007MDQW3W|5.0|I enjoy Ms. Spektor's use of piano. Her compositions are a bit unusual and the piano adds to her unique style.
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|I ordered this app for my Kindle in November and have yet to have the app appear on my device.  I have 2 Kindles: the original Fire and also the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\" and neither one shows the Angry Birds Star Wars app. to this date.  Strange!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I stayed engorssed throughout the book, however, I found the end not very satisfying.  I still would recomment this book.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|I am always fascinated by McEwan's novels, but they do seem to alternate between traditional novels where the reader gets the traditional novelistic pleasure of working through a situation with characters that are appealing and novels that are very clever works with characters that the reader keeps at a distance and watches as the situation plays out around them. This one is definitely in the latter category. If I had read more British spy novels, I probably would have been even more amused, but as it was, I think &#34;Sweeth Tooth&#34; works well and is a very satisfying construction. Recommended for a quick, clever read.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Clint Eastwood delivers a stunning portrayal of a baseball scout.  I would definitely recommend this to everyone (including your significant other).
B0009RCPY8|5.0|The packaging is great! a true gift item. The movies themselves are terrific. My Boys loved them when they were in grammar school and still love them today
B00571F26Y|5.0|Wheat Belly is a real eye opener.  It is very informative, easy to read, and keeps your attention.  Many questions about health are answered
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This game isn't bad though I can say that I just started playing it yesterday....  but so far so good on my end =)
B00797MB0O|3.0|I somehow thought this would be funny. It was marked as a comedy. Charleze Theron's character is a petty, teenage-minded, shallow person that goes on a delusional quest to win back her ex, who is now married with a new baby, then is eventually shown that she doesn't give a *poo* about those people anyway... what the...?? There's a couple moments where she thinks about taking the first of maybe a dozen steps, then returns to her drunken depression. I expected some sort of growth, or realization. Really the movie was pretty bleak and borderline unbearable until Patton Oswalt showed up. The ending puts her right back to where she started. Yuk.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have done a lot of research on this subject and really appreciated this author's approach.  While it's nice to know someone met Jesus along the way, what I am more interested in is the greater picture.  This author gives us that.  Great read.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This is a very fun game! I was expecting something similar to the original Oregon Trail game but I like this too!
B004GYY714|5.0|TuneIn Radio is my favorite app for listening to the radio.  We have moved many times for work and I love that I can now listen to radio stations that I enjoyed in other cities.
1577314808|5.0|Excellent Book.. great to have it by your bed.. one of thoese books that you want to keep on reading.
B000002GZ1|5.0|Bought the original album in 1968, listening to every complex note and bend Butterfield coaxed out of his harps. This is a great album, well worth owning as a CD.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|we love this movie!  So cute and a great movie for kids!<br />We are going to watch and order more Studio Ghilbli movies!
B000002V07|5.0|Un disco que hace años que busco, lo tenia en mi wishlist, me decidi a comprarlo y no me equivoqué! 5 stars!
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Awesome story that i could not put down!! The kite runner was also a good book by Hosseini. I cannot wait for his new book to come out
1419705849|5.0|I can't get into the Wimpy Kid books, but my children love them. My 12-year old asked for the new one for Christmas, and apparently it's just as appealing as those that came before it because my 10-year old got his hands on it and had read a quarter of it before his sister could snatch it away.<br />As the others, it seems to be a quick light read with the off color humor enjoyed by most Tweens.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|this app sucks. it wont load the news feed and the print is small. very dissapointing, as the most popular application facebook should be the best app
B000YHG72E|5.0|This is a a great movie and is among my  holiday favorites. It is funny and cute! I have a list of holiday movies I watch every year and I added this one last year and I will continue to watch for years to come. If you like funny holiday movies this is a must have. I love it!!!
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|No one likes a weak hero, but that's exactly what Chrisian Bale pulled off. The script was weak and even the beautiful addition of Cat Woman [ Anne Hathaway ] could not save this weak film. We have grown to expect much from the Dark Knight and I am sad to say that watching one more of this caliber could ruin the legend.
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|I'm using a Roku, And Amazon took the money and I didn't get to watch the movie. Now I hope I don't get charged because it looks like I might of. Totally disappointing; last time I'm attempting to buy a movie from Amazon like this
1449433251|5.0|Great product for a great price. I was very surprised to have the package arrive within 3-4 days, as it was expected to arrive  a week later. Highly recommended, thanks for the great service.
B00AMBLDEE|2.0|a pale imitation of the real (Matt Damon) Bourne movies. nowhere near as interesting or exciting. surprisingly little action for an action movie
B006K2WXOI|5.0|The book is still amazing!!! It was read to me by my 3rd grade teacher! And I loved it then, and I love it now! It's sweet, and heart warming! Especially for the Christmas time. I read it to my little sister all the time! Great book!
B005G4TJUC|1.0|I had placed a huge order for my children for christmas. I was so upset when my children got the movie and there was no disc at all. so my bad review is with the company not with Amazon since they were kind enough to fix this problem and send another movie free of charge and free of shipping!! Thak you!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|As my first John Greene novel, the book surprised me. I had heard many people rave about it, but I am a harsh critic and must read things for myself. The book was written so well and the story line followed as to keep the reader interested throughout the entire thing. I couldn't put the book down. John Greene has a way with words that many people aspire to in this day and age. He made me fall in love, ripped my heart out, and made it,well I won't say whole again, worth having it broken. Thank you my dear friend for the journey.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I finished this book in a day. I found it amazing. It's a tear jerker, but still absolutely fantastic. Read it!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book was really good but I suggest having background information on Roman and Greek gods and goddesses and :/  read the Percy Jackson series and the two books before this so you get the whole point of this book other wise it won't make any sense to you. The relationship and references are formed in previous books. Also this book has a glossary so I suggest going to the back of the book and reading that then the book.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I loved this book so much because it's so funny and really can make a person laugh.  I don't have any dislikes. I would recommend this book to someone who likes to laugh a lot. In grade wise, grades 3-4-5. A-mazing!!!
B000YHG72E|5.0|A great movie that doesn't have any spoilers and is kid friendly (i.e. my little guys enjoyed it and it didn't try to spoil things by saying Santa isn't real).  A lot of fun.  I'd recommend this to my friends.
B0039PPW60|3.0|Well, I guess I don't know how to use this thing. I sent it back. I wanted to play my guitar through my computer then out to my Awesome surround sound system, which includes KA Klipshe KG5.5 's and a SVS cylinder sub, but I digress.. I played around with this for a few weeks but couldn't find an easy way to do this. I wanted to play my guitar through my Digitech RP-10 and out through my stereo system. Now I could do that but I thought this machine would allow me to add drum machines or synths and play it out the system speakers..Maybe I didn't try enough , I couldn't figure out how to play the guitar out in stereo as well, only mono..Stereo guitar is really awesome. Anyway..didn't work out for me..
B00AMBH70S|4.0|This episode of the Bourne series is more cerebral than the others with more material about the neuroscience behind Treadstone so it's a bit difficult to keep up with at times but it'll still keep you on the edge of your seat.
B004H1V5RU|1.0|Where is the small ball inside the sphere? I am truely perplexed! Got the sphere for a Christmas gift. No ball inside!  Am I doing it wrong? EPIC FAIL ...Waiting for another..Bad quality control.
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|Brilliant and irreverent. Beautifully animated and loved Mark's somewhat menial personality which made him so bear dependent. Well worth watching again.
B007EECSFA|5.0|The story kept my interest till the end. It was easy to read and had some unexpected events. Life changes with the times.
B009G41CG2|5.0|I play it all the time now.  It has become my new favorite game to play.  I don't think you will be disappointed with it.
0345803485|3.0|To be honest I heard my mom talking about it so I thought I would read it, it's not really porn it's more about this weird guy who just happens to be a billionaire and a woman who is always whining. I got to give it 3 stars because I did get hooked on the story so it must have been ok, I wont read book 2 and 3. If you are looking for a book with naughty bits you will be disappointed, if you are looking for an original story you will be disappointed, but as a novel to read on the beach, its ok.
B009GIPDQS|4.0|The Racketeer....typical Grisham...He just keeps you turning pages until the end...a good read and cannot wait for the next book.
B009KNPNT6|5.0|Love Eric Clapton, this album is pretty good like the first disc the best.<br />Great to listen in the car when they are playing junk on the radio.
0465011047|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a pastor who serves the people of North Korea.  It is a hard hitting book describing the horrors of the prison camps in North Korea.  I plan on reading it again and again and again.
0760703329|5.0|3rd Anniversay is leather?  So, how do you get creative?  Leatherbound books will do the trick, and what better for your Shakespeare-loving spouse?  This was the perfect gift.  And it is beatifully bound.
1608871452|5.0|I own every book known to man kind that has anything to do with supernatural and this was by far my favorite!! The minute I got it, I was surprised at its size. It is an amazing book with so much unknown information on all the seasons. Not to mention there are some cool little surprises throughout the book. I wish I could give it more than 5 stars.
B0045HCJQW|5.0|Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn star in this show/ movie.  In my opinion this is the best work they have both done.  It is a fantastic spectacle.  Katherine Hepburn is so good at just trying to be a good daughter ,  yet she ALWAYS does this whatever she  feels the need to do  The movie is in black and white, but you really do not care about the color of this movie, especially  when you know you are seeing a gem of a picture.
B001D0BLTA|5.0|great movie the wife and kids love it i would recommend this move for every one to own and watch with the family
B000068FUK|2.0|As other British blues albums have been re-released on CDs with a \\"new and improved!\\" song list that contains material not on the original album - to the record's and the listener's detriment - so too has this one.<br /><br />And this might not always be a bad thing if 1) the new material is worthy, and 2) it's added at the end of the original material and not interspersed within it.<br /><br />In this case, I bought the CD hoping for the same great high-energy spark right off the bat that the album has ... but alas, somebody's chosen to toss a couple mediocre tracks in right up front - tracks 1 and 2 - which have NONE of the energy the rest of the record has.  So instead of starting off the play list movin' and groovin' you must now wade through a couple low key tracks before things get rolling.<br /><br />I guess the remedy is to burn my own disc and set the tracks up the way I prefer, but what a pain.<br /><br />Still, the album rocks in the way that only TYA could, stepping out of the wannabe bounds that most all other Brit blues players did.
B000FC1HBY|3.0|This was very hard for me to follow.  I liked it but I loved Book 1 so in comparison it wasn't as good.
B00A80SHFM|1.0|Ok this CD is missing quiet a few songs on it's track. Where's ' Do you hear the people sing'? Thats a famous and important song. I should know I had to sing it a lot in music class with the rest of the students. Thats a highlight of the movie. Where is the Little Rain is missing too they really need to redo this CD or there;s gonna be quiet a lot of mad fans sending more reviews.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|And we loved it in color!!! So glad we got to watch this again this year and now have it to own. :)
B004SBQGHS|4.0|We LOVE Angry Birds! I just wish I didn't have to pay for it twice. Once on my iPhone & once on my Kindle!
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|I did not love it the way I did Angels and Demons or Da Vinci Code, it seemed forced.  It was ok and Dan Brown is a great author but this wasn't one of my favories.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|You will cheer for young August from the first page, and the book doesn't disappoint.  I really enjoyed the point of view changes in the middle.  We are able to see him how others see him; wondering what it must be like to grow up as one of 'those people' who scare little kids just by looking how he does.  This is definitely a 'glass is half-full' type of book, and I look forward to reading it with my 3rd grader.
B00846REIS|5.0|So excited for the next book to come out!!! :) Love Gideon.. love love love love him!  Come on May!
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Very Good Movie. Enjoyed it.  Acting was good; decent dynamic between key characters.  A family movie, which I wouldn't have a problem recommending to someone else..
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Totally recommend.. Love the series!! Usually I like Fantasy or Drama with my love story, but this series certainly has enough action!
0547391005|5.0|My grandson loved these books and my daughter loved reading them to him.  When you can give a child joy, what else is there?
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Totally recommend.. Love the series!! Usually I like Fantasy or Drama with my love story, but this series certainly has enough action! :)
B0083P1QUM|4.0|I know this is a personal prejudice but I like the Scarpetta novels.  The characters have become family and each book an anxiously awaited report on there well being.  I like the mix of police work, science, and medicine.  I have read all of the Scarpetta series and still enjoy them.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Gideon really helped me move on from Christian Grey.. loved this book and series, can't wait for the 3rd book to come out!
B007BVMVDU|5.0|First Class - can't stop watching the episodes<br />Good characterisation and story. I strongly recommend this for adult viewing,<br />Too gory for kids !
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Totally recommend.. Love the series!! Usually I like Fantasy or Drama with my love story, but this series certainly has enough action... :)
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Wow... I saw this movie in 3D at the movies and ever since then I've seen it another 25 times on my Panasonic 3d. 25 times. Call Dr.Phil I need an intervention. It's a perfect blend of action and storytelling. I won't give too much away. The HULK stole the show in my opinion. Perhaps I'm being bias seeing he is my favorite of all time,just edging out 'the man of steel'. My advice to you is get this movie. It comes with<br />1. Digital copy<br />2.DVD<br />3.Blu Ray<br />4.Blu Ray 3D
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is absolutely breathtaking. I stayed up till 2 reading it. Now, onto the second, anxiously. Team katniss and petta.<3
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|the movie is great from the start to the end. i recommended to all marvel an non marvel fans alike ...
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I love all her books.<br />She is one of the best I have ever read.  I can't wait for her books to come out.
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|I purchased this as a Christmas present for my husband.  We watched it Christmas Day and were thoroughly engrossed.  A little &#34;star wars-like&#34;, but a lot deeper(intellectually).  Left room for Prometheus 2.  An exploratory excursion into the universe to find the origin of their species. My husband and I believe there is a much better way to accomplish that, but a very interesting science fiction movie, if you remember it is fiction.
B00846REIS|5.0|Was looking for something to read after finishing EL James 50 Shades of Grey Trilogy. So glad I found this book which is neck to neck on the top of my list for best book EVER!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This is always a good app!! It's even better on the kindle. Screen is a whole lot bigger than using it on a phone. Highly recommended.
0062124293|4.0|This autobography which describes the emotional life and feminist development  of a working class English girl born in 1975 is best for younger women who will identify with the struggles of the author. Those of us who are older have been<br />through this already.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|This book spans the globe with historical and political references.  The author's knowledge of events is astonishing, and he provides enough humor and surprise to make this book very enjoyable.
B005SDMDRW|3.0|Not as good as most of his books.... I kept wanting to read more of each more of each section.
B0052AC8C6|4.0|this movie is great and adorable but whats sad is a chameleon could never live in that aquarium, let alone get into adventures in the desert. he would have been dead in a week in that cage, just a tip for anyone that wants to get a cham because rango seemed so cute, please get a care book or a subscription to \\"reptiles magazine\\" first. that said, enjoy the cute ass movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|What a riveting and fast pace thriller.  I could not put it down and was drawn into the world of Panem.  Can not wait to read book two.
0425263908|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing. Unordered the second book as soon as I finished reading this one. I think its better than 50 shades of grey and I LOVED that series!
B00005JKZV|5.0|It's not 100% following the book, but it's beautifully done with excellent cinematography.<br /><br />I needed seven more words to finish.
0316227706|5.0|Gave this book as a Christmas gift. It was awesome. very colorful pictures of cool dogs. The person who received the gift was delighted.
0470876417|5.0|The book was brought under my attention at the JCI (Junior Chamber International) Business Leadership Academy. A weekend long seminar here in Belgium for developing business leadership skills.<br />The exercises the trainers conducted \\"with the book at hand\\" were real eye-opening and triggered with me a \\"waw\\" effect. So the monday, I ordered this book. Got it about a week later (yes, in The Netherlands and Belgium there still is no Amazon, and shipping from abroad takes time). I read it page by page, as I do every book, while taking notes in evernote while reading it. It's really worth every cent.<br /><br />The business model canvas is magnificent to use with start-up projects and intended product launches. This book really explains it in detail so that you can put it in business immediately.<br />I enjoyed very much the part on Strategy, with detailed info's on how to evaluate business models and how to manage them.<br /><br />So yes, I recommend it.
B006ZS4WIM|4.0|Thank you for fast delivery on time! I bought it for Christmas gift for my son and he liked it very much. Relatively expensive price is some problem for it. It's expensive than Lego homepage though they run out of it.
1118156315|4.0|This book has taken the info's from the book \\"Business Model Generation\\" and applied all the concepts and ideas on \\"you\\" as a person.<br />So yes, there's a big overlap. So if you buy this book with the intention to re-invent your career and did not yet read 'business model generation', you'll love it much more since it contains all information you need and you don't get the overlap \\"d&eacute;j&agrave; vue\\" effect.<br /><br />My kids will have to read this book at age 17. No doubt about it.<br />To me, it's a must read for every student age 15 - 17 that starts dreaming about her or his career.
0894803123|5.0|Delicious!  Best ice cream I've ever made. There is quite the variety of flavors as well as bases to choose from.  Recipes work great with the KitchenAid ice cream maker.  Highly recommend.  Yum! Yum! Yum!
B0099TJ4YQ|2.0|While the song selection was interesting, the only one that was innovative was &#34;Jingle Bells&#34;. Many of the other selections were cheesy and annoying, especially &#34;Baby It's Cold Outside&#34;
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Incredibly written. I was brought to tears and the ending has the perfect amount of resolution. I cared immensely for these characters
B008A1TIOK|3.0|It promises more than it delivers. It does not compare favorably to the original piece. I think that the original piece played by a an excellent  violinist will be superior
B00AL1ONN8|4.0|T.I: is bringing it as usual. The collabos set this as a must purchase. One of the best yet and it seems from the heart on this one. Keep bringing it, TIP1
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Perfect for me, I've received it on time and it is as I saw it on the picture. Great deal!
B006OAB3ME|4.0|Saw the production on PBS and thought, &#34;what a different side to Sir Paul&#34;.  Had to buy the CD.  It's worth the money, and a fun music session.  Very versatile, and the musicians who accompany him are soo good!<br /><br />Clayton J. Andover KS
B005K0HDGE|5.0|great story, instantly draws you in.  catchy concept.  I haven't finished the book but so far I've been drawn into the story from page one.
B009TGW4CI|3.0|I wanted to watch this to get hyped up for Django.  I was sufficiently hyped.  Kurt Russel is a creeper.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|I read all three books back to back.  These are page turning stories with very indepth character building by the author.
B009LL4LMM|5.0|Simple and fun had a good time playing it. Very cute and appropriate for kids. I don't like writing reviews for amazon
B002PMPTIO|5.0|Great movie bridged the old with new and looking forward to the new movie coming out! if you don't own it buy it today!
B003O86FMW|5.0|What I like is that primrose is still alive along with Katniss` mother, but what I don't like is that district twelve doesn't exist anymore.
B006TJXZ30|1.0|I have several MSN/Hotmail accounts and this only lets you bring in one, that I know of. There are no help instructions which makes it a total waste of time.
B001BN1ZHW|5.0|Fun movie - good acting, great songs, lots of fun. Love Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter. Easy buying. Definitely recommend.
B007THA4FI|4.0|The book is not as interesting as her previous books. I will try again reading this book but so far it is not the same as her other books.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I was sobbing at the end! Couldn't put it down! I love that it was written from a dog's perspective.
B001OQCV2E|5.0|We do enjoy this movie so we bought it to watch when we want to. We like the actors and content.
1439152802|5.0|Good read - even better than Forgotten Garden! I just love books that immerse you in their history and the author does this so well. Normally I buy kindle editions but knew I wanted the hardbacks of this trilogy in my library - so glad I was not disappointed. Can't wait for the next book!
0783225547|5.0|We do enjoy this movie so we bought it to watch when we want to. We like the actors and content.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|It was so compelling.  I could hardly put it down.  The writing was superb, easy to read and comprehend.  Can't recommned it enough.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I am such a fan of this series...I absolutely love it!!! I have seen every episode but I wanted it in my collection.<br />The price was great and I received it very quickly.
B002ZG99A4|4.0|Pretty good movie with a lot of action and a better story line than I expected.  I'm now looking forward to watching the sequel.
B0011Z76RS|5.0|The cd was mind-blowing when it came out. Re-listening is a guilty pleasure and well worth it. The songs are a bit over the top in retrospect but they still sound incredible in the car VERY LOUD! Awesome.
B009G7ZYPY|3.0|Personally, the song selections were not all that great.  Her past CDs were far more enjoyable.  I love Susan Boyle's voice, so I was  disappointed in this CD.
B0088XXCZ6|5.0|Fiona Apple is at her best on this recording. Raw, unfettered by big production. Emotive. Personal. Almost uncomfortable to listen at times as it feels so intimate. The recording is exceptional.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Very entertaining for the whole family.  Animation was superb and beautiful - thus very pleasing to watch by all.  Recommended for all to enjoy.
B007918P1E|5.0|I love this band and singer, so I am biased, but this is my favorite one. The songs are simply great. The recording is a step up.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This show is very realistic and the drama and suspense is over the top!  I can wait to watch the 2 part season finale.
B00005JPCF|4.0|Great family friendly movie with a good story.  I like the overall story of the movie and is, to me, very well created in the visual aspect of the scenery also.
B0085YOD1A|1.0|the screen show u can c it in the status bar but that's not true it just like the free one
B007FJFDXS|4.0|my uncle has it on his ipad and I find it easier on the. ipad than the kindle fire.another thing is I wish it had more levels my uncle and I got addicted to the game after the first level. if they didn't add more levels they should make the levels harder. definetly worth $2.99 thou. I hope everybody else including kids and adults injoy this addicting.
B000YHG72E|5.0|This is a timeless movie about the innocent heart of one who believes in the spirit of Christmas and the heart of truth.  Plus, it is hilariously funny!
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Very inventive hidden object game with fun puzzles mixed in!  The graphics are quite beautiful and the game is challenging enough for all to enjoy.  I will be looking for more games by this maker in the future. Well worth the money.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Best book of his so far.I thought that he had just about burned out but was very wrong.this is by far his best book ever.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Was cute and entertaining. The characters had good personalities.  They always get caught in the end,but it is fun to read about the chase.
140123755X|5.0|The item came exactly as described with a very quick delivery.  It was a Christmas present so it was nice to not have to worry about anything with it and to have it on time.
B005S39YGU|5.0|yep. If you are at all a geek, this is your show. this is my new favorite show to watch.
067960085X|5.0|My wife really enjoyed this book.  She claims that it has knocked off A Prayer for Owen Meany as her all time favorite.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|This album has become one of my new favorites, I listen to it all the time. I love the fact that several of their songs (not just one or two) are used on various commercials and TV programs!
B001HN6922|3.0|I ordered this product quite a while ago as a gift for a grandson and ended up giving it to him for Christmas.  Someone noticed a scratch on the DVD and we were worried that it would need fixed - we found that it worked okay when played. So we do not need to return it.  It was shipped in a timely manner - we appreciated that very much.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was very intense and idiotic but has a great story line.  At least so far.  I am getting ready to read the second book.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Truly one of the best movies eve.  I mean EVER.  No family should be without it.  Get it. Watch it with your family.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|I drown loaded this for my daughter.  the game would not allow us to move past putting down the windmill. my daughter was ulster when I unintalled it.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|Like all of Mitch Albom's books, while they are entertaining, they also give you something to think about.  A very interesting author.
B006O6F932|5.0|My 7 yr old got this from Santa this year.  This is the only thing she asked him for.  She absolutely loves it!  It is very big and came with lots of accessories.  It is however very flimsy.  I plan to build her a turntable to set it on so she can turn it around to play with it.  If you try to pick it up or slide it - it will fall apart.  She was very happy with it and I feel it was a great buy for $30 (we got $30 off for getting amazon card).  It is very cute, just needs to be more sturdy.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Facinating account of the human spirit and the will to survive regardless of circumstances.  Very insteresting story, true or false.
0634089358|4.0|I have seen this book for years and have 3 other Ed Friedland books to include the walking bass books (1 and 2) and the Reggae book.  Ed really researches his material and this book hits many of the blues standards.  I think this is a very important book as well because the majority of bass players under the age of 20 have no concept of even the most basic blues progression.  This book too is a nice primer for the jump from blues to jazz.  I have not yet dug in on this book but I did preview the tracks and read through the book with the CD.  I wish that the bass was isolated on either the left or right channel vs bass and guitar on left and guitar only on right.  The bass on the left channel is very much buried in the mix, even after attempts to eq out the guitar.  Interesting because the books mentioned above have separate bass tracks.  I do like the addition of solo's over the songs, well somewhat, there is a reason for me picking bass over guitar.  Sure would have preferred hearing with the bass and drums are doing to hold down the rhythm.  Oh well, I have yet to find the perfect method book.  My goal is to thoroughly work through this, lend it to a guitarist friend, have him pick some tunes and then lock myself in with the individual bass lines in a jam session or two.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|Like the game do not like having to purchase coins.  Seems a waste because she use them up to quicklly.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|They shouldn't call it total recall, should if called it something else. It was a decent action movie that's about it
B004V98UKS|3.0|This is a relatively good puzzle game that is a little frustrating to control outside of the actual game. Like navigating menus and such is difficult due to the small buttons. The controls in game aren't bad though. It is challenging and decently fun. You have boxes you need to move to specific spots, and some cramped spaces to move them in. You have to make sure you don't end up messing up your chances by moving a box into a corner. If you like puzzle games you will like this, as long as you can get past the tiny menu buttons. Works well on my Motorola Atrix 4g.
B009O5CLZY|5.0|this is an excellent runner game<br /><br />the goods<br />1. graphics are nice and smooth<br />2. easy controls<br />3. you can actually achieve the goals<br /><br />the bads<br />1. annoying music<br /><br />and by the way this app is royalty worth 99cents
B001706I5I|1.0|This made me want to gouge my eyes out and my ears off. Even if the fx weren't awful the movie may have ended up being charming somehow, but Jim Carey's acting and voice officially ruined whatever hope it had. The only redeeming quality in this movie is the dog.<br /><br />Don't waste your time or money on this movie, unless you hate yourself and/or your children.
B005HSL626|5.0|We enjoyed playing it. I was shocked at how much fun it was to play this game. All ages can play
B008Y1YJZY|5.0|The movie is just  fantastic, i cut not have chance to see last year in theaters  But i never doubts to have  it in my movie collection. The 3d is just ok, nothink espectacular , but the storie is so nice , a really positive christmas message for every one.
B00A31UXLW|4.0|My favorite Detective, Harry Bosch, does it again but gee Michael how about giving him a understanding girl friend and a supportive boss!. Harry against the odds and with his network of co opted helpers solve cases that others cant make any headway.with. I thoroughly enjoy the ride with Harry, keep em coming Michael.<br />Dennis Lourey, Australia
B0098VYCCE|2.0|Scenery was very pretty and effects were cool.  But I found the acting a bit corny and I fell asleep. MIght be better for a younger (10-16) audience.
B007WFTFG6|3.0|We havent used this application so therefore we dont have a review other than to say tha this was for our 2yr old
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Awesome movie!!! in my opinion.... it's Family Guy, rated R version.  It's a party coming of age/love story so there's just the right amount of sap to go along with the hilarious comedy.
B005HSL626|5.0|Husband is addicted to playing this crazy game. He even got his brother in law to play it on his phone
B009H442DG|5.0|I heard this CD playing on a store intercom and I recommend it for all of the Christmas music lovers.
B001F7MSES|5.0|Felizzz con esta edicion la esperaba asi muchooo tiempo.<br /><br />La recomiendo completamente.<br /><br />Muchas gracias!<br /><br />I love it!! !! !! !!
0345529057|4.0|The story is amazing, very very nice, but well, it's the economy box right? So don't expect great paper .
B00005JPFH|5.0|Felizzz con esta edicion la esperaba asi muchooo tiempo.<br /><br />La recomiendo completamente.<br /><br />Muchas gracias!<br /><br />I love it!! !! !! !!
B0041KKYEW|4.0|I found the acting by Natalie Portman a little over the top, but the supporting cast was terrific and the dancing - ballet -<br />very beautiful.  I also thought the story sad but well told.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Enjoyed this book very much. It was just what the description makes it sound like. A coming of age story with some dark and awkward moments.
B009MO5ES8|4.0|This is a good movie with a decent plot and a lot of (...extreme) biking in New York City.<br /><br />Wilee is a messenger that delivers rush packages in New York on his bike. He has no brakes, on his bike and we wonder how he is still alive. One day he is told to deliver a receipt to a Chinese restaurant. It happens that the receipt represent the exact payment of a Chinese immigrant student to the Chinese mafia for her son to come and joint her. It also happens that the amount of money also represent the exact amount that a corrupt NYPD detective owes to the Chinese mafia. Who is going to get the ticket and what is going to happen to the little Chinese kid? Now you got the plot and you probably even guessed the ending.<br /><br />The movie while predictable has some of the most amazing biking in the streets of New York city.<br /><br />Four stars for this action packed movie with predictable ending but very original shots taken from a biker point of view.
0740748475|5.0|My daughter turned 15 this year and she has Loved Calvin and Hobbes her whole life she was very excited!
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|A great end to the Dark Knight Saga. Not as many action sequences as the other movies in this series, but with a solid story line this movie still captivated me and my wife.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|This movie will cheer up any Scrooge as it shows that no matter how bad your holidays might be going, they could always be worse...  Classic Christmas comedy that is a family favorite year after year...
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My grand daughters will love it , my son is watching it now and enjoys it.  Love Danny device. Ya
B000O77SRC|5.0|This is a must have for any action movie lover.  It's a great action movie that you can get away with calling a Holiday classic...
B0093FNZT6|3.0|Wanted more from this book, love these stories but just couldn't get into it , kept losing me thru some of the chapters.
B00005LOUP|5.0|This version of &#34;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&#34; is really good.  Carrey does a great job of playing the Grinch.  It's one of our family's favorites during the holidays...
B005CRPB0U|5.0|The book was charming and I found it to be a great idea to add books from the Harry potter series. It was excellent, but the only thing I'd like to know is why wasn't Grumbly the grubby goat included in the story? :)
B004P91ARE|5.0|This album made Jazz fashionable to listen to...  Dave Brubeck had a sound that was ahead of its time.  It's classic music that is timeless...  It sounds as good today as it did when it was released!!!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was funny cool and I finished it in two days! IT was also kind of easy but I liked it. Admin powered by Leet Servers.com
034580404X|5.0|I am an old fashoin girl. I need to hold the book to read not read it on e reader.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|I think that this dicionary is a good way that you can brothel and if you need to lookup something it's right there when you need it and will do you good when you are on the go.
0316226424|5.0|I purchase this book for my daughter and she was so so surprise and I was happy that their was another book for her to read about the twilight charcters she is such a big big fan. Thanks again.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is really fun. It takes you into Greg's world and you get to live it. It makes you laugh an  especially read!
B00AB0AR2U|3.0|Not great but ok, didn't care for the story line and even though it was ok the falling for an arts fiscal daughter was kinda dumb but over all it was ok
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|It is great .I finished the whole game. It is great for any kid ages 8 and up. I love it because it is addictive.
B0074MTTEK|5.0|Revolutionary does not hardly cover it!  I will never look at mehylization and imprinting in the same way.<br /><br />WTHBS, this is a must read for any budding behaviorial genetists in the crowd.  The author turns upside down the 'it's all in your jeans (not the last pun in this review)' argument by posing the following questions: 1) if our mental health is so hard-wired into us by our genes, how come ONLY 50% of the identical twins with schizoprhenia have schizophrenia (see Disclaimer # 1)? and 2) Among labratory rats breed to be genetically similar, how come ony 20-30% of their weight can be predicted by environmental factors (i.e. leaving 70-80% of the variations in the litter mates' wt unaccounted for (aka due to individual differences).<br /><br />Be warned, however, like much of scientific writing every word means something different and, if your 1st year University Chemistry is not quite up to speed this book can be hard slogging.  My advice?  The author might have spents some more time dealing with the issues that can be discussed in English---err---I mean understood by those of us with out a background in biology.<br /><br />For example, in the chapter where she describes reproductive technology that can produce a fruit fly with an extra leg in the middle of it's (if that is the proper pronoun) head AND the ability of large PHARMCOs to patent genetic strains, she might have dealt with the post GMP (i.e. genetically modified parent) world where all of us might consider the advantage of marrying someone with a third arm to carry all the stuff babies require and a third eye in the back of their head (Guess whose coming to dinner 21st century style).<br /><br />Still, it is possible to glimse the root of many of our social problems in the ability of proteins to differentiate genetic contributions that come from the mother and those that come from some one else.  I found myself fretting about the DNA-based drive to produce another litter fast so that the mother's genes can have another opportunity to enter the next generation and thus produce smaller verisions of themselves (the ying of DNA) and the drive to produce as large as offspring as possible to do as much as possible to garuntee the that that particular combination of DNA makes it to the point where it would be possible to contribute to the gene pool (the yang of DNA). I was left wondering whether their was a genetic determinant for the birth-order effect (aka - the maternal economy where the first born goes furthest very often by stepping on the next borne's head)<br /><br />Despite these quibbles, this book should be on anybody's reading list, especially if they plan to argue for eugenics or bell-shaped curve based educational policies.<br /><br />djc<br /><br />Disclaimer # 1 : I gathered some of the schizophrenic twin data.  One twin might have been hospitialized for pushing a burning couch off the 3rd floor balcony because it was possessed by the devil; the other (non-shizophrenic) twin aknowledged that the devil was everywhere but that one would not push a burning couch off a balcony because you might hurt someone.  What you saw (i.e., shizophrenic vrs. non-schizophrenic very often depended on which couch you sat on).<br /><br />Disclaimer # 2:  I am party to some research on the effect of PKU (a genetic disorder) on birthweight.  That is to say, I have my own theory about why some genetic disorders appear in the gene pool despite the fact that genetic disorders often elininate the carrier before they can procreate.

B0083Z614S|5.0|This is a wonderful book, and I enjoyed it very much. However, some of the periods were in the wrong place, and some of the nouns were capitalized. But this in no way detracted from the enjoyment of the book.
B005LAIGLE|5.0|Download it.  Buy it.  Just get it.  This is Taken on steroids.  Here's the thang.  1.  Mark Wahlberg's character loves his wife and children.  And, by extension, he loves her family and will do anything to protect them.  2.  I love his I'm bad (in the best way) and I know it, don't mess with my family or else, old-school character and portrayal.  Shout out to Mr. Wahlberg and the writers.  3.  There's not one moment that won't keep your attention centered on the physical, psychological, emotional charges of this film.  4.  If you've ever, ever chosen to do something because you were trying to save someone you love from reaping the negative consequences of their dumber than dumb decision, or if you've ever seen someone else you know who's done it, you'll get this film.  5.  I love loyalty.  And family loyalty is a beautiful thing -- sometimes had to live with, but at it's core -- beautiful.  ALL these things and more are in the film.  All the actors rock.  You forget they're acting.  They become the part.  They are their characters.
B000NVT0RU|5.0|When you think of France's Liberation from the Germans one tends to think of the combined efforts of the Americans, British, Canadians, and the Free French, yet there's a largely untold story of these Free French as many if not most came from France's overseas departments.  \\"Indigenes\\" (French for indigenous) is an appropriate title as it seeks to address this historical oversight and does so in a manner free of the hamfistedness you might expect.  \\"Indigenes\\" opens in Algeria with a local leader urging men to volunteer to fight to free France.  It is a scene rich with irony as those colonized came to liberate the colonizer.  At the time Algeria was not considered an overseas department but an integral part of France, yet there were considerable tensions between the French who had settled there and the indigenous population.  The film focuses on several men who volunteer from one village with most fitting a somewhat clich&eacute;d stereotype of sorts: the noble wise leader, the mercenary, and so on, yet the film itself is not clich&eacute;d.<br /><br />\\"Indigenes\\" follows the men through the Italian campaign of 1943/1944 and we get a sense that the Algerians are viewed as expendable cannon fodder - sent on the riskiest missions and attired in an assortment of French, British, and American castoff uniforms and equipment while the other armies are more uniformly attired.  This is historically accurate and emphasizes the Algerian's relegation to second-class status while fighting for France.  While the men question the injustice around them and seek its redress they are told to bide their time.  As they enter France the ambiguity of their position is thrown into high relief; the French they encounter are thrilled to be liberated but shocked to find it is by Algerians and not their fellow Frenchmen.  In the climatic scene towards the end the bravery the men exhibit in the face of battle and the social divide between them and the French they are liberating is perhaps as good as it gets in film.  I hated that the movie was re-titled as \\"Days of Glory\\" for the American market as it tended to de-emphasize the alienation and foolishly re-brand it as a war movie as that likely turned off viewers who may have otherwise wanted to have seen it.  As a Francophone I can tell you the translation for the subtitles is quite good compared to the usually mangling you can get.<br /><br />Director Rachid Bouchareb's intention was to shame the French government into honoring pensions it was supposed to pay Algerian veterans of the war, yet who were cut off when France suspended payments at the start of the Algerian War in 1959.  Apparently the trick worked as France did finally resume paying pensions.  That's testament not only to the power of this film, but to the perseverance of those thousands of men from throughout the French empire who answered the call to liberate France.  \\"Indigenes\\" is a story that needs to be told as the belief that it was Gen. Charles de Gaulle and an all French force that liberated France with the Allies isn't the whole truth.  The truth is that liberation was fought in a large part by people from throughout the empire and their sacrifice merits far greater recognition.ets in film.

B009MCRHH6|5.0|I like games like &quot;Where's my water?&quot; and 100 Floors &quot;. Games that make you think a little bit but at the same time are amusing and fun. This game is all that and more. The graphics, music and little stories are very well done and make it even more entertaining. Each challenge gives you a small hint on what and how to complete it...so make sure you read the captions and the signs from &quot;The SignMaker &quot;. I was lucky to see this as the &quot;free app of the day &quot; but I would have paid for it in a New York minute.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|A movie with 1 scene that was interesting, &#34;The Thunder Buddy Song&#34; scene.  The rest was boring, predictable, clichéd tripe.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|I really like Jeremy Renner so I was biased PRO this movie.<br />Unfortunately, the plot makes it impossible for the authentic and likable<br />cast to save the movie. It felt as a haphazard collection of scenes,<br />lacking climat and memorable fragments.
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|This is like &#34;Family Guy&#34; unplugged.  I really enjoyed the comedy but then I am a huge Seth McFarlane fan.  The streaming worked flawlessly on my Sony TV using the wireless connection.

0425252868|5.0|Imagine piloting a bullet-ridden B-17 bomber as you and three wounded crewmen limp your way back to your side of the WW-II battle line -- just as you see the face of a German fighter pilot with his guns trained on you, licking his chops?<br /><br />American pilot Charlie Brown (no kidding about the name) finding himself in this very situation simply closed his eyes and waited for the inevitable. After waiting to be bombed out of the sky for what seemed like an eternity and it did not happen, Brown eventually opened his eyes only to find the German pilot, Franz Stigler, frantically gesturing at him? Not understanding the full meaning of his gestures, Brown simply continued limping along until Stigler eventually peeled-off just as the B-17 crossed over the North Sea and back to safety in Allied territory.<br /><br />When Brown was later debriefed and related to his superiors that a German pilot had escorted his limping plane back to safety, Brown was instructed never to mention this incident again. Foregoing a silver medal for valor, and the right to tell what had happened to him to others, for 46 years Brown kept this incident a \\"close-held\\" personal secret. [For God forbid that America during the war would mention a single German as being fully human?]<br /><br />Adam Makos, the author, having uncovered both ends of this fascinating story from U.S. military archives, was intrigued enough by it to want to put the two ends together. And after considerable digging, his research was able to do just that. Not only did he connect and verify the facts in the story, but also was able to connect the two people involved as well. After 46 years, Charlie Brown and Frantz Stigler met in the flesh, where they cried as they embraced each other.<br /><br />This is the whole story from beginning to end of both of their lives and their military careers. Brown a typical \\"Good Ol' boy\\" from a small American town, and Stigler a morally troubled anti-Nazi Catholic flying for Goering's Air Force in WW-II. The two met on the moral as well as the military battlefield and were forever thereafter joined at the hip, one human to another. This is a Xmas story the reader will never forget, and I thank my wife for this wonderful book as a Xmas present. Five Stars
B000JRYOPG|5.0|The best independent film ever to ever come out. I can watch this movie over and overwith no problems at all
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|Better rendition of the Philip Dick classic.  This far surpassed the &#34;Ahnold&#34; fluff piece, getting more of the Dick &#34;post apocalyptic ruined earth&#34; flavor to it.  Definitely worth the watch.
B0083DJWGO|4.0|The only thing keeping me from giving this book 5 stars, since it is surely one of the most insightful and important books I've read, is Taleb's general disagreeableness. He's generally right and knows it, and insists on it and on your knowing it too.
B008ELUEQC|3.0|Stewart continues his successful American Songbook series with his first Christmas collection.  He is joined by Michael Buble, CeLo Green, Ella Fitzgerald, Mary J. Blige, Dave Koz, Trombone Shorty and Chris Botti, all slickly produced by David Foster.<br />I've never been a big fan of Stewart.  My favorite song of his is the 70s cover of Rare Earth's I KNOW I'M LOSING YOU.  His forays into a Bennett/Sinatra world only demonstrate the fact that Rod is really vocally challenged, as evidenced in his inability to reach the \\"Peace\\" note in SILENT NIGHT.<br />The best tracks include the spirited title track, WHAT ARE YOU DOING NEW YEARS EVE with the elegant Ella and the emotionally charged AULD LANG SYNE.  The WINTER WONDERLAND pairing with Buble is awkward in its male environment, suggesting Rod and Michael might get married by Parson Brown?<br />Rod is to be commended for his career endurance but I think he's better suited to his rock persona.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Game was well done.  Nice to see zoom included in the app.  Game had interesting story and plenty of ways to get through the game.  I rarely give a game five stars.  Developers seem to have put a lot of thought in this game.
030758836X|1.0|What a terrible ending.  After all the plot twists and clever writing, I was surprised that the ending was just, blah.  Waste of money.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The third installment in the Heroes of Olympus is by far my favorite. Rick Riordan has done a great job of giving each character ample attention and ability to develop their own personalities. The plot and story line are both unique and difficult to predict. My only gripe is that I have to wait a whole year for the next one!
B009WO7NQO|4.0|In every level is hardness but once the level gets addicting u get the hang of it and finally beat it
B0058VW36U|4.0|My friend had this app on her iPad and iPhone and I fell in love with it. The only downside for me is you need a certain amount of stars to unlock some boxes. Other than that it's great
B0041KVW2K|1.0|bought and returned two boxes due to terrible pressings, with no fill issues. although the mastering sounds pretty good, several of the records were terribly noisy. the book, however, is fantastic
B002ZG999U|5.0|This movie has a great cast, and it's fun to see an action movie where the action is real and not computer generated.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|While I enjoyed the movie, my husband felt it was a bit slow. Good performances from the actors and actresses. I thought the queen was outstanding!!!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Awesome game, I reccomend this to everybody out there. trust me, it's fun shooting birds at pigs!!!!!! The point is that the pigs stole the bird's eggs. hope you like it.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|this is a very fun &amp; addicting game that is much like mahjong, but better. i only have two problems with it: 1) the music is very very repetetive. it's just the same 4 chords played over and over again on the piano. it would be nice to have an option to turn it off while leaving the sound effects on. 2) there is a &quot;pause&quot; button that's too close to the cube so it's incredibly easy to accidentally hit it while trying to rotate the cube. and next to the pause button is another button that looks like a camera but i can't figure out what, if anything, it does.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|This app is a great app and it's even better because it's free. My friends and I love taking turns with it. It's also great that it keeps updating free and it has lots of seasons on it. Definitely an app to get<br />I recommend it.
B009SQRL4U|3.0|It was fun, but a little slow in parts, but young kids will really like the story and the concept.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|This movie has a lot of action, and it is not computer generated. It also has a lot of humor and a great cast.  I would highly recommend this movie.
B0028YPDVW|5.0|Our daughter loves playing with the Schleich wolves, which she asked for.  She watches a lot of commercials about them, and really wanted to get them.  They are well made.
B000YHG72E|4.0|Not a fan of most of Will Ferrell's comedy, his exaggerated innocence, love of sugar and immense Christmas spirit in this movie make it a classic we return to again and again.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|this is a really cool game with great graphics and music. it is very easy to get immersed in this game (especially with headphones) but it's not so easy to conquer the challenges! the challenge changes on each level, though the basics of gameplay stay the same, so it doesn't get boring. you can zone out and play the game at its slow starting speed, or you can swipe right-to-left to speed up &quot;time&quot; which makes everything move faster and speeds up the music as well. you can slow down again by swiping the other way. i haven't gotten past the third level yet because it can get pretty hard pretty fast, but it's still fun and relaxing. if you're really stuck you can access the menu to skip to the next level. it helps to spend some time practicing the controls until movement becomes intuitive.<br /><br />i am surprised that more people haven't tried &amp; reviewed this game, because it is very high-quality and definitely worth two dollars, if you can spare them.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is definitely worth the 6.99. Very good app and you can have lots of world's without deleting your old ones. I recommend this app!!!
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|This film was really good. It had a very intresting story line and I was intrested in the characters right from the beginning.
B005CRQ4XI|3.0|As a female who seriously hiked in my late teens in the early 70's, this book was a great disapointment from the planning stand point.  Yes, I think she found herself. But only after placing herself in danger.
141659521X|4.0|This was my first Vince Flynn novel and I could not put it down.  Vince keeps the action moving along and while I was not completely fooled by the plot it was exceedingly readable.  It did slow down as it came to it logical end but still worth the read.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|This game is awesome I love saving people and fighting crime and web slinging also you can by boosts for Spider-Man
B0081SPK0I|4.0|this game is really fun, although i hate the aesthetics of car racing and i hate this kind of music as well. the controls work really well. the only problem i have found with this game is that once you get to the high score page, you're stuck there &amp; as far as i can tell the only way out is to use your device's &quot;back&quot; button, and then the game asks you if you really want to quit. no one else seems to have mentioned this though, so maybe i'm missing something? anyway, this game works better than the last racer we got as FAOTD. i was expecting to delete it right away, but i'll keep it for a while. it doesn't take up too much space.
B005NS0VNU|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my brother. He loves it and has been looking for it everywhere. Now he can quit looking.
6305428298|5.0|A favorite movie for many years, I recently purchased this DVD to introduce my father in law to this brilliant film. If you only know Jane Horrocks from Absolutely Fabulous, you must see this movie. Her assumption of so many classic singers is truly exceptional, and the story line holds your attention from beginning to end.
B003X8597A|2.0|I agree with K. Feucht's review (also two stars). The singing and orchestra were superb, but the onstage actions and attitudes had little resemblance to Wagner's score. I had expected to experience Wagner's opera. Instead I got Stolzl's re-interpretation. I don't want that.<br /><br />My problem is not with the abridgement, the modernist setting, or even the masks. I object to misrepresenting the characters based on Stolzl's view of what they ought to be.<br /><br />Does the fact that Hitler loved this opera justify changing it into something Wagner wouldn't recognize? Not to me. Give us the opera as Wagner created it, and let us decide its merits.
B008EQIEWS|5.0|Received my order very quickly and item was as described. Made a great Christmas gift. Would recommend this site for sure.

B006M4RN3U|5.0|Every track is good.  One of the best albums out.  I will buy their next album as soon as it comes out for sure.
1400064287|4.0|This book is incredibly practical, and can help you create the most effective communication strategies that help make ideas &#34;stick.&#34;mI've used this book to help me refine the way I present myself and my ideas in job interviews, in writing marketing copy, and in fundraising proposals. I've also given it to employees, and have seen their communications become more targeted, clearer, and &#34;stickier.&#34; My only complaint is that the author is prone to being a bit long winded. Lots of examples, but too many sometimes and too wordy. The anecdotes help of course, but this book could be half the length and still make its points effectively. Still, well worth reading.
B009VYF5E2|5.0|I have enjoyed the show and cannot wait for the new season to start.  I intend  to buy every season video as long as it is available.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|Wonderfully written. Cannot wait to finally see the movie. Brilliant work Stephen chbosky. A + my friend A + .
031620157X|5.0|My daughter received this book this morning and had completed it by lunch time.  She is a fast reader, but as soon as she finished she came running to me and said \\"this was a really, really awesome book!\\"  I have not personally read it (and I will try update this review when I do), but my 10 year old reads quite a bit and is not easily impressed and she thought this was really wonderful.  Also, she has never seen Glee and has no idea who Kirk is.

B00AHSMDQY|4.0|I give this movie 4stars. It was engaging throughout the movie, however some of Bane's lines were muffled at best.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Big fan of Firefly/Serenity.  So sad when it was taken off the air.  Now I can have my Firefly fix whenever I want.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|Watching this movie was like eating that second piece of pie and expecting it to taste as good as the first but it doesn't.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book easy read. I recommend it for any young adult looking to spend the afternoon relaxing in their free time.
B00AMBLDEE|2.0|While the film has some good acting and decent action sequences, the story is a muddled mess that not only fails to advance the Bourne franchise, but manages to diminish the saga.<br /><br />The ending in particular is weak and unsatisfying. The producers were obviously hoping to set up another series, forgetting that audiences need to enjoy the first movie before they'll buy a ticket for the sequel. Take a pass.
B0055SWM08|5.0|The simplicity of the concept for this game is a marvel of elegant design. It is NOT simple to play! The game requires the player to use logic, sequencing, and problem-solving skills to complete each level. This is my latest addicting game! Worth every cent.
1423140591|5.0|I bought this item as a present for my friend's son. The books came as it described. The kid loves them so much.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Just getting into this one.  It took a little getting into it because of the jumping back and forth between characters but partly my fault because because of the little time I'd have to read at first.  More into it now.
B008XG1X18|2.0|This is very hard to use on the Kindle. I would rather be on the www site rather than the mobile ap. I am not a fan of mobile websites.

B004J4WKTW|4.0|I needed to find an audiobook for an assignment in my oral interpretation class, and I chose to rent this book from my local library because I had been meaning to read it anyway. I needed only a small portion (so I could analyze how the narrator differentiated his voice for the various characters and for plain narration). I ended up listening to the whole thing in roughly two days. Jim Dale (who also narrates the Harry Potter series) does a fantastic job. He was what made the experience of The Night Circus magical for me. Based on some of the other reviews, it seems som readers were disappointed with the text, if only because of all the hype, and I suppose I would have found it tedious as well had I not listened to it. I don't usually listen to audiobooks, but that may change after my experience here. Dale does a spectacular job of bringing each of the characters to life, adding in that extra bit of pizzazz some of them might need. I would definitely listen to it again, but I'm not sure I'd read it. If Jim Dale and Erin Morgenstern collaborate in the future, I will look forward to hearing it.
B004U52VPS|5.0|My 5-year-old grandson loves this game.  He was so excited to receive it from Santa and has played it over and over again.

0061564893|4.0|The author has done his homework and presents a case that just maybe - the western world has written history to suit it's own pruposes - and not tell the whole truth.<br />AND - the US should take a lesson from the Chinese in regards to how to establish trade, how to treat foreign peoples, and how not to dominate purely from a militaristic standpoint.<br />What the Chinese tried to do hundreds of years ago - that is  - develop a world wide culture of trade and knowledge, through economic and commercial means vs the Western model of ruthless , barbaric take overs,  looks interestingly like what they're doing now.<br />US beware  - the Chinese have been around for a lot longer - we will become a footnote in comparison to what they  will accomplish in the next 50 years.

B004EPZ03O|4.0|I am a huge Muppet fan so when I saw this in the theater, I knew I'd have to have it.  Nothing will ever compare to the original Muppet Movie and shows, but I really like this one.  There is a scene in what would have been Kermit's office at the studio... very touching as the character was looking around at all the stuff, especially Jim Henson's photo.

B00170DEM8|5.0|We used Instant Video Download to watch this with the entire family. I still love this movie after many years of watching through holidays. Clean, creative, entertaining. Starring one of the best crooners and dancers, it never gets slow or dull. Enjoy!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|What a great voice she has!!  I love all the songs on this CD.  Very enjoyable to listen to over and over!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A must read. You will laugh and cry all on the same page. By far the best book I have ever read.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This is a fun, well balanced film that the whole family enjoys.  It has a few parts that are a bit scary for the youngest kids, but ours love every minute of it.  I've had some friends note that the father seems a bit caricatured, but to me he strikes a good balance of his relationship to his daughter not being the focus of the movie and showing a father that doesn't *really* understand his daughter as she grows up.<br /><br />Overall, highly recommended.
1400052181|5.0|Everyone should read this book .  Henrietta Lacks changed modern.medicine.  She was such.a brave soul!  Sadly most people dont even know who she was .
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I had trouble putting this book down.  I read it much faster than I usually do. I highly recommend it.!!!!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I have owned this game since it was released on a humble bundle for PC a few years ago. This translates very well to a tablet, it will be playable on a smaller screen but some levels might be kinda hard. Some people claim the images aren't game play, and actually every picture has images of game play in them as the smaller images in the pictures.<br /><br />As far as the lack of instructions, read the signs on each level and they will either tell you how to do things or will point you in directions on each level.
B005CRQ2DK|4.0|This book was pretty funny, but I liked the others better. The ending wasn't as good and it didn't make as much sense. But overall I liked it.
0061373877|5.0|I really enjoyed this work, and I enjoyed it particularly as it was read by the author, who does a fantastic job!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Love this series. Can not get enough of it. Hope that Season 3 comes out soooooon. Would recomend others to buy here.
B005LAIIFS|3.0|Saw this movie today because my family wanted to do something different for the holidays. I expected to hate it primarily because I was never raised to believe in any of the characters in it(That's not to say I wasn't familiar with the supposed lore behind at least four of them) and never could understand why parents would ever tell  their children about them but even things you consider stupid can be weaved into a beautifully depicted story. SPOILER ALERT! The main Character is  called Jack Frost, Originally he was a young man born in primitive (Not prehistoric) times who saved his sister from falling through thin ice at the cost of his own life.He is reincarnated  into Jack Frost  but loses his memories of his previous life. All he knows is his name which he claims to know because  the man in the moon told him so. He causes all sorts of mischeif around town with the powers of frost he weilds but can never be seen or felt by any of the children or adults. Later  he discovers that he cannot be seen by  the children because they don't believe in him.  Meanwhile  an ancient evil  reawakens  and begins his plot to eliminate his rivals  by causing children all over the world to cease believing in the easter bunny, Santa, the tooth fairy and the sandman as well as start believing in the boogeyman again. In light of this the man in the moon  elects a reluctant Jack Frost to be a guardian.<br /><br />Enough summary. Now for the reasons I gave this movie three stars amnd not five.<br /><br />Firstly, It blatantly contradicts itself over and over again. The gaurdians  and all other  fairytale helpers are specifically said to exist only as long as they're believed in but both jack and the boogeyman haven't been believed in for over 300 years so why didn't  cease to exist after all that time???. We see immediate  effects when just a few children stop believing in the Easter bunny and the tooth fairy but the boogeyman and Jack have existed pretty long without anyone's belief. I know that people are going to tell me that the belief rule only exists as long as you're a gaurdian but even when Jack was a guardian nobody believed in him until the movie was almost over.<br /><br />Secondly, the movie contradicts it's own supposed message if it even had one. If s something needs to be believed in to exist then it really doesn't exist at all aside from in the mind and yet Jack Frost  and the boogeyman really exist but they don't.  It makes no sense.<br /><br />Thirdly, I like the moon and stars and all but making the man in the moon a diety was a bit much for me. I didn't really care until Jack adresses the audience at the very end of the movie and says.  \\"My name is Jack Frost. How do I know? because the moon told me so. So when the moon tells you something, listen.\\"<br /><br />Really?!!<br /><br />Fourth. The tooth fairys design. Ick. Looks like a cross between a hummingbird, a peacock and a beetle.  She's the tooth fairy for pete's sake. This isn't ex men or fern gully.<br /><br />Aside from that the story is entertaining, the graphics are beautiful and it's a great film.know that people are going to tell me that the belief rule only exists as long as you're a gaurdian but even when Jack was a guardian nobody believed in him until the movie was almost over.<br /><br />Secondly, the movie contradicts it's own supposed message if it even had one.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|I read Fifty before finding this series and I don't regret it because if I had read this first, I would have been disappointed with Fifty. I love the characters in this series, yes BOTH of them with problems, but this time not a virginal unassuming girl but one who takes control, like the rest of us. Also it doesn't pinpoint one particular genre of sex but just the passion of really good sex. Love IT.
B008GAV6YA|3.0|I do read this to my son, however I insert A LOT of my own words (and remove some of the authors) since there are hardly any in the book.  I like that this book is cute and gets the conversation of going potty going while being something fun to do (read).  However there are parts I really don't like.  The baby in the book says they don't want to go potty in the potty.  Why reinforce that in a book about potty training?!  My son wants to use the big boy potty so why would I read him a book that tells him he shouldn't want to?  But I can forgive this and use my own words since the pictures are cute.
B005CA4SQK|5.0|Great gift for someone who loved the series and/or came in season 2, this is the gift to get. Loved the features very in-depth interviews. The black and white pilot was very interesting, looks like the comic in the black/white format.
B002BG6H9O|5.0|I don't like many newer bands. This group is not of the one hit wonder variety. All around enjoyable and will buy the rest based in this album.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Love this series. Can not get enough of it. Hope that Season 3 comes out soooooon. Would recomend others to buy here.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|awesome figure ground game mixed with adventure and puzzle. a bit creepy but good story line. I suggest this game to everyone, go buy it now so you can write a review too.
B0086HGW42|5.0|The songs are perfect. Ed's clear voice gives me goosebumps. The bonus tracks are definitely worth getting. I can't wait to see him in concert.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|again my granddaughter loved it and it was quite entertaining. this was downloaded on her kindle fire and great audio and video.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Loved It, all three discs came intact. Love all the movies and the features are great, especially for the price. A great gift idea for someone who loves Nolan's movies and his take on Batman.
B006O6F932|5.0|My niece loves this house, it is awesome for any girls who love these dolls, (I wish they had Monster High Dolls when I was growing up) the dolls are great and she wanted this school, it is very nice.
B0081SPK0I|5.0|What can I say? Its a racing game with retro Japanese artwork and graphics. It works fine and is fun, so why not download it?
1401234542|5.0|Geoff Johns continues his run into the new 52. New readers beware! This is not a good jumping on point since it pretty much continues<br />the story from \\"The War of the Green Lanterns\\". This book contains Green Lantern issues #1-6.<br /><br />The story starts where War of the Green Lanterns left of. (Spoilers for WotGL) Hal Jordan is no longer a Green Lantern while<br />Sinestro is once again chosen by a Green Lantern ring. The Guardians think this is a chance for redemption so they allow him<br />to keep the ring. Back on Earth,Hal is adjusting to a normal life,which is not really working out for him. Things change for<br />the better/worse when Sinestro visits Hal and asks for his help. Making an offer he can't refuse.<br /><br />The story feels like a classic \\"buddy cop\\" story. Watching Hal and Sinestro interact has always been a blast,and still is.<br />Geoff Johns works his magic as usual,making you care for both characters. Sinestro has become one of my favorite characters<br />in the DC universe, because while being a villain,or rather anti-hero, he has a different view of the world. There is always<br />logic in what usually seems as an act of aggression or terror. While they often disagree there is always dose of mutual respect<br />between the two. The story is a casual read,someone would call it slow, so don't expect to be amazed. I think it was high time<br />for the story to slow down a bit. The guys need a break from all black lantern killing, entity hunting, guardian killing, galaxy<br />saving business. But the story does set up for bigger things to come...<br /><br />Art is done by Doug Mahnke who has proved himself to be THE Green Lantern artist. So nothing but praise there. One issue however<br />was done done by Mark Choi who has a totally different style that just did not fit in. All in all, if you're a fan of John's<br />Green Lantern,look no further.<br /><br />5/5  8.5/10
B001416OXG|5.0|So many songs for such a low price! I think every artist should have a stripped version of their albums; Gavin does such a great job in the acoustic versions of his songs. I like them much more than the original versions.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|Not very funny. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I like the actors and have enjoyed them in other movies, not this one.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|Wonderful movie, reminds you of the good ole days! Wish we could go back to those days and people interacted more!!
B0060D123K|5.0|I love this movie but was very upset that &#34;When Love I Gone&#34; was missing from this version.<br /><br />Otherwise this is one of the best version of a Christmas Carol I have even seen. The mix of Muppet Humor with Dickens story telling makes it a sheer delight. There's no lack of dramatic tension or suspense due to muppetry. It does it all.<br /><br />As stated earlier, my only concern was with the removed song. One of the most beautiful ballads I can remember. Please put it back or make it clear that the song is missing.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|I rented this movie with expectation of a great, mind expanding sci-fi thriller and ended up watching Alien again. If that's what your looking for then buy it! Otherwise, don't waste your time.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love things that relax me because I get so stressed out over school. It is a wonderful app. I love it.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|Good. I love I t. Very f UN. I can't believe it's free. My mom even likes it. Dec get it. You..Will really enjoy it
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Can we just take a moment more like long pause to appreciate how amazing this story is? I've never encountered any book with the same rhythm and feel before, let alone ever been so quickly intrigued. This book and series is a life runnier meaning; you will easily become obsessed and absorbed in its beautiful world. Although I prefer The Infernal Devices I can honestly say that TMI is my first love. So you should buy this book like right now, and watch the teaser trailer for the movie. Just saying as former fan myself.
B005LAIHR2|2.0|I didn't know what to expect from this movie and was surprised at how well it started out. I didn't expect a musical but the beginning reminded me of a rock version of Xanadu. Since I like 80's rock music so well I enjoyed how it started.<br /><br />Then came in Tom Cruise. I loved the music and the way he sang them was excellent. The acting and story line was just bad in my opinion. There wasn't enough depth in the characters and the storyline just seemed to be haphazard in getting the plot across.<br /><br />My opinion is that if you like rock music from the 80's then you should rent the movie as cheaply as possible and buy the CD soundtrack. All of the actors and actresses deserve to be commended for how well they sang. Unfortunately the movie dragged on with no storyline and no real plot and it was too long. Julianne Hough was a bright spot in the movie and I was impressed with her singing, dancing and acting. The girl has talent!<br /><br />I rate this movie 2 stars and the soundtrack as 4 ½ to 5 stars.
B00ARAO720|4.0|This was an above average action flick.  The movie unravels a bit at the end, but it was worth the purchase price.
1400069289|2.0|I find these types of quirky topics interesting - loved Blink, for example.  But this book does not deliver.  The opening pages are interesting, but by mid-way, I'm bored to death.  Rather than stick with the topic and dig into more research, he started stretching organizational problems like arrogant doctors all into habits...ok, then everything is a habit. In addition to the lack of focus and tedium in the middle - oh, my gosh, is this author biased.  Negative comments about businesses making money, snarky comment about Republicans...but praises the passages of Obamacare as a great example of a habit in times of crises. (How is that a habit?)  Here's my new habit:  not reading anything else by this author.
B008HT4FUW|1.0|I bought this thinking it would be the original uk version without half of the scenes being cut out. I feel angry about the false advertising. It is cut and is not the original uk version.  If you want the uncut version I don't know where to get it.  I want my money back, as this was not what it says it is on the packaging.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY IF YOU WANT THE WHOLE EPISODE!
B0013FXWU6|5.0|Seen the movie many times and each time i do I grow to love the movie more. Very well Directed and each actor nails his or her part.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|I am about half way through it and it is very well written and the acting superb!  Enjoyed it thouroughly and it's great that I can just fwd to the next episode if I can't wait to see what happens!
B0081SPK0I|5.0|Game play:<br />As you start the game you can select beginner, normal or expert driving modes.  You also get to select your driver and each one has different skill levels and assets.  I started in the beginner mode to be honest with you to learn the ropes of driving the course.  On the normal mode I rarely got further in than two levels.<br /><br />I found the racing and action to be very good and fun.<br /><br />Main page:<br />* Play game<br />* High scores<br />* Options - set the style of controls that you would like to use, align horizon, accelerator lock, speedometer setting, set the effects and music volumes and reset high score table.<br />* Information - scrolls the credits but it does not work and the text disappears.  It has a link to the developer's web site, Facebook and twitter.<br /><br />What I like:<br />I liked the graphics and they were actually very good for the size of the game.  The racing action was very fun and the controls of the car worked well.  This is a classic auto racing app that is well worth the money.<br /><br />The permissions are acceptable and this is a good game.<br /><br />What I don't like:<br />The only issue is the links to the web, Facebook and twitter.  Turn off your WIFI, turn on your parental controls and let your kids have a turn racing!  Pass the Kindle Fire around and take turns!<br /><br />Summary:<br />This is a good game and you should get it.  If you like racing games then this should be on your list to own for the Kindle Fire.  It is the right size, limited permissions and good racing action.  The price is even right.<br /><br />Size: The uncompressed size is 16.9 MB.<br />Permissions:<br />* System tools - modify system settings - prevent Kindle from sleeping
B007SGLZP8|5.0|An intriguing beginning,easy follow through, and a great finish!  While not his usual type of legal prose centered around actual and/or controversial issues, Grisham's talent as a writer shines through yet again!
B002LFAHBO|5.0|Alan Rickman made the movie.  He is the weapon of mass seduction!  Love all of his movies.  He is a keeper!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Best book I've ever read. Life changing, it seriously makes you think about who you are and what the important things in life.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was much better than the first two books from Colleen Hoover that I read.  It is not for everyone though.  I happen to like to read about people with dark sides and problems.  It was heartbreaking at times.  You really felt for Sky and Holder.  The author really did a nice job of meshing the story together.  I would recommend this book.  It is unfortunate that is has to do with molestation, but its a good angsty read.
B003UBTX6S|3.0|A disappointing sequel... After such an exciting end to beautiful creatures I was anxious to continue to follow Lena's battle between good and evil. Beautiful darkness was very slow and at times, boring. despite the disappointment,I still do recommend the read . the book did have it's moments and I do enjoy the old tales of the caster world.
B005LAIGRS|5.0|This isi one great movie.  Denzel certainly delivers.  The action scenes are wonderful and the movie never gets boring. This is a must see!
B000JQTWPO|5.0|I really enjoyed this novel.  It is a rather clever story with interesting characters and historical perspectives. A fun and interesting novel!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Having read many books on the subject, I found this one to be most compelling because it was written from a scientific standpoint.
B0057RCFQS|5.0|I enjoyed watching the bonus material showing how they made the dinosaurs so that they weren't as scary as watching the film. It was surprising how they did some of the things they did...like using the side of a parking ramp for the sharp side of the mountain in II, where Julianna Moore is hanging by a thread about ten feet above the blue foam pads. Very interesting.
B00908DDZM|5.0|Macklemore isn't a genius (at least not yet) but this is a really good album. Lots of good tracks, well produced and edited.<br /><br />There are shades of Eminem, Ludacris, and Kanye amongst others in here. Lots of good musical backgrounds and energy. There are serious songs, sombre ones, fun ones, energetic ones, and they all come together in a pretty cohesive way.<br /><br />The thing for me that sets this album apart is that the lyrics are not only catchy and clever, but in addition to being at times lovely AND entertaining, they are almost always intelligent, wide-ranging, and have lots of depth.<br /><br />This album has lots of fun and flash, but it is at its core a smartly dressed, charming album of real substance.<br /><br />My copy, while not being marked as such, is explicit. There is no good excuse to get this album in a clean version, and I was really pleased to find that I got the entire and original album as intended.
0439023513|5.0|great
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Having seen all the prior Batman movies,  I  must say this one had the best plot. As usual the special effects are realistic; This one stands out in the series, because of the depth of the plot. The film  has a main plot which is the usual good vs Evil, however there are several sub-plots and each is developed fully and resolved at the end in ways that leave you waiting for the next film.
B003L77G6A|5.0|My whole family totally loves this series!  We watch this series every chance we get!  And it is funny every time we watch it!
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|This was a great movie and ends one of the best trilogies out there. I would definitely watch this again. I can only imagine what it looks like on Blu-Ray.
B004YXE438|5.0|I love this game! Its addicting! Defiantly worth the 99 cents. It gives you several fun puzzles from easy to medium to extra hard! Great for kids and adults. My children take over my Kindle like a piece of candy just to solve a puzzle. 5 stars!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Habit forming game. It is hard to wait on the coins to reload.  I have introduced several people to this entertainment.
0439023483|5.0|great
B003DZX3SA|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my girlfriend and she really loves it. A nice case and a good price.
B0033807C2|5.0|This was the most popular stories about Percy Jackson and I think that if you really like myths Greek and Roman than you will love this book
B004P12SSW|5.0|Excellent!Cher and Chrisina out did themselves! Definately a must see movie!  order it right now!  GREAT! Great great! GReat Great!!!!!
159562015X|3.0|If you are going to purchase this book don't purchase it used. You need an access code to take the assement and without the code the book is basically worthless. The whole point is to take the online assesment and then read in more detail about your results. Every access code is unique to each individual so you can't use an old code. If you really want to buy this book buy it new. The online assesment is really cool.
B007M45PMU|4.0|An overall enjoyable album with a few very catchy hits especially Ho Hey. The prominent bass makes you want to stomp your foot, clap your hands or drum your fingers along with the song. Flapper Girl and Stubborn Love are also two favorites. I find myself constantly skipping Classy Girls with its rather tuneless/moaning opening, but the rest of the album is quite good.
B0081SPK0I|5.0|Quick download and install on kindle fire. Graphics are clean and as others have said very 80s. Controls are very simple and responsive. If you want to hit a tree or guardrail at 150 mph this is the game for you.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|I am so sick of you boneheads out there knowing your product is being used by kids and yet you take no responsibility to screen your ads or your product. Video gamers are the worst. No wonder we have 20 dead kids in Conn. Your messing with young brains still filled with mush not to mention the ones with mental problems.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|Great movie not as good as the 2nd which ranks as one of the all time great action movies.<br />My problem with this version is the ultraviolet digital copy which just does not work. If you're like me you remember digital copy when heading out on a trip and enjoy having movies on the road on your ipad etc. UV makes you create two separate accounts (UV and flixter- the latter probably sells your movie interests to marketing companies). Then after that long process you log into flixter to start the download (while packing bag etc) and find that the movie you just signed up for in UV isn't registered yet. Last movie I had took 2 weeks to show up in my account ready for download.<br />It should not take longer to download a movie than it does to fly to Hollywood, go to the movie studio buy the DVD and fly home. Boycott Ultraviolet until they relent and go back to iTunes
B005LAIHR2|1.0|When I played the DVD, the music played fine.  But when there was supposed to be dialog or solos, there was nothing. All previous DVDs on that player that day played fine.  This DVD was crap.  There is only one in the box so that must be the &#34;digital copy&#34;.  I want my money back.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|this is a great game, keeps u engaged throughout. keep them coming. it is little puzzle adventure journey and i have been enjoying it by far.
B0086DBE62|4.0|Very nice movie.  It was nice to see the two cast members from Shorty's Pit Bull Rescue playing a big role in a movie.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Downloaded and installed on kindle fire with no problems. I usually stay away from the physics games but the name and reviews caught my attention. After playing a few levels I can understand why players would pay $4.99 for this game. It is very addicting. Very happy that it was the game of the day for Christmas. Thanks Amazon. It was a good present.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|This Angry Bird spin-off is a lot of fun and very addictive. Ads make me crazy, but I could spend the $$ to get the ad free version. The best is trying to build the piggies &#34;wheels&#34;.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|As a NYC policeman & and a four year sailor USN 1959 - 1963 Thank your lucky stars for The Seals
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I love all of FOLLET's books, he is so good at creating the fictional characters and putting them into real historical events.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Good book, funny good kid novel!<br />Please read book, very funny series to.. I suggest reading all books'. Have fun with the book
B006KX3GXO|1.0|Downloaded for my kindle fire HD and the camera function shows me upside down on screen. Is this a glitch? Too bad since the app itself has some neat functions.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Everyone in the family loved this movie even the 12 month old was attracted to the colors and songs. Dad even sat and watched!
B003UESJH4|5.0|I love this movie and am already sharing it and looking forward to seeing it again.  It is a classic to me.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|While this is not the typical sound you would expect from a soundtrack, the rawness of the tracks is hauntingly beautiful.
B000VHMF0A|5.0|Best 100 pennies I ever spent. Have to love amazon when they do deals like this. Don't know how they do it? But I wish they would do it more often.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Didn't think I would like this third book and I didn't for about the first five chapters. Afterwards, it's the fifty shades I have grown to like in the last week and a half I was introduced and read the series. Thank you for enticing me in the first book and never letting go of my curiosity and answering so many damn questions I have had since page one, book one
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I am really loving this series and can't wait for the next one. I am a reading addict and don't really leave feedback often but i had to give this one 5stars! If you haven't read it yet, please do!
B0081SPK0I|5.0|Love this game! Great way to kill some time whenever - super fun and never seems to get old. Works great on my GS3!
B000QCTNIW|4.0|The advances being made in contemporary neurology and related disciplines are mind-boggling and astounding.-- and are largely unknown to the public, or indeed to the medical profession.  (I am, as they say,\\"a stroke victim;\\" In the most advanced neurological hospital in Paris, no one ever talked to me about the incredible discoveries discussed in this book.)<br /><br />Dr. Doidge thus provides us with a wealth of amazingly interesting information.<br /><br />Unfortunately Dr. Dodge is NOT a good writer. His prose is frequently turgid, convoluted and overly-technical.<br /><br />But in my view, the game is worth the candle. The information presented is so fascinating that it is worth struggling through Dr. Doidge's murky and off-putting prose in order to get his message.<br /><br />I recommend the book highly. Dr, Doige will teach you  ASTONISHING things!
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|best angry birds yet.. hd version is better and worth the money.. i play this one never since i bought the hd version..
B008MG1E4A|1.0|From reading the reviews of this book I thought it would be a good read.  However, only one chapter in this book is interesting.  The others are boring so it ended up being a quick read and a waste of money ($12.99).  Oh, well.
B005QBBCMI|5.0|Ok....it's dark...live with it. One of the best movies in its class. It's got a little of everything. But best of all is the  great directing and fantastic acting.  This would have to be to support this story.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|Some movies never get old and this is one of them. Had reservations about the colorized very of this classic but it is very well done.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|so good. No justice, no rules, and no one is safe. The mystery will force you to watch in one sitting,
B0091REZMW|2.0|I love hidden object games,but I bought this one to have on my Kindle Fire. The graphics were just too small to be seen easily, even on zoom. and when the game was in &#34;night mode&#34; it was almost impossible to see the objects on the smaller screen.I might have liked the game if I had played it on a bigger screen, but it really wasn't very interesting to me.
B00AECDDYY|5.0|I this is a really awesome game no problems it is simple and easy. If you like pirate ships you would be in to this game
B0053O89RY|4.0|Purchased for a gift, it was what my son-in-law requested.  And it met our expectations, he will enjoy it a lot!!

B005LAIH4A|4.0|We enjoyed this movie, that's why we purchased the DVD. The disk was not playable in our DVD player though, so it's a bummer. I am sure the problem is with the DVD player - it's old.
B004QX07G4|4.0|Ellen is always funny in my book. And she is here too. She also can give some good advice. Loved it!
B0071LHADQ|3.0|I won't say anything about the music : you can read other reviews for the same album (other releases) elsewhere on Amazon.<br />My comment is about this particular release.<br /><br />I was looking for the best sound quality for this album : I wanted to avoid the first release (taken from a vinyl copy), as well as the most common Rock-Fever (also taken from vinyl and semi-legit release). The only edition taken from a master tape is out of print and reach considerable price, when you're able to find it.<br /><br />So I was really expecting this to be the definitive edition of this album : with the replica of the orginal sleeve, and the sound taken from the master tape...<br /><br />It is NOT ! The LP miniature replica is great, but the CD itself is the Rock Fever release ! It's a bit misleading : only the sleeve has changed, but inside, you find the CD with the Rock-Fever reference...
B007V5CF5K|4.0|Great game, amazing graphics, very entertaining. Buy this one if you want to have a few hours of great fun.
B0053O89Z6|4.0|Purchased it as a gift for my son-in-law.  He requested this DVD specifically, and he will enjoy watching it very much!

B0036TGSIK|4.0|Funny film.  Nice feature debut by Emma Stone.  She is both charming and funny, and captures that awkwardness of high school very well.
B0084U0IEG|3.0|While the idea behind the story was intriguing, the actual story didn't live up to the potential of the storyline.

B005SFS4ZU|5.0|If you love Phantom  you will love this.  Not only do you get an amazing performance of the Opera but you also get to see what they did after the performance.  Sarah Brightman comes out and sings with many of the past Phantoms.
B00632HWOG|2.0|Needs a complete re_do. The recent changes they made is entirely unacceptable. It takes three times longer to type a simple email. If I type a word correctly, it changes the word to what it WAnts . A real 100 % pain in the neck.

B000UR9T8C|4.0|Great movie. Its my personal favorite and was my sons until the new version with Andrew Garfield. I'd definitely recommend it.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Everything is high quality and brand new. Just like purchasing a CD from a music store. Plus, Lindsey's amazing violin playing is a wonderfull soundtrack to have for anyone who appreciates the violin.
B004ULEEY8|5.0|Outstanding quality blu-ray disc. The movie itself: loads of action, aliens, and a great cast of characters. Although entirely fictitious, I appreciate the representation of the soldiers as self-sacrificing for others.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This app is crap.  You can only see about 5 posts, when you scroll down, the older posts are all messed up and illegible.<br /><br />Boo.

B0087JTAKW|4.0|I could go on about how I enjoy all of his books, but this one struck me in a different way. The topic, the choice of words, the characters, and the truth that this book offers is truly rewarding. Another simple, but pleasurable read. Bravo

140053271X|3.0|My child already has a gaming system so she doesn't need anything for apps so this was the right thing for her. It is only for reading.She loves to read and this encourages that wonderful hobby. I am going to order the light that attaches to it though because it is harder to see than my nook color.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It may have been a bit slow going at first, but the end sells me on the story through and through.
B005D0RDIE|5.0|I was at this concert the dvd is the exact same. I been a Rush fan for 30 yrs. an counting.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|First of all, let me just say how beautiful the graphics are in this game! It's a treat just looking at the detail in the tiles! And the Colors! Wonderful! Even the sound effects are cool! The music is also soothing, though I turned it off. But I always turn off the music in games. Too distracting for my already beleaguered brain!<br /><br />Having said that, I must say that this game is great fun! It keeps me coming back for more! It's a bit stressful at times trying to race that clock---but it's Good stress! In my opinion, Treasures of Montezuma 3 is well worth the teeny, tiny price!
B000MQC9H4|5.0|Excellent movie  I would highly recommend it.  It is a great movie.  It has a variety of moods which is a plus
B0041KVW2K|5.0|I'm not sure why it seems every other person on here has had bad luck with this set and it's very unfornate. I received this as a Christmas gift and I couldn't be happier. I'm a young Beatles fan at the age of 22 but my set makes everything complete and I absolutely love the sound. Personally, I like the pops and clicks you hear on records. That's what makes them records. If I didn't want that authentic sound then I would've bought the CD's. So far, I have had no problems with this and I will treasure this for as long as I live.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|We could not wait to see Ted! The commercials were hilarious, and we had already seen \\"The Thunder Song\\" on YouTube. So, we expected to be laughing a LOT. Unfortunately, we were sorely disappointed, as most of the funny parts were shown in the commercials. I could not believe how BAD the jokes were. They fell so flat it was almost embarrassing to watch. We didn't even finish the movie. Couldn't tolerate it.<br />Waste of time and money!! Unbelievably boring!
0802473156|5.0|Our Pastor told us almost 15 years ago to read this book together and THEN he would marry us.  OH my what a wonderful book this is and it has helped us understand each other in ways we would have never know before reading this book. I just bought it for my son and his girlfriend.. I recommend it to anyone.. Married or not married. It helps you understand yourself and your mate and what each of you need to feel loved.
140053271X|4.0|I just got this device yesterday for Christmas and I love it! The only downfall is that I cannot connect directly to Overdrive to borrow books from the library. I have to download the books from the library on the computer and then transfer them to the nook.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I tried my best to put Harry Potter out of mind when reading Casual Vacancy, trying to let it stand on its own without any baggage or expectations; yet the book is powerfully influenced by the Harry Potter legacy, in that Rowling -- now writing a novel purely for the adult audience -- is able to do all the things a decade of writing \\"all ages\\" novels precluded her from doing.<br /><br />So the book is filled from its early pages with swearing and sex and awful people wreaking horrible emotional, and sometimes physical, havoc on each other, described in ten-dollar words when a two-dollar would do fine. I'm not opposed in the slightest to \\"bad\\" words or sexuality in literature, nor do large words inherently put me off, but Rowling seems to do these things less because they're warranted in the story being told and more just to show she can. Ironically, her attempts to prove herself an author capable of more mature fare -- if that's indeed what happened here -- have resulted in a considerably less mature novel than the children's series for which she is so renowned. It comes off less as the work of a literary giant wielding a mastery of the craft, and more a teenage girl at a strict countryside high school scrawling swear words and smutty doodles in her notebook, relishing the naughtiness in her acts of petty rebellion.<br /><br />The story might have been more enjoyable had it been more satirical, juxtaposing a stuffy, pompous Britishness of the characters with their small, mean inequities for some dark humor. But at no point does the novel allow the prim and proper facade to gain any traction, immediately and constantly calling it out for its hypocrisy, usually by jumping (sometimes a bit too quickly) from one point of view character to another as they all quietly despise each other. Lacking satirical bite, the venom-soaked proceedings are simply unpleasant to read.<br /><br />If this book has any redeeming value, let's hope it's that Rowling has purged herself of allthis pent-up, unnecessary vulgarity, and that her next book will be less insecure, more balanced, and above all else, something enjoyable to read again.
B00005S6K8|5.0|It is a great movie  I like Harrison Ford's part in this.  I would recommend it highly and would buy it again  Have watched it several times and enjoy it more and more
B000ZMVAXO|5.0|This Vox HDphone amp is a  great tools for jamming with headphones and still getting some really good crunch out of your guitar!
B00797MB0O|1.0|Only gave it one star because there is no option for zero. Horrible movie. Mean and dark. Waste of time.
B008L40Q7E|5.0|I really enjoyed this book!! This was my first 007 read. I can't wait to read more in the series. I have loved the movies all my life and now can't wait to read the rest of the books! A Bond fan MUST experience the literary 007!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It was a great ending. Finally were able to get to the bottom of Fifty's weirdness. Anastasia was a godsend for him.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Was not the best s.k.book I have read but was good ! Makes you think about your impact in your time on this earth.
B00003CXSM|5.0|Have watched this movie so many times and still enjoy it every time I watch it.  It is a decent movie and has some funny parts in that all can relate to.  Would definitely recommend it
B000ZJTPLG|5.0|Works great! I plug in my Strat or LP and put in the headphones and jam away! Good tone and a nice bit of distortion for some bite! Keeps everyone else happy too - they can't hear me screamin' on my guitar!! :)
B0052GACNM|5.0|This is truly a work of art.  The incredible talent of Tony Bennett collaborated with the voices of many other also talented singers is amazing!  I've never purchased anything by Tony until I heard this CD.  Thank you for this wonderful music in an era where the lyrics are sung so fast that I have no idea what was just said.
0525953728|5.0|This was a fast and easy read. Very detailed account, felt like I was there the while time. I recommend to any history or action guru.
030758836X|5.0|I'm sure you've heard of this book. Buy it. I'm not a book reviewer but can pretty much say you'll be surprised a number of times as you read it. Saying more would reveal too much.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Wow so much the same as the movie but a little  different  because u saw the movie before I read the book
B00005JPSM|3.0|I bought it and have watched it but not really like it  I don't think I would buy it again
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Having purchased this book while looking for a different perspective on the Zombie genre, I got exactly what I was looking for.  The author caught the human struggle perfectly and what a war against Zombies would actually \\"mean\\".  It was kind of slow in some parts, but the interviews were amazingly well done. There were aspects of a war affected that you wouldn't even think about...K9, scuba divers, etc... that really drew me in.  Highly recommend this book for lovers of horror and especially the Zombie genre.  Good work Mr. Brooks
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|Same old same old story with the good guy underdogs and the bad government. Lots of explosions, destruction, shooting, and nasty view of the future interspersed with a little dialogue. Not enough time and effort spent on the concept of reality versus memory and perception. Predictable...
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|Really has a lot of fun with game! Loves taking care of pets, without having to have REAL pets. The animations are great
B009SQRL4U|3.0|My wife and I watched this one evening, and we found ourselves entertained by the story line and the humor.
B003INBOAG|4.0|Behind Enemy Lines is a great movie.  Unfortunately, it was the only movie on the disk.  Very disappointing.<br />I will think long and hard before buying another double dvd, after this experience.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This was a very funny movie... Fat Amy was great!<br />If you like Glee and comedies is the movie for you
B008KE3960|5.0|This game is a lot of fun, and the graphics are well done.  You will need to make adjustments to your defense as you see the worsening advance of tanks starting to get through your initial patrols.  Thanks for this game!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game is very fun and highly addictive I have been playing for hours and still am not tied of it. I love this game!
B0091XRPTQ|5.0|Delightful Christmas Classic- makes you feel like a believer in Santa Claus again! Beautiful animation and a wonderful visual experience!
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Very very good movie. Awesome story line great acting. The trailers did not do this movie justice. If you saw trailers for this movie and thought oh it is going to be like avatar or Star Wars think again. 10 out of 5 stars.
0345803507|5.0|Books came packaged nicely.  Amazing story.  I struggled with the first book but am glad I continued to the 2nd and 3rd ones.
B008Y67LEK|4.0|I enjoyed The Bell Jar because I'm interested in Sylvia Plath and her poetry, etc.  However, if you have no personal interest in this author, I can't say that you'll enjoy the book.  What I found interesting is that she took the experiences of the main character from her own life's experiences; therefore, you get an insight into Ms. Plath's personal life and also insight into how mental patients were treated in her time.  Since I've always been intrigued by the human condition & it's attendant psychology, although books such as The Bell Jar are not my usual fare, it kept me there with the main character in a personal way.  Also, I've always appreciated writing talent.  Ms. Plath IS TALENTED.  I found her style unlike anything I've previously read and yet very efficient and effective.  I enjoyed her use of words and turn of phrases, some of which were very new to me.  As for subject matter, however, if you're prone to depression, I wouldn't recommend it.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This was purchased by me for a Christmas gift that was requested.  I have not seen it, but the recipient was happy to get it.
B007704HO6|5.0|I love it when things just seem to appear in ones life out of the blue.  Much like Bob in James life this book appeared in my life.
B0086700CM|3.0|i have trouble keeping up the fast pace with this game.maybe with more practice i will improve. not one of my favorites.
B002ZG980U|5.0|In the beginning of the movie, you'll probably be confused on all sides. I had no idea what was going on until later when the character played by Ellen Page showed up. Then everything was explained and the plot really picked up.<br /><br />Inception provides a new way to look at dreams and has a very original plot.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|I wish I had!  This classic is worth your time--the quality of language puts so many modern novels to shame, and each adventure is a delightful story on its own.  Put them all together, and you have a delightful way to spend many hours:)
B009JBZH54|3.0|I love these movies. In my opinion, this is the new Star Wars trilogy. These movies took visual storytelling to a new place, while at the same time telling a great story.<br /><br />Everyone else has already covered the good, so I'll get right to the bad. I received this set as a Christmas gift and immediately watched Dark Knight Rises. Thrilling. But I was constantly adjusting the volume because it goes up and down drastically throughout the film. It would go down in odd places, where it seemed like it might have been an intentional choice on the part of the director to make everything get really quite, but it got so quiet that I had to adjust the volume to hear the dialogue at all (for example, when Batman first fights Bane in the sewers).<br /><br />So, do I love these movies? Yes. Would I recommend this product? No. It's possible that I'm missing something, and that this is somehow a problem with my equipment and not with the product, but Prometheus plays just fine. In fact, this is the only time I've had this problem since the original Highlander DVD.
0345803485|1.0|If this qualifies for making the bestseller lists, it doesn't say much for bestseller lists. Put me in with the people who rated it a one. The dialogue is pathetically juvenile, and it is a stretch to say the prose qualifies as writing. It is more stream-of-consciousness rambling of totally implausible main characters. There are so many flaws that have already been cited in other reviews it would be redundant to enumerate them here.<br />I struggled through as much as I could but finally abandoned it, there are more worthy titles that need attention. Sufficient to say, I won't even attempt parts two and three of the trilogy. Reading this was instructive though, it is a reminder to be wary of the junk that qualifies for bestseller lists.
B0083SBMBM|1.0|After all the hoopla with top reviews this is definitely a big let down: It's a boring cliche ridden bunch of trash! Don't waste your time with this clunker! If you want to see a great new action movie get one of the best James Bond movies ever made Skyfall.
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|I'm not a big Richard Ford fan, but this one had me hooked early on with great characters a compelling story and real insight into living a life filled with uncertainty -- in some ways, reminded me of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.
B004LWZW4W|5.0|I did not expect James Franco to act so &#34;well&#34; in this movie. It beats out the Spiderman movies and Milk by a longshot.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I liked everything about this book.  it helped me understand better what our military do and how they think and the equipment they have at thier disposal.  We do not always get told what the military does and this book made me feel more secure in a nonsecure world.  Thank you all for what you do.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|-you can't beat it--10 years of her best songs. She has the best voice around in my opinion.<br />great words in great songs.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It is ultra addicting and fun. A very good, free game.  I would recommend it to all my friends.  Glad I got it.
B007REV4T8|5.0|What a GREAT movie! This highly entertaining flick has a lot of action and class. This is definitely Daniel Craig's best film and is easily one of the finest Bond movies ever made. DON'T MISS IT!
B002NZTZ8S|1.0|This movie is just plain weird. It's literally the kind of movie you'll watch as a kid, grow up and look back 20 years later and say, \\"man, what was that one creepy Christmas movie i saw as a kid????\\" There are no comforting Christmas elements in this movie. Although it starts out with an interesting premise, it is strange that the train guy doesn't know the first thing about babysitting kids. Why would Santa hire this guy to pick up children???? And the near death experiences riding on the train, once again, begs the question, what is wrong with Santa endangering the lives of children? The dancing waiters, creepy. The elves, creepy. The fact that they wore red instead of the traditional green---creepy. The way they talk, and express themselves \\"do you trust me?\\", the crazy industrialized north pole, just none of it seems Christmas-y to me. Mind you , there's no Mrs. Santa Clause either, and what was Steve Tyler doing as a singing elf??? Just plain dumb.<br /><br />The only good thing was the whole concept of the bell, which could have been developed throughout the movie, pressing on the theme of belief, but seriously, if i were that kid, i would rather not believe.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Aside from the Avengers, this movie does a very good job in movie work. Bane is that fearless villain that will do anything to get what he wants.<br /><br />I even find this better than both Batman Begins and The Dark Knight (both of which I also own). The storyline is especially one to pay attention to because it relies HEAVILY on Batman Begins. You should know who Ra's Al Ghul is before watching or re-watching because only then will it make sense.<br /><br />Such a great movie series and a great movie to end it all.
B004WR125O|1.0|I bought this item because when I get my receiver I saw it on the &#34;People that bought this item also bought this&#34;, but when I tried to use it it did not work...

B006FO3ERQ|5.0|This is a wonderful book and a fast read with wonderful characters.  It led to a terrific Book Club discussion with our group.  I bought  a second Richard Ford book and consider myself his fan.

B001GWK2MC|1.0|Poor quality, my son bounced in this house for 1 week then it ripped right at the seam, could not even be fixed if I wanted to fix it.
B004EPYZV2|5.0|I haven't seen any of the Mission Impossible movies in years and this really picks up on the action. It has humor, action, suspense, thrills, anything to please you. There's no reason why you shouldn't get this.
B00005N6RU|1.0|I was very excited.to play.the movie when I received it. I went to playthe movie and.it said cannot.play not.in the correct.zone
B005UD1D62|5.0|I loved all of Lauren Conrads books before and this one was not a disappointment! She's great! I read this book over Christmas break and couldn't put it down! Can't wait to go home and read Starstruck.
0060245867|5.0|It is the cute, fun, creative, and easy to read story I remember from my youth. Both my boys love it and it will be a major player in bedtime for a long time to come!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book was the perfect conclusion to the trilogy. I wish the writing style had been better so many careless errors.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Every great once in a while a book comes along that really clicks; this is one.  The plot line was clever and brilliant.  The stories; compelling.  Dialogue  witty and syntax matches the era.  It'll be difficult to pick up another book for several weeks - the story will have to stop running through my head before I can let another one in.
B006OITIQE|4.0|I'm not a hardcore One Direction fan but this album is pretty good.There's one or two songs that I really enjoy and because I got this on a very cheap sale, I would say it was definitely worth my money.

B007STBUIW|5.0|So clear, it is mezmerizing.  It is comparable to a new release that you would watch on BR.  I have been waiting for this release and it did not disappoint.  Sound and extra features are great too.

B000PMG16U|5.0|I was so excited to get this trilogy in Blu-ray. My series is complete now. I'm such a sic-fi geek I couldn't wait to get my hands on this. :-)
B00AGH6FD8|5.0|Home Alone 2 follows a similar pattern as the first one except this time Kevin catches the wrong flight and ends up in NYC.  There are many similarities to the first movie.  The same two burglars are involved trying to rob a toy store, Kevin works to out smart them, and then there is the mysterious character that Kevin is at first scared of and then becomes friends with (In the first movie it was the man with the shovel and in this one it is the lady who feeds the penguins).  Some of the humor is a little more exaggerated than the first one such as when the parents awake out of bed to find they are late they run to the end of their bed and scream.  Secondly, the traps for the criminals were not as realistic, as a normal human being would not be able to survive many of these traps.  Third, there is a little mistake, in the first Home Alone Kevin was 8, in this one he says he is 10, however, the mother refers to the last incident (what we see in the first one) as happening \\"last year.\\"  This doesn't take away from the humor in the movie; it's just funny to catch these things.  Of course, this movie is made better with the acting of Tim Curry.  I just about died laughing when he gets down on his knees and says \\"I love you\\" due to one of Kevin's tricks.  The meaning of this movie is pretty much the same as the first movie in that we should not take our family for granted.  It also shows that our initial prejudices may be wrong as Kevin befriends a woman that he was afraid of.  Home Alone 2 is good for those who are looking for humor and meaning and a movie to sit down and watch as a family.  Perhaps this movie is a little violent at times for young children.    [...]

B008Y2FRFO|3.0|This game is fun but you run out of coins too quickly. I'm glad I'm not using real money. you have to wait for more coins to play again. Its fun if your patient.
0452282152|5.0|this is a must read for all those who are interested in the northern european artist vermeer.  it is a work of fiction but it is somewhat historical.
B0091LS07E|4.0|I love Alicia Keys debut album and this Girl on Fire<br />Track 1 until track 4 is totally describe the album cover.
B001P829VY|5.0|We don't need no stinking badges!<br /><br />If you don't know what I'm talking about then you know nothing about classic movies.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Everything about this HBO miniseries is outstanding.  If you're into American history, you'll love this series.  And if you're not into American history, this just might change that.  Yeah, it's that good.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Loved the film. The storytelling was great for emotional attachment. For us females and the action & graphics was awesome, which men can enjoy. Must admit Alfred put tears in my eyes. Awesome BATMAN!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book. I loved the characters, the compelling story line, and the love and the hot sexual interactions of the couple. It is one of the best stories I have read.I hope she writes a follow up book on these 2 characters!! I laughed, I felt worried, I felt  sorry, I felt everything! Great Book!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Didn't really know what to expect when I decided to really this book. Truth be told, I ha  just received my kindle for Christmas AN  unwanted to really  something on it. I read the entire book in on  sitting, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. A wonderful read.
B009B4ZEKM|4.0|The outstanding song in this album is Blank Page.<br /><br />Christina should release Blank Page as third single and Let There Be Love as fourth single.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|Really wish it had Don't Care About Us but still a superb album to have. I love it! I bought a used one from a library through Amazon.  The case was a bit more worn than expected but the CDs play fine, & liner notes (cover) were old but intact so that's really all I needed. An MJ must have!
1451695187|5.0|Proof of Heaven: A Neurosurgeon's Near-Death Experience and Journey<br /><br />I believe in the NDE's and it is great to read that a noted neureosurgeon believes in them also.  Not only believes but has survived and wrote about it.<br /><br />.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I really like this headset. When talking on skype the background noise is completely eliminated, including TV and annoying siblings. The sound is excellent and the voice morphing is fun. I would highly recommend these to any gamer. The wireless is awesome too.
B001F6TXME|3.0|Yes I got this to be used in my Nikon D800, but when I went to use it I found that this works only in the D800 if you have the Nikon GPS, because it fits there only<br /><br />Apart from that the product look grate
B008KOTNVA|5.0|These are all the small screw heads you might ever need. The quality is reasonable, not German, Japanese or US, but since not a lot of strength is required to remove these size of screws or nuts, it works. I can recommend this set, complete and useful.
B000JMKTLO|1.0|I liked Gone Girl enough to hunt up another book by the author.  What a disappointment. In it the author wrote unnecessary disgusting descriptions.  It is amazing to me, encouraging though for writers, that her following book, Gone Girl, was so much improved.  In the latter, she did not feel the need to shock and disgust to carry a point. She must have had a far better editor.
B004FN1T3A|2.0|I bought this thinking I would give it a shot.  I'm pregnant with my 3rd child and tried different methods with the first two.  I got about halfway through and had to put it down.  It's complete nonsense.  Yes, most people could give birth unassisted if they had to, but it is certainly not pain-free.  Her examples about animals and people in comas are nonsense.  I would not recommend it.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Not as exciting as the other two  books in the series.  The series was good however and I enjoyed them all to some degree.
B001EN71HC|5.0|Purchased for my husband. Wonderful set. You won't be sorry. Funny. If you loved the Austin powers series, why not get the set.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I can't put this game down!!! I've been playing for hours. No other mystery game holds a candle to this game!!!
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|I thought the movie was creative and pretty entertaining.  It's too long, so I started to fall asleep after two hours (yes, I am turning into an old man).
B0018OASZE|5.0|Received this vinyl record in great time and perfect condition. I absolutely love it and the sound is great. It works perfectly. Thanks!
B0053Q9DHW|4.0|If you are wanting an accurate portrayal of Charlotte Bronte's novel you will be disappointed.  There are just too many important details missing.  (To be honest, I think if you were not at all familiar with the story it would be very hard to follow.)  I certainly think that the BBC version from the 1980s is a much better retell, and the actors more suited to the characters in appearance.  And I don't think anyone will ever better Timothy Dalton's portrayal of Mr Rochester - absolutely brilliant!  Having said that, it is a lovely movie.  The scenery and costumes are beautiful, but I think the feature that really makes this movie is the soundtrack, which is worth buying in its own right.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Thought this was a good follow-up to the first book and like the way it ended.  All three were good books.
0756407125|5.0|One of the best and most unique story telling authors I have read. I may be crucified for saying it, and it was not as epic, but able to sit on the same shelf as Tolkien in my house.<br />Best read all year.
B00A12VJZM|5.0|Great selections at a fantastic price. Just around 12 cents a song. Much pricier if tis was purchased at the iTunes store. DRM free makes it a no brainer.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|What a picture, the sights and sounds draws you right into the action. I received this in really fast time and am very satisfied with the purchase.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is way better than I thought it would be I was at the edge of my seat the hole story
B00AMBH70S|4.0|I liked it but the chase scenes were ridiculously long and far too frequent. It felt like filler - I would have rather had the story and dialogue connect more to the earlier movies than watch at least 30 minutes of chase scenes.
B009VLXMJA|5.0|Love it I recommend it to any one that enjoys country music. Taylor knocks it out of the park with this one.
1450419895|5.0|The important knowledge on strength training in this book is jaw dropping.  Aside from knowledge on proper nutrition, its all you need to get started.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|touches nice ...this product makes kindle fire hd look like a real notebook! Now I can carry my device everywhere and looks like a diligent student always have a notebook with me hhaa
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Easy setup, many many features, and high quality.<br /><br />First of all you'll notice when you take it out of the box that it's pure quality materials. The slightly grippy rubberized coating, the braided cable--you can tell it will last years.<br /><br />Once you install the software you'll see what this thing can really do.<br />Every key can be mapped to any number of things, ranging from left click, to any keyboard button, to changing the DPI, and even returning to the desktop. It's all so customize-able it's crazy! One button can even simulate pressing two buttons at once. You can choose a polling rate from 125Hz, 250Hz, 500Hz, and 1000Hz. You have full range of DPI adjustments, and you can change between 4 different settings on-the-fly (and two profiles to switch through. Making 8 seperate DPI settings)<br /><br />And now my favorite part: You can change the back light color to any color you like, and even change the \\"breathing speed\\" which is like a pulse or heartbeat. Unfortunately it can't change the other indicator and mouse-wheel lights, but it still looks pretty darn cool.<br /><br />There is also a little compartment underneath the mouse for adding the included weights, so whether you like your mouse light or heavy, you can customize that too.<br /><br />All in all, there are only a few things I could think of to improve this mouse, and they're in no way deal breakers, especially at this price point and with all these other features:<br /><br />1. Mousewheel and front indicator lights cannot be changed. They are blue and only blue.<br />2. The macro feature cannot simulate mouse movement, only mouse clicks or keyboard button presses. Still cool though.<br />3. Finally, and this is just a little something: I wish it had a mouse-wheel tilt feature. I had that on my old logitech mouse and I miss it. But with so many other extra buttons I'm sure I'll get over it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It made me laugh, cry, and even everything in between. It did easily the best book I've read in the past year. Being a 16 year old, I recommend it to anyone near my age and I think adults would love it as well. It is so universal that anyone could like it.
B0017ANAZO|4.0|not as good as the original , but deserves a bowl of popcorn ,it's a feel good movie that is very uplifting ........
B000N2HCM4|4.0|I thought it would be a fluff piece, and ultimately I was right. I read this because several persons I know told me I should.  They told me I would be shocked,that:<br />Obama is not like us.  That he hates whites.  That he is going to take over the world, (in his second term).<br /><br />Huh? Well he did discover that he was black and that blacks are treated differently than whites, and that treatment varies from time to time and place to place.  I think I read that somewhere else, as well....
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I think that many of the reviews are based on prior experience with Les Miz.  I can understand that this CD is a let down if you are comparing these artists to the ones who made history with the songs.  It is like hearing an ex-Beatle singing a song recorded by The Beatles (and I love all the ex-Beatles so do not take that as a slam)--you have to separate the original memory from the new experience. Sometimes you can and sometimes you cannot. Now first off I admit I am a Russell Crowe fan--I have all his CDs and I do listen to them.  I was surprised at this voice on this CD.  Listen to one of his \\"rock\\" cds and compare the two--you will see the vast improvement (leaving myself open there but there you go..).  As for the others, I am not really a fan of Hugh but I don't see any problem with what he did nor do I see a problem with any of the performances and Crowe is the only one where you could say I am a fan.  It's like the prior, non singing, film versions of Les Miz--who is better?  Or the cast recordings...look at any of them and there is a debate this way or that as to whom is the best.  Overall I loved this CD and I know I will love the movie because I loved previous film versions and stage versions.  I take them all individually.  I am enjoying this CD and unless I can sing better than Anne or Amanda or whoever I am going to refrain from judgement on their vocal abilities.  I am going to only state my opinion as to whether I enjoyed it or not. I love the CD as I said and I am going to give my boy Rusty and all the others a high five for trying and for finishing this project in such style.  I wish that people who review could understand that being cruel and judgemental is not the same as stating an opinion.  Not saying that anyone was particularly offensive but just adding that as a footnote. I admit I tend to like things others do not.  Did I say enough about the product?  Loved I DREAMED A DREAM, ON MY OWN, STARS and BRING HIM HOME the most but all the trackswere good.
B00AMBM9MO|1.0|Bad in every way, no reason to watch it!  We wasted several hours on this piece of trash and it was not even funny, just crude!
B0000AM6IY|5.0|Fun to see the difference between how movies where made and how they are made in today's world. Wish I could get a copy of the new version.
B0053O89WY|5.0|So much fun to put and watch without the interruption of commercials.<br />Great way to unwind at the end of the day.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This is a horrible app. Don't bother looking at Facebook on your kindle fire hd. I am disappointed you would even put an app like this out.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is beyond amazing. I love it and all the other books too. I have read the entire collection three times all ready
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Use the browser.  This app shows maybe the last 10 minutes, and drops the rest. very limited.  I can see more on the Silk browser than this app shows.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I downloaded this game to my Kindle and have been totally wasting time shooting birds at pigs ever since.  I need to find a place online to read the &#34;rules&#34; of the game. I keep wondering why sometime I get only one star and other times two or three. Doesn't seem to be a lot of rhyme nor reason to the &#34;star&#34; system. Suppose I will figure it out in time.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|A movie you can watch with your family no matter what age your children are. Fun and laughing is great!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|An incredible page turner - equal to if not better than Fall of Giants - Some of Follett's best writing. Winter of the World was terrific
B004GJVI5C|5.0|Check your pulse if you don't love this movie.<br /><br />Never slow, never dull, superb casting and acting. THIS is a 5 star movie.
B009G3T01M|5.0|Macklemore is an insightful, talented, visionary MC. Musically varied and entertaining album, but the real power is in the themes that are tackled across the tracks. Gay marriage, the Nike-ization of our nation's youth, and the parasitic nature of modern day record deals are just a few of the topics that most other rappers wouldn't dare touch, and if they did, they couldn't treat them with the finesse and power that Macklemore does. Bravo!
B001C3I4UM|5.0|This is one of my favorite bands while I was in the military.  Just got back from vietnam where I had heard a few songs and thought they were the &#34;cutting edge&#34; of rock.  I would have paid twice as much for this album.  I am a sucker for nolstalgic sounds of the most difficult time in my life and yet the greatest time of my life.
B004X4R49Y|5.0|Great movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone. I plan to watch it again. The acting is excellent and realistic.
B004RE29PO|1.0|Unfortunately, the item did not play properly. Continuously froze. I did not return; Item was less than $5 and not worth the hassle of re-packaging and paying shipping to send back.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This was just what we needed for our new Amazon Kindle Fire!  It works great!  Recommend this product to everyone!
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|The movie was just so wonderful that I watched it many times. I had the VCR and gave it to my granddaughter. I am glad to get a replacement. My family has watched the video several times. I strongly recommend it to every one.
B005ZTFPFQ|4.0|the controls are a little harder to get use to but the game is very very close to the arcade
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This is one of the best games I have every player<br />I played the demo on Wii and when I saw amazon had this for free download I just jumped and downloaded it
B00881VLCE|5.0|love doing puzzles wherever I go.  Also love the options of number of pieces, needing to turn the pieces or not, and picture choices.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This is one of those movies we used to watch every year when I was a kid and it holds up to the memories.  Chevy Chase is HILARIOUS and his ability to dead-pan is perfect; Julia Louis-Dreyfuss in an early role is a scene-stealer and shows some of the talent that would become evident in her TV career, which has netted her multiple Emmy's and countless accolades. I can't think of one scene that doesn't have me laughing hysterically. It is a true classic.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|perfect for my 6 yr old daughter...we played together and enjoyed it.  nice graphics and shows pets are a responsibility and take time.  almost better than a real pet!  LOL
B005LAJ16I|5.0|This dvd season was an order for someone else. They said that enjoyed the show. It reminded them of 24.  All I can say from personal experience is that it arrived in good time and well packaged.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I was on vacation for two weeks and this game kept me entertertained for a lot of the down time.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|I have consulted my 6 year for this review. This movie is hilarious and has a great story. My 6 year old laughed out loud and wanted to see it again. There's nothing scary or inappropriate in this movie. My son said he can watch it over and over again.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book definitely keeps the readers attention throughout the story. I did expect the predictable plot of accidentally getting married in Vegas,but the story had a nice twist to it.
B002RSDW80|4.0|The final film of legendary writer/filmmaker Nora Ephron is a proud tribute to her iconic legacy.  Meryl Streep and Amy Adams both deliver fine performances and the movie is as good today as it was in theaters. It is terrific.
B001JNNDGA|5.0|The most realistic movie retelling the greatest story.  You feel very much a part of the movie from the beginning to the end.  Highly recommended.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This is a good game. I would like to have more energy or have it replenish faster. How can you get diamonds without paying for them?
B00005JLEU|5.0|Watching the first 15 minutes of the movie, I was thinking WTF is this crazy storyline.<br />My nieces and nephews where expressing similar concern in the way kids do.<br />Because we had already watched &#34;Howl's Moving Castle&#34; together, we knew that something magical would happen so kept watching with anticipation.<br />Spirited Away is filled with a menagerie of &#34;trippy&#34; characters and teaches kids that you can confront your fears head on and grow through the process.<br />Definitely one to add to your children's anime collection.
B008KNUKVI|5.0|i was so surprised at the sound, it is soooo great . i keep listening to this over and over.  the group rocks!
B0095EMOTM|4.0|Except for a few, I love listening to every song on this CD! I love how upbeat David Guetta's music is, and how every song is sung by a different artist.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|Had this sequel to Men In Black 1 & 2 been made about a decade ago I might have found myself more invested.  Even with decent acting, a solid script and an overall entertaining feeling, I just couldn't bring myself to care.  The time travel stuff was interesting, but frankly I didn't care that much.  I hadn't seen the first two movies since they first came out and am not that interested in it.  Will Smith is too old to be playing this character anymore and Josh Brolin was the ONLY reason to watch for me.
B001F7MSFM|4.0|Like any sequel , seeing the first give you an understanding of the characters .<br />If you enjoyed the first Hellboy , you wont be dissapointed with the second .<br />We're not talking academy award performances , but with this genre , who cares ?
0062082353|4.0|Was bought as a present so the new owner just got the gift on Christmas so don't know how they will like it.
B00192IOBA|5.0|Jason Mraz is a mixture of soulful, reggae, pop and hip hop/rap. He is very talented writer, singer and performer. Highly recommend him as I have all of his music.

1451629192|4.0|I read a lot of sad books, which seems to be kind of unfortunate since my readers like to read about my life more than they like to read about what I think about sad books that I read. Picking up this book from the library made me feel like I was getting a giant People magazine, I felt voyeuristic and a little gross that I would even want to read this tale.<br /> A Stolen Life tells the story of Jaycee Dugard, who was kidnapped at the age of 11 by a stranger named Phillip and his wife Nancy. They kept her in their backyard for 18 years where they forced her to become their \\"family.\\" Phillip told her that she was helping him with his sex addiction by letting him repeatedly rape her so that no one else had to suffer...as she was suffering. Jaycee begins her story by stating that writing it she felt free from her captor. She was denying his commands she had kept for so long by telling the world the secrets he made her keep.<br /> Jaycee writes her story in her own words, from the day she was kidnapped up to the time she was writing her memoir, two years later. After a story, she'll reflect upon how she currently is feeling. It is amazing to read such a devastating tale and how much Jaycee has been able to grow into her newfound freedom.<br /> I feel uncomfortable really reviewing this book, because it is so personal. Her writing is a bit childish, but what do you expect of a girl who was taken out of school at 11 to basically be a sex slave? She was more or less not allowed to leave the confines of the backyard and only had contact with her kidnapper, his wife, and the two daughters she bore. Her greatest joy was in the many pets that came and went during her life. Since being freed she has gone on to start her own foundation to help families dealing with similar situations and helping abandoned animals.<br /> What makes this book almost a joy to read is that you, the reader, get to watch this woman go from a scared victim to a free woman both physically and mentally. It is not an easy path and it is incredible that you, for a moment, almost see Phillip and Nancy as her \\"family\\" and her life as almost happy before she is freed. Jaycee has such a wonderful, happy spirit that she sounds almost content some of the time.<br /> Considering the content, this book is not too painful to read. She doesn't go into too much detail about the horrors she was put through, only really explaining them in the beginning, when it is most painful because she is so young. As the book continues, the pain is more mental than physical, but it has a happy ending! It is a powerful story of the resilience of the human spirit and the healing power of family love, caring strangers, and professional therapy.<br /><br />See more of my reviews at janaslibrary.blogspot.com/It is not an easy path and it is incredible that you, for a moment, almost see Phillip and Nancy as her \\"family\\" and her life as almost happy before she is freed.

B0085TKAW6|4.0|Ken Follett has done it again and I found it hard to put down. Look forward to book 3 in the trilogy.
B005LAIHPE|3.0|Battleship is a decent action sci-fi movie with a darn good cast, great special effects and a decent story. Now I'm not going to BS you and say that it had a great screenplay. But, when compared with a lot of other action movies I've seen lately, it's practically Shakespear. The dialogue was was crisp and didn't get lost in technical mumbo jumbo as it might have. I don't remember hearing any profanity. If there was any it just didn't register. So it's pretty suitable for youngsters.<br /><br />The story begins with NASA sending messages of friendship and good will to a newly discovered planet outside our solar system. While this is going on we meet Alex Hopper, a long haired deadbeat with $60 to his name and a Navy officer as an older brother. Alex's brother was played by Alexander Skarsgard, my wife's favorite actor on True Blood. Stone Hopper (Skarsgard) reads his little brother the riot act for being a loser and convinces him to join the Navy and do something with his life.<br /><br />One thing about this movie that impressed me was the timeline. Most sci-fi movies don't take the truly vast distances of space into account. Battlship does by virtue of the fact that the aliens don't respond to NASA's message of friendship for many years. Since it would take 3 or more years for a message to reach another star, that makes sense. Also, it gives Alex time to go to OCS and work his way up to LT in the Navy - 6 or more years.<br /><br />So as the Aliens are preparing respong to NASA greeting with overwhelming force, Alex is preparing to ask Admiral (Liam Neeson) Shane for his daughter's hand in marraige. But before he can do so he gets in a fight with a visiting Japanese officer, and learns that the Navy is tired of his antics and plans to kick him to the curb. But before all that can happen the Aliens launch their attack on various Pacific Ocean targets. Alex and his crew must defend humankind from alien stormtroopers. When the senior officers get killed, Alex becomes commanding officer aboard his ship and takes on the aliens. I'm not going to give the rest of the plot away. But the script is tight, and the ending just what it should be.<br /><br />By the way, a special mention should go to Colonel Gregory Gadson, Army veteran who plays a double amputee who's given up on himself, but finds the strenght to defend America one last time. Gadson, who lost both legs above the knees in Iraq, was offered this role by director Peter Berg. Despite being a professional soldier, not an actor, Gadson brought a real deapth to this character.<br /><br />Battleship did have 2 things going against it. (1) It came out after the mediocre Battle: Loas Angeles and the horrific crapfest that was Skyline.(2) It was marketed as a film adaption of the 1970s game Battleship. Aside from about a 6 minute segment, I didn't see much to connect the movie to the game.<br /><br />Now this movie isn't going to win any awards. I'd imagine that just about every film critic in North America hated it. But it was good clean fun with over the top special effects, but not the bone chilling gore of some movies in the genre. Fun for the hole family...except mom.ommanding officer aboard his ship and takes on the aliens. I'm not going to give the rest of the plot away.

B001M72JC2|1.0|Disc appeared to be foreign made.  Had no menu and had an alternate ending that was different from the original theatrical release.  The original theatrical release was not on the disc.  Very Disappointed!
B00782O7IY|5.0|This was everything we hopped for when we made the purchase. We knew this was going to be an Acadamy Award Winner when we saw the movie at the Theatre.  Great addition to our collection!
B002ZG99A4|5.0|Bought this movie for one of my sons for Christmas. He loves it and will be telling his friends about the movie.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I waited many years to see DARIA released on DVD and it was well worth the wait.  Lawndale is as entertaining today as it was in the 90's.  Daria is wise beyond her years and the writing is sharp, timeless and captivating.  I've re-watched this several times since I got it.
B00AEFVRB2|5.0|This is a really sick and twisted movie. Some parts sadistically funny (oral sex to the chicken leg).<br />I literally said WTF the entire movie.
1594481717|3.0|This book was educating. Not very enlightening but it was a good read. Right brain thinkers would probably find most of it rather dull. I am a right brain thinker and I did, but it did confirm things that us right brain thinkers have been knowing since birth.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|I understand the concept of the movie but it over reached to get laughs. It was just OK. Can&#34;t see a part 2
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Very good book. Funny I finished it in a day. But I do think it is a bit overpriced. But still good.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|I love this album and will be buying more of Taylor Swift's music to go with the other albums of hers I have. I will be recommending this album to other people.
B003ZJ70W4|3.0|A tired script, hopelessly dated acting and over-abundance of fashion scenes made this hallow sequel simply unwatchable. The characters are past their prime, the idea presented about love simply dated and frankly this movie just isn't worth the price of admission.
B001XUPF2O|4.0|Something different and with more of a back story.  I understand this is the first one but it did drag for me in the beginning.
1451648537|5.0|A very smart man.  I have an Apple IMac and love it.  I use it every day.<br />What more can I say.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The ONLY way to improve this series would be to not have canceled it. :p Space cowboys, witty banter, mystery, romance, a man named Jayne in a knitted hat. This show has it all. Joss is boss.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I wasn't thrilled about the movie, plot holes and lack of character motivations were a turn off for me. But, it's beautiful and if you've seen the other Alien movies, you have to see this, right!? Amazon Instant worked seamlessly as it has lately. I wrote a review a few years ago trashing it pretty hard. All better now!
B0034G4P8A|5.0|This movie was gotten for one of my sons for a present. He loves it and will be telling his friends about the movie.
B003L77G06|5.0|This is one of those rare TV comedies that everybody can watch together.  The acting is top-notch, the writing is groundbreaking and you won't stop laughing even once.  There isn't a single thing about this show you won't like. It's a progressive comedy with a heart of gold.  I love it.  Sofia Vegera is a scene-stealer as Gloria!
B0035FQ1UU|4.0|I have to admit this was one that you kind of need to suspend your inner thoughts and just let the movie be, once that was established I really enjoyed the ride.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|fun game. I love the mini games and the hidden objects games. kept me entertained for several hours. can't wait for the next one.

B0087GZ8YW|3.0|Welcome back Rebus, a good but not great Ian Rankin novel. Rebus is as cranky as ever but the story is a bit flat.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I bought this for my great nephew for a Christmas present because he just loved watching the movie with my when I was up visiting with him in Sept.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This show is awesome -- the characters, dialogue, writing, costumes, story line, etc are wonderful.  This is the unedited U.K. version.  I understand the show was edited for American audiences when aired on PBS's Masterpiece Theater.  Get the U.K. version if you want to see the uncut program.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|The only problem with Dark Knight is that it last sooooo long!  Other that that the movie and graphics were GREAT!
B000HKW7E0|5.0|The little under the breath comments made by cast throughout this movie make it hilarious. It wouldn't be Christmas without this one! Go on get yourself something real nice Clark!
B000W91RUG|5.0|Purchased this for one of my sons for a gift. He loves this show and I will be buying other seasons for him.
B004NOH9LC|5.0|3 of my favorite actors.  It isn't a deep movie with a lot of meaning but a great way to wile away a couple of hours, beats reruns any day.

B005HSL626|4.0|I only played once, and I am hooked.  My son showed me and it went from there.  I think it would pass the time by in a doctors office. for all ages
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|I fell asleep. Although that's no reflection on the movie. I was just tired. There were some unnecessary language in the film which I found inappropriate for younger children.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Looks beagutiful. Sounds fun. Plays great. A newodd puzzle game that is well thought outwith a great story and outstanding visuals.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I can't say enough about this website! My sister suggested it to me. I have been reorganizing and trying new things constantly!
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I bought this tape for my great nephew for Christmas also because it was another one of his favorites.  I might add that I also loved the movie.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I love this book. It is a perfect cross between adventure, comedy, and drama!  In my opinion I think Percy and Annebeth should date!!!  I couldn't believe the evilness of Luke though, to be honest in the beginning I was kind of in love with Luke lol not anymore
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is by far the best thing any woman could do. Its so easy to go back and find that receipe you stored, copy it and make it.  Love it!
0756666937|5.0|If you have a child who LOVES Legos this book is a MUST!! shows the history of legos, some awesome things that have been built. etc.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|When the game actually appears on your kindle, it's a great game.  Addicting too, just what I was expecting from Rovio&trade;.<br />  So obviously, if it doesn't work, you probably won't enjoy it much, but at least try to download it!!!!!
B0079XPUOW|3.0|John Scalzi has been one of my favorite authors since reading his incredible Old Man's War trilogy, one of the greatest military science fiction books I have ever had the pleasure of reading. The characters are deep, the dialogue is witty, and the plot is full of intricate twists and turns. It's brilliant and compelling. Redshirts is not anywhere close to this pedigree, but rather stands as an average science fiction book based on a whimsical premise.<br /><br />Pros<br />+The premise is very compelling and original. It's a fairly robust homage to Star Trek, one of my favorite shows of all time.<br />+While most of the characters are uninteresting, I found Jenkins to be exceedingly compelling.<br />+The codas get progressively better, from one to three. The second and third codas are actually reminiscent of Scalzi's usual pedigree; they are deep, emotional, and beautifully done. What a shame that they are buried at the end of the novel, and come after such a mediocre story. I would contend that if these codas were not attached to the main story, one would never believe they were written by the same person. Coda 1 rates 4 stars, and codas 2 and 3 each rate a very deserving 5 stars.<br /><br />Cons<br />-The characters (with the exception noted above) are not compelling. Like other readers, I found them so lacking in depth that I consistently confused two of the main protagonists until around page 300.<br />-I find the repeated &#34;'blah' he said; 'oh, blah blah' she said&#34; format distracting and tedious.<br />-The writing seems plain, and lacking the focus that I am used to in Scalzi's work. The plot lacks the thrilling twists and turns from his previous books. At one point about 40% through the book, the plot proposes a valid(ish) reason for all the dialogue and happenings to be so absurd, but then fails to capitalize on this new development by not changing course to  grow into a more elegant novel.<br /><br />I feel that Redshirts began with the best of intentions to pay homage to one of the most unusual and interesting bits of Star Trek lore- the guy with the red shirt is probably going to kick the bucket on his away mission (in a most unfortunate manner as well), while the senior crew members escape unharmed. However, this idea by itself is not enough to carry an entire book. Superior books have deep characters that experience common human emotions like fear, love, helplessness, friendship, failure, or triumph on a level that I can relate to. Moreover, the plot gives enough information to make you keep reading, but its always more thrilling when you feel like the author has a few tricks left up his sleeve that you just can't see coming. Redshirts has plot twists, but they made me say &#34;oh come on...really?&#34; rather than Scalzi's usual &#34;whattttt in the world?! No way, I've got to see how this turns out!&#34;<br /><br />TL;DR Version: Redshirts is a funny and amusing read that can be completed in about a day, but I strongly encourage readers with limited time (EG: myself) to read the Old Man's War trilogy first, and perhaps save this book for a mindless beach read or flight time killer. This is well below Scalzi's usual quality, but I trust that his next outing will again be a superlative piece of science fiction.
0007152590|5.0|Christmas gift for my son and new wife!  She's reading it. I recommended this book<br />To understand men better too!
B00APUYWYA|4.0|sometimes we struggle to find movies that you can watch with your teenage children. For us, this one did the trick.
1608871452|5.0|This amazing coffee table is a MUST for all Supernatural fans.  Full of information, pictures and additional bits and pieces, it is a road map of the show so far.  I absolutely love it.
B0081SPK0I|1.0|First on the third time all you get is a black screen and the music. Now the music will not stop even when the kindle is turned off, so now the music is giving me a headache and killing my battery. next stop is to delete it.
B006O6F932|4.0|it was a little difficult to open up the high school but when it did my daughters eyes lit up.
B007UXSPK2|4.0|Let us face it: the movie is a grotesque. It does not have a single believable action scene. James Bond movies look like documentaries in comparison. The MI franchisee has become a parody for spy movies. Almost like Archer.<br /><br />However, I still liked it. Probably because I like Archer.
B008MEM24S|5.0|the game put your brain in acction to get the proper way to get perry free from the tram ;-)
0307476154|5.0|Great book, highly addictive series of books, I would recommend to everyone that enjoys a detective thriller, you cant possibly imagine the end.

B000H5U832|5.0|Cars is a great movie! Mator is my newphews favorite character. The copy of I bought was not &#34;Like new&#34; as it was supposed to be. I would say buy it new!!
B00009NQQO|3.0|My four-year-old really enjoyed this toy; it kept him in the bathtub most of Christmas Day morning. However, today I noticed that half of the net is already falling off the hoop! I am returning it for a replacement in hopes that we received a defective item and that this isn't a problem with all of the products. Amazon's return policy is extremely easy - I already have a new one in the mail to me. I just have to get to the UPS office in the morning to return the defective one.
1423140605|5.0|I buy this book to my niece when I check the book feel like my niece gone say &#34;I love it&#34;
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|If you haven't read it yet, do. It will make you smile and cry in its beauty. It was a great read.
B000SGGUWS|4.0|I watched threshold before I rad the book which may not have been the pesticides. Although, I learned new information that wasnt talked about on the show, the book mostly revolved around the pilot episode that I had seen previously. Overall the book was decent and I am  interested in reading more of the series.
030759565X|4.0|Light reading in the chatty, familiar style of the blog. Recipes that make me want to get into the kitchen and start cooking!
1400079276|5.0|I really enjoyed this book! After I read it I bought copies for two of my friends to read as well.
B009ZE27US|2.0|Thought it to be inaccurate. A silly app. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I wouldn't use it again and you shouldn't offer it.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|title says what I mean.  don't miss out on this game.  It is well worth the 5 dollars.  5 stars all the way
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This game is great!<br />You can comb, color, curl, straighten, and wash their hair- as well as other things! Its really entertaining and a great idea. There are so many fun things to do and there's always a combination to try.<br />I recommend this app, it works well. The only problem? Kindle owners should really be able to access more Toca Boca apps. Have fun styling hair!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|fun with spacial reasoning.  each level adds another degree of<br />difficulty.  some puzzles just jump out at me while others simply won't<br />resolve for me.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I would definitely recommend it to the public.! Great book, I couldn't keep from reading it, would say something else but j don't want to ruin it for other readers.
0307592731|1.0|Guess I am not \\"deep\\" enough to appreciate this one.<br /><br />As a backpacker myself, only an idiot would even think to attempt a trip such as this without any prior experience.<br /><br />Guess I should reserve judgement as I have not officially finish the book.<br /><br />I can only assume she \\"finds herself.\\"<br /><br />Yawn.
B001P3SA94|5.0|everything was great it was a very good deal for a movie that turned out to be just what i wanted!
1455523003|5.0|I have to say I was incredibly skeptical about Hitchens' point before reading this book but, as is always the trend in his writing, Christopher Hitchens makes some very incisive and well written points that are, at the very least, worth reading.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|God I don't even know how to articulate how much I freakin' LOVE this game!!! It's too awesome for words, you really have to play it! XD
B007V2UGPE|5.0|The game is a ton of fun. And worth the space on your device.<br />Definitely a must since its cheap :P

B004YM6JI2|5.0|Great set of episodes of Season 7 - highly recommend this.  Eye candy it is, enjoyable it is, and ... season 8 is upon us!
B004GJYROG|5.0|My 3 year old loves this movie when it's on cable, he is thrilled to have his own DVD of it now!
B00AHSMDQY|2.0|Very long film (2.45 hrs) which seemed alot longer because of long stretches of tedious non-action, boring plot and the fact that Batman and Catwoman (Anne Hathaway) were seldom on the screen for the 1st half of film. Hathaway was only ok and that disappointed. Was glad when film finally ended.
B005HSL626|5.0|What's not to love about cutting open fruit?! It's great, and really a good game for children or adults with small attention spans or limited thinking skills. :D
B000VYX8PE|5.0|I SAW this MOVIE and wanted to read the book, and I wanna say that I will continue reading this series.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|The book was OK not the best book by that author. His other diary of a wimpy kid books are better.
B00023BLXK|5.0|Love this movie.  It is better than the first movie.  If you love cuban music and dancing, this movie is for you.
1476715904|4.0|the book draws  you in and keeps you waiting for whats next...must read and can't wait to read the next one
B0072GPQNG|4.0|Purchased this item for a raffle and I always select several movies that I have enjoyed over the years to put on the raffle table.
B00A757EFW|1.0|When I first saw this I was psyched, pac-man is my all time favorite arcade game, I've been known to blow $20 in quarters at movie arcades on this game, so of course I downloaded it. Big Mistake. I didn't notice the &#34;joy-stick&#34; at the bottom of the screen at first but even when I did it was still hard to monuver, the corners and dead-ends are so hard to go through and get out of, it's just not worth it, and that's saying something because the game is free!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|The book was very good and much better than the movie it went into more detail and better story line
B008QTVNUI|5.0|It was a great show with individually great episodes. If you liked 24 or other action tv series- this ones for you.
055380684X|4.0|Interesting approach but I would have loved more practical examples on how to become such type of coach. A bit vague.
B000ID1J5E|4.0|My grandson is a Meryl Streep fan and I decided to give him some of her earlier work that I had enjoyed as we are working to completed his colletion.

B009WO7NQO|5.0|My five year old grandson and I love Angry Birds. Star Wars is our most recent adventure.  We make a competition playing against each other.....he usually wins!
B007THA4FI|3.0|I love detail and interesting characters  I love tightly woven plots and the Quixotic tuns of events. I love fine writing<br /><br />But here is is a book of minutia and uninteresting characters.
1442354747|5.0|I listen to many audiobooks due to a lot of driving with my job. This book is excellent, but it is not offered unabridged, neither us the original book. I'm listening to that version now. It makes me want to read the entire TEAM OF RIVALS unabridged. Just know that he movie is an excellent companion.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I enjoyed the first season very much . This is also a excellent collectors edition . Can't wait for the third season to come out .
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this dictionary, it has taught me words i have never heard of. So.....  Thank You so much
B008WCP2KG|3.0|The movie wasn't exactly what I was expecting.  I liked it but not sure I should have bought it.  I would have rented it but not sure it should be in the video library.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very good. Nice easy read. Intriguingly special. Love story as well as adventurous. Can't say<br />It was the best but good.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book! Thu  Is one I  the best book  I have ever read in my whole life... and I am twenty-six.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I found the series to be excellent .  This is diffently a collectors edition for a collection of movies .
B008MEM24S|5.0|Fell in love with this game on my parents cell phone. Was so happy to find it on here. Fun to play. My 3yr old daughter can't get enough of this game always wants to play it. And does play s it well. She learns fast.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great book! I enjoyed the fact that there was a story line instead of sex scene after sex scene like in the first. Can't wait to begin Fifty Shades Freed, but sad to finish the series.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|GREAT JOB WITH THIS DICTIONARY IT WAS A GREAT JOB DONE BY YOU GUYS IT WAS GREAT AND GOOD :}
B0098VXE50|5.0|This is a great re-make of a classic movie; Charlize Theron plays an excellent witch. This movie is very entertaining and full of action/adventure. Could watch it over and over again.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Enjoyable read that leaves you guessing although the reader can surmise what will happen.  Didn't care for the emotional frailty of main characters.
B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|The ending is totally unrealistic. The novel leaves no stone unturned in the course of character development but at the end leaves the reader hanging?  Very unsatisfying.
B002W2U3H4|5.0|It is our family tradition to watch it every Christmas Every. Our boys get new PJ's and we drink hot chocolate. Great family memories
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is an amazing book. I first saw the movie, and when I got my kindle fire yesterday for Christmas, this is the first book I bought. I fully recommend it.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This is by far my kids favorite game. They love it. My 11, 8, 5, 3 yr old all play it and even their grandma loves it. Very addicting
B007HACDLK|4.0|Vince is back in the game with this one.  Much more action than his 2 previous offerings.  Vivid imagery.  A great page turner
B000JMKTLO|3.0|A bit predictable, but fun vacation read. I like this author's writing, but some parts were exaggerated and cheesy. It is good for a quick read on the beach!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I chose this rating for this book because it is funny.I love this book.Everyone should read this funny awesome book
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Pretty good so far. I like the graphics and storyline. Don't even see any ads and the game is awesome!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|It is very nice. Very quick and responsive. Would definitely recommend it. My daughter uses it and is enjoying it a great deal.
B0018QOIXU|4.0|Adele 19 was great but I am still blown away by Adele 21.  That CD would be hard to top for anyone.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I am an avid reader and love books. At first I thought that the twilight saga was stupid until my best friend recommend it to me. Now we are both obsessed. This saga is very well written and I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes romantic novels that are not gushy.LOVE THIS SAGA.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|This is my first read of this timeless classic, but not my last. Recommended reading for everyone of any age. Read in one day on my new Kindle fire. Thanks dad and Sandy for this great gift. Skip
0399160450|1.0|ISBN 978-0-399-16045-5 Version of \\"Threat Vector\\" goes from page 596 to page 629, excluding all pages in between.<br /><br />Ruins the story.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I only knew the book had something to do with an Indian boy and a tiger on a life boat, from the TV commercials for the movie. It was that and so much more. The excruciating details of survival were riveting and the twist at the end was both frustrating and somehow satisfying! Highly recommended. Once I got to the part where the ship sinks, I couldn't put it down!
1400067820|5.0|This is a very thought provoking book that encourages you to look at the world in a new way.  I'm used to approaching things with redundancy, flexibility and contingency plans - this tweaks one's viewpoint that extra few degrees.  After reading this I'm adding Black Swan (and maybe a few others) to my reading list.
1439127700|4.0|This tome is a wonderful review of how former presidents continue to serve in many varied ways after their term in office.
8866130915|2.0|OK, so I'm probably impaired when reading an item's dimensions and envisioning exactly how big the item will be when it arrives; but my goodness, based on size alone, this was terribly overpriced.  Moleskine tends to be not a bargain for any item, so I should have expected it; but as I said, my goodness.  What a puny little thing, about the size of a checkbook.  And it cost what, over thirteen dollars?  Gracious.
B005LAIIJY|3.0|Tarantino has made some great homage flicks, and he has made some fairly groundbreaking ones too, but this(for me, anyway) fails on both of those counts.  His saving grace has always been his ability to write at least one really nuanced character that you either hate or love, and sometimes love to hate (Hans Landa in Inglorious Basterds and the conflicted and loveable Jules in Pulp Fiction).  But, with the marginally acceptable exception of the Dentist, played by Chirstoph Waltz, every single character in this movie is nothing more than a one-note blunder.  Don't get me wrong, all the actors bring their A game (at times overacting and chewing scenery to great effect), but they've got nothing to work with.  The \\"bad\\" guys are soooo BAD that you never get any of the shadowy dread that you might be rooting for an equally disturbed \\"good\\" guy the way you do in  Leone's flicks.  Here everything is so cut and dry that Django's greatest excesses seem wholly justified.<br />The bad guys have no moral misgivings, no chance is given for them to explore the nature of the evil that they are lording over their fellow human beings.  DiCaprio is really good at being scuzzy and repulsive, but his character is really dumb.  I mean REALLY dumb. \\"He's a Francophile.  But don't speak French to him.  He doesn't understand it.  It embarrasses him.\\"  All the bad guys are so dumb that you almost don't have the heart to actually Hate them (\\"forgive them, they know not what they do\\").  Sam Jackson's character being the only exception (I don't want to be a spoiler, so I'll leave it there) but he is in so many ways such an understandable product of this world, you actually kind of feel bad for him.<br />A good villain has to be aware of their evil, or they have to possess a truly compelling justification for it that absolves them, at least in their own minds (see Bill the Butcher or Hannibal Lecter).  No one in this film has that.  The phrenology scene is simply lame.  Yes, I know that phrenology was used as a justification, but not on its own.  It was a part of a larger argument, one that could have made that scene as good as the opening of Inglorious Basterds.  But instead we are just given a world full of stupid  Americans (and a few Aussies) vs Django.  It's like a 165 minute straw man argument.<br />The film has a lot of laughs, even more blood, and tons of awesomely gratuitous violence, some great cinematography and a really decent soundtrack.  In short; the film has brass balls, but in the end it has no heart.<br />Two and a half stars, really.  But I'll give the extra half for a couple of reasons that would end up being spoilers if I mentioned them.

B009RH9FR6|4.0|My Kindle Fire travels with me on a transit bus every weekday to work and back and I feel it's very secure in this leather case.  I love that I can rotate the viewing angle from portrait to landscape as I don't have a lot of room on the bus and this helps without the need to hold it all the time.  Plus I use it to watch movies when I'm in my craft room.  It's not real light and the strap is uncomfortable.  I'm left handed so use the strap over my right hand--but not often since it's tight.  It's fastened in snuggly and I like that opening and shutting the case turns it on and off.  The strap that goes over the front keeps it turned off.  There is easy access to the ports so I never take it out of the case.  I can recommend this one and I've had 3 cases so far.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Fun graphics, easy control, creative & cute.<br />BUT frustratingly addictive!  Start point is always the same (frustrating), but almost all the obstacles are randomized (making it more challenging), and it's all so easy until You die... that's why it's addictive... :-)
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|I'm not going to review the movie.<br />The package arrived on release date, at an excellent price point, 3D works great for this film, loaded with extras, what's not to like?

B006LSZECO|3.0|Almost great. So disappointed with last quarter of book and ending. Author ran out of steam or publisher insisted on pat conclusion.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|these are the most accurat weather forcasts you can get and you can get them anytime you want around the clock
B009JBZH54|5.0|All 3 Batman films in one place at a great price point with free shipping before Christmas? You bet! Sure, they'll probably release another version at some point, however, a totally solid buy. You won't be disappointed!
B008Y7BE7E|5.0|my fav movie. not a bad price and quality was great. would suggest it to anyone interested. zombie death :)
B007IXWKUK|5.0|great book loved the series very interesting and held my attention can't wait to read other books similar to it
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|A must see movie it is a good ending to the batman series though I am saddened that there wont be another one
B004JN1D2I|4.0|The writing deserves five stars. If the Kindle version was broken up, this review would be five stars. The size of the file is overwhelming and is a challenge to navigate. Now that I am 91% through the collection I have gotten used to the intense enormety of the works. Other than the vast size and navigation challenges, I highly recomend the collection no matter your preferred version. The writing is well worth any Kindle struggles.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Diary of a wimpy kid is the best book series ever in the whole world the author is cool too
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|I can't even describe how terrible this movie was.  Was so far off track it is even funny.  Do, not rent/buy this movie, barrow it from someone/something.  You will thank me.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I have read this book several times and have always loved it.  For some strange reason the tragedy in the story picks me up when I am feeling down.  In my opinion, this is a classic that everyone should enjoy.<br />I have the actual book, but loved the idea of having it electronically which led me to purchasing the Kindle version.<br />The movie is now showing in theaters and I can't wait to see this book transformed onto the big screen.
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|This was worth every penny. Enjoyed listening to it. Her voice is becoming stronger. Awesome music. Her videos are also worth watching.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This app was downloaded and would only allow a few posts to be read. The page would not scroll to view more posts. I'm told in order to view posts, facebook must deleted from my Kindle Fire and be opened in a browser.<br /><br />I would not recommend installing this app.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Loved it.  It was funny, inspiring, hard to put down.  I loaned this title out to a friend - look forward to more from AndyWeir
B008U7ZPHS|3.0|Fight... then another fight... then some internal fight... then another fight... You should be catching my drift by now. This is a ridiculously low point in the Percy Jackson saga. There is nearly zero character and plot development.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|Thought the singing was the best. Bad story line and vulgar words used that took away from enjoying... It was shame becsue the music was great.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|If you love Rod you'll love this cd. We Three Kings and Old Lang Syne are my favorites. The duets are a nice addition too.
B00APUQH0W|5.0|Am a Clint Eastwood fan, and I have to see any movies he makes or stars in, Justin Timberlake is becoming a better actor as well, keep up the good work. I see this young lady in another couple movies and she good.
1401207529|5.0|I bought this book last year and just now decided to write a review. Not much to say that hasn't already been said. Amazing book showcasing the origin of Batman. Great stuff. Almost as great as R.I.P. which is my all time favorite bat book. Most will say it is even better. Recommend following up with Batman and the monster men, Batman and the mad monk, and Batman the man who laughs. Avoid The Long Halloween. Very overrated and repetitive IMO.
1419705849|5.0|my daughter loves these books. When she got this one for Christmas, she was elated. She cant wait to sit down and read this in piece and quiet. Get this book!!!
B009MO5ES8|4.0|Ok so this movie was very well written and entertaining. Even if you don't dig biking or riding a bike, the way they made the bike scenes and the chasing scenes were very clever. It kept me on my seat for most of the movie. The plot is kind of a simple one but it achieves its goal by entertaining even the viewer who wouldn't normally watch this kind of movie. I can see why maybe it didn't do the best at the movie theater because even with JGL the trailer didn't appeal to a wide audience but Oh well... it was good regardless.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I read this as a young girl, and it is just as good today as it was then. Some books never grow old.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I've never read a book I've loved as much as this one. It touched my soul and made me look at my dog so differently. This book taught me about life and how precious it really is....whether it be a walk in the park or having someone or something ( a pet) just be there. Highly recommended for all to read!
B00846REIS|5.0|Sexy and kept me reading...I didn't want to put it down !!! I'm about to start the 2nd book... I can't wait!
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|Great movie for those who like mifia movies.<br />Robert De Niro is at his best in this movie.<br />The family loved it.
B00AGH7K7I|5.0|Home Alone 2: Must see viewing for the Christmas Holidays - always a hit to watch again and again and again.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I've been a fan of Lindsey Stirling for a few years now ever since coming across a link to her song, \\"Crystallize\\" on Youtube. When her tour went through Wash DC, it was only natural to attend...and it was amazing! It was so good I just had to pick up this CD and I've never once regretted it. I had this one CD in my car and played it for months without ever getting bored or anything. The only time I ever take it out was when I bought a new CD and wanted to test it out however, once I've done it, I would pop Lindsey's CD right back in because nothing else is this good.<br /><br />Her music is a mix of sweet violins with an up tempo vibe so they're fun and energetic tracks. All in all, it's a fun and energetic mix of songs which makes for excellent car music to de-stress.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Tim Ferriss has created another masterpiece with his book - The 4-Hour Chef.<br /><br />Although perhaps not intended as a regular cookbook - the recipes are nonetheless fantastic.  I will venture to say that the steak I prepared last night al la 4-Hour Chef was one of the best, if not the best, I have ever cooked. Complements were received during the meal, after the meal, and again today. I'd say that's a win!<br /><br />As delicious as the recipes are, the book offers so much more (How to build a long-lasting fire anyone? How about catch a pigeon? Gut a deer? Tie a knot? Did you know that stinging nettles are edible?).  Even skills that I'd say I had *mastered* were an interesting read and gave me an opportunity to learn a slightly different variation.<br /><br />The meta-learning section caused me to re-evaluate how I'll be tackling learning new skills in 2013. I've already reached out to people \\"in the business\\" of my interest to ask the key questions as listed by Ferriss.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to finishing the remaining few pages.... and then to be able to reference back to this learning manual regularly.
B006O6F932|5.0|This playset is so fun!! I was worried about the size of it for storage but it surprisingly folds out to a very cool high school set-up and then folds up nicely and easily for storage! It has all the furniture that adds to the fun!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Completely loved it!! I was drawn from the beginning!! Best book I have read in awhile. Can't wait to read the next one!
B00824ZJ84|5.0|This album took a while to grow on me, it could be the style of music. It definitely has a motown influence on every song. With so many albums giving up on true feeling and emotion on songs, Rebecca Ferguson reminds all of us what true music is about.  Her lyrics have so much meaning to them. It takes a few listens, but the girl is BAD. (in a great way lol)
B005LAII62|1.0|This movie is inappropriate for children.  It has bad language and sexual themes that are not necessary for the story.  Plus it's boring.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I absolutely adored this book. It's so much better than the teenage angst I find myself reading all the time. The dialogue was so surprisingly witty and deep. It really makes you think about, well, everything. As a writer I find myself in awe and in envy at this literary genius I am very lucky to have found.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I love the way this book is written. The character's in the book are very relatable and their stories force you to look deeper into yourself. It reminds me that I need to be honest with myself, no matter what.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I could not put this book down. So many twists and turns, and characters you love to hate. Looking forward to reading other books by this author.
B00A7ZXH4O|5.0|definitely Rihanna's most honest album. It has a mix of elements from all her previous albums. Her vocals are great and she has great production on every song.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|It was received very quickly and was packaged well. I gave this as a gift and they loved it. It had a clear picture and sound and I was very happy with it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The had very exciting parts that has you jumping out of your seats, but I would not recommend kids under 9 to this movie or read the books. Because there is A LOT of kissing and that is unrequired  for younger kids. You never know what is coming next, even if you watch the movies.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|It was an excellent, surprising read. The subject matter was not what  I would have thought would hold my interest, but the quality of thought and expression was unusually appealing.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game!  Dragons are fun and different than most of the games out there my only complaint could be why is the things you need the most in these kinds of always cost money so you can't complete tasks
030759565X|5.0|I've been an occasional follower of Ms. Perelman's blog for a few years now.  She always has interesting recipes, and I enjoy her conversational style.  Plus, as a fellow New Yorker, I appreciate what she's able to accomplish in her small kitchen.  When I saw that she was coming out with a cookbook, I eagerly preordered.<br /><br />There really isn't anything I don't like about this cookbook.  The recipes are fresh and inventive, and there are not a lot of duplicates from the blog.  I can see where the conversational style the recipes are written in might throw some off, especially for less skilled home cooks, but I haven't had a problem with it myself.<br /><br />If you do buy this cookbook, you absolutely have to make the apple cider caramels.  They are amazing!
B001TCHDPS|5.0|What a remakable musician, as good as if not better than Bob Dillon!  Wish I'd known about him years ago!!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book is one of those stories where you can't put it down and it takes you back to high school. I would even say it's at the level of Tuesday's With Morrie especially with the lessons it teaches of how everyone has problems but we all manage somehow, everyone has a story.
B005EYP8PO|5.0|you can't ever go wrong with U2. this was a gift for my daughter, but the whole fam loves it
B008Y1YFNU|5.0|Okay i am a fan of pr so i might be a lil biasd but after metamorphisis i did not have a hi expectation for this but it was a very well composed record mayby even ther best work as a whole record. sorry i am a verry b ad speller
B006ID01OS|5.0|Well, I have already know about strategy, but in terms of alternatives to get the goal from where we are step, Cynthia opens in my mind a new way of thinking, to think the strategy as as System of Value creation and differentiation. For me this is the most important concept and Montgomery give us a detailed explanation about this. It was enjoyable. Thanks.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Hello facebook is good and bad all at the same time<br />love catching up with people<br />but hate all the drama it causes
B003WUYRGI|4.0|This book is nothing good compared to the other books I've read before it is a dictionary it is a big educational  chance to get smarter
B000HBKCDC|5.0|This is my new favorite Christmas CD.  I love Sarah McLachlan's voice and music.  So glad I purchased it.  Perfect!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|My issues are the same as the ones below. The app only loads the last dozen or so posts and then they all turn blue and you can't click on them
B008GXHOFW|1.0|First off I paid $6.99 for this app two weeks ago and today it costs 99 cents.  The game does not<br />allow you to go to the next level without paying additional fees !  This is crap<br />and the by far the most disappointing purchase on Amazon to date.
0439023513|5.0|Cannot wait for the movie to come out! This was an excellent book- I definitely recommend reading it.  The third one was great too.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This book was boring  compared to most books I've read before it is a dictionary and I have been interested in reading a dictionary and other bothering books like a thesaurus and a worldwide book of intelligent animals and other bothering creatures of the most popular landscapes I look forward too move on in my journey  of the books
B00000DHR0|5.0|I love this CD.  It arrived quickly in plenty of time to enjoy for the holiday!  I'm definitely a CD on line ordering believer.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|I hate this waste of space that's why there's Google kids!! When am I going to use this??? No one uses it!!!! I hate it and wish that it disappears from here it uses up storage space I can use for something else >: 
B00338QENI|5.0|Excellent insight into culture and genetics.  Poses interesting ethical dilemma.  It is a fast read and in terms I had no trouble to understand.  Get it!
B000YMJA7I|5.0|While not the biggest Axl Rose fan, I am a huge Slash fan. This album puts their biggest hits from the original group on one album. It sucks that they didn't stick together. I would consider them the last great hair metal band since grudge kinda took off right as they broke up.
B0088O11NU|5.0|CAn be frustrating but lots of fun to complete each level. WOuld recommend for every who does not get frustrated too fast.  GIveit a try.
B008NW67E0|5.0|This album is really great.  I still think the last one was better, but I'm not disappointed at all.  The only thing I don't like about it is that a few of the songs that are right next to each other in the lineup start out sounding almost exactly the same.  They are so similar that you might think that you have it on repeat.  After a few seconds, though, it gets better.  I just think they could have chosen the order of the songs better.  The bonus track &#34;The Boxer&#34; is a wonderful surprise.
B0070R40V6|3.0|I was a little hesitant to purchase this book on Kindle on account of several readers mentioning the poor quality of the Kindle edition. However, I couldn't wait to move on after I finished reading the free preview chapters, so I decided to take a chance. To get the topic of the Kindle editing out of the way, the edition still has the punctuation and spelling problems mentioned by other readers which takes away from the reading pleasure - I'm quite surprised Amazon still hasn't picked this up.<br /><br />Now to the book itself. First, I admit my expectations were very high given the HUGE attention this series has drawn and the comparisons to LOTR. I must admit that I was left a tad disappointed with the story. It's true that GRRM has created an interesting world and some intriguing characters, but I must admit that some of the decisions made by the principal characters (read Ned & Kat Stark) need a very strong suspension of disbelief, even if you take into account their personality traits. I enjoyed the first half of the book a lot more than the second which I think had several predictable outcomes. All in all, it was a book that kept me engrossed but not enough to keep me awake all night, and definitely not enough for me to order the next 3 books in the series on Kindle right away!
B008J2GAKU|5.0|A brooding, intelligent Batman with amazing tech. Featuring Dick Grayson as Nightwing and an enthralling mystery for Batman to solve ranks this among one of the finest Batman comics ever.
B009PU2SX8|5.0|Bought this album cause I heard the song City Lights on ESPN one day and liked it, but after listening to this entire album I was shocked. Gary Clark Jr. will be in my library of songs for the foreseeable future. Love his sound of blues rock and somewhat raspy voice. If you are a fan of Lenny Kravitz, Stevie Ray Vaughn, or someone similar to them, then listen to Gary Clark Jr.
145162445X|5.0|After reading some of the reviews here, I have decided that I am going to provide an unbiased review of this book veering as far as I possibly can from any philosophical or theological overtones. What we have here presented by Lawrence Krauss is a theoretical construct on how the universe we live in may have, in fact, arisen from \\"nothing.\\"<br /><br />It all starts with the Big Bang about 13.72 billion years ago. We first need to understand how this could happen and what evidence there is for this event. Well, there are several things. There are the residual elements of hydrogen, helium, and lithium in the universe today; the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation (evidence for which comes from the Boomerang experiment and later from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe); and the Hubble expansion (using type Ia supernovae along with redshift we can infer the expansion rate of the universe). There are certain problems with this scenario according to Krauss. First, there is the cosmological constant problem, where the calculated energy of empty space is 120 orders of magnitude greater than everything else in the universe. Second, there is a flatness problem, which relates to the density of matter and energy in the universe. This density affects the curvature of the universe, and we need a critical value for the flatness we see in the universe today. Since any deviation gets magnified over time as the universe expanded, it must have been even closer to critical density in the beginning. Then there is the horizon problem, which relates to the fact that the CMB radiation is extremely uniform. He shows that looking back to the \\"light scattering surface\\" shortly after the bang, anything separated beyond one degree in our sky would be \\"beyond the horizon\\" since light can only travel so fast. We are told that an inflationary component shortly after the bang provides an elegant solution to these things. Of course today, we now are aware of such things as dark matterand dark energy, concepts which are necessary to explain why things are the way they are today. Then there is the \\"nothing\\" part.<br /><br />It seems that virtual particles that appear and disappear on timescales too short to measure are responsible for most of our mass, and, in fact, everything visible in our universe. It is this stuff, called a cosmological constant, that can impart energy to empty space - the dark energy that is responsible for the expansion we measure in the current universe. He tells us that studies of the CMB show us that the universe is basically flat, and thus has zero total energy and could have begun from nothing. He states then, that this answers the question of why there is something instead of nothing. If you start with nothing in quantum mechanics, you'll always get something - that simple!<br /><br />He explains a type of universe called a closed universe in which the total energy is definitely and precisely zero. Such a universe, he states, could \\"quantum mechanically appear spontaneously with impunity carrying no net energy.\\" The characteristic lifetime of such a universe would be on the order of the Planck time (a very, very short time). In determining the \\"boundary conditions\\" for such a universe that may begin from nothing, we have two facts to note: First, that in quantum gravity, a universe can appear from nothing, and it can contain matter and radiation as long as the total energy is zero. Secondly, in order for these universes to last more than an infinitesimal time, a component like inflation is necessary; this inflation will allow an initially tiny closed universe to exponentially spread to an infinitely large flat universe - just like the one we live in.<br /><br />That's it in a nutshell. Read the book for a more in-depth discussion. If you want to read an interesting discussion on this book, read Sean Carroll's blog about it on the discover.com website. If you want to see a summary of the book on You Tube, check the video entitled \\"A Universe From Nothing\\" - Lawrence Krauss, Richard Dawkins. This whole concept is intriguing for sure, and the fact that it apparently has opened a Pandora's Box of brouhaha makes one want to read it even more.
B0076DELIG|4.0|The Black Box is Interesting and has a fairly complex plot line. Too bad Harry has no sense of humor.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower fills you with so much emotion that it is difficult to handle. It's the only book I have ever cried, laughed, been mad, extremely happy, or confused in. I wish I would have read this before I started high school. Maybe then, I would have learned earlier to be more of a filter than a sponge.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I loved it because it was hilarious and I couldn't put it down uhh until I read it cover to covet
B0015DROBO|1.0|I wanted to like this w0book but it was like reading a math book. No fun to much dry details about the charters you think they would stop but no just dull if you like the hunger games don't read this blllaaa
B000SZK41M|5.0|one of his best and even better at Christmas.  Bruce does not make them like this any more.  fun for a drinking game too.
B000HKW7E0|4.0|I don't like all of the vacation movies but this one was one of the best after the first one of course.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|This book was amazing, it never gets boring and it keeps the reader fascinated. I highly recommend this book. Simply put, stunning. Any reader will find it extremely engrossing.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I did not know that the world of the walking dead existed until the show came out and I love the show adjuvant wait for it to continue. l have come to find out that the books are just as cool as the show and just as soon as I get internet access I am going to buy volume 2. This book was awesome and I recommend it to anyone who has a liking for comics.
0670023329|5.0|From the outset I had known that this book would be a difficult and painful read. Upon reading, I found it truly difficult to put down. I did not want to put the book down and wanted to read more and more, to move from the atrocities described in the book, to a more happy ending. Classic American empathy. This book was completely and utterly moving and I think it's something that everyone should read. Painful, yet an easy read in terms of flow and length.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|Gotta agree that this should have been included!  Bad enoughI had to buy a case, a charger and face protector!!!  BAD BAD BAD Amazon!!!  (Software works OK.
B0081SPK0I|5.0|this free app is the best! I enjoy racing the other driver in order to win the race! final freeway 2 is better than the first! I look forward to trying it again! keep up the good work!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This has probably been on of the best books I've ever read and I'm sure I'll be quoting and re-reading it for an infinitive amount of time. I feel in love with this book like you fall asleep; slowly,then all at once.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|the movie had a few funny parts but that is about it. this movie looked way funnier in the previews. disappointed.
1451695195|1.0|Very little substantiation.  Mostly narcissistic reporting of the author's life, which is, of course, not the subject of the book.  Waste of time.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great book can't wait for the next one to come out so good a must read for anyone who loves romantic mystery
B0058YPG2K|5.0|At this point, Breaking Bad doesn't need introductions. One year from now it will surely deserve an eulogy. Best series of all times (an this in times of a lot of best series of all times).
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app is great for travel--I can't sleep without it. Excellent for noisy (or too quiet)  hotels. Thank you for creating the perfect white noise generator.
B002APU580|3.0|The movie is a great movie but the quality of the feed was not good at all. It kept skipping and the picture was not clear.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very easy to use and great card movement.<br />I appreciate the ability to tap the cards and get the movement, regardless the amount of cards in a stack.
B0076DEJMO|4.0|Well written and descriptive, uses many words to describe a fight or a blade of grass.<br />The story kept you wanting to read more.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|I definitely thought this was better than the first &#34;Total Recall&#34;, some of the first one was pretty cheesy, this one is worth a watch.
B007VUA7VO|1.0|Tabbed me out of anything I was doing everytime it went down a percent of my battery...I like what itnkept track of but until this problem is addressed it will stay at 1 star
0525457585|4.0|Lots of adventure, fun characters, and magical lands intertwined with life lessons. Bastian Balthazar Bux unknowingly embarks on the adventure of a lifetime when he steals the Neverending Story and cuts school to read the book.<br />A very thought provoking junior fiction fantasy novel which I'm sure would uncover more meaning each time it is read.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|My mom kept recommending the book to me, so I finally took the time to read it.  I am so glad I did!  I was amazed at how well the author made me feel like I was actually listening to a five year old tell his story.  It grabbed my attention and answered all of my thoughts or questions that popped in my mind as I was reading.  For example, what attempts did the mother make to escape?  Why would she hide her son in the closet at nights?  I highly recommend this book.
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|Funny movie. I would watch it again. Not quite the story line I expected but still worth watching. Good movie.
B0027MJU00|5.0|This book is gripping and mysterious. I highly recommend. it is immediately engaging and thought provoking. I can't put it down.
0756655730|5.0|My son loves this book, in depth look at creatures of the far past. Not just a coffee table book!
B0038W0OHQ|2.0|I bought this headset primarily because a USB connection is mandatory for my iMac without an adapter and SteelSeries seems to be one of the most highly recommended brands for gamers. If you own a Mac (OSX 10.8 in particular) and do not run games through Bootcamp/Windows OS avoid this headset- they wont work. At least they don't for me.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- Very comfortable, really the most important part of a headset, besides working sound. I like that it came with two ear cups, leather and cloth. The leather are great for noise cancelation, but I use the cloth to hear the wifey. I've seen others complain about a tight fit, but I have a tiny head and they're fine.<br />- Retractable mic is very nice, small footprint.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- first and foremost, my headset will only work for a few minutes in OSX 10.8, then sound will decay rapidly and cause the application I'm running to stutter. Not long after the sound will no longer work, and I must restart to get it back. Doesn't matter if I'm playing a game or watching a movie- so I don't believe this is an application specific issue. Removing the headset or reconfiguring the sound preferences will not bring it back. I don't see and kind of support drivers for OSX on Steelseries site, and for this reason I would completely abandon the headset if I didn't run games through Win 7 as well.<br />- I also use Ventrillo, and whenever I'm using Vent on my OSX platform people on the other end of the line say theres a very annoying, whirring sound.<br />-Overall the sound on the PC side isn't impressive either. I'm hardly a sound-phile, but these sound noticeably less impressive than headsets half their price.<br /><br />Finally, I'm using my 2nd pair, as one of the ear cups stopped transmitting sound after about 2 months. Steelseries customer support was reasonable and replaced them in a timely manner (I had to pay return shipping). Never had a headset malfunction so quickly though, hopefully not an issue I'll have to deal with again.<br />Given the reputation of Steelseries I'm quite disappointed with the headset overall and would find them very difficult to recommend.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|You never find out who he is writing to but that isn't the point. His story is the point. What he goes through, what he observes. That is the point.
B005MZIF4Q|5.0|Blah<br />Bl<br /><br />Free shipping on all sides of the world and get a school bag and get free app for a friend from facebook and get the world and get free
034544678X|4.0|This title is excellent for those who've read a few good how-to books and would now like to expand on their knowledge of dogs. To be clear this is *not* a training manual.  Instead it is a great addition to any dog lover's collection that may give more background on the work you are already doing with your canine companion.<br /><br />Patricia's writing style is really absorbing. Personal narrative evenly mixed with scientific exploration.  She speaks with equal parts love and authority on the subject of dogs.  I believe you'll get a stronger foundation for your skills as a handler/trainer as a result of reading The Other End of The Leash.  And you will also clear up many of the mysteries of common communication breakdowns between us primates and our beloved canid friends.<br /><br />BTW, I read her other book first, For The Love of A Dog, and I think the pair really complement one another.  Enjoy them both!<br /><br />*** As another reviewer noted, the negative description of Mexicans in the book was certainly a turn-off.  If anything, I suppose it showed the author's commitment to her research by opting to apparently risk danger (though nothing of the kind happened) by spending company with unsavory characters.  But it comes at the cost of fortifying a racist stereotype and seemed to me to be completely unnecessary and unrelated storytelling in the discussion of her findings about animals.  Minus one star.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Very interesting concept, well executed.  The twists are dished out in exactly the right cadence. Can't wait for the next installment!  This plot would make a great movie.
B006LSZECO|4.0|&#34;Gone Girl&#34; was indeed pretty engrossing, and had me sticking with it (not very complimentary, I know).I say that because about half-way through  got tired of Amy's page after page of  introspection.  i did want to see how it  came out in the end, so kept reading and glad I did.. .Loved the perky, sparkly, tripping along writing.  It was a very enjoyable read.
B0071XO8RA|1.0|Could not get into this one.  I usually like different subjects to read.  I only read a few pages and had to put it down.
B0096NCVAE|5.0|he enjoys putting his legos together..this set was very easy for my 6 year old son. this products was good as advertise
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|I love the fact that there are 20 tracks on this album, and it's considered to be a &#34;highlight&#34; compilation. So for pricing and song selection, it's a truly terrific bargain.  However, none of the actors who sing on this soundtrack are anywhere near as vocally gifted as their Broadway/London/National Touring Company counterparts.<br /><br />Seeing the film actors on screen &#34;emoting&#34; is different from hearing them on a record. Their appearances and the visual performances aren't there to sell the score or the scene. It's just you and their voices. They're not as talented as Broadway stars, or even their understudies.<br /><br />It's strange because I've seen Hugh Jackman on stage twice, and he was delightful. It could be that his exuberant demeanor makes up for his singing prowess.<br /><br />Download this album as a souvenir of the movie experience--it's only $5--or play it to get you in the mood for the movie adaptation. But if you want to be transported by the sheer aural experience alone, play the stage cast albums.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|this game is something I enjoy, my daughter enjoys, even my son loves it!!! I cant believe people don't like it!!!!
B007V65R54|3.0|I like this book, in particularly the strong advocate for the Bayesian thinking and applications of Bayesian statistical methods. The concluded take-home messages for daily lives are enlightening: (i) thinking in probabilities; (ii) framing your context before weighting the observations; (iii) trying and learning. I wish there is a half star so that I can put 3 1/2 for this book.<br /><br />On the other side, the writing has room for improvement. For me, it is slightly verbose, and can be benefited by  condensing sections by reducing details. Another point I feel a little unsatisfied is that the author seems to successfully avoid answering the very first question posed in his title. Maybe I just did not read careful enough, and it would be nice if anybody can enlighten me a little bit on that.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was very weary a about this novel and I can say that I am thoroughly surprised. The story is as inviting as it is addictive. Can't wait to read the second instalment.
142314189X|5.0|My grandson requested this set for Christmas.  He was ecstatic!  The set is hardbound and came plastic-wrapped with no damage!!  Great gift!
B00AESN8XY|4.0|This is a pretty fun game to make the time go by.  It has 3 levels of difficulty and lots of options to develop your plague.  Pretty easy to play and good graphics (although it's not a graphic intensive game).  Hope this never happens in the real world and it stays in the game!
B008BRC7BE|5.0|this is an amazing item and all procedes go to help the earthquake victims of Armenia with a charity tune called out of my mind, with a host of other musicians like Nicko Mcbrain  drummer from Iron Maiden, Ex metallica bassist Jason Newstead, and  The late great John Lord, also HIM guitarist who happens to be dating  Tony Iommi's daughter, this 2 disc contains some previously unreleased tracks and some others that featured both Gillan & Iommi, from the Black Sabbath thrashed album, also Iommi and Glen Hughes, as well as Gillan band and a unrealesed Deep Purple track! a real treat for charity, and fans alike!
B009FB3XTA|5.0|I just really love this CD.  It just soothes my soul. Love it.  I find it very relaxing and calming.  Love the various artist and mix of songs from the other CD's.
B000BKHL1K|5.0|Easy to install!  Everyone who sees it, loves it!  It is like a piece of artwork.  Holds 8 bottle of wine.
B0050R0YB8|4.0|Very cool addition to any Star Wars Lego collection...I thought it was pretty easy to build overall and most of it is quite sturdy withe the exception of a few pieces...you can actually hold the ship and move it around easily without anything really breaking. One disappointment was the amount of space for the bridge...you can't really even fit the characters inside and put the cover back on....other than that its cool.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|Saw it in the theater - second time even better.  Laugh out loud funny and loved the music and characters.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|I bought this Cd for my boss (by the Boss, ha ha) as a Christmas gift. We share a love of music, and talk about Bruce Springsteen often. He was really thrilled with it. (maybe I'll get a raise!)
B003U9W3GM|4.0|This is a rivetting read and an insight into the mind of a good young American marine who was very lucky to have survived the war. It confirms my view that the US Army is far more complacent about throwing men into battle regardless of the cost in life. This is in comtrast to the British who, with a fifth of the US population, can't afford to waste humans.<br />The book also makes one question - more earnestly than does the author - the necessity, after the summer of 1945, of invading the islands (and suffering horrendous losses). Some islands could well have been bypassed and blockaded - especially as, by then, the American government knew  it was about to unleash  the ultimate weapon.<br />I give it four stars bcs it tended to be repetitive.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I started watching Game of Thrones on HBO. I decided to read the books on a recommendation from my colleague. The book is very well written and even though I'm familiar with the plot because of the tv show, I was not at all bored by the book and enjoyed the additional insights into each of the characters' lives.
B004GYY714|4.0|Great product for me. I am on the road a lot. Nice to be able to find local news and NOAA weather. Like the scanner channels also.
B001LF4IA6|5.0|Love this CD! I purchased it for a friend for Christmas. If you love Bruce, you will love this Cd.
B0044XRIMW|5.0|My daughter and I watch every year and sing along. It is a good story and anyone who likes musicals should see it.
B007T2XC7A|4.0|My first Norah album and ain't mad about it, she definitely delivers! I would suggest this album to anyone missing a lil soul in their life.
B009LA1QW6|5.0|My daughter had asked for this and the other Lana Del Rey cd for Christmas. She was so excited to receive them she stopped everything and downloaded them to itunes to put on her phone.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I thought the book was amazing! The movie I hope will be just as good. I liked it a lot  but for the longest time I did not know he was on drugs,or that whole ordeal with his aunt Helen. Other than that it was great!
B0086700CM|5.0|hello could yall please do me a favor and add fun run to the kindle fire because its on ipod
B009329ZF2|1.0|lame. To much character development in the begging in and not enough action, very slow moving. Should have rented at the REDBOX for a $1!
B008645YH6|5.0|Christmas gift and my daughter was inside out thrilled to receive it. Immediately put it on her itunes and loaded onto her phone.
B000VX042U|5.0|I will recommend these shoes to everybody. The leather smells so good. The Shoe is comfortable !!!<br /><br />You can wear it with Jeans, Cargo pants, even wearing casual clothes.
B001E5CH0G|5.0|An instant christmas hit that will be watched for years. Will likely, one day, become a holiday mainstay with movies like A Christmas Story, Christmas Vacation, and Home Alone. The Blu-ray version makes the experience that much more enjoyable. Highly recommended.
B009YP9L7U|1.0|I didn't really like it cuz it wuz juss so boring n I think u could do betta wit dis book
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I read the book and fell in love. Having watched the show after, the book is the clear winner and paints a better picture. Must try.

0307454568|5.0|The book arrived very quickly and was in perfect condition.  The Dragon Tattoo trilogy was very entertaining and I am looking forward to completing it.

B009KHDT0C|4.0|Actually quite suprized at this movie, i thought it was goin go be all fluff and stupid, but turned out to be a great storyline and movie.  Guess never judge a book by it's cover...
B001O7JHJ8|1.0|Did ever get the cd & I jusy let it go. It is not worth fighting for an dit was not that much to lose.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|A nice and emotional father-daughter story. I was hooked on it since the beginning until the very end. Almost cried a few times.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this game, even for the free version. this game is super addicting and It is great for passing the time.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I put my kindle into the kindle right away and haven't regretted it since! It should keep me from breaking it.
B000FC130E|5.0|He really knows how to weave a story and his narrative, which he gets to expand on and put his own touches to the Neverwhere story he didn't have time in the BBC series. If you wanted more out of the TV series or want to read a Gaiman book this is definantly recommended.
B000YHG72E|5.0|This is a must watch for the family...non-stop hilarity with a really sweet story line....Everyone will love Buddy the Elf!
B008QE9XD2|5.0|Very Funny movie! My 12 year old and 15 year old love it! Good family movie. It arrived on time!
1419705849|5.0|See above note on the other book in the series that I purchased for him. He loved them. Thanks Diane
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I hope  the books by Jeff Kinney  never end.<br />I thought that  this is better than book three and four.
B000VHMF0A|4.0|Essential Bob Marley album, great island vibe. Helps you forget winter. Have been listening to this on Pandora bit get an occasional song there
B005LAIH4A|5.0|One of my favorite children's stories ever! They did a really good job putting this movie together and you couldn't beat the price anywhere!
B0049VZ222|5.0|Great acting.  Fantastic storyline.  Plus lots and lots of zombie killing.  I've been addicted to this show sine the first episode.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I read numerous good reviews on this CD beforehand and they were justified to say the least! I love nearly every song on the album and I eagerly await their next one...
B003TSEEDY|5.0|One of the most brilliant stories. A very faint ending, but I think that is the point. I would hope that anyone would pick this up, I would recommend it for everyone. Very heartfelt and real.
B002ZG999U|5.0|A very action packed movie..would recommend to anyone that loves action movies..this movie definitely takes the cake=action every 2 seconds!
B005LAIH4A|3.0|The movie was great, the packaging was all torn up. I guess for $4.99, you can't expect too much. Just hard to give for a gift with the way it came.
B007DIQC90|5.0|I was blown away by this CD and I can't stop playing it! My addiction is undeniable and I look forward to all their future albums!
B005HSL626|5.0|I think you'd love it. But you'll. have to buy it first (it is for free) you would love it surtantly too!!!!!!!!
B004EPYZPS|5.0|This movie turned out way better then expected! It's a really cool story and I would recommend it any day.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I have read this book and I really enjoyed it.  I read it for hours on end trying to reach the end.  I suggest it for any one from age 1 to 101.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I'm seeing reviews from October reporting the news feed issue ... why is it still around? Works fine on my phone so this looks like pure laziness to me. Fix it already.
0718143361|3.0|Not in keeping with Tom Clancy's level of work. Just a rehash of other adventures - too easy for the teams - nothing works that well.
B002UNMW7O|5.0|I loved this movie! Made the perfect gift! Great price too! I would definitely recommend to anyone that loves action movies.
B007SSEU9O|2.0|Great actress in a bad plot.  Feel asleep in 20 minutes. I watched this with my 33 year old son and my 25 year old daughter and they both went to bed on it.
B003UESJF6|5.0|My children kept borrowing this DVD from other family members, so it was time to get our own copy this year.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I haven't watched the movie, highly recommend the book.<br />Reminds me of the sort story The Lottery. This book should be required reading in high school. Great book.  Can't wait to read more by this author.
B009EEGJQW|5.0|This version was just as good if not better than the original!  Terrific chemistry between all of the characters which was lacking in the original.
B000VHMF0A|5.0|Great songs.  Always liked the Wailers but first time really listening to them.  Multiple versions of some songs but still a must have.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|We got this DVD because it was a ridiculously low price and because one family member loved this movie.  Now we can see if we do, too.
B0070XFNDE|5.0|One of three books in this series. They can be depressing but the writing is fabulous I read<br />All three and couldn't put them down. I was sorry when the books were over.
B002M85TF4|5.0|This was a great musical!!  Shirley Jones and Robert Preston did a fantastic job with this movie!!  Highly recommend if you want to see a wholesome movie with the family!
074356619X|5.0|Awesome buy, great advise, well worth listening to over and over and over.  I love hearing the different voices and different stories.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|We borrowed this movie from a family member who moved away, so it was time for us to get our own DVD.
1449410243|5.0|gave to my cat lover wife for christmas and we were both in tears reading aloud the first couple comics and the poster (which she will post at work so everyone can see the genious that is the Oatmeal)<br /><br />Great gift!!!

B008VBYN80|5.0|Perfect game at perfect price<br />I can play thus game 24\7<br />The only thing I don't like us the energy
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I have had an excellent experience in collecting videos that entertain and educate me because of how easy this product is to use...
0345803485|5.0|The author knows how to write to keep the reader hooked.  A page turner for me.  A grea book that I have read in a long time.  Way the go E L james.  Can you please write more b
160094048X|5.0|As the mother of a child with milk and egg allergies, I am constantly searching for recipes that the whole family can enjoy without milk and egg ingredients. This book is a God send. Every recipe I have tried (at least 20) has been delicious. I have received many compliments on these terrific cookies from non-vegans. People have no clue that these are vegan. The instructions are very easy to follow and the authors provide many helpful tips to encourage success.<br /><br />I rarely write reviews, but I am so grateful to have delicious cookies that include my son with the rest of his family and friends. I recommend this book EVERYONE - not just those with dietary restrictions.
B004EPYZP8|4.0|The Lincoln Lawyer is a good thriller that keeps your attention from start to finish. I recommend this video for a good viewing.
B007HACDLK|3.0|I liked this novel as it adapts itself to the current world situation, specially in the middle east. A little short for my taste or preference, but can keep you up at night.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|A nice shell for the Kindle.  We went simple for my sons since we expected, and were right, that stickers and other personalizations would be their goal.  Easy access and yet durable.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|I was absolutley thrilled that I got this in the mail before Christmas.  My family had a blast re watching this old classic!
B006TJXZ30|5.0|When I got this app I was very happy because I am a huge emailer and was tired of arguing with my n brother over who got to use the computer. Now I can communicate with my friends at anytime and when you look at the email you don't have to open it to read the first part of it cause it shows you the first part of it below the person's name! I know what your thinking this person is weird and I gotta agree but I hope this was help full to you
B004LZEV4Q|5.0|Bought this for my daughter for x-mas and had each family member read a page. It turned out great. Had grandma start of first with a message, and then each uncle in order of age, and grandpa to finish it. A keepsake my daughter will hold on to for the rest of her life.<br /><br />My only complaint is that it took triple the time to get to my house than supposed to. Didn't have it in time for x-mas, but luckily the family got together again 2 months later.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy to navigate, multiple translations, audio available, higlighting and bookmarks, just an all around great app.  Even my children have it on their devices.
B0042RJWTC|4.0|The series itself deserves 5 stars - but oddly the discs are labeled with the wrong episode numbers. Not a big deal - but annoying when you're trying to find an episode that is not actually on the disc it says it's on.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|This is Angry Birds meets Captain Kirk.  The effects of gravity (and the reverse) on movement of objects makes this a fun and challenging game.  I recommend it to all Angry Birds fans.
B009VB7QQA|5.0|Excellent movie with plenty of action, a history lesson with a touch of fantasy. The movie will keep you on the edge of your seat. Well worth watching.
0061122416|5.0|It's like trying to explain your own personal epiphany... it just can't be done... you need to live it for yourself, or in this case, read it... you will get out of it all that is originally within you to begin with. Enough said...
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have red numerous accounts of out-of-body experiences and felt that there must have been some sort of brain function responsible for the images that are recalled. Up to now. This account is stunning in its imagery and is certainly for the skeptic to consider.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|This, at first glance is just an offshoot of the Angry birds.  After a few minutes of playing it becomes addictive.  It really is fun, especially trying out different formations of items to create the travel mechanism for the pig.  It is great.
B0095R64AO|3.0|Don't write a movie and then produce and star in it. At least Segel didn't direct. A lot of this movie was meaningful and semi-deep, but got so bogged down along the way. The funniest scene is dinner in Michigan with all the deer stuff. Too many other unfunny gags including the toe bit because it was just thrown in without a follow-thru. Segel seems to be obsessed with nudity - his own, which we could all live without. I gave it 3*** because I just love romance movies, but 5-Years is seriously flawed. Watch it anyway.
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|channel ORANGE by Frank Ocean was a breath of fresh air for R&B fans like myself who have grown disinterested in the genre  over the last decade. I like to think of Frank Ocean's sound as Maxwell crossed with Kid Cudi. Ocean can flat out sing and shows it time and time again on this album. It's not just the singing, the whole sound of the album is vibrant and alive and now. Awesome debut.
B001UV4XIS|1.0|I am not a Harry Potter fan.  I sincerely do not understand the attraction.  The books are poorly written and the films dark and clunky and the characters and actors playing them annoying, at least for my tastes.  And I will never know why American kids like this British drivel.  But I digress.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I watched Part I and II or the long-winded finale with my adult son and daugther, since they are fans, and after spending 4+ hours doing so, I came away even more astounded that the Harry Potter chronicles became a popular rave. The plot is terribly contrived and unoriginal.  So the evil wizard killed Harry's parents (for some reason) and now Harry gets his revenge and saves the world (at least I think that was the plot).  And if anyone was expecting a poignant ending, looking elsewhere.  The ending was uncreative and unemotional.  Just like the entire series.<br /><br />I have posted elsewhere on my visceral dislilke of Potter and JK Rowlings inability as a writer.  Why HP became so popular will forever be a mystery to me, like black holes.  And that's what it felt watching this movie, falling into a literary and dramatic black hole.
B003AQBYUG|5.0|First of all, this is a must-have for any Alien fan.  The special features are in-depth, interesting, and add to the overall experience.  The extended versions of each film are also included.  The other reviews cover this topic pretty well, so I will move on.<br /><br />I purchased the British, region free, import (I live in the U.S.) due to the super low price and have had absolutely no problems playing any of the discs on my PS3 (PS3 purchased in 2011, 160 GB version).  The case is plastic, not cardboard, with all of the discs in one large blu-ray case, with plastic disc &#34;pages.&#34;  I highly recommend the import, especially due to the fact that the import was about 1/2 the price as the US version when I bought it, and contains all of the same content.
383651723X|5.0|A great photographer. Too bad he died. Very under-<br />rate but a master of the profession. Never get tired of<br />looking at his photos.<br />Julian Wasser
B009HEJXFS|4.0|The lesson learned by J was touching.  You need to listen to the conversations at the beginning to catch the full meaning of what he learns. Made for a fun evening.
B008B8A9V8|5.0|I have this book in both print and kindle, when on the road is is perfect on my iPad or phone.  I can use it in class with the projector as a teaching tool
B000JVT09C|1.0|Not sure why, but this disc will not play on any of my bluray payers.  I seem to remember playing it when I first bought it, but the last few times I tried, it won't even recognize as a valid disc.  Have heard of others with this problem on various forums, but since it's been almost four years since purchase, out of luck.  I would gather that the company had a bad run of discs, and that they decided not to recall them because not enough people complained.  And since I did not complain in time, I don't count.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Imsure hope Kate Morton keeps her stories coming...she truly is one of my favorite authors.<br />This one really had me fooled with the surprise ending.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It took me half way thru the book before it caught my interest. Then, it really took off and got good.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love this game it is so fun and I love the puzzles.what is really fun is putting the pieces together
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I think it is one of the best cooking games there is. if you want to just try I would get the free one first.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|It's a classic, what can I say?  There are many versions of this in movie form but there is nothing like a book.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This is our favorite Christmas tradition.  Chevy Chase is a genius and this movie is hysterical!  It wouldn't be Christmas without this movie.
B005FFW46S|4.0|Good entertainment, as Pratchett's Diskworld books always are, it's hard for every book to be quite as much fun as Going Postal, Making Money, Hogfather and Equal Rites.  It's still delightful reading in the top third of the Discworld series, though.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Extremely well written.  A very enjoyable read.  I read this before I went to see the movie and as usually  an outstanding book is impossible to bring to the big screen. However in 3-D it was a worthwhile visual experience.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Good book, keeps your interest. Typical Connelly book.  Recommend for all readers who like mystery and suspense<br />Not too far fetched
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is an incredible read. I finished it in one long sitting, because I had to know. I never thought the end would be as it is. Excellent.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Book 2 gets mor into the plot .. The book was good . I did like , the writer does repeat herself alot . I think she did do a good job since this was her first books published
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|The third wheel is a short read,the same as every Wimpy Kid book. If you're looking for a quick childish, middle school book' then this is the book for you
B004SDSSFY|3.0|I'm finding it a bit difficult to navigate through the app. I attribute this to my lack of understanding on how the app works.
B00A4TKDKY|1.0|What can I say? I've been a Buddy fan since I noticed SRV put \\"Mary had a little lamb\\" on his first record (and a Buddy Guy song on most all subsequent recordings) and have honestly seen him live more times than I can recall. Some of the more recent shows I've seen him do were a bit of a let down but I love him so he gets the benefit of the doubt. But this recording blows. I thought this would have been recorded at the new legends where he plays almost monthly, but it's a old poor quality recording. I don't even think it's from the soundboard, sounds more like a single microphone. That would explain the shitty mix. Much of it his guitar and vocal are almost invisible compared to backing band. To compare, find/buy/listen to the bootleg - import recording \\"Still call it the blues\\" recorded live (off the board) at the original Legends on Buddy's' 53rd birthday. SRV sits in. Awesome sound quality and feel!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book was the best out of all 3 in the series . Would recommend to both men and woman to read .
B000FC1JCQ|5.0|Extreme care was taken in formatting this classic for the digital market. I'm about 3/4 of the way through it and haven't found an error yet. Very well done, and a welcome replacement for my tattered copy of the original.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This case is absolutely perfect to protect the Kindle.  It is lightweight and is of good quality.  I would highly recommend this product to others.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|Boo boo boo boo boring boring boring boring boring boring boring boring boring boring boring boring boring boring boring boring Boston's read it just old American dictionary
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wasn't intertested in reading but so many people had recommended so I finally read all 3 books in the series . The first book is very slow getting into the plot . If you don't think of this as a sex book and think about how this man has been treated as a child and why he wants to be the best at everything you will ENJOY ... and this is the writers first books she has published .<br /><br />This book has made many people think ... talk an act apon  ENJOY
0857860801|5.0|My daughter is a cat lover, she has 3 cats, including  a therapy cat! I got her this book for Christmas and everything had to stop while she read the book to her grandma and great aunt. She really enjoys all of these books so they are the perfect gift for cat lovers.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a favorite game of mine.  It is easy to pick up where you left off.  It is also ideal to keep you busy on an airplane for hours.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Great love story. Not like your average love story but awesome nonetheless. I couldn't put it down! I highly recommend it
B005LAIHY0|5.0|I am a fan of the Alien movies, so I was so excited for this movie. I thought it was awesome! The CG was amazing.
B009VB97EY|2.0|Did not like the movie.  Waaaay to nasty for me.  But Channing is adorable.<br />Don't know why he picked this movie to star in.  Nasty movie!!<br />And, Matthew McCognahy  (spell?) was really slimey.... Lordy, he was slimey!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|There should certainly be a warning sign on this series of books.  I got quite an education reading these.  I'm speachless....
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I chose this rating  because I  love any thing with destruction or stupidity.I liked how Greg was like totally stupid. I would recommend this to my boyfriend
B004RGHWIQ|5.0|My daughter and I love this movie. Great movie you should buy it it doesn't have to be the 3d version to enjoy it but I prefer 3d over regular 2d and so does my daughter.
B0042816YK|5.0|Just loved it, have watched it dozens of times aleady. Like that it has the Directors cut in addition to the theater version. Came on time, will enjoy it for as long as I want a romance movie!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Well, not the type of books I normally read but the story line kept me interested.  The writer keep the imagination active.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Such a simple game but so lovely. Enjoyed to much. It seems to stump me occasionally but then I take a break and come back.kick back and played free mode or test your skill on puzzles, speed, and precision on the timed skills. Definitely download. Enjoy!
1451629192|4.0|this is a very sad and disturbing book to read, I couldnt sleep well for nights after reading it you just cant imagine how anybody can do this to a child.
B004RGHWIQ|5.0|I am not a huge 3D buff, but if the 3D of any movie is worth seeing it is the 3D of Coraline.  Some of the stuff in the very foreground was blurry, but other than that the 3D worked great.  The movie itself is wonderful, the art i wonderful, the story is wonderful, everything is just great.<br /><br />It is legit creepy though, I would not recommend to sensitive children or adults with phobias of spiders, needles, kidnapping, bugs, creepy dolls, buttons, people made out of taffy, rats/mice, people who are just clothing stuffed with something, being mute, having your mouth sewn, and maybe enclosed spaces/ deep holes.  And people transforming into stuff, I guess?
B009D5VNLS|5.0|My daughter and I throughly enjoyed this movie.  It totally depicts the thoughts that go through a child's mind who does not get their way.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I just finished the book and it was great I loved it I'm gonna bye more Jeff Kinney is a very good author.
B008LD09LS|5.0|I received a drone for Christmas and downloaded the app for the fire. It is simply amazing that you can control this device so easily with a wireless connection. To reviewers before me you must unpair the device from anything you connected to originally. It should work just right.
1608862801|5.0|Love this show, love this comic, sooo happy to be able to finally get it in TPB!<br /><br />Pros:<br />Ryan North is a perfect fit for Adventure Time!<br />Story kept as canon as possible!<br />TPB = no ads!<br />Cover gallery for the huge number of alternate covers, many by popular indie artists!<br />Includes Free Comic Book Day story (idk about you but when I made to my my local comic shop for FCBD they had already given out all of the adventure time books)<br /><br />Cons:<br />B-side stories by different writers/artists not included (ryan north posted that they would be collected in a different trade at a later date, I was unable to get anything from boom to confirm this though) :c
B007IXWKUK|5.0|After reading the first book, I was very anxious to move on to the next one.  The writer never lost the ability to surprise me with things I never knew.
B00AHSINKO|2.0|Great actors in many films, but we found this one slow and boring. As a comedy, it didn't do it for us. As a  marriage therapy lesson, it does make good points.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|That's all there is to say. And to get 14 words .... that's all there is to say twice. the end. 14
B002361MLA|4.0|Inspirational and definitely a good read. I would recommend to others. I pick this book up when I need a reality check, to focus on the present instead of letting my mind roam.
B00632HWOG|3.0|I'm sure this app is fine for someone with a yahoo account.  I don't have one so, I have not really used it.
0812993292|5.0|\\"The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry\\" is one of those books that will stay with you long after you've read it.  It starts out as an unassuming little story that becomes a deeply emotional and rewarding tale.  Harold's pilgrimage, which begins on a spur of the moment decision, becomes a pilgrimage of hundreds of miles and evolves into a pilgrimage through emotions and events of the past.  The effects of his pilgrimage ripple outward and impact the person to whom he is going to see, his wife, his neighbor, and numerous individuals he meets on the way.  The book is an exploration of how lives can change in the blink of an eye and how those events reverberate through time.  Human relationships are fragile, yet resilient, and can endure if those involved are willing to face hard truths and open themselves to others.
B005LAIHZE|1.0|Good book.  Terrible movie. I have to come up with 10 more words?  Poo on this  Poo on this  POO
B007704HO6|5.0|As an owner of two rescues, I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I am looking forward to seeing the movie too.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is a fun game to play.  Since it was an app, it downloaded quicly and was readily available for play.
B000MR1V22|5.0|This is my favorite comedy of all time. Though the situations presented are not \\"normal\\" this movie provides the best representation of normal family life, and mostly in a hilarious way. Alan Arkin is particularly brilliant.
B00A757EFW|2.0|It is the exact same boards as the original Pac-Man. However, it is very hard to navigate the direction on my Kindle Fire.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Reminded me of earlier Clancy - good story line - well written with good pace - definitely recommend it to Clancy fans.
1594135851|5.0|Got this for my husband.  He couldn't put the series down until he finished all the books he could get his hands on.
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|What a huge waste of resources. Not sure what the purpose of this movie was, but unless it was to hit the reset button on the Batman movie concept we have little to make us look forward to the next release. In other words, if I had believed what I read in the negative reviews I could have saved a few bucks.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Typical Angry Birds. My son absolutely loves it. The birds have new and exciting powers. Great game for kids. Angry Birds never disappoints.
B000006NUW|3.0|This has to be a frustrating review.<br />On the one hand this is absolutely essential.<br /><br />1. The sound. It is universally acknowledged among those who<br />care about the sound, that this is the best sounding<br />release of Motown material that has ever been<br />available on cd. Hearing these classic tracks here<br />on a decent system, after hearing them from any other<br />digital source is nothing less than shocking.  In this<br />context, grousing about the fact that these are mono,<br />not stereo is nothing short of puzzling if not ridiculous,<br />even if there were some theoretical virtue to stereo mixes.<br /><br />2. the song selection.  Although tastes differ, there are no<br />clear mistakes here.  Given the limit of 100 tracks, the<br />Decisions cannot be faulted.  The only possible exception is<br />the scanty of the Supremes, who had 12 of the 20 #1 hits produced<br />at Motown in the Sixties.  Even that is understandable, since that<br />space was put to good use in an attempt to represent some of the<br />wonderful talent that is usually overlooked on \\"hits\\" collections.<br /><br />But at four cds and 100+ tracks, I think it needs to be more than<br />just a collection of hits. Otherwise it just sits on your shelf.<br />I think that for a set this size to be listenable it has to tell a<br />story.  The James Brown box does.  The Ray Charles box does.<br /><br />If this box tells a story it is a false one.  This doesn't give an<br />accurate account of the Motown story.  As it turns out it couldn't<br />possibly do the job (and I have reason to believe this was job it<br />was intended to do )limited to 100 tracks.  It just isn't enough room.,<br /><br />I regret to say that a second box covering the same period wouldn't<br />fix the problem.  There are more than enough classic tracks to<br />fill another box the same size, but then you would just have<br />two hits collections on the shelf (except the second would have<br />fewer true hits).  To fix the problem, these additional<br />tracks would have to be inserted into the flow of the first<br />box to give a more accurate picture of the evolution of Motown.<br />They'd have to have two 4-disc collections. One covering perhaps<br />59-65 and the other 66-71.  Oh well.
B004SDEP38|3.0|I'm finding it a bit difficult to navigate through the app. I attribute this to my lack of understanding on how the app works.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|loved it came fast and just what i need to cool down the computer it made it so much better
B0073PPNE8|5.0|Had a few problems with the feed....but the movie was awesome!!! I loved the book too, but the movie offers something totally different....
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This show is so addictive.  I am so tired of lousy sitcoms with lazy writing and terrible reality shows.  This show is a new and fresh idea for my generation's television viewing and I enjoyed watching every minute of it.
B00177E1Z0|5.0|Great music!  I've seen the movie so much that I know the part of the movie when I hear the songs.
1451688091|5.0|With all the excitement of the movie this is a must have for all the Lincoln fans.  Doris Kearns Goodwin knows how to bring history alive.
B003VANOFY|4.0|good product made with thought and should stand the test of time and hard knocks<br />using on a daily basis with no problems
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Great plot. I find there are a lot of characters with very difficult names so am having a bit of trouble keeping them all straight.I like the way the author has  headed each chapter with a character name and advances the story through them. I would recommend this book especially to very dedicated readers who have the time to sort out all the threads of this story line.
0385742886|5.0|This is a prequel.  If you haven't read the maze runner books you should really read them first.  because this book will give everything away.  But the book is very good as are all of the maze runner series.
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|As a songwriter and journalist, this app is very useful to me. I can easily organize thoughts, ideas, and research all in one app. However, my friend and family often play with my Kindle and I don't particularly like my unfinished work being available for all to see. Fix the password issue, and you have a five star app!
B001E75QH0|4.0|My son was on an Indy kick for a while. Great entertainment for the portable DVD player...for those moments in the car on vacations...and beyond.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I use it for keeping up with  my daughter`s latest posts. I find it confusing with poor help for my old brain.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I love this whole series and I just started the books fairly recently.  Now I am totally hooked.  It was great that five of the books were already written.  When I would finish one, I would just order the next.  Now I've finished Book Five and I'm finding it very difficult to wait for Book Six!  I haven't been this engaged in a book in many many years.  The storyline is dense, complicated many layered and I see many more readings in the future!!  Hurry up, Mr. Martin!!!!  I need to get on with the story!
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Round 1 was great. I am looking forward to round two which should delve into the characters and hopefully give us more background.
B005PK553C|5.0|This show is so amazing.  Got so addicted.  Kept me in suspense the whole time.  Really demented! Hopefully season 2 is just as good.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|love i  the usual game . easy to use with the double click. nice sound and graphics.  easy to use.
B00AFEY354|5.0|This movie is definitely one I think everyone should see. I don't watch much movies anymore because for me it is so hard to find any good ones that actually mean something or have true meaning to them but this movie does. I haven't read the book yet but that didn't hinder me from connecting with the characters or feeling for Charlie towards the end. Also Emma Watson did remarkable and her American accent is believable. You should buy this movie when it comes out.
B00785P2QC|3.0|I like the game but what I did not like was all the interaction on Facebook. I'm not playing a Facebook game so that I do not have to post anything on my wall.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I'm a big Alien fan, this is must have for si-fi nuts. Back to back action and suspense, this is what I've been waiting for.
B0063IH60K|4.0|lots of nice variations.like the options . nice to be able choose if hand is winnable<br />nice graphics and sound
B009GED3HS|5.0|I have watch all the seasons, and even thought the latest seasons (maybe 6 and 7) didn't really live up to the name...  I am glad season 8 came back rocking!  I have lmfao so hard again!!!  Can't wait to see what keeps happening with the gang!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Too bad I couldn't figure out how to give it less than 1 star. Here's another review that will be ignored and the news feed will still not load properly.
B0084I9QI2|5.0|Supreme!!! I always thought that the Bad album and tour was his stamp as a solo artist, when you look at other artist at that time and today, Michael is superior bar-none. WHo's BADD!!
B00006CXXU|5.0|My mom loves christina aguilera so when i saw this CD and how much it was i had to snag it. no scratches or marks and it was fully wrapped
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much because it is so much fun I love when you run nexus it is fun
B004I2K4DY|5.0|I had seen the PBS presentation of this album and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The concert version of Les Mis is wonderful!
B005LJETYI|5.0|I loved this book. It was fast paced and well written. It got a little side tracked with the short back story of Rita, but other than that I loved it. It may be the most fun I have had reading all year.
B00006AW63|1.0|Received the dvd to give to my 4 year old grandson for Christmas and low and behold it did not work on any of the dvd players we tried. He was very disappointed when he was not able to watch it on Christmas day with his cousins, I have heard that this has happened to numerous people that have ordered from Amazon. Can't tell you about the actual product because it was non functional.
B009E3EYMY|5.0|You may never get a chance to see the best rock and roll band play together again. This is worth every penny. I was very happy with the quality of this blue ray and the sound quality was awesome!
1582701709|4.0|This book was for my wife and she is just starting it.  She seems to be enjoying it at the present time.
B007HACDLK|2.0|The book reminded me of a newspaper covering an event. The characters were never developed and<br />no suspense. A lot of military talk(guns, ammo, and helicopters).
B005HSL626|4.0|I chose this rating because my kids really enjoy this game and have soo much competing against eachother you wont be disappointed
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Simply the best of the three movies. Tom Hardy was an excellent choice for Bane and Christian Bake did Batman justice once again. Top notch movie. Will be buying it on bluray.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was funny to read about the character's life and challenges.<br /><br />Gregory has a fun filled life with many challenges. In this book Gregory has to face the Valentine dance. It was funny to read about how he tries to get a date to the dance.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|The music chosen for this last of the twilight series movies was well chosen. I have purchased all the music available for each movie and have not been disappointed. I would certainly recommend all the music even if you do not happen to be a Twilight fan.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|this app was great 4 me because I love 2 write stories and now all of my information is their when I go to type it!!<br />this app is free, can't believe it!! lol
B000URWYTS|5.0|This is a great historical novel! I did a combination of listening to the audio book and reading the kindle book (audio while driving and reading while at home), and I really loved doing it that way.
B0025KVLRY|5.0|The best band that their has ever been.  The music transcends all time and will always be incredible to listen to.
B008RC72G8|5.0|Sort of off beat and campy humor but very well done.  Great cast and typical Tim Burton type of visuals, sound track, and cinematography.  It is very stylized and like any other humor material, it may appeal to a select audience with certain taste.  With the great price, it is like only renting the film twice on Vudu.  So it is totally worth it as a purchase.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|If you enjoy playing Mahjong, then this app is for you!  I'm impressed with how good this game looks on the Kindle.  And....it's free!  What could be better?
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Different for Stephen King, but still a great read! Turns out he does a love story really well, but it also is done his way, with all of the twists and turns that his amazing mind can take. Hang on for a wild ride and great read! If you've ever wondered how different things would have been if Kennedy had not died, this is the book for you. Loved it!
