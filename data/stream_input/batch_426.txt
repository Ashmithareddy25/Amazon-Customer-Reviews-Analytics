B000002KDO|4.0|It's like half and album.  Like Sabbath were making a great album and then got too high to work anymore and release an album so short it should be called an EP.  Great for what's their but looses a star for what's missing. <br /> <br />1.Sweet Leaf-Yep it's about marijuana or about a pack or cigarettes from Ireland that had a label that claimed they were the sweet leaf.  Either way this is a great heavy song with cool drum work during the solo. <br />2.After Forever-The first time I heard this song the windtunnel effect at the beginning made me skip it.  Then I actually listened to this song and loved it.  The lyrics may be decieving at parts (would you like to see the pope on the end of a rope/Do you think he's a fool?) was actually pro religion. <br />3.Embryo[Instrumental]-Essentially the intro to Children of the Grave this 30 second song is real fun and is an excellent lead in to Children of the Grave. <br />4.Children Of The Grave-Bill Ward's first overdub in which it sounds like tin cans banging in the backround.  Cool song that seems to be about inciting revolution among hippies but I may be wrong.  This song is the first predecessor to speed metal as it is the first Sabbath song with some speed throughout the whole song. <br />5.Orchid[Instrumental]-Intro to Lord of this World with some good fingerpicking guitar work by Tony. <br />6.Lord Of This World-Great metal song.  Good old fashioned hard rocking with a dynamic solo from Tony.  Kind of like the evil twin of Into The Void.  They are only seperated by.......... <br />7.Solitude-A bluesy slow song that's kind of directionless. <br />8.Into The Void-Ballbreaking rock with a great minute long instrumental intro.  This song works as an excellent closer and could be about the Cold War and the space race if I'm not mistaken. <br /> <br />Overall-A great record that's bogged down by it's insanely short length which is nearly 7 minutes shorter than any other Sabbath album.
0451163516|5.0|The Man from St. Petersburg is definitely one of Follet's best books. I've read several, but not all, and this novel sticks out because of its strong characterization and tragic turns of events. On Follett's website, he calls this an &quot;Edwardian&quot; novel. I don't know what that means, but this book has a different feel to it.<br /><br /> The &quot;man&quot; from St. Petersburg is Felix, a Russian anarchist conspiring to kill Prince Olav and prevent Russia from entering WWI on the side of the English. Felix comes to England and makes his plans and is ready to kill Olav as he rides in a stagecoach, when he sees a woman who is his long lost lover.<br /><br /> That woman is Lidia, Olav's aunt. It seems too convenient that Lydia would reappear in Felix's life now, but that conflict is the basis for the entire novel. Felix is still in love with Lydia, and Lydia with Felix. But Lydia is now married to the Earl of Walden, Stephen and has a daughter named Charlotte. Stephen is negotiating a treaty with Olav to get Russia's help in WWI, and Lydia is torn between her love for her old flame and her current husband.<br /><br /> Several things stick out in the novel. First, Follett spends a lot of time on Felix, covering his life and his background. Felix is a despicable character and I kept hoping he would fail. Yet his actions drive the entire story.<br /><br /> Lydia was probably the most disappointing character. She loves Steven yet is willing to risk his life for the love of Felix who she last saw 19 years ago. She was a freak in her obsession for Felix. She is so weak-willed and it is frustrating because she had so many chances to do what was right.<br /><br /> Charlotte, their daughter, was raised in ignorance about everything. So when she turns 18 and begins to learn about sex and war and women's suffering, she starts to rebel against her parents because they kept so many things from her. Charlotte is not a bad person, but continually makes bad choices because of the way society thought she should be raised.<br /><br /> The rules of English society in 1914 meant no one could really say how the felt, and that caused many problems.<br /><br /> Lydia loved her husband Steven and Charlotte loved her father, yet they made so many choices that could harm him all because of lack of communication or out of fondness for Felix.<br /><br /> The end ties things up nicely, although a few things happen that I would deem &quot;unforgiveable&quot;, but since they are kept a secret, it doesn't really matter.<br /><br /> This Follett book had less sex that some of his others but retains the strong characterization that make him such a great author. Follett excels in writing period pieces that bring out the little details of what life was like in an earlier period.<br /><br /> I listened to this book on audio tape and highly recommend it.es because of the way society thought she should be raised.  <br />  <br /> The rules of English society in 1914 meant no one could really say how the felt, and that caused many problems.  <br />  <br /> Lydia loved her husband Steven and Charlotte loved her father, yet they made so many choices that could harm him all because of lack of communication or out of fondness for Felix. <br />  <br /> The end ties things up nicely, although a few things happen that I would deem &quot;unforgiveable&quot;, but since they are kept a secret, it doesn't really matter. <br />  <br /> This Follett book had less sex that some of his others but retains the strong characterization that make him such a great author.

B00006CXSS|5.0|It took me a couple episodes to get into the storyline, but to say that this is the best war drama ever made is to damn it with faint praise.  You follow the cast as they go from basic training all the way through D-Day and on to the liberation of Europe. Then, when you are fully engaged in the story, at the end you are introduced to the real guys who fought and suffered while fighting for their country and their fellow soldiers.  If you are even remotely interested in history or World War II, you can't go wrong by owning this.  If there is a finer example of genuine heroism, sacrifice and humility, I've not encountered it.
0451528018|5.0|The image of Sherlock Holmes in 'The Hound of the Baskervilles' is perhaps the most enduring image we have of him. You see, an Inverness cloak and deerstalker cap are inappropriate wardrobe for the town, and belong in the country. Sherlock Holmes is predominantly a city dweller and city investigator; it is relatively uncommon that he treks out on adventures, but the case of the mysterious death of Sir Charles Baskerville and the attempted murder of Sir Henry Baskerville led him to the Dartmoor plain. Thus, country garb was in order. This is where we get much of our imagery.<br /><br />Also helping with this is that every major actor to play Holmes has considered 'Hound of the Baskervilles' to be the ultimate Holmes story to act -- rather like the Hamlet of Conan Doyle's work. Holmes was a popular film icon, and in the early decades of the twentieth century several dozen films were made of Holmes, but the first after these many films to be set in Victorian times (and not be updated for the screen) was a version of Hound. Ellie Norwood, Basil Rathbone, Peter Cushing, Jeremy Brett -- many distinguished actors have considered this among their greatest roles.<br /><br />Watson dates the case to 1889, but various reading authorities, knowing the good doctor's occasional attempts to distort details to protect the privacy of the innocent, have dated this to between 1886 and 1900.<br /><br />In fact, the novel appeared in serialised form in the Strand magazine, the great first-publication site of most Holmesian tales, between August 1901 and April 1902, after Conan Doyle had attempted to kill off the great detective in the short story The Final Problem, which showcased Holmes' battle with Moriarity, the Napoleon of Crime. In fact, Conan Doyle came to dislike the character of Holmes because it was a distraction to his other pursuits.<br /><br />So, bowing to public pressure, Conan Doyle penned Hound of the Baskervilles to placate the public demand for more stories, but took care to place it before the death of Holmes, in the hopes that he could leave the detective safely dead (if not buried). Such was not to be, and we find a few years later that in fact Conan Doyle 'resurrects' Holmes in a rather ingenious fashion.<br /><br />But, on to the story at hand. Holmes and Watson, at home at 221b Baker Street, are approached by a Dr. James Mortimer regarding the death of Sir Charles Baskerville and a family curse which involved evil forces in the form of a satanic hound. Mortimer is concerned for the safety of the new proprietor of the family lands, freshly arriving from Canada, who had a new boot stolen, then an old boot stolen, in his hotel in London. Later Holmes would put together the significance of this seeming strange minor act (no, I won't tell you).<br /><br />Holmes sends Baskerville and Watson together to the country estate while he tends things in London on another case. In reality, Holmes is setting Watson up as a diversion, while he investigates the moor and the surroundings of the Baskerville estate under cover. Life at the estate is a bit strained, given the murder, an attempted murder, a curse, and all. The neighbours seem nice enough, though. Or are they? Watson picks up on curious little details of their relationship, which he reports back in written notes to Holmes (which have been redirected to his moor outpost).<br /><br />Eventually Holmes reveals himself to Watson, and then to Baskerville, and the chase is on in earnest, to discover the reality of the mysterious creature each have seen or heard. In good mystery fashion, we come across long lost relatives and an inheritance to be had; we find plots and subplots muddied by superstitious belief and fear, on a mysterious plain in southwestern England.<br /><br />All the elements combined that are now considered standard bits for a well-done country English mystery. But the mystery does not stop merely with the story. In true mystery fashion, appearing in the Daily Expressedition of March 16, 1959, there were doubts cast upon the authorship of Hound of the Baskervilles. The one who carried the dispute was named none other than Baskerville, Harry Baskerville. He credited the story to one Fletcher Robinson, who died (perhaps of the Egyptian mummy's curse) at age 35 shortly after the publication of Hound. With his death, only Baskerville remembered the issue of co-authorship. Baskerville claims it was Robinson who 'borrowed' the Baskerville name.<br /><br />One of Conan Doyle's heirs, Adrian Conan Doyle, heatedly denied involvement of Robinson past possible 'conversations' that might have taken place between Arthur Conan Doyle and Robinson. But, he did not deny Conan Doyle's possible 'inspiration' from Robinson.<br /><br />One Baker Street Irregular (an exclusive club of Holmesian experts) was doing a monograph on this issue as well, claiming that the reason why Holmes appears so infrequently is due to the fact that he had to be written in to an otherwise essentially completed story. This Irregular travelled to meet with Baskerville, and hinted at discoveries he had found. But alas, the Irregular died three weeks later in America, his monograph never published and his notes were never found. Perhaps a dog ate the homework?

B00003CX8V|3.0|I could have seen this film when it was a first run, but I didn't. It's amazing to me that it won the Oscar; it's an unusual film to be in that company. Yes, it was in black and white because Billy Wilder somehow preferred that -- see &quot;Some Like it Hot&quot;. Directors of German heritage STILL prefer black and white. I guess I was amazed at how much this film reminded me of &quot;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&quot; and even &quot;The Odd Couple.&quot; Jack plays a character that has some of that Felix Ungar hypochondriac flavor to him. Jack sorta specialized in playing characters that were somehow victims of the establishment.<br /><br /> Anyhow, for a first viewing 44 years after the fact it was enjoyable. The three main actors were all in their prime. But it really is for those who enjoy Billy Wilder's unique and personal approach to &quot;humor&quot;.<br /><br /> But &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; and &quot;West Side Story&quot; were the winners around this same time. In that company The Apartment seems out of place. I know this is a minority view....
0920668372|1.0|This book is a little creepy.  While I understand it's just supposed to be a metaphor, it's a creepy metaphor.  Sneaking into a teenager's room (or even a 9 yr old) and picking them up and rocking them!??  Then doing it to an adult?!  Funny in a way, but I find it creepy.  The beginning and end are fine, and even touching, but the middle bit--yikes!

B000089CKH|4.0|This is a great album. I won't deny that. But after four years they really strayed away from the sound of High Proximity. Which is one of the best albums ever. Its just such a great album with catchy tunes and deep meaningful lyrics. It seems like this time around nadasurf tuned it down a bit, still playing very intelligent with deep meaninful words. But not the balls to back it up with. High Proximity was near perfect, and this album seems a little worse. Not to say you shouldn't buy it, nadasurf is an excellent band and hi/lo although it shouldn't be ignored, shouldn't be your idea of what nadasurf should be. I suggest listening to high proximity first, then this cd, then maybe hi/lo. Because that is in which the band can display their qualities in a best to worst scenario. I love this band to death don't get me wrong, but I wish they would get back to their more experimental sound and melodolic sounds as opposed to these oppressed pop tunes that detour them from reaching their full heights as an artist.

B0001JXQEM|4.0|Don't like Rivers Cuomo (seriously the guy is a misanthrope with an Asian fetish) and not a big Weezer fan, but barring &quot;My Name is Jonas&quot;, &quot;Surf Wax America&quot;, and &quot;No One Else,&quot; the material on the original Blue album is relatively excellent. Very catchy songs that will stick in your head for days. The one disagreement I have with many other reviewers is that this is an upbeat peppy, album. Interviews with the Cuomo will reveal the same. I'd say about half of the songs here relay quite a bit of sadness, disillusionment, and heartbreak (which make them better than the throwaway lyrics on some other songs). This album is more sludge metal-pop than punk-pop (which I can't stand today). <br />  <br /> The additional material on this album- some of it is worthy like &quot;Suzanne&quot; and &quot;Jamie,&quot; but other tracks seem added just for curiousity factor. Check out the Deluxe edition of Slanted & Enchanted as a model for how additional material on reissues should be done.

After so much bad news out of Africa, and recently reading Theroux's &quot;Dark Star Safari&quot; I was also doubtful of finding anything cheerful. My pessimism was unfounded. This is a delight. Precious Ramostwe uses the money from the sale of the cattle her father left her to start a detective agency in Botswana. She solves a series of crimes but these are secondary to the atmosphere and characterization. I don't know how authentic the picture of life in Botswana is but what is depicted rings completely true. The prose is deceptively simple and unobtrusive. Every sentence is prefectly crafted with never a wasted word.
B000286RZM|5.0|I have been listening to Red Hot Chili Peppers since I was 9, and I never realized John's great talents till I was 14.  He is by far the best guitarist I have ever heard, he expresses his love and sensitivity towards his Chili peppers. And I love john's work, I feel like im part of him, and that I really relate to his behavior towards music, and his care and kindness towards fans. How I find him a role model, like he is my guardian angel and that he is always following me around, looking after me, protecting me. His work with the chili peppers is incredible, but his solo albums are even better. Will to death represents his feelings into music, and how he develops these works of art in such short time. All the songs are great, no doubt about it. Why its a perfect masterpiece, easy the cd incorporates all things you want, creative melodies, great guitar riffs, pure talent everything you need from a great album. Which is why I bought it, and many others have bought  it  because he is an amazing human being that I feel and many others feel has a gift that should of only been given to him and no other.

B0000AUHOH|3.0|As a continuing chapter in the Star Trek films,V bites the dust.I gave my friend a dubbed tape called THE WORST OF CLASSIC TREK(Saving the best for last&quot;SPOCK'S BRAIN).It was the most hilarious thing.It was bad enough with the basement DIY effects,but the plot made them very sub par. <br /> As for Star Trek V the plot was ridiculous,Nimbus III reminded me of those bad post-apocolyptic straight-to-video flicks,& poor De Kelley looked like he could've had a heart attack (though his presence is always a godsent in TREK). <br /> But if was intended or not.it has an Ed Wood-esque appeal,being humorous without even trying.The scene where Spock & Bones expierience their past pain is effective in bringing some sense of drama in this farce. <br /> In a world where one of the most popular Trek episodes is one of the worst (SPOCK'S BRAIN),V should be seen as one of the many bad chapters in a great tapestry of stories.attn Trekkers: the contents on the Worst of Classic Trek:The Alternative Factor/ Catspaw/ Patterns of Force/ And The Children Shall Lead/Plato's Stepchildren/Let That Be Your Last Battlefield/Whom Gods Destroy/The Way To Eden/The Savage Curtain/&last but not least Spock's Brain. <br />
B000001FMX|3.0|I have no idea why this band is called a punk band. The music sounds like your standard bar rock. I guess because they dressed in drag and were part of the whole '70's NY punk/drug/art scene with the Ramones and Lou Reed and such. I had read and heard a lot about this band so I decided to take a chance. Was really disappointed in the music. I don't know if it is the production or what. I dunno, maybe they were way better live. Sold it not soon after I bought it. This definitely wouldn't appeal to anyone under 30 and interested in punk.
6305127638|5.0|Of the four films featuring The Next Generation crew,ST:FC is the best ,even ranking among The Wrath Of Khan,The Voyage Home,and The Undiscovered Country.Unlike the other TNG films,this is not a two hour big budget TV episode,but a real movie that's fast paced,action packed and has agree of warmth and humor. <br /> Patrick Stewart is always a command presence as Capt.Picard(Kirk may be the best Captain,but Stewart is the best actor to sit in the chair),and his quest for vengence against the Borg is captivating as well as terrifying.And the rest of his crew(with the exception of Brent Spiner's Data)is not overlooked as they were in Generations. <br /> A great battle scene with the Borg(which includes DS9's Defiant)is followed by scenes alternating between 2063 earth and a war zone with the Borg on the new Enterprise-E.Sometimes the audience feels like they're watching two different movies,and the last scene with the Borg Queen seems like an all too convienient TV ending. <br /> Aside from these minor flaws ST:FC is a movie to be enjoyed by fans and non-fans alike. <br /> <br />
B00005K9LM|5.0|Face it, after this masterpiece of METAL it was all downhill: &quot;Turbo&quot; sees them incorporating glam, &quot;Ram it Down&quot; was simply directionless, and &quot;Painkiller&quot; sees them trying to appeal to thrash fans. Where did the true Judas Priest go? They were trying to be all things to all people and, true to form, ruined what appeared to be a great rebound after the &quot;Point of Entry&quot; debacle, just as &quot;Painkiller&quot; would later see them attempt to regain some intensity after the &quot;Turbo&quot; tragedy. <br /> With DEFENDERS, Priest raised the standards of metal composition, borderlining on what would today be called 'progressive metal' with their innovative use of classical chord progressions in a METAL format. Why they were never recognized as pioneers of classically-inspired metal is a travesty, because you can hear the influence all the way back on &quot;Sad Wings of Destiny&quot;. With DEFENDERS, though, it came to a dramatic head in the dense, musical drama of such songs as Freewheel Burning, The Sentinel, Jawbreaker, and even Rock Hard Ride Free. The (welcome) absence of any commercial-sounding songs really makes these compositions stand out as the quantum leap in METAL Riffery that they are. The lyrics may be occasionally juvenile, but the MUSIC is awe-inspiring.  <br /> Another high point in their career here was the guitar tone. It is simply the most monumental, gargantuan METALLIC sound to have ever been committed to tape, and it has remained unmatched to this day. NO ONE made a metal album this supremely heavy. It makes &quot;Screaming for Vengeance&quot;--which leans a little bit towards being radio friendly a little too often--sound like soft rock! <br /> No, DEFENDERS was not to be outdone, and none of their peers at the time even came close to matching this album's sheer mastery of Metal. And this was written and recorded at the tale end of 1983! Compared to what else was available at the time, DEFENDERS is a trulylandmark album. Give it a serious listen and it will be revealed to you.  <br />

B00000I3JO|5.0|It was actually just an accident that I found Blue Nile. I had bought a \\"Pure Mood\\" CD, and one of the songs on it was Blue Nile with \\"From a late night Train\\". When I came to the song, and it started, something inside me just became so relaxed, so peaceful and I found myself sitting in my comfy chair, that winter night, speechless. I had just heard my favorite song. Its not the song that needed several listenings. It was the song which just grabbed your heart and soul by the very core, and embraced it with music shaped for your ears.      I got hold of the album the very same night, and let me tell you this, I was totally transfixed. Lets dive in and study \\"Hats\\", Blue Nile`s best album.      \\"Over the Hillside\\". Listen to the beginning. From the moment it begins, you are immediately dragged into its soundscape. Its a comfortable, peaceful and relaxed atmosphere, and its a perfect introduction to Blue Nile`s world, where everything is, Blue. \\"Over the Hillside\\" is followed by my favorite on the album, \\"Downtown Lights\\". A bit more Upbeat, yet still a blue and moody song. The first Verse is the best part I`ve heard ever in a song. Its built up so wonderfully, the loneliness in his vocals, the haunting beat of the drum and the bass..Listen to that Synth. And the Trainlike rythm of the Drums. Incredible. Gets a bit tiresome all at the end, but it doesnt prevent it from being a superb and haunting song. Tuning things down abit is done with \\"Lets Go Out Tonight\\", a really moody and blue song. This is music with Soul. Somehow, Blue Nile manages to make such beautiful and peaceful music with so much variety and instruments. Bringing it back up a few notches is done with the optimistic and sweet \\"Headlights on the Parade\\", a really unique sounding piece that while being upbeat, doesnt stray from the relaxed atmosphere the cd brings. Next Star of the Show is the earlier mentioned \\"From a Late Night Train\\", and I dont think it needs any more explanations. A haunting piece built up by a lonely but relaxed Vocal, a backing synth and a Piano, all together for one of the most beautiful songs ever. \\"Seven A.M\\" is another good Song. Its blue and moody, another variant of \\"Headlights on the Parade\\", albeit a bit more hard to place. Its not as bright, its more somber, but still interesting due to the continous experimenting with sounds while keeping the good old soundscape. Coming up last, is the really sweet \\"Saturday Night\\". Its a combination between \\"Over the Hillside\\" and \\"Headlights on the Parade\\" but is a wonderful ending tune to such marvel of a Album.      The one thing that seperates \\"Hats\\" from the competition, is the soul and the sound. Once you have heard it, you can never, ever forget it. Most other music becomes simple when compared to the detailed yet comfortable style of Blue Nile. Wether you are in your comfy chair a winter`s night, or in the car or on a travel, or just want to feel good and relaxed, far away from real life, \\"Hats\\" By Blue Nile is the best album ever.
B000083C49|5.0|Like The Trouble With Tribbles,IV may not be the best(II tops them all),but it's certainly many fans favorite.<br /><br />  What makes this film work is its humor as well as its warmth and heart.The cast look like they're having so much fun filming it, that it rubs off on the audience.Equally funny is seeing our beloved crew of the USS Enterprise,looking awkward and out of place in the 20th century.<br /><br /> The movie is also fast paced as many obsticles(the Klingon Crystal depletion,the search for the whales in the ocean as well as the hospital scenes)pile up upon one another yet successfully resolving themselves.Subsequent film that try to replicate IV's formula end up looking clumsy(V and Insurrection)because they miss the point that behind great comedy is heart.
B000001DTM|5.0|This just proves that no matter what they do, U2 can't seem to fail! After the straight-laced rock of The Joshua Tree and Rattle And Hum, Achtung Baby is a complete shock. It was the first U2 cd I bought after All That You Can't Leave Behind and I hated it at the start. But after a few listens, it quickly jumped to the top of my list. Every song on it is brilliantly crafted, from Bono's lyrics to Eno and Lanois's producing. The Edge's guitar playing is amazing throughout the whole cd, though I would say his best parts are on 'The Fly' and 'Love Is Blindness'. Both are very unique, just like Edge!
B0000UJL96|5.0|A fitting swan song to the original series crew,which bridges many event that shows up on subsequent series(The Khitomer Accords,Klingon Honor,etc).The film gives our aged but beloved heroes a send-off that couldn't even be cheapened by Generations token TOS apperance. <br /> Its mix of action,suspense,and even mystery makes this a very entertaining film.The return to the directors chair of Nick Meyers is a godsend(attn Rick Berman,Hire Mr Meyers for Star Trek X).As Capt. Sulu of the Excelsior fittenly puts it,&quot;Nice to see you in action,one more time.&quot; <br />
B000286S8S|1.0|The other critiques of the flaws in BOBW are accurate. For Warner Bros to release this CD in this way is inexcusable and an embarassment. For those who did buy it, my suggestion is to do what I did. Make a copy of the receipt and mail it certified to: <br /> <br />Warner Bros. Records Inc. <br />Attn: Quality Assurance Dept. <br />3300 Warner Blvd. <br />Burbank, Ca 91505 <br /> <br />Flood them with your bad discs and let them know they can't do this to consumers! <br />
B00005JKHP|3.0|Being a fan of Star Trek,I've seen TMP when it was first released.The thrill to see my heroes Kirk,Spock,& Bones was a joy in itself.Nearly 25 years later,repeated viewing,eight more movies and the newer shows,I started to realise what a bore this film is. <br /> The filmmakers wanted to compete with Star Wars in terms of special effects & budget.And like all effects laden films, the script gets diluted.The whole V'ger revalation may've looked good on paper,but we have to go through a long drawn out build up that makes you feel it should've been a  90 minute movie,let alone a TV episode.Star Trek has always been about the story &the characters.The chemestry between the crew, a little rusty since its been a decade since they've acted together,is always a saving grace. <br /> Star Trek from the get-go has always worked on a low budget  from the Classic series on down. TMP should've been an example to the Berman-era movies(especially Insurrection),big budget never equals better movies. <br /> <br />
B00005JLKB|2.0|I have been a Superman/Superboy fan since I was very young. I have mostly appreciated the films and animated series featuring the Man of Steel. When I became aware of the Smallville series on DVD I decided to give it a try. It started out very nicely. With regard to origins of Superman, I am more of a purist but found the treatment in Smallville acceptable and very entertaining. The first 4 episodes were very good. However, once the series settled into featuring a &quot;weekly bad guy&quot; I lost interest. Every episode spent more time on some kryptonite influenced aberration that challenged young Clark. I found the weekly bad guys to be wholly unbelievable and far too dominant in the story line - they overshadowed Clark's evolutionary awareness of his powers etc. The episode with the heat asborbing teenager pushed me over the edge of acceptability. <br /> So, for all you Superman fans, this series falls short of what it could and should be. Too bad, I was looking forward to enjoying it.
6302484391|4.0|Three gold diggers, Lauren Bacall, Marilyn Monroe and Betty Grable, rent an apartment in Manhattan in order to catch wealthy husbands; and the rest, as they say, is herstory. We can only hope that these women got big bucks for starring in this mindless comedy. Monroe and Grable in much of the movie appear to be in a contest to see who can do or say the dumbest things. Ms. Bacall has a modicum of intelligence although she's no candidate for membership in Mensa International. On the other hand, if you accomplish what you are seeking, or some variation thereof, who's to say that you're dumb after all.<br /><br /> There are some funny moments in this bit of fluff. Ms. Grable mistakes a trumpet player she hears on the radio for Harry James. (For those of you whose first live president you remember was Ronald Reagan, Ms. Grable was married to Mr. James for many years.) Also, Me. Bacall makes a quip about the &quot;old&quot; man who starred in &quot;The African Queen&quot;; i.e., Humphrey Bogart. And Ms. Monroe, too vain to wear eyeglasses, just keeps running into walls.<br /><br /> Did women really dress this way in the 50's? I believe they did. You will laugh out loud at the costumes, from the one-piece swimsuits--the Miss America pageant has nothing on these gals-- to the dyed to match outfits to the skirts so full that they could serve as flotation devices should these women get into deep water. In the end, they all walk on dry land.
B000002J1L|4.0|Led Zeppelin, The Who and Black Sabbath were at the top of their prime and another little known band from England was starting to make a name for themselves. A band to be known for the theatrical performances by their lead man, Peter Gabriel. 'Nursery Cryme' was to become the first album by the lineup that made Genesis famous: Gabriel on vocals, Phil Collins on drums (and backing vocals), Tony Banks on keys, Steve Hackett on guitars, and Mike Rutherford on bass and guitars.<br /><br /> Although it is not the band's best album, it has a handful of some of the best music they ever made. &quot;The Musical Box&quot;, one of the band's standards, evokes feelings of victorian nostalgia, in line with the cover of the album, combined with a nightmarish and lunatic discharge that is perfectly framed by the latter part of the song. Viewing this song in a live setting is an experience that can be very hard to compare with anything you run into these days, as Gabriel strolls through the stage wearing the costume of an old man shaking and rattling as the song reaches its climax.<br /><br /> Second to &quot;The Musical Box&quot; is the closing track, &quot;The Fountain of Salmacis&quot;, which opened Gabriel up to a stream of mythology-driven writing that would ensue until deep into 'The Lamb Lies Down...' his last album with the band.<br /><br /> Overall, 'Nursery Cryme' deserves four stars due to these two songs (the album sports only seven tracks) and the interesting tale of &quot;The Return of the Giant Hogweed&quot;, but it lags behind the albums that would follow it until the departure of Gabriel. If you want to get into serious Genesis music, although this album will end up been a must in your collection, you need to jump first into 'The Lamb...', 'Selling England by The Pound' and 'Foxtrot', in that order.
B000002N2N|5.0|First of all, ******. There. The damned box upstairs didn't have enough stars to fully make people aware of how great the Ramones really are. This, without a doubt is their best live and possibly best overall album. Some songs never get old. Dee Dee's &quot;one-two-three-four!!&quot; also never get's old. Sheena is a Punk Rocker (if you don't know this song you should give yourself a huge kick in the arse)sounds better than ever and Da Bruddas are just frigging amazing. Go buy this album. And if anyone says otherwise about the Ramones, give THEM a good kick. Rock on.
1402581386|5.0|Lindsay does a fantastic job of turning the tired serial killer genre on its head.  His creation of Dexter, a serial killer who only kills bad people, is near perfect.  I enjoyed Dexter's dark humor and sardonic wit; a few times I found myself laughing out loud.  Add the southern Miami locale and you have the perfect summer read.  I can't wait for the next Dexter adventure!
B00002Z88D|5.0|Although this album will not go down in history as the best of all time, never has an album blown me away quite as much. Part of why many people do not like it quite as much as I do is that they had heard songs like &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; the original way for 15 years. But as a young teen I had not had great exposure to Metallica before. S&M was the first Metallica album I ever bought based on the strength of the single &quot;No Leaf Clover&quot; which may be the best metallica song of the last 10 years. This album introduced me to many metallica classics that hardcore fans had been listening to for almost 20 years. So for them, to hear the orchestra was probably quite a change from what they were used to hearing. Many of the songs off load which are not all that great by themselves are improved greatly with the orchestra. &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; and &quot;Call of Ktulu&quot; are also incredible with the live orchestra. As I listened to S&M for the first time on christmas of 2001, I was so blown away that I told my cousins to leave me alone and I listened to that thing for 6 hours straight. I just couldn't believe the quality of music I was hearing!! Before this I had not been a big metal fan but ever since, metal has become my favorite style of music. Michael Kamen (Rest in piece man, for you really are amazing) was also a musical genius to compose such powerful accompaniment to take these metallica songs to a new level. Lars's drums sound perfect on this record unlike the tincan sound they have on St. Anger and the live energy only adds to this album's brilliance. This record is certainly not the most influential metallica album, but in my opinion it is the best and definitely the most underrated in their collection. For those who truely have musical taste, this album is a masterpiece unlike any other.
B00005JLEU|5.0|The title is fitting: I was spirited away by this masterpiece.  I have never before seen a cartoon that swept me up in emotions and visuals so effortlessly.  Even the classic Disney movies are cheesy, immature, and incomplete in some parts.  This movie has a few flaws too, such as the rather unnecessarily gross and vicious scenes with No-Face, and while I understand the purpose for this, it's just not fitting with the rest of the movie.  My favorite parts are the following dreamy sequences: the meadow scene at the beginning, the furnace scene with the little soot balls, the rainy day when the stink spirit arrives, and far and away my favorite animated scene of all time: the train on the water.  These images will probably stick with me forever, they fulfill childhood fantasies I never knew I had, and utterly relax me. <br /> <br />Enough rambling, this is the one to get, from the legendary Japanese director Miyazaki.  While other works of his are great, they just can't compare to Spirited Away.  As the head of Pixar states at the beginning: You are lucky, you get to see Spirited Away.  If you haven't seen it yet, do so, now, I mean it.
B000286S8S|5.0|All the reviews primarily hit on the fact that &quot;Best Of Both Worlds&quot; is not in a consistent order, that there were tracks left off and there were digital mistakes in the recordings. First off I have to say it is so great to have Van Halen back together and recording music again. I bought this album for the sole purpose of the new tracks, plus the remastered songs. I have an idea for all the negative complainers out there, if you have a cd burner (which this day and time who doesn't)and all the original albums (which all the real Van Halen fans do), take all the tracks off this new album burn them to mp3, there you will have remastered versions of the songs, take &quot;Finish What You Started&quot; from the original album, and replace the unabruptly cut off version on the &quot;Best Of Both Worlds&quot;, and add any other cuts you think should have been on there, this is what I did and I ended up with 51 songs on my new &quot;Best Of Both Worlds&quot; compilation, granted not all the songs will be digital recordings as is on &quot;BOBW&quot;, but they will sound great none the less. Enjoy the new VH music for what it is, not what it should be. Enjoy. <br />  <br /> David Walls <br /> Houston
B00023B1LC|5.0|I had serious doubts before seeing this movie. I just didn't think Matt Damon could pull off a good action hero role.<br />BOY WAS I WRONG.<br />Damon's performance is one of the best &quot;action hero&quot; roles since Bruce Willis in Die Hard. The plot is nothing new, probably because it's been copied from the original Bourne books so many times before that it's already predictable once it gets to the big screen. It's forgivable though, as the action sequences are tight and frantic, with decent enough acting and dialogue in between to make it more than &quot;just&quot; an action movie.
B000001EMW|3.0|When I read about the 4 Finnish guys who went to the studio to record Metallica songs with their cellos, I decided that I need to have this CD. So, when it finally came out in 1996, I was among the first to buy it. Immediately I was very impressed. Later on, I changed my mind somewhat. So, here's the good and the bad of this Apocalyptica debut. <br />  <br /> Let's begin with the good. Obviously, these 4 men are highly proficient with their instruments. Everything is performed with technical perfection and sounds flawless. I'm amazed at how they play Kirk Hammet's solos on the cello. <br /> People of Apocalyptica are excellent arrangers. I couldn't believe my ears how accurately they reproduce Metallica's tight rhythm patterns with absolutely no drums involved. I never thought it was possible until I heard this. All in all, they prove that a cello is a pretty fine heavy metal instrument! <br />  <br /> Let's move on to the bad. The worst part of the album is that it offers no variety at all. Take any single track - it's a mindblowing masterpiece. Now stick 8 tracks together, and it becomes an excercise in patience. I think it happens because the original material is very specific. Classic Metallica was never known as a melodic band. And to make matters worse, James Hetfield has a very limited voice, and his vocal melodies are primitive at best. He takes his own with unmistakable menacing intonations, and with powerful lyrics with a message. However, when taken to the cello, vocal intonations and lyrical meaning is lost, and all that is left is mostly pointless wandering of a lead cello across the same 3 notes over and over and over again. Yes, it's the 100% accurate reproduction of the original material. But let's be honest, it doesn't work quite like it was supposed to. This shortcoming of the original idea ruins all the tracks that originally were vocals-heavy, like &quot;Creeping Death&quot;. At the same time, one of Metallica's strongest composing efforts, &quot;Welcome Home (Sanitarium)&quot; sounds perfectly when played on cellos, because the original material is melodically strong. This track is hands down the best of the album, and ultimately, the only track here that any metal fan MUST hear. <br />  <br /> Obviously, my point was realized by the Apocalyptica themselves, and we see a dramatic improvement on their subsequent records, where they added more and more of their own material.
1592400876|5.0|I am having a very hard time convincing my friends and colleagues that this book is worth reading; however, it truly is a fabulous book. Although I am not as obsessed with punctuation as Ms. Truss, I do appreciate her wonderful sense of humor and her belief that written English should, and certainly can be, expressed in a way that it makes sense to any reader. <br /> <br />This book has the potential to be very valuable to people in all areas of life. I highly recommend Eats Shoots & Leaves.
0553269631|5.0|I remember finding this book when I was about 12 on my mom's bookshelf, and stealing it (this strategy also yielded &quot;The Godfather,&quot; which taught me more about sex than any health class, and Mary Renoult's books &quot;The Bull from the Sea&quot; and &quot;The Persian Boy&quot;, among many others.) It was a strange little book that took a 12 year old a couple of attempts to penetrate. <br />  <br /> When I finally &quot;got it,&quot; I read and reread it many times. <br />  <br /> Her writing style is odd, and for we Americans who are fed a daily diet of characters who are winners, the misfits that populate thist story consist mostly of those quirky, awkward parts of our adolescence that we'd rather forget. <br />  <br /> But as you dig deeper into the story, McCuller's bittersweet Southern Gothic tale resonates with the force of a well-played, highly amplified bass guitar. The utterly unforgiving look at the suffering and transcendent overcoming of life's tragedies sweeps you away with its stark beauty. <br />  <br /> Comparisons with Harper Lee's &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; are unavoidable, and widely miss the mark. While both are stories of misfits in the American South of the 20s/30s/40s, &quot;The Heart is a Lonely Hunter&quot; pulls no punches as it looks into the despair and strength of people hanging on, on the edge of society, who look both beauty and heartache in the eye and flinch from neither. <br />  <br /> Aside from McCullers' own &quot;Ballad of the Sad Cafe,&quot; Annie Proulx is her spiritual and literary heir, particulary in &quot;The Shipping News&quot; and even more directly in &quot;Close Range: Wyoming Stories.&quot; If you loved &quot;Close Range,&quot; you'll also get &quot;The Heart is a Lonely Hunter,&quot; and vice versa. <br />  <br /> Highly recommended.
B0000CFW87|4.0|As a professional instrumentalist/vocalist I tend to only buy CDs that I find useful in studying a particular musical style or for gathering new material. In Josh's case I purchased his CD for pure pleasure and got more than I expected. I had read the reviews saying the CD was over-produced, but did not come away with that feeling. The mixture of languages kept the CD fresh and at one point I actually got chills thinking not so much of the awesome color of Josh's voice now, but how it will age like a fine wine in years to come. The future will be exciting as we hear his voice mature with every new release.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Are there any music critics that DON'T worship the ground Radiohead walks on? I'm thoroughly convinced that they could release an album of Thom Yorke banging on a bongo drum for 75 minutes, and still get heaps of praise unloaded on them.  <br />  <br /> But there's a reason why Radiohead are the critics' darlings. Quite simply, they're an extraordinaly talented band. &quot;The Bends&quot; is an intelligent, brit-pop masterpiece. &quot;OK Computer&quot; is the best album of the 90's. &quot;Kid A&quot; and &quot;Amnesiac&quot; saw them tear down their entire musical foundation (which had become too bloated on &quot;OK Computer&quot; to even attempt to upstage), and start fresh with a new, electronica-heavy direction. So where does &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; fit into the equation? Well, it's a little bit of everything actually. Other than a couple of tracks, nothing really covers any new ground, but what it does, it does perfectly. As suggested by the title, the album has a political bend to it. The lyrics (which I feel are Thom's best so far) are very paranoid, sarcastic, and angry at times; a perfect snapshot of the post 9/11 world. <br />  <br /> 1. 2+2=5 <br />  <br /> A rock epic condensed into 3 minutes. Begins with a brooding, mid-tempo guitar rhythm in a jerky 7/8 time signature, backed by Thom Yorke's &quot;1984&quot; inspired lyrics. Then, it explodes into a hostile, punky, feedback-laden, showstopping finale. Just as you want more, it comes to an abrupt end. A powerful, incredible opener. <br />  <br /> 2. Sit Down, Stand Up <br />  <br /> An eerie, piano led first half builds up into an intense, electronica finale in which the listener is showered with blips, bleeps, and digital beats as Thom repeatedly sings &quot;The raindrops, the raindrops..&quot; <br />  <br /> 3. Sail to the Moon <br />  <br /> A lush, dreamy, reflective piano elegy slightly reminscent of &quot;Pyramid Song&quot;, but not as haunting. The bridge will send chills down your spine. The time signature changes are an artform in itself, going from 7/4 to 2/4 to 4/4 to 6/4 to 2/4 to 4/4 to 5/4, and so forth.  <br />  <br /> 4. Backdrifts <br />  <br /> This has one of the more conventional song structures on the album, but it's soaked in an electronic backdrop, making it one of the more difficult songs to get into. One of my favorites. <br />  <br /> 5. Go To Sleep <br />  <br /> A guitar driven song that harkens back to their mid-90's era. Still lacks a traditional verse/chorus/verse structure, which is probably why it bombed as a radio single. The latter half of the song has some really cool guitar work, and makes me want to get up and dance.  <br />  <br /> 6. Where I End And You Begin <br />  <br /> The epitome of &quot;haunting&quot;. A bass heavy, nihilistic dance beat serves as the backdrop for some of Thom's most poignant lyrics. The outro, in which he sings, &quot;I Will Eat You Alive..&quot;, is another 'chills-down-spine' inducing moment. <br />  <br /> 7. We Suck Young Blood <br />  <br /> And this would be the epitome of &quot;creepy&quot;. A bleak, minor key piano melody accompanied by Thom's sarcastic vocals and, of all things, handclaps, which add immensely to the song's creepy feeling. Sounds like a funeral dirge.  <br />  <br /> 8. The Gloaming <br />  <br /> The album's brooding [quasi] title track, built upon minimalistic electronica loops. Harkens back to the &quot;Kid A&quot; and &quot;Amnesiac&quot; days.  <br />  <br /> 9. There There <br />  <br /> An absolute masterpiece. Utilizes all of its five and a half minutes to keep building up - bass lines, layers of guitars, tribal like drumming, Thom's soaring vocals. It eventually reaches its climax and blasts off into a hypnotic, ethereal soundscape. Worth $15 alone. <br />  <br /> 10. I Will <br />  <br /> At a mere 2 minutes, the shortest song on the album. With its stark guitar melody, the song relies mainly on Thom's gorgeous, multi-layered vocal harmonies. Beautiful. <br /><br /> 11. A Punch-Up at a Wedding <br />  <br /> Mixes thick, funky bass lines with a jazzy piano track to create an entirely new sound for the band; call it Jazzelectronifunk..err, maybe not. I love this song, but a lot of people seem to hate it with a passion.  <br />  <br /> 12. Myxomatosis <br />  <br /> A brutal onslaught of heavily amplified, fuzzed out bass that'll rape your subwoofer. It'll seem totally unlistenable at first, but it grows on you.  <br />  <br /> 13. Scatterbrain <br />  <br /> Probably the least memorable song on the album for me. But it's still good, don't get me wrong. Mid-tempo, wistful..most comparable to something like &quot;Let Down&quot;, but not even close to being in the same league (to even compare them is almost blasphemy!) <br />  <br /> 14. A Wolf at the Door <br />  <br /> Radiohead always ends their albums on an excellent song. This pile of crap is an exception. Just KIDDING - this is another amazing closer..every aspect of it. The arcane organ intro. The verses, in which Thom rattles off bitter, angry lyrics in an almost spoken word/rap delivery (Don't take that *too* literally though, this is not Thom Yorke rapping). Then, the sweeping, soaring, instantly memorable chorus. The guitar melodies in the chorus are especially beautiful. Clocking in at just over 3 minutes, it's rather brief, but breathtaking while it lasts. In that sense, it serves as the perfect dreamy counterpart to the raw, intense &quot;2+2=5&quot;. Both songs are lyrically similar though, as they contemplate our modern world with anger and uncertainty.  <br />  <br /> I've probably said more than enough by this point. So I'll close by saying that &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; is, unsurprisingly, yet another masterpiece from Radiohead. After about 4 or 5 listens, I think you'll agree.  <br />  <br /> Best Songs: There There, Backdrifts, A Wolf at the Door, I Will, Where I End And You Begin, A Punch-Up at a Wedding
0800187881|5.0|I liked this movie, and every so often my wife and just hold hands and watch it. I'm not proud of getting tears in my eyes, but this always touches me.  It's a wonderful love story.
B00023B1AS|2.0|As much as I love ZZ Top, and that love is great, <br />I can't recommend this DVD because all it has are <br />the videos.  Whoever produced this DVD should take <br />a lesson from, say, the Chemical Brothers DVD, which <br />shines because it contains a killer LIVE section. <br />What's the use of a ZZ Top DVD that only has the videos? <br />One's reaction to this tends to be: who cares? <br />However, IF this DVD had contained a LIVE offering, <br />then I'm sure it would've been among my favorite DVDs of all time. <br />Hopefully in the near future ZZ Top will release a fantastic <br />LIVE DVD.............please!
B00028HBKM|4.0|I have listened to, and also read many people's reaction to Mel's &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot;, and have found many of them very interesting. Most people either love it or hate it. Those who love it say it &quot;opened their eyes to Christ's suffering&quot; and those who hated it say it was a &quot;torcherfest.&quot; I think one thing people fail to realize is that this movie is based for the most part on fact. This is the reality of what Jesus truly went through for the sin of the world, and thoses who think that Mel went overboard on the &quot;torcher&quot; scences should know that the Bible says that Jesus wasn't even recognizable as a man due to the severity of his beating and his beard was plucked from his face. After seeing the movie I realized that most people, including myself, couldn't handle a small glimps of what Jesus truly went through. I think everyone should see this movie at least once just to get an idea of the cost that Christ paid. Any anyone who thinks this movie is or might be anti-sematic should know that Jesus was a Jew who said &quot;I lay down My life that I may take it again.&quot; The Jews didn't kill Jesus, Jesus laid down his life for us. If anyone put Jesus to death on the cross, we all did.
B000286S8S|3.0|While &quot;Best Of Both Worlds&quot; easily supplants the original Greatest Hits from 1997, it is also a very poorly executed deal. There are several reasons for this, but I'll simply hit the most obvious ones. We'll start with the package itself.<br /><br /> Is Eddie's ego still smarting so much that the David Lee Roth era rates NO photographs? There are only two pics here, and they're of the current Van Hagar line-up. That also includes the discography, where the admittedly bad &quot;Van Halen 3&quot; has not so mysteriously disappeared from the chronology. There's no commentary save for David Wild's fawning mini-essay, while a few comments on how some of the songs came about might have made this a more interesting set. A plus note is the textured cover that mimics Eddie's guitar. But checking out recent packages from Peter Gabriel, REM and The Eagles will show you not just what might have, but what really should have been.<br /><br /> But what you're really here for is the music. And let's face the reality, Eddie rewrote the rock guitarist handbook, so I'm not about to argue the merits of which songs are or are not here. Save &quot;Me Wise Magic,&quot; I really don't feel any major omissions took place. What I do find frustrating is the programming.<br /><br /> Even a casual fan of Van Halen knows that this band splits into two distinct halves, the more flamboyant early David Lee Roth period and the following arena roar of the Van Hagar era. While both halves of Halen provided us with some all time classics (I actually think &quot;Right Now&quot; is VH's best ever), it would have made for a much more satisfying package had the disc one and disc two layout followed the chronology of the band instead of the Roth Vs Hagar stack-the-tracks programming offered here. I'll also add that breaking &quot;Eruption&quot; apart from &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; is akin to separating &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; from &quot;We Are The Champions.&quot; It just ain't right.<br /><br /> On to the &quot;new&quot; tracks. Ugh. OK, Sammy may be approaching social security, so hearing such puerile wrote-it-in-five minutes swill like &quot;Up For Breakfast&quot; makes me almost want to lose my lunch before dinner. &quot;Learning To See&quot; is an improvement, and frankly &quot;It's About Time&quot; is the only piece that sounds like it may last longer than the time that will pass before an inevitable box set. That may actually what it takes to get everyone adequately (and I mean Fans and Band alike) covered by a true Van Halen anthology.ight. <br />  <br /> On to the &quot;new&quot; tracks. Ugh.

B000286S8S|4.0|Alright, it's been about 9 years since Van Halen came out with <br />Best Of Vol 1.... I actually did not buy that collection, and <br />so I don't feel completely cheated in buying this collection. <br /> <br />However, there are some tunes that are missing here... Yes,  <br />I think some songs are debateable for being on this album.. But <br />I can;t for the life of me see how you leave classics like Ice <br />Cream Man, Mean Streets, and lastly Humans Being. You are missing <br />two of VH's top ten songs and possibly Sammy's best with the <br />band. <br /> <br />Not excuseable... Perhaps they don't think Humans Being is a <br />classic considering when it came out and such.. But that does <br />not make alot of sense. <br /> <br />There are some others that I think should make it, such as Little <br />Dreamer.. I'm not too hard on them for that because it's just <br />a personal favorite. I mean, it a Van Halen song that sounds  <br />from the 70's, and not the 80's. Also, there is Atomic Punk, <br />and the Me Wise Magic from the 'Best Of\\" disk. Another missing <br />tune is Where Have The Good Times Gone... <br /> <br />A bigger problem is the live cuts. It's pointless to have <br />them on this album when the songs above can replace them. <br />Heck, you could throw the Who cover on there... It's actually <br />a top 4 Van Hagar song IMO. <br /> <br />The cutting of Finish What Ya Started sounds bad... And where  <br />is The Intruder for Pretty Woman??? I actually like that song <br />and it doesn't sound nearly as good without The Intruder. <br /> <br />One last thing... The New Songs should've been near the end <br />of the second disk.. They're ok, but they are out classed <br />by everything else on the disk.... Including the pop ballads. <br /> <br />3 1/2 stars.
B000286S8S|1.0|How many greatest hits packages are we going to get? Many of the same songs that were on &quot;Best of Vol 1&quot; are on this one too. The DLR era is far better than the SH era, but I'd like to hear some more new music instead of a new assortment of old songs. <br /> As far as the new tunes in this edition, yawn...nothing new after all this time off. C'mon, release some of that energy Ed! Sammy's lyrics are witless and boring per:usual... &quot;Sammy, ever heard of subtle sexual inuendo?&quot;  <br /> At least when Dave was in the band they were fun, now they seem to take themselves way too seriously. Get over yourselves and create something inovative or at least interesting...Please... With the state of hard rock music right now, the time is right for a classic band to make some impact, if they would just go into the studio, relax and have some fun.

Good for them! <br /> <br />As for this album? Its stupid! Dont buy this crap. Its just not worth it, better watch her shows full of visuals, atleast you delight your eyes with her screaming stunts. :-)
0312305060|5.0|This is one of those books that I just couldn't put down, wanting to take in just one more chapter, one more page, one more exquisite sentence.   <br /> <br />Cunningham tells the story of a day in the life of three women - Virginia Woolf in the 1920s, housewife Laura Brown in the 1950s and professional Clarissa Vaughan (nicknamed Mrs. Dalloway) in the modern era.  Each woman's day is extraordinary in its own way.  What is most remarkable is how the three women and their lives intertwine, both in the details and in the book.   <br /> <br />This book is an example of amazingly well done structure, beautiful imagery, and a remarkable tale of ordinary life and what makes people continue on through the hours.  Highly recommended.

038551123X|5.0|Dexter Morgan is a blood-spatter analyst for the Miami police department. He is good looking, has a great sense of humor and he?s a serial killer. <br />  <br /> Dexter is a killer with a heart?he only kills bad people. Dexter picks off the dregs of society; child molesters, rapists and murderers. But, Dex?s well-planed life is thrown off course when a series of murders plague the city and the style of killing is very close to his own. <br />  <br /> Dexter becomes fascinated with the new killings and decides to help his step-sister Deb, who happens to be a Miami cop investigating the murders, catch the killer. As the killings progress Dexter realizes the killer isn?t just copying his style of killing, he?s taunting him to &quot;come out and play.&quot; <br />  <br /> ?Darkly Dreaming Dexter? is the most original and gripping thriller to come out in years. While Dexter himself is a monster, the reader can?t help but to cheer him on and hope he comes out on top. The plot moves along at a brisk pace, but it?s Dexter?s narrative that keeps the pages turning. This off beat novel had me in it?s spell from first page to last and I didn?t put it down until I finished it in one sitting. Readers looking for a fresh, witty and shocking novel should look no further. <br />  <br /> A definite MUST read! <br />  <br /> Nick Gonnella <br />  <br />
B00004R99J|4.0|Don't watch Pocahontas if you're expecting a historical lesson. As usual, Disney takes liberty with its adopted tale of the young Powhatan girl who saved the life of an English settler. In true history she was only twelve years old; in Disney's romanticized version, she is a beautiful woman who falls in love with the handsome, dashing John Smith. Historically inaccurate? Yes. A beautiful, highly enjoyable film? Absolutely. <br />  <br /> The film opens with a group of English settlers crossing the Atlantic to colonize Virginia, led by the greedy Governor Ratcliffe and the adventurous John Smith. We are later introduced to Pocahontas, a beautiful and bright young woman on the brink of adulthood, searching for her place in the world. A star-crossed meeting with John Smith forges a friendship between the two that will later blossom into romance. They explore one another's culture; Pocahontas introduces Smith to her love of nature in the film's most beautiful and breathtaking song, &quot;Colors of the Wind.&quot; But Ratcliffe thinks Pocahontas' tribe is hiding mounds of gold and is determined to strip them of their riches, while the Chief Powhatan, Pocahontas' father, regards the white settlers as dangerous, invading demons.  <br />  <br /> Though Disney has its typical boo-hiss villain in Ratcliffe, the film's conflict is not black and white; neither the Native Americans nor the white settlers are portrayed as evil. Instead, both are carefully crafted with their own hopes and dreams, as well as natural prejudices toward the opposing, unknown culture. The film's message of understanding and racial tolerance is a bit heavy-handed but otherwise inspiring, as is Pocahontas' love and respect for nature, beautifully expressed in the awe-inspiring, Oscar-winning song &quot;Colors of the Wind.&quot; Pocahontas has bust but also brains, and the compassion and courage to make a stand for peace between her people and the settlers. <br />  <br /> Having always been a romantic, the high point of the film for me is also the most historically inaccurate--the love story between Pocahontas and John Smith. What starts as simple curiosity in one another blossoms into love, culminating in the film's single but very sensual kiss. Though my opinion is not widely shared, I think this film is one of Disney's best in the romance department. <br />  <br /> The obligatory cute-n-fuzzy animals, a mischievious raccoon, pesky hummingbird, and spoiled pug, provide some mild amusement, but I personally think the film could have done without them. The music is good but not spectacular, the exception of course being &quot;Colors of the Wind&quot;. The animation is rendered in soft, dreamy pastels of mainly green, blue, and gray; while not as beautiful as some of its predecessors, such as Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King, it's a lovely effort. <br />  <br /> A beautiful, compassionate film, Pocahontas is a worthy Disney feature and, in my humble opinion, deserving of the title &quot;masterpiece.&quot;
B00008V5VN|3.0|Before Matt Pike formed the excellent doom metal outfit High On Fire, he took part in one of the most uncompromising stoner jams of all time with the band Sleep. I'm not particularly interested in Sleep's other works--the general consensus is that they are little more than Black Sabbath tribute records, but Dopesmoker/Jerusalem is pretty unique. The differences between Dopesmoker and Jerusalem: Dopesmoker is longer by about 10 minutes, has better production, cooler cover artwork (in my opinion anyway), and is not arbitrarily sliced up into parts like Jerusalem. Jerusalem was edited by their record label--the band hated it, but it does make this jam a bit more accessible (and you can skip ahead to the parts you like if it gets boring). Also Dopesmoker contains an additional 10-minute track labeled Sonic Titan, recorded live.<br /><br /> Anyway, back to the title track: It is an hour-plus long jam; the motif is established early on, and most of Dopesmoker is a series of variations on that main riff. It is monotonous, droning, SLLLLOOOOWWWWW, and oh yeah, heavier than a herd of pachyderms. This album will seriously test the limits of your sound system if you're going to play it at the appropriate volume (which of course is loud enough to be mistaken for low-flying 747's). The bass alone will exact a pounding on your chest cavity.<br /><br /> Musically, it is good despite the monotony. Pike's solos are excellent, as usual, and Chris Haikus beats the skins capably. Cisnero's vocals are sparse but perfect in conveying that hazy atmosphere, and the lyrics are about Christ and pot (&quot;green herbsmen serve rightful king&quot;...duuude). Definitely different from your average metal.<br /><br /> Needless to say, something like this has very limited appeal and is kind of tough to rate. Even some fans of the genre are going to find Dopesmoker a boring experience without, um, certain controlled substances. I for one think Dopesmoker is pretty good. It's very trance-inducing and atmospheric &quot;ambient metal&quot; that is well off the beaten path. I can't see that many people listening to an album like this all the time, but it should be experienced at least once. If you like the sound but prefer more abbreviated song structures, pick up High On Fire's Surrounded By Thieves.-inducing and atmospheric &quot;ambient metal&quot; that is well off the beaten path. I can't see that many people listening to an album like this all the time, but it should be experienced at least once.

B000092ZYX|5.0|I first came to Radiohead when the pyramid song pierced through my thoughts as its video played on the big screen in downtown Columbus, OH. The first album I purchased was Amnesiac. Upon first listen, it did not speak to me. As I listened, it started to make sense. So, I went and got Kid A...  <br />  <br /> Without boring you of details, when I had Kid A and Amnesiac, I began to see a thread forming in their music. The birth occurs in Kid A--hope; adolescence in Amnesiac--angst, confusion, apathy. A statement of the modern world. I expected their next album to continue this thread. Turns out their brilliance destroys expectations. <br />  <br /> When I first heard of Hail to the Thief, I thought, &quot;great, another blah blah political sandbox&quot;. Trite. Then, I listened and heard brilliance. Understated ideas; gentle colors; subtle tension... it's amazing. It makes artistic use of all the tools, sounds, and forms of modern music. Not just using loops for the sake of loops, but loops as an expression of the idea.
B0001ZX0PG|2.0|I am glad I decided to rent this movie on pay-per-view before buying it because I will not be adding it to my extensive DVD library. Even though Sean Penn has the second ugliest smile in Hollywood (Second behind Sly Stallone), he still put in a helluva performance. I enjoyed it immensely. But the movie is confusing. It left me with a lot of questions at the end...for example, why wasn't &quot;Jimmy&quot; arrested for killing &quot;Dave&quot;? even after his confession to &quot;Sean&quot;, the cop and childhood friend? I don't get it?! I also didn't get what was going on with Sean's wife constantly calling and not saying a word..until the very last call at the end. Stupid. Just stupid. It didn't add a thing, Clint! <br />  <br /> Anyway, those who are giving this movie 5 stars must have been high when they saw this movie. It is not a 5 star movie.  <br />  <br /> The only 5 star movie I have seen this year is, &quot;Monster&quot;.  <br />  <br /> Mystic River, not bad cinema but be prepared to, during the scrolling credits, turn to the person with whom you watched with this perplexed expression on your face and mutter, &quot;huh?&quot; <br />  <br /> Seriously. <br />  <br />

Hey ummagumma, you ever hear of Sonny? At least you can attribute her fame to the right party. Allman was a junkie when she hooked up with him and after she dumped him. He couldn't help his faltering career, let alone her's! <br /> <br />In any event, long live Cher...every song on this CD is a classic. She has attained legendary status..people will be talking about Cher for many years to come...well beyond the lifetimes of mere mortals like us (oh and ummagumma too).   <br /> <br />Thanks for the laugh though ummagumma, it hit the right spot today!
B000286S8S|4.0|Key songs have been omitted. But I don't blame the band for that, as this falls squarely on the shoulders of those greedy record companies. They leave out certain songs, so that if you want all the bands hits, you'll be forced to buy the cds that they originally came on as well. Having said that, if this were truly a complete, historic, and comprehensive package, they would've included tracks like: Where Have All The Good Times Gone, Ice Cream Man,  Don't Tell Me (What Love Can Do), Humans Being, Me Wise Magic, and Without You (yes people, the Gary era DID exist). They could've dropped the live tracks in order to accommodate some of the other songs I've just mentioned, and a chronological listing would've been nice. Other than that, the new songs cook, and long live the mighty Van Halen!!

B000286S8S|1.0|Well ANOTHER &quot;best of&quot; so who cares. There are too many songs from &quot;Fair Warning&quot; omitted. The classic David Lee Roth mixed with the sappy love ballads of Sam just don't gel. <br />  <br /> The Dave-Sam-Dave sequence is a bit annoying, they should have at least separated them into their own discs. Then you could use the Sam disc as a coaster. It would have been even nicer to release this in two separate volumes, but then no one would buy the Sammy volume.

B00005JLYW|1.0|After seeing this agonizing &quot;mess&quot; of excess and absurdity, I was actually curious about the commentaries--Good Lord, there's a WRITER's commentary included here--since I wondered how anyone could comment about this scary piece of CGI fecal matter. I've actually spent more time trying to figure out how to express myself on amazon.com that they would print than I did watching the movie. It's just that bad.<br /><br /> Thankfully, FULL THROTTLE &quot;underperformed&quot; at the box office (studio lingo that it tanked), so the universe will not be subjected to another CHARLIE'S ANGELS film. Otherwise, I think we could be subjected to some form of supernatural plague of cosmic retribution for this gastric emission.<br /><br /> THE CANNONBALL RUN was the first movie I saw where I thought the people who made the movie had more fun than anyone actually watching it. FULL THROTTLE amps that sentiment up to a millionth degree (just watch the bimbo eruptions in the closing credits). Yikes.<br /><br /> These movies make the original TV shows look like classical theatre.
1592400876|4.0|When  an academic book hits the bestseller lists with such force, I'm going to be cynical here, most people buy it with one of two intentions: either they really intend to improve themselves or they know it'll look good on the bookshelf in the den.<br /><br />Of those that buy for the former reason, I'm guessing 8 of 10 (or maybe 9 of 10) don't actually really read the book, or at least, don't get past the first chapter or two.<br /><br />Now, this little book is good looking, so if you acquire it for the latter reason, you'll no doubt be highly satisfied, it feels good in the hands, the dust jacket is well done, and, there is a cool joke on the back.<br /><br />For those that are serious about improving their use of language through proper use of punctuation, this is a superb book, although, I must admit, it's a bit hard to read at times for non-academics like myself.  Having never attended college (o.k., the truth, I went for part of one semester, long ago) I've learned most of my writing skills by reading a lot and by writing as much as I can.  This book certainly helped me, although please don't use my tortured writing as any kind of representation of the results that can be acquired by a study of Eats, Shoots & Leaves, I just finished it and only read it once.  And I don't study.  So there.<br /><br />The person most likely to enjoy this book to its fullest is the English teacher that doesn't mind grading students work even on a Friday night, after a full week, because, after all, why put off for tomorrow what can be accomplished today?  Those of us a little less inclined to take such tasks seriously will no doubt receive less joy from a through study of the rules, suggestions and history presented here, however, I'd still recommend this book to those that enjoy writing and reading, and take it seriously enough to write anything beyond a very short email in a word processor.<br /><br />If you've read this far into this review, and caught the drift of my words, then buy Eats, Shoots & Leaves, you're probably the type that will enjoy it.f my words, then buy Eats, Shoots & Leaves, you're probably the type that will enjoy it.
B0001NBMBC|2.0|First off HELLO EVERYONE!!! something no one seems to have the time or the manners to say. <br /> Im disgusted at the way all of you critersize bands when you where only asked if you liked them, if not simply say instead of saying some pathetic and immature comment like they sux.

( this is the part where you list some bands off tele text or somewhere, so you cant possible be a wannabe)&quot; <br /> thats what you sound like. so what if someone likes this band. <br /> so what if they only like them because they are mainstream. SO WHAT!? come on why is it so important to you? thats there bussiness. All that should matter is you like this band or you dont. <br /> Dont try and force you oppinons on someone else.

0743216458|5.0|This is a masterpiece in personal and oral history of World War II.  Ambrose focues upon E Company in the 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne and so the center of the book is made up of the men and the experiences they had prior to, during and after the war.<br /><br />Because the focus is so narrow, the reader is treated to intimacies that rarely are put forth in broad histories of World War II.  Sometimes funny, sometimes heart breaking, and often amazing, Ambrose reveals the character and courage of the men of E Company.<br /><br />This is one of the best unit histories ever written about a company in any war.  Highly recommended for those interested in history, but even more so for those who need to gain a perspective of what happened during World War II.  After reading this, I would highly recommend obtaining and watching the DVD that Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg produced that captures so much of this book also entiteld Band of Brothers.
B000268QB2|5.0|I don't know why I bought this CD when I did... I picked up an advance copy at Amoeba in L.A. after hearing a 30-second sample on 'Somewhere Only We Know', just for the plain desire to take a chance on something new rather than my usual Hendrix-era stuff.  <br />  <br /> I'm waiting for the MTV people to discover Keane and completely overplay them, but as far as I know, they haven't. The album will remind a bit of Coldplay in the dream-like mood of most of the songs, and while they don't crank it up like the other Brit band, these guys can write a song. While the whole album tickles me, check out their main hit, 'Somewhere Only We Know', as well as 'This Is The Last Time', and 'Sunshine' as some main highlights. If anyone has seen the Steve Martin film &quot;Novocaine&quot;, tell me that the intro to 'Sunshine' doesn't sound identical to its score... <br />
0894803123|5.0|I tried out this book's chocolate chip cookie dough recipe along with my new Cuisinart quart ice cream maker today.<br /><br /> When they say &quot;generous quarts&quot; they MEAN it. This isn't necessarily a bad thing... but if you plan on adding mix-ins, I'd recommend adjusting the quantities by starting with half a batch. I seriously mean it: half a batch.<br /><br /> I should've known something was up with their recipe measurements when their sweet cream base added up to four cups of material (three of milk and cream, three-quarters for sugar, and two eggs) and then they were talking about another cup and a half of add-ins. Add the fact that ice cream expands by at least a quarter to a half when you mix it...<br /><br /> I ended up with closer to &quot;two quarts&quot; than &quot;one generous quart&quot; when following the cookie dough directions accurately, and I had to hastily shut off the ice cream maker to keep from decorating the entire kitchen!<br /><br /> So I'd recommend doing the quantity math on their recipes and allowing a cup or two of space for the air that gets mixed in during the process. (Or the easier way is just to cut the recipe in half, like I said earlier.)<br /><br /> But to me the best part of this book (aside from the delicious recipes) is that it teaches you how to think about ice cream making. It teaches about things like how much air gets added, how to vary the types of ice cream bases for different purposes, how to judge what kinds of mix-ins to use and when to add them in the process, etc etc etc...<br /><br /> The ice cream tastes fabulous, and they teach enough about the theory and options of ice cream making that I feel confident in following their guidelines to come up with my own stylized versions of ice cream. (I want to come up with a lower-calorie, lower-cream version, just for starters. And I love green tea ice cream, so I want to come up with a less milky base for that. And I've never heard of anyone doing this but I think chai ice cream sounds like a fabulous idea. And so on, and so on...)this but I think chai ice cream sounds like a fabulous idea.

B00003CXCT|3.0|Now just so you all know, I LOVE Star Wars.  I used to read all the exdended universe books, I can play the movies in my head like DVDs in and of themselves, and I still get chills when I watch the final Death Star run.<br /><br />Now that that is aside, I do NOT like these movies.  IT is nothing against the Star Wars movies, it is against what George Lucas has done to them and is continuing to do to them.<br /><br />These movies were and continue to be a cultural phenomenon that cannot be explained.  The reason that they were was that nothing like them had ever been made before.  EVER.<br /><br />Alright, I'll stop beating around the bush and say it flat out.  I believe that George Lucas should have left these movies alone completely.  I do not approve of anything that he put into them.  NOTHING.  In my opinion he has tainted what used to be a wonderful movie experience with the mistakes he has made on the subsequent prequels.  I grew up with these movies, I could recite them before I could multiply (not joking).  A large part of what made these movies great was that you could see the flaws in them.  Hamil and Fischer's shadows off-camera, the lightsaber blades disappearing at certain angles, the at times ridiculous-looking props.  It was charming.  Lucas has taken many of those moments away.<br /><br />Let's take a look at some of the things he put into the trilogy.  The Jabba scene.  Oh please, I definately see why that was originally taken out.  The scene sucked.  (PS.  Why the HELL is Boba Fett in that scene?  He would NEVER be just hanging around Jabba like some henchman.  He's the most deadly bounty hunter in the galaxy.)  Other things Lucas added.  Greedo shooting first.  Please.  The updated space battles.  Yeah they're cool-looking, but I was so fond of the actual models.  Other things, the extended Wampa scene, the new ending of Jedi...the list goes on.  I just can't find any reason why one should mess with a good thing.<br /><br />The least that Lucas could do would be to give us the option of getting the un-augmented version or not.  Just give us the choice, that's all I'm asking.<br /><br />I don't know if I'll buy this movie.  I do know that I will treasure my VHS originals (from the 80s) for a long LONG time.<br /><br />PS.  I also have no faith in the upcoming third prequel.

B000006045|5.0|I'd previously had a passing - though rarely pursued - interested in Massive Attack, and knew how respected they were. I threw on Mezzanine out of curiosity and it's hardly been off my MP3 player since. As a classically trained pianist, deep, emotive intentions mixed with carefully defined sounds and instruments are core to my musical 'buttons'. This album almost entirely satisfies against these and many more criterion.        As with most albums there's a couple of tracks you may not dislike but probably won't have on repeat too often. But of the shining examples, Angel, Risingson and Mezzanine are artistic in their conception, while Black Milk is arguably one of the most chilled out sounds I've ever heard.    The above songs are journeys, deliberate and structured and with a real sense of drawing you into its audible world and out of yours. More technically, the harmony and chordal choices, with intermittant dischord and struggle, only enhance the music. I would also agree with a reviewer further down who noted how well and poinient the voices were employed.    If you like your music to be involving, often dark, but always interesting, this is unmissable.

B00005JMJ4|3.0|How wonderful this invention calls DVD. It used to be that we simply watched a movie. These days, we have the privilege to catch a glimpse of how the movie got made, the scenes that ended up on the editing floor, the interviews with the cast & the production crew. Whilst this movie is great to watch, it doubles the fun to watch the additional features mentioned. Truth to be told, Sofia's effort is rather commendable for her second feature films. &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; got made afterall due to participation of the most under-rated comedian and actor from Hollywood, Bill Murray. Sofia even cried in the interview as she's still gobsmacked by the fact that Bill entrusted her to be the helm of this movie. She got the inspiration to set the location in Tokyo after her change of career from acting. My personal opinion tells me that Scarlett Johanssen's character is a real-life depiction of Sofia herself. When Scarlett's character talked about her been stuck & not knowing where she's heading, Bill's character assured her that in the end, she would eventually find a path for herself. It wasn't that long ago that we heard about Sofia's seemingly lost sense of direction when she bombed been an actress. If you have been to Tokyo before, you would probably emphatise with the sleepless two. There are many big cities in this world but none is as crazy & as mad as Tokyo. The buzz, the sound, the culture-shock, the technos, it's distinctly Tokyo. All the cliches are there. What made &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; special is the mood that the movie is able to portray; the charismas of both main characters. This is a movie about two lost people in desolation, lonely people trapped in their cocoon of circumstances & in their own special ways, they finally regain their soul & realising what truly matters for them in life. Perhaps, in the end, they both parted ways but the truly wonderful memory and their stolen kisses shall linger on for as long as they live. Highly recommended. Keep up the good work.
B0000062GE|4.0|I think my primary problem with this album was how moody it is.  I realize that Stabbing Westward is a moody band, but this album just didn't stand up to the test of time like their previous works did.  I can only take so much dispair and anger.  Eventually, you have to get up and do something about it.  Of course musically, it was a masterpiece of electronic rock compared to their final album which saw them take some rather odd turns.
B0001US62I|5.0|&quot;I know who I am.&quot; Dismay and disbelief resonate in this repeated, disquieting phrase at the climax of Angel Heart, seedy noir gumshoe story tangled with horror and one of the highlights of the career of Mickey Rourke.<br /><br /> In the 1980s, there were few film actors with the magnetism and innate acting chops of Mickey Rourke. Sure, there was Pacino, Nicholson, and DeNiro, all established in the 1970s, and Brando was still around someplace. There were rising stars on the scene such as Kevin Bacon, Kevin Costner, Tom Cruise, Charlie Sheen, and Val Kilmer. However, Rourke had a naturalistic approach and quality that none of his peers managed to evoke as well as he could. He brought an energizing and invigorating approach to his acting style, yielding fine gradations in his character portrayals, simultaneously dynamic, graceful, and gritty, and making it all seem effortless. From his earliest, scene-stealing film work in Body Heat and Rumble Fish, to his memorable performances in the poignant Diner and the vibrant The Pope of Greenwich Village, and even his star turns in mediocre fare like 9 ? Weeks and Year of the Dragon, Rourke seemed unstoppable and unassailable, bound to reap many awards and enjoy a lifetime of superlative film work. Alas, shortly after Angel Heart, the intriguing Johnny Handsome, and the exceptional, Charles Bukowski-penned Barfly, his career took a precipitous tumble. Movies like Wild Orchid, Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man, Another 9 ? Weeks, Exit in Red, Double Team (among too many others), a misguided foray into professional boxing, and discordant, abrasive words and diatribes against Hollywood and the acting world estranged him from his industry and his audience. In recent years, however, with his pugilistic aspirations on the ropes and callous dissonance and tactless commentary against the industry seemingly behind him, Rourke's commanding presence has resurfaced. He can be seen in several independent features, including the recent Spun, Steve Buscemi's The Animal Factory , Vincent Gallo's Buffalo '66, and with a heartbreaking performance in Sean Penn's The Pledge. Rourke also received critical raves for his appearance in Francis Coppola's decent film adaptation of hack novelist John Grisham's The Rainmaker.<br /><br /> 1987's extraordinary thriller/horror/neo-noir masterpiece Angel Heart gave Rourke one of his ultimate roles, that of small-time New York detective Harry Angel, a man on a mission of discovery. Based on the hardboiled novel by William Hjortsberg, the film takes a handful of liberties with the story, but sticks true to the book's central premise, situations, and characters. Though the action in the novel is confined entirely to New York City, the film sends detective Harold Angel from a cheerless Manhattan winter and into the sultry bayou of Louisiana. Low-rent P.I. Harry Angel is hired by the eccentric and enthralling Louis Cyphre (Robert DeNiro) to track down Johnny Favourite, a missing, once-famous crooner who vanished without a trace on New Year's Eve 1943, fifteen years earlier. Angel accepts, unable to refuse the work or the substantial pay. His legwork takes him from his dilapidated midtown office to Poughkeepsie, to Harlem, and to Coney Island, collecting clues and names along the way. All evidence about magic-dabbler Favorite points to a Louisiana/New Orleans connection, and Angel hops aboard a train. Out of the New York winter he steps off the train and into stifling southern warmth and humidity. His investigation continues, plunging him into the world of voodou ritual, and as the body count inexplicably increases, Angel's suspicions and fears intensify. Cyphre pulls the strings, and the fires of ultimate, crushing comprehension flicker alive in Angel's mind.<br /><br /> Alan Parker, responsible for the classic Midnight Express, wrote a sharp script, and directs with a keen and ardent eye for the macabre. His use of shadow and light reflects the evocative noirfilms of the 1940s and 50s, sinister, sharp patches of stagnant darkness cut by beams of cold light and unseen movement and rustling from the deepest shadows. Necessary symbolism abounds in the revolution of industrial fans, their rusted, creaking blades with measured, inexorable movement, in the tap dancing feet of a southern child, in the cracks of a splintered mirror and Angel's blank stare of a reflection. The trail is cold in the New York winter, but as Angel nears the truth, the heat nearly emanates from the screen itself. The magnificent photography by cinematographer Michael Seresin is perhaps some of the most underrated in modern film; that is how accomplished and chillingly exquisite it is. Capturing mood and setting alike absolutely perfectly, be it the sweeping and snowy landscape of upstate Poughkeepsie, the slushy, grimy sidewalks of Manhattan, the glaring winter beach of Coney Island, or the heat, dust and sweat of the Deep South, the photography excels at providing the requisite texture the film requires. The soundtrack as well, with a portentous underlying, undulating drone and indistinct, ghostly whispers, lends itself to the overall ominous build-up and effect.<br /><br /> Robert DeNiro as the well-coiffed, charming, and menacing Cyphre offers dependable support in his minor but crucial role. The several interactions with Rourke and DeNiro sparkle with verve, and it is almost a revelation to watch these two outstanding actors playing off each other so effectively. Their verbal game of cat-and-mouse, or master-and-puppet, crackles with wit, humor and an understated, looming peril. The final shot of DeNiro is unforgettable. Lisa Bonet, cast here during her Cosby Show heyday, is ideal as Epiphany Proudfoot, an indigent southern voodou priestess with an abundance of spirit and secrets that involve Johnny Favourite.<br /><br /> Angel Heart has its sporadic moments of blood and gore, the use of a straight razor, a ritualistic dagger, and an old-fashioned six-shooter, intrinsic to the storyline, and not simply present as shock value. There is a major jolt at the finale, however, as unwelcome recognition and discovery dawn on Angel and the hapless gumshoe finds out more than he ever wanted to know. For Mickey Rourke, this is some of the finest work he's done. His performance stands alongside his role as Boogie in Diner, Henry in Barfly, and as &quot;Jan the Actress&quot; in Animal Factory as one of the best of his career. Angel Heart is an intelligent, remarkably well-crafted modern noir film, and, in the end, as disconcerting and edgy as any horror/thriller to date.<br /><br /> &quot;They say there is just enough religion in the world to make men hate one another but not enough to make them love.&quot; - Louis Cyphre
B00000099Y|5.0|It's hard to believe that I've owned this CD for almost a decade now and I can still pop it in and have it feel fresh. Dispite all the talk of how angry Maynard is/was there is also a deep sense of someone working through that anger and pain in this album. He avoids the dark rock cliche and doesn't come across as one interested in stewing in his negative feelings (as is witnessed by some of his recent interviews) but instead as someone who wants to heal. His rants, while often bitter and angry, are based in retrospection and the quest for something better. As he says in the title track, &quot;Don't just call me a pessimist, try and read between the lines. I couldn't imagine why you wouldn't welcome any change, my friend.&quot;
B00005JN2F|4.0|First off, the movie was very entertaining and Matt Damon turns in another great Bourne performance, but where is the real story?  The credits say that the movie is based on the book but let me tell you, there is not one Iota of Ludlum's novel in this movie.  To say that I am dissapointed by this is the understatement of the decade and I think anyone who has read the book, or the series, will agree.  The novel spun an intricate web of espianoge set in Hong-Kong and dealt with a scenario that had global implications, not personal ones.  I think that it is atrocious that the movie was given the same name as the book.  The driving force in David Webb's life and his adventures in the novel was taken away and renders his internal struggle between Webb and Bourne meaningless.  All of the depth Ludlum gave Webb's character is missing and what we have now is a simple action thriller that is worth the price of admission, but is so dissapointing in plot that it is hard to enjoy.  If you are a fan of the books you will not recognize anything that remotely resembles the Supremecy so don't look for it.  If you enjoyed the first movie and are unfamiliar with the written works then you won't know the difference and will like this movie.  Hope this helps!
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|A very, very good debut. There is an animation not really felt in pop music since the infamous age known as New Wave.<br /><br /> I bought this disc as an impulse buy (a tradition I have had for years: buy one disc to replace a known album and a random disc to broaden my horizons). Many impulse buys eventually wind up as coffee cup coasters; however, this recording is bound to be an exception. The overly catchy (and derivative - let's not discount that) vocal and instrumental melodies are ideal in getting through a day at work, or getting work done after one gets home.<br /><br /> Highlights, for me, include the insistant &quot;Matinee&quot;, the Bowie-drenched dark-pop of &quot;Take Me Out&quot;, the manic energy of &quot;This Fire&quot; and the upbeat melancholy of &quot;auf acshe.&quot;<br /><br /> A great getting-to-know-you disc.
0553582453|2.0|Unfortunately, the Golden Fool continues the downward spiral of the Fitz books.  While the original trilogy was entertaining and lively, this volume plods on with unbearable slowness.  The crossovers with the Liveship trilogy don't help matters, as those who are unfamiliar with those books will have a hard time keeping the characters straight.  A number of reviewers have commented on the character development; however, what we really have is not so much development as Fitz acting far more stupidly than in past books.  It is this 'stupid behavior' that creates much of the conflict (like a horror film where the people keep doing the one thing you know they shouldn't do).  Further, Hobbs pulls her gay theme out of nowhere, springing it on the readers after the four previous books have not dealt with it.  Those sensitive to the topic should beware of picking this book up.  Overall, this volume  simply doesn't compare to the first three.  Frankly, Hobbs should have stopped there, while she was ahead.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Tim Burton has been lambasted numerous times in the past as only caring about visuals, having characters that are nothing but caricatures, and in the case of BIG FISH, having characters that are only an excuse to segue into an exciting visual. <br /> <br />Uh, wrong. <br /> <br />There's more heart and soul in many of his films, namely EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, and our topic of discussion today, BIG FISH, than in most other movies that I can think of. Each one brings a tear to my eye, each one is extremely beautiful, emotionally and visually, and each one tells a bittersweet truth about humanity, while enveloping us in a completely fantastical world at the same time. <br /> <br />I saw BIG FISH for the first time last night and I ain't gonna forget it any time soon. It's the story of a son, played by Billy Crudup, and a father, played by Albert Finney, whose life after his son's birth consists of nothing but telling the same blown-up stories again and again. This could be due to, or the result of, never being close to his son, and never being able to properly communicate with him (or people in general). Or it could just be a man blowing up the truth due to an unconscious dissatisfaction with settling down, and giving up the freedom of his youth. It could be a lot of things. <br /> <br />He spins yarns of 15' tall giants, witches, werewolves, tuna-sized catfish, bank robberies, mysterious towns, circuses, the Korean war, Siamese twins, and on and on, and his son is sick of hearing it. He just wants his father to tell him the truth, and is particularly humorless about it all, even as his father lays on his deathbed. <br /> <br />The stories are shown in incredible, often visually stunning flashbacks, with the quixotic Ewan McGregor as the young Edward Bloom, and I was very satisfied to see that Tim Burton is still using predominantly non-CGI special effects -- or, if they were CGI, they were tangible and extremely well-done. <br /> <br />The final scenes will strike some as too sappy or manipulative, but I though the effect of the entire undertaking was profoundly beautiful, especially the ending which brings everything together in a bittersweet fashion that never struck me as too sentimental, too apparent, or too conventional.  <br /> <br />Hats off to Tim Burton, for this was one of the best of 2003, and without a doubt his best film since EDWARD SCISSORHANDS.
0765310015|4.0|Gardens of the Moon is an amazingly complex first book for what promises to be a fiendishly complicated series. I've seen reviews blasting it for not being Robert Jordan-like or GRR Martinoid enough, which is fine with me. If you'd like to examine the roots of this story, go back and read THE BLACK COMPANY by Glen Cook. But you'd have to set your nets pretty wide to catch every source he's drawn on. There's a pinch of Elric, a dash of Dying Earth, chunks of flesh sliced from dozens of sword-waving heroes, but the flavor is distinctly Black Company. Why doesn't it have more elves and dwarves and orcs? Er, China Miville can explain it better than I can, but the short answer is that copying Tolkien is impossible and the results are usually crap. Read it for what it is: an impressive debut by a new author, who's published in Canada and UK but just arriving here, and who is six or seven books along already in a projected 10-book series.
B00009RDG9|3.0|If you're the type of person who doesn't like character development and plot cluttering up your movies, THE HUNTED is for you. It's cold, bleak, violent, and pretty much all action. Various synopses may lead you to believe it has a plot, and the film actually starts to build up to one, but essentially eschews it all in favor of Tommy Lee Jones and Benicio del Toro beating each other up for 90 minutes. The good thing is that this is a William Friedkin action film, so you know it's going to be graphic, gory, and very pulpy, with a good (although short-lived) car chase, and slightly arty direction. Honestly, though, I was very impressed how there was no music blaring away as Jones and del Toro stabbed the hell out of each other. Say what you will, I'm a big Friedkin fan, and I enjoyed this one.
B000050FEN|3.0|The first time I saw this movie, I liked it a lot.  But after seeing snippets of it on TNT about every week, it has started to get old.  I have realized that it is pretty much a standard formula film with some creepy music and a lot of foreboding.  Especially poorly realized was the killer's motivations...it was as if the movie sympathized with him and actually accepted his reasoning.  Please, spare me the psychobabble.
B000002P5W|5.0|I've listened to Hendrix for 35 years and still find Axis: Bold as Love his best. The songwriting on Axis is masterful, actually beyond masterful. This album is right there with Revolver for its brilliant use of the studio to create music. None of these songs could be played live, except for Little Wing.           We used to mill around out in the cold then come inside. I would flip on Axis, always Axis. The first side with Exp exploding into the jazzy Up From the Skies used to give us goosebumps as teenagers. Still does. Then the rest of the first side would just flow over you like a river.           Get up, flip the album with a stunned expression on your face then sit back and feel yourself floating as we drift through the second side. When it is finished you realize that your soul has been touched. This music is truly mind expanding, plain and simple.          Of course, Electric Ladyland and Are You Experienced are classics but fathertime has made it clear that Axis: Bold as Love is the Masterpiece. This is quite probably one of the three best rock albums ever made.
B0002858YS|5.0|The more and more i listened to this cd, the more and more i loved it, and it has now been in my player for the three straight weeks ive owned it. Each song will catch you and send you on a wild ride through the lyrics and/or instruments. This is a great new band and im already eagerly waiting for their next cd to see what else they have stored up in them. Definitely buy this cd.
0385336810|2.0|First, Emma is a clone or twin sister of Rebecca Bloomwood. Their personality, background, family and friends are almost the same. Both constantly tell lies to almost everybody. Hmm..., I guess that's why Emma has so many secrets since she keeps lying all the time. Their boyfriends are similar too. Jack Harper replaced a multimillionaire PR representative, Luck Brandon. The new boyfriend is a CEO of Emma's company. The twin sisters' romance and surrendings are a bit different even thought both are ordinary nothing special girls (it's said in the book). Both are extremely lucky girls since even though there is nothing special about them, they both successfully attracted multimillionaires. But this is fine, I have no problem coping with this. However, the whole plot is very weak; I don't want to believe this story at all.  How Emma gripped Jack was when she confesses her innermost secrets, her whole life secrets, to him. This is really hardly believable. In real life, those bizarre secrets would turn off a man more likely than attracting him. I couldn't see how they fell in love. One day they just were. It's not so irrational to see why Emma loves Jack because it's easy for a young girl to fall in love with a handsome CEO. But it makes no sense that Jack falls in love with Emma.    Jack told all of Emma's secrets in public. This is very insulting to any person. But Emma forgives him right after Jack told her his silly secret? Is it necessary to talk about a girl's secrets at all during his interview? What does he want to prove? To prove he does enough marketing research? To prove he absolutely knows enough about a single girl? As a responsible man, especially a CEO of a big corporation, Jack ought to be very sensible of what should and what shouldn't be said in public. If Jack is so sensitive about his own secret, why does he care so little of other people's secrets? Jack keeps talking and talking; I thought he is insane. After I found out what Jack's secret is, I think, in one word, Jack is so phony; he only exists in this book.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|well actually i do no what to say. but this record dont but her first. her first isnt that good but this one is...i dont no y ppl go and say bad things about avril. i think in her second record it shows that she is creative and stuff cuz this time the only ppl who edited her songs were her friends. this is why u shudnt buy her first record cuz it was edited by producers and managers. anyway...its true that just wearing a tie doesnt make you original, but whos to say she isnt punk? we never met her, we dont no her lifestyle. her music, you can say without arguement, is not punk. its full of catchy chorus' which i will admit but, its not like it makes her a bad person. i like avril lavigne whether shes punk or pop or anything, this isnt about her clothes or what she says about herself and all that other sh*t, its about the music and nothing else.
B0001Z363W|2.0|To each is own.... I guess. I heard some of the other B.L.S. stuff on the radio, and with Ozzfest in a few days, I finally decided to pick up one of his CDs. WOW! What a disappointment. I was ready to f#$cking rock and... NOPE! All the songs on this disc are slow, moody and pretty lame. I'm sure there are die hard fans who love this disc, but if your are a B.L.S. first timer...DO NOT BUY THIS DISC! I know, opinions are like blah blah blah.... That's just my 2 cents.
B000002UUX|5.0|I have been listening to this album since it was released, and it remains one of the best of its genre out there. <br />Individuals who rate this album 1 star, along with Metallica's Master... and Ride..., while giving Megadeth's Risk and Metallica's St. Anger 5 stars, clearly has too much wax in the ears, no musical sense or no grey matter whatsoever. <br />It is accepted by all that Risk sucked... even Mustaine acknowledged that.   <br /> <br />Rust in Peace is a piece of Metal genius and aguably Megadeth's best.  It is intelligent Metal with one of the most awesome and intricate guitar-work and excellent drumming.  This is the one classic line-up that Megadeth should have stick with.  This album is one of the yardsticks, like Metallica's Ride the Lightning and Master of Puppets, by which Metal is judged!!!
B000002UJQ|3.0|(Actual Rating- 3.5 Stars)<br /><br /> OK Computer(1997). Radiohead's Third Album.<br /><br /> After the mutual success of Radiohead's second album, 'The Bends', and two huge world tours with other Indie Rock Gods R.E.M. and Alannis Morrisette, Radiohead's third album, originally titled 'Ones and Zeroes', changed in late 1996 to 'OK Computer', was waited patiently upon by Radiohead's fans. Radiohead recorded the album in a fourteenth-century manor house owned by actress Jane Seymour (of Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman fame). Located outside of Bath, England, the isolated mansion was also used by the Cure to record their album Wild Mood Swings. One month before the album's release, in May, the single &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; was released in the UK and climbed to No. 3, and when 'OK Computer' was released a month later it debuted at #1, and entered the Billboard Top 40 in America, signifying 'OK Computer' was, and still is Radiohead's most popular album. Since this was my first Radiohead album, and I've read about how good they were, I was expecting a lot, so my review will reflect that. So, does Radiohead's 'OK Computer' live up to its popularity or is it an overrated and overhyped bomb? Read on to find out...<br /><br /> Track Ratings-<br /><br /> Airbag- &quot;Airbag&quot; is a mellow rocker, using Yorke's beautiful vocals behind background music of cellos and a middle-eastern mandolin to hit home along with the symphonic drumming. Great production, and the drums sound perfect! An odd but overall good song!<br /><br /> Paranoid Android- &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; starts off slowly with Yorke's mellow vocals behind a slowly chugging acoustic guitar, and adds in keyboards for the chorus. Soon after Yorke shoots out angry vocals, and O' Brien's electric Black Sabbath-y guitar comes in, taking the song in a new direction, but soon after gets mellow and then hard again. Ultimately &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; is a satisfying rocker with some cool guitar work. Good song!<br /><br /> Subterranean Homesick Alien- &quot;Subterranean Homesick Alien&quot; is much like &quot;Airbag&quot;, using Yorke's mellow vocals and Brien's mandolin-like guitar riff, picking up in the chorus where it incorporates added keyboard effects. A decent song, yet it gets a tad boring and sounds a little too much like &quot;Airbag&quot;.<br /><br /> Exit Music(For A Film)- &quot;Exit Music(For A Film)&quot; is another ballad, and for almost 3 minutes you just hear Yorke's vocals, but then a rather gothic bassline picks up the music, adding in keyboard effects. Really only one minute of this song has any music, so I didn't really like this song.<br /><br /> Let Down- &quot;Let Down&quot; is another mellow rocker, adding in a slight keyboard effect behind Yorke's symphonic vocals, picking up for the rather catchy chorus. There's also a pretty cool synth solo near the end of the song, making &quot;Let Down&quot; a pretty good ballad.<br /><br /> Karma Police- &quot;Karma Police&quot; uses a dark bassline, keyboards, and Yorke's cheery vocals to mold a catchy song. The background keyboard works well here, and I also like the chorus. Once again, a slow but pretty good rocker.<br /><br /> Electioneering- &quot;Electioneering&quot; is a filler song featuring computer vocals that people with verbal deficencies have. Stupid.<br /><br /> Climbing Up the Walls- &quot;Climbing Up the Walls&quot; puts Brien's guitar up-front, along with the perfectly tuned drumming and keyboarding, adding in Yorke's beautiful vocals to complete the mix. Great chorus, and an excellent vocal performance courtesy Yorke. Creepy musical interlude that perfectly mixes with the album. &quot;Climbing Up the Walls&quot; is definitely one of the album's highlights.<br /><br /> No Surprises- &quot;No Surprises&quot; uses Yorke's distorted vocals behind a slowly pulsing drum and keyboard beat, but Brien's guitar chugs along after a while, and his solo and guitarwork are some of the album's best. A good song.<br /><br /> Lucky- &quot;Lucky&quot; starts off with a sweetly innocent guitar riff, and Yorke sings behind them with his melodic vocals. Ultimately &quot;Lucky&quot; becomes extremely boring because the song has nothing to offer, except for maybe for good vocals, but repetitiveness isn't one of my favorite techniques.<br /><br /> The Tourist- &quot;The Tourist&quot; starts off with an acoustic riff behind Yorke's echo-y vocals(By that I mean they seem to be far away). Like most of the albums it picks up slightly for the chorus but ultimately gets way too repetitive, turning into something of a lullaby.<br /><br /> Overall, 'OK Computer' definitely didn't live up to the expectations I'd set for Radiohead. Don't take me wrong, Radiohead isn't talentless, because Yorke is a beautiful vocalist and keyboardist, and in the few occurences where O' Brien is allowed to flex his guitar talents(Ex. &quot;Paranoid Android&quot;), the results are good. What hurts 'OK Computer' is its repetitiveness, as almost every song sounds in one way or another like the previous one, as all use mellow vocals, barely-there acoustic guitar riffs, slight keyboard usage, and melodic vocals from Yorke to create ballads that never seem to quite pick up. Radiohead is much like Modern Rockers Coldplay, but unlike Coldplay, Radiohead's songs always seem to be mellow and never pick up enough, making most of the songs to be more like &quot;lullabies&quot;. I went in with an open-mind to 'OK Computer', yet to many tracks seemed to lag on for too long, and repetitiveness was a common trait. Instead of Rock music, Radiohead appeared to be mostly a New Age band with hints of Alternative Rock here and there, so if you're fans of New Age you may like this quite well. Otherwise, I suggest you avoid.<br /><br /> RECOMMENDED TO FANS OF NEW AGE, SOFT ROCK, AND RADIOHEAD. COLDPLAY FANS MIGHT ALSO ENJOY THIS, BUT MAYBE NOT. THERE ARE GOOD SONGS HERE, YET THEY'RE NOT QUITE MY TASTE, YET IF YOU LIKE SOFT ROCK RADIOHEAD MIGHT BE TO YOUR TASTES!<br /><br /> Killer Kuts- &quot;Paranoid Android&quot;, &quot;Climbing Up The Walls&quot;.<br /><br /> Also Recommended-<br /><br /> A Rush of Blood To The Head- Coldplay<br /><br /> Parachutes- Coldplay<br /><br /> Hail To The Theif- Radiohead<br /><br /> Thanks For Reading!ome of the album's best.

B0000640SB|5.0|Aww Will Smith at his best. That's what he is in Men in Black with his character J. This movie was a huge bright spot in the summer of 97 and is one of the best sci fi comedies ever made.<br /><br />James Edwards(Smith) works for the NYPD. He's a good cop despite what his peers say. After a chase with a criminal he meets a stranger Kay(Jones) who tells him to meet him. Edwards goes to the meeting at the strange building to find that it is a recruitment meeting.<br /><br />Kay gives James a proposition. Join the Men in Black and help them control the aliens on earth. James is skeptical about it, but in the end he joins. In the meantime an illegal alien has come to America. It's an oversized coachroach who is killing some princes looking for the galaxy. Now it's up to the Men in Black to kill the roach before the Princes family destroys planet earth.<br /><br />You have to love the two stars in this movie. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are amazing. The two are a great duo on screen. Their timing with each other is awesome and you can tell the two enjoyed working with each other. Smith plays the normal character we've come to see him play, but he plays that role so well and we love it. Jones is great as well and he plays Kay like only he could.<br /><br />The special effects are great in this movie. The team at ILM did a great job with all the space and bug stuff. Lots of credit has to go to Barry Sonnefeld for doing a great job.<br /><br />There isn't anything to not like about this movie. It's funny and the action is good. If you like Will Smith then you have to see this. If you want a good sci-fi comedy then strap in. Here come the Men in Black.
B000068PQ7|5.0|Gene Clark was one of the greatest singer/songwriters of the 20th century. This is one of his best albums. Gene's greatest ability was to express, in the length of of a song, an intense percerption of the immediate situation. Neither Dylan or Morrison could do this. For the closest literary comparisons check out Henry James or Marcel Proust. I refer you to songs such as &quot;Because of You,&quot; or &quot;Where My Love Lies Asleep&quot;. He was one of a kind.

I predict bucketloads of these showing up in the used cd stores. The production of this release was poor (see other reviews on the mixing or cutting off of songs). Also, if this is truly the
B000089RVX|4.0|As my title says, I don't think this band is very groundbreaking, seeing as half the bands on MTV2 sound similar to them.  <br />  <br /> However, the reason I gave this CD such a high rating is 1- because of Amy Lee. Her voice is absolutely incredible- one of the strongest I've heard in years. Frankly, I think she could do better, but it works well enough for her, and obviously she likes what she does. And 2, because I really did like listening to this album, even though I not a fan of this genre. I found myself listening to &quot;Fallen&quot; several times during the week I had it in my possession (then it was cruelly taken back by my friend. Sigh.), and enjoying every single track. &quot;Going Under&quot; and &quot;My Immortal&quot; are clear standouts, mostly because Amy Lee's voice is strongest in those tracks. The power of this CD comes from Lee's voice- without it, this band would never have the recognition is has.  <br />  <br /> With that said, I am absolutely not an expert on music. I am only 14 years old, and do not have the experience to tell you whether this is truly a good album or not. But, I can tell you I really enjoyed it, and it was well worth the time I spent listening to it. You can't expect to be absolutely blown away by this album, but you can expect to be entertained.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This is a very slow moving film that describes two lonely, melancholy, lost people with empty lives who find friendship.  The characters never grew, but remained the same empty, melancholy, lost, lonely people (although now each has found an empty, melancholy, lost, lonely soul mate).  I thought the film was depressing and pointless; perhaps it's because I lacked empathy for the characters.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|O.K. if you're hesitant about buying this because you heard it is not as good as Iowa, then you are correct in that respect.  Iowa was a blistering assault on the senses and was pseudo death metal, but not quite all the way.  The production on that cd was earth shattering and thumped your heart w/that double bass.  Now onto this new cd review.  Let's get the (-) out of the way first.  The production is thin on this cd and the double bass sound is flat, does not pound, in the production dept., that Iowa did.  I wanted more blast, like Iowa, but the blast only makes 1 true appearance on 'Three Nil'.  My only other gripe would be that some of the songs are just throwaway instrumentals and some filler as well as Corey not being as aggressive as before on vox.  My 1 biggest complaint w/Slipknot now and the people who think this is the greatest cd in the world is when they talk about how beautiful Corey's vocals are on this.  During the recording of this cd Corey kept saying 'yeah the cd has heavy stuff, but we incorporate some real beautiful & melodic pieces in here'.  Hey people I personally do not want my metal to be beautiful for crissakes.  I am not interested in a metal singer sounding beautiful dammit.  If I wanted to listen to some melodic stuff I would slip some old Maiden or something like that in, but when I listen to Slipknot I am not interested in that.  I like bands that progress, absolutely, but I hate when bands want to go into a different direction to either gain more fans or just to escape the stigma of being a real heavy band.  You may sell more records and be on more stations, but you wind up loosing the essence and soul of what you're about.  Oh yeah on a side note, Slipknot should stop fronting.  Over the years they have made quite alot of promises to take death metal bands on tour w/them, like Deicide, Suffocation, Internal Bleeding, to name a few.  This gets bands like that all pumped up, because the death metal bands would get more exposure but it's also a golden opportunity to play bigger places.  Slipknot have not made good on any of these promises therefore I have come to think they should just hang out w/the Limp Biscuit types of crowds and take those types of bands on tour, since that is basically the types of bands they tour with. <br />Being a member of the Death Metal community for 20 years I take offense to these false promises they made. <br /> <br />Phew-had to get that off my chest. Though it seems like I do not like the cd, I do in fact like it, it's just that I had some bad cereal this morning and needed to get the negative out of the way first.  The cd has alot of catchy parts and 'Three Nil' is one of the best Slipknot songs ever-total brutality and heavy slammin'.  The musicianship is incredible on this cd, too bad that drumming was not brought out more in the mix and production.  I love the guitar sound on this cd, has a dirty heaviness to it.  Overall a real good cd, just not the monster follow-up to Iowa that I wanted it to be.
0140277447|5.0|The atrocities inflicted by the Japanese Army upon the Chinese citizens in Nanking during the late 1930s serve as one of the most savage and brutal chapters in the history of mankind's violence towards one another. This book brings to light the sheer barbarism and mass sadism of the Japanese Imperial Army during the Sino-Japanese War. The reason why this ugly incident in history has not received much attention in North America is two-fold. First, &quot;yellow on yellow&quot; violence--with no obvious religious or racial implications--does not seem to merit attention here. Secondly, the Nazis' Holocaust against the Jews is what grabs the headlines and continues to hold the attention of the American public. The Rape of Nanking should not be seen by Holocaust historians and marketers as a competing incident, but one which bears many parallels in brutality. Perhaps the notion that the Nazis were NOT without equal in brutality, sadism, and pure evil is what scares certain people who want to highlight the Holocaust as a singular event in history which shall never be equaled. <br />  <br /> The result of this lack of attention towards this episode in history is that many average Americans have a very ignorant and naive admiration for the Japanese. I shudder whenever I hear a fellow American point to some aspect of life in Japan which he finds admirable, commenting, &quot;I wish America could be more like Japan.&quot; Believe me, we DO NOT want to be more like Japan. <br />  <br /> It is sad that the people in the Japanese government following World War II to the present day have seen fit not to teach Japanese schoolchildren anything negative about Japan. Japan's imperialistic yearnings and warlike behavior are never mentioned in Japanese textbooks. The attack on Pearl Harbor is glossed over as a minor event exaggerated by America as an excuse to enter World War II. And, naturally, the rape of Nanking is not mentioned at all. The bombing of Nagasaki and Hiroshima, however,merit endless chapters in Japanese history texts. It is quite sad that, for the sake of nationalism, Japanese students are brainwashed into mass victimology, never learning the entire story of their nation's history. <br />  <br /> I also find it rather revealing that certain people have quibbled about Iris Chang's estimates regarding the number of victims of the Japanese assault of Nanking, but not voicing a single syllable disputing the actual behavior of the invading Japanese soldiers--including rape, mutilation, torture, mass executions, mass live burials, beheadings by sword, the use of live Chinese men for bayonet practice, the forcing of Chinese women into sex slavery for the Japanese soldiers' pleasure, sadistic experiments such as injecting urine into Chinese victims' veins and watching them die painfully, etc. Nor do they dispute that the Japanese Army wantonly bombed and sank the USS Panay, anchored along the Yangtze River in Nanking, despite the fact that it was packed with businessmen, diplomats, journalists, and refugees from Western countries. Those who question the research methods and so-called ulterior motives of Ms. Chang need only refer to page 448 of renowned historian Jonathan Spence's THE SEARCH FOR MODERN CHINA for reaffirmation of what is reported in THE RAPE OF NANKING. <br />  <br /> I can understand why the Japanese government would willfully suppress and discredit books such as THE RAPE OF NANKING for its own purposes. But ignorant, brainwashed products of Japanese schooling need to open their eyes and look at what really happened, rather than reinforcing their inadequate educations by covering their eyes and ears and denying facts. I have socially conscious friends who absolutely refuse to buy Mercedes, BMWs, Audis, and VWs based on what the Nazis did to the Jews. Yet, these people pat themselves on the back for driving Toyotas, Nissans, and Hondas instead. Where is the sense in this?
B00005JN2F|5.0|Wow! Talk about a taut, mind-numbing set of sequences full of energy, moment and action, this sequel to the original -The Bourne Identity- is that most elusive of entities, a much better, tighter, and suspenseful movie than its original. This sharply spun tale allows Matt Damon to reprise his role as Jason Bourne, the recovering amnesiac CIA spy gone AWOL, this time running for his life through a catalogue of cities from Goa, India to Berlin, and from Berlin to Moscow. And with an action coda that brings to mind the breathless pace of such action classics as Steve McQueen?s -Bullitt-, it is so quick, deft, and terrific one can literally get lost in the activity.<br /><br />  Damon is superb as Bourne, an angry, amnesiac, and absolutely murderous foe for anyone who crosses his path with deadly intent, which seems to happen with stunning regularity in this film. Given the current popular disgust and disdain for the CIA, the movie hits home by portraying its hierarchy as thugs in business suits, bent on silencing Bourne regardless of his innocence or guilt. Damon is losing some of his boy-next-door qualities, but burns up the screen with an Eastwood like set of facial expressions that underplay the emotions and make the dialogue often sparse and terse. His physical presence more than makes up for the verbal void, however. His moves are nothing short of spellbinding.<br /><br />  Luckily, the plot avoids the current morbid Hollywood preoccupation with terrorists, middle Eastern personalities, or religious overtones, and rather chooses to concentrate on more traditional East European skullduggery with undertones of big money and dirty oil deals in setting the stage for murder, mayhem, and some of the most outrageously memorable car chase scenes this side of -The French Connection-. This is an exciting movie franchise that one can rest easy about, knowing it will certainly be fleshed out entertainingly over the years by Damon and company. With superbly and smartly produced thrillers like this, why not spin the yarn as far as it will go? Enjoy!thrillers like this, why not spin the yarn as far as it will go? Enjoy!
B00018D44U|5.0|This is a great CD which shows Norah Jones' ability to switch from Jazz to Blues to Country Themes and still maintain her very very unique sound... I believe she is the best artist around today who keeps doing her art without being caught up in the &quot;celebrity&quot; which has affected so many of the young artists today. But I stray from the reason I'm writing this review... <br /> I was shocked to see some who dissed it and I think it should not be missed.. Again, she soars and I loved it almost as much as her first... I'm waiting to see her show coming to my town and await more of this very talented artist. <br />
B000286S8S|2.0|Eddie Van Halen IS NOT Van Halen. <br /> Van Halen is Van Halen. <br /> The butchery of the end of &quot;Finish What Ya Started&quot;,the uncomfortable and tense Sammy vocals for the three new songs and the stupid-as-anything Dave-song-then-a-Sammy-song sequencing further underscores how terrible Van Halen has been for about ten years now. <br /> It's so over,man. <br /> Too much damage has been done to the Van Halen legacy. <br /> It was fine when they were with Dave. <br /> It was fine when they took up with Sammy. <br /> It got really bizarre when they sacked Sammy to get Dave back then to get rid of him to get Gary Cherone (who sounds like a Sammy-wanna-be on 'VH III') then to dabble on the low again in the studio with Dave then nothing for x-amount of years until they got Sammy back again.  <br /> I blame it on Eddie. Guitar virtuoso,but an a-hole when it comes to managing his band and overseeing the product it puts out. <br /> Truth? <br /> Sammy was *the* only singer they could turn to in light of everything. <br /> David Lee Roth blew his chance to make peace with Sammy and is now insane.. Sammy took the high road and extended an olive branch to Dave on that 'Sam & Dave' tour they did two years ago,but it was to no avail. <br /> I very soon gave away my copy of 'Best Of Both Worlds'. <br /> The new songs are quite poor. &quot;It's About Time&quot; is rather bland; &quot;Up For Breakfast&quot; is hideous and &quot;Learning To See&quot;,average.  <br /> I feel sorry most of all for Sammy Hagar,and then David Lee Roth. (Michael Anthony,too.) <br /> Sammy means well,but he'd be better off being on his own. <br /> David Lee Roth is now too nuts to work with anybody and Michael Anthony should stick with Sammy and do something. <br /> The Van Halen brothers: great as they were once,are now a caricature and a travesty to their own legacy. <br /> Two stars for the choice Dave and Sam material here,but minus a few stars for the horrible sequencing,the Eddie-egomania(the cover looks like a friggin' VH tribute album,which maybe what Van Halen is today...) ,the retarded Dave-then-Sam sequencing and the sheer absence of &quot;Mean Street&quot;,&quot;Unchained&quot;,&quot;Don't Tell Me (What Love Can Do)&quot; and &quot;Humans Being&quot;.  <br /> Van Halen used to be cool once,and much of this music is indicative of that. But now most of them are greedy old has-beens and they should've hung it up. Best of luck to Sammy,Michael and Dave (who's gonna need it). The Van Halen brothers? F You. Thanks for nothing. What a waste of my $20.
B00023BLXK|5.0|Despite all of the bad reviews that 'Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights' received, I watched it anyway. I've always sort of had a place in my heart for Latin music, dancing, and a fascination with other cultures. I thought that a new version might give the '80s original new life. I loved every moment of the film. <br /> <br />Yes, some of the dialogue was corny, and yes, some of the plot was lame. But in light of these vices, I found the performances from the two leads excellent! Luna's first English film was great, and so different than 'Y Tu Mama Tambien.' <br /> <br />The music is incredible. The dancing is tantric. The culture and atmosphere is steamy. Overall: a very hot movie!
B000001FFR|5.0|9 songs of killerspeed classic American thrash metal awaits the listener with Anthrax's second album &quot;Spreading The Disease,&quot; you know this is going to be good just by hearing the opening track A.I.R. The amazing voice of Joe Belladonna, who is able to burst your eardrum with high-pitched screams, and who knows how to wail when it's time to sing. The guitarwork shreds on here, from high-pitch squeals to downtuned galloping rythms along with killer screatching solo's. The drums are just as pounding as well, Lars may as well turn in his sticks for a trumpet cause he's got major competition with Charlie Benante, he is quite a skilled drummer, with double-bass kickin' hard-hitting, metal thrashing skills. This is a hard thrashing album all the way through that never lets up.....maybe Metallica should have gone in this direction with &quot;St. Anger,&quot; oh well. I'm always in the mood for some good thrash metal, and &quot;Spreading the Disease&quot; certainly filled my ears full. Get it now, you will not be dissapointed!! The best songs here are 'A.I.R.' 'Lone Justice,' 'Madhouse,' 'The Enemy,' 'Armed and Dangerous,' and 'Gung-Ho.'
B0001Z52RU|3.0|I have two responses to this film: an emotional one, and an intellectual one. <br /> <br />My emotional response is that all of the actors played their roles with such convincing strength, and that the quality of direction was at such a high level that it was relatively easy to suspend disbelief (necessary in a film such as this). Even though many of the situations ? specifically the taboo situations ? were tired clich?-ridden retreads, my emotional responses to them were powerful. (During the film, that is. As I rethink them, I?m disgusted at myself for having powerful reactions to such tired retreads that offered no new explorations.) <br /> <br />The concept of the film ? an exploration into how our choices affect the outcome of our lives ? is, if not an original concept, always an interesting one. This film is, essentially, a macrocosmic exploration of that question. <br /> <br />Intellectually, however, my reaction is slightly different. We learn the likely reason for Evan?s blackouts as a child later in the film, but the explanation isn?t explored beyond that single connection. I consider that a considerable flaw, because when you start to piece each blackout with the supposed event that caused it, they don?t all add up. Moreover, much has been made of the quality of the drawing that Evan made as a seven year old. When we approach the end of the film, we understand what the painting represents. We also see that it wasn?t really a seven year old Evan that was drawing that. However, that disrupts the films prescribed timelines and organization as if nuclear fusion were occurring at its core. How could Evan, at that particular point in the film, possibly know what the sum total of his choices was going to be? Also, his father AND his grandfather possessed the same abilities as Evan? That?s a bit hard to swallow. <br /> <br />Still, it was an interesting film to watch. Better than I thought, but not as good as it could have been. <br />
B00004TDTO|5.0|I remember when I first saw Jaws and what an exciting experience it was.  The now all familiar pounding theme music, the head popping out of the hole in the boat, the shark cage attack, the spectacular demise of the shark, and always Quint!  What had dimmed after all these years was the wonderful first half of the movie on Amity Island.  Seeing the family sequences again, and the struggle that the Islanders had in coming to terms with the reality of this predatory shark and what it meant to their financial survival is really quite touching and painful.<br /><br />In the fine feature on the making of Jaws on the disk, Spielberg discusses how not showing the shark adds to the drama, but he also admits that the barrels had to substitute for the shark because the mechanical shark wasn?t working very well.  Frankly, I am glad it didn?t.  We see the shark just enough.  Implying the shark is supremely effective.<br /><br />While the main three characters, Brody (Scheider), Quint (Shaw), and Hooper (Dreyfuss), are so brilliantly played they have become immortal roles, there are many other fine performances that are overshadowed.  Lorraine Gary adds a wonderful reality to Brody family trying to fit in as newcomers to Amity Island trying to fit in.  I am glad they changed the character from the book.  Murray Hamilton as the small town mayor Larry Vaughn who is simply trying to keep the Island?s economy afloat and doesn?t grasp what is really happening until disaster has finally struck full force.<br /><br />The character roles of the fishermen and would-be fishermen are wonderful splashes of color on the film canvas and add humor to relieve tension and set up the second half confrontation so well.<br /><br />This is a superior film that has been imitated so often that we forget how good the original actually is.  This is a good disk with a good copy of the film and extras that help us appreciate how the film came to be.
B00003CXXM|4.0|How nice to watch a spy movie where, although Jason Bourne certainly is at the top of his game, it?s not a gadget filled James Bond wannabe. This is a credible film, with excellent acting by both Damon and Potente, and a storyline that is fresh, original, and keeps your eyes glued to the screen. <br /> <br />This was a rare film indeed from a revenue standpoint. It grossed $121 million in the U.S. theatres, and so many thought it was a failure, as it was hoped to be more of a blockbuster and bring in closer to what its total *worldwide* gross was - $214 million. Although $121 million is hardly a failure. HOWEVER, the movie cleaned up when it became available on VHS and DVD, bringing in ?Video Revenue? of $93 million dollars ? 77% of what it did in the theatres. To a geek like me, that?s fascinating. I?ve looked and looked, but haven?t found another film with similar numbers. <br /> <br />While many say that the reason the sequel is being made is because of the explosiveness of the VHS/DVD sales (to draw a comparison, Spider-Man had ?Video Revenue? of $112 million, compared to a box office take of more than $400 million ), and that statement is true, it?s unfair. This was a top notch film. <br />
B00003CXCT|5.0|I for one am totally ecstatic that the Star Wars trilogy has finally come to DVD. That music, the sounds, the awesome special effect. It's what I bought a home theater system for.  <br />  <br /> But to all those who have nothing better to do than complain, I say stow it. In a few years, an HDTV version will inevitably be released which will make this version obsolete. Its the nature of the technology so get used to it.  <br />  <br /> I have nothing against a director trying to make his movie what he wanted in the first place. I do agree that the DVD's should contain both versions of the film so you can choose which one you watch. I'm just thankful that I'm getting these at all considering that only a few years ago he vowed to never release them in DVD format.  <br />  <br /> Oh, and last point. I have every re-issue of the Star Wars trilogy. From the original release on VHS, to the re-release with the new cover art, to the re-issue for the box set, to the re-issue for the special edition box set. My point is, a true fan will take what you get, no complaint, no worries. Just enjoy. <br />  <br />  <br /> As for the prequels....well, I too am a bit disappointed (Jar Jar can rot in &quot;Bleep&quot; for all I care) but my main problem is the &quot;clean&quot; feeling the films have. Star Wars was drab, Empire was dark and moody and Jedi was slightly more colorful but they all looked &quot;old&quot; and &quot;lived in&quot;. Phantom and Clones (by the way, what a dumb title AOTC, and the character names (Count Dooku (rhymes with Poo Poo) look brand new and shiny. I also didn't like the pace. It went from one scene to the next way too fast. But you know what, At some point in my future, I will definately spend a day with my son and watch them from start to finish. All 13 or so hours worth.  <br />  <br /> Why, because I'm a fan
B00003CXHJ|1.0|Yet another piece of Hollywood trash trying to push a revisionist history upon the public at large. Isn't history interesting and broad enough as it is? Although loosely based on real events, this film unjustly tries to steal the laurels of English sailors and place them on American ones who were never there.          The acting was mediocre at best and much of the movie's techniques were a direct rip-off from the superior German film, 'Das Boot'. Yes, the Enigma encoding machine was taken clandestinely from a German sub, but not by Americans: it was done by British commandos. America had not committed to the war at that time.  Another anomaly was presenting the American crew as being racially desegregated when in fact, racial integration within the U.S. military didn't take place until the Vietnam War.          A real low quality movie that has nothing original to it. Every aspect of this film had been done long before and done better.  This film simply borrowed that material (e.g. 'Das Boot') and made it worse. Sink this film to a watery grave and don't pay Hollywood to produce such mediocre jingoistic propaganda.
B00005JMYG|1.0|I'm a Will Ferrell fan and looked forward to this movie.  This is a bad movie.  A very amatuerish screenplay where none of the jokes work.  Many of his friends from Old School join him but it doesn't help.  A fantasy fight scene including Vince Vaughn, Luke Wilson, Jerry Stiller and Tim Robbins is so contrived it's painful.  And a talking dog to help through the terrible plot?  The only bright spot is a very attractive Christina Applegate who never looked better.<br /><br />Trust me, I'm saving you money.  Wait for it to come on TV.  This is a weak movie as viewed by a fan.
B000002KE2|5.0|..say &quot;Vol. 4.&quot; This is a great great great album, and still stands as the stonerrock obelisk. Their most complex (exempting the arty, but also great, Sabotage) album, and an auditory record of the way the band was shaking itself to pieces.

B0000524CY|4.0|Almost 15 years after the first time I saw The Exorcist I decided to buy the &quot;The version you've never seen&quot; on DVD (obviously what drove me to it was the fact that now it is remastered with better video/audio quality and of course the 11-12 minutes of added scenes). <br />  <br /> As a jew, I do not believe in the devil as an independent force or a being as he (it?) is portrayed in this film. For jews (unlike christians) the devil is one of god's powers and never works independently with his own free will. God makes the decision to utilize the devil for its own purposes (either it be for the good or the bad). And while there's such a thing as &quot;demon possession&quot;, it does not turn a human being into a monstrous diabolical being as we see in this film. <br />  <br /> For these reasons this film never really scared me or shocked me to the point of fear or non-comfort. As a horror film it isn't much (good thing though, since I don't think much of horror films). As a psychological thriller though, it's excellent. While it has some shock and scare value, the true force behind this film is its implementation of psychology and human weakness. It portrayes how an innocent little girl can turn into a diabolical being in a matter of days and with total unawareness of any transformation occuring. <br />  <br /> Everybody knows that there's one thing worse than dying and that is losing your mind, the thing that separates you from everybody else, that allows you to understand the world around you. Even worse is the fact that one knows he has lost his mind and can do nothing about it. This movie deals with the same principle only on a stronger fictional sense (since in real life one cannot lose his soul and remain alive, obviously). Here it deals with losing one's soul to a devilishly corrupt demon, obviously Linda's character knows at first that there is something wrong about her, but she can do nothing to prevent it. Herein lies the strong psychological aspect of the film. <br />  <br /> Another strong aspect that the film utilizes is showing how weak humans are in relation to supernatural forces. So weak in fact, that one can lose everything he has in a second. Make no mistake though, this film is fictional in every way. Even though the film derives from past cases of &quot;demon possessions&quot;, it is fictional in the sense one does not turn into a zombie just because he is possessed by a demon or any other being for that matter. The film deals with the forces of good and evil in a clear-cut black and white way that doesn't really apply in the real world. Good and evil is generated from god alone, and not from any outside independent source (such as the devil). <br />  <br /> Bottom line, if you want to experience a psyche thriller you should get this. Not many movies deal with the subject in the manner and professional way this movie does. Certainly not for everybody, but you should enjoy this DVD if you're not easily offended and/or shocked.

B0002GTWYW|5.0|I usually am the first one to dis Puffy for continually make money off the death of the Notorious B.I.G, but I will give it up to him this time. This remastering got right what Nas' 10 year re-relase of Illmatic got wrong; it made it BETTER! The addition of two of Biggie's more obsceure tracks, Who Shot Ya(found on the Big Poppa single) and the innovative Dreams(even MORE obsceure) plus the DVD featuring his videos make <br />this a great buy for those who want to but some classic hip hop. One provision though; if they wanted to add unrelased songs; where's Party and Bulls*** from the Who's The Man Soundtrack?; and how about the One More Chance remixes? And how about adding some live performances to the DVD? Other than that, COP IT!!
B00005JN2F|4.0|Jason Bourne is back and being chased once again. He has been framed for the murder of 2 CIA agents. They worked for Joan Allen's character so she's doing everything in her power to find and catch Bourne. While a deadly assasin has been hired secretly to take out Bourne as well.<br /><br />  The result is a gripping thriller with intense chases and great action. Matt Damon is at his best once again as Bourne as well. This is no doubt his best role because he's just awesome in it and no one else can do it. He's unpredictable too, you never know what he'll do next. I loved the first one and surprised that I actually liked this one more. I can't wait for a 3rd one.
B00006IX0R|5.0|I'm not a big Cranberries fan, but when I heard the song &quot;Zombie&quot; I knew I had to have at least on album of theres. And when I heard there was a greatest hits collection of the Cranberries, I said I might as well buy the greatest hits. I was not disapointed. If you love soft center music, you will definitley love this collection. This is a collection from there toughest hits from 1992-2002, a collection of a decade of Cranberries. &quot;New New York&quot; and &quot;Stars&quot; are unreleased tracks, which &quot;New New York&quot; surrounds the actions of 9/11. You definitley need to pick this cd up. You won't be dissapointed. And hopefully the cranberries add another decade to their career. A must buy!!
B000002LHX|5.0|After reading 1 or 2 of the reviews on this page; I was compelled to send in my own views. &quot; Minneapolis Genius &quot;; truer words, in this ( 20 plus year fan )'s opinion, will never, ever be spoken. From &quot; For You &quot; to &quot; Musicaology &quot;, this truely, deeply gifted human being has never once disappointed me. I believe he is the most gifted artist of our time. I believe &quot; Come &quot; and &quot; Emancipation &quot; are the crowning achievments of his long career. I embrace his eccentricities as a part of what makes him so appealing. While I am well aware that I am not of the masses in today's music world; I embrace that as well. Prince never follows the leaders; he leads the followers. While it suppose it is a compliment of artists of more recent years to cover Princes' music; I, personally, don't believe there is an artist out there today that could ever consider themselves worthy of doing that. I am a lifelong fan of this man and his talent. One might even say I worship the man and his music. If there is flaw to be found in any note or word written in Princes' music; perhaps the listener is not listening deeply enough into their soul. Prince becons the listener to drink him in, sometimes, if you dare. I often wonder how fascinating Prince would be to sit and converse with. Just the sound of that voice that wells from deep within him, from you can't figure out where, sends a chill down my spine and makes my ears stand up. I wait, with bated breath for every expression of Princes' talent to spill from his collective works yet to be released to his adoring fans.  <br />  <br /> Signed, <br />  <br /> His Most Adoring Fan, <br /> Wendi...
B00008WG3U|4.0|I like NOFX and all especially the video for &quot;Franco Un-American&quot;, this is the first NOFX I got but it just wasn't what I expected. I thought it was gonna be non-stop punk but it just wasn't so great. I especially hate the song &quot;She Nubs&quot;. It's so annoying. But this cd still has some cool songs. I expected more from the song &quot;Anarchy Camp&quot;. I love the song &quot;the idiots are taking over&quot; though. It is hilarious. The enhanced cd is awesome. It has the video for &quot;Franco Un-American&quot; and &quot;the idiot son of an @$$hole (note:this is a live performance)and 8 minutes of the film &quot;Unpresedented&quot;. It is a over-look of how George W. Bush rigged the 2000 election. That film inspired NOFX to make this album. They hate George Bush as much as me. In addition to this cd you should buy &quot;Pump up the Valuum&quot;. Well, enjoy!
B0001Z363W|4.0|Zakk returns to acoustic with this his sixth offering under the Black Label banner. And what a wonderful return it is.  <br />It is a journey of emotions and sincerity told by guitar, violin, piano, outstanding songwriting and superb lyrics. Zakk's voice and guitar work will send chills down your spine. The highlights being 'Steppin Stone' and 'Fear'. <br />For those expecting hard metal you're not going to get it on this release but then again the album is called 'Hangover Music' so it really is a dead giveaway.  <br />A must for any real BLS fan.   <br />  <br /> <br />
B000002UR7|5.0|I'm not to big of a Radio-Head fan but I couldn't get the song &quot;Creep&quot; out of my head so I knew I had to buy this album. It is a great album with fantastic songs. I don't understand why people say this album sucks. Looking through the other Radio Head albums this might be the best album. Even though this album became the &quot;Nevermind&quot; for Radio-Head and Creep became Radio-Heads &quot;smells like teen spirit&quot;, it's like Nevermind, you just love it. Tohm Yorke doesn't even sound british. And most bands like the Clash,the sex pistols, and the Buzzcocks all sound british, but I didn't even know Radio-Head was a british band.  <br />  <br /> Creep (which was inspired by a adam sandler song) was the anthem for the youth of the grunge years. This is just an amazing album I can't explain in words, so you have to buy this album to understand what I'm talking about. A must buy if you are a radio-head fan, or even if your not a big fan this album will turn you into one.
0735619670|5.0|This book is so fundamental and common sense you might take it for granted. Don't make that mistake, buy a copy.  <br /> <br />This book covers a wide range of material, from variable declaration to variable naming to software design and probably everything else concerning software construction. This book talks a lot about style, but it is backed up with hard facts not just personal preference.  <br /> <br />The examples are written in several languages (such as C++, Java, and VB). It includes a very meaty chapter on design, as well as chapters on classes, high quality routines, and refactoring. Even though this is book is not mainly about design, it is the best design book I have read! <br /> <br />Each chapter has an Additional Resources section so you know where to go for more. The resources are also online on the authors website which is extremely handy.  <br /> <br />This book teaches you how you can write good and self-describing code. I wished every program I've had to read had been written by programmers who read this book and applied that knowledge. If you're a manager buy copies for all your programmers. It will be the best investment you ever made in your programmers and projects.  <br />
B00004Y6O9|2.0|This is a great album i must have heard some of this stuff when i was a kid but i never knew who played it till recently. This album has great classics like running with the devil and i really got you. The only fault i can pick in this album is that i feel some parts of eruption is over worked but once it gets into the general tune its a great song.And Avril_Lavigne#1fan i noticed that your always saying in the linkin park meteora CD reviews to stop the hating but i think your a hypacrite because u come in here and bad mouth Van Halen and Led Zeppelin Around here it goes u give a little u get a little You show us respect we will show u respect even if the music u listen to is created by half wits. u have a twisted idea of who are guitar legends if were talking about people that can barely play a guitar and hav riffs that a 3 year old could master then damn blink, good charlotte, linkin park and lets not forget avril lavigne take the cake. but if we are talking about the legends of the guitar world then i thinf those bands dont come close. I also noticed that u right reviews on Van Halen and Led Zep without evan listening to the songs on the album and judging it on its MTV air time. I'm sorry to break this to you but MTV sucks. All they do is play all the stuff like r n b, rap, pop, hip hop, nu metal (a plague on the metal name) and wat they call punk rock which it isnt punk is the sex pistols, the ramones and similar. PUNK IS DEAD!!! I think it u should stop posting reviews with real meaning except to bad mouth great bands and to give ur bands obvious 5 stars because u look at it with a one eyed approach
B000286S8S|2.0|Great for the Dave era stuff but Sammy in Van Halen never worked....completely changed tbe sound of the band from raunchy blues based RAWK to watered down soccer mom music.... <br /> <br />The new songs are nothing to get exited about...just buy the original 6 albums and call it a day...cause you don't need anything else but them.
0804115613|4.0|I saw this movie first, and liked it. Liking the movie usually means checking to see if it was based on a book (and not vice versa) and then deciding whether or not I liked the movie enough to actually read the book. In this case, I did, and don't regret it a bit. This was a very engaging story. Very similar to the movie, but as with all books (and as they should be), more detailed, and more intriguing. The style hooked me immediately, and the story stayed with me even when I couldn't continue reading it. I only read during work breaks so there was a lot of time between, and I looked forward to every break even more because I couldn't wait to continue the story. That's the mark of a great book for me. It's an endearing tale, and if you liked the movie, you'll love the book. Definitely worth the time.
B00003CXA4|5.0|This is a great film which gives us a good portrayal of Gandhi's life and achievements.<br /><br />The film portrays Gandhi as an honest, hard working and kind individual who always tried to do the right thing, even when facing overwhelming resistance.<br /><br />If you like the film I would suggest reading his autobiography The Story of My Experiments with Truth, which will give you an insight into his mind.
B0001NBMEE|3.0|I watched this movie fearing the worst, since it was derived from a comic strip character. Never fear--this is good entertainment. While this is not a film to take seriously, it is a fun excursion into the &quot;King Arthur&quot; theme and does avoid being straight slapstick. For those not familiar with it, &quot;Prince Valiant&quot; is the story of a Scandanavian prince whose father has been dethroned, who comes to King Arthur's court with the ambition of becoming a knight of the Round Table and restoring his father's kingship.<br /><br /> This film features an unusually good cast for a production of this type and caliber. Robert Wagner as Val, Sterling Hayden (of &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; fame) as Sir Gawain, James Mason as the Black Knight, and Janet Leigh as Princess Aleta all turn in very enjoyable performances. The swordfight at the end (no spoilers here) is great!<br /><br /> This is an excellent movie to watch with young kids, and adults will enjoy it too.
0618526412|4.0|I picked this book up knowing next to nothing of Carson McCullers but having a soft spot for stories set in the south in the early 1900s. Although interesting and well written, I found the first few chapters were not particularly leading me anywhere, as I expect most stories to do. My mistake. After Mr. Singer was fully introduced, I found it increasingly difficult not to read on in quest of what all of these typical yet unusual town folk had in common. Once I let go of looking for the typical &quot;plot&quot; and listened to what the charecters were saying and suffering and where they were coming from, the story was very absorbing. The sadness, desparation and yearning of Mick, Mr. Singer, Biff and Dr. Copeland, each in their own way, is compelling. I find it truely amazing that a young woman of 23 could write and create these charecters so insightfully. Sometimes when you read a book, it may not stay in your mind as much then as it does later on, when you think back and ponder the charecters and events. This is one of those books. It will have a permanent residence in my bookcase, and I look forward to reading other books by this author.
B0001ENYKS|5.0|Franz Ferdinand doesn't load its music with the heavy emotional hand of bands like Dashboard Confessional, the glossy artiste-garage sound of The Hives, or the amped up blues of The White Stripes. And you know what? That's fine. This is a great album because it's not about a musical movement or conforming to a certain idea of sound, but just about having fun. Fun is often something that lacks in music these days, but Franz Ferdinand serve it up in spades. The music is fast paced, engaging, and fun to listen to.<br /><br />This album won't serve up the kind of emotional response that we are getting used to from modern rock these days, but it will certainly make you want to get up and dance, and that's perfectly fine in my book.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Linkin Park's Meteora is everything i was expecting! It has something for everyone: <br /> <br />Hard Rock? Yes <br />Angry Lyrics? Yes <br />Turntable/Techno Bass Sound Effects? Yes <br />Screams? Triple Yes <br /> <br />This is a must have along with their 1st release Hybrid Theory. You won't regret it.
B0000026T4|2.0|Say what you will about Alice Cooper, but his music is a reflection of the times. You have the straight ahead 70's rockers of &quot;Love it to Death&quot; through &quot;Muscle of Love&quot; and his solo projects covered disco with &quot;Goes to Hell&quot;, 80's synth/new wave with &quot;Flush the Fashion&quot; and &quot;Special Forces&quot;, to the Nu-Metal sounds of &quot;Brutal Planet&quot; & &quot;Dragontown&quot;. In the 80's Alice tackled the Hair Metal scene with &quot;Constrictor&quot;, &quot;Raise Your Fist and Yell&quot; and his most popular album of the decade &quot;Trash&quot;. Now as an Alice fan, I don't really care for &quot;Trash&quot;, mainly because it doesn't sound like Alice Cooper. The songwriting, the guest stars like Joan Jett, Bon Jovi, the &quot;pop&quot; production by Desmond Child. &quot;Poison&quot; is a great song, no doubt about it, and really the only Cooperesque track on &quot;Trash&quot;. &quot;House of Fire&quot; sounds like a Joan Jett song, and would have worked on a Joan Jett album, but not for Cooper. &quot;Spark in the Dark&quot;, &quot;This Maniac's in Love with You&quot;, &quot;Hell is Living Without You&quot;, &quot;Trash&quot; & &quot;Bed of Nails&quot; are all okay songs, which would have fit perfectly on a Bon Jovi record, but Alice singing about lost love/being in love/finding love just don't seem to fit with Cooper's image. Now I can appreciate what Alice was trying to do here, but &quot;Trash&quot; does not hold up compared to his other music. You can put in &quot;Killers&quot; or &quot;From the Inside&quot; and the music still sounds fresh and original. &quot;Trash&quot; just sounds like so many other hair bands from the late 80's, and I think that's because too many of the then-popular stars of the era had too big a hand in creating the album. Still, I see some of the used copies here under $5, and &quot;Poison&quot; alone is worth that.
0684833395|5.0|Despite the fact that most of the characters seem to be caracatures and that this book is a very satirical look at military logic, this book threw me for a loop. The main character, Yosarean, is compelled after months of being put into the line of fire to stop. He no longer wants to follow the orders of his superiors who have no-one's interst but their own at heart. (This is best articulated by Colonel Cathcart, who longs to be featured in the Saturday Evening Post.) Yosarean's solution is to not go into harm's way any longer. Most of the novel is rapturously funny with characters who never answer a question with a satisfactory response. But toward the end the tone becomes dark and quite disturbing as Yosarean becomes more and more haunted by the memories of his fallen comrades, which amounts to nearly all of them. All-in-all this is most certainly a work that I would recommend to anyone looking for a laugh. But be prepared for an intensely dismaying end.
B0001Z363W|5.0|Zakk Wylde's latest relase is nothing short of a exceptional. While using acoustic and piano as the backbone of most of the songs, these tracks are still heavily laid with his mind-blowing solos and thundering riffs. For everyone who is narrow-minded enough to bash this effort because it doesn't &quot;rock&quot; enough, obvioulsy has no taste. Hangover Music is extremely well-done, presenting Wylde's versatile talents from thumping acoustic rhythms, a deep-raspy voice to his ever so popular metal shreding talent. The piano also adds a whole new level to the work. All of the songs are well written, meaningful, and soulful; presenting music that all listeners can relate to. Zakk Wylde has definitely outdone himself on this one by creating a sound that oozes with soul and alcohol.
B000059H99|4.0|Most people are liekly familiar with the later Rocky movies from the 1980s which featured the same basic story line: Rocky's against the ropes and finds the way to win. Sadly, most people are not at all famaliar with this first, and arguably best, installment of the franchise. This is the story of the quintessential underdog who rises to the top, not to win, but just to go the distance. It's a story that, while simplistic, is very familiar with a lot of people. There is good acting, and the cinematography is also quite good. Bill Conti's score definately sets the emotional pitch. The DVD provides a good quality picture and good sound reproduction. The special features, however, are fairly thin and not all that interesting, and that definately keeps this from being a five star DVD.
0800187881|5.0|Barbra Streisand is not dowdy, yet her perfection in assuming the role as a lonely, middle-aged woman (Rose) is flawless. Rose is an excellent and popular college teacher. She knows how to teach, the way to involve and enchant a rowdy class, and she would rather watch baseball than go on another &quot;dead end&quot; date.<br /><br /> Jeff Bridges (Greg) is the handsome, yet exceedingly boring teacher. Most of the students in his math classes sleep, pass notes, chat. He is a lonely man, but all of his interpersonal relationships end as the woman moves on. He believes it is because he chooses stunning woman and then becomes intimate. He decides to find a perfect mate, and the main criterion is that she be ugly. His campaign begins with an advertisement. Claire is Rose?s sister, and she responds to the ad as if she were Rose.<br /><br /> Rose lives with her mother Hanna Morgan, played by Lauren Bacall, who did receive an Oscar nomination for the role of a selfish, self-absorbed, snob. Hanna has kept Rose under her thumb and in her house, and always plays the &quot;What will I do if...?&quot; or &quot;Would you really leave me?&quot; card. Her performance is extraordinary because she undermined Rose to keep her taking care of mommy dearest, but it is subtle.<br /><br /> Streisand directed this film, and though it may appear to be a showcase for her many talents, there is a strong message. Do not settle. Never accept the belief that you are ugly, even though your Mom and others tell you, as they did her all of her life. You can always become the person you want to be.<br /><br /> Rose and Greg date and eventually marry, but the terms are no amorous encounters. For example on their wedding night, they watch TV and they sleep in twin beds. In growing closer and falling in love, Rose teaches Greg &quot;how to teach&quot; and they are constant companions. Rose believes she can settle for this lack of affection, but she is in love with her husband and is a very sensuous woman.<br /><br /> Even though I prefer action films, I loved this movie. It is one of the better &quot;chick flicks.&quot; There is a powerful and tender scene between Rose and Hannah regarding a very old photo. The universality of the film ? you are valuable, just as you are, do not settle -- makes this a classic favorite.<br /><br /> Victoria Tarranisensuous woman. <br />  <br /> Even though I prefer action films, I loved this movie.

B000286S8S|3.0|Lots of negative reviews here, some well deserved, but I am just excited to have some new Van Halen finally. The three new songs are great; the new stuff proves that Sammy's voice is better than ever, and Eddie remains a legend.  <br />  <br /> The cutting-off of &quot;Finish What You Started&quot; is completely annoying, and leaving off &quot;Mean Streets and &quot;Intruder&quot; was a huge oversite, but this CD still rocks!
0399215980|1.0|or was anyone else confused by this book? Now don't get me wrong I don't expect War and Peace in a children's book, but a little more dialogue would have been nice. As it is, there are 2 possible conclusions I can draw from this book: <br /> <br />1. The mouse is asking each animal to be his friend and they are all saying 'No', which makes them all very mean and not worth talking about or, <br />2. The mouse is only asking the other mouse at the end of the book, ignoring all the other animals completely. <br /> <br />Either way, here is the message I walk away with: Mice should only be friends with other mice (people should only be friends with their own kind). Is this what we want to teach our children?
B00005JN2F|5.0|I hate it when people criticize a movie (that's part of a sequel) when they haven't seen the first movie!  That's like criticizing a book when you haven't read the first 10 chapters!!  Overall, I thought the movie had great action and an intriguing storyline.  What movie watcher doesn't like a revenge theme.  Matt Damon IS Jason Bourne.  And he certainly carries the movie.  As mentioned previously, it does has a certian Bond-like quality.  If you liked the Bourne Identity, you will enjoy this movie.
B000069CWE|5.0|now i know a lot of linkin park fans are probably all like &quot;why did linkin park release this peice of crap? all it is is a bunch of remixes.&quot; that's true but they are kick-ass remixes and there is one or two new songs. most of them are slow like songs but a lot have catchy rap parts with good rap artists like motion man and and kutmasta kurt (hehe in the end). if you give it a chance you'll like it trust me.
6304884419|4.0|A Bronx Tale is a fine film about a kid growing up under two competing influences.  There's his father, an honest and hard-working bus driver; and then there's Sonny, a local mafioso who is slick, charming and seems to have everything in life.  The movie deals a lot with moral choices and values and manages not to belabor its points.  The ending is pretty moving; the magnitude of what happens is not lost on the characters, just as it's not lost on us.   <br /> <br />The one drawback to the film is that it could have been even more compelling than it is.  Despite the power of the storyline, and the love and care that De Niro obviously put into making the film, A Bronx Tale never goes that extra mile to greatness.  It never totally comes alive or totally pulls us in; there's something still missing that could have given it more force.
B00005NKKY|5.0|I won this LP on e-Bay as a college graduation present to myself in May of 2002, after months of fruitlessly waiting for it to turn up at the local vintage music store. My interest in this had been spurred by hearing &quot;Fakin' It&quot; on one of the weekend programmes on the local oldies station, a song I hadn't heard in years and had even forgotten existed; I was really keen on getting the album from whence that song came when I went back to university after the winter break, but it didn't show up. But once I finally had the album, I loved it and knew it had been worth the wait.<br /><br /> In some ways this is a concept album; not like a psychedelic concept album, but a concept album nonetheless. Many of the songs are linked together by a theme of getting older, going through the progressive stages of life. I even like the non-musical piece &quot;Voices of Old People,&quot; but then again, I also love the Beatles' sound montage &quot;Revolution No. 9,&quot; another non-musical album track that many people consider too weird or superfluous to listen to. There are so many great songs on this album, like &quot;America&quot; (I always get chills when I hear this song; it was a very moving moment when David Bowie did this song to open the October 2001 Concert for New York), &quot;A Hazy Shade of Winter,&quot; &quot;Bookends Theme,&quot; &quot;Old Friends,&quot; and &quot;Save the Life of My Child.&quot; Even though it's lauded as a classic, &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot; is way too overplayed on the radio for me to consider it one of my faves on here. The only flaw is that the closing track is &quot;At the Zoo&quot;; while it's fun and cute, it doesn't sound like a true closing track should. It would have been better if &quot;Hazy Shade of Winter&quot; had been switched with &quot;At the Zoo.&quot;
1878424432|3.0|I was really expecting alot from this book since I had heard so much about it. I listened to the Book-on-tape. To me, the Four Agreements seem very basic. This is probably a good book for a person just starting out on a spiritual path and who needs to start from the beginning.<br /><br />The ideas based on the ancient Toltec wisdom were given in a very clear and easy to understand manner. But there are places in the book where the author talks about Christian theology and ideas and he misquotes the bible. If he is going to compare his theology to a different religion, that he should have studied up and known what he was talking about.<br /><br />The book does give some clear ideas on how to transform your life. The book-on-tape was read by Peter Coyote and was very easy to understand.
B000286S8S|5.0|I HAVE TO RESPOND TO ALL THESE NEGATIVE REVIEWS I AM READING ABOUT THIS GREAT BAND.PEOPLE ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE WAY THE TRACKS ARE LISTED ,WHICH SONGS ARE SELECTED,LINER NOTES,LIVE TRACKS AND JUST ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE THEY CAN THINK OF.I AM THANKFUL THEY ARE BACK.THESE ARE VERY TALENTED PEOPLE WITH ALOT OF GREAT MATERIAL TO CHOSE FROM OVER THE YEARS.YOU CAN PUT IT IN ANY ORDER AND IT IS STILL GREAT .MAYBE THEY SHOULD HAVE HAD ANOTHER CD IN THERE WITH MORE SONGS ,THEY CERTAINLY HAVE ENOUGH MATERIAL.LOOK AT WHATS OUT ON THE MUSIC SCENE RIGHT NOW!I DO NOT KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT I AM VERY DISAPOINTED WITH THE MUSIC SCENE RIGHT NOW.NOTHING NOW CAN COMPARE TO VAN HALEN.LETS WELCOME THEM BACK !WHEN VAN HALEN 3 CAME OUT THEY GOT BLASTED WITH BAD REVIEWS AND LEFT THE SCENE FOR QUITE A LONG TIME.GARY IS A GREAT SINGER BUT LETS FACE IT,NOBODY COULD FOLLOW SAMMY.EDDIE IS STILL AS MIND BLOWING AS HE ALWAYS HAS BEEN AND MIKE AND ALEX ARE ALWAYS ROCK SOLID AND SLAMMING.THE CD IS GREAT AND THE NEW SONGS ARE AWESOME.I HOPE THEY ARE GOING TO RELEASE A FULL ALBUM SOON.IF THESE THREE NEW SONGS ARE ANY INDICATION IT WILL BE GREAT!!KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK BOYS AND GIVE US MORE!!!
B000000W5L|5.0|Exile On Main Street IS THE MASTERPIECE of the rock music of the 70s and definetly the best album of the Stones.It could easily be the best album in the history along with The Beatles - Revolver and Jimi Hendrix Expeience - Are You Experienced?.  First time I listened to the record i did not like it very much. I listened Sticky Fingers before (my first album of the Stones)and i didn't think that other album could be better than this. Well, i was wrong.  There's something about this album that cannot be explained in words. It grows with every listening and i've listenened it over 300 times! and i feel like I'm in heaven every time i hear it. Every song in here is really incredibile (well except for I Just Wanna See His Face) but what great album doesn't have a couple of fillers.My favourite is Rip This Joint, the greatest woogie-boogie rock song in the history. The late Nicky Hopkins on piano and Bobby Keys on sax are simply amazing. The pace of the song is outstanding.  Rocks off may be the best album opener in the history along with Gimme Shelter on Let It Bleed.Slim Harpo's Shake Your Hips and Casino Boogie are very good songs, a little bit underated if you ask me, great guitar work and the Mick Taylor guitar solo on Casino Boogie is the highlight point.  Tumbling Dice along with Happy are the only hits of the album and got radio airplay in the 70s. The blues Sweet Virginia has great armonica by Mick Jagger and good sax solo by Bobby Keys. Torn Frayed has great lyrics and good organs by Jim Price. Sweet Black Angel is a song of hope dedicated to black Angela Davis, a politic manifest and it has great percussion and harmonica in the end.  Loving Cup is one of my other favourite songs on the album: it's a country, blues and rock heaven.Happy got amazing guitar riffs and vocals by Keith Richards.Turd On The Run features harp by Mick Jagger and a great uprite bass section by Bill Plummer. Ventilator Blues is a great rock tune, the last minute of the song is pure bliss.  Let It Loose and Shine A Light are very good ballads. Mick Jagger's voice never sounded so raunchy and raw. All Down The Line is a powerful upbeat rock song (Charlie Watts drums never sounded so heavy and Bill Wyman bass rocks).  The final track Soul Survivor is a great ending to the greatest rock&roll albums of all time.  You couldn't have a complete albums collection without Exile On Main Street. It's as simple as that.
B000002UDB|5.0|This is the only one of the many American repackagings that Capitol Records got right, so much so that to date it's the only one which has been translated to CD, while the inferior British version of this album, a set of two EPs, is the only British version of a Beatles' album which hasn't been reissued on CD. Capitol did what they did with the last two Beatles' albums they repackaged, 'Rubber Soul' and 'Revolver,' keeping the title and cover picture entact and not taking as many liberties with rearranging or replacing the songs on the original British lineup. They kept the six songs on the double-EP, the first six songs on this album and the six songs featured in the movie (the title track, &quot;The Fool on the Hill,&quot; &quot;Flying,&quot; &quot;Blue Jay Way,&quot; &quot;Your Mother Should Know,&quot; and &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot;), but realised that six songs weren't enough to sell an album. Without compromising the spirit of this album by pasting on songs that had been recorded on an earlier album but kept back from the American audience, as they had done many times before, they merely padded out side two of the album with five songs which had been hits for The Beatles in 1967. Even though those five songs weren't originally part of MMT, they sound very fitting there and in keeping with the type of songs that had been featured on side one. In addition, &quot;Hello Goodbye,&quot; &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever,&quot; &quot;Penny Lane,&quot; &quot;Baby, You're a Rich Man,&quot; and &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; hadn't been featured on any albums. It was the perfect marriage. It was the old trick of increasing the sales of both an album and a single by having an album of filler padded out with hit singles, only by 1967 most albums were no longer made like that, and both the hit singles and the album-only tracks were winners. The only filler track on MMT I see is the asinine &quot;Hello Goodbye,&quot; but even that was a #1 hit.
B0001FR3IQ|4.0|These days more people, as we are commonly used to, end up one way or the  other in a mental hospital. Normally a fatal burnout on the job which  escalates gets you right in there. Yeah, i have seen a mental hospital from  inside some time ago. Watching Gothika, with this knowledge in mind, makes  the screen writer a winner from the start.    The actual result is quite good, but one senses that the movie team had to   catch the late night train to the Oscar elections in Vegas, before finishing   this movie. Certain things should have been given more detail. The really   fast ending was like pulling the power cord out of your DVD player while the   credit titles were still rolling.    The cast makes up 200% for this, especially Halle Berry of course. Now lets   try to compare Gothika to a real world mental hospital. Well it indeed all   matters if the director/warden is a good guy. If he's a bad ass, walking   around with gothik tattoo's displaying women in flames, the writers script   might not be a total unrealistic story.    Always keep in mind, and never forget this, i've been there, experienced it,  these medical dudes can juice you up with injections, any which way you don't  like. Seeing a occasional ghost do a fly-by ain't nothing in such a scenario.  Actually in the movie Penelope Cruz was given her monthly shot, after which  the &quot;devil&quot; with tattoo had his free ride in her cell.    Now to question why such a high profile casting was introduced in this movie?  I don't know. Maybe in a couple of years, if such FBI cases do exist and get  released in the open, we might know more.
0440213525|5.0|Once I started, I could not stop! I would read it again. Loved this one!!! It's a must read! From start to finish, Grisham layed out the guidelines for the stunning conclusion. That was all I read for two weeks. Never have I been so impressed.
B0000035E7|2.0|Now.. I'm not gonna be one-sided and say I totally adore this album just because Kurt Cobain is a great musician in his other music. I have to say that there are a lot of &quot;nothing&quot; songs on this album.  <br />  <br /> And I'm not gonna automatically say this is a great album just because its Nirvana and grunge and I totally understand the &quot;ethics and all the viewpoints of grunge&quot;.. because that's all bull crap. <br />  <br /> Now, About a Girl is probably the only great song on the album.. is has an awesome melody and good lyrics. Never gets boring. <br />  <br /> Some other songs come close to About a Girl's greatness... <br />  <br /> Blew- good melody, cool solo, nice sounding rythms. <br />  <br /> School- this song is cool.. with a &quot;hard&quot; sounding solo and slightly repetitive lyrics. <br />  <br /> Love Buzz- probably the second best song on the album. has a cachty melody and good guitaring. cover song, though. <br />  <br /> Swap Meet- another song thats okay on the ears. <br />  <br /> Mr. moustache- good guitar riff. and okay lyrics. <br />  <br /> Downer- fun to listen to. <br />  <br /> Other than these songs, the album is pretty boring. All in all this album is not that good... at all. But once you listen to it a lot and tell yourself, &quot;It's Kurt Cobain, though, this music can't be bad...&quot; it will start to grow on you.
B0001XAS2G|4.0|Since this album first appeared it has received extensive play and continues to this day to be heard in shopping malls, supermarkets and department stores. &quot;Time Passages&quot; and &quot;Song on the Radio&quot; have proved to be undaunted by time. Now in this &quot;tune up&quot; CD it is evident yet again that Al Stewart is a great genius, only partially recognized due to his mega hit &quot;Year of the Cat&quot; and this album. I recommend this work for it's fame and strongly suggest that you also purchase some of his earlier and more obscure works, especially the legendary &quot;Past, Present & Future&quot; (also available at Amazon.com on CD) and immerse yourself in the art of this great talent. Well worth your time and investment!
B00009V8Z9|5.0|'Chariot' by Gavin DeGraw is my CD of the year. I never tire of hearing that voice or those amazing lyrics, which is even more unreal when six months ago I had never even heard of him.  <br />Being British, seeing him live is impossible so my question is when the hell is he coming to the UK? I, for one will be first in line to see him.
6305949980|2.0|Loser(...)This one is definitely rotten to the core. You don't mix Holloween with Christmas! It is simply not done. Although, the songs were fun and creative. And, Danny Elfman has a nice, strong, deep voice.
B0001XAPX8|5.0|THE HUMAN STAIN met a mixed reaction when released in the theatres, possibly because the issues, which imbue this film with particular significance, got lost on the large screen that by nature concentrates on the BIG effect.  But on the DVD, viewed in the privacy of the home, the degrees of subtleties are more pronounced.  The indelible stain that birthright makes on our lives is examined in many facets in this adaptation of Philip Roth's rather sensational novel by the same name.  What effect does ethnicity have on molding our lives, what effect does the potential that inherited wealth will play on our view of the world, what effect can public prejudice as well as self-induced prejudice have on the way we process our adulthood roles?  This film addresses all of these issues: a Caucasian-appearing African American young man opts for costuming his life as a white Jewish scholar only to be dismissed from his professor's position because of a perceived 'racial slur' against absent black students; a young girl from a broken wealthy family sees through the vacuous existence when molested by a stepfather and runs into a life of poverty and personal tragedy desperately needing affection; a young writer becomes a recluse after the success of a first novel out of fear of flying; a visceral man enters madness induced by self-imposed exile.  Characters such as these put great demands on actors and it is very much to the credit of the screenwriter Nicholas Meyer and  director Robert Benton that the services of Sir Anthony Hopkins, Nicole Kidman, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris, and Wentworth Miller, Anna Deavere Smith along with a fine supporting cast were captured to bring pulsating life to this difficult intermixing of stories.  Watch this one several times for the varying aspects of success in acting, in dialogue, and in the beautiful cinematic effects achieved in this very worthwhile film.
1592400876|1.0|I'm the type of person who will point out misspellings or misusages of grammar. My friends are always irritated with me because of my oddity. This book...Dear God! Eats, Shoots & Leaves is quite possibly the worst book I've ever read. After I read House On Mango Street, I thought that surely there wasn't a book written worse than that. I stand corrected. Lynn Truss (the author) is obsessive and needs a cat or something. She's very repetetive in writing the book. She constantly repeats what she has previously said because THERE ISN'T THAT MUCH TO WRITE ABOUT A COMMA!!!! God help me. Unless you are required to read this book, as I was for AP English, I highly recommend you do not read this book. It is quite possible you will literally be bored to tears. Save your money. Save your time. Read Shakespeare.
B000002UAF|4.0|Of all The Beatles' early albums, this probably stands as the best and most grown up of them all. From that opening title rocker through classic tunes like 'I Should Have Known Better', 'Can't Buy Me Love', and 'You Can't Do That', it doesn't fail to keep our attention. <br />  <br /> The most amazing thing about this album is that for a movie soundtrack, it doesn't feel like a soundtrack at all, it just feels like any old Beatles album. The same goes for 'Help', but sadly not 'Magical Mystery Tour' or 'Yellow Submarine'. The most amazing thing is that the last 6 songs are all basically called left overs, but they feel just like a continuation of the album and don't feel forced on in any way. <br />  <br /> One of the main songs that this album introduced is &quot;pain&quot; for the first time. Although most early Beatles songs were about love in a way, this album started to introduce some slightly pained and desparate lyrics which would be built on with the next few albums. It's a good blend of early stuff with some of the bitterness of the later stuff, and shows The Beatles at one of the best points in their careers.
B000286S8S|3.0|They get a star per syllable. As for the CD, the first mistake is Rhino records. I could be wrong, but someone name at least two major &quot;ACTIVELY RECORDING&quot; artists putting out CDs on Rhino. Not trying to diss the label. They have put out some nice Slow Jams, Lowrider, Old School, and Funk compilations that I have purchased, but for Van Halen, this is a mismatch. That being said, did the band actually have a say so in the selection of material for this CD? I've read in a few magazines about how Eddie has always hated the Diver Down CD as well as having to do showtune type material and remakes of other people's songs. This is a &quot;Best Of...&quot; CD. Are you telling me Beautiful Girls and Dancing in the Streets are suppose to be on par with Ain't Talking About Love, I'll Wait, the Title track or Runaround? Another thing to notice is that Van Halen has already put out a live CD. If you are going to include Live tracks on this compilation they should be songs that we DO NOT already have. (Try Summer Nights, Baluchitherium, Mean Street etc.) <br />  <br /> Oh and speaking of Mean Street, where is that song on this collection? Oh, and Mean Street brings up another point. Where is ED? I mean that to say, this collection is missing what use to be a thrill for those guitarists who rushed to get the new VH CD. Did Ed put anything special on there? Where are the interludes, those special moments on a VH CD. Where are Spanish Fly, Little Guitars, and of course 315? These are important elements in the Soul of Van Halen. You could even put Doin' Time in there for Alex.  <br />  <br /> I also see a falure to include much of anything from Balance and nothing from VH III. Like one of the other reviewers mentioned, don't try to act like Gary Cerone didn't exist. True I didn't buy the CD, but I heard and liked Fire in the Hole and I remember another song they had out was somewhat of a hit from that CD as well. Also I hear Ed sang lead on one track. (actually, scratch that last addition. This should be the best of.)  <br />  <br /> The packaging is also not what is should be. Frankenstien colors should be on the disc. Put the bands symbol on the outside. That way it looks like I'm getting a CD of the band. When I see the CD, that's the heart. Someone tell me, are there pictures of the band in the jacket? Are there song lyrics? Is there a story written inside on the history of the band?  <br />  <br /> This is a Best of CD, right? Well give me your best. Where's the Soul of the band? They started a club (now owned by Sammy) in Cabo. Where is Cabo Wabo on this collection? Don't tell Me was the first big single from Balance. Where is that? Ice Cream Man--a staple on Classic Rock stations across the country--is missing. As previously mentioned, where are the solos. Also, where are the unreleased and bonus tracks often found in overseas releases of CD or on sountracks or sitting on the cutting room floor. Add these instead of live tracks. Leave the live stuff for the DVD which should be your next plan.  <br />  <br /> Van Halen has been on hiatus prettymuch since '97. (Sorry Gary) In the end, from my view Sammy won the fight. He saw his daughter's birth, he had and still has a successful career w/o VH and they released a double CD of hits.(all things brought out in the open by both parties during the fight.) Sam won. Now that you all are back together, YOU REALLY OWE YOUR FANS for fighting over silly crap. Be about the music.  <br />  <br /> I think they need to spend a little more time together, get that feeling back. From the sound of the new songs it's not quite there yet. After this point come out with a best of set that truly represent Van Halen and the fans of Van Halen who've stuck with this band through 4 decades. I may not have the age to have been around for all of them but I know, those who have are expecting a little more that what's been presented here.  <br />  <br /> Oh and speaking of that, if VH should decide to put outanother DVD, spare us the reunion concert. Call a guitarist you trashed in an early issue of Guitar World. The Led Zeppelin DVD is how it should be done.  <br />  <br /> I didn't buy the Best of Volume I for the same reason I didn't get this one. There are too many mistakes. This isn't about not being able to please all the fans. Sure, that is something which will happen, but you have to think of what things, simple things, should be included. Nothing I've mentioned, should be to difficult to think of. This collection should almost be a gift to the fans.  <br />  <br /> I miss being thrilled by Van Halen. I know it can happen again, they just have to be about the music and hit us with it again. Give the fans something they will want to buy, not download. Package it right and put the Soul in it.

0793518326|5.0|I'm really at a loss to explain how some people are complaining about this book.  <br /> If you could only own one book of sheet music, this HAS to be your choice. The most important music of the 20th century, note-for-note.  <br /> The dead-on vocal arrangements alone make it worth the money. Get a couple friends together and try singing the intro to Nowhere Man...you won't believe the results.  <br /> The guitar tab and sheet music are phenomenal as well.  <br /> And as for all the &quot;flaws&quot; that people keep complaing about in their reviews: i need specifics! Because i haven't found a single one. Maybe Revolution 9, but who's trying to play that anyway?  <br /> I searched through the reviews looking for a single specific example of an error, and all i came up with was someone mentioning &quot;No Reply&quot;, and how the chords were all wrong. Sorry buddy, your &quot;trained ear&quot; is flat-out wrong! They've got it exactly right. The minor chords don't come in till the &quot;i saw the light!&quot; section, just as it is notated.  <br /> If you buy this book, you are getting the songs exactly as the Beatles played them. Period.  <br /> Is the book too small? No. It may not be optimal for putting on a piano or a music stand, but thats not how these songs should be played anyway. MEMORIZE them and then perform them. The Beatles never performed with sheet music (they couldn't even read sheet music!) and neither should you. <br /> Besides, this book is 1136 pages! If it were enlarged any more most people probably couldn't even lift its weight.
0735619670|5.0|Code Complete 1 completely changed the way I wrote programs in the mid 90s. Reading CC1 made me realize that I was still an amateur programmer and reading it marked the beginning of my career as a professional programmer. In more recent years, much as I liked CC1, the book began to show its age, and the examples especially started to look dated. <br /> <br />I pre-ordered CC2 and have spent the past 2 weeks devouring its contents. CC2 does not disappoint. McConnell has once again distilled his insights into a practical handbook that should be on every software development professional?s bookshelf. <br /> <br />CC2 provides numerous benefits: it?s a complete software-construction reference. It provides dozens of checklists. And it contains no hype. It?s valuable to beginning programmers, team leads, and technically oriented managers. The tone is conversational with just the right amount of humor. Throughout the book, it?s clear that Steve has ?been there, done that.? Thank you Steve!!! <br />
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Moulin Rouge, completely unexpectedly, became my favorite movie when I saw it for the first time a couple of years ago. I'm not a huge fan of musical theatre so it was not a reaction I would have predicted. At the time, I never wrote an on-line review because I frankly didn't think I could do my ideas about the film justice in a short review. Thankfully, I have just discovered a review that does do this historic film the justice it deserves. The one by David Bruce.  <br />  <br /> What it is that I find both culturally significant and technically brilliant is that in this movie Baz Luhrmann subverts the postmodern superfice by using visual and tonal simulacra, playfulness, parody, performance and boundary/genre conflation to point not to the superficiality and relativity of all points of view but, instead, to sing a love song that strikes the viewer as eternal--almost as if the love story itself is a Platonic form or Luhrmann believes that these two souls were destined to yearn for completion in relationship with each other. Even amidst a postmodern culture industry that glorifies pleasure without context, sexploitation and equates the power to consume with the power to prevail, Christian, an Orphean hero, is able to transform Satine with his earnest-- almost naive--idealism, romanticism and humanity. Satine, for her part, is able to channel the solo pilgrim's energies away from an unwitting narcissism towards connection, relationship and mutuality (at the beginning of the movie, Christian yearns for poverty in a world where most people have no choice over the matter and sets out to write about &quot;Truth&quot;, &quot;Beauty&quot; and &quot;Love&quot; though he probably has not allowed himself to experience any of those things in the flesh before meeting Satine). Satine teaches Christian how to freely give of himself because her love for him has taught her that while she is accustomed to giving of herself to men, true dignity in love is mutual--she learns that shecan and should be loved in return. In short, Christian learns to love another person and not simply his idealizations of and musings on love and Satine finally learns to love herself apart from the jewels and her commercialized sexual appeal.  <br />  <br /> To tell such a love story is not postmodern. To add spiritual depth to electric visuals is certainly not postmodern. Luhrmann is subverting the shallowness of such exploitative fare as &quot;Sex and the City&quot; and &quot;Queer as Folk&quot;, which too often present the superfice (corporate consumerism) not as an underworld but, instead, as a profane paradise where persons can be free from the shackles of &quot;oppressive&quot; ideas about love and substance. This movie represents a revolt. In short, this movie makes you want to fall in love--not go out to the mall and shop for the material props of the fragmented, postmodern self.
B000002LCI|5.0|I love Depeche Mode and each song is amazing! Of course, one of the best is &quot;Strangelove&quot;!!
B0000214F2|1.0|This claimed to be a movie about non-conformity. In reality, viewers are forced to side with Robin Williams or they cannot enjoy the movie. I felt as though I were compelled to like Williams' role simply because he was the 'good guy' and appropriate music played to heighten the feel of Patch Adams against the Evil Establishment. Isn't that conformity? <br /> There was only one side to this story: Patch Adams' own version of things; he was right and those who opposed him were wrong and true villains. I have nothing against Robin Williams in this- it's simply that the movie was paltry, one sided, cheesy, tacky, and insulting. Insulting to me as a viewer who DOES NOT want to hear that &quot;serious doctors are evil doctors&quot;; who DOES NOT need the point hammered home with every line, and accompanying music in case I missed the point that Patch Adams was the GOOD one;  <br /> and frightening to me as a maybe-someday patient, with the impending prospect of being woken in the middle of the night by a clown who just has to make me laugh one time before I die, to satisfy his own ego.  <br /> There was one scene where Patch Adams was angry at god and on the verge of jumping from a cliff, and he turned around and there was a butterfly on his bag. Suddenly, Patch Adams was not angry anymore. In fact, he laughed out loud joyously and the camera panned away to show a majestic cliff scene complete with triumphant music, the flying butterfly, and a suddenly happy Patch standing there loving life again.  <br /> I understand symbols and metaphors, but since this didn't make an iota of sense to me, I wonder if I missed a scene or two. I wish I'd missed all the scenes, it would have been so much better.  <br />  <br /> I could go on forever about how insulting it was, but I've spent far too much time on this movie as it is. I don't normally review but I thought that I should try and save others from the same fate.
B00005JN2F|4.0|I was in the theater just an hour ago with a little smile on my face as the credits rolled. I could sit here and gush about how much I enjoyed the film, but that wouldn't be much of a review, would it?  Poor Jason Bourne. He just wants to be left alone. But he is a man of his word, and makes good on the threat he made at the end of the last film. And now...poor everyone else.  Why do I like this film so much? Because Matt Damon once again makes the Jason Bourne character so BELIEVABLE. No over-the-top showboating we've seen so many times, ad nauseam. Jason Bourne bleeds, sweats, and feels emotion. He spares us those silly punchlines we've heard in other movies after he dispatches another ersatz assassin, and continues about his business without looking over his shoulder. No wasted movement, no sloppiness, no unnecessary timeouts he can't afford to take. Can I even tell you how refreshing that is? Not that I want them to milk this franchise for all it's worth, but I certainly enjoy what's been done with the character so far.  Ok, there must be something wrong with the movie, right? So, here's my one and only complaint: I know this

B00003CXTG|1.0|'Pearl Harbor', released in 2001 is a tale spun around the events that formed Pearl Harbor. It centers around two childhood friends, Rafe McCrawley and Danny Walker, who join the army as pilots to fulfill their childhood dreams of flying. Rafe meets the lovely Evelyn shortly before he applies for a transfer to the RAF to fly out and battle the Germans over London. Danny and Evelyn, meanwhile are both transferred to Pearl Harbor in the summer of 1941. The news of Rafe's death in England stuns them both and in their grief, they turn to each other for help and support. But when Rafe turns up alive, both of them must face conflicting emotions which are interrupted as the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor occurs December 7th, 1941.  <br /> <br /> The story is a hopeless romance, but in reality, has little to do with the actual Pearl Harbor. Historical accuracy is so-so. The names of most of the nurses are accurate, but Rafe and Danny are obsolete to the time. \\"Dorie\\" Miller was a real character, but his family history and background have been added for effect. The actions of Rafe and Danny during the attack are clearly based on the real life actions of pilots Ken Taylor and George Welch; it is possible that Red's personality is also based on a real life character. The RAF, as far as I can tell, actually existed, so it is possible that Rafe might have been transferred there. But the color of the Japanese planes that attacked Pearl Harbor were silver with red suns, not green, and the idea that a fighter pilot might somehow get put in a mission with a bunch of bombers is somewhat ridiculous. Marital relations before actual marriage were considered preposterous at the time. Two other things to consider concerning the 40's is #1 everyone smoked and all the time, and #2 it appears that practically everyone had a nickname aside from their regular name.  <br />   <br /> In short, the movie really has no merit to being called \\"Pearl Harbor\\". Only one hour of the three hour movie isdedicated to the actual attack, the rest is fluff. Aside from the actual battle, the story trends toward boring and monotonous. Real characters are never quite fully developed, real life problems fail to be dealt with, and many of the lines could be called corny. If you want to really understand Pearl Harbor, I recommend you check out Tora! Tora! Tora! Despite the fact that the special effects are somewhat lacking compared to today's standards, they were impressive in their day when the movie was made. More importantly, it brings to light a real, more truthful understanding of the day and place without the added styrofoam. If you are admittedly a romantic, then you would probably be better off with the book by Randall Wallace. The movie is basically the novel with the good parts taken out.

B0002KQNJU|5.0|This film is wonderful, a true classic, and I'm glad to see that it is finally being released on dvd.<br /><br />Polanski set out to make a spooky, spoofy fairy tale and he fully succeeded. The production values are excellent. Visually the film is dazzling, it is full of breathtaking snowscapes and eerie, elaborate sets. The music score by  Polish jazz composer Christopher Komeda (who also scored Polanski's Rosemary's Baby, and Knife in the Water) is the best ever composed for a horror film. Full of soaring, wailing voices Komeda?s spooky score sets the tone of the film marvelously.<br /><br />The cast is great, especially Jack MacGowran and Polanski as the bumbling vampire killers. British character actor Ferdy Mayne is a wonderful vampire count, and Sharon Tate is beautiful and funny as the dizzy heroine, Sarah.<br /><br />This will be a delight for all viewers who are cool enough to appreciate the film's unique charm. It is (as one would expect of Polanski) definitely a one-of-a-kind jewel, and successful on every level.<br /><br />I love the cover art. I'm glad to see they are using the cool cartoon from the film's original poster and ad campaign. Good for Warners.

B00003CWTI|4.0|Well, I can't bring myself to give this one five stars, for a couple of reasons.  I didn't like the occasional lapses into sentimentality and I didn't appreciate Anderson's unnecessary insertion of a biblical subtext.  However this is on the whole a massive, ambitious, funny, imaginative, and unusual film and surely is among the best of '99(of course, it is part of a group of very good pictures from that year which did not receive best picture nominations - the others include Eyes Wide Shut, Being John Malkovich, and Fight Club).  There are some very fine performances (Philip Seymour Hoffman, Tom Cruise, Julianne Moore, Philip Baker Hall, John C. Reilly ) and a few subpar ones(Jeremy Blackman and that coke-sniffing girl).  It does manage to be captivating through its entire running time, and the frogs are cool even if they are biblical.  It is also a directorial triumph for P.T. Anderson, who impressed many critics with 'Boogie Nights' but seems to have truly forged a style of his own with 'Magnolia.' If anythingm this is a masterpiece of editing technique, one that would make Robert Altman proud, with its complex intermingling of a gigantic cast.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|What a fantastic and unique album. My favorite tracks are &quot;Time is Running Out&quot; with its insightful lyrics about an addictive relationship and &quot;Butterflies and Hurricanes&quot;, an optimistic ode about having the strength to do your best. Best of all though is &quot;Endlessly&quot;, the melody and the plaintive vocals are the perfect complement to the lyrics about hopeless infatuation. A must purchase! <br />
B000002LUB|5.0|After the Black Sabbath albums with Ozzy that are great in their own right this was almost impossible to fill his shoes. However Dio did a great job and put the band on the whole new level. The Heaven and Hell album had a feel that was absent from the Black Sabbath albums for a long time: full of fantasy imagery, meaningful lyrics and a killer sound that is relevant (at least for me up to this day). After Geezer Butler visited one of the Dio concerts in the 1990 and a few beers together they (rightfully) thought that the Dio-fronted Sabbath had to offer a lot more than they accomplished. Iommi supported the suggestion and the reunion took place. Unfortunately the album is the only one we got from the reunion. The bottom line: it is a bone-crunching dark and hard as f&^*k rock. For this one Dio chanded his usual Dragons/Dungeons lyrics style and turned to describe the modern dangers of different nature - that he continues up to today - check his most recent CD's title track - Killing the Dragon. The album is a solid effort - pity that this did not last and the band turned to the reunion with Ozzy. He is a great frontman but there is (in my opinion) a zero chance to get a new studio album from the reunited Sabbath apart from live albums full of rehashing the 20-years old stuff. So it's not a great surprise that Iommi is pushing forward the solo career by releasing(hopefully) the 8th star butlegs and a brand new solo album. There is a new album in the works also from Geezer and Bill also. But as far as I can think the Dio-Butler-Iommi-Appice Dehumanizer is the last great Sabbath that was released.

1400032717|4.0|This book is a great read. It is plot-driven (a mystery novel of sorts), a fine character study, and a page-turner; I couldn't put it down.   <br />   It's a book within a book: The plot is an autistic boy writing a mystery novel. Within the novel, his life is interwoven. Christopher, the narrator, can not &quot;imagine&quot; what can not be, as he says, and can write only what he knows and experiences. So within his book we get his life, as well as his teacher's comments about this very book we're reading. As well, we feel his relationship to her -- all well done. Each character -- Christopher, his teacher and each of his parents are all very well-drawn characters (a marvelous narrative feat given the confines of Christopher's emotional abilities).   <br />   While I wouldn't go as far as to use the word heartbreaking, I would say I truly felt for Christopher. I was with him. I understood him. My heart raced, and I laughed.   <br />   Another reviewer wrote that this book accomplished something Steve Martin attempted to in &quot;The Pleasure of My Company.&quot; I thought that was quite an astute and accurate comment.    <br />   The book is not perfect, but extremely entertaining, and a great look into this boy's interesting mind. Through him, without his knowing, the reader understands others' responses to him.    <br />   There are some things that Christopher, the character, wrote that I am still thinking about while reading a different book. His thoughts were that interesting to me. There is one particular diagetic break in 'realism' with respect to his autistic way of thinking that I wish weren't there, as the book is otherwise internally consistent and beautifully realistic. (It's a novel, not science.)   <br />   Aside: I, too, as another reviewer wrote, have worked with autistic children. I can't say I knew any like Christopher but I do see from where this book comes. Haddon, as well, as his bio states, worked with autistic children. So - it's well-informed. I recommend!

Peter Weir did a superb job capturing 1805 <br /> British navy life, except only for the very &quot;simplistic&quot; <br /> captions introducing viewers to the &quot;era&quot; and Napoleon. What else could he do, though? The film has enough twists and turns to <br /> hold your attention, though a &quot;dark tale&quot;. I enjoyed &quot;Russell <br /> Crowe's performance as &quot;Captain Jack Aubrey&quot;...he actually &quot;becomes&quot; Aubrey, and if you enjoy watching Russell's <br /> performances in other films, this will not disappoint you. <br /> The cast was &quot;fabulous&quot;, I actually felt like I was on board the <br /> &quot;Surprise&quot;. The DVD has &quot;great sound&quot; which seems to surround you as you view the film, at times I could hear the ship &quot;creaking&quot; and looked around the room, not knowing where the sound was coming from. I love films about frigates,and sailing ships. I also own a copy of &quot;Damn the Defiant&quot; which starred Sir Alec Guiness, this film is &quot;comparable&quot;. My only complaint was the &quot;end&quot;, but I think Weir did that purposely.... <br /> If you like Russell Crowe, and good adventure movies this one is GREAT! The&quot;extras&quot; are fun too,and the music is wonderful!
B00003CXTG|5.0|This is the best movie. So what if it's not completely historically accurate? So what if it's more a love story than fighting? That's a good thing. In my opinion, there is a lot of fighting. I guess guys may not like the romance part, but I loved it. Plus Josh Harnett is really hot.
B000002KB8|4.0|Heavy metal begins here. Period. Not Hendrix, not Zeppelin, not the Who (as good as they all were). About the only other contendor for this honour would be &quot;Deep Purple In Rock&quot; and even that is not as heavy as this first Sabbath tome. <br />  <br /> Four lads from inner-city Birmingham: <br /> TONY IOMMI - He has been called the inventor of heavy metal guitar and I don't dispute that. This guy is amazing, especially considering that two of the fingers on his fretting hand are mangled. Like it or not, Sabbath are and always have been his band. <br />  <br /> GEEZER BUTLER - Probably the best to ever take a four-string, plug it in and play it LOUD. His nimble bass lines are probably only equalled by his contemporary, Chris Squire of Yes, and have influenced many bassists, not least Steve Harris of Iron Maiden. <br />  <br /> BILL WARD - He has said that he's &quot;not a drummer&quot;. Debatable, but I see his point. He's more of a free-form percussionist (with lots of jazz influences) than a tight &quot;in the pocket&quot; John Bonham-style drummer. Very underated. <br />  <br /> OZZY OSBOURNE - Yes, I saved him for last, and for one simple reason: he's not really a musician (harmonica on &quot;The Wizard&quot; aside) or lyricist (Geezer handled that) and to me he cannot sing (I much prefer the vocals of Sabbath's later singers, especially R.J. Dio). Having said that, his personality is an indispensible part of the history of heavy metal. <br />  <br /> The album was recorded over the period of just a couple of days so what you hear here is what you get! No overprocessing, no Pro Tools, just the lads essentially playing what they played for audiences in every corner of Britain and Europe. <br />  <br /> &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; - The creepiest track in HM history. The rain, the bells, the &quot;Oh, please God help me!&quot; from Ozzy, the sinister three-note guitar riff...still sends chills down my spine almost 40 years later. <br />  <br /> &quot;The Wizard&quot; - Some loose, jazzy influence here and Ozzy on harmonica. Still quite heavy though, thanks to Iommi's cutting guitar. <br />  <br /> &quot;Behind The Wall Of Sleep&quot; - A little tighter (hints of greatness to come on the next two albums). Segues into &quot;Bassically&quot; which is Geezer demonstrating his four-string wizardry. <br />  <br /> &quot;N.I.B.&quot; - One of the Sabs' most misunderstood songs. Geezer has said it's about the Devil &quot;totally changing his nature, becoming a good person and falling in love with a human being.&quot; Widely (and incorrectly) rumoured to stand for &quot;Nativity In Black.&quot; The truth is that it was called &quot;NIB&quot; because Bill Ward's beard looked like a pen nib and the band couldn't think of anything else to call it! Indeed, the band have long (wrongly) been labelled as Satanic, starting with the record company putting a gatefold including an inverted cross in the original pressing of this album. <br />  <br /> &quot;Wicked World&quot; - More jazzy influences, starting out with Wardy tapping his hi-hat in swing style. Nice clean fingerstyle guitar interlude from Iommi. Indeed a multi-talented guitarist. <br />  <br /> &quot;A Bit Of Finger/Wasp/Sleeping Village&quot; - Starts out with some good classical fingerstyle (the &quot;bit of finger&quot;) from Iommi. Extends into jamming typical of bands of the period. Listen closely and you'll hear a Jew's-harp (played by Ozzy?) under the classical opening. I still haven't figured out where &quot;Wasp&quot; fits in. <br />  <br /> &quot;Warning&quot; - One of only two cover songs recorded by Sabbath, a slower blues-rock piece originally by Aynsley Dunbar's (ace drummer later of Journey, Jefferson Starship and Whitesnake) Retaliation, driven mostly by Geezer's bass. Again extended jamming, including some unaccompanied '50s-style guitar boogie. <br />  <br /> Some pressings have &quot;Evil Woman&quot; instead of &quot;Wicked World&quot; - Sabbath's other coversong (by '60s band The Crows). Kind of a curiosity but pales next to their original material. <br />  <br /> This is indeed a necessary document in the history of heavy metal. Doesn't quite get five stars because of the occasional disjointedness and Ozzy's voice.
B0001XPY1G|5.0|At last, a definitive collection of music from the Jacksons!!! All the songs come from their Motown and Epic albums which will not disappoint since they were all great songs. Only available as an import this is far superior to their domestic release &quot;The Essential Jacksons.&quot; Enjoy the music!!!
038551123X|5.0|Jeff Lindsay's first novel is gruesome but fascinating in a Silence-of-the-Lambs sort of way (the narrator, who is trying to catch the serial killer, is himself a serial killer). Dexter is a blood-spatter technician with the Miami PD, a perfect job for someone who cuts live people up as a hobby, I suppose!      Relative to Hannibal, Dexter is actually fairly likeable, and the reader finds him/herself strangely &quot;on Dexter's side&quot; as he simultaneously admires and tries to find the killer.       Lindsay has a real knack for plotting; the book moves very swiftly. The end result is the best thriller in ages, and I'm sure we'll see more of Dexter in sequels very soon.
B000000WCA|5.0|Spice doesn't need to be original to be entertaining, no do the Spice Girls need to be good singers. It just has to be executed well, and the innocuous dance-pop of Spice is infectious. None of the Girls have great voices, but they do exude personality and charisma, which is what drives bouncy dance-pop like &quot;Wannabe,&quot; with its ridiculous &quot;zig-a-zig-ahhh&quot; hook, into pure pop guilty pleasure. What is surprising is how the sultry soul of &quot;Say You'll Be There&quot; is more than just a guilty pleasure, and how ballads like &quot;2 Become 1&quot; are perfect adult contemporary confections. The rest of the album isn't quite as catchy as those first three singles, but it is still an irresistible, immaculately crafted pop that gets by on the skills of the producer and the charisma of the five Spices. Sure, the last half of the album is forgettable, but it sounds good while it's on, which is the key to a good dance-pop record. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, All Music Guide
B00019PDKC|5.0|This is another successful addition to the Anathema discography, in the same vein as &quot;Alternative 4&quot; and &quot;A Fine Day to Exit&quot; (not as much &quot;Judgement,&quot; even though that came out in between those) with its pianos and keyboards, and softer style songs. Anathema has been so far away from metal for a so long that I shouldn't even have to say this album isn't metal at all. Sure, some parts might be pretty heavy, but I still consider it heavier rock rather than metal. This album is very good but I still consider all 3 albums mentioned earlier better personally. And as always, Anathema?s lyrics are impressive.<br /><br /> It starts off calmly with &quot;Harmonium,&quot; which slowly gets heavier, and is mostly a basic song? then comes &quot;Balance&quot; which kind of does the same thing. Here's the best part: Balance stops very suddenly and a new melody is introduced but seems like part of the same song. It starts off &quot;Closer.&quot; This song is really cool; I don't know what it is that makes it so catchy and stuck in my head all the time. It has some very unique &quot;robotic&quot; vocals, and a very catchy melody with drums that keep building up. It is one of the few songs, on any CDs that I sometimes play 3-4 times in a row when listening to the CD. It?s definitely my favorite on the album. &quot;Are you There&quot; is a very emotional song, some may say it's melodramatic or cheesy, but it's not too much. It has prominent keyboards and Danny on vocals. &quot;Childhood Dream&quot; is a short but sweet instrumental, very melancholy and nostalgic. &quot;Pulled Under at 2000 Metres a second&quot; starts off with a very fast tempo, foreshadowing that it's going to be a relatively heavy song, and it definitely is. It contains awesome vocal melodies, guitar riffs, and lyrics. &quot;A Natural Disaster&quot; has nice female vocals and a very melancholy mood. &quot;Flying&quot; has amazing vocals and is emotional to the level of &quot;Are you There.&quot; &quot;Electricity&quot; gets stuck in my head a lot? a peaceful piano melody with Danny's vocals. &quot;Violence&quot; is a lengthy, beautiful, elaborate instrumental. It starts off with a delicate piano melody that keeps blossoming and changing, and leads into some suspenseful guitars, adding heavier guitars, faster drumming and ethereal sounds along the way, which then fades out to reveal even more graceful piano playing. The latter half of this song is very sparse. Every keystroke seems so perfect, it seems like the ideal song to stare at the stars to, but that's getting too cheesy.<br /><br /> Anathema has practically detached themselves from metal at this point, and they are good at what they do now. I'm not one of those people that is so disappointed when a metal band completely changes: it's usually for the better.u There.&quot; &quot;Electricity&quot; gets stuck in my head a lot? a peaceful piano melody with Danny's vocals. &quot;Violence&quot; is a lengthy, beautiful, elaborate instrumental.

B000000WFF|4.0|The Spice Girls, as well as their managers and songwriters, are nothing if not clever, and Spiceworld, the group's second album, illustrates exactly how sharp they are. Conventional wisdom dictates that Spiceworld should be a weak fascimile of Spice, which itself featured a handful of great singles surrounded by filler. Conventional wisdom, in this case, is wrong -- Spiceworld is a better record than its predecessor, boasting a more consistent (and catchier) set of songs and an intoxicating sense of fun. Instead of merely rewriting Spice, Spiceworld consolidates and expands the group's style, adding Latin flourishes (&quot;Spice Up Your Life&quot;), kitschy blues (&quot;The Lady Is a Vamp&quot;) and stomping, neo-Motown blue-eyed soul in the vein of Culture Club (&quot;Stop&quot;). The girls -- Mel C. in particular -- are actually turning into good vocalists, and each song plays to their strengths, giving each Spice a chance to shine. Best of all, each song has a strong melody and a strong, solid beat, whether it's a ballad or a dance number. It's a pure, unadulterated guilty pleasure and some of the best manufactured mainstream dance-pop of the late '90s. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, All Music Guide
B0000A1RJI|5.0|This is a very fun Soundtrack from a very fun movie. Its lack of orchestral depth and overuse of similar chords and rythms is forgivaeble here becuase it really is fun. A soundtrack that can be appreciated by more than movie or classical music fans.
B00028U6B8|5.0|&quot;Volunteers&quot; is the last 60's album The Jefferson Airplane recorded and what a classic it is. Merging folk and psychedic sounds, The Jefferson Airplane had a unique sound to say the least. &quot;Volunteers&quot; was full of well crafted songs such as &quot;We Can Be Together&quot;, &quot;Wooden Ships&quot; (also recorded by Crosby, Stills and Nash), the honkytonkish &quot;The Farm&quot; and the anti-establishment tune &quot;Volunteers&quot; to name a few. Guest artists include Nicky Hopkins on piano, Steven Stills on Hammond Organ, David Crosby (no mention of what instrument he played but I'm assuming it's guitar) and Jerry Garcia on pedel steel guitar This remastered edition of &quot;Volunteers&quot; also includes five excellent bonus tracks, &quot;Good Shepahrd&quot;, &quot;Somebody To Love&quot;, &quot;Plastic Fantastic Lover&quot;, &quot;Wooden Ships&quot; and &quot;Volunteers&quot; all recorded &quot;live&quot; at The Fillmore East November 28th and 29th, 1969. An excellent cd anyway you look at it.
B0001XWV0S|5.0|This unrated version of the movie contains excellent bonus material on DVD including an extensive director's commentary, deleted scenes, and a menu choice to view the nude scenes of the movie only.  The movie is justly famous for the precision and clarity with which female breasts are photographed.  According to the director's commentary, this unrated edition differs from the theatrical release in at least the graduation party hot-tub scene, where evidently in the theater the actress was not topless when Cooper jumps in the tub.<br /><br />True to its genre as an example of kind of Jugendfahrenheitverbildungsroman, the film offers excellent glimples into middle americans attitudes towards europeans: England is exemplified by soccer hooligans and Paris is typified by a robot street performer.  Only the introduction of a gay Italian seems to cut against accepted archtypes.
B0000C9JFO|4.0|This movie is quite an expected treat in that it chronicles the lives of a group of young adults who make you smile, dream, and possibly reminisce about having the opportunity to think and play without the restrictions of official adulthood. The root of the comedy, which mostly takes place in a group apartment, centers on both universal commonalities and cultural differences in an increasingly ethnically integrated Barcelona. Don't let this introduction make you think that the movie is an overtly political statement on cultural integration, as it is a simple celebration of how funny or annoying different cultures can be to those who don't really understand the subtle or sometimes huge differences that is engrained in all of us. The beauty if that it pokes fun at every culture in a loving fashion while letting us in of the lives of some very colorful people. It even suggests that we not only have much to learn from others, but that it may be so much more interesting and fulfilling to be around people who can push your buttons and that ultimately community is about people coming together because they chose to.<br /><br />The movie opens with a hyperkinetic pace and editing tricks that lets you know that it's not going to be your stereotypical run of the mill foreign film. You could call it a coming of age film, but it's one that is not targeted at solely kids as it feels very universal and timeless. The movie is acted with zest and every single character is well-tended to by the writer. Even though all the characters are not immediately likable, you wind up loving the group and wanting their time together not to end and maybe for you to have the opportunity of living with them if only for a while.<br /><br />Even if you are not generally a fan of foreign films, you may want to gives this one a chance as it is intoxicating and certainly made me want to go back in time for a few years and have the opportunity to have been exposed to such diversity instead of the homogeneity that surrounds/surrounded most of us. I recommend this movie to almost anyone and especially to those in college who may only see the serious side of living in another country. The ending, which I won't give away, seems to have gotten the Hollywood treatment, but it's not a deal-breaker. The movie easily earns 4 stars and I would not be surprised if the director and many of the secondary characters find as much professional success as Audrey Tautou of Amelie has found. Warning: If you are only going to see the movie to Audrey, you may be disappointed as her role is important yet very small. The movie's marketing team has put her in the middle of all advertising campaigns and right smack in the center of the DVD box, so you may think that the movie centers around her and it just is not the case. She is cute and it's great to see her playing a character that is not entirely lovable as she quickly sheds Amelie.ogeneity that surrounds/surrounded most of us.

B0001MDP3G|2.0|I love the movie Gettysburg, but couldn't stand this movie. The trailer sold it as a romance between Nicole Kidman's patrician character and Jude Law's humble character, but the movie features violent scene after violent scene. The violence is not on the battlefield, but between those who remain in town and prey on women left on isolated homesteads, and those hunting down deserters from the army to kill them. I wouldn't have minded violent battle scenes, but the rape and torture of townspeople seemed gratuitous. There are better movies out there to see.
0140131558|5.0|Auster is a word detective -- clever, sometimes too clever -- but he's at his most witty and inventive in this early trilogy. This is the set of books that turned me on to Auster, and led me to Book of Illusions, Oracle Night and In the Country of Last Things. Challenging reading in a highly entertaining manner. His writings reinforce my belief in the power of words, and bring to mind -- for various reasons -- writers such as Nabakov, Fowles and Jack O'Connell. A genuine original. The fact that I can't recall the specifics of this trilogy hardly matters. What I remember is the feeling of reading something new, or rather something old written in a new way. Hearing Auster's name always brings to mind the term &quot;linguistics,&quot; which to me is the shortest yet most descriptive term for characterizing both Auster the writer and his collective body of work.
B0001DI0FI|3.0|The plot is not amazing, but I enjoyed imagining what it would be like to live on an old-tyme ship like Russell Crowe's character. The ship was completely recreated and sailed for its scenes. There are a couple very dramatic scenes of sea rescue a la Titanic, and interesting battle scenes. For the ladies out there: Crowe looks great in tight riding pants with his hair pulled into a long ponytail! A good movie, but not a favorite.
1559408855|1.0|only 2 minutes ago, i saw this movie being bought at the price of 872$ on ebay, and i couldnt believe my eyes!!!!!!!!!! the seller bought two copies from amazon.com 5 years ago by paying 30$ for each , kept one to himself and the second one just stayed untouched waiting for years in a shelf as the seller described so...what makes it unique is that it is still factory sealed and it has the white ring with 29 chapters... <br />anyway my concern is why does criterion let this happen? why dont they reprint the movie and sell it? why do you let people earn money in this way?? i dont want to pay more than its original price of 30$...and i want the original one with the white ring not a bootleg copy...so hear my voice criterion and dont let people become rich through this movie, stop this nonsense
B0001VWP8I|5.0|American Radio. . . . WAKE-UP!!!!! This is Anastacia 3rd CD release on a major record label and the American music industry will not promote or God forbid play Anastacia. Anastacia rocks out on her 3rd self titled release. This woman is amazing! We could have done without &quot;Sexy Single&quot; (?Get Ready?, the bonus track on the ?Left Outside Alone? single would have been a better choice), but the other 11 tracks are great. I only hope that Epic is only waiting to release this CD in that States for a time when they can properly promote Anastacia. Her talents to are too amazing to continue to go unknown in North America
B0001AP12G|5.0|What does it take to legitimize an acclaimed producer in the release of his own rap album? To gain that respect, he must be more than just a notoriously good-bad singer, have an affiliation with the Roc-A-Fella Family, and the reputation of having produced hits all over today's charts. Thus the story begins for Kanye West's debut project, The College Dropout, an album that leaps marginally beyond distinction in its endeavors at innovation; new pathways are now possible for both the conscious and street corner heads that previously didn't know where this rap game was headed.  <br />  <br /> Lyrically, West is simply more adept at MC warfare than other mic grabbing producers such as Mannie Fresh and Pete Rock. West introspectively waves at thematically diverse topics, tendered by a poetic flow that pays homage to his own innate hip-hop infatuation. West's approach is simply cerebral; his verse remains in tempo, yet stays varied preventing monotony. His witty punchlines are slapstick, yet unabrasive. In addition, West appeals to a broad based listener group through The College Dropout's guest artists, from Syleena Johnson's soul gripping &quot;All Falls Down,&quot; to Talib Kweli and Common on the bass heavy banger &quot;Get Em High.&quot; <br />  <br /> To its advantage, the album is conceptually uncalculated, and simply impossible to trace along a straight line. From chick-chasing on BlackPlanet to religious identity conflict, The College Dropout runs threadfulls in obscurity; it grabs various elements frayed from far and wide, and composes them seamlessly into, yes, musical brilliance. &quot;Spaceship,&quot; featuring GLC and Consequence (Tribe Called Quest fame) is one example of that. West wishes to &quot;buy a spaceship and fly,&quot; a Kool Keith-esque UFO ode, accentuated by sci-fi photon and phaser kick patterns.  <br />  <br /> &quot;Slow Jamz&quot;, is another strange collaboration on the album. Not to be confused, the track is intelligently disguised as a lovey dovey classic ballad, astutely integrating three completely separate ingredients: a catchy Jamie Foxx R&B hook, fellow Chi-Town native Twista's midwest 45 rpm flow, and finally a generic Nokia RingTone piano chord driven by kooky congo beats. &quot;Got a light skinned friend look like Michael Jackson, got a dark skinned friend look like Michael Jackson&quot;. This track is pure genius.  <br />  <br /> &quot;Through The Wire,&quot; revisits West's physical and emotional struggle in the aftermath of surviving a near fatal car accident, a story told in a deep lisp as a consequence of a surgically implanted plate in his chin. Another notable track features Mos Def and Freeway alongside the Harlem Boys Choir assisting on the guitar heavy, &quot;Two Words,&quot; as West manages to lyrically hold his own, reppin' &quot;til he fukkin dies,&quot; continually making references to his roots in Chicago.  <br />  <br /> The College Dropout is a refreshing reminder of reaching success in hip-hop through humility and personality, proving that West is not just simply a producer anymore. And that is what today's sound needs; a subtle aggression that concisely drives creativity in the right direction. If this album remains as a mere sampling of West's inventiveness, then The College Dropout stands as a preface to the complexities of his musical saga and Roc-A-Fella can now flaunt its new summa cum laude recipient. <br />
0380730367|5.0|This was by far the best Genero/Kenzie novel of the series.  I loved this book.  Everything about it.  In this one, you really got to see the emotional side of Bubba.  Made him more likeable.<br /><br />The storyline kept me riveted and not wanting to put the book down.  I was happy to see Angie and Patrick back together.  The ending was very good and left you thinking the character could possibly come back in a future book.<br /><br />I'm scratching my head wondering why this was the last book of the series and why Lehane hasn't published another. It's been 5 years.  I will be watching for it.
B0001XALTG|5.0|This breakthrough film from director Danny Boyle (The Beach, 28 Days Later) was an international hit that deserves all the critical acclaim it garnered and helped launch the career of actor Ewan McGregor. Adapted from the acclaimed novel by Irvine Welsh, Trainspotting tells the story of Renton (McGregor), Spud (Ewen Bremner), Sick Boy (Johnny Lee Miller), and Tommy (Kevin McKidd); four Scottish heroin addicts in the wake of &quot;choosing life, or choosing not to choose life&quot;. Director Boyle and screenwriter John Hodge manage to transfer what is an unfilmable book to film thanks to the off the wall hyperkinetic humor and the brilliant cast. Robert Carlyle's performance as the fight provoking, hard drinking Begbie is excellent as he goes from humerous to frightening in the snap of a finger. While Trainspotting isn't an ode to heroin, it is not a warning about the drug or drugs in general period. The film sucessfully presents all the otherworldly pleasure and excruciating pain that goes with addiction, and like the later made Requiem for a Dream, this is a film that can be hard to watch and is definitely not for everyone. As a previous reviewer stated, it's your choice. This newly released Special Edition from Miramax is a definite improvment from the original release (where as that version had zilch for extras) and owners of the original release should consider upgrading as this edition comes with loads of extras and a much better picture transfer.
B0002BO0AS|5.0|Ok, first of all, the first Unearth record &quot;The Stings of Conciensce&quot; was an amazing breakthrough for crossover metal with excellent hardcore breakdowns. Almost every song on the album was perfect. There was a good mix of total metal with some ideals and energy of hardcore and at the time they were pretty much the best band at it. Well, alot has chenged between then and now. Killswitch Engage have brought crossover metal into the limelight and set the stage for other bands to finally get the sucess that they deserve. Potentially, this is the album that will make or break Unearth's career, and it has most certainly made it. The only problem with the last record was their drummer, who was good, but not great, and as a whole sort of held the band back. Buz McGrath and Ken Suzi are both amazing guitarists and it shows so hard on this record. Plus with the addition of new drummer Mike Justian(Who used to drum for The Red Chord, another Mass. metal powerhouse) things really start to gel on this record. At the same time Unearth is both the most melodic and power metal they've ever been with sweet ass riffs that lick all the way up and down the frets, AND the hardcore elements are more present than ever, with the breakdowns being twice as hard and sick as they were on &quot;Stings&quot;. Hands down this is one of the best metal releases of the last 15 years, much less this year. BUY IT!
6305558167|4.0|The best part of this DVD is watching it with Boorman's running commentary as the audio track.  Of all of the director's commentary DVD's I've seen, this is the most fascinating to me largely because he made the movie without CGI, without a big budget, and without Hollywood barking in his ear.  He KNOWS it is a bit cheesey but he still had a passion to make the best film he could on the shoestring he had.   <br /> <br />A great B movie that is also a good A movie.  Truly a classic.
B00005B4GU|4.0|Not their best at all, but still way above average and better than tons of music that's coming out these days. Not to mention the inclusion of the classic 'Pyramid Song'. I never really got the timing until I read the sheet music. It's mostly dotted quarter notes but the longer chords are half a beat longer which really throws you off. That enhances the song's effect of confusion.<br /><br />  'Packt Like Sardines...' is the 'Everything In Its Right Place' of this album...though not as good. A bit simpler, but the lyrics are good. Some people complain about 'Pull/Pulk Revolving Doors', and I don't blame them. I personally think the beat is awesome but that's just me. 'You And Whose Army' is a great song, and if you are patient through the clean guitar part it really pays off at the end. 'I Might Be Wrong' is an excellent song, with a great guitar riff.<br /><br />  This is where the problems with the album start. 'Knives Out' is wayyy too much like 'Paranoid Android', but if you can get over that it's a pretty good song. 'Morning Bell' was never really one of my favorite songs, the minor to major key changes are just hard to get used to. This version is not as good as the Kid A version (I heard that 'Morning Bell/Amnesiac' was actually the first version) but still an average song.<br /><br />  'Like Spinning Plates' is a good song...almost 'Street Spirit'-ish. It would be an amazing song if it didn't have the backwards effect though. But then, it wouldn't be like spinning plates. It's one of those weird things where you know it's a good song but it just isn't presented as well as it could've been...Finally, 'Life In A Glasshouse' just isn't really my style. Not a bad song though.<br /><br />  'Dollars & Cents' and 'Hunting Bears' are both great songs. The latter, some people complain is too filler, but I think it's a great little interlude that actually gives you the feeling of hunting bears.<br /><br />  Overall I'd recommend this album.
0060512806|4.0|Neal Stephenson's Cryptonomicon is full of the kind of deadpanned cynicism that can normally only be developed through a lifetime of disingenuous lies, schmaltzy Hollywood happy endings, and heaps and heaps of tragedy. As often as these one-liners are hilarious, though, they're narratively substantial, revelatory of some finer point, character trait, or plot piece that Stephenson is demonstrating. <br /> <br />Then there are the metaphors. If Stephenson's one-liners are at the same time hilarious and dense, his metaphors are the sardonic vacuum of infinitely compressed sarcasm. Take for instance, this episode about a third into the book. One of Stephenson's several main characters, hacker-geek Richard Waterhouse, is eating dinner with his girlfriend's academic (read: snooty) friends, when one of them just can't help but launch into a severely ill informed attack against the internet. Waterhouse, as up on the internet as anyone in the world, sits by for as long as he can, letting this professor pontificate to his colleagues like a peacock strutting around. <br /> <br />All the time, of course, Waterhouse burns with the knowledge that the professor is spouting lies, blissfully unaware of his own ignorance as he demonizes an institution he knows nothing about. To placate himself Waterhouse imagines that he is a stout Dwarf from The Lord of the Rings and the professors are mindless Hobbits. This appeals to Waterhouse, as he sees himself Dwarfishly tolerating this foolish Hobbitry. As much as Waterhouse takes pleasure in this image, though, he still grows angrier and angrier. Finally, when he can stand it no more, Waterhouse gets out his trusty battle axe and proceeds to ravage the Hobbit's ivory towers. <br /> <br />If the above appeals to you as funny, or at least clever, then you'll enjoy Cryptonomicon for its deep, nuanced foray into hacker culture. Stephenson's wit, metaphors, and story capture the feel of the hacker universe, and quite amusingly so, suffusing virtually every page with energy and humor. <br /> <br />The plot is set in two separate eras. In one, marine William Shaftoe scrambles through an intercontinental quest, fighting the Axis powers in World War II, feeding his morphine addiction, and generally getting led around by the nose. Also part of the WWII scenario is Waterhouse, one of the most cryptographically genius men in the world, and one of the few people who may be able to crack German and Japanese codes well enough to keep the Allies from turning to subjects of the Thousand Year Reich. <br /> <br />The second era is at the end of the twentieth century, where Waterhouse's grandson (our Hobbit metaphor man) finds himself trying to set up a data crypt in the Philippines, part of a business venture that could either leave him and his partners rich, sued into oblivion, or possibly even dead. <br /> <br />Through narration that bounces between characters and eras with reckless abandon, Stephenson fleshes out the story of his characters. The plot itself almost immediately grows convoluted, intricate, and irresistible. For most of the book the reader is scrambling to just hang on as the plot drags him along as though he was bare-knuckling on the wing of a jet fighter. This is not the kind of book one reads for its gritty realism; it feels more like a comic book couched in the form of a novel. <br /> <br />Hard-headed marine Shaftoe aside, Cryptonomicon gives us a deep look into hacker culture. Stephenson's authenticity is made clear by his ability to portray even the most mundane events from a hacker's point of view. For instance, Stephenson's character, Waterhouse, who most definitely is a hacker, doesn't just eat breakfast; he has worked out an entire system, right down to the temperature of his milk and the exact space of time it is allowed to interact with each 'pillow' of his Cap'n Crunch cereal. And for Waterhouse's business associate, Avi, run-of-the mill encryption just won't do. Avi requires Waterhouse toencrypt their confidential e-mails to such an extent that it would take far longer than the estimated life expectancy of the universe for anyone to hack them. <br /> <br />Stephenson's intricate, intriguing takes on hacker life are the rivets out of which this roller coaster ride of a novel is built. And even though the term 'roller-coaster ride' is as clich as it gets, it has never been so apt. Cryptonomicon is rife with such energy that the words practically erupt off the page and embed themselves into your irises. The narrative voice assaults you like a drill sergeant. And the plot moves at such a pace that Cryptonomicon may be one of the most densely plotted books in the history of literature: over ten main characters, each with histories, quirks, fears, and desires; a thorough explication of many facets of cryptology, mathematics, classical music, pipe organs, the military, internet startups; endless brigades of subplots, that sprout so often that the book resembles the root system of a thousand-year sequoia; tributary characters popping up in every scene; multitudinous locales so vividly described that Stephenson must have made a world tour part of his research. <br /> <br />Yet while the scope of Stephenson's work is undeniably impressive, it is also something of a liability. It's difficult for even such literary deities as Tolstoy to keep every last bit of a thousand page epic neatly in place, and here Stephenson is out of his depth. At times Cryptonomicon can feel slapped together, at other times it simply makes you ask why. Cryptonomicon has drawn comparisons to Gravity's Rainbow, and perhaps these comparisons are most appropriate for the two novels' sheer ungainliness. Yet where Pynchon's descents into chaos rattled the mind and spurred the imagination, Stephenson's messy plot points too often seem like obstacles to be passed before getting back to the action. Cryptonomicon certainly cannot justify all of its many pages. <br /> <br />Although Cryptonomicon may lack coherence, the many treasures embedded deep within are worth wading for. It is an at times hilarious romp, a story that makes itself strangely addictive, an examination of a world that has rarely been so interestingly dissected. <br />

B0002KVUKM|3.0|Another summer season has come upon us at the box office with many major releases opening within its first few weeks all in an effort to gather as much coinage as they possibly can before Spider-Man 2 steamrolls its way into theaters. Anything after that film better be pretty damn good to compete with it but that is another topic for another day. Prior to 1999 the summer season kicked off around Memorial Day weekend as children began to slowly be released from schools across the country but that was before The Mummy opened to $43 million the weekend of May 7th, 1999, which, in effect, changed the way studios dealt with the summer heat. In the two years that followed, both Gladiator (2000) and The Mummy Returns (2001) opened on the first weekend of May to fantastic numbers but that never became the official kick-off point for the summer until Spider-Man sealed the deal in 2002, opening to $115 million its opening weekend. Universal studios doesn?t expect that much with the opening of Van Helsing but they do expect a decent return as it is not often that they shell out $160 million (and then some) for one film especially in the current situation they are in with their new parent company. But considering Stephen Sommers, the same man who directed The Mummy and its sequel, is at that reins, there?s a sure bet the cult followers will be out in droves once again.    The story follows the adventures a man sent by a secret society to go out into the world to vanquish evil creatures such as the Wolfman, Frankenstein?s monster, and Dracula and stop their reins of terror on humanity. Van Helsing is known throughout most of Europe, either as a holy man or as a murderer, but the man behind God?s work has no memory of who he is or where he comes from. All he knows is that he is in the service of the Catholic Church sent to different parts of the world to stop evil in the form of monsters and demons. There?s nothing in the job description about being well liked by the people he istrying to protect. His latest assignment is to travel to Transylvania to destroy the powerful Count Dracula while at the same time protect Anna Valerious, the last of her family?s lineage who had sworn to do anything in their power to destroy Dracula and end his rein of terror. But Dracula has a plan of his own ? he devises a course of action in using Frankenstein?s monster as well as the Wolfman in his efforts to raise up a force of bat-like children to rule over humanity with fear and terror. There?s only one man who stands in his way, who has the force of God on his side: Van Helsing. The story for Van Helsing is hard to really grasp but not in the sense you would think. The film isn?t a real puzzler or anything of that nature (Good vs. Evil ? not much to figure out here) but one does have to have a tolerance for campy action flicks or else this will be a complete waste of time. Though the film is clich?d at moments, surprisingly it wasn?t so much as was to be expected, if that helps at all to those who disliked The Mummy films.    No one may actually be going into this film for the sole purpose of seeing any particular star within it, which is probably the reason why there are only two (one if you want to get into specifics) big names in the cast, but none the less the cast of Van Helsing offers some decent performances, nothing Oscar caliber by any means, while at the same presenting several prominent disappointments. Hugh Jackman, who is best known for his performance of Wolverine in the X-Men film series, gives an engaging performance as Abraham Van Helsing, though no where near the one given by Sir Anthony Hopkins in Bram Stoker?s Dracula, which was to be expected. The only problem lies with the character itself as the script starts off with many questions and yet answers very few of the them by the end, which could or could not point to a possible sequel in the works. Kate Beckinsale, who hasn?t been able to make a name for her self in the sense of truly carrying a film on her name alone just yet, works with what is given to her as best she can but there really isn?t much emotional attachment with the character to be really all that concerned for what happens to her within the course of the film. Though it was Sommer?s intent on resurrecting (in a sense) interest in Dracula, the vision seems to be lost with Richard Roxburgh?s go around as he is way too over-the-top in a way that?s laughable and, at times, confusing. The same would have to go for Dracula?s Brides played Elena Anaya, Silvia Colloca and Josie Maran, who become so irritating in their performances that the audience will be applauding at their demises, and not for the reasons they should be doing so.    Overall, Van Helsing kicks off the 2004 summer box office with more of a whimper then a driving force and only shatters the hopes of those who were awaiting an enthusiastic kick-off as had always been accustomed in the past. As with Hellboy, Van Helsing falls into the category of films that don?t leave you clamoring to see them again nor are they features that you would detest repeating, if they were presented to you again. The first third of the film (dividing the film into three parts) was quite exciting, mysterious, and filled with wall-to-wall action, which makes the other two thirds of the film all the more disappointing. There is nothing as bad as a film that sets you up for quality entertainment only to knock you down with a weak follow-through. The problem lies with the script itself which becomes too bogged down with numerous plot lines and character aspects and quickly deteriorates into a mundane and repetitive camp film. There?s nothing wrong with camp films as long as they are done right, which isn?t the case with Van Helsing. Another issue that was clearly prominent throughout the film was the blatant over-use of CGI effects, which often looked fake, no more so then in the scene where the Wolfman jumps across the fire on the wagon toward Van Helsing or the transformation of Dracula, which just looked ridiculous. And there was a small problem with the musical score, which, every so often, sounded too familiar to the score for The Mummy, but nothing major to complain about. There are three types of people who will be disappointed by this film: fans of the classic novel (and film) Dracula, those who fell for the hype, and all others who aren?t just entertained by a few mere explosions and (...) flashed on the screen. Van Helsing will surely go down as one of the bigger disappointments of the summer season.
B000286S8S|5.0|For me, buying this CD was like meeting an &quot;old lost friend&quot; <br /> Eddie has the ability of surprising me, so this is what I did: bought the CD, go back home as fast as possible, put the first CD on the CD player and DON'T LOOK AT THE TRACK LISTING.The same for the second one..There I got my first (pleasant) surprise, the alternation between the Dave-Sammy songs. It just hits me. <br /> The second surprise was the quality of the remastering, on my 6.000+ ? (6.500 $) Hi-Fi sistem all the songs sounded cristal clear, like if they were recorded yesterday. The Europen pressing suffers from the same fade out problem on &quot;Finish what you started&quot;, nothing serious. <br /> The third were the 3 new songs. They sound like a real band again. Sorry to say this for all the Dave era fans, but this come back proves WHO is the man in Van Halen, and this is Sammy Hagar. All the energy is back on this songs, sure the lyrics from Up for Breakfast are nothing to cry for. It's about time has the Van Halen punch and &quot;in the face&quot; energy. Learning to see really made me fall in love (Eddie, you got it again) with it. As Eddie has always said (he learnt it from one of his teachers) &quot;if it sounds good, then it is good&quot;. Learning to see sounds damm good to me.  <br /> I'm not talking about money here, but the return of my favourite band, so I don't care (and I have an average wage) how much I have to pay for this double album, I'll pay it 'cause I'll enjoy it. <br /> Track selection is great, not stellar either, for my taste Mean Street and Hear about it later are missing, as well as The seventh seal, Don't tell me or Aftershock, but I don't really think the Balance album needs for a (is one of my quality reference recordings) remastering, and the Dave era albums were remastered (using HDCD) on late 2.000. <br /> Just to finish, buying this CD made me very very happy.
B00005JMUA|4.0|?Revenge is a dish best served cold.?        When we last left off, Quentin Tarantino has re-emerged onto the Hollywood scene for the first time in six years with not just one but two films to be released into theaters to an overwhelmingly awaiting cult audience. But not everyone was especially happy with the decision of both Tarantino and his distributor, Miramax Pictures, to split the tale of The Bride in two. There were some in the vast assortment of captious movie-goers that took this as a sign of continued greed amongst the ?Hollywood elite? in that the decision of splitting the film into two parts was done to get the loyal fans to shell-out double the normal ticket price for essentially one film. Granted, in the end, that turned out not to be the case, as the film would actually be five hours in length and thus be deemed too long to be taken all at once, but the issue still remained whether the rest of Hollywood would follow in the foot-steps of Kill Bill and spark a brand new trend, only this time with less honorable then Tarantino did. That is still to be seen and perhaps that argument is a bit overzealous ? In this situation, one shouldn?t question what could happen in the future but whether or not the primary influence, namely Kill Bill, did what it claimed it would accomplish, by delivering movie-goers ultimate satisfaction for dollar.        Kill Bill (Volume II) is the second, and possibly final, installment of the story that centers on a former member of a group of assassins who seeks revenge for the actions done on to her by her former colleagues. For those unfamiliar with the first installment, here is a slight recap of previous events:        A woman known only as The Bride has waken up from a four year comma after her former boss Bill left her for dead on the day of her wedding killing her fianc?, the wedding party and her unborn child. Unfortunately for the skilled assassin, he made one big mistake: he failed to kill her. Now that she has awakenedfrom her living slumber, The Bride will travel the world picking off her attempted killers one by one including the mysterious Bill. First up on her list is O-Ren Ishi, aka Cottonmouth, and her group of Japanese underground assassins and then Vernita Green, aka Copperhead. Upon completing the task of killing her first two targets, The Bride continues on her rampage determined to kill everyone on her list, all the way to Bill.        The second installment picks up basically where the first one left off, leaving The Bride heading to her next target, Budd (aka Sidewinder), who happens to be the run-down and vastly inferior brother of Bill himself. But, for at least a few moments, Budd gets the upper-hand on the film?s lead assassin by placing her in a coffin and burring her alive. In the time it takes her to escape, the audience is informed on the vast training The Bride took in order to become the superior apache she is today. Upon escaping the make-shift grave, The Bride duels with her contemporary rival, Elle Driver (aka California Mountain Snake), who not only killed Pai Mai but has her eyes set on The Bride herself. The final lag of her journey brings her to the home of Bill himself and along with him comes a little surprise: her daughter. The story for Kill Bill (Volume II) is quite arguably vastly superior to the one written up for the first installment in that this one deals not so much with action but dialogue and meanings discovered behind actions made by characters throughout this film as well as the previous installment. Once again Tarantino demonstrates his remarkable filmmaking skills by back-tracking the story at precise moments that by doing so will explain actions yet to come. Few writers can pull such an effect successful and Tarantino does so brilliantly.        As was said with the previous installment, a relative bunch of low-profile actors and actresses make up one of the better casts of the year for this film, but this time around we introducedto a slightly different lot from the last film. Michael Madsen gives a dead-on (no pun intended) performance as Budd, a run-down and subjacent version of his former self now that he is no longer in the hit-man business. Madsen gives a sense that the character really contemplates on what he has done and whether or not he feels remorse for those actions but at the same time showcases the scoundrel that still lives within him. Daryl Hannah is quite intriguing as Elle Driver, clearly the most ruthless and baneful character in the film series. The only problem with her role was the dreadfully over-the-top performance given when her character?s eye was plucked out. Granted having one?s eye plucked out isn?t a pleasant manner but what Hannah presented on screen was unconvincing and quite annoying after some time. Uma Thurman?s role in the second installment can?t be complimented more then her role in the first ? She gives an absolutely brilliant, witty, and exhilarating performance that works every moment she is on screen. And David Carradine, best known for his Kung Fu television series, gives a ?sweet?, vibrant, and utterly perfect performance as the title character, Bill. He shines in every scenes he is presented in and works exceedingly well with Uma Thurman ? There isn?t much to say other then ?Bravo?!        Overall, Kill Bill plays out much like the concept of revenge itself ? actions and instincts engulf us at first, but as time goes on and the journey rampages toward its ultimate conclusion, truth and meaning quickly take over. Where Tarantino starts off with a bang, he rightfully finishes off with a shock to our system ? maturity and philosophical contemplation on the subject of revenge and what it means for those involved. Those who were truly engulfed by the blood and gut spilling actions of the first film will be greatly disappointed by the second installment unless you are one of those geeks who enjoy dialogue far more then comical violence, which may not betoo many. But if there is even just a few then that will demonstrate the true essence of maturity amongst the movie-going public. Despite a pacing that made the feature feel a tad longer then was probably necessary, Kill Bill (Volume II) serves as a fitting conclusion to Quentin Tarantino?s near perfect masterpiece ? a masterpiece that may take quite some time to surpass but if the young filmmaker keeps putting out work like his previous films, his cult audience is more then willing to wait.
B0001ZX0OC|4.0|In Jimmy's universe, daughters are more precious than gold, so vengeance for murdering one is paramount.     This is a dark and depressing drama about the intertwined lives of 3 male characters in a tough Boston working class neighborhood. The movie  bears certain resemblances to Monster in which many of the characters were homeless. In this movie,the past is very important. The characters are respectable, working- class Boston working men and women but at least Jimmy has spent some time in jail. The three characters are Jimmy, a small storeowner and family man who has already killed a man he didn't like as the story opens; Sean, an investigating cop, and Dave, a handyman who is a suspect in the murder of Jimmy's daughter. There are other important characters: the wives of all three, who give varying degrees of support, in important ways, to their husbands, and are important as supporting actresses(Jimmy's wife is supportive of whatever he does; Dave's wife is suspicious of his story about the murder night, which turns out to be true; Sean's wife, arguably the most attractive of the 3, simply calls him up and says nothing); the boyfriend of the murdered girl who is a suspect and the son of Just Ray, one of Jimmy's old enemies from jail; Sean's cop partner who believes Dave did it; the families of the three men. The story attempts to draw some relevance from a childhood incident in which one of the three boys was kidnapped and molested by a man posing as a cop, while the other two looked on. Frequent references and flashbacks are made to this event and it is an important motivational factor among the three intertwined lives. The movie has a sleazy feel that one might associate with director Clint Eastwood. I thought the parade sequence at the end was effective as it brightly overshadows the tragic consequences of Jimmy's second vengeful murder which he committed to defend his murdered daughter's honor. This bright parade music is somewhat similar though not identicalto the cymbal crash hiding the gunshot in the Alfred Hitchcock film, The Man Who Knew Too Much. Another very powerful scene is the scene at the sleazy waterfront bar where Jimmy and two thugs confront Dave and accuse him of murder.
B00005JMJG|4.0|It happens to both the best and worst of us at some time in our lives. Love ? If you haven?t experienced this yet just wait, you will. It is inevitable that at some time in our journey through life that we will come across someone that fascinates us so profoundly that we feel as though we could spend the rest of our lives with this magnetic individual. There is no exact science to the concept of love. Many believe that the idea of love goes beyond the reasonable or the logical to a more diverse level of the illogical, irrational, and the unreasonable. Why is it that we find ourselves attracted to people that, on the surface, seem as though they would never be compatible with our own lifestyle? Why is it that when we do fall in love with a certain individual and think at first that this is a perfect match, we find over time that less tolerable marks are more frequent on the surface? And why is it that we overlook some individuals that, although at first there is no real ?love connection? per say, we seem to have a somewhat pure liking for someone and that it takes us longer then it should to see that person for who they really are to us? Love is a complicated subject that can?t be taught, it can only be experienced for what it is ? utterly confusing and yet at the same time completely fulfilling. <br /> <br />The story is a twisted and complicated tale from the same man who brought movie-going audiences such award-savvy features as Being John Malkovich and Adaptation. Joel Barish seems like the average, normal guy who stays pretty isolated from communicating his true feelings to others and yet reveals spectacular insight only to the confines of his journal. He doesn?t like going on impulses and gut feelings but rather relies more on common sense and the logical sense of self-direction. That is until he meets Clementine. They flirt with each other and eventually find themselves falling in love with one another ? That is until one day Joel finds out that Clementine hasundergone a radical procedure to have him erased from her memory because she was unhappy. So, in an act of self-gratification, Joel decides to undergo the procedure himself, erasing every argument, every embarrassment, every thought he has had involving Clementine. But as the procedure goes on, Joel begins to realize that beyond the quarrels and the less flattering incidents there were beautiful memories that he never wants to forget. So he does the unthinkable ? Joel attempts to outrun the erasers through a dizzying chase through his mind. The story for Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is hauntingly brilliant and, in some cases, personally gratifying. The concepts and the feelings expressed behind the script of this film hit so hard to home that it feels as though we our seeing our own love lives played out on screen. Granted Sunshine does tend to veer off into the ridiculously absurd but when evaluating what one takes away from this film, it is pure genius. <br /> <br />Quite amazingly this low budgeted independent feature showcases a surprising amount of A-list talent but manages to have those performers express well beyond their famous names. Jim Carrey, who has unsuccessfully attempted to make a mark in drama with lead performances in Man on the Moon and The Majestic, gives a thoroughly convincing and commanding performance in the role of Joel Barish. And Carrey?s performance is only complimented by his interaction with Kate Winslet, who acts opposite of him as Clementine. Though the two give dramatically different personas to their characters and look as if they would never be quite compatible with each other based on surface actions, which is the idea the filmmakers are trying to express. It?s not what is right in front of us that should define a relationship; it is the memories themselves and the experiences of the two individuals. Elijah Wood, in his first role outside the Lord of the Rings franchise which recently wrapped up in December, gives an effective performance as a man one can?t help but despise for his methods of obtaining someone?s affection but at the same time feel pity for his plight, which is that he feels love eludes him. And Kirsten Dunst performs well within the film despite her appearance that protrudes a sense of innocence that feels off-base or awkward that distracts from the actions of her character. Not to say that she doesn?t perform well or that the character is a pointless one, not in the least, but perhaps it is the fact that her innocence, based on her name and the characters she has played, carries a stigma with her role. <br /> <br />Overall, Sunshine, as awkward and thoroughly confusing at it may seem and is, manages to express, in the most informal of ways, the feelings and thoughts we should all have when examining a relationship, in that it is not the superficial features but the underlining memories that make it all worth while. When a relationship hits that unfortunate moment where it all seems to be breaking down, we, as human beings, seem to instantly draw ourselves to the negative aspects of that person, as Joel did early in the procedure, in an attempt of sorts to make everything right within our mind. What Eternal Sunshine successfully expresses is that when breaking down the relationship moment by moment, more often then not the happier events outweigh the bad and that should be our determining factor to keep the relationship going. Too many moments are wasted on gut-instincts and logic, when it comes to love one must live every moment for what it is because we only have one shot in this world and we might as well make it worthwhile. What happens if that relationship doesn?t work? You pick yourself up, let the relationship go, and, in time, move on. If you try your best and nothing seems to work in that relationship then perhaps it will never work and you shouldn?t play out a fantasy that you know will never be. We have all experienced moments where we feel as though there is opportunity to ask someone out or express how one feels for a certain individual but have chickened out due to nerves, ?gut-instincts?, or views of superficial matters. Eternal Sunshine promotes the ideology of living within the present and letting the course of the matter play out as it may. If we all relied on nerves and logic, would anyone really fall in love?
B000255LRA|4.0|This dark historical drama set in 1183 is a far cry from most of the 2003 Oscar Nominees and Winners, except perhaps for Master and Commander and Girl With A Pearl Earring,two historical dramas. It concerns King Henry II of England who meets with his jailed wife, three ambitious sons, and the new King Philip of France at Chinon in France over Christmas to decide the accession to the throne and the dividing up of Henry's considerable lands among his heirs. There is considerable conniving among the lead characters, since the stakes are so high, and neither the mother nor her three sons are very loyal to their father. Eleanor of Aquitaine was particularly noteworthy for siding with her sons in their claims against their father. Various plots and alliances are hatched while the unfaithful Henry continues his affair with young Alys, sister of the French King, whom he offers as a pawn in his game of divide and conquer.      I found this to be a stimulating remake of the Katherine Hepburn film,which I haven't seen.Both Glenn Close and Patrick Stewart seem highly involved in their roles throughout. Eleanor in the course of the dialogue reviews the course of her marriage with Henry II from her teenage years when she was married to the King of France and possibly slept with Henry's father. Their rocky relationship has its ups and downs in the course of the film, ending on a positive tone. But there are scenes with Eleanor insulting her husband's masculinity as he contemplates taking a new wife to produce an heir, for example, claiming he has no sons, and she also threatens him with the distinct possibility that at one time she slept with his father. At times Henry seems to favor his youngest son John, and Eleanor favors Richard, but these alliances do not last and eventually all three sons end up in the dungeon. If you have tried to enjoy Shakespearean drama but have found it somewhat inaccessible, I think you will enjoy this film which is quite accessible to the general public. Of course it helps to have some knowledge of history.
B000286S8S|4.0|If you want greatest hits then well this is them.  Essentially these are all of Van Halen's biggest hits and yes it's missing songs and the sequencing is definitely an annoying thing.  Why must it always be Dave song then sammy song.  Chronological order would've worked better.  Onto the new songs <br /> <br />One word:Fantastic.  By the way, the idiot who blamed Sammy for bad lyrics on Up For Breakfast clearly knows jack about Van Halen because Eddie wrote the whole song as well as the other two songs and the other three guys in the band had nothing to do with it.  Up For Breakfast does though have crappy lyrics that I can't help but laugh at.  It's About Time feels like the Van Halen of old and feels liek it came outta the David Lee Roth era of the band.  Learning To See is a really unbalance song between soft in the verses and heavy in the chorus'.  Yet, somehow, I love that song. <br /> <br />Overall-If you're just getting into Van Halen, this is a great intro for you.
B000089RVX|5.0|This is definitely my favourite band of all time!!! Amy Lee is the best female singer ever and she has the most beautiful voice I have heard in my life! Those people saying they are overrated or they sound too much like this band or blah blah blah... don't have a clue! This is just a joy to listen to! I have been listening to Evanescence for almost a year now and I think I will never get sick of it. In fact I think I will listen to it for the rest of my life.  And don't forget Evanescence's old songs as well found in their first album (Origin), Demos and EPs. They are all amazing! I thank God for Evanescence and thank God for Amy Lee. They have just changed my life.
B000002J2F|5.0|When you listen to 1980's 'Duke' by Genesis, you realize that there was quite a lot of musical life left in the band even years after the departure of Gabriel in 75 and Hackett in 77. Collins' vocals and drumming were powerful, Banks' keyboards were solid, and Rutherford's composition was as good as ever. Samples of all this can be found from the opening track, well into &quot;Guide Vocal&quot;, &quot;Man Of Our Times&quot;, the 8+ min-long epic &quot;Duke's Travels&quot; and even in the more commercial collective-composition-turned-classic &quot;Turn It On Again&quot; and the standard Collins ballad &quot;Please Don't Ask&quot;.<br /><br /> So, in 1980 the band still shows signs of life (all was still alive and well in Planet Genesis), but it also showed clear signs of becoming a more commercial gig, which made out of &quot;Misunderstanding&quot; far more than a simple confusion. This would indeed become the standard, rather than the norm: a band that was all about great compositions, musicianship and genius in the seventies turned into a commercial song production machine. At least that came to happen in later productions (1981's 'Abacab', 1983's 'Genesis' and 1986's 'Invisible Touch'). Until this album, the majority of the songs were quite solid and it's safe to say that you're bound to enjoy most of their pre-Duke work (and 'Duke' itself, of course) if you are into Progressive Rock. If you are into Pop Rock Genesis, look for later works: don't look back.
B000099T2L|5.0|I bought this album the day it came out and I can't stop listening to it. It has all types of music and she really can sing. Her voice is so beautiful and so powerful, she's one of the few artists that really can sing live, and I'm sick of people that is saying Ashanti is a good singer and that she can sing. She's an studio artist, I'm sorry but Ashanti CAN'T SING and she's horrible live, like all murder inc artists. I've Beyonc?'s Live At Wembley DVD and I'm amazed how powerful is her voice live. She can sing and dance at the same time, which is soooo hard. <br /> About the album: Although it is the best album of 2003, she didn't reach her potential. I was expecting this to be the most energetic album of the year, which is not and I was a little disappointed about that. When I heard

I listened to this record after someone copied it for me and i completely fell i love with it, it holds its ground as one of my favorites out today, and like people have said before, every song has a true meaning and nice jam.  Most people bashing this album are saying things like its too pop or R&B but who cares what it is, if you like it, nod your head to it and don't give a (...) what anyone else has to say about it.  Im giving my personal opinion to anyone looking for a reason to buy this album, it is worth every penny and i am considering going out and buying it becuase Kanye deserves all profit for it, and it's an album i'd like to have around for a long time.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I would rather have a choice of which version of these films to watch. Lucas says the original versions &quot;don't exist&quot;. Really? I seem to remember watching them many times as a child. I know my parents spent quite a bit of money for me to do so. But... they don't exist. Does this mean my parents get their money back? <br /> Hey George: you may have built the Empire, but we paid for it. The least you could do is let us decide which version is best...
630407185X|5.0|With out a shadow of doubt the best war film ever produced.But were too begin.One the acting is superb everyone does magnificently Sean Connery is great as the general whos facing impossible odds Gene Hackman is great as the polish general who fears his men are going to be massacred of course he has too strong an accent and Dirk Bogared who is the over conferdent upper brass who is risking everything but knows nothing.Two its one of the most moving films ever.It really does show the futility of war when the old woman is mown down by german fire it was one of the most shocking things in the film.Three the musical score it perfectly fits the film and the atmosphere of the film some might say it doesnt fit a film of its genre but it does because the everyone on the allied side went in with &quot; the gun-ho lets go get em&quot; idea not realising they were going into a defeat.And when the US 82nd are on the edge of defeat and suddenly 30 CORP comes rolling up the bridge and the music starts its a great moment and your hopeing that mabey just mabey the paras at Arnhem will be saved.Four unlike saving private ryan its a true story and it does show that its an allied effort unlike saving private ryan which seems to give the impression that the US took on NAZI germany all alone hmm.The film includes polish,US and British paras and also it doesnt forget the dutch resistance who helped in the liberation of Europe.Apart from just telling the story of the geat epic that was Market Garden it shows the human side as well it gives us a little insite into the characters it also shows the german side as well and you kinda feel sorry for them when 30 Corp starts blowing the crap outta them.All in all a marvelous film done on a spectacula scale this movie is a fitting tribute to the young americans polish,british and dutch who died on that awful campaign may there sacrifce never be forgotten.

0553103547|1.0|With A Game of Thrones, it's the good stuff that sucks you in, but all the problems that leave you frustrated and resentful when its done.<br /><br />The good stuff includes writing that flows well, characterizations that that may be occasionally ripped off but are at least many and varied and usually aren't completely flat (better than most fantasy/sci-fi), an immersive world, tension amongst the characters and factions, and hints of dire developments to come.<br /><br />But please, this is an 800 page book that fails to completely tell even one story. George R R Martin has taken about 8 plots, none of which would amount to even a novella on its own, and put them all in a blender in the hopes that when it all comes out as sludge, you won't notice that it doesn't add up to anything. The constant switching back and forth between plot lines and perspective doesn't allow even a single one to develop in more than a halting manner. I am of the school that believes if you are going to make me read 800 pages and call it a book, and make me wait 3 years for the next one, you better be able to write one complete arc anyway, somthing that has eluded this author. Good grief, when did it become acceptable to write an 800-page book with so little actual content? Huge swaths of this book could be deleted and it would make little difference to the reading experience.<br /><br />As frustrating as this is, it wouldn't in and of itself amount to fatal criticism if the book didn't have other problems. I think the chief one is just that we've seen all these people before. The Catelyn/Eddard/Robb trio seems so similar in feel to the Leto/Jessica/Paul trio in Dune that they could almost be carbon-copies, minus the trappings of setting; Catelyn's lines could be Jessica's in many spots. Sansa is straight out of the pages of War and Peace. I'm sure Arya basically wrote herself. I'm not opposed to borrowing in general, but I prefer that authors make some effort to disguise their efforts in this matter.<br /><br />Strip out all this, though, and you are left with some good stuff. Except in the more vulgar passages, which usually seem simply ostentatious, Martin clearly has a grasp of language. His descent into detail is occasionally tiresome, but often does do a good job at conveying a time and place, and the trade-off is well worth it. While the crush of different characters with hard-to-remember names can make War and Peace look like a one-man play, it does lend the novel a sense of grandeur and scope that is unique and welcome. And the building up of subtle tensions (like the ominous rumblings from beyond Hadrian's, er, The Wall) are well-handled, or would have been if they had ever amounted to anything.<br /><br />Still, at the end of the day, three books came to mind when reading this: a) Tolstoy's War and Peace; b) Stephen R Donaldson's Mirror of her Dreams; and c) Donaldson's Gap series, starting with The Real Story. A Game of Thrones is but a pale shadow of any of these books. Tolstoy has a very similar soap-opera-esque feel, but he is a master crafstmen who had a story to tell, who told it, and finished it. Martin appears to be none of these things, but of course War and Peace is a classic of western literature. Donaldson's Mirror of her Dreams features an incredibly similar medeval-esque setting of political intruige, but Donaldson's story had great imagination, vastly superior characters, and a plot that had an arc and momentun. Donaldon's Gap series had a similar format (character-switching chapters), similarly traumatized characters and a similar willingness to kill off anyone, and similar layers and layers of intruige - but it again had vastly richer and far more believable characters, managed to make even the nasty ones sympathetic at some level, and had a plot which actually moved and allowed the characters to develop in interesting ways and stuff to happen. In short, A Game of Thrones seems amaturish and derivitive by comparison to anyof these books.<br /><br />A book can be of less-than-epic quality and still do OK, but when it comes to A Game of Thrones, I keep coming back to one fact - 800 pages, and it's little more than an introduction to Westros. If I were an author writing an 800-page book, I'd want more to show for it.on to any of these books. <br /> <br />A book can be of less-than-epic quality and still do OK, but when it comes to A Game of Thrones, I keep coming back to one fact - 800 pages, and it's little more than an introduction to Westros.

B00005A46T|5.0|If you haven't heard of Slipknot in the world today, you must be living in hole in the ground. These guys have taken what metal id all about and caressed its underside, turning it into something different. The nine-member band has taken metal and injected it with caffeine and amphetamines. They have shaped what metal is all about these days, and this album is the basis of that. Without truly listening, one might wave off this masterpiece as a raging and blatent wall of sound, but if one looks closer, the wall would become more detailed and harder to comprehend at one glance. As is most apparent in songs such as My Plague and Left Behind, Corey Taylor has used a technique that most avoid, and it works. By singing gracefully instead of very staccato in the chori, he wraps a blanket around the blazing guitar riffs and drum beating, taking away the sharp edges of traditional metal, and turning it into art, something MUCH more. However much they may have toned down, in the long run, they keep the rampage of noise that drew me to them. As is exhibited in People=S*** and The Heretic Anthem especially, it is completely apparent that Slipknot has held, if not gained more of, their completely razor-edge metallic instinct. The one and only downfall of this album is the annoying and somewhat relentless beeps/scratches/whines/sfx in a few tracks. Other than that, if you love metal as I do, buy this album ASAP
B000286S8S|3.0|Wow, this cd is getting some negativity. Some comments: <br /> 1) It looks like some of the reviewers have never seen a greatest hits collection before. Of course it doesn't have EVERY ONE of your favorite songs. No collection would unless (a) you produced it or (b) it came from a one-hit wonder. If there's a song missing, buy it some from itunes or wherever. If Fair Warning is your favorite cd, buy it as well, there's only a one-song overlap. <br /> 2) The live songs: I think part of the purpose of this cd is to support their current (and future?) tours. It makes sense to show people what they sound like now, rather than what they sounded like 20 years ago. Just be glad they didn't replace the album tracks instead of repeating them (now THAT would suck!). <br /> 3) Yep, they messed up &quot;Finish what you started&quot;. Maybe it's a bad joke on the engineer's part? <br /> 4) Whoever listed this song on Amazon must be a fan, since s/he put out a better (if obvious) ordering than actually exists <br /> on the cd's. <br /> 5) Perhaps the saddest thing, this could have been done 8 years ago, if they had done it right the first time.  <br />  <br /> The songs: I much prefer the DLR era over the SH era. Nothing against Hagar, I just didn't like the direction they followed <br /> in the mid 80's. I think the tracklist is ok. There are a few songs by DLR that are missing, but I think it covers both periods fairly well. I'm not enough of a fan to buy the original cds all over again (had a few on cassette in high school), and this collection is a good enough taste of the band for me. Not spectacular, but not too bad. The 3 new songs sound like typical VH with Hagar to me, not horrible but not great either. Putting them right after eruption was Eddie's way of saying, &quot;we're back&quot;, I guess, but it doesn't sound right to my ears. I doubt I'll listen to them much and I very much doubt they'll get much radio play. Similarly, I don't much care for the 3 live tracks at the end, but I can see why they're there. Sammy does a pretty good rendition of &quot;Ain't talking about love&quot;, but I'll take the studio version, thanks. <br />  <br /> The tracklist: Here's where I have a real problem. I just don't care for the later songs, and alternating old and new just doesn't gel to my ears. The sound changed a lot after 1984 (softer, much more synth) so there is a jarring transition every other song which doesn't make for an enjoyable experience. However, ripping the dlr songs and playing them separately does sound good. As a result, the cd's won't spend much time in my player, since I don't want to program them every single time. <br />  <br /> The packaging: The cd digipack is ok. I like the design from Eddie's guitar. There is a tiny booklet stuck in the middle, which is pretty bad. There's a current picture of the band, and that's about it. No old photos, nothing really to look at. A fawning history of the band, which glosses over a lot, but this is par for the course. Nothing much here, folks. The cd's are pretty blandly designed, but as mentioned above, I probably won't be seeing them much. <br />  <br /> And finally, here's my tracklist: <br /> eruption <br /> you_really_got_me <br /> runnin_with_the_devil <br /> aint_talking_bout_love <br /> and_the_cradle_will_rock <br /> unchainedhot_for_teacher <br /> panama <br /> everybody_wants_some <br /> beautiful_girls <br /> jamies_crying <br /> i'll_wait <br /> oh_pretty_woman <br /> dancing_in_the_street <br /> dance_the_night_away <br /> jump <br /> why_cant_this_be_love <br /> black_and_blue <br />  <br />
B0000D96NW|5.0|As any true Machine Head fan knows, since the release of the epic BURN MY EYES, the press and some fans have been less than kind of the bands ever changing sound, going so far as to even cry sell out when they released the misunderstood BURNING RED, one would assume this is due in part to Ross Robinsons name being on the production credits. Obviously these people have never experienced the 'Head live, or they would have seen the folly of their ways after being savagly and brutally assaulted by the pure power of every song live. But, even after a beating like that, theres bound to still be naysayers...well, TTAOE is the bands response to those non belivers. <br /> Originally released overseas in 2003, TTAOE made such a commotion and had metal fans salivating so bad that Roadrunner Records US had no choice but to pick the band back up and release the album stateside,with a bonus track NOT found on any of the expensive UK or Japanese versions. <br /> The album combines all the best elements of their back catalog. The brutally raw metal attack of BURN MY EYES, the groove and 'bounce' of, well, everything they do!, BURNING RED and the maturity that comes with time and experience, and lets not forget the pure, unadulterated rage of a band that broke barriers in the mid 90's and still never got the total respect they rightly deserved! <br /> Stand out tracks would have to be IMPERIUM, a true metal classic in the vein of Davidian, the onslought of BITE THE BULLET with its frantic whispered lines and shouted (growled?) chorus and the epic finality of album closer DESCEND THE SHADES OF NIGHT. It must be heard to be belived! And lets not forget the bonus US track that was actually put into the track listing and not tagged on the end, SEASONS WITHER. Amazing.  <br /> In short? Just pick this f***er up! What with the NWOAHM blistering our ears, Machine Head is truely one of its origionaters and demand your attention! <br /> True fans though, should pick up the 2 disc version sothey can add the bonus demos to their collection. As an extra bonus, it even has the video for IMPERIUM as an enhanced element! <br />
B000286S8S|2.0|This collection is an extreme disappointment. First off, it's inexcusable to have the end of Finish What Ya Started cut off. Don't people listen to these discs when they're completed? <br /> <br />Second, as people have mentioned, I'm not happy with the revisionist history in completely excluding the Cherone disc. Something should have been pulled from that. Every other studio disc in the VH collection is represented, why not this one? <br /> <br />Then there's the DLR and Hagar tracks that were left off. Mean Street, Somebody Get Me A Doctor, Ice Cream Man, Mine All Mine, Don't Tell Me, Humans Being, Me Wise Magic. The live tracks on here are completely not needed, especially when you consider that Panama is on disc two twice!!! And the other two live tracks repeat as well. Why not have three other tracks instead of these? Besides which, I'm sure a live disc (or at very least, live DVD) will be released after the current tour. <br /> <br />As for the new songs, to me, they're quite simply awful. It's About Time sounds, well, boring. Up For Breakfast is so extraordinarily lame - yeah Sammy, you're witty - cherries on my banana, cream in my coffee, I could never figure out what you're getting at here. But then again, Sammy never was subtle. Learning To See is the best of the three, but Sammy's screaming at the end of that track brings it down considerably.  <br /> <br />In all, a huge disappointment. Here's hoping that some day, they'll do it right and release a box set.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|Everything I'd like to say about this DVD has already been said except for one thing. Marc Mann, who plays guitar and most of the lead throughout the concert, must be the ultimate go-to guy. I had never heard of him before. <br />  <br /> He sits unnoticed near the back. Yet his soloing on &quot;Something&quot;, the fills for &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; (Eric does the main solo), and his blistering leads during the finale &quot;Wah-Wah&quot; were absolutely stunning. He was the nights MVP. <br />  <br /> Other highlights - Billy Preston's keyboard solo on &quot;Isn't It a Pity&quot;, pure joy. Joe Browns rendition of &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; and the concerts final song &quot;I'll See You In My Dreams&quot; were a perfect tribute done with pure honesty. <br />  <br /> This has inspired yet another trip into exploring the music of the Beatles, and the solo careers that followed. Thier influence and meaning in music seems to be a never ending story. <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />

B0000025YL|5.0|This album was an eyeopener when it was released. I honestly thought it was the heaviest album ever and that nothing would ever touch it for heaviness. I was quite literally blown away. <br /> <br />Now, over twenty years on it still gets my motor running into overdrive. It represents a milestone in metal for many reasons. Accept, and this album in particular, were the reason that a whole new generation of metal players emerged. <br /> <br />It was German metal. Now we speak of the classic German metal sound, the classic German metal bands but along with the Scorpions, it was Accept that cracked open the floodgates. <br /> <br />With the release of Restless & Wild they truly hit their stride. The groundwork had already been done years previously. They were amazing live, commanded a very large following for a relatively 'unknown' band and managed to lay down an album sound that was far from demo quality but retained all the raw energy of their live shows while avoiding too much slickness and polish. This album took things up to a whole new level. <br /> <br />Back in the eighties reviewers would describe metal bands as playing 'tight'. Accept were so tight as to be almost clockwork but while still retaining a raw energy that constantly put them on the limit. <br /> <br />'Fast as a Shark' is the one that everybody gets pummelled by and with good reason. It's impossible not to get sucked up by it. It's brutal yet has a lot of melody running through it and it's not agression for the sake of agression. Restless & Wild get's into the slipstream of 'Fast ...' and does well to maintain the momentum. However, it's not until Neon Nights emerges to close side one that the listener finally shakes off the effect of 'Fast ...'. For that reason I tend to play this album on random. Neon is  a masterpiece of mood and oozes power. 'Shake Your Heads' is metal heaven in spite of the corniness of it all. <br /> <br />'Flash Rockin' Man' is one of my all time favourites and the classicPrincess of the Dawn served to let us all know what was to come from Wolf Hoffman in the future. <br /> <br />Udo is most definitely the right man for the vocals. An essential  part of the puzzle. Those that say he isn't singing aren't listening. The man is not your average wailer but he has a lot of texture in his voice and he does control it very well. He is truly unique and Accept just wouldn't have been Accept without him. <br /> <br />For any collector of metal albums this is one of the must have's (along with 'Balls to the Wall' and 'Metal Heart'). At the time 'Restless & Wild' was history in the making and set a trend so many others would pick up on much later on.
0735619670|5.0|Code Complete, first edition, has long been regarded as ?The Bible? for software development. Dare I say, CC2 is even better than the original. It has been thoroughly updated to include OO, internet and web development, as well as new best practices such as test-first development, pair programming, and refactoring.  <br /> <br />Steve McConnell provides a balanced, thoughtful discussion of competing approaches to software development. He also provides a wealth of references to additional materials covering specific topics in more detail. In a field that is often defined by religious arguments, CC2 stays objective on most topics. At the same time, McConnell does not shy away from stating his conclusions on topics that he believes have a clear-cut ?best choice?. <br /> <br />Overall, this book is as much of a ?must have? as the first edition and destined to become just as famous.
B00005B534|5.0|This is a Symphonic Metal band from France, or somewhere over there. If you like symphony X, you'll probably like this band a lot more. They don't downtune, they use seven string guitars. The guitarist is an awesome melodic soloist. he even has a couple of those 80's metal squeals thrown in there, which is the most awesome sound there is. They also have some very unique time sigs that might blow your mind if you arent careful. Unlike most prog metal vocalists, this one has quite a nice voice. the heaviest part of the cd is on the song &quot;The 7 lands of sin&quot; at 9 minutes 30 seconds. my jaw dropped to the floor and i nearly suffocated. its that heavy.  <br /> They cover the Zep song &quot;the immigrant song&quot; and its pretty heavy. it doesnt sound much like the original, but thats a good thing, cuz the radio killed zep.
B0001Z37HM|3.0|It is really odd that the releasing company responsible for this DVD saw fit to release it at all... it is so obscure and so, well, bad that I really wouldn't have thought it worth it. Anyway, now that it has been given a release, at least give it a rent. It certainly is one of most bizarre, misguided products of the eighties that I have ever seen, and is certainly as inept as anything else from that most unfortunate of decades. <br />Nielsen's 'anachronistic'(?) mullet hairstyle is a scream (as is Bergman's face plate-thingy)- as a matter of fact, most of the 'artsy' touches in this film are worth a good chucle or two. Absolutely horrible : ) !

Even though it is an &quot;adolescent&quot; book and I am 22, it still speaks to me in many ways. I first read it because several people said i reminded them of Charlie and I see a lot of him in myself. The great thing about this book is that so many people can relate to it, especially those peopel who are disenfrachised and who have been shunned to the sides of 'popularity' and 'The A-crowd.' As a side note, I gave this to my best friend for Christmas and he says it is what made him become a reader.

0735619670|5.0|It was a pleasure to find out that this book had been updated when I reads news of it. CC2 is a great one-stop 'place' to go to when you want a great excuse to apply Stephen Covey's 'Sharpen The Saw' principle. This updated version has some solid, fantastic, expert instruction on designing from scratch, whether it's OO, writing better routines, psuedocode, nested loops, or at the higher level: agile methods, etc..<br /> McConnell's approach of talking to you, the programmer, is ideal: not too much humor, and an easy to read, but professional approach in the way he donates the contents of his brain: i.e. McConnell's lengthy experience in the field.<br /><br /> I read just a couple of paragraphs in a chapter before work one morning, and the advice I picked up saved so much time that same day. And it wasn't even specific to coding instruction. It was a piece of advice on a philosophy on how he personally determines how much upfront design he should settle on before coding.<br /><br />Reading Software Construction material of this caliber, as compared to some, yet another, new book on a specific language that might look impressive to know, is what makes for a solid programmer.<br /><br /> Refreshing your overall S/W construction knowledge gives you so much more of your life back, because you will have way less bugs and a lot more fun maintaining the high-quality code you are now writing because of CC2.<br /> I mentioned already that he covers OO, but I wanted to emphasize the excellent material he offers in this area. I am now seeing the benefit of measuring the quality of your classes by this guideline: are they true Abstract Data Types. ( rather than just trying to use the syntax that the language provides to its potential).<br /> Great job on a rather thorough re-write of a S/W development staple.
B000002OMN|4.0|Even though Meatloaf has released about ten studio albums, only this one and its predecessor could be described as commerically &quot;very successful.&quot; My theory is that people really LOVE Meatloaf...but only when they're sure he's about to give them what they want. And what they obviously want are the bombastic songs that are helmed under the _Bat Out of Hell_ name. <br />  <br /> _Bat Out of Hell II_ is full of the typical Steinman songwriting--grand and extended song structures, passionate lyrical cliches, double entendrees and crescendos, and walls of vocals. Most know &quot;I Would Do Anything For Love (But I Won't Do That),&quot; and it holds up today as well as it did in '93. Other standout tracks are &quot;Life Is a Lemon,&quot; &quot;Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through,&quot; &quot;It Just Won't Quit,&quot; and &quot;Objects in the Rearview Mirror May Appear Closer than They Are.&quot; Heavier songs like &quot;Wasted Youth&quot; and &quot;Out of the Frying Pan&quot; are good, but the truly moving moments on the album is when Meatloaf is delivering his earnest and passionate vocals--he's truly in fine form on this album. &quot;Objects in the Rearview Mirror,&quot; written by Steinman but semi-autobiographical of Meatloaf's own life, is a beautiful and powerful song. Cynics might laugh at the notion, and sometimes I myself even consider Meatloaf to be a &quot;guilty pleasure,&quot; but you can't deny that this particular hybrid of rock-n-roll (part pop, part progressive rock, part heavy metal) is done extremely well. <br />  <br /> There's been rumors of _Bat Out of Hell III_ out there for quite some time, and if Steinman and Meatloaf are alive and well as this decade closes down, I'm sure we'll see it. In the meantime, pick up this album, sit back, and enjoy the wait.

This is the movie the Magnificent Seven was based off of! <br />  <br /> I won't go into the plot of the movie, as you can read that anywhere. I will say that if you could get your head around the Matrix and its &quot;bullet-time&quot; effects, than you can appreciate the cinematography of Samurai. The Japanese are often shown in movies as people who say alot without saying anything, and this is case in many points in the film. There is no non-stop soundtrack, there is no amazing special effects, there isn't something to always grip your attention and keep you on edge every moment. Instead, this film portrays the gritty reality of the era with intuitive storytelling.

I've had it since the fourth grade, and (unlike a lot of my other music selections from back then) I actually still listen to it. I do know that not everyone will fall in love with Alanis' 'Jagged Little Pill' the way I have, but I really believe that no matter what genre people prefer, everyone has to respect the fact that Morissette is a true talent. This is the album that skyrocketed the singer-songwriter into worldwide fame and fortune. And, although she's yet to outdo her sales for 'Jagged Little Pill' (and probably never will), that success plays a large part in continuing to keep Morissette's follow-up albums on the charts. <br />  <br /> The album starts with 'All I Really Want', it's filled with emotion as Alanis lets us all know (surprise!) what she really wants. The song seems to be directed at a lover who doesn't quite understand why his girlfriend seems to be so crazy (&quot;I'm like Estella/I like to reel it in and then spit it out/I'm frustrated by your apathy&quot;). The second song on 'Jagged Little Pill', and the first single to drop from it, is 'You Oughta Know'. This track is about an ex who's now with another woman. Keeping within the theme of the album, this is another angry, emotionally-charged number putting Alanis at the top of a lot of people's &quot;Wow, is this chick pissed off, or what?&quot; lists. 'Perfect' is the first slow song on the album and it's sung from the point of view of demanding parents. With lyrics like &quot;If you're flawless, then you'll win my love&quot; and &quot;That simply wasn't good enough/To make us proud&quot;, it's hard to tell whether Alanis possibly wrote the song about her own family life, or if it's merely a critique pointing a finger at other critical parents. <br />  <br /> 'Hand In My Pocket' is one of the only songs off of 'Jagged Little Pill' in which Alanis doesn't seem upset at anyone. True, she doesn't sound overly excited about life in it either, but the lyrics are among the more positive and optimistic ones on the album. She basically states that no one has life &quot;all figured out just yet&quot; but in the end, everything will &quot;be quite alright&quot;. The fifth track, 'Right Through You', is among my favourites from this CD. It starts out quite slowly before gradually slipping into another anger-filled song where Alanis croons out her angst-y lyrics in her unique not-quite-but-almost-yelling voice. 'Forgiven' is, oddly enough, actually about going to church. Morissette reminisces about all the times she went to church when she was younger. Reflecting on her choir days, confession, and (of course) famous Catholic guilt. The seventh track, 'You Learn' basically goes through the fact that, no matter what you do, you'll end up learning a lesson at the end of the day. It has very simple music and very simple lyrics to match. It's also the track which contains the album's title (&quot;Swallow it down (what a jagged little pill)/It feels so good (swimming in your stomach)/Wait until the dust settles&quot;). <br />  <br /> 'Head Over Feet' is my very favourite song on 'Jagged Little Pill'. Although it's quite a bit different than the other tracks (definitely not as angry), it fits surprisingly well into the album. It's quite slow, and deals with a lover who (amazingly enough) Alanis doesn't despise. Right after 'Head Over Feet' is another slow song, 'Mary Jane' deals with a girl going through emotional difficulties, and it's actually made me cry a couple times (that's a big feat, considering I have a heart of stone). 'Ironic' is probably one of Alanis' most famous songs ever. It's not slow, but it's not exactly fast either. It's extremely simple, yet I don't think I've ever met anyone who doesn't know at least a portion of the lyrics off by heart. My favourite line? &quot;And life has a funny way of helping you out when/You thing everything's gone wrong and everything blows up in your face&quot;. Moving away from the &quot;slow&quot; songs, 'Not The Doctor' is another great track. It's got great lyrics about not wanting to be the person who's relied on for fixing what someone else has screwed up. <br />  <br /> Nearing the end of the album, 'Wake Up' is an absolutely fabulous song. I am really not exaggerating when I refer to it as flawless. Take the first verse for example,  <br />  <br /> &quot;You like snow but only if it's warm <br /> You like rain but only if it's dry <br /> No sentimental value to the rose that fell on your floor <br /> No fundamental excuse for the granted I'm taken for&quot; <br />  <br /> No matter how many times I hear it, I know it will never grow old. The alternate take of 'You Oughta Know' is no different than the original other than the secret track that's found at the very end of it. Personally, I completely love the hidden track. It was done with no background music at all, and it really allows Alanis' singing talent to shine through. You thought all she could do was scream? Listen to this track, then try to argue that point. It's about visiting her current beau's house (without permission) and finding a letter from another woman there. It really is a great song, I'm very happy that they decided to include it. <br />  <br /> All in all, as previously stated, I definitely recommend Alanis Morissette's 'Jagged Little Pill' to anyone and everyone. It's an absolute masterpiece that no CD collection should be without. It was the second CD I ever bought, and I've never looked back. I know every lyric, every melody, every pitch... it's fantastic. <br />  <br /> THE FINAL VERDICT: 100%
B0001NBMBC|3.0|As others have already said, Subliminal Verses does not live up the the precedent set by Iowa. Iowa pushed the envelope by almost going death metal, while Vol. 3 is more like a heavier Stone Sour. It has grown on me since the initial disappointment wore off, but if you only liked Slipknot because they were almost death metal, you probably aren't going to like this. The one thing that is an improvement is that there are way more guitar leads, possibly owing to Rick Rubin's influence. I can just see him going &quot;C'mon, let's do a solo, Mick. Use that whammy bar. Do it For Kerry King.&quot; Otherwise the production is kind of thin - think God Hates Us All with less bass on the double bass. I don't hate it but it's not great. Some of the catchy stuff is cool but it's overdone. Iowa is still my favorite.
6305508550|5.0|This is a must see. One of the best comedies of all time. I know I will catch grief for this, but I put this up there with &quot;Blazing Saddles,&quot; as far as making me laugh goes.
0783230893|5.0|I love this movie.  I watched it and fell in love with Idgie and Ruth, both wonderfully quirky and southern.  I'd marry either in a heartbeat and count my blessings.   <br /> <br />The rendering is faithful in many ways to Flagg's book: Whistle Stop teems with life in all its contradictions, the actors portrayals are flawless (especially Masterson's of Idgie), the screenplay is spot-on (probably because Flagg assisted), and the artistry is close to that of the book's (anecdotal flashbacks).  That the directors found a town in Georgia and not Alabama doesn't matter.  We are transported to a special and endearing place in time, and we want to stay.   <br /> <br />Everything about this movie works.  Watch it and enjoy.
6304711905|5.0|Tombstone is a really slick movie, it comes alive with action and emotion. Very accurate in it's attention to detail. Colorful customes and the actors play their characters as if they were &quot;them&quot; ,definitely well chosen for the parts they played. I was revited to the screen the first time I saw the movie. The electricity between Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell) and Josephine Marcus was quite evident and added a hint of mystery and expectation. The detail of Doc Holiday (Val Kilmer) was quite believable, as his role of the &quot;ill&quot; gambler, a very interesting complex character! This movie is entertaining and exciting, although bloody in some parts but realistic!
0804115613|5.0|This is delightful fare. Flagg succeeds wonderfully in giving life to a small southern town and the people who inhabit it. Idgie is a fine creation, as ornery and as endearing as Huck Finn, and equally untainted by the opinions of others.  <br />  <br /> As other reviewers have noted, following the sequence of events can be tricky, even with the dated chapters that serve as markers. Still, the inventiveness of anecdote, 3rd person narration, and newspaper stories gives greater understanding to our view of this time and place. <br />  <br /> I read the book after seeing the movie (VHS version) and then traveling to Juliette, Georgia, where the movie was filmed. The combination offered an enriching and engaging experience that I wish others could share. The story goes that &quot;they&quot; searched and searched to find a southern town close to Flagg's Whistle Stop ... and they triumphed when they chanced upon Juliette. While it is probably smaller than Flagg's conception, overall it works, especially the cafe. <br />  <br /> What order you choose shouldn't matter. The movie faithfully renders the book, often using the exact words in dialogue. Flagg's ear is that good. Some may find it easier to follow the storyline of the book after seeing the movie. Whatever your choice, don't miss the tasty delights this book and movie deliver. They're wonderful. Flagg deserves the notoriety this book has granted her. She's a welcome storyteller. Her comic touch is sheer genius at times, and Igie's and Ruth's love for one another is heartwarming.
B00003CWL6|5.0|The power of this film is such that when, during my first viewing, someone said something stupid (&quot;Whooo!&quot; or &quot;Sweet!&quot; or something) when Angela opens her shirt, I honestly wanted to smack him. A rather disturbing story of lust, near statutory rape, adultery, murder, and drugs on the surface, this movie is really about escaping the drudgery of the prison-like existance which many lives, even those of the wildest college students, become upon reaching middle age and becoming part of suburbia. It is also about finding the beauty in the unnatural, the trashy, the stupid, the superficial, and the tragic. Really, the movie is best described by it's multi-level title: American Beauty, the rose which is a recurring image, the vacuous teenaged cheerleader/slut, the suburban landscape, and a piece of trash, floating in the wind. The film itself is perhaps the greatest piece of American Beauty that ever I've seen.
B000002UAU|5.0|There's probably not much new to say about this album except that I love it and know this is a 5-star release. I first heard most of the tracks from Sgt. Pepper on a 4-track machine called &quot;The Hipster&quot; which played a propreitory tape format called &quot;Playtape&quot;. It was like a small version of 8 track tape and held only about 20 minutes worth of music. That said the 4 songs from Sgt. Pepper that was featured on this tape were the title track and segue into &quot;With a Little Help From My Friends&quot;, &quot;Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds&quot; and I think &quot;Being For the Benefit of Mr, Kite.&quot; I was a mere 10 year old when this was first out, but I was already hooked to The Beatles.<br /><br /> I got to listen to the other tracks later in life and eventually bought the album on vinyl. Over the years it has grown to be one of my all time favorite Beatles album. This is a real brassy and classy concept album, a must have for every music collection.
B000001Y16|5.0|1st track on tha album .. listen to the intro when u hear a lil' static .. u can hear 2pac going &quot;SUGE SHOT ME&quot; .. try it outt .. put the volume high n u can hear it .. freaky!
B000001DQI|5.0|I like this album so much that I own 3 copies on LP, a copy on 8-track, a few copies on cassette, and 2 different releases on CD. This is Elton John's all time stellar masterpiece, the zenith of his and Bernie's musical career.<br /><br /> Here you got a great collection of straight on rock (Funeral For a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding, Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting) to great ballads like &quot;Candle in the Wind,&quot; &quot;Harmony,&quot; and the title track, &quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road.&quot; &quot;Bennie and the Jets&quot; is pure pop genius, an unforgettable piece with a funky little beat and a very memorable hook.<br /><br /> What made this album special besides the great music within was the original album packaging and graphics, complete with a sketch or logo that went along with the lyrics to every song and credits for every musician playing on this tightly produced opus. Elton and his band were in stellar form here.<br /><br /> &quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot; is an album not to be missed!
B00005JMJ4|3.0|Fine but over hyped comedy that is good if you are looking for something different but boring if you don't expect it. Bill Murray is fine in his role but the movie just drags along to its end. Worth a look but don't expect the great movie that some made it out to be.  <br /> <br />
B00005MAM2|4.0|Having first watched this movie on the Action Channel, I was left feeling somewhat dreary. A few days later,I rented the VHS Akira and watched it again... a mistake. The quality was horrible on the VHS version, so I am really thankful they remastered and redubbed it for the DVD version. The anime itself has a good plot, but tends to be on the creepy and pessimistic side. However, there was one thing that bothered me... the story had a few bits and ends missing. The reason: Akira originated as a manga, so the important details were not transfered onto the movie counterpart. I recommend you read the manga after watching the movie to catch up on some key details, such as... After his accident, Tetsuo was not simply kidnapped by the military and experimented with, as the movie portrays. He took a pill dropped by one of the sick children, so that's why he was taken by the military. <br />Overall, Akira is a great anime to start a collection with, but be warned, if you can only stomach the light hearted animes, do not purchase this DVD.
0156027321|4.0|Who would have thought a whole novel could be written about a boy and a tiger stranded at sea in a lifeboat? Somehow, Martel did just that, and did a good job at it. The ordeal that Pi and Richard Parker (the tiger) go through is vividly described, as they slowly waste away in the hot sun, thirsty and hungry during their seven and a half months at sea. The reader can feel the desperation and depression of their situation. Even though Pi's religious views play a small part in his castaway ordeal, the early part of the novel dealing with his religious awakening seems out of place and awkward in the story. But the other focus of the begining of the novel - describing zoo culture - is pretty interesting, along with Pi's ongoing explanations of animal behavior, particularly that of tigers. All in all, this was a pretty interesting book.
B000286S8S|5.0|Best Of Both Worlds is the superlative collection of Van Halen's greatest hits. The collection combines not only their biggest hit singles like &quot;Jump&quot;, &quot;Why Can't This Be Love&quot; and &quot;When It's Love&quot; but favorite album cuts like &quot;...And The Cradle Will Rock&quot;, &quot;Unchained&quot; and &quot;Beautiful Girls&quot;. Set over two disks, the album far outweighs the band's previous greatest hits collection, 1996's Best Of Volume 1, which was a single disk and let off too many key tracks. The album offers three new tracks, &quot;It's About Time&quot;, &quot;Up For Breakfast&quot; and &quot;Learning To See&quot;, which are merely okay. The one negative about the album is the fact that the compilation was put together to promote the tour which features Sammy Hagar rejoining the band and in the animosity towards David Lee Roth that is clearly harbored by the band. Mr. Roth is featured in no photos and is mentioned only in passing in the linear notes. Also, the live versions of three songs sung originally by Mr. Roth, &quot;Panama&quot;, &quot;Jump&quot; & &quot;Ain't Talkin' &quot;Bout Love&quot; are all from the band's 1993 live album and feature Mr. Hagar on vocals. It's just a little bit petty by the Van Halen brothers and Michael Anthony to not give him any credit. Mr. Roth was a driving force behind the band's rise to superstar status and most people consider the time he was in the group to be their definitive version. That being said, Best Of Both Worlds is a first rate compilation and shows why Van Halen ranks as one of the greatest hard rock bands in history.
B0001ADB8C|5.0|Unlike a lot of reviewers, I understand _Gone Troppo_. It's a sunny album, with a funky post-psychedelic sound, and for god sakes, it's George. Other people find different solo albums to pan ~ but honestly, I can't understand why the guy was so often accused of mediocrity. When I listen to *any* George Harrison album, I hear the genius Beatle that moved freakin' Frank Sinatra with &quot;Something&quot;. My point is that George Harrison is consistently underrated, despite the fact that he's a legendary talent that stands as an admired equal with Dylan, Lennon, McCartney, et al. Some will call that overrating ~ I think they have tin ears.<br /><br /> George Harrison's work demands a mellow, open state of mind: someone that enjoys the complex stylistics of a post-Beatle. Besides FaaB and RL from the Anthologies, we'll never know what a Beatle reunion would have sounded like. Instead, we have the many volumes of Beatle solo work, all of it excellent, to prod our imaginations. To that end, the vastly improved sound quality in the _Dark Horse Years_ collection is a consciousness expanding experience for anyone that wants to go deeper inside the mind that gave us so many memorable songs on the Apple label. Consider it a connoisseur's collection.<br /><br /> As for the question of buying the discs individually or in the box set: obviously, it takes a big fan to shell out a hundred bucks for anything musical. It all comes down to what you value. Personally, I think the DVD, book, and Live SACD are worth the price by themselves. Although it is a more subtly and beautifully assembled box set than the mind-blowing _Lennon Anthology_, it does lack the half-baked rarities and private conversations that are so cherished by hardcore Beatle-students. The Harrison rarities collection is coming soon, apparently, but in the meantime, any fan of the Beatles' *music* (as opposed to their faddish popularity) should give _Dark Horse Years_ a chance. George's was the most exquisitely produced and carefully composed body of work by an ex-Beatle, even though it wasn't as copious and popular as Paul's, or as poignant and direct as John's.y produced and carefully composed body of work by an ex-Beatle, even though it wasn't as copious and popular as Paul's, or as poignant and direct as John's.
B00008EY65|5.0|I saw this movie FOUR TIMES in the theater.  And it was still fantastic on the fourth viewing.  As far as movies-made-from-comic-books go, this is one of the best (I'd say it was even better than Spiderman 2, but I might be lynched :)
B00005NNMK|5.0|This isn't their best, but it is their most well-known. Every song on here is a total winner. If you're just getting started into the scene, look for their new album \\"Start From The Dark\\" due out 09/23/04. Don't be fooled by looks. They ROCK!!!
B00003CXI1|5.0|My kids and I will pop this movie in, make some homemade pizza, and have a blast.  I can whistle the theme song and they both drop everything and come running. The older one is only 2, so what does that tell you? It means that it's not too scary, not too complicated, and interesting enough for their rapidly changing attention spans to hang on to.  It's a great match to the book because it capture the innocence and naivete of Harry, Ron, and Hermione, and it does a great job of introducing the audience to the characters, the conflict, and the setting of the Harry Potter series. These young actors have done a great job of nailing down the characters, Alan Rickman was born to be Snape, and Dame Maggie Smith IS fabulous. This movie was viewed in VHS format so frequently it quit working right so we bought the DVD to replace it. That has been viewed so often that the box is an absolute wreck.
B00005JM02|5.0|My whole family loves this movie. My older boy (a toddler) just jumps up and down during some scenes. We have the little toys that came with the meals at one of the fast food places. He knows everyone's name! He pretends like he's swimming around the house. He dances and says OOOh OOh ah just like in the initiation scene in the fishtank everytime the bath water runs. The animation is stupefying. There are some scenes that I believe are flat out real pictures and not animation. That's how good this is. The colors are unbelievably vivid. The storyline has enough twists and turns to keep a hula hoop up. The characters are believable and likeable. This is a good choice.  Watch for the Mike character from Monster's Inc. <br />
B000002UWP|5.0|Joyride is a masterpiece of carefully crafted Poprock. 14 Songs by the brilliant Per Gessle and Marie Fredriksson, written about Love, Pain, Lust, Sorrow, Joy and Life wrapped into a really tight production, with hooks literally out of this world, Guitar Riffs driving the tempo up and perfected use of synthesizers, and some excellent vocals. <br />  <br /> Songs like the fiery &quot;Hotblooded&quot;, the wonderful &quot;Fading Like a Flower&quot;, the sweet and tuned down &quot;Spending my Time&quot;, more accoustic pieces like &quot;Watercolors in the Rain&quot; and &quot;Church of your Heart&quot;, to incredible songs like my personal favorite &quot;(Do you get) Excited?&quot;, &quot;Things will never be the Same&quot; and the final beatiful &quot;Perfect Day&quot; is examples and more importantly, proof that there is(at least was) just ONE king of Poprock, Roxette. <br />  <br /> There isnt a SINGLE bad song on this album. Even the songs I didnt mention like the megahit &quot;Joyride&quot;, &quot;Knockin` on Every Door&quot; and the sexual ladden &quot;Physical Fascination&quot; are really good, although not quite as nailed down as the earlier mentioned ones. It mostly depends on what Roxette you like. Being more of a Powerballad Lover, the earlier songs fit my style far more than the latter and not mentioned songs, but apart from that, they are all stunning. <br />  <br /> This, is a perfect CD to listen to while traveling in the Car a hot summers day, maybe with the one you love. Its music that allows you to just dream away and open up and embrace the good things in life, because thats what the album is about. Enjoying the life, overcoming the sorrow and getting back up.  <br />  <br /> I can recommend the earlier relased &quot;Look Sharp!&quot; where Roxette was on the brink of mastering Pop Rock. Unfortunately, they have disappointed in all their later albums, &quot;Tourism&quot; was a good album with some real gems but overall nothing ordinary, &quot;Crash!Boom! Bang!&quot; was a crossroad where they started to loose the hooks and the melodies that they once mastered, but they still had some great songs, but they lost it all on &quot;Have a Nice Day&quot;, their worst album, followed up by the Mediocre &quot;Room Service&quot;. If you are to grab just ONE Roxette album, &quot;Joyride&quot; is the perfect choice, followed by their Collection &quot;Dont Bore Us, Get to the Chorus&quot; which includes the wonderful &quot;Almost Unreal&quot;.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Joss is great in everything he creates but when I saw this I was blown away.  I hope everyone in the world sees this show and sees the depth it contains.  Joss puts all other shows to shame.  He has set the standard for my television watching and nothing else stands up.
B0001Z52RU|4.0|I hadn't taken much notice of this film when it was in theaters, but after it came out on DVD, many folks I knew rented and saw it, all, without exception, proclaiming it to be &quot;a good movie.&quot; <br /> Well, that meant I had to see it as well. I was not disappointed. <br />  <br /> The plot revolves around Evan (Ashton Kucher) a psychology major in college, whose childhood was plagued by blackouts. Although psychologists and neuroscientists can find nothing physically wrong with him, they suggest Evan keep journals to catalogue his daily doings and perhaps pin down the source of the blackouts. His last blackouts occur at approximately the age of 13, and he is then blackout-free until he reaches college.  <br />  <br /> One night, however, he is cajoled into reading one of his old journals, and perhaps serendipitously, randomly selects a particularly traumatic and gruesome episode from his past. He is transported back in time - to age 13, with a sudden awareness that he can do this at will and alter the past. Of course, Evan tries to right all the wrongs that he let go on in his past, all with the best of intentions, but unfortunately, each seemingly small alteration to the past that Evan, age 13 does, has exponentially multiplying consequences for Evan, age 20. <br />  <br /> Ultimately, this movie is sort of a more violent and darker version of the time-travel themes explored in the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; movies, or the TV series &quot;Sliders.&quot; I believe even an episode of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; was similar in concept. Overall, a very watchable movie, if you're into sci-fi and time-travel.
B0001MDP3G|1.0|I saw this movie when it came out in theaters. If you want to know more about the reality of the Civil War watch Gone With The Wind. If it's up to me, I'd give this movie no stars because it gives our troops a bad name. There's nothing that justifies desertion. This movie could have been a lot better if Inman never deserted. The fact that he was a deserter and Ada was encouraging him to desert made me not want to root for them.
6305842442|5.0|I cant believe that you cannot find the original theatrical version on DVD. As for the Directors cut of this movie, you seemed to have taken an awesome movie and turned it into a movie that,of course, is still great, but not as good. I think Harrisons narrative makes the movie. BRING THE ORIGINAL BACK!
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|I like the upbeat music of Franz Ferdinand, this CD has been playing non-stop in my car since I got it. &quot;Take Me Out&quot; and &quot;Darts of Pleasure&quot; are great and I especially like the loopy bass groove on &quot;Tell her Tonight&quot;, the quirky lyrics on &quot;The Dark of the Matinee&quot; and the percussion on &quot;This Fire&quot;. The whole package is cool, kind of like the Beatles meets Weezer with a touch of N*E*R*D. The instrumentation, the lyrics and the delivery are tight - the band wrote and produced much of the disc - I look forward to hearing more from Franz Ferdinand.
0515123447|4.0|Lee Child writes what is known as muscular prose; short, choppy sentences which are blunt, relatively undescriptive and hit you like repeated rabbit punches as you read. It's a style that works on occasion, and this book is one time that I must confess that I did enjoy it. His main character Reacher is a little too Rambo for my liking---a giant who kills every bad guy with a single punch and never even comes close to getting hurt himself. His secondary characters are a little too cliche', and his plots are less than amazing (I've read 2 of his books and both times the plot has been something that's been done a million times). Still, though, his books make for an enjoyable read-it-and-then-forget-about-it diversion, like eating a whole bag of potato chips while watching reruns on TV. Short on substance but long on action, and Mr. Child always seems to have a good working knowledge of his subject matter. I would have given three stars but some extra-bad bad guys and good suspense scenes bumped this review up to 4.
B0001MDP3G|2.0|I can't believe I wasted 154 minutes of my life watching this horrible movie! Unbelievably predicatable story-line and boring charaters. Mocking Renee's impersonation of the son from King of the Hill was the only entertainmet!
B0000C6E4D|5.0|The third studio-recorded album, fifth album in the running. Touch, Solace, Fumbling Towards Ecstasy, and Surfacing were the albums that defined Sarah McLachlan as she developed and evolved as the artist we all know and love. Afterglow is another album in the order that should not be denied the same attention give to others.      It is true that this album does not provide the same grit and rock that Fumbling Torwards Ecstasy gave the world... but this isn't called Fumbling Towards Ecstasy, Again now is it? It sure isn't, as was shown by her following album, Surfacing, which proved to be yet another powerful album. Different from Fumbling Towards Ecstasy yes, but better or worse no. Fumbling Towards Ecstasy may have set Sarah into the spotlight of what a true artist is, but a true artist continues to create new music, in a driven state to re-invent and create original sound. Her albums get more and more calmer, if that's the right word. I found Fumbling Towards Ecstasy full of her raw, depressed lyrics from the heart. Surfacing is like she is literally surfacing to the world and seeing the beauty of love. Afterglow seems to be talking about the quiet and calmness of solidarity yet still laced with bitter thoughts. Sarah's albums are each unique in sound, as Afterglow demonstrates itself.       As Sarah does help create her own music and write her own lyrics, her music will inevitably change over the years as her life itself does change as well. From Sarah's own words:       &quot;When anyone asks 'Why did it take so long in between records?'&quot; Sarah explains, unhesitatingly, &quot;The answer is that I was just living my life. I lost a mother and I became a mother. Almost a year after having India, I walked away from music for a few months. I didn't play my piano, I didn't open up my journals, I just really needed to let go of all the pressures and the expectations of 'it's been so long...gotta get this record out' stuff. I felt paralyzed. Taking a break and walking away was the best thing I could have done. I came back to it with fresh ears, listened to the tracks, and I realized that it was all sounding really good and to finish it didn't seem impossible anymore. That's my truth. It's honest, and it brought me to a much happier place. I'm loving music again.&quot; (sarahmclachlan.com)      Another interesting fact about this album is that she did not write a single song on the guitar, it was all written while on the piano.      Her life is in these songs, as can be described by emotions evoked by Fallen, and Stupid. Push is one of her more joyful songs describing the love between her and her husband, Ashwin Sood (percussions).      A much more softer-toned album, but not any less quality than previous albums. Taking you from the sad tones of Fallen, to the familiarity of World on Fire, from the blissful yet chaotic times of Stupid, to times of being that Perfect Girl... this album showcases not only her talent, but her life as well.      I was personally fortunate enough to experience her live on her Afterglow Tour of 2004; her songs came truly alive with the true sounds of her songs. Listening to her album again really livened up the songs.      The glow remains even after listening to Afterglow...
B000002UAX|4.0|The Beatles pretty much became wandering souls after Brian Epstien's death the previous summer. Paul tried to assert his leadership over the others, and they(especially John) resented it very much. George and Ringo were also writing, and wanted more say in the group. The group was starting to break the mold, and each member saw themselves as a separate person. Is it possible that the Marharisi had more of an effect on them than the group would give credit for? I can't say. I do know that the year 1968 was a rather edgy one for the group as John divorced his wife Cynthia as his relationship with Yoko Ono blossomed, Paul was shortly engaged to his girlfriend Jane Asher, but by the end of the year it was off as Paul found his soulmate in Linda Eastman. Ringo had his second child a son named Jason, and George still had Patti. However, the comaderie was dying. The Beatles released a song called &quot;Hey Jude&quot; which would go #1 by the fall, and become the longest to stay at #1 at 9 weeks, but the fact that the single was 7 minutes, and 11 seconds long was showing that the Beatles could do anything. While &quot;Hey Jude&quot; was at #1 they began work on this album, and here's where the fun begins. Ringo would walk out on the group for a week, and Yoko would become more of a visible prescence in the studio, and her avant garde style of music would end up on the album as &quot;Revolution #9&quot; Pretty much a bunch of sound clips put together, but gained notority as the fad of &quot;Paul Is Dead&quot; was starting to climax. According to legend if this was played backwards you would hear the line &quot;Turn Me On Dead Man&quot;. Alot of arguing went on to keep this off the album. The rest shows alot of different directions. There was an animal element throughout it all though. &quot;Blackbird&quot; a folk song take off of &quot;Blue Bird&quot; from Buffalo Springfield I suppose. I mean CSNY did &quot;Blackbird&quot; at a concert at the Fillmore East June of 70. Thenthere was &quot;Everybody's Got Something To Hide Except For Me and My Monkey&quot;. It was about as heavy as the Beatles had got, and I know I would like to record thier version of this song along with Fats Domino's version released a year later on &quot;Fats Is Back&quot;, and see what would happen if recorded while played simultaneously. &quot;Rocky Raccoon&quot; tale of woman doing man wrong, &quot;Martha My Dear&quot; Paul pays homage to his sheep dog. Ringo would use his lone contribution of songwriting with &quot;Don't Pass Me By&quot;, and use it to feul the &quot;Paul Is Dead&quot; rumors. With the line &quot;You were in a car crash&quot;, and photos inside the album of Paul, and what he looked like after the crash feuled it indeed. George brought along a friend also as his buddy Eric Clapton would help out with &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;, and he would take a shot at the &quot;Paul Is Dead&quot; rumor with crying out &quot;Paul Paul&quot; at the end, then there were &quot;Piggies&quot; which was cute little fable song talking about &quot;THE ESTABLISHMENT&quot;. However, George's finest hour was on &quot;Savoy Truffle&quot;. A hard rock song with horns, and believe you me they got down on this, but good. There was also some good old rock and roll too; &quot;Back In The USSR&quot; payed homage to thier idol Chuck Berry, and Berry would return the favor by suing John the next year for plagurism, and &quot;Birthday&quot; which was inspired by watching a 1950's movie &quot;The Girl Can't Help It&quot;. &quot;Happiness Is A Warm Gun&quot; should've been used by the NRA to appeal to the young adults, and thier rights to bear arms, and then there's the hard side where John gets down with &quot;Yer Blues&quot;, and this is absolute punk where it talks about &quot;Suicide&quot;, and then Paul tries to outdo John with &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;, but the interesting part is on this song it's Ringo's first time on guitar. &quot;Revolution #1&quot; is a somewhat unplugged version of &quot;Revolution&quot; the flipside of &quot;Hey Jude&quot;. John also begins to deal with the pain of not having his mom Julia around by writing a song simply called &quot;Julia&quot;, and 2 years later he lets it all out with the song &quot;Mother&quot; on his first album with the group the Plastic Ono Band. I could go on forever with this, but it must end somehow, and I feel it should end with a lullabye, and that's what you get at the end of the album &quot;Goodnight&quot;. Critics said it was irratic, and disorganized; well by this point so was the band as they were going through a metamorphisis of individuality.
0385512104|4.0|The book is written in a semi-diarist style. The supposed author of the book is a very high-functioning 15 year-old autistic child. We follow him as he tries to find out who killed the neighbours dog. Our hero has an incredible memory for detail, but is unable to empathize or step back from these details and thus handicaps him in daily living. There were some minor inconsistencies in style to enable the story move forward a bit quicker and I thought that the author wrote himself into a corner (to create some suspense) at one point that he did not get out of too convincingly.<br /><br />If you liked this story I would suggest reading Flowers for Algernon.
B00000J7J4|5.0|This is a great cd. One of the best songs on here is &quot;Smooth&quot; featuring Rob Thomas from Matchbox 20. If you don't have this album, get it. It's one of Santana's best. So get it today!
0553274503|5.0|What marks this story out is not only the incredible story idea but also the clever way it is told. Structured in the form of a diary, you immediatley engage with the hero and are sucked into his perspective of the world. Stories of this quality are rarely written, simply excellent.
B00005JKCH|4.0|This is one heck of a good movie. I LOVE the Spider-Man movies. Even the animated ones. Peter Parker is an ordinary high school graduate until a field trip to a spider mueseum. One of the spiders on exhibit is missing. While Peter is taking pictures, it bites him. Now he becomes Spider-Man! Peter's friend's dad, Norman Osbourne is the bad guy, The Green Goblin. Now it is up to Spider-Man to kill the goblin and save the city! <br /> <br />Rated: PG-13 For Action Violence. <br /> <br />Running Time: 121 Minutes.
0743243153|5.0|I cannot think of a better manual for life, its principles applicable to everything from the tiniest minutiae to the most important decisions you will make during your days on earth.  It is a compelling, at times overwhelming, collection of experience, anecdotes, and wisdom; if read with a willing mind and heart, it will change your life. <br /> <br />Dr. Peck brilliantly does in this work exactly what he compels the reader to do, which is to express consciously that which is normally hidden under many layers of denial, confusion, or downright lies.  He tells us the many things that we already know about life, and we immediately recognize them as true, yet somehow the ideas themselves seem novel, and at times foreign or impossible. <br /> <br />I recommend this book if you have ever stepped foot into an incompetent therapist's office, if you know there are things you should do that you just don't (and don't know why), or simply if you are yearning for direction in your spiritual growth.  Don't try to read it cover-to-cover; take it in pieces, and its deeper meaning will reveal itself to you.
B0001ADAVK|3.0|Just a little too over the top for my taste--but kept your interest due to the beautiful clothese and goofy social constraints.  THese are the scenes that the REpublicans want to take us back to.  Watch this film so that you will be sufficiently scared and outraged at the thought.  I ought to know, I spent my childhood in that world!
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Yeah and this is what they call it modern music do they?With britney using her sex instead of her talent (which she has none).How can u guys be soooo stupid as to listen to songs on an album which have no meaning no lyrics at all.My dears grow up...you want good music listen to Pink Floyd..Listen to Beatles...Listen to Bruce Springsteen...Listen to U2...Listen to Nirvana...Listen to Bob Dylan....It's a pity that Pink Floyd and Beatles have stopped making music....and that Kurt (Cobain)was killed by tht b**** Courtney Love because in the Generation X if there was one man who proved that days of good music are not over it was Kurt..Even if u don't wanna listen to old stuff buy modern classics like Bruce Springsteen who still rocks or U2 or Oasis (The next Beatles) or Coldplay (the next U2) or DMB or Alanis Morisette or Tracy Chapman ...why waste money on idiots like Britney,Enrique,Christina (Can anyone tell me whats the meaning of the song Genie in a bottle) or Simple Plan or rappers like Tipsy,Ludacris, and others which have no music talent but have only naked girls in their videos...Come on man rise up.... <br />As to speak of this album ....nothing much..lyrics are nonsense (if u don't believe me go to any lyrics site and read em)music is ok (2/10 stars just coz of the music of Me against the music) THIS ALBUM IS TOTALLY A WASTE ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE WHO LISTEN TO LEGENDS LIKE PINK FLOYD,BOB DYLAN,THE BEATLES OR BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN. <br /> <br />P.S.- Compare the lyrics :- <br />Pink Floyd (wish you were here) <br />'We are just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl <br />Year after year, running over the same ground <br />What have we found,the same old fears <br />Wish you were here' <br /> <br />Britney Spears (Toxic) <br />'With a taste of your lips <br />I'm on a ride <br />You're toxic <br />I'm slipping under <br />With a taste of poison paradise <br />I'm addicted to you <br />Don't you know that you're toxic' <br /> <br />
1592400876|1.0|The joke is the catcher here.  People buy this book thinking clever jokes will help them learn proper punctuation.  But Truss herself makes several punctuation errors in this book.  And differences of opinion about correct punctuation exist among editors all over this country and Great Britain.  What to do?  Read Strunk and White's Elements of Style.  Read Louis Menand's review of Truss in The New Yorker.  Study the punctuation style in a text for the audience you wish to impress.  OK, you can read the back of Truss' book for the joke.  Just don't buy it.
0782008372|5.0|OK, I do not regret buying this DVD at all.  I mean, it was great to finally have an explanation as to who Rachael is in regards to Conner.  It was great to also see all the other small scenes that are missing from previous versions.  The directors commentary is also interesting, BUT WHAT IS UP WITH THE SOUND?????  It was very frustrating to watch.  1 minute it's too low, the next minute it's too high.  You strain to hear dialogue (sometimes you don't hear it at all) and when you do hear it, it gets overpowered by the background noise and the music.  Oh well, instead of constantly altering the volume on my remote I just put it on low and turned on the close captioning.  Hmmm..anyone else have this problem?
B0002CTSW2|5.0|As a Jesus lover, my favorite movie is Jesus of Nazareth. A movie that doesn't have to be done again, Zefirelli did a Masterpiece. What Mel Gibson  brought, though, is immeasurable !  Why ? Because the only part in Jesus of Nazareth that was very good but could have gone deeper, in terms of realness, was the last days. Not because Zefirelli could have done better but more because now we are so use to violence that the end of Jesus of Nazareth doesn't touch us as much as it did. Many suggest that it is only a violent movie. It is true that if you can't very gently let it pierce you as you experience such pain, this movie is not for you yet, it wouldn't help anything. This movie is for those who are able to Be with pain as is. He give a awesome example when he talks to Mary as he transports his cross. Most beautiful !
B00028HBKM|5.0|This movie made me feel again. For so long I was starting to lose some faith in humanity - nearly falling into a mini-depression. Seems like Christmas last year was full of commercialism and idiots who didn't give a heck about the meaning. I was beginning to seclude myself away from the public because I was losing faith in them. Then about three weeks before Easter, my husband and I took the big leap into seeing this &quot;graphic, gory, and conteroversal&quot; movie that Mel Gibson directed. I sat there through the movie and did not even breathe. It was all clear to me. Jesus was the most selfless &quot;man&quot; that ever existed on the face of this planet. I began feeling again sitting right there crying and turning my head when I couldn't bear anymore, then looking again when I could make myself. Yes, it is very difficult to watch. But it was neccessary to watch.  <br />  <br /> Take in account, how many others it effected. Shortly after the movie was released, news was covering people left and right who were turning there lives over to The Lord. In one account, a man had killed his wife and staged it as a suicide: Thirty years later, after watching the Passion, he walks into a police station and turns himself in. Also, there was a teenager who was planning on copying Columbine buy bringing guns to school and shooting his classmates. The day after seeing Mel Gibson's film, he turned himself in and turned over all of his deadly weapons.  <br />  <br /> Say what you will, some with little faith. But the truth is that it touched people more that any other film ever has. Why? Becuase Mel Gibson took a leap at touching the most selfless, most loving, most giving man there ever was. My Lord and Savior who gave me eternal life because of all of the events that took place in that movie. Because he loved me and you and you so much that he gave his life up for us in the most inhumane way ever immaginable. I will take that gift with me forever. And ever and ever and ever.:)

B00005JN2F|4.0|I am a huge fan of the original movie Bourne Identity, and of course I had to see this sequel. It delivers lots of action and has all the familiar cat and mouse games, not to mention a few familiar faces from the first film. However, more chases and more complexity to the chases do not a better movie make.<br /><br /> The biggest problem with this film is the shaking camera, which was overdone and became anoying--I had to look away a few times and sometimes it was hard to see who was doing what to whom.<br /><br /> Another problem is that while there were many chases and fights, I did not feel as close to Jason Bourne as I did in the first movie. The story was not as tight this time, and some of the action felt like padding. The resolution of the mystery was not so compelling either.<br /><br /> On the plus side, Joan Allen was solid as Agent Lundy, an excellent addition to the Bourne saga. Allen was believable and compelling in her performance. Matt Damon is still the star, and he continues to shine as Bourne. The film also showcases many believable intrigues and has the feel of real life espionage, which I always appreciate in any film of this genre. It is an intelligent action story, and lives up to the original in that respect.<br /><br /> Compared to other action movies, this is as good (or better) as so many out there. But, since it is hard not to compare it to the first film, the flaws are not hard to find. While good, in other hands it might have been great.
055357342X|5.0|If you are looking for a good book, a good fantasy series and perhaps the best there ever is, at the present, this is the one to read. All of the three publications on A Song of Ice and Fire got me hooked to it right away. It all has to do with Mr Martin's style. His style is straight to the point and, what I enjoyed most, is the intriguing conversations between the characters in the series. I wouldn't say why, but reading through the conversations gives the reader a sense of realism in that the reader, really gets into the conversations. Although there are negative responses on the crude and vulgar language on which Mr Martin often uses, I do not think that it really matters. In fact, all this crude language seem to solidify these conversations, making them more realistic. <br />  <br /> Most of the characters featured in Mr Martin's book are interesting and in fact, I do get the sense that Mr Martin is not trying to project a hero or whatsoever in this series. In fact, most of the characters involved in each of his chapters do not appear to be important in their own way but more so, Mr Martin uses them as &quot;eyes&quot; to keep up with the various events occuring in the Seven Kingdoms. Davos, for example has his eye on more interesting characters, Stannis, and the Red Lady; Catelyn has her eye on Robb Stark and towards the end of this book, Mr Martin appears to relocate Catelyn somewhere else to replace Arya's vacant position. That itself, makes his approach unique, and apparently very successful. <br />  <br /> As far as the story goes, I had enjoyed every bit of it. The battle between the Red Viper and the Mountain was perhaps the best part in this book and Mr Martin did not to surprise me at the very end. This book is a must read for not only fantasy lovers but any reader in general. Read it, you'll never regret it!
B0000214F0|4.0|If you are easily bothered by sexual inuendos then this isn't the movie for you. It is partially historically accurate but I wouldn't set your history textbook aside quite yet. Many things were obviously enhanced for entertainment purposes, but this only adds to making the movie more interesting. If you're expecting a by-the-book history lesson, then this isn't the movie for you.
B000035P7X|5.0|This innovative film includes raw footage of the video for Subterrean Homesick Blues, Dylan talking to teenaged fans (that happen to have a thing for him) Dylan songs, Donovan and Dylan bonding, Bob lecturing a science student who still probably doesn't know what hit him, Joan Baez singing and Dylan ignoring her (he starts typing loudly on a typewriter while she's singing a beautiful song) You won't be dissapointed with this. An inside look at a day in the life of one of music's most infuential people. Reccomended for any Bob Dylan/Donovan/Joan Baez fan.

The text is enriched by the inclusion of design boxes which explain a few key areas in the design of various interesting aircraft. If you don't like your textbook for whatever reason, don't hesitate to get this one and it'll certainly help you understand this subject well.

B00000J2SO|4.0|Rainbow was a late 70's, early 80's melodic hard rock band led by virtuoso guitarist, Ritchie Blackmore.  He formed the group in 1975, after quitting Deep Purple who subsequently underwent a rapid demise.      Each Rainbow album featured a constantly evolving line-up of first rate musicians.  By late 1978, the band had virtually dissolved however.  Vocalist and co-writer Ronnie James Dio had left and went on to replace Ozzy at Black Sabbath. Ritchie meanwhile began looking for a new producer, singer and songwriter. He brought in ex-Deep Purple colleague, Roger Glover to help write and produce what became the Down To Earth album.     After some initial sessions with singer Pete Goalby (who went on to join Uriah Heep), Rainbow settled on Graham Bonnet.  He had an unbelievably powerful voice (being rumoured to stand a good 10 feet back from the microphone when recording his vocal tracks!).  With Down To Earth, Rainbow made their most commercial record to date, enjoying international hits with Since You Been Gone and All Night Long.  Unfortunately, Mr Bonnet's non-rock look (short hair and Hawaiian beach shirts) along with his lack of song writing contributions soon led to friction and his eventual departure from the band.      I'm disappointed we didn't get to hear Bonnet on the follow up Difficult to Cure album as was originally intended.  I started to lost interest once hearing his replacement Joe Lynn Turner on vocals.  By this time the group had begun to drift towards a radio-friendly AOR/Foreigner sound which alienated most of their early fans.
B0001IN0DA|4.0|Lets face it 2004s fist two PPVs were far from classics, but things pick up in March. The WMXX DVD boxset contains 13 matches, runs over 7 hours and over 3 beautiful disks with great packaging, making it one of the greatest WWE DVDs. <br /> <br />Big Show vs John Cena          5/10 <br />Why is Big Show still in WWE? What has he done for the company apart from being the size of a whale? Cena tried hard in this match, but Big Shows size made it hard for Cena to do much. Average opener, if you have seen SurSer2003 you know what to expect. <br /> <br /> <br />RVD & Booker T  vs  Dudley Boyz          5/10   <br />vs  Cade & Jindrak  vs La Resistance <br />Disappointing match after the Dudley Boyz last outing at MSG was a 10/10 at SurSer2002.         <br /> <br /> <br />Chris Jerico vs Christian          8/10 <br />A solid match with a lot of twists and turns... <br /> <br /> <br />Rock n Sock vs Evolution          6/10 <br />The Rock has never disappointed at WM! The rest of them put on an average show. <br /> <br /> <br />Sable & Torrie vs Stacy & Miss Jackie          8/10 <br />Wow! <br /> <br /> <br />Cruiserweight Championship Open          9/10 <br />Three years ago the cruiserweights were a bore but now they can more than hold their own to the heavyweights (and often surpass), this is a great match, Rey's attire was very cool. (I swear if MC & Tazz say \\"remember you can only see these guys on Smackdown!\\" One more time... we know already! no need to plug it a hundred times a match) <br /> <br /> <br />Goldberg vs Brock Lesnar          4/10  <br />I was soooo looking forward to this match, it had a four month build up but it felt like they only got informed that they were having a match an hour before, I can choreograph a better match on my PS2!  2 out of the 4 points go to the crowd for this one, there's no arena like the Garden! The difference between the WM19 crowd (zombies) and the WM20(actual sharp WWE fans) was incredible. <br /> <br /> <br />Scotty 2 Hotty &Rikishi vs APA vs          6/10 <br />Basham Brothers vs World Greatest Tag Team <br />Surprisingly better than the World Tag Championship match, but they should not of made them both the same (fatal 4 way, one fall to a finish), how about triple threat or tag elimination? Some variation was defiantly needed. <br /> <br /> <br />Victoria vs Molly Holy          2/10 <br />A boring match combined with terrible commentary, JRs underpants anyone? I thought not. (Its strange these 2 can be great commentators but every so often they make you want to die...(No Mercy 02 HHHvsKane, or how about WM19 HHHvsBokerT) <br /> <br /> <br />Kurt Angle vs Eddie  Guerrero     10/10 <br />I great (technical) match, like many of the great Angle-Benoit matches in the past. <br /> <br />Kane vs Undertaker          7/10 <br />I thought that it would have been nice to make this Hell In A Cell considering the history with both superstars...... <br />The entrance was the best thing about the match <br /> <br /> <br />HHH vs Shawn Michaels vs Chris Benoit          10/10 <br />The best match of the night(as it should be).  This is what wrestling is all about, they included just about everything that can be done, all 3 put on a great show.  The end seemed quite genuinely emotional for the winner...... a classic!   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Event                   7/10      <br />Good but not the brilliant event that it should of been, many events surpass this, WM17, NWO2001/03, SurSer2002 , SumSlam 02/03, im sure there are more, I haven't seen them all.   If only the event was as good as the DVD packaging! I was expecting at least 3  10/10 matches and lots and lots more  in the  8s and 9s but sadly that is not so. Well Im hoping that WM21 will be what WMXX should have been. <br /> <br />Extras                10/10      <br />You will not get better than this from WWE. The main event here is the Top 10 WM matches ever!  With a 4 minute montage of each match.  I wish they used a whole disk for this, but its still fantastic! Also interviews (pre/post match), TV Promos, Mania of Wrestlemania (45 min program on MM19) and Wrestlmania Gallery(Results/facts/photos from every mania) <br /> <br />Picture Quality    8/10      <br />Good, but WWE has produced better <br /> <br />Sound Quality     7/10      <br />Some noticeable problems with commentary volume <br /> <br /> <br />Overall:         7.5/10   <br /> <br /> <br />WHATS NEXT FOR WWE <br />WrestleManiaXX where it all begins again... Only its more like the end of an era, because WWE will struggle over the next few years, and here's why.  Since 2003 A-Class Superstars have been dropping off the WWE roster like flies: <br /> <br />Hulk Hogan  -  Jeff Hardy  -  The Rock  -  Goldberg  -  Brock Lesnar  -  Stone Cold   <br />Now just look at that list.  Those names were the foundations of WWE success so far thus millennium, so where do they go from here? Only time will tell. <br />
B000286SCO|5.0|The day I bought this DVD, I spent hours late at night entranced watching it with headphones to avoid waking up the neighbors. Wow... Just Wow... That's all I could say. The sound is great (You can listen to it in 5.1 surround. There is also the option to watch it while listening to commentaries) and the movie quality is very very good. I believe no band on the face ot the earth can play like Dream Theater does. They rock and watching them play I get goosebumps. How on earth can a band be so GOOD? <br />The videos are excellent and the live performances will take your breath away. Virtuosity shows all along, specially  Portnoy, Petrucci and Myung though the other members are also very good. I also laughed as some of it is really hilarious. To make it short, if you want to see a Rock band that rips their intruments with virtuosity as well as plays tight and rocks hard, buy this DVD. And 2 discs with over 3 hours for $15, it is definitely worth it.
B000268QB2|5.0|In one day I had this entire CD down by heart. Tom's vocals are amazing and the songs are very well-written and composed. I haven't purchased a new CD in a while, but this was the perfect one to stick in the player after a lull of nothing new. Definitely recommended if you like Coldplay.
B00000ICN5|5.0|I love this album, I love Stevie's guitar work so much.  But I could do without the singing.  I don't mind a few tracks here and there, but the instrumental tracks is where he really shines.
B00009TB5G|2.0|This movie was good, but I didn't get the Two Towers part, at all. I mean, the WTC barely entered into it, except as a giant allegory, and I still can't figure out if Sauron the All Seeing no one ever saw was really Osama no one can find or the CIA thought police. as a 9/11 film, it sucks.
B0000029J5|5.0|How quickly one falls for this truly wonderful music. It isn't really &quot;blues&quot; in that so much of it is quite upbeat and speaks directly into one's heart. Keb' Mo' has a genuine, easy-going yet very polished quality that makes me want to listen to him everyday. It is easy to think he is singing to you.
B00005JN2F|5.0|This is an awesome action flick that actually makes you think for a change. Matt Damon once again stars as Jason Bourne (easily his best role) and improves on the great character he portrayed in the first movie. Top notch acting work also from Brian Cox and Joan Allen, these are bad guys that were actually interesting and smart. And that car chase at the end easily eclipses the one in &quot;The Bourne Identity.&quot; This is a must see smart summer film, just judge it as a stand alone (judge the film and book seperately please). Bring on the third Bourne film soon!
B00005JMYG|5.0|Very well done movie. Excellent Special effects, and will smith did a great job as spooner, the detective.  The robot special effects were stunning, and blended in with the people as if they were really there. It seems when you thought you understood what was going on, the plot changed as you turn a corner...<br /><br />Made it more difficult to predict what was going to happen, as in all other movies...
0440418569|2.0|The first two books take you on an amazing, wonderful rollercoaster ride, only to have the third book hurl you into a whole other direction that is diappointing and confusing.  I was so upset to fall in love with Lyra and Will to end up with a bunch of anti-God speeches and a sad ending.  The anti-christian message in this book becomes apparent by the end of book two and just gets hammered in throughout book 3.  At websites devoted to His Dark Materials there are quotes about Pullman using these books to counteract the Chronicles of Narnia and God.  As a parent, I would be disturbed to have my young children (target audience) read how Man/Woman is the saviour of us all.  There is no way a parent would know that this is what the books are really about.  They are so beautifully written; the third book just broke my heart.  If children read this, parents should read it with them.  Lots to discuss.
B000053VAF|3.0|I'll admit it; I have never seen any other Kevin Smith movie aside from Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. And even in that movie his lack of class and tendency for cheap vulgarity kind of turns me off him.<br /><br />Despite some moments of (often childish) humor (any bit with Jay and Silent Bob and the cool 'new' Jesus image), Dogma mostly fails on every one of its intentions. Rather than the 'epic' most people are calling this film I consider it to be way overlong and overbearingly self-indulgent.<br /><br />It seems that Kevin Smith has a savage and acidicly cynical view of the Catholic Church and rather than making a movie that unravels any hypocrisies or sheds light on double standards he's made a sprawling shambles that too often goes off in lumbering tangents (one of Smith's constant failings).<br /><br />There's nothing unsubtle or smooth about Dogma. No class or dignity. The dialogue may be considered as biting satire to the casual viewer, but it's actually increasingly tiresome and nothing more than exposition. I kid you not; over 90% of the dialogue in this film is expositional and bores to tears. There's nothing worse than Chris Rock, Linda Fiorentino and Selma Hayek rambling on and on and on with nothing happening and still they go on and on and on and on and on...<br /><br />I cannot believe that there are 100 minutes of deleted scenes from this movie. How on earth the full cut of this movie was tolerated by even the editors is a mystery to me. Proof positive that Kevin Smith has no control over his 'creative' tantrum.<br /><br />There is also the bonus of having the WORST musical score in history (and that includes Harry Manfredini's jarring noises in Jason Goes To Hell). What a horrible, headache-inducing drone it was!<br /><br />The DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 sound, so now you can enjoy that awful score in its full glory on your home theatre. A plethora of extras are, for some reason, included on this DVD. Which is only further proof that the film thinks it's far better than it actually is. There are 'real' good movies that don't get this many extra features on DVD and I assure you I have no intention of knowing more of this film.ch is only further proof that the film thinks it's far better than it actually is.

630469654X|4.0|This movie had an exciting plot and unlike many fantasy movies, was pretty easy to follow.  I didn't mind the soundtrack- i mean, it was nothing special but it went with the movie and didn't bother me.  I'm not normally a big fan of fantasy movies but I would definetly recommend this one.
B00008G68W|2.0|I agree with Amazon's Editorial Review in that it was foolhardy to cast Gerard Depardieu as Colombus as the origin of Colombus is reputed to either be Italian or Catalan (Spanish), but certainly not French.  Gerard's accent and struggle with English made for a pitiful hero. He often had to recite his most dramatic lines robotically, without feeling, as he didn't have a clue what he was saying. I also cannot understand why Sigourney Weaver would be cast as Queen Isabella (other than for box-office guarantees).  Overexposed film stars tend to detract from the historical characters they are asked to portray. What I see is not la Reina Isabella but Sigourney dressed up as la Reina Isabella.   The performances in this well-intentioned film are often overdone and the violence gratuitous.  The script is very weak, and there are huge gaps in the story being told which left a great deal unexplained, e.g. how the native Indian who befriended Colombus learned English so rapidly.  On the plus side, Armand Assante makes a gorgeous villain, the music was hauntingly beautiful and the cinematography excellent. But the film is at least 30 minutes too long.
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|For those hoping to find an equal accomplishment to &quot;This Is It&quot;, you're not gonna... However, this is still a great album! All of these sub-par reviews I'm seeing I think are simply the result of expectations being way too high. This indeed is a well produced follow-up to nothing short of a masterpiece we were all blessed with a couple of years ago. The only unfortunate part of this album is that The Strokes seem to shoot their load on the front side of the record with the first 3 tracks. &quot;Reptilia&quot; and &quot;Automatic Stop&quot; are absolutely brilliant... 12:51 didn't exactly do it for me as it did many others... quickly picks back up again with &quot;Between Love & Hate&quot; & &quot;Meet Me In The Bathroom&quot;... Julian Casablancas shows his versatility as a vocalist in &quot;Under Control&quot; and the group puts together a more than decent finish with the final few tracks. Definately worth the money folks - no question. I personally am looking forward to many more years of refreshing, uplifting sounds from this now-established, and might I remind everyone, YOUNG, rock groups!
B000092Q8C|3.0|I think Peter Gabriel tried to get his cds out on the new SACD format too fast - this one came out in early 2003 I believe.  So it is not multiformat, not multichannel, and doesn't sound that much better than the remastered version IMO.<br /><br />A number of reviewers thought it did sound better than the remastered version - but I cannot tell much difference.
B00003CXDB|4.0|Real-life bigtime investment banker Jeff Beck not only advised Oliver Stone when he made 'Wallstreet' but also stars in this film for a few minutes playing himself at a climactic meeting of topdog-lawyers and bankers. He delivers one of the many exhilarating monologues in this Epic tale of greed, pride and innocence lost. &quot;Now your boss will really start thinking he's Gekko the Great!&quot; He shouts at Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen) who plays a struggling young stockbroker who's desperately trying to get on the fast track to becoming a &quot;player&quot;. <br /> Michael Douglas who plays 'Gordon Gekko' (not 'Gecko' as the Amazon review suggests, the name can be seen in the scene where Charlie Sheen turns on his computer in the morning and finds out it's &quot;Gekko's Birthday&quot;) puts on such a mind-blowing performance he really can be dubbed 'Gekko the Great'. The character is right up there with Don Vito Corleone, Tony Montana, Begbie, Popeye Doyle and some other members of that elite group of high-octane male movie-characters that will long outlive the actors that created them. <br />  <br /> Gordon Gekko is a high profile corporate raider that was probably modelled after Ivan Boesky (the biggest corporate raider of the 80's who eventually went behind bars for insider-trading), Michael Milken (creator and unchallenged 80's king of the high yield or junk-bond) and John Guttfreund (CEO of Salomon Brothers in the 80's who's extravert and bizarre behaviour is documented in the classic books &quot;Liar's Poker&quot; (Michael Lewis) and &quot;Barbarians at the Gate&quot; (John Helyar). <br />  <br /> Michael Douglas seems to have been born to play this part and from the moment he is introduced (&quot;Lunch? whaddaya kiddin' me, lunch is for wimps!&quot;) to the moment we viewers have to part from his hypnotic character (&quot;I gave you Darian, I gave you everything!&quot;) he reduces any leaps of faith that his character may present us with to tiny hops due to his powerhouse presence. In fact, whenever I see Michael Douglas in another movie I have the strange feeling that Gordon Gekko is trapped inside and might burst out at any time to hose us down with sardonic one-liners. (&quot;Love is just an old lie created to keep people from jumping out of windows.&quot;) <br />  <br /> Gekko is truly the mother of all high rollers, and his performance alone more than warrants the purchase of this film. Apart from that it looks great with crisp Miami Vice type of clean-cut shots and scenery. The whole set up is utterly believable. I work in Derivatives Sales in London and deal with brokers, traders and senior decision makers of the world's leading investment firms on a daily basis. Either they all modelled themselves after Gordon Gekko or for some reason Michael Douglas got it exactly right. Aggression, impatience with political correctness and urgency to get deals/trades done is what this movie and real Capital Markets are all about.  <br />  <br /> Charles Sheen plays a believable 'Bud Fox' but one wonders what a late 80's Tom Cruise or Kiefer Sutherland might have done with the part. Charlie never really creates the electricity that Douglas shocks the audience with. A baffling fact is that Stone admits on this DVD in an interview that Cruise called him to say he'd love to play the part but Stone \\"had already promised it to Charlie\\".  <br />  <br /> I won't get into the details of the story here but will post some comments on the general themes in the movie. <br />  <br /> There's the theme that Stone had already explored in 'Platoon' of two fathers fighting for the soul of their son. In Platoon it was Tom Berenger and Willem Defoe battling for custody of Charlie Sheen's spirit. In Wallstreet it's Douglas and Martin Sheen representing the 'exciting but evil' and 'wholesome but tedious' ways to go for Charlie Sheen's character. This theme introduces some good tension in the storytelling.  <br /> The other theme that Stone put into this narrative is the bleeding heart &quot;Capitalism is bad and unfair&quot; jingle. &quot;I don't produce anything...I own...&quot; Gekko confesses at one point. &quot;How many boats to water-ski behind do you need? When is it enough?!&quot; cries a shocked Bud Fox. The moral comments on successful capitalists come across somewhat naive and in my opinion don't really work. I won't go into the details but most people I've met who've seen the movie don't even remember what it was about Gordon Gekko that was so wrong. All they remember is the classic &quot;Greed is Good&quot; speech and ironically most of them agree with Gekko on the issue. The fact that Oliver Stone lets Gekko initiate industrial espionage is the reason I gave the movie only four stars instead of five. <br />  <br /> I personally think this was a real blooper. A man in Gekko's position doesn't need the aggravation of blatantly breaking the law. There's a good plot line concerning a fictive company 'Bluestar Airlines' that Gekko has perfectly legal plans with to make himself rich and get scores of hard working people fired that adds enough suspense to the tale. It seems as though Stone was so set on painting a negative picture of egotistical an a-moral Wall-Streeters that he went one bridge too far.  <br />  <br /> Fact is that, if anything, this movie is like a recruiting video for Investment Banking. What &quot;Top Gun&quot; did for Naval Aviation &quot;Wall Street&quot; has done for Investment Banking. Big corporate banks have never had to complain about the amount of interested well-educated young hopefuls but nowadays there's probably not one person sitting in any dealing room anywhere in the world who has not seen Wall Street. For one I am convinced that if it wasn't for the scenes that have the camera following runners and stressed out yuppies yelling &quot;How about those September fifties!&quot; I wouldn't have been in this racket.  <br />  <br /> The dealing room-scenes are some of the most exhilarating scenes in the history of cinematography. Spielberg immersed audiences with his scenes of Normandy's beaches in '44. Stone creates the same spellbinding grip on the audience without getting anybody shot or brutally maimed. That alone is a great achievement for any director in Hollywood. More so for the man who made a career in gory cinematic violence with the screenplay for 'Scarface' and directing 'Platoon' and 'Natural Born Killers'. <br />  <br /> All Hail Gekko the Great! See this movie again and again. It's full of catchy one-liners that will make you not only the toast of any party but might provide you with more of an energy boost than any Tony Robbins video ever will. &quot;Life all comes down to a few moments, this is one of them...&quot; <br />
B000001GPX|5.0|For those of you who may not know, Carlos Kleiber died July 17th.  He left a very small legacy of recordings, and perhaps the greatest impact any musician has left on his audiences in so few of performances.  I've never heard a Kleiber recording that I haven't had quibbles with about his drastic tempos and furious methods.  But I've also loved every one of them, and very much so this recording of the fifth and seventh.  No other artist, for better or worse, ever could maintain an orchestra at this intensity--live or studio.  Kleiber is furious and fiery and extraordinarily passionate.  His performances are frequently debated but always treasured.  In an era of precise, clean and antiseptic recordings by the likes of Levine, Marriner and Gardiner, one can realize how impressive it is to have a man like Kleiber, who can play more precisely at breakneck speeds than these 'perfect' conductors, and play with such tremendous passion that the performances can live, not as relics, but as vibrant and new creations.  That, perhaps is the single most fantastic thing about Kleiber--you can complain about his tempos and his fury, but you cannot touch his musicianship and his theatrical effectiveness.  Whether you agree with every choice or not, serious music lovers cannot afford to ignore Kleiber (and they never have).  Perhaps Levine could learn an important lesson from Kleiber: Slow down, record and perform less, and make each performance count for something.  Kleiber did.  And he always will.  This is not the definitive performance of the fifth and seventh.  In fact, there are none at all, but Bohm and Karajan both do a good job of giving a strong and more 'traditional' reading, and certainly Toscanini's masterful performances will be able to appease that need.  These recordings are something else.  Just one brief example: everyone knows the fifth is based on a basic rhythmic figure '..._' but what Kleiber discovers is that the first movement, when the tempo is increased andthe larger contours are smoothed, there is a whole larger nature of this work that is almost always lost.  All of the notes are the same in these performances, but you will be left hearing things that had always been there but never expressed.  If the fifth has become a cliche for you (as it has me) this recording will open a whole new life of it for you.  Regardless, these performances, indeed all of Kleiber's performances will open your eyes to a whole new way of considering the music.  You cannot afford to ignore Kleiber.  We love you, Maestro Carlos Kleiber, and we thank you for everything you've given us.
B0002858YS|4.0|The Killers will not change your life. <br /> <br />That said, they are a quite talented band who have released an entertaining and thoroughly enjoyable album. <br /> <br />\\"Hot Fuss\\" is catchy, clever, sing-along-able, and undoubtedly being labeled right now as the \\"Next Big Thing.\\"  And if the Next Big Thing is a band with cute songs played by cute musicians, that label may be accurate.  The formula seems to work consistently, and I'll say this for them:  I'd be much happier to see them become the Rock Stars to Watch for the next two months than Maroon5 (I'd like to flog whatever idiot decided that they belonged to the rock genre) or Nickelback. <br /> <br />The Killers' live shows will probably be fraught with fifteen-year-old girls who \\"love, love, love\\" Avril Lavigne, Coldplay, and the Dave Matthews Band (and therefore have no semblance of real musical taste or discrimination and listen mainly to whatever comes onto their radio station), so I will probably never attend one. <br /> <br />But I'm happy to let \\"Hot Fuss\\" be a guilty pleasure, a little like the musical equivalent of cotton candy.  It's fluffy, light, airy, sweet, a bit sickening in large quantities, and ultimately unmemorable, but when you're in the mood, it might be just what you're craving.
0345357116|5.0|Next to The Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales is probably your best resource for learning more about the history and behind-the-scenes events that took place during, and before the War of the Ring. <br /> <br />The book begins with a summery and overview by editor Christopher Tolkien, who as you may have figured out, is John Ronald Reuel Tolkien's son. There's also an introduction, explaining why Christopher Tolkien left some texts unaltered, or why he altered, or did not give altered versions, or definitions and clarifications between differing versions of similar stories...it's all a little long-winded and not entirely necessary in my humble opinion. But perhaps it is important to some. Unfinished Tales is, after all, a large compilation of the scraps and tidbits of information that Professor Tolkien scrawled out in spare time, put together and alongside entire revisions of different stories. I can't imagine the sticky process it took to put this all together. <br /> <br />The book is divided into four sections. <br /> <br />The First Age section entails the story of Tuor, the escaped slave of Morgoth, warned by the \\"god\\" of waters, Ulmo, of the impending danger to the bulwark fortress of Gondolin. Tuor journeys with the aid and guidance of a sea-faring Elf, Voronw, to the stronghold of Gondolin, and offers his message at last to its great king. Since the tale ends here (with only cursory description of the events that followed), I recommend reading The Silmarillion first, if you haven't already, to find out how it turns out. I have, but some of the details were difficult to recall. <br /> <br />Following is the incredibly tragic (and in this rendition, long!) tale of Turin, or rather, Narn I Hn Hrin, the tale of the children of Hrin. I read it because I didn't want to leave anything skipped, but it's only a more detailed retelling of the same story found again in The Silmarillion. It's such a sad, sordid tale that I don't think I would have lost anything by skipping over it. <br /> <br />The Second Age section tells the story of Aldarion, a future king of Nmenr, whose love for the sea is threatened by his love for the maid Erendis, vice-versa. I thought the story was woven incredibly well, except for the fact that it ends abruptly. (I was upset, until I closed the book and remembered that -- duh -- they're UNFINISHED Tales!) From all indications, the ending wasn't too happy anyway. But the story is still of high value for its descriptions of the island of Nmenr. <br /> <br />There is a brief recounting of genealogies of the line of Elros, the first king of Nmenr, and then a scattered gathering of information about Galadriel and her relationship to Celeborn. Various different versions are compared, very little is concretely presented.  <br /> <br />The Third Age is probably my favorite section. It would appear that interest, at least in my case, grows stronger as the time draws closer to the War of the Ring. The first story, The Disaster of the Gladden Fields, is virtually all-new material regarding the march of Isildur after he cut the One Ring from Sauron's hand, how Isildur's army was overtaken by orcs, and how Isildur found his end. There's even a little information about what King Elessar (Aragorn, of course) found in the tower of Orthanc following Saruman's demise!  <br /> <br />Then there is the tale of the great grandsire of the Rohirrim, Eorl, and his assistance that he provided to Cirion, the steward of Gondor, in his greatest need, much as Thoden later did. Unfortunately, this tale tells of how Eorl led his troops forth, and all kinds of details about his journey -- and cuts short just as the battle begins. Don't blame Christopher Tolkien though...it's one of the Unfinished elements. We're also told of the pledge between Gondor and Rohan, and of the gift of the land of Rohan to the Eorlingas. <br /> <br />Then we get some more, extra information about the Quest of  Erebor, where Bilbo Baggins of the Shirewas first persuaded to join thirteen dwarves on an impossible mission to reclaim the great dwarf treasure hoard which was stolen by the dragon Smaug. It is told from Gandalf's perspective to the hobbits inside Minas Tirith following the coronation of Aragorn, which gives it an added bonus, much like seeing extended material on the special extended DVD of the movie. <br /> <br />There are also stories that fill in what happened during the Hunt for the Ring, including a confrontation between the Nazgl and Grima Wormtongue, and the other goings about that the Dark Riders conducted. <br /> <br />The Battle for the Fords of Isen is background, merging with the story in The Two Towers just as Thoden and his troops arrive at Helm's Deep. It also deals with Thodred's death, and the valor that he, Elfhelm, Grimbold, Erkenbrand, and omer and other generals showed during the decline of Rohan's kingdom. <br /> <br />Part four deals quickly with three things: The Dredain (the forest-dwellers briefly seen in Return of the King book, and also the originators of the Pkal-men), the Istari, and the Palantiri. All three fill a mere forty pages, but still provide many interesting and awesome facts about the Seeing-stones, Gandalf's arrival upon the shores of Middle-Earth, etc. <br /> <br />There's also a large index of names and places in the back. <br /> <br />This book is fundamental for hard-core, book-reading fans of Tolkien. You can learn all sorts of behind-the-scenes events that took place in Middle-Earth, and then shock (or repulse) your friends, or just fill out your knowledge of Tolkienology with peripheral information. It's not quite as enjoyable to read as the linear, completed works like the trilogy, the Hobbit, or even the Silmarillion provide, but still very useful. Most likely the fact that you're looking this book up means you should buy it, and I recommend you do.
6304712499|1.0|When I first saw this movie, I knew NOTHING about Spawn, I just thought this movie sounded cool, so I bought it....BIG MISTAKE! The movie is ok for Spawn Newcomers, but for high-class loyal Spawn followers like myself, forget this movie.  <br />The story was ok, and was the basic story of Spawn and how he came to be, some of the stuff it has really happened in the Spawn comics, so I at first really liked this movie. Then I decided to buy some Spawn Comics, and I noticed that many of the elements in the Spawn movie were false, and I became mad very fast. I continued to read and read, and got more and more mad at this movie. Later I ran across the Spawn Animated Series Season 1. I couldnt resist, I wanted to see if anything matched up to the comics. It was perfect. Everything in that series is exactly what actually happened to Spawn, and put the movie to shame. So if you are a die-hard Spawn fan buy the Animated Series, if youre just a Spawn-curious adventurer, I highly recommend this, that way you can eventually buy the series, and hate this movie along with me!!
B0002I83TK|5.0|WOW, THIS IS HOT, HOT, HOT!!!!  DANCING IS HOT, PERFECT, SENSUAL, SEDUCTIVE.  FANTASTIC MOVIE FOR DANCE LOVERS.  DIEGO IS GOING TO BE BIG.  SEXY AND BOY DOES HE MOVE.  BEST OF LUCK TO THIS NEW STAR.
B000002JPA|5.0|This album rocks, but the songs aren't long enough, they rock, and are awesome, but not enough time to serious jam along with them, it just goes by too fast. <br />Long Story short.......buy this, listen to Metropolis Part 1, and then buy Metropolis Part 2: Scenes From a Memory. That's the best decision you'll ever make, I guarantee it.
0385510438|5.0|I have read all of John Grisham's books. I especially liked this one. It is different from his other books about the law and very different from &quot; A Time to Kill&quot;. The story is about a law case, but not about the murderer or the bloodsucking lawyers- it is about the people in the town of Clanton. The story takes place in Mississippi in Ford county the same setting for &quot;A Time to Kill&quot;. We get in depth into the lives of the characters and get a front row seat to life in this small town. The history of the town and the people in it is presented extensively and is rich with home- cooking, front porch conversations, family, friendships and small town politics. Anyone who has grown up in a small town will appreciate the atmosphere of this book. The people are believable and is typical of Grisham there is a twist in the plot and the ending is not as you would suspect. It is a wonderful read, full of action, mystery and wonderful people. I shared their emotions as I read this book and was sad to see it end. A wonderful read.
B000059ZLH|5.0|This Live DVD is perfect. It's just Dream Theater, their instruments, the fans, and the music. Their is no high-octane show, their are no special effects, and not even any lights that do really cool stuff. Yes, yes I know what youre thinking &quot;So what exactly what makes this the perfect DVD?&quot; Dream Theater dont play music to get famous, they play music because they are musicians, they do it just for the music. The entire performance was flawless, and beautiful. It was perfect, some say, that this DVD isnt cool because nothing cool happens, well DUH, thats the point!! Just listen to the music, thats why they played it. Dont get lost in the commercialism of how most rock stars perform. Ok, ok, I know, cool tricks, and displays are often cool, and make you enjoy the show even more, but when you have an album this beautiful and intricate, you shouldnt have to use cool tricks, and neat displays, the album is the real art, not the show. Dream Theater I think is very proud of Scenes From a Memory, and they wanted to show it by playing it straight through, and have to spice it up in any way. Simplicity is sometimes the greatest achievement a person could make!!! <br /> Dream Theater Rocks!!!!
B00004TH7Z|5.0|I, like many other Maiden fans, was extremely pleased to here that Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith were rejoining this metal monster. I was less then pleased that Janick Gers was staying on, but I guess you can't win them all. (It's just that damn dancing around the stage.)<br /><br /> I really enjoyed the Blaze Bayley albums. I thought &quot;Sign Of The Cross&quot; and &quot;The Clansman&quot; were wonderful. (But, with Steve Harris writing both, what do you expect?) Yet, something was missing...<br /><br /> No more! The energy is back. Dickinson and Smith have revitalized this band like never before. The songs on this are amazing. I would go as far as to call this the first &quot;essential&quot; Iron Maiden album with Bruce since &quot;Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son.&quot; I truly feel that the really good songs on &quot;No Prayer For The Dying&quot; and &quot;Fear Of The Dark&quot; could have been combined into one album. (What in the hell is &quot;Weekend Warriors&quot; doing on a Maiden album, anyway?) Kevin Shirley's production gives this album a very &quot;live&quot; feel, and keeps the band from sounding over-produced and computerized.<br /><br /> The new three-guitar set-up doesn't make a noteworthy difference in the sound; it just adds an extra lead guitar style. Dave Murray's and Jan Gers's respectable lead styles are as distinguishable as before, but hearing Adrian's tone come through makes me sleep a little better at night. I always thought his tone, combined with Davey's, made the band's sound. Jan's lead style was a little to &quot;hard rock,&quot; and not &quot;metal&quot; enough, on past albums, and I would be remiss to not mention it here. It is, on this, however, subdued to the point that it doesn't stop me from listening... loudly. And those solos... those solos... BRING THEM ON!! Hearing Davey and Adrian go at it again restores my faith in music.<br /><br /> Bruce is still as great as ever. His voice seems to get better with age. His energy comes through loud and clear. And that bass guitar... Steve Harris... STEVE HARRIS!! The man is a true original on the instrument, and this recording is no exeption. His rapid-finger midrage bass tone drives these songs... along with Nicko McBrain's drumming. That lunatic is as fluid on the &quot;tops&quot; (as he calls them) as on any other album.<br /><br /> And these songs... Smith and Dickinson were always good songwriters, and having their input seems to make this album really shine, combined with Gers, Murray, and, of course, Harris (the band's founder, main songwritter, and the disc's co-producer). Harris's trademark is all over this. I don't think he's ever put a bad song on a Maiden album. His writing credit is on all ten tracks, but &quot;Blood Brothers&quot; is, oddly, the only one he has sole credit on. (He usually has three or four.) Even Davey Murray (the only other original member, with Harris) has two credits on this disc. McBrain is the only member of the band without songwriting credit, but he never has had one.<br /><br /> The album kicks off with &quot;The Wickerman,&quot; one of the best songs the band has ever recorded (written by Smith, Harris, and Dickinson). That chorus, &quot;YOUR TIME WILL COME!,&quot; is sure to become a Maiden concert chant... not to mention Smith's solo; one of his best ever. Other stellar songs include &quot;Nomad,&quot; &quot;Ghost Of The Navigator,&quot; &quot;Blood Brothers&quot; (written by Harris after the death of his father), and &quot;Out Of The Silent Planet.&quot; Come to think of it, I don't think there is a bad song on this whole disc.<br /><br /> These guys are almost in there fifties. (Nicko actually is.) And, they can play it louder and longer then guys half their age, and play it with more energy. Anyone who thinks that &quot;metal&quot; is a depressed twenty-something with an out of tune seven-string needs to buy this and listen to it intently... maybe even take notes.<br /><br /> I am truly impressed... UPTHE IRONS!!am truly impressed... UP THE IRONS!!
B00005UEAR|5.0|Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence, that is a very long title, but if you can remember all of the name, you should definitely buy this album. This was the first Dream Theater album I ever listened to, and I've been a fan ever since. It has 2 discs, let me give you the run-down of them. <br /> Disc 1: You may listen to it and not like it too terribly much, but after several listens it begins to grow on you. The first track &quot;The Glass Prison&quot; is my favorite song of all time. Lasting 13:43, it's also the longest song ever produced by Dream Theater ( I think...). It is very, very Hard Rock, and is filled with sweet-sounding solos, great vocals, killer drum beats, and a bass that flies from its introduction. It rocks plain and simple.  <br /> The other Tracks on the album are also very good, they will grow on you, and you will also appreciate them in time. but I'll spare you the trouble about reading about every one of them. <br /> Disc 2: A rip-off of Scenes From A Memory (which you should buy), the 8-song disc is an entire story, only not as dark, and weird as SFAM. It has much happier sounds, but it extremely great. Dream Theater has found a sound they can call their own, one story on one CD, and it works for them, they need to continue doing this. All the songs on this disc are good, from the Overture as an introduction, to the powerful, emotional Grand Finale.  <br /> These guys are musical geniuses, and nobody tops them, it's only a shame they are not as recognized as many of these terrible, no-talent rock bands we find today. <br /> This album is a great addition to your CD collection, that's why I give it 5 stars, and it definitely deserves it.
B000286S8S|4.0|Greatest hits albums target two groups of people: <br /> 1. Diehard fans who will buy it: a) To keep their collection complete, b)to pick up the obligatory new songs, and c) to get remastered, cleaner sounding versions of the classics. <br /> 2. Casual fans who just want the songs they've heard on the radio. <br />  <br /> For the first camp, of which I am a member, the Roth era albums have already been remastered and released, so it's the Hagar era songs that benefit from the remastering. As with Best Of Volume 1, someone screwed up the mix of one of the classics - remember the verse swap on Runnin' With The Devil on BOV1? Well, as other reviews have noted, on BOBW, they forgot to fade out Finish What Ya Started, so the end of the song continues at normal volume until it just abruptly stops. Apparently, VH is required to have at least one screw up on every compilation album. Then there's the three new Sammy songs. None of these are gonna be remembered as classics. It's About Time has grown on me a bit, and is probably the best of the three. Learning To See sounds like a Hagar solo song - not bad, not great. Up For Breakfast is the weakest of the new tunes. <br />  <br /> For the casual fans, this really is a pretty comprehesive collection of singles the band has released from &quot;Both Worlds&quot; -DLR & SH. The only glaring omissions I see is the under-representation of Fair Warning, which could have been remedied by replacing the unnecessary live tracks with Mean Street and So This Is Love. They could also have included Don't Tell Me, as this was the first single from Balance (and the best song on the album.)  <br />  <br /> Other than that, I see people whining about their personal favorites not being there, or the play order of the songs. If you're a die hard, you've already got the whole catalog anyway, so why does it matter so much if some of your personal favorite album tracks aren't on there? Also, I kind of like the Dave-Sam-Dave-Sam ordering of the songs. I always felt the chronological ordering of BOV1 was kind of boring - I like to mix the tunes up. <br />  <br /> As for ignoring the Gary Cherone album - why is this a surprise to anyone? The album was a failure, there are no hits on it, and Sammy is back in the band. If you want to hear VH3 songs so badly, go to the cutout bin and pick up VH3 for $1.99! <br />  <br /> In summary, this collection, while imperfect, as most best of's are, is must have for die hard fans, and serves as a great start for casual fans. <br />
6305949980|5.0|This Movie is pure magic!!! I love the music, and I like Hard Rock, but I listen to the movie constantly just to hear the music.  <br />But the story itself is awesome. it has great animation, and many fun elements that the whole family can enjoy.  <br />This is my favorite movie, and youll love it if you havent seen it, and if you have seen it, youll love the DVD. Thats a promise!
B0002234LS|5.0|I love this movie. i was sceptical at first because of what i had heard but i decided to give it a shot. i was very suprised. this was an awesome psycological thriller, my fav. kind of scary movie. there was nothing predictable about this movie, i don't know where they are getting that crap! what movies have they seen that are unprecitable, i have not seen many myself, but this certianly was anything by predictable. i totally did not see it coming and i loved it!!! another good one like this that messes with your head it ABANDON, with Katie Holmes. i did not expect that much from her but she put out a great starring role in this psycological thriller that will have you guessing till the end! =)
B0000CDLA7|4.0|Dream Theater is the best band on the face of the Earth. They have a very unique style only they can pull off, no one else comes close. Train of Thought is a good album, it explores the more Alternative side to Dream Theater. Having only 7 songs, it seems very short, but the songs are quite long, and time just flies. The opener track &quot;As I Am&quot; is a great start, it is a hard-rock, song with many parts having Alternative Rock style feelings. The vocals are high in the verse, and low in the chorus, it sounds very good. <br /> The 3rd song entitled &quot;Endless Sacrifice&quot; is by far the best on the album, the guitar and keyboard synch. up so well, and they just fit each other so well. It is a slow song, with a loud chorus, and some of the best solos ever heard. The rest of the album is good, but dont compare to the two I just mentioned (this is just my opinion). <br /> Although Train of Thought is worth the money for any Dream Theater fan, Metropolis Part 2: Scenes From a Memory is still the Ranking General in the DT dicsography. Both are great buys and I highly recommend both!!
B0002234LS|3.0|Secret Window(2003)<br /><br /> If you happen to be one of Stephen King's &quot;Constant Readers&quot;, good adaptations of his novels/short stories come around once in a blue moon. Fans fondly remember movies such as &quot;The Shining&quot;, &quot;Misery&quot;, &quot;Cujo&quot;, &quot;Christine&quot;, &quot;The Green Mile&quot; and &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;, but after that things got more than a little mediocre, with &quot;Pet Semetary&quot; and &quot;The Dark Half&quot; being the only movies watchable. &quot;Secret Window&quot; was brought to the big screen by writer/director David Koepp, and he based his movie on Stephen King's Novella 'Secret Window, Secret Garden', which can be found in the book 'Four Past Midnight'. After Koepp drafted the Screenplay for &quot;Secret Window&quot;, he hired uber-popular actor Johnny Depp as the main character(Mort Rainey), and Timothy Dalton, who starred in 'The Dark Half' movie. So in the world of King-dom, does &quot;Secret Window&quot; stand as a triumphant adaptation, or a miserable failure? Read on to find out...<br /><br /> Plot-<br /><br /> Mort Rainey is an accomplished novelist working on a brand new novel when an unexpected knock at the door changes his life forever. A man named Jack Shooter(Played by John Turturro) claims that Rainey stole the story he wrote 7 years ago. Rainey is disbelieveing at first, but after reading Shooter's manuscript, he realizes his story and Shooter's are exactly the same, and he can't believe that Shooter is accusing HIM! As Shooter grows more impatient with Rainey's inability to admit that &quot;he stole his story&quot;, Shooter begins wreaking havoc on Rainey's life, first killing his dog, to burning down his ex-wife's house, and finally resorts to murdering to get Rainey's attention. Mort Rainey is soon thrust into his own story, and only the ending can solve his mystery......<br /><br /> Acting/Directing/Etc.-<br /><br /> &quot;Secret Window&quot; definitely benifits from the cast, as Johnny Depp('The Pirates of the Carribean', 'Edward Scissorhands') and John Turturro('The Green Mile', 'O Brother Where Art Thou?') are both magnificent actors, and fortuneatly the have the most important roles in the film. Johnny Depp, much like his role in 'The Pirates of the Carribean' as Captain Jack Sparrow, seems distracted, sleepy, lazy, and disillusioned, and Depp does a magnificent job playing the washed-up writer. Turturro plays Jack Shooter, the angry writer from Mississippi with an unmistakeable southern drawl, and Turturro does a good job playing the &quot;country hick&quot;, and his accent is believable at the same time. David Koepp does a decent job directing, while I had no problems with it, there wasn't anything that distinguishes &quot;Secret Window&quot; from any other movie in terms of directing. What really hurts 'Secret Window' is how the screenplay seems to drag along, and what little action there is turns out to be a tad mellow and disappointing, and the big &quot;showdown&quot; you might be expecting never happens. For that, &quot;Secret Window&quot;, while being a Horror movie, isn't scary AT ALL, and turns out being much more of a drama with a disturbing ending if you ask me. Unlike critics of &quot;Secret Window&quot; I don't think you will figure out the plot twist unless you have read the books, as it isn't easy to decipher otherwise.<br /><br /> Opinion-<br /><br /> Overall, &quot;Secret Window&quot; is a good adaptation of the novel, but I feel that the plot just simply drags on in many places, and when the viewer finally gets to the climax, it's nothing special. If you plan on buying &quot;Secret Window&quot; because you want a &quot;scary&quot; movie, I feel you may be more than a little disappointed. In the end, &quot;Secret Window&quot; is worth a rent, but not worth spending more than $10.00's of your hard earned cash.<br /><br /> RECOMMENDED FOR FANS OF STEPHEN KING, STEPHEN KING MOVIES, AND JOHNNY DEPP. DON'T COME IN EXPECTING A HORROR MOVIE, MORE OF A DRAMA! WORTH A RENT, BUT I DON'T RECOMMEND BUYING IT!<br /><br /> Also Recommended-<br /><br /> The Shining- Stephen King(DVD)<br /><br /> Misery- Stephen King(DVD)<br /><br /> Four Past Midnight- Stephen King(Novella Collection)<br /><br /> Thanks For Reading!IN EXPECTING A HORROR MOVIE, MORE OF A DRAMA!

B000002JKA|5.0|This album is fantastic. It has a great sound, and is a great buy. All Dream Theater fans will like this album, as well as many other music-listeners. It combines DT's extreme talents along with many other Hard Rock sounds and Prog. Metal, and Alternative Rock. <br />I'll save you some time, and just say, Dream Theater rocks, buy all of their albums, you wont be disappointed, I wasn't. This is a great buy and definitely worth the money.

B00028HBKM|5.0|Can't thank Mel Gibson enough for this film, a wonderful gift for which he shall be remmembered a long, long time from now , however, I'm thinking about waiting for the special edition. So many DVD's extras feel unnecessary but this is THE one film with a background I really want to learn all about.  <br />Heck, I may just go ahead and buy both editions !
B000268QB2|3.0|This album is very much like the offspring of sad-happy Travis, and heart-broken hopefuls Coldplay. The first 5 songs are extremly well done, laced with piano and very good lyrics. Tom's voice is refined and magical, unlike anything i've heard so far.  <br /> <br />Many people have compared them to Radiohead, which i find a bit too extravagant for this new band. Through their lyrics and song work, i can see they have potential, however they lack a good deal of experience seen by Travis, Coldplay and Radiohead. <br /> <br />The only song that is somewhat Radiohead-ish would be Your Eyes Open, which is a slow moving low-pitch song. It's still pretty tolerable, but from there the album takes a slight downward plunge to songs that sound like badly-done B-sides or fillers. Untitled 1, for example, is one of them, and She Has No Time is probably the worst. Fortunately, the song Bedshaped saves the last few songs from complete expungement.  <br /> <br />Overall, it's actually quite exquisite, but the lack of flexibility and originality refrains it from the likes of other Britrock bands that have the sophistication and knowledge to produce excellent albums. <br /> <br />Its's still pretty much worth most of your money, though.
B000005HLV|4.0|This album is a step away from the brutality of early mayhem, moving us into a land of fast tremolo picking and furious drums. This cd is extremely atmospheric, especially the now well known song &quot;Freezing Moon&quot;. It is a very dark work of old school black metal.   The few negatives I can think of for this album is slight repetativness, though for most its not an annoyance. The vocals of course are a huge debate, as Mayhem's vocalist dead died by his own hand before this album was recorded and so another voice was brought in. At times the vocals are very dark and evil, such as on freezing moon, while at others pitiful and almost humerous.   I recommend this album for any fan of black metal who wants to delve into the genre's past.
B0000C7PQK|5.0|My nascent advent into the world of ambient/new age/world music has been a very pleasurable and mind opening experience. I tried Deep forest as well as Enigma, Deep forest being more down to earth, giving more of an earthy feel as it takes you to the heart of different continents, whereas Enigma is more outworldly, a quality much more prevalent in the CD's that came after &quot;cross of changes&quot;. After repeatedly listening to the &quot;greatest hits collection&quot;, it feels like enigma's first chapter is not the First 4 cds, but this new electronic feel to the music more prevalent in &quot;Voyageur&quot; started converging towards it much sooner after &quot;cross of changes&quot;. So the first chapter ended with the first 2 CD's. I believe enigma evolved into the so called new enigma much sooner than voyageur. <br />  <br /> My picks on this CD... <br />  <br /> From East to west (Track 1, 5 stars)... The familiar Enigma intro signature tune with a nice aquatic soundscape. You feel like you are under water with the whales and dolphins in deep ocean but the ocean is gentle not stormy. <br />  <br /> Voyageur: (Track 2, 4 stars) will grow on you. With Cretu' Digitally Synthesized jabbering, it's like being in a maze or a fog. Cool. The bass hammering is beautifully interspersed with the female (I believe sandra) whisphering. Nice layering of sounds with an aquatic treble damped quality, with bass on higher side than the treble. Kind of a like dolby sound. Again gives you an underwater feeling. <br />  <br /> Page of cups: (Track 4, 5 stars) This is etheral stuff, with a beautiful gentle electronic sound coupled with funky groove and an aquatic dolby damped feel.  <br />  <br /> &quot;Boum-Boum&quot;: (Track 5, 3 stars): poppish but I still like the feel of the music. Interspersed are the electronic techno samples. And sandra voice feels nice and refreshing. <br />  <br /> In the shadow, In the light: (Track 8, 5 stars)...fanstastic stuff...If cretu's Digitallyaltered voice fits the music, this is the one. <br />  <br /> Piano: (Track 10, 5 stars)...This a short beautiful peace...to be heard with the lights out and the curtains down, and let yourself slip away. Meditatively serene stuff. <br />  <br /> Following the sun (Track 11, 4 stars)...Maybe Cretu could have chipped down on the &quot;yay yay yay&quot; shouting...but still not a bad one to close the compilation and offcourse we have our sandra cretu here ..familiar terrain. <br />  <br />  <br />  <br /> Downers:  <br />  <br /> &quot;Incognito&quot;...not that good..feels more like techno rock, not what I am looking for in an enigma CD. <br />  <br /> &quot;Weightless&quot;...this is nothing but a filler just to inflate cd playing time. Enigma should stop  <br /> putting stuff like this just to inflate their running time. We'll buy an enigma CD even if it is 44 mins instead of 47 mins.  <br />  <br /> &quot;look of today&quot;...has the &quot;TNT for the brain&quot; feel to it but still felt it was too poppish with cretu's voice...not what I want in enigma. <br />  <br /> 'Total eclipse of the moon&quot;..This was not required...just for inflating run time. <br />  <br /> 7 good singles, 2 not that good singles and 2 fillers (total eclipse, weightless)...so overall Thumbs Up!!! <br />  <br /> The great thing is that this is electronic new age but the kind you can fall of to sleep listening to. Because the music is made so errie sounding, even with the jazzy electronic content in places, it still has this foggy/haze-like acoustic quality. The treble is muted and the bass is kept a bit more, giving you that cozy acoustic feel. When I listen to this CD, I feel like I am in a private glass cocoon with carpeted floors, I can see the see the outside world through the glass but cant hear anything from the outside world except the throbbing vibrations of outside activity. A Beautiful cozy feeling. <br />  <br /> I dont think Cretu's singing messes the CD...it's just that fans are so used to the regular female voice for over a decade that it will take some time to get adjusted. But I am sure Cretu will get accepted since enigma's music is not about much singing anyway. Its about creating an atmosphere.  <br />  <br /> Enigma doesnt need the monks any more...Their musical language has evolved. The king is (not) dead, long live the king !!!
B00005JN2F|3.0|The Bourne Identity directed by Doug Liman was excellent.  However, this second installment, The Bourne Supremacy, is not filmed by the same director and it makes all of the difference in the world.  <br /> <br />The movie overall is ok, but it can't hold a candle to the first one.  The main reason for my dismay at this movie is the choice made by director Paul Greengrass to use handheld cameras almost exclusively.  In every scene, the camera appears to be wiggling around.  It gives the film a cheap look - as if it was filmed with a bargain bin camcorder. <br /> <br />I understand the use of this technique when Bourne is running, or during a car chase.  But through the whole movie?  Give me a break!  It makes the film difficult to watch, and is just downright annoying at times.   <br /> <br />If you get motion sickness easily - be prepared! <br />
B0001ADAVK|4.0|Mona Lisa Smile, released in 2003 by Columbia Tristar Home Entertainment with a running time of 2 hours, is a drama about college girls coming of age in the 1950's. <br /> <br />Katherine Watson, played by Julia Roberts (Erin Brockovich), is a progressive forward thinker who comes to Wellesley, a private all-girls University, in the fall of 1953 to teach Art History.  Unfortunately for Miss Watson, Wellesley is not a place where progressive forward thinking is highly regarded. <br /> <br />Miss Watson tries to educate the girls in Art History as well as life. She teaches them that they can have a career as well as marriage, in a time when women were encouraged to stay out of the workplace. <br /> <br />The supporting cast of college students includes Julia Stiles, Kirsten Dunst, and Maggie Gyllenhall.  The soundtrack includes \\"The Heart of Every Girl\\" by Elton John and Bernie Taupin, which was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Original Song. It was directed by Mike Newell, who also directed \\"Pushing Tin\\" and \\"Donnie Brasco\\". <br /> <br />I give \\"Mona Lisa Smile\\" four out of five stars.  I found it to be very entertaining with an engaging story line, and I found myself genuinely caring about the decisions the students were making in their lives.  This movie touched me and by the end I found myself tearing up. <br />
0684800713|5.0|I liked this book a lot.  It may not have the deepest meaning, but if is a fun read about drinking, bull fighting, and women.  If you would like to read similar books I would read Hemingway's Green Hills of Africa or Hunter S. Thompson's The Rum Diary.
B00005JN2F|5.0|MOVIE: Today it's hard to find a movie that will actually thrill you without special effects or an absurd unreal plot. The Bourne Franchise does just that. This espionage thriller is based on the second of Robert Ludlum's trilogy of books. With one more left to go its getting down to the wire. I strongly recommend that you watch the first movie before seeing this one, even if you've already seen it. The plot of this movie is ongoing and in order to have the full benefit it would be wise to refresh yourself with The Bourne Identity. Jason Bourne has started over with young woman he met in the first movie, now in India, but when someone frames him for murder the government is back on his tail. He is now thrown back into the cat and mouse game that he once knew, but knowing this movie, the cat and mouse roles change constantly. New director, Paul Greengrass, brings a new realism to the franchise. Previous director, Doug Liman, had a more formal take to the story. In this movie the camera is constantly moving back and forth to give the audience that gritty realism that fits. The first movie was a lot calmer as well with the plot. This continuation is fast-paced and tense. The car chase in this movie was incredible. I can honestly say it was better than the Matrix Reloaded's highway chase because NO CGI's WERE USED! Movies are trying to create a new reality within the computer world and trying to make audiences believe that its really happening. Why not just take the extra effort and coreograph a real car chase that will have the audience on edge instead of crashing two CGI trucks head on? The climax of the chase in the tunnel was stunning. The movie overall was stunning. You will not find a modern day action thriller like this anywhere else .<br /><br /> ACTING: Matt Damon does a superb job in this role. I don't think I've seen frustration acted out as well as he does it. The other high point of this movie is Brian Cox (X2, Troy, The Ring) who plays the menacing Ward Abbott. I really like Cox as an actor because his roles seem so believable. Joan Allen (The Contender, Face/Off) makes a new role in this movie and does a decent job, but I found her performance a little forced. Almost as if she tried just a little too hard to be a top government bigot. Overall though the acting was superb<br /><br /> BOTTOM LINE: In a day where computers do everything for us, even entertain us at the movies, The Bourne Supremacy was refreshingly good. Nothing is overdone to point where you say &quot;oh, come on, yeah right&quot;. The Bourne Ultimatum is the next and final chapter in Ludlum's story and I can't wait.Abbott.

6303461484|4.0|Citizen X, based on the true story written by Robert Cullen entitled 'The Killer Department', is a relatively accurate movie account about the serial killer Andrei Chikatilo, the deadliest serial killer ever known.  Released August 7 of 2001, the movie runs 103 minutes, almost giving it ample time to ensure the story line doesn't suffer and the key elements of this true story stay reasonably intact.   Produced by Citadel Entertainment and Asylum Films, it pulled in several nominations and awards including the Cable Ace Award and an Emmy and Golden Globe for best supporting actor (Donald Sutherland).  Set in the Soviet Union before the fall of the Iron Curtain, Director Chris Gerolmo intertwines a manhunt along with the difficulties of dealing with the political system of the time.  Andrei Chikatilo, played by Jeffrey DeMunn, is the serial killer whose murders have spanned several years, killing a total of 52 people, 35 of which were under 17 years old.  Stephen Rea plays the forensic specialist, Lt. Viktor Burakov, assigned to the case and in place of modern technology uses his intuition to understand and track the killer down, later finding out that all of his guesses were extremely accurate.  Donald Sutherland plays Col. Mikhail Fetisov, the military figure Burakov reports to.  Sutherland does an impressive job in playing this role and is able to show the more humane side of the character.  I would have to say that the parts of the film dealing with the political resistance and their ignorance rival the aspects of the story dealing with the killer himself.  This film definitely deserves 4 stars, 5 would've been given if the run time could have been extended just a bit, allowing for more of the storyline to be added.  For those who enjoy such films as 'The Bone Collector', Silence of the Lambs', and 'Seven', this film is a must see.  Keeping in mind that when most films are derived from a book there is much lost in production.  This movie, however, does better thanmost considering the actual events spanned over 7 years.
B00006JLX4|5.0|In this 2-disc set you get a remastered version of Slanted and enchanted a few choice cut singles from the pre-matador sessions, a couple of alternate studio out-takes from the Slanted Era, the first John Peel sessions, the Watery Domestic EP, the song 'Greenlander' from the I Shot Andy Warhol soundtrack, the b sides from all singles released during that era, an entire concert from the Brixton Academy, and to top it all off you get an incredible packaging job w/original art work and incredible set of liner notes full of pictures and anecdotes from the band and those that were there. All I can say is that I'm an old time Pavement fan and I pretty much already own this stuff from bootlegs, and through tracking down singles and various other compilations. For the most part all of the material compiled is A+ material except for maybe the two studio outtakes and the repeat of Summer Babe 7&quot; version I found to be a little redundant as I can't even notice a difference from the original. The early pre-Slanted singles (Mercy Snack: The Laundromat, B.Blackstick, and My First Mine) may all sound a little too primitive to the uninitiated ear and fit best on the Westing By Musket and Sextant compilation. Outside of that you have an incredible album, with some of the funnest and wittiest songs to come out of the 90's. It's a classic album that spear headed the indie rock revolution. I believe that over time this band will fall right behind Nirvana is the most influential band to come out of the 90's (they've already left those nature kids STP and S.Pumpkins in the dust).

B00005JN2F|4.0|The Bourne Supremacy is a great action thrill ride that works on every level, even when you know it shouldn't because of plausability factors. Matt Damon is perfect as the amnesiac asassin, who must come out of hiding to save his name and life after he is found by a Russian agent. Joan Allen is very good as the person in charge of finding Bourne, and she helps take this franchise to the next level, as you respect her and what she is doing. Brian Cox is back on board as the man in charge of the operation that was terminated after Bourne left, and he is old reliable self. Julia Stiles has a bit more air time and has a very emotional scene with Bourne, as does Franka Potente as Bourne's lover. Paul Greengrass does a good job of replacing Doug Liman and the film is, like its predesessor, a cut above the rest of the action films and spy genre. Jason Bourne makes James Bond look like a nobody in the secret agent world.

B00005JMYG|4.0|Will Ferell shines as legendary anchorman Ron Burgundy in a film that is hilarious, yet still could have been funnier. While I applaud Ferell and his cast, especially Steve Carell as Brick, the movie feels disjointed and too many scenes feel ad-libbed, some for better and some not. There really is no plot, except Ferell is a chauvenistic anchorman who falls in love with a rival anchorwoman, yet it still works more than it fails. The fight scene with the rival news networks is the funniest scene in the film, and one of the funniest in recent memory. It couls have been a classic, instead of just having a few classic scenes.
B00005JN2F|5.0|Having not read any of the BOURNE books by Ludlum, my opinion is based strictly upon the merits of the movie.  That being said, this movie was a classic CIA thriller.  Matt Damon puts in another stellar performance as the uber-trained assassin, Jason Bourne.<br /><br />Hiding in India with his girlfriend and wanting nothing more than to be left alone, Bourne soon finds himself framed by a rogue element of the CIA in order to destroy files and steal millions.  When Bourne's girlfriend is murdered during a pursuit by a rival assassin, Bourne is motivated toward revenge.  Still suffering from amnesia, Bourne recalls bits and pieces of his first outing as an assassin--the same mission around which the whole plot revolves.  At the end, Bourne visits the daughter of the two people he murdered in Berlin and explains to her what really happened.  Bourne ultimately clears his name and makes those responsible pay.<br /><br />Additionally, the cat and mouse between Bourne and his CIA pursuers adds levity and tension.  Bourne proves his supremecy by always being one step ahead of the CIA.<br /><br />The film was stylishly filmed in a close-up, handheld camera style that puts you in the action.  Sometimes the camera work is so close you get nauseous from the thrilling car chases.  This was an excellent sequel that surpassed the original.  A great summer movie.

After a short physical engagement he finds out that the woman is Elektra Natchios(Garner) daughter to a billionaire shipping heir. The two quickly fall for each other, but the Kingpin has declared war on the Natchios family and they aren't safe. The Kingpin has hired Bullseye(Ferrel) to kill them. Know Matt must save the woman he loves before time runs out. <br /> <br />The acting in this movie is great. An all star cast was put togther for it. This movie had one of the biggest casts for a movie in 2003 with Affleck, Garner, Duncan, Favreau, Pantoliano, Ferrel, and cameos by Stan Lee and former Daredevil illustrator Kevin Smith. All of them are great in the movie and there isn't anything  to dislike about them. I can't believe Michael Clarke Duncan put on 20 more pounds for his role as the Kingpin. The guy is huge. I liked Jennifer Garner a lot. This woman is gorgeous and I could watch the movie for her alone. <br /> <br />The special effects are pretty good. They rival the first Spiderman movie. The costumes are pretty good as are the sets. Thisreally was a well made comic book movie. <br /> <br />Daredevil isn't your normal superhero. He's a much darker character. This movie is no Spierman or X-Men but it's good. If you like Superheros or action movies then pick this one up. It's pretty cheap and you won't regret it. It was a surprise hit grossing ove a 100 million in the U.S. so come enjoy what millions of other people have.
B00005JN2F|2.0|The action was good, the car chase in the end was great, the story was good. . .I think. Half the movie you couldn't make out because the camera was shaking so bad! I almost got sick in the theater and I'm nowhere near a person who gets motion sickness. I can understand what the director was going for. He wanted to make you feel like you were right along side Jason Bourne, but he used it way too much! Literally, about half the movie is a blur. In the end, the first one was a lot better. Some of the action scenes were good and there is a little bit of a twist in the end. Honestly, I would save your money and wait for rental. Atleast then, you can have a trash can nearby incase you feel like you are going to vomit.
0767803434|1.0|This is the kind of movie that should have never gotten to a studio once the script was written. It's so fake and it would never happen.  <br /> <br />Harrison Ford is the president and he's kidnapped aboard his plane by a terrorist Gary Oldman. He's negotating for the release of some of his comrades to the vice president played by Glen Close. Ford won't give up without a fight and he's determined to save his family and friends without Oldmans plans being met. <br /> <br />The movie is so fake it's sad. The plane would have been destroyed by pressure. It gets laced with 100's of rounds of ammo. Come on you have to make is somewhat believable. Wolfgang Peterson should be slapped upside the head for putting something like that in a movie. <br /> <br />Glen Close is horrible. Her dramatics are over the top. The fact that her character negotiates for the president is stupid. We don't negotiate with terrorists and the fact that they put that in his dumb. It's so fake. <br /> <br />The refueling plane blowing up is dumb. There are so many saftey devices in place that would never happen like that. You have to mkae a movie at look least real if your trying to make an action drama like this and it's not. <br /> <br />Russia would never give up dangerous men either. They'd tell us they felt bad for the president being in danger and would tell us to shove are demands where the sun don't shine. <br /> <br />This movie is way to fake. I couldn't enjoy it because it would never happen. I enjoy action dramas and this is one of the worst ones I've ever seen. If they had decided to make this more a drama and not so much action I might have been able to go along with it. The cast is awesome for the movie and a drama could have worked. The cast and talents are wasted. Why this made so much money I don't know. I guess people are stupid enough to follow the story. Don't waste your time or money on this one.
B00028HBKM|5.0|When this movie was released in theatres, I went to see it because I loved Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar.&quot; Since both the musical and the movie center around the same topic, Jesus's death, I figured that I would be able to enjoy it as much as the musical. I still love &quot;JCS,&quot; but this movie has much more emotional impact. <br />  <br /> When experiencing the movie (because it definitely is an experience), you hardly even realize that you're reading subtitles the whole time. Instead, you feel as if you're a spectator helplessly watching the story unravel before your very eyes. It IS very visual and gory, but I think that it is used appropriately, since the Scriptures tell us that that is what basically happened.  <br />  <br /> I think this is an awesome movie, for Christians and non-Christians alike. However, I think &quot;The Passion&quot; would have made an excellent a sequel to a movie that takes place before Jesus' death. &quot;The Passion&quot; could have used a better explanation of who he was as a person along with his impact on the people who heard him. Some scenes in the movie, such as the blurb of the &quot;stoning&quot; scene with Mary Magdalene, made sense only to those who were familiar with the Bible. I think if Gibson would be up to it, he could make this film to give a more well-rounded perspective on Jesus Christ. But, &quot;The Passion&quot; is, and always will be, an awesome movie. <br />  <br /> Watch this movie. It is definitely a powerful film, and an experience that will last with you. And don't believe the anti-Semitic junk that you've heard. As anyone who has seen this film can tell you, the Jews were not responsible for his death- we all were.
B00003CXXP|5.0|...because Artificial Intelligence just worked its way into cinematic history, and even though it borrows from Pincocchio, it is a better story too. <br /> A.I. tells the story of David, beautifully portrayed by Haley Joel Osment, as he works his way over a course of two thousand years so that he can be a real boy, seeing as how he is Mecha, or a robotic entity. <br /> David is adopted by Henry and Monica because their son, Martin, is stricken with illness and cryogenically frozen until a cure can be created. Monica is uneasy at first, but begins to &quot;love&quot; David, and she imprints her love on him using a series of words. This makes him love her, but after appearing to be a threat to Martin, he is dumped by his foster &quot;parents&quot; near their home in New Jersey. On his travels, he meets Gigolo Joe, a gigolo robot played by Jude Law, he escapes from a flesh fair that destroys robots, and he works his way to Manhattan in search for the blue fairy. David becomes trapped for 2,000 years, with a super teddy bear named Teddy being his only companion. He is rescued by extremely advanced robots, only to find that his mother is dead and the human race is extinct. <br /> A.I. is one of the most moving films I have ever seen, and it is a masterpiece from the cooperative minds of Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg. Spielberg's future is vibrant, dark, and beautiful. Any film fan will find Artificial Intelligence to be a special film unlike any other.
B00023BLXK|3.0|The new Dirty Dancing wants to be the the first. Same scenario, same kinds of scene (dancing in the water)It's DD except with a spanish accent. The actors are ok, nice to look at, but there's really nothing there. No funny moments like in the original. I was expecting more and was disappointed.
B0000070QN|5.0|Somehow this cd flew under my radar for many years. I'm so glad it somehow made it's way to me though. This is a benchmark of melodic rock, and is worth every penny...The songs are varied and well performed and produced. If you enjoy Winger,Hardline,Giant..etc etc...then you'll love this release. &quot;Empty Promises&quot; is so cool it's beyond description, reminds me of something off of Operation Mindcrime from Queensryche...(which is a great compliment for sure). <br /> Get yourself a copy... <br />  <br />
0156027321|3.0|As far as I am concerned, this is just a book - not a great book - just a book.  Have I read better novels than this?  Yes, many.
B0001Z52RU|4.0|Very enjoyable thriller with a twist of sci-fi and time travel that really explores cause and effect in a very thought provoking way... &quot;The flutter of a butterfly's wings can cause a tidal wave half way around the world&quot;. If this escaped you in the theaters, make sure you watch it on DVD on way or another! Really makes you think about how one persons actions, no matter how slight, affect so much! Thought provoking and deeply interesting!
B000244FDW|5.0|I have this on vhs and watch it at least twice a year.  It is very faithful to the novel, with wonderful acting from the entire cast.  This is what my teenage daughter and I reach for when we're home sick from school or work.

B00006LLLN|5.0|Alison Krauss & Union Station are the best example of bluegrass today. I'm not big on live albums, but, this is superb,  <br /> (except for the jerk wanting to hear himself later on!) Every song on this double live album is top notch, with such beautifully blended harmonies & unbelievable musical talent. This has quickly turned into one of my favorite &quot;goin' to Montana&quot; CD's and I've become a real Alison Krauss & Union Station fan.  <br /> You really can't go wrong with any of their CD's.
B0000AZKLF|5.0|This meeting of two blues masters took place in a Hamilton, Ontario Canada TV studio in late 1983, just after Vaughan had made his first splash as the guitarist on David Bowie's album Let's Dance.  Stevie had idolized Albert King, and even lifted some of his licks.  But on this night, the two stood side by side as blues masters, and the results were jaw-dropping.  King was clearly leading this session, as all the songs (with the exception of Pride & Joy) were sung by King and were part of his usual repertoire.  However, Vaughan was not simply a sideman here; his playing was electric and the interplay between the two guitarists is amazing.  Blues at Sunrise, with Vaughan imitating Jimi Hendrix, Call It Stormy Monday, and Don't Lie to Me are just a few highlights.<br /><br />The sound on this hybrid SACD is phenomenal.  Both guitars are crisp, the vocals are clear, and the tight rhythm section is deep and warm.  The SACD has a breathtaking presence that evelopes your listening area.  This is another terrific George Horn mastering job.<br /><br />Whether you are a fan of Vaughan, King, or just a fan of great blues guitar, this is a must own on SACD!

1572814349|5.0|As a fan pf the Rider Waite Tarot, I was always looking for a classy deck, that had an old feel to it, with the images used in the RWT.  After searching high and low, and many disappointments I finally came upon the Golden Tarot. <br /> <br />This is truly an amazing deck, the art work (a collage of Renaissance Paintings) is beautiful, and looking at the deck carefully you would never think they were collages, they look as if they were painted that way. <br /> <br />The edges of the Deck are Gold, like those old bibles Grandma us to have, the size of the deck is standard, and are a little ruff at first, but with use they become more comfortable.  This is one of those decks that are going to look better as it ages.  When you give people readings, this is the deck that gets remarks of how beautiful they are.  For the really affordable price, this is one of those decks you have to add to your collection. <br /> <br />For those who work with the RWT, this deck will be very easy to interpret, as the images are very familiar.  I highly recommend this deck.  Great Job Kat, this deck surly deserves the title as one of the most beautiful. <br />
B0002I831S|5.0|First off let me say that I have all 40 of the 2 episode discs and that I'm not at all happy that these are being released as season sets at a substantially cheaper price.  Conservatively, I've invested $600.00 in the series original release compared to $255.00 from Amazon for the 3 season rerelease.  That being said I would like to offer a possible reason as to the release as it initially was done.  All these episodes are old. They were all remastered and had a Dolby remix added.  This costs money (obviously) and requires time, so to recoup some of their losses they released them slowly over a period of a couple of years.<br /><br />I'm glad I have them. I've thoroughly enjoyed them over the past few years.  I would LOVE to have the rerelease,not the least that my storage space is limited too.  But for financial reasons it just ain't gonna happen. So, in conclusion, it would be nice if Paramount made some concession to us die-hard, loyal, original series fans who bought the original release, (I can't stand any of the later incarnations, either) but I'm sure that ain't gonna happen either.<br /><br />P.S. You REALLY want to get sick about this release?  Just check out what the Japanese release is going to be!  All 3 seasons... in a beautiful case with a working communicator.(cellphone)!!($1000.00 American)Yow!!!
0316776963|5.0|This book is an appropriate follow up to David Sedaris' &quot;Naked,&quot; and gut-busting hysterical as a warped series of essays can get. Sedaris' struggle with learning French is peppered throughout the book, which gets funnier as you go along. I drew stares as I read this on an airplane trip, as my fellow passengers wondered what I could be reading that would have me laughing so hard. This is by far the funniest Sedaris collection of essays available, from the chapter about the author trying to explain the rabbit's role in the American celebration of Easter to his speech therapy sessions to his observations of the midget who taught Sedaris how to play the guitar. This is great bedside, bathroom or airplane reading, enough to entertain you in the most twisted and pleasant of ways. Right up there with &quot;The Santaland Diaries.&quot;
B0001XAPX8|1.0|So you put 4 talented, or I think it's safe to say extremely talented, actors together and what is supposed to happen?? Not this! I'm in shock at the complete dullness of that movie. Don't get me wrong, Nicole Kidman and Anthony Hopkins, in whatever movie they are in, give a great performance, but this could have been one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Sure, it may have been well shot with nice scenes and good acting, but what ever happened to a little something called a plot? By the end of the movie I was praying for it to be over. I didn't care if any of the actors died because I had no sympathy for any of them except for the african american family. I'd like to know how some of these movies get made these days. The screenplay is one of the most important, if not the most important, aspect of movies and this movie bombed. Could it be any more miscasted? (is that a word) Also, there wasn't one twist. There wasn't one plot point that caught my interest. This movie could have been an amazing thriller but instead it was Hopkinds and Kidman having sex for two hours because... oh wait I don't know why they like each other. This movie could have been amazing, even with the same actors as it had. Kidman's past would be amazing if elaborated, and the whole sex deal between her and Hopkins would have to go. My favorite part of the movie, if you can call it that, is when the psycho crazy guy kills them both. I find this movie an insult to Hollywood and an embarresment to the actor's careers. I'd like to know what the director was thinking. Books are different than movies. Books can keep your interest in different ways than movies can, and I'm sure the novel it was based on was great, but this movie was a dissapointment, and I'm shocked at the five stars that appear on the site. If you want to see Kidman and Hopkins really give a permormance rent Instinct or The Others, not this excuse for a movie. Sorry if I was harsh, but I can't belevie what i just watched!
B00005JN2F|3.0|The first movie, Bourne Identity, was a perfect example of how to pull off this type of European-flavored intrigue flick with style and deadly action.  The first director, Doug Liman, did a fantastic job mixing his mastery of visuals with the drama and action that this story called for.  Look also to the master of the car chase, John Frankenheimer and his superb 'Manchurian Candidate', 'The French Connection', and 'Ronin' for how to do this kind of thing very well.  Or even some of the latest James Bond entries, which are finally starting to get it right. <br /> <br />So what happened?  I have to agree with the previous reviewers who said that way too much of this movie relied on the nausea-inducing camera jiggling to convey a sense of action.  When the action, story, and acting are good enough, tricks like this aren't necessary.  I think the film would have stood on its own without resorting to this kind of gimmick.  As it is, it detracts from its overall quality. <br /> <br />
B00000099Y|5.0|Words cannot describe the experience of listening to this album.  Everything about it screams to the inner-soul.  Maynard spits out venom with every verse, and Adam Jones intoxicates you with every chord.  This album is heavier than anything that Metallica and Guns and Roses has ever put out, but it is also more intelligent than any album in the last ten years.  Buy this album if you are tired of all the plastic so called heavy metal acts that have been prominent lately.  Buy this album because it is good!
6304068549|5.0|Of all the movies that revolve around robots, Short Circuit 2 must be the best in my opinion! At least twice a week, I watch this movie because I'm pratically addicted to it! I, along with many others, just hope that a third Short Circuit movie would be shown in movie theaters someday! You've got to buy the videocassette or DVD! Trust me, you are going love this movie!
B0001NBMBC|2.0|I'm sorry but I just don't like this album! The First two were great, but this one is less than good! One of the reasons is because they tried to add more statements to there music and SLIPKNOT is not about staements. SLIPKNOT is about anger and power taken to it's full extent, and sometimes even further! I think that any fan of SLIPKNOT says this is their best work, is on the wrong page
B000002H33|5.0|&quot;Master of Puppets&quot; is one of the best rock records of all time. With this recording, Metallica perfected a whole new genre of music, thrash/speed metal. This music is just as revolutionary and as influential as anything by the Beatles or the Beach Boys or Pink Floyd or any other such maverick group in the history of rock. Whether one enjoys this music or not, it would be disingenuous to deny its sincerity and originality. There were a few other bands around at the time going &quot;chug, chug,&quot; (Exodus, Anthrax...) but Metallica is responsible for shaping this style and turning it into an art. Metallica didn't just play fast and aggressive, they wrote interesting and purposeful compositions. By this record, even Hammett's guitar solos are carefully constructed to employ very unconventional harmony (check out the solos on &quot;Thing that Should Not Be&quot; and &quot;Santitarium.&quot;)  <br />  <br /> Unfortunately, it turns out that Cliff Burton was more than a little responsible for the band's excellence. After his tragic death, the Metallica began to slide downhill. There are still some good ideas on &quot;And Justice For All,&quot; but it was still a big step down from &quot;Master&quot; or &quot;Ride the Lighting&quot; for that matter. With the self-titled &quot;Metallica,&quot; it seemed that some group of imposters was intent on trashing the band's good name. Of course, this new dumbed down, frat-friendly Metallica sold more records and more tickets, but it also sold out - big time. Listen to the inspirational &quot;Orion&quot; from Master of Puppets and then listen to the metal pop ballad &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot; from the self titled release. Same band? Hardly. Cliff Burton must be puking in his grave. <br />  <br />

B000067G3C|5.0|On occasion, I crave for good action entertainment...but Jan De Bont's SPEED isn't just good, it's well-nigh spectacular. I watched this movie many years ago on video, and the sheer suspense and excitement its simple premise generated gripped me from start to finish. As far as I know, this is arguably the most perfect pure-action action movie I've seen yet.         Of course you know the premise: mad terrorist Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper) plants a bomb on an LA bus that will explode if the bus moves at over 50 mph at any point, and it is us to supercop Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) to foil Payne's plans. From that simple idea, though, director De Bont and screenwriter Graham Yost craft a crackling action thriller that moves from setpiece to setpiece, sustaining momentum all the way through. In lesser hands, SPEED might have seemed merely jagged, but De Bont skillfully hold it all together through sheer high energy. (This was De Bont's directorial debut, but perhaps his experience shooting action films like the classic DIE HARD helped him here in some way.)        The result is one of the best, most exhilarating of modern action films. Yost carries through his sipmle but creative premise without resorting to worn-out action cliches (there is no silly digital readout accompanying the bomb, for instance), and in his pursuit of action excitement he doesn't forget to bring his characters closer to the audience via colorful, distinctive dialogue. We always relate to the hero, and for this kind of action film, that's a good thing. The performances more or less get the job done, although Sandra Bullock shows a lot of appealing spunk in her heroine role---it's easy to see why she became a star after this movie. Reeves does well with the action heroics, and he is always convincing in his role. As for Hopper, as the creatively-named (hehe) villain, he shows once again (like he did in David Lynch's BLUE VELVET) that he is one of the best in the business at playing bad guys. He sure is bad, but Hopper brings a distinctive, almost charismatic, style to what could have been a generic villain performance in less experienced hands. And, of course, the action scenes are beyond reproach. Who could forget the bus' miraculous leap into the air as it attempts to jump across a gap in the highway? And the finale is simply spectacular, with a train derailment that John McTiernan tried to ape in the subsequent year in DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE.         In short, if you're looking for high action entertainment that may not necessarily revolutize the genre but gets the job done smashingly, SPEED fits the bill marvelously. I mean, with a title like that, which action-film fan could resist? Highly recommended.
B0001Z52RU|4.0|THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT is a film that has many flaws and challenges the concept of logic, indeed.  However, as a time travel adventure, it offers some complex scenarios, and challenges the theory that if you change one little thing, the results can be overwhelmiing.<br /><br />Ashton Kutcher does a convincing job as the young man who uses his childhood journals to travel back and try to change things for the better----each time making things worse for either himself or his loved ones.  Jesse James as the young badass Tommy is chilling; few child actors have conveyed such a sense of evil menace and complete psychosis.  Amy Smart does a good job in her many incarnations of Kayleigh.  The direction is sharp and imaginative, with the visual leaps in time handled quite well.<br /><br />The movie has a sad ending (at least in the director's cut), but it is fitting I guess since Kutcher was doing more harm than good in his attempts to recreate history.
B0000542D2|5.0|Rock and roll movies are a mixed bag, to say the least. They range from the genius (Stop Making Sense), to the good (The Last Waltz), the dated but watchable (Monterey Pop), the contrived but watchable (The Girl Can't Help It), the noble failure (U2 Rattle and Hum), the ignoble failure (Tommy), and the truly execrable (Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band). <br /> <br />Only a select few are true classics; A Hard Day's Night is one of them. In fact, I would go so far as to say that it is the classic rock movie. Not only did it cement the Beatles' worldwide fame, it redefined for an entire generation what rock and roll was--personified in four young men from Liverpool, who raised the bar for everyone that followed them.   <br /> <br />A big reason the film does this so well is that it presents the Beatles as stars, rather than relegating them to walk-on performances, as happened with so many other rock acts. Nor does it force the Beatles into roles they were unprepared or unable to play, as Elvis Presley's movies did. Instead, the film presents us with a slightly fictionalized, somewhat surreal version of a typical Beatles day. We see them running from train to hotel, press reception to performance, evading rabid fans, playing their songs, dealing with neurotic managers and TV producers, and trying desperately in the middle of it all to get some time to themselves. The essential theme is that of youth trying to get out from under the constraining thumb of authority--and if someone can come up with a better description of rock and roll, I'd like to hear it. <br /> <br />Many elements contribute to making this a classic film. One of them is the director, Richard Lester. A film like this requires a sure hand behind the camera and Lester has it. He never neglects the quality of the music for the sake of comedy, or vice versa, and finding excellent visuals at every turn. He has great comic timing, and knows just how long to hold a reaction shot, just when to cut to a close-up, just where to position his camera to bring out the best in a scene.  <br /> <br />Another factor is the man who wrote those scenes, Welsh playwright Alun Owen, who does a masterful job all around. He observed the Beatles in action before and while writing the screenplay, and he really captures their personas in his dialogue. His scenes highlight the Beatles as a group, and more importantly as individuals. Perhaps the best example of how he does the latter is the \\"shirts\\" scene with George Harrison. Corralled into a meeting with an overbearing teen-TV producer, Harrison is unfailingly polite, even as his laconic remarks become more and more scathing.  <br /> <br />The film is loaded end to end with great scenes: there's the opening dialogue on the train (\\"Who's that little ol' man?\\"); and the hilarious confrontation with the stuffed shirt (\\"I fought in the war for your sort!\\" \\"I'll bet you're sorry you won!\\"); the delirious backstage confessional between Lennon and the dowager who thinks John is...him; the great \\"he's very clean\\" running gag; and the antic lunacy of the makeup room scene, which parodies Shakespeare, television, the Queen, the Beatles, and the movie itself, all in about five minutes. And those are just the scenes that feature the Beatles-there are several hysterical scenes focusing on the secondary characters. <br /> <br />Which leads to another factor: the supporting cast. From Norman Rossington as the lads' hapless road manager, to John Junkin as well-meaning but dim roadie Shake, to the delightful Wilfrid Brambell as Paul's grandfather (probably the best performance in the film), to Victor Spinetti as the harried TV producer, there's not a bad performance in the film. For all that it focuses on the Beatles, this is at heart an ensemble film. The supporting roles are just as important as the leads, are written that way, and are played that way. Part of this was calculation on producer Walter Shenson's part; he shrewdly cast veterans in the rest of the film in case the Beatles proved to be bad actors. <br /> <br />But Shenson needn't have worried. His stars were naturals, equal to the task. Of course, they get a break in that all they have to do is be themselves. Doing that, though, is not an easy job when handling scripted dialogue--especially if you're bandying psychological jargon about, as Ringo and George do in a great early scene. But the Beatles handle their lines well, John and Ringo especially, and they have undeniable charisma. Part of this is due to where the group was in its career at that time. The Beatles then were four young, energetic men, just coming to realize they had the world by the tail, and the movie overflows with that confident, cocksure attitude. Whether they're cracking wise or playing their songs, it's difficult to take your eyes off them even today. <br /> <br />And that leads to the final and most vital component: the music. The songs here represent some of the Beatles' best early music: \\"Can't Buy Me Love,\\"  \\"And I Love Her,\\" \\"I Only Want to Dance With You,\\" \\"I Should Have Known Better,\\" \\"If I Fell,\\" and the classic title song. They add a lot to the movie's already considerable bounce and energy, and the Beatles perform them with elan...and that's the last, best ingredient. This movie is like the Beatles themselves-energetic, joyous, infectious, and above all fun to watch. It leaves you smiling, and singing along, and wanting to see it again...and if that isn't a classic movie, I don't know what is.
0743455967|5.0|Stephen King's publication credits are impressive, doubtless.  When I heard he had written a NONfiction how-to type of book about writing, I HAD to have it.  NOT because I love his novels. I DO like them; in fact,  I have read probably 7 or more of them, but not since high school.  I had to have the book because I had to know HOW King does it... how he writes all those books & how he has succeeded so unbelievably.   <br />His muse, his ideas, his writer's block, his accident.... it is all in there, in ON WRITING.   <br />I have a master's degree in English, and, believe me, I have read LOTS of books on writing.  This book, however, written in a nonprofessor-ish way, is the ONLY book which has caused me to pick up a pen and WRITE as a direct result of reading it.   <br />King tells me I CAN DO IT.  I CAN SUCCEED.  I don't have to be a total genius; I have to tell a story.   <br />The book is a lot like a seminar that Dr. King is giving JUST for an audience of one: YOU.  He speaks directly to you as if he is conversing with you.  It is personal, interesting, and applicable stuff. <br />Some people complain that they don't care for King's autobiographical stuff at the beginning part of the book. I thought it was very appropriate to include what he did.  Reading the background on his life showed me who the man IS behind these novels, that he is a REAL PERSON like I am who FAILEd in writing many times before he succeeded and who got rejection slips just like I do. <br />I loved the book & I read it cover to cover. It is no textbook; don't look to it with that expectation.  Just let it unfold before you as you read, and you will come away having learned from it.
B00023B1LC|2.0|If you already own &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; on DVD, you do NOT need to buy this extended version. There are only two additional scenes: a weak opening scene and a slightly alternate ending. The worst part about the two scenes is that they are still in the raw form: grainy with bad sound quality. It makes no sense to promote an &quot;Extended Edition&quot; and not finish/polish the two scenes. Univeral Studios really cheaped out on this one.

What wonderful acting, from both acclaimed and underrated actors and actresses.   Just try finding a bad performance in this film - I challenge you.   <br /> <br />Both the soryline and script were outstanding and the acting was superb. Try finding a weak performance in this film.

B00005U8EM|5.0|As close as a comedy can come to resembling a riveting suspense thriller without any murders or misdemeanours but a simple, engrossing premise -- a weather man caught up in a circadian cycle and having to relive variations of same moments with the same people around him.<br /><br />  How easily this could have imploded into insipid ideas but Groundhog Day succumbs to none of them. Danny Rubin's crisp writing comes up with a plenty of subtle swerves on the same encounters, mining new laughs out of Murray, who is not just great, he literally yanks the movie to life with his delirious impulses and effortless improvisation.<br /><br />  Best bit, apart from being the hilarious caper it is, the movie also couches a beautiful dynamic. Our quirky weatherman begins as a grouch, but through his existential tapeloop (the movie doesn't hint how many times he goes through it, but the crafts he picks up along the way suggest a number in the hundreds at the least) he undergoes a redemption that implies how we can, through sheer purity of intent and determination, get out of our respective ruts and make meaningful contributions to the world.<br /><br />  My humble suggestion: stop reading and get down to watching this all-time classic, pronto, on your own DVD disc, which will undoubtedly be one of your most prized possessions.

0452282152|5.0|The writing style of this intense novel, at first blush, seemed formal and dry, but I quickly discovered that it perfectly displayed the protagonist's personality and was necessary to build the realism. The need for a maid to remain emotionally distant from her employers and to manage the subservience were requirements for that line of work.  The novel's style not only seemed to match the time-place and the young maid, but also the painting style of Vermeer ... unpretentious, sharply detailed, coldly accurate, and yet, intensely evocative.  The tension between Griet and Vermeer is palpable and stays with you long after you've finished the book. Like the painting that prompted it, the book is beautiful and enigmatic in its passion held back.  Because the style is what it is, it becomes invisible, letting the reader disappear into the story completely.
B00000IZ0V|4.0|So the word had come down from on high. The mandarins have spoken, and the outline of Brando's career has begun to take form. In brief, he was a flash in the pan: a handful of great roles in the early 50s followed by a lengthy decline marked by occasional triumphs ascribed mostly to the efforts of other people. Entire decades, e.g. the 60s, went past without a single role worth noticing. <br />  <br /> Much as I hate to contradict my betters, this is a load of crapola. A master's talent may ebb and flow, but it seldom fails completely. Brando made good films in every period of his career. In the 60s, supposedly his artistic Gobi, we can point to The Chase, Morituri, Burn!, and One Eyed Jacks. <br />  <br /> One Eyed Jacks is in many ways the most interesting of the lot. It's one of Brando's few Westerns, and the only film he directed. (Everyone knows the Kubrick story, which, I think, goes a long way to explain why the film has been dismissed.) One question that occurs to me is whether it was filmed from the Burst of Vermilion script that Truman Capote had such fun sneering at in his interview with Brando. But whatever the case, Jacks is no actor's film, it's a fully realized picture, a fine example of the gritty, adult Western that began appearing the 50s and reached its apotheosis in Peckipah's work a decade later. <br />  <br /> The acting is uniformly superb. Brando is at his best, a mercurial, Byronic figure as frightening as he is appealing. Brando excelled at playing rebels, and Rio ranks as such with Terry Malloy and Stanley Kowalski. Supporting roles are more than adequately filled by such Western regulars as Katy Jurado, Ben Johnson, and Slim Pickens (Jacks is obviously the source of Terry Southern's great story about Picken's first meeting James Earl Jones, who wanted to know what it like working with Brando: &quot;Wayul, I worked with Bud Brando for six months, and he never done nothin' that weren't all man and all white.&quot;) Karl Malden's whipcracking performance will come as quite a surprise to those familiar only with his television persona. The only exception is the love interest, an anorexic little thing who, thankfully, is not onscreen for very long. <br />  <br /> Earlier reviews make it clear that the available versions vary widely in quality, to say the least. I saw it in this one, a dark, overexposed version with the focus more than iffy (that's why the rating is docked a notch). A pity, since the cinematography seems exceptional. One of these days, somebody will need to prepare a cleaned-up version so that we can make a fairer judgement of the thing. As it stands, Brando's eye appears to have matched his acting talents. It's a shame he didn't go on to direct others. <br />  <br /> The impulse to cut down the tall trees is perfectly understandable, which doesn't make it any less contemptible. It's a lot easier to sneer at an artist's eccentricities, weight problems, and severely dysfunctional offspring than to actually analyze the work, which could be open to error and might even put you in the firing line. But after all that is forgotten, the films and performances will remain. One Eyed Jacks will be prominent among them. <br />  <br />  <br />
B000002I25|5.0|The brilliance of the Doors' 1967 self-titled debut pretty much speaks for itself. Right out of the gate, this band were a rock force to be reckoned with. The towering voice, charisma, and sex appeal of singer Jim Morrison, the electrifying keyboard work of Ray Manzarek, the powerful guitar chords from Robby Krieger, and the incredible ace drumming from John Densmore all combined to make the Doors a truly unique band in the history of rock. Note for note, song for song, &quot;The Doors&quot; is a perfect debut album, with every single tune on the disc a Doors classic. Where to begin? &quot;Break On Through,&quot; &quot;Soul Kitchen,&quot; &quot;The Crystal Ship,&quot; &quot;Twentieth Century Fox,&quot; &quot;Light My Fire,&quot; &quot;Back Door Man,&quot; &quot;End Of The Night,&quot; and the 11 1/2 minute epic, &quot;The End&quot;....heck, ALL the songs, simply outstanding. Morrison & company were, and ARE one of rock's greatest groups. &quot;The Doors&quot; is a total keeper.
B00005JN2F|4.0|The type of cool suspense you would expect from Bourne, but not the same partnership work he had with Marie in the first movie.  Still a very entertaining action packed film.  Can't wait for the next one!
B00004R99K|1.0|I was so disappointed after reviewing this with my 3 year old grandson. For some unknown reason, &quot;they&quot; decided to make this a more contemporary version. It's too fast, jumps all over the place, too many animation details, redone characters don't fit the story, the original songs are revised, cut short, and hyped-up, to give just a few examples. I am at a complete loss to understand why this wonderful story had to be tinkered with. I sure hope they don't do this to Bambi, Pinoccio, or the original Pooh. The reason these originals are so valuable, (especially Pooh), is that the characters have personalities. They relate to one another and they take time to have a conversation and work on mutual problem solving or just having simple fun. They teach a moral that doesn't get lost in the quest of being &quot;modern&quot;. My three grandchildren, age 3, age 3 1/2, and age 5, are inthralled with the originals. They can even sing, completely, every song in each.
0812417755|5.0|There are few books that I have read in my lifetime that left such big imprint on me. One of the most imaginative, if not original books that I have ever read that I always go back reading to is Kurt Vonnegut Jr.'s &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot;. A friend and former co-worker of mine at a local grocery store I had worked at one summer gave me a copy of this vivid story. This was my first (and only) exposure to Kurt Vonnegut Jr.'s writing. The second I started reading the book, I was immediately hooked.<br /><br /> The premise of the book centers around Billy Pilgrim. One minute he is reliving his days as a solider and currently serving his country in Dresden. Eventually he is captured by the enemy and ends up in the cellar in a slaughterhouse. Then the following scenario has Billy being kidnapped by aliens from the planet Tralfamadore where he would be put on exhibit like an animal at the zoo along with a popular adult entertainment celebrity Montana Wildhack. If that wasn't confusing enough, Billy manages to do some time traveling between earth and Tralfamadore. Somehow Kurt manages to keep the entire story flow cohesively together. I was wildly entertained and still am whenever I feel like reading this book. There was a good enough humor from the sub-plot as an exhibit for the Tralfamadore aliens entwined with the poignancy of Billy's days as a solider of war and his role as father and husband. Thirty five years later after it was published, &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; still remains relevant to society as it did back in 1969. It is truly an immortal classic for me.
6301763041|5.0|This is by far my most favorite movie of all time. Johnny Depp is pure hotness, especially with the tears. Crying never looked so sexy. The whole movie was hilarious, even though almost all of it was incredibly corny humor, incredibly corny acting... But that was the best part about it. The corniness. It was amazing. Johnny...fecking...Depp. Yes. That is the sh**.
B00003CXZ4|1.0|Way overrated and not worth the time. Joe Pantoliano is usually good (even when the film isn't) only this time it's not his fault at all--because there isn't much for him to do. <br /> <br />The gimmick (short term memory loss) would have worked had the film been no more than thirty minutes) alas, this thing drags on and on. <br /> <br />How often can you sit through the same scene over and over and over and over... <br /> <br />By the time this flick ended I didn't care who did what to whom.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Well, if it isnt THE best, it is one of the best DVD sets for a film. <br /> <br />To begin with, this is the 2nd installment in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and like before, Peter Jackson delivers a winner.  Capturing the amazing spirit of Tolkien's work, Jackson brings Middle Earth alive.  The basic plot, involves Sam and Frodo taking the ring closer and closer to Mordor, while the rest of the Fellowship attempts to regroup and face the growing threat of Saruman in Rohan.  The film has incredible performances from its all-star cast once again.  In addition, the special effects and filming locations bring an amazing new look to Middle Earth and really put the viewer in the story. <br /> <br />Now, for the DVD...This Extended Edition DVD set is absolutely incredible.  With more featurettes and an extended version of the film with deleted scenes reinsterted into the film, this is a moviegoers must have.   <br /> <br />Buy the extended version and enjoy hours and hours of more content on one of the best adventures ever. <br />
B00000IMCZ|4.0|This, and other works of Leni Riefenstahl that I've viewed, have given me more insight into the art of the cinema than most other productions I've studied. It is too bad that politics are brought into reviews of the art of the cinema. It seems that there are those, much as was done by herr Schickelgruber, that yearn for a forum -- any forum -- in hope of being recognized. Of course, many fail to provide names to which one might attribute full credit.  Pathetic. <br />TomF
B00005JMYG|5.0|Yes I'll admit this wasn't one of Will Farwell's best films, certainly not better than OLD SCHOOL, however somehow I found this film extremely funny at times. Perhaps seeing it in a theater with more than 200 people and there was some social pressure to laugh, but I found the character Ron and his fellow news men, especially the wheather guy who was particularly dumb to be hilarious. Sure the script was sophomorish but I didn't go out to see this film with the expectation that it would be anything else.
B000001C6M|5.0|As soon as I put this cd in my walkman, I had a feeling that it would tear up everything in its path...As soon as Evil Has No Boundries kicks in, you know that guitarists Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman can RIP!!! The lightning fast intro picks up speed and Tom hits those memorable high notes and the drums pound away mercilessly...the onslaught begins...&quot;Blasting our way through the boundries of hell&quot;....The speed isn't compromised at all through this song....Next up is The Antichrist, a personal favorite of mine...The tempo is moderately fast, but not as fast as Evil Has No Boundries. Die by the Sword is another personal favorite partly because of the stomp during the chorus: DIE BY THE SWORD!!!...Fight Till Death is another thrashy fast song...Uncompromising, no doubt....Metal Storm/Face The Slayer is the epic structured number on the album with its melodic solos in the intro, a little slowed down, but still fast...Black Magic is very fast and thrashy with its catchy riffs and outstanding lyrics...Tormentor is a heavier piece but its slowed down from all the fast songs on here, dark melody in the chorus...The Final Command picks the pace up to the speed of Fight Till Death or Evil Has No Boundries...Great lyrics, even BETTER fretwork.....Crionics is the mellowest song here, but that doesnt stop it from being heavy...Melody involved and the outro solo is OUTSTANDING!!! The grand fanale is the title track: Show No Mercy...It starts with a great drum intro from Dave Lombardo and then the lightning fast riffage and brutality that is Slayer throws you up against the wall and beats you into submission..Satanic lyrics about the apocalypse are the subject of this song...VERY FAST!!!! <br /> 5 stars because its GREAT for a debut album from a band that are in their late teens/early twenties... <br /> Standout tracks: The Antichrist, Die By The Sword, Black Magic
B00004ZD69|5.0|I had no idea what I was in for when i first started this cd. I had not really listened to a lot of post rock before i got this cd, and I kinda pictured it to be just like Mogwai i guess. But about 5 minuets into the cd, I was in another world. The music was so incredible, so beautiful, and it just drew me in. Other then that, just read other reviews if u want to read more into it. If you are into post rock at all, then u will agree this is no doubt one of the best cd's in the genre. If you are new to it, I would suggest listening to something like Mogwai first, and if u like that then go straight out and pick up this cd. I never thought that one day I would be listening to anything this, because for so long all i was listening to was Nu-metal and rock. So I would encourage anyone to go out and give post-rock a chance. It is now my favorite type of music.
B0001XAPX8|2.0|As I have not read the original book by Philip Ross, I cannot say for certain whether or not the book is better than the film -- kind of usual debate surrounding any novel.  But I can say this for sure -- the story about is very interesting, and the theme very intriguing, but the unbelievable casting ruins everything. <br /> <br />Anthony Hopkins plays a Jewish professor of classic literature, Coleman Silk, who resigns his post after referring to the absentee student, using, some argue, politically incorrect word.  Remember, the time is set in 1998, when that kind of PC debate was still going on.  Silk, after losing his job and wife too, meets a chain-smoking woman Faunia Farley, who works at university and post-office, played by Nicole Kidman.  And Faunia, it seems, is trying to shake off the sad, traumatic memories about her husband who came back from Vietnam (Ed Harris). <br /> <br />All these stories are told by Zuckerman, generally supposed to be alter ego of the writer Ross, and Gary Sinese appears as him, living alone in a hut.  Then Zuckerman (and we) will know the secret of Professor Silk, who in fact was not Jewish, and buried secrets about his family in the past. <br /> <br />Now, think about this.  Anthony Hopkins, born in Wales if I am not mistaken, is hardly the right choice for the role.  Not that he is not intellectual ... he definitely is ... but he never looks the way the film requires.  And Sinese as Zuckeman is also a strange choice, for Zuckerman must be, considering his profile, much older than Sinese is.    <br /> <br />And the same thing goes to Nicole Kidman.  After playing Virginia Wolfe or Satine, she cannot play this role.  I don't say that a chain-smoking woman  working at a dairy farm cannot be like Nicole Kidman.  It's only that we have seen too many of her, and we feel that she is stretching her acting too much. <br /> <br />What is most regreattable is that the younger Coleman Silk played by Wentworth Miller is so convincing.  I knowhis personal background, and that lends some power to the credible character, but the fact is that Mr. Miller himself is a talented actor, perhaps, as far as the film goes, better suited to the role of Mr. Silk, than Hopkins, who is getting hammier these days. <br />   <br />The film is beautifully shot (the last film by photographer Jean-Yves Escoffier), and the theme is a worthy one, but the script by Nicholas Meyer is curiously hollow.  It sporadically delves the deeper places of the character(s), but is too busy keeping up with the pace, trying to include many things in the film.  Strange thing is, Zuckerman, who should be the link to the characters, is least effective, just muddling through the novel's world.  Did we need him after all? <br /> <br />I am hugely disappointed by the result, and especially the casting, though I admit that the central characters are interesting, and the material is worth discussing.  Maybe we should read the book, as many reviewers would say after watching the filmed versions of their beloved books.
6305842442|5.0|The movie itself is a materpiece of cinematography. I remember watching it as a kid of 11 and just being in awe of how awful a place LA was made out to be and how true its decline seemed.  In the movie, LA seemed to have been overrun by an Asian population, was in an utter state of decay, and everything was dark because you couldn't see the sun for all the smog and rain. Perhaps this is what it will look like in the far future when we get to the point where we can live on other worlds. People will leave the Earth in droves and head for other planets, just like today people leave the inner city and flock to the suburbs. <br /> <br />     The DVD itself is lacking, what with 2.0 sound instead of 5.1 and what looks like a lasterdic transfer. The movie itself more than makes up for it. Here's to hoping Ridley Scott gets to make a definitive version of his movie before he dies if the fool at Univision who owns this film ever lets him. <br /> <br />** Here be spoilers *** <br />  <br /> Reasons why the Director's Cut is better in my opinion: <br />  <br /> 1) No cheesy voiceover. If you need a voiceover to figure out what's going on, just watch it again and pay attention. <br /> 2) No cheesy happy ending. It's enough of a happy ending that Deckard leaves with Rachael at the end. <br /> 3) Removed gore for gore's sake. I don't need to see Tyrell's eyes being gouged out, thank you, in order to figure out what awful thing is going on. You can form your own mental image of what's happening as Rutger Hauer's sweaty face shakes and contorts from inhuman exertion while Tyrell screams. <br /> 4) The unicorn. Ridley may not have intended for Deckard to be a replicant at its original release, and it may not even be be the unicorn scene that was shot for Blade Runner, but it is a thought-provoking concept. Deckard believes he is a human with as much conviction as Rachael did, except nobody has told him otherwise. Likewise, he has no reason to believe otherwise because he has memories - albeit artificial - to backup his sense that he is human. <br /> <br />How does anyone know they're human when science and technology reach the level that they are in Blade Runner?  Memories?  The fact that you look and act like everyone else?  You can't be certain.
0786869143|5.0|This 10-year study with volunteers reveals that good fortune is not primarily due to talent, hard work or intelligence. The scientific investigation is based upon interviews and experiments with people who consider themselves lucky; the author concludes that luck is a state of mind that may be cultivated.<br /><br />Wiseman identifies four principles that underlie a life of good fortune, adherence to which will draw good luck into the life of the individual. These are 1. The belief that you are lucky (lucky people create, notice and act upon chance opportunities. They also have a relaxed attitude to life). 2. Lucky people make success happen by using their intuition and gut feelings. 3. One must expect good fortune, hold fast to this belief and persevere in attempting to achieve your goals. 4. Lucky people have a knack for transforming back luck into good luck. One must affirm your good fortune and have a strong conviction that everything will work out for the best.<br /><br />The text is illustrated by graphs illustrating the research results plus some black and white illustrations of playing cards. Overall the conclusions are quite impressive and I find the results of the study very convincing. There are plenty of exercises and the book concludes with notes that include bibliographic references. It is heartening to finally see scientific proof of the claims made by sages and esotericists down the ages
B00000HYXB|5.0|I have been a huge fan of Tolkien for quite some time, so naturally I absolutely adore Silmarillion. I'm not much of a metalhead, more rock, but when one of my fellow Tolkien-heads reccomended the cd, I decided to give it a shot. I was completely blown away. It takes a little listening to get over giggling a bit at Hansi's vocals, but the melodies are intoxicating, the lyrics soulful, and some of the lyrics are even taken straight from the book. I can easily say that if I were stuck on a desert island with one cd, this would probably be it. It is one of the only cd's I can listen to straight through without getting sick of a redundant style or sound. Just sit back, relax, and let your mind wander to Middle-earth with the help of one of the greatest cd's of all time!

Waste of money since the whole album seems to be spent trying to make the continuous soundtrack sound interesting but fails miserably.  Pink Floyd is one of the few who can make a 15 minute riff sound great.

B0001MDP3G|4.0|Nicole Kidman plays the daughter of preacher Donald Sutherland who has moved from the more civilized Charlotte to the small community of Cold Mountain, in order to improve his health.  She can't help but notice a young man named Inman (played by Jude Law) but he is shy and they hardly exchange a word.  When the Civil War is declared, Inman goes with the rest of the men to fight, but before he leaves he and Kidman share a kiss which foreshadows a romantic relationship.  He leaves and the rest of the movie flahses back and forth between scenes of him fighting and then deserting the army and she trying to survive on the farm after her father dies.  Renee Zellweger plays a young woman who can work like a man and she helps teach Kidman how to do the same.  Zellweger is outstanding in her role as Kidman's feisty sidekick.  The scenery is beautiful and the story is compelling after the first half hour or so, when the Civil War scenes overload the senses and sensibilities.
B00004R99U|5.0|I guess I don't look at the techical aspects of these Disney movies.  I look at how my daughter responds to them.  She loved Pocahontas and became so interested that we took her to Jamestown.  She loved that too.  As for Pocahontas II, I think she would have been just as happy with it no matter what the ending was.  It kind of helped that Pocahontas ended up with John Rolfe in the movie--try explaining to a 4 year old who has only seen the first one that in real life she married John Rolfe, not John Smith. Don't get me wrong, I'm ok with the movies not being historically accurate, after all they are just cartoons.  Even at the age of 4 my daughter is able to enjoy both movies over and over again, and still learn about what really happened to Pocahontas at Jamestown and in England.  So on that note, if she's happy, then I'm happy.

0802130208|4.0|THE CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES is one of the strangest novels I've ever read, but that translates as meaning, also, \\"fabulously original.\\" I had no idea what to expect, and I will admit from the first paragraph until the final moments, I had not idea what was coming next, who would do what, and what the whole point would be. I was grateful for an understanding of classic comedy because putting it into the context of that genre, the characters freeing themselves from their constrictions, and the rejuvenation in the end of one of them, helps to give structure to the mass of this.<br /><br /> But this book is STRANGE, even with that window of understanding. The main character, Ignatius J. Reilly is the anti-hero of anti-heros. He is in no way likeable. He is slovenly, selfish, dismissive, judgmental, insulting, egoistic, superior and a blow-hard. Most of the other characters don't seem much better. Though his mother is long-suffering at the hands of Ignatius, she isn't blameless in the way he's turned out or in the way the two of them proceed as a family. Ignatius's ex-girlfriend, who is now his pen-pal of blame and pessimism, is self-righteous about her never-ending causes, but it is clear to see that she is in it for her personal gratification and cares very little for the actual people she is supposed to be helping. After several chapters, I burst out in frustration, \\"Why are we reading this book? These people are vile!\\" But the wildly careening plot, the characterizations and the humor kept me going until the end.<br /><br /> The plot seems to move from the point at which Ignatius's mother got in a car accident at the beginning of the book after Ignatius barely eludes capture by the police for being \\"a suspicious character.\\" Due to financial straits, Ignatius must earn money to pay of the bills for the accident. He tries his hand at two separate jobs, each time interpreting the positions in his own Ignatius J. Reilly way, and each time coming up with a bizarre turn of failure.<br /><br /> This book is FUNNY. There are some things in here I will continue to refer to, such as Ignatius's sayings: When he is shocked by something, he bellows, \\"Do I believe what I am hearing?\\" and when he is upset with someone's behavior, he hollers, \\"She must be lashed!\\"<br /><br /> It's a sloshing whiz-bang (though oxymoronical, I think that fits this book) of a novel. I recommend it.ng up with a bizarre turn of failure. <br /><br />  <br /><br /> This book is FUNNY.

This is the best work they have done in a long time.  It showcases the tremendous talent in the members of this band.  The return of Steve Rothery to the forefront is a blessing.

Thank god they are coming back over the pond this fall to roll the Marbles.

B000148KK2|2.0|Diana Krall's latest CD is, unfortunately, not in her usual exciting style. Ms Krall needs to go back to her roots--jazz and ballads--where she excels. This CD is a great disappointment to one who has all her collection and has attended a number of concerts. It is dull, it doesn't swing (as she is so capable of doing). The lyrics are not uplifting at all, and the music, although it has its moments, is not up to her past great offerings. Although I was tempted to rate this CD with one star, I gave it two, because this is Diana--still a great jazz pianist and singer. Let's hope she goes back to her 'original room.'

B00008EY9G|5.0|Sick and tired of those ordinary thrillers that are all fluff and very little substance?  'Identity' may be the answer that you're looking for, as it is a clever and dark thriller with a solid story, a terrific cast and a great look and feel to it all.  The film revolves around ten strangers who end up at a little motel due to a horrible storm.  All of them have been brought there by chance... or, is it a little more complicated than that?  They think they're out of the woods until people start getting butchered left and right, in a countdown fashion.  What appears to be nothing more than a murderer on the loose having his or her fun ends up being something a lot more sinister and threatening.  Have these ten individuals been picked at random, or have their fates been sealed from the very beginning?<br /><br />When I started watching this, I thought to myself, 'Oh boy, I bet you I know exactly how this is going to end.'  I was wrong.  The film takes a lot of clever and unexpected twists that really goes to show you how great a thriller can really be if the right brains are behind it all.  It has some great suspense and frightening moments, an intriguing plot that likes to play around with your mind, and it delivers a very confident presentation.  You'll recognize a good majority of the cast, as some of them include John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Amanda Peet and Rebecca DeMornay.  All are great, especially Cusack who proves that he can be a successful lead role in a top-notch thriller.<br /><br />The DVD has some cool goodies to offer.  You can watch it in widescreen or fullscreen, depending on which is your preference.  You also have the choice to watch the theatrical cut, or the extended version (not to be mistaken for a 'director's cut').  I must be honest and admit that the extended version is really not worth it.  The added scene does nothing to enhance the movie and the so-called 'alternate ending' isn't alternate at all, as it is merely extended by only a few seconds.  It was interesting to watch, but again it really doesn't do anything special for the film.  Stick with the theatrical version, then watch the extended version if you're still curious.  Trust me, the theatrical version is the way to go.  Other bonuses included on the DVD are deleted scenes, commentary, storyboard comparisons, theatrical trailer, filmographies and a behind the scenes featurette.  The film looks and sounds great.<br /><br />'Identity' is definitely something that should be checked out by those who are tired by the usual flops that dare to call themselves 'thrillers.'  This is a successful and smart thriller that offers chills along with an impressive script and cast.  Just be sure to give it a chance.  You may think you have it all figured out when it starts, but trust me when I tell you that this movie will play around with your brain until the ending credits.  A more than well-done thriller that doesn't disappoint and is worth re-watching again and again. -Michael Craneconds.

B00003CXXM|5.0|I fail to understand the negative reviews of this film. Two reviewers called it &quot;boring&quot; and took to timing the lengths of the action sequences.<br /><br /> I suppose these types of reviews are inevitable in this day and age of non-stop violent video games and those ridiculous John Woo conflagurations.<br /><br /> This film is however anything but boring. I don't exactly recall then the book was first published but I read it when it was new and felt it raised the bar for spy stories. Remember that this book is at least 25 years old. Updating the story and making changes to better fit a film format is not only understandable but should be expected, even demanded.<br /><br /> Anyway, I rate this movie as excellent in almost every way. While it may not be exactly like the novel ( why would anyone want that anyway?) I think it reflects the spirit of the novel wonderfully.<br /><br /> I was very impressed with Damons portrayal of the amnesiac assasin and the director played out the scenario of discovery as well as anyone could ever hope for. I thought the action scenes were exactly what I would have wanted to show the skill and programming of a Treadstone killer. No these were not over-choreographed John Woo silliness that go on and on. Bourne gets the job done quick, the other guy is down NOW.<br /><br /> Look carefully at the sequences. When Bourne was threatened or went into action he did it automatically amost robotically like he was eexecuting a subroutine and came right out of it when it was over. I thought this was perfectly done and helped the viewer understand better what the Treadstone project was.<br /><br /> The apartment scene in Paris is one of my favorites. I loved seeing Bourne and Marie acting like two high school kids alone for the first time disvcovering each other and not sure what to do next, thne Bourne popping into his killer/fighter mode instantly, put the attacker down then get the girl out. Potente for her part played it out so well, from being coyly interested to fear, to fright, to shock and then recovery. Very realistic in my opinion. Just the way you might expect a real person to react in that situation.<br /><br /> I though the chase scene was likewise realistic, and I loved it when they parked the mini after alluding the last policeman. Watch Marie's range of facial expressions when Bourne is telling her what they have to do next. I loved it. Potente did a marvelous job of communicating real feelings with just her face a few short syllables.<br /><br /> Director Liman also did an excellent job of brining out the mystery slowly, where each answer only led to more questions. It kept the viewer guessing all along.<br /><br /> This movie was extremely well done and a fine tribute and introduction of the Bourne saga to the big screen.<br /><br /> Ignore those shallow reviews that only want more kicks, punches and rounds expended and fight scenes laid out like a line dance at a disco. Leave that brainlesss nonsense to John Woo movies. This is a thinking persons spy movie.<br /><br /> Plus I loved the ended. Wonderful. Maries last line is absolutely priceless.ed it out so well, from being coyly interested to fear, to fright, to shock and then recovery. Very realistic in my opinion.

B000071ZZI|1.0|Some other guy called this movie the boring identity, he couldnt be more right.  First of all there is about 3 mins and 30 secs of action in the entire movie.  There are 3 fights which are about 20 secs long each, and theyre all the same bourne grabs one guys arm punches the other guy in the face then punches the first guy then maybe if your lucky he'll throw a kick completing the fight.  The so called car chase is like 2 mins and involves a mini cooper doing 20 mph the whole time, turning in alleys, goin down some stairs, then making some kinda get away in the subway, thats it, there no crash or explosion or even high speed, some guy called this chase unforgettable, maybe because its so short and uncomplicated that its not hard to forget.  The story as been done before, but its kind of interesting, but not enough, the performances are barely above mediocre, esspecially matt, and the action sucks(seeing as how ive been in better fights and droven faster and better then damon did in possibly what could be the worst car chase ever) so i give the movie a 1 out of 10 for trying to be a good action movie and having one kinda cool explosion(that really didnt make sense, why did a shotgun shot in the side door make the car explode don't understand they put the gas tank in the door maybe?), anyway dont waste your time, hopefully the sequel will be better but i doubt it.
B00008BRDX|5.0|Synchronicity remains my favorite Police album. However, after listening to Regatta closely for the past month or so, I would have to say that it has replaced Ghost in the Machine as my second favorite Police album. The punk edge (and rhythms of reggae) that make their first album so much fun to listen to is still in full force on Regatta De Blanc, but here the Police begin to experiment with sounds and ideas that would take a more solid shape in the last half of their short time together.      While it still contains songs with a punk edge (such as Message in a Bottle and It's Alright for You), the band started to distance themselves more from their roots, while at the same time encorporating the spirit of it into the rhythms of their music, a technique they'd perfect towards the end on Ghost In the Machine and Synchronicity. The Police had proven that they were no strangers to experimentation with the B-Side of Outlandos D'Amour (in particular the song Be My Girl - Sally). But with their second album, the lads (in particular Sting and Stewart Copeland) really began to hone their penchant for experimenting with a song's rhythmic and lyrical content.      The title track, Regatta De Blanc, is a fantastic exercise of the former. This song in particular shows drummer Copeland's fondness for very subtly building percussion within a song, adding layer after layer as the song progresses, as well as adding or removing notes once he's established a beat. The guitar parts of Andy Summers more or less follow this fashion. Sometimes the notes are packed tightly together, and other times they are spaced out. The song ends with a nice little jam reminiscent of the chords Summers played on Message in a Bottle.      Speaking of Message in a Bottle, we've all heard that one on the radio, so I won't waste too much time with it. All I'll say is that it is a good, solid Police song, and definitely a good opener for the album. I enjoy it a lot. But it's not my favorite song on this one.      That honor would have to go to Bring on the Night, a rocking, yet reflective tune laden with a reggae-tinged rhythm guitar (overdubbed with a group of nastier licks hearkening back to the Outlandos sessions), a haunting vocal harmony made all the better by the melancholy contect of Sting's lyrics, and a disjointed drum melody loaded with punch. Copeland seems to enjoy playing with the cymbals a lot, and gets very erratic and unpredictable with them at several points on the album, but it always seems to fit with the rest of what's going on.      Stewart Copeland wrote three of the eleven songs on this one, which was more than on later albums. One of the three, Contact, is a song that one imagines could have become more well-rounded if Copeland had more time to work on it (\\"I've got a lump in my throat about the note you wrote/ I'd come on over but I haven't got a raincoat\\"). Not that it's a bad song. But probably his best moment is in the song On Any Other Day. His voice isn't as melodic as Sting's, but it only adds to the song's tragic humor, a tale about a man who has all manner of bad things happen to him on his birthday (\\"My wife has burned the scrambled eggs/ The dog just bit my leg/ My teenage daughter ran away/ My fine young son has turned out gay\\"). Of course, one doesn't realize it's his birthday until the final chorus, when the birthday song begins to intermingle with Copeland singing, \\"and it would be okay on any other day.\\" All in all, it's definitely the most well-rounded of the Copeland songs on the album. As one gathers from hearing the rest of the Police's catalog, one of Sting's favorite lyrical themes is relationships. His rhyming schemes were very childish at times, but also very profound. Ironically, the best example of this from Regatta came not from Sting, but from Copeland, in the song Does Everyone Stare. It rolls out like a child's nursery rhyme (\\"I want to write you a sonnet, but I don't know where to start/ I'm so used to laughing at the things in my heart/ Last of all, I'm sorry 'cause you never asked for this/ I can see I'm not your type and my shots will always miss\\") yet at the same time it has substance as it spins a tragic tale of insecurity. But, in typical Police fashion, it's done over an upbeat reggae-flavored melody which includes piano.      Overall, this is an album loaded with raw energy, much like Outlandos D'Amour. Unlike their debut album, though, this one is primarily about incorporating new elements into their rapidly evolving sound, as well as experimenting with new themes and ideas. It's more or less the jumping-off album for the rest of the Police's history, and were it not for Synchroncity, would likely be my favorite Police album.
B00003CX95|5.0|This is by far the greatest movie ever made, unquestionably.  If you dont like this movie, then im sorry you are just a moron, who wouldnt know entertainment if it bite them on the a$$.  The story can't be beat, its deep, dramatic, emotional, and inspiring.  The action is intense, realistic, and brutal, which matches the story perfectly.  The performances are some of the greatest in cinema history, i cannot believe Mel didnt get the best actor oscar, they need to give him one for this movie.  He did get one for directing though which i couldnt agree with more, he is one of the best directors out there.  This is definetly a 10 out of a 10, how could anyone think otherwise.
1573226521|5.0|Ok, I first saw the movie, &quot;The Beach&quot; because I am a big fan of Leonardo DiCaprio, when I saw it I loved it,I really thought it was a good story. So I rushed to the library I rented this book. I read it in the course of 5 days and loved the book as much as I loved the movie. They both revolve around a man named Richard, who's looking for something new, different, in Thailand. After meeting a strange Scottish man, that night when he stays at a hotel, the man tells him of a secret beach, and then next day Richard finds that the mystery man has slit his rists, and left the map on Richard's door. Richard tells the Thailand police and they give him the name: Mr. Daffy Duck because his identity is unknown and also went with Richard's obessession with Vietnam movies. Anyway Richard sets off with a French couple to find this beach, and when they do it isn't what they expected, it's a living community. So they learn how to live in the beach, and everything goes well but Richard keeps being visted by Daffy and soon things become different. If you're looking for a new, exciting, adventourous novel. The Beach is defenitely for you. - Jess
B00005JN2F|2.0|As a huge fan of the first film, The Bourne Identity, I was really looking forward to seeing the sequel.  The previews looked promising and I was pretty psyched up.  It ended up being somewhat of a disappointment - it definitely wasn't a sequel that surpassed the original as in the case of Spider-man 2.<br /><br />The basic storyline takes place 2 years after the first film ended.  Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) and his girlfriend Marie (Franka Potente) are living in India.  He's still got much of his amnesia, but he's slowly remembering things he did.  He sees an assassin (Karl Urban) and they make a run for it.  Bourne gets mad that Treadstone has come after him (at least, he believes it's Treadstone) and in turn goes after them.<br /><br />The biggest complaint I have is the annoying camerawork.  For some reason the director felt the need to use hand-held cameras and jiggle them around... A LOT.  Several times during the film I had to look away from the screen and thank goodness I had tylenol with me for the headache!  Used sparingly in some action shots, the jiggling camera might have been good.  This director used it practically the entire film.  Throughout most of the action scenes, you can't even tell what's going on!<br /><br />Most of the acting was good and the storyline was 'ok.'  Most of the plot twists were predictable and there were plenty of old faces from the original film.  Overall, I was very much disappointed in the film.  I think with a better director the film would have exceeded my expectations.. unfortunately I left the movie theater with a huge headache and nausea.  Two stars.  Storyline and plot gets four, but the jiggling camera made it almost unbearable to watch.

B00011RPB0|5.0|If you are a fan of big explosions, lots of silly one-liners, and lots of forced romance, then this film is not for you. This film is extremely different from most movies made nowadays; its plot isn't its main driving force, rather the dialogue is why we choose to see it. Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansenn both do wonderful jobs in their roles of two lonely Americans in the world's most congested city. <br /> Murray plays Bob Harris, a washed up movie star who has been reduced to endorsing whiskey and appearing on crappy talk shows. His latest job has broght him to Tokyo to film a commercial. His marriage is in trouble, and his kids have &quot;gotten used to their father being away&quot;. Meanwhile, Charlotte (Scarlett Johansenn) is a young woman with a workaholic husband (Giovani Ribisi) and an affinity for walking around her hotel room without pants on. She recently graduated college with a degree in philosophy, and she has no idea of what to do with her life. John, her husband, is a photographer who has a bunch of jobs going on in Tokyo. Charlotte came with him to spend time with him, but he is so busy that he only talks to her when he is getting new equipment. It doesn't help that an old friend of his (Anna Farris) is in town, as she draws attention away from Charlotte. Anyway, Bob and Charlotte soon meet, and a friendship develops. They simultaneously have a physical attraction to each other, as well as a sort of father/daughter relationship going on. They go around Tokyo together having little adventures, and at the end of the night they each return to their seperate rooms. <br /> There is also a comedic element to the film. In a sense, its Seinfeld-esque because most of the humor is stuff that one usually doesn't think about, although it is not laugh-out-loud humor. It will make you chuckle when you see these two Americans trying to blend into their surroundings. For instance, all of the hotel clothes seem to small for Bob, Charlotte goes places she doesn't understand because they are popular with the Japanese residents, and the talk show host, who is apparantly the Johnny Carson of Japan, who invites Bob onto his show is very creepy/flamboyant/annoying. <br /> This is not a film for action lovers. There are not many twists or plot points. The point of the movie is the dialogue and the situations. However, thanks to Murray's and Johansenn's fine acting as well as the excellent directing of Sofia Coppola, this movie really works.
B00020X88O|4.0|Bad can't describe this cult classic, and that's a good thing. Everything that could go wrong in a film goes wrong here, and it does it with a flare that has not been seen since in a movie. Well worth the buy  if you want to make fun of the film . Not even real club dancers are this fun to be around with.  <br /> <br />This movie screams for the Mystery Science Theater 3000 treatment and i hope one day, it gets it. <br />
B00005RRG9|5.0|I'm not even a Disney fan but I love this movie. The script is intelligent and witty and the actors are all wonderful, including the supporting cast. I first watched this film as a child; I am now 40 and still haven't tired of the film. It doesn't feel dated at all.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|I was surprised by the comments of one of the reviewers calling Linkin Park &quot;old school metal&quot; and &quot; gods of metal&quot;. It was hillarious!!!! Obviously that person has never listen TRUE METAL such as this Van Halen's masterpiece. <br /> VAN HALEN was on MTV much before Avril Lavigne was born. In fact, Van Halen was a pioneer on MTV. But who cares? MTV seems to have turned its back to real music since the mid 90's. <br /> For your knowledge, Eddie Van Halen plays masterfully in this album and David Lee Roth's vocals are unmatched, even by other VH albums. So stop making a fool out of yourself and BUY this unique old school metal right now. You won't regret it!

B0002KVUKM|5.0|Two of my favorite screen talents, Hugh Jackman (The &quot;X-Men&quot; films) and Kate Beckinsale (&quot;Underworld&quot;) team up in the thrilling box-office extravaganza, &quot;Van Helsing&quot;! I saw the movie about a couple of days after it was released, and to me, the film was nothing short of extraordinary! Like portraying Wolverine in the &quot;X-Men&quot; films, Hugh Jackman brings a sheer intensity into the role of Van Helsing. Surely, Jackman's best since &quot;Swordfish&quot; and &quot;X-Men 1 and 2&quot;! Kate Beckinsale's performance, however, was dynamic and brilliant! Basically, her flawless performance in this film, which is her best performance since &quot;Underworld&quot;, shows us once again why she is Kate Beckinsale! The direction of Stephen Sommers (&quot;The Mummy&quot;, &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot;) was intense and utterly magnificent! <br />  <br /> &quot;Van Helsing&quot; takes place in 1887 and focuses on famed monster hunter Gabriel Van Helsing (Jackman). After hunting down Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde in the streets of London, Van Helsing is assigned to travel to Transylvania, a mysterious region that is overrun with dangerous creatures like werewolves and vampires. Joining Van Helsing is his bumbling assistant, Carl (David Wenham, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; films). Once there, Van Helsing must fight the tyrannical ruler, Count Dracula (Richard Roxburgh, &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot;), his blood-sucking brides (Elena Anaya, Josie Maran, Silvia Colloca), and the Wolf Man (Will Kemp). During the mission, Van Helsing meets Anna Valerious (Beckinsale), a woman whose royal family is suffering under an age-old curse that can only be broken when the infamous count is put to death. Van Helsing also forms an alliance with Frankenstein's monster (Shuler Hensley) to prevent Dracula from hatching his bat-winged progeny, thus wreaking havoc all over the world! <br />  <br /> With &quot;Van Helsing&quot; having so much good-humored action, suspense at every twist and turn, a great cast, and mesmerizing special effects, you're guaranteed to be both thrilled and exhausted by the time the 10-minute end credits roll at the film's end! The film is loud, obnoxious, and filled with revisionist horror folklore (especially with the fact that Universal is paying homage to the classic horror monsters, including Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster, and The Wolf Man). Nevertheless, this colossal monster mash (including Mr. Hyde, just for kicks) will never, ever bore you. All I have to say is bring on &quot;Van Helsing 2&quot;! In conclusion, if you are a avid horror fan, or just a big Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale fan, like I am, then look no further than &quot;Van Helsing&quot;! A DVD must-have when released!
B00005NNMJ|5.0|Before you play this album make sure you've got the volume way up high. The opening riff will sweep you to a higher level. <br /> <br />This album had everything going against it. The follow up to Restless & Wild, the seemingly worst cover artwork imaginable for a heavy metal album, subject matter to make some cliched people reject it outright and to top it all off a song title (London Leatherboys) that, coupled with the cover image would make any metal record exec marketer of the time want to jump off a high building. <br /> <br />But surprise, surprise it's now considered a metal classic. That is Accept. No compromise. Yes, at it's release it probably cost them some new fans but those that were already on board knew where the band were coming from. <br /> <br />'Turn Me On' has a guitar solo on it that is often overlooked but is probably as good as you will ever get with regards to a solo fitting into the overall style of a song. Tie that in with it's tremendous opening riff and you have a snapshot of what Accept is all about. Near on perfection.
B00012QM8G|3.0|The Spielberg hype machine was in full tilt when I saw this movie. I can't tell you how disappointed I was by this film. It seems to borrow from &quot;Night of the Generals&quot; and has none of the Holocaust reality of &quot;Shoah&quot; that was later projected in a truly great World War II film, &quot;The Pianist&quot;.<br /><br /> I think my personal disappointment about this and other Steven Spielberg dramas is shared by my opinion of Tom Hanks dramas. I simply don't think these directors have what it takes to be great dramatic directors -- a large slice of terror, pessimism or negativity in their personalities. I think they are too sunny and that sunshine cannot be hidden, even in topics like the Holocaust. For me, &quot;Schindler's List&quot; is not a great film and does not compare to the great World War II films. I think it compares to &quot;Night of the Generals&quot;.
B00005JN2F|2.0|Storywise, it's good. Lacking from the first one, but it kept me moderately entertained. The fight sequences look better in the sense that they don't appear sped up as they did in the first, but the EXTREMELY QUICK EDITING and TERRIBLE SHAKY, FAST MOVING CINEMATOGRAPHY don't let us see most of what's going on. It's pretty much all done through sound effects. You can hear what's happening...crashes, punches, etc...but rarely can you actually see the action taking place. It's all one big blur of shifty, shaky shots and segements of action. Both of these factors throughout the entire film are absolutely HORRENDOUS. A couple people in front of me actually had their heads to their knees, sick from the constant and unnecessary movement onscreen. I want to actually see what's happening. It literally would cut every second in a large percentage of action sequences. I want to see the beauty of shots, I want to witness what's actually happening, not to have the actual quality of it be disguised with some crafty business to make us more is going on than there actually is. The camera moves intensely, so the scene must be intense. Intensely dissafrigginpointing. I'm so steamed over this trend that Hollywood's adopted, I'm probably not making a great deal of sense. I never have been great at explaining things. The truth is you'll see the movie anyways, and then you'll know what I'm talking about. I would have given this movie...3 and a half stars, but this ruined the film for me. I'm being nice with 2. Maybe the first was like this too, I remember it to a degree, but NOTHING like this.
B0000C1733|3.0|So much for a Greatest Hits compilation. Who compiled it, Anthony? For one, that person in question DEFINTELY has no idea on the opening track of an album: even if it is Under The Bridge. If I made an RHCP compilation, I'd see to it that the record opens with Aeroplane, period. Blows me to see that Aeroplane was dropped from this record, wow! Two, he/she doesn't know how to END an album. My compilation would have Road Trippin' as the closing song.  <br />Given the two glitches -- Aeroplane isn't included on this CD, so there's no point talking about justifying it's inclusion -- this record does include a few tracks that happen to be personal favourites: including Soul to Squeeze and My Friends. There are so many so-called RHCP-HEADS out there trashing One Hot Minute: a word of advice, take a breath, and cover Walkabout. That should say enough of the merits/demerits of that album in question. I don't know why Universally Speaking is included: I would have definitely gone for a Dosed or The Zephyr Song or Tear, and even Around the World.  <br />The first listen was rather disappointing. Come ON, it's RHCP! Put the FUNK into it! I yearned for tracks like Get on Top, man. Okay, okay: I'd settle for Can't Stop, but even that tune was dropped. WHY, may I ask?

What's my age again? --- 10/10 usually on cd's i end up hating the radio hits and loving everything else.. but it seems to me on this one i adore all the radio hits! this song is hilarious... i can totally relate <br /> <br />6.

B00007LTIC|5.0|This is a great album! I had bought the record at tunes for $1 along with every Yes album up to Drama but I lways overlooked this album. I finally listened to it for the first time a few weeks ago and I was like wow, maybe there is hope for Yes after relayer. So I listened to all the other ones and they were kind of half-assed but this album is an exception! Yes did a great job on this album! I'm seeing Yes next month so hopefully they are not playing Magnification crap and this stuff and their old stuff.

B00005JN2F|5.0|I have to admit before watching the Bourne Supremacy I was expecting a cheesy sequel that was put out to make some profit off of the first hit, but I had to see it anyways.  This movie captivated me, kept me excited and entertained...constantly on the edge of my seat literally.  Great car chase scense, fight scenes, and the in your face attitude to the CIA for training something they can't control...The only negative thing about this movie which really disappointed me was the editing and the way the film was actually captured.  Man on Fire was unbearable to watch and I felt some of the same frustration with the Bourne Supremacy.  The fight scenes and car chase scenes which were famous in the first were hardly viewable in the second.  They were very hard to track and see who is hitting who, or where the car is going.  For some reason the movie industry either thinks that the movie audience likes this type of editing or that they don't have to work as hard on their synchronization with these types of shots.  I still gave the film 5 stars because I didn't just like the movie but I Loved it, if it were possible to give it a 4.5 I would but in this case I'm going to round up.
B00008GKEG|5.0|Although I bought this box set only a week or two after I decided that I was a Beatles fan, I am so glad that it was my first in-depth look at the Beatles. It took me less than a week to watch because I was glued to the television, watching eleven hours of footage. There were concerts, interviews with the three remaining Beatles at the time, music videos, clips from their wonderful movies, and oh so much more. Anyone that is a Beatles fan AT ALL would LOVE this set!!! If you are considering buying it, stop considering! Buy it right away! The book and accompanying cds are also done with the utmost in quality and detail, and I have loved them these few months that I have been begun my Beatlemania!
B000286S8S|4.0|I hate when record companies do this, put out a ton of best of to milk the old material. Now this has a better song selection than best of volume one had. It does not have the two new good DLR songs on that cd. Good for a new or casual fan. I heard the new songs at a recent VH concert. Why didn't they just put out a whole new cd of new material?    As far as the band, there is only one Van Halen and that is with David Lee Roth. From 1978 to 1984 there was no greater rock band. In fact the two songs with Roth released on Vol.1 were great too. The song was right, can't get this stuff no more. No knock against Hagar. Probably a better all around   vocalist than Roth. Had a great solo career along with Montrose and served an ok replacement in VH, but I look at that as being a totally different band. End of argument, only one Van Halen.    Also, someone made reference to releasing the '83 US festival? Well I have a copy of it on VHS. The performance was awful because the boys were too drunk.
B000059MEK|5.0|I am not much of a house or techno fan, mostly because both genres tend to be repeatitive and cliche, but i first heard of Daft Punk with &quot;Homework&quot; and &quot;Around the World,&quot; and I always thought their music was funky and entertaining. When the singles from Discovery came along though, I immediately noticed how much their music had evolved. I initially downloaded several tracks and loved them all, but until several months ago, I never heard the album in its entirity. I decided to buy Discovery and was amazed by it. First off the version of &quot;Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger&quot; I had downloaded a few years ago didn't contain the vocal jam, which is one of the most amazing vocal moments I've ever heard. Every track on the album is amazingly creative. Most techno music doesn't contain complex patterns or extreme changes, but every song on Discovery does. I love the album even more after watching &quot;Interstella 5555,&quot; the film that accompanies the album. I recommend this album to any avid music fan, not only those who enjoy electronic music. This is one of the best albums I have ever heard, and you all should hear it as well.
0451196716|3.0|This was an interesting story, but really not one of King's best. (I'd vote for &quot;Insomnia&quot; there.) There were two flaws, I felt. One was that I would have liked to have been given a bit more information, hints at least, about the nature of the society that would create such a contest, especially in the first fifty or so pages. The second flaw may bloom from the first; I simply could not achieve &quot;suspension of disbelief&quot;, because I simply couldn't imagine that many kids volunteering for something with a 99% chance of certain death, and a 100% chance of extreme pain, suffering, humiliation, and horror.
B000002UA0|2.0|I never liked the psychedelic stuff very much, and this one is not an exception. Too overrated. 'Masterpiece', 'masterwork', whatever? 'Syd is a genius' ? I won't call this a work of a genius.  <br />MUSIC: not that weak, but much worse if I compare this one to those trademark works of Pink Floyd which are meant to be their trademarks.  <br />There's better parts in the music, but they've got annoying psychedelic sound. That's a pity.  <br />LYRICS: good, but when I say I listen to music, that means that I listen to music. I don't care very much to the lyrics. Psychedelic, crappy. Abstract does not mean quality.  <br />VOCALS: Gilmour's voice sounds much better. Mr. Barrett is not a competent vocalist. That's doubtless.  <br /> <br />Honestly, I never liked this album. You would better check out their musically more significant work. That's the reason why they're here now.
B00005JN2F|3.0|Let me tell you right off that the sequel doesn't not even come close to the original. The original was a sleeper hit, and this one was just a sleeper. I saw the film on July 24, the opening weekend with a packed audience, and there was NO repsonse from the audience what-so-ever, unlike Spiderman 2. This is an action film, or supposed to be an action film with awe inducing stunts and creative storylines. Although the story line wasn't bad, the action sequences were lagging in creativity.<br /><br />  One MAJOR criticism about Supremacy is the shaky camera effect, that is less than effective...it's nausiating. During the fight and chase scenes you are sea sick and confused at who's hitting who and who's in which car, it's a mess.<br /><br />  The acting is a MAJOR PLUS in this film though. Although Damon's acting was better in the first (he had more at stake in the first) Joan Allen, Julia Stiles and Brian Cox do a fine job in the sequal(Chris Cooper was great in the first one too).<br /><br />  Jason Bourne in this film wasn't able to show his inner struggle and confusion that we all enjoyed in the first. Supremacy felt like things were rushed and Damon was the action hilight while Allen, Cox and Stiles did the major acting. (Although Damon has a wonderful, but brief acting scene at the end of the film.<br /><br />  All in all Supremacy doesn't top Identity, but it doesn't fall completely flat. Let me tell you that the trailer is far better than the film itself.
B000244EMO|4.0|Even after 17 years, I still enjoy this hybrid film which combines the best features of action adventure with special effects which create what is generally referred to as &quot;science fiction.&quot; Here's the basic situation: Major Alan (&quot;Dutch&quot;) Schaefer (Schwarzenegger) and his personal team of highly trained and highly skilled special operatives are enlisted by the CIA to go into an unnamed Latin American country to rescue others who had previously been assigned there on a special mission to....<br /><br /> Once the local guerillas have been summarily terminated, the assignment's original objective becomes irrelevant when all of Dutch's team are then systematically eliminated by a Super Creature (Kevin Peter Hall) whom they are powerless to resist. When the highly improbable climax occurs, only Dutch survives. The plot really makes no sense. It is merely a contrivance to support truly outstanding special effects. Somehow, Schwarzenegger and others in the cast (Carl Weathers, Bill Duke, and Jesse Ventura) sustain appropriate gravitas. Credit director John McTiernan and his crew with creating a highly entertaining cinematic experience.
B0001XPY1G|5.0|It was a long wait but its all worth the torture...i can now enjoy myself with this superb collection.Admitedly,iam one of the Jacksons greatest fan...but the fact that all of my favorite hits digitally remastered is now together on 2cds is a dream come through...this is history so grab it before is no more.MY FAVORITE TRACK IS TORTURE,WHY,THE ARRAGEMENT MAKES MY $15,000.00 STEREO SYSTEM SEEMS VERY AFFORDABLE....AMAZING AUDIO PRODUCTION.
B000068OSK|4.0|this is a great debut, these guys rock in a way not heard since early van halen or led zeppelin or early mudhoney or stones. and they even play dylan better than dylan, they truly improve on the song, bringing the story and the music to the forefront. from the 1st tune this album explodes! and they just keep getting better with each record... <br />
B000286S8S|5.0|Come on, people! Why is everyone complaining about this album. It's starting to make me sick. First of all, anyone who complains too much isn't a true Van Halen fan! Period!!! &quot;The Best Of Both Worlds&quot; is a great compilation of work underlining one of the best bands ever from the beginning until now. It has all the classics like &quot;Why Can't This Be Love&quot;, &quot;Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love&quot;, and &quot;Jump&quot;. The new songs are good as well. &quot;It's About Time&quot; is the best of the new material, closely followed by the powerful &quot;Learning To See&quot;. &quot;Up For Breakfast&quot; is less serious and quite goofy, but still a good song. I'm sick of people always dissing on Sammy. Sammy is a great vocalist, and if you can't see that then you definitly have something wrong with you. He's better for the band, too. Easier to work with. I still love David Lee Roth, though. For anyone out there thinking about getting this album, do yourself a favor and get it. Van Halen is simply the best and their legacy will never die.<br /><br /> Long live Van Halen!!!
0375422307|5.0|A remarkable child's-eye view of the Islamic Revolution in Iran from the within. Persepolis successfully uses the medium of comics to disarm the reader and draw him in to provide not just a view from inside the revolution, but a personal view from deep within a family inside the revolution. This makes for a surprisingly intimate and immediate experience of events most Westerners have viewed only vaguely from afar.
B000000Y87|5.0|Hard to add to what's already been written. I've been savoring this CD for 15 years-- I agree with an earlier reviewer who essentially said this was the height of the trio format, although I gotta give Brad Mehldau props, too. <br />  <br /> The thing (besides the playing, of course!) that's always stood out for me is the quality of the recording. Given the date (1961!!), the sound is outstanding-- right down to the crowd noise. It sounds as if it were recorded last week. The sound of LaFaro's playing in particular is exquisite. <br />  <br /> This should be right next to Kind of Blue on everyone's shelf.
B00001U0E1|4.0|Young William Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes), sometime actor and creatively blocked playwright, is struggling to produce a new play. He is convinced that he requires a muse in the form of a beautiful woman to inspire him. Then the lovely noblewoman Viola de Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow) enters his life. She is betrothed to the odious Lord Wessex (Colin Firth) but is passionately in love with the theater. Violating the Elizabethan convention which dictated that women should not appear on stage, she dresses as a boy and auditions for the part of Romeo in the comedy that Will is writing. Viola and Will fall in love and this romance informs the writing of Will's play. Originally intended as a comedy called &quot;Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter,&quot; its mood changes to tragedy as the impossibility of his love affair dawns on Will. The many lines that the two lovers exchange from &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; take on added meaning within the context of the plot.  <br />  <br /> Tom Stoppard and Marc Norman's screenplay takes cheerful liberties with what we know of Shakespeare's time, and the cast is uniformly delightful. <br />
B0001HAISG|4.0|You'd think the cartoony special effects would make the movie seam rather kiddie. Never the less, I decided to watch &quot;Peter Pan&quot; one rainy evening. The thing about famous stories as this one, is that no matter how original they try to make the ending (and everything in between) you still end up guessing almost every scene. So I started to watch, and what caught my eye almost immediately, were the fabulous costumes! A second later, I was dazzled by the sets, especially the kids room. And then I thought: &quot;Ok- this might be going somewhere!&quot;- And it did! The very essence of the story started to take form rather quickly, and the music, I find, was the glue that connected the story, the scenes, costumes, actors and the magic of it all to each other! As for the cartoony effects I mentioned earlier, I stopped caring about those as soon as I realized, that all they did, was make the story even more magical! I think that this is a marvellous kids film, but is suitable for everybody to watch! Believe you me- the sad parts will make you cry, and the sensational ones will make your heart fly straight to Neverland!
B00005JNA2|5.0|The romantics have fought the realists for God-knows-how-many years. Does love triumph above all things or do we, in the immortal words of Ms. Krabappel, &quot;marry out of fear of dying alone?&quot; Well, Before Sunset (the - for some - long-awaited follow-up to Before Sunrise) has arrived, and it's enough to make both camps shut up for a while. Here is a movie so intensely romantic yet so heartbreakingly pragmatic, I went from smiling to sadness and back without missing a beat. And let me get this out of the way before I get really rolling: Before Sunset is better than Sunrise, and it's a flipping masterpiece. <br />  <br /> If you've done your duty as a young cinephile, you've seen 1994's Before Sunrise, in which two strangers, Jessie (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy), spend a spontaneous sumer night in Vienna but part in the morning (hence the title) sans exchanging info. Sunrise was a slight, sweet little indie flick where fledgling philosophers debated love, sex, and life and created an unforgettable memory. Sunset picks up nine years later with Jesse in Paris on a book tour for, ironically, a fictionalized account of his own 'fling.' And, well, duh! - he runs into Celine and they decide to catch up before his impending doom...err, plane flight. <br />  <br /> And yet I make this sound too easy. I expected Sunset to be simply a stylistic continuation of its predecessor (like most sequels), but SUnset is very much a different movie, even if we do listen to two people chatting for the duration. First of all, Sunset reacts to the events of nine years ago, not just continuing them. Jessie and Celine both created a turning point of lost love then, and before our eyes it comes rushing back. The question is not, like the last one, 'will they do it?' - but = how in the hell will they cope with this? Nearly a decade ago, both were in a place where picking up and starting anew was a fiercely real possibility. On the way to 40, it's not so easy, and their dialogue (masterfully devoid of the slightest pretention) radiates that tension. <br />  <br /> And what about Hawke and Delpy? Both look older and skinnier (that how-am-I-different? discussion provides one of the film's many big laughs), but seem wiser and maybe more neurotic as they navigate the gorgeous paths of Paris. It's somewhat hard to imagine Jesse got married and had a kid in those years, but it's probably because we prefer the idea of him with Celine. We're glad to see her single, but i'ts clear that it hints at her deeper quirks. Director Linklater's leisurely paced journey isn't afraid to let us get frustrated with either character, or even disagree, as well (a scene in the backseat of a cab late in the film is so risky and raw it could be labeled as off-putting, but I loved how it landed safely after all). In short, Sunset is a much more deeply felt, living-and-breathing organism than its predecessor.  <br />  <br /> But it doesn't stray too far - the ongoing conversation is still as insightful and funny as Before Sunrise, and they still bring up intriguing notions about the real, philosophical, and sexual worlds. I especially loved an early moment when a secret about their proposed 6-months-later meeting was revealed. Hawke and Delpy project the care, guilt, shame, and nostalgia that such a situation would have and seem to segue to new convos in a blissfully seamless fashion, that the film's dive into Bergman-esque territory near the end (the loveless marriage) feels natural. And we stay with them even then, because by this time we love these characters to the point where it doesn't feel like voyeurism, and that's quite and accomplishment... <br />  <br /> ...Then again, so is the whole movie, right up to it's brilliantly ambiguous finale that had me clapping for the first time in a long time (Do me a favor and bring back the clap when a movie deserves it). <br />  <br /> I simply can't say enough about this movie, or Linklater, or Hawke or Delpy, who co-wrotethe script with him. The great films make us want to follow the characters off the screen and into their lives; Sunset is that rare breed of movie that does that for us, and it makes for a deliriously beautiful 80 minutes. With Before Sunset, Richard Linklater can join the short list of the great directors working today, while Jessie and Celine are sure to linger with you for a long, long time. How can they not, considering the wost thing about this movie is that it has to end? GRADE: A <br />  <br />

B000059PPX|1.0|I'm a Beatles fan, and I also like collecting their solo efforts - this means many of Ringo Starr's films (e.g. Caveman, The Magic Christian etc).    This film was horrendous. The ever-virgin Ewa Aulin (only 18 at the time of filming) goes from one scence to another molested by a different man each time - all just failing to get the goodies.    It's got a big name cast Charles Aznavour, Marlon Brando, Richard Burton, James Coburn, and John Hustin but that's all I can say positive about this film      Also, I checked out [...] which says it's based on Voltaire's &quot;Candide&quot;, and having read the book I saw nothing in the film that relates to it.
B00005JKC3|1.0|THIS MOVIE SUCKS!IT`S SO CRAZY,STUPID,BULLCRAP,AND ALL THAT KIND OF BAD STUFF!I DON`T RECCOMEND THIS MOVIE FOR ANYONE!IT DOSENT EVEN MAKE ANY SENCE! <br />
B000066NW0|3.0|I gotta admit that I chuckled a bit the first time I heard &quot;Complicated&quot; on the radio and heard the (then) seventeen year old Avril Lavigne utter the line, &quot;Life's like this, you fall and you crawl...&quot; There's something endearingly audacious about such a observation coming from someone that young. OK, that's a little patronizing, I suppose. Actually though, when you think about it, what can be more typical or suitable teen lyric? Adolescence is all about trying to figure out just what exactly life IS like. And every reasonably introspective teen worth his or her salt has these little epiphanies from time to time, and sometimes they're actually right. <br />  <br /> Because in fact, you DO &quot;crawl and...fall, and take what you get.&quot; But you also do more, and I'm willing to bet that Avril and her legions of fans will come to many, many more conclusions about life and love (and maybe even skating) before their days are over. Avril may even come to realize that the guy she writes about in &quot;Complicated&quot; isn't all that complicated after all--at least not in his seemingly inconsistent behavior when he's around friends. Yeah, he acts like a jerk around his friends. It's called being a typical adolescent boy. <br />  <br /> So Avril Lavigne, who sincerely wants to be &quot;anything but ordinary,&quot; is voicing the concerns and heartaches of fairly ordinary teens everywhere. And that's not a bad thing at all. She's clearly operating in a pop tradition that stretches back to at least the 50s and 60s. Her simultaneously cool and petulant image (and material) hearkens back to Lesley Gore in the mid-60s. A little bratty and self-obsessed, but also a little perceptive and self-possessed. <br />  <br /> More real than Britney? A poser singing about posers? I'm glad I'm at a point in life when such questions are pretty much irrelevant. But I think that Avril Lavigne (or was it the Matrix?) captures what it's like to be a teenager in the earlyyears of the 21st century. What adolescent...heck, what HUMAN BEING, can't identify with a line like, &quot;Sometimes I get so weird, I even freak myself out...&quot;  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />
B00028HBKM|4.0|PRETTY GOOD,BUT IT ISN`T VERY APPROPREATE FOR CHILDREN TO WATCH.A GREAT FILM THAT TELLS THE STORY OF JESUS!
B00023BLXK|1.0|I loved the original Dirty Dancing, and loved rewatching it this year. Maybe I am just too old now to find anything tantalizing about an adolescent boy trying to be sensual, but it didn't work for me. The dancing was weak, even when extras were in the forefront. It was obvious that the parents of the leads were never the fabulous dancers they were made out to be. The plot borrowed so heavily from the original, that it just makes sense to watch the original instead!
B0000CABBW|5.0|Having spent time in New Zealand and learnt about the Maori culture and traditions I really enjoyed this film. However my family who had never been to NZ or know much about it was lost on some parts. After explanation from me, they could better understand the scenes. BUT do not let that out you off from this film, you do not need to know about the Maori traditions to enjoy it.  <br />Anyone who likes the philosophy that girls can do anything that boys can do will love this film for it's strong female lead by little Keisha Castle Hughes who does an outstanding job, especially when she gives her speech about her grandfather. <br />A touching family film with great performances and haunting music that adds to the beautiful scenery of east coast beaches.
0689835604|5.0|We got this book as a Christmas present for my daughter when she was only four months old. She is one now and loves this book still. It is the first one she brings for us to read. It is so cute, and the pages are really sturdy. It is just adorable!
B00000AFWZ|3.0|Parts of me agreed with some of the one star reviews. And, I admit I'd been hearing about the legendary nuggets collection from rockcrit whispers for years and years. My expectations were over-inflated I'm afraid so my rating might improve with time. <br /> There is a fair amount of bad stuff here, but before I go further let me say that I was pleased to see the Dovers' 'What am I Going to Do' get some mention in the reviews I read or skimmed (all 88 to this date) <br /> That song is a hidden, humble classic, one that'll find its ways into my song mixes a lot. Wistful, beautiful, with that frayed vocal that sounds like a kid talking to his locker. There's great stuff here but I had to pare it by more than fifty percent. <br />  <br /> And I have to defend 'Louie Louie' . I'm on board and sick of Wooly Bully too, but Wooly Bully is no 'Louie Louie'. It's not even worthy of the same punctuation. <br /> Maybe it's just a fluke blessing, but 'Louie Louie' is one of the overplayed hogs out there that still makes me grin with pleasure every time I hear it.  <br /> One other note, the Sonics had two really solid entries, Psycho' <br /> and 'Strychnine'. <br /> No need to say more, I'm no. 89
B000002LK1|5.0|Having kept their ears tuned to dance clubs and the emerging goth rock scene that made &quot;Black Celebration&quot; and &quot;Music For The Masses&quot; such buzz worthy albums, Depeche Mode strode forth with the hit laden dance oriented &quot;Violator.&quot; Presaged by the audience ready &quot;Personal Jesus&quot; and solidly programmed synths on &quot;Policy Of Truth,&quot; &quot;Enjoy The Silence&quot; and &quot;World In My Eyes,&quot; this was DM not only at a compositional peak, but at their most commercially savvy.<br /><br /> The other very interesting thing about this CD is its brevity; only nine songs. It meant that every song had to make an impact, and to that end only &quot;Blue Dress&quot; misses the mark. The band was also keeping to their general &quot;sound,&quot; only the funkier guitar riff in &quot;Personal Jesus&quot; ventures away from the dark synthesizers that most people would identify as Depeche Mode. That four of the nine songs here became synth standards made &quot;Violator&quot; a benchmark gothic album of the late eighties, along with The Cure's &quot;Disintegration&quot; and New Order's &quot;Substance.&quot;
B000002JSJ|5.0|I have read many reviews slamming this album because it did not meet the successes of the previous albums. That is fine for those of you who want to hear the same kind of songs, all of the time. If that is you, stick Houses of the Holy in and hit repeat, maybe IV (2 of the most abused albums of all time). Do understand that Zep never tried to maintain a status quo when recording anything. Given, some folks do not like their interpretation of the music, but many do. Maybe I like finding the rough diamonds, but this is one is in my most played stack of CD's for a few songs;<br /><br />Tea for One- is NOTHING like Since I've Been Loving You. Their only similaries are they are blues...thats it, and Jimmy...and that boy can jam the hell out blues. Tea for one has a bit more reverb and delay, but the way Jimmy and Robert put it on, with Bonzo's steady beat--I can imagine how the guy in the bar on the In through the outdoor album must have felt with this song alone.<br /><br />Hots On For Nowhere- Great driving song. Very electric and spontaneous, pretty catchy and has an odd solo, as if Jimmy was at a loss for music. Different.<br /><br />Royal Orleans- Kewl in its own way, its a regaling of a visit to the French Quarter in New Orleans. I think its Roberts advice how to have a one night stand.<br /><br />Nobodys Fault But Mine- EVERYONE that has ever listened to a Classic Rock station has heard this.....<br /><br />Candy Store Rock- Kinda rockabilly, kinda punk, kinda different.<br /><br />For your Life- has interesting descending scales and kind of a desperate tone brought out by Robert.<br /><br />Achilles Last Stand- Robert loves Celtic history and loved writing little stories about them....this is another one. I think everyone has heard this one too, but if you havent, you should check it out!<br /><br />I think this album is most about telling some of their own stories by the hand of their chief lyricist, and how it has affected them all- see Nobodys Fault But Mine. It is a heartfelt effort and to me more than a beat and a guitar hook. At their seventh album, these guys just wanted to play something from them, and some didnt appreciate it as well as others.<br /><br />If you want the cookie cutter, get something else, but if you want another facet to what made Zeppelin what they really were, check it out.see Nobodys Fault But Mine.

B00008US8R|5.0|I think the best way to describe this cd is artistic. Honestly, how does one mix piano, drums, bass, guitar and more to make so many amazing songs? But I'm supposing most of you reading this are checking out how other people rated Evanescence because you love it. Or you're reading this because you hate Evanescence and you want to laugh at those who do like them. So i'm doing something else...heres a list of all the song you may NOT have heard, and if you are patient, you can easily find these on the internet. Most of these songs are from Origin, a cd they made in 1999, i think. <BR>1.Away from me: (9/10) very difficult to find...the beat is very strange and haunting and I don't even know what is producing the noise....but it fits well.<br />2.Where will you go (10/10) listen closely to these lyrics, they can suit many situations. If you read this as a poem, you would be touched. Add music, and you'll be blown away.<br />3.Forgive me (10/10) Easy to find...again, the lyrics are amazing. But i think of all the songs Amy Lee has done, her vocals are portrayed the best on this song (only possibly outdone by Broken with seether)<br />4.Surrender (9/10) I love the guitar in this song. much more hard rock....theres a lot of harmonic interludes of Amy Lee singing. The lyrics are bit cliche. <br />5.Field of Innocence (10/10) Ok this is the easiest to find. I've found it on 3 song sharers. It takes several listens to understand the lyrics. It focuses mostly on her voice, less on the music, but it makes it very haunting...<br />6.Restless (9/10) Beautiful display of Amy Lee's talents on a piano...<br />7.Eternal (8/10) No vocals, strictly music. The best mix of music ever put together by Evanescence. I wished there had been vocals. Beware, it sounds like it stops, but then a thunder clap hits you, and it can shock the crap out of you.<br />8.Lies (10/10) Amazing display of Amy's voice...especially the beginning. Then the guitar comes in with drums and you have your classic industrial/hard rock/gothic Evanescence song. If this was on Fallen, it would have been a hit single.<br />9.So close (10/10) My fave song oustide of Fallen. The guitar is amazing...its so beautiful....simple plucking of the strings yet it would out-do many other bands out there.<br />10.Give Unto Me (9/10) Fairly slow and relaxed, very piano-based. Her voice is a little hard to hear but its very reflective. No drums or guitar.<br />11.Even in Death (9/10) I love the twisted sounds in the background of this song. You can almost picture someone lying on his/her lover's gravestone crying.....i know it sounds morbid and gothic but its beautiful.<br />12. Zero (live smashing pumpkins cover) My all-time 2 fave bands are the pumpkins and evanescence. Since SP has broken up, and i never did get to see them in concert, i got the next best thing: seeing Evanescence do a cover of their song Zero in concert!!<br />oh and one last thing: if you think she sounds amazing on the CD, make an effort to see them in concert. Currently (its July) they are playing 3 unreleased songs....be ready for a new cd coming out, probably near christmas.
B000286S8S|5.0|This is Van Halen. Take it or leave it. We all know the cd's some of us better than the alphabet, and so anyone who complains about a Greatest Hits package is really complaining about their own moronic self buying the album expecting 13 new songs. Get over it. I LOVE this cd(s), and they haven't left my cd player. The new songs are playing right now, and am I the only one who thinks up For Breakfast is awesome? PLay it loud, roll the windows down, and enjoy. We finally have something new from Van Halen, and I couldn't be happier. Learning to See is simply amazing, and is sure o be the most powerful song on the tour. It's About Time, is stunning in the fact that a band that is so shrouded in secrecy, and out of the spotlight for so long, wrote a song for the fans, and I'm glad to be one. The classic songs are remastered, and although the DLR stuff already has been, it sounds better to me. The Sammy stuff is enjoying some much needed touch-ups, and the inclusion of Hot For Teacher, which I thought really should've been on the first BOV I, is an excellent treat. Buy it if you want to put it in, and just enjoy life. Play it loud, and play it now!
B0000844IT|3.0|Especially considering I fell asleep during the previous film! Falling asleep during that made me totally confused as to whether this was a third Evil Dead film (duh, Bruce Campbell is Ash in all 3!), and considering it had a different name - hey, I'm easily confused. Life isn't easy for me when people throw these things at me.<br /><br /> I'm still differing as to what star to give it. Didn't really like the film at all (watchable, but not re-watchable), so that side of me wants to give it a 2. But then it has Bruce Campbell again, which kinda ups the stakes a bit - especially when he's looking all bruised and battered, you just wanna kiss him ALL better! I'm sucker for guys with cuts and bruises.<br /><br /> The film starts off with a small flashback to Evil Dead II (well, I'm assuming that anyway, since I was asleep), reminding you of what happened, before you get thrown into the thick of things. Ash is armed with a shotgun and a chainsaw arm, which you need to see the previous installment to understand - so this went straight over my head!<br /><br /> I wouldn't say this was a horror film at all, more of a comedy, coming out with some great lines, and some funny moments. Most of the funny moments come from Ash - and the &quot;mini Ash's&quot; had me in fits! The highlight of the whole film is the Mini Ash's - they're hilarious, although he manages to multiply himself by looking in and then smashing a mirror? (I'm probably gonna get picked up on that for being wrong!)<br /><br /> There are some pretty cheesy lines, one of which I was really disappointed actually came out of Ash's mouth. He says to the 'hot chick' &quot;Gimme some sugar baby&quot; - to which I responded with &quot;Gimme a break!&quot; Such a cheesy line. (The kinda line you can imagine a guy practising in front of the mirror on a Friday/Saturday night, and then going out and using it on some poor unsuspecting woman. I know what my response would be if that line was tried on me!) And then he goes on to sleep with Sheila, who goes all gooey and knock-kneed at that line. Considering he was supposed to be transported back in time to what, the 13 or 1400s, they don't seem to realise it just wasn't the done thing back then. The only contraception they had was the word &quot;no&quot;, and she wouldn't have been a virgin on her wedding night (heaven forbid!) after sleeping with dear old Ash. I wasn't keen on that section, cos it wouldn't have been done in the 'good ol' days'.<br /><br /> Apparently there's two different endings to this movie. A good ending, and a very depressing (although predictable) ending. Guess which ending I saw? The depressing one! But it's extremely predictable, especially if you count the drops - and then I still had to double check if I was right with what was gonna happen!<br /><br /> I think after seeing Bubba Ho-Tep (in which Bruce Campbell played an old and overweight Elvis) it was good to see him when he still looked quite good - although Bubba Ho-Tep is a must-see! I'm not sure about the whole Evil Dead movies franchise, they just don't appeal to me, but if you like Jim Carrey, you'll definitely see a lot of him in Bruce Campbell, and plus, he's alright on the eye!hen he goes on to sleep with Sheila, who goes all gooey and knock-kneed at that line.

B000092ZYY|4.0|Let me start off by stating that Radiohead is my favorite band and OK Computer is my favorite ALBUM from them. I use album here in reference to my feelings on it as a whole piece of work. My favorite track... I have no favorite tracks by them, it's always changing :) but I'd like to include that I rarely ever listen to tracks from OK Computer these days. <br />  <br /> Thom Yorke and company have often been quoted saying HTTT was in essence a documentary of their works and styles over the last 4 albums with a hint of hindsight. They were eager to get back to touring, which was their most enjoyable on the Amnesiac tours. Most of these songs were written after the Kid A/Amnesiac sessions (they were recorded in the same session) but not mastered and mixed until they arrived in Los Angeles to record which took about six months. For those who have been hoping for a regression in progression, you will find that &quot;NO&quot; - Radiohead has not &quot;returned to form&quot; and brought back the styles of the Bends and especially OK Computer. Sorry for you diehard Rock fans. I guess you just wished so hard for it and got disappointed at that you just can't stand to listen to the sounds of &quot;disappointment&quot;. You've got to understand that before OK Computer, Radiohead was not that famous, the Bends was in respects to ratings, a failure, and their goals at the time were - while maintaining their ideals and philosophy - to create their best rock album. After all the media attention and sucking up of big time corporate pigs due to OK Computers unexpected success, they realized something - that their style had become too marketable. In came all the melorock wannabes and its hoardes of depressed but loyal fans. They couldn't do something like it again, not because of the fans (although many at the time probably liked it just cause), but because it would stand for everything they became against because of the success. If you don't believe in their idealogy, that's all rubbish to you. If you do believe in it, that's becomes all the more respectable. However you feel about it, there is no point in hoping for a comeback because they've &quot;been there, done that&quot; and at this point not going back. Did you really think that after enjoying success of Amnesiac/Kid A, enjoying playing music live for fans, changing the face of Rock, they were going to come back and show it off? I can't deny I've wanted it before... the perfect melodramatic melodies, the guitar solos and ambient noise, with crashing drums and thom's wailing/whining. But I can't say I don't like the direction they're going. They're a talented group of musicians who have a feel for each other in and out of the studio that no band in HISTORY has ever had. That doesn't mean you should LIKE their music. Music is the medium with which people find their souls in a concrete form. We all have different tastes despite liking some of the same bands. But it definitely means that you should give them a try, and by a try I mean - with you willing - that you listen and listen for what makes this band so great. Put aside how your friends/enemies feel about them; all the narcissistic people who claim Radiohead to be the best band ever - better than your favorite band - that it pisses you off; all the ignorant intelligibles who claim that because Radiohead all graduated from Oxford, they are geniuses and therefore you should LIKE their music. Now that's all silly, but don't take that away from Radiohead. You are listening to melodies and musical arrangements that you in your whole life have probably never listened to, or even got a hint of. The genre the song may take its roots from has never been to your liking. That is what you have to keep in mind when you give them their couple of tries. If you are willing to explore new songscapes check them out. If it still doesn't work out - &quot;Thom sounds like he's whining&quot;, that's understandable you just can't hang with his voice, maybesomeday you won't mind so much - &quot;They just sound TOO weird&quot;, your ear just can't appreciate that sort of music/genre so maybe give it a couple more whirls or give it a couple more years. The point is, if you can't catch it still, you probably don't like it for the same reason you might not like Rap or Country or Hardcore or Trance. If you like Britney Spears and Hilary Duff, you should close this window right away. That doesn't necessarily mean you will never like it though. <br />  <br /> Now for the album's review. For those who are fans of Kid A/Amnesiac, there will most likely be no problem taking a liking to HTTT. As they did with the aforementioned sessions, they use similar methods (electronic and rock in varying amounts) but different and creative arrangements to create their tracks. In this album there is a noticeable presence of the Grand Piano which hasn't been seen much before but which I love. These songs include (in order of my favorite to least) &quot;Sit Down, Stand Up&quot; (Eerie but the buildup and drum finale is unbeatable), &quot;A Punch Up at a Wedding&quot;, &quot;Sail to the Moon&quot; (i wonder what my son will grow up like as well...), &quot;We Suck Young Blood&quot;, and a bit of piano in &quot;Backdrifts&quot;. There are tracks that have a more Rockish form (the most &quot;return to form&quot; they'll ever get) but are not arranged like those in OK Computer or the Bends. These include &quot;Where I End and You Begin&quot; (The synth in the background hits just the right notes, and the lyrics... oh yes), &quot;A Wolf at the Door&quot; (Feel his pain and worry...), &quot;There There&quot;, &quot;Scatterbrain&quot; (Three part instrumental harmonies!), &quot;Myxamatosis&quot;, &quot;Goto Sleep&quot;, and a lonely voice and guitar in &quot;I Will&quot;. There is one song on the album which is wholly electronic and which I really enjoy live with Colin's bass guitar part and that is &quot;The Gloaming&quot;. Highlight tracks from this album are in no particular order - &quot;There There&quot;, &quot;Where I End and You Begin&quot;, &quot;Sit Down&quot;, &quot;Stand Up&quot;, &quot;2 Plus 2 Equals 5&quot;, &quot;A Wolf at the Door&quot;, and &quot;Sail to the Moon&quot;. <br />  <br /> Production and mixing is clean and their playing is top form. For reasons as to why I gave the album a 4 out of 5 star review was that while Radiohead is my favorite band, they create all my favorite tracks, and I listen to them all the time (I went on a three year binge of just Radiohead), the collection of songs are not without disappointments. You can't blame them since they only had 6 months to record and perfect the tracks. Plus it's hard to constantly write innovatively while it's much easier to write rock ballads with melodramtic melodies. Even with Kid A/Amnesiac you could only say that while you couldn't possible enjoy every single track (maybe you can but that's just too out there for me) and I respect their uniqueness, I don't listen to songs like &quot;In Limbo&quot; and in respects to this album, &quot;Suck Young Blood&quot;, on any habitual basis. Hey, they're always pushing the envelope so that's expected and that's why they remain respectable in that aspect for me. Besides, the only songs I listen to these days come mainly from Amnesiac/KidA/HTTT and a dab of The Bends (Fake Plastic and Just transcend). I PERSONALLY can't give it 5 stars because 5 would mean that it's altogether PERFECT and it's not in my opinion. I COULD say that for OK Computer (Yes, Fitter Happier i couldn't listen to on a habitual basis but that's more a poem and I wouldn't count it, plus I love the poem itself: &quot;A Pig, in a Cage, on Antibiotics&quot;). 4.5 stars would be more fitting.
B00005JN2F|4.0|4/5 <br /> <br />Loses a star for being basically the same idea as the first film - the CIA is trying to kill him and he is on the run.  Like the last time, he's willing to fight back. <br /> <br />Kudos for the writers for not making this an overly sentimental film.  The main bad guy in the film is a relentless Russian Secret Service agent, who reminds me of the Serbian sniper from the film Behind Enemy Lines. <br /> <br />They say the adult thriller genre faded away after being peaking in the 70s. Hopefully, more quality thrillers will be made once this film is confirmed in a few days as a bona fide smash. Also, rent the astonishing sleeper film Spartan, if you enjoy the Bourne films. <br /> <br />Worth seeing if you liked the first one. <br /> <br />by Triniman
B0001VTPWM|5.0|If you want the extended edition of Robocop don't buy the Criterion DVD. This edition has all the Criterion features, plus a new documentary.It has both sequels also in the package and costs less than the used Criterion DVD.
0385336810|5.0|This was my first book read from Sophie Kinslella.  I read the majority of the book in 1 day I loved it so much.  The main character does kind of remind me of Bridget Jones and partly the situation in the novel, but the book definately differentiates itself from that of Bridget Jones.  I highly highly recommend reading this book.  I just went out today and bought all her other books i liked it so much!!!
B00008J4P5|4.0|I can't believe I waited so long to get this album, it's at least as good as &quot;White Blood Cells&quot;. I imagine anyone who remotely liked that would this as well. As fresh and original as it sounds, it also feels like it could have been done in 1970, whether it's similar to &quot;The Stooges&quot;, or &quot;The Mama's And Papa's&quot;. The only hits here are &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot; and &quot;The Hardest Button To Button&quot;, both easy to like. However I like others just as much. &quot;Ball And Biscuit&quot; and &quot;Girl, You Have No Faith In Medicine&quot; are great, and &quot;The Air Near My Fingers&quot; is sweet too. Meg sings on &quot;In The Cold, Cold Night&quot; and the cool last track, and sounds just as cute as she looks. Overall it's an excellent album, and the two of them have now earned their &quot;Stripes&quot;.
B000005IU2|5.0|I don't think that Iggy Pop and the rest of the Stooges knew they were going to make rock history. But they did. This is simply put, one of the greatest rock releases ever, along with Led Zeppelin IV and Rolling Stones' Exile On Main Street. It's raw, unpretensious, noisy, loud. It's great. The fact that there is not one filler on this album is great. It starts out with a attention-grabbing opener, Down On The Streets, then just gets louder and louder with Loose and T.V. Eye. Iggy sounds like he's having a lot of fun, while Ron and Scott Asheton and Dave Alexander lay down some of the best garage rock ever. Things calm down a little with the 7-minute Dirt, before we get into the adreanline-pumped 1970. This is 5 minutes of noisy out of control rock with some tenor sax thrown in for avant-garde reasons. Fun House is also a great song, even longer than 1970. Then, there is the out of control freakout of L.A. Blues. There is a 22 minute version of this song that is even more chatoic! A perfect album, get it if you're a rock fan.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Good directing, good writing and excellent performances by the cast.....what more can I say? This has to be the best miniseries I've ever seen in my life. Frankly, I've never been a fan of war dramas, but I'm completely overwhelmed by BOB, because of its realism and complexity. I was really surprised to discover that Damian Lewis (who plays Major Dick Winters) is actually British, because he was so convincing as an American in this drama! Kudos to Ron Livingston (Captain Lewis Nixon), Frank John Hughes (Sgt. Bill Guarnere) and the rest of the cast members of BOB for giving such memorable performances. The special features of the DVD BOX SET are not to be missed ....Ron Livingston's Video Diaries are really amusing, but it's the documentary 'We Stand ALone' featuring interviews with the actual WW2 veterans of Easy Company that one must definitely watch.
B00028HBKM|5.0|I went to see this movie with my fiancee...he was raised Jewish and actually didnt even believe in God..I was a pretty much lapsed christian...celebrated Christmas, bought candy and stuffed bunnies on Easter, I claimed that I &quot;believed&quot; in Jesus...but I didnt change anything about my life because of it...I just went about my life in my own way...Anyway my fiancee and I actually got into a fight on the way to the movie because we were running late and he wanted to stop by a liquor store and get a bottle of rum so we could spike our cokes...we ended up just going to the movie without the rum.  <br />  <br /> I was angry and annoyed with him and I said a short prayer when the movie began, &quot;Lord, please speak to him during this movie..make him know you are real&quot; Thats just what He did! I finally realized during the course of the movie what my Beloved Savior did for me, for my fiancee, for everyone in that theatre, everyone in the world...he took the hit that we deserved. The Lord God Almighty is so very holy, so very rightous, that our sin keeps us separated from him, there is nothing WE can do about that either. Jesus, the only truly sinless and perfect man, the only begotten Son of the Living God had to become our Passover Lamb...the ultimate sacrifice that covers all our sins for all eternity...the very simple and easy thing we can do is acknowledge that! The only thing we need to do (and have to do) is believe that! Our sins are covered in the Blood of the Lamb of God, making us right in the eyes of a God that is SO good, SO holy, SO intolerant of sin that he cant even tolerate it near him. My fiancee and I left the movie and we didnt speak to each other for about 15 minutes...finally I asked him how he felt. He said, &quot;ashamed...humbled&quot; He asked me how I felt and I said, &quot;greatful...so very greatful.&quot; The benefits are amazing, the peace now is a miracle. The God shaped hole in both of our lives has been filled. My fiancee converted to Christianity and he lives for God everyday of his life! I re-embraced my faith and its stronger and more meaninful than it has ever been. The transforming power of the Holy Spirit is in this movie...dont be afraid of it, let it change you for the better! There is no drug, no high, no thrill more fulfilling than to address the needs of your soul. You feed your body food, you breathe the oxygen your body needs, you drink the water that hydrates your body...why do people ignore the spirit? It affects everything else in your body. If your spirit is empty and disconnected from the source of Spiritual Life, how can you be happy and healthy? <br />  <br /> Yes, the movie is gory, disturbing, painful to watch...I cried so much during the movie, and so did my fiancee. Seeing what He did for me. Its beautifully directed, acted and filmed. The violence is there for a reason...because it really happened! The Romans werent exactly known for their warm and fuzzy natures! They were brutal! <br />  <br /> Oh, and on the anti-semetic note...I really didnt see it. What I got was the conservatives of the day, the Pharisees and Sadducees feared the changing power of Jesus. They feared that they'd get squeezed out of a job because with the sacrifice of the Lord, there was no need for a priest to speak with God for us...we could come &quot;boldly before the throne&quot; and speak with him ourselves...because of the Blood of the Lamb of God made us clean in the eyes of God. Just because Jesus didnt come to them in the appearance that they were expecting so they rejected. Something else other anti-semetics dont realize is that if the Jewish authorities of the day didnt insist on the death of Jesus, there would be no grace, no remissions of sins, no salvation. Maybe they should thank the Jews, after all...the God that Christians worship chose the Jews to be his people! <br />  <br /> Thanks to this movie, we are bible believing, church going Christians now...and the Lord God through the Grace of the Lord Jesus Christ saved us from a life of emptyness and despair. He replaced it with love, hope and peace.
B00008S2VG|5.0|In this day and age of pre-programmed hitmachines and over-emotive screamer/singers, this album will be looked back on as a true innovation.  In the midst of syrupy ballads and by-the-numbers pop music, American Life rings like a crystal clear bell.  It also is the first album where it seems Madonna wants to make a statement as an artist; an album where she wants to batton down the hatches and push off into Bowie territory.  Fearless in construction, the songs strike before you can react.  American Life stutters into existance, sounding an uneasy campaign against conformity.  I'm So Stupid growls for attention.  The heart of the album could be missed by the listener when confronted by the spikey songs that surround it.  From Nothing Fails through Intervention and finishing with X-Static Process, you can hear stripped down pop perfection.  Like it or not, you will not bear witness to a song quite like Mother and Father, guaranteed.  Easy Ride winds and sprawls out to polish off another amazing addition to an already accomplished career.  I hope this is only the beginning in a true sonic adventure from the world's premier pop artist.  Love her or loathe her, American Life is an achievement.  Listen with an open ear, head and heart.

B00024I2Z4|4.0|Mulan was Disney's last animated grasp at a musical. Following this movie we have yet to have another Disney theatrical animated feature that features the characters singing songs Broadway-style. Strange considering that Disney were making animated musicals during the years when bursting into song in a film was not considered fashionable and, not long after Mulan was made, the musical came back into cinematic vogue. Still it seems that Disney pride them selves on being out of step with everyone else - even to their detriment. The songs in Mulan are wonderfully fitting and, although the score has nothing to seriously rival Be Our Guest or Circle of Life, numbers like Reflection and I'll Make a Man Out of You deserve a place in Disney's musical Hall of Fame. <br />Mulan is not one of Disney's mordern greatest hits along the lines of The Lion King, The Little Mermaid or Beauty and the Beast. Instead it sits with the likes of Hercules and Hunchback as one of those films that is great but didn't receive much publicity and box-office in comparison. Hopefully this extras-heavy package will rectify this somewhat and help it attain more than being a 'Disney Princess' movie (not being a six year old girl, I find the whole notion of the 'Disney Princess' drive rather cheapening to the characters involved - still it's good marketing). <br />The package seems similar to the treatment that Alice in Wonderland got earlier this year (and that Disney keeps threatening to do with Lilo and Stitch, Pocahontas and Mary Poppins - but still no sign of them) with more scope due to the film's comparitive youth. The never-before-heard song will be interesting although it is doubtful it will appear fully animated and part of the finished film a la Human Again and Morning Report. More likely it will appear accompanied by stills like I'm Odd on the Alice DVD. Mushu the Dragon pops up on some extras but, since he hasn't been involved in the character since the original film, it is doubtful whether Eddie Murphy will be providing vocals. The audio commentary should be extremely interesting (they always are) as should the information supplied on China and it's customs (although they are sure to be child-friendly since they're hosted by an animated dragon!). For the adults and buffs there seems to be plenty of behind-the-scenes stuff although on some Disney DVD releases these are frustratingly short and undetailed - fingers crossed for this one. Digital Dim Sum also sounds very interesting. <br />Since this is a double discer I'm sure we can expect the extra's quality to be similar to that of the Alice release although the heights of The Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, Snow White and the upcoming Aladdin (which this seems to be an appetiser for) would be prefered. Just as long as we aren't fobbed off with one similar to the very disappointing Pinnochio 'Special Edition' released last year.
B00005JN2F|4.0|The Bourne Identity introduced us to the man named Jason Bourne (Matt Damon). The audience and the character had to figure out who he was at the same time. Although pieces came together, he was still unaware of many things about his past due to a case of amnesia. In the Bourne Supremacy, we catch up with Bourne, now living in India.  <br />  <br /> The movie starts with Bourne having a dream sequence of a murder, Berlin, and terrible flashbacks. We learn that he is still companions with his female companion Marie and that they are still trying to figure out his past. Very soon, we see a setup take place in order to put Bourne at the top of the C.I.A.'s &quot;Most Wanted&quot; list. Also, there is a new hitman trying to kill Bourne. After a failed attempt on his life, Bourne tries to find out who is after him, thinking it is the people behind Treadmont. <br />  <br /> This takes us on a wild goose chase, but a clever one at that. Bourne dodges the people that are after him, whether it is by train, tram, car, boat, or on foot. The only person Bourne recognizes is Nikki (Julia Stiles). So, at an instance he kidnaps her to find out more about the whole Berlin situation. She says he never had an assignement in Berlin, but he knows that he has. It is at this point that Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) begins to suspect that Bourne is not the guilty one.  <br />  <br /> From this point, Bourne figures out his instance in Berlin, frames the guilty party, and gets away in a fast speed car chase that is fun to watch. Not to spoil key points of the movie, I will just leave it at that. It would not be fun to see the movie and know every little detail when dealing with this kind of film.  <br />  <br /> The Bourne Supremacy is one of those sequels that works. There are all kinds of little things about the movie that reminds you of the first movie, even though I liked it more because we are trying to figure out the person, rather than a story. Anyways, the Bourne Supremacy is a very good follow up. A very good thrill ride for the middle of the summer blockbuster season. It's a darker journey into the series, but it works at all levels. Even though is may not be as good as the Bourne Identity, the Bourne Supremacy is as entertaining and worth seeing. <br />

B000066NW0|5.0|This is Avril Lavigne's debut album. Everyone should know about her now, cuz shes gotten veeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrry popular over the past 2 years. She was born in a city/town called Napanee in Canada, and lived there on her school years. In the middle of her high school days, she moved to NYC to get a contract to the popular record label Arista (Pink, Usher). So, one of the leaders there, L.A. Reid gave her a contract to be a star. So, a few months later, the 1st single that introduced her to the world was &quot;Complicated&quot;. She didnt do that well at 1st, but somehow, it got in heavy rotation a month later. Yippie! So, thats good news, cuz she got a lot of talent within her. She also plays electric guitar, acoustic guitar, and sometimes the piano. Several instruments, ey? Nice... Oh, before I do the tracklisting like always, ill tell you what I think about some of the songs first.<br /><br /> &quot;Sk8ter Boi&quot; is the 2nd single that made her more famous. She tells a story about a Skater Boy and Skater Girl being together, and ideally in love. Later, Avril calls herself a skater boy (youre a girl, ya know). Thats pretty funny. &quot;Nobodys Fool&quot; is a track where she raps, and I love the way she rhymes. How can anyone not like the way she raps? It shouldve been released as a single, cuz it wouldve made #1. Sheesh. Oh well! At least she sold over 3 million copies with only 4 singles. My personal favorite is &quot;My World&quot;, which also shouldve been a hit. I think its the most poppy song on the album, but I love it alot. OK, im rating the songs now!<br /><br /> 1.

B0000DD7LB|2.0|I actually used to like Britney a lot but lately she has been bothering me. But, anyways this album isn't all that great. The only songs I actually like are &quot;Me Against The Music&quot;, &quot;Toxic&quot;, &quot;Shadow&quot;, and &quot;Everytime.&quot; The rest of the cd isn't that great. I just think that Britney sings too much about sleeping with people and that bothers me a lot. I'd rather listen to people like Hilary Duff, Ashlee Simpson, and Lindsay Lohan who at least sing about good stuff not sleeping with people.
B0001Z53AQ|2.0|Ok ok...sounds like he thinks he has to be the best of the best in that song My Band.  What was he thinkin when makin that song...its all about him and how great he is. Its just another Em CD, and if you like him you should buy the CD!
B00024BHTC|2.0|The production of this is good but the contents lacks anything new.  Some of the tracks sound absolutely awful.  I am surprised this album has so many good reviews.  It does nothing for me.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|I think I tried the books, but they are not my cup of tea. I agree that the movie's main plot is simplistic. However, it is the acting, the relationships, and the subplots that make this movie soar for me. I think Crowe does a great job. There is a good supporting caste. Crowe displays well the inner turmoil over the hard decisions he has to make that affect the life of his crew. The sea is itself a character in the movie. The images of daily life on the sea are compelling as well. The battle scenes are done well. The strategies and subterfuge the opposing captains play on each other are enjoyable. The strategies are simple ones like you would use in Stratego rather than chess, but still fun. The relationship between the doctor and the captain is interesting. The behind-the-scenes options on the DVD are interesting as well. In its genre, the movie holds up well to the classics.
B000035P5E|5.0|Donald Sutherland goes through hell in this DVD, directed by a man who was so talented in his field and who was taken away from us too soon, a man who could make the phone book seem suspenseful, Richard Marquand.  By the way there are some good anecdotes about Marquand in Joe Eztherhas's memoir of screenwriting, HOLLYWOOD ANIMAL.<br /><br />And whatever happened to Kate Nelligan?  So good, so convincing in this film, a few years later she had dropped off the star map for good, although maybe losing out the part in PLENTY to her arch-rival Meryl Streep had something to do with that.<br /><br />In this film, she plays an average, everyday housewife who, due to the twisted mind of the screenwriters, has it within her power to alter the course of D-Day and the entire Sceond World War, even though she is pretty much abandoned with her child on a single, picturesque and storm-tossed island with only her own strength of will to see her through her travails.  And Sutherland is just as good.  (Perhaps his last good part in a film?)
B00003CXV4|3.0|This is a tough movie to rate. I enjoyed it, but I thought it was lacking a few things. First of all, I've never really enjoyed Keanu Reeves at all, but he should stick to action movies, where he seems to do better. As a romantic lead, he is not much and has trouble conveying emotions. Charlize Theron is excellent as usual, but there was something missing from her character, as endearing as she was. The biggest problem is character development. Their characters are literally thrown together. He gives up his life, having lost his job and girlfriend, and decides to live with someone he just met and doesn't even like? There could have been more expressed there in terms of character motivation or plot development. However, the movie did hook me in, and it tugged at my heartstrings. Not the best movie, but worth a look.
B00005JM1F|2.0|If you thought Will Ferrell was funny in this movie, you should immediately pick up THE BEST OF WILL FERRELL from the &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; DVD series.<br /><br /> OLD SCHOOL is not--I repeat NOT--the ANIMAL HOUSE of this generation or the 21st Century.<br /><br /> It just doesn't come together. Despite a few sporadically funny scenes, the story never comes together and the characters are never as developed as the Deltas and Omegas from ANIMAL HOUSE.<br /><br /> I've just read an article about how today's comedy is reaching the high standards of the 70's/80's (BLAZING SADDLES, SNL, SCTV, Monty Python, ANIMAL HOUSE, CADDYSHACK)--but the only problem is that this current crop of comic filmmakers have yet to produce a bonafide classic.<br /><br /> Recycling TV shows (STARSKY & HUTCH) and youth/college formulas are not the way to do it.<br /><br /> But if they choose that route, they should at least make something funny.
078681859X|4.0|One of the most original books in years.I really enjoyed this novel. The characters are fun to read. At times the novel dose drag on but then it gets great again. Highly recomand.Caint wait for the second book in the series. If your a fan of Harry Potter you'll love this book. It's full of magic and suspense like the Harry Potter books.
0553573403|4.0|After Action Review, Game of Thrones<br /><br /> I, like most SF/Fantasy readers, was broken in by the Lord of The Rings Trilogy as a high school student. This is my first real leap into the fantasy world of dungeons, dragons, and wizards, and, well, you'd best tread carefully. A friend of mine recommended it, which I did, and have enjoyed the first three. But, if you wish to follow as I strongly recommend, do so at your peril.<br /><br />Good -3<br /><br /> (1) The characters are electric, deep, and rounded! Tyrion, Arya, Caitlin, and Jon Snow are some of the most interesting characters that I have read in quite some time. He clearly took his time, even on the secondary ones, to do his characters right. I am so used to stereotypical good and bad, evil and light, and winners and losers, that it was a refreshing change to find a novel when made everyone a little grey.<br /><br /> Tyrion reminds me a lot of Colonel Jack O'Neil in SG1 in that he lightens the mood. Like O'Neil, without Tyrion you have absolutely no humor in this world. Such honesty. To me, if it wasn't for the dwarf I wouldn't read a single page more.<br /><br /> (2) This is a complicated read. Despite having a couple of college degrees and I still got so lost that I had to stop about 400 pages in. During this pause I drew up a usable outline of all the families, names, and had to actually study/memorize the map as if it was basic training all over again. Only then could I make a play forward from there. It's very similar to War and Peace in that, if you don't keep extra care of who is who, you miss all the fun. This is, by far, one of the best aspects of this books. If you like chess, crossword puzzles, and politics, all moving about, you'll love this.<br /><br />There are enough plot twists to have completely flapped and shocked, myself, I was stunned by many, if not all, of them. In most books you can see them coming a mile away. With Martin, it's a knife through the kidney by a beautiful woman. While you hold her tenderly in the dark, she slips the cold blade in, along with a warm kiss. Quick, brutal, and without pity. Oh, I like!<br /><br /> (3) The history has got some teeth to it. The Wall of the North, the King before Robert B. took over, and the little tidbits of the past that just get salted in here and there just get the reasoning just right. He takes his time, explains the history in quick, insightful, and interesting short bursts of light that allow you to see more of the horrible room you just walked into. I am just so glad I live in this world and not in theirs. Seriously.<br /><br />Bad - 3<br /><br /> (1) Everybody dies. Dear God, everybody dies. I was warned ahead of time (especially Eddard), but it still came as a hell of a shock to see so many interesting characters get trashed. In truth, even I found Eddard a bit stiff, although a wonderful character with bad and white all throughout his soul, and wasn't all that unpleased to see him get the axe (although I think a lifetime membership to take up the Black would have been terribly arresting plot development.)<br /><br /> My only warning is to not become too attached to anyone without a last name of Lannister in Book one. It's just not safe.<br /><br /> (2) Seriously, I find just about everyone in this story repulsive. That's a strength and a weakness. I'll go 200-300 pages, and feel as through I need to go to the bathroom. You just feel so dirty reading into the lives of these people, these awful, awful people. I can't root for any of them, save maybe Arya, Sansa, Tyrion, and Jon...and I know three (maybe four) of those will get the axe.<br /><br /> (3) Make a point. Make a damn point. Make any damn point. I know he'll go for six novels (Crows for part four and two others after that), and it's hard not to guess a showdown between Jon Snow and Dany is coming in number six (although I'd prefer a matchup of between Jon and Tyrion myself, a complete foreshadowing from the first 100 pages). But to waste another, what, 5000 pages (books 2-6) to get to the point seems like an awful waste of time. Millions in profit, but a waste of time.<br /><br /> Oh, I'll read the books, all of them, but it just seems like RR Martin is overusing his trademark \\"whack a hero\\" a bit too much. By book three, it'll lose it's shock value, trust me. In book one, you'll cry...in book two, you'll moan...by book three, you'll just laugh. You, like most of the characters that you read about, will stop caring. Your skin/heart develops a tough exterior. It is the greatest strength of his book but, like beating a dead horse, it's beginning to lose it's value.<br /><br />Other Notes-<br /><br /> (1) I didn't find the sex/violence to be all that bad, and I wouldn't recommend it to a younger crowd. Then again, I wouldn't NOT recommend it to a younger crowd (age 15 and below, for example.) Movies/Cable/TV don't have anything that any worse that what Martin portrays and it seems to be that Harry Porter gets just as rough by book three or four in Rowland's series.<br /><br /> (2) After Book 1, you know there are three others about to be in print...I can tell you Martin doesn't change. What you see in Book 1, good or for bad, is exactly what you get for the rest of the other two (and probably the one after that).<br /><br /> (3) The Changing of POV. Well, it's not good/bad, so the reader either has to either take it or leave it. Sometimes, it's fasciating. Other times, it's so annoying you just want to skip ahead. That's just his style for this fantasy series, it a new one with some fasciating uses, but, if not used properly, can get old. Much like a blade of a sword.s 2-6) to get to the point seems like an awful waste of time.

B0001LJC2K|5.0|These guys do Radiohead better than Radiohead can. Although the melodies can be repetitive, their harmonies took turns that seemed borrowed from Bach's Well Tempered Klavier. This record is amazing. Unlike Radiohead, this record is not an over-produced, pretentious, self-indulgent romp, let's-mask-our-mediocrity-with-loads-of-effects. This is art. This is moving and satisfying - which is more than I can say for all the new music I've heard (since Silverchair's Diorama). Good work and thank you Muse. You are, without a doubt, the most talented band on the scene.
B00005JLEU|1.0|Don't get me wrong. I'm a huge fan of Anime--I've watched Kiki's Delivery Service and Digimon: The Movie so many times, I can recite several scenes from each.<br /><br /> But believe me: this is crap. The first 15 minutes of the movie were fine, but after that, the director must have been on something; the story was totally robbed of any plot or explanation as to *why* what was happening was happening. Follow me?<br /><br /> There's strong emotion in the movie, no doubt, but that fails to make up for the rest of this film.<br /><br /> I made two major mistakes in watching this: 1) I convinced my two 10-year-old sisters to watch it with me, and 2) we watched it at night.<br /><br /> I for one am perplexed as to how this movie got away with a PG rating simply for &quot;scary moments.&quot; Coming from the mind of a 15 year old who's used to battle and war movies: this thing is SCARY. My sisters and I actually screamed aloud during one scene, and it takes a lot for a movie to make me scream, you know?<br /><br /> So parents, watch it before you let your kiddies see it.<br /><br /> The only part I enjoyed was the end, which I reached only because I was determined that things would look up by then. Needless to say, they didn't. I can only be extremely thankful that we rented the movie instead of buying it.<br /><br /> So if you're looking for a good film with scenes to make you jump, but is less intense than this work, I highly recommend Van Helsing or The Lord of the Rings. I'm sure your kids will have a much less chance of developing a fear of the dark.<br /><br /> Or if you wanna stick with the Anime theme, get Kiki's Delivery Service or Digimon.
B0002234LS|5.0|Johnny Depp stars as Morton Rainey, a troubled writer who has lost his beautiful home and his beautiful wife.  When a dark stranger shows up at his door and accuses him with plagiarism the trouble starts.  SECRET WINDOW is a rollercoaster ride that will keep you riveted to your chair from start to finish.  The photography is marvelous and the script, based on the book SECRET WINDOW, SECRET GARDEN by Steven King, this movie will be one that keeps you coming back.<br /><br />Depp is wonderful in the leading role and shows finesse and diversity in bringing to life Rainey, complete with all of his baggage.  SECRET WINDOW sets Depp apart and makes another case for his being one of the best actors of our time.<br /><br />Forget the tripe about this one being predictable. This one could have gone so many different ways it's scarier than it actually was!
0765310015|4.0|It's always a question for fantasy fans: do I really want to read a first book in yet another long series? Remember when we moaned about when everything was a trilogy--now I'll be happy to take a simple three-book series. Wouldn't it be great if you could tell ahead of time if the trip will be worth it? Well, thanks to the quirks of international publication, you can with the Malazan Book of the Fallen. Gardens, the first book, may be the only book out in the States, but there are four others already released in Canada and I'm happy to report that while there are some hit and miss points, and certainly some flaws, overall the series (a projected ten-book one) is well worth jumping into with Gardens of the Moon. <br /> This is gritty world and war fantasy; you won't find slender glowing elves or small sheltered folk. In tone and character, this one is pretty much a direct descendant of Glen Cook's Black Company series (minor digression--if you haven't read that, you should. By the time you're done there should be a few more Malazan books out there--in paperback no less). To recognize the familiarity is not to do any injustice to Erikson, however, whose world is rich in characters, race, and magic and highly original. <br /> There's no point in recapping plot since a) there's too much of it b) it's way too complex c) it starts in the middle really and you'd have to also explain what precedes it and d) it turns out it isn't the plot you thought it was anyway. Suffice to say that the plot is generally one of the book's and series' strengths and involves among other things sundry wars of empire and rebellion, political infighting, and competition among various Ascendants (god-like beings), Gods, and Ascendant Wannabes At times Erickson seems to layer complexity for complexity's sake and sometimes seems to pull a twist out of his, ummm, out of nowhere just because he can, but it's multi-layered and intriguing throughout. And it isn't handed to you. Expect to have to figure some things out, expect to get some things wrong. And don't expect everything to have answers or resolutions or even explanations. Something to look forward to is that explanations/background are almost always forthcoming, if not here than in future books. I kind of like not having every first reference to something (a race, a form of magic, a place) be introduced with a paragraph or page of clumsy exposition--&quot;Why look, it's a Faruvian Waldorf. How strange to see it in this place when we all thought they were wiped out in the third age when Astor the Mighty corrupted all four-legged creatures and waged a war of attrition with . . . \\" The lack of explanation can be frustrating at times, but it's a stimulating frustration. <br /> Characterization is a bit shallow in the first book, partially because there are so many and the plot so layered that it's tough to commit the time to them to give them the depth they need. And Erikson relies a bit too much on telling us what a character is rather than having the trait reveal itself or develop (the undying loyalty some characters inspire, for instance). But many of the characters deepen as the books add up. Those that survive that is. Another welcome touch is that Erikson isn't shy about killing off characters we've spent some time with. the luxury of ten books and hundreds of characters. He also does a much better job with camaraderie than with romance. Luckily, there's much more of the former than the latter so he plays to his strength. <br /> The world creation is original, detailed, and varied. The geography is spacious, covering events on several continents throughout the series. The time period is literally millennia-based which adds to the richness of events. Since some of the characters are immortal (while others strive to be), past is seldom simply prologue here. These are people with long memories, long grudges, and long-lying plans. The basis of the magical system is revealed bit by bit in its interesting and as far as I know highly unique fashion. Alchemy and rough munitions work side by side with the magic as well. <br /> Flaws can be found, as mentioned, in some of the weak characterization and overly complex plotting. And as the books go on Erikson seems to fall prey to a &quot;create the baddest toughest creature in a fight&quot; who then somehow is taken down by someone even tougher despite his being the &quot;toughest&quot; pattern. A equals B and B equals C but somehow A kicks C's butt. that happens a bit too often. <br /> But in the long view (the very long view--these are not slim books and there are a lot of them), the series is a welcome addition to the fantasy genre and Gardens a strong start. Strong enough that when I finished it I went ahead and ordered all the rest from Amazon Canada rather than wait for them to come out in the States. In fact, I had them shipped courier so I could get them before taking off on vacation. The extra money is testament enough to their enjoyment. The books aren't all equal in quality, but the trend is toward improvement, with the noticeable addition of more and better-written humor in the last two. A strong recommendation for this book and the series as a whole. <br />
0385510438|5.0|I have read ALL of Grisham's works -- even before he was well known. I have never read anything of Grisham that I disliked. As a result, I decided to read THE LAST JUROR while being subjected to rehabilitation therapy for my injured back. I was experiencing a great deal of physical pain but Grisham's novel was able to draw my attention away from my personal problems. It moved my mind from my location at the physical therapy center and had me travel to Ford County, Mississippi. Mind movement is the highest praise I can offer to a piece of fiction.<br /><br /> Grisham's novel came alive for me because his portrayal of Ford County Mississippi is similar to the small southern community where I live. The characters were lifelike and came alive. More importantly, many of them were quite similar to some quirky characters that I see in my everyday life. I think anyone living in a small southern town would enjoy this novel.<br /><br /> Immediately following the publication of THE KING OF TORTS, Grisham was interviewed on National Public Radio. Here, I learned that his wife was encouraging him to move his basic storyline away from the concept of redemption. I was saddened when I heard this because I thought this element was a refreshing characteristic for contemporary novels. When THE LAST JUROR arrived at my door, I immediately wondered if Grisham removed his redemption insight. I see the redemption theme in this novel but not with the great intensity of his past work. At any rate, THE LAST JUROR is worth reading.
1592400876|5.0|I am a stickler, as is Lynne Truss. This book made a three-hour (note the hyphen) flight seem too short, although the passengers on either side of me probably thought I was having some sort of fit as I tried (unsuccessfully) to stifle my laughter. The book contains good advice and clear rules, and it's written very well. <br />  <br /> When Truss quoted Peter Cook and Dudley Moore (twice!), I knew I had found a soulmate. <br />  <br /> This goes on my grammar shelf, next to Woe is I and The Transitive Vampire. (The Elements of Style has a special place of honor.)
B00005JMUA|5.0|Alot of people will say Kill Bill vol.1 is a better movie, but i think volume 2 is a whole better movie then the first. The over the top violence isnt there, but the fight scenes that are apart of volume 2 are spectacular like Elle vs. the bride. The movie was completely unpredictable and the dialouge was fantastic. The acting in this movie surpassed the acting by Vivica fox and lucy lui in the first one a whole lot. Michael Madsen was particulary amazing as Budd. In my opinion Kill bill volume 2 was a masterpiece. 5/5
B00006879E|5.0|Last summer (2003) was all about Maroon 5. When I finally got their CD, I listened to it all, and only liked the first two songs: Harder to Breathe, and This Love. I refused to listen to any of the other songs. In fact, the only time you'd find this disc in my CD player was when I was itching to hear one of those songs. <br /> <br />Recently, however, I've veered away from those two popular songs and have actually listened to the entire CD more than once. I can't say that I adore every single song on the disc, but I can say that I liked it a whole lot more than I did when I first got it. Now, you can't get 'Songs About Jane' out of my car stereo. You also can't get me to quiet my singing when I'm driving either! <br /> <br />At first, I totally thought that every song sounded the same on this CD. If I had written a review last year, that is exactly what I would have said. But my opinion has changed so much since then, and I have come to truly appreciate this amazing CD. So remember, give it a chance, and it might grow on you (maybe even to the extent that you too'd give it five stars!).

B0001NBMBC|1.0|If I said Subliminal Verses didn't dissapoint me, I'd be lying. This album is the most contraversial album. A lot of people say its great, while other individuals think it isn't. I think it is a great album, but it's Slipknot we are talking about. <br /> Slipknot doesn't play this kind of music. Slipknot is that hardcore band that all the maggots love. Slipknot are the people that do whatever they want and don't give a damn about what anyone else thinks... Now look at them... <br /> When I went to the store and pulled out the Slipknot album and saw that there wasn't a Explicit Content sticker on it, I knew it wouldn't be the same hardcore Slipknot music they used to play. But... I'm not saying that Slipknot has gone bad or anything, they just aren't what they used to be. <br /> So, for those true maggots out there, don't get this album because I'm sure you'll be disappointed. There is hardly any screaming and cussing. But for just you &quot;metal heads&quot; or rockers go get this album, you'll love it. <br /> The true maggots out there, stay (sic) and hope for Slipknot to be what it used to be. Just hope that their next album (if they will get one) will be Slipknot music... <br />

B000286S8S|4.0|Love this album <br />  <br /> Pros: <br />  <br /> 1: Digital recording is fantastic. The songs sound great!!! <br /> 2: New VH songs!! They do kind of grow on you after awhile. <br /> 3: Love the fact the songs are NOT in order of album releases. <br /> 4: It's Van Halen!!! <br />  <br /> Cons: <br />  <br /> 1: I know the album sucked but VHIII has to have one song in this album. Preferably &quot;Fire in the Hole&quot; <br /> 2: &quot;Finish what you started&quot; is a fadeaway song, and here it just ends. I thought my CD player was broke at first. Just a nitpick, but it did bother me a little. <br /> 3: &quot;Not Enough&quot;? When was this song ever considered a greatest hit song? Not to mention they added &quot;Strung Out&quot; to the beginning. SO is dreadful noise and should not be here. <br /> 4: Should have more from Fair Warning. Preferably &quot;Mean Street&quot; <br /> 5: No need for the live songs here. Should have &quot;Humans Beings&quot;, &quot;Me Wise Magic&quot;, and &quot;Can't get this stuff no more&quot; in their place. <br />  <br /> I know there is a lot more negatives listed than positives, but this is still a fantastic buy!!
B00005JN2F|4.0|The stakes are higher this time--the protagionist's memories are coming back thru several shocking events--a new antagonist along with some old ones are now hunting him and you can expect some very surprising plot twists--you will also see some fresh new action set pieces including a car chase action scene that would bring tears of joy and jealosy to William Friedkin's eyes--also there is more consideration of ethics that there would be in a usual spy/action movie--I believe Ludlum would have been proud! I surprised myself and enjoyed this more than Spidey 2 and my friend who attended thought so too, surprising himself as well! Our only complaint was the camera filming during the action scenes used that shaky-cam/TV cop show/POV filming method, which I despise, but that quibble aside, I will be looking forward to Bourne 3!
038551123X|5.0|In Jeff Lindsay's &quot;Darkly Dreaming Dexter,&quot; the antihero is Dexter Morgan, a lovable serial killer. Dexter suffered through a traumatic childhood event, and it left him with an insatiable desire to kill people. Instead of visiting a psychiatrist or joining a support group, Dexter pursues his hobby and finds interesting ways to satisfy his blood lust. Ironically, Dexter's day job is blood-spatter analyst for the Miami Police Department.<br /><br /> It's hard not to like Dexter. He's good-looking, unfailingly polite, and attentive to his sister, Deb, a cop. Since Dexter has terrific insight into the minds of serial killers, he helps his sister by feeding her his opinions on an investigation into a series of brutal killings and dismemberments of female prostitutes in Miami. Deb hopes that this information will help her crack the case and get a promotion to the Homicide Bureau. As this other serial killer continues on his murderous rampage, it becomes increasingly clear that Dexter's understanding of the case and his empathy with the killer is too thorough. He begins to suspect that there is a strong and frightening connection between him and the murderer.<br /><br /> Dexter is a fascinating and original character, a serial killer with a self-deprecating sense of humor and no illusions about himself. He knows that he is not like everyone else, and he tries to make the best of it. In several hilarious scenes, women hit on Dexter, and he is so devoid of real emotion and human understanding, that he has no idea how to respond.<br /><br /> Lindsay covers some old territory, too, in which he explores departmental politics and bureaucratic ineptitude in the police department. The dialogue is clever and witty and the story is fast-paced, albeit completely unrealistic, but the book succeeds mostly because Dexter is so entertaining. Is it tasteful to feature a hero who kills regularly because his inner demons compel him to do so? Probably not, but &quot;Darkly Dreaming Dexter&quot; is funny, deliciously creepy, and a real page-turner.ny, deliciously creepy, and a real page-turner.
B000268QB2|5.0|I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical of the whole Keane mystique when I first read about them. A band with just piano, voice and bass seemed a bit stripped down.      Well, after a listen every song on this album is very good, most are outstanding. The production is first rate.      The finest song is definitely &quot;This is the Last Time&quot;. Probably one of my favorite songs this year. Also strong is the more familiar &quot;Somewhere Only We Know&quot; as well as &quot;Everbody's Changing&quot;, &quot;Can't Stop Now&quot; and &quot;Bedshaped&quot;. I really enjoy the two slower tracks &quot;She Has No Time&quot; and &quot;We Might As Well Be Strangers&quot;.      All in all, a dynamite recording by a talented band.
0312995423|1.0|This book irritated me.  I was sorry I had started it.  It is written in a simplistic way and is soooooooo predictable.  The characters are cliches and I really don't know why the writer bothers with setting his books in Europe as he obviously hasn't much knowledge of the places he writes about or like them very much.  There is no depth to the characters and so the book is very shallow.  It is a quick read because there is not much to the story but even still I didn't find it was worth the effort.  Give it a miss.
B0002858YS|5.0|I bought this CD the third week of July and I like it because every song is unique and different from eachother.  It has a synth sound to it and almost an 80's environment.  It is a sort of rock and roll album.  It mixes a variety of sounds together and there's really no way to describe it, you have to hear it for yourself.
0375707972|5.0|This book was first introduced to me while I was living in Germany by a German high school girl who had to read it for school. Having read the book first in German and then the translation in English years later, I found the English translation to be as stylistically beautiful as it was in German. Perhaps the only problem I had with the translation is that _Der_Vorleser_, which is the German title, really means a person who reads out loud, not just someone who reads. <br /> <br />The secret romance, of a 15 year old boy and a woman in her late thirties starts off as a novel accident. But their relationship deepens as the boy discovers love and the woman discovers a person willing to open the portal of literature to which she has no access; She's illiterate. She mysteriously disappears one day, but the boy doesn't find out what happened until years later while he is a law student witnessing her to be on trial for having been a Nazi camp guard. <br /> <br />The book goes beyond the microcosm of two people, into the psyche of post WWII Germany. The audience to profit most from this book are current German youths whose connection to their Nazi past has been only through their textbooks and their aging grandparents. To appreciate this book, it helps to be familiar with the internal conflict between guilt and disassociation that Germans have with their recent history. And I can see why others, who probably have not probed deep into modern Germany can miss the crucial theme in this book. <br /> <br />To enjoy the beauty of Schlink's style, it has to be read in German. Like any work of literature, something is lost in translation. However, the books stylistic beauty survives in English for the most part. After finishing this book in German, I thought this book was great. After rereading it in English, I understood why it is now being taught as a modern classic in German high schools today.
0765310015|3.0|Gardens of the Moon contains an ambitious and complex storyline that should have made it a first-class work of epic fiction, yet somehow the author falls short in its delivery. While the author manages to propel all of his many plot lines forward, he sacrifices detail and a certain degree of believability that would have really brought this story to life. The characters remain flat throughout the book, lacking both personal histories and believable psyches. Every conflict is resolved either through brute force or seemingly random luck (justified by the intervention of the god of chance Oponn). The magic system comes across as being underdeveloped, and it is utilized in an unimaginative and unexciting way. And finally, and perhaps my biggest complaint, is that every time a main character dies he brings the character back - this is the worst mistake a fantasy author can make because it destroys all of the tension in the story.  <br />  <br /> Despite all of these complaints, the story has a lot of potential. If the author could add some flesh to his nebulous world; If he could exercise a little more subtlety and craft in pushing his story forward; If he could kill off a few primary characters WITHOUT bringing them back to life.... Unfortunately, all of these ifs make me very ambivalent about reading the next book - I just don't know. <br />
B00006878K|5.0|Albert King is my favourite Bluesman in history. This was the LP that made his name. However, it is not his best. He went on to become the most influential Blues player of all time and one of the most influential guitarists of all time. His live sets and early seventies records are produced better, sound better and the tunes are longer (as Blues should be!). This album, like his King Records LP \\"The Big Blues\\" was a compilation of the first singles and early session work King had done when he signed with Stax Records in 1966. Stax felt that it had to capitalise on the renewed interest (especially by young white kids) in Blues music. King's actual first \\"real\\" LP was the Al Jackson, Jr. produced \\"Years Gone By\\" in 1968.<br /><br /> Albert Nelson King had come to Memphis in the mid-1960s with a record deal instigated by Jim Stewart's sister. He was not looking for a Bluesman-Stax was a soul label. THE soul label! Albert had a great name as a live performer in East St. Louis and occaisionally Memphis and Chicago. His set for King and Bobbin Records had sold well, but not great. His first hit had been \\"Don't Throw Your Love On Me Too Strong\\" (Later attempted live by the non-vocalist Mike Bloomfield) and that was in 1961.<br /><br /> Albert signed with Stax and like with gospel queen Aretha Franklin, they didn't know what to do with him! This album is series of singles that had been released from sporadic sessions. It features straight blues, covers, rock and roll, pop and funky soul. Albert showcased his ability to synthesize the blues genre which is what he did!<br /><br /> The title track, which has been covered by so many people (eg, Cream, the worst version! and Robben Ford, great!) Was done in one take (althought there are a few versions-one released in Europe). Albert (who didn't read music) just plugged in and overdubbed his voice and guitar. This was the tune that put funk and soul into blues- it fused rock. soul and funk- which is what the British players had been trying to do- but couldn't- let's face it the real Blues is BLACK AMERCIAN MUSIC- anything else is a copy or a sub-genre like Eminem- is he really hip hop or is he white trash rap!!!! This tune is so important that its initial meaning, as a horoscopic blues in the vein of hippie-dom at the time and \\"The Age of Aquarius\\" stuff of the sixities, is TOTALLY LOST. No one thinks of the Zodiac when they listen to this!! Hence the cover of this CD is totally meaningless to most Blues fans. My old Dad once thought the album was called \\"Friday the 13th\\"!!!!<br /><br /> The first tunes that had been cut at Stax were \\"Laundromat Blues\\" written by Sandy Jones, who also wrote \\"Walking the Back Streets and Crying\\" (for Little Milton, but Albert's version on \\"I Wanna Get Funky\\" is far better). This tune has been done as a test for Albert and was done live in one take!!at his first session-it blew people away! Especially his double stopped bend solo, fantastic! The other tune \\"Overall Junction\\" was done mono and included on the better and later compilation \\"King of the Blues Guitar\\" the LP that started Staxes demise through Atlantic records. This was his blazing instrumental that can't be copied and set the tone of his unique bending style (like Albert Collins type of impossible to recreate playing).<br /><br /> I first heard my favourite cut \\"Crosscut Saw\\" in 1966 in New York during an intermission at the Cafe Au Go Go (my teenage hangout!). This tune came on with the wild bends and suggestive lyrics-unreal!!! I had to have it! It is interesting that this tune was released as single even with a damaged 4-track tape track (the vocal one!), What creative control- would that happen today- when half of recording is done with digital computer virtual tracks- oh my! But this is one of Albert's great songs, one that made his name. In 1990 I saw him at a club in Sydney and shouted out \\"Crosscut Saw\\" between songs and he played it!!! Although it was the Wednesday Night Live at the Filmore version- which had just been released!<br /><br /> \\"Kansas City\\" was a cover and a tune he did a lot in clubs. His opening riffs in this one is some of his best playing on the whole record- what phrasing and tone. The solo gets a bit buried in the mix. Oh, Pretty Woman, one of Albert's most famous tunes was never released as a single, although there are many covers of it and Albert played with Gary Moore on his hit version of it in 1990. \\"Down Don't Bother Me\\" is one of the two shortest tunes Albert ever recorded (the other being \\"If The Washing Don't Get You The Rinsing Will\\" on Years Gone By. It has the same fantastic tone as \\"Laundromat\\".<br /><br /> The Hunter, written by Booker T and the MG's was a later hit for Ike and Tina Tuner (who did heaps of covers). The best version of this tune has only been released in Japan, it was only re-discovered in the 1990s. I also love \\"Finger On the Trigger\\" Albert's answer to this tune on the Funky London CD. This version is the most poppy, hit single type of tune on the LP and is a bit over produced. It wasn't a big hit.<br /><br /> The Very Thought of You and I Almost Lost My Mind are two tune that are usually bagged. However, they showcase Albert's singing ability (how many Bluesmen white or black could do this- imagine Buddy Guy, Muddy Waters or Eric Clapton singing like this!). They were used in his shows to slow things down a bit and have a break from the guitar solos. But speaking of solos- Personal Manager is the signature tune on this LP- Not Born Under! This was the best solo he ever did and most creative for the time on record. Like Eric Clapton's famous solo on John Mayall's \\"Have You Heard\\", which was recorded at about the same time. It is his moment of glory in the world of music. There was a single released of this tune -WITH NO SOLO, but the whole tune was included on the LP (which is long and that's why there are 11 and not 12 tracks- ah, the days of vinyl!!!) This solo can be too much for non-guitar players or only marginal blues lovers! As Jack Black says in the movie \\"School Of Rock\\"- you have to be Hard Core- that applies to Personal Manager.<br /><br /> By contrast \\"As the Year Go Passing By\\" has a sub-dued solo and I have always felt a bit disappointed in this lovely minor key blues classic- however the other version, released on the \\"Hard Bargain\\" CD and the European great value CD \\"Years Gone BY-Plus\\", is much better!<br /><br /> That's the set. That's the classic compilation that changed music history and saved the Blues end in the 1960s from becoming rock, soul or in the early 1970s-country! It kept the blues genre as a Soulful Fragment (as Buddy Miles would say). In this way Albert went on to record tunes such as the Talking Blues \\"Cold Feet\\" which became the grandfather of soulful rap and hip hop of the 1990s. Get this classic CD. There are many versions of it. My favorite is the Gold Disc Version released through Rhino (UDMC 577). But any will do!eased!      \\"Kansas City\\" was a cover and a tune he did a lot in clubs.

0790729725|4.0|People say this movie is great, or &quot;The Best&quot;, but I just thought it was a good movie. IT DOES NOT COMPARE TO THE GODFATHER! In all fairness, what gangster movie could?<BR> <BR>The story in this movie is good(A true story), but it does start to drag a bit later on.<BR>The two things I did not like about the movie were the ending, and the fact that so many of the characters came off as being very dumb. (How did they stay in business so long?)People were getting &quot;whacked&quot; for the stupidest, childish reasons. I think it is because the story was told from my least favourite character's prospective. What was told was only his point of view. I could tell you more about why he is my least favourite character, but that might spoil the movie if you have not seen it.<br />I must be getting old or just too spoiled and moved from the Godfather movies, but I just did not see what was so great about this movie. Don't get me wrong, the movie is surely a &quot;must see&quot; if you like Mob movies, but I don't think it's a &quot;classic&quot;.
B00005JKZV|5.0|In a time in cinema were the great trilogies are no longer being produced this trilogy shines above all the rest not only as a landmark trilogy but three landmark films that change the face of cinema for all time this film is no diffrent no matter it flaws it show us what great cinema should be how to bring style and substance into a genre like fantasy this film is full of action yes but it also has drama and deep emotion and the same deep meaning that is in the books my only sadness is that more films with this quality and dedication to telling a story aren't made anymore yes every once in a while we have a good film but none that just tells us a story and moves us in such a way as these films have I praise Peter Jackson for giving the world these Masterpieces that will stand proud in the presence of great classics like Gone with the Wind and Citzen Kane I just wish other directors would take notice of how true cinematic art should look like.
B00006IU73|4.0|...from the black/death/doom metal I usually listen to. Good for those days when I'm hung over and the last thing I want to hear is a blast beat or a distorted guitar.  I found this cause Opeth are one of my favorite bands and I know Steve Wilson, leader of Porcupine Tree, produced their recent efforts. Since Opeth seem to have a tradition of hiring producers that are very adept at the style they want for a particular album (in this case Damnation) I knew Steve Wilson's project was probably worth checking out. In Absentia has many similarities to Damnation as expected:softer acoustic parts mixed with a little electric, all singing vocals, overall it carries the same trippy homage-to-the-70's kinda vibe too. The only differences I can see are In Absentia is less dark and goes further with the Pink Floyd influnces. If you are a fan of Damnation, or any of the older bands like Yes or Pink Floyd that this was influenced by, you'll probably love this album. Even people like me who don't normally listen to this stuff can enjoy it at certain times. I recommend checking out Dredg and Opeth:Damnation(Steve Wilson sings a bit on it.) in addition to this.
B00023BLXK|2.0|The story line is as many reviews have pointed out not very good. <br />It would of course have been easily forgotten if the dancing <br />had been nice instead.  However...... the casting director  <br />chose to pick non-dancers instead of someone who had some <br />experience in dancing.  The result is obvious, and the dancing <br />is not good.  There are some good dancers as back-drop <br />but you see them for split-seconds, probably so that it doesn't <br />become too obvious how inexperienced the main-characters really  <br />are.  They have a lot of talent and are doing a good job for the <br />short time thay have had to practice dancing, but the movie <br />does not contain a lot of good dancing.     <br /> <br />It is very sad that the creators of the movie would just throw <br />away the money making it, considering that there are a lot of <br />really good dancers that could have made the movie a lot more <br />interesting.  Better luck next time!
0385486804|5.0|Have you ever read a book just once and still remembered it five, six years later?<br /><br />I read this book back in 1999 and every once in awhile I STILL think about this book. It was absolutely riveting, and I read through it like it was water! Very well written!!<br /><br />Excellent read
B00005JN2F|2.0|While this directorial style was somewhat appropriate for Greengrass's previous movie, Sunday Bloody Sunday, it was annoying and disrespectful in a feature length movie that wasn't pretending to be a documentary. <br />  <br /> This movie has the most annoying visual style of all time. Be sure and take your Dramamine because this movie looks like it was shot with a handheld camera on the deck of a rocking boat. To make matters worse, half the shots in the movie are extreme close-ups that are claustrophobic to say the least. And to top off this stylistic mess is the fact very few shots last longer than five seconds. This is MTV directing run amuck. <br />  <br /> What should be the crowing achievement of this movie are the action scenes, but sadly the camera is too jerky, too close to the action and the cuts come so fast that you can't even tell what is happening. I spent about 15 minutes during this movie not even looking at the screen because I wasn't getting anything from the jerky camera work. I was getting more information just listening to the sound. <br />  <br /> I think the director was trying for some kind documentary look and feel. In this case he went overboard, because first of all, this movie isn't a documentary, it is a movie! Second, documentaries got that hand held jerky motion by accident. It wasn't a choice! So this director is emulating something that was a mistake. And as far as the this-is-how-reality-looks crowd, no way. Even if you are running down the street, you don't see things in this jerky style, because we have peripheral vision of almost 180 degrees which smoothes out the bumps. As for close-ups, nobody goes through life looking at peoples faces that close. It isn't natural. <br />  <br /> And the fast cutting isn't only annoying, it is extremely disrespectful to the audience because it doesn't allow them to choose what to look at on the screen. It is like the director clamped a nose-ring into your nose and tied your head to a chain, yanking and pulling, saying: Hey, look at this! True art allows you to contemplate and take things in at your own pace. <br />  <br /> I dare you to find any movie in the AFI top 100 list that sustains this type of style for the entire length of the movie. You won't find any because this is a terrible style for movies. The Bourne Identity was a classic. The Bourne Supremacy is a dud because the director chose an annoying obsessive style that has nothing to do with great filmmaking. <br />
1577311523|5.0|I was going through a serious get to know people KIND OF THING, with the people that has been in my life, for several months now. While reading this book, it made me stop and reflect of those people who were in my life, but was fronting with who they really are. This book really opens the doors to conciousness and it's phonomenal!! MUST READ BOOK.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|The relationships in this film include: a brother(who later remarries. Or marries(not sure which)) most favorably-after being cuckolded by the other brother; a husband who in great sadness loses his wife, but who at the end seems to have chances with the mother of one of his step-sons class mates; a triangle between a wife (sister of the Prime Minister), her husband manager/owner of  a small business, and a conniving secretary-this bittersweet story is not fully resolved in my opinion; love between an assistant and a technical manger in the same business, which fails because the assistant insists on trying to care for her severely paranoid brother; a triangle involving three friends, two male, where the woman marries one of the men failing to recognize that the other man loves her; jolly Collin who has group sex with 4 women after flying to Minneapolis, because he keeps striking out in London; a washed up rock star/drug addict and his paunchy manager who realize they really love one another; the British Prime Minister and an underling in his office (who also takes a pass from the US president), and the stepson and a classmate.  Those are the ones I can recall off hand, and they are all played beautifully.   <br /> <br />But the real attraction of the film to me was the music-Which I can't get out of my head.  The Brittish are often vulgar in speech-Not a film for children. <br />
0784011680|2.0|The great failure of this film is not its acting, that is obvious from the talent assembled. It is not in the props. The props are absolutely perfect in authenticity. What sinks the film is the screenplay, Downey's one-dimentional depiction of Chaplin, and a director too clueless to notice what these were doing to his picture. According to his leading ladies, Chaplin was only depressed and brooding when he was creatively blocked. In Chaplin he is depicted as always depressed. There isn't one montage to show him as the directorial dirvige he was described as being by those who knew him. Instead of directing Downey out of this emotional rut, he plods along through Chaplin's life like a man walking from fencepost to fencepost. Ebert was right, the parts are there for a much better film; too bad no one made it.
B00023B1LC|1.0|If you already own &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; on DVD, I reccomend avoiding this DVD. This is not a true extended version. Worse, a stupid opening scene and barely different alternatve ending are NOT FINISHED QUALITY: raw, poor sound, terrible and distracting! Just terrible! Then, they have to be accessed by selecting an icon while your watching the movie, instead of a seamless extended directors cut that we are led to expect. <br />  <br /> If you don't have this movie on DVD, get it, otherwise, there is absolutely no reason to buy this DVD. This is a real slap in the face to consumers! Must have been a rush job to get something (anything) out in time for the Bourne Supremacy...  <br />  <br />
0451191153|3.0|Rand wrote The Fountainhead to illustrate several points: revealing how morality is based on egoism, showing the importance of architecture, showing how progress comes from the individual and not the group, how evil people subvert the arts, and how her protagonist Roark is the perfect human being.      I enjoyed the book, but not for the reasons she would have wanted. It is a relentless and humorless novel of overt propaganda. Rand is at her best, not with her grand themes, but her smaller nifty insights. I found Roarke to be a flat character who designed buildings about as attractive as Albert Speer. He was a genius in some ways, but also an emotional cripple. Rand keeps telling the reader how wonderful he is, but shows him largely humorless, as a rapist, unable to talk to friends about feelings, someone who is silent and then gives long speeches, and someone who is conflicted. This last point deserves the greatest attention. In all of her writings on this book, Rand states how Roarke is a wonderful character, the best in all of us, who is not conflicted at all. However, what she shows in the book is much different from what she tells. Rand is at her best dealing with supporting characters, never her main ones. With her supporting cast, what she shows and what she tells about them is consistent, but for her main characters, the showing and telling is divergent. I ended up enjoying this book as an example of taking an argument to its extreme, and as the grim story of a conflicted if talented emotional cripple.       Some people really hate Rand, others really love her work. The truth, I suspect, lies in between. Her novels may be masterpieces, but they neither deserve the acclaim or derision they always receive, but instead, deserve some judicious perusal and open-minded discussion.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This is a wonderful movie, gently funny, and full of subtle little touches and terrific acting. It's not the best movie of all time, but very well crafted, and IMHO, deserved its Best Original Screenplay Oscar award for Sofia Coppola.<br /><br />The customer reviews of this movie here are really divided. I liked it a lot, but I can see why some people hate it.<br /><br />Why do people hate it? Well, basically, \\"Lost in Translation\\" has none of the standard beat-you-over-the-head thundering action sequences, no stunning computer graphics, no highly detailed futuristic/fantasy worlds, no hot sex, no violence, no plot twists, no grand themes of good vs. evil, or the end of the world. In fact, there is not much dialogue, and only the faintest wisp of a plot as the movie takes on a format that is more akin to a \\"Frontline\\" documentary or travelogue. The most common complaint thus seems to be \\"Nothing happens in this movie!\\" (That was my teenage daughter's epithet for this movie).<br /><br /> A sense of loneliness and being unstuck in time pervades the mood throughout this movie, probably another real downer for people looking for something uplifting to watch. Although the movie is about a relationship between a man and a woman, this relationship fails to follow the standard Hollywood romantic plotlines - a conventional boy-meets-girl love story or \\"chick flick\\" this DEFINITELY is not (and believe me, I have been dragged to enough of these). As many women seem to have written in saying that they hated this movie as loved it.<br /><br /> And so, none of the basic formulas of the standard modern day Hollywood movie are present.<br /><br /> Why do people like the movie? I think, first and foremost, the two characters of Bob and Charlotte and their situation have to appeal to you. One has to be able to have an understanding and empathy for their sense of loneliness and being unstuck in time, and also be able to share in their mutual joy at finding each other and being able to share in this brief friendship while traveling in a strange land. One also has to be able to understand their mutual respect for each other's boundaries, and not wanting to mess up each other's lives while together for such a brief period of time, in order to be able to appreciate, rather than disdain, the fact that they do not start having sex with each other, like so many conventional movie plotlines.<br /><br />Yes, coming from somebody who's favorite other movie is Conan the Barbarian (read my review!), you might wonder what the common thread is between the two movies. Well, there is none.  Despite being a very direct, goal oriented, and driven person, and despite being a great fan of the usual Hollywood fantasy- sci-fi -action adventure CGI superhero movies, I also have wonderful memories of many friendships with women, none of whom were or became my girlfriends or lovers. And so watching this movie brings on an intense feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu; I can almost see the movie and relate to it with my eyes closed.<br /><br />I would disagree with those who say that this movie was about finding your soulmate. I never got the feeling from this movie that Bob and Charlotte were 100% compatible, that they were engaged in a mind-meld, that they came to understand each other's psyche so well that they fit together like spoons, or that they had this burning desire to abandon their spouses and spend the rest of their lives together. No, this movie was just about two people who, by chance, had an opportunity to step out of the rigid mold of their regular lives and really enjoy each other's company for a brief moment in time. And then, through the same set of circumstances, they are parted again. They are together so briefly that they never get to know each other well enough to find out whether they would have made it as a long term couple. And that is what is so poignant and wistful about the ending of this movie - the sense of wishing for more, the sense of what if. But then again, better to not ruin this beautiful friendship by having sex and trying to live together.<br /><br />I was fascinated by the interaction of Japanese and Americans in this movie; some people thought this was a racist movie, with so much making fun of the Japanese habit of getting r's and l's mixed up when speaking English. Well, there was a lot more subtle cultural stuff going on than just the language problem in this movie. In the context of the whole movie, I did not think that the language problem was overblown - this really is just how most native Japanese mash up English (just like Americans mash up other cultures' languages). Most native Japanese, I think, have enough confidence in the strength of their own culture to not feel embarrassed about this, just like Americans don't feel embarrassed when speaking another language badly. This movie was filmed, after all, in Japan, with a large number of Japanese working in the crew and cast of the movie. The reviewers who thought this movie was racist all seemed to be from outside of Japan (I haven't found one that came from Japan yet, and in fact, Sofia Coppola seems to be rather admired in Japan), and, I think these reviewers mainly have individual  problems with white American cultural hegemony and insensitivity rather than what is actually in this movie.<br /><br /> Bill Murray is terrific in the role of Bob Harris. This is a mature actor in his prime, not the cynical jokester Bill Murray of old. I was a bit surprised by Scarlett Johansson. Her acting is terrific. With all the hype in the news media about Johansson's beauty, Sofia Coppola's natural, unvarnished portrayal of her in this movie was the surprising part. Very little make-up, revealing the small moles on her face, and in some close-up scenes the natural color of the roots of her hair. Some unkind people have written reviews mentioning a fat butt, but this is only if you like anorexic women, I suppose. Johannson is a lot shorter than I had thought, but well along the lines of, shall we say, a classical beauty, like Botticelli's Venus.<br /><br /> The movie ends beautifully. Bob is set to return to America. He really wants to say good-bye to Charlotte, but is thwarted twice, first when she is not in her hotel room when he calls, and then again when Charlotte catches up to him as he is leaving the hotel. By then, Bob is surrounded by his Japanese hosts and you can see how their presence suddenly throws up an unbreachable wall between him and Charlotte. Watch their faces in this scene, you can see the tension, and then the pain in Bob's eyes, and the look of slight hurt and puzzlement, and then finally detachment, in Charlotte's face, as Bob gives Charlotte only the most cursory of cool good-byes while his hosts look on intently.<br /><br /> I'll stop here, since I don't want to completely give away the ending of the movie, or get this review dropped by Amazon.com again. The final scene as Bob finds Charlotte again on his way to the airport is a terrifically poignant ending, full of mystery and an unspoken loss and wistfulness that comes only from the parting of a great friendship between a man and a woman.<br /><br /> In our modern day world, fast-paced, and incredibly mobile and transient, such passing friendships happen altogether more commonly; few of these friendships lead to the sort of romances written into Hollywood movies of today. \\"Lost in Translation\\" is that rare movie which addresses this theme from every day life realistically, faithfully, and poignantly.of what if.

B0001NBMBC|5.0|I seriously don't understand why everyone is saying that Slipknot went mainstream with this album.  Just because a band decides to actually showcase their musical talent they have does not make them mainstream. Just because the singer actually sings on some of these songs does not equal mainstream. Finally, just because a band throws in some rippin guitar solos does not make them mainstream.  This new album is amazing and has something for everyone.  I will agree that it is not the typical Slipknot but that does not mean it's a completely different band.  Do you really want a band to relase the same cd over and over again.  Bands evolve, and in this case I think it just makes them better.  Now not only do they have their hard and heavy songs but they also showcase a few acoustic songs that are really good.  Anyone that says they have gone mainstream needs to sit back and listen to Pulse Of The Maggots. That song rocks and is still probably too heavy for 95% of the population.  The highlights of this cd for me are Vermilioin Pt 1 and Before I Forget.  Both of these songs showcase the bands evolved style yet still rock and pull you in.  Ever since I got this cd a month ago it has rarely left my cd player.  Anyone who plays guitar will appreciate this album.  For those people who dismiss Slipknot as a band without talent you need to listen to this album, and I think most if not all of you will change your mind.  As for all the people whining that slipknot went mainstream.  QUIT WHINING and open your mind, your missing something really good here.
B000002JSN|5.0|If you can understand sheet music and are attempting to master any instrument (from a cello to a tuba) you might want to take a look at the scripts for this album. You'll be devistated! Also, if you are interested in making an album and happen to own a studio, you might find a listen to Physical Graffiti to provide a very instructive statement the limits of how complex mixing and multi-tracking get.         Sure, a few tracks on the ablum: Custard Pie and Trampled Under Foot, are probably the best embodiment of the blues-rock Zep-sound that most people are familiar with, but after those tracks, the album turns into a zen statment on overindulgence. Normally, I might agree that musical overkill is a bad thing, but there's a right time and place for everything; and within the framework of this album, overkill becomes baroque. I argue that only Zep could pull this off.         Beginning with Kashmir, the album lays track upon track until many songs (ie: In the Light, Ten Years Gone) are orchestrated with somtimes 7 or 8 different guitar tracks and 3 or 4 different bass tracks. Bach himself might be proud of such hefty orchestration. Throw in JPJ's keyboards, along with several exotic instruments such as mellotrons and vibrophones, and you've got yourself a saturated hard-rock symphony. Many of the songs, such as Kashmir, In The Light, and Ten Years Gone, are very cerebral, creating a soothing Indian Raga-like effect, while others sustain a hectic Occidental pace (ie: Rover, Night Flight) but are never abrasive to the ear.         I feel that the overall album gets a bum rap sometimes, because many people would prefer to hear the more concise and abbreviated sound associated with the pentatonic riffs of earlier Led-days (ie: Whole Lotta' Love, Heartbreaker). They complain that this album is overindulgent, solos are extended too long, etc.. But they never really explain why this makes the album less worthy than say, the Runes Album. I think that the intent of the album was to push the manifold of hard-rock overindulgence and the result is the raga-like, baroque musical symphony from the '70s that is Physical Grafitti.         I would not hesitate to say that this is the best album from the 70's hard-rock genre; if not the best rock and roll album of all time.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|The previous reviewer Earthlight66 clearly has no clue on what they are talking about. He/she ranted and spewed so much hate on Rage's music that it was difficult to read whether if they were doing a review, or simply showcasing thier ego as if they know everything. Rage was one of the most important and influential rock bands to emerge since the 60's. On 'The Battle of Los Angeles', Rage's infectious guitar riffs and revolutionary drum rhythms demanded everyone's undivided attention towards messages that were necessary and critical. Zach de la Rocha speaks on modern day ills that have infiltrated our society and corrupted the fabric of our intelligence. Considering that the direction of thier message on 'The Battle of Los Angeles' was political, it was an attempt to disconnect society from the matrix of corrupt governments. These are messages that forces us to take the 'red pill' and go deep into the 'rabbit hole' to seek out the truth of what has been exaggerated from falsehoods that have been instilled in all of us since childhood. Yet, there are always those (earthlight 66) who choose to take the 'blue pill' and fight their way from wanting to understand the truth from a point of view that is unorthodox to thier reality. These are the same people who bathe in thier own arrogance, where they assume to know what Tom Morello's intentions were when he recorded with Rage. These are people who actually believe that they can mysteriously read the minds of musicians and think that they are trying to commit some kind of socioligical genocide with thier messages. People like Earthlight66 are so consumed with thier arrogance and ignorance that they refuse to look outside of thier 'box' and beyond thier personal limitations to find alternatives to what they believe to be 'the truth'. My friend, neither Tom nor Zach nor any member of Rage claim to know the answers to the problems that affect our society. They merely are expressing thier 1st amendment right to speak what theybelieve in and what they desire to share and leave open for CONSTRUCTIVE interpretation, and not futile tantrums. So Earthlight 66, the next time you decide to write a 'review', make sure YOU understand what your talking about and please, back up your arguements with FACTS instead of egotistical ranting and complaining. Otherwise, you will end up making yourself sound like a bitter individual who cares about nothing except hearing your own voice.          Otherwise, I HIGHLY recommend that EVERYONE needs to cop The Battle of Los Angeles, as well as ALL of Rage's albums. And to listen closely to the message that is important for all to hear. In the end, YOU are the one to decide whether if thier message is in FACT, true or false, right or wrong. Don't allow the ignorance of the few decide your interpretation of this phenomenal music, for you.
B00005JN2F|4.0|If you have a negative reaction to realistic car crashes, stay away.     If you want to see the romance of the first film, stay away.     If you don't like intentionally shaky and off-frame camera work, with incredibly quick edits, then stay away.     If you want to submerge yourself briefly in an dark, cold and fascinating world, populated by intelligent, but self-righteous and flawed characters, then go see it.     It was a great ride. More violent than I would have preferred, but fit in with context of the story and was more believable than in Bourne Identity. Appreciated that it didn't have any of the smugness of a Bond film. While you can predict the outcome, and general arc of the story, getting to that end took some surprising turns, and some ironic humor.            Walking out of the theater, I found I was left with the same impressions I have after reading Ludum's books. It feels like the same world, even if the story is only loosely pinned to Ludum's creations.
B0001KL5DA|5.0|Like many viewers, I don't get HBO, so I got hooked watching Season 1's episodes all at once, on video. The DVD presentation adds commentaries of mixed quality. Writer Jill Solowey opens by wondering why anyone would spend an hour listening to her talk. &quot;You must not have a life if you're here,&quot; she says. Unnecessarily demeaning to viewers, as commentaries add a whole layer of enjoyment to the viewing experience.<br /><br /> Other commentators pointed out the old-fashioned Addams family quality of the Fishers, which I hadn't noticed -- but now I see they have an avocado-colored refrigerator! And I see the contrast between the timeless, stifling ambience of the funeral home and the free-spirited world that the family encounters outside.<br /><br /> Season 2's writers faced a major challenge because plots need conflict and at least two sources of conflict have disappeared. Nate has now firmly committed to being a funeral director -- he gets his license early in the season -- and he's firmly allied with his brother's interests. And David, now officially out as a gay man, has a choice of nice dates before ending up (as we always suspected) with the charismatic Keith.<br /><br /> The Christmas episode was my favorite, although it was more satisfying than suspenseful. A group of Harley Davidson riders gathers to honor a fallen comrade, while the Fishers remember their last moments with their father. The biker funeral was a treat. I'd like my own funeral to be a big party too, although I hope my heirs have the sense to demand a cheap cremation rather than a ten thousand dollar box.<br /><br /> As other reviewers have noted, Nate takes the lead this season, possibly because his character seems least controversial and most sympathetic. He's grown into a compassionate, caring person, even befriending a young man dying friendless with pancreatic cancer. Pushing the cremation button seems an odd but sincere act of friendship.<br /><br /> At the same time, I found it hard to like either of Nate's girlfriends -- the neurotic Brenda and the needy, vulnerable Lisa. Nate deserves someone he can respect.<br /><br /> And I disagree with those who call this family &quot;dysfunctional&quot; and &quot;repressed.&quot; While the rabbi in Season 2 preaches the importance of total honesty, in fact research shows that marriages often stay together more by what's not said than by openness.<br /><br /> Compared to most families, the Fishers are not bad! Rememer they see each other every day and support one another through tough times. And they do show mutual respect. Ruth may be controlling but she gives her children a lot of space. She even seems a little intimidated by Claire, who was born after the boys were almost grown.<br /><br /> The commentators suggest that the show goes to great lengths for realism. However, in a contemporary police department, Keith would not be on duty while under investigation for killing a citizen. He'd turn over his gun and badge and be off duty with pay. He would also be required -- not advised, required -- to see the police psychologist. These steps probably would have prevented the next tragedy, where Keith lashes out during a domestic violence call.<br /><br /> Seasons 3 to 5 are out, I hear, so we know Nate will recover and go on to more adventures. Other reviewers have suggested issuing Season 3 on DVD as soon as possible. I couldn't agree more!time, I found it hard to like either of Nate's girlfriends -- the neurotic Brenda and the needy, vulnerable Lisa.

B00005JN2F|4.0|Continuing the storyline started in The Bourne Identity, &quot;Supremacy&quot; begins with Jason and his girlfriend hiding out in India. Jason is still having flashbacks from his former life and is still unable to piece together everything that occurred after he was enlisted into the Treadstone Project. You can gather from the setup that Bourne and his girlfriend have been on the move fairly constantly, just in case one of his old pals decides to drop in. Unfortunately, this is exactly what happens. In Germany, a CIA sting goes south, and all evidence points to Bourne as the man behind it. He now has to find a way to clear his name, and unearth the true conspirators, all while avoiding the hundreds of spies, assassins, agents, and police that are all over Europe looking for him<br /><br /> The movie as a whole was excellent. The pace kept you interested, the action was fairly constant, and Damon actually seems to be progressing fairly well as an actor. Bourne also came off as more realistic in this film as they made him less &quot;invincible&quot; than he was in the previous film. It also didn't hurt that there was an excellent supporting cast, including Joan Allen, Brian Cox, and Julia Stiles.<br /><br /> The only drawback was the shaky camera during some of the more intense action sequences. This is supposed to add to the intensity of the action, but really just ends up leaving you with a bit of a headache.<br /><br /> All things said, this is an excellent action film with a fairly engaging storyline and just the right amount of humor to balance things out. Recommended for anyone who enjoys spy thrillers, or action films in general.
B000001IQH|5.0|Before I heard this CD, specifically the song Time Bomb, I wasn't into punk at all.  This CD completely changed my mind on what this music is all about.  I usually listen to Pink Floyd, and a lot of other classic rock. But this is something that you can listen to when you don't feel like listening to a full album; you can just pick a song and go. Makes good driving music also.  Almost made me get a speeding ticket, so watch out.
0694515302|5.0|I have listened to this audiocasset over 20 times.  My 5 year old business has left me wanting to close the doors and walk away. It leaves me with too little free time to enjoy life.  This tape really hits home and makes you think about what a business really is and has opened my eyes.  I have now started taking steps to change my business for good.  Gerber believes your business should be apart from its owner and this makes perfect sense.  I can't believe I haven't seen it before now.  I have been a slave to my business for years and I need to set up a system so the business can run itself.  My concentration should be making the system run smoothly and not the day to day work.   <br /> <br />I can understand how this book doesn't make sense for somebody just starting a business.  All the 'one star' ratings are understandable for those people. However, if your business is running your life and can't seem to figure out how to change it this book is for you.  I love it and wish there was a follow up with more examples of successes.
B00005M91K|4.0|The soundtrack to this is a heavy slice of cheese and a bit distracting, but the images themselves are presented in a manner that manages to be beautiful, moving, and insightful.  There's not a lot of heavy montage, which thankfully helps lighten certain conceits of the filmmakers.<br /><br />For a movie without dialogue, it is surprisingly watchable, and provides a sort of outside point of view for evaluating our own lives, along with healthy doses of humor and pity inducing sorrow.
038551123X|5.0|I can imagine --- well, wait a minute, I can't imagine --- what it must have been like for Jason Kaufman, executive editor at Doubleday, when he sat down and read the manuscript of DARKLY DREAMING DEXTER, the debut novel of Jeff Lindsay. While ostensibly a thriller, it treads boldly and steadily into heretofore uncharted territory, taking an unusual protagonist and turning him into an unlikely hero, a kind of Robin Hood of serial murderers. Whatever he thought, he ultimately decided to publish this darkly comedic work, to the benefit of the reading public. <br /> <br />The Dexter of the title is Dexter Morgan, a blood-splatter analyst for the Miami police. That is his day job, anyway. But by night --- not every night, just when The Need calls him --- Dexter is a serial killer. He isn't culling the herd, however; he's protecting it. Dexter's victims are child molesters and murderers who have escaped justice because they are off of justice's radar. Dexter, in turn, takes them off the board. Dexter likes children --- likes them, nothing more than that --- and though he is asocial, people tend to like him. Except for women. Women love Dexter. He is a magnet for...well, let's just say that women practically throw themselves at Dexter. He's not interested, but it helps him to blend in if he pretends he is. <br /> <br />It's hard not to like Dexter. You won't confuse him with Hannibal Lecter, or with Patricia Highsmith's Ripley, who was so good at killing people when they got in his way. No. Dexter is actually charming, and he is good at both his day and night jobs. A great deal of the reason for this is that Harry, Dexter's foster father, was a policeman. Harry recognized Dexter for who and what he was, and channeled him down the path of righteousness. Dexter, in other words, is on our side. <br /> <br />And once you get to know him, it's easy to understand why he becomes upset when a second serial killer suddenly appears in Miami. The new killer has a theatrical flair that is so similar to Dexter's own that he is at first intrigued, then frightened. The new killer seems to be sending Dexter a message, as if he knows who, and what, Dexter really is. The fact that Deborah Gordon, Dexter's foster sister, is also a Miami cop and is assigned to investigate the new murders only complicates matters. As the murders continue, however, Dexter slowly comes to the disquieting conclusion that he may well know who the killer is --- and his identity may be no further away than Dexter's mirror. <br /> <br />Aficionados of the thriller genre, and particularly the sub-genre dealing with serial murders, will find this well-written debut a refreshing change of pace from the usual pattern such stories take. Lindsay has a deft literary touch and his dark humor infuses DARKLY DREAMING DEXTER from beginning to end. This is a work that will have people reading, and talking, for some time to come. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub <br />

Its a screwed up psychiatric thriller that will leave you utterly perplexed at the end...you can basically interpret the ending however you want... which is actually quite painful and will drive you nuts!<br />There is a clue in the prologue about when Teddy arrives at the island that just doesn't correspond with the doctor's story at the end...UGH!
6300213714|5.0|I will buy this movie on DVD because it is a classic.Maybe it was ahead of its time - certainly, gangs are an increasing threat to society and its suburban dreams and hopes.

It's a fascinating juxtaposition of love and hate.<br /><br /> \\" The Warriors rule;\\" the Orphans are pathetic.<br /><br /> This film explores a code of ethics and conduct which are often pissed upon by today's so-called, civilized society; Wall Steet is an example.

B00005JN2F|5.0|I just saw this on friday, a day after i watched the sleeper hit of a first one. i saw the first one way back when it came out, but needed a refresher, ya know. I really thought this new one was a great movie, although from what i hear nothing like the books, but they said something that in the commentarys on the first movie. Doesn't really matter to me anyway, movies are never the same as the books. When a movie is based on a book its more like the movie was inspired by the book. so whatever man.<br /><br />The movie was great, but you really need to see the first one to know what was going on.<br /><br />Pretty much the only thing i didn't care for in the movie was the shakey cam. there was alot of it, i'm not a big fan of it since in some cases i get motion sickness from not being able to see whats going on. there was alot in this movie.<br /><br />Oh, and the worst part of the movie, beyond bad. The Previews, they were all boring. the only action movie they had in the previews was with the god-awful actor nicolas cage.
0887306101|4.0|Cuando me le el libro por primera vez no me dijo muchas cosas nuevas. Es un libro bastante tcnico con algunos toques fundamentales. Mi opinin cambi bastante al releer algunas entrevistas y me di cuenta de que trata sobre la vida misma. Es una sensacin que ya tuve cuando lea cada entrevista, porque era eso lo que estaba en el aire, pero al repasar algunas lo he visto muchsimo ms claro, y cada una de ellas refleja situaciones que nos son comunes a todos en algn momento de nuestra vida. Despus de hacer una revisin del libro ahora le tengo mucho ms respeto. <br /> <br />La nica entrevista que me hizo volver a releer el libro fue la de James B.

Bien, yo slo estoy empezando, pero esa manera de pensar me llam la atencin, al igual que Paul Tudor Jones, que es ms tcnico, pero que tambin conserva esa manera de analizar los mercados.

B00003CWN3|5.0|This movie was so well cast and well acted. I love this movie because it was so moving and so good. I cried when I saw it. The bad thing about this movie is, after you've finish watching it, it still lingers in your head. Hilary swank very much deserved that oscar. I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves a reaaly good movie. It was sad though, but it was good.
B0001NBMBC|3.0|First off, I'm not going to state that this is my favorite album, and if I had to put it in any particular order, it would be last... BUT that doesn't mean that I didn't like it. I've been a fan from the beginning, and this album isn't going to change it, although it isnt as intense for my particular taste... Sometimes you get a little older, you get a little bit more skilled, and you have a producer that can make things more 'friendly' so to speak, and that's what this album has. I don't care if something goes mainstream ,or radio friendly..and if you liked the band, and are just used to that style they had, you will be a somewhat disappointed with this album. BUT don't hate it on the sheer fact it's a bit more mainstream(those are the fans that just like the NEATO outfits they wear, and have no clue what the lyrics even are, and are the ones that would probably only give this album one star)..those so called fans are just as bad as Nickelback fans that jump on the bandwagon because it's shoved down everyone's throats..different style, same type of attitude...so don't be disappointed if you see a 'normal' person show up at the next concert because they liked this album...this album may even entice people to buy their previous albums(which, as I stated, I like more than this one)..anyway, I like heavier crazy music in general, and this album is OK...you could spend your money on really stupid things(Nickelback anyone?) and as far as getting a little bit 'tasty' on the guitar work..don't hate someone because they've busted their ass for years to actually do something with their talent
B00000JLWW|5.0|this movie has to be one of the best of all times!  Romantic, factual, and yet adventerous.  Everytime i watch this movie, i always wind up bawling no matter how hard i try.  it was like you were really there watching Jack and Rose's every move.  This movie, if you already don't own it, is a MUST for everyone.
0800179501|4.0|This movie has a very easy plot, but you can watch once and again, because it's not like one of those stupid martial arts movies. Ralph Maccio gas a good perform in the movie, the same for Pat Morita, who had the nomination for this movie. And the feature of Elisabeth Shue, she looks very pretty. Buy it and you'll have a good time.
B00005JM0B|2.0|Why on earth would you do that?  Everyone knew that T2 could not be topped.  So why would you want to leave the Teminator legacy like that.  That was like MJ playing for the Wizards after retirement.  What for?  It wasnt worth it. Maybe the money was made but the movie was horrible in contrast to 1 and 2.  You could have at least kept the same actors for characters from the previous movies to this one.
B00023B1LC|3.0|First, I rate the MOVIE Bourne Identity and the older Collector's Edition DVD both as 5-star. I expected the Extended Edition DVD to include all in the older Collector's Edition DVD AND MORE. What you get with the Extended Edition DVD is a FREE TICKET (EXPIRES AUGUST 8th) to MOVIE Bourne Supremacy and a weaker DVD release that is largely a promotion for the new movie. <br />  <br />What you LOSE (Extended Edition DVD versus Collector's Edition DVD):  <br />an extended farmhouse scene; DTS sound; Doug Liman's informative Director's Commentary track. <br />  <br />What you DO NOT GAIN (Extended Edition DVD versus Collector's Edition DVD): <br />the SAME alternate ending IN ROUGH, GRAINY QUALITY as in the deleted scenes of the Collector's Edition; the SAME deleted/extended scenes (except for the ADDED alternate beginning noted below and the OMITTED farmhouse scene noted above); the SAME Extreme Ways music video by Moby and the SAME DVD-ROM access to web site; no featurette whatsoever providing director Doug Liman's comments. (Did Liman tick off producer Frank Marshall or did he want to distance himself from this so-called upgrade by Universal?). <br />  <br />What you DO GAIN (Extended Edition DVD versus Collector's Edition DVD): <br />a FREE TICKET (EXPIRES AUGUST 8th) to Bourne Supremacy movie; pain-in-the-arse indirect PLAY THE MOVIE via a Play SUB-menu to select theatrical vs extended version that STILL forces you to use MANUALLY your DVD player's ANGLE button WHEN THE ALTERNATE ANGLE ICONS APPEAR ON YOUR SCREEN to access the bookended alternate beginning/ending version (both footages in UNFINISHED QUALITY that somewhat compromise the vendetta premise of the Bourne Supremacy); Special Features includes these SAME UNFINISHED alternate beginning and ending in isolation with producer Frank Marshall's mea-culpa that this less-than-explosive footage was a post-production C-Y-A due to 9/11 that test audiences ultimately bounced anyway; some worthwhile featurettes regarding Robert Ludlum, CIA practices from retired CIA operative/film consultant Chase Brandon, and a real psychologist's profile of Jason Bourne; a worthless transition promotion fluff to the Bourne Supremacy movie. <br />  <br />VERDICT: If DTS sound or Director Commentary tracks matter to you, DO NOT UPGRADE (yeah, right, upgrade); stick with or buy the older Collector's Edition DVD. If you don't already own the Collector's Edition or these factors don't matter and you intend to use the free Bourne Supremacy movie ticket BEFORE AUGUST 8TH, go with the Extended Edition DVD But shame on you, Universal for your promotional UPGRADE hogwash!!!
B00004XPPK|5.0|Being a film noir fan, I acknowledged the fact that Gilda was definately on my &quot;must-see&quot; list. But nothing had prepared me for how much I would like it!! The dialogue is...well, not top-rate, but you do you expect from a noir that's not Bogey or Robinson? It's classic, classic I tell you!  <br />  <br /> And even more importantly, the love triangle is so tightly constructed, you'll find yourself struggling for Gilda's decision even more than Glenn Ford. In fact, Hayworth's first appearance in the film is one of the most famous in Hollywood history, and in just one shot, you can tell exactly who and what she was to Ford.  <br />  <br /> Oh, and one more thing--if you happen to like classic 40s songs (like i do--especially if u heard Bacall in To Have and Have Not & the Big Sleep and liked it) you will LOVE Gilda's rendition of &quot;Put The Blame On Mame.&quot; Every film historian around knows that song, and through the slinky performance, we know that Ford is a fly caught in Gilda's sticky web.  <br />  <br /> I highly recommend this to everyone!! This is practically film noir at its greatest!!
B0001ME5L2|3.0|A lot of the songs on this album sound simular... Although Avril goes on TV saying the album is different than Let Go, as well as more rock'n'roll..., I think the only tracks that are somewhat rock are Take Me Away and Forgotten (which I think sounds simular to Unwanted).  All in all this is still a good effort,...but would have been better if there were more thought put into the lyrics. <br />Recomended songs: Take Me Away, Together, Don't Tell Me, My Happy Ending, Nobody's Home, Who Knows, Freak Out, Fall To Peices, Slipped Away, I Always Get What I Want, and the Nobody's Home acoustic track.
630326669X|3.0|Having grown up in the 60s, I have to say I saw some asinine, pretentious crap mixed in with the earnest good intentions. The studio footage in this DVD is great, the Goddard contributions and cuts are just plain aggravating. And embarassing. That part is so bad, it makes me cringe for my generation, and I thought about returning the DVD. But it's worth keeping for the Stones in the studio. I guess this is (more) proof that art and politics rarely mix well.   DC
B000002BBY|5.0|listen not to the most amazon recent reviews of this album; for this is oasis at their dazzling best. never before has rock history been mixed so effectively; cross the beatles with the sex pistols with the stone roses and you'll find noel and liam gallagher. oasis wear their influences on their sleeves, granted, but what good taste they have. <br /> <br />
0743243315|1.0|I have never read such a trashy novel!  Unless you know the true society of which the story is supposedly to be in, you will realized this book is based on the imagination of the author- not in reality.
B000066NW0|4.0|Avril's first cd is awesome! Each song is about something different and her lyrics are awesome..., better than the lyrics on her second album Under My Skin.  Some of the lyrics sound random in the context of the song, but that's what makes the songs better.  <br />Absolutly awesome album all around!
0440237688|5.0|Lois Lowry has many wonderful books and her writing creates a vivid picture in the mind of the reader, but in none such as The Giver. In his utopian society Jonas is completely happy. Everyday his routine is the same, each family has a mother and a father and two children. Several things happen that disrupt Jonas' perfect existance. Gabriel, a baby who cannot sleep through the night comes to live with them temporarily. Also Jonas looks forward to the annual ceremony in which he, as a twelve will be given his job assignment in which he will immediately begin his internship. When he is chosen as The Receiver of Memories, Jonas is baffled by everyones response. When he meets the old man who is The Giver of Memories, he is introduced initially to only good memories, but soon those of war and horror eventually follow. As the story continues Jonas comes to realize the price that has been paid for his utopian society to exist. He and The Giver must make a decision that will have serious consequences. Jonas also knows that he must act in order to save his baby brother Gabriel.  <br />  <br /> There are many ah-hah experiences throughout this novel in which Lowry reveals/explains something new. There are also a few shocking experiences that surprise the reader. There are many intricate details to the story, and young adults and even adult readers will be able to draw out so much meaning from this story. I recommend it for ages 12 and above. If you liked this book, you will also enjoy Lowry's Gathering Blue.
0440237688|1.0|1,000 Monkeys + 10 Typewriters + infinte time = The works of Shakespeare<br /><br /> 10 Monkeys + 5 Typewriters + 30 minutes = The Giver<br /><br /> Possibly the worst book I have ever read. Its only purpose is to take up your time. If I want to read fiction I'll read C.S Lewis or J.R.R Tolkien. I wasted a whole day on this book! And, if the author is trying to teach me something, I sure didn't pick it up. In the process of reading this book another thought came to me. If the author really put thought into this book, where there is everything from baby killing to a person burning up, then perhaps she needs a bit of R&R. The Giver reminds me of what I think of after a real bad day. I hope you can see what I mean.
B00002E224|5.0|Before Sunrise is everything that most romantic movies are not.  It is intelligent, mature, honest, and realistic in its depiction of relationships between men and women.   <br /> <br />Much of the film's success is due to its simple but fruitful premise.  Ethan Hawke plays a young American traveling in Europe who meets a young French woman on a train, played by Julie Delpy.  They sit and talk and soon realize that they both genuinely enjoy the other's company.  When Hawke's character reaches Vienna where he must catch a flight that night, he convinces Delpy's character to spend the rest of the day with him.   <br /> <br />Because they are strangers and because they will probably never see each other again after this day, their conversation is extremely candid, especially when it comes to their views about relationships.  They are able to be objective, even as they are falling in love - something that is rarely achieved in reality.   <br /> <br />I think we owe Richard Linklater a debt of gratitude for making this movie.  There are no story book trappings, no Hollywood gloss; just two people being honest with each other - truly connecting.  Isn't that what relationships and romance are all about?
6305907145|1.0|Absolutely awful. There's a reason why Austen's stories are still read and enjoyed almost two hundred years after they were written. Austen's caustic, yet ever so genteel commentaries on her society still resonate. Her use of language was superb. Yet, the writers of this screen play decided they could do better.  <br />  <br /> They kept the title, the character names and the bare essentials of the plot. Then, the writers went off on their own tangents, including an angst filled side plot about slavery, complete with graphics of group rape, torture, etc. <br />  <br /> What on earth does any of that have to do with Austen's story? And why did they feel it was necessary to ignore Austen's witty dialogue and commentary? Instead, the writers substituted their own &quot;hilarious&quot; bits, including &quot;but it's 1806, things like that happen now!&quot;  <br />  <br /> This is an unwieldy film, full of anachronisms, as well as errors in costuming and behavior. You are constantly conscious that these are modern actors bringing early 21st century sensibilities and behaviors to 19th century characters. It doesn't work. <br />  <br /> Rent it before you spend the money to buy, and more importantly, give this shelf space. As an Austen scholar, I found this movie as jarring as nails screeching across a blackboard. <br />
B000002H6C|5.0|JUSTICE FOR ALL is Metallica's BEST sounding record ever! Very raw dry as bone drum and base sound with super thickley layered wall of guitars. Anyone listening to Metal during the late 80's, early 90s will remember the slickly over produced over the top sounds of metal bands of the day. When Metalica released JUSTICE, it was like a big slap in the face. It changed the course of metal for years to come. This record did for Metal what Nervana's NeverMind did for pop rock at at the time. For all you youngins out there, pick this up and prepare to be schooled.
B0001Z53AQ|1.0|I agree to the reviewer David Taft. I heard tha newz that D12 (the biggest pu$$iez) with 30 retarded loserz jumped Esham and T.N.T. What kind of pu$$y $h!t iz dat??? Jumped on tha greatest Detriot rapperz. D12 and Eminem are jealous because they didnt started rap in Detriot and then bite Esham's style. Actually they are a disgrace to the Detriot rapperz.

B00000DC7J|5.0|I will just say that this is a beautiful work. Piazzolla is a master of emotions, he really knows that music is the universal languague of the heart. Particularly breathtaking is Milonga del Angel, a slow, rather melancholic tune. It makes you think of a rainy Buenos Aires on a dark winter night...<br /><br />What can I say, stop wasting your time, get this CD, lay on your couch and be prepared to be transported by this genius of what the heart and soul sing...
B00006RIO7|5.0|All the feeling of the jazz is in this CD. It has one of the best play music in all the time. The soundtrack begins with the amazing theme AND ALL THAT JAZZ, it has a lot of power thanks to Catherine, it's the movie, and of course play, theme; a masterpiece. WHEN YOU'RE GOOD TO MAMA is one of my favorite's songs by Queen Latifah. Next, the CELL BLOCK TANGO, one of the most representative songs of the movie with a marvelous arrangement. ALL I CARE ABOUT, one of my favorites too, is an elegant piece of music. WE BOTH REACHED FOR THE GUN, a magical song with a magnificent Gere.    <br />ROXIE, well this is a beautiful song, and one of the most representative of the movie. RAZZLE DAZZLE, my favorite, it has a lot of power, colorful, magic, it's a masterpiece. NOWADAYS, the last song is a beautiful, elegant, and wonderful ending with a good work of Renee and Catherine.    <br />I MOVE ONE, this song is very special, it was written for the movie; Oscar nominated is the alternative theme of the movie, this song is wonderful: a masterpiece.   <br />The two pieces of score are very good (AFTER MIDNIGHT & ROXIE'S SUITE) but the best is the second.   <br />This CD offers a good jazz, it's the best Chicago album. With the bonus tracks of CLASS, HE HAD IT COMIN', & LOVE IS A CRIME this soundtrack is a jazz jewel. <br />
B0001Z52RU|3.0|I cringed while watching this movie to the very end.  The acting is first-rate as is the time travel, alternate reality storyline. This is the major hook - can you go back in time in your mind and re-create your present life circumstances?  Possibly and very intriguing.  Amy Smart is quite good in playing 3 different kinds of Kayleigh.  Although all 3 were in love with Ashton's Evan, each Kayleigh is starkly different in each alternate reality.  If I could talk to the writer-director team about their movie, I would ask them and all filmmakers to keep violence against animals OUT of the movies.  If animal abuse was not enough, the senseless killing of people and the child porn subject are horrifying to watch.  It was only my love of time travel &  alternate reality stuff that kept me watching this movie with one eye shut, and I'm probably not going to recommend it to anyone I know. The writers could have made this a much more satisfying story without the sordid details hurled at the viewer.
0792839730|3.0|A Bridge Too Far is a massive undertaking, much like the true-life operation on which it was based, code named Market-Garden.  Allied troops were parachuted into the Netherlands to seize and hold bridges to aid a rapid advance by British armoured divisions.  Faulty intellegence caused the lightly-armed British 1st Airborne to be dropped into Arnhem in the midst of two SS Panzer divisions recently transferred there for R&R.  They were 60 miles behind enemy lines, expected to hold the Rhine bridge in Arnhem, which became the titular bridge too far.  Most of the division was killed or taken prisoner. <br /> <br />These facts are historical, and although I have not read Cornelius Ryan's book, I have read a number of histories on WWII, and the operation seems to be portrayed accurately.  In fact, the reason to buy the movie is to watch the strategic and tactical manouevering of the troops as they do battle.  Also, great performanes are put forth by Elliot Gould, Gene Hackman, et al.  Unfortunately, at 3 hours, it's a ponderous affair, often dwelling on the mundane, such as 10 minutes of footage of airplanes taking off.  Presumably this is to emphasize the scale of the operation, but really, we didn't need to see 6 shots of a single plane zooming over the camera!  A ruthless editor could improve the film greatly by cutting out the excess. <br /> <br />But the great disappointment of this DVD edition is not the film but the overall DVD package.  There are lots of documentaries out there - surely one could have been included on a film of this importance?  Likewise, although Cornelius Ryan is dead, why not bring in a military historian to do a commentary track?  John Keegan, Gwynne Dyer, or Victor Davis Hanson, to name a few, would be candidates for a commentary of this type.
B000003CKH|5.0|Cake's Fashion Nugget is quickly becoming one of my most listened-to albums because every song on here is so catchy. Mixing rock with the jazz sound is genius, and no one does it better than Cake on this album. All of Cake's albums are great in my opinion but I still say this one is the best yet. The lead singers voice sounding monotonic works perfectly, which combined with the music makes a very original cd and band for that matter. Anyhow, everyone should have heard The Distance by now--if you havent you have been living in a cave. That is still a great song, one of Cake's best, but each and every track on here is just as good or better than that. My favorite tracks on here include The Distance, Frank Sinatra, I Will Survive(great cover) and Italian Leather Sofa(even though it is a bit long).So you should definately check this one out asap, and once you do you will probably want to hear more Cake albums--they are that good.
B00005ABX0|5.0|First of all, let me say that as a young man whose favorite group of all time is The Beach Boys, Smiley Smile is without a doubt my favorite album. It is very different from any other Beach Boys disk in that it is somewhat of a dry and dark production.       I first got the album at the age of seven and immediately fell in love with it. At this point in my life, in the midst of massive family turmoil and loneliness I would put the LP version of this album on my Mom's console stereo and feel incredible comfort, as though it had been made especially for me. I knew that some things in my life were going terribly wrong, but I was not far along enough to know what they were (aside: my parents were on the verge of divorce). Maybe Brian Wilson had similar thoughts and emotions about dissension in the group while creating Smiley Smile. Who knows-just wondering.         Since that time this has always been my favorite all time recording. And as I have grown up and become a musician, I have come to understand why artists such as Pete Townshend and Robby Robertson site Smiley Smile as one of their favorite rock albums- it is brilliant and unlike anything, ever.       The beautiful timbre of the group's vocals over what is mostly very spare music is more pronounced on this recording than any other in their catalog. Although the album contains a couple of wonderful works of production, Good Vibrations and Heroes and Villians to think of this as a Beach Boys album to be compared with their earlier hits or even the beautiful Pet Sounds album is, in all honesty, missing the point.        In my opinion, songs like Little Pad and Wonderful are not meant to be played alongside sunbathers at the beach; they are meant to accompany dark, stormy summer days that were bleak and maybe a little scary. Also, this recording has elements of humor, sadness, and confusion in songs like Wind Chimes and Fall Breaks Into Winter which add to the incredible human warmth of the recording.In essence, Smiley Smile is a little spooky and sometimes goofy (the boys were high on a few of the tracks supposedly) but that doesn't make it any less of a delight, in fact they add a documentary like element to the album.        Many people will probably respond that Smiley Smile is nothing more than an album of Smile leftovers, but I can only tell you that this album is a wonderful experience all it's own. Coupled with the great R&B of Wild Honey, it is well worth your time.
B000002C1W|2.0|There is nothing on this album that you haven't heard already in 80's pop (David Bowie, 80's Springsteen, even Outfield). The entire album feels canned, prefabricated, and overproduced..... which would be FINE, had another 80's outfit recorded it. Unfortunately, a rich legacy including AMAZING albums such as DSOTM, WYWH, and Animals is here abandoned with the exit of Roger Waters. David Gilmour is the only Floyd member who plays on all the tracks (Mason and Wright do minor work), and he forsakes his guitar far too much in order to add canned synthesizers and cheap effects. He also writes most of the lyrics, which are flat and uninteresting after hearing Waters' lyrics. &quot;A New Machine, Part 1,&quot; &quot;Terminal Frost,&quot; and &quot;A New Machine, Part 2,&quot; is the worst block of Floyd music to date. <br />  <br /> I'm not being a Floyd nerd, but this album, AS a Pink Floyd recording, fails miserably. It is badly dated and devoid of the psychedelic flavor featured on nearly every other Floyd album, and lacks the classic rock riffs and ballads that &quot;The Wall&quot; and &quot;The Final Cut&quot; deliver.  <br />  <br /> Yet there are a few saving graces of this album. The organ part towards the middle of the instrumental &quot;Signs of Life&quot; sounds like a throwback to Iron Butterfly-era rock (but the 80's flavor is still undeniable). Gilmour has a few interesting solos throughout the album, and &quot;On the Turning Away&quot; is a good song..... NOT a great song-- if the boys had just laid off the cheesy effects in this song, it would have been a GREAT, more simple ballad that rivaled the terrific song, &quot;Wish You Were Here.&quot; <br />  <br /> All in all, if you need to complete your collection, get this album.... But if you love the David Gilmour of &quot;Darkside&quot; and &quot;WYWH,&quot; you will be sorely disappointed by this effort... But if you ARE a fan of cheesy 80's rock, go for it! This is a novelty.
B00005JLXE|2.0|I had high hopes for this movie; the cast is great (at least for the female lead, and Kingpin, even though it took me a while to get used to that).  I usually like comics, and the movies they lead to, but this was developed too slowly and overall it was too dark, and I wasn't able to see the Daredevil character as anybody to look up to.  I was extremely unhappy on my first viewing (I may have even fallen asleep), but after my expectations were lowered, it wasn't as bad on future viewings.  I think this was made with the hope of making a franchise, but they really blew it.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Let me start by saying that I'm a long-term Zeppelin fan, and that this DVD has received almost as much play time in my machine as The Big Lebowski (another main stay). For the most part, the footage is wonderfully restored, and most of the performances are stirring and edgey.  Let me say it one more time, I REALLY LIKE THIS DVD. <br /> <br />Now... for the negatives.  Jimmy Page produced and directed this film and much of the footage is fairly self serving.  There are lots and lots of shots of Page and Plant, a fair number of shots of Bohnham, but only a meager collection of John Paul Jones shots.  Unfortunately, even during some of his mandolin and keyboard solos the camera strays toward Page and Plant entirely too much.  Also non-Zeppelin or luke-warm Zeppelin fans be ware. The entire first disk, and much of the second disk, was filmed when Jimmy Page was a raging drug addict.  Hence, in the first disk in particular, Page is prone to going into drug induced guitar rants that can be quite long and don't always make a lot of sense.  It is not until the end of disk two that we see Jimmy Page in a more consistent light at the Knebworth concerts that were filmed in 1979.   <br /> <br />Now that I have voiced my minor complaints I'll state it one more time but in a different way...  This is a MUST HAVE DVD for rock & roll afficionados.  In particular, I hope some younger customers by this DVD, so that they can see where much of the hard rock that they are into now is coming from.
B000286S8S|4.0|Blah! Blah! Blah! Okay, so you don't like the album. So many people are complaining. That is fine! However, you saw the song list-nobody put a gun to your head! If you don't like it, \\"burn\\" it and move on! All Greatest Hits are not perfect. I wish the CD had some different songs too. However, the Record Companies are almost always going to put the \\"Hits\\" or \\"Singles\\" on the albums. They don't care about the \\"diehard\\" fans who would know songs such as \\"Seventh Seal,\\" \\"Mine All Mine\\" or \\"Cabo Wabo!\\" Those songs mean nothing to the casual fan and unfortunately, that is who is being \\"catered too\\" here! Let's just be glad the boys are back! This is a nice improvement over Best of Vol. 1. Especially with \\"Jamie's Cryin'\\" and \\"Love Walks In!\\"
B000002N2Z|4.0|The Deftones have been one of my favorite bands for a while now. That is because they continue to develope in themselves and not how the media and the industry shifts. Even their dissapointments are not enough to take them out of my top ten favorite band list.  <br /> This is where the Deftones began. This is the CD that started their career. And while Around The Fur was their big break-out success, after that, their style began to develope with their identity. BUt with this CD, it's entertaining, because this is back before they really knew exactly who they were, they just seemed like they had a rough idea. The music is very rough and raw, and will just punch you in the stomach. THis CD is more hardcore oriented than their later ones, and probably a lot more darker. Interestingly enough, the lyrics on this debut are probably more artistic and metaphorical than on their later stuff! What are the chances of that? <br /> My only problems with the CD were that it was too short, and it seems very rough and ill produced. I'm not sure what they were going for, but it sounds very old school (which isn't always bad, but some of the songs it wears away at the music).  <br /> I didn't like Bored, but MInus Blindfold quickly became a favorite of mine. The lyrics are cryptic. I read them several times and couldn't figure out what it was about, but it's angry. It's like &quot;ball tongue&quot; by Korn, for the deftones. One weak is a little melodic hard rock diddy that builds atmosphere with more cryptic lyrics. Nosebleed is a favorite because of how manically Chino switches around between frustrated and angry to melodic and semi-frustrated; they don't convey this as well in later albums; love the bridge, it's so slow and haunting. Lifter is another one i skip over, but again, it has interesting lyrics, just like every deftones song they will ever put out. Root starts off boring but picks up. During the bridge, Chino starts freaking out and doing this rappy trip-hop that remindsme of Jonathin Davis, only this is way more psychotic. THis would be awsome on later albums, but he doesn't do it.  <br /> 7 words is my favorite. With music reminiscent of Tool and Chino talking the versus without any melody before exploding into noise while he screams, &quot;Suck, suck, suck, suck...they f*** with my head!&quot; this song becomes an instant classic in my book. the Rapping during the bridge in this song is some of the best I've heard. Chino sounds like such a white boy, but he gets so into the rap and the rythm. This is another element that Chino has lost, and no other band can properly do, rap. The lyrics sound like it's about society and gangs or something; says something about having colored skin. <br /> Birthmark is very atmospheric and reminds me of a Tool song. It's a great change of pace for an album of such diverity. <br /> Engine number Nine makes Limp Biskit look childish. Chino again raps frantically and madly about, again, God knows what. Have we heard CHino as a rapper somewhere else? because on this CD, he's just so WICKED! <br /> Fireal is a good closing track, (kind of a closing track,) where CHino speaks cryptic lyrics yet again before doing his trademark throaty scratch thing that would appear on later albums, that sounds like cats fighting. <br /> Fist Is a strange sort of closure. I don't think it was really meant to be a song, but more of an outro. I still haven't found the lyrics to it, and it's extrmeley hard to tell what CHino is saying, but it's one of the most beautiful endings and after-the-fact's of an album I have ever heard. <br />  <br /> ALl in all, this is a very interesting album from one of my favorite bands. Get it to hear a rougher and younger Deftones that will never come back.
B00005JMEW|2.0|Maybe I should've known better than to take my friend's young daughters to this show one afternoon while babysitting.  Greetings my loyal constituency, and welcome to musings of a - oh no! gasp! shriek! - MIDDLE-AGED white gal.  Because of Uma Thurman and her status as a proud big-boned female I knew this movie was a must-see.  Sure enough, she manages to steal the show with her ninjitsu kicking and flipping.  But for a teenage and a pre-teen girl, yes, both budding neo-feminists (as I), the movie will make you groan over the VIOLENT images.  I'll never watch the Volume 2 because I know it is only more of the same lowest-common-denominator crud.  To their credit, my friend's girls came out gagging over the bloody scenes vividly rendered in the works of Quentin Tarantino and I took them to Friendly's for a fried Apple Muffin with enough pure butter to clog their arteries permanently.  Sue me, because I don't think females should go hungry as Uma Thurman did in preparation for this over-praised piece of sexism.

Every 10 to 20 pages is yet another plot twist. At well over 500 pages, that's a few too many. <br />  <br />I really tried to like this novel. I enjoy mystery novels and really liked the film Bourne Identity, so I figured I would enjoy this book. Well, it was enjoyable, certainly in the first third, but after a while, it dragged on to an awkward conclusion. This book is jam-packed with plot turns, new character introductions, and lots of repetitive inner-monologue.  <br />  <br />I was really shocked. With Ludlum's reputation, I really expected a tight thriller. It was anything but. I grew tired of the yet-another-plot-device about 150 pages before the conclusion. Which for me, was the worst part... <br />  <br />The ending is very unfulfilling. The books leads up to a climax, yet... well, I won't ruin it for you, in case you decide to see for yourself. I'll just say this - GIGANTIC loose ends (one almost impossible to believe), which left me wanting. So... <br />  <br /> I picked up Bourne Supremacy to see if Ludlum begins to tie the loose ends up. After all, I am aware this is the Bourne Trilogy. But... nope. Bourne Supremecy - brand new plot, without trying to clear up the unanswered questions of the first book. I had to stop reading that book for fear of more unfulfilled plot promises. <br />  <br />It reminded me of the sprawling plot twists in the endless X-Files series, which ultimately petered out without conclusion. With so much invested, in this case 535 pages, you've got to give me an ending. Jeez. <br />  <br />The movie, it should be stated, is very different, tossing the entire (main) Carlos-the-Assassin plot, for a very tight, streamlined film that BARELY resembles this book. Which is good for the movie. I haven't seen Supremacy, so I have no comment, but I've heard from friends that it strays even farther from the novels. <br />  <br />Wait... The movie is BETTER than the book?! Yep. No one's more shocked than me.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Sure, I vaquely remember seeing ads for Firefly when it was actually on the air.  But all they did was make me wince at what looked like a completely unwatchable blend of sci-fi and western.  Another cheaply made, cliche ridden type of bad science fiction television.  It abounds.    I have never been more wrong about a show in my entire life.    A friend handed me the series DVD and told me to I HAD to watch it; it was sooo good.  Being off for the summer, and with seemingly no good television left on the air I thought - why not?    Halfway into the pilot episode, I was hooked.  Completely, totally, irretrievably and obsessively hooked.  I have not been so taken in by a series since...well, I can't really remember.  I have proudly upheld Firefly's 5-star rating here on Amazon, and I do so with absolutely no reservations.  Everything about this show was original, interesting, and well done.  Lots of humor, angst, romance, drama and adventure - and great production values - make this a treat to see.  But the real strength lies in the ensemble cast and the subtle, deep and complex characterizations between them.  This ensemble is one of the finest I have ever run across - and it shows.      Do what I did and take a chance.  Nearly two years after this show came on the air, I am one of Firefly's biggest fans.  I am betting anyone who sees the series DVD will be too.
B000062YAZ|5.0|Reign in Blood is the hardest, fastest, meanest, sleaziest, and sexiest album I have ever heard. Perhaps there's something out there that can beat it in one or several categories, but I've yet to hear something that's topped Reign In Blood in all of them. And, if this said album ever comes around, it will no doubt be a spiritual child of Reign in Blood. <br />  <br /> &quot;Angel of Death&quot; says just about everything that needs to be said about the band. The lyrics are brutal to a point where it seems silly, but the top notch thrash guitar gives it all the authenticity it needs. Hanneman and King are top notch guitar players, but I sincerely believe that it's Dave Lombardo's expert percussion that makes Slayer as great as it is. When he left the band later on his void was easily felt.  <br />  <br /> The rest of the songs rarely pass the four minute mark, which is a wiuse decision since they do everything they can do in the time they have and any more would be overstaying their welcome. Slayer hits all their marks without any pretencious or frilly distractions. Slayer wants to rock and they don't act like they have any higher goals than that. <br />  <br /> Overall, Reign in Blood is a cathartic exercise rivaled by no other band I've heard. It was wise of Slayer to go for a more song oriented format on future albums though. The passion and rage captured on Reign in Blood was like lightning in a bottle. I doubt they could've done it as effectively again.
B000001EEN|3.0|Look, it's very simple: Clapton on smack is more soulful, more exciting, more interesting, than most contemporary guitarists on ecstasy. Or mineral water, or whatever it is they do. On this disc he's out of practice, and it shows--if you are a seasoned fan. Badge is played very close to the original, in sharp contrast to the double-time versions he played in the Eighties, with solos polished to a chrome shine. Let It Rain chunks along, with a superfluous conga solo by Traffic percussionist Rebop. But it's all still wonderful, with the cleaned up sound and expanded tracks. Sure, this is of mostly historical interest: Clapton hadn't been ready for the Dominoes to be over, when he went into seclusion, and he hadn't yet reinvented himself with 461 Ocean Boulevard. So this is a glimpse of him hanging between two worlds. Or, trying to climb back into this one.<br /><br /> Trivia: Pete Townshend plays the Gretsch Country Gentleman guitar, a gift from Joe Walsh, that Townshend used to record The Who's classic Who's Next. It wouldn't stay in tune for stage work so this is one of the instrument's only concert appearances.
0316286850|5.0|I am also a Makeup Artist in Los Angeles, where makeup artists are on every corner, and I must say Kevin is/was a true talent. When I read his heartfelt words, I realize he's not only a genius artist, but the most open-minded humanitarian as well. Him AND his work are truely inspirational...his art, I personally think, puts other makeup books to shame. From a proffesional standpoint I think his book is extremely good to have but his book will also be useful to the everyday person as he goes into alot of different helpful techniques. His book is amazing-so if you love makeup, go get it!
B00003JRCQ|5.0|&quot;Most faithful&quot; doesn't always equal &quot;best&quot; for film adaptations: often you want to see a new angle to the material if you loved the book that formed the basis for the screenplay. Yet Roger Michell's adaptation of &quot;Persuasion&quot; for the BBC is perhaps the most faithful of the many Austen adaptations that followed, and is still simultaneously the best. Like Patricia Rozema in :&quot;Mansfield Park,&quot; he brings great intelligence and brings forth certain latent ideas in the text that speak to the era in which he filmed it: he shows the grubbiness of the Regency era, and emphasizes the differences in class relations. But unlike Rozema, Michell has the good sense to trust Austen and allow his heroine to be as quiet and as patient as the author wrote her to be. Amanda Root, with her beautiful undertsanding eyes that speak volumes, is as faithful to Austen's conception of the role as could be imagined. The rest of the cast is terrific: Corin Redgrave enjoyed some well deserved praise later in his career for his snobbish and empty headed Sir Walter Elliot, and Phoebe Nicholls is just as good as his eldest daughter (given to fits of pique against her sister Anne). The compositions are also marvelous, with tremendous innovative use being made of the actual Bath and Lyme Regis locations.
B000062X90|5.0|There are enough details in other reviews here, so I will simply say that I cannot say enough about this collection.  It is suffused with that rarely captured breath of creative inspiration that musicians aspire to and listeners yearn for.  Fortunate musicians know the profound satisfaction that arises from playing in that place where the music flows, knows no time, and has never been heard before.  This is where Argus comes from.  A widely varied palette of music that stands alone.

B00005JN2F|5.0|Just got back from the theatre (went late, so had to sit half-way up :-() <br /> <br />I settled down to the camera-work quickly, which is a little unsettling (!), but not that painful as some make it out to be - in fact, it makes the action even more exciting.  Brings the viewer right in the midst of things, if you can't take the heat, stay at home ;-)  Don't, though - you'll miss some fine action.  And really, not all the scenes have the hand-held shots, only a few. <br /> <br />I was going to wait for the DVD, but am glad I went to the theatre.  Worth watching twice, IMHO.... and I shall see it on DVD as well. <br /> <br />Storyline - well, it's Bourne, just like Bond, without the chicks/fancy cars & gadgets...  He actually commandeers a rotten taxi!!  Fast action, go with that expectation and you won't be disappointed.  And suspend your disbelief (just what you do while enjoying Spiderman!!)  But Matt Damon makes Bourne believable, even human... well, except he doesn't get killed, but hey, he's Bourne!! <br /> <br />If that wasn't clear enough - it's a great movie!  Go see it :-)
0802130208|3.0|Hmmm. Well. Hmmm. From the hyperbole on the cover, I expected to be clutching my sides and rolling with laughter. Didn't happen. Oh, the story is amusing enough, and the writing is well done. But protagonist Ignatius J. Reilly is a disagreeable character. I was nearly a third of the way through the book before I warmed up to him enough to make the rest of the book worth reading. <br /> <br />Ignatius is a 30-year-old man who lives at home in New Orleans with his aging and alcoholic mother. He graduated from college with a Master's degree in some unspecified field, although I suspect it was literature or history. He believes he is brilliant (and might actually be right) and the rest of the world consists of idiots, morons, and other subhumans. He is unemployed and spends most of his time in his room where he writes, sleeps, eats and masturbates. An automobile accident causes a monetary crisis and he is forced to seek employment. Oh, the inhumanity of it all, he must consort with inferior beings, and therein lie the conflict and humor of the story.  <br /> <br />Once he got out of his room and into the world at large, he became an interesting person. His literary asides (letters, journal entries, etc.) are entertaining and elicited a chuckle or two, and his frequent rants against injustice and malice are inspired, not to mention more than a little delusional and paranoid. <br /> <br />Worth reading. Once. <br />
0679720200|4.0|If you don't know anything about existentialism before you read this book, you will after you finish it. Existentialism is basically the idea that life boils down to nothing more than existence. One lives their life while they are alive and then they die, and in the grand scheme of things none of it really matters. Existentialist, whose greatest representative is Camus, do not generally believe in an afterlife, spirituality or deeper meaning to life. For just over 100 pages, you are hit in the face with these ideas while reading The Stranger.  <br /> <br />The plot of The Stranger could be summarized easily and completely in a single paragraph. It is really not a plot driven book, although it does have a few moments of suspense. The pithy prose is concise and eloquent in the style of Hemingway, but does not rival him (at least in this translation). The text itself reads quite easily, and you will probably find yourself flipping through pages faster than you usually do.  <br /> <br />Overall, The Stranger is a modern classic and well worth the short amount of time that it takes to read. One of the reasons I may not have loved this book is because it is not in anyway uplifting. The book really leaves you with a sense of emptiness as you turn the last page, as it's meant to, so reading it might not be an enjoyable and light-hearted experience. Those interested in reading Camus for the first time may also want to consider The Plague as a first read. The message is slightly more subtle in its presentation and the story is probably more interesting.
B00025ETIW|5.0|I first heard of MCR from one of my friends who was completely obsessed with them. Now after buying CDs and listening to them for days on end I see why. I first listened to them one day when I was bored roaming the mall. I went into Hot Topic and all I needed to hear was a short demo of &quot;Give em' hell kid&quot; and I had to have the CD. It is now one of my favorite CDs and they are now one of my favorite bands.
0385512104|4.0|I have no idea whether or not autism is being oversimplified here, but Haddon, at the very least, has given his readers a believable notion of what it must be like. Haddon never allows the narrative to get melodramatic, probably because he wisely chooses to let his autistic savant to speak for himself. A moving examination of a condition that is barely comprehended by society, and of how society responds to those it views as aberrant. A fascinating moment in the narrative comes when the autistic Christopher Boone relates his favorite dream: a world in which all normal people die of a virus that the autistic are immune to. The autistic are then free to lead their lives in silence and without the need to look others in the eye or to interpret idiomatic speech. A very thoughtful and thought-provoking novel.
B000001GPX|5.0|I have not any doubt in stating that this set means a great legacy about the enormous talent and musicality present in Carlos Kleiber , who pitifully died a days ago .<br />  These performances with the Vienna have noblesse and majesty . Despite the fact that very few conductors in the globe (Barenboim among them) are capable of playing Beethoven with authentic commitment about the inner values underlined underneath the score .<br />  Kleiber was a musician gifted with great talent . I knew about him through a video in a Beethoven program with the Concertgebouw of Amsterdam in 1986 .<br />  Since this recording was released I acquired it almost inmediatly , convinced as effectively I was , Kleiber had something new to say about Beethoven .<br />  In fact these performances are loaded with magnificent deepness. The Vienna Philarmonic as you know is among the top orchestras all around the world .<br />  The fifth is filled with histamine and conviction . Kleiber never was an effectist director , and he was gifted with wide vision about Beethoven . When this happens the musician play and create a different sound because they know they are guided for a leader .<br />  The seventh is really good , you will miss the powerful Furtwangler version of 1947 , for instance or 1943 , but anyway there are worthable for a new listener or well a veteran in the field . Both of these works are really winner . Try with this album and you inmediatly feel (since the first bars) that idyisoncratic difference .<br />  Carlos Kleiber : In memoriam!
B00005JMX6|4.0|What is it with critics nowadays? They fall all over themselves praising the &quot;American Pie&quot; films, in which morons drink bodily fluids and make love to apple pies and girls exist mainly to have sex with. (Maybe that's too harsh, but you get the point.) Then &quot;The Girl Next Door&quot; opens and you'd think it's the sleaziest piece of trash in the history of cinema, simply because the TV ads were deceptive and didn't mention that one of the main characters is a porn star. Ebert and Roeper were especially hard on it, using words like  <br /> &quot;despicable&quot; to describe it. Come on, now. I'm a sensitive guy and believe me, &quot;The Girl Next Door,&quot; while hardly a great film, is not nearly that bad. Actually, at times it is quite funny and no more offensive than the film that clearly inspired it, namely 1984's &quot;Risky Business.&quot; And it has several superior performances by a promising young cast anchoring the silliness. <br />  <br /> The wonderful young actor Emile Hirsch stars as Matthew Kidman, his school's senior class president who feels he has wasted his high school career studying and is ready to cut loose and party with his two horny (and nerdy) best friends. Then he sees the ravishingly beautiful Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert of TV's &quot;24&quot;), who has just moved in next door. They meet cute and start dating, until Matthew finds out she is a retired porn star. Then her sleazeball &quot;producer&quot; (Timothy Olyphant) shows up and forces her back into the biz, so Matthew takes it upon himself to save her from such an unsavory lifestyle.  <br />  <br /> That's the gist of it. That's what so many critics are riled up about. In &quot;Risky Business&quot; Tom Cruise and prostitute Rebecca DeMornay operate a bordello in Cruise's parents' house. Here, the hero is trying to rescue his beloved from the sex trade. How offensive! Yes, the porn industry is not presented in nearly as sleazy a light as it probably is, and Cuthbert is notexactly believably worldly as the porn star. And the ending does go way off the deep end when Matthew and his friends hatch a scheme and attempt to pull it off during the senior prom, culminating in a plot twist that is unbelievably ridiculous to say the least. But then, the film is rated &quot;R&quot; for a reason. It's an adult fantasy, much in the same way &quot;Risky Business&quot; was, although not quite as good. <br />  <br /> As I said, Cuthbert isn't believable as a porn star, but she exhibits strong screen presence and makes a better impression in 100-or-so minutes than she has in three seasons as the dippy, annoyingly stupid Kim Bauer on &quot;24.&quot; And Olyphant is typically sleazy, quite funny and even scarily unhinged as the producer/pimp, while Christopher Marquette (TV's &quot;Joan of Arcadia&quot;) is an absolute hoot as Matthew's sex-obsessed, foul-mouthed friend and Paul Dano, the terrific young actor from &quot;L.I.E.&quot;, scores solidly as a shy introvert named Klitz. (Yes, that's really his name!) But the film clearly belongs to Emile Hirsch, who I feel is quite simply the most exciting young talent to come out of Hollywood since, well, Tom Cruise. And he's a better actor, to boot. Witness his roles in &quot;The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys&quot; and &quot;The Emperors' Club,&quot; then compare them to this one and, especially, his remarkable work in the strange and little seen wonder &quot;The Mudge Boy.&quot; You may well find it hard to believe that the disarmingly handsome Matthew and the strange, goofy-looking oddball Duncan Mudge are played by the same young man, who changes his looks not through makeup but simply by the way he clenches his jaw and uses his eyes. He is a talent to watch and a possible superstar-in-the-making.  <br />  <br /> In short, &quot;The Girl Next Door&quot; has cult-classic potential written all over it. It looks great, it's fast-paced, and it features five young actors who should have long and fruitful careers ahead of them. Forget the fuddy-duddy critics. They're over-the-top on this one. &quot;The Girl Next Door&quot; isn't for everyone, but for those who are game, it rocks. ****
0761536434|5.0|This comprehensive book covers the entire history of video games, from the first pinball machines right up to before the launch of the Gamecube and Xbox.  Telling the story from the viewpoints of the people who actually made the games happen, this book gives gamers and non-gamers alike a better appreciation of video games and the changes that they have brought to the world, even when they weren't for the better.  Strongly recommended.  I hope there will be an expansion pack someday.
B000067CPX|4.0|All great bands evolve.  Just because you've already made your signature statement doesn't mean you have to quit or spend the rest of your career parodying yourself.  So, while it took a long time, I've gotten over the Chilis' maturation.  True, Blood Sugar Sex Magic is one of the best albums of the '90s, and it would have been fun if the band had stayed wild, exuberant and funky forever, but come on, these guys have been around for 20 years.  They have to either change or bore themselves to death, and even though they sound like a totally different band, they're still better than 90% of the bands out there. <br /> <br />So once you accept that this album represents the Chilis as we will have to learn to like them, there's actually quite a lot to like.  The songs are more mature, more polished, more balanced - the band now, for better or worse, relies much less on the incredible virtuosity of their bass and guitar players.  In fact, while Frusciante still creates some interesting sounds, Flea's presence is much more subdued than it was in the past, when he was the band's clear (and deserving) focal point.   It seems an odd move to switch the emphasis to vocals - Anthony Kiedis is a great showman, but he can't, in the proper sense of the word, sing - but Frusciante's harmonies are beautiful and somehow make it work. <br /> <br />So, the point is, this CD grows on you.  I still don't know the names of any of the songs, except Cabron and Can't Stop - most don't seem as individually memorable as the band's earlier work - but that may be the point.  It flows together as a very cohesive work, and is overall a pleasant listening experience (it's somewhat similar to Californication, but softer and with better singing).  Just don't expect to be knocked on your butt by the first listen, and this one could subtly work its way into your rotation - just kind of by the way.
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|Bursting onto the music scene with their self titled debut &quot;Franz Ferdinand&quot;, single &quot;Take Me Out&quot; and bad haircuts, this four-piece band from Glasgow have delivered a great refreshing album that is both simultaneously original and familiar.  <br />  <br /> Difficult to catergorise, Franz Ferdinand can only be described as the unusual, but wholly welcome union between alternative, rock and pop music that continues to challenge the traditional boundaries between the three. <br />  <br /> Filled with catchy guitar-driven hooks and the carefree Strokes-like vocals of lead singer Kapranos, each song from Franz Ferdinand, from Jacqueline to 40' - some with a distinctly disco-esque feel - makes you want to stand up and dance. Indeed, the band itself professes that its ambition in creating music was to create music that &quot;girls could dance to&quot;.  <br />  <br /> As for the lyrics, it reflects the art-y schooling and influences of the band ranging from the cheeky - &quot;can you feel my lips undress your eyes in &quot;Darts of Pleasure&quot; - to the poetic - &quot;This lonely / It rips and pierces me / In places I can't see&quot;. <br />  <br /> Smart and class - wine is their preferred drink - Franz Ferdiand again proves that music and fun walk hand in hand.
B00004U8H4|3.0|The argument was that &quot;American Psycho&quot; was not really a look at a serial killer but rather a satirical expose on yuppie executives circa the mid-1980s. However, as far as I am concerned this 2000 film fails on both scores. There is a lot of blood but neither a sense of horror nor suspense, which is usually what you want to find in a thriller. As for the social satire, the problem is that the character of Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) and the rest of his wall street execu-yuppies are all so fake, more reminiscent of a comedy sketch on &quot;Mad TV&quot; than anything else, and I would think the point would be to capture more of the real essence of such a life (e.g., &quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot; or &quot;The Boiler Room&quot;).<br /><br /> The film was directed by Mary Harron (&quot;I Shot Andy Warhol&quot;), who also did the screenplay, which probably explains why the Bret Easton Ellis novel has been toned down for the silver screen. The point being made, as near as I can tell, is that Patrick Bateman kills people, not because he is so very different from everyone else around him, but essentially because he is just like the rest of his cohorts, only more so. Some of the murders appear to be random and others the result of jealousy, but sometimes the best answer is that the death speaks to Bateman's vanity. The whole opening of &quot;American Psycho&quot; is an introduction to his narcissism, which means it provides the prime motivation for not only his murderous outbursts but also everything else in his life.<br /><br /> Because everything fits the pattern I have to work from the premise that the film is what the director intended, but it just does not achieve the desired result. My prediction is that if you bother to watch this film, then at some point you are going to burst out laughing and dollars to donuts it will be for some unintentional reason. Furthermore, as you watch the film you will find yourself thinking of a whole lot of films that suddenly look a lot better when compared to &quot;American Psycho&quot; (&quot;I Spit on Your Grave&quot; and &quot;Showgirls&quot; were just the first two that came to mind). I am willing to grant that Harron was trying to do something to redeem the original novel, but this film just fails across the board, whether we are talking the sex and the violence or the psychological insights and social satire.hat suddenly look a lot better when compared to &quot;American Psycho&quot; (&quot;I Spit on Your Grave&quot; and &quot;Showgirls&quot; were just the first two that came to mind).

B000002UY3|3.0|Mazzy Star's brand of tambourine pop isn't terribly compelling on the first listen, since it's all mellow and swirly and gentle. Nary a pop hook or goofy sentiment can be found. But &quot;She Hangs Brightly&quot; has an odd quality of sinking into your brain and making you feel almost as mellow as the music.<br /><br /> The first few songs sound a bit too similar, except for the roaring guitar riff in &quot;Blue Flower.&quot; Then things stray into psychedelic turf in the spacey &quot;She Hangs Brightly,&quot; followed by the vaguely tropical &quot;I'm Sailin',&quot; pleasant &quot;Give You My Lovin',&quot; the distant and slightly eerie &quot;Taste of Blood,&quot; echoing and creepy &quot;Ghost Highway,&quot; and finishing off with the soft &quot;Before I Sleep.&quot;<br /><br /> Psychedelica. Blues. Folk. They don't usually go together, but they mesh in a moderately successful way here. &quot;She Hangs Brightly&quot; is simply sweet blues-folk-psychedelica-pop without pretensions. It's not outstanding or earthshattering, but it does make you drift away on its sweet melodies.<br /><br /> Guitar and a tambourine are the center of the music -- again, things that don't seem to go together. The electric guitar is a constant dark presence behind the vocals, swirling and growling constantly; the acoustic guitar adds a more organic sound to songs like &quot;I'm Sailin'.&quot; And then the tambourine gets hit about every two seconds, on average.<br /><br /> Hope Sandoval has a lovely voice, very soft, childlike and clear. At times she sounds like a folkier version of Sundays frontwoman Harriet Wheeler; the biggest flaw with it is that sometimes her voice sounds strangely metallic. And the songwriting itself has either a sweetly Southern flair, or a wistful quality (&quot;She hangs brightly from the tree/Wonders what she's done to me...&quot;)<br /><br /> Mazzy star's &quot;She Hangs Brightly&quot; is a pretty, folky little album with angelic vocals and some nice tambourine/guitar pop songs. A pleasant listen.nice tambourine/guitar pop songs. A pleasant listen.

B00005JN2F|2.0|I loved the first Bourne movie and couldn't wait to see this one. Although the story was ok the cinematography was horrible. The highly excessive camera shake and extremely fast scene changes absolutely ruined the film in my opinion. I mean c'mon, there are some scenes where everything on the screen is motionless, except the camera. All that camera shake did not add any sort of realism, it just made it very difficult to watch the movie and sucked the fun right out of it. And regarding the quick scene changes, I imagine there are a select few humans who may actually be able to focus on the screen in the few nano-seconds allowed but I'm not one of them. I feel like I missed 1/2 the film because my eyes didn't get a chance to focus. And trust me, my eyes were fixed on the screen in a sincere attempt. Bottom line - if I could do it over again I would not see this movie in the theatre, not even if it was free.

Immediately following the director's credit <br /> as the camera is moving out of the dark alleyway onto the busy <br /> downtown N.Y. street filled with traffic the picture stops or <br /> &quot;pauses&quot; for a few seconds before moving forward. Has anyone <br /> else encountered this problem? Help! please let me know as this <br /> is a major debit for this film fan!
B00008H2LB|4.0|Linkni Park's second album, Meteora is an excellent disc. The lyrics are strong and each song has it's own unique sound. Their first album, Hybrid Theory, was one of the best albums i'd ever heard. It's virtually impossible to create 2 perfect albums, but Linkin Park did an excellent job at trying.
B00009V7P8|2.0|If you're looking to buy O because you like the Cannonball version they play on the radio, save your money.  What you get with the album is a two-track version of the song--just vocals and acoustic guitar.  Where are those subtle drums and the great orchestration?  Thankfully Rice's skills as a songwriter are so strong, because his voice simply isn't good enough to be the focal point of an arrangement. <br /> <br />Cannonball sounds empty, as does most of the album, which is ridiculously underproduced and poorly mixed.  When I found out this was a home recording, I wasn't surprised one bit; and all I can think of was that the label released it before it was done.  This is a mediocre album that could have been GREAT; and to someone like myself who writes and produces music, that's criminal.
B000089RVX|4.0|I can understand how many people think that Fallen is the same in many ways...because it is. I've known about Evanescence for about 4 years now, and that says something because most Evanescence fans only know about them because they heard Bring Me To Life over played on the radio so many times. <br />  <br /> What some people don't know is that, in my opinion there are 2 different sides of Evanescence; the Origin side and the Fallen side. Fallen really gave them fan exposure, and let them break out into the mainstream rock world. <br /> On the other hand Origin, and many of the earlier songs that aren't on Origin, really displayed this band's amazing range of musical ability. From piano driven ballads like &quot;You&quot; to the more techno side of their music, a la &quot;Forever Gone, Forever You&quot; or &quot;Surrender&quot; all the way even to a simple lullaby; &quot;Goodnite&quot; and to an entire chorus-driven song without Amy's vocals, &quot;Listen to the Rain&quot; this band has more range then most bands of the presnent do. <br />  <br /> I waited a very long time to buy Fallen, and the day it came out I had to go out and buy it. I remember sitting in my room thinking, &quot;Wow! Some of these songs are completely different compared to older versions.&quot; And though I have to admit that I was a little disappointed with the album, overall it's not that bad. Sure Amy's voice has been altered using a computer, but who's voice isn't now-a-days? And if you compare a live performance to a song on Fallen, you'll see that her voice wasn't changed that much. <br />  <br /> True Evanescence is no longer really Evanescence without Ben Moody; but with a little help from their loyal fans, Evanescence can still be a great band for a long time. <br />  <br /> So please, don't judge Evanescence just on Fallen...because Evanescence is so much more than that.
B00006BTCA|5.0|Let me first say that I wish Amazon would use a 10 pt scale, that way I could give this album a 9 (or 4.5/5).  I say this because the album, as the user 'A music fan' notes, isn't perfect.  Regardless, I give the album 5 stars because it deserves the error in rounding up. <br /> <br />Now, this album is unlikely to impress those who are looking for great ornamentation in their performances.  You will not hear soaring guitar solos that go way over the top of the rest of instruments, you will not hear squealing, screeching, strutting vocal performances--that brand of rock and roll is a genre apart from Interpol's.  Interpol's brand is more about putting simpler elements together into a complex whole, not the other way about. <br /> <br />Their greatest strength rests on their foundation, the drums.  On top of playing some very off-beat rhythms, the drummer fluidly transitions into different patterns.  A great example of this is on the second track, Obstacle 1.  After a build up of chorusing guitars, the drums kick in with a driving, simple beat.  Then come the lyrics, the singing starts to pull the music with fits and starts, the drums begin to echo the skewed rhythm, which by then the bass has gone over the top of the drums. Meanwhile the guitars are being used as a rhythmic rather than a melodic instrument, laying out texture rather than color--something I really like in my music.  Then the first stall: the guitar waits in a shrill holding pattern; the bass steps back; the drums reduce to a single repeated snare shot with cymbals on top of it.  The song waits.  Then, all the instruments pipe in again, like rolling over the top of a waterfall, they all flow over into a very dense soundscape: the guitar drives downhill, the drums simply roll, but not without yet another short pause, followed by more rolling, then a very spare guitar only pause, then more driving, followed by a near divine, but brief, guitar ascension.   <br /> <br />I think I'm giving you a sample ofwhat to expect from an Interpol song.  The band has a great sense of timing, playing with each other remarkably well on this album with lots of mixing up of rhythms synced perfectly.  They also manage the sound space quite well, placing each layer of sound in distinct locations; it keeps the listening experience fresh as it's easy to direct your focus on different places every time you hear the album. <br /> <br />'Turn on the Bright Lights' falls short of perfection mostly due to its lack of diversity between songs.  It's not that the songs all sound the same, but though Interpol explores their particular sound very well, they seem somewhat trapped there.  Songs like 'Say hello to the angels' and 'New' have some excursions into using pristine, clear sounds, but only brief moments of it.  'New' also adds a splash of sour notes, but only mildly so.  I'd like to see Interpol experiment and diversify their sound some, but there's time for that as the band should have a great future ahead of them. <br /> <br />In brief, Interpol is a high energy group, that plays well together and, despite their affectations, is surprisingly unpretentious in their sound.  If you buy this album, at the very, very least, you will not be disappointed.  The album does hook you from the start, but it remains a wonderful listen even after a year-plus of repeated playing; try listening with a great pair of headphones, there are many layers to enjoy. <br />
B00005JN2F|5.0|This movie was fantastic, i don't understand how people can say anything bad about this movie, except for the kind folks who decide to give an opinion without seeing the first movie.  The major complaint of the unsteady camera work was, in my opinion, a very nice touch to the movie.  It made you see whats going on as Jason Bourne sees it and it really brought the action out that much more.  The car chase is reason enough to see this movie, in one word AMAZING.  If you liked the Bourne Identity theres no way you won't like the Bourne Supremacy.
B00006879E|5.0|I decided to get this album after heering she will be loved, it sounded so fresh and diferent. and i was very pleased with the results. thiz band hav reely got tru talent wiv outstanding instrumentals AND vocals by adam levine. the stlye iz sexy , sometimes moody and slow , sometimes upbeat and funky. levines vocals are very enjoyable to listen to, he has a unique style, produces a sexy atmosphere. my fav songs apart from the singles that hav alredy cum out on the alb hav to b secret, a dark slow soulful song wich haz a hint of r&b influence. sum otherz r shiver, throo wiv you, the sun , not coming home, and sweetest goodbye with brilliant vocals and lryics. the poorest songs i wod say r must get out and sunday morning but these r still quite good. the way the band play around wiv the lyrics and melodies are wonderful. most of my cd colelction consist of either r&b rap or hip hop. i am so glad i decided to get this album, it introduced me to a whole new world of music....overall this band r amazing and truly a breath of fresh air
B000084T18|1.0|I can't believe all the hype about this compact disc. I am a 15 year old christian boy that has never sweared or listened to swearing music. But I mistakenly bought this cd and was very disapointed. Why must rappers be so mean to each other and think they're so cool? It seems that every other word is a swear word. There must be a different way to express themselves. And who is the guy with that whiny voice that brags about himself on song number 6. I've never heard that song before, but I thought it was absolutely terrible. and i've heard that is there hit single?
B000002KMV|5.0|This album is so good! All the songs are good except for the song &quot;Do Me Baby&quot; which is a very sexual ballad which is so soft and whimpy that I can't believe this comes from the same artist who wrote the songs &quot;1999&quot;, &quot;Controvery&quot;, and &quot;Dirty Mind&quot;. But other than that one song, each song rocks. &quot;Controversy&quot; is an interesting song because it has a great hook to it that get's played over and over again. Yet it does not get played so much that it seems repetitive in an annoying way. Prince rides the edge between too repetitive and being just enough diverse that chorus sounds fresh throughout the song without sounding repetitive. That is very hard to do. The song &quot;Sexuality&quot; is another good song. It has a great groove to it and has interesting lyrics. &quot;Private Joy&quot; is one of my favorites. It is a fun song with a great hook to it. &quot;Private Joy&quot; is one of Prince's best songs that never got recognition like it should have. &quot;Ronnie Talk to Russia&quot; is a short but fun song that has a very direct message to it. Which is &quot;If Reagan dose not talk to Russia, they will blow up the world.&quot; The song &quot;Let's Work&quot; is a good funky tune that you like the more you listen to it. &quot;Annie Christian&quot; has an interesting message to it and makes a powerful statement in it's own right. It's a rap-like song that has good guitar grooves behind it. So, the rap to it works because of the good background and message. The last song on the album called &quot;Jack U Off&quot; is a winner. It has a good pop hook to it that you will like. So This album is a definate must for fan's of Prince. If you don't have it, than buy it today!

B00005JKZV|4.0|The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is a worthy sequel to the outstanding The Fellowship of the Ring.  It is much darker than its predecessor in both mood and in the very coloration of the film itself.  The initial scenes as the audience falls through the inky blackness of the mines of Moria, following the epic duel between Gandalf and the inferno that is the Balrog, sets the tone for the rest of the film. <br /> <br />The Fellowship of the first film has splintered into three groups - Merry and Pippin have been captured by Uruk-hai, and are now being tracked by Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli.  Frodo and Sam are slowly edging nearer to the fires of Mount Doom in Mordor where they can destroy the terrible burden that is the ring.  In their quest they are aided by the wonderfully dichotomous character that is Gollum/Smeagol.  And The Two Towers really is Gollum's film.  He is a triumph of digital wizardry that the audience will both loathe and wish redemption for. <br /> <br />The other major computer-generated characters - Treebeard and his ilk - are perhaps not so successfully believable; although few viewers could fail to be moved by the \\"last march of the Ents\\".  The settings are simply stunning; both the natural scenery of windswept plains and craggy mountains, and the built sets, such as the Kingdom of Rohan that echoes the Viking settlements of old. <br /> <br />At the conclusion of the Battle of Helm's Deep, where (despite being a supposedly purpose-bred fighting force) the Uruk-hai are massacred by a handful of men, Gandalf prophesies that \\"the battle for Middle Earth is about to begin\\".  The audience is left to ponder what further horrors, heartbreaks and triumphs are in store for the adventurers.  <br />
B00005JN2F|2.0|'Identity' was quite good. I especially liked the fight scenes and general flow. <br />  <br /> I'm not sure if this is the same crew or not on 'Supremacy' but it's mediocre to poor quality this time around. Lots of jerky and unclear camera action.  <br />  <br /> The ostensibly 'main' fight scene with another Treadstone agent was poorly-lit, camera-jumpy, too close, and sloppy looking. A total joke compared with the coolness of the 'pen vs knife' fight in 'Identity' - which was well lit, both actors clearly visible, and with sharp believable and engaging choreography. <br />  <br /> Also, the protracted car chase in the latter part of the film almost put me to sleep. <br /> <br /> However, Jar Jar wasn't in it so maybe worth a matinee if you don't have grass growing to watch at home. Just rent 'Identity' instead. <br /> <br />
B00007E8V4|5.0|Wow, this is supposed to be a left overs album, most bands would kill to have songs like these on greatest hits albums. This album has a lot more mellower songs than Toxicity, there is a lot of acoustic guitar on this album. Daron Malakian is a genius, the guitar playing on Nu-Guns & Ego Brain blows me away. Serj is an amazing singer, he sounds amazing on Streamline. SOAD lyrics are amazing, I don't know what they mean but they sound impressive. SOAD are the saviours of music, don't steal this album...BUY IT!
B000002KO3|5.0|The opening song on the Taling Heads 'Remain In Light' (illustrated above) is pacuiliar afro-funk with absolutely no <br /> sense of melody-one quality this album definately lacks.Only the <br /> catchy &quot;Once In A Lifetime&quot; is a bona-fide single.Then there's <br /> the funk-rock of &quot;Crosseyed And Painless&quot; and (my favorite) <br /> &quot;Seen And Not Seen&quot;-try and tell me after hearing the lyrics that the song isn't just a little bit about Michael Jackson?The <br /> album loses all form after that but if your in a mood to dance <br /> to something totally off kilter or just like funk at the <br /> ABSOLUTE cutting edge this is for you!
B00023B1LC|1.0|Okay, let me start out by saying I think the Bourne Identity is a great movie. One of my favorites. Needless to say, I already owned the DVD that was previously out. Then along comes the &quot;EXPLOSIVE EXTENDED&quot; edition. Awesome! I don't ever upgrade movies when an extended version comes out later, but, I had to make an exception this time. Well, never again.  <br />  <br /> I think we can all agree that when we hear the term &quot;extended edition,&quot; that means that the movie itself is different-it's longer, has some added scenes, etc. Well, I'm afraid that's not the case here. What we get instead are an ending and beginning, (which you can tell by the quality of the film and the sound effects weren't even finished!!!!!) that add maybe a total of 5-6 minutes, and have to be accessed by selecting an icon WHILE YOU'RE WATCHING THE MOVIE!!! The movie then cuts to throw in the incomprehensible beginning scene (which may not work on all DVD players the warning said). At this point I said forget it, I'm just going to watch the theatrical version.  <br />  <br /> I have never felt so ripped off by a movie studio before. If you already have it, then by all means, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. If you don't have it, well, get it because it's a great movie and go see the sequel courtesy of the studio with a free ticket.
B000002KNY|5.0|'Fear Of Music' is a disturbing album.Not that David Byrne's scewed lyrics are any less so nor is Brain Eno's equally <br /> otherworldly production but it's the music,especially on the <br /> songs &quot;Mind&quot;,&quot;Air&quot; and &quot;Memories Can't Wait&quot; have a structure that is simply wrong-not incorrect just as if they don't belong. <br /> On the other side &quot;Paper&quot;,the melodic &quot;Heaven&quot; and the classic <br /> &quot;Life During Wartime&quot; are great pop songs.Then it all gets lost <br /> again on the final song &quot;Drugs&quot;.But on the fast-paced,roliking funk of &quot;Cities&quot;,Electric Guitar&quot; and the afrobeat of &quot;I Zimbra&quot; <br /> that the Head's future starts!So this is transitional material <br /> for David,Tina,Chris and company.A little of the past injected <br /> into the present while looking towards an uncertain future.
B0002234LS|3.0|This movie is just like The Dark Half.. If you haven't seen it yet, and would like to see and newer version of the plot then pick this movie up. <br /> <br />
B00003CXAA|5.0|Coppola & Puzo's masterful collaboration is magnificently preserved on DVD for every film fan's collection.  The Special Features are a real treat and greatly enhance the enjoyment of watching these three wonderful movies.  Although Part III is the famously the least popular of the trilogy, it still manages to captivate and enthrall...it also manages to confirm Pacino's arguable reputation as the 20th Century's finest film actor.<br /><br />When all the elements come together: director, his production team, screenplay and performances, you have film as art.  That's what this must-own collection is, truly!
B000068IEU|1.0|This film gets a lot of praise from some horror fans and I am baffled as to why. What may have worked in '72 sure doesn't shock today. The villians are unbelievable, the plot something an 8th grade film buff may conjure up, the musical score dated and inappropriate..<br /><br /> Perhaps this paved the way for other films in that it broke ground as far as portaying sadistic bloodlust and it deserves an award there. I would NEVER have seen &quot;The Hills Have Eyes&quot; ( a far better venture)had I seen this stinker first and thought Wes Craven would try for a repeat there..<br /><br /> BTW You will chuckle when you see a morning shot where the killers move their 2 kidnapped victims into their car trunk. A very dated 70's text font reads &quot;THE NEXT MORNING&quot;, yes we didn't know! Duh!

0553278398|2.0|The Foundation trilogy, written more than 50 years ago, was an amazing accomplishment in science fiction -- a construction of a galactic society of near-infinite complexity that also (as it happens) correctly anticipated the mathematization of the social sciences. <br />  <br /> This 1988 novel is chronologically (although not in publication date) the first of the Foundation series, one of two prequels that fill in the back story of the Foundation trilogy. Its main goal is to bridge the Robot and Empire novels, while Forward the Foundation explains how the Foundation came to be in the dying days of the Empire. <br />  <br /> The plot (such as it is) covers &quot;The Flight&quot; (as the Encyclopedia Galatica explains it), how Hari Seldon begins his psychohistory research and also makes a series of friends that will last the rest of his life. The Flight itself has as much plausibility as a typical 80s chase movie, with our heroes careening into yet another crisis, only to be saved (Deus ex Machina) to continue on to the next. <br />  <br /> Both prequels deal with the flesh-and-blood exploits of Seldon, the mythological figure that overshadows the trilogy. As such, they offer insights into Seldon's character not available in the later books. But since the trilogy was written more than three decades earlier, such insights are superfluous to an understanding of the basic premise of the two foundations and psychohistory. <br />  <br /> The book is somewhat more interesting as a travelogue across the various city-states of Trantor, and (like its sequel) in demonstrating the latent decline in the final days of the empire. <br />  <br /> But along with the plot, the book also suffers by projecting (needlessly) details from today into the year 12,000 G.E. This includes allegorical commentaries on late 20th century U.S. social issues that demonstrate both a political correctness and contrived intrasocietal controversy that would be implausible to continue into an advanced civilization 20 millenia hence. Equally implausible are the mention of three distinct races within the human species continuing without impact from 600 generations of intermarriage, and age milestones of birth, puberty, marriage and death that (despite presumed advances in medicine) changed less in 200 centuries than they have in the past five. <br />  <br /> The book fails badly to live up to the impact of the classic trilogy. Although it fills in some of the gaps, even for a hard-core Asimov fan (as I once was) there's nothing in it essential to understand the three core books (as 35 years of readers would attest). So it is more a curiosity, one of the final works of an incredibly prolific and influential author.
1592400876|5.0|In the tradition of other 'fun with grammar' texts, such as 'Woe is I' by Patricia O'Conner and 'Anguished English' by Richard Lederer, Lynne Truss helps bring to life the simple yet vital piece of communication -- punctuation. Weaving history of use and abuse together in a witty, oh-so-English book, Truss makes light and fun a subject of constant concern, if we would but know it. Victor Borge once had a comedy skit that immediately came to mind when I first started this book, the skit of 'audible' punctuation, in which various pops, whistles and snaps stood for the punctuation that we use in our everyday speech. Just because we don't enunciate it doesn't mean it isn't there!<br /><br />  This point is driven home from the outset -- the very title of this book derives from just such importance in locating punctuation properly. It was once said of a panda bear that it 'eats shoots and leaves' -- however, punctuating it differently, one gets the sense that it eats, then fires some kind of weapon, and then departs, rather than consuming bamboo and green, leafy things.<br /><br />  Truss has a sardonic wit, recommending with British understatement the most horrific sentences for those who abuse their sentences. Truss has little patience (but quite a lot of fun) with common mistakes of the comma, apostrophe, quotation marks, and more. She has somewhat more sympathy for people who haven't learned the fine art of the less prominent punctuation marks: colons, semicolons, brackets and such. However, given the age of such things (some punctuation marks are a thousand years old), perhaps it is about time to start getting things write, er, right.<br /><br />  This is not a long book, and is full of little pieces of wisdom -- to improve one's grammar is to improve one's life, Truss would hold. Certainly, the ability to communicate with language is a primary human quality; the ability to communicate well increases our own sense of self-worth.<br /><br />  It must be accepted that there are different styles of punctuation -- books such as 'Elements of Style' detail these in exacting form (something one will not find in this book. However, on the whole, discovering the differences can be as interesting as any other part of this book, and it will at least show that one is paying proper attention to grammar. While Truss can come across as rather picky, that is precisely the quality one wants in one's editor and teacher of admittedly picayune and pedantic subjects. Try for just one day living life without punctuation!yles of punctuation -- books such as 'Elements of Style' detail these in exacting form (something one will not find in this book.

B00009TB5G|5.0|This movie has one of the best story lines of any movie. It is so solid you will be watching it and giving complete attention till the end, and all that action helps a little too. The 2 Towers is an actionpacked movie that is easy to know what is happening at all times.

This one has more action a lot more suspense and once you start watching it you can actually be interested in the movie plus with all the excitment happening it makes for a good movie you will love watching. And as a final addition this Terminators story line is a little bit stronger than the other ones. Great Buy!

I like the fact it didn't have alot of cameos, special effects, and other crap. this movie was good on it's own. I reccomend you to see it. It's funny , oh yeah it's really funny.I hope that in the world of scent of a woman, charlie(chris o'donnel)and frank ( al pacino) are still friends.It has such a great impact on my life, as usual, I plan on seeing all of al pacino's movies and chris o'donnel.Oh how I love the sweet scent of Scent of a woman!!!!!!!

The most random things make u burst out laughing, especially the mentally challenged weatherman, who made the movie. <br />There is a scene where a dog gets kicked over a bridge, and of course animal freaks have to flip out at a joke. there was someone who wrote that it wasnt funny. It was. it was hillarious. everyone was lauging. and i was to. The dog doesnt even get hurt, because he comes back later and hes fine. animal freaks have to learn not to take things so seriously. <br /> <br />overall, this is a funny movie and you should see it.
0783229372|3.0|This &quot;red-headed step child&quot; of the disaster genre will really only appeal to fans of the formula (like myself, I confess!), conspiracy theorists or aviation history buffs.<br /><br /> Great stars are wasted in a historical fiction melodrama HEAVY on the fiction. William Atherton turns in the best performance as a Nazi resistance crew member, while everyone else hams it up admirably hoping to duplicate Shelley Winters's success in THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE.<br /><br /> The last 15 minutes, however, are spectacularly well done by director Wise, Editor and the special effects department.<br /><br /> Unfortunately, Universal missed the opportunity to include any interesting special features related to zeppelin travel, the Hindenberg catastrophe or the important, frenetic history of the time. Shame on them!

B0000CFW87|5.0|I really love this CD because of the fact that Josh Groban has such amazing vocals. When I'm really mad or just in the mood to chill out this CD has a real calming effect. You can just drift away into the sound of his voice. All the songs are amazing, and this CD makes me want to learn Latin just so I can understand what he is singing. I don't think there is a better CD out there!
B00005JM02|5.0|Finding Nemo is the best animated movie I've seen in years. Everything is excellent, from the witty script to the terrific readings by the top-notch cast to the breathtakingly beautiful animation.

B00004U2GH|5.0|The LP is a shadow of what a truly great concert this was. Here we have the rebel, Johnny Cash, at his uncensored best. The concert explodes at the beginning with Big River and I Still Miss Someone. It's entertaining to hear Cash rebel against the guards, and Grenada Television (recording the show for English television). His San Quentin gives me goosebumps every time I hear it. He truly captured the feelings of the inmates (San Quentin, I hate every inch of you), and even playes a full encore of the song.  His band and vocalists are in prime form, as they improvise around Cash.  Sometimes Cash falters, and his guitar is out of tune, but it only adds to the raw, rough edge of his style.  Perhaps the best reward is the un-bleeped version of A Boy Named Sue, one of Cash's best songs.  In all, 18 songs, including an ending medley.  10 songs on the original LP, and not near as much stage banter.  Buy this disc, it's a must.  Cash at his best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000066NW0|1.0|Several reviewers have already pointed this out, but it bears repeating: Avril has no talent. If you hear her perform live, what you get is a lot of out-of-tune shrieking. If you watch her guitar-work on stage, you will see that she's faking it: she isn't even playing the right chords. If you check out the credits, you will find that she only wrote some of the lyrics. The music was written by someone else. <br /> <br />Some of the tunes are catchy and they make good party music. But why didn't the recording company get someone who can actually sing, play, or compose? It's sad, really, because there are so many talented singers, players, and composers out there who will never get a break.
B000028U0Y|5.0|What can one say! This was a climb back from a period of okay and average albums (don't get mad at me Cash fans!). This is the prime Johnny Cash, entertaining 2000 inmates starved for entertainment, and someone that can truthfully feel for them. Thank God most of the album was released originally, but this un-edited version brings a new appriciation to the concert. The inmates hang on every word as Cash and his superb band and vocalists belt out tunes ranging from quiet songs to rebel songs to prison songs to religious songs. This would also be one of Luther Perkins's (guitar player) last recordings, as he would die in a fire that year. Cash was a definite rebel, as he pokes fun at the guards, himself, and even the record producer Bob Johnson (i.e. I can't say stuff like h*** or S***. How does that grab ya Bob?) Cash's voice cracks occasionaly, and his guitar falls out of tune.  This only adds to the rough, tough edge of the Cash sound. The album ends with Greystone Chapel, written by an inmate, and the inmates shout for more.  A must have for any true music fan!!!!!!!
0141439734|5.0|This was the first of three Victorian horror novels I read this summer.  This is a great story of how Dr. Henry Jekyll becomes obsessed with his alter ego, Edward Hyde, and continues to turn himself into Hyde.  Hyde kills people and people get angry and put a bounty on Hyde's head.  Dr. Jekyll vows not to drink his potion again, but one day his friend Gabriel Utterson and his butler Poole hear strange noises in Jekyll's study and have their suspicions who it is...
B0001MDP3G|2.0|**1/2 Based on the best-selling novel by Charles Frazier, Anthony Minghella's \\"Cold Mountain\\" is, like his earlier snooze-fest, \\"The English Patient,\\" one of those highbrow historical romances that only a Motion Picture Academy member could love.  Jude Law and Nicole Kidman play Inman and Ada, two Southerners whose budding romance is cut short when he goes off to fight in the Civil War.  Though the two \\"lovers\\" barely know one another, she spends years pining away for him, while he, eventually, deserts the battlefield in order to get back to her.  When her minister father dies unexpectedly, Ada, who has hitherto led a very sheltered life, is forced to fend for herself on the land he left her.  Eventually joining her in that endeavor is a feisty young woman named Ruby, played with a whole host of annoying, self-conscious mannerisms by the usually reliable Renee Zellweger.<br /><br />In ambiance and plot, \\"Cold Mountain\\" feels an awful lot like a warmed over \\"Gone With the Wind,\\" right down to the Southern-belle-forced-to-demean-herself-to-survive scenario.  The difference is that the two main characters in \\"Cold Mountain\\" are completely uninteresting as people and thoroughly unconvincing as lovers.  In a film in which the driving force is supposed to be obsessive passion, it's odd that the romance is laid out in such lukewarm and sketchy terms.  It's hard to believe that a young man would risk execution for treason trying to get back to a woman he barely knows - and it's even harder for the audience to work up much personal stake in the outcome.  Ada is like a magnet drawing Inman to her, but, for the life of us, we can't figure out the attraction.  Law does reasonably well as a sort of anti-hero version of Odysseus, but Kidman fails to score as a charisma-challenged Penelope - or Scarlett O'Hara, if you prefer.<br /><br />Another problem with \\"Cold Mountain\\" is that it overdoses on Southern-fried cornpone and backwater moonshine.  Every time Inman or Ada turn a corner, they seem to be confronted by yet another \\"colorful\\" Southern character - be it a fornicating preacher, a clan of promiscuous hillbillies, a fiddler-playing, ne'er-do-well daddy, or even the over-the-top Ruby herself, whose way with a folksy aphorism, after some initial appeal, eventually ends up setting the teeth on edge.  The film is a strangely schizophrenic one in that, while the lead characters are underdeveloped to the point of blandness, the secondary characters are overdrawn to the point of buffoonery.  The film, after awhile, begins to resemble the casting call for an out-of-town revival of Tennessee Williams.<br /><br />There are a few good things about \\"Cold Mountain.\\"  It doesn't shy away from some of the more brutal aspects of war and it deals head-on with the struggles the Southerners had to undergo being on the losing side.  Moreover, some of the vistas are attractive.  But, apart from a few effective moments, \\"Cold Mountain,\\" is little more than a boring, meandering, high-toned soap opera, just the kind of movie that makes Academy members sit up and take notice come nomination time (the film garnered seven nominations and one win - for Zellweger's performance).  The rest of us are more likely to just curl up and go to sleep instead.a corner, they seem to be confronted by yet another \\"colorful\\" Southern character - be it a fornicating preacher, a clan of promiscuous hillbillies, a fiddler-playing, ne'er-do-well daddy, or even the over-the-top Ruby herself, whose way with a folksy aphorism, after some initial appeal, eventually ends up setting the teeth on edge.

B00005JN2F|3.0|Paul Greengrass is a real-time cinema-verite director. His BLOODY SUNDAY is the definitive account of the Derry massacre in the Seventies. He brings that same aesthetic to the Bourne story here and for the most part you have that sense that you are right alongside what is happening. At times, you are too close: things whizz and blur past you so quickly that their impact isn't felt, or in the case where Damon strangles a former colleague, you really can't tell what's going on. None the less, Paul is an inspiring choice to keep the adrenalin flowing. <br />The essential problems with the film are that Damon simply doesn't have the same gravitas this time around. He seems almost like Arnold, and that lack of vulnerability works completely against the suspense. Brian Cox is nearly perfect as the duplicitous former boss, and Allen nearly delivers an Oscar calibre performance as the current head CIA bureau chief tracking Bourne down. This is one of her strongest roles. Julia Stiles returns as eye candy, and one wonders what is the point of her character (I have not read any of the books). Potente just isn't in the movie enough to register this time around and that's a pity. The final thirty minutes of the film seem like an unending car chase and it just never really captivates you. There is a bizarre way this ends, well actually almost ends, that is just put out there, before you get one more hint that the third film is under way. <br />It's a good night out at the flicks, but not really as compelling as the first.
B000002UUX|5.0|People will probably look to Countdown to Extinction as the high water mark for Megadeth, but they're wrong. Rust in Peace blasted onto the metal scene and blew away everybody. From the stellar opening track Holy Wars to Rust in Peace: Polaris (the two best songs on the album by the way...) this album is on full throttle. The music is the focal point of Rust in Peace and this album finds Dave Mustaine, Marty Friedman, Dave Ellifson and Nick Menza at their creative zeniths. Mustaine continues to be one of the most underrated and underappreciated metal guitar players of his time. Yeah, so the guy's got some personality issues but damn he can shred on the guitar. Overall, the stronger tracks on Rust in Peace are Lucretia, Five Magics, Holy Wars and Polaris. Dawn Patrol is the only speed bump on this album and should have been left in the can. Anyway, if you're into metal this is definitely an album you should own and if you're just getting into Megadeth then start here...it's their finest hour. Highly Recommended.
B000000OAA|4.0|This is Queen's third album, and quite a departure from their first two projects. With songs like Killer Queen and Tenement Funster, this is the first album where the group started going all-out playful and histrionic, which is one of the many great things about their legacy. <br /> <br />The songs that got little (or no) radio play that make this CD worth the money are Brighton Rock(You must hear Mercury's shifting vocals on this song!), Lap of the Gods Revisited and Lily of the Valley.  <br /> <br />About the only songs that lost me were Misfire and Bring Back that Leroy Brown. These are the only songs in Queen's early years that left me cold, but that does not detract from the greatness within the rest of the CD.  <br /> <br />Great piece of work, and Killer Queen is one of the greatest pop-hits ever written!
B00006SFLV|5.0|The N showed the final episode of My So-Called Life on Friday and it just made me mad. Not the episode itself (which was great as always) but that it was the last episode. That a show like that gets 19 episodes and some of the other garbage that is on television gets years and years. <br />  <br /> Anyway, I was one of those people who had seen a few episodes of MSCL when they re-ran them on MTV (so I guess I was a part of the problem, not watching the originals on ABC...). I remembered loving this show and I got very excited when I heard they were re-running them on some channel called The N. I had no idea what The N was since I'm in my 20's and well, I didn't know this channel existed. So they re-run the episodes and they were even better than I remembered them. <br />  <br /> Claire Danes is beyond fabulous as Angela Chase. The rest of the cast is excellent as well. The show just represents everything about being a kid in high school. It doesn't just show one side of being a high-school aged kid, it shows every side (good, bad or indifferent). Angela knows she should be good but she wants to be bad (well maybe, she's not sure and we get to see this play out episode to episode leading up to the great moment in the &quot;Resolutions&quot; episode where she says, &quot;I resolve to be less introspective&quot;...then she changes her mind on that a few minutes later.) <br />  <br /> But it isn't just Angela. Everyone else has a story too. Brian Krakow isn't just the smart kid, he's got feelings (notably for Angela) and wants everyone to know about them (although he's not entirely sure how to let everyone or Angela know). <br />  <br /> Rayanne's got her story. Yeah she's wild and has her drinking problems but she's got more to her than just that. <br />  <br /> Sharon's got her story. Yeah, she's bubbly and friendly and wants everyone to like her but she's still deeper than that. <br />  <br /> Rickie's got his story. Yes, he's gay. So what? The show deals with it forwhat it is. He says it during an episode, &quot;I wish I wasn't this way because my life would be so much easier. But I am this way and I have to deal with it.&quot; MSCL doesn't make a production of this or anything. Rickie's open about it and in fact doesn't make mention of that fact that he is gay verbally until the final episode when he is asking about it by a girl who likes him. <br />  <br /> Oh, Angela's parents. These two have to be the most realistic parents in TV history. They aren't caricatures of parents, they are real parents. Not perfect parents by any stretch. <br />  <br /> Oh and yeah Jordan Catalano. Probably my least favorite character but he drives many of the episodes because of the effect he has on Angela. So I don't really like him per se, but I like the conflicted feelings the guy gives you (and Angela). <br />  <br /> Anyway, this show is great. You should see it somehow. Whether it be the DVD's, on reruns or whatever. See this, you won't regret it. <br />  <br />
078681859X|5.0|I'm a fan of Harry Potter. While waiting for the next installment, I've read quite a few books . Most of them are sadly Tolkien or Rowling wannabe. Which means very much of the incident or characters are easily translated as the one existed in Lord of the rings & Harry Potter series. When i got the Amulet of Samarkand, I was expecting something similar. But... I was wrong. <br />  This book surprisingly have a unique way of story telling. I must say my favourite part of the story is coming from Bartimeaus perspective. I fell in love with this character from the 1st chapter. He's smart (in his own way), and at the same time funny. You can always refer to the footnotes ( really a smart way of story telling) & trust me it doesn't disturb the flow of reading. Nathaniel on the other hand, is not really a hero in this story although it seems to end that way. Not really a good boy at heart either, so don't expect him to be Frodo or Harry. Certainly, not a good example for kids. <br />  I must say, the book is really worth your time and money(if applicable). You won't get bored reading it. In fact, you might end up reading it again & again.(i'm one of them). I'm still craving for more of Bartimeaus. <br />
0679411585|4.0|General Moore did a fine job interviewing survivors and re-enacting the entire battle.  His initial chapters describe the training and the strategies behind airmobile forces.  Having already seen the movie, I expected to read more about the effect of the battle on the home life of the involved families, but the book limits itself almost entirely to the intricacies of battle.   <br />   Let me warn the readers who lack military expertise: General Moore wrote in explicit detail of the ground maneuvers.  A person who has no recollection of Vietnam's geography will need a map better than the one in the front of the book.  Additionally, plan to read in large sections at a time because reading a page or two at a time confuses the descriptions of who is supporting whose flank, who is farther west, and so on. <br />   Overall, a very interesting book with just enough human detail to portray Ia Drang as a personal experience at the same time that it was a military event.
B0001XAPX8|2.0|Ed Harris does his best performance here.  Anthony Hopkins hasn't branched out much from his past roles, so his performance to me seems typical of what you'd expect.  There are parts of this story that I simply cannot believe.  I know this movie was based on a book, but in today's society where political correctness and diversity are shoved down our throats, I find it equally hard to believe that Coleman grew up with a prim and proper black family that had zero ebonics in their speech, zero animosity toward whites and were jewish to boot.  It's just too much of a stretch for me.  It seems to me all of this was thrown together to further the believability of the story, which otherwise would not be believable.  If it weren't for me being so tired of the whole spin on race nowadays I might've enjoyed this film more.  As it is all I see is a farce that begs to be believed.
B00005JKHN|5.0|Blessedly devoid of adult humor and sexual inuendo, Sleeping Beauty pits good against evil, and good wins.  Intricate background scenery, silly fairies, and wonderful singing highlight this classic fairy tale.  Is it a realistic picture of life as a medieval princess?  Of course not.  It's not supposed to be.
038551123X|1.0|First, this isn't a debut novel. (Not that this makes a whole lot of difference. But reviewers seem to have a different set of criteria for first novels as opposed to second or third.) So it's kind of disingenuous (a lie) to pretend he's got no track record.  Lindsay published earlier work under his name Jeffrey P. Lindsay. Check it out.  <br />  <br /> I had to force myself to finish this novel.  It's silly, superficial, and cartoonish. To compare it to Thomas Harris is ridiculous. The writing is trite (several cliches on almost every page), the police procedures are full of howlers and the plot is made up of impossible coincidences and the characters are mostly caricatures without depth or believability.  <br /> <br />The voice of the narrator which seems to elicit so much praise seems adolescent and shallow. There is no true feel of Miami except for place names and generalities. All the other Florida writers capture the landscape better. Barbara Parker, Hiaasen, Randy Wayne White, James W. Hall, Edna Buchanan. Even Dave Barry's crime novels have more authenticity than this book.  <br />  <br /> Forget the hype. This is a slim, superficial ride through territory that is already well-travelled by far better writers.
B0001LJC2K|4.0|This cd is great. I first heard their song TIME IS RUNNING OUT on Virgin Radio. This music is very much so British, so if like more melodic music, you should consider this band.
0385504209|5.0|This is the first book I have read that absolutely enthralled me from the very first sentence, not just the first page or the first chapter.<br /><br />With a bullet in his stomach, the head curator of the Louvre in Paris grabs a valuable Caravaggio painting from the gallery wall to trigger off alarm bells and activate grilled security screens in the minutes before his slow death. He also has time to leave a series of coded messages behind knowing that their meaning will, or may, be decipherable to both his estranged grand-daughter Sophie (a French policewoman in the Department of Cryptology) and visiting American Harvard professor and symbologist Robert Langdon.<br /><br />Langdon is immediately taken from his hotel to the Louvre by the French Police ostensibly to offer assistance but in reality because he is their prime suspect and now ostensibly under arrest.<br /><br />The plot gathers speed as Sophie and Langdon escape from the police to begin a hunt for further clues. The story unveils mysteries of the Knights Templar, Opus Dei, the Roman Catholic Church and the Holy Grail. The tale is told of such historical giants as Boticelli, Leonardo da Vinci, Isaac Newton, Victor Hugo and Claude Debussy (to name just a few) who have over the centuries been charged with holding the secrets of Mary Magdalene and Jesus Christ's offspring and the noble lineage of Mary herself. The author explains hidden messages in Da Vinci's paintings of The Mona Lisa and The Last Supper which carry part of the same secret.<br /><br />The pace of the book is always fast and the bizarre riddles and codes are always clever and devious. The suspense of Sophie and Langdon's flight from the law of both France and England as they escape over the Channel is held throughout. And . . . it is not only the law they are running from, it is also the evil murderous long-reaching arm of Opus Dei who will kill instantly without asking questions. The thrill of the chase is ever present, the revelation of historical facts is quite astonishing and the labyrinth of codes and mysteries is spell binding.<br /><br />This book is a classic to be enjoyed by young and old.sent, the revelation of historical facts is quite astonishing and the labyrinth of codes and mysteries is spell binding.  <br />  <br />This book is a classic to be enjoyed by young and old.  <br />
6305428220|4.0|Look, for my money... this is both Williamson's coolest script and Rodriguez's coolest flick.  (Scratch -- now it's \\"Sin City\\", mod. 4/2/05.)  I say that because sitting through this precocious rehash of \\"Puppet Masters\\" and \\"The Breakfast Club\\" (along with a little bit of \\"The Thing\\") is an absolute breeze. Though not without its share of suspense-dread and red-herring scares, the movie ably demonstrates the social symptoms of overall teenage distrust through a handful of characters that should be one-note yet inject a uniquely disparate perspective of the goings-on. Those goings-on are too familiar to us by now: a parasitic alien infects leagues of human hosts with the simplicity of an airborn virus and essentially renders individuals into becoming somewhat 'optimal' zombies. Alright, if aliens chose to overpower the Earth through brain manipulation, why choose Ohio to start? Because... who the hell ever thinks about Ohio, the same ill-fated state as \\"Heathers\\"? Where this movie excels is Williamson taking the pop culture UFO phenomenon (through movies and literature) and ingesting it with the posit that, instead of attempting to be secret leaks about such subject matter, they are actually devised to divert our attention away from the seriousness of it when it actually does happen. (Much the same way Williamson approaches his post-mod horror projects.) Drawn from legitimate personal experience, though dismissed as pulp fare or daydream fantasy by anyone else. Yeah, sure, it's ludicrous, yet the possibility is undeniably intriguing. So Rodriguez comes in and smoothly milks this angle, and aptly, I might add. I always think his better films are those he does not write himself (but that still won't stop him from being the cameraman, re-recording mixer, co-producer, editor and director on this movie) and \\"The Faculty\\" is a case in point. His hyperbolic style fits right in with this type of writing, and Williamson delivers his slickest dialogue yet (see review title).One more thing (and let me know if I'm crazy, here): this has got to be one of the most violent high schools depicted on film, and of course it's only violent while the students are still human. (Although, Stokely does endure some harsh blows during the aliens' siege.) I understand it ain't gonna make the AFI 100, nor be regarded as seminal viewing by 'Cahiers du Cinema.' But it's dependable. Whether you want some laughs, some scares, some mental repairs, this is one that you won't have to feel guilty about reaching for.      P.S. Keep an eye on the ongoing undercurrent about methamphetamine.
B000286S8S|5.0|I GOT THE FIRST BOV1 WHEN IT CAME OUT. AND I WAS DISSAPOINTED THAT IT  DIDN'T HAVE ALL THE SONGS I WANTED. THE ONLY COMPLAINT I HAVE IS THE WAY THEY MIXED IT UP.

BUT HEY IT'S THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS AND IT'S ABOUT TIME.
B00000BKDS|5.0|In 1975, bassist Steve Harris founded Iron Maiden and for the next five years with a revolving door of musicians, he struggled to get a record contract for his band. That happened in 1980 with the release of the band's self-titled debut.<br /><br /> I first got into Iron Maiden because of their albums &quot;Powerslave&quot; and &quot;Somewhere in Time,&quot; so it was a bit of a throwback for me when listening to this album. It's roughly produced (and not by long-time producer Martin Birch... he would come aboard with their next album, &quot;Killers&quot;) and it's largely punk-metal influence was vastly different from the more epic future albums. Also, Bruce Dickinson was not on board yet as lead singer, so hearing Paul Di'Anno's raspy and melodic vocals was definitely alien sounding at first. However, upon further listening, I became enthralled with their debut, especially with their Thin Lizzy, Deep Purple, and Rush influences that seem to dominate on the record. If anything, it is the band's birth, and even greater records would follow.<br /><br /> The album's opener, Prowler, is a galloping rocker about prowling for women (one of the songs that would make Maiden sound sexist in their early years) at night. This one's one of the more punk influenced tracks on the disc and also one of my top favorites. The next one, Sanctuary, is a fast track that Maiden STILL plays live. My personal favorite on here is the next track, Remember Tomorrow. A gloomy, melodic song that starts off melancholy but interludes into a midpaced rocker. Paul's vocals on this track really surprised me on how good he really is and I was also enthralled by the obvious Thin Lizzy and Rush influences heard throughout the song (it also sounds vaguely like Rime of the Ancient Mariner from &quot;Powerslave&quot;). The fourth track is the ever-popular Running Free. This one's just a good ol' fashioned hard rocker with an infectious chorus; you're guaranteed to walk away from the disc and still hear &quot;I'm running free YEAH&quot; in your head afterwards. Phantom of the Opera is my second favorite and also the longest track on the disc. Galloping guitarwork and fast solos make this one a fan favorite. This is the closest to sounding like later Maiden on the entire disc. Transylvania is an instrumental piece that's awesome, and so is the next track Strange World, a gloom-and-doom ballad with Paul in top form. Charlotte the Harlot (the only song guitarist Dave Murray wrote by himself) is the first of many songs about a prostitute. The final track is the infamous title track that's heavy and tightly structured.<br /><br /> Overall, being the Iron Maiden fan that I am, this is an excellent example of classic New Wave of British Heavy Metal rock. I found myself thrown back when I first listened to it, having been thoroughly enjoying Bruce Dickinson's years (and current) in Maiden. However, I eventually did find this one to be a strong debut for them, and even if you don't like the rough-punk edge of their beginnings, at least give it a listen for curiousity's sake. Maiden's debut is a 5-star effort, and they would only get better as both time and the entrances of guitarist Adrian Smith and vocalist Bruce Dickinson would come along.hear &quot;I'm running free YEAH&quot; in your head afterwards.

0553381687|5.0|Martin takes the concept of epic fantasy to a different level.  This is a brutal and realistic novel of several noble houses competing against each other to further their own agendas.  Most of them aren't very nice and will do nearly anything to achieve their goals.  The protagonists of the tale are the members of the Stark family, who rule the Northern lands.  The Starks are far from perfect, but there is much more to admire about them than their amoral opponents, House Lannister.  The Lannisters are motivated only by power, and they will stop at nothing to win this Game of Thrones.<br /><br />While the royal houses are engaged in their struggle for power, they fail to notice that a threat is growing in the wintry wastelands to the North beyond the great Wall that protects the Kingdoms.<br /><br />Magic is scarce in this volume, but it is present behind the scenes and becomes slightly more prominent in future installments in the series.  The focus is on political intrigue, the brutality of war, and characters plotting against each other.<br /><br />This is definitely one of my favorite books.
B0001Z52RU|4.0|~The Butterfly Effect~ proves that actor Ashton Kutcher is capable of much more than just your average screw ball comedy such as ~Just Married~ and ~Dude, Where's my Car?~. Not to say that those films aren't okay for what they are, it's just that this movie delivers. It's a sure crowd pleaser. Some may have a hard time following it at first but hang out, it explains itself in due time. Do you remember the rules in 1985's ~Back to the Future~ when it comes to time travel? One false move can change everything. This movie has a field day with making those false moves and the pros and most often cons that are involved. ~The Butterfly Effect~ goes from the present to the past repeatedly. All in an effect to assure the right future. There is an alternate ending. This is the ending for the director's cut. I like the version that was released in theaters. The director's cut takes the movie a step futher, but I think the non-director's cut was more pleasing for me. I've recommended this film to many others, if you haven't seen it and you're interested.. give it a shot.
B000084T18|4.0|There's alot of 50 cent haters out there, but I don't think this album is half bad. Not as good as Power of the Dollar but still has some nice songs like P.I.M.P., In Da Club, Wanksta, ect. And if it had the Snoop Dogg remix  or P.I.M.P., then without a doubt this would be a 5 star album.
B00005JMX6|5.0|I now have a new favorite movie. All I can say is wow. I had wanted to see the movie since i saw the first preview on TV and i was not dissapointed at all. This i sone of the funniest movies of all time and if you haven't seen it yet, you are missing out. When I was watching it in the thearters I got very attached and I felt like I was right there in the movie. The only thing I did not like about this movie is when it ended. I have been antisipating the DVD relese and I am marking the days off on my calendar.
B000023VR6|5.0|Most people don't agree, but in my opinion, 2001 is better than the Chronic. F*** You has great beats, and great verses from Devin Tha Dude & Snoop Dogg, though What's The Difference and Next Episode are good too. What's The Difference is an off the hook song, just like the whole album, if you don't have this, I suggest you buy it, now!

0312263120|1.0|I enjoyed the fast pace of Davinci Code (but wouldn't necessarily recommend it because of the poor writing), however I couldn't wait for this to be over.  The novel failed to grab my attention and the ending was PAINFUL.  It didn't take a rocket scientist to figure out the final clues pages before the characters of the book did.
0767821769|5.0|I love Julia Roberts movies, so I admit I am biased.  However, this movie is so well done, and the storyline is beautiful.

The movie explores the challenges of the children to accept a new authority figure, Isabelle's search for her role in the broken family, Luke's struggles in determining his responsibilities to both his fiancee Isabelle and ex-wife Jackie, and Jackie's challenges to let a new woman into the lives of her children. <br /> <br />If you need a good cry, this is your movie!
078681859X|5.0|Nathaniel is a 12 year old magicians apprentice in an alternative London where magicians rule.  After he is humiliated in front of a group of older magicians he decides to take revenge on the man who hurt him.  To do so, he conjures the Djinn Bartimaeus to steal an artefact called the Amulet of Samarkand, something he knows that his tormentor treasures. <br /> <br />What Nathaniel doesn't know about this amulet may just kill him and  Bartimaeus if they are not careful.   The story is told in two different strands from both Nathaniel's and Bartimaeus point of View. The djinn's version is very funny to read. This is a book that easily holds you to the end of the story.  Written for children, this is a book that can be enjoyed by all readers, though you should be warned there is some death involved, and Nathaniel isn't always the nicest person. However, he's a good foil the fun that Bartimaeus brings to the story.  I'm looking forward to the next book in this series when it is published. <br /> <br />

B0001UL7RY|1.0|Avril is completely and totally fake.  She's a no talent ass-clown, and it doesn't surprise me one bit that she sells a lot of records since she's being marketed to today's youth.  She calls herself punk.  Hahahahaha.  What a joke.  Punk?  Has she heard herself?  The Ramones are punk.  The Buzzcocks?  Punk.  The Clash?  Yep, you guessed it -- punk.  Avril is a little brat who thinks the world owes her something.  Well honey, no one owes you a damn thing, and if someone did somehow, in some way, owe you something, I think it would be more along the lines of telling you the truth about how much you frickin suck!   <br /> <br />And on a side note, why do people write reviews using letters and numbers instead of whole words?  It makes you look very ignorant.
0312995423|4.0|What a fun read this was! It was such a fast-paced thriller, I was sailing through the book in no time. Although a bit predictable, I wasn't looking for a deep, serious literary subject anyway. As described in one of the reviews here, I too felt the two protagonists were a bit too perfect and unreal. But what could've been a persistently annoying bit of the book in no way diverted from the intriguing plot. <br />  <br /> Say what you want about Dan Brown - he's a great story teller. Of the three books I have read of his, I would rate them in this order, starting with the best: <br />  <br /> 1) Angels & Demons <br /> 2) Digital Fortress <br /> 3) The Da Vinci Code <br />  <br /> Right now I'm reading The Rule of Four for a book club I belong to and it doesn't hold a candle to any of the Dan Brown books I've read. I can't wait to get it over with so I can start Brown's other book, Deception Point.
B00006JSS8|5.0|This album has all the hits, arranged chronologically. Nothing new for the completist, but a perfect hits package. I bought this primarily for the 70's hits (Superstition, Living For The City, Etc), but the 60's and 80's songs are great too. The sound is excellent, the songs are outstanding. The liner notes include all of the chart positions (R&B, Pop and Adult Contemporary) for each song, which is a nice touch. In retrospect, the strength of these songs is amazing, both in quality, and in performance (chart position). An easy 5 star rating!
1400049628|5.0|If the Nostradamus quatrain that says &quot;the dead will rise from their graves&quot; makes you nervous, then you should read this book.<br /><br /> I wonder how long it took this guy to do the research for the book - he obviously knows his weapons, etc. because eveything is so extrememly detailed. The history of zombie sightings in the back is so damn interesting that he could have sold that section as a separate book.<br /><br /> My Dad did three tours in Vietnam, and he remembers coming across one of the areas mentioned in the history section; he said they purposely took the long way around the area because his entire unit was getting the creeps - they all agreed there was something unnnatural in the area...maybe it was zombies left over from the previous incident mentioned in the book, or maybe there was some solanum nearby.<br /><br /> History buffs will also recognize some of the other dates/places, such as the missing Roanoke colony, or the fort in Africa with the hundreds of skeletons.<br /><br /> Even if you've never bought into the theory of zombies before, you will think differently after reading this book. Don't let the humor label fool you - it is a very serious premise.
B000002G9S|5.0|FIRE AND WATER is Free's best studio album because it contains their three most important songs ever- the title track, &quot;Mr. Big&quot;, and the epochal &quot;All Right Now.&quot; Recommended even more strongly is their double-disc anthology, MOLTEN GOLD. Get this one.
B0001I561E|5.0|Disney's Platinum Editions are rapidly becoming a must buy not only for the Disney enthusiast, but also the general film buff. The annual release of the Disney top titles with a whole new set of extras spanning over two discs is now a real date-for-the-diary. The latest for the Platinum treatment is Aladdin - one of Disney's biggest hits of the 'Golden Era' (now sadly ended). <br />The film deserves it's fame and success. Beautifully written,designed and animated, the studio should now look back at it and see how it should be done. The songs by Ashman and Menken (with help from Tim Rice post Ashman's death)are excellent without a weak link among them. The same can be said for the vocal talent on display. Although Robin Williams' Genie has always received the most praise and attention, my personal favourites are Jonathon Freeman's witty Jafar and Gilbert Gottfried's abrasive Iago. <br />The extras, looking at the line-up, don't seem as exhaustive (and exhausting!) as Lion King or Beauty and the Beast's but there definately seems to be an emphasis of quality over quantity. The main attraction on these discs is always the never-before-heard songs. Unlike the previously mentioned films, Aladdin will not have the songs intergrated into the film. This is probably due to the fact that the main deleted song (Proud of your Boy) was originally to be sung by a character that did not survive into Aladdin's final scipt - Aladdin's mother. The reprise (Humiliate your Boy) was to be sung by Jafar which seems to point to both versions being replaced somewhat by Prince Ali and it's Jafar sung reprise. <br />A commentary by the Disney artists is always welcome and the Howard Ashman tribute should be another highlight. A lot of the extras seem to be depressingly child-friendly (hopefully this won't alienate the buffs) with the Magic Carpet Ride sounding like a carbon-copy of the poular Timon and Pumbaa Safaris available on the Lion King releases. An in-depth making of sounds wonderfulbut I for one could have lived without the pathetic padding that is the 'All New Music Video'. <br />With Bambi apparently the next for the full platinum treatment and 101 Dalmations, Jungle Book and Little Mermaid to follow (one per year and just in time for Christmas!) Disney shouldn't need to worry just yet that they are running out of decent movies to polish. I just wish they'd start making them again. In the mean time we can indulge ourselves in past glories and buy this DVD!
B0000VAFO0|2.0|What a waste, I was expcting a very entertaining and cool film judging from the trailers. I was wrong, predictable, slow paced, and, above all, BORING. Too bad.
6305388458|4.0|This movie, as with any other in the Monty Pyhton series of movies goes, is outright hysterical! It's amazing that so few actors can play multiple characters in the same movie and still play off that the production is not of its stature. The Monty Brothers are amazing actors. At the mentioning of &quot;Biggus Dickus&quot; by Pilate I almost fell from my chair laughing. Although this movie can be blasphemistic to watch if you're uber-religous, I belive it is well worth the time to watch. The side-splitting humor in all the scenes will quickly disperse all thoughts of how stupid a movie like this may seem. It is a funny play on such seriousness, and if you can laugh at it and still love this era, and its people, then you can walk away from this movie almost enlightened. I would have to recommend this movie to anyone that asked me about it, or asked for a good laugh.
6305263248|5.0|This is the best car chase movie since The French Connection.  Whenever I need a good rush I pop in this DVD and watch the great chase scenes.  Not only is it action packed, but you get to see the beautiful countryside and cities scenes thoughout France.
B000063147|5.0|This is probably the best damn metal I've ever heard.  Whenever i listen to Avenged sevenfold's songs I get chills.  So if you're looking for something to piss off your parents or just rock out to these are the cd's to buy.  I strongly recommend purchasing these cd's.  It friggin' rules!!
B00005QY5Y|5.0|Something about his voice...I luv it! First of all let me say I did not know Adams played with a country band. I bought Rock N Roll first and got hooked. Then bought Love Is Hell PT1, LUVED IT! So I moved to Gold and was dumbfounded. Gold was not the rock that bI was use to, but I listened and gave Adams a chance. I must say by the 3rd spin I was hooked. His voice is very soothing when it wants to be or loud at other times when it needs to be. ---note 2 artist---I think that you're a great artist and you should think about usng jazz or classical musicn if u want a challenge. Also if Rock N Roll is just a tribute album please don't stop with exploring what your voice can do. I think that Aams may not be realiize now,but future generations will appreciate your work. Thanks4theCDs

B000002LR6|4.0|This is a great album, don't get me wrong.  However, there is an lighthearted element starting to creep into the music here.  Which, I guess, isn't that bad in itself.  I think Al and Paul realized this, though, and responded to it with the follow-up disgrace that is Filth Pig.  They didn't want to look like they were becoming soft, or fodder for MTV.

0735619670|5.0|The original Code Complete has long been regarded by many serious software developers as a 'must have' compilation of software construction best practices. CC2 has similar breadth and depth and has been thoroughly updated to include discussion of emerging methodologies such as extreme programming and best practices such as refactoring. <br />  <br /> Steve McConnell provides a balanced, thoughtful discussion of competing opinions along with a wealth of references to additional materials covering specific topics in more detail. At the same time, McConnell has a clear voice articulating his judgment on various controversial topics. <br />  <br /> Overall, CC2 is an essential book to include in your library whether you're just starting out in your career or an old grey hair responsible for mentoring teams. In both cases, CC2 puts a mountain of software construction best practices at your fingertips. <br />
B0001MDP36|1.0|I rented and watched the movie for the first time today, and I never will again. It started off good, but all too soon it just dragged on and on to the point where I was ready to scream, &quot;Isn't it over yet?&quot;
B0000DD7LC|5.0|In my point of view, Alicia Keys is the type of artist that can never go wrong with anything she does. She can sit there and sing about a toilet if she wanted to, and she'd still make it one of the best songs you've ever heard. I mean how many people can pull off talking on the phone in a track and actually make it sound right?...No one but Alicia Keys I'll tell you that much. This Album is just proof that the sophmore jinx isn't happening here. This album is genius. &quot;Karma&quot; is a song that is completely different from anything she's done on her first album. It's rather upbeat and not what you'd expect, aswell as &quot;Heartburn.&quot; &quot;Heartburn,&quot; is one of my favorite tracks on the CD because it's just something you can really get into and gets you up and going. Now &quot;When you really love someone,&quot; is just the realist song. It talks about cold hard facts refering to what a loving relationship should be about, and the wrongs that occur during the relationships when you're just not paying attention. I think people from a lot of different perspectives can listen to Alicia Keys are relate to her, and where's she's coming from, regardless of your gender. She speaks about everyday things that go on in life, emotionally..and everyone deals with them. This Album is nothing short of Amazing, and I truly can't wait to see what she's going to give us next! Rock on Alicia!
B0001MDP3G|1.0|Boring. Boring. Boring. Read the book. Better yet listen to the book on tape, read by the author.  Therein lies the real story... <br /> <br />I think Nicole Kidman is one of the best actors today, but not in this film.
B00000DHRZ|1.0|Although it is true that The Offspring have done no recent respectable albums on par with Ixnay and their older material, there still is one semi-decent song off Americana and another off Conspiracy of One. Don't expect me to even go near Splinter though; it's too painful to even comment on. The one song off Americana I thought was interesting was Pay the Man. Sure, the band once again ripped off their own music (the drumbeat used on the sitar version of Come Out & Play nine minutes a Smash is over is recycled again in Pay the Man), but it's still worth at least one listen. As it turns out, Pay the Man was written and intended to be included on Ixnay, but it never made the cut and ended up on Americana. The only song worth listening to off Conspiracy of One is Vultures, and again, it's all because he band ripped off their own previous material. It's basically a poorman's version of Dirty Magic. Another interesting tidbit is that most of the arrangement of Vultures was written during the band's Ignition era, but was deemed too similar to Dirty Magic. I think that the best way to describe The Offspring nowadays is to call them gimmicky, because that's what they certainly are. I'm sure they didn't plan to end up this way when they started the band (in the beginning they created songs about war, death, religion, child casualties), but I suppose that's what the hand of fate has dealt them. Give Dexter and the gang about five more years, and we'll probably see them playing gigs at Disney's Magic Mountain and other theme park amphitheaters. I know I'm stoked!
0312995423|1.0|Although people have mentioned this book's errors in cryptography (namely, that an unbreakable code IS possible, easy even, with a one-time pad), I think those are more a sign of writing beyond your experience than bad writing per se. Tom Clancy can get away with technical stuff because he not only researches exhaustively, but doesn't stray beyond his area of expertise (stuff like &quot;Net Force&quot; notwithstanding). What was most disturbing to me was the large number of plot holes, most of which have been mentioned already. A few I noticed (spoilers ahead):    Hulohot passes up a shot at Becker near the cathedral because he doesn't want witnesses. But that didn't stop him from taking numerous potshots in the airport terminal, and the freeway, earlier. This is in addition to the fact that he uses a silencer on a revolver, which is not done (at least not by a trained asassin).    Tankado poses as his own collaborator with an anonymous remailer, and although they suspected him of this and could easily have checked it out, this was never done.    Why doesn't Susan immediately suspect that Greg was murdered? The only way for him to commit suicide would have been to slip his bonds, steal Strathmore's gun (WITHOUT alerting Strathmore), and punch out a suicide note before heading back to the SAME room he was tied up in.     If the Da Vinci Code is anything like this, I can't see what all the hype is about.
B000003TA4|1.0|There's been so much better music that has come into the world since Nirvana that any of the band's &quot;contributions&quot; they made to Rock don't matter an ounce. Hmmm... &quot;ounce&quot;. That should be one word that Kurt Cobain should immediately recognize since he was a ravenous junkie who lied to his fans, family, and friends about his heroin addiction. I still can't stand it when I hear people continue to speak of death conspiracies surrounding Cobain. Kurt Cobain was suicidal, plain and simple. His drug addiction compounded those suicidal feelings a hundred times over. Even the doctor who pumped his stomach in Rome after one of his near-fatal suicide attempts could tell he was a flight risk, and even worse: at risk of endangering himself-- that's why Kurt wasn't allowed to have windows in his hospital room. Yep, you heard right: a medical doctor who wasn't even familiar with Kurt's previous history of mental illness and suicide attempts could tell Kurt was suicidal. Read the full article (straight from the doctor's mouth) here: [...] As for Nevermind... well who cares?! The album wasn't relevent then and isn't now. It never made sense, Kurt never made sense, and grunge isn't worth the vinyl it was pressed on.
B000286S8S|4.0|It's true most anyone could pick another song or two to be included, but for the most part, this IS the best of &quot;Van Halen&quot;, and it really improves on the last collection. It's nice to see some albums get four selections on here and not just one. Another big plus, the new songs are really good, I mean I really like &quot;It's About Time&quot; and &quot;Up For Breakfast&quot;, both are welcome additions. My only complaints, or questions actually, why wasn't disc 1 all &quot;Dave&quot;, and disc 2 all &quot;Sammy&quot;? Also, if they want to mix up all the tracks, why are the new songs and live tracks bunched together (Amazon's track listing is incorrect)? Mix 'em up! Anyway, any random or shuffle button will fix that. It is short on photos too, but there's a decent band history to make up for that, plus 25 years of top notch rock. Even though these songs are gettin' old, they sure do sound good &quot;Right Now&quot;.
B00003CXCT|4.0|I will be buying this set on Sep 21.Yes it would be nice if we could  have both versions of the film,but this is George Lucas and he will do what ever he wants,I just learnt he has gone back and done more changes,including changing the ghost scene at the end of Return of the Jedi,I heard he replaced the orginal actor who played Anakin with Hayden Christensen YIKES!!!! Why? I dont think George will ever be satisfied with what he's got? It's a good thing I havent thrown out all my old Star Wars videos and Laserdiscs.Lets hope he leaves American Graffiti alone,I can see it now lets replace Harrison Fords car with the Millennium Falcon! Well any way I will be buying this set and putting it with my old Star Wars tapes and Laserdiscs.I hope there is a preview of Episode III on this set?
B00005JN2F|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this movie. It is the best action movie I've seen this year. It is so much more realistic than any bond or XXX movie out there. I was on the edge of my seat throughout the movie -  there was never a dull moment - very exciting. As to the comments about the shaky camera work -  well it works VERY WELL - it is NOT cheap and you don't even notice it (not unless you're a nit pick - sorry, I had to put my two cents in). Anyways, it was the best nine dollars I've spent on a movie this year - well worth it.
0061020710|4.0|An oft-quoted statistic claims that 10% of all the novels sold in England are fantasy, and 10% of them are written by Terry Pratchett, thus making Pratchett the author of 1% of all the novels sold in Britain.  It doesn't matter of this is accurate and up-to-date, what is true is that Terry Pratchett and his DiscWorld novels are a major phenomenon in the UK and they are popular among American readers as well for their satirical wit, amusing reversals of old clichs, and hilarious characters.   <br /> <br />As the first in a long series, COLOR OF MAGIC pales next to some of the other novels (especially MORT) because the story devotes itself to exposition of the fabulous world in which these stories take place; the plotline wanders so as to take us to as many different parts of the world as possible.  We also make our first acquaintance with characters such as Rincewind, a second-rate wizard, an underachiever some of us might identify with more than a whiz-kid like Harry Potter.  The most unforgettable character here, no doubt, is the suitcase that walks around on its own legs - watch out, it bites, too.   <br /> <br />The DiscWorld's laws and geography are not consistent, since as Pratchett says, one cannot really map a sense of humor.  (That hasn't stopped someone from publishing a concurrence, but I'm sure it's all in fun.)  This is a wildly imaginative, intelligent, and hilarious introduction to a long, wonderful series of stories; the kind of reading that is great fun for adults and bright younger readers alike. <br />
B0001Z52RU|5.0|This review is for the 'Director's Cut'.<br /><br /> I admit I hate 'That 70s Show' but I like Ashton Kutcher. This film was surprisingly intricate and detailed. If you enjoy time travel flicks, you'll love this. It may seem like a new take on the subject to some, but if you watch alot of Sci-Fi you'll see aspects of 'The Outer Limits' episode 'A Stitch in Time' and The Next Generation's 'All Good Things' episode. Not to say it's ripping anything off, it's just similar in it's usage. There's really no special effects, just a good story with heart. Ignore the reviews that say some shocking scenes are gratuitous, the scenes need to be for the resolution of the story. Actually, some scenes that could have been hard to watch were not shown. You do have to pay attention and don't miss a frame. Everything does get tied up at the end, which I like. If you like Sci-Fi, ignore the bad reviews based just on whether the reviewer likes Ashton or not and see this. You won't get 'Punk'd'!
B00008PX8P|5.0|i just watched it and i just cant get it out of my head,all of it is just so mind blowing.great job jimmy!!!my only problem is that its not enough.i want more!!!!!i beleive there was some more songs from earls court and from knebwerth.please put more out jimmy!!!please!!!!!!!!

0312995423|2.0|This was Dan Brown's first novel, so it wasn't as good as his other novels, but it was still pretty good. There wasn't that much adventure in it and it wasn't thrilling as some of his other books. Just like his other books, it has a lot of thrills, lot of plot twists, a lot of backstory behind the characters, many factual inaccuracies, and an ending that is completely shocking. The characters dont go through that much adventure though. Also, the situations aren't as thrilling as they are in his other books. <br />  <br /> The plot take place with two people in there places and their stories run parallel to each other. The first is at TRANSLATR, where Susan Fletcher is a programmer for TRANSLATR and is trying to keep Digital Fortress a secret. The second plot is with David Becker, Susan's fiance, who has to get a ring that holds the pass key. His search turns into a comedy of errors to find the ring.  <br />  <br /> Overall, it is somewhat thrilling, but it gets annoying because you just want to say to David &quot;Just find it already&quot; and say to Susan &quot;Just tell them about Digital Fortress&quot;. In other words, there is not much that the character accomplished and they didn't do that much in this novel. Compared with his other novels, this is the worst one.
B00005NTN5|5.0|This movie, a mix of murder and money, as two women (Jennifer Tilly and Gina Gershon) set out to &quot;ripoff&quot; [there's an old word for you] the Mob. Along the way, they enter into a &quot;hot&quot; relationship; though more brief than I thought. [When you see the looks they give each other at the beginning, you know some- <br /> thing's gonna be up.] With Joe Pantoliano (Joey Pants, as some call him, of the Handler and soon Dr. Vegas) and Christopher Meloni (Stabler of Law and Order SVU) as one mean Mafia dude, there is enough suspense to make one wonder if the gals are going to get away with it. Tilly and Gershon are &quot;hot&quot;, Tilly as the soft, sexy voiced, cutesy one and Gershon as snarly lipped, butch, one; with tatoos. As I said, there &quot;love&quot; scenes are limited, but they are extremely erotic. Not for the kids.

B000001GBJ|5.0|I must say I have been blown away by this CD.  Not only are the melodies soft, soothing and nostalgic, but it is a must use for figure skaters and gymnasts for a performance.  I used the title track for a performance and it left a great impression on the judges, audience and other gymnasts.  THe figure skater Carolina Kostner has also used this for her performance at the 2004 World Championships.  This CD has combined the violin and the piano in ways that it just tugs at the heart.  I would recommend this and any other Secret Garden Cd to anyone.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|To begin with, if one is to enjoy this film, one has to suspend disbelief, as the plot turns upon the ability to relive one's past and change it. This is a film that will appeal to those who enjoy seeing films or reading books that thematically deal with alternate realities or time travel.<br /><br />  The butterfly effects refers to the chaos theory in physics. The bottom line is that every action has a reaction, often one that is seemingly unpredictable. That is probably the keyword to describe this compelling and intense film that is filled with complex relationships. Evan Treborn (Ashton Kutcher), a college student interested in psychology, discovers for himself just how unpredictable life can be, when he finds a way to go back into his troubled past to try to right what went wrong with him and his three childhood friends, Lenny, Kayleigh, and her twin brother, Tommy. Unfortunately, the best intentions often go awry. Despite traveling back a numer of times into his past, each alternate reality has its own nightmarish permutations.<br /><br />  This is an inventive, creative, well-done film with excellent performances by the entire cast. While Ashton Kutcher gives a fine, sensitive performance as the angst ridden Evan Treborn, he is, however, outshone by the two child actors who play the role of Evan Treborn as a seven year old (Logan Lerman) and as a thirteen year old (John Patrick Amedori). In fact, three talented sets of actors play the roles of Evan and his three childhood friends at ages seven, thirteen, and as young adults.<br /><br />Melora Walters gives a well-nuanced performance as Andrea Treborn, Evan's mother. Amy Smart gives a wonderful performance as the adult Kayleigh Miller, a very special childhood friend and the love of Evan's life, who acts as the catalyst for his entry into the wacky world of alternate realities. Jesse James gives a riveting performance as the thirteen years old Tommy Miller, Kayleigh's psychotic twin brother. Look for Eric Stoltz in the small, pivotal role of Mr. Miller, Kayleigh's father, whose fresh faced looks belie a man steeped in perversion and cruelty.<br /><br />  Writers-directors Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber provide a fresh and inventive script with labyrinthine twists and turns that, coupled with deft direction, give rise to a compelling, mind bending film that will keep the viewer riveted to the screen. This is definitely a film that one will want to view more than once, as the DVD provides both the director's cut and the theatrical release and is packed with many extras.

630521610X|5.0|We saw Wes Craven's SCREAM the day it came out because it was filmed close to here in a little town about an hour north of San Francisco, and we had followed the controversy in the Chronicle as high school after suburban high school reneged on giving Craven & Company permission to film at their location once they had gotten a look at the script.<br /><br />Apparently some school boards had agreed, thinking it was going to be another cute teen comedy a la SIXTEEN CANDLES, this time with America's sweetheart Drew Barrymore.  Wll, Craven and his screenwriter Kevin Williamson pulled a similar truck on world moviegoers who came to see this film expecting nothing and instead experienced an unusally intelligent, even chic blend of comedy, horror and the self-aware postmodern, with fine performances from everyone involved (OK, except for Skeet Ulrich).<br /><br />After the first showing, we never looked back, and we spread the word that Craven had made a fantastic comeback after a few stinkers and disappointments.  Since then, he hasn't looked back, except for that wretched Meryl Streep picture which I suppose he had to get out of his system and at least Madonna quit.  Oh well, SCREAM remains a modern classic.
B00005JN2F|5.0|Stop blasting this movie because it is the only action movie I feel, is worth watching, what are u gonna compare it 2, Triple X, Ha, garbage. This movie is brilliant and acted out with brilliance. As for the shaky camera, not only did it add realism, but it gave the viewers such an adreneline rush, I coudnt breath. The director himself holds the camera, so it's very realistic in fact. Watch the first movie and then the second, both are extremely well done. Everybody calls this the best action movie of recent years, I think the best ones ever. Matrix - Sucks, Spiderman 2 (even though it's very, very good), compared to this, boring, Harry Potter, don't get me started, trash. Please.
B000062YB1|5.0|Slayer ripp some serious ass in this one.Not as fast or really <br />even has heavy as it's predessecors-Reign in blood,Hell Awaits <br />but next to God Hates Us All this is probably Slayers best offering.Expendable Youth,Dead Skin Mask,Seasons In The Abyss, <br />and Skeletons Of Society are more metal oriented with slow technical paced riffs and solo's.Then we move on to the fast <br />stuff-Temptation,War Ensemble,Spirit In Black and the rest are <br />all the classic Slayer sound with the awesome breakdowns.Kerry <br />King and Jeff Hanneman create some great riffs and ripp out some <br />great solo's,Tom Araya screams his anti government and anti- <br />organized religion lyrics with a sick chant and sometimes frightning growl.Now this band is not like Deicide they don't down god for the sake of doing it alot of the stuff they say <br />makes sense in a sick way.Then Dave Lombardo he;s a good drummer <br />but Paul Bostophoph was way better and fit the band alot better <br />but Lombardo still hit's some good drumlines.If your a Slayer <br />fan and you don't own this your a fag if you like anything ranging from Lamb Of God,Chimaira,Pantera,Old Metallica,Anthrax, <br />Cannibal Corpse,e.t.c pick this up or your blood will forever <br />rain.
B00005JN2F|3.0|I absolutely enjoyed the Bourne Identity and was looking forward to Supremacy, how-ever , the movie looks like it was shot completely using hand-held cameras; the amount of shake is extremely distracting, making it hard to watch this movie. <br /> <br />My eyes were sore 30 minutes into the picture from trying to focus on what was going on. <br /> <br />I hope the producers don't use the same cinematographer on the 3rd Bourne story the Bourne Ultimatum. <br />
B00013F38K|5.0|I was 13 years old when this show first came on the air. I loved it from the first episode, and made sure to see it every week. Sure, as a kid I liked the fight scenes, but the philosophy really spoke to me too. The line &quot;I seek not to know all the answers, but to understand the questions&quot; stayed with me through all those years. <br />  <br /> I had not seen the show since the first airings. Then I received this dvd as a gift from my brother who remembered how much I used to love watching it. What a wonderful gift. I enjoyed seeing it again, probably even more than the first time. It looks beautiful, like it could have been filmed last week. The lessons are still compelling. I have not been able to live up to all the ideals in the show, but you could do a lot worse than use them for a foundation in your life. Kids these days may not be as interested to see this as I was...but they need it now more than ever. So do adults. I would highly recommend this to anyone.
B00002E224|5.0|i have to admit i did not watch this in 1995 !!.      But i did see this and the sequel \\"before sunset\\" and it truely is magical as one reviewer mentioned!      The dialogue delivery is great... they make great sense and make you think deep about your own life and relationships!         I highly recommend this movie to one and all!
B00005JNA2|4.0|This has been the long-awaited sequel, that most of us didn't know that we were getting! I have some personal experience in this films subject, I experienced it at the young age of 18, traveling from Washington to California. It's amazing how romantic meeting someone on a train can be, laying in their lap, while they watch you sleep.<br /><br /> Jesse and Celine met 9 years ago on a train in Europe. They meet again while Jesse is on a book tour in Paris, where she lives. It feels similiar to the first movie in style, as Jesse and Celine walk through Paris, once again verbally connected and experiencing no awkward silences. Though, this long conversation takes a different turn...<br /><br /> You get to find out things that you weren't sure about in the first movie: about their one night together and whether or not they showed up at the train station like they promised. You also find out that Celine has a boyfriend, but Jesse is married with a four year old boy. Obviously, that shapes the way the story will end.<br /><br /> As much as I loved the first movie, I realized that I didn't like the characters that much. In this one, I thought the characters were great. I realize how perfect it was. In their 20's, they were annoying, trying to impress each other with their knowledge and deep thoughts. They came to a more honest place in their early thirties, which made the characters more likeable. (Not that the characters have to be likeable in order for the movie to be great, obviously.)<br /><br /> Some have complained of the ending, and yes it was abrupt and sudden, but you can reach your own conclusion, even though it is obvious.<br /><br /> The director says in an LA Times article that he &quot;dreams of making a third one.&quot; If he did, I would definitely go see it. But, would I be satisfied if he never made a third? Yes, I think I would. It's something to dream and hope for, and if it comes true, it would be wonderful.<br /><br /> Just please don't make us wait another nine years!don't make us wait another nine years!
B00004WLXZ|5.0|This is the most skillfully done propaganda previous to Michael Moore's Farenheit 911.

1573229725|3.0|I must tell you there were few times I was ready to put this book away not continue. But I kept reading and the more I read it, the more my opinion about this book changed. I have to say, I loved the plot, it was very original and kept me guessing what's ahead. I liked how carefully characters were drawn... but I hated the language the book was written in. Yes, I realize that  given the time line of the story it was appropriate but it made my reading slow and difficult.<br /><br />You will probably like this book but will never read it again.
B00005JLKB|5.0|The beginning of one of the best stories you would ever heard. Superman & Lex Luthor.<br /><br /> Smallville is the name of the town that start it all. The place where the Kents found Clark, or rather Clark find them. Where the Kents-Luthors connection start. Where Clark discovered his capabilities.<br /><br /> And most of all where Clark and Lex knows each other.<br /><br /> Where it all begins...The friendship that legends really made of.<br /><br /> I love the Superman series ever since I was a kid, not exactly for Superman, but over Lex Luthor, the character that astound and bewildered me. Smallville happens to have him and the best part of it, my most favorite actor, Michael Rosenbaum, is playing Lex Luthor. So naturally, I am having a system overload over this series. Michael Rosenbaum has done Lex Luthor splendid in Smallville. Credit hasn't done him justice. So I'm putting him up there with the best.<br /><br /> Smallville Season One is a grabber for anybody who love the Superman Saga, cause it is uncomplete without it. And no, Superman saga started it all not the Roswell series, so this isn't a &quot;copy&quot; out of the Roswell series, since we all know how the Superman Saga start.
0393312836|5.0|Anthony Burgess has committed a great act of selfishness, which has in turn become a masterpeice. There is no box for Anthony Burgess. <br /> <br />Burgess has taken the English language and made it his own. In difference from other authors, Burgess has used English as a basis, rather than a guideline, to create a new art. Using his own words and style, he has become something special that is deserving of praise. <br /> <br />The Novel Itself. All in all, A Clockwork Orange is an amazing work. The story of a troubled nadsat (teenager) who is caught in the act and sentenced to punishment. Yet, Alex (the main character) gets more than he ever bargained for. He is subjected to a new form of correction used by the government only to be released to a changed world that rejects him real skorry (quickly). Alex soon finds himself back he began (in a sense, that is), only to be enlightened by part of his beginning. The story proves to be very circular, yet un-repetitive in a very masterful way. <br /> <br />Philosophy. Burgess quietly challenges the world within his story. Is it fair to force someone to do the right thing, rather than to let them choose? Which is better: a world of forced good or a world of independence? You'll see both the author, protagonist, and main other characters challenge these questions. <br /> <br />The Human Brain AND A Clockwork Orange. Due to Burgess wonderfully unique style of writing, this novel allows the reader to tap into him- or herself. As Burgess uses many of his new, invented words (such as: veck, droog, itty, viddy, etc.) we can see ourselves becoming accustomed to them and understanding what they mean. It excites the brain on the thought that we are learning a new language, and thus brings back childhood illusions. Burgess knows precisely how to use his new words and when an explanation is needed. Remarkable. <br /> <br />A Clockwork Orange should be read by all intellectuals at one point or another. It does not take long, but we mustread it with an open mind realizing that we will have to do some thinking ourselves, as well as some accepting. Make sure (if you're planning on reading A Clockwork Orange) that you have the original British version that includes a Seventh Chapter in the last section of the book. Originally, when this book was brought to America, the last chapter was omitted (also was it omitted in the film adaptation of the book). The Norton Paperback Edition includes this last chapter.
B00000AOUD|5.0|There are not many bands that could put out an album length song and get away with it. I know Tull came under immense pressure for Thick as a Brick, but the final result is one of the best Tull albums recorded. Thick as a Brick is a very upbeat song/album and with mulitple time changes and master musicianship, the album never gets dull, or boring. If you have only heard the chopped up versions available on best of CD's then you have to do yourself a favor and buy this album to hear Thick as a Brick in it's complete form. One of the best things about Jethro Tull, is that they constantly push and try new things, whether it's album length tunes like Thick as a Brick or Passion Play, of whether it's trying out new sounds like 80's Tull with Under Wraps. Thick as a Brick is a must have for any rock fan.

0060922583|2.0|Talbot's book claims to be the revelation of a new scientific theory about how the universe works. But this is really not science at all; maybe it's a precursor to the science, but just as likely, it's the highly-inflated aftermath of a night of unusually good weed, captured and edited into publishibility before it could waft skyward, as weed was meant to. This is Talbot's real legacy to the literature of the paranormal. How did he do it? Why can't I do it? I've got to *try*...
B000002UY5|4.0|Blind Melons first CD.  But in my opinion not the best.  I bought it and I deffinetly suggest that you too buy it if you like any of blind melons work.  I mean no rain is one of the best songs ever and this Cd's got it.  Buy this one but first buy soup, in my opinion soup is the best blind mellon cd, this one aint bad though.
B000294SFW|5.0|Why is it as other metal bands grow older, their music gets worse? It happened to Megadeth, it happened to Pantera, and the poster child for this syndrome is Metallica. None of that makes sense when you look at Motorhead. Since the mid 90's they've only gotten progressively better. Lemmy's nearly 58 years old now and contrary to normal convention he still stomps louder, heavier and stronger than just about anyone else on the scene. He is the icon of the genre, defining that metal is more than mere posturing. Metal is a way of life and the blood in his veins (give or take a lot of other things in his veins over the years). <br />  <br /> Inferno is the bands latest effort and it definitely doesn't disappoint. &quot;Terminal Show&quot; is another fast paced stomper in the tradition of so many other great Motorhead classics. &quot;Killers&quot; is another mean and evil battle cry the like only Lemmy could pull of without it sounding trite or dishonest. The other interesting standout track is &quot;Whorehouse Blues&quot; which is an autobiographical acoustic blues piece that's darned tasty and shows that Lemmy can do the blues every bit as well as rockin' raunchy metal. There really isn't a bad track on the whole album. This is essential for long time fans and new fans alike. I've probably played this disc from beginning to end 20 times since it came out, and I'll be playing it for a long time to come! Lemmy is God, no doubt about it.
B0001UL7RY|3.0|OK, first of all for you whiners out there: <br /> - So she wears a tie? What the f*ck do you care? <br /> - So her music's not &quot;punk&quot; like the sex pistols? So? <br /> - So she's not &quot;The Cure&quot;? The Cure has, still does and always will SUCK big time! So does Radiohead and so does Nirvana. Talk about depressing music. Dude, those are THE bands! <br /> - Yeah, she also doesn't sound like Slayer and Opeth. <br /> - Oh yeah, I also don't care who she hates and how she compares to her &quot;enemies&quot;. <br />  <br /> That being said... Let's forget about Avril &quot;the person&quot; and review the music, shall we? <br />  <br /> Yep, the songs here are of lesser quality than &quot;Let Go&quot;. There are no songs of the same caliber of say &quot;I'm With You&quot;, which was a great ballad with a good arrangement. <br />  <br /> I find the topics and way of writing is more &quot;highschool&quot; than the last album. It's definitely NOT a more mature album. <br />  <br /> Still overall the music has a good vibe and it's still a pleasant album to listen to. <br />  <br /> Avril needs to dump the writers she worked with on this album and get back together with the guys from her previous effort. They did her a lot more favours musicwise. <br />  <br /> I picked it up cheap for 8$ in Thailand. I wouldn't recommend spending the full price on this one. Download, buy the single or better yet... Just buy &quot;Let Go&quot; if you like Avril. <br />  <br /> She does have a good voice and she does have attitude. I'd just like to see her lose the bubblegum, hire better songwriters and record a &quot;real&quot; rock album. I know she could pull it off and it would get her much more credibility.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|Instant Love..... The PERFECT movie for a rainy day!!! I've found a new favorite.
B000062Y98|5.0|This is the first album I ever purchased by this band, and I have to say that I was not expecting anything close to how amazing this album is. I never have heard music that looked like it took as much effor as this album seemed to. I have only recently gotten into this kind've of music. I new of the band Iced Earth for about a year and I thought that they were just a regular heavy metal band just with a good vocalist. It was not until two weeks ago that I checked out related bands that I found out about the category of Power Metal. This band is great for all of you out there who are just sick of the untalented crap that we seem to get in America. This is a great change and it may be because I am kind've knew to this kind've music but I found this CD to be the most original album ever made. <br />   <br />  Now onto the good stuff. This album has some amazing songs on it, in fact the only thing this album seems to be missing is at least one bad song that most albums seem to have. The best son on the album is And Then There Was Silence. This song is 14 minutes long but it feels like it is only three, because you get so absorbed into it that the length does not even get to you!. I am one of those people that hate songs that go on really long because they usaully follow a strict pattern and get old eventually. This song does not do that. They only use the chorus three times in the entire song, the lyrics are amazing and it has many sections where the tone and style of the song changes. It is also one of the most emotional and intense songs I have ever heard. <br />   <br />  Another really good song is the one titled Precious Jerusalem. This song is almost as good as the previous song mentioned above. It has some very cool fast momments and it has a slightly diffrent style from the rest of the album. <br />   <br />  The thid best song is Battlefield because this one has a lot of the choir that seems to stand out in Blind Guardians music. But I can't go and say everything about this album because I would run out of room and the reader would get bored. Just know that this is the best album ever made and only people that love bands like Blink 182, Sugercult, OR talentless heavy metal bands like Slipknot and Motorhead, will not like this. But if you like your music to have great talent with songwriting and vocals then this is the band for you. NUFF SAID.
B000001FDK|5.0|I don't remember liking the movie that much and hardly remember it, but you can't go wrong with the soundtrack.  This is so very easy to listen to and never boring.  A must for those into soundtracks and for Olivia Newton-John fans.  I never thought of John Travolta as a singer, but he does a more than passable job here.
B00003CWPL|5.0|I don't know why this movie is so impossible to track down...  It is a surrealist masterpiece!  Things like this shouldn't be so hard to get ahold of!   <br />Maybe Amazon will start carrying the Korean version sometime.  If you're looking for Eraserhead, I'd recommend checking Ebay for the aforementioned Korean version.  Most are formatted for all regions, and the Korean subtitles are removeable anyways.  It's a bit of work to track it down, but definetly worth it.
1594200106|5.0|As a lover of books, Carlos Ruiz Zafon's description of a Cemetery of Forgotten Books at the start of his compelling novel, 'The Shadow of the Wind', was guaranteed to draw me in. This is no false lure however, but the enticing start of a story that will keep you turning the pages whilst at the same time not wanting the tale to end. The story begins in Barcelona in the year 1945 when a bookseller takes his son, Daniel Sempere, to visit this mysterious labyrinthine library. Each visitor must adopt a book, ensuring that it will never be forgotten and Daniel chooses 'The Shadow of the Wind' a novel by Julian Carax. Captivated by the book, Daniel tries to find out more about its mysterious author and read his other novels. It is in his search for the author and his books that Daniel, meeting a sadistic police inspector and a shadowy masked man intent on tracking down and burning every book written by Carax, is led onto a path that will change his life forever. Zafon's novel, through Lucia Graves' masterful translation, builds into a mesmerising tale of intrigue, passion, murder and gothic suspense, making explicit the power of literature to touch and change our lives, and reminding the reader of why we embark on these literary journeys through books.
B00001U0E1|5.0|This is the sort of movie you can watch ten times and still notice new things to think about and laugh at.  At the heart of it is a passionate love affair between Will Shakespeare, struggling as a playwright when the movie begins, and Viola, a wealthy young lady whose dream is to be an actor, although women were not permitted to star on the stage at the time. <br /> <br />Surrounding this love, which is as dramatic and hyperbolic as any found in Shakespeare's plays, are rousing sword fights, witty bantering, and plenty of tongue-in-cheek humor.  The cast of actors could not have been better chosen.  There's a bumbling Geoffrey Rush as a theater manager, and a cool and unruffled Rupert Everett as Marlowe; there's Judi Dench as the acerbic and worldly wise Queen Elizabeth, and Colin Firth as Lord Wessex, the arrogant boor who is betrothed to Viola.  Ben Affleck also manages to shine here in a small role as a prima donna of the stage, an actor who thinks he deserves only the title roles (and grumbles when he merely gets the part of Mercutio in Shakespeare's latest play...) <br /> <br />The climactic scene is amazing and incredibly moving, and it's wonderful to get a glimpse at theater work behind the scenes.  I don't have enough praise for this movie.
078681859X|5.0|I loved this book. It was funny, interesting, irreverent, and a page turner. It is a wonderful, sarcastic, interesting story. It is not supposed to be a Harry Potter and does not take itself that seriously. Although I love Potter, this book has a Princess Bride element to it that is highly engaging. I love the djinni - this guy has a wry sense of humor and a love for the absurd. I highly recommend this book!
B0001KL3SW|5.0|I first came across Amy Winehouse in London where she was having a concert in the basement of a restaurant where we were trying to have some food but eventually left because of all the noise... What a mistake! It took me 4 months to check out her music, and now it is one of my most highly treasured records! <br /> <br />Her genre is difficult to classify, a good mix between jazz, r&b & soul as commented above, some tracks more dedicated to one style than the other. She is in perfect control of her powerful voice, and from one track to the other it is difficult to believe it is the same girl singing! <br /> <br />Also worth commenting on is her lyrics which I find strikingly smart, well composed and work in perfect harmony with the melodies... <br /> <br />This record is a must for anyone looking for a fresh breeze within modern jazz... And for everyone else appreciating good music!
B00003CXI1|2.0|There is really NO way to describe how excited I was when I heard that this movie was going to be coming out. I had read the books, and became an immediate fanatic... I was one of the people that piled into theatres the first day that it came out on the big screen. <br /> <br />Let me start with the good things:  <br /> <br />1. I loved the sets. Hogwarts was great (love castles) and Diagon Alley's shops looked so interesting that I wanted to pop into one. <br /> <br />2. Maggie Smtih (Professor McGonagal) was magnificent. When I had read the books, I pictured the professor to be rather large and frequently huff and puff down the hallways, but Smith's take on it was great. Completely bashed the other idea out of the water. <br /> <br />3. Alan Rickman was great as Snape. Perfect voice- and I loved the contrast of the black hair and clothes against the dead white skin. Scared the heck out of me. <br /> <br />4. The music to this movie was awesome. Seriously awesome. When the movie started with the theme music, I was on the edge of my seat... <br /> <br />And it all went downhill from there. <br /> <br />Like I said, there are a few bits of great acting, but the rest of the time... <br /> <br />Harry Potter, for instance. Daniel Radcliffe looks like him- REALLY looks like him. That's the good part. But he NEVER shows any sort of emotion, and that's what got me. He never made me believe that he was really Harry Potter.  <br /> <br />Ron Weasley... Rupert Grint looked like him, and he was even funny sometimes. He didn't really get a lot of times in the spotlight, though, so you never really noticed that he was there. <br /> <br />Hermione Granger was one of the biggest let-downs of them all. She was my favorite character in the books, because, even though she was sort of a scholarly snob, you eventually liked her even with her faults. Emma Watson played the character as snobby in the beginning at least KIND of well, and then when she, Harry, and Ron became friends, thatentire side of her personality went away and she ceased being smart and ended up being one of the sidekicks. <br /> <br />And what about the special effects? Fluffy looked fake... and so did Quidditch. I don't know if there's a way that you COULD make a three-headed dog or people flying around on broomsticks look real, but I think that they could have done a LOT better. <br /> <br />All in all, I loved the sets. Loved the costumes... and a few of the actors were okay. But overall, the movie was a disappointment.
B00005MP58|4.0|This adaptation of Pride and Prejudice is well-made and has an exceptional cast.  Each actor fit wonderfully with the assigned role, and even though some of the performances got a little too over the top at times (I'm referring to Mrs. Bennet and Mr. Collins), they still elicited a lot of chuckles.  The most inspired casting choice was Colin Firth as Darcy.  I think this is the best he's ever looked in any movie, and no one does smoldering hauteur better than he does; it gets to be that one eagerly awaits the moment when he'll next appear on the screen. <br /> <br />There are some minor points that detracted from the movie.  The film was made to be presented on television in installments.  If one watches it all at once, rather than spaced out over time, one notices some repetitive scenes and passages of dialogue (placed in the movie not only to remain faithful to the book, but to jog the television viewer's memory over what happened in the last installment).  Also, there are some ludicrous moments where floating heads appear in mirrors or carriage windows, and again, these disembodied talking heads usually pop up to remind the viewer of something that happened earlier in the movie.  Also - and this bothered me most - I wish more of the dialogue revolved around matters that weren't strictly plot-related.  In the book there are certain comments and conversations that are omitted from the movie that I think would have fleshed out the characters more. <br /> <br />Other than that, the BBC's Pride and Prejudice is a joy to watch.  Not only are the actors fantastic, the movie is filmed in a very picturesque way and you will love looking at the period costumes.  And Firth...  Colin Firth's presence prompts one to purchase the DVD.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|Oh, come on!  Look at you all, complaining that your fave GNR song isn't on it!   <br /> <br />Look at the title of the CD. It says:  'Guns n' Roses' Greatest Hits', doesn't it?  That means it has - guess what? - the greatest hits of Guns n' Roses, not the 'specially crafted Guns n' Roses CD especially for YOU and nobody else'. <br /> <br />Just check any UK Top 40 Singles Chart Archive (try [...] and type in Guns n' Roses in the 'Artist' slot) and it will show you how each of their singles rated in the Public Charts. <br /> <br />Compare the list of their hit singles to the Greatest Hits album and you'll see that the line up is virtually identical.  Cool, Eh? <br />Now, where on that list do you see 'Estranged', 'Coma' or 'Mr Brownstone'?  Nowhere. <br /> <br />'Nuff said.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Weak plot, trite script (two lonely strangers meet in a distant land and &quot;fulfill&quot; each others' emotional needs), lame dialogue. <br /> The whole movie felt so forced and contrived that I bailed on this unbearable borefest just past the halfway point. I am a Bill Murray fan. Even his inimitable comedic presence couldn't salvage this dog.  <br />  <br /> However, this movie can be used as an acid test to determine the veracity/ competence of your favorite movie reviewer. If they recommend this one, don't trust them!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|First off i would like to say that i have been a Slipknot fan since their self-titled cd came out back in '97 (at least i think it was '97),anyways for all of you saying that this is not the Slipknot that once was, check your ears again, this album is still pretty brutal even if it does have 2 acoustic tracks on it. In my opinion it is time that Slipknot varied it up a little bit, you can only do the same type of music for so many albums without it getting old and Slipknot realized this.  People say that they brought more of a Stone Sour edge into the music and i can buy that but this is so much different than the Stone Sour cd (which i also have), and yes Corey Taylor does not swear on this cd, but is it really all about swearing and screaming all the time, I mean don't get me wrong i like screaming as much as the next heavy music fan but u don't have to swear to get a message across, which Corey and the rest of this talented band do. So before u go screaming ur head off about how Slipknot sold out listen to the cd and the message they are putting out there and take it for what it is, a Slipknot album, and a damn good one at that, maybe not their best, but it certainly isn't their worst.  So either accept it or leave it and for the love of music in general, stop bitching about stuff u happen to not like, it's annoying and i'm sure everyone has better things to do than rip apart a band.
0553573403|5.0|George R.R. Martin's &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series is quite possibly the best epic fantasy series on the market currently. A Game of Thrones is an excellent first book in the series. A twisting an unpredictable plot is driven by many complex characters. There is no &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot; here, no black and white, every character is a shade of gray. No truly good characters, and no truly despicable ones, you don't know who you should be rooting for. The settings are original and well depicted. However, if you are averse to graphic violence and sex, you should be cautious about this series, because it has quite a lot of it, though it isn't gratuitious. The plot is completely unpredictable. Don't grow too close to any character, because anyone is fair game for death. In conclusion, this series (and this book) are excellent, and I highly recommend them.
1400031087|5.0|This book, though hard to read at times, gives new faith and hope to humanity and the power of the human spirit.  James Frey tells his tale in a way that very few authors have the insite to do.  This book is not for the faint of heart but the power it took to live through those experiences and retell them in such a brash way can make you smile, cry, laugh, and yell with anger all at the same time.
B0002KVUKM|5.0|It was so good. Yes the plot was not really there but still the action was great. The movie did look good. I loved the guy who play Dracula. He was funny and pretty scary at the same time. It was a lot better then Troy and The Day After Tomorrow.
1592400876|5.0|A fast, funny book on grammar. Obviously not a replacement for &lt;I>The Elements of Style&lt;/i> (now then, does Amazon do html?), but definitely worthy of space on the same shelf. Also a handy review on basic principles, as well as a nice overview of how we do things differently on both sides of the pond.
B000002MP2|5.0|I have to admit, this album kicks. hard. Their lyrics are not &quot;sissy&quot;, they are the truth for the leadman, Billie Joe. He just tells like it is, and combines it with great guitars, superb bass, and simply remarkable drums. All in all, a must own for any who likes music with kick. my mind: worth more than five stars

B000002I4S|5.0|I disagree with a lot of blind reviews from other fellow jazz lovers. Let me explain. Let's say firstly that this is an essential album if you are interested in Jazz. It is essential for sure, along with some other jazz masterpieces. But I would like to say something really focused about Giant Steps as a musical discovery. I'm talking about the first track and the opener of the album, the song Giant Steps above everything else. Giant Steps is to be exact a new way to substitute, to super impose changes above the common 2-5-1 progression which is the base to all standard jazz progressions. Let's say we have a progression like this one: Dminor/G7dominant/Cmajor seven/C major seven/. Giant Steps version would be: Dminor Eb7dominant/Ab major seven B7dominant/ E major seven G sevendominant/C major seven/ ... You can see by yourself that Trane changes are more complex. Anyway more complex does not mean better. In any sense. There are two more tonal centers, Ab major and Emajor. Is it great? Well, it is a great step in a sense yes, but these changes in the end didn't make it, this is the truth. Giant steps did not do to jazz what Bird's discovery did to jazz in the forties. Bird really changed completly the jazz language forever introducing elements that are still today the foundations of the jazz idiom. Trane introduced only a little step where Bird's inventions were the real GIANT steps. No jazz player today plays only in the Giant Steps manner. Absolutly. Some players plays here and there a couple of Trane changes just to add a little spice and ultramodernity and ultrasophistication to their playing but they don't do it all the time. Do you want to know why? Because Giant Steps changes are boring. This is the truth. A lot of musicians simply chose not to play Giant Steps changes at all! But every player today plays the Bird's discoveries! Every player!!! It is not a matter of difficulties. Trane changes sure are difficult (Bird's too) because they put three tonalities where the original 2-5-1 armony has one or two (considering substitutions on the 5) at least. But Bird's discoveries are richer than Trane's from a musical point of view. Bird is THE GIANT where Trane was a GIANT too but less gigantic than Bird for sure.<br /><br />Talking about the album from an historical perspective in the title track, Giant Steps, what you hear is simply a monster musician playing at his maximum just to shock listeners and the jazz community. It is incredible how much Trane should have practiced his changes to reach this level. He improvise at a level on these changes that is unbeliavable. (Listen to Tommy Flanagan. He was a great bop piano player but he didn't make it. He simply couldn't play Giant Steps at that speed.) But nevertheless the music still sound aritmetical. Simply because it is. And neither Trane could change the nature of these changes.<br /><br />Please, don't forget my first words. This is an essential album. Every jazz enthusiast should own it. Giant Steps in the end was a major event in the Jazz history, Naima is wonderful. Mr P.C. is a splendid minor blues theme. The other songs are great too. But don't forget my words about Trane changes as a musical discovery. Every serious and honest jazz player will agree with them.here the original 2-5-1 armony has one or two (considering substitutions on the 5) at least.

B00005JN2F|3.0|Let it be stated that I have not read the books, I enjoyed The Bourne Identity, and I was looking forward to this sequel.<br /><br /> That being said, this film left much to be desired, but its fatal flaw is its utter unremarkability. It just fades from your mind. The only images I'm left with is blurry grey shifting cuts from the extended car chase in a seemingly miraculously resistant taxi and Matt Damons wrinkled forehead and perpetually pouting features.<br /><br /> The &quot;shaky camera&quot; style that is taking over hollywood cinema is not just used in this movie, it features in it. It takes the reigns and drives it right over the cliff that is mediocrity. This movie is so hard on your eyes that you find yourself thinking about how hard it is on your eyes and not the movie. Audience withdrawal is not a way to create tension or suspense. Also, the rapid fire cuts and unfocused camera work makes you realize how little you actually see. What is meant to appear as a colossal and destructive car chase boils down to lots of tiny flashes that could be in all reality, bumper cars in an alley.<br /><br /> The plot had all the forward motion of a beached whale. yeah, its kinda cool, but why'd the whale decide to leave the fabulous ocean for a gritty beach and what are we gonna do with it now that its here?<br /><br /> *SPOILER*<br /><br /> They kill off Bourne's only friend/lover right off the bat- supposedly to give him motivation to fight kick and scratch his way to the truth... the painfully obvious, heavy handed, and slow moving truth... So now he's alone again and on his own, plagued by flashback of past murders. Bourne just feels weaker in this movie, narrow escapes seemed lucky rather than skilled, and I he was an inch away from breaking into tears the whole movie.<br /><br /> And Julia Stiles just kind've annoyed me...<br /><br /> All in all, a rentable flick, but don't pay big bucks at the Theatre for this headache of a film.
B0000251W2|5.0|Who would have thought that Iron Maiden would use guitar and bass synthetisers ? And who would have thought that the result would sound great and as heavy as it was on their previous albums ? Well, that's what happened with SIT.<br />1-Caught somewhere in time : A 7 minutes opener that just \\"lifts\\" you into the album. Listen to it with headphones, you'll be blown away. 10/10<BR>2-Wasted years : Adrian Smith first try at a more pop song that would later drive him out of Iron Maiden. Great riff, great chorus, great song. 9,5/10<BR>3-Sea of madness : Very underrated song. It's get better every day. Great display of emotion in the voice of Bruce. 9,5/10<BR>4-Heaven can wait : Very nice melodic and fast song. Interesting lyrics. 9/10<BR>5-The loneliness of the long distance runner : Again, very fast and melodic. The song resumes the near past of the band, especially during the world slavery tour. 9/10<BR>6-Stranger in a strange land : It was chosen to be the 2nd single. Not the best of choices, the weakest song on the album but still a very good one. The solo performed by Adrian Smith is something. 8,5/10<BR>7-Déjà-vu : Another fairly unknown and underrated song that, like Heaven can wait and the loneliness, is very fast and melodic. 9,5/10<BR>8-Alexander the Great : Steve Harris the Great ! Once again, a masterpiece of an epic that is vintage Harris. 10/10<br />By some fans, this album is not well rated. It's hard to understand because it's one of their strongest efforts ever. The sound blew me away back in 86 and it still does almost 20 years later. One of my favourites Maiden album. A masterpiece.
B000069HK2|5.0|The Used is by far one of the best bands I have ever heard. They are so good instramentally and Bert is a very good vocalist..

The Used will Blow up into something huge.. Everybody will love them... If you don't like their music, you don't have a heart... seriously.
B0000251W5|3.0|At the peak of their career, Iron Maiden decided, in 1990 with No prayer for the dying, to return to the roots. They were looking to recapture the sound of Killers and the Number of the beast. So they went back to shorter songs, drifting away from epics that made them famous. The result is disappointing, yet the album is not bad. The follow-up to a masterpiece like 7th son is always hard and No prayer suffered a lot from that. Also the departure of guitarist Adrian Smith who was replaced by Jannick Gers hurt the band. Gers's fast and furious style is 180 degres from Smith's style who is more of a technician.<br />1-Tailgunner : Very good opener. Another song that has war as the main inspiration. 8,5/10<br />2-Holy smoke : A critic of the televangelists. The 1st single after 7th son. The sound and the structure of the song are very \\"basic\\". A tough start. 7/10<br />3-No prayer for the dying : A very nice song with a great riff that followed the chorus. Should be more recognized. 9 /10<br />4-Public enema number one : With a better chorus it could have been a very good song. 7,5/10<br />5-Fates warning : Same as above with a slow intro that you wonder what it's doing. 7/10<br />6-The assassin : The killers of the 90's. Entertaining. 8,5/10<br />7-Run silent, run deep : Overall, the voice of Bruce Dickinson on the album is very average. On this song he's pushing a bit more. Good chorus for an OK song. 8/10<br />8-Hooks in you : The continuing story of Charlotte the harlot. It should have ended at the 22, Acacia Avenue. 7/10<br />9-Bring your daughter...to the slaughter : Originally performed and written by Bruce Dickinson on the OST of Nightmare on Elm Street 5, this song was re-done by Maiden. Was it because of a lack of material or just to please Dickinson who was aiming at a solo career ? Anyway, this a very good catchy song but it is not Iron Maiden ! It should have stayed a Bruce Dickinson solo song, even though it's the only Maiden song that reached the #1 chart position in the UK. 7/10<br />10-Mother Russia : A try to end the album on an epic. It fails, it's a very cheap version of Alexander the great. It's not an epic. 7/10<br />The album was a big disappointment and was the first step into the 90's who were very tough for Iron Maiden.

B0000251W3|5.0|Iron Maiden's first and only one true concept album. Every song is there for a reason and the album couldn't stand the loss of one of them.

It just prepares you for the excellence. 10/10<BR>2-Infinite dreams : In the same vein as Revelations. Brilliant. 10/10<BR>3-Can I play with madness : The commercial song of the album. But still has its place on a \\"serious\\" album. Catchy, very 80's sounding but is still good today. 9/10<BR>4-The evil that men do : A great rocker and a great chorus. 9/10<BR>5-7th son of a 7th son : A 10 minute long epic that sums all of the best things in this album (and in Maiden). A masterpiece very close to Rime of the ancient mariner, great instrumental break. 10/10<BR>6-The prophecy : A very heavy and dark chorus with great voices by Bruce and a beautiful acoustic outro. 9/10<BR>7-The clairvoyant : The other \\"commercial\\" song of the album. Great guitar work during the verses. Catchy. 9/10<BR>8-Only the good die young : Closes the album in a great way, as good as Moonchild did open it. 9/10<br />Individually not the strongest album. But you have to look at the ensemble to see how genius this is. The ultimate Iron Maiden album. The ultimate heavy metal album. The ultimate album. This is the one I would like to be buried with.
B0001ENYKS|3.0|&quot;Take Me Out&quot; is a great song, no two ways about it. One that will always remind me of this summer, much like the White Stripes' &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot; defined last summer. However, the rest of the album is just not very exciting to me. Too derivative and lightweight. Fun, yes, but the balance of the songs fade quickly from memory, much as the CD made a quick exit from my CD changer.

B000068TPN|5.0|It's disheartening to see so many hostile reviews of this movie.  What's wrong with a little patriotism especially in these Michael Moore troubled times?  Aside from that, look at the finished product:  it's very realistic, touching, devastating and encouraging, too.  Director Randall Wallace spares little in his brutal fight scenes; the horror of war is captured and viewed from both sides.  The film's inclusion of what was going on with the wives is also pertinent; yes, I can believe they'd talk about trivial things such as laundry and shopping; what good would mourning and sitting around discussing things they can't change.  If you watch the actresses closely, you'll sense an underlying nervousness and fear.  The cast is wonderful: Mel Gibson brings his John Wayneish charisma to a role that demands only fierce drive, loyalty and compassion; Madeline Stowe displays her courage and her fear in a role that could have been merely fodder; Sam Elliott's one-toned delivery masks what he feels inside; Chris Klein's turn as the new father destined for disaster is sensitively portrayed; Barry Pepper is remarkable in his role as the journalist on whose book this movie is based; Ryan Hurst as Savage is likewise touching and commendable.  Greg Kinnear is good too as the copter pilot, considering most of his dialogue is delivered on his butt!<br /><br />WE WERE SOLDIERS is a flag-waving movie for sure, but it is an intelligently and compassionately made movie; I enjoyed it.
1878424319|1.0|This book had 4 good things to be learned:  <br />1.  Be impeccable with your word <br />2.  Do not take anything personally <br />3.  Do not assume <br />4.  Do your best. <br /> <br />However, I have to give the book one star because of his pagan beliefs which he sought to teach in the book.  One of the things the author began with before getting into the heart of his message, was that his philosophy is a lifestyle, and does not impose on religion.  This was NOT true at all!  He talked about things that did impose on my religion. Such as claiming we are all gods.  This is such a pagan statement it made me almost want to throw the book in the trash. His New Age and Humanistic view points were very far from the truth. <br />I would NOT recommend this book to anyone.
B00005JM02|5.0|i was amazed by this movie.  originally i thought there was just way too much hype about Finding NEmo last summer.  but when my brother gave me the collectors edition DVD for my birthday i got a chance to see what everyone was talking about.  the incredible digital quality makes this movie a masterpiece.  the story is just something we all can relate to.  it doesnt use that extremely unrealistic and happy disney theme that we have seen so many times, but rather a very down to earth and real life saga and story of finding yourself.  theres lots of ways to look at this movie.  one way you should is buy renting it or buying the dvd- so do it!!!
B00009V7P8|5.0|When I visited Ireland last September, I found a small music shop and asked the two guys working there if they could recommend an Irish artist that I would enjoy. They both immediately suggested Damien Rice so I bought the album. The CD is amazing and the first listenings are wonderful because it takes you a couple different emotions, from the longing in The Blowers Daughter, to the bitterness of Cheers Darlin'. The remarkable part is that I've listened to it so much in the past 10 months and never at all tired of it.  <br />  <br /> I really highly recommend this, especially if you are a Coldplay or Radiohead fan. If you are interested in another great Irish band, I'd recommend The Frames with their album, Set List. They opened for the Damien Rice concert in Chicago and were awesome! After listening to this CD, you can only imagine that Damien is great live, but great is a huge understatement. He was absolutely brilliant live and I would love to see him sing again. I'm definitely very happy that I listened to the advice to buy it in Ireland.
B000002ADT|5.0|I am a huge jazz fan, but i wasn't always. I never thought anything of the music, and was always more into pop and rock. This is the album that changed that. However, it didn't happen immediately. I put it on as background music and throughout the course of about...seven years, i noticed the album a little more, until suddenly, it dawned on me that this is the greatest american accomplishment, as far as art and beauty are concerned. Eventually, i began to explore more jazz, finding greatness like Kind of Blue but never equaling it. Thus, this is THE album to buy, whether you like jazz, like i do now, or don't care for it, like i didn't before i listened to it.  <br />  <br /> It begins with a haunting prelude, which forces inattentive ears to pay attention, and then the album takes off. It echoes and creates a mood that will raise the hairs off your neck. All through the album, there is this chilling feeling, which i later realized to be the most beautiful music ever created. Everyone knows Miles Davis is a Genius(read his book, &quot;Miles&quot; with Quincy Troupe to learn more), but this is the album that makes that statement such a truism. The arrangements, the magic surrounding its one-take-only tracks, and the individual strength of each player is overwhelming at times. Paul Chambers, bassist, secures a grooving and dark beat, accompanied by drummer Jimmy Cobb, who lays back but maintains a presence. Pianist Bill Evans achieves sheer beauty out of simplicity in both soloing and comping(playing behind solos). Wynton Kelly, pianist on #2 Freddie Freeloader, ignites the only really speedy tune and lays down a bouncing blues solo. John Coltrane, tenor master and additional music genius, achieves splendid lyricism and, when analyzed, one finds great complexity in his seemingly simple, yet powerful solos. Julian &quot;Cannonball&quot; Adderley is equally lyrical, original, and adds much needed warmth to a chillingly beautiful album. What can be said about Davis? It is an understatement to remark on his shocking simplicity, his genius for soloing and composing, and his unique tone, which has yet to be matched by any contemporary or past trumpeter.  <br />  <br /> The album closes on the modal Flamenco Sketches, a series of five scales which give both the feelings of Spanish culture (see Miles' &quot;Sketches of Spain&quot; for further elaboration on this)and also a feeling of pure heaven. The album should be called &quot;Kind of Heaven&quot;, because, after one listens to it and finds its true beauty, that is where one will be.  <br />  <br /> A stunning achievement and a hopeful introduction to the immense world of Jazz and American Art.
B0001KZM3O|5.0|This CD is not for the casual listeners of music. However, musically, it's one of the most impressive albums I own. This isn't the Pink Floyd that you're used to, but still it holds up there with their best work. This is probably about as close to perfect as an album can get, even surpassing it's classic predecessor, The Wall. If you're really into music, don't hesitate to buy this masterpiece. Just give it the time it deserves, it won't just jump out at you by any means. <br />  <br /> Track picks: &quot;Your Possible Pasts&quot;, &quot;The Hero's Return&quot;, &quot;The Gunner's Dream&quot;, &quot;Fletcher Memorial Home&quot;, &quot;The Final Cut&quot;, &quot;Not Now John&quot;, &quot;Two Suns in the Sunset&quot;.
B00005JN2F|1.0|Wow, what an incredible waste of celluloid. <br />What could have been a very good movie became a piece of unwatchable trash. <br />The cheap technique of \\"shaky camera\\" only ruined the film. <br />If the film was shot with a steady camera, they could have shaken it up in post or they could have had the choice to not \\"shake\\" it up based on a couple of audience pollings. <br />Too Bad... <br />

B000002BFZ|5.0|I can honestly say that this album made me a real fan of Pearl Jam. I had bought all of their previous albums and enjoyed them all but this one was different. Up until this record came out Pearl Jam could do no wrong. All of their songs were in constant radio rotation and to many people this record just didn't rock like the older ones. I think this record sounds better because a lot of the angst of grunge rock was gone from this album. I encourage everyone to pick this record up and give it a listen. I think you'll be suprised.
B00008S2VG|2.0|I discovered Madonna when I was about 15 listening to I'll remember and I started loving her due to You'll see. I really like her voice, especially in Evita, and I think Ray of Light is one of the best album ever produced. Excellent music and voice acting, deep meaning, and still fun (i.e. Beautiful Stranger). Music is interesting, too. Excellent tracks, but not at Ray of Light level, only for entertainment without meaning. American Life is so bad. I was expecting something special, but Mirwais sucks!! I like some songs, especially Nothing Fails and Mother and Father, but there isn't a killer-track..everything looks the same and she sounds so flat in every song. If you listen to her ballads like Take a bow and The power of goodbye you can see how well she shows her feelings, she rocks! But now she seems to have lost her touch. Maybe the tour can revitalize her, I hope. <br /> We'll see!! <br />
B0001ZX0OW|5.0|I've read a few of the comments on here, and didn't really realize where they were coming from...   <br /> <br />Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, and Kevin Bacon star in this excellent murder mystery, directed by Clint Eastwood.  The idea here is, three boys in their pre-pubescent ages were best friends until a particular incident led to assault and abuse by horrid people disguised as police officers, and then we are led to many years later, all of them with a history and grown apart.  Sean Penn is the owner of a liquor store/convenience store in the heart of Boston, Tim Robbins is a married loner, who is a bit slow and a bit messed up, and Kevin Bacon is a detective.  Meanwhile, Sean Penn's daughter is out on the town with a few friends barhopping, when suddenly she goes missing, and is found dead, and the evidence all points to the same man, Tim Robbins!  We are carried into a web of a man distraught, using any bounds possible to find the killer of his daughter, a detective trying his best to follow the rules and find the killer for his former friend, and the emotional loner, unfairly pigeonholed as the killer.  As we wind down we are brought to a sad and shocking ending... <br /> <br />This type of movie has been done before.  I'm not going to make believe this is some sort of original situation, but the incredible acting by Sean Penn and Tim Robbins touches at all your emotions.  Kevin Bacon is still great as the detective, Laura Linney is great as Jimmy's overbearing wife, and Marcia Gay Harden is impressive as Dave's submissive wife.  All the characters are terribly realistic, and human, and that's what makes this movie great.  There are no super heroes here.  And furthermore, this movie touches upon the ongoing violence occurring with teenagers.  You will see what I mean when you see it. <br /> <br />Overall, it's not even a murder mystery to me, but more of a heart-felt drama between friends, and family, and letting impulsiveness and sudden lack of trust interfere with its cohesion.
6302732875|5.0|Myself and some friends have built up a kind of appreciation society for this movie in recent years. The reasons not just being the outstanding male cast (Pacino, Lemmon and Harris are all on fire in this) but also the outstanding dialogue skills that Mamet inevitably brings. This movie sheds new light on the terms &quot;morally corrupt&quot; and &quot;dog-eat-dog&quot;, with every character double-crossing, lying, manipulating and maligning their ways through their customers and each other. This movie is full of subtleties and nuances, and a host of brilliant moments. Watch out for Pacino's breathtaking tirade in the second half, not to mention Alec Baldwin's blood-chilling &quot;motivational&quot; speech at the beginning. Awesome. <br />  <br /> Outstanding movie for anyone interested in truly brilliant acting and script-writing. You won't regret it.
B00004RF83|5.0|People who are into political thrillers will love this movie. In reply to the first reviewer I must say as a member of the &quot;MTV&quot; generation I really appreciate this classic movie based on the novel by Fletcher Knebel. But your point is well taken, if people only enjoy seeng cars, buildings, spaceships etc. blowing up onscreen then this is definately not your movie.
B00024BHTC|5.0|over the past half a year or so, nightwish has quickly become one of my favorite bands.  With each cd they just get better and better.  The fact that there is a nightwish cd on amazon.com with less than four and a half stars is a sad outlook on music fans.  Why do some people hate this and not their other stuff? It's the same as their old stuf...except better.  These days, any band that releases a new cd is going to get put down, people are so picky now.  no one wants to be happy with their bands, they MUST have something to cry about.  I think since nightwish are pretty big now, people are jealous that they now have more than .2 fans so they must put down the cd that gave nightwish it's fame.  pretty sad. <br /> <br />For the first time, this is a nightwish cd that you can headbang to! the guitar riffs are scoarching, easily their most metal, their best guitar work.  And you can actually hear the bass, it's brought out into the songs A LOT more.  Nightwish have always had symphonic leanings but now it's full force with a real symphony, plus the added bonus of the keyboards, as always.   <br /> <br />There is two epic songs on here, worth the price of the cd alone.  The lyrics are their best yet and as i said before, the songs ROCK hard, their heaviest cd yet. Songs like palnet hell and dead gardens will rip you a new one.  The Siren has a great beginning and rocks all the way through. <br /> <br />track 10, Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan, is one of their most beautiful songs ever.  It's just tarja sing with the keyboards and symphony as the music.  It's sung in finland..omg, such a a awesome language, it's turned into words from angels with tarja's beutiful vocals.   <br /> <br />Their best cd yet.  Their most epic and progressive.  Their most heavy.  Their most symphonic.  I recommend this beyond any measure.  Get this now.
B00020X88O|1.0|This movie is a modern day miracle. It is chalk-full of beautiful women and nudity but somehow manages to be anything but sexy. The story is silly. The acting is bad. The sex is not a turn on. I basically rented this movie because I've got a thing for Gina Gershon, yet somehow they managed to make her naked and unsexy. Sigh, I should have just watched 'Bound' again. Don't waste your time. <br />
0142004235|1.0|I find it hard to read a book whose characters I have not respect for. I never had any reason to care what happened to these people.<br /><br />That is what I wrote, when I read the 1st 1/2 of the book. I hated the first 1/2, but then when I read the 2nd half it was a lot better... But it won't let me change my review...
B000002B30|3.0|<br />The first two albums are ignored and the rest of the songs are available in a number of other places. So why get this one? The last four cuts are the reunited E-Street band after Bruce's brief and not entirely successful attempt at going on without them. The cuts are a mixed bag with the hard driving, \\"Murder Inc.\\" and his ode to the band, \\"Blood Brothers,\\" sandwiched between  the gentle \\"Secret Garden\\" and the out of sorts mix of country lyrics and rock beat of \\"This Hard Land.\\" Is it worth the price? Fans (like me) will have to have it, but the casual listener should search for the CD that has the songs they like on this one. That will definitely be a more satisfying listen. <br />
B00003CXCT|5.0|The films are part of the American character. But there is a real frustration for the 30 year wait for this collection. The quality and storytelling makes the series one of the most beloved ever made. I have them because I am a fan. But the powers that be that caused such an overwhelming delay in the release have ruined the magic.
B00005YXZH|4.0|<br />Few groups are willing to take the risks that Wilco (OK, Tweedy)) takes on this CD. Sounds come from out of nowhere, interfering with or complicating the melodies. You are never able to quite settle down with this recording. I have listened to a number of times now, and I still find myself fascinated by the way the sounds all tie together forming this rather odd, but compelling disc.  The lyrics have a tendency to play off the music and emphasize the strangeness of the sounds. \\"Cheer Up\\" has a man whose mind is \\"Filled with radio cures.\\" Within you will also find \\"an American aquarium drinker,\\" \\"Skyscrapers scraping together,\\" and a few other odd images, but overall there is a feeling of loss, but that with that loss there is also the possibility of redemption via the power of love. I just find this one fascinating. <br />
B00023BLXK|5.0|I recently viewed the DVD Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights and thought it was terrific! The dancing was extraordinary and the actors really made the scenes they were in come to life. I also thought it was a perk to have Patrick Swayze from the original movie,Dirty Dancing as a dance instructor in the movie. It is a must see movie and a must have in your DVD collection. The music was also sensational!
B000000OAC|4.0|Starting with the outrageous combo of \\"We Will Rock You/We are the Champions,\\" NEWS OF THE WORLD does the amazing thing of combining the sublime with the ridiculous and making it work. Then Queen rips into the title track that never was (\\"Sheer Heart Attack,\\") and it's a good thing that Taylor's other wild contribution \\"Fight from the Inside\\" is not the next track because you need a breather. That breather is supplied by May and Deacon with all of their contributions leaning toward the mellow side, and other than the silly \\"Get Down Make Love,\\" (which would have been better placed on HOT SPACE) and anguished cry of \\"It's Late\\" the CD finishes with a quiet calm that really works well in contrast to the fireworks at the beginning. This is one of Queen's better works and much more than the first two songs. (Epic as they are!) <br />
B00005JN2F|1.0|This movie would have been a 5 if the director would have just eliminated the Hand-Held-Camera. The music was nice and tight with the action...the acting was great and the story was good.

0446607274|4.0|This is an excellent read, and I would have rated it 5 stars except for the constant justification by Connelly of why it's okay for any segment of the population to riot, loot, burn, destroy and kill, supposedly all in the name of anger and lack of hope. Baloney. The mystery, the excitement of the chase, the anticipation of the unraveling of clues all get constantly interrupted by Connelly's whining about why everyone should just accept the reasons for the animal-like behavior of the mob mentality. I realize the backdrop of riots was crucial to this book but not the shove-it-down-your-throat preaching that was a constant theme in this book. The media can justify that kind of behavior all they want--most of us don't buy it.
0061020710|3.0|Terry Pratchett is now a publishing superstar, thanks to his witty, wonky Discworld series. But the Discworld series didn't start off on such good ground. In first Discworld novel &quot;The Colour of Magic,&quot; Pratchett lets his plot get away from him and meander over the edge of the Disc.<br /><br /> Discworld is a flat planet, balanced atop four elephants that stand on a giant turtle's back. And somewhere on that vast Disc is Rincewind the wizard -- cowardly, greedy, unlucky, a dropout and not very good at what he does. Enter Twoflower, a rather clueless tourist, and the Luggage, which walks around on hundreds of tiny legs.<br /><br /> Despite the fact that he doesn't want to, Rincewind is required to help the Discworld's first tourist ever (it's Twoflower, in case you're wondering). They're attacked by thieves, gamble with gods, encounter Death (who speaks ALL IN CAPITALS), and bumble through magical spells that can cause some major problems. But that isn't the biggest problem, when they encounter the very edge of the Disc...<br /><br /> &quot;Colour of Magic&quot; doesn't have much of a plot -- it basically has a long string of confusing, unhappy incidents that plague Rincewind, and it ends on an unsatisfying note. But at least the ride is fairly fun -- Pratchett spoofs the fantasy cliches with wink-nudge fervor.<br /><br /> Pratchett peppers his satirical little novel with lots of fun ideas, such as the quirky gods of Discworld and the dragon that vanishes if you stop believing in it. Unfortunately, the dialogue and writing aren't quite up to par. At times it's the delicious tone of British comedy, and sometimes it's so serious that it seems like Pratchett is writing an entirely different novel.<br /><br /> Rincewind isn't a very engaging character in this volume -- we laugh at him, not with him. His constant efforts to keep himself alive are especially funny, since his luck is a mixture of bad (he always gets into trouble) and good (he always gets out of it). Twoflower is an amusing character, but the Luggage steals the show despite not being able to speak.<br /><br /> Fans of comic fantasy might enjoy &quot;Colour of Magic,&quot; but it's by far the weakest of Pratchett's many Discworld books. If you're looking for something insanely funny and well-written, go further in the series.gets out of it).

B00005JN2F|2.0|The Bourne is back, as played by Matt Damon, in &quot;The Bourne Supremacy.&quot; While the story-line and characterization improve from the mediocre first movie of this proposed trilogy, Paul Greengrass's shakycam direction and Julia Stiles's tepid acting bog it back down.<br /><br /> Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is in hiding with his leftover girlfriend Marie (Franka Potente) in India, and he has the weirdest feeling that someone is after him. It turns out that he isn't just being paranoid -- a CIA agent turns up, and Jason and Marie try to escape. After losing Marie, Jason sets out in his former life as an assassin.<br /><br /> Unfortunately, Bourne has somehow been framed for an assassination that, needless to say, he didn't carry out. Now he's a hunted man again, and he has to somehow clear his name and try to live in peace again. But with a ruthless agent on his tail (Karl Urban), his chances seem to be getting a lot slimmer.<br /><br /> It takes awhile to figure out exactly what went on in this movie -- it's all quite confusing and needlessly enigmatic. But the core of the movie is Bourne kicking butt, and they manage to pull that off pretty well -- Damon isn't a steroid hulk, and the action scenes seem to be tailored to fit around him.<br /><br /> Director Paul Greengrass seems to be under the impression that an MTV-style shakycam will give the film realism. Nope, just motion sickness. The constant jerking and wobbling are enough to make you dizzy. What's more, with the through-Bourne's-eyes method, we don't get to see half of what happens around him. Without the shakycam the film would have been far more enjoyable than it ended up being -- as it is, it just feels chaotic.<br /><br /> Damon isn't a great actor, but he's obviously giving this role his best efforts, and he gives off a kind of cold, grim intensity that's well suited to the role. Franka Potente's limp, annoying presence drops out quickly, to be replaced by the tepid but passable presence of Julia Stiles. The stars here are Joan Allen, as a tightly wound CIA official, and the coldly menacing Karl Urban as Bourne's Russian counterpart.<br /><br /> What would have been a moderately fun action flick is wrecked by the shakycam shooting style. &quot;Bourne Supremacy&quot; had promise, but on the silver screen it's suited best to people who don't get motion sick.ence of Julia Stiles.

It made me cry, it made me angry- I literally could not stop thinking about this book- during class, during work- I'd speak about it to everyone- letting them know how entrapt I was with this novel. Its brilliant in the most depressing way possible.<br /><br />I loved it and highly recommend it.

B00005N5S5|5.0|This film showed Arnold at his highest peak, with the baddest attitude ever, unstoppable and causing devastation. The terminator is the best as a bad guy, because that makes him such a love-to-hate villian, hoping the good guys win but still rooting the terminator on.  <br /> The terminator, flesh on the outside, but underneath is all computerized, is programmed to track you down, no matter where you are, and will stop at nothing until you are dead. The terminator's nonstop chaos causes you to remain focused, and it creates a certain stamina inside of you cheering for the terminator and a special liking for the fact that he is indestructable.  <br /> &quot;Sarah Conner&quot; is all he said to the few women that he blew away, while looking for the real Sarah, mother of John Conner. They set the plot well. Especially that one part when Kyle was describing Sarah's son to her, who he knew from the 2020's, which made Sarah say: Now I know what to name him. What they were obviously saying in the plot was that Kyle was supposedly John's father, since Kyle and Sarah made love when he met her, in present time. This was way before the future, when Kyle met John and was fighting the machines. <br /> This film has special effects that makes the battle scenes ten times more wicked, my favorite was when Arnold was on fire in mid air and punched through the windshield. All the costly special effects are only useful when the terminator is a bad guy, which is one of the reasons why I liked the first terminator so much better than the sequel. How can you like the truculent, half man-half machine Arnold on the side of good, and not evil? <br />
1559408855|5.0|I am totally agree with some of the reviews below. Criterion should re-release this title in no time to stop this 500-1000 $ madness. Anyone can purchase a BFI copy of this title from amazon/uk also.
B00028HBKM|4.0|Let me preface this by saying that I am not the most religious person out there. I actually went with the intention of being thoroughly disappointed and wanting my money back. HOWEVER, this is an artistic masterpiece. Regardless of your religious preferences, you should see this movie. Gibson relates the 12 hours leading to the death of Christ in a series of flashbacks, beatings, and stunning cinematography. His choice of doing this movie in Latin and Aramaic was correct; it would not be nearly as powerful if performed in English. Jim Clavizel has little match with the intensity that his eyes convey. Gibson also adds nuances and flourishes to the story (the Satan character and the demons that hound Judas) that add so much to this movie.  <br /> <br />A lot has been written concerning the anti-semitism this movie conveys, and I'd strongly recommend that you see the movie and reserve your opinions on that until you've actually seen the movie. I don't really blame the Jews for the crucifiction, and I think Gibson utilizes the mob as a tool of Satan, and that really shows in the movie. Also, the gore is definitely present, and you should not see this if you have a weak stomach. However, it is dispersed throughout the movie, and after that first horrible whipping, you don't notice it as much. I definitely think that everyone should see this once. I don't think it has much repeat viewing value, as I was thoroughly impressed with it, but like a Schindler's List, have no desire to see it again.  <br />
B00003CXBK|4.0|First of all, I'd like to warn parents (as other reviewers have) that this is an adult animated feature, and NOT a cartoon.  As such, there are some VERY graphic, violent scenes, including decapitations and dismemberments. <br /> <br />That being said, I have to say that this was a very impressive effort by Mizayaki, but perhaps not quite as engaging or imaginative as Spirited Away (those are the only two Mizayaki films I've seen).  I have to agree with some of the other reviewers that the ending was a bit sugar-coated, but for me it was not enough to ruin the overall experience. <br /> <br />This film's political message is a bit preachy, and it runs a little long (nearly 2 1/2 hours), but all in all, this is a very entertaining film.  Recommended (but NOT for young children).
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Avril, Avril, Avril... why do I feel as if the songs sound mostly the same when I listen to them a lot? So Avril started out with a light, happy &quot;Let Go&quot; and emerged into this... &quot;Under My Skin&quot; a more mature, dark, yet still the same Avril. Still be the little 'punk rocker&quot; as she calls herself. This CD is pretty good though. The songs sink deeper into you than the songs in &quot;Let Go&quot; do. Anyways, back to the review. <br />  <br /> 1)Take Me Away- Sounds like she's mad... okay though. <br />  <br /> 2)Together- Again, at the chorous, she sounds like she's mad. <br />  <br /> 3)Don't Tell Me- You all should know what this sounds like. To me it sounds very bland and easy to forget. <br />  <br /> 4)He Wasn't- Talk about light-hearted-ness! After three dark songs, this puts the CD on the lighter side again. Blends in perfectly. <br />  <br /> 5)How Does it Feel- I like it. It's quiet, it sounds good but even though it's quiet it's not like Norah Jones' music which is boring. This song isn't boring at all. <br />  <br /> 6)My Happy Ending- Even though it sounds happy and cheerful, listen to it a few times and you'll find that it is very dark and sinks into you. <br />  <br /> 7)Nobody's Home- I don't get this song. I hardly ever listen to it because of its blandness and somewhat boringness. <br />  <br /> 8)Forgotten- Plain okay, nothing too special about this song, not bad, not great, plain okay. <br />  <br /> 9)Who Knows- Love it, Again very cheerful and lighthearted. Fun and the lyrics teach you a good lesson. <br />  <br /> 10)Fall to Pieces- Okay, Gets sorta boring after a while. <br />  <br /> 11)Freak Out-Fun, doesn't mean much but fun! <br />  <br /> 12)Slipped Away- I love it. Pretty, very pretty, I like the part where it goes &quot;now you're gone, now you're gone, there you go, there you go...&quot; <br />  <br /> 13)I Always Get What I Want- This is one of two bonus tracks, this makes her sound like a spoiled brat... whichmaybe she is. Not my favorite. <br />  <br /> 14)Nobody's Home (Live Acoustic)- The other bonus track. Didn't like the original song, Don't like this either. <br />  <br /> Overall, this CD is good.The blend of songs twist together perfectly into one enjoyable album.
1592400876|5.0|At last, someone UNDERSTANDS! <br />   This delightful and educational rant against all-too-common abuse and neglect of apostrophes, commas, semicolons, and their ilk will have English-lovers leaping out of their seats, waving their arms, and shouting their agreement.  Passionate readers, writers, and academics -- anyone to whom English composition is an art -- will love this book. <br />   Eats, Shoots & Leaves is frequently amusing, but it is not a comedy nor a collection of jokes.  It explains rules of punctuation well, but it is not written as a guide.  What it IS is a protracted rally speech for people who, like me, get violent urges at the sight of misused punctuation.  I cannot remember another book evoking as much joyful agreement. <br />   My only complaint is the list price; it is VERY short -- perhaps 75 pages if printed as a mass market paperback -- and though I found it wonderful, someone less enthusiastic about the subject may feel cheated.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This is a film that divides people more ruthlessly and completely than any other I can remember and the strength of the opinions formed by this dreamy and delicate piece of cinema can to say the least be intense. <br />  <br /> The atmosphere of \\"Lost in Translation\\" will be familiar to anyone who has ever stayed in alone in a luxury hotel while travelling on business. Bill Murray plays Bob Harris, a formally popular actor who has seen his celebrity dwindle to a point where he has become a rather sadder version of \\"The Simpson's\\" character Troy McClure. Unable to find work in the west he accepts an offer by a Japanese whiskey manufacturer to front their advertising campaign. Unable to understand exactly what his paymasters want from him, he spends an increasing amount of time in his hotel doing very little; it is here that he meets Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), the Ivy League educated young wife of a celebrity photographer who is staying in the same hotel. Ignored by her husband who seems to believe that she is happy admiring the view from their bedroom window and waiting for him to return, her youth and sense of abandonment seems to compliment the world weary decadence of Bob as the pair explore the electric landscape of Tokyo a rather improbable yet compelling bond is formed.  <br />  <br /> Sofia Coppola's first film, &quot;Virgin Suicides&quot; was one of my favourite of the past 10 years, so I really looked forward to seeing this. The only time I had free to get to the cinema was and early afternoon in midweek and as I sat alone in the darkness and watched on the huge screen I was able to interact with the image in front of me in a very intimate way and I thought to myself, &quot;This is how this film should been seen&quot;. If you are expecting a fast paced plot driven spectacle then look elsewhere, this film is all about mood and atmosphere. In her sophomore effort this remarkably talented director has presented us the audience with a film that seems to distil the pure spirit of the isolation that many people in the \\"always connected\\" 21st century still feel.
0767817478|3.0|Oh come on people this movie wasn't that bad! I just wonder, if this movie had gotten GOOD reviews from newspapers and TV, if most of these reviewers would also give it a good review. I think most people simply go with the crowd, and dislike a film if everyone else also seems to dislike it.<br /><br /> Most of my favorite films were critically panned. I love the weird and odd films.<br /><br /> Even though this film was a major mainstream release, I still liked it. The first scenes with Godzilla walking around New York, and only showing his feet were cool as all get out..<br /><br /> If any critic says it wasn't, well they shouldn't be watching sci-fi films, and go back to watching Tom Cruise love stories or sumthin..<br /><br /> Think for yourselves people, quit being clones...

Combination of voices and a rhytm exremely simple but filled with a powerful melody and message .<br /> Lucy in the sky breaks the rules . The melodic lines of the guitar opened a new frontier .<br /> But I'd love to turn you on literally surpased all the expected . This is a bitter crude and introspective loaded with nosthalgic mood : &quot;He didn't notice the lights had changed&quot;.<br /> The weird proposal was amazing , think it about the fact of being set in the last track is not a mere coincidence .<br /> The Beatles were in the peak of his cretaivie powers and this album (in my personal opinion) established a real breakthrough respect to any previous work .
B00005JLEU|5.0|You say you are a huge fan of anime and list 'Digimon' with clear conscience?          'Spirited Away' is among those animes that have a message, that go a bit...'deeper' than the usual anime that is shown on american TV and that have alot more seriousness than any Disney movie... There are alot of allusions to japanese mythology and gods in this movie. It's most definitely not 'robbed of any plot'.    Most probably, you haven't even heard of 'Princess Mononoke' (which is from the same director as the reviewed film), 'Neon Genesis Evangelion', 'X' or other serious anime?           In Japan, Miyazaki's film 'Princess Mononoke' was the biggest box-office hit of all time (bigger than Titanic was)...and when 'Spirited Away' came to the cinemas, it even topped 'Mononoke'. That could not happen in America, because in Japan, anime is not just considered 'childish' entertainment, but art. Many animes and mangas are not made for children. This one is, though. Maybe you should try 'Princess Mononoke'. I suppose if you don't like that one too you should maybe reconsider, if it is really anime that you are a 'huge fan' of.
0316168815|5.0|I dare you to read the first page of this book and then walk away.  I was working in a bookstore when this book came out and it became a pick of our self-proclaimed \\"chief booklover\\" which made me mock it.  So, to prove my hunch, I picked it up and read the first page.  Its the first book that has gripped me so intensely from the very beginning and kept me gripped throughout.  Not a feel good book, but deftly descriptive and chilling.  I have and continue to highly recommend it.
B00005JN2F|5.0|Excellent thriller. The chase scenes are awesome and will have you on the edge of your seat. Seems like Jason is this close to getting caught throughout the movie. If you like spy-thriller-violent-action movies, this is it.
0061015725|3.0|Prey deals with very difficult and technical subject matter. The story is about nanotechnology, a subject I'm certain we're all familiar with....NOT!<br /><br /> The book starts out grabbing you around the collar and it holds on tight. It's a mixture of mystery, as well as comedy, as we are introduced to our characters and what is happening in their world at this moment. There is a wonderful crescendo effect as the story evolves from 'getting to know you' to 'Oh my God, what is happening?' What I didn't like about the book was the fifty or so pages in which the author tried to explain exactly what nanotechnology is and how it related to our plot. It was alot like reading a VCR manual. Hang in there, it gets better.<br /><br /> Once you are thoroughly confused as to what nanoparticles do and how they originate, and by the way, I don't think it was information we really needed to enjoy the story, the pace kicks into high gear and doesn't slow down til the last 6 pages or so when our author wraps it all up.<br /><br /> This book would make a great movie, and it was a really good book, minus the techno talk that was really confusing and too techno for us common folk.
B00020HEL6|5.0|To be truthful, the first I heard of Renee Olstead was from the promotionals on Windows Media Player. Yet, with her classical jazz and blues voice, she once again reminds me of why I passionately love jazz.  <br /> <br />Whilst I believe that this album will not even rival Norah Jones' latest album in terms of sales, each song from Renee Olstead, from the sublime and subtle 'Someone To Watch Over Me' to the lively and upbeat melody of 'Summertime', features the type of music that is simultaneously relaxing and thought-provoking - a rare quality that is common to all of the great musicians of jazz and even other musical genres.  <br /> <br />In having said that, Renee Olstead is not a perfect album. It is somewhat forgettable at times, simply blowing over you like a cool Autumn breeze. Some may also complain of how the album loses some of its credibility - especially within the lyrics - because of Renee's youth. <br /> <br />Although a relatively new jazz musician, Renee Olstead exudes a feeling of familiarity - which in this case is perhaps the greatest blessing for fans of jazz. We can only hope that Renee continues to grow in maturity and voice, and produce music which at times leaves you in awe; encouraging people to seek out a further education in jazz.
B000071ZZI|5.0|Who knew?<br /><br />Because there was all kinds of buzz about The Bourne Supremacy, I decided to watch The Bourne Identity simply out of curiosity. I had never seen Matt Damon in any movie, and was not expecting a whole heck of a lot since I obviously live under a rock and did not realize just what a phenomenally talented actor Damon is.<br /><br />Surprise. This movie is incredibly riveting from start to finish, a true tour de force, and I don't even like spy movies as a rule. The acting is taut, true and not a bit overdone as Damon plays a hired assassin who wakes up on a fishing trauler off the coast of Marseilles with no memory of who he is and what he does for a living. He does not know why he is proficient in several languages, why there are multiple passports, international currency and a heavy duty gun in his effects, and why he has a sixth sense tuned in to danger from bad guys.<br /><br />And bad guys there are, as the CIA et al try to bring him down as a trained automaton gone haywire.<br /><br />Damon runs the gamut of emotions from wary terror to fear to acute frustration to sensitivity (yes, there is a girl, and no, there is no gratuitious sex) in a way that lets him kill in cold blood and still remaine the hero. If you haven't already seen this movie, get your hands on it, because you will not regret it.
B0002MB7QW|4.0|Roland Emmerich is the master of creating awesome action movies (Godzilla, Independence Day), and this is one of them. When watching it, watch it for the incredibly awesome storms. Do not look too hard into the big plot and the incorrect science. If you do this, you will end up enjoying the movie very much. Hard to tell what the DVD will be like now, but i'm excited.
B0001FR3IQ|5.0|I HIGHLY Recommend this Psychological thriller. I have to disagree with one review that said it was predictable - it's not !!
B00006LPIW|3.0|Most viewers either love or hate this lurid and sometimes over-the-top examination of sexual disfunction and insanity, but I'm probably in the minority in that my ultimate reaction to it is...ehh. <br />  <br /> I don't need a film to be fully understandable to enjoy and appreciate it, but still I found this one as a whole defectively inconherent and unconvincing; specifically (spoilers ahoy) I didn't buy: 1) the locker room scene where Huppert in a big, big shift in previous tone and behavior gives herself to the jock; 2) her impromptu attempt to make love to her mother (ugh); 3) nor the &quot;stab-to-the-heart&quot; ending, which while jarring, is also highly disconnected -- looks to me it was just thrown in for shock value (or craftily, to get people to wonder and talk about it like any respectable artsy film would aspire to). <br />  <br /> However, this film *is* worth a look for the magnificent performance of Isabella Huppert and several unflinching and wrenching (and sometimes disgusting) scenes (not including those already mentioned) which will linger in your memory like limburger cheese on a full stomach. (People might also want to compare this film with Roman Polanski's 1960's _Repulsion_, with Catherine Deneuve, which I thought was a much more effective portrait of sexual repression and descent into madness.)  <br />  <br /> My review here pertains to the R-rated VHS version; I have not seen the unrated version, which presumably contains more wretched excesses, like the vaginal mutilation scene, which is missing here.  <br />  <br />
B0001US8FI|5.0|I have always enjoyed Bruce Lee movies.  He was exceptional in his techniques!  I enjoyed watching his son, sad that his life ended so suddenly.  He would have been good at what he learned from his father.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|Iron maiden fans are a very fervent bunch, but I notice that they're also the first to criticize the hell out of the band when they put out something that the fan doesn't believe is up to par. And sadly, the negative criticism towards the band is NEGATIVE. Hell, tons of &quot;fans&quot; just threw in the towel when Blaze came in without really giving him a chance. Sure, the average person couldn't care less about Iron Maiden and usually sees anything they do as crap anyway, so they don't really count. Fans, however, expect nothing but the best from these guys, I guess that would account for the harsh reviews. Dance Of Death sounds similar in style to Brave New World if you ask me. Some would disagree, coz there are many who like BNW and don't like this, but I think the sound is similar. I do know it certainly doesn't sound like Powerslave. I've been listening to these guys since I was a little tyke in elementary school. They've put out some fantastic albums over the years, and I'm personally willing to let them slide if they don't come out with an album that doesn't knock my socks off like Seventh Son did when it came out. All in all I do like Dance Of Death. It's certainly not the first one I grab when I'm in that Maiden mood, but I do like it a bit more each time I hear it. The first time I listened to it I wasn't very impressed at all, and tried to trick myself into thinking I liked it, but it got shelved for quite some time. But after dusting it off and giving it a chance I have learned to enjoy it. And when you think of the state of metal these days this album seems much better even if it's not up to par. I guess I'd rather hear substandard Maiden over the best of what Trapt has to offer any day. So, is Maiden having a rebirth or are they just washed up? You decide, but at least give it more than one listen before you do.
B0000035E7|5.0|this album (as stated in at least one other review) might be a bit too heavy for new fans to be purchasing first. but once they get eased in with nevermind and the softer unplugged, this album goes down without too many kinks. <br /> <br />in response to another review, the reason downer is also on the incesticide record is because the late great kc thought that people who had the tape version of bleach (w/o downer) shouldnt have to buy bleach in the cd format just to have that song. <br /> <br />other than the slightly eery and often disturbing lyrics, with songs like lovebuzz and swap meet, this album is great.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|&quot;Butterfly Effect&quot; left me speechless. One of the best movies I have seen in the same vein as &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; and almost as good, which is saying a lot being I'm very selective in what movies make it on my &quot;favorite movies&quot; list and &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; is almost unbeatable as the one of the greatest alternative universe themed films that I have seen. I highly recommend &quot;Butterfly Effect&quot; to anyone who likes dark, disturbing films. Also, the director's cut has the best ending, however, the theatrical version's ending is well worth watching as well. Quite possibly the best movie that has come out this year!
B00012FXAE|5.0|Rating: ***** STARS FROM ME.  <br />  <br /> James Cameron's 1986 sequel to the classic Ridley Scott 1979 original Alien movie is impressive in so many ways. The tone of the first is maintained but the general suspense is replaced with far more action which results in a superior sequel but maintinaing the terror of the original.  <br />  <br /> 57 years after being the only survivor of the Nostromos incident, Ripley is found by a Company team of Marines but then hears that the planet that she escaped from has had a colony established but contact is lost and now the marines are sent in to investigate what happened when the contact was lost. They however learn that the species of alien from Ripley's previous encounter are now breeding in numbers and the colony has become their nest and now being trapped there, they must destroy the nest while rescuing a young girl named Newt.  <br />  <br /> This movie is absolutely amazing to the tenth power!! The acting is absolutely incredible, the story is perfect, the sets are amazing, EVERYTHING is near perfection! &quot;Alien&quot; 1979 was impressive enough but this sequel however blows that one out of the water and into outer space with it's storyline. The special effects are really excellent as well.
0761119752|5.0|All of Sandra Boynton's children's books are charmingly illustrated and very enjoyable to read.  This book, PAJAMA TIME is written in such a way that you can make it sound all the more humorous to young children by establishing a rhythmic delivery that will make the child giggle & want to join in the fun. My 3 year old granddaughter loves to hear this book and asks for it over & over.  It's the perfect short story before bedtime, although usually I find that when you read a child one Sandra Boynton book she is going to want to hear another & another; they're just that much fun!
0930289234|5.0|Simply put, Watchmen is one amazing comic.  Its chocked full of symbolism and its full of depth and character that most comics never even come close too.  The writing is incredible and the artwork is breathtaking.  The layout of the panels and the realistic movie-like layouts all add to the appeal of this comic.<br /><br />The idea of Watchmen deals with a realistic view of how the world sees masked crime-fighters.  The plot involves a mysterious murder of a masked crime fighter and the threat of nuclear war.  I dont want to tell anything more about the story for fear of giving it away.<br /><br />If you look at all the reviews you will notice how many people left 5 stars.  Obviously this book is not perfect, however, I give it 5 stars because I feel it is one of the best works in its genres, and it stands out above the rest.<br /><br />I've also read many other reviewers negative comments and I feel that I should try to explain them.  Many people either dislike Watchmen for not being as sophisticated as a real novel, some said it seems outdated, and others dislike it because they dont think it lived up to the hype.<br /><br />First of all, I am sure that Watchmen may have a few plot holes, but keep in mind that it is just a comic book, and it is the first of its genre (sophisticated, adult comics).  Many negative reviewers simply set thier standards too high and compare the book to literary master pieces.  Before you read Watchmen, just remember to read with an open mind.<br /><br />Others have said it seems outdated.  I disagree with this.  Although it is obviously written during the cold war, and this type of comic is much more common nowadays, we must remember to regard it as what it was and not judge it for its time period.  I feel the comic holds up amazingly in todays political and social climate.<br /><br />All in all, an amazing book and a wonderful read.  I would recommend this book to anyone!
B00005JN2F|4.0|A deal is going down in Berlin, Germany.  The CIA is buying confidential Russian information in regards to a mole within the CIA.  Everything goes as planned as the CIA operatives are listening to each word and have a visual of the agent with the money.  Suddenly the light goes off and the mission has disastrous consequences.  When the CIA searches the crime scene for evidence they find a fingerprint that leads them to CIA headquarters and to identify the individual one most have clearance from the highest authority.<br /><br />Thousands of miles away Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) has withdrawn from a public life with his girlfriend, Marie (Franka Potente), to the beaches of Goa, India.  Jason struggles with amnesia, but bits and pieces return to him in the form of fragmented nightmares and dreams.  These fragments seem to be clues about his past and what he has done, and he continuously records his dreams in a notebook.  When Jason returns from one of his routine exercise bouts he notices a man that sticks out in the crowd, which initiates a deadly hunt on Bourne.<br /><br />The cinematography in Bourne Supremacy is brilliant as it moves swiftly using unusual camera angles which generates a feeling of stress and panic. Despite this panicky atmosphere Jason Bourne moves with a directness that resembles a champion prize fighter before a fight.  This displays Matt Damon's good performance in the film where he takes care of business as some do when they pick up the mail form the mailbox.  The editing of Bourne Supremacy is excellent as there are many rapid cuts and jumps from different camera angles, similar to a comic book.  Regardless of being similar to a comic book or not, the editing works its magic as it turns up the tension and produces a highly suspenseful atmosphere.  When the story comes together under the direction of Greengrass the audience has experienced a top notch action thriller that will keep the viewers on the edge from beginning to end.
B00005JN2F|4.0|Is it me, or didn't one of the 3 major TV Networks turn the Bourne Identity into a mini-series with Richard Chamberlain a few years back (okay, maybe a decade or so...)?  I must admit, in order to 'freshen up' the plot by Hollywood standards, they went ahead and committed the cardinal sin of thinking that a movie screenwriter can do better with re-writing a spy masterpiece than the original author.  Putting all that aside, I still enjoyed the movie with Matt Damon as Jason Bourne aka David Webb.<br /><br />Yes, they took some liberty with the storyline -- to the point of almost entirely re-writing it to suit their own purposes.  For the Ludlum purists out there, this is more than an insult, but direct blaspheme.  However, for those who have not read the novel, this was a pretty fun thrill ride of a story.  I am happy to say that everything that made 'The Bourne Identity' a truly thrilling thriller is back in the even more enjoyable 'Bourne Supremacy'.<br /><br />I was VERY skeptical going into this movie because the novel is one of my all-time personal favorites.  But the film-makers wisely decided to make a sequel to the movie rather than the novel in particular.  If you have read it, you will instantly recognize some truly incredible differences: most notably the location for the movie.  It takes place mostly in Honk Kong and China vs. Germany and Russia in the movie.<br /><br />Despite my misgivings with whoever penned the screenplay, I found myself totally absorbed in the life of Jason Bourne.  Fast moving, intelligent and visually stunning, the 'Bourne Supremacy' isn't without a fault or two.  For instance, why on EARTH when Jason knows that he is being hunted, would he use a passport with the name Jason Bourne ON IT??  That would be certain to raise some red flags for the bad guys, right?  And indeed it does.  Again, I am nit-picking but if Bourne is as smart as he is portrayed by Matt Damon, why would he make such a colossal error?  I suppose because it was in the script, right?  Oh well.<br /><br />I must also comment on some of the fight scenes.  For some this may be wonderful, but I found it to be somewhat difficult to follow since the filming was done in such a way that it very nearly seemed as though the camera was literally INSIDE the actual scene.  Disjointed, and jumpy as you can imagine, and for me anyway, quite difficult to follow.  I suppose it even may have been slightly dizzying for some.  Again, some find this to be brilliant filmmaking, I just found it hard to understand.<br /><br />'The Bourne Supremacy' has what I consider to be THE single greatest car chase in cinema history.  Filmed ON location in Moscow, Russia you have to admit that they have come a long way from the days of the Communist Rule when nothing like this would have been even remotely possible.  Absolutely stunning and incredibly done.  Kudos to whoever choreographed this portion of the movie.<br /><br />All in all I enjoyed it very much, but gave 4 stars simply because it was so completely different from the near perfect novel.  Judge for yourself, but if you liked the first, you simply MUST see this one.use it was in the script, right?  Oh well. <br /> <br />I must also comment on some of the fight scenes.

B00005JMJ4|5.0|Incredible!  I have to start this with that word.  I have had several favorite movies, but this one takes the cake!  Entire movie based in Japan with stunning real footage of the lights in the city to make you want to jump into your t.v.!  The acting could not be any better.  Slow moving at times, but to get all points and emotions across as moving too fast in this movie would break it to pieces.  The basic element and entire point of the movie is simple:  Not going beyond a perfect friendship can leave a memory to last a lifetime.  This statement may seem sappy to some, yet you can learn a lot.  Several quotes in the movie I like to take into my own personal life.  If I could live in any movie, it would definitely be this one.  A great price to pay for a movie to watch over and over.  Super great soundtrack, great footage.  Wide or Full-Screen does not matter, they are both breathtaking.  You see things through the actors, as if you were really them.  This is no potato chip movie, this movie is a spagetti and wine and dine movie!  Perfect for a date, alone, family.
1559408855|2.0|Pier Paolo Pasolini wrote the script for Salo and he stayed truthful to Marquis de Sade's novel, which brought the world a unique cinematic experience.  This cinematic experience is still shocking almost 30 years after the films initial release, and is still cause for much debate.  The disturbing images of Salo are cinematically brilliant, yet the story will induce disgust and revulsion in a most horrible way.<br /><br />The story takes place at the end of World War II in northern fascist Italy where four prominent men gather 18 adolescents which they intend to use for their depraved games.  Prior to the beginning of the games the four men recite the rules of the games, which are to be followed or death will be dealt to the rule breakers.  The depraved entertainment is divided into three different categories: Circle of Obsessions, Circle of Feces, and Circle of Blood.  These three categories of sick entertainment are administered by three middle-aged women that disclose dark tales of their pasts while a fourth woman is accompanying the tales with tunes from a piano.  These tales raises an internal passion within the four men to molest, desecrate, and viciously destroy anything of goodness within the surviving adolescents.<br /><br />Pier Paolo Pasolini forces the remaining audience to witness brutality and bizarre behavior.  The audience's testimony to the cruelty on the screen is to provoke a notion that the viewers are accomplices to the cruel crimes committed in the screen while remaining seated watching.  The guilt seems to be on those that view the last scenes suggests this through the use of the binoculars through which the audience can observe ritualistic mutilation, torture, and murder of the remaining adolescents.<br /><br />Salo will remain as one of the most disturbing films ever made as it exploits the violence and degradation of youth.  Enduring the violence and the despicable behavior is torturous, which has no other purpose than to corrupt and destroy.  Cumulatively, Salo is a horrible cinematic experience as it offends, disgusts, revolts, and causes emotional dreadfulness.  Yet, underneath the despicable acts in the film there is a well planned thought, which could easily be missed.  However, it is a thought that should be missed, if you want to remain innocent to the horrors of the world.destroy.

0792841344|5.0|PHANTASM, especially when you consider it was released 25 years ago, is a brilliant film for several reasons. Its chief strength, however, lay in its script. On one level, it utilizes classic horror movie elements: nightmares, grave robbers, the haunting mausoleum and cemetery, the menacing man who watches over everything, etc. But then it incorporates that with classic sci-fi elements: reanimation, the alien race conquering humans, transports into other dimensions, etc. All this, which could have been muddled by someone else is deftly directed with low budget (but very effective special effects) by Don Coscarelli. This edition, complete with interviews and additional footage, is even more enjoyable because of its enhancement of the film's theme which, like \\"Tubular Bells\\" from The Exorcist, remains haunting after all these years.
076790382X|5.0|I read this book a couple years ago, so I don't remember many specifics, but I remember it being one of the funniest books I've read in my life.  I even forced it on a couple of friends.  They loved it, too.  One of the funniest bits in the book that stands out in my mind is about actuary tables and how people get injured.  Bryson tells how, according to these tables, thousands of people are injured each year by bedding.  And there's a funny bit about the ratio of cup holders to passengers in newer model cars.  I highly recommend this book to anyone with a sense of humor.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|Im giving this cd a 5-star rating, because when i bought this cd I only knew of the band by one video that I saw on Fuse, It was Unholy Confessions, but at the very moment i heard that song i had to have the cd.  So when i bought it i was new to the whole A7X scene, and now after listening to this album i cant get enough of it it is by far one of the best albums i have ever heard.  I am a big music fan i like all different styles of rock.  But A7X uses a whole scale of different styles and jams them into one there own.  If you are a punk fan youll love them, if you like heavy metal you will love them, if you are a death metal fan you will love them, they have a lil alternative sound to them as well as others they just fit every expection of a band possible i hope my review on this album helps you out in any way possible!     A7X rocks!!!
B00005JN2F|1.0|I went to see this movie with great expectations.  I loved the first movie and the trailers to this one gave me the impression it was even better.  I was so let down.  The biggest complaint I have about this movie has to be the cinematography!  I was quickly irritated by the constant movement of the camera and anxiously waited for it to quit.  It never did.  In the action scenes the pitiful camera work was exaggerated 10 times.  I thought the chase scene was way too long and at times looked as if the camera was launched into a tornado and all you could see was debris flying by.  The music was irritating, too.  It was loud and spent several minutes at a climax.  The plot, aside from the rest of the obvious irritants, was sub-par and mediocre.  There wasn't much to hold my attention so I was consumed with boredom through much of the movie.  I really like Matt Damon and Julia Stiles, but this has to be the worst director they have worked under.  Julia Stiles' character just kind of disappeared midway through the movie.  Not enough dialogue and not enough story line!  I felt as if half the movie was one long chase scene.  Terrible, terrible movie.  Whether you loved or hated the first one, don't waste your time or money with this one.
B00024I31C|4.0|Cale is an example of a irony who has many victims in the history of Rock and Blues, he belongs to a select group of musicians who has inspired many of the people you probably admired but never receive the recognition than those who learned from the master. In Cale's case the two most famous instances of this are, undoubtedly Mark Knopfler and Eric Clapton -the latter even saying once in an interview that he felt he was the closest thing a British musician can get to Cale, and who turned huge hits out of JJ's \\"Cocaine\\" and \\"After Midnight.<br /><br />This album finds Cale back in great form and, after several years of not visiting a studio, just as laidback and sensual in his playing as in some of his classics from years past. What you can expect is his trademark tasteful picking, solos that say everything they need to say with hardly half of the notes used by the average aspiring \\"guitar god,\\" and a voice that will not necessarily stir you yet it's exactly the way to sing whatever song he's singing.<br /><br />So, no surprises here, no experimenting with new sounds or genres nor the trite parade of guests who often appear and contribute more to an album's marketing but hardly anything to the songs they play in.<br /><br />This is JJ Cale's unadulterated, bluesy mastery of the guitar, again accompanied by a tight band seasoned through his continued touring and playing like they are hanging out in Cale's living room. No pretense, no pyrotechnics, nothing but inspired playing some new great tunes.<br /><br />For those who know Cale already, suffice to say that this is one of the albums they may be most satisfied having purchased. Listen to \\"New Lover,\\" \\"Stone River\\" or \\"The Problem\\" -probably his most political song to date- for proof of that. For something somewhat different, you may try \\"Rio\\" which is touched by some Brazilian overtones but one hundred percent Cale, or \\"Blues for Mama\\" which is likely to be one of his slow and sensuous best songs in along time.<br /><br />Where so many people out there lose themselves trying to change to attract new fans, Cale again chooses to remain himself, to do what he does well, and returns to form-in vintage Cale's style- without even breaking a sweat.le out there lose themselves trying to change to attract new fans, Cale again chooses to remain himself, to do what he does well, and returns to form-in vintage Cale's style- without even breaking a sweat. <br />
B000055X3U|5.0|This is without a doubt, my favorite 'mellow' album I own.  You can really tell Anathema puts all of their heart into the music they create, and it shows on Judgement.  (I also own The Silent Enigma, Eternity, Alternative 4, A Fine Day To Exit, and A Natural Disaster.  I would highly recommend those also).  But Judgement is definately my favorite Anathema album at the time.  There are many other reviewers that have already talked about the album being atmospheric, emotional, depressing, etc., so I won't go on and on.  Just buy the album, or at least take a listen, and decide for yourself.  Though if you don't buy this album, you will definitely be missing out on a great musical experience.
B0000DYJM6|5.0|&quot;Lost Dogs&quot; is a miracle of maturity, honesty and soul. The second disc alone is worth the price of the entire album. Songs that real do not come around often, and it is even rarer to get them from rock stars as huge as these guys. Listening to tracks such as &quot;Fatal&quot; and &quot;Other Side&quot; is like chewing night in your mouth. Layered with a kind of Cure-meets-Mazzy Star atmosphere, the bitter and hypnotizing melancholy of disc 2 is the work of a band whose imagination extends well beyond the borders of &quot;grunge.&quot; This is not just a grunge band; this is a great band, and stunning performances like &quot;Dead Man,&quot; the folkish &quot;Drifting Away&quot; or the ethereal &quot;Footsteps&quot; make that crystal clear. Pearl Jam is the last iconic band of the grunge era to still be putting out music as potent as it was 13 years ago, and it is no minor blessing that they have managed to keep it up when so many others have either met tragic ends, moved on, or simply lost their muse.
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|I really enjoyed watching this movie. They don't have much in common but it reminded me of the movie &quot;The Never Ending Story&quot; a little. If you enjoy a great story tale of a movie then check this one out definitely!
B0001AVZA8|4.0|Diane Keaton gives the performance of her career in \\"Something's Gotta Give,\\" writer/director Nancy Meyers' smart and savvy take on middle-age romance.  Keaton plays Erica Barry, a 50-something playwright living on her own in a swanky beach house in the Hamptons.  Although she has achieved enormous success in her career, her personal life leaves much to be desired.  Erica, though brilliant and attractive, has pretty much shut herself off from the dating scene since her divorce a number of years ago.  Erica's life runs like a well-oiled machine, with each element - both personal and professional - fitted neatly into place, with no room left over for spontaneity or passion.  One fateful day, Erica stumbles upon a strange man rummaging through her refrigerator, a 63 year-old professional bachelor named Harry Sanborn who, Erica discovers to her horror, is dating her 30 year-old daughter, Marin (Harry is, actually, a notorious bachelor, having been profiled as such in a number of tony New York magazines).  Even though Erica is disgusted by the situation, she is forced to take care of Harry after he suffers a heart attack while staying at her place.  Despite their diametrically opposed outlooks on love and romance, Erica and Harry spend quality time together, discover their ultimate compatibility, and eventually fall in love.<br /><br />Meyers has written a witty, sophisticated screenplay that offers insights into any number of \\"battle of the sexes\\" issues.  She has outrageous fun exploring the phenomenon of middle-aged men cavorting with women half their age.  Jack Nicholson, known in real life for doing just that, has a great time poking fun at his own public image while, at the same time, providing a richly textured portrait of a man who may not be quite as shallow as his persona would suggest.  When he so unexpectedly finds his head turned by a vibrant, attractive and intelligent woman in her 50's, Harry, a middle-aged Lothario who finds he needs Viagra to help him keep pace with his youthful \\"conquests,\\" is forced to re-evaluate what has hitherto been the defining philosophy of his personality and lifestyle.  Nicholson is magnificent at showing us the profound confusion his character undergoes as he takes those much belated but faltering steps into adult maturity.<br /><br />Nicholson is, however, only one half of this extraordinary couple.  As the other half, Keaton, having been handed what is clearly the role of a lifetime, has never seemed so natural and self-assured on screen.  She makes of the character a capable, no-nonsense woman who has allowed her passions to lie dormant far too long.  Though, on the surface, she appears confident and in control of her life, Erica is, underneath it all, a woman wounded by past experience and intimidated by a culture that expects women to be put out to pasture the moment they reach middle age.  It is this combination of strength and vulnerability that makes Erica such a complex, recognizable individual - and it is the very quality that Keaton captures so exquisitely in her performance.  The chemistry generated between Keaton and Nicholson in this film is so glowing and palpable one wonders why no filmmaker ever saw the potential of this dynamic duo until now.<br /><br />In addition to these two outstanding performers, the film boasts excellent supporting work from Frances McDormand as Erica's pragmatic, clear-headed sister; Amanda Peet as Erica's level-headed daughter; and Keanu Reeves as Harry's handsome young doctor who finds himself smitten by Erica's mature beauty and charm.<br /><br />\\"Something's Gotta Give\\" is that rare romantic comedy that not only acknowledges the romantic inclinations of people over forty, but also recognizes the emotional complexities of their relationships.  Because both Erica and Harry have been around the block a few times, they bring a lifetime of baggage to their burgeoning attachment.  Thus, unlike in the vast majority of romantic comedies, which are clearly geared to the younger generation, the lovers here have a depth not often encountered when the focus is on two inexperienced neophytes.  It takes the experience that comes from living to make a person interesting, after all.<br /><br />Thanks to the quality of the writing and the performances, \\"Something's Gotta Give\\" takes its place among the great romantic comedy/dramas like \\"Two For the Road,\\" \\"Annie Hall,\\" \\"When Harry Met Sally\\" and \\"The American President.\\"  That's mighty august company indeed.romantic comedies, which are clearly geared to the younger generation, the lovers here have a depth not often encountered when the focus is on two inexperienced neophytes.

B000085RTZ|4.0|After seeking out progressive metal on the net, I found Kamelot..and what a find they are! After getting hooked on Karma, I went out and bought Epica and was suprised to hear an even better CD! <br />  <br /> Thundering double-base drums, technical guitar, and the golden pipes of Khan combined with just the right amount of sweeping keyboards and strings, excellent intelligent lyrics written into a concept album. This band has the power and precision of a well oiled machine! Even the ballads are sung with passion, and the guest vocalists only add to the fabric woven in these songs. <br />  <br /> Epica is lots of things; passionate, headbanging, hard driving, complex. You can pretty much hear it all in the first full song &quot;Center of the Universe&quot;. It's easy to hear these guys pour their hearts and sould into each note. <br />  <br /> I'm simply addicted to Kamelot at the moment. I can't remember listening to a band over and over again without getting bored since Queensryche. <br />  <br /> I rarely give CD's 5 stars. So if you could improve on the Kamelot formula, I'd like to hear just a bit more guitar soloing, and some more improvising from the bass and drums. The talent is clearly there from all members of the band, but I'd like to hear them break slightly from their strict, tight mindset a bit. The production on this CD isn't as perfect as their previous ones, the poor guys probably can't afford the studios they used to (they rarely even tour in the US). <br />  <br /> If you're a fan of power/progressive metal, you cannot possibly be disappointed in this CD!!!!!
B000127LW2|3.0|I remember gathering with friends in January 1995 to watch the very first episode of the new Star Trek series, Voyager.  Drinking some sort of blue punch, I felt great anticipation about what I would see over the following two hours.  And when those hours were over, I was not disappointed.  Caretaker introduced its viewers to a group of engaging characters in an area of the galaxy previously unexplored by the Federation, and that group had a strong-willed captain and a new mission: to return home. <br /> <br />Honestly, I still don't entirely understand Captain Janeway's choice to protect the Ocampa from their enemies and strand her crew, but this would certainly not be her last odd decision.  I suppose some explanation had to be provided for this series' basic premise. <br /> <br />What followed that first installment were fourteen episodes that dealt with the integration of the Star Fleet and Maquis crews (Parallax, Prime Factors, Learning Curve), introduced the creepy but in some ways sympathetic Vidiians (Phage, Faces), and occasionally teased the inhabitants of Voyager with a quick way back to the Alpha Quadrant (Eye of the Needle, and, again, Prime Factors). <br /> <br />Perhaps the characters have always been the strongest aspect of any Star Trek series, and certainly Voyager spent a great deal of time in its first episodes introducing us to principal cast members.  One standout episode in this regard is Heroes and Demons, which gave the holographic doctor his first chance to leave sickbay; another is Jetrel, which provided Neelix with some sorely needed gravitas amidst all the leola root jokes. <br /> <br />The very best episode on this multi-disc set is State of Flux, which revealed one of the Maquis to be a conniving, Caradassian spy.  Martha Hackett plays this character in earlier episodes with subtlety, as a supposed Bajoran who basically just mills about in the background when she's not second-guessing Janeway's orders.  When Seska's true self is revealed, however, the performance modulates into a kind of gleeful meanness that really works and that will continue to entertain well into Voyager's third season. <br /> <br />The extras provided for this set are superb, particularly the scenes of Genevieve Bujold as Captain Janeway.  At this point, it is really impossible to imagine anyone in the captain's chair but Kate Mulgrew.  Other featurettes focus on Mulgrew and various behind-the-scenes goings-on on the Voyager set in its early days. <br /> <br />The shortened season one got the series off to a solid, if not spectacular, start.  Like all the other Star Trek series excluing the first, it would take a couple of years for this ensemble, as well as their writers and producers, to find their stride.  Here we see Voyager's first, significant steps, which I enjoyed watching so much that for seven seasons I never stopped tuning in. <br /> <br />Trekkers and other sci fi fans who've been prejudiced against the series should give it a try.  You'll be very pleasantly surprised at what you see.  Those of us who have long been Voyager fans know exactly why we love this show: the cast and their characters, braving the unknown with spirit, fun, and real determination.
B00009V7T2|5.0|When I bought this record, about a month after it came out in July of 2003, there was an endless ammount of hype about a band I knew nothing at all about. I knew that at the drive in ( who at the time i was never a fan of untill recently) had divided and two bands had spawned from this division, sparta and the mars volta...  <br />  <br /> I had seen sparta live, and was kind of bored even though now i apreciate them alot more. I was wondering what to expect from the other post atdi outfit.. and I was very pleasantly surprised. the first song has a really eerie twinkling to it, and soon after you are just blasted in the side of the head with a passionate performance that does not let up for the rest of the album untill the bitter end.  <br />  <br /> these guys play like they were held at gunpoint in the studio and had to play to save their lives. there is a brooding energy and a certain sadness to this album that is very hard for me to feel in anything else Ive listened to recently. I had no idea that cedric bixler could sing like he does on this record, and instantly that is what stuck out the most for me, the first time i heard this record each song was just as good as the last, and I found something that stood out in all of the songs to make each of them extremely memorable.  <br />  <br /> All of the songs on this album are well written and dynamic making for one hell of an exciting listen the first time through. this is also a serious guitar record, with plenty of lead melodies and finger tapping and solos but its not pretentious, so whether you want to flail your arms around like a crazy person, or just nod your head in apreciation at the musicianship when you listen to music there is something here for you to love.  <br />  <br /> Sometimes the air raid siren vocal approach can turn people off, but some of the vocal melodies that come out of cedric bixler are so heartwrenching and emotional that you are forced to listen.he is very simialar to bjork ( if anyone would actually listen to her voice they would hear it) alot of the songs have very little in common with at the drive in, except for the last track &quot; take the veil carpin taxt&quot; which has the band firing on all cylinders and is very upbeat and melancholy at the same time. these guys have alot more in common with bands like rush but without all the suck, and snobby guitar wankery. these guys absolutely destroy prog rock stereotypes, and they do it without coming off like theyre trying really hard to be some Uber band or something. even someone who likes glassjaw or thursday ( Don't get me wrong I love glasssjaw and thursday) or any number of extreme bands such as converge and botch or cephalic carnage could get into this record, it is so honest that regardless of what scene you belong to, you can give it respect. <br />  <br /> This album is the best 10 bucks ive ever spent on a record and easily the best of 2003 in a year that was full of great albums. I bought this without having heard any of their songs except for a few on the ep ( the new version of cicatriz is much better than the one on the ep and it also has an awesome jam out session with John frusciante from the rhcp) and I have to tell you, for the year or so this album has been out, not one week goes by where I dont listen to it. This is just some of the most passionate and honest music I have ever heard, and it tugs at your heartstrings each time you listen to it. It is just as revealing the first spin as it is the 100th.  <br />  <br /> I love this album so much that I just want to play it as loud as humanly possible and share it with everyone... buy it, its 10 dollars what do you have to lose? honestly.

0385335482|5.0|This is a smooth and fantastic read about a shopaholic who doesn't know what to do. Her love of shopping cannot disguise the fact that she is financially desperate. Yet she buys everything she possibly can. This book, and the two books following it, chronicles her fun adventure, in which she finds romance, bagel with cream cheese and lox, Saks Fifth Avenue, and a &quot;life-changing&quot; lottery ticket.      This is not a literary masterpiece, but it's not supposed to be ! It's an addictive tale, and you can't stop yourself from turning the page. Unfortunately, the gloomy side of shopaholics is a reality to many of us. The pages glue themselves to your fingers. It's one of those books you just can't put down.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|I had great expectations for this film.  I loved Deep Rising and both Mummy movies, am a devoted fan of the Universal Classic monsters, and think Hugh Jackman is a fine actor.  Unfortunately, I was severely disappointed with Van Helsing.  Sommers overloaded his film with entirely too much cartoony CGI, the acting was so overblown and melodramatic that any opportunity for decent characterization was rendered inert, the dialogue was ridiculous, and the main character failed at nearly everything he attempted.  This Van Helsing was supposed to be a Victorian butt-kicker, but instead ended up as little more than a whipping boy, and that is where this film's greatest weakness lies.  If you want to see Hugh Jackman portray a capable hero, then watch either of the X-Men movies instead.  If you want monsters, then watch the original Universal Classics or the 50s Hammer films.  If you want a cartoony CGI nightmare, then by all means, watch Van Helsing. F-
B00006JIA4|4.0|The first two CDs are really great, but the third one completely salvages the two. Remixes of all their great songs, stupid complilations, songs after Freddie Mercury's death, songs featuring other artists... It would have been a lot better if they had added
B00005NC66|5.0|On this wonderful DVD of \\"Breathless\\" the commentary by film critic David Sterritt on Jean-Luc Godard's new wave masterpiece is so insightful that it makes this DVD even more of a must have for any lover of international cinema. It is a delight to hear his enthusiasm for the film, the director and the stars. Beyond that, there is this landmark film that in its new pristine restoration is so fresh and vibrant that it leaps from the screen. It is packed with incredible images of the three major characters of the story, Belmondo, Seberg, and Paris. It all seems to have been shot only yesterday. Jagged and edgy in its famous jump cut editing and with fluid cinematography by the famous Raoul Coutard it is as fresh and exciting as it was forty-four years ago.<br /><br />  The film is full of homage after homage to movies and pop culture of the day that so inspired Godard and many of his contemporaries. All of this is interlaced with a story of two characters so convinced of their independence from society that they cannot see how trapped they are within their self-created images gleaned from the icons of that time and place. All of this is presented with a wonderful mix of humor and suspense that propels the story forward in jerks and leaps through the city. Only when we are in Patricia's apartment does the film switch to long lingering shots of the everyday life of these two people. Then back out on the streets and the frantic chase with the cops and the search for an escape.<br /><br />  Jean Paul Belmondo is simply incredible to watch in this the film that made him and his tough sexy image famous throughout the world. He is so natural, and human as to seem to be caught by the eye of the camera completely unaware in his life as Michel Poiccard. Jean Seberg broke out of her limited Hollywood shell and embarked on her European career with her role as Patricia the American girlfriend of Michel who ultimately and inexplicably does what she must do. It is obvious that Godard and his cameraman adore her and the wide-open eye of the lens lingers on her with the same enamored devotion that Michel reluctantly shows her. With this film she really shows the range of her talent and how good she really was in the medium of film acting.<br /><br />Here are two of the most photogenic faces of the early sixties shot without Hollywood lighting setups. Yet some of the shots have a glamour that Hollywood could not equal in all its artifice. Yet all the time this groundbreaking film never for a moment lets you forget you are watching a movie-movie. Both real and fake it achieves a fantastic reality all its own that changed cinema in profound ways and is still affecting the way we look at and make movies today.his cameraman adore her and the wide-open eye of the lens lingers on her with the same enamored devotion that Michel reluctantly shows her.

0452282152|5.0|This is a gorgeous book (and I don't just mean the cover). It's the story of Griet. Her father would bring back the income for her family as a painter of tiles, but ever since the accident that has blinded him, the family needs money. Vermeer needs a maid, and she is chosen to work for him and his large family.    The book sets flawless images in your mind, meaning Chevalier depicts every word and makes it her own. The details are vivid and you can picture every bit of it. And at the same time it's not too unctuous, and she leaves a wispy essence of mystery, just enough so you can leave some of the picturing to yourself.     Another important and brilliant part of this book is that it's actually believable. It's not overly exagerrated. The characters have all the right emotions so that you can easily figure out just what's going on. The book is just enough of everything so that nothing is too ridiculous or pathetic.
B0000009SE|4.0|I love this album, though it is dense and not a common listen. 'Big Swifty' and the title track are unreal, and Don Preston sounds like Mahavishnu's Jan Hammer on 'Birds of Fire.' Like the other guy said, get the Wazoo and Hot Rats first...this one will take some breaking in but is worth the effort.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This was the first Slipknot cd I bought. It made me into the maggot I am now. The album offers the same heaviness as any other Slipknot cd, but it offers a broader sound within that heaviness. There's more singing in this cd, and the songs have enough variety between each other, that you can hear a 3 second sound clip and automatically know which song it is. Is it an experimental album for the band? Yes. Is it a good album? Yup. It's definitely a buy worthy album. No doubt in my mind. Between the melancholy, almost gothic guitar and vocals of Vermilion and the anthemic Pulse of the Maggots, this album is one of the best experimental albums(along with KoRn's Untouchables)from any band. Ever.
B0000009TJ|5.0|This is up there with 'Live at Birdland/Coltrane,' 'light fuse, get away/Widespread Panic' and 'Between Nothingness and Eternity/Mahavishnu Orchestra' (check those out too!!!!) with my favorite live albums ever.  HDJudy has one of the most dynamic assaults on a fretboard ever, like holdsworth type stuff...the ensuing Ring of Fire and following 3 tracks are a pastiche of this bands unique talents and sound.  Zomby Woolfe has a remarkable, understated frank solo...Bolero is sublime...Zoot Allures has another rippin FZ solo, setting up the best of his playing ive ever heard, Florentine Pogen...Andy is my fav Zappa 'tune' and Inca is so beautiful, that sofa is a cherry on top...dis 2 is much more manic, Eric Dolphy Mem. BBQ is the collest thing I think, just so cool...GET THESE DISCS!!!!
B00000JCOV|5.0|[...]  I don't know where to start with this one. It's just so awesome. Between the screaming metal vocals of Corey Taylor, or #8, the insanely heavy drums with I can finger drum along to till my fingers hurt(literally), and the incredible bass guitar, this album is a complete piece of heaven for any maggot or heavy metal fan. Although the music sounds VERY similar to KoRn(as my rather annoying brother has said more times than I want to count), they score higher in the heaviness department, which is the area that means the most to us headbangers. There's a lot of variety in the songs, whether it be in the almost rap/metal grind of Spit It Out, the line of Spanish and profanity in Me Inside, or the anthemic rebel chorus of Surfacing. A must hear for heavy metal rockers and Maggots alike.
B0000009SM|5.0|This album contains my nomination for best Zappa rock tune, 'Andy.' It is an exquisite song and read Nigey Mouncey's &quot;Being Frank&quot; to get it. 'Inca Roads' has provided hack bands like phish with an eternity of so call improv ideas...while 'Florentine Pogen' is perfectly weird, and would evolve to one of Frank's best solos ('The Best Band You Never Heard in Your Life') Sofa's beauty can not be described, and I fear I am leaving some out, but I hate pedantic reviews which drone, so just buy this one if you have any interest in Frank's return to rock from fusion, creating in essence another category, Rock Fusion.
B00024BHTC|5.0|Ok. Toumas Holopien, the keyboardist, is the one that writes most of the music. The fact that most of the music is created by the keyboardist, gives a different perspective and makes it DIFFERENT for a metal band. First of all, Nightwish has always had elements of different types of music. I own all their material. I'm a metalhead BUT I listen to many other types of music so I don't have prejudices against this band. Most of the 1 star reviews come from the same racist and ignorant moron. The rest of the 1 star, 2 stars and 3 stars reviews, come from metalheads that listen to this comparing it with other metal bands. That's wrong. Always remember that speed and technical quality does not always mean the best music. Nightwish, in my opinion, is not 100% metal. The do have a lot of power metal. Guitar/keyboard solos and double bass. Most of their 3 first albums have a lot of it. But since Century Child, they have been getting into a different style. The guitar almost disappeared and the \\"orchestra sound\\" was more important. The \\"neoclassical Metal\\" began with the guitarist Malmsteen that released some albums in which he played Bach, Beethoven, etc and he did it with the help of and orchestra. However, it doesn't mean that Nightwish is not original. Also, Nightwish changes with the time. They evolve(And that is not common with the power metal bands). This album also has variety. It has aggressive and quiet songs. Also, some songs are into Power Metal again. There are even some moments in which they play progressive Metal. Tarja is solid, like always.  <br /> This band has always been bashed. Fortunately I listen to almost every type of music. That means that I don't have false expectations. The fact that this band doesn't sound like other Metal bands doesn't mean is bad. I'm sorry, but most of the 1,2 and 3 stars reviews come mostly from people that only want something at a million miles per hours. 'Neoclassical Metal' was created before, that's true, but Nightwish isstill unique. The fact that they are Europeans doesn't mean is bad either. That's just ignorance and lack of culture. <br /> Toumas Holopien and Nightwish are still looking for their 'ultimate result'. Holopien's creative capacity is amazing. One thing is clear. We still don't listen to the best of Nightwish.
B0000009S3|5.0|I could vascilate and wax poetic about this album all day. Peaches is a masterpiece, Zappa's heavy solos one 'willie the pimp' on 'son of mr green jeans' made me become serious about being a musician and guitarist. 'Gumbo Variations' is a bit long, but is very focused throughout its 17 minutes, a skill frank had in spades. 'little umbrellas' is proof that to frank jazz (the ever impossible form to crack) was just that, a form. And 'it must be a camel' dips into the fusion which would mark the next two albums, &quot;Waka Jawaka&quot; and &quot;Grand Wazoo.&quot; This album is a masterpiece of intellegent psychadelia, jazz, rock, blues...its all here.
B000002C2E|5.0|A lot of people might say that nothing can compare to Blonde on Blonde, Blood on the Tracks, Highway 61 Revisited, or a handful of other Dylan albums.  I say it does, and in many respects, Time Out of Mind is actually better than anything he's ever done.  Here we have Dylan reflecting on the passage of time and his own mortality, while seemingly being out of his mind(hence the title?).  If you already have several of his masterpieces, but thought he faded out sometime back, add this to the Dylan masterpiece collection.
B0000009SI|4.0|I love Frank beyond words, his music makes so much sense to me and we have amazingly similar senses of humor. I love the title track's bass solo by Jack bruce, and I think 'Uncle Remus' is one of the most beautiful track fank ever wrote, the harmonies are akin to 'Dynamo Hum' or 'Mary Lou;' it is also a powerful condemnation of Frank's view of racial &quot;equality,&quot; in my eyes. The &quot;Yellow Snow Suite is a bit too spoken word for my taste (im an 88 Zappa fan), but many friends love it. Also, a tremendous list of Musicians like Jack Bruce, George Duke and Ruth Underwood.
B00000JY1X|5.0|the fact that this music exists is amazing. The fact that it is so darn good is beyond words. I first heard of this c.d. from a friend who loves synthy pop stuff, not my cup of tea. She begged and plead for me to give it a listen, but somehow I never got around to it, until one night when I was apartment sitting for said friend and could not figure out how to work their c.d. player.  <br />  And upon hearing the first 6 or so songs felt like the biggest idiit in the world. How could I do that to myself for so long. <br />This is seriously one of my favorite records and I do not say that often (read my other reiviews). Sure there is some throw away material, but the whole concept is wonderful, the only thing better is the music. <br />I hope you enjoy this half as much as I do. It might be one of your favorites, too.
B0000009SF|3.0|The first three tracks are relatively uninteresting...'Grand Wazoo' should have been on Waka/Jawaka, its experimental blues/fusion/big band doesn't fit this one.  The two vocal tracks are mediocre IMHO, but Cleetus has many fans.  Then comes Frank's answer to miles' modal/fusion: 'Eat that Question,' a George Duke solo for the ages...then 'blessed relief'...ahhh...frank's 'so what,' featuring Sal Marquez's exquisite turmpet solo...worth it for the three instrumentals.
B00005JLEX|5.0|I have been waiting and waiting for this...I don't care what it costs....I have every episode on VHS....I want the DVD. We love you Jerry!
B0000009SG|5.0|Every track on this disc is hot.  Dirty Love, Dynamo, Montana, Zomby Woolfe and Camarillo Brillo are some of the best zappa rock tracks ever.  Great Ruth Underwood throughout, and this album ahs some real muscular guitar playing.  Brevity is wits native tongue...just get it.
B00006CXXU|4.0|Highly glossed, but highly skilled, Stripped is everything you expect from Christina and MORE!!! This girl has a genuine singing talent, and listening to her pop styles is a true delight. <br /> <br />1.Stripped Intro. Christina promises a glimpse at the real her, without the media hype, as told by her. <br />2.\\"Can't Hold Us Down\\" This single also features rapper Lil' Kim and I really like it. It deals with the sexual double standard.  <br />3.\\"Walk Away\\" Great piano intro. Christina croons like a singer in a smoky club about how hard it is to let go of a love that you know is bad for you. <br />4.\\"Fighter\\" the first single off of Stripped. I love this song! She sings from a very real and powerful place about how a betrayal has made her into a much more capable person. A tongue in cheek thank you note to her enemy. I always want to dance to this song. The beat is terrific and the chorus is unbelievable. By the way, if you like \\"Miss Independent\\" by Kelly Clarkson (which Christina co-wrote) you will love \\"Fighter\\". <br />5.Primer Amor Interlude. En espanol, Christina gets us prepped for Track #6 with an intro. Here is the story of a first love..... <br />6.\\"Infatuation\\" This is another super dance song if you like Latin beats. It is the story of a first love, a beautiful Puerto Rican boy. The beat and sway are infectious. I dance around to this, too. <br />7.Loving Embrace Interlude. Highly skippable, in my opinion. This is used to cool down from the dance beat of \\"Infatuation\\" and smooth things out for Track 8. <br />8.\\"Loving Me For Me\\" Christina's voice is like honey here. A very chill love song. I can see this playing during a seduction. We get a good feeling for her soft side here. <br />9.\\"Impossible\\" Things pick up a little here with Alicia Keys jamming on the piano. It is a very Alicia Keys style song. Christina rocks on this, she reminds me of Aretha Franklin or even Whitney Houston.  <br />10.\\"Underappreciated\\" Again with the old school, Aretha Franklin feel. This song is feeling frustration over a relationship that has gotten into a lax, too comfortable stage. I can see a lot of American Idol wannabes copying this song. This song is fun and good to play at a high volume. The bridge is funky and Christina shows off her range well. <br />11. \\"Beautiful\\" this song got overplayed on the radio, but there's a reason for that. It's sweet, simple and the message never gets old (I am beautiful no matter what they say/ words can't bring me down) I love hearing Christina harmonize with herself. That's a neat effect to add fullness, plus the build of more and more instruments. Great ballad. People could use this as their personal feel-good song. <br />12.\\"Make Over\\" I agree with other reviewers who said this is the bad apple of the album. I always skip it, I think it's annoying. It's a lot of shouting and screaming and not very interesting. The writer should be fired. <br />13.\\"Cruz\\" As if to make up for the previous track, \\"Cruz\\" is the hidden gem on Stripped. This would make a really superb single. I thought at first it might be a cover, because it has a 1970s rock and roll ballad feel to it. Christina is of course, awesome and shows a great deal of versatility here. Storybook quality lyrics (slowly drifting into a peaceful breeze/ tongue tied and twisted are all my memories) about beginning a new chapter of life. <br />14.\\"Soar\\" If you like hearing Christina do with her voice exactly what the title suggests, you will love this track. She holds these notes for an amazingly long time. I am more impressed by her vocal power than any other female pop singer on the charts right now. This is another self-esteem song, a power punch. The instrumentals in the background are wonderful, because they only enhance her voice, rather than compete with it. <br />15.\\"Get Mine, Get Yours\\" Hmmm...you could play this for the second part of your seduction. The story is about just what you think it's about. It's not a bad dance song either. It makes me feel sexy. <br />16.\\"Dirrrty\\" This might have been done just for the sake of an MTV video spot, because it's a little over-tweaked. (Britney style) Nevertheless, you can still have an awesome time dancing to it. Or working out. You will be very sweaty by the end. It's bouncy and rowdy. <br />17.Stripped part 2. One last interlude in which Christina apologizes for not being a virgin, and then apologizes for not being a slut.  <br />18.\\"The Voice Within\\" I think this single is my favorite track on the whole album. But then, I'm a sucker for a really decent power ballad. Christina Aguilera puts herself on my top divas list with this one. It's really great, and might make you cry happy tears. <br />19.\\"I'm OK\\" A song about Christina's past and her abusive father. I can see how it was therapeutic to make it, and delivers a more human element to the album, but I always skip it because it's such a downer. Her voice is haunting, and you can hear her crying while she sings. <br />20.\\"Keep On Singing My Song\\" The perfect ending for this song. I think Pink sometimes tries to sound like Christina on this track. It's one of those \\"the moral of the story is...\\" <br />self-affirmation songs. Again, if you enjoy Christina's vocal power like I do, you will love it.  <br /> <br />All in all, I recommend this album if you are a true pop fan, or if you love to dance, or want positive affirmation music. I especially recommend it if you bought any of the Divas Live or Ultimate Divas albums.
B0002BO0AS|5.0|I bought this Cd not expecting greatness, since I liked but did not love their last CD,  The Stings of Conscience.  However I was totally blown away by the incredible overall sound and equally incredible performances on this CD.  Every song has amazing guitar solos which only add to the amazing energy on this CD.  Adam from Killswitch Engage produced this CD and everything about the way this CD sounds is top notch.  The drums pound, the guitars are on fire and the vocals are a mix of hardcore/death with some nice clean vocals to boot.  It sounds like these guys have been listening to a lot of Iron Maiden and In Flames.  The guitar melodies are very remeniscent of these bands.  This CD lists for 9.99 and can be found for as little as 7.99 in many stores, so no excuse for not buying it.  The Oncoming Storm will appeal to anyone who likes the last 3 In Flames cd's, Killswitch Engage's or God Forbid's latest CD.
0385507755|5.0|It is always interesting to read others' reviews...many did not like Frey's train of thought type narratives, but I found them to be incredibly powerful and to convey his story well. <br />  <br /> When we first meet James, he is a total and complete mess. As we learn more about him, he is even more of a mess in my opinion. But he is surrounded by people who care about him, and some who don't, and his rehab experience is vivid and real.  We also start to see the underlying layers of a good person, one who has done bad things, but is ready to put the past behind him and move on. <br />  <br />James does best at developing the characters who are in treatment with him. You really feel like you know Leonard and Miles and Lilly etc. I was also surprised (for lack of a better word) to see a Where Are They Now at the very end of the book - detailing who had beaten their beasts, and who, sadly enough, had not. <br />  <br /> The book is a reminder of just how bad it can get, and James does a superb job of accepting the responsibility for his problem on his own - NOT blaming his parents or genetics or other external factors. <br />  <br /> A disturbing read at times, but so thought provoking, it kept me glued to the pages until the very end...
B0001ZX0PG|5.0|Of course the performances by Penn, Robbins, etc are brilliant, but it really is the overall feeling this film left me with that makes it worth seeing.<br /><br />This is a deep character study, and poses alot of 'what if' questions. A million movies with a redemption theme have been made, what make Mystic River stand out is its candidness when dealing with the human condition.<br /><br />Abducted at a young age while playing street hockey with his buddies, Dave (Robbins)ends up escaping, and we then see him as an adult- a husband and father. When Dave comes home late one night from the bar, his wife finds him with blood stains, he claims that he was mugged, and that he fought with the mugger. That same night, Dave's niece (Penn's daughter) was murdered. And so the mystery begins. While unraveling this mystery, the three childhood friends find themselves involved in this. I will not say any more regarding the plot, but want to emphasize the extraordinary job done in developing the characters, and presenting the viewer with angles that are seldom thought of.<br /><br />Well-done!
076790592X|5.0|I had heard of this book on Oprah a long time ago, but it didn't interest me.  Finally my curiosity got to me last week, and I listened to it on audio cassette.  It grabbed me right off the bat! Ther were happy times and rough times, like in any life, but Morrie had a great way of dealing with it.  I think it's awesome that, despite his disease, he was willing to impart experience-born wisdon on Mitch.  Also, if you get the audio version, it includes some excerpts of their sessions together.
038551123X|5.0|A great read. A bullet from start to finish. It's not for everybody, as reviews are indicating, sort of need a sardonic sense of humor to get it. Thomas Harris comparisons are not relevant, however -- he's nothing like Harris. The obvious influence here is Jim Thompson's classic &quot;The Killer Inside Me&quot; -- also a first-person story of a serial killer cop who delights in putting on a deceptive front. Lindsay apes Thompson's style down to the use of &quot;Well.&quot; as a paragraph. This isn't to criticize. Thompson is a great influence to have.       One cavet: The first chapter is inexplicably horribly written. It's like something from a different book, some parody of a serial killer novel. Plow through and you'll be rewarded.
0425098532|5.0|This book is one of Christie's less well-known ones.  I know that I had not read it until now, and I thought I had gotten through all of Agatha Christie's Poirot books.  But it is a wonderful mystery story, and written in the true Christie fashion.  There are more twists and turns in a seemingly simple murder case than a small country road.  This book starts with the premise that only one person could possibly have killed the young girl, and Hercule Poirot is brought in to at the very least, not have the murderer's sentence extend to capital punishment.  But in true Hercule Poirot fashion, he finds out that even though it looks like only one person could have done it, there were in fact more options than that.  As I reread some of the Agatha Christie classics, I am overwhelmed by her craftsmanship.  She is the true queen of crime, and no one has taken over that mantel yet.
B0002EXH5O|4.0|Along with Master of Puppets and Seasons in the Abyss, Rust in Peace is one of the greatest metal albums of all time! So when I heard Dave Mustaine was remastering the Megadeth catalog, I HAD to get my hands on a fresh copy!<br /><br />  Let me start with the high notes... The musicianship is OUTSTANDING. The instruments are crisp and clear, with lots of insane riffing and rapid fire drumming annihilation! You can even hear the thumping bass line, which I never heard on the original cassette or CD (except for the obvious bass intros to Five Magics, Poison Was The Cure, and Dawn Patrol). As far as the music goes, the remastered version of RIP certainly delivers! Buuuuuut...<br /><br />  Okay, here we go... For those of you who have never heard Rust in Peace, stop reading right here. Turn your computer off, drive to the store and BUY IT NOW!!! You MUST own this cd!!!  Rust in Peace veterans read on...<br /><br />  Dave Mustaine butchered the vocals!! Did he re-sing them? I'm no sound or recording expert, but I can certainly tell when a beloved recording that I've been listening to since I was 14 years old (I'm 27 now) has been altered.  As everybody knows, Take No Prisoners and Five Magics have entirely new vocals, but upon further inspection, I've realize most of the album (maybe all?) has new vocals as well.  Just listen to the low Vic Rattlehead vocals of Polaris, the chorus of Lucretia, and the jumble of words in Poison Was The Cure... you can tell the vocals are different.  It's very noticeable in the parts where the rest of the band sings back up (\\"The warheads will all rust in peace!\\", and the \\"Hey!\\" part of Lucretia), and since they weren't around for the remastering process, the difference is clear.  And of course, we're all reeling over the butchering of Five Magics (even the printed lyrics are different!).  As far as I can tell, only Holy Wars and Hangar 18 haven't been altered (I'm on the fence with Tornado of Souls).  The vocals sound the same, just louder and clearer along with the rest of the music.<br /><br /> Has Dave Mustaine pulled a George Lucas on us and changed a beloved product just because he thinks he can make it better?  I heard something about Capitol losing the vocal tracks to Take No Prisoners... did the same happen to all the songs?  At least an explanation in the booklet would have been nice.  Are the rest of the remasters the same?<br /><br />  You know Dave, it is possible to remaster an album without altering its content. Just look at Slayer's pre-Reign in Blood catalog... the production is so bad, even the remasters sound like [...] But at least they didn't change the content of the recordings. And that's where the remastered Rust in Peace fails.<br /><br />  Of course you could just pretend the first 9 tracks don't exist and buy it just for the demos and the old unreleased track My Creation (it's only 1:34 minutes long... er, short!). The booklet is actually pretty cool, with an introduction by Dave Mustaine and several band photos from that time period. It seems my particular copy was factory-pressed incorrectly. The lyric sheets to Holy Wars and Hangar 18 are cut in half, with Dave Ellefson's forehead appearing on the bottom of the page, and his neck on the top. Looks like a factory mistake, but I don't mind, it just it makes it a little more rare. Any other fans out there have messed up copies too?<br /><br />  I give the remastered version of Rust in Peace four stars because I can't bear to give such a masterpiece anything less. If not for the new vocals, it would've been an EASY five.
B00009V7T2|5.0|This cd is simply amazing. I always loved At the drive in for their interesting guitar work and original scales and singing lines. Then when they split up i heard some stuff by the mars volta that i didnt think was that interesting. but this cd was a big change for me. It's a piece of artwork, defenitely the best work by the guitarist so far, nevermind the incredible improvement the singer has gone through. At first this record may sound like a haze of millions of guitar riffs that dont make too much sence at first. but after listening to the record 2 or 3 times, everything will start to make sence and you'll understand the true genious of this record. If you're into at the drive in, you might not like the absence of agression and the screaming at first, but there's so much power behind this music without the straight forward rock.. this record is defenitely the most intense piece of work ive heard in a long time
B00005JMXX|1.0|I had the misfortune of seeing this movie in the theater. Although the special effects were very impressive (except for the wolves)it wasn't enough to carry the foolish plot and terrible acting. I am sure everyone saw the ads, and by the money it made in the theater, everyone fell for the hype much like myself. Unrealistic, that word is not quite big enough for this skidmark in movie history. Dennis Quaid is indeed the single worst actor ever to grace the silver screen. His facial expressions and body language are so bad that you will literally break into hysterics whenever he is on. The rest of the acting is definitly garbage, yet is oscar worthy compared to Quaid. Now, the script, what was this dingle thinking? the fact that quaid leaps a crack in the earth and is only able to save his life with a rock hammer, hanging with a rock hammer on a piece of ice with nothing else to grab onto, did i mention the hammer had a plastic handle and he was wearing winter gloves, rediculous. then the rock hammer saves him again later, when he digs it into, hmmm let me think, absolutly nothing, the snow its evidently holding into is being brushed off by flea growlers, yet the hammer holds, and the snow is on top of glass, which, in my expert opinion, would shatter the glass and they would all die. also, its supposed to be so incredibly cold outside, they have to wear all sorts of gear just to stay alive, yet at night, just a plain old fashioned tent is plenty to keep them warm. those are just a few of many impossibilities that exist in this abominable flick. But the main one is that Quaid walks from Pennsylvania to Manhattan in temperatures only seen on the great hole on uranus, colder than the moons of jupiter. come on. i guess you should see this malodorous compost heap, if for nothing else for a laugh. but don't expect anything from it, its absolute balderdash. Buying this movie would be like cupping a greacer and holding it to your own nose, not funny. renting it is like passing wind in an elevator, pretty funny. not bothering with it is like a dutch oven, perfect.
6300267881|5.0|This is a great movie it kinda reminds me of The Shining which when <br />I searched this title out it said to me that this movie was suggested for me since I like The Shining.  Overall I think this  <br />movie is great.
B000002NIW|5.0|The Deftones' debut album, the aptly titled 'Adrenaline', was a heavy onslaught of raw metal. It had a rather lo-fi feel, but that worked to its advantage, as the album relied solely on the band's aggression, not slick studio production. My main complaint with the album is that Chino Moreno's vocals were a bit incomprehensible throughout, especially during the verses, in which he delivered them in more of a rapid fire, spoken word type thing. On 'Around the Fur', he improves greatly, going from soft spoken word singing to his trademark piercing scream. The album is also more diverse, musically, as it contains moody/atmospheric elements from the bands 80's influences (The Cure, The Smiths, etc.)  <br />  <br /> 1. My Own Summer <br />  <br /> The first single is a classic Deftones song. It opens with a killer riff from Stef Carpenter, which is echoed by Chi Cheng's omnious bass work. Chino delivers the verses in a soft, near-whisper..then lets out a series of deafening screams in the pre-chorus ('SHOVE IT SHOVE IT SHOVE IT!!!'). The chorus is melodic and catchy.  <br />  <br /> 2. Lhabia <br />  <br /> A heavy song in which pounding riffs in the verses lead into a slightly more melodic chorus.  <br />  <br /> 3. Mascara <br />  <br /> The most radical thing they had done at this point in their career. Very Cure-influenced, especially in the slow, haunting verses (the chorus is heavier, but still somewhat subdued compared to typical Deftones songs). The bridge is also creepy, in which Chino sings 'It's too bad..you're married...to me..'. Amazing vocal delivery. <br />  <br /> 4. Around the Fur <br />  <br /> The title track kicks off with a hypnotic drum pattern from Abe Cunningham. The verses contain Chino's 'normal' singing, which is a soft, almost eerie delivery..then, heavy screaming in the pre-chorus, and a heavy but melodic chorus.  <br />  <br /> 5. Rickets <br />  <br /> Possibly the heaviest song the Deftones ever recorded (although there's a few other contenders). Chino's vocals range from a gutteral whisper to downright screaming, and the guitar riffs never let up.  <br />  <br /> 6. Be Quiet and Drive (Far Away) <br />  <br /> Widely regarded as the greatest Deftones song ever. Not my overall favorite, but it's right up there. It's heavy, but Chino's soaring vocals are gorgeous and captivating. It has one of the best main guitar riffs ever (which Chevelle blatantly ripped off not too long ago). Proves that music can be heavy but still harmonious and beautiful. <br />  <br /> 7. Lotion <br />  <br /> The clearest link back to 'Adrenaline', as Chino sort of speak/sings the vocals in an indecipherable manner. The chorus is another heavy but catchy one. A great song, another really heavy one that doesn't let up. <br />  <br /> 8. Dai the Flu <br />  <br /> Possibly my favorite Deftones song ever..an underrated gem. The verses are mid-tempo, and feature creepy, with ambient touches from turntablist Frank Delgado. The chorus is heavy, gripping and totally memorable. The bridge is also awesome, featuring some layered vocal effects.  <br />  <br /> 9. Headup <br />  <br /> Another 'Adrenaline' type song, which features guest vocals from Max Cavalera (from Sepultura, and later, Soulfly, the latter of which is name dropped in the song). It's really intense throughout..really no touches of melody, but it's an awesome song, another favorite of mine. I still have no clue what Chino is barking in the chorus, but cool nonetheless.  <br />  <br /> 10. Mx <br />  <br /> Yet another favorite Deftones song of mine. They really placed the best stuff last. This one is pretty slow for Deftones standards, but still has some pretty heavy riffs and what not. In the verses, Chino trades off vocals with a female (who I believe was Abe or Chi's wife), in a conversation like manner. The chorus is another soaring performance from Chino.  <br />  <br /> If you fastforward about 30 minutes, you get to a hidden track called 'Damone'. It's a pain toget to..but it's a great song worth listening to. Loud and scorching.  <br />  <br /> On their next album, 'White Pony', they added even more atmospheric elements, creating a rather subdued effort (but still heavy for music in general). It's another excellent album (regarded by many as their masterpiece), as is the sonic, layered metal assault of their most recent eponymous album. But I still think 'Around the Fur' is their best listen from start to finish, as it finds the perfect medium between the raw power of their 'Adrenaline' era and the theatrical moodiness of their later work. <br />  <br /> Best Songs: Dai the Flu, Headup, Mx, Be Quiet and Drive, Mascara.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Moreover than any of Miyazaki's other work's, Nausicaa is the closest to my heart. Without this film I would truly not be the person that I am today. It literally changed the direction of my life - inspiring me to begin studying animation at an early age and setting me down the path towards becoming the award winning filmmaker and professor of animation that I am today. <br /> <br />Though each of his films might be an opus unto themselves, only one was able to touch me so significantly at that early age nearly two decades ago - this film.  It is long overdue and well worth the investment.
B00000I41G|5.0|I was in a trendy, yuppy club in Sydney's Darling Harbour one night a number of months ago. The atmosphere was radiantly buzzing with the excitable banter of the young professional set. A working class boy like myself sat in a corner slightly bemused, nodding and smiling at all the right moments, but otherwise absorbed in the music that was drifting from the speakers like a blue haze, sifting around the room and settling into a fine mist around my soul. The music was none other than Mr. Kenny Burrell's Midnight Blue. The irony is that none of the people around had even the slightest clue of what they were listening to. Completely indefferent, they talked and they chatted, laughed and drank expensive cocktails. I felt like grabbing each and every one of them by the shoulders and shaking them, screaming at them to try and penetrate their glossed over, trendy, Mr. Cool guises, 'This is some of the the most sublime music that was ever created, you baboon. How can you be so impervious to it's magic. Bow down and worship his greatness, you fools, you make me sick!' The only thing stopping me was that I knew that the only response I would receive would be an ambivalent, confused and sorry-assed stare. And so I continued to sit there with my eyes half closed, swaying from side to side, in a blissful state of guitar-induced nirvana.  <br /> <br /> Dont make me grab you by the shoulders, give you a shake and hurl abuse at you. Buy this album and become initiated.
B00006LPER|1.0|This is the number one worst movie I have ever seen. I usually love French films and enjoy the unprudish and free attitude in most of them, but this one went too far. I wanted to leave the theatre, but I was too transfixed in horror to move. I gagged, I winced, I covered my eyes, but still I couldn't move. After the torture was finally over I felt shellshocked and needed to go home and watch The Lion King to recover. It was a glimpse into the world of a sad, demented, and twisted character that I did not need to see. There was no point to this movie and I felt that it existed purely for shock value with no lesson, point or true plot. If you value your time do not watch this movie.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|I eagerly bought an imported version of their album before it was released in Oz after hearing all the buzz about them bubbling up from all the usual Indie scene sources. I was not disappointed. This album absolutley rocks. When I first threw the disc in my CD Player I sat back relaxed, serenely taking in Alex's sexy voice at the beginning of Jacqueline only to sit forward suddenly when the bassline kicked in, adrenaline coursing through my veins. <br /> <br />And the excitement doesn't diminish for a single song throughout the entire album. Take Me Out with it's synthesis between Rock and Disco is bound to put a smile on your dial and make you tap your foot. This Fire will remind you of growing up in the Eighties, singing along mindlessly to Pop/Rock anthems. Darts of Pleasure will make you want to seduce the next person you see. And 40' will make you think you dreamed the whole damn thing. <br /> <br />I had the extraordinarily, fortunate opportunity to see them live last week at the Metro in Sydney (Both gigs sold out within an hour). Their live show totally blew me away. They look like complete and utter dorks. The kind of kids at school that everyone used to ignore. But goddamn! Just try to ignore them now. You can not help but laugh your arse off when they start their exuberant rock gyrations, nor can you take your eyes away from the spectacle, either. I love it when you can tell a band is having a fantastic time on stage and these guys looked totally stoked to be here.  <br /> <br />Do yourself a favour. Buy the record. Then make sure you go see their show.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Dr. Satan, you seem to think you know Mel's motivations. I think you're speaking through your jaded perceptions. When Mel started work on this film, he ponied up his own money. He didn't even have a distributor for the film, but he went on with the production. He filmed a movie in two dead languages. He has spent another $10 million of his own money to build a church building in his hometown. His actions show him to be a devout man.  <br />If he were only concerned with profit he could have churned out another Lethal Weapon movie. His films and him personally have already made a mint. <br />I saw The Last Temptation of Christ, aside from the final sequence when He comes off of the cross, the movie not very risky.
B00005MAM2|3.0|I love Akira...it was the second anime I ever saw and was just so awesome to see. I had bought a VHS copy a long time ago and it was just my prized position. When the dvd came out I was like this is a must have!!! I got it and saw they  had revised a few things...some good...but one thing really bothers me imparticular is the fact that someone in their greatest of wisdom decided to change the original dialouge and the original voice actors...what the crap? Alot of great lines are taken out and replaced with very cheesy ones. I was to say the least sad. So everytime I introduce a friend to Akira I whip out the VHS version...hehehe

B00005B36H|5.0|It seems that music nowadays is all about having 'something that you can shake your ass to'. As long as it has that than who really gives a damn about what is said? Well, here is an album for someone who's ass is a little tired from all that shaking and who's mind is a little tired from its lack of use. An album that is thought provoking and leaves each listener with his/her own conception of what is being said. And the great thing is -- no one is wrong. What a novel concept -- everyone's opinion is right...wow, who whoulda thunk it, eh? This album is great from beginning to end. More of a musical variety than AENIMA in the since that Tool can be more than just 'hard as hell', LATERALUS has somewhat lighter, melodic moments that are, well, beautiful. PARABOL and DISPOSITION for example. But all of you out there who think that Tool has gone soft, don't fret. TICKS AND LEECHES will put that motion to an immediate end. LATERALIS has to be the shinning moment in this whole experience. And that word pretty much somes up this album...it's more of an experience than anything. And to me, it's an experience that is life changing and well, perfect.
0778320448|5.0|A delightful tale of four women, united by a knitting class where the first beginning project is to knit a baby blanket. That's it, a simple project.  <br /> <br />But it becomes far more than that. Debbie Macomber uses this simple task as a window into into the lives of four women in the class. She uses this setting to explore relevant women's issues with unexpected insight and sentiment along with being a delightful yarn (sorry about that, but I had to).  <br /> <br />Debbie Macomber is a knitter. She gets together with friends to sit and chat while working on projects. This is a very female form of bonding, perhaps the female equivalent of the guys going hunting. It's strange how we always seem to be going back to our cave man roots.  <br /> <br />Her characters are diverse, united only by the baby blanket. Her characterizations are real, based on real people, with real lives, real families, real problems.  <br /> <br />If you're a Debbie Macomber fan, you will not be dissappointed. If you're not, this is a good place to start.

B00004RGUI|5.0|The piano is so beautiful and sweet! It takes you miles away to the heart of forest, where there are big waterfall and cool stream. I highly recommend this. This is my favorite Solitudes album.If you would like take yourself out of the busy work to a paradise forest, get this CD.
B000002JR8|5.0|This is by far their best album, athough Vulgar is very good also. 5 minutes alone and I'm Broken are my favorites, just straight hardcore metal. The rest of the cd is just as hard and angry. <br />  <br /> Looking through the reviews, I see someone gave it a 2 stars and says he doesn't even like metal. If you don't like metal don't review it. I could go through every rap album and give it a 1 star, because I think rap doesn't even qualify as music. <br />  <br />
B00004U2G4|5.0|Yes, the Jeff Beck Group should have been the New Yardbirds, a title snatched from them by Jimmy Page and Led Zeppelin. But it's not because they couldn't stay together. They couldn't write. Truth and Beckola are chock full of cover songs. They had guitar vituosity, superior vocals and an incredible band. One of the great live shows in the history of rock. Meanwhile Page and Plant were churning out rockin' blusey originals. They couldn't write and that's why they weren't Led Zeppelin.
B000000OQF|5.0|Axl's vocals are amazing, Slash is God!!!! If you like good music, buy the album. You will not be dissappointed. I promise.
B00005NC66|5.0|Yes, yes, of course Breathless is a great film. What amazes me is that no one has yet complained that this disc features only the FULLSCREEN version. What?? If they can give *Starsky and Hutch* a widescreen edition, why not Breathless?  To not be able to experience the full frame of Godard's most well-known work is ridiculous. Cinephiles of the world, unite and demand a new, more comprehensive release. Why hasn't Breathless yet been enshrined in the Criterion Collection canon? Who will save this seminal work from its current limbo in a land formatted to fit your tv screen? For your own good, and ours, don't purchase this shoddy version of a great flick until Fox gives it the treatment it deserves.
B00005B4GU|5.0|I love this album so much. Not many people have even heard of this release by Radiohead (at least where I live), but I personally think it's their best CD, even compared to The Bends. Now is the question I've always wanted to ask: am I the only one who feels the need to jump around the room when I hear music so good that it swells in my stomach? Even if I am, you know that that's what this album does to me. Buy this album, and hope that you live alone...otherwise you might be caught dancing around your room.

B00005Y7KX|1.0|This musical is a pain to watch. It insults anyone's intelligence.
B00003CWL6|4.0|Finally, an honest look at the American family. The Burnhams are certainly no Brady Bunch. It's a movie about life's ups and downs, family, relationships, dreams and desires, growing pains, mid-life crises. It's a great flick for those viewers that don't take their films sugar-coated. BOTTOM LINE: Definetly a bitter pill to swallow, but it is puncuated by moments of beauty as well as sorrow. Overall, it'll make you take a good look at who you are and what you want. I could've done without the whole plastic bag part, though. Kinda cheezy. GRADE: A-
B00005NB0H|5.0|People tend to love or hate the Who.  Some of their best music--'The Who Sell Out,' 'Quadrophenia'--is somewhat inaccessible, and what were once cutting-edge studio techniques and methods have aged poorly in certain cases.  The singles from their best studio album, 'Who's Next,' are overplayed on classic rock radio, and their inability to resist trotting out the oldies on overpriced reunion tours, the conversion of 'Tommy' to a Broadway musical, and the cynically commercial decision to sell the rights to some of their best hits for use in Hummer commercials and as TV-show themes have certainly cut into the Who's 'hip factor' in the current era.  <br /> <br />This is why 'Live at Leeds' should be essential listening for anyone wondering what was so great about the 'orrible 'Ooo.  Here we have the group at their live-performance peak.  Townshend is often slagged as a weak guitarist when compared to the other guitar titans of his age (particularly Jimmy Page and Clapton), but what those critics fail to consider is the amazing athleticism of his live performances and the aural power of his windmilling riffs between empty space--space Page would have filled up with mindless noodling.  If being able to play notes fast made one great, you'd have a poster of Yngwie Malmsteen on your wall (haven't heard of him?  Well, that's sort of the point).  Even Page himself expressed embarrassment about the endless and pathetically self-indulgent half-hour guitar solos on the recently released CD/DVD 'How the West Was Won.'  Townshend can play hot leads when he needs to, but he rarely does, given the depth and sensitivity of his songwriting and the presence sidestage of the Ox, John Entwistle, arguably the best rock'n'roll bassist ever, one of the few of his era capable of making the bass a lead instrument.  Daltrey was coming off of his canonization at Woodstock and finally had both the confidence and the vocal range to become a commanding front-man, and Moon's drumming is wild, improvisational, and inimitable.  On 'Live at Leeds' they are in peak shape, and the raw energy of the set overshadows the occasional flub (usually on the part of Daltrey or Pete, who tended to screw up while leaping around or posturing for the audience while Moon and the Ox concentrated on playing).  High points on the deluxe re-issue include a brilliant medley of 'My Generation/See Me Feel Me/Listening to You/Sparks', 'A Quick One', and a simply smokin' 'Young Man Blues.'   <br /> <br />Despite the misgivings of some hardcore Who-philes about breaking up the concert's original set order, in which 'Tommy' usually came at the midpoint rather than as the finale,  putting 'Tommy' alone on a separate disc seems to me a wise choice, as it favors folks who haven't had the pleasure of hearing the rock opera performed live in its entirety.  It's certainly fair to be critical of the Who's commercialism in the last fifteen years, but the fact is that this 2-disc re-issue set is probably meant more for folks who are just discovering the Who, rather than longtime Who-philes and collectors (a serious Who collector would have had a bootleg of this thing for years anyway).  Besides, if it's that damn important to you to hear the set as it was originally played, burn it on to your computer and rearrange the tracks yourself.  Personally, I'm thrilled to have a remastered, soundboard quality CD of 'Tommy' live, and will probably never listen to the studio version again because of it. <br /> <br />If you're someone looking to find out what the Who was all about, this is definitely the best bang for your buck, for two chief reasons: it covers a wide period of 'Who-story' from 'My Generation' through 'Sell Out' and 'A Quick One' on up to 'Tommy,' and it gives you the live Who--certainly the most energetic and compelling live act of their era, and arguably the best live rock act of all time--at their peak.
B00020X88O|5.0|After reading all of these disgraceful and untrue reviews, I decided I'd post my own. Some of you may think &quot;Is he serious.&quot; Actually, I am. I am the biggest &quot;Showgirls&quot; fan in the world, and I am writing this to bring this movie justice. <br /> This box set is actually a joke, because it encourages a mockery of the film, especially by including the Fool &quot;David Schmader.&quot; <br /> This film is for people who are positive, who love art, who are crazy/wild, who like to dream, and who understand what a good flick is. It includes some of the best dancing, great make up, beautiful women, a really great storyline that ends with a very good moral, signature dialogue that will be stuck in your head, really nice shots, and &quot;Elizabeth Berkley&quot;. Who knew Jessie Spano could dance like that. She did a brilliant job.  <br /> This film will inspire you to hang on to your values, and it truly provokes. Don't listen to what everybody else is saying. Men have NO TASTE!!! Judge it for yourself, and WATCH IT ALONE!! <br /> Thanks DARLIN' <br />
B000001GPX|5.0|I own recordings of the Beethoven Symphonies with Karajan/BSO, Gardiner/Orchestre revol., Rattle/VSO and Wand/NDR. I like the Gardiner very much, love the Rattle, I adore Wand (have been in all of his concerts in his last years) but after listening to THIS 5th I really can say that I have reached the culminative climax. You can hear the VSO players sitting on the edges on their chairs and playing with every bit of their body and soul. Never heard the first 4 notes so brilliantly played and conducted and it continous being most excellent from there on.   Kudos and in memoriam to this great Conductor.
B00006GFAB|5.0|Buy this CD now! This is a very good purchase, even if you have most or all of the songs. The production is great. I recently saw Kiss in concert with Poison in Atlantic City. The show was great, and the band still rocks! What are you waiting for? Go buy it, loser!
1587990717|4.0|I enjoyed this book on many levels, but in some cases disagreed with it. My only major issue was his assumptions are that every probability bet is ALL IN. While, this may be true with some and possibly many people (traders), I find this trait only among greedy fools.<br /><br />The problem with the character \\"John\\" who \\"blew up\\", was not randomness, but his inability at managing capital and hedging risk, both of which \\"John\\" failed to understand. Taleb, instead focuses on the \\"black swan\\" event and that John will and did \\"blow up\\". True, but that only happened to him because he was ALL IN and not hedged. Capital management and the understanding / ability to hedge/negate risk are a large part of the equation that Taleb leaves out. If \\"John\\" was not all in and hedged his position, he would still be around. \\"John's\\" lack of understanding these two principals (capital management and risk management), along with Taleb's point of understanding probability is why he \\"blew up\\".<br /><br />By never really touching capital management and hedging, Taleb leaves out some very important elements. I understand that this is more of an essay of our general inability to understand probability, but when making trading analogies one must include all disciplines as to why someone makes or looses money.<br /><br />I do agree, 95% of traders / hedge fund people I have meet are shot takers, with little understanding of probability, risk, and capital management. Most people I have met are like \\"John\\" in the book. I have found only a handful of traders that have been able to apply the three disciplines (probability, capital management, risk management) successfully and continue to make money.<br /><br />When discussing Volatility Risk he leaves out a vital element, the measurement of volatility change. , thus failing to tap the idea of our perception and ability to analyze volatility risk correctly.<br /><br />As an options market maker and trader, his trading style goes against every example he gives in the book, which was quite bothersome. I understand he was possibly trying to simplify examples. He uses the lottery winner example as the long shot bet. He then mentions that his trading style is to buy OTM puts betting, very short term, on a catastrophe (black swan event), which is also a long shot bet.<br /><br />He fails to mention two (higher probability) ROIs are  insurance underwriters and casinos. Of course there is ALWAYS a possibility of a \\"Black Swan\\" event, however proper traders, insurance, and casinos SHOULD always hedged against these positions, thus limiting there losses.<br /><br />My criticisms are to show that there are traders that sometimes bet against \\"black swan\\" events and can be successful, however a understanding of probability, hedging, and associated risks are a necessity.<br /><br />I have many short premium positions (option seller), however these positions are hedged with predefined risk. Only a fool would carry a naked short option position (\\" to collect $1 and risk 100x that amount\\"), but he infers that all option sellers are fools and will \\"blow up\\", true if the are all naked short option sellers.<br /><br />Question: If a short option for a net of $1 profit is HEDGED with $4 of risk and the implied probability curve of .10 for the max loss of $4, would you do this trade every month for 1 year?<br /><br />Follow up questions that you would not see in the book are:<br /><br />How much will your net capital be effected by the $4 of risk?<br /><br />Based on that, how large do you put on the position?<br /><br />With the last question being, what other risks do you have and how do you manage the $4 risk and other risks?<br /><br />Taleb, would not ask the follow up questions, he would simple assume that the character \\"John\\" would make this trade every month with ALL OF HIS MONEY. Well, of course \\"John\\" will \\"blow up\\" in the end.<br /><br />Yes, I will take losses, but they are defined and the probability of the event is \\"unlikely\\", not impossible. Understanding the ability of hedging and thus limiting capital exposure on a \\"black swan\\" event, reduces or nullifies your risk. A sound trader should never have \\"blow up\\" risk on their sheets. If they do the failure is with the firm and risk manager.<br /><br />In my office I have a saying on my desk, which could be an alternative title to this book.<br /><br />\\"It may be improbable, but not impossible!\\"<br /><br />I would recommend this book to any trader in the market, but one must understand that there are always two bets, the place bet (buying options - paying the vig) and the underwriter (selling options - collecting the vig). One is not right and the other is not wrong. It is all based on probability and your ability to understand the risk vs. reward and the ability to hedge, whether it is covering premium risk or delta risk.<br /><br />The book is a great introduction to the perception of probability, unfortunately too many examples are based on the ALL IN approach which will always mean that they are \\"Fools of Randomness\\"probability of the event is \\"unlikely\\", not impossible.

B0002KQNL8|4.0|I loved Dan O'Bannon's original Return of the Living Dead - it's such a delirious, crazy, humourous and totally OTT movie with great comic acting from the entire cast, numerous set-pieces to cherish, and catchphrases that still make me chuckle to this day... There's nothing quite like the original - and, sadly, that includes this sequel... <br /> When Part II was released in cinemas I was straight in there, despite O'Bannon not being behind the camera, but I must admit I was horribly disappointed at the time. The tone was completely different, the ghoulish punk soundtrack absent, the script less sharp ... it just seemed like a lame re-hash without any of the original's spark. <br /> So why the 4 stars? Well, despite being a disappointment when compared with the original, time has been kind to this one ... or, rather, the films that have come after it have been so much worse they make this one look good! I had this discussion with a friend recently after watching this again on VHS, and we both agreed that they sure don't make 'em like this anymore, and that's a crying shame. The passage of time has mellowed the disappointment I felt on first seeing it, and judged on its own merits there's much to enjoy here, including the return of the original's central comedy double-act (same actors playing different characters), lots of goofy zombie humour, and of course there's that memorable Michael Jackson Thriller gag... <br />Overall, it's only half as good as the original was - but it's still twice as good as anything of the sort that came after it.
B00000099Y|5.0|In my opinoin this is the best Tool album I think there is not one bad song on here.
B000286S8S|5.0|This is a really good Van Halen compilation.  While it does give us all of the goodies up to this point, I was a bit disappointed that HUMANS BEING was left out.  It was a lesser hit for the band, but even so, it still was a hit and deserved to be included.  Another problem I had with it was in the liner notes, all references to David Lee Roth were left out.  Why?  Even though Hagar is the frontman of the band now, Roth was really the one who, along with Eddy Van Halen, really shaped and molded the band...and got it to stardom.  There should have at least been some pictures or other reference to Roth.   <br /> <br />Other than that, this is a good compilation for those who know all the songs already, or for those new fans who need a good retrospective.  A definite must buy.
0517201658|5.0|This is one of those books that you read and think &quot;yes, I will read this one again one day.&quot; This story is epic in detail and spans three generations of the Cleary family.<br /><br /> This is really Meggie's story. She is one of the main characters that we follow as she finds love where it is least likely to grow but is unstoppable. She falls in love with Father Ralph and the feelings despite being wrong are returned. This is really a story that will have you laughing and crying. Set in Australia in 1915 Ms. McCullough writes vividly and eloquently and you will find this a hard to put down read. This is truly a classic in every sense of the word and one that I highly recommend.
0140271791|5.0|This book has been purchased and given away to 12 different friends. I recommend it to anyone that has seen the addictive personality up close and have had addiction professionals use it as a fun guide to recovery. I love all of Marion Keyes books, but this one and Last Chance Saloon are my favorite rereads. I haunt the bookstores waiting for every new book to hit the shelves and share my joy with my reading girlfriends. Thanks for the joy!
B000002H70|5.0|Many years later, this CD is still one of the best ever made.  It is definitely the Cure's best, although Standing on a Beach, Wish, and Pornography are also excellent. Every song is awesome...meloncholy, brooding and beautiful. I am more into hard stuff now such as Lamb of God, Opeth, Tool, In Flames, Katatonia, Killswitch Engage, Hypocrisy, Amorphis and Into Eternity (and many others), but I always find myself listening to this album once a month or so.  It is flat out one of the best CD's ever.  If I had to make a desert island CD list (only 10 Cd's you could take to a desert island to be stranded upon forever) this would be one of them without a doubt.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Avril Lavigne never said once that she was a punk. That is what she was labeled because of the way she dresses. She was labeled the Punk Princess, not by choice! No matter what you hear about her personality, this CD is nothing short of a masterpiece. It is excellent, she worked hard on it.  <br />  She wrote everysong on here, and sang everyone to the way she was happy. Every song on hear I could listen to. Just as good as her last album, or what am I saying..Its better. She has grown up over the 2 years, and I hope you guys realize it. Critics say noting bad about it, except for people that don't like her because guys drual over her, so you people that say bad things, get over....I RECOMMEND THIS CD 100%! <br />
B00006879E|5.0|When the CD first came out, I hadn't even registered the band at all. I had heard &quot;Harder to Breathe&quot; on the radio a couple of times, and while I thought it was a good song, I didn't give it or the band any serious consideration. But when I was given &quot;Songs About Jane&quot; for my birthday, I sat down and listened to it from beginning to end.  <br />  <br /> And I am glad I did. Maroon 5 is an addition to the bands that have recently come out, with catchy, well-written songs and expressive vocals. &quot;This Love&quot; is unbelievably addictive, and &quot;She Will Be Loved&quot; is sweet and tinged with a little sadness. There really isn't a low point in the whole CD, and there isn't a track I find myself skipping at any time.  <br />  <br /> I fully recommend this to anyone who wants to hear good music. :)
B00005JN2F|5.0|A film by Paul Greengrass<br /><br /> &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot; is the sequel to the 2002 film &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot;. Both films are adaptations of Robert Ludlum novels, but this adaptation may be a bit looser than the first film because it has to maintain any plot and story changes that were first introduced in the first film. A film has to be able to stand on its own, separate from the book, and since I have not read &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot;, I can only judge the film on its own merits. There are quite a few.<br /><br /> In &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot;, Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) was shot and left for dead. When he awoke, he found that he could not remember anything about himself or his past. The film became his quest to find out who he is, and why people are still trying to kill him. What he discovers is that he was a former agent of the CIA, a trained killer, but that is who he was, not who he is. All of that training was imprinted so deeply in him that even though he couldn't remember who he was, he was able to call on that training when the situation required, and it was required often. By the end of the film, Bourne had made his break from the CIA and warned them to leave him alone, because even a hint of the CIA on his trail would bring the wrath of Bourne upon them.<br /><br /> The story picks up in &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot; a couple of year later in Goa, India. Bourne is living with Marie (Franka Potente), the woman from the first film, on the seashore. He still can't remember much of his past life, though he has nightmares that gives him hints that there is something more, something deeper that he is missing. That something starts creeping up on him when he spots a man in the marketplace who shouldn't be there. The man is nobody that Bourne recognizes, but Bourne knows that his cover is blown and that he is in danger again. Bourne's assumption: The CIA is after him again, and this means that Bourne is going to take the fight to the people responsible.<br /><br /> What the viewer knows, and Bourne does not, is that the CIA is not after him, at least not yet. Somebody else is targeting Jason Bourne, and that same somebody else is also targeting the CIA by framing Bourne for a double murder of two CIA agents. This adds an additional layer onto the story because as both Bourne and senior CIA operative Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) are in the midst of a potentially deadly &quot;dance&quot; with each other, the viewer knows that something else is in play.<br /><br /> For those tired of how tedious the James Bond franchise has become, may I suggest the Jason Bourne franchise. The series is going in a completely different direction than James Bond, as Bourne wants nothing more than to be left alone with his fractured memories, but as an entry into the genre of the &quot;spy/espionage&quot; film, the two Bourne films are a breath of fresh air. Why are they a breath of fresh air? Because they are both exciting and interesting movies.<br /><br /> Not having to spend as much time setting up the story as its predecessor did, &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot; is an extremely fast paced, exciting movie. This time Jason Bourne is the one driving the story as he tries to get to Pamela Landy and the CIA and stop them from going after him. This time it is self-preservation that drives Bourne, rather than self-discovery. Bourne is pushed back into a life that he wants no part of, but he is prepared to do what it takes to be able to put the life behind him.<br /><br /> Matt Damon embodies Jason Bourne seamlessly. There is a palpable sense that Bourne is a dangerous man even when is sitting silently, or walking down a street. Damon would not have been an actor that I would have expecting this transformation from, but he works as an action star as well as a spy capable of such violence. This leads me into the style of the action itself. The camera work/editing is jolting and jerky. When Bourne fights, I got asense of the speed and intensity of the fight, but I also felt jerked around too much by the camera. The cuts were too quick, and too glaring for my taste, but were still effective for the movie. It just made some sequences harder to follow than may have been necessary.<br /><br /> There is a frantic pace to the film that is appropriate to the type of story that is being told, but the best scenes are those were the characters are standing around talking. Scenes with the CIA agents, or between Bourne and the CIA, are what the story is built on and do not slow down the pace or the tension in &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot;. There is still one more Jason Bourne novel written by Robert Ludlum, so perhaps we can expect one more movie (two more if we count the Bourne novel written by Eric Van Lustbader). I can only hope, because the Bourne franchise has proven to be an intelligent, exciting action franchise. That's a good thing.<br /><br /> -Joe Sherryhen Bourne fights, I got a sense of the speed and intensity of the fight, but I also felt jerked around too much by the camera.

B00000255O|4.0|I definately recommend- Headhunters & Thrust before you buy this one, but once you have those, Man-Child is just as essential. This is a killer continuation of the funk H.H. & the Headhunters started with the album of the same name. It's like &quot;Headhunters&quot; opened the door- &quot;Thrust&quot; F*@#'d S*@# up and &quot;Man-Child&quot; was a sweet goodbye to some of the best funk music you will ever hear....... Ya dig?
B000002UUX|5.0|(I)t doesnt get much better than this! <br /> In 1988 Megadeth released a cd called So Far So Good... So What! It was a good cd but it didnt fit in with the thrash and music that was being thrown around at the time. Another thing to be taken into consideration was that the production was awful.The band's drug addictions sparked lousy playing (the album had to be recorded with tons of reverb).Still SFSGSW went platinum. After that the two other bandmembers other then Nick and Dave sold the bands equipment for drugs and were fired (this occured in 1988). Finally Dave sobered up.. He started creating the masterpeice known as &quot;rust in peace&quot;. With the amazing lineup of Dave Mustaine, Marty Friedman, David Elefson and Nick Menza they released the album in 1990.  <br />  <br /> The first two songs (Holy Wars and Hangar 18) are the highlights of the album and are probably the best songs of all time. The rest of the album is also amazing, although it does get a bit worse after five magics (another incredible song) The last song leaves you awestruck. <br />  <br /> Status: Sold 1.5 million copies will probably go multiplatinum in time.. <br />  <br /> Hits:Holy wars, Hangar 18. <br />  <br /> I highly recommend this album.
B00004Z459|4.0|I am very open minded to all kinds of music, when I first heard the single &quot;In The End&quot; I liked the emcee's flow and decided to check out the album. However, it wasn't what I expected, it is somewhat mixed between Metal and rap and electric, thats why it is called hybrid theory. Here are some of the pluses of the album: the emcee has a nice flow and some nice rhyme and delivery (despite some claim that he doesnt write his own rhymes), some melodies they sing are okay and the verses are alright. Despite all the pluses, here are the downfall of this album: some say they don't make their own music, they screaming of the lead singer is repetitive, the topic of their lyrics are mostly depressing. Some will like this album and the style this group brings, some will hate it with a passion. Some will like the verses that they deliver, some will choose pure metal or pure rap. I am one of those people that's in between. The depressing lyrics is definitely a minus and I don't really find them great but you got to admit that the verses are said nicely and the production sounds great. I liked this album pretty much because of the smooth delivery and some of the nice verses sang or spat by the singer or the emcee although some are not so great.  <br />  <br /> Lyrics: D+ <br /> Production: B+ <br /> Delivery: A+ <br /> Overall: B+
B0002EXH5O|5.0|I think the main reason that people are saying that the remaster is worse than the original is their used to listening to the original. Most of the album has a lot of good improvements even though the original cd's production was great. <br /> <br />Pros <br />Almost everything. The first two tracks really show the effort's of Dave remaking the cd. <br /> <br />Cons <br />Dave changed some of the lyrics from Five Magics may I ask WHY? <br />Take No Prisoner's voice (lead and backup) sounds pretty awful. <br /> <br />Another note I should add is Capitol lost the orignal recording for Take No Prisoners, Daves voice has changed from then and he cant sign the original version as well as he could 14 years ago. <br /> <br />The bonus track is mediocre, but atleast its a bonus.. All the extra's Dave added is well worth the flaws that the remaster has to offer, I highly recommend it.
6304025831|4.0|When I first got this video and started watching it, I really didn't like it because of the narrative storytelling technique it used. But later, I gave it a chance and I was sucked in the story. It had a nice plot, it somewhat like Scarface. How friends turned against each other, tough guys on yayo, wifes turning on their men. Robert De Niro played a part that is just trying to keep quiet not the violent type, Joe Pesci played his usual role of cussing in foul language and man-handling rivals or any one that is against him. Nas' video &quot;street dreams&quot; is a bop off of this movie, which showed it was pretty good. Sound is a little off on the VHS version, the picture is also a bit off. Overall, I enjoyed this film, and its definitely worth the money with the rewatch value. <br />  <br /> Plot: 8.5 <br /> Actors: 8.5 <br /> Rewatch Value: 9 <br /> Sound: 7.5 <br /> Picture:8 <br /> Overall: 8.3 <br />
B0001MDP3G|5.0|A truly great movie.  Stand-out performances from all character involved.  The only problem I really had with it was that I thought it was just a tad too long and it was almost irritating how many problems Inman happened upon on his long (way too long) walk home.  The thing was, as I was grumbling about how long and drawn out it had become, I was still rivited to the screen.  All was forgiven when the movie made me cry and then made me smile.  It was all truly worth the wait.
B00008H2LB|3.0|After listening to their first album, I liked their music but I really don't like the depressing topics of lyrics. I was hoping that they would change that as they did more albums. Nothing has changed, still the same ole I hate my life and my life sucks style. Although that I didn't like the topics of Hybrid Theory, I found every song listenable and there were no skippers. This album, I only found the singles &quot;faint&quot; &quot;numb&quot; and the song &quot;Nobody's listening&quot; catchy. &quot;Somewhere I belong&quot; and &quot;breaking the habit&quot; are commercial, they sound the same with everythingelse. Production is overall great, not much flaws here. &quot;Nobody's Listening&quot; has this nice bamboo flute beat, and Mike Shinoda spits decent verses. Chester's singing is beginning to sound the same, the screaming, maybe it's time for them to change a couple of things.

0783231032|4.0|The reverential tone Steven Spielberg has taken lately with World War II as evident in &quot;Schindler's List&quot; and &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; (in addition to the 1987 boys' adventure &quot;Empire Of The Sun&quot;) is nowhere to be found in this largely panned yet outrageously entertaining screwball comedy that would have done Blake Edwards proud.<br /><br /> Based loosely on events that actually occurred stateside during World War II (specifically the sighting of a Japanese submarine off the coast of California and the infamous &quot;zoot suit riots&quot; among day-glo dressed street hoods and servicemen), this movie pays tribute to the paranoia that gripped the West Coast in the days following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. Notoriously overbudget, this film was considered the &quot;Waterworld&quot; of its day, with the obvious difference being that it took itself not the least bit seriously. It was Spielberg's much-expected flop in the wake of &quot;Jaws&quot; and &quot;Close Encounters Of The Third Kind&quot;...but did it deserve to be?<br /><br /> An able cast of comedic talent headlined by the incomparable John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd with up-and-coming SCTV alumnus John Candy and recent &quot;Animal House&quot; veteran Tim Matheson supported ably by character actors Ned Beatty, Robert Stack, Treat Williams, and Lorraine Gary and all-time good ol' boy Slim Pickens on one side...and veteran Hammer Films horror star Christopher Lee slumming with Akira Kurosawa's number-one samurai Toshiro Mifune and the crew of a Japanese submarine with faulty navigational equipment on the other.<br /><br /> It is an all-star cast performing well up to its own high standard in what would be the most unusual twist on war since &quot;Hogan's Heroes&quot;...mainly the notion that this tragedy which brought so much pain and sorrow to the entire world could in fact be something that, in the right hands, could be uproariously funny. Spielberg's fingerprints are of course ubiquitous; the use of children, the collaboration with John Williams, breakaway stuntwork, special effects and well-designed set pieces...but it is the actors that make this movie work, particularly John Belushi who, like Brad Pitt in movies like &quot;Thelma & Louise&quot;, &quot;True Romance&quot;, and &quot;Snatch&quot; manages to steal completely a movie in which he actually has very little face time. All the actors are encouraged to play to their strengths, and the ability to &quot;pay no attention to that man behind the curtain&quot; (i.e., remember than none of this ever happened and that this is a comedy, not a documentary...Michael Moore, are you listening?) will enable the viewer some deep bellylaughs and some time well-spent viewing the bonus features which attempt to explain just WHY this is one of Spielberg's least understood or appreciated films.fingerprints are of course ubiquitous; the use of children, the collaboration with John Williams, breakaway stuntwork, special effects and well-designed set pieces...but it is the actors that make this movie work, particularly John Belushi who, like Brad Pitt in movies like &quot;Thelma & Louise&quot;, &quot;True Romance&quot;, and &quot;Snatch&quot; manages to steal completely a movie in which he actually has very little face time.

B000007WNN|4.0|I most definitely dig this album by The Cult. Been a fan of them for 15 years and loved them ever since I heard songs like &quot;Sweet Soul Sister&quot;, &quot;Fire Woman&quot;, &quot;She Sells Sanctuary&quot;, and &quot;Love&quot;. <br />  <br /> This album contains classics like &quot;Wild Flower&quot;, &quot;Peace Dog&quot;, &quot;'Lil Devil&quot;, &quot;Aphrodisiac Jacket&quot; and my personal favorite &quot;Love Removal Machine&quot;. The last song has a nice groove to it ala The Rolling Stones. Great stuff. <br />  <br /> This album was a departure to their earlier sound with albums such as &quot;Love, which evoked a more slower, darker, moodier feel and had some gothic overtones to it. I loved that sound, no doubt, but this sound is just as good. Fresh 80s heavy metal mixed with the awesome aura of 70s classic rock. Has a bit of a Zeppelin feel mixed with AC/DC and sounds similiar to Danzig I. It sounds similiar to AC/DC and Danzig's first solo album, but Rick Rubin was the driving force to this record, so go figure. That is why I like it. Very good stuff here. The only songs I don't particularly enjoy is &quot;Electric Ocean&quot; and the BTBW cover. But the rest of the album is very enjoyable and is definitely recommended. Four stars baby. Enjoy this 80s metal classic. Buy it.

B0000524CY|3.0|I really like this movie. It's still shocking even today. I have to say though that the directors commentary that Billy Friedkin made for the DVD is by far the absolute worst I have ever listened to. The whole point of the commentary is to tell the viewer what went on behind the scenes, what the actors thought. I want to know what Linda Blair thought about the climax of the film. Talk about all the people that walked out of the theaters. No. Billy Friedkin just narrates what is happening as it happens. It was like listening to a book on tape as I watched the movie. Example: The scene when Max Von Sydow is walking through the woods and gets the telegram that tells him he's needed in DC. Friedkin literally says &quot;We now see the old priest walking through the woods and then a younger priest run's up and hands him a letter. We don't see the letter but we know what it says. The old priest once again has to face his old nemesis in a battle of good versus evil.&quot; What kind of commentary is that? Lame! Boring! One reason why I buy DVD's is because of the extras and especially the commentary. If you want a good commentary check Milla Jovovich in Resident Evil and Polanski's Ninth Gate. Very insightful and entertaining.
B0002I831S|5.0|Twenty bucks seemed reasonable for a feature length disc.  Times have certainly changed since then.  Now let's talk shop.    These episodes are in air date order.  One may note that The Man Trap and Charlie X aired before Where No Man Has Gone Before.  Visible details, due to this, is the costume and set designs.  But chronological issues aside, this show doesn't require any order of viewing.    My favoite episodes this season were; Miri, The Menagerie, Arena, Space Seed and The City on the Edge of Forever.
1400032717|5.0|I highly recommend this novel; I bought it on a whim and am I glad I did!  I was sad when it was over, it was such a delight to read.  It is completely out of the ordinary; a sometimes sad, sometimes funny, and always moving story with simple, logical but beautiful language.
B00000DHRZ|5.0|It's a bit different than the previous Offspring and I can see why this would upset some fans. However don't you you think it's boring listening to the same music over and over again? The greatests songs here are The Kida Aren't Alright, Have you ever, Americana, No brakes. And unlike most of the other music out there the lyrics makes sense and makes you THINK! By the way to answer the guy above rock music is not supposed to be nice, it's supposed to be truthful and rebelious. No doubt, OPffspring are the best rock group in the past 10-15 years and this is one of the best albums in the rock/punk music ever!
B0001Z52RU|4.0|done if you don't count dating Demi Moore. He does an excellent job here. The title comes from the arcane chaos theory which is explained on the dvd. It is a horror/sci-fi movie that kept me engrosed & is the best of that genre this year. His childhood was miserable & disfunctional. As a college student he discovers a way to go back to his childhood to set things right. One little change however, alters the lives of his three friends & himself in horrifing, unimaginable ways. When you think things can't get worse, they do. The finale is brillant. I saw the directors cut which is a totally different though sadder ending that the theatrical version. But if you like horror or science fiction , you should enjoy this.

B00005Y7AW|4.0|I usually never review on Amazon, but I notice a lot of not so flattering reviews on this album so I thought I'd share my view. I (personally) love Rufus Wainwright's music. Everyone's tastes are different and it's all subjective, of course. His voice is beautiful though and very original. His songs are romantic, charming, beautiful, and quirky all at once. I can't say that everyone will love this CD, but I gave it a chance and I'm glad I did.
0446310786|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird is a very good book. The storyline is great, so is the book. You will be hooked on this book. The Autor Harper Lee did a great job. This book couldn't be better. Fantastic!!!! You must get a copy in hardback because it's worth every penny.
B000002WPI|5.0|This is for sure one of the most original, solid hip hop albums ever made.   That's all I got to say about that.   As to the dude who claims 50 cent is a gift from god to the rap game...are you serious?
B00000FC5H|5.0|Although there are several greatest hits packages available for Earth Wind & Fire, most notably the Best of EWF Volumes 1 & 2, their Greatest Hits compliation which was released by Columbia Records in 1998 is easily the best one available. Containing most of the band's hits as well as lesser known tracks that are just as strong, Greatest Hits is the perfect introduction to this talented band's music.<br /><br /> Simply put, every track here is top notch with most of them hitting the Top Ten on both the pop singles and black singles charts. The tracks &quot;Mighty Mighty&quot;, &quot;Saturday Nite&quot;, and their only #1 pop single &quot;Shining Star&quot; are excellent funk songs punctuated by their trademark snappy horn lines. The tracks &quot;September&quot;, &quot;Serpentine Fire&quot;, and &quot;Sing A Song&quot; are near perfect pop songs with soaring harmonies and melodies that stay in your head immediately upon first listen. Their late-70's hits &quot;Let's Groove&quot; and &quot;Boogie Wonderland&quot; are very strong disco tracks with the former track aging wonderfully compared to most of the music from that genre. While the harmonies are strong on all of their material, harmonizing doesn't get much better than on &quot;Getaway&quot;, arguably the finest song they've ever recorded. The ballads here are all fantastic with &quot;After The Love Has Gone&quot;, &quot;That's The Way Of The World&quot;, and &quot;Reasons&quot; being not only among the best recorded in the '70s, but of any era. Other great tracks here include their cover of the Beatles' &quot;Got To Get You Into My Life&quot;, &quot;Fantasy&quot;, and &quot;Kalimba's Story.&quot; This is a phenomenal greatest hits album that should be part of every music fan's collection. Highly recommended.
B000056VJ7|5.0|This is the pinnacle of rock. This is when your talent made you great. And there's plenty of that. Jim Steinman- the greatest composer of all time. MeatLoaf- One of the greatest vocalists <br />Roy Brittan-A great pianist from the E street band Tod Rundgren-great gitarist and vocalist Kasim Sultin- a great bassist and Max Weinburg- awsome drummer. This is a perfect cd,one you will listen to your whole life and then pass on to your children(I got mine from my dad)and if u realy want to depress someone make them listen to Bat outa Hell and then ask them to put on their favorite song.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|I don't really have a favorite VH album. I like most of the songs from all of their albums. But this one is great. 'Runnin' With The Devil' was the first song I learned to play. <br />To that n00b who just said that VH sucks because they aren't on MTV- MTV is a gay channel. It just plays rap and other gay stuff. Blink 182, Avril Lavigne and w/e else you suggest really, really suck. I mean, they are already forgotten and its only been less than a year since their last albums came out. This album came out in 1978 and people still talk about it- alot. It sold *10 MILLION* copies. Blink and Avril and all of them have a total of around 2 million copies sold- from all of their albums. VH has 13 albums counting their brand new one, each one is a massive hit. So go away and shutup. VH won't be played on a 'newest music' station since their newest music is '98 on VH 3. Actually, they have 3 new songs on BOBW so w/e.
B000002B2T|5.0|This CD is absolutely AMAZING. Layne Staley's vocals are so powerful and filled with emotion that you can actually feel the pain caused by his relentless struggles with the drug addiction, that ultimately, and very sadly, claimed his life in April of 2002 (R.I.P. Layne Staley--You are sorely missed and NEVER forgotten). The song &quot;Wake Up&quot; is my personal favorite...truly AMAZING and powerfully touching. Listening to this CD is like getting the chance to see inside the heart and soul of Layne Staley--to see his hopes, desires, and struggles all through the use of his powerful and emotional lyrics and vocals. [Just a little side note: This CD has a very &quot;jazzy&quot; sound to it that takes a little getting used to if you're a hard-core AiC fan....but it's definitely worth it.] Layne was a musical genius--both lyrically and vocally--a fact that is solidified by this album. His talents and strengths will never be matched...his memory will live on forever.
0780622553|4.0|As everyone knows, cinema is very much a visual medium, capable of conjuring up some of the greatest feats of the visual imagination. It's probably why we love the movies so much---some of the greatest ones have the ability to touch upon our imaginations and perceptions just as effectively as other artforms (like literature) can, but movies do it through visual means.          Alex Proyas' DARK CITY is a film that takes advantage of the visual possibilities of the medium and creates a world of dark-toned but spellbinding visual splendor. With the help of startling special effects, first-rate art design, and the widescreen cinematography of Darius Wolski, Proyas truly gives us a feast of awe-inspiring futuristic visuals that thrill you with its sheer imagination. There is a visual energy and grandeur here that is certainly not to be gainsaid.          Often with sci-fi films, it's a bonus if we get a good story to go along with the awesome visuals. DARK CITY stands above the pack because it has a compelling (or, at least, compelling enough) plot to support the epic-scaled visuals, in which John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) has to try to piece together who he truly is and what is going on in the world around him after he wakes up in a hotel tub and finds a dead prostitute in the room. As it turns out, the city is being secretly run by a large group of Strangers who have the ability to stop time and alter reality in order to suit their purpose. (I won't spoil what their purpose is, exactly, but when the explanation comes it may seem to some as brilliantly philosophical, to others simply flaccid.) It is a plot that plays with ideas of not only ever-changing realities, but with ideas about what truly makes up the human soul (is it the mind or the heart?).          Proyas and editor Dov Hoenig do a good job of driving the plot along and truly involving us in it nearly every step of the way. Unfortunately, for all its brilliant visuals and grand themes, there is one disappointing aspect to this film, and that involves the characters. I wish the script had made more of an attempt to develop some of its main characters, particularly its hero. (Rufus Sewell does a serviceable job of making him a sympathetic hero, but he doesn't really have much to work with in the first place.) Most of its characters are basically cliches---particularly the character of Inspector Bumstead, played (unimaginatively) by William Hurt as a typically hardboiled Raymond Chandler-type detective---and the script doesn't really make much of an attempt to develop them beyond their use as basically stock characters in the service of its grand vision.          I complain about the lack of dimensional characterization (a fault that has been in a lot of visionary sci-fi epics, even in Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY), but who knows? Maybe too much character development might have hindered the flow of this movie, which moves at a pace that mantains momentum and yet allows us to truly bask in the wondrous visuals. DARK CITY remains, above all, a triumph of awe-inspiring visual imagination and special effects that almost helps compensate for the thin characters. This is a movie that reminded me of why I love the movies so much. Maybe DARK CITY will remind you too. Recommended.
B00000IPAX|5.0|Well for this cd i think they should have a larger range to rate it, 5 stars just doesnt quite do it for Enema of the State. 100 stars sounds a little better. there is no way to describe it except to hear the brilliant music contained on this compact disc. Blink 182 is by far the greatest band to ever set foot on this planet we call earth and this is they best album. So i cant understand why anybody would be above paying the $12.00 for this cd. Please, if you have not bought this yet, do it. it will make your life so much better.
B0002EXH4K|5.0|This was one of the first metal albums I bought when I was a teen so when I saw the remastered version I thought i'd check it out. The sound quality is amazing, Dave really put some work into it. While not as progressive as Rust In Piece it has a beauty all it's own. The fast solo's and lead guitar harmony's are still there but it has a more straight ahead rock feel to it. If you like the solo's and harmony's check out Rust In Piece and if you like the straight ahead rock check out the two albums that came after this one. While Megadeth was always behind Metallica in the charts ( This one #2 and Metallica's Black album #1) Megadeth had the better music.

Genie's music reminds me of the better, purer, most natural tracks of Enya.
B00003CX8V|5.0|After enjoying the screwball hijinks of Billy Wilder's classic SOME LIKE IT HOT, I went into his Oscar-winning THE APARTMENT expecting something similar. I was delighted when I realized that this movie turned out to be perhaps an even better film than SOME LIKE IT HOT. If that 1959 film was a slice of comic heaven, THE APARTMENT aims for something a little deeper. At times, it feels less like a comedy, more like a poignant drama, and Wilder and co-screenwriter I.A.L. Diamond are able to shift moods with consummate ease. <br />  <br /> It helps that the performances are all highly effective, and sometimes, in the case of those of Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine, kinda touching. This was the first role for MacLaine that really showed off her range, since her character, elevator door-woman Fran Kubelik, runs the gamut of emotions from cheeriness to self-pity. MacLaine pulls them all off handsomely, and I liked watching her throughout. As for Lemmon---well, I must say that some of his physical and speech mannerisms distracted me on occasion (esp. during one scene in which he tries to deal with his bosses by phone over scheduling conflicts regarding his apartment---his physical gestures seeming a little too overdone for my taste), but at least he gets the gist of C.C. Baxter spot-on, and we truly feel for this lonely man whose eagerness to please (and move up in the business ladder) gets him into emotional (and some physical) trouble. I don't think I've ever seen him carry a movie all by himself the way he does here, and this must surely rank as one of his best performances. (I would also be remiss if I didn't mention the performance of Jack Kruschen as Baxter's next-door neighbor Dr. Dreyfuss, who is an uncanny delight whenever he appears onscreen.) <br />  <br /> I found the premise itself delightfully imaginative. A man who rents his apartment to bosses so they can cheat on their wives with secretaries: I'd have to rack my brain to think of another movie that used such an original idea for a movie. Of course, a good premise doesn't necessarily add up to anything if the execution isn't there, and in the case of THE APARTMENT, the execution is near-flawless. Wilder and Diamond uses the premise to slyly and savagely satirize corrupt office politics---because of his willingness to give up his apartment for his bosses, Baxter shoots right up the corporate ladder in a matter of days (instead of months or years), and it is only towards the end that he realizes how sour his rise really is. As for the central relationship between Baxter and Kubelik, Wilder manages to mine more touching drama than laugh-out-loud comedy out of it---and the drama always manages to be involving and wonderfully perceptive about human nature. And the dialogue is, of course, wonderfully witty and revealing---though once again the film's final line of dialogue is the script's highpoint.  <br />  <br /> All of these elements make THE APARTMENT a truly great film. Its Academy Award for Best Picture was richly deserved in 1960, and its status as one of the great American films (No. 93 on the AFI's &quot;100 Years...100 Movies&quot; list) is a testament to its lasting power as both funny, satirical comedy and touching, uncompromising human drama.
B000055Y0X|5.0|Stanley Kubrick's classic 1964 satire on militarism and the Cold War specifically. So close to the reality of the time that the humor of the movie lies more in how closely it reflects the political and military thinking of the Cold War: hence the satire. <br /> <br />Sterling Hayden delivers an impeccable performance as General Jack D. Ripper, the psychotically paranoid Air Force general who orders a preemptive nuclear strike by a B-52 squadron on the U.S.S.R. Peter Sellers is brilliant in his triple role as the U.S. President, Dr. Strangelove, and Mandrake. George C. Scott also tops the cake in his over-the-top caricature of the Pattonesque General Buck Turgidson. It's hard to describe all of the nuances of this film on such a short review: you have to see it for yourself. Although the film will certainly have more of an impact on those who are old enough to remember the Cold War and all its tensions: there's a universal message in this satire that isn't bound to just that period of time. <br /> <br />As a side note, this film isn't far from the truth as the Soviets had, by 1964, indeed developed a doomsday device. Under Stalin's rule, the USSR was planning to dock several grounded tanker ships filled to the decks with nuclear material. The ships would automatically detonate and consume the earth in radiation once they detected a level of radiation that could only be present as a result of nuclear war. Horrified by the possibility of accidents and human error, Nikita Kruskev ordered the project scrapped and it was never implemented.  <br /> <br />
B00005JN2F|4.0|THE BOURNE SUPREMACY is a summer action flick that is meant to hold you in suspense for the duration of the movie so that the viewer can forget the hot weather outside.  And it works!  Director Paul Greengrass has dialed all of the cameras' and actors' meters to breakneck speed, and while the big screen does at times seem overwhelmed by all the blitzkrieg action, the characters appear so involved that the film is all of a piece.  Reprising their roles are Matt Damon (who handles this genre very well), Julia Stiles, a glimpse at Franka Potente, and very fine acting by Joan Allen and Brian Cox.  This is a high suspense frolic and well worth jumping on for the escapist ride.  The locales are beautiful - Goa,India, Berlin, Moscow, a New York City.  And if you can take time to notice, the musical score by John Powell has some truly beautifully written moments.  A terrific escape from the summer doldrums!
B000000WJZ|5.0|...I just sit and think, 'Man oh man, where did it all go?'<br /><br />As 'Cherub Rock' opens up this sweet roar of thunder, distortion waves against the room like a film of goo. It's all too great, it's all too beautiful. The echoing lyrics that mirror everything all around the teenage angst, these are themes, meanings, and all that apply. Tears can almost form when hearing what I consider the best 'Smashing Pumpkins' song ever. Suddenly the solo rips apart what anyone would consider standard, and the rest ends in a full on attack, bringing everyone with them.<br /><br />'Quiet'...but not for long. Not even close, the edge continues and sanity breaks, a set back to the one before, but gasoline is thrown in the fire and we're on a road of yearning ambition, all the way until...<br /><br />Silence for a minute, just a second really, and we're back on the trail. Something can be heard, I can hear it, something! The lick begins and I am happy. Who cannot be? It's, 'Today.' The warmest, sunnier side of the Pumpkins that we never ever really see again! It's everything we achieve in life and in the end, we try to keep going higher, but what is our utmost concern, or rather, how can we be happier having been the happiest ever?<br /><br />I'm almost asleep, but I can hear the music continuing. From the dismal and compelling 'Disarm' to the funky 'Geek USA' and 'Mayonaise', I'm finally rewarded with the full life painting of that which is, The Smashing Pumpkins. A band that would continue on to something big by never looking back.<br /><br />I'm awake and I realize the album is over. Bummer. It's hard to realize such a decent sound is so dated and buried, especially when the band who made it, is destroyed and gone. But then again, unlike the band, we look back and we see where they took us, and we can always go on and on that way. 'Siamese Dream' is an experience, it's one of those rare albums, much like Floyd's 'Animals', where you can't listen to one track, but listen to all. It's one of those albums that's just...good.t listen to all. It's one of those albums that's just...good. <br /> <br />
B000148KK2|3.0|This is OK music but personally I prefer this unknown Amish artist named GENIE that I found here. Genie has a 4 CD set that you can pick up for about what a CD or 2 of Diana's goes for.  Diana's first CD was good but Genie's is even better.
0792833236|3.0|I recently saw Martin Scorsese's much-acclaimed 1980 film RAGING BULL, and while I recognize what is good about it---the performances, the sharply realistic style, and some of the hard-hitting scenes of marital and familial violence (both emotional and physical) involving Jake La Motta---I must honestly say that I was disappointed by this film. Scorsese's equally acclaimed TAXI DRIVER was a much more compelling film dealing with perhaps even more sordid subject matter.           My main problem with RAGING BULL is this: why make a movie about this loser boxer if we never really get into the head of this character at all? The script (credited to Paul Schrader and Mardik Martin, but supposedly re-written by Scorsese and De Niro) makes no attempt to truly understand this repugnant man and why he does what he does. Now, I don't require that every protagonist, in film or in literature, be sympathetic or even likable---Travis Bickle was an equally disturbed individual, but at least we got truly got to know him throughout the course of TAXI DRIVER. RAGING BULL's La Motta always remains remote from us from start to finish, and that is what really disappointed me about the film. La Motta, in the film, is basically just an unpleasant person to be around, who gets violently jealous very easily, and who apparently finds relief from his troubles in the ring. He never truly develops, never becomes a three-dimensional human being to us---he is simply a puppet for Scorsese to once again explore his themes of sin and guilt. If his intention was to make a more universal movie about those themes, I think he did it much better in his breakthrough 1973 film MEAN STREETS.          That, of course, is not to deny RAGING BULL's strengths. Once again, I am struck by Scorsese's realistic style: some of its scenes---some of the early scenes between La Motta and Vickie (Cathy Moriarty) truly have a quality that transcends cinema and simply becomes real life. (I found the style a revelation thefirst time I saw MEAN STREETS.) The boxing scenes (which are actually few for a boxing movie) were justly acclaimed for Scorsese's stylish direction and Thelma Schoonmaker's innovative editing (she won an Oscar for her editing of the film), and they still pack a punch today, so to speak. And Scorsese gets good performances from his cast, particularly with Joe Pesci as La Motta's brother and Moriarty as the abused Vickie. As for Robert De Niro...well, yeah, he won an Oscar for his performance here, and he is never unconvincing in his role (esp. during his character's later years, because De Niro himself really did gain all that weight for the part)---but I think his emptily-conceived character lets him down, and De Niro does not quite manage to bring La Motta to life the way he did with Travis Bickle in TAXI DRIVER.          Maybe my generally unfavorable reaction to RAGING BULL simply stems from my expectations for the movie. I expected to understand what drives Jake La Motta to do what he does, but the movie never really makes much of an attempt to understand its own main character---which, for me, kinda defeated the purpose of the film. Perhaps Scorsese was less interested in La Motta, more interested in what the character represented to him: an embodiment of the themes of sin and guilt that figure prominently in his work. Perhaps in that respect he was aiming to transform La Motta into something universal. Whatever his real aims, I still would not consider this movie one of Scorsese's great films, and it is hardly the best film of the 1980s, as has so often been said about the movie. It is certainly not an awful film, since it has its isolated compelling scenes and good performances; nevertheless, RAGING BULL comes as something of a disappointment.
0800141601|1.0|Typical big-budget Hollywood cookie-cutter production that appeals to the masses with big names and catchy scenes in the previews before word gets out on how appalling the film really is.      Here the Arthurian genre has been reduced to an expensive but unconvincing stage backdrop for modern characters with modern values wearing tights and shiny armor. Given the disposition of the characters, one wonders why the writers even bothered to set this story in a medieval setting: it could have been 20th century New York City and it wouldn't have made any difference. Connery, Gere, and Ormond all deliver boring \\"stick to the script\\" performances with no emotion.      This movie isn't even worth renting or having as a gift. Don't waste your time on this Hollywood fodder: it's not even worth one star.
B0001Z53AQ|1.0|this is a prime canidate for the worst album of the year. and 'my band' has already won worst song of the year. and some horrible production. what were these band of idiots thinking
B0000028MA|5.0|There have been plenty of soundtracks that have just totally owned. From 'Dazed and Confused', both CD's, to 'Grosse Pointe Blank', also both, and even 'American Graffiti', but when I think of the best soundtrack, it's gotta go to 'Singles.'<br /><br />Cameron Crowe hit the nail straight on the head when he made the romantic-comedy-drama which conveniently happened to spur around the greatest music scene ever. With bands like Pearl Jam and Alice in Chains, the vivid Paul Westerberg, intricate Chris Cornell, legendary Mudhoney, or the ultimate shredder rock, Soundgarden, what else can you really put on there?<br /><br />The answer is all there. Every song on this album is easily and equally just as great as the other. Hell, my girlfriend and I's song is even on here! With original songs just for the film, Pearl Jam takes the cake with 'State of Love and Trust', a powerful number, that should have made it to Ten, but instead we find it here. Along with 'Breath', the two, in my opinion are some of the band's finest pieces ever.<br /><br />Chris Cornell contributes a major part to this record as well, with his band Soundgarden and even his solo stuff. The song 'Seasons' is so beautiful and soothing, I could play it during a mid life crisis and hopefully sanction some sort of sanity. That being said, it's a terrific song.<br /><br />Andy Wood's moving song, 'Chloe' is also on here, and easily worth the price of the album. Considering the rarity of the Mother Love Bone disc itself, this song shines on here, and readily available. This and Paul Westerberg's songs fill the movie, so anyone who has watched the film and listens to the soundtrack, these stand out, a lot.<br /><br />I almost forgot, 90's most eccentric, powerful band, The Smashing Pumpkins also contribute. 'Drown' is probably one of my favorite songs in their catalog now, not just because it's in such a great film, but because overall, the song is just enthralling. Listen for the guitar and Corgan's pitch, this song screams 'Siamese Dream', but it's not...it's on the soundtrack.<br /><br />See that's where soundtracks are memorable. When bands go exclusively into making their own song be on that album, and just that album. Although Alice in Chains 'Would?' is on their record, it fits in fine here, especially how it's used in the film, as well. Nevertheless, the bands that actually just went out to make the songs for the film, is the primary reason why this album stands out so much.<br /><br />I say this with all honesty, buy this album. It's easily thee best soundtrack I have ever listened to. Even before seeing the film, anyone could enjoy this. Buy this and buy the movie. It's an honest picture with a real effort into both film production and soundtrack department. Reading Crowe's journals on the set of the film, it's apparent the bands took such a fledging effort to make this film what it is.<br /><br />Well, see the result.'s pitch, this song screams 'Siamese Dream', but it's not...it's on the soundtrack. <br /> <br />See that's where soundtracks are memorable.

B00018D44U|5.0|Great CD, a little more country than the other one. <br /> <br />I would also get the 4 CD set by this unknown Amish artist GENIE, it's fabulous piano vocal music.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|I've been contemplating this for a while: is this better than &quot;Is This It&quot;? Well, after hours of hard thinking (not really), I came to a conclusion. To me, this album is just a little better, but I really think it depends on what you like. On &quot;Is This It&quot;, with nick valensi on rhythm and hammond jr. on lead, the rhythm was pretty straight forward, it sounds basically like power chord progressions to me, with a couple other, different ones thrown in. But the leads on that album were awesome, with albert hammond jr. taking o few chances to throw in some nice solos. This time around, they switched it, and I really love what albert hammond jr. can do on rhythm guitar. For an example of this, check out Reptilia, the part where everything else stops except for him. I love that part. As far as the leads on this album, Nick may not do all the old rock n roll solos, but he can get some damn good tones out of his Epiphone Rivierra. Ive always loved the Strokes' guitar tones, but Nick apparently played around with his amp and some pedals since &quot;Is This It?&quot;, cause now theres some more original sounds. For an example of this, check out the single &quot;12:51&quot;. With Fab's steady, simple drum beats keeping the songs going and Nikolai adding his cool bass lines, this is a great, original album. Anyone who says that this band is uninspired and untalented doesnt know anything about playing or writing music. My favorite song is &quot;You Talk Way Too Much&quot;, and another good one is Reptilia, in which Nick does show hes got the ability to do a solo. This is great, and i loved it. Maybe you will too.
0792839730|5.0|Richard Attenborough's 1977 adaptation of Cornelius Ryan's novel covering Operation Market-Garden in WWII: General Montgomery's audacious plan to capture key bridges in Holland with a major airborne offensive while armored divisions drive through towards Arnheim, the last bridge between Holland and Germany.           The film has been criticized unfairly because of its overwhelming cast of superstars and lack of character development. Certainly, the complexity of the story and the quantity of important characters doesn't allow for a deep character study such as what you would find in 'Apocalypse Now.' The movie however gives a complete picture of Montgomery's boggled operation from beginning to end. The characters are fleshed out enough to make them believable and to give the story substance. The movie isn't so much about the characters but about the poor planning and foiled execution of the campaign as a whole: the characters serve to represent the command and tactical units involved in the operation. The inclusion of brilliant stars for these roles was exactly what was needed to give their brief parts a lot of punch. The batlle scenes are good for their time, the Germans actually speak German, and the all-star cast sweeps the audience away into all the triumphs and failures of Operation Market Garden.          Again, with an all-star cast starring Michael Caine, James Caan, Robert Redford, Gene Hackman, Anthony Hopkins, Laurence Olivier, Dirk Bogarde, Sean Connery, Liv Ullmann, Ryan O'Neil, Maximillian Schell, and others, how can you go wrong?
B000003TAR|5.0|The first nivana album I listened to was nevermind as most peoples were. It didn't seem like the normal grunge album of the early nineties. It was much cleaner, catchier, and poppier. It was one of the best albums of all time. <br /> When in utero came out many people were expecting to hear the same, and were dissapointed, as was I the first time I listened to this. My first time listening to In Utero I thought &quot;umm..this is ok i guess&quot;. It doesn't have the same first time greatness feel to it.  <br /> After the first couple times listening to it, I realized how cool the beat of Scentless Aprentice was, and how sad the lyrics were to All Apologies, and how great there other songs were. I think this album is just as good as nevermind...there's no way of saying that either one is better because they are very different sounding. Just give In Utero a chance, maybe listen to it about 3 or 4 times, and you'll see how great these songs are. <br />  <br /> As for my song by song review- <br /> Serve the servants-6/10 A kinda catchy song, not one of my favorites though <br /> Scentless aprentace- 9/10 It's not that good the first time U listen to it, but after that, it never gets old. <br /> Heart-shaped box-11/10 My favorite of the album. One of the most creative songs ever. <br /> Rape me- 10/10 my second favorite. I think this is the most catchy and memorible songs on the album. Even though its pretty simple, it doesn't get old like most radio hits. <br /> Frances Farmer Will have her revenge on seatle-8/10 Its got a really complicated intro that I don't even get now, but its got a really cool chorus and one of the most cool lyricle lines ever: She'll come back as fire and burn all the liars leave a blanket of ash on the ground. Genius. Don't stop the song until you hear the chorus. <br /> Dumb-5/10 It's too simple for me and it really gets old after a while. This is my least favorite. <br /> Very ape- 9/10 One of the most original and cool of kurt's songs. Itsgot a really cool rhythem and its hard to understand at first, but you'll see the second time around. I love the chorus and how it's so easy to remember. <br /> Milk it- 8/10 one of kurt's best scream-alongs. Its a little hard to get the rhythem at first, and he whispers pretty quiet at the begining, but after that you won't have any more trouble hearing anything else out of the song.... <br /> Pennyroyal tea-9/10 a cool slow song. It might seem really simple when you're listening to it the first time, but you'll be surprised that it's stuck in your head when you finish listening. <br /> Radio friendly unit shifter-9/10 Just get passed the beginning and you got a really cool song! I like the guitar riff. <br /> Tourettes- 7/10 Its only like 1:30 but it makes the use of the time it's given. I like the guitar part. there's not too much to say. <br /> All apologies- 10/10 Kurts best slow song. I like the main riff to the song. The song gets stuck in your head easily. Its a little repetitive, but it doesn't get old.
B000089RVX|1.0|This music is just aweful. If you want to listen to good music listen to the Frames or Vic Trill, or maybe even Celtic Frost.
B00028HBKM|3.0|I must admit that seeing Passion of the Christ at the movies was a very unique experience. In many ways, this movie was very masterfully made. It must have taken enormous efforts to create the setting and make it all run smoothly together in Aramaic.       Aside this, I was somewhat disappointed that the movie focused on Jesus' suffering and the last moments through extended and very violent scenes. It was too sadistic for my taste and I found myself feeling uneasy about it. Why the director didn't give more attention to Jesus' true message? I feel that he could have reached even wider audience and level of appreciation if the movie would have embraced further different aspects of Jesus' life.        Naturally, as a mystic, I view the message of the Bible in a different light than mainstream Christians. So I am always looking for some symbolical and spiritual message within the pages of the Bible -- so I tried to found it in this movie, but it proved to be very difficult.        The director also took the liberty of changing the message of Bible by adding things that do not exist in our version of the Bible. I also feel there to exist some Catholic tone to this movie which is the reason why I decreased my evaluation with one star. Another star is taken away for excessive focus on torturing Jesus rather than portraying more of his work. Few occasional flashbacks are not sufficient to please a viewer who is looking for something deeper in the movie. Otherwise this movie is quite an experience to see.        However, in spite of my personal opinions, I am sure that the movie will provide a wonderful experience to anyone who sees it.         We may end up interpretting its message in different lights, according to our beliefs...but one thing that we all can agree with is that it is a masterfully produced and took enormous efforts from the production team. It is like part of common knowledge to see this.
038551123X|1.0|I found this to be a very disappointing novel.  It sounded interesting, but about 1/2 way through, I was forcing myself to continue.  I didn't feel the writing or characters had any depth.  There normally is at least one character that you like and are pulling for in a book.  I found none of these characters even likeable. The basic idea of the book is an interesting premise, but I do not feel the author was able to carry it off very well.
B000003337|5.0|this album, is perfect it has all of Randy Rhoads old stuff, if your a Rhoads fan, such as my self you'll really like this one. you might want to get some more albums that feature RR's stuff such as &quot;Blizard Of Ozz&quot; and &quot;Diary Of A Madman&quot;
B0001LJC2K|4.0|After listening to &quot;time is Running out&quot; on the radio (of course their hit here in America) i decided to check out the band's music. I Instantly fell in love! I love how they mix nice classical piano with rock! this Cd is very nice. A lot of Slow emotional songs and wonderful lyrics. yet still outstanding. If you want more of the rock and mixture i reccomend what is probably their best Cd yet. &quot;Origin of Symmetry&quot; New Born and PLug In Baby are the singles from it---awesome songs! horray for Muse!
B00003CX9E|5.0|I highly recommend this dvd version of, &quot;Citizen Kane,&quot; it's well worth seeing and watching many times. Orson Wells along with the rest of the cst is aboce average and really really good. It truly is one of the greatest films of al time and also th emost excellent. Orson Well's does a great job directiong it and staring in it as William Randolf Hurst. the documentary footage and trailer and other excellent footage is well worth getting it for. It deserves all the stars is can get.
B00005NWM3|1.0|Chad Kroger sucks my more than any other 'successful' artist in the history of the music industry.  He has no talent and needs to learn what real music is and stop feeding such horrible atrosities to our youth to drone over and accept just because some dumbass DJ plays it on a rock station. Just because its on the radion doesn't mean it doesn't suck my ass completely. Please never compliment this no talent hack, because he doesn't know sharps and flats from the smell of is own ass. Anybody giving him more than one star should be shunned forever from making any commentary on music ever again. Thank you for your time and i hope I have enlightened you to how much Nickelback sucks.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|this album is amazing!!!! <br /> <br />The britney's music are growm up... <br /> <br />touch of my hand is the best song ever.... so great and very deep
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Basicly, this film talks about the several consecuences of addiction. I would never have seen it if i would have known the main topic before, because personaly these are not the kind of movies that you take the lead to see. But the most beautiful characteristic of the film is simply how the director displays the emotions of each one of the characters and prints them into your brain until you get as much anxiety as the character itself. Yes, it IS graphic, but don't confuse violence snd cheap pornography with the art of handleing the camera. The first half of the movie may seem a bit tedious and repetitive; in the second third, you'll start to get interested, but on the last part you'll be sweatting (maybe crying) on your couch. The end of the movie is something you really shouldn't miss. As a recomendation, don't get interrupted along the film, or you'll get lost in the story.
B00006JDS4|5.0|I remember first seeing &quot; I Spit on Your Grave&quot; twenty plus years ago when I was fifteen or sixteen years old. The video store should have never allowed me to rent it; this film deserves a stronger rating than R.<br /><br /> Certainly, over the years my memory had embellished the film; nonetheless, it still shocked me, today.<br /><br /> It is easy to forget that there are actors following a script. The film is evenly paced and unrelenting. Unlike &quot; The Last House on the Left,&quot; there is no comic relief to remind the viewer that there is a director. One is forced to confront the brutality of rape and violence.<br /><br /> The actress is quite convincing and deserves recognition. The rape scenes are borderline snuff quality except for the fact the editing and directing have moments of brilliance. The men are sickening and easily hated; they are just vicious animals without any redeeming qualities, yet they are believable. Let us not forget, there are men who commit these attrocities. One can appreciate why she seeks revenge.<br /><br /> Without question, the rape scenes are some of the most disturbing moments in cinematic history. The castration scene is unparalleled. The special effects are just that, effective.<br /><br /> The DVD is an excellent package. &quot; I Spit on Your Grave&quot; isn't presented as a low budget film. It is art; it's not a slasher flick; it's not meant for entertainment.<br /><br /> Buyer beware...
B00005JN2F|3.0|THIS REVIEW CONTAINS NO SPOILERS. <br /> <br />IN SUMMARY:  <br />First, this is a four or five star-action adventure movie but I have reduced the rating for the reasons discussed below; <br />Second, view THE BOURNE IDENTITY first to put this story in context; and <br />Third, the plot of this movie bears no relationship to Robert Ludlum's book with the same title and is very inferior to that book. <br /> <br />If you simply want to have fun watching an action-adventure spy thriller with lots of over-the top chase scenes and even a few brief interjections of humor, then THE BOURNE SUPREMACY starring Matt Damon is definitely five star entertainment. But if you like a modicum of believabilty and a first rate plot, this movie falls a bit short. Most disappointingly for this reviewer, the only similarities to the book by Robert Ludlum bearing the same title were the fact that Jason Bourne is an agent still suffering from the amnesia which resulted from his assignment portrayed in THE BOURNE IDENTITY and that he is being framed for murders commited by others to further their own agendas.  <br /> <br />The movie opens dramatically with a CIA sting which goes terribly wrong, resulting in the death of an undercover operative and the loss both of his bankroll and the information which it was meant to purchase. It then immediately transitions to India, where Jason Bourne and Marie are still on the run and have lost themselves in a remote town as he attempts to gradually piece together the various fragmentary flashbacks of his past life. (In contrast, the book opens with Bourne having resumed his true identity and being provided therapy and protective custody by his former CIA handlers as he attempts to construct a normal life with Marie.) Further violence ensues and the two story threads come together in a way almost totally antithetical to Ludlum's tale. Agent Lundy (played by Joan Allen) is the the leader of the CIA team whose failed op leads to reopening the black op Project Tredstone file and reassembling much of the team from the previous film. (The continuity of the cast is a nice touch.) Although no film allows the level of complexity and nuanced detail of a nearly six hundred page Ludlum book, the story has enough plot twists to keep it interesting. and the final car chase scene is incredibly long and action filled. (The only problem is that in real life nothing short of a tank would be likely to survive the damage inflicted on Bourne's stolen taxicab.) Of course, in the end Jason will survive, various clues will have allowed more of his memory to be restored, many of the bad guys will be vanquished, and Matt Damon will have established the character Jason Bourne as the next prototypical hero who triumphs against overwhelming odds (including a faulty memory) in what will perhaps become a long running series of action-adventure thrillers. <br /> <br />The major shortcoming of the film is that the deaths of the some of the characters central to the plots in the two subsequent novels, THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM and the just published THE BOURNE LEGACY (review 7/8/2004), mean that by the conclusion of this film it has become impossible to pursue those intriguing storylines. Thus, the positive impact that those wonderful stories could have had in transferring the BOURNE brand to the movies is irrevocably dissipated. Undoubtedly, many readers of the books will share my disappointment in this divergence between Ludlum's development of Bourne's life and that depicted in this film. (Particularly since a series with several subsequent sequels is apparently planned.) This decision by the scriptwriters and producers is especially unfortunate in light of the fact that a major element which helped make the movie THE BOURNE IDENTITY so enjoyable was its fealty to both the powerful opening moment and dramatic conclusion of that book.  <br /> <br />I had several other minor dissatifactions not worth detailing. However, in contrast to the complaintsof many other reviewers regarding the cinematic style that involved the extensive use of hand held cameras, frequent close-in shots and rapid scene changes, I actually felt that the direction was very effective and my complaints were with the script. Also on the positive side, as in the best films of this genre the actual violence is usually brief (and often stylistic and suggestive rather than graphically detailed and gruesome). Furthermore, there is no use of the frequent profanity found in many movies as a substitute for any meaningful dialogue. If this movie had simply been titled THE BOURNE ADVENTURE, my overall rating would have been four-plus stars. But the false expectations created for Ludlum readers by the title deserve only a single star; this disappointment is compounded by the injustice done by the plot to Ludlum's conception of the essence of Bourne's character. In summary, my disappointment is sufficient that a rating of three-plus stars seems a fair compromise. <br /> <br />Tucker Andersen
078681859X|4.0|Of course my favorite parts in the book were Bartimaeus's parts,I love the footnotes also the little snipets about Bartimaeus's past, i hope they play a part in the other books (like who is the boy Bartimaeus liked to turn into?) The Magic is different than in Harry Potter. But this is still a really good book. I am kinda wondering if the next book is going to stay with Nathaniel or if somebody else is going to call Bartimaeus.
B0002EXH5O|4.0|Okay, so I just went out and bought all of the remastered Megadeth releases and thought I'd write a review on RIP. First off, RIP is one of Megadeth's best albums and I was quite excited to hear the songs all nice and remastered after hearing the great job that was done on Killing Is My Business. The first two tracks (Holy Wars..., and Hangar 18) sound great as I was expecting. Everything crystal clear and hard as ever... then I get to &quot;Take No Prisoners&quot; (which is one of my favorite tracks). I guess Dave Mustaine decided to re-do the vocals on some of these songs (even though there's no mention of it in the insert) and to make a long story short, he basically butchered TNP, 5 Magics, and Lucretia!! Maybe it's just because I'm used to the original versions so the differences are more noticeable, but to me they sounded like crap! I gave the release 4 stars because it's an awesome cd. It would have gotten 5 stars if Dave wouldn't have screwed with his winning formula to the extent that he did.
B000002549|5.0|With her god-given voice, it is such a joy to hear it used for purer sounds! It is often wasted on mundane material, but here the beauty of her voice meets its match: in haunting classical songs sung in Italian, French, German, etc. Anybody who finds her raspy and diva-esque will be surprised by her restrained, sensitive  delivery here. Barbra at her best...The Voice Of The Twentiest Century indeed!
B000286S8S|4.0|Well, this is a much better, but still imperfect compilation. Having said that, someone that I chat with that visits the official Van Halen message said that Alex came on to clear up the &quot;Finish What Ya Started&quot; mess. Apparently, Eddie himself was responsible for this screw-up. He oversaw the remastering, but given his worrying too much about the summer tour, this little mistake slipped past him. Apparently, Alex said that this problem would be fixed for the 2nd pressing. Hopefully we can just send our defective discs to WB in exchange for a new one.
B000000W5L|5.0|This is it.  There is no discussion.  This is the greatest rock 'n' roll album ever recorded.  Seething, dark, enraged, dirty, and ultimately redemptive--Exile on Main Street is an album that grows better each and every time you listen to it.  From the wild, raucous, unholy barnburner that is Rip this Joint to the heartfelt sorrow and hope of Shine a Light, from the mournful Torn and Frayed to the explosively driving All Down the Line, this is an album that has everything and does not waste a single track. <br /> <br />The songwriting and the performances are both pulled from the depths of the Stones' souls on this one--they quite simply never sounded better, not even on their legendary '60s records.  The rockers rock harder and the blues...that sweet, sweet gospel-and-country-infused blues that no one else ever did quite the same...it's at its absolute peak here. <br /> <br />But it's more than just a compilation of great tracks.  The songs of Exile are definitely OF Exile--both sonically and thematically they hang together and stand apart from the Stones' other work. <br /> <br />But it's more than just a compilation of great tracks that sound similar.  While this is no concept album, it still tells a story on a hidden, basic level--a story of alienation amid a world of self-destructive carousing, of raggedness and exhaustion and depression and pain and love leading to a hope of redemption.  It will hit you as you listen to the world-weary Shine a Light--you will realize you have just taken a journey which is coming to an end, and then you will celebrate with Soul Survivor. <br /> <br />Apologies and respects and all that, but I can't believe that the Beatles could ever have come up with an album like this if you gave them a million years.
076790592X|5.0|Heartwarming and moving. I loved this book.
0380002930|5.0|We first read Watership Down the week it came out in the 1970's, thanks to some advance buzz from people who had picked up copies in England or Canada. We were hooked from the first page by this allegorical novel that uses rabbits to explore the concepts of leadership, courage and survival. In particular, it was enjoyable to read the mythological tales that the rabbits told at the end of the day. Adams wrote so beautifully of the Hampshire countryside that we were compelled to visit Watership Down when we went to England in 1975. The pictures we took there can be seen at [...] .  <br />This is a special book for anyone who wants a good adventure combined with a serious message.
B000002GYW|5.0|Hardcore fans will undoubtedly disagree, but for my money, The Eagles absolutely nailed it with &quot;Desperado,&quot; which ranks with The Byrds &quot;Sweethard of the Rodeo&quot; and Gram Parsons' &quot;Return of the Grevious Angel&quot; as a high-water mark for '70's country rock.<br /><br /> Containing songs rich with Western/outlaw imagery, singers Glen Frey and Don Henley's trademark vocals were never better in delivering classics like &quot;Tequila Sunrise,&quot; &quot;Saturday Night,&quot; and the title track - and with Bernie Leadon still in the band, the authenticity of the group's country underpinnings were never stronger.<br /><br /> Once Leadon left, The Eagles became more of an arena band that tried to capture more of the mainstream rock audience (while still delivering the occasional country-tinged classic like &quot;Lyin' Eyes&quot; and &quot;Best of My Love&quot;). Obviously, they were wildly successful, but with the possible exception of &quot;Hotel California,&quot; the band never again approached the creative genius that produced &quot;Desperado.&quot;
B0001MDP3G|5.0|Only if you've loved someone so intensely can you understand the relationship between Inman and Ada. Those who doubt how a few moments can become the basis for them to endure their lives for the sole purpose of meeting again have missed out on something beautiful in their own lives. Is &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; the best movie I've ever seen? Only time will tell for sure, but I've rarely been so caught up in a story.  <br />  <br /> An interview with the author of the novel reveals that the story of Inman is based on a family member of his, whose story has been handed down. As in &quot;The Notebook,&quot; a love story based on a real couple enduring real-life situations, and coming through it all for the better, to me is much better than a convoluted tale of how people might have been.  <br />  <br /> See this movie - you will be changed - it will make you go hug your sweetheart and kids a little tighter and remember how blessed you are.
0380778556|5.0|It's funny how much of an impact someone can make on everyone around them. When Rebecca de Winter died, people were in shock. She was the perfect woman to run Manderley, the estate of Maxim de Winter. She was beautiful, clever, charming, and a great friend to everyone... except for those her knew her all too well. Although she was such a bold woman, no one expected Rebecca to hold such a lasting impression at Manderley. When Mr. de Winter brought home a new wife, people weren't quit sure what to say. Why, this young bride was nothing like the previous Mrs. de Winter! But, for those who adored Rebecca, they needn't worry. Rebecca would live on. In the halls and rooms of Manderley and in the minds of all her acquaintances. Manderley was Rebecca's, and nothing could take that away from her. Not even her own death. One woman. One house. One widowed husband. One blushing bride. Many memories that won't die. It all adds up to an extraordinary novel that will have you on the edge of your comfy reading chair until the very last word...

B0000CABBW|4.0|When I first heard about this movie, my immediate thought was: Oh no. Another Free Willy. God save me. <br />But I was in shock when I actually saw it. A masterpiece. Keisha Castle-Hughes is such a fennominal actress. Her performance in this film is so wonderful. She pulls off a wonderful performance in the assembly scene, crying and singing/talking of her ancestors at the same time. This movie will truely capture your heart and make you laugh, make you cry, make you shout, and make you smile all at the same time.
0618526412|3.0|This book was overall, &quot;Ok&quot;. For most of the beginning, I kept waiting and reading, thinking that it was building up to something. Welllll...it didn't. After about 150 pages, I realized that the point of the novel was just observation, and thinking. McCullers had a few good points, some interesting ideas, but they never went anywhere. It was well written, but I had to force myself to finish it, just so it would not have been a waste of money. Not a bad read if you are just looking for something, but it you want an absorbing page-turner, this is not the book for you.
B000002P2W|5.0|Peter's poor midlife crisis set to music.  If only we all had his problems back in '75, right?  This Who album, although easily not my favorite, has a strange pull to it so as it keeps ending up in my cd player.  It's very easy to see just how this album seperates itself from the rock opreas Tommy and Quadrophenia, but I see this album as a second cousin to Who's Next, albeit, a toned down, somber second cousin.  Ok, fine, the surley, obnoxious, drunkard of a second cousin.   <br />  The Who here have returned to their bare-bones, stripped down version of rock that was temporarily abandoned for Quadrophenia, their previous release.  The sound is fresh and pleasing as they may have been sensing the age of synthetic overproduction that was soon to come later in the decade.  This album is filled with songs of hopeless despair, although the tone suggests an -oh f**k it- attitude rather than a bland -so what- outlook.  It is easily the Who's most underated, or overlooked material outside of the popular offering Squeeze Box, which doesn't seem to fit in with the rest of the numbers here.  Standouts include the rocker Slip Kid, the memorable Blue, Red, and Grey, and the albums capper How Many Friends. <br />  When I critically think about this work, I keep thinking of the amazing range displayed here.  Not only to write these disjointed songs about the depths of sleaze that wealth, fortune, and stardom bring, but for these guys to realize this while they were still very young and in the midst of a fantastic career (they are all 2 decades away from any venerable mid-life crisis).  Its as if, Peter and Roger took a step back while taking a step foward.  They must have known this work would not be a large commercial hit, so why not ride this theme out and be satisfied at having expressed the pain and angst at being adored by so many, not because of who you are, but who you represent being.  It's bittersweet, but I love it, love its bad attitude, and recommend it to all, except those of you on prozac, paxil, xanax, or any other anti-depressant as it may be too much for you right now. <br />  -Goodbye all you Punks, stay young and stay high-
0316776963|4.0|This isn't a book about a murdered museum curator-- but then again it never claims to be.  I borrowed this book from a friend before he had a chance to read it, and he asked me to let him know how it was.  I told him the book got a B+, because while it virtually has no plot, Sedaris is witty enough just recalling details of his life to make me laugh out loud. <br />I read this not knowing anything about the author or the book, and only realized it was auto-biographical after I started reading it. He has basically constructed a novel out of different themed chapters, all focusing on some odd perspective about a different time in his life.  My favorite was when he talked about his sister Amy, that chapter made me giggle to myself for the rest of the day. <br />I found that this book was the *perfect* book to take to the gym and read during my cardio workout.  1) It has no complex, deeply woven plot that you have to concentrate intently on, so you can cruise along reading while running in place 2) It is written well enough to hold your attention and 3) It is funny enough to make you concentrate on that instead of running in place.  <br />If that is a good analogy for how you like your books, then here ya go.
B00005QBER|5.0|This album really began the trend the Scorps would take for the 80s--polished melodic songs with strong guitar riffs and harmony up front. Arguably this was done just for MTV, but the Scorps made their best music during this period, anyway. Many people get hung up on Uli or Schenker, but the rotating guitarists they've had just aren't as important as their songwriting ability. Here is where the songs start to really shine. If you are really into metal history, then their old CDs are worth hunting for, I guess.<br /><br /> Lovedrive, though, really should be lumped in with Blackout, Love at First Sting, et al. That's a compliment. Every song on this disc could've been a hit off either of those albums. &quot;Lovedrive&quot; is probably the highlight here. Buy this one & ignore the other brainless cover.<br /><br /> BTW, this album can commonly be found at Best Buy & other stores, so shop around before you spend more than $12 for it.
B00028HBKC|5.0|Not Just because it was one of the first movies out in 2004, but also because it is really good.  Jim Caviezal gives a great performance and should definetly be nominated.  The story here is not a bible fairy tale, its a story about jesus's personal suffering, its definetly not antisemtised, its not about that, and who really cares, its about what jesus did for everyone.  Its violent but when you hit someone with broken glass and nail him to a cross what do you think is gonna happen.  Its intense and dramtic, everyone in the theater cried.  See this movie it will make you think.
B000096I9G|5.0|I had an opportunity to see The Cure live during the second date of their Curiosa Festival in Tampa, along with some of the bands they've influenced in the course of the past decade or so. This DVD, recorded in Berlin in November 2002 reflects the current musical state of the band, except that it misses on their latest self-titled album. But for some it may better that way. &quot;Trilogy&quot; presents live versions of three of the band's (arguably) best albums: 'Pornography', 'Disintegration' and 'Bloodflowers', along with an encore set made up of &quot;If Only Tonight We Could Sleep&quot; and &quot;The Kiss&quot; (from their 'Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me' album).<br /><br /> This is an essential buy for serious The Cure fans and a highly recommendable live DVD set for the newcomer into the band's music, since it provides the viewer with a complete experience: a very well produced musical recording, along with the visuals of a great show (much like the one you could catch, if you saw them live these days) and a video with excellent direction.
B00008EY65|4.0|Except for spiderman 2 this is the best super hero movie ever, but it still could use a little work and thats why i'm waiting for the extended 3 disc DVD.  I rented the movie today, and its definetly worth buying, but the movie could be a little longer, and use some more action and more info on the story and characters.  The action is is good but of course it doesnt compare to the matrix, the fights are slow at times but still well done, but there is more then action to keep you interested.  Ron Perlman is very funny and as a kind of little kid sense to him, but he also is believable when he is serious too, which isnt that much.  The movie is funny, intelligent and complicated, suspensful, and action packed.  As far as the DVD goes is the pictures good the sounds blah blah blah, the extras are very good, but i would wait for the extended DVD in October and i am.  8 out of a 10, buy Van Helsing when your at it its better, comes out on the same day, has lots more action, and Kate Beckinsale.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|Gavin Degraw debut release ~Chariot~, released earlier this year, was not only a refreshing welcome to the pop/rock world, but it was a remarkably mature and soulful album with lyrics that, at times, seemed classic.  <br /> Now Degraw, a beloved live performer, has taken his debut album and stripped down the music to its bare roots. Gone are the bombastic drums and guitars riff and added are soulful arrangements that not only showcases Degraw unique voice, but his passionate lyrics as well. <br /> On songs such as ~Nice To Meet You Anyway~ and ~Belief~ Degraw takes what was once beautiful rock tracks to endearing acoustic standouts. His voice weaves hauntingly between the lyrics, allowing the lyrics to take the front seat and shine. <br /> Other notables are his new versions of ~More Than Anyone~ and his recent single ~I Don't Want To Be Anyone~; in these tracks Gavin vocals are lamented over each melody in an effortless way.  <br /> But the standout track has to be the newly recorded version of Sam Cooke's swan song, ~Change Is Gonna Come~. The album, in a way, arcs itself to this song that should easily set Degraw apart from his Jason Mraz and John Mayer counterparts. Degraw's voice is the star in this song that captures the yearning and heartache Cooke originally conveyed in his version. It is truly a respectful cover.  <br /> Degraw may not be a mainstream artist as of yet, but hopefully with this newly released version of his already classic debut he will be more than just another voice on the radio, but a staple in the music world. <br />
B00006CXXU|5.0|&quot;I'm OK&quot; is definitly the best song on this album. Second best is &quot;Cruz.&quot; The other songs I didn't find to be attention-grabbing.
B000002NIW|5.0|I remember the first time I heard be quiet and drive, I was blown away by how heavy,emotional and catchy it was all at the same time. THese guys are great in concert.
B00008EY9G|5.0|I wouldn't suggest seeing this movie more than once...unless you're looking for clues that give away the ending.  However, I found that although this movie might've started out as a typical horror film, ...it dosn't end that way.
B000068VHP|5.0|Her voice is so soothing, sweet and real. <br /> I love this album.

B0000UJL96|5.0|First of all, Star Trek 5 was really bad,(sorry, william shatner)and they did the right thing bringing Nicholas Meyer in to help. <br />ST reedeemed itself with this one(i think they needed to make up for the crappy star trek 5). It was good,  <br />but not as good as Star Trek 2.  <br /> <br />Highlights: <br />watching praxis explode(you know, explosions are always fun) <br />dinner w/the klingons <br />kirk's trial  <br />escape <br />surgery on a torpedo
B000286S8S|3.0|ok Ok I bought this album because I am a huge fan of the early Van Halen Stuff. I loved Sammy as a solo act but just don't buy him as a part of &quot;Van Halen&quot;. The Song selection overall is pretty good. I didn't care for any of the new songs. It just amazes me that David Lee Roth gets so little credit on the album. You would have thought since it represents both era's that a picture of Dave with the band would appear somewhere??? Also my problem with the live tracks are that sammy is singing them. Couldn't they at least put dave on one of them since all three songs are from his part of his reign as frontman supreme! well I have said my piece.
B00007LTIG|5.0|I love the sound of Garcia on his pre-humbucking '56-'57  Les Paul Custom. all of his specially made axes did not compare. This cd is worth it for that alone.
B0001Z52RU|4.0|I'm a fan of Ashton Kutcher, I've seen most of his work, that's why I was hesitant to see this film. Kutcher in a serious role? Give me a break right? But in actuality, I thought he had a solid performance throughout the movie. I was able to take him completely serious. I hope to see him in more roles like this <br /> <br />The makeup was great. They modified the cast to fit certain roles in all the different alternate lives and they made changes for every life. It really helped to separate each life from the next, and added to the believability of the whole story. Special Effects were terrific, they didn't use as many as most those big blockbuster movies, but it's a case of quality over quantity. <br /> <br />The story was well thought out and tied together real nicely. There were a few mistakes if you want to nit pick such as the theater scene when they are kids. The theater was playing Se7en and Dumb & Dumber, while in real life they were a year apart. So unless you demand that every small detail be correct in a film, I think you might enjoy it.  <br /> <br />The ending... You either love it or you hate it. Everyone that saw it with me hated the ending and said it was too depressing. But me? I loved it. Depending on how you look at it, it may appear to be a sad ending, but everyone else lived happily ever after so it's all on how you personally see things. I always enjoy the \\"ultimate self-sacrifice\\" endings.  <br /> <br />I would recommend this film to people that enjoy strange stories, and unique endings. Perhaps fans of Dean Koontz or Stephen King.  I don't recommend this movie to the squeamish (cause there's a few scenes that you will hate). I also do not recommend this to people that just want action and don't really care about the story, and people that want to see a good love story. <br />
B00005JN2F|3.0|There were many times where the film was a bit disorienting and I wasn't able to really tell what I was seeing. Also, it cut out a lot of shots that could have been cooler. Additionally, the camera never stopped moving as if the cameraman had taken a couple NoDoz and washed them down with a Red Bull. Also, the plot of the movie was highly unnecessary. I feel like there was a lot that could have been left out, and whereas the first film had an overarching story, the story in this film was secondary to watching Matt Damon run/drive around and then just walk off in the end. A lot of the suspense of the first film really wasn't there. <br /> <br />My friend leaned over to me during the film and said that he thinks the movie should be a TV series where Bourne discovers more about his identity as the series goes on. And I feel that this film would have made a good one hour episode of a TV show, or even a two part episode, or it could have been stretched over a series of episodes as a type of subplot (like Mulder's sister in X-Files). But the movie was clearly setting up for a third film, I only hope that if they do make a film they get a steady camera and actually spend more time on single shots rather than cutting back and forth. And to any TV producers out there, maybe you should convert this to a television program rather than keep making movies. You might have to replace Matt Damon, but hey, Keifer Southerland did 24, maybe you can get Damon to do this. <br />
B0000WN0ZK|3.0|You'll hate it if you like Hollywood movies. You'll love it if you recognize it as the human condition expressed using visuals only--a revolutionary idea when Antonioni first tried it. He selected every object in every scene for its symbolic meaning, even though the movie's theme is that meaning is impossible to know. But his hero tries to create meaning anyway, since he lives in an age where Existentialism, Marshall McCluhan, and the beginning of mass electronic media are eroding meaning. It's \\"art for the artist's sake\\"--fascinating if you're on the artist's wavelength, boring if you're not; but important for its historic significance to film-making.
B0000251W7|3.0|The last album featuring Bruce Dickinson on vocals (before his return in 1999), this album markes the end of an era of greatness that was fading away with the album before (No prayer for the dying). With his singer aiming a solo career and the birth of the grunge movement, Iron Maiden was at a crossroad in his history.<br />1-Be quick or be dead : A good opener but not as good as what was done in the 80's. Bruce's voice is not as powerful. 8,5/10<BR>2-From here to eternity : A bluesy kinda song that features again the voice of Bruce trying to imitate AC/DC's style. OK song but not memorable. 8/10<BR>3-Afraid to shoot strangers : Another song about war written by Steve Harris. And a damn good one. 9,5/10<BR>4-Fear is the key : This song reminds me a bit of the song Powerslave (but not as good !). There is a chaotic part in the middle of the song that is not Maiden's style but still good. 8/10<BR>5-Childhood's end : A more traditionnal Maiden style song. Bruce's voice is back on top. 9/10<br />6-Wasting love : Iron Maiden first real attemp to do a ballad. The result is not  cheesy but that's not with that kind of song that they made new fans. And maybe it was the reason why they released it as a single. 8/10<BR>7-The fugitive : Same as Childhood's end. 9/10<BR>8-Chains of misery : Good song with an OK chorus but not more. 8/10<BR>9-The apparition : This song never picks up despite a good instrumental part. Very boring. 6/10<BR>10-Judas be my guide : A catchy song with a good chorus. With the years it gets better and better. 8,5/10<BR>11-Weekend warrior : This song should have been on Tattooed Millionaire (Bruce Dickinson first solo album) or on a B-side. It's not serious and it sounds like AC/DC. 4/10<BR>12-Fear of the dark : Despite all the tension between between Dickinson and other members and the mental and physical fatigue accumulated over the years, this song proves that Maiden still had some gas in the tank. A super rocker kind of an epic. 9,5/10<br />Overall,in the Maiden standards, a big disappointment for me. Fortunately Bruce Dickinson left the band after this album, even though, in my opinion, he's the greatest singer of all time. The years that he spent out of Maiden gave him the opportunity to experiment all kinds of things and mature (as well as other members of Maiden). This is an album with a singer that doesn't want to be there and a band that doesn't want him there. The tour that supports the album and the 2 awfuls live albums that were released were a testimony of that era of turmoil. You should own this album only if you're an Iron Maiden fan.
0679861750|1.0|Why give your child an adaptation of a classic?<br /><br />The original book IS a classic because it's that good, but it's not intended to be an easy reader. There are lots of references to Dickens, 19th century schools of thought and people and places of the times.<br /><br />You can read the real book young-- I read it in 6th grade, and it's still one of my faves.But your child will not get it until they are much older, not matter how gifted they are!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />An adaptation is not the answer. It's like feeding your child a pint of spaghetti sauce that has been drowned in a quart of water--the original is there, but the flavor is gone. And so it the nutrition!!!<br /><br />There are plenty of books your child will enjoy and RELATE to. Wait to read the real thing. Or if you really insist on exposing them to the story before they can read it, let them see one of the film versions first--they were all pretty good.
B0000251VX|5.0|Following an icon album like The number of the beast is not easy but, with Piece of mind, Iron Maiden succeed and produced an album, even though that doesn't have classics like Number of the beast, Run to the hills or Hallowed be thy name, proved to be more complete and, as the years go by, simply better than TNOTB. This album also features the arrival of drummer Nicko McBrain who completes marvelously the rhythm sections with his mate the God Steve Harris.<br />1-Where eagles dare : Greatest drum intro ever. Welcome Mr. McBrain. Bruce Dickinson voice is over the edge and there's a great instrumental part. Awesome overture. 9,5/10<BR>2-Revelations : A very progressive song in the style of Iron Maiden. The more you listen to it the more you like it. The live version on Live After Death is something else. 9,5/10<BR>3-Flight of Icarus : Introduced as the 1st single of the album. This very good and catchy song was meant to be one of the top songs on the album...and she's not. That shows how much Piece of mind is a strong album. 9/10<BR>4-Die with your boots on : Killer rock song. Great chorus and solo. When you listen to this song you understand why Iron Maiden is so good. 9,5/10<BR>5-The Trooper : Even though I heard this song way too many times in my life, it's still a classic of metal. Everything in this song is perfect. 10/10<BR>6-Still life : One of Iron Maiden's hidden treasures. A smoother song with a killer chorus. Every Maiden song is different but you can always recognise the style underneath it. With Still life, it's different, there is a new structure and a new feel. 9,5/10<BR>7-Quest for fire : This song was probably destined to be a filler (remember the B-sides on the vinyl records ?). Well, if it is, they missed the target. This is a very good song that deserves to be on the album. 8,5/10<BR>8-Sun and steel : Same as above. A very catchy chorus. 8,5/10<BR>9-To tame a land : The Steve Harris epic that you can find on almost every Maiden album. With the years we can say that Harris wrote this song in preparation for his best effort ever, Rime of the ancient mariner. Just perfect ! 10/10<br />Not as known as TNOTB, Piece of mind is proving, with the years, to be a better album than his predecessor. A definite must have for every metal fan.
B0000DCGT5|2.0|They almost destroyed the movie by giving Sean William Scott so much room and transforming Stifler character in a machine gun spitting foul language along two hours of movie time. Amazing!
B00004SVID|5.0|My opinion is that you'll maybe better of with this live recording than the original. Why? Great guitar solo's, additional tracks and a great sound quality. Try it, you'll be surprised!
B00008EY65|3.0|If you just have to have it now, go ahead. But a better version is coming for Halloween. It's a three-disc director's cut with 15 minutes of extra footage sliced from the theatrical release, as well as improved bonus materials. Studios continue to milk consumers out of their money by releasing and re-releasing the SAME MOVIES. Don't fall for it.
B0000256RB|5.0|Ayreon is the ultimate 'one man' project. Arjen is man behind Ayreon, coming up with the concepts and doing most of the writing. The fact that he uses different musicians and singers on every album means he can really explore a lot of different styles and sounds. Every Ayreon album is unique and packed with creativity. <br />  <br /> Into the Electric Castle is my favorite Ayreon so far. It's pretty much uncategorizable, there's so much variety from one song to the next. From haunting acoustic guitar bits to driving hard rock (sometimes within the same song!), it sucks you in like nothing you've ever heard before. There are 9 or 10 different singers on this cd (including Arjen himself), and they all add their own elements without overpowering it. The songs have a lot of variety to them, but fit together so perfectly, even when you're going from a screaming guitar solo (the end of Amazing Flight in Space) to an acoustic number (Time Beyond Time). The storyline is kind of cheesy, reminiscent of the old pulp sci-fi novels, but is very interesting, and ties everything together.  <br />  <br /> One of the coolest cd's I've ever heard, but definitely made for people who like different styles and types of music. If you're into the whole zero-creativity-and-originality mainstream music scene, don't bother, you'll just find it strange and confusing. But if you're looking for something different, pick this up and you will not be disapointed! <br />  <br />Favorite song: ALL OF THEM!  I had some favorites when I first started listening to this, but the more I listened, the more I got into the whole album. So I can't really pick a particular song, they're all so good!
B00020X88O|4.0|SHOWGIRLS is what it is, and you may already have an opinion whether or not you like it or love to hate it! This is obviously a set made for the fans of the movie - it includes shot glasses, playing cards, a pin the pasties on the stripper game, and a host of supplementary features not on the original barebones release. It's the SHOWGIRLS party pack!<br /><br /> You get a commentary from a very funny guy who was not affiliated with the making of the movie at all. A neat idea, but it does not answer the burning question that could only come from the filmmakers themselves -- WHAT WERE THEY THINKING? More than anything I would like to hear the cast and Paul Verhoven discuss what it was like on the set, and why they chose to make it the way they did. There is also a video commentary feature where some girls of NYC's famous strip club SCORES discuss how real the stripping scenes are. Funny! But still not anybody who made the film.<br /><br /> I like the idea of taking the &quot;worst movie ever made&quot;, and having people talk about why they like it. I found it the most fun I had at the theatre that year. It's a mess, but you can't stop watching it! So if you like the movie this is the best package for your money. You get tons of SHOWGIRLS souveneirs along with one of the greatest exploitation films ever made. SO order it an do a PIQUE turn!
B0002IQJUK|5.0|Every so often an artist comes out with an album that can literally change your life, your entire prospective on music and fully captivate you from the start until the finish. Last year an artist released an album that did just that, and that album was Chariot by Gavin DeGraw. To this day it is still my most cherished album and hands down my all time favorite in my entire collection. Each song was breath-taking, and now with the release of STRIPPED, Gavin's second album, I am even more pleased, in fact words may not have been created to describe my reactions.<br /><br /> Not only do you get the original album, Chariot, but you get STRIPPED, an acoustic, live recording of all 11 tracks from his impecable debut album, as well as a brand new song &quot;Change will Come&quot;. Using the ever popular 'passion over pitch' method of raw, emotional recordings, Gavin re-recorded all the songs 100% live in a studio with an acoustic band all in one take, completely stripped of all the engineering & over producing that record lables use to get more radio friendly sounding songs.<br /><br /> Not since Lauryn Hill's Unplugged have I heard an album so real, so focused & so incredibly inspiring. While his debut was an astonishing release, STRIPPED easily surpasses it because this is the way I believe Gavin initially intended the listener to hear his work. Who could have imagined tracks such as &quot;Follow Through&quot;, &quot;Belief&quot;, &quot;Just Friends&quot;, &quot;Over-rated&quot; & &quot;I Don't Want to Be&quot; could sound any better than their original recordings. Even &quot;Chemical Party&quot; which I wasn't a fan of the first time around, sounds incredible to say the least.<br /><br /> Gavin is a truly remarkable talent, and the best kept secret in all of the industry. Now its time to let that secret out. This music is purely timeless, an influential masterpiece that only comes along every so often. For one to pass on this release could even be a sin. He had the best album of 2003, and now he unquestionably has accomplished the same award this year.the best album of 2003, and now he unquestionably has accomplished the same award this year.
0375703764|4.0|I sometimes feel that people get a little too vexed about certain terms like &quot;post-modern&quot; or &quot;experimental&quot;. This book was an interesting double narrative that weaves a book and the transcription of that book together, and to my mind brought about interesting things to think about. But I wouldn't call it mind blowing. It was not impossible to comprehend. In fact all it required was patience and some flipping of pages to read strings of foot notes that you were forced to miss. (or at least that's the order I chose to read them)  <br />  <br /> While yes, it's more than a little self absorbed, and I never got the chills (and I frighten pretty easily), this book was lots of fun and that's why I must generally recommend it. If you enjoy an enigmatic bent to your fiction, pick it up.
B00000K31V|2.0|As we are all aware, video games have progressed so far to the point that it doesn't take much imagination to conjure a world where the distinction between reality and game playing could occur.  David Cronenberg, whose best film I think, is DEAD ZONE, reverts to his graphic sense of sensationalism to bring us this story about a video game unlike others before.  His imagination is to be heralded, what with live pods and stranger things going on with guns that shoot teeth, etc., etc.  The problem is the whole thing is so chaotic, tedious and self-serving that EXISTENZ becomes little more than a muddled bore.  I wasn't impressed with Jennifer Jason Leigh or Jude Law; they appeared to be acting and not inhabiting their roles at all.  Ian Holm and Willem Dafoe are wasted in their roles and what little special effects there are have been done before and better.<br /><br />I appreciate innovation and creative differences in movies, but they should be a little more cohesive and entertaining than this mess.
B0000DJZ7W|4.0|This is one of Celine's best albums. I was somewhat disappointed in her One Heart album, but she made amends with this one. I love Celine's voice and own almost all of her English albums and now 5 of her French albums. I only gave it 4 out of 5, because 2 of the songs lose me in the style of presentation. But other than that - grade A.
B00005AQE8|5.0|I had always been a 'Pac fan, but I liked Biggie better. That is, until on a vacation I had the time to listen to all the songs on both CD's. After that, I got hooked on Tupac. This CD, although as others have metioned departs from his roots of rapping about social issues, is still a great.
B0002GTWYW|2.0|Everything that has been written so far is true... this was indeed Biggie's finest hour. What you should know is that aside from the bonus DVD and the inclusion of &quot;Who Shot Ya&quot; and &quot;Just Playin' (Dreams)&quot;, there is no additional material compared to the original. The sticker on the front says &quot;Remixed and Remastered&quot;, and the description on Amazon.com says &quot;(Rmx)&quot;, but none of the key remixes that originated from &quot;Ready to Die&quot; are included. What a shame! Over the years, we have come to know and love the smooth remix of &quot;One More Chance&quot; featuring Faith on vocals, as well as the bangin' club remix, aka &quot;One More Chance (Hip Hop Mix)&quot;. &quot;Big Poppa&quot; also received an excellent remix treatment when it was released as a single. These are the versions that we remember as classics - not the original versions. How hard would it have been to include these remixes as part of this package??!?! There's PLENTY of space left on the bonus disc! <br />  <br /> For the reason listed above, the album retains it's 5 star rating in my books, but this particular 'remastered' release gets a 2 star rating from me.

You know, you people crack me up; I don't see how anybody could ever become an artist without listening to influential music. So what if Muse lapses in and out of sounding like other bands? Sounding like crap isn't (quote)bold and new(endquote), so why should a band want to blat out horrible tracks just to make (quote)underground(endquote) listeners think they have some better understanding of harmony and dissonance?

B00002E224|5.0|The recent theatrical release of Before Sunset, which I loved, made me look back on Before Sunrise, which I had mixed feelings about at the time.  It was a very pleasant surprise to discover that it was an even richer, sweeter film than I remembered, made all the more bitter sweet with the knowledge of its sequel.  The chemistry of the stars was there from the start.  I think I was initially turned off by the magic of Vienna with all of its beggars having a special gift to impart to our romantic wanderers.  Perhaps my eyes even rolled a little, who can say?  Grown a little older, a little wiser and their banter (read foreplay) makes more sense.  It can be touching and funny but also a little cynical, which I had forgotten about.  Few films grow better with repeated viewings.  I am glad this one does.
0201633612|5.0|There is not a day does by that some pattern in this book is used in the daily work at my software firm. These idioms have come to dominate software development: they are both useful in themselves, and they increasingly form a common language for software designers that is abstracted from details such as implementation language or problem domain. <br /> <br />In order to truly use this book, the developer really needs to incorporate an intuitive knowledge of these patterns, how to implement them, and their relative costs and benefits, into his set of skills. <br /> <br />Some of the simpler patterns are those that occurred to me only after doing things badly in OO designs for years (My first OO experience was in C++ over 10 years ago). Others would not have occurred to me and have saved me heartache in the problems I currently face. <br /> <br />One thing that would be nice would be an update that included Java examples and new patterns. Still, this book is indispensable. If you're a software developer and you don't have it, buy it and read it.
B00028FDRA|5.0|First of all Lacuna Coil is one of the best bands ever.  Cristina has an awesome voice, and she's hot!.  I would HIGHLY recommend this and all their CDs. <br />Evanescence is nothing compared to Lacuna Coil. Lacuna rules!.
B00005JLD4|5.0|I will forever be grateful to Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper for having reviewed their film on their TV show.  Indeed, that's how I heard of it and immediately placed it on my list of must-see films. <br /> <br />It's a heart rending film, at least to human beings with compassion.  I had heard from Australian friends that, historically, Australia had treated Aborigines as badly as the United States had treated American Indians, but I knew none of the specifics. <br /> <br />Rabbit-Proof Fence, based on the book Follow the Rabbit-Proof Fence by Doris Pilkington Garimara, gives its audience an insight into a blatantly racist policy in place in Australia from the early 1930's through the beginning of the 1970's.  Here, we learn of three \\"half-caste\\" Aboriginal girls, sisters Molly and Daisy and their first cousin Grace, whose biological fathers are white and whose mothers are Aborigines.  Empowered by the Aborigines Regulation of 1931, the government systematically arrested children of mixed race and removed them from their parents, transporting them huge distances to boarding schools that differed little from concentration camps.  There, the children were forced to speak English only and educated to become domestic servants to be placed with white people.  The program's purpose was to prevent them from having children with aboriginal spouses.  Children who ran away from the camps were hunted down, brought back, put in solitary confinement and beaten severely. <br /> <br />In the instant story, the three children, miserable in their new surroundings at 14, 12 and 8 years old, escape despite the possible consequences and walk home, a distance of 1,500 miles.  Australia had constructed a system of rabbit-proof fences, designed to keep the burgeoning rabbit population (a species introduced from Europe with no natural enemies in Australia) from further invading farmlands.  The girls know that the rabbit-proof fence goes through their home settlement and stretches for thousands of miles, so they follow it. <br /> <br />The film gives us a look at their journey and as they progress over nine weeks. <br /> <br />Australian filmmaker Philip Noyce has done an outstanding job.  This story requires no complicated treatment and none is given.  It all looks very real and Noyce did an outstanding job locating the three Aborigine girls who play Molly, Grace and Daisy.  By the way, it's Molly's daughter who wrote the book Follow the Rabbit Proof Fence based on her mother's own story. <br /> <br />We Americans should be able to appreciate this film given our own history with regard to our aboriginal people, the American Indians.  We need to know this story because we need to take a stand that such things should never again be allowed to happen. <br /> <br />
B00006RINF|5.0|This is the greatest CD that I have ever bought. Lacuna Coil is an awesome band, the vocals are fantastic. Christina and Andi are the best.  I think that Lacuna is way better than evanescence. <br />This band needs 10 stars.
B00005JMXX|5.0|this movie is awesome!!!!!!!!! i went and saw this the opening day, it i must say, it is one of the best movies ive ever seen. <br />it might still be in some theaters, and you should go see it. it comes out on DVD and VHS on october 5th i think. it might be later though, but the friggin point is, is that it comes out on video in october and I CANT WAIT!   ..... umm..... ok bye.
B00000G3Q4|5.0|This is a landmark in the horror movie genre. It is also well known for it's low budget and gore effects. I think the last ten minutes of this movie is much gorier than Dead Alive's last twenty minutes. And what is that pouring from that things sleeve? Grits? <br /> <br />The plot has been explained over a hundred times : Five people spend the night in a cabin in the middle of the woods, and one by one they are possessed by the dead. It's really simple. Everything is so great looking, especially for the so-low budget. <br />For the weak stomached people out there, do not watch after Ash throws the book in the fire. The play-do looking effects at the end are not only sick, but they are the way gore should be done. How many movies have you seen that did gore this way? Totally gross, wicked, and awesome. The greatest zombie/demon film of the eighties. And by the way, don't bother with the Book of the Dead edition, it's not worth the money. Just get the Special edition, or the UK 4 disk set, they're worth it.
1573225517|5.0|I've heard so many good things about this book that I couldn't believe it was as good as the all said. Well, it wasn't as good as they said, it was better. <br /> <br />I loved reading about this loser character because I've read too many novels with perfect people. This guy is a down to earth honest record store owner. With such beaming characters as Barry, you'll be thinking about them long after you set down this novel. <br /> <br />Barry outshines everyone else, in my opinion. I'm looking forward to reading more Nick Hornby! From the art of the mix tape to top 5 lists, it's all here. <br /> <br />5 vinyls.
0060920084|1.0|After reading A Walk In the Woods (during which I laughed so hard I cried more than once), I was expecting a similar journey around Small Town America. What I got instead, was a mean-spirited, spiteful, disappointing ride around 14,000 miles of America. Bill, can you honestly expect me to believe that in 14,000 miles you didn't find one town, that could make you happy? I often hoped the tone of the book would change, but it never really did. I did enjoy your re-telling of your travels with your father. He sounds like a much more interesting traveller than you have become.<br /><br />I'm glad I read Walk in the Woods first...no one would have been able to convince me to pick it up had I read this book first.<br /><br /> If you are looking for a true book about Small Town America I would suggest Travels with Charley by John Steinbeck or my perennial favorite, Blue Highways by William Least Heat Moon.
0786867973|5.0|Indeed, this recipe book gives great recipes.  They are only bad if you don't know how to cook (whoever said these recipes were tasteless).  This is my favorite book by Nigella Lawson because the ingredients needed are much easier to come by than some of the ingredients in her other books.  The snickerdoodles in this book are absolutely delicious and vanish long before any other recipe I make.  If you loved baked foods like cakes, cookies, scones, etc.  this is the book for you.  I would not advise it for the Atkins diet.  If you are looking for something low-carb Nigella Lawson is not for you.  her recipes are old, authentic, and taste wonderful.  She makes things the old-fashioned way (and that way it tastes a lot better than modern TV dinners).  her other books have recipes for everything but this book is strictly baked goods. :) delicious :)
B00005YUFK|5.0|This album of well known South African songs was recorded live at the Blues Alley in Washington with an array of great South African jazz musicians like Themba Mkize, Lawrence Matshiza and Bakithi Khumalo. Masekela is a master of the horn, his virtuosity brilliantly demonstrated on the brilliant tracks Stimela (Train), Grazin' In The Grass and Ntyilo Ntyilo. Other standout track tracks include Nomali, Marketplace, Fela Kuti's Lady and the Miriam Makeba composition Abangoma. The atmosphere is wonderful and the rhythms are superb. This warm, heartfelt music should appeal to all lovers of jazz and African crossover music. I wish I were there.
B000148KK2|2.0|I should preface my review by saying that I'm a huge fan of Diana Krall. I appreciate her musicanship and the brilliance of her previous albums. <br />  <br /> That being said, *The Girl in the Other Room* just doesn't stack up to her other work. The musicans on the album are still great (as before), but so much is missing from this album. Diana Krall is just confusing her *brand* with this one. It sounds more like Costello, and less like Krall. Not to say that Costello is bad, but I purposely bought a Diana Krall CD, and I don't feel that I got what I paid for. Besides a couple nice tracks (like *Temptation* & *Love Me Like A Man*), it's really not jazz at all, and the lyrics are abstract not thought-provoking. <br />  <br /> It only gets two stars because for the first time ever, I have to skip tracks on a Diana Krall CD.
0743442539|5.0|THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD is the quintessential cold war espionage novel.  For four decades, this early LeCarre tale has served as the benchmark for 'spy thriller' writing.  Reading it fresh in 2004, it's easy to see why. <br /> <br />Though THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD was only LeCarre's third novel, his strengths as a storyteller are fully evident here.  The opening chapter alone serves as a narrative tour-de-force, swiftly and adroitly introducing the reader to the central characters, their impossible situation, and the hopeless, duplicitous world they inhabit.  It is beautfully mirrored by the final chapter, in which the consequences of protagonist Alec Leamas' weakness becomes excruciatingly, tragically clear.   <br /> <br />In terms of both style and structure, this early work seems to take its cues from Grahame Greene's '50s novels -- particularly THE QUIET AMERICAN.  As in Greene, LeCarre's descriptions here are spare and succinct, with characters and situations quickly sketched in razor-sharp detail.  Like Greene, this writer shows that sacrifice of innocents at the hands of arrogant ideologues has become mundane.  He reveals the tragic complicity of all-too-human agents like Alec Leamas.  Yet LeCarre does not share Greene's belief in personal redemption:  His characters take it for granted that they live in an amoral labyrinth in which treachery and triple-cross are simply routine. <br /> <br />Economy and intelligence are hallmarks of this work.  Dialogue is terse, sharp; plot complications are introduced with a minimum of fuss.  LeCarre sketches his players deftly, in medias res, as they run the gauntlet.   Consequently, this 224-page novel can be read in two sittings, yet its characters and situations seem fully realized -- and its tragic conclusion hits with tremendous impact. <br /> <br />THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD is an early work, by a writer still looking to more experienced hands for models.  It would be almost a decade beforeLeCarre truly came into his own, with TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY.  Still, it's clear that this novel is more than just a superlatively crafted  'spy thriller', more than just a classic of the genre.  Forty years after its first publication, LeCarre's tragic tale has lost none of its power:  THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD remains an extraordinary masterwork, by a supremely gifted and intelligent writer.
B00006AG5N|5.0|This collection, along with 2nd To None, make a perfect spotlight on the recording career of Elvis Presley. I highly recommend these two titles to anyone who feels they need to have some Elvis in their collection. For a serious Elvis collector they are repeating songs that you would already have over and over and you may not be interested, apart from being a completist. But to introduce someone to Elvis you simply couldn't put together a better example. Sit back, listen
B000286SCO|5.0|I managed to get my hands on Live in Tokyo back in 1995, and the move to capture the content on DVD was a good one.  Images and Words was the defining album for Dream Theater, and seeing the performance highlights exactly why.  While the band has continued to grow and their style has evolved, its amazing to return back to the roots of this amazing band and really appreciate just how talented these guys are.  I'm amazed when I reflect back and realize that I enjoy the music and live shows as much now as I did then.  While I believe Jordan has added a musical element that DT was lacking, there's something to be said for looking back 10 years to see where the band has come from. <br /> <br />While perhaps not quite as strong, 5 Years in a Live Time is really a good watch and a good addition to the music DVD collection.  And for this price, it can't be beat. <br /> <br />Of course, any DT fan won't need convincing to purchase this DVD set; you probably already have it.  But for the casual fan who has a sincere respect for amazing progressive rock music played to perfection by some of the most amazing, talented musicians still active, this set is definitely worth the relatively minimal investment for what you receive.   <br /> <br />You won't regret it.
B00023BLXK|5.0|There were a lot of bad reviews for Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights, and after talking to others that had seen it, and hearing their opinions, I had decided that it was a movie I could do without seeing. However, I recently decided to give it a shot, and I couldn't believe how wonderful it was! I watched it twice right in a row. You can't get enough of the music and the dancing and the rhythm. It is definately just as good as the first, if not better. Just goes to show that you have to see things for yourself rather than listen to everyone else. Bottom line: definately a must see!
B0000C2IQD|4.0|Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is a real challenge. The problem with the film lies in the title song, which is probably the least inspired musical effort in the Canon of Richard M. and Robert B. Sherman. Just saying &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot; is a mouthful, but having to hear it performed SEVEN times during this film is taxing. <br />  <br /> But once you get over the redundancy of that, you'll find a fine story performed by a wonderful cast. Dick Van Dyke turns in his typically wonderous work as the Crack Pot inventor Caractacus Potts, and Sally Ann Howes as Ian Fleming's Bond Girl named &quot;Truly Scrumptious,&quot; his rival, then love interest. <br />  <br /> But for kids it's all about the car that can fly in the air and sail on the sea. For a film made in the late 1960s, the special effects are remarkable, and the film is shot beautifully. <br />  <br /> This DVD package is especially good because you get a bonus disc with some very interesting featurettes, including a press conference style interview with Van Dyke who had just started filming on location in Great Britain and other bits including a documentary piece on all of the Potts &quot;inventions&quot; for the film and an interview with the guy who is the caretaker of the film's famous vehicle. <br />  <br /> Overall, the movie may not be quite as good as &quot;Mary Poppins,&quot; but it's right there with &quot;Willy Wonka!&quot; <br />  <br /> Highly recommended.

B000002KB8|4.0|Black Sabbath began when four schoolmates from Birmingham, England, Ozzy Osbourne, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, and Bill Ward quit their bands (Ozzy and Geezer were in Rare Breed, Tony and Bill were in Mythology) and joined forces to become the Polka Tulk Blues Band in 1968 which was eventually shortened to &quot;Polka Tulk&quot; Ernest Chataway on Rhythm Guitar and Alan Clark on Saxophone. Chataway eventually quit the band and Jimmy Phillips came in on Slide Guitar. The band then dropped both Phillips and Clark and changed their name to &quot;Earth&quot;. Apparently, there was another band called Earth in the area, which led to a club booking Ozzy and the gang expecting a completely different kind of music. To avoid confusion, the band renamed themselves &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; after a movie playing across the street from where the band rehearsed (Butler thought it sounded dark and gloomy). On the day that Iommi was to quit his job to fully devote his time to Sabbath, his fingertips were chopped off in an accident at his workplace. Iommi was inspired by the great jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt, whose third and fourth fingers were fused from birth and useless. Iommi experimented with many materials until he found that putting plastic &quot;fingertips&quot; on his fingers would allow him to play again. However, he would have to give the strings more slack, so he tuned them down a step and a half, which created Sabbath's muddy sound and gave birth to Heavy Metal itself. <br /> On February Thirteenth, 1970, Black Sabbath released this album in United Kingdom on the Vertigo label, and released it on June First, 1970 in United States on the Warner label. This album eventually sold Platinum in United States, making it the third-top-selling album in Black Sabbath history. <br /> This was the band's first album and was outsold by their second album, &quot;&quot;Paranoid&quot;&quot;. This album is one of the greatest guitar albums of all time. This album included the lineupof: <br /> (Thanks to Black Sabbath Online): <br /> * Tony Iommi - Lead Guitar & Keyboards <br /> * Geezer Butler - Bass <br /> * Ozzy Osbourne - Vocals * <br /> * Bill Ward - Drums <br /> * Roger Bain - Producer (for Tony Hall Enterprises) <br /> * Tom Allom & Barry Sheffield - Engineers  <br />  <br /> * - Spelled Ossie Osbourne on the original version of the album. <br />  <br /> All songs are Iommi/Osborne/Butler/Ward, except for &quot;Warning&quot;, which is by Ansley Dunbar. <br />  <br /> &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; (6:20) (5/5): Dark, gloomy, and slow. The second-best song on this album. <br />  <br /> &quot;The Wizard&quot; (4:23) (4/5): Bluesy, heavy rocker with Ozzy on harmonica. Incredible drumming from Bill Ward. <br />  <br /> &quot;Behind The Wall Of Sleep/Wasp&quot; and &quot;N.I.B./Basically&quot; (9:44) (5/5): On this CD, these two songs are combined. In &quot;Wasp&quot;, Iommi just plays the guitar, and well. &quot;Behind The Wall Of Sleep&quot; is a somewhat melodic, heavy, echoy rocker. &quot;Basically&quot; is an awesome bass solo. &quot;N.I.B.&quot; is pure genius, and &quot;N.I.B./Basically&quot; together make the greatest bass performance by Geezer Butler ever and the fourth-greatest on the album. <br />  <br /> &quot;Wicked World&quot; (4:46) (5/5): &quot;Wicked World&quot; is Black Sabbath's greatest song, no doubt. Completely awesome. A hard-rocking song. &quot;Wicked World&quot; is also the best song on this album. <br />  <br /> &quot;Sleeping Village/A Bit Of Finger&quot; and &quot;Warning&quot; (14:15) (5/5): On this CD, these two songs are combined. &quot;Sleeping Village/A Bit Of Finger&quot; is a good, hard rocker. &quot;Warning&quot; is excellent. Included is Tony Iommi's greatest guitar solo.

B0001Z52RU|5.0|Ashton Kutcher's first dramatic/dark movie is an underrated (Amazon-vote wise, not box office) tale of a guy with memory-changing powers. Evan, Ashton's character, has had multiple blackouts during his childhood, usually when a stressful or highly traumatic event occurs. Later in his life, he reviews journals he kept of those days and finds himself able to relive those memories, and ultimately change them. <br />  <br /> The reason I am giving this movie 5 stars is because it is so uniquely original. It has the gumption to portray an ugly childhood (something very few movies have the courage to do), and the ending(s) of both the theatrical and director's cut are so unique and appropriate that they truly reflect Evan's character and the lessons he learned. The ending is gutsy and flawless, as opposed to one that pandered to the quick atavistic wants of a sappy, happy ending needing crowd. May I say that the above DVD also includes the sappy version for those home video owners who feel that they cannot sleep without knowing &quot;everything turned out okay.&quot; <br />  <br /> This movie has the most amazing casting I've ever seen in a film. Not only did the double directors find a surprisingly perfect adult cast (with Amy Smart able to play four different Kayleigh's), they found two groups of 4 kids each that resembled the adult character in different stages of childhood. You might as well be fooled into believing this movie was shot over 15 years, as these characters appear to be, in essence, that character when he was 22, 13, 8, etc. These kids are absolutely (add italics and bold type) indistinguishable from the character when he/she was older. <br />  <br /> The plot, as some reviewers have suggested, has some minor holes but I believe they can be patched fairly quickly. One reviewer comments that Evan keeps his journals even after he changes his past so often. Well, you can't change human nature, and while there remain traumatizing events in Evan's life, he will be destined to keep journal entries. Additionally, Evan does not always have these journals with him. Later in the movie, when he finds himself at the Sunnyvale Institution, he is journal-less, as his father was, who it is deeply hinted had the same power. The plot is absolutely excellent, and flawless. It is especially intriguing to see where Evan ends up after changing one slight detail in his past. Just as a satellite dish can be moved one sixteenth of an inch and miss its target satellite by 3000 miles, a slight detail change in your childhood could very well have put you on a much different path in your adulthood. This is in essence the chaos theory of the butterfly effect. Absolutely excellent concepts. <br />  <br /> This movie was dark, and may not appeal to some viewers. It contains very violent scenes. In particular, a child sets fire to a dog, and a little girl is hit in the side of the head with a 2x4. Also there are deep undertones of father-daughter molestation. Simply my mentioning these scenes may turn some potential viewers off of this movie, but these scenes are absolutely essential to understand the character development within the story, and to show the viewer that all childhoods are not pleasant, merry, and held in good memory. <br />  <br /> In conclusion, this is an excellent film. It was a movie the directors had planned and written and rewritten and storyboarded over 7 years. The DVD, with the Infinifilm option, is excellent, as you can match up storyboards to the scenes. It subtely reminds me of &quot;Pop Up Video&quot;, now long gone from VH1. Furthermore, the DVD includes a help menu on absolutely everything, a pleasant change that even includes instructions on how to adjust your television settings to color bars. Five Stars, both hands numb from holding my thumbs up.
B00006AG5N|5.0|I grew up listening to Elvis because my Dad loved his music so much. I gotta say, I love him too. This is my first Elvis CD and my Dad is completely pleased.. All the classics along with &quot;A little less conversation&quot; updated. It's wonderful. I listen to this CD constantly because the music is just so great. No wonder Elvis endures when the music industry is becoming so manipulative and plastic. <br /> It is absolutely great!!
B0001I562I|5.0|I used to watch this movie growing up.  I love the character Max.  He has a great personality.  I love how they are now putting older movies on DVD.  Now they can preserved for a long time.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Kanye West is one of the FEW current rappers that displays any musical merit.  His songs are very intelligent, humorous, and musical!  His rhymes are very infectious, and I have listened to this CD many times in the past few weeks.  This is one of the few CDs that has made me laugh out loud at work or home.  Nothing seems to be missing from this CD... I highly recommend it.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|Gavin, Gavin, Gavin, man...this album is unreal and then the stripped! wow, the whole thing is amazing. i truely couldnt ask for more, been a fan for about 2 years now and i cant wait to hear your new stuff! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!! <br /> <br />~Nick~
B00006RCOB|3.0|One of those movies I wish I'd seen at aged 12 on a Saturday afternoon after the serial and cartoon.  Even so, great fun despite some slow bits.  A case of let your self go and go along for the ride.  Haven't YOU ever dreamt about stealing a jet fighter and going for the ride of your life?
055357342X|5.0|This book is devestating. This book is simply amazing too. After the slight stutter of book 2, A Song of Ice and Fire is back strong. You will not believe where this book goes, but as things are happening, I was not surprised. I have come to expect nothing from Martin, he will take this wherever he wants and wherever he feels driven. The things that happen make sense, even if you cannot see hope for a lot of the characters.     If A Clash of Kings was considered a sequel, then A Storm of Swords can be considered its own magnum opus. Martin's writing is just as stellar as ever and the plot moves along at a steady pace. I do not see Robert Jordan's failings creeping into Martin's writing. Holding to the theme of a quasi-history novel, Martin begins to stir things up a little bit more with some magic-related things. You may dislike certain characters, but by the end of this book, you will better understand them and their desires.     Simply amazing, really. This is epic fantasy at its best . . . no, this is adult fantasy at its best. The deepest sorrows, but the depth of humanity in the characters is unrivaled.
B00008RH1H|1.0|Throne of Blood, is no doubt one of Kurosawa's  masterpieces. One of my all time favourite films. <br />The NON CRITERION EDITION of this movie however, from HONG KONG or other asian imports is absolutly not worth the money. I ordered mine from 'edaymovie.com' through amazon hoping to save a few bucks. ( We'd all like to own Criterion editions ). The print is very scratchy, there is a really bad weave in the print ( picture moves from side to side ), The sound distorts on deep bass, but overall I think the most dissapointing aspect of this worthless edition is the English Translation. I don't think Shakespeare or even Kurosawa himself would appreciate the words SH** and BULLSH**, in any interpretations of the original tounge !. It is like an the work of a 9 year old. Translations are very important to the 'mise en scene' . The other annoying aspect is the the sub titles are in a garish YELLOW, Yuk. I would like my money back but hey what do you expect for $12 these days.
0553573403|4.0|As has been repeated over and over again, this book is real. Magic does play a part in the series, but its not like most fantasy books where the magic is the most important and/or powerful thing. This is character and plot driven and written exceptionally well. The chapter setup is a nice way to write the story, as it is from a diff character's perspective each chapter.<br /><br /> So, what makes these books realistic? People die. Sometimes they don't. The obvious things don't happen. Sometime they do. The intrigue is simply disturbing at times. Things only hinted at in this first book come to a forefront in the second and third books, but they just sneaks up on you.<br /><br /> It is hard to explain this series without describing the entire plot. This book is slightly hard to get into at first, you can't really see what is so amazing about it. And don't expect a warm feeling of elation at the end of a chapter or book when the &quot;good&quot; guys beat the &quot;bad&quot; guys. In this series, everyone is tainted somehow. Flaws abound. As do strengths.
B0001UL7RY|3.0|I bought Let Go last year, and loved it. Then I recently got this one, and I liked it okay. The songs mostly sound the same, and Avril totally changed her sound and her style of singing. Yeah, the lyrics are a little more mature, I'll give her that. But in my opinion, Let Go is much better.  <br />  <br /> My personal favorites on this album are Don't Tell Me, How Does it Feel, My Happy Ending, and Freak Out.  <br />  <br /> I would reccomend this to Avril fans, but buy Let Go first, if you haven't already.
0553579908|4.0|This book is exceedingly difficult to get into at first . . . well, the first few hundred pages. The pace slows down greatly as compared to A Game of Thrones. Whereas in the first book at the end of each chapter, something usually happened, most of the chapters in A Clash Of Kings end in nothing. I do not need a constant cliffhanger, but the first half of the book is serious plot setup.     After the earthquake of the first book, the kings in this here second book establish themselves. A new character chapter is added, along with other characters like Theon (which I hate, and probably will for a good while, but thats beside the point). Once you get through the rough period in the first half of the book, things begin to pick up. Keep in mind, that this is George R.R. Martin I am talking about, so even though it was borderline boring for a time, its still written well and rich.    Not as good as the first, its definitely a sequel, but by the end things are twisted around and you eagerly await the next book, which just happens to be my favorite of the series so far.    Edit: Upon later reflection and re-reading, this is my favorite book. It's the \\"Empire Strikes Back\\" of the series so far.
B00005MAM2|5.0|I think this movie is a good example of anime,this movie got me in to anime because it has a cool storyline and good animation, I don't reccomend this just to anime fans but  to anyone, even if your not fan of anime, this movie will get you into anime
B00003003R|5.0|The cd starts off with a raw, spot-on night train which is a perfect sum of what Guns n Roses are... a hard, raw, well rehersed live band.  The songs were recorded at different locations and times (all featuring Izzy Stradlin).  The band sounds flawless, Axles voice is dead on, Slash doesn't hold back and fails to miss a single note, and Izzy Duff, Matt/Steven-(on earlier tracks),and Dizzy hold the whole show together with swagger and style.  Its hard to choose highlights because of how it was recorded.  Each song is the best it can be.  Theres a great version of November Rain.  Patience was played with acoustic guitars and the crowd can be heard loud and clear (you'll see).  This is a definate must have cd for and GnR fan.  The two disks are crammed with all there hits.  GnR is one of the greatest Rock n Roll bands of all time and this is just more proof of that.
B0001ZX0PG|2.0|Up to a point the film is beautifully directed and filmed. However, it is, in my opinion, marred by over-acting from Sean Penn and a very unsatisfying, implausible climax and resolution. That's at least two problems for this 'true to life whodunnit' that great performances from Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon can not overcome.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This album is just as good, if not better than (not to mention completely opposite from) IOWA, and I am torn between which I like better. I'll go through it song by song. <br /> <br />1. Prelude 3.0- Their best intro. It's an actual song, and a good one two. With the smooth electronics and melodic singing, it totally takes your guard down for the next track <br /> <br />2. The Blister Exists- Awesome heavy track, kind of reminds of of some Master of Puppets- era Metallica. <br /> <br />3. 3 Nil- The heaviest track but not the best. Take (sic), Eyeless, People=$$$$,Disasterpiece, throw in some garbage and their you have it. <br /> <br />4. Duality- The first single. Awesome Choruses but the spoken word verses get kind of annoying after a few listens. <br /> <br />5. Opium of the People- Awesome heavy verses lead to great melodic chorus. One of my faves <br /> <br />6. Circle- Acoustic Track, way better than Stone Sour's bother. The background sounds at end take over the piano and that can get annoying. Fire Chris and Sid I say! <br /> <br />7. Welcome- Horrible attempt to recreate the heaviness of IOWA. Too sloppy, bad songwriting. <br /> <br />8. Vermillion- Their next single, good track but not as good as part 2. <br /> <br />9. Pulse of the Maggots- Our new National Anthem. <br /> <br />10. Before I forget- My favorite. Poppy Stone Sour-esque song. <br /> <br />11. Vermillion Part 2.- Acoustic song, better than part one. <br /> <br />12. The Nameless- Very diverse song with intense verses and soft melodic choruses. Could fit on IOWA. Very Good. <br /> <br />13. The Virus of Life- Attempt at a Zombie/Manson sound. They don't get it, but it's still cool anyway. <br /> <br />14. Danger, Keep Away- Awesome soft track. Great singing.Another one of my favs. <br /> <br />All in all it's very different from what Slipknot has done in the past but if you give it a try, you'll love it. Five Stars, great heavy metal disk. <br /> <br />PEACE!
B000286S8S|5.0|I think its a great package actually. Its more in depth than the last 'best of' album (having an extra disk helps!)and I really like the new songs on this one. Yes, it IS about time!  <br /> <br />The other best of album ran things in chronological order but this set seems to have the order quite random...perhaps someone more perceptive than I has seen the pattern. <br /> <br />Of course, just like everyone else, I think there are some songs missing but hey, you don't get 'Humans Being' on this one like last time but you do get 'Hot For Teacher' which we didn't last time. Its always a toss up on 'best of' albums and no one is ever 100% happy with every song picked. No use arguing about that... <br /> <br />Overall its a great lead up to the concert series and I'm really happy I bought it.
B00008CLOA|5.0|Dark Side of the Moon has undoubtedly been one of the most popular albums for decades, and with good reasons. The lyrics are very well written alongside the instrumental compositions. The opening track Speak To Me has signature bits from the songs that follow, giving you a look at the varying aspects the album has to offer. <br />  <br /> Breathe is a slow-going song that pretty much sets the tone for Dark Side of the Moon. The instrumental On The Run features quick-paced synthesizer sounds which represent the title well. Time brings back the lyrics expressing the discontent with the seemingly unyielding speed in which our lives seem to go. The Great Gig In The Sky is another instrumental that this time features the wailing voice of Clare Torry as an instrument - not necessarily singing words. Money is a song stressing society's common bond of greed and its ill effects.  <br />  <br /> Us and Them is my personal favorite of the album - there doesn't really seem to be a core message in this song, but it invokes an intense sense of emotion throughout both the lyrics and music. Any Colour You Like is a fairly funky instrumental followed up by the relatively well-known Brain Damage, a song about madness. Eclipse finalizes a very unique album that I think deserves a chance from listeners of all genres. This was my first and favorite Pink Floyd album and I highly recommend Dark Side of the Moon to anyone who is willing to give it a try.
