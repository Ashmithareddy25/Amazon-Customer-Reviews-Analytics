B005FISBTO|5.0|There is no contest, no comparison, no one finer than  Dexter and his &#34;Dark Passenger&#34;. Whenever an episode is over I just cant stand it until the next episode comes out!
B005LAIHUO|2.0|\\"Jack the Giant Slayer\\" is similar to taking the familiar tale \\"Jack and the Beanstalk\\" and sloppily smashing it together with the 1962 film \\"Jack the Giant Killer.\\" A commoner named Jack (Nicholas Hoult) trades his uncle's horse for beans that turn into giant beanstalks when exposed to water. The beanstalks serve as the sole passageway from our world to the giants towering above us in the sky, who have been aching to get back down to earth to resume their ongoing war with the humans. After Jack gives the adventure seeking Princess Isabelle (Eleanor Tomlinson) shelter in his shack during a storm, a loose bean gets wet and carries Jack's shack along with the princess up into the sky. Isabelle's father King Brahmwell (Ian McShane) sends his best men including Elmont (Ewan McGregor), Crawe (Eddie Marsan), Isabelle's arranged fianc&eacute; Roderick (Stanley Tucci), and Roderick's right hand man Wicke (Ewen Bremner) while Jack volunteers his services to rescue the princess and prevent the giants from destroying everyone and everything in the land.<br /><br />The movie begins with both Jack and Isabelle being told the story of the giants at a young age, but every visual illustrating the tale is pure CG. This wouldn't be much of an issue, but the CG looks incredibly dated. If you've ever played video games and still own consoles that aren't jam packed with wi-fi, hard drives, and endless forms of media then odds are the graphics from older games look pretty cheesy today. In the span of five years or less technology improves dramatically when it comes to computer generation. The special effects in the opening of \\"Jack the Giant Slayer\\" look the way Playstation 2 graphics look now. It's not necessarily bad, but it appears to be from a time most people don't care to remember.<br /><br />While the cinematography is fairly impressive at times as you travel at inhuman speed across a roaming countryside or have this fantastic view of the king's castle as you seem to look down from the heavens, most of the special effects look out of place. Similar motion capture technology used in Robert Zemeckis' CG films (\\"The Polar Express,\\" \\"Beowulf,\\" and \\"A Christmas Carol\\") was used in \\"Jack the Giant Slayer\\" to bring these giants to life. Those effects look fine when the world they inhabit is also computer generated, but look kind of awkward when they're interacting with a realistic world. Unfortunately nothing ever looks genuine as you can clearly tell when a green screen is used and when pieces of beanstalk look plastic when they aren't computer generated. It just seems like the special effects are one step behind most recent films. Maybe the film sitting on the shelf for eight months can contribute to that.<br /><br />What's more is that this is supposed to be an adventure, but a dangerous journey shouldn't feel so run of the mill. The film is kind of boring most of the time since it follows \\"Jack and the Beanstalk\\" almost religiously and then even the giant kills aren't anything all that great. The film is PG-13, but probably could have pushed for a hard PG. Other than, \\"bastard,\\" being yelled once and a human being thrown on the ground by a giant on-screen every gruesome moment is shown off-screen. The film doesn't feel dark enough to garner a PG-13 rating, so it results in feeling extremely watered down. Most of the characters aren't given a lot of time to properly portray good and evil. Jack and Isabelle are basically exactly the same character except one is rich and the other is poor, Elmont starts off being kind of smart-mouthed but eventually turns into a clich&eacute; soldier, and the gap between Roderick's teeth is way more offensive than anything the character does in the film.<br /><br />It's more than a little disappointing when it finally comes time for the humans to fight against the giants. Other than throwing bells the size of houses and trees that are lit on fire the giants don't seem to pose much of a threat. There's a scene where everyone is trying to prevent the giants from getting into King Brahmwell's kingdom. There's a drawbridge that the human's are trying to close and the giants are trying to keep open. A giant should be big enough and strong enough to overpower at least 30 men on his own. There are what looks like maybe 200 humans max trying to pull that drawbridge closed and 20 giants trying to keep it open and somehow that's evenly matched for nearly ten minutes straight. Either all of the King's men are hopped up on some ancient version of steroids cooked up with nothing but twigs and berries or those are the weakest giants in anything ever.<br /><br />\\"Jack the Giant Slayer\\" feels so plain and ordinary and only came to fruition to try and capitalize on films like \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" and \\"Snow White and the Huntsman.\\" Chock full of paper thin characters and dated special effects, \\"Jack the Giant Slayer\\" is mostly just extremely predictable and seems massively unnecessary. Just think director Bryan Singer is trying to incorporate the same motion capture technology he used in this film on \\"X-Men: Days of Future Past.\\" Imagine how much of a disappointment that will be if it's anything like this.s trying to prevent the giants from getting into King Brahmwell's kingdom.

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|It was a little lighter look at predjudice, bigotry and hate. The writer really hit her stride writing this book. Its hard to treat this subject matter delicately enough without becoming sickeningly mundane and morose, but this author hit this just right
1609611543|5.0|Even if you don't go off wheat or reduce your intake, it's absolutely essential that you at least get educated on modern-day Frankenwheat...Wheat Belly explains how and why wheat is not wheat anymore and why it is slowly killing us.  I've never regarded wheat the same since I finished this book! Consumers need to know what they are truly eating as well as the enormous scope of this problem.  Maybe if the population gets educated and angry enough things will change and we can get our old vintage wheat back!  I did try the Wheat Belly diet for 2 months and my hunger disappeared quickly and permanently, as predicted.  I did not lose weight though because I was thin to begin with.  I'm sticking to a reduced-wheat diet where the only wheat I consume is pizza now and then (I just can't give that up!)
B00B49L7JY|5.0|This documentary relates the fascinating and yet somewhat tragic story of Sixto Rodriguez. This is a musician that deserves more recognition and the film takes the viewer along for the search to uncover this mysterious artist.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I read the book and saw the movie.  The idea of a story being based on the survival of a boy on a raft with a tiger was interesting.  At times it was necessary to question what was really going on even early on in the book.  However, by the time the reader reaches the conclusion, the question remains:  what really happened?  This is a book that would warrant a second read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a fun ge to if I were u I would got this game I was like man this is the best game that is out thaer
B00632HWOG|5.0|I chose this rating because it saves me the hasel of going into my office and getting on it to pull up Yahoo.
B00127RAJY|1.0|I will start by saying, I absolutely love this dvd and have had some good results.  I am in decent shape but recovering from a back injury which helped me put on an extra 10 pounds over the past few years.  This workout kicked my butt and I have already lost some body fat.  I love her workouts and that is why I am so disappointed in the website (jillianmichaels.com).  I thought I was able to create a login to check out her sight for free and I denied any charges and/or upgrades.  I honestly don't remember giving them my credit card and the card they charged has been sitting in a drawer for 6 months...I was charged on 2/2/13.  When I disputed the charge with jillianmichaels.com they refused to refund me.  I explained I would never have agreed to this because I am in school full time and not working so I could not afford this at all.  I looked at the site once and never went back.  Honestly, not sure what they are charging $52 a quarter for exactly..so I can log my food and exercise?  Myfitnesspal app does that better and for free.  She does give you some meal recommendations but I am a dietetics major and a vegetarian so those were of no interest to me.  The site may be a great resource for some but just not for me.  Just beware that there is a charge and you have to email them or call them to cancel, there is no way to simply do it from the website.  I don't want anyone else to make the same mistake I did.<br />Don't let this stop you from getting this dvd though, it is a good one!
0061091480|3.0|just seems like it was for a younger generations...so wish I had it when it first came out..Dyer interests me, so had to check it out :)  did love the chapter about procrastination tho :)
B00AREIAI8|4.0|it is fun but i feel it should let the customer do more around the grounds becauseall udo is groom feed and compete
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It's a fun read full of witty banter and classic fifty drama. Plus, the first half is pretty steamy ;)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really good game keeps you playing for ages definitely a game to get. Great graphics no problems ever with it.
1417618108|5.0|Great book, better than the movie HANDS DOWN!!!!! Love Damon, but the book rules! Ludlum rocks by golly gee whiz!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|His best work yet. I have read everything he's written and this one kept me on the edge of my seat. So close to what is going on with the Chinese right now as far as cyber security goes.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I liked the subject content, it made you aware that this really happens in real life. The setting, time of year and part of country.  You didn't want to put it down. I have only read on other Nicholas Sparks book, but I will read more now.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it so much I have 20 horses and a cold iv db. urdguj ijbbgdgvbg it was the is
B009FZHYKU|5.0|excellent all of the season 3 in one place. Watch all of this season without commercial interruption and back to back
B007SGM084|5.0|This is a very good story. It kept me on the edge of my chair. I couldn't put it down until I read all three books.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Bought Walking Dead season 2 & 3 which allows you to watch them in a shorter time with no commercials. Excellent
B004XQYBA2|5.0|It is not every day that I cannot think of one thing negative to say about an Android application. ;)<br /><br />But I can honestly say that this is the perfect Sudoku game on Android! What's not to love? Features galore. Great interface. Tons of polish. A perfect range of difficulty options. No draconian/unnecessary/suspect permissions. I can go on and on. It's all here.<br /><br />This is how it should be done on Android. This is a great FAOTD -- yet I would still pay for this game and would have paid had I come across it before.<br /><br />Sudoku puzzles aren't for everyone of course but if you do enjoy this type of puzzle, I cannot imagine how it could get any better than this.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B00846REIS|5.0|I think this is better than fifty shades!! Never a dull moment! I couldn't put it down, it was addicting from the beginning!
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Changed our lives.  Inconvenient Truth helps you look at the world from the perspective of our Creator.  The Earth is here for us to govern, respect, and love.  When we leave this world, we should leave it better than when we found it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book has everything: action, adventure, suspense, romance and even a bit of humour. Masterfully written as well the pages seem to come alive with every word! Once I started I couldn't put it down until I came to the end. I was thoroughly entertained from beginning to end!
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|I chose this version because it was free and I'm a big fan of Jane Austen.  It's nice to have her collection available to read when the time becomes available and it's difficult to beat the price.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Excellent read on a great american hero.  A must read for everyone.  Everybody needs to buy and read this and write about it.
B009X01FJS|4.0|Very nice case that provides a variety of options for holding or displaying the Kindle Fire.  I really like the color too.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Wow! This begins very easy and works up to &#34;how can I win this game&#34;. So interesting when trying to outsmart each game and move up to the next, more difficult, level. Not for the impatient. Good product.
0385535147|2.0|I usually like Grisham. At his best, he is a wonderful plotter, good developer of characters, nice  portrayer of settings and creator of interesting scenes. But at the end of this one, I was sorry for having given it so much time. Not much of it could have developed in the way it does. Maybe in this day and age of dystopian fantasy novels, there ought to be a new genre--crime fantasy. I've read elsewhere that Grisham feels the pressure of having to produce a new novel on a schedule dictated by his publishing contract. It shows, and that's a shame.
B007THA4FI|5.0|This book shouldn't be mistaken as young reading material. Although all of J.K. Rowlings books appeal to adults in some way, The Casual Vacancy is different from Harry Potter because it is frank and vivid in describing sex, drug addiction and the often harrowing burdens of mental illness.<br /><br />However, I recommend this book because it is bravely realistic. The author has suggested that, if the whole book were condensed into one sentence, it would be \\"What do we do about Krystal Weedon?\\" [...]
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This Was Amazing , I Will Read This Over And Over Again . Loved It !!! I'll Definitely Recommend This .
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This was a good book I am going to tell my friends to read this book I want to read it
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I think this is one of the best of the Doctor Who series. He sets a more intriguing mystery about the Doctor than many of the others.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|This blu-ray collection is great. The movies look so much better from when I first saw them. This will have you in the house for a day.
B0047Y0FGY|2.0|After reading 75-100 pages, some of which had very funny bits, I just stopped because that's all there was--just occasional funny bits. I'd hoped to learn  more about Ms. Fey but she does not reveal much about herself in her stories. She is a sketch writer and it shows.
B007712XAU|5.0|She loves her new DVD's. A friend let her watch the series now she loves having her own in the house.
B000BT97AO|4.0|This is truly a unique film. It's almost like it was drug influenced it is so far out there, amazing imagination.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|searches are harder than many other games. keeps you busy. still wish they'd be upfront about having to pay to finish.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use. Very convenient when on the go. Easier to use than on my cellphone. Would recommend this app to others. Only con is the ads
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game all kids can play! It is fun to play when you want to go on your device. I truly recommend this game!
0812416503|1.0|lRECEIVED THE BOOK IN GOOD TIME BUT WAS TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS SO CALLED HARDCOVER? IT WAS THE SAME SIZE AS A PAPERBACK , THE PAPER WAS POOR QUALITY AND SMALL PRINT. HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SATISFIED WITH AMAZON, BUT NOT THIS TIME.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|great puzzler<br /><br />great puzzler,  challenger  and a lot of fun for pretty much every one  you will love it tons<br />i know i did<br />take care all<br /><br />!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|The story line was ok but really drawn out. I was just wanting it to end. I don't think it was as great as it was hyped up to be.  Writing quality was average but it was, nonetheless entertaining.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! The colors are very vibrant. Its addicting! I find myself wanting to play all the time!
B008HK3XU4|3.0|Love the cover and how it fits and work on the kindle. I bought the purple one and it is already wearing on the corners. I just got it a month ago.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a fun felt game that all would want to play. With tons of little surprises every so often.
B009AP2G26|5.0|I am anxiously awaiting the new episodes coming out! I LOVE Glee and the story just keeps getting better and better!!!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|The graphics aren't great, and you have to tilt your kindle back and fourth, and sometimes it doesn't listen.  In my opinion, I like Temple Run much better.  Thanks for taking your time to read my review.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I gave this a 5 star rating because I don't want people to think Lindsey's music is bad, because her music is amazing.  What is bad about this cd is that the audio is recorded in 128 kbps bit rate.  This is a CD, it should have an insanely high bit rate, which would give the music excellent sound quality.  If you want the highest quality music, I would recommend you purchase her album from the Google Play Store where they have her music in 320 kbps bit rate format.
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|i was able to play this for a short time on my kindle fire, but after that I couldn't get past the load screen. Was a lot of fun while i could play it though!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It was good!!  A lot better than the movie.  I read the book before I saw the movie and was a little disappointed with the movie.  I love Nicholas Sparks books and I would recommend this to everyone!!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love this book it is totally awesome  then will educate u with big words the learn they get to big
B0076DELIG|4.0|As usual Michael Connelly has used Bosch to craft another great whodunit. It was a little slow at the start but kept me reading as it became more involved with the facts coming into the case.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Very great game runs nicely! I'm a huge minecraft fan so if you're into minecraft then this game is for you. Good quality.
B008AX1HD8|4.0|It is really good crime novel this is the 2nd book I read from Jo Nesbo and I like a lot his way to tell the story.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is just so awesome! I would give it 20 stars if I could. It's not as fun as the computer version it still is awesome. The game could use some updates like night on creative and mine carts I suggest you buy the game. It's so cool.
B003O86FMW|4.0|It is not as good as the first one but still is nice book and of course you need to read it to finish and understand the whole story.
B00A1U2SVS|5.0|The worst part of this album is that they won't go on tour for the world to enjoy the rock that is Led Zep.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It is great the evolution of the 3rd part of this trilogy, the best book is the 1st one but the 3rd one makes the story even greater.
B007SGM084|2.0|I like racey books and story with great sex, but this book was too much.  The first book was great and 1/2 of the second and then it just go to be the same ole thing page after page.  All they seemed to be able to do is email each other and have sex over and over with nothing new about it.  I didn't even read the 3rd one.  I found myself flipping pages because there was no substance.  However I am very curious who the actors will be in the movie...I just hope it doesn't turn into a 4 hour movie!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It is a really entertainment book and it catch you since the very begining of the book.<br /><br />It is worthy to read it.
B0092EE5HY|5.0|Was quite sad when I finished book, wish Martin would continue this story. Very well written, found myself following the punctuation very carefully. Will now try Fevre Dream
B004LWZW6K|5.0|i think that there are more breast shots in this movie then the first one.  In this movie it is based at a water park that turns wild.  David Hasselhoff plays the life guard in the movie but he does nothing at all literally but just sit on the life guard seat watching.  he runs to get someone only once.  would be better if they had David to actually do some life guard stuff.
1611134226|5.0|As always Preston and Child delivered an awesome story. An engrossing story full of twists and surprises. If you are a fan you will love the continuation of the saga, if you are a first time reader you will also enjoy the story and when you are done will find yourself wanting more.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|So far this has been perfect - used every day - the old one simply fell apart - hope this one last a lot longer.
B00ATP24SW|3.0|Aren't most reviews, but some people tend to forget that.  One thing that drives me absolutely crazy about some band fanboys/girls is that few of them can accept sometimes even their beloved bands can have an aural hiccup every now and then. Doesn't mean someone isn't a \\"true fan\\".  That happened to me with Kamelot's 'Poetry for the Poisoned' and now with 'Nemesis'.<br /><br />It has taken me over twenty listens for some songs to resonate and for now my favorites are Halcyon Days, Stand My Ground and One Must Fall. That may change.<br /><br />In my mind an 'okay' Stratovarius album is always a million times better than the BEST Top 40 sludge churned out on the airwaves.  Not that Nemesis is bad in my mind, but the hallmarks that I've grown to expect are more muted this time. I was expecting an album named for the goddess of retribution to be somewhat heavier and darker. Makes sense right? Even Timo's vocals lack their signature punch. The only instruments which have more impact are Jens Johanssen's keyboards and Lauri Porra's bass. Interestingly enough the one song I love--Halcyon Days--is the one song that seems to be driving some hardcore Strato fans berserk.  To be honest, I don't even know why I like it, lol.  Maybe I'm just in a place mentally where this song resonates on some deep level.  It's catchy and I just can't stop listening to it. In fact I'm listening to it right now. In spite of the obvious dubstep influence, I really can't see this song being played at a club anytime soon.<br /><br />Unfortunately there's no nine-plus-minute epics like Infinity or Elysium.  There's no crunchy slower-tempo tunes like my favorite Lifetime in a Moment.
B00683JK9K|4.0|This product is good for thought processes though more than one puzzle should be included. I would recommend this to my friends
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|using on 3 devices and seamless sync -but Kindle Fire stopped sync and NO REPLY from Support in2 weeks. I finally deleted and reinstalled so it works now. good that I did not have any new notes made on KFire that had to be saved manually.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I love this game it destresses me if I ignore the timeclock ticking away in the upper left hand corner

B0087ZG7HK|5.0|Bought this as a present for my Nephew. He loved is as did I growing up when I first seen it.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I have enjoyed the Bond series ever since the first movie came out 50 years ago.<br />Along the way there have been a few bumps in the road (Moonraker, Quantum of Solace etc.) but all in all many more high notes than lows.<br />Following Quantum I had been concerned that Daniel Craig may have been a mistake ala Roger Moore, however with Skyfall I find that I am once again eargerly awaiting the next installment in 2 years. To paraphrase Shakespeare I believe the fault with Quantum lied not in its' Star but in itself.<br />Skyfall has everything that makes and has made Bond great so often for so long.<br />The story line and plot are top notch, among the best in the series. The underlying motive of revenge proving to be among the strongest and most viable of all. Javiar Bardam as Silva is a great villan.<br />Only one of the moments in the film didn't quite ring true for me. The London Underground scene with the falling train is a bit of a reach - the perfect timing of the train and it's fall in order to allow Bardams' escape. What if it had been 15 later or Bond had been 15 seconds earlier in the chase? In any event, a minor nit pick.<br />Also I wasn't a big fan of the casting of the new Q Ben Whishaw. Or perhaps more accurately with the writting of the character. Just a bit too smarmy for my taste. I suppose I am more old school here and lean to Desmond Llewelyn. Again, a minor annoyance and nit picking on my part.<br />The film is strong, Craig was solid and it was great to get away from the extreme close ups and rapid fire jump cuts that plagued the previous Criag outting. Direction of this film was far superior.<br />As an owner of all 24 Bond films (Yes, I include Never Say Never Again), I would put Skyfall in my top 7 and expect to watch it several more times in the years to come. Well done Bond.

B005LAIHSG|5.0|I love this movie.  The acting and the story is terrific.  The story is a bit different than Disney, but great.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this book.  It was one of the best thrillers I have read in a while.  Is the kind of book every woman should read.  It will touch home and will remind you of all the relationships you have had throughout your life.  It was very funny too.  I shared some bits and pieces with my husband.  LOL
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is a great app on phone or tablet! It's completely addictive and not packed with ads. Unfortunately, you'll get sucked in!
B0076DELIG|5.0|This author never fails to write a great book!  Keeps your attention from the beginning as usual.  Treat yourself to a good read.,
0307352153|4.0|If you think introverts can't make a difference, think again.  Susan Cain opens her book with an eye-and ear-opening example of the power of the introvert.  Rosa Parks, a quiet little lady in her 40's, started a revolution with one word: No.    But Cain doesn't stop there.  She goes on to list dozens of introverts that have changed history:  Lincoln, Einstein, Gates; the list goes on and on.    The book is a bit academic and, consequently, it was hard for me to digest at times.  Still, Cain's argument is valid and healthy for an extrovert like myself to consider.  Just as the subtitle so cleverly states, there is an undeniable power of quiet in a world that can't stop talking.

1616550414|5.0|My book came in perfect condition. Not a single dent or crease. I did order mine with other amazon items so the bundled my items, it could have helped.<br />As for the contents, it is a lot of skyward sword but I love everything that's included. It's a great purchase for any LOZ fan
B00000G3I2|5.0|I would love to have a weekend with old friends like this one, not for a funeral, but just for the good times and great memories.  The music is excellent and there is never a dull moment in the whole film!
B0083Z614S|5.0|I  read it with my fourth grade class. I love it. So did my class. My mom downloaded it on my kindle fire HD are after we finished.
B000SW16M6|5.0|A good boy's bad weekend when Mom and Dad are out of town!  Classic humor that takes me back to my youth!
B00BHMF578|5.0|From the beginning, and without playing Rambo or hurting anyone on a hand to hand fight, it depicts the struggle of Tony Mendez and the CIA to bring this people back to safety in a peaceful -yet risky- way. Reality trumps fiction, and this film is a great example.
B007LE2VDM|5.0|LOVE THIS MP3 MUSIC TRACK! After I purchased this I ended up getting a Windows 8 computer and was able to transfer file to new computer
B003F3NEBG|5.0|While this is the longest version of Pride and Prejudice it is also by far the best.  A pleasure to watch and the clarity and sound of the Blu-Ray is superb.  I highly recommend this version for any video collection.
1476712042|3.0|I don't really get what all the fuss was about.  It's a very young book.  Had I know it was about collge kids, for the entire book, I probably would have stayed away.<br /><br />On the bright side it is romantic & well written.<br /><br />If you are looking to remain on the 50 Shades of Grey high, this one won't keep you there.  Not steamy at all.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|This book was amazing and I can't wait to read the rest!! It's different from the show but that is what will keep my interest.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this game is really fun but now so much better withe the world tour. So far my favorite is Rome because of the police officer in his bunny costume and the egg collecting.
B00AHTYGRW|3.0|This ain't no GONE BABY GONE . Overrated but good film recalls a time when our Nation was managing it's decay a bit better . Love ya Ben and Co . Not best picture material . Not even in the top ten . Better than adequate to be sure . All . Out.....Benstarbuck
B000OJFV4C|5.0|I enjoyed The Tudors very much.  It was both fascinating and educational to watch the inner political workings of Henry VIII's court.
B004ZGI2KK|5.0|i received this product before the time i was suppose to and i was thrilled. I couldn't wait to get it so to get it when i did was exciting. I wish all the products i ordered had this service lol. Now i just have to find the time to watch it lol.
B0083EY9EI|5.0|Her songs are amazing. You can feel the passion and her love for God. I love how she was able to make her songs appealing enough to transfer into mainstream music. Every song is great and I can't wait to hear more from her.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This was easy to dowload on my Kindle, has nice animation/graphics, & is fun game to play. Fun for adults and kids.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|It was very difficult to find these batteries  in stores. Very easy and inexpensive  to purchase this way.<br />Pleasant experience.
0374214913|4.0|What a fun read for someone who grew up in San Francisco, knows the blocks involved and lives in Silicon Valley now!  Clever and very well written.  Looking forward to more from Robin Sloan.
B00000IOSU|5.0|I remember this CD from my early college days.  It was great listening to it again.  Brings back a lot of memories.
B007FZ7QAA|5.0|This CD is amazing. Although I'm in my 30s and his target audience is probably 25 and under, I just love Chris Brown and he continues to outdo himself.  The CD is really upbeat and great for working out, but there are a few slow songs as well.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|PREÇO MUITO BOM.<br />MATERIAL EXCELENTE. NAO EH O MELHOR QUE EXISTE A VENDA MAS ATENDE TODAS AS MINHAS NECESSIDADES.<br />EXCEPCIONAL CUSTO BENEFICIO.<br />OTIMA ESCOLHA.
B002BWP49C|5.0|Arrived on time in good packaging with no damage.  My daughter and I watch these together, we love the series.
B002WN35DC|5.0|Muy interesante es increible como la interpretacion de un libro puede cambiar segun la etapa de nuestras vidas en k sea leido
B001UV4XFG|5.0|Came on time.  No damage, well packaged.  Good movie, my daughter and  I like to watch the series.  Looking forward to release of final movie.
055380684X|5.0|The Talent Code presents insight into the psychology of learing and ability beliefs, goal setting, and performance enhancement in an easy to read and accessible manner. Coyle does an excellent job weaving the research into the narrative. A must read. Well done.
B005M2V2K8|5.0|I bought this for my seven year old daughter and it is very cute.  There are fancier beanie boos, but if you want a cute white kitten, then you'll love this one.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Love this app! It lets me know when my Kindle is 100% charged. The indicator on my kindle just shows it as fully charged and I'm never sure if it's fully charged or not. I also like that it lets you know how much time you have left to perform certain functions. I definitely recommend this app!
B008476HBM|1.0|I really didn't like this book because it was in the old times and I didn't understand it so yea :)
B00454U1NS|5.0|One of the best CD's. Love Pink! It has all her best songs. I have been listening to it everyday.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The best game in the world.I love it because I have horses.I also have a request to put a Haflinger in the game.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|Kelly Clarkson's voice is amazing! Love her and this CD was a great purchase because it has most the best ones plus a couple new ones I wanted.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|This is a fabulous collection of films covering the rise and fall of a powerful Mafia family.  The casting and recreation of events were very well done.  I bought this as a gift.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I enjoyed this movie very much. It was interesting and was well worth the time invested watching it. Good movie.
B000022TSY|4.0|This film, along with a few others, managed to capture that moment in history when a counter culture emerged during the 1960's and early 1970's.  Needless to say, it made many in the &#34;Establishment&#34; nervous.  The drug scene was a bit overblown but the long haired prejudice was all too real.
B00AFOS6P2|2.0|This latest release is pretty much devoid of interesting melodies and just too downbeat.  Has a spoken word feel to it.  I know the man is adored and is free to do whatever he wants, but I'm passing on this one.  It's just a matter of taste, that's all...nothing personal.  I think I'm going to turn on Mark Lanegan's latest  excellent release and listen to what Cave used to do quite well.  At least the tradition continues in another embodiment.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|THIS GAME IS VERY ADDICTIVE.  I HAVE IT ON BOTH MY KINDLE AND MY ANDROID PHONE.  I HAVE HOURS OF FUN WITH NO SIGNS BEING TIRED OF.  RETRIEVING NEW CHARACTERS IS THE BEST PART OF THE GAME.  I RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO ANYONE.  NEXT TO THE TEMPLE RUN SERIES, IT'S THE BEST APP ON ANY ANDROID.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|This game is good, but it should have a time limit to find objects. Needs to be a little more challenging. If you are looking for something to casually pass the time this is the game for you.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I have really enjoyed the hunger game series. It was a joy to read.. I can wait to see how the last two books will cross over to the big screen...
B000NTPDSW|5.0|This was a great gift at a super low price! The fact that it was Blu-ray made it even better.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|This item was a great purchase. I work over nights with plenty of time to kill. I have replayed all my portable system games more times than I can count and this monitor/carrying case has allowed me to bring in much more challenging games to while away the hours.
B0083Z614S|4.0|Simply put, this is one of the classics.  Burnett captures youth unlike many other authors and her stories are intriguing and easy to read/follow.  I tend to get bored with Austen-like writers, but I thoroughly enjoy Burnett and her story of Mary.
B004XQYBA2|2.0|too much of a pain. the settings are long - MUCH too long - and even after you get it set up play is awkward and confusing
B000063UR1|5.0|was very young when I first saw it back in the late 70s, the great mystery was how they moved the drones, and the songs of Joan Baez, beautiful, a great as Douglas Trumbull, will you ever see this happen on earth, that we go to? we are slowly destroying everything, there will be an ark to take him to the edge of space? enjoy it and will continue to do always, I hope you pass any Blu Ray you see, he deserves thanks.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Outstanding! Well written with so much imagination. Suzanne Collins has come up with such an original idea and written it down impeccably.
B0002KQNJU|5.0|A great classic, but apparently it is very difficult to pass Blu Ray, but still without elaborating the movie is fine, pass it to dvd is to give longer life, some scenes really move from whether to laugh or be scared , stop me is wonderful to have it in my collection prune,
B0018RWM9G|1.0|I was riding my fixed-gear bike into Cambridge, Massachusetts one day (that's what all of the hip kiddos do these days) and passed a bar. When I hit the set with my t-shirt that featured Banksy graffiti as a graphic, I expected to be treated as an established and true, genuine, and most importantly, edgy intellectual. This was simply not the case.<br />I plopped down into a stool. I was sitting next to a guy with a really weird mustache and this other guy who had a tattoo of an anchor on his neck. I knew at this point that I was in a \\"hip\\" bar.<br />The two men began discussing bands. I heard of strange artists such as The Decemberists, Jeff Mangum, and Chuck Berry. I decided to join in on the conversation.<br />\\"There's this really cool band called Coldplay. Pun intended. Anyway, you've probably never heard of them.\\"<br />The two men began laughing heartily and I was puzzled.<br />After trying to rebuild my shattered confidence, I name-dropped more obscure artists such as \\"Eminem\\" and \\"Elvis Presley\\".<br />I was promptly told by the bartender to leave because I did not have enough \\"indie cred\\" and I should \\"go read some experimental post-structuralist novels\\".<br />The title says it all. Don't go into Cambridge expecting this album to establish yourself as an intellectual.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surfers , from Amazon.com , is such a cool game . Is a deliciously , and amazingly addictive game . You can look forward to many many hrs. of fun entertainment from this title !!! Enjoy and have fun!!!!
B009G8GRX6|5.0|I love this CD from Muse and I really love buying music from amazon, its super easy, fast and affordable.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|The book was amazing good for middle schoolers and for 11 year olds plus I'm in fifth grade good that's it!!!!!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Love it. It just won't download Rome on kindle fire HD. Other than that it's great. Really good on kindle.
B005LAII1C|4.0|HEY it's SETH...if you don't understand that, then just RED BOX the thing, get some popcorn and put the kids to bed.  An adult language film, a few laughs,  awesome animation of a bear, but not anything that I would put in my list for a deserted island.
B00865P3AS|1.0|Only had 1 fairly good cut on it very sorry I bought the cd!  Group was on Fox &Friends played one song was good so purchased it very disappointed with cd only one good cut on it rest was just noise.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|Hey you must see MIB 1 and 2 first, then it's a great continuation.  Hope there will be a 4...just for fun and we need more of that in our lives.
B007A2O3FO|5.0|Love this movie. The acting was great as well as the beautiful scenery. It was well done. My type of movie.
B0086700CM|3.0|l didn't like it that much. It was fun when I had nothing else to do. I think temple run 1 and 2 were dumb.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|weird but addicting. I first saw this game by my friend. its impossible to get all the coins. (I think).
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|This documentary was very interesting to watch. Even if you don't love sushi it's still so interesting to understand how a chef can learn and how simple food is good.<br />It made me want to go to his restaurant!
B000002L3P|5.0|If you are a fan of Kenny Wayne Shepard's style, I am confident you will enjoy this album.  I think this guy's riffs are really powerful.
B009P25TQE|5.0|If you know spanish its one of the most beautiful music I have heard in a long time......<br />but if you don´t you will enjoy his voice...., look and music...<br /><br />The best ...  la raja increíblemente bueno !!!!
B009GQ57ES|5.0|this album is from the heart! Amazingly composed and the freshest artist ive witnessed in a while. If you dont like profanity it may not be for you, but if you can get over that, it is worth your time.
B00BESIKWM|1.0|I wish streaming video providers would stop using the Flash player.  This didn't play in IE, Firefox, or Chrome despite having the latest version of Flash installed.
B008MEM24S|5.0|this game is way better than where's my water. it has lasers that help you through the level whether its steam or water you can always find a way to collect all the ducks. I TOTALLY recommend this.
0788812408|5.0|perfect for my four year old shes too young for dvds (we have learned) she oves the movie, works great!
B000FC13Y0|4.0|This is one rare instance where the movie might have been better than the book--not by any fault of the book, but because the movie stayed true to the majority of the book and fleshed out portions that were a bit scant on paper. The book was solid, though Gaiman would often mention tantalizing tidbits of story with little explanation. The one-liners about the characters' adventures helped the book move along, but as a fan of longer novels and some high fantasy, I was disappointed that more of those storylines weren't explored.
B004EPYZUS|5.0|One of the better ones! It used to be that sequels were not worth watching...not any more! I think I like this better than the original!
1423140605|4.0|I had a fun time with this one. The plot was fairly predictable (as per usual, with the target audience being a bit younger), and the conflicts were more short-lived than I prefer, but the storyline was lively and clever, the characters seem to become ever more enjoyable, and the cliffhanger ending left me cursing the necessary gaps between book releases.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I really liked the Quality of the recordings.  The clarity of the images and the series were just what I was looking for
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Was a very well written book, I enjoyed every part of it! I especially loved the challenges Cozette had, she was a wonderful character.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game its amazing. Anyone would like it no matter who they are. Kids and adults will love this game.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I really liked the storyline.  It tells how we but labels and expectations on another person that are not really there. The main characters finally deal with what has held them away from a good relationship, but to do so they have to figure out what cause the fear in the first place and do something different. They had to own up to their own feelings and along the way they fell in love.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This makes it so easy to get to compared to going through all the other steps on the web. Just one button & your there
B005CKPQNE|5.0|This has to be the ultimate fall from grace story. The best program on cable tv, i'm going to miss it after this season ends.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|this vey relaxing game - enjoyable for any family member. play it all the time. have played this game before.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|you should get this!!!! there is constant fun! this is five stars because all the things you can do!<br />I love it a lot.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This is a good app, Use it daily to inter act with family & friends. Makes it so easy to get to facebook.
B000P0J09W|5.0|Always a great movie!! Now my grandchildren are watching it and say what a great movie!<br />Would recomend to anyone!
B00AYLTMMM|5.0|Helen Hunt was amazing! She is one beautiful woman in the nude as well. I applaud her courage and grace in her role. The man John Hawkes was an absolute delight as well as the polio victim. This being a true store as well only makes it that more appealing to everyone.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|I love this movie. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are great as agents K and J as usual. Josh Brolin is also very good as the younger agent K. It had some surprising twists that i didn't expect. I would recommend it to fans of the MIB series and anyone who wants to laugh.
0385536828|1.0|I do not like giving bad reviews -- I truly believe it takes a lot of risk, hard work and dedication to put anything down on paper.  However, I thoroughly did not enjoy this book.  I was disappointed after reading the great reviews.  I was excited at the beginning, feeling there was going to be some big secret and revelation at the end -- and kept going.  About halfway in, I debated putting the book down all together, but powered through in case I was mistaken.  I wasn't mistaken.  It just didn't have a lot of excitement, twists and turns.  The character development also seemed weak.  There was no depth, even the main character.  I know people have all sorts of personalities in this world, but the combination of Serena and British Intelligence was completely baffling.  She had an opportunity to really become something and instead all it seemed she was focused on was getting into a sexual relationship.  I just didn't get it.  Maybe that was the point -- a weak woman looking for only a physical relationship out of her life, making her a very glass half empty person.  And, her romance with Tom -- it just seemed so *not* involved.  They really didn't know anything about one another.  Again, probably the point... but everything just seemed to scratch the surface and stay there.  Then, it all just stopped at the end... thankfully.
B0000UJDLM|5.0|I love this movie! Number 5 has a lot of great lines. The other actors are great as well in their roles.
B0076XIS4O|4.0|If you've heard all the hype and are wavering on whether or not to get this, get it! Totally unique sound, one of the best of 2012!
B00A77II0U|5.0|This game kept me wanting more! I love the hidden pictures and the story. Once I started playing I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen to the characters. Awesome job hope that there are more like it to come.
B0066W1AZK|3.0|Nice app.  Easy to use.  I gave it three stars because 1) when you play against the computer and lose the match, it puts you into check, but not checkmate.  The only way I have found where it does put you in checkmate is when you tap the home key on the Kindle and quit the game.  Then when you return to the game, it tells you that the computer put you in checkmate and has won, which happens to me more often than I'd like :)  2) the game doesn't keep score on how many times each player has beaten the other.
B00122RG4S|5.0|Marc Bolan and T. Rex are timeless.  The music is a good today as it was when it was created forty plus years ago.  It is a very sad tragedy when an artist as talented as Marc Bolan has his life cut short.
B002ZG99CC|1.0|I can still remember my very favorable emotional response after all these years to the original Karate Kid! This poor remake does not light a candle to the original. I found this version of the Karate Kid to be sour, dour and at times, agonizingly contrived. I was also surprised that Jaden Smith often came across as a pouty rich kid not getting his way. Regardless if I had seen the original Karate Kid, or not, I still would have strongly disliked this new version because it lacks heart and believability!<br /><br />This is also a political film! China is portrayed as a wonderful country full of stunning beauty and regular people, like you and me. It felt like the screenplay was approved by a Public Relations firm hired by the Chinese government. Whether that actually happened, or not, China was portrayed in such a misleading way you would think there's hardly any difference between, say, Brooklyn, New York and Beijing, China! But there are REALLY BIG differences! Here is a succinct summary by a retired Chinese college professor on how incredibly different our two cultures are:<br /><br />\\"China is a one-party dictatorship. All the real power in China is firmly in the hands of nine men -- the members of the standing committee of the Politburo of the CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY (CCP). The People's Congress is just a rubber stamp of the Politburo of the CCP; the Government a mere front of the Party. The armed police force, the regular police force and the judicial system, as well as the mammoth mass media, are all under the tight control of the Party, which means the CCP leadership controls both the bodies and minds of the population. Even religions are under government control. Believers can only worship in government-sanctioned and supervised churches, temples and mosques. The Chinese internet police, composed of about 30,000 university graduates with degrees in computing sciences, monitor and intercept internet communication 24 hours, seven days a week.<br /><br />There is no freedom of thought, no freedom of speech. Dissenters are severely punished. The spokesperson of the CCP regime recently said at a news conference that there are no political dissenters in China, only \\"criminals\\". The last bastion of the CCP dictatorship is the mighty armed forces of China -- the People's Liberation Army, which pledges its absolute loyalty to the CCP, and declares its dual function of maintaining domestic stability as well as national defense.\\"<br /><br />If that's not bad enough, I'll also add: \\"Only ONE PERCENT of the China's 560 million city dwellers breath air considered safe by European Union standards according to a World Bank study. Air pollution is particularly bad in the rust belt areas of northeastern China. A study done by the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that the amount of airborne suspended particulates in northern China are almost 20 times what WHO considers a safe level.\\"<br /><br />These huge differences between our two cultures were only too happily glossed over by Hollywood in order to maximize their profits. I'm also sure the Chinese government would have pulled the plug on filming the Karate Kid in a heartbeat if they didn't like the screenplay!<br /><br />See: [[ASIN:B000OLROWC The Karate Kid]] and [[ASIN:0262083582 Clearing the Air: The Health and Economic Damages of Air Pollution in China]] and [[ASIN:0801473268 Capitalism without Democracy: The Private Sector in Contemporary China]]is no freedom of thought, no freedom of speech.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is so great I love how we go to different famous city's and tons of awesome charactors and boards and great graphics truly an amazing game
B00BHMETKC|3.0|I expected more. I have watched zero dark thirty and silver lining play book and I liked them better, my husband liked Argo the most
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I just started watching supernatural about two months ago and I'm already caught up to the current episode. Honestly I cant get enough of this show and love the relationship between Sam, Dean, and Cass.  Every episode is something different and eventhough it's the same storyline, it never gets old. This is my favorite show of all time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app does not get old. No need to purchase anything. You have missions to help you advance. Very addicting.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|AMAZING! the best game ive ever played in my life so yea BEST. gdgdgd dbdgfhc jhhf hfhfhfhf hfhfhf jdhfx fggh
B007712XAU|5.0|I purchased three seasons of Downton Abbey from Amazon and was very satisfied with the quality of the discs.  They offered many hours of entertainment.  The cast is talented and come across as real persons.  The story is set in England early in the nineteenth century.  You will enjoy viewing the props, costumes, the joys and sorrows of the characters.  Don't let a magnificient story pass you by.<br /><br />When will season four be ready?
0823003035|5.0|I strongly recommend this book to all who want to improve their figure drawing.  Not really for beginners unless you are very motivated.<br /><br />Emphasis on modern way of dealing with drawing.  Ryder is concerned with the whole drawing and teaches the &#34;envelope&#34; as a way of blocking the whole drawing on the page before dealing with the details.  He won't talk extensively about anatomy although it is understood to be important for repair points.  He is more concerned with relationships of points to each other in the body.  The scale will be right if the relationship of 2 points is right.  Lots of information about shading and form and beautiful drawings.  And a lots more about gesture.  Sorry, no shortcut, no gimmick.  I love it and look at it often.....I should say that I draw from the model twice a week and this book comes in handy.  I use it along with Bridgman books for anatomy and massing.<br />He describes his method as<br />1.  the block in<br />2.  The contour<br />3.  Drawing on the inside (that includes shading)
B00BHMF578|5.0|Loved it from start to finish.  Quite a twist on how the story was originally told.  Watch then watch the documentary Argo.
B00881VLCE|4.0|This is a great app for the puzzle lover only problem is sometimes you lose your puzzle but it come back in a few mins.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Better than I had anticipated. It had plenty of twists and kept me reading and  wanting more. It doesn't disappoint,
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I loved this movie so much that not only did I go out and buy the book for my library, but I had to have the DVD as well.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|FANTASTICO!  This album strays away from his usual operatic songs and concentrates more on popular love songs.  Highly recommended for hopeless romantics everywhere.
B0009XNUK0|3.0|This was an o.k. CD Some versions of songs have been shortened. Would have liked to have &#34;Lady in my life&#34;, and &#34;I wanna be where you are&#34; as some of the included selections.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I loved subway surfers as soon as I downloaded it I kept playing the game and I never stopped because it is the best game ever I just love it
030758836X|1.0|The characters are cartoonish and the plot details TVish.  It is not a clever thriller although it will surprise you once, about l/3 of the way through.  I should have read the reviews before my book club selected it.  At least I could have decided not to waste my $ buying it.  I couldn't give it even one star, but I felt I had to do it to post the review.  Sorry about that.
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|The movie was very good.  I was not aware that this happened in the 70's.  I was young and naive back then.
1400069807|5.0|The makers of processed foods have worked hard at dominating the American diet. To do this they use sugar, fat and salt.<br /><br />Sugar. We love sweets. We are hardwired for it. On the average, we Americans consume 22 teaspoons of sugar a day. Company researchers analyze taste responses to develop the mix of contents so we consumers will find the product tasty and attractive. We find out what \\"contains real fruit\\" really means for drinks and sodas. We're made aware of the sugar content of cereals.<br /><br />Fat. While there is a \\"bliss\\" point for sugar (add more sugar and the taste declines), there appears to be none for fat. And there is a synergy when fat and sugar are combined. Moss looks at the dairy industry, the fat in milk and cheese. He tours the meat industry, looking particularly at Oscar Mayer. I knew I didn't like hamburger but was shocked to find out the role of ammonia in its production.<br /><br />Salt. Salt is the essential ingredient for taste and preservation. We love our processed foods, foods that have a shelf life of weeks. That takes salt. But when one frozen dinner (man size) has more salt that the 1,500 mg we are to have for an entire day, then that is trouble.<br /><br />Moss' book contains lots of personal stories. While all the research he has done could result in a dry and boring book, I found it very readable.<br /><br />Moss spent three and half years prying into food industry's operations to understand the production and marketing of sugar, fat, and salt. Sales trumps consumer welfare. Don't expect any of the major companies to forsake their profits to make and market the most healthy food for us.<br /><br />We are hooked on inexpensive food. We are hooked on convenience foods. Eating healthier foods costs more and takes longer to prepare. Ultimately, the choice is ours. Moss sees his book as a tool, helping us keep up our defense when we walk the grocery aisles. Read it and be prepared.<br /><br />I received a complimentary egalleyof this book from the publisher for the purpose of this review.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|The characters are all so interesting and you're always left on the edge of your seat not knowing what, when or where something is going to happen.  Love, love, love this series!
B000FGGE7C|5.0|This is the best Sci-FI  movie i have seen with a female only lead actress...Aeonflux was patterned off this movie but was only decent and not as good..
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Epic & all engrossing.  Great cast and heart wrenching story.  Top of the line British actors & actresses-Maggie Smith makes it all worthwhile!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|The book is written on a high school level with engaging characters and a predictable plot until the surprise ending, which was the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 3.
B0086700CM|4.0|Temple run is really cool don't get me wrong but once you get all the badges and buy all the upgrades and people it gets boring.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The author maintained a high intellectual level, while drawing the reader into the story.  The characters were so interesting and engaging, it was easy to empathize with them in spite of the depressing subject of cancer.
6305537321|5.0|I have been wanting to see this movie for a long time now, and now since I've seen it multiple times i cant stop watching this movie. This is now one of my favorite films and i recommend everyone who is a Audrey Hepburn fan to see it. Perfect cast, perfect script, perfect character for the cast. Top notch!
B0021L8UPS|3.0|This is a good movie, not as scary as I had heard, but is ok. Not recommended for familty movie time.
B008KEQMDC|5.0|Love this movie and it is in excellent condition!!!!!! I recommend this movie to anyone that loves comedy and J. Lo.
B005LAIIRQ|5.0|Awesome movie. One of my favorite actors. Sad at the ending. Would highly recommend it to others. Have watched it a few times.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This is a pretty good sharpener.  I have used it to sharpen several of my knives and it works great.  Puts a nice edge on my rough use knifes and machetes.  Purchased an extra for my brothers b-day.
B005LAIGRS|5.0|Great movie. really enjoyed it and am glad we have added it to  our collection. Highly recommend. Have loaned it to several othjers and they also enjoyed the movie.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Got this for my wife along with a new Nikon dslr camera.  Thing works great.  Has solid zippers.  She has been using it for over a year and has had zero problems with it.  It holds the camera, 2 lenses, an extra smaller camera and a bunch of other smaller accessories, along with instruction books for all the stuff.  She has used it on several camping and hiking trips and it has never let us down.  Solid backpack for the money you can't beat it.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|This cd is fun to listen to, sing along with and dance to.  I enjoy all songs on the CD though my least favorite is probably Gorilla -- because, well, really?  Sometimes I just think class has gone out the window.  But having said that, I love most of the other tracks and love singing along to it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Easy to learn yet challenging.  Great game to pick up and play for a few minutes or a few hours.  Tons of characters to earn or buy and the new updates keep it interesting.  But where oh where is the Miami update???
B0063GORYU|5.0|This Spider solitare game is one of the best version's I've played. It's not two hard and thankfully not too easy so as to present a challenge adding to the fun. I love it!
0307346617|3.0|I love all things zombie and was excited to read this book before the movie comes out.  I have Max Brooks' guide to the zombie apocalypse which was entertaining but I did not read it cover to cover.  While I like the concept, I had a hard time adjusting to the writing style.  The book is a compilation of survivor interviews which stretch from the start of the outbreak to the &#34;resolution&#34;.  Each section is only a few pages long which is not enough time to develop a character or get the reader interested.  By the time I started getting into a story, it was over.  In addition, there are no connections between the characters which I think would have helped bring everything together.  There are also large sections of the book which deal with military ops.  The authors goes into details about weapon systems and tactics which personally I do not find that interesting.  I am curious as to how they will adapt the book to the big screen given the lack of central characters.  It was a quick read, but you won't be missing anything by skipping this one.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|i got this just to try it out. And it has turned out to be my favorite game on my fire. I really hope they build more on it.
B007JMW46U|5.0|This was the first hit of a search result for Sherlock Holmes literature as I had just finished indulging in the hit BBC series of the same name.<br /><br />Fans of Mr. Monk or similar detective stories will find this fascinating, as well.<br /><br />The stories are a few pages long each with a similar approach to each story; Sherlock is bored, Sherlock finds a crime, Sherlock investigates, and the resolution falls into his hands, sometimes literally.

B008ASGP3U|4.0|The story moves and you are drawn with it, reading, trying to understand, trying to unwrap the clues. Good read
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|This movie was one of the worst I have ever seen.  I had trouble focusing on the movie.  Joaquin Phoenix was so skinny, scrawny, and crazy looking.  He reminded me of when he did that rap song and dropped out of Hollywood for a while.  Although that was not the bad part.  I just didn't get his character!  I love Amy Adams, but  I barely heard her say a word.  Her part was playing the demure, obedient, mostly quiet wife.  I really tried to watch it, but mostly I went about my business around the house while it played.  It could NOT keep my interest.  I ended up fast forwarding through the last half hour hoping to find a shred of interest.  Didn't this movie win some Golden Globes???  Philip Seymour Hoffman is always great.  Was this movie a play on Scientology???  After reading some of the other reviews, I may try to watch it again before my 48 hours expires.  I do, however, wish I had not wasted my money on this.  I wondered why this movie never made the rounds in any theater in my area.  I guess I know now.

B000NY12LO|5.0|I would not recommend this to just anyone, because you HAVE to know that Jodi Picoult will break your heart. She does so here. I can't count the number of times I wanted to leap into the book and help the bullied boy who will become a school shooter, or shake the girl who was once his friend (or the parents, who initially separated them). I did not see the twist coming. As with most Picoult, it doesn't make things any happier. And yet--WOW.  The story is told in alternating points of view and timelines, between the shooting and its aftermath, and the histories that would eventually lead to the shooting. I learned all kinds of interesting information from her great research as well, such as how once the shooter goes into a particular mindset, he can no longer differentiate between friend and foe, which goes a long way to keep the reader from simply cheering the deaths of some of the worst bullies. It's a complex issue, and its complexity is shown from the points of view of parents, friends, the shooter, his lawyer, and the police officer... but not, unless I'm misremembering, the shooting victims. Brava Picoult.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This was a hard book to put down.  The twist and  turns it kept taking kept you involved to the end.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love this show, I heard a lot of discussion about it, watched an episode and was hooked.  I highly recommend it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome. It's totally fun. My son is 3 years old. He's watched me play this game so much he's learned how to play. This game is good for young children and older people.
B0002KZAKS|5.0|Its nice mic, its feels solid. It comes in a plastic case and a mic clip included, which was nice. I bought this mic because I wanted a cheap mic to carry with me to record vocals for song demos that I make for a songwriting class. The sound quality of the demos is not graded, therefore it is not an issue, but I would not recommend the use this mic for any serious recording.
B00321GTJU|5.0|Love the photography and it always amazes me when they capture something unusual on film.  I am blown away by God's creation and these videos really put Him on display and give Him glory.  His handiwork is incredible.<br /><br />Take a look and stand in awe of the creation and the Creator.  Just a remarkable video series.  I have the greatest respect for the film crew on these adventures.  They are truly amazing.  Good work.<br /><br />I can't agree with the evolutionary perspective on this one but for the most part I loved every minute of this series.  Just stating the above in case you are a bible-believing Christian so that you are aware of the perspective before you buy.  This won't bother everyone but if you have a biblical worldview (one that is solely according to scripture) then you will want to watch this with your children so that you can re-explain some of the content.<br /><br />I purchased the online streaming and we have loved watching it on our ipad.  We are studying geography right now in Classical Conversations and this has been a good supplement to some of the science work that we are studying.

B008RA3X5E|5.0|This alarm does everything that the description says it does, and more than everything I need it to do. This is a great little app for my Kindle Fire HD, especially because I need to set multiple alarms. I can get caught up in the day and my bible studies, and have forgotten until the last minute an appt., or my daughter coming home. I can also keep my Kindle Fire HD open with the clock display, so I am not straining my eyes trying to see the teeny tiny clock display on my cable box a mile away across the room (that's what it seems like sometimes, anywayz). I love the feature that allows you to wake up to a particular alarm, or to one of your favorite tunes. Personally, I start my day with Fred Hammond's Wait On The Lord. A great way to begin my day with a reminder of who my daily blessings come from. Well worth the time to download it and hook it up the way you want, and more than worth the few cents that it  costs.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|It was a terrific book, well written and surprise ending.  I am fortunate to get to meet the author in Sharon, MA in April.  Can't wait! He's from Boston.
B00908DDZM|3.0|I picked up this album, well I downloaded it, after seeing how much praise it was getting from seemingly everyone. On the first listen I was fascinated by how honest Macklemore was in his lyrics. He talked about his personal struggles, gay rights, the (corrupt) music industry, materialism, even shopping at used clothes stores.<br /><br />Varied subject matter, pretty fun beats (I didn't mention that yet did I), so why only 3 stars, sir?<br /><br />Well I think where this album falters is how it gets so drawn into being 'conscious rap' or saying important things that it takes away from the replayability and overall fun of it. Whats being said comes across similar to something inspiration that you might read about in the newspaper. The stories are intriguing but it's not something that's very enjoyable or something you would want to relive over and over. It is simply informative. That's how I feel about this album. Another thing is Macklemore's flow gets a little tired half way through the album. I would describe his rap style/voice like that of a person speaking to a shrink, from those cliche long black chairs that are associated with a psychologist and his patient, telling of his short comings and concerns. Only difference is he rhymes while doing so. It's truly refreshing when he seems excited to be rapping for food like he does on Thrift Shop, Jimmy Iovine and Wing$ (I like the subtle dollar sign in the songs title that talks about materialism). The aforementioned songs are also my favorite songs on the album. I don't think it's by chance that these also seem to be the songs he's most enthused about.<br /><br />So do I recommend it? I have to say, yeah I do. Despite the issues that I have with it, this record is still pretty solid. Just know that if you're a huge rap head like me, you might not enjoy it as much a casual fan of the genre would.<br /><br />On a completely different note, it's pretty cool that Macklemore and I share the same name even if that is only his stage name. Good pick, Macklemore, even if you do spell it wrong.his stage name. Good pick, Macklemore, even if you do spell it wrong.

B007REV4YI|5.0|I think Daniel Craig is the perfect choice for Bond!  Casino Royale was awesome, Quantum of Solace was good....but Skyfall was INCREDIBLE!!  Everything from the movie itself, the acting, the video and audio, it was superlative!  Can't wait to see how they top this one!  I realize superlative is quite a word but I think it applies even if I haven't seen any earlier Bond films!

B005LAII80|4.0|Dredd is another comic book film that had graced theaters in 2012. It focuses on the character Judge Dredd in a not too distant future where Judges replace a common legal system and serve as judge, jury and executioner.<br /><br />After Judge Dredd and his rookie partner get cornered in a massive apartment high rise amidst a violent gang, you can bet there's no shortage of firepower in this film. It's a blast, no pun intended. The story keeps you focused as the judges constantly face a new threat around every corner.<br /><br />I am not a big fan of 3D but this movie utilized some of the best 3D I had ever seen outside of a theme park ride. It was this movie that made me go out and buy a 3D television, no joke.<br /><br />If you want a good action film with plenty of adrenaline, look no further. The movie looks outstanding on Blu-ray and thrives in surround sound. A definite buy!

014241493X|5.0|Paper Towns was a great read and covered a number of mature themes with compassion and humor.  Another YA book for young adults and older ones.<br /><br />When's the last time you got bogged down in the middle of a book and figured you'd skip a bit and just read the ending?<br />Just so you can say you've read it?<br />OK - now when's the last time you did that and then picked the book up again the following evening to see what you might have missed?<br /><br />Well  - it was a first for me, too.  Stick with it.<br /><br />Part 1 is perhaps a little sophomoric but certainly an entertaining quick read.<br />Part 2 starts to drag a little.<br />Part 3 is insightful and moving. And it nicely pulls Parts 1 and 2 together.<br /><br />I am a 53 year old attorney, not exactly a YA.<br />I have a daughter that reads these books and I get glimpses into her world as I read what she reads and what she writes.<br /><br />What I particularly enjoyed about Paper Towns is that the main characters are believable and even when they do incredibly stupid and irresponsible things, you seem to like them and to care about them.  They are often confused, immature, thoughtless and goofy, but they are not mean spirited or petty.  In short, they are - for the most part - genuinely likeable.<br /><br />The parents are all clueless dolts - but that's intentional - no sense in developing their characters.<br /><br />I'm rereading Crime & Punishment at the moment since it was a book that I read and reread when I was in high school - and I'm trying to remember why.<br /><br />Wouldn't it be interesting if teachers would assign books like this - the classroom discussion would be thought provoking and totally unpredictable.  You'd need to be a pretty secure teacher to handle it.

B000N6TX1I|5.0|Intelligent. Action-packed. Beautifully shot, written, acted, and directed. One of the best films ever made in the passed decade. In this man's opinion, on the level of mastery of a modern day Citizen Kane. If you haven't seen it, see it. If you don't own it, buy it. If you don't buy it, then you won't be ready if this actually happens.

B00A81NFAS|5.0|When you want to watch a movie again the moment its over, that's something special. Have no second thoughts here, my friends, this is the movie you're expecting. If you're interested in movies with intelligent, witty dialogue with performances that exceed even YOUR incredibly high expectations, Silver Linings Playbook is the I Ching of 2012. Director/writer David O. Russel showed us with The Fighter and now he shows us with this film that he can take you to the lowest aspects of a human's personality in a very real way and still have you care and even identify with what you're seeing on screen. In a world where most films you see nowadays struggle to hold your attention with fast paced editing and over the top CG special effects, Russel manages to tell a simple narrative about a guy coming home from a mental hospital and somehow make it the most entertaining things you'll see this year. By giving it a multitude of depth and subtext to its characters, Russel creates a portrait of a family trying to deal with their clinically deemed crazy family member while also refusing to acknowledge the little bit of crazy inherent in each and every one of us. Toss in Jennifer Lawrence in the best performance of her early career for good measure and you have a recipe for the perfect blend of deliciously delivered drama.  If you love character based stories with lots of honest humor and a huge heaping dose of humanity's best and worst, by all means, buy this movie. You'd be crazy not to.

B00A3K2PZA|5.0|If there is a theme to William Friedkin's Killer Joe, I believe it is stated by ol' Joe himself in Latin: The buyer should beware. That is essentially how I feel about you considering this movie. Not because its bad, far from it, but if you're looking for that easy going Matthew McConaughey from all his romantic comedies or you were looking for a great movie to watch with the kids tonight, you may want to consider buying Sahara instead. Now if you're looking for a sick, despicabley good time with a family that pushes the term 'dysfunctional' to its breaking point, this may be right up your alley. This is McConaughey in what might be his greatest role, hands down. At a time when he seemed to be becoming a one trick pony who's no-shirt-antics were quickly becoming old and one note, the character of Killer Joe Cooper is a dark, meticulous and downright menacing figure that you can't take your eyes off of (no matter how much you may want to). He takes it to a place that is so bizarre by the end, its almost not human. Conversely, there is humor in the movie, albeit the darkest of dark humor you can get, from the foul-mouthed, somewhat dim-witted Smith family. Emile Hirsch kicks ass as a guy in way over his head. Its a real shame that he hasn't had enough praise for some of his performances like this and Into The Wild, which he so greatly deserves. Most of the pure comedic moments come from Thomas Hayden Church as the father. Gina Gershon gives a surprising performance from the moment she enters the film (and the first inclination that this movie is clearly rated NC-17). Lastly, Juno Temple squares out the cast of brilliantly acted characters as Dottie, the jail-bait sister who is surprisingly lucid for a girl so clearly not all there. So if you're looking for something dark, twisted, funny at points and horrifying in countless others, or if you're looking for a quick way to wean yourself off fried chicken for a while (trust me here), you may want to think about picking this flick up tonight. Its Killer...Joe.

The playing of the film with the comments of the designer, the restorer and Marni Nixon (Audrey Hepburn's singing voice) was illuminating. If you liked the play you'll love this version.
B007FROH4G|5.0|This book certainly makes you think about what might lie ahead of us as we are all getting older, no way of escaping that.
0316056871|4.0|I just finished reading Bossypants to find on page 290 (the page before Amy Poehler's home address) several glowing reviews for the audiobook version. I haven't actually listened to it, but why would I read the book when I could have just listened to Tina Fey talk at me for five hours?

B00AREIAI8|5.0|Only about an hour into the game but so far I find it very fun and easy to use. It's free totally worth trying out
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers in Italy, For Easter.<br />I'd rated 5 out of 5<br />Topical great games for Kiloo and Sybo Games!

B00AU15HPC|5.0|Justin with more of his wonderful music and vocals.  Unlike many of his previous releases that took me a couple of listens to really enjoy the music with Spirits of the Western Sky made me immediately fall in love with the music...Thank you so much Justin for continuing with your fantastic style of music and lyrics!  Some have said not much new here but that doesn't matter it's just wonderful music to enjoy and listen. The fact that the songs are new and different is more than enough for me. This is the music that makes Justin what he is and does best.  I wish Justin (and The Moody Blues) would receive more credit for their contribution to the music world. Each track is a delight with more than a handful are now my favorites.  Lazy Afternoon and In Your Blue Eye's are great. Too bad we had to wait 17 years for a new release but well worth it. Nice Nashville influence also. Not too crazy about the remix but overall a great effort! Please don't make us wait so long next time!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|You will not regret the your decision to read this book. One of the best books I have read in a very long time.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I lo e this game, especially the detective's costume.  I could play this all day daywithout getting bored.  Two thumbs up! =D
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think subway surfers is great, there are a lot of ads though. I play it all the time. I can't wait to keep playing.
034580404X|5.0|These books are not really erotica.  In fact, all of the sex scenes are really the same.  I found myself skipping over them.  What got me, and what made it impossible for me to put down these books, was the compelling love story.  This is a tale of a rich young man who has it all, but due to his traumatic past, he believes that he is incapable of loving someone and unworthy of love.  He uses BDSM as a way of controlling his surroundings and it is his only way of connecting with others.  Then he meets Ana.  She is innocent and beautiful, and he is drawn to her.  he doesn't believe that he has anything to offer her, but he can't stay away from her.  She is shy and unsure of herself.  She is shocked by his lifestyle, yet she is drawn to him as well.  As we read the books, we get to see their love grow, and we get to see Christian heal.  It is a beautify love story that made me laugh and made me cry.  True, I could have done without the sex scenes, and they were really repetitive.  But sex was the only way Christian really knew how to express his feelings until Ana came along and showed him that there was more.  The emails between these characters was my favorite part of the book.  They are cute and witty, and made me laugh.  This is an addictive love story with great character development.  I have read this series three times in the past year, and it is always heartwarming.  However, I will say, that the writing is a bit repetitive and there are a lot of sex scenes.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Totally addictive game!! I love it! Cannot figure out how to download update to Rome on my kindle though....?? Any suggestions?
0061124265|4.0|Unfortunately, I won't have time to read this until the summer but I'm so glad I got this book. I loved the Alchemist. I'm looking forward to reading this.<br />Arrived on time and in excellent condition.

B0034DGPEU|3.0|I can't really say why this book didn't resonate with me. It seemed to be well researched and interesting that it gave a different voice to the slavery issue. However, I found the characters flat and their situations predictable.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a very fun game. I play it all the time. I like how you can get different countries.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|It's a good movie, but lacks all the surprising special effects of James Bond movies of the past. No ejector seats or exploding cigars.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Very realistic, well acted, and entertaining.  Although good for entertainment, little disappointed by the exaggerated ending.  There would have been enough suspense without the Revolutionary Guards trying to chase the plane.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|lots of fun! Slow winning coins. Like the prizefighter feature and the puzzle feature. Reccomend if you like this kind of game!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|With out a file explorer app of some kind, it's nearly impossible to find your files in the Kindle universe.  This app does an admirable job for just the right price.

B0002VFXFE|5.0|What more is there to say?  This is one of the best thermal compounds out there for installing a new heat sinks, fans, etc.  The applicator is very easy to use, and the product came with a very competitive price tag.  Just remember that a little dab goes a long way.  It's a small syringe, but unless you build computers for a living, you'll have more than enough to share!
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I thought this was the same app that my cousin has, but it's not. Hers actually shows raindrops falling in the background; not beautiful pictures of it. But it is a great app with information at a glance to help plan your day or your outfit.
B004IE9REE|4.0|I don't always agree with the reviews contained in this book -- and there are some puzzling omissions from the list -- but there's no denying Turin's Guide is a great place to start exploring perfumes.  The introductory chapters will give you a solid basic introduction to perfumery, both men's and women's, along with the history of fragrance, but this isn't a book about hows and wherefores.  The heart and soul are the reviews themselves.  They are witty, often biting, sometimes effusive, but always evocative.  Reading this book is the next best thing to taking a world tour of all the major fragrance houses.
B00821OX98|4.0|Am a sci fi fan. Intrigueing concept. I have enjoyed other productions more. Good to pass time while waiting for other activities.
B008XG1X18|3.0|App works fine for looking but you can't browse and Pin.  Nine more words required but there's nothing else to add.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|This game is great for all ages even adults. I for one love it and I can't stop playing It. If I could rate it 10 stars I so would!  :) &lt;3
B0083ZRAJS|3.0|Not the Wizard of Oz that I grew up with but still a really good story. I haven't finished it yet but so far it's good.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I loved the game. It got me addicted for so long! But that was until to play the full game I had to give money! The funness has now gone lost!!
B00991TCOG|5.0|I don't listen to a lot of electronica. It has to be a real standout since it can easily become redundant.<br />I do a lot of music shopping based on the sample snippets I get on Amazon or what catches my ear when I'm out.<br />I ran across this album while sampling Amazon offerings but put off buying until I found it at my local Bull Moose Music store.<br />  Get to the point dink!<br /><br />I love it. The mash-up of neo-classical violin with a definite celtic bent and electronica makes for a brilliant listening experience. There's enough variation so the album never sinks into the mediocrity that a lot of current and past pop pablum dribbles into. You'll find more than a couple of tunes, here, to rotate into your next party mix.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. Finding all the clues and traveling through the seasons were fun. The game had just the right amount  of difficulty to keep you guessing and wanting to keep on looking for more. If you enjoy these type of games you will like this one.
B009KHDT0C|1.0|I really disliked this movie.  I thought it was supposed to be a spoof of the original show.  It wasn't funny.  It wasn't scary.  It just totally felt like it missed the mark on everything.  I definitely wasn't impressed.

B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|This was a scary and awesome movie.  We bought it to have scary night at our house.  Trust me ... we were scared by the end of this and The Last Exorcist (which wasn't as good as this movie).
0553801473|2.0|Martin is a fantastic writer. His first two books in the series were actually quite good, compelling me to continue reading.<br /><br />However both book 4 and book 5 have killed off good characters and introduced poor, unsympathetic characters. Also, the plot does is not appear to be going anywhere. The third one was pretty marginal. This one has finally made me decide to not purchase another. It's almost as if he's trying his best to keep the series going without offering his readers any real substance. Too bad, the series started out so strong and very entertaining.
B005OZE9SA|4.0|I'll start off by saying that I've had this interface for about 6 months now and it is still going strong. I think that anyone, especially the beginner, looking for an interface should definitely consider this unit. Not only does it provide 2 channels, but it also has monitor out and headphone out. This could also be a decent sound card for those who are fed up with integrated audio.<br /><br />However, I have a few gripes with the 2i2. The headphone knob feels a little flimsy and has a bit of give if you push on it. This is purely the \\"feel\\" and does not really hinder performance. But it makes the unit feel cheap, at the controls. IMO, the knobs and switches can feel a bit unsatisfying when the rest of the unit is built so strongly. Moving on, while on the topic of knobs, the level knobs for both channels could also use indicators, but once again, aesthetics.<br /><br />Why 4 stars?<br /><br />The problem must of started happening today because I never noticed it before. Or it could be just that, maybe I never noticed it. Anyways, shortly after I engaged the 48v phantom power, the interface started making a barely audible high pitched hissing. Once again, this is barely audible and should not be a problem if your microphone is far enough away. I hope that this issue does not show up in all of the Scarlett 2i2 interfaces. I would think that an interface should produce no noise as it in key in the recording process for many home studios. Hopefully, just my unit is defective and it isn't something that is common among the 2i2's.<br /><br />Another thing to note is that while Direct Monitoring is a feature on this unit, the volume levels coming from the direct monitoring is very low and makes it less practical to use. In other words, I am saying that you would have to essentially turn up the gain and record \\"hotter\\" and get closer to clipping to effectively hear yourself clearly though the direct monitor. Nevertheless, it is a feature that can be utilized though.<br /><br />So in the end, 4/5 stars! The packaging that the interface came in was very minimalistic, but yet appealing, thumbs up for that. I really like the build quality of the interface and Focusrite makes it very easy to record audio with this unit. The only issue that I would consider a big problem is the hissing from the phantom power being engaged. Overall, great entry level interface/sound card!<br /><br />Update:<br />My interface is still going strong and has no noticeable issues so far. Focusrite definitely knows how to make a sturdy interface. I will report back if anything happens.aging that the interface came in was very minimalistic, but yet appealing, thumbs up for that.

B0090CVJZ4|5.0|If you are looking to add banana plugs to bare speaker wire so that your speakers can be easily plugged/unplugged, look no further. This product includes twelve pairs of banana plugs that arrived in perfect, frustration-free packaging. What more can you ask for?<br /><br />I think some others have complained about the lack of instructions. That's a legitimate complaint -- there are no instructions. But if you're ordering these plugs, you probably have some idea what to do. Simply: (1) Unscrew the plug so that your bare speaker wire can pass through the hole; (2) Insert the speaker wire; (3) Tighten the plug so that it pinches the bare speaker wire; (4) Insert the banana plug into the back of your speaker or receiver.<br /><br />Banana plugs make it really easy to connect and disconnect speaker wire from components and speakers. No more tightening and unscrewing binding posts. Additionally, since these plugs have red and black bands on them, you can easily identify the positive and negative wires running between components. This makes it unnecessary to label the wires yourself (something I've been doing for years). The labeling is easier to see and use.<br /><br />Before ordering these plugs, make sure that your speakers/components can accept a banana plug (typically a hole on the back of the binding post where the plug inserts). Additionally, you will need a pair for each end of the connection. Thus, if you have two speakers connected to an amplifier or receiver (i.e. a typical stereo setup), you will need four sets of plugs, provided that both ends of the connection accept them (two sets for each speaker and two sets for the receiver/amplifier). That means that a typical 5.1 home theater system will require 10 sets of plugs and a 7.1 system will require 14 sets (the subwoofer typically attaches with a different cable). If you have additional components (e.g. a passive crossover unit), you will need additional plugs. Hence, this product will have you covered up to a 5.1 system, but you will need more connectors for additional speakers.5.1 system, but you will need more connectors for additional speakers.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this app is AWESOME! I love it very very very very very very very very very very much!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Excellent book, it might be branded as young adult sci-fi but I think that's just because its main characters are kids, it's written without too many sophisticated \\"big words\\" and can be read and enjoyed as a simple story by a 13 year old as though there's no deeper meaning to Orson S. Card's writing.<br /><br />Still I think there ARE some deeper layers of meaning to it if a reader cares to look for them, and that all the allusions to psychology as well as the reference to real world philosophers and international treaties will indulge the more cultured readers.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|Great basic player. Simple to use, intuitive UI. The only thing missing is a way to share on a social networking site.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the game and the new updates every few weeks are great. New scenery, characters, and missions make it new and fun. I only wish the multiplier would go up a little higher.
B0053O89WY|5.0|The 5th season of BIG BANG is just as funny as all previous seasons.  IMHO.  I've got them all on DVD.  Thankfully, this year the picture quality on DVD is just as sharp as previous seasons.  Many other TV on DVD shows are cutting back on the video quality (to make Blu-Ray look even better by comparison?).  On Twitter they might advise that the cure for depression is a bowl of ice cream and an orgasm.  But we're on Amazon.  Pop in Season 5 of BIG BANG THEORY (or actually, any season of BANG), watch a few episodes, and you'll be fine.  @hg47

B00AREIAI8|4.0|Really fun. The only downfall is it does not always load. No load=No play. Other than that, it's super fun!
B00B49GSKC|4.0|I can't say that was all that excited to see this prequel of sorts to the great \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy. I had this pang in my gut fearing this would be something on the order of George Lucas restarting the \\"Star Wars\\" trilogy with the silly \\"Phantom Menace\\" in 1999. Fear assuaged for the most part.<br /><br />This preamble begins when Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm) decides to write the story of how he originally took possession of the infamous ring. His narration leads us back to his younger self (excellent Martin Freeman) who is inexplicably recruited by the wizard Gandalf (returning Ian McKellen). Their story is relatively simple. They are to help the 13 survivors of the dwarf kingdom, now led by Thorin (Richard Armitage) in recapturing their mountain home held by a vicious dragon.<br /><br />The movie is about their journey getting there. Naturally there are enemies in their way, real and imagined. Not the least of which is an army of orcs and their giant wolf-like steeds. Scary to look at, the orcs are easily picked off inside their secluded compound by the dwarfs. I couldn't figure that one out. The orcs also have the ability to find dwarfs using a keen sense of smell...well except when they climb up in a tree. Another head-scratcher.<br /><br />Director, writer and head honcho of all things Tolkien, Jackson has the look down pat. Although I must admit, some of the backdrops looked a little too CGI. Perhaps the film had slowed to a point where I was just a bit too focused elsewhere. The film does seem to ponder at times. There is one scene when Bilbo falls down a jagged crevice in the orcs mountainous home (unscathed by the way) and first meets Gollum (the great Andy Serkis).<br /><br />Sensing everyone has been waiting for Gollum to appear, Jackson lingers forever in this confrontation. Bilbo and Gollum go through several rounds of verbal riddles, slowing everything down. Was the 2 hour and 46 minute running time really necessary? I don't think so. Several characters from the \\"Rings\\" make brief appearances including Hugo Weaving as Elrond, Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, Christopher Lee as Saruman and Elijah Wood as Frodo. \\"The Hobbit\\" will likely please many and irate others. I'm reasonably satisfied but hope for better things to follow.<br /><br />I originally watched this movie on an IMAX screen in 3D so didn't see the controversial faster speed film shown in standard theaters. As is usually the case the IMAX print looks great. The 3D isn't over done and has a natural look with plenty of depth.<br /><br />The Blu ray has 2D or 3D options and a variety of packaging.  All come with 1080p resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The visuals are excellent especially the 2D version.  The audio likewise is first rate.  The English language version has a great DTS-HD Master audio 7.1 option.

0316212261|5.0|At first I was a little taken aback when starting to read it, as it was very different then expected and I was first unsure wether I liked it or not. I think you either think it's stupid or you fall for it's easy charm. But I found it after the first chapter  to be entertaining, easy and  fun to read. Jusr finished the last of the series and can easily recommend it.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This game is fun and addicting.  The further you get into the game the more challenging it gets.  Really fun game.

B009Q6ADG0|5.0|There have been many great songs to come out of the \\"007\\" canon over 50 years...and this one tops<br />them all, hands down. Truly deserving of the Oscar for great songwriting, and Adele's magnificent voice!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I have bought ALL of the Downton Abbey DVDs on Amazon.com -- less expensive and a MUST to have for the Downton fans!  My only comment, not to give away too much, is that they'd better quit killing off characters on this show or we won't have much to watch in the future!!!
B007L3BMGA|2.0|My Grandmother and Mum got me reading this book with their rave reviews of it. i found it slow moving, the sex was boring after a while too, all it seemed to do was get in the way of the thin story line and bulk up the book. The main character - Ana seems to be one of those clueless mills and boon female characters. She doesnt seem to be able to work things out quickly (Christian is on the phone using words like 24/7 and extra men. I worked out he was getting extra security...Ana didnt for another chapter!) and the author treats the readers in the same fashion sometimes stating the obvious.<br />if you like mills and boon books you'll love this. if you like books with an exciting story line, strong female characters then this might not be the book for you.

B001R0XNSI|4.0|The size is between sd1 and sd2.  You can carry on both button sides of your shirt for self defense against choking and grapping.  one side is hidden, and the other side for easy access.  This pen is HUGE.<br /><br />Due to it's unbreakable nature, you can write with it in a quiet library and be ready for emergency.  Of course, you can use bic, pencils and etc.  But this thing is unbreakable.<br /><br />I purchased the white one.  A simple scrapping would remove the shark symbols or whatever.<br /><br />Treating it as a kubotan without the key ring!
B003HFFVEA|5.0|I'm still new to the Chemical Brothers, but it was love at first listen to this band [It's Doesn't Matter was the first song of theirs I heard].  After buying Exit Planet Dust and Dig Your Own Hole used, I found reviews of the rest of their albums.  Seeing Surrender and this album also among the top albums, I bought these.<br /><br />Two standout tracks are &#34;Escape Velocity&#34;, a 12-minute dance trip and &#34;Swoon&#34;.  Overall, this is my favourite after Surrender, about tied with Exit Planet Dust.  This album is considerably more chill than the other three of their albums I own, but that is why it stands out so much.  I'd give just the album itself a high 4.  The DVD is what pushes this album to an easy 5.  Included are a 50 minute continuous music video for the whole album and a 20 minute making-of documentary.

B004XWLN20|5.0|I never watched it when it was on regular TV but when it went to TNT I recorded it everyday and watched it after work. I got sick of fast forwarding through the commercials so I bought it for myself. I have since finished watching the entire series. I wish it could of went on and perhaps Lois and Clark could of had a son and father and son adventures couild of continued.
B007DIQC90|5.0|Another great CD purchased on Amazon.  The lead singer has such a unique voice, the whole CD is fresh and different.
B004M5HUXE|1.0|Tedious, boring, pompous, distasteful characters, and crude ... I only recommend this if you are having troubles getting to sleep, because this classic garbage works better than a pill.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|Have several favorite songs on this CD.  Phillip Phillips has a super voice and is very up and coming in my opinion.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Love it. Be sure to hit the &quot;save&quot; button when adding an alarm time. Other than that, I love this app. It has replaced my old clock.

B001LF3YQK|5.0|Oooohhh, I love this case. Holds a good many wipes, easy to find in your diaper bag but not too bulky, durable, simple to access the wipes. Overall well-designed at a nice price. I'll probably use this long past the baby stage.

B009JZTOG8|5.0|This show is simply amazing. Once upon a time is enjoyable of all ages. It manages to blend real life and the imaginary in a way that still makes sense. One of my favorite things is that they can twist the stories we all knew and loved growing up into their own versions without upsetting viewers to the point that we want to stand up, draw the line and cry &#34;You sir, have gone too far!!!&#34;.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The usual heart warming story by Nicholas Sparks.  A feel good read. I am anxious to see the movie and hope it remains true to the story.
B004U8VX2M|3.0|Too slow.  I guess i'm used to the more updated version, &#34;Downton Abbey.&#34;  Maybe if I hadn't seen it before, I might be more entertained.  Interesting to see two actors that reappeared in DA, only older...and even better.

B00BHMETKC|5.0|Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but to all those who love to leave negative reviews because a movie is not completely &#34;factual&#34;, you're really wasting the fingers you're using, and probably some under-the-breath muttering, as you're typing your review.  Any time you see a movie that says &#34;based on real events&#34; doesn't mean it's going to be 100% factual.  Why oh why does anyone EVER expect ANY Hollywood movie to be?  I've said it before, and I'll say it again.  IT'S JUST A MOVIE FOLKS!!!<br /><br />If you can go into this movie with that in mind, then you just might enjoy it, or at the least, be interested in the content enough to seek out a documentary about the actual Iran hostage crisis the movie's based on to learn the historical facts if you don't already know them.  Then again, there are those out there who can never be pleased and have to pick apart and tear down a movie based on either one scene or every little nit-picking thing they can about it.  All I can say to that is you must not be much of a movie lover if you have to do that in my view.<br /><br />This movie was TERRIFIC!.  It moved along at a perfect pace with impeccable timing of each scene as the story unfolded, and it was extremely tenacious, tensely dramatic, and very, very well acted and depicted.  The musical score was perfect as well as everything about the '79-80 backdrop (back when I was in my early 20's).  If you hadn't known that this was a 2012 production, you might have thought you were watching a movie made in the late 70's, as the cinematography could not have been more realistic.  I felt like I was there throughout the entire movie.<br /><br />I was especially impressed with the &#34;underplayed&#34; characterization by Ben Affleck (otherwise referred to as &#34;emotionless&#34; by another reviewer), which I actually found quite refreshing in all honesty.  I thought the restraint that he probably had to exercise as an actor to portray this CIA operative wasexactly what was called for, and that is was, in all likelihood, accurate in keeping with the real-life person he portrayed.  He was neither unemotional nor too emotional; which made his acting nothing less than brilliant to me.<br /><br />Contrary to what others might say, I didn't think anything was over-the-top in this movie either; not even the scene which negative reviewers are eluding to about the run-way scene.  How else would you expect that scene to play out?  It was completely and totally necessary to the suspense, IMHO, therefore complimenting the scene as it should without dragging on forever.  I thought I would have a heart attack before that plane got off the ground, and I burst into tears when the &#34;all clear&#34; finally came.  To pull that off in a movie where the viewer knows what the outcome is going to be speaks volumes to me!<br /><br />The entire film was perfectly built up, played out, and extremely riveting, thrilling, and suspenseful in the final scenes.  The acting was spot-on at every turn, from all the leads to everyone cast as extras in the crowd of chanting Iranians and droves of supporting actors.  You could really feel the crowd's totally understandable ire (from their perspective at least) from the very beginning until the end, as well as the angst of the hostages being rescued and their reservations about pulling off a terrifying feat necessary to their escape.  The comedic portions, most especially with John Goodman and Alan Arkin of course, are priceless too. And you've GOT to love Bryan Cranston; especially if you know him from &#34;Breaking Bad&#34;.<br /><br />I watched the Oscars recently and hadn't seen any of the movies nominated for best film of the year.  This is the first, and I will try to see the others ASAP, but I do believe it will be difficult to top this one; which really leads me to believe that this film truly deserved the Academy Award that Ben Affleck, George Clooney, and Grant Heslov (all as producers of the movie) received for it.  I might add that Affleck has also really come into his own as a director which is clearly evident in this film.  I think it's probably one of the most well-made movies I've seen in a very long time, so I can't recommend it any higher.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Couldn't put this book down!!! From beginning to end it had me captivated. I very highly recommend this to everyone
B00004Y3OU|2.0|Beware!  This dvd is formated for Europe and will not play on most dvd's in the U.S., but it can be played on a laptop or desktop computer.  There is a &#34;free&#34; program on the internet to reformat it but I did not feel that skilled.  I had it reformated by a professional who made a pricing mistake and it cost me $20; otherwise it would have cost $40 to reformat. ..I was determined to have a copy I could play on my dvd.  The film is a classic...a real work of art!
B006LSZECO|1.0|Interesting story, very vulgar.  I will not read another book by this author.  My friends did not like it either

B0096PAA6E|4.0|Still digesting this cd.  Gary Clark is definitely the real deal; a great musician.  Ill be following his career, looking for his older stuff; & this album will likely end up a 5 star once I've spent more time with it (just haven't had the time yet).  Would definitely check this out.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|It is kind of eighties-sounding, but I love that the songs are all fairly up tempo.  There is some sort of complexity to the music too that I can't quite put my finger on. It is a short album however - under 40 min. long.
B003YK42LQ|5.0|These guys are clearly family - the intricacies of their playing by HEARING each other is very apparent - they almost anticipate what the other is going to do.  Also the songs are well written - would hold up with just an acoustic & singing.  Like them more & more.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|LOVED IT! Great story, love, a little suspense and an interesting unsuspected little twist at the end a  Nicholas Sparks... need I say more :-)
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Thanks for your super fast shipping! This was a gift for my gma and she hasn't watched it yet, but she was thrilled and I was happy she received it even faster than expected!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Lots of fun anzd very addicting. If I had to say anything negative about it would be that you have to play a very long time to get enough credits to buy new items and characters.
B00BHU9BV6|2.0|I give that warning in the title of my review so that you don't make the mistake I very nearly did:  ordering it to watch with my husband, who is very anti-artsy (I know, not a real word, but I'm hoping I can describe what I mean) and would have bailed in the first 30 minutes.<br /><br />I should also note that I am a huge fan of this classic novel and am likely far too picky when it comes to interpretations.  I agree with other reviewers who stated that a large subtext of the novel was entirely missed and there was far too much emphasis on Anna's ultimate fate.  Whoever wrote the screenplay clearly did not \\"get\\" Tolstoy.  But no matter, there were other things that ruined the film for me.....<br /><br />I must describe the \\"artsy\\" part so you will know ahead of time if this kind of film suits you.  The movie is presented as a stage production.  Not quite a musical, but choreographed like one (ie, background characters performing tasks in tandem to music, frozen characters on the dance floor to emphasize Anna and Vronksy dancing, etc and so on).  New scenes are introduced by stage scenery changes, just as if you were in a real theater.  Much of the background information you need to know, such as Stiva and Dolly's problems that first bring Anna to Moscow, are done without much dialog, just the melodramatic over-acting to music that you would see on stage.  Hope you can picture this in your head.<br /><br />Anyway, I ultimately disliked the film intensely.  I was willing to overlook that casting of Knightly in the title role because of my adoration for the book, but in this case, Knightly didn't ruin the movie, the screenplay and choice of presentation did.  Stick to the book.  Then rent one of the older movie versions, which I think were much more enjoyable.

0099519852|5.0|This is a great book for musicians.  I began playing the piano when I was 3 and played my first concert when I was 5.  I started teaching piano when I was 12.  Many of the teaching and learning technics mentioned in the book I've been doing all my life.  It was great to be validated.  And I learned some new things also.  There are lots of ways to learn things quickly and thoroughly.  This book opens your eyes to some possibilities that might otherwise be overlooked.

0812993292|4.0|THE UNLIKELY PILGRIMAGE of HAROLD FRY by RACHEL JOYCE<br /><br />Thanks to lovely Leanne Oliver and Transworld Publishing for sending me review copy of this amazing book!<br /><br />Harold and Maureen are a retired couple, who live their simple days in Devon. Their lives has been invisible and conventional. Harold always did what he was supposed to do, and their marriage became nothing. But one day happens something that will change the rest of their lives forever. That day a letter arrives for Harold, from his old colleague Queenie Hennessy, and when Harold goes out to post his response he walks. And he doesn't stop. He continues walking and doesn't plan on stopping before he gets to Queenie, to save her.<br /><br />While reading this amazing debut novel written by brilliant Rachel Joyce I cried, I laughed and I realized. Although on first look you may think that the reason for Harolds determination to walk until he finds Queenie is romantic love, you'll be surprised. Rachel did an amazing job of keeping the jealousy flame alive between Harold and his wife.<br /><br />From the minute I got this book I loved it. If I was about to buy a book simply based on the cover art I would buy this one. But this book is much more than just an appealing cover. It is moving, charming, beautifully written, unusual and unassuming. I could not help but to love Harold, almost as he was my own grandad. Storytelling is really powerful, and it didn't lost my attention once. It will make your brain work hard and try to figure out his reasons.<br /><br />Buy this book and embark on this beautiful self-rediscovering journey with Harold while he meets some interesting and past-haunting characters on his way. Although the story has just a simple plot, it will surprise you and stay with you for a long time after you finish reading it.<br /><br />There are many, many beautiful quotes in this book that I am going to use from now on, but this one will stay with me for the rest of my life.<br /><br />\\"The world was made up of people putting one foot in front of the other, and a life might appear ordinary simply because the person living it had been doing so for a long time.\\"

And that is not the worse part when I had enough for elf tricky it restarted me when I had enough for Tony it restarted me when I had enough for carmen it restarted me abed when I had over 100 000 coins it restarted me I wonder what will happen when I get to Rome!!!
B003NFM3JU|5.0|I seen this movie at the the theatre and was surprised how scary it was. My grandson kept turning his head so he wouldn't see the scary parts. When I told people they were surprised that it was scary but when they watched it they ageed. I buy all my 3D movies from Amazon because of price and ease.
1594203334|5.0|I read this when my new granddaughter was born and it was very interesting and fun to read, so I bought a copy for my daughter, a brand-new mother, and she loved it! She said she read it twice, then gave it to a friend. She is actually using ideas from the book with her new baby, now seven months old. By the way, I read a library copy, but also bought a copy for my wife so she wouldn't have to wait, and she loved it, too.
B008MZPVP4|5.0|I've been a fan of Down for a long time and have all their studio albums. Their third one, \\"Over the Under\\", left me a little underwhelmed even though it was good so I was psyched when I saw this lying around the record store.<br /><br />This EP has a HUGE Black Sabbath influence to it; the band still keep their trademark sound but they really prove that they can successfully try on something new and still sound just as good as ever. There aren't as many blistering guitar solos but there are a few here; the guitars are heavy as ever and still just as inventive. Some reviewers have said that Phil Anselmo's voice doesn't sound as good anymore. I beg to differ, it just sounds different from screaming his lungs out for years; just because it doesn't sound the exact same way it did with Pantera or on \\"Nola\\" doesn't mean the guy still can't pull it off (which he does well).<br /><br />I enjoyed this EP much more than \\"Over the Under\\" because it packed a punch, had clever songwriting twists and the band sounds like they have more life back in them now. This EP for me is like the first 3 Black Sabbath albums re-visited with a harder/grittier edge and I mean that in the best way possible. I look forward to the EP's to follow this one.<br /><br />For fans of Down or Pantera, don't expect Phil Anselmo's voice to be the same after years of screaming his brains out and also don't base your opinion of this EP on what previous Down albums sounded like. Give it a shot and I know that if you hear it unbiased, you'll like something on it (most likely the whole thing).<br /><br />For fans new to Down, start with \\"Nola\\" or \\"Down 2\\" and work your way up to this.<br /><br />If you're a big Black Sabbath fan, check out \\"Witchtripper\\", \\"The Curse is a Lie\\", and \\"Misfortuneteller\\" because it might peak your interest.

B000001DYD|5.0|Polly Jean Harvey comes in with a roar with this album; the songs are abrasive, vulnerable, emotional, and at times even primal sounding. There's plenty of distortion to be found all over the place but every part of fuzz or feedback serves a specific purpose to compliment a song. PJ's lyrics have a lot of animosity/resentment in them but there's also a lot of passion in them. Her delivery can sometimes sound like a mix of Janis Joplin and Bjork; sometimes she'll even just howl or moan unexpectedly. You can almost feel her emotions and conviction when she really gets going. This sounds very much like the sound that was dubbed \\"Grunge\\" at times (Nirvana, Mudhoney, L7) but she also experiments a lot here to good result. Her style is very avant garde and is extremely unique. The production levels sound like Steve Albini at times but other times sound like a lo-fi boombox. You wouldn't expect it to work but it really does here.<br /><br />PJ Harvey can be hard to swallow for some people; I had to give this album 3 spins and it got better each time I heard it, PJ Harvey really grows on you if you give her a chance. This album sets out what it wants to accomplish: a set of songs tinged with a \\"grungy\\" sound but also experimental at times with lo-fi rawness.<br /><br />For people who like PJ Harvey, I don't have to sell you on this album.<br /><br />For people who haven't heard of PJ Harvey or have heard a song or 2, really give this album a shot because it will pleasantly surprise you. All the songs on this album are great and full of drive and energy.<br /><br />I highly recommend this amazing album.
B008602KQI|5.0|Read the book, saw the movie in theaters, & then purchased the DVD as a Christmas gift for my younger brother. Great action packed movie!

Jennifer Lawrence does a great job at portraying the main character Katniss Everdean!

B004XQYBA2|5.0|This app, as it says, has 10,000+ different puzzles in eight different difficulty levels. Each difficulty has 1,250 different puzzles. The puzzles play smoothly, and load very quickly. Once you choose a puzzle, hit 2 buttons and it's loaded. As everyone knows, in Sudoku, the timer runs and keeps track of how fast you complete a puzzle, and this app has the ability to pause the timer if you have to put it down for a minute or so to do something else. Another handy feature is the ability to go back and remove your last move, or your last 2 moves, or ever how many you want. That comes in very handy in allowing you to quickly correct your mistakes without getting your board in a mess. This is just two of the many features the game has.<br /><br />Settings are very detailed. You can choose portrait, landscape, or automatic, that way it doesn't change your orientation for your entire phone/tablet, just this app. Furthermore, in either of these modes you can choose to have the app fullscreen or not fullscreen, You can also choose how you want to input your entries, by clicking the letter first or the cell first, how much help you want in locating your mistakes and/or correcting them, and how you want your Sudoku to look (text size, font, table color).<br /><br />All of the features work well and the graphics are sharp. The menus quickly allow you to resume a game, view games that you have completed, and choose new games. This game is a great for the free app of the day, and (I don't say this often) if you like Sudoku, it's worth the $2.49. With so many levels and so many features, this is the Sudoku app you need and the only one.<br />(Kindle Fire HD)

B0013LL2Z2|3.0|I was silly enough to purchase the 2007 region-1 DVD, hoping to get a new transfer of the film (the one used for the Blu-ray with the same cover published at about the same time). I have uploaded three screenshots for comparison. They clearly show that the 1998 and 2007 DVD are identical (incidentally the screenshots have the exact same file size); the R2 DVD (the only one I will keep) is taken from the same transfer but the image is much sharper and shows a bit more information on the right and left. Maybe some of the more technical-minded will find this interesting.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I LOVE this book.  It is amazing to read.<br /><br />Katniss lives in a time when stuggle is normal and expected.  And once a year all the kids in districts 1 through 12 ages 12-18 show up to collect two tributes, A boy and a girl for Panems Hunger Games.  A literal fight to the death where 24 go in but only one can come out.  When Katniss's 12 year old sister Primrose is called Katniss volunteers to take her place.  Knowing she will probably die she does all she can to give herself the best chance she can.  You have to read this book. EVEN if you have seen the movie.  THis book is even better.

B004J64QSI|5.0|[Opening Note: I am not at all a theater or opera connoisseur (I saw the 2012 film and thought I'd check out a stage version, which might be heresy to some). The nuances that others may observe are still worth considering, but this review is written as one who doesn't much mind how &#34;powerful&#34; a voice is or how much it stays true to the original, and so, I think, may be more useful for others in a similar, lowly state when approaching musicals.]<br /><br />Practically everything in this rendition of Les Miserables is perfect. Alfie Boe as Jean Valjean is beyond description; he doesn't have an off moment, and be brings every lyrical twist to it's highest level. He is especially well-paired with Norm Lewis (Javert), whose intersinging pieces work so well. Likewise, all of the other performers are great and, in my opinion, gave better performances than those present in the 10th anniversary edition.<br /><br />Nick Jonas has been lampooned in some reviews because he's not operatic. That might be true (and I have no idea what decision-making process landed him this role) but personally I find his performance as Marius to be the best I've seen among the movie and other stage versions available on Youtube. He has a very good blend of smooth singing, emotional distortion, and realistic inflection.<br /><br />The sound and orchestra are very good as well: clean, expressive, and always enhancing the singers' performances. The two encore pieces with past cast members was also a great addition.<br /><br />One other thing I like about the stage version is that the less-well composed pieces between the big show tunes are far less prominent than in the movie. Since there isn't any acting or as much of a slowed pace due to the movie's acting focus over singing, these problems just appear and are gone without much notice, which improves it substantially in my opinion. There are some awkward lyrics and music throughout but, again, this was far less bothersome here than in themovie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game and no Luther game will ever live il to it. as I said it is the best game ever !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B003ZWN7KU|4.0|I find it amusing how people gave this movie so many bad reviews. I had seen far worse on the Chiller channel. Is it as good as Dawn or Day of the Dead? No. The most important question: Was I entertained by it? Absolutely. There was a lot of humor and even though the characters were very flawed, they were sympathetic. I was surprised how much I actually CARED about these people.<br />I do admit it would've been nicer if there were more practical effects and more gore. Yet, it still hold within the Romero universe of zombies, eventually would start to evolve, like animals. I like that dynamic that Romero adds to his films, instead of zombies just lumbering around and eating flesh.<br />To sum up, I enjoy the Romero zombie movies (YES, I WAS EVEN ENTERTAINED BY DIARY OF THE DEAD). Some weren't as good as others, but none of them were awful. Thanks to Mr. Romero for giving me so much fun and entertainment.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I don't always go into Facebook with  my laptop, so I am able to see what is going on at a moment notice.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game I ever downloaded, no glitches Or bugs.<br />The maker don't bug you to buy stuff to continue playing the game. If I could give more stars I would.<br />Thanks to Amazon for having this game available on the Kindle Fire.
B00BHMETKC|1.0|I dont know why but the voice and mouth movemts didn't match up . Didn't enjoy this movie at all.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My kid likes this game. He has a good time playing this. I have played it a little as well. It is enjoyable.
0345803485|5.0|The funny thing is...Im not a big reader ! Mostly do to the time to just sit and read ! With that being said, I have always wanted to read this 50 shades book that everyone talks about ! The book was so captavating that I was able to read it in 4 days and I also worked 40 hrs. during this 4 days !! LOL ! As I got 3/4 through the book I told my self to order the next in the trilogy..I was so engaged that I found myself at the last few pages, and had not listened to my own request to order the next book ! So, I finished the book and went straight to my PC and ordered the next 2 in this trilogy ! Im 42 yrs. and this book brings out the young vibrant self I was and (still am) ! I have NEVER written a book review, nor really taken the time to sit and read since I was ordered to do so in school ! Im actually excited to recieve the next book ! Im getting things done around the house so I can take the time to sit and read ! LOL ! As 50 shades states, &#34;another first&#34; ! MD
B00B2QA646|5.0|Such an amazing and sad story I've never seen any of the other versions of the movie but this one was done amazingly well, I love the setting and the flow, hard and sad movie for a hard and sad book but done wonderfully!
B00335EQ0E|5.0|This is so great and I want to party my unbirthday every day! Very cute retro Disney Movie. A must have in any collection.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|This movie was good. I thought that it would be good. It was. I was right about that.<br />No rel surprises here--not talking about the plot, necessarily... Just. Not floored by anything. Denzel's amazing. Duh.
B002U3CCKQ|5.0|This author is marvelous!  Her books are well thought out and very compelling. They are also very dark.<br />I am not into devil worship and the hacking to death of helpless animals.  Unfortunately, I had purchased the audible version of this book and was unable to skip these parts. I must give Ms. Flynn a five star rating because of her talent, but this book is not for the faint hearted and parts of it are difficult to get through.
037571457X|5.0|I love love this book! It is extremely funny and very entertaining. I also love that it's a comic depicting a period where things were not considered \\"laughable\\". But I've learnt and laughed thanks to this book!
B008OOYALE|4.0|This is fun, but it does take some time to advance.  I like the graphics, and music.  It would nice if getting to the other players was easier too.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Best book I have read in years.  Once you start reading you will not be able to put the book down.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Great fun, and a wonderful way to pass the time and be challenged at the same time!  Will enjoy this one for a long time!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Need I say more. But I have to write like 18 words to describe what it is I like about this movie. Well, it's AVATAR and it is in 3D!
B00AQTY3XA|5.0|What a wonderful movie on life and love.  It is a story on goal setting, hard work, committment and over coming fear!  I have a feeling the surf genre spooked people away.  Too many sterotypes to overcome.  This is a must see!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This movie is engaging from the beginning to the end. The 3D isn't too bad either. I absolutely love it!
1451695195|5.0|I have had a NDE myself and can really relate to Eben's story. There IS a better life after death &#60;3
B00B7807PM|5.0|I just finished watching the finale on streaming video for this season.  I understand there will be a 4th Season...SO excited to hear that.
B000021XS0|5.0|I am a little late to the Dream Theater train. My old manager at a guitar store played them a lot, and I like many owned their token release \\"Images and Words.\\" I never disliked them, but I never truly appreciated them. Fast forward 14 years and I am picking up things I never heard before (or never bothered to hear). These guys are truly masterful musicians, and as a musician myself I can tell you what they do is not easy. I couldn't do this if I practiced 24 hours straight each day for the next 20 years. What is even more amazing is how they do this while not descending into shameless showmanship at the expense of the composition. So many bands that have their chops do that. I can appreciate someone who is good at their craft like anyone, but so many of these acts compromise composition for complexity it is fun to see the few who can put both together. That is NOT EASY folks. To shred and to do it without compromising the song is another level of genius most never reach. That is how good these guys are. The guys who give this fine work of art one star have no idea what their talking about. This album could very well be studied in music halls across the country hundreds of years from now right along with the classical composers of old. I have no doubt in my mind if Mozart was alive today this could very well be the type of music he would release.
B00B0NDF26|4.0|Its good but not as good as their previous work, probably cuz they're more pop than indie now. Just buy The Con.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I love it so much but I wish the app was free not 2.oo and the Toca boca has some good apps keep on going people
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a lot like temple run. They update it to another part of the world every 30 days. It is up there on about 2nd with minecraft 1st. U should get It if you like Temple Run 1or2
B004I744AS|5.0|This is a great app. You can customize the home page the way you want it. It is an easy app to use.
B00BHNQ5XK|1.0|Read the one star reviews. Everyone nails it. There is no way the 5 star ratings are accurate. People get paid to right reviews for horrible movies. I'm totally convinced that is true.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|I found this book difficult to put down, reading it beyond midnight when my alarm rings at 5am.  The main characters develop throughout the story, as well as the supporting characters.  I'm looking forward to reading more and more of Courtney Milan!
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I loved this game until it reset my settings. I had a huge high score and now it wont even let me get the new update. ok game but I wouldn't recommend it anymore
B005WUHAX8|5.0|So great and great price, I shower and swim with my phone now and if it gets dirty I rinse it off in the sink. Love it
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This an amazing book, Christian is getting closer to Anastasia especially after they wed. They are beautiful people inside & out. I  feel bad for Christian because of all he went through when he was a toddler. Grace and Carrick adopting him was the best thing that could ever happen to Christian. I'm very disappointed that this trilogy is over. Quite possibly one of the best books I have ever read.:)
B000059MEL|4.0|Of course this record is amazing, but there was some scratches on it pre-opening which causes major skipping, there is one song that is SO BAD and its one of my favorite songs on the album, so that was a bummer to figure out :/
B003JTHXOK|5.0|A great book...couldn't put it down...thought it was better than the movie!  The movie just cut out too many parts.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surfers is an amazing game and I love how every once in a while they change the scenery and they make the scenery so much fun to watch as I run
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I was super excited when I found out Temple Run too existed. I immediately downloaded and played it. I am happy to say that it is just as addicting, if not more so, as the first. It is more difficult, also, which only adds to the awesomeness of it. The only problem I can note at this point is that the monster is sometimes too big and I cant see the road ahead clearly. But this could just be my own personal problem. Bravo Imangi for two amazing games!!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I just finished book two of the hunger games trilogy, I almost know what to expect in the second film.<br />Anyways, it's a good story, can't wait to read Mocking Jay!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This series moves one through emotional highs and terrific lows and leaves me desperately wanting more at the very end. So hard to wait for the next season!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i loved this game i used to have. any now not and it is a good past timd of mine to thumds up
B007REV4YI|5.0|Skyfall is a tour de force and yes it is just a radio!!!!!! The latest installment of Bond is a fabuloous movie and it fills in my open slot on my 50 years of Bond BluRay set.  And BTW Adele Rocks!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is totally awesome please comment mine and I'll comment yours you are all awesome and please comment mine you are all awesome
0881030376|5.0|Awesome! I wanted to read John Steinbeck books because I live in Monterey county which is the area he wrote about.
B006I1OB0U|5.0|Watching Downton Abbey is better than therapy!  I highly recommend it for everyone!  The plot is excellent, and no costume drama could ever be more perfect.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Couldn't put it down!  I loved it and can't wait for the next one too come out! If you liked fifty you'll like this one too!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Just Like a normal alarm clock it is just as if you had one on your nightstand except better. Total yes. I am single by the way.;)
0316228532|1.0|I read and enjoyed the Harry Potter series, so I expected quality storytelling. Instead, this book is full of the most horrible, unlikable, mean and selfish characters imaginable. The story line is contrived and unbelievable. I am sorry I spent my time reading this to the end. One of the worst books I have ever read.
B00A3AYI50|5.0|I can listen to this over and over and over again!! Awesome from beginning to end. Can't wait for album #2!!
1616550414|5.0|juste awesome, every true zelda fans need this! it's full of  drawings and pics from all zeldas, big and clean
B008KMHFJY|5.0|Have you ever read a book that has actually blown you away and one that in its weird way has left you filled with a variety of emotions and all you can do is scream OMG this was awesome. I have had the Beautiful Disaster sitting on my Kindle for a long time and as people who know me my TBR list is like miles long. When I went down to Wellington for a holiday, I was lucky enough to find on my way to the library which by the way I got so lost - I saw a sign that said &#34;The Bookmark&#34; and I thought to myself hmmm , that might be a second-hand bookshop. I walked down the escalator and imagine my delight when I discovered it was a second-hand bookshop filled with floor to ceiling books galore. It was like heaven. Among my finds to my extreme delight and I think I may have squealed a bit too was a paperback copy of Beautiful Disaster - if you wondered why I squealed it was because it is not available for purchase in New Zealand shops. So of course I brought it and started reading it and reader's I can tell you that this is definitely one book that once you pick it up , you honest to god won't be able to put it down as there is something about the characters tat draw you in and leave you gasping for more.<br /><br />Now this book , I decided to check out the reviews on Goodreads and it has had it's fair share of Onesies and I after reading the book cannot believe it but then it got me thinking that they were so focused on the fact that he was a &#34;so-called violent obsessive boyfriend&#34; that they missed the real essence of the book. See I am one for the Byronic Hero - to me the Byronic Hero symbolises the epitome for the Romantic guy.  Think Heathcliff , Edward Cullen , Edward Rochester , Caleb from Captive in the Dark and even Christian Grey. Each of these guys have one thing in common they are all based on the characteristics of the Byronic Hero and Travis Maddox was no different. So he might have been a bit obsessive , have the occasional violent outburst but he would never hurt Abby and he loved her with all his heart , he opened himself up to a side that no-one else had the privilege to see.<br />Whereas Abby Abernathy, the main female lead I found was to be in a way a strong character - in the way that she is not OTT like Katniss Everdeen from The Hunger Games but she is strong in spirit and she knows what she wants and is not afraid to stand up for what is right - think America from The Elite series by Kiera Cass crossed with Addy Davidson from First Date by Krista McGee . You could feel yourself relating to Abby as you read the novel and going through the predicament that she had found herself in.<br /><br />In Beautiful Disaster , without giving too much away we meet main characters Playboy &#34;I sleep with a different girl every night&#34; Travis Maddox and Straight and I'm trying to change my life &#34;Abby Abernathy&#34; . These two meet at a boxing match and from then , their friendship blossoms into something that no-one has seen before and though they try to understand it - they can't. Beautiful Disaster follows these two on their bumpy journey of a love/hate friendship that always holds the possibility to becoming something more but not quite reaching that point ? Will they become a pair by the end of the novel or will Abby and Travis discover that they are better off staying close friends than lovers ?<br /><br />This is one book that I think everyone should read and as you can tell by the reviews you will either love it or hate it and readers if you did love or find it too your liking then stay tuned and add to your watchlist &#34;Walking Disaster&#34; which is Travis's POV.he would never hurt Abby and he loved her with all his heart , he opened himself up to a side that no-one else had the privilege to see.<br />Whereas Abby Abernathy, the main female lead I found was to be in a way a strong character - in the way that she is not OTT like Katniss Everdeen from The Hunger Games but she is strong in spirit and she knows what she wants and is not afraid to stand up for what is right - think America from The Elite series by Kiera Cass crossed with Addy Davidson from First Date by Krista McGee .

B004I744AS|5.0|I always used tfd website because of the audio feature so not only would I know how to spell the word correctly but also how to pronounce it. Now, I can carry it with me every where with the app!  Absolutely love it!
B001HN69AY|3.0|Some movies are a bit of a mind game, this one was a bit slow and the game wasn't that fun.  I liked the characters, the actors and the movie was pretty but by the end of it I really didn't care about any of them getting anything they wanted (heck, I wasn't sure what half of them wanted)  It was pretty and if I get really bored I might go back and see if there is a directory commentary for this one and see if there was a point to any of it.
B003IKMR0U|3.0|This made a great gift for my zombie loving brother. The game is easy to play and learn and goes quick. It makes a great drinking game! The packaging was very basic but he loved it!
B006XIR9KM|2.0|Simple and a bit entertaining.  I played this a bit when I first got it but there wasn't anything as entertainig as tetris or bejeweled about it to make me want to play it more than when I am in line or something like that.  I'd rather read an e-mail than this.  I give this a solid &#34;Meh!&#34;
0385733577|5.0|We purchased this book for our 12 year old son who isn't an avid reader. This book has kept his interest and he intends to try and read the entire series.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|A movie that is 3rd is usually questionable and this one with the time travel bit I was really up in the air initially.  I have a family friend that likes to see everything that comes out as soon as they can and I happened to see them the weekend of this movies initial release.  His review was “not enough action, it was all story, boring…”  I looked at my wife and we both cracked up, a movie with a story, how terrible. We saw it that weekend and loved it, a character that lives as a quantum focal point, seeing all variations of a time and place all at once was a genius move.  Some movies fail at a sequel (MIB2 is a stinker) but they got it right the third time around.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This needs to be a required read. Mentally ill people need to be understood and regarded as human. I suffer from many physical problems but also mental. I am definitely not as bad as some but I understand and anyone that reads will more than likely understand mental illness, unlike my ex who said I didn't need the \\"poison\\" (pills) until I was so emotional without them that he wanted me to go back on them. I realize this is a movie as well and have not seen it but books are always better than movies in my eyes. Anyone can find something in this book that helps them in life. Negative thoughts and/or words can make negative things happen. Positive thoughts and/or words can make life beautiful even if by the power of suggestion.
B006OE7XM4|5.0|All I can say is this man voice, poetry, musical styling, and band have brought me to tears of joy.  I have not been so happy to receive and listen to music like this is a long time.  Just buy it and envelope Mr. Gregory Porter's interpretation of jazz at it's finest.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the most amazing game that I have ever played and I am looking forward to more updates and hover boards!!!
B009B50QOU|3.0|After the last two albums, this was pretty disappointing.  It's grown on me a little, but it's simplistic without the charm or sincerity of the earlier stuff (1039 Smoothed Out Slappy Hours, Kerplunk), and no where near as anthemic as American Idiot.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I can't imagine being a black person during that era, but I certainly can imagine giving Hilly her &#34;just desserts&#34; like Minny did!
0920236162|5.0|This is one of those books that I read as a child, and want to share it with the younger generation. I bought this for my collection so that when my nieces and nephew come by. The message that in the end you can do it yourself and should strive to be clever than your enemies is one that all children should hear. It is also pretty funny too! Definitely get this for your kids if you don't have it already.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Off to a good start so I may have to come back to this (if I remember & have time).
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|Not sure yet have not put this in use yet I'm waiting! Think I'm. Comming back later to view tips any guidelines on a few subjects before I start using some especially in android I'm sure I will love this! !!!!*****Thank you for asking! !!!*****
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book ended the way I hoped it would. My husband got me to read this book b/c so many other females raved about it. Had to get the second one.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love the fact that you can save photos and review later, but I have not used the new version app was difficult. So I settled to sign in with facebook because they saved my day to get me in. I feel at fault because I didn't fey around to doing the new app I will give a try with the videos I have in youtube! !!!!****** Thank you for asking Dixie Crabtree!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This one started and ended in a way I was not expeccting. Had to get the 3rd one right away.
0736092269|5.0|I was looking for a more in-depth, detailed book about exercise anatomy to compliment my training manuals. This book is exactly what I needed. It has much more practical, comprehensive information than I thought it would. Very detailed, and easy to understand. A perfect companion to all current and future fitness professionals. A must have.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I am amazed by the quality but disappionted that it doesn't load quickly. Sometimes it errors but still worth it overall. My daughter loves it.
B008TSVZHM|5.0|I bought a new camera that takes micro sd cards. I needed something to store them in. This item is a great idea and very clever. I really love the jelly bean android design on the front and the labels on the back for each slot. I also bought the red android design to keep track of my micro sd cards for my cell phone, and mp3 players. The one thing that would makes this product even better, is if they had a little sleeve or case that slid over this little credit card sized item to keep dust and dirt out and some extra labels.
B00B5A9FOG|5.0|I have fallen in love with all of these characters. I have discovered that the BBC is very very good at producing excellent series. I am very sorry that this one is at an end.
0060531053|5.0|Papazian does a great job of guiding you through step by step for your first brew. I used it exclusively and my first batch came out great.<br /><br />When you feel a little more adventurous you can use some of his recipes and his tables to tweak any recipe the way you want.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|This production was phenomenol.  I loved the fact they had the original cast return and all the Jeans sang together. The current Jean was fantastic.
1449415881|4.0|It is amazing how often what is on this calendar coincides with what is happening in my workplace.  Makes me feel better, since that likely means it is happeni\ng elsewhere, too.
B0088WK6CE|5.0|I purchased this album as I like anything Glen Hansard. This album has not disappointed. Some may not like some of the songs, but I feel it's something that the artist in Hansard had to let out. I find myself skipping other songs in my playlist to get to songs on this album. Great!
B009E3EY38|4.0|Each one of the Band maintains the essential core ability that made them one of the 5 greatest in rock history IMO. The Beatles,Jimi Hendrix,Frank Zappa,Steely Dan and Led Zeppelin.There have been many great songs by other artists, but the overall work of these bands warrants my choice.<br /><br />Robert Plant quite often hits the highs by utilizing his voice very judiciously, going as high as he needs when he can.That is quite amazing, and so is Plant's timing & phrasing which is now developed to a very high degree.Plant really does hold this all together, his voice truly representing a life well lived whilst somehow still sounding young.John Paul Jones adds sonorous, vigorous Bass underpinning and a certain gravitas to the sound,his keyboard styling perfectly executed and toned.It is great to actually hear J.P.J, as I find the greatest weakness of Led Zeppelin albums is his quite often poorly mixed Bass. Jason Bonham is not the added extra here, he is the Led in this Zeppelin and his Father would be very proud and honoured to have such a fine drummer playing his work.<br /><br />Jimmy Page somehow plays like a cross between a Primitive Warrior Clansman and a Field Marshall, variously thrashing out a storm of brilliant timbral chordal swashes interspersed with authoritative riffing and maniacal leads which sound both off the cuff and planned.Whilst he may have lost a little sharpness in his leads, it does not matter a whit.His slow playing and slide is incredibly subtle and inflected, with the finest degree of variation each time it repeats. There is a core spiritual force of nature that Jimmy Page harnesses, yet has a life of it's own and in my view, tells me why in 200 years musicians will study Led Zeppelin and it will be considered part of the 20th Centuries greatest artistic achievements. This music is where 20th Century life, the Medieval and Mythological bore it's finest fruit.Certainly, along with Deep Purple the Pinnacle of Hard Rock from opposite ends ofthe spectrum.<br /><br />I only resist a 5 as I feel Jimmy's sound could have been mastered a little louder.A Celebration Day it truly was and Ahmet Ertegun would be a very happy soul, wherever he is.
B007N85POS|5.0|I bought this for myself to play on my kindle. I had already completed the entire game on my phone and wanted a different experience. I can see more detail on my kindle and now am working on getting 3 stars on all of the levels.
B003V9OCIS|5.0|Gripping movie. Very well made tale of bravery, friendship and love! I could not pause the movie for a second!
B000FC146C|5.0|I have actually read this book 15 or 16 times. The characters are so awesome. The terribly evil character of Aunt Mary.<br />Every time I read it again I find some other little item I some how missed when I read it before. Sometimes I just like to reread  the story.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|My husband and I were not interested in watching this. We were snowed in and the kids were bouncing off the walls. I rented this on Amazon for the kids. I was running around cleaning and started watching it. It is SO FUNNY! Later that night my husband and I watched it again. We ended up buying it.
B002X4OKRK|3.0|The movie itself was good but the playback was at times intermittent and left my kids frustrated. Hopefully the next movie we order will have better playback.
B003L7DK74|5.0|I have been a long time fan of Flight of the Conchords.  I love their music, their interactions, and many of the episodes remind me of the 7 wild years I spent living in NYC.  This set is great - I always feel great after a dose of the show. While I could do without the extra feature of Dave's commercials, I love the One Nigh Stand show and have watched it at least a dozen times.  If you like the show, get this set - it's a real deal.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Amazing end to the series!!! I'm really happy with the way it all ended!! Will there be another one I wonder?!
B00138J234|5.0|I always knew the Clash were important, but never really gave this album a good listen until recently. The music is actually pretty sophisticated, and played not just with attitude but with great confidence. I've heard the US edition of the first album, and also &#34;Combat Rock&#34;, and those are OK, but this is better played and better recorded.
B0095VP8D4|5.0|I ordered this item with my expectations kept low after reading multiple reviews about the graphics capabilities. I bought it so that I wouldn't need a dedicated graphics card separate with my computer. It installed easily upon arrival, and all I can say is wow. This processor is fast, the graphics are incredible for built-in (Can run Arkham City minus DX11), and it stays at a lower temperature. I have not tried to OC this yet, but from what I can tell, I probably won't need to. Overall, it's a great processor, with a nice onboard video. (Note: I haven't tried Dual Graphics yet). If you're looking for a cheap gaming processor, look no further.
B0014LX420|4.0|I picked this up because, first, Amazon had the mp3 on sale for real cheap, and second, Richard Thomson once did a brilliant solo acoustic cover of &#34;Did It Again&#34; in an interview I heard. Mostly when the name came up around me it was someone citing her career as somehow being example number 1 of what was wrong with the music biz. What I hear in these songs is that a lot of time and talent went into the sound, the production if you will. It's really smooth and has a lot of interesting musical bits all fit together perfectly. It's only in the few slow numbers where things break down for me, like it's trying to make me think it's gotten all moody and confessional and I don't believe it for a moment. But the next song will be another celebration of dancing and flirting and making out and we can forget about all those troublesome real feelings again, and surely there is a time and place for that.
B00A1AD6ZU|2.0|I must have been reading a different book than everyone else, because I give this book no more than an unenthusiastic two stars.  Here are my reasons (only very minor spoiler alerts; I really tried not to give away any essential elements):<br /><br />My first set of issues may result from the fact that I've never read any other books within this series.  I bought it as a Kindle \\"Daily Deal\\" because the story-line sounded interesting, with espionage wrapped up in archaeology, conspiracy and intrigue.  However, the book (a) never really explains what the Sigma group is (other than some kind of government organization) and there is (b) pretty much no character development.  It may be that these are both covered at great length in other volumes, but as someone jumping in the middle, it was less clear than if one started to watch \\"Lost\\" in the middle of the second season.  Furthermore, if the Sigma-related characters (and Seichan -- I still have zero idea about who she is, why she is there, or anything else) were developed in other volumes, that doesn't explain the two-dimensional depictions of the characters that are new to this book.  They were stock caricatures ranging from the stoic, well-meaning Indian who knows how to stalk silently to the evil Frenchman.<br /><br />In any case, with regard to the Sigma personnel, I still have no idea who they are in relation to one another, and anything other than a couple of minor characteristics, certainly not enough for me to care if they lived, died, or were simply maimed.<br /><br />My second set of issues is with the storyline, which was downright bizarre and difficult to follow.  Don't get me wrong.  I really enjoy well-written novels -- and even some that are not so well written -- that are complicated and improbable.  I even enjoyed the \\"DaVinci Code\\" even though it was as far-fetched as can be, so that is not my issue.  The story in this one, was just nonsense, primarily because it was never clear WHY everyone, good and bad, was chasing around in the wild, scavenger hunt goose-chase (I don't want to spoil it by giving much more away).  And then it is over.  Frankly, it came to a point that I was hoping the world would blow up (this is not a spoiler, because obviously it did not if there are going to be sequels), because then we'd possibly have an interesting post-apocalyptic, dystopian novel to follow.<br /><br />Having characters span the globe doesn't make a great novel.  This is particularly true when they get involved in precarious situations, the resolutions of which are mighty suspect.  There are probably some interesting visuals for a \\"B\\" movie, but the elements seemed thrown together, and the story written around it, like \\"Hmm:  I want to write a book that involves Native American archaeology, a trip to Iceland, a Japanese super-collider, and a creepy French dude.  Let's see how I can link these!\\" Oh, and let's thrown in Mormon apologia, because maybe the snake-oil salesman Joseph Smith told the truth (sorry to offend any LDS out there).<br /><br />Why two stars and not one?  Well, I've read some really atrocious books, and this one is not quite as bad as some.  Also, there were some interesting themes which had potential.<br /><br />What astonishes me the most is that I finished this book.  I just kept wondering what I was missing, and how it is the product of a best-selling author.  There are so many better books of similar genres out there, I only wish I could get back the hours of my life that I lost while reading this book.bad, was chasing around in the wild, scavenger hunt goose-chase (I don't want to spoil it by giving much more away).

B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to use and the graphics are very good. A great free app!<br />I would buy more apps from this company!
B00A8KJN14|4.0|Got it used for a price i couldn't complain about, DVD has lite scratches but Blu-ray is perfect. No outer cardboard box or inside papers, but if all you care for is the disk quality then look no further. Also it got here in just 3 days! Can't complain one bit.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|However the application I wanted to use, Magic Jack does not work properly.<br />I do get it to dial and answer, but it only stays active for 6-8 seconds.<br />No time to figure this out yet?
B0060FXBNM|5.0|This is a great buy if you 1) don't own any of the Transformers movies on Blu-ray and 2) don't really care about tons of special features. Each movie comes in it's own regular-sized Blu-ray case. There is only one disc per case. All three cases come in a box. Great price for some great movies.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book was a great read.  Unfortunately, we lost a great hero when Chris was killed.  He protected so many of our soldiers while they were at war.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|After reading some of the negative reviews of this film, I was concerned that it would not be very good.  Everyone sees something different in this, and you will have to form your own opinion.  I think the story line was great, the acting was great, and the cinematography/sound/effects were great.  If you like swords and sorcery, or medieval themes, you will enjoy this one.  It's far better that anything del Toro has done in my opinion, and Kristen is perfect in her role as snow white.  Charlize Theron? No one can deny, one of the wickedest sorceresses ever portrayed in film.  And the unexpected twists in the ending are great.  Also, a great 'adult' conversion from Disney's frolic with the animals in the woods to Princess Mononoke, and a positive theme of light and nature against the forces of darkness.  Those who complained about the wicked darkness in this film may not have watched the second half.  The plot is not overly complex, but easily on pace with Game of Thrones and Lord of the Rings.  A very creative, excellent production of a classic fairy tale.  It was even better the second time I watched it.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|As always, Mr. Grisham does a great job.  Once I start reading his books - I just can't put them down.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I rally like this game so adicting and fun. also like all the theme ad the subway suffers go on tour.

B000NY12LO|4.0|I read this book as a suggestion from my niece. This book is an easy read with a great twist. I liked her writing style, so I plan to read more of her books.
B00AU2B0DE|5.0|Believe is an Amazing album but Believe Acoustic is even more Amazing, this kids got it. He can sing no doubt but he can also make everything he touches turn to gold.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Okay, first I never write reviews on anything. This book is by far the best book I've read in a looonnnggg time. Its a bout a girl named Hazel, who has thyroid Cancer that spread to her lungs, she is view by her mom as depressed and is forced to go to Cancer support group. She meets Augustus Waters, heart throb, blue eyed beauty. He is instantly attracted to her. I don't want to give much a way, but I can say that this is my all time favorite book! This book is witty, romantic, heartbreaking, a feel good book. I read this book in one day, stayed up til 2 in the  morning finishing it. Had a good cry while reading this, one of those ugly cry's, the ones that you hope no one ever see. I would recommend this book to anybody, and everybody. Good job John Green.
0307592731|5.0|I bought this on a friend's recommendation. It was a great and engaging book. Her writing style is different than I expected and she swears and is very blunt, so it's not for the very prim and proper. Fantastic book.
B004RLEBTY|5.0|From someone who doesn't listen to much metal... this group is awesome.  This album is second only to the videos that Red Fang makes.  Check them out on Youtube.  \\"Wires\\" is the song with the highest play count on my iTunes with well over 200 plays.  Sadly, it is followed by \\"We Found Love\\" by Rihanna.  Almost want to burn that track to a cd and purge it's existance from my computer then reimport it, just so none of my friends know I have listened to it over 200 times.
B004SBX112|5.0|Honestly, my 2 year old plays angry birds and I got this for her.  The music, colors and graphics seem pretty fun.  The game play is fluid and doesn't freeze.  my daughter likes it a LOT and that's pretty much all that matters.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this site. Facebook is getting old and there are too many problems with it. Pintress is an awesome site and all my friends love it.
B008BM9L72|5.0|Wow!I got lost in Christian & Anna's world,for a moment there I thought I was Anna *wink*.Fifty shades is delicious!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|it is on of my favoret games I have. It is fun for every one in my family. I tolled the people I know and that liked it to.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book is a must read! Couldn't put it down since the moment I opened it, I highly recommend it.
B002RKSZKI|2.0|This was one of those books I had a hard time getting into. It just didn't captivate my interest.  I did read it to the end only because I was curious about Emma and how it would end.  I remember very little of it and it is a long novel.  It took me 5 months to finish it.  I usually finish a book in a few days once I get started.  Also it was written in an Old English style and some of it I did not understand.<br />I would only recommend it to someone who likes the Old English writing style.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I am an avid Nicholas Sparks fan and this book didn't disappoint. Like all his books you'll need a box of tissue but every tear id worth it
B004SBQGHS|4.0|I'm not big on computer games, but decided to download this one, because of popularity.  I've played a few times to pass time and enjoy it.  My husband has become completely addicted. I guess my husband would rate it a 5.  I gave it a 4 because I don't like my Kindle being kidnapped. I recommend the game because it is easy to learn and challenging.  We have managed to complete the levels we played without making additional purchases.  I like that.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I could not stop reading this book. It pulls you end and you want more. I can't wait to start the next book
B000I174QO|5.0|This movie is as phenomenal as all the reviews give it credit for.<br /><br />Acting, character casting, story writing - all beyond superb.  If only there were more like it in artistic vision.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is a great game. I believe more games should be like this. one thing they could add in like a update or something is being able to breed horsew
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This game is lots of fun with fast action and  great sound effects. I get started playing in the evening and play past bed time. Thats when I dont like this game.
1451695195|5.0|I heard this offer on two different T.W. shows and was very moved to buy his book. I gave two books as gifts. Powerful TRUE story, especially for a neurosurgeon to write as a professional integrating his human and spiritual experience.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Very good read. Up close account about this war, from what seems like a humble but confident American. I appreciate the frank nature of the story.
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|Good game but was over to soon. Graphics were good. Enjoyed this game very much.<br />Would play it again. Would recommend it.
B00AU15HPC|3.0|I've been a big Moodies and Hayward fan since the early 1970's. My firstborn son is named Justin. This is Hayward's first studio album since 1996's The View From the Hill, arguably his best solo CD.<br /><br />The title of this review says it all about this CD. What a mixed bag!<br /><br />First, the Good: The CD clocks in at over 67 minutes. The first track is a nice up tempo number called In Your Blue Eyes. My favorite Hayward music is his ballads, and there are some good ones here, like The Western Sky, The Eastern Sun, Lazy Afternoon, and One Day, Someday (alternate extended version.) Why the CD includes another version of this song as track two is anybody's guess. The second version is virtually the same except for the extended ending. In the Beginning and On the Road to Love are okay. The CD is worth it for just these eight tracks.<br /><br />The Bad: Three country tunes, two of them rehashes from the past. It's Cold Outside of Your Heart was a throwaway when it first appeared on the Moodies' 1983 album The Present, and it's no better here. This is followed by a new country song, What You Resist, Persists, which might have been okay if not for the twangs. Then, Hayward countrifies his once beautiful Broken Dream from his last solo CD, A View From the Hill, ruining it almost beyond recognition.<br /><br />Now for the Ugly. Rising, a 23 second intro to Out There Somewhere, originally I Know You're Out There Somewhere from the Moodies' 1987's Sur Le Mer CD, only techno wrecked not once but twice in two versions totaling over eleven minutes. Why they are here is anybody's guess.<br /><br />If the best of this CD had been combined with some new songs from John Lodge, then I suppose this could have been fashioned into a new Moody Blues CD. That would have been much preferred to this.<br /><br />The tracks worth keeping, 1,3,4,5,6,7,11,12, come in at just under 37 minutes. Although much shorter, it would have made for a much stronger CD.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Had read it in school and forgotten what a good book this is. And it is free What could be better!
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|Somehow the original Google disappeared from my Android.  So, I downloaded this to replace.  It's okay, but not like the original Google application that I wish I could re-download!
B0074MZSWW|5.0|Loved all tracks. Puts me in a great mood when driving. Rich, nothing overpowering. Would like to see these guys live!
B000CNE092|5.0|Fantastic movie. Arrived sealed in the packaging and works great! Great deal for a movie I will keep watching over and over.
888370536X|5.0|She loved it.
030758836X|1.0|This book was highly publicized.  So, I felt compelled to see what all the hype was about. Unfortunately, I did not read any reviews prior to my purchase.  Started out a little slow but then built up to a suspenseful, \\"can't put it down\\" kind of  story with some very interesting twists. I was really enjoying myself and even advised my family & friends they may like to read it also.  Unfortunately, as it became closer and closer to the end,  my interest began to swiftly spiral downward. And, at the end of the book, I was so dismayed that I just wanted to scream and throw it across the room.  Absolutely one of the most massively disappointing book endings I've ever read. I will never purchase another book from this author as I do not ever want to feel this screwed (as in \\"to deprive of or cheat out of something due or expected\\") again. Couldn't call and warn my family and friends fast enough.
B003I55BIA|5.0|This is by far one of my favorite young adult books out there. No matter how many times I read it I always feel the same way.
0316056863|4.0|I'd rather watch her on SNL or 30 rock. It got laughs out of me, but there were kind of a lot of references to things I didn't know about and didn't really care about remembering.
B000JO9JHW|5.0|I got hooked, the show is very well written and the actors do a great job. I'm now a little obsessed...
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Very beautiful game. I have it on two laptops, but I kind of prefer the touchscreen over the mouse. It is extremely hard for me, and with a limited number of amounts you can skip a level, it is quite a challenge. However, I wouldn`t lower a game`s rating for that. I got it for free when I had Prime. I am not sure if I would have paid the full $4.99, though. The objective of the game is to stick goo balls together and build structures to get the goo balls to a pipe which sucks them up. When you have taken more goo balls than you need, the surplus is sent to the World of Goo Corporation, where you have to build structures as high as possible and compete with other people around the world (You see their name and country in a cloud which shows the height of their tower.<br />Verdict: If you like physics-based games, get it. However, make sure you have a lot of free time as the levels are hard. I am 13 and I kind of enjoy it, except for the high difficulty. However, a person ready to spend a good ~20-50 minutes playing each time you launch the game and is patient and creative enough to solve the levels without getting extremely frustrated will like it. Another great thing is that there are no In-app Purchases.<br />I really hope this review helps
1423140591|5.0|Once again my grandson was thrilled by this book. He loves all of Rick Roirdan books and I will definitely be purchasing more of his work.

B0058SNI94|4.0|Great Shoe but sizes are off:  1/2 smaller don't fit too small and 1/2 larger is too big.  Crocs are great shoes, lightweight and very comfortable.  Wish they came in 1/2 sizes.

B008LP8QE8|2.0|I have been reading this kindle book on an iPad. I was excited to trade the 2 volume behemoth for the slim iPad. However, i am very disappointed in the Kindle version. The book takes minutes to open. Once open you have all the same information as the regular text version of Harrison's.  There are also e-chapters which you can access if you are connected to the internet.  If you are reading off-line, you are out of luck for the e-chapters. The search function is essentially useless as it looks sequentially for the occurrence of a word or term.  Imagine you want to find the chapter addressing pain control. If you searched pain control, the results would show all the time pain and control show up. The search takes minutes to perform. You could look in the index, but the index is not linked to the page in the kindle book. Furthermore, the kindle book page numbers and the page numbers listed in the index are off by 400-550 pages depending on where you are in the book because of the roman numeral paginated beginning of the book and the blank e-chapter pages. You could look in the table of contents but of course there are hundreds of chapters...not exactly a quick scan. Luckily the table of contents is linked to the start of the chapters so at least that navigation is simple.  These issues are also present if I try to read the book via the Kindle app for Mac on my computer at home.<br />While the content is expectedly excellent, I would not recommend the kindle version at this time.

B00A4W3AJC|5.0|From the earliest days of cinema - from the small black and white projections that could astonish simply for the fact of their movement, for the sight of a moving body on the screen, to the massive 3d and CGI spectacles in which the performance is captured, fed into a computer and transformed, cinema has evolved, and yet has always depended for its capacity to fascinate on the power of actors, who transform themselves into the personas we witness and care about, fear or revile on screen, and then they disappear into some shadow realm, into a limo perhaps, to appear again before us on screen in yet another role, transformed. If they have lives in between, all that we know of them, really, is some juicy tabloid gossip, some bits of PR or bits that slip through the cracks. Do their roles rub off on them, do they form connections as they perform, does it impact them, do they carry the scars of the pasts they've portrayed? They stand up after being shot, rise again after death, but do they really, can they really, pick up where they left off when they put off the mask?<br /><br />Holy Motors, as I see it, examines and celebrates the history of cinema (from the earliest spectacles that played to amazed audiences to the CGI extravaganzas that barely faze us, we are so jaded) - but above all the film celebrates the power of performance and of a particular and highly physical performer (Denis Lavant) who, from other roles I've seen him in, appears to have no fear, who puts his body on the line, and whose performances always seem to blur the line between street art and cinema. The film bears witness to the oddity of the life of the actor - who is celebrated like the wealthy, but plays and becomes all things, rich and poor, young and old, lively and sick, on screen - and even while the performances become something timeless, the sequence of performances inevitably reveals a body that ages. Life goes on, cinema is eternal. Or is it? Are images seen on laptops and cellphone screens still cinema? At what point in its evolution does cinema become something else? I suspect that for Leos Carax, the director of Holy Motors, who has never shied from trying new things, what ties the future of film to its origins is, as I've suggested, the power of performance.<br /><br />The film explores the connection between cinema and life, on screen and behind the scenes, what happens when we blur the lines between acting and being, between life and performance. It also, I think, reflects upon the oddity of life, where we are, as it were, born into various roles we simply play out (badly or well) until our performance is at an end - what was it Shakespeare said about the world and the stage? The film also provokes reflection on the impact upon our lives of the technological changes that have accompanied and facilitated the development of cinema. It is no wonder that it is set in Paris, which can seem at once urban and provincial, is both intensely modern and aged.<br /><br />It's a lively, lovely, bizarre, unsettling film. Well worth watching.ens still cinema? At what point in its evolution does cinema become something else?

B008602KQI|5.0|This was nothing like twilight except for it's based on a science fiction story book....and that's a good thing, believe me.
B0079KGAOY|2.0|I got the blu ray versions because in AMAZON's description for the first lethal Weapon it clearly says it is the DIRECTORS cut of the film.. but it is NOT the directors cut at all. while its great to have it on blu ray, I feel the wrong listing screwed me over because I would NOT have got this if I knew it was ONLY the regular version.<br /><br />This is the listing on the item description of the Lethal Weapon Blu ray Collection, as you can see it was copied write from Amazon description and it SAYS directors cut.....But it is not...Buyers beware if thats what your looking for it is not here... I will just have to be content with my old DVD directors cut version so yes...I know what I am talking about when it comes to the directors cut. The description goes on to talk about the seven minutes placed BACK into the film as the directors cut including the sniper in the school yard scene...so this is a GROSS error in the description.<br /><br />Amazon.com<br />The explosive and edgy Lethal Weapon introduced America to its favorite modern buddy team: Mel Gibson's suicidal firecracker Martin Riggs, a Vietnam vet whose reckless stunts earn him a reputation as the Los Angeles Police Department's least desirable partner, and Danny Glover's aging family man Roger Murtaugh, a veteran detective who wants nothing more than to gracefully live to see his pension. Richard Donner's smash movie is sleek, stylish, and practically nonstop action, but it's the chemistry between the combustible energy of Gibson and the paternal reserve of Glover that makes this combination so lethal. A sequel was inevitable, so Lethal Weapon 2 sent Riggs and Murtaugh after a South African drug syndicate, tossed funnyman Joe Pesci into the mix as a comic foil, and upped the ante of explosions, car chases, and apocalyptic property damage. Kung fu-kicking Rene Russo signed on for Lethal Weapon 3, a &#34;mad genius run amok&#34; adventure rushed into production without a finished script (and it shows in sloppy ad-libbed scenes) and crammed with wild high-speed chases and spectacular explosions. When Lethal Weapon 4 hit screens in 1998, the starring cast had ballooned: hot comic Chris Rock joined Gibson, Glover, Russo, and Pesci to take on a Chinese counterfeiting and slavery ring led by Hong Kong martial arts superstar Jet Li. Director Richard Donner helms every installment of his series, topping the frenzy of action and pyrotechnics with each new feature; watching the arc of the Lethal Weapon franchise is like a crash course in American action cinema of the '90s: bigger, faster, louder. Yet at the heart of every film is Riggs and Murtaugh, mismatched partners who become unlikely buddies, ready to lay their lives down for one another. By the climax of Lethal Weapon 4, as they team up against the fighting fury of Jet Li, their friendship has become the defining drive of the series. --Sean Axmaker<br />Product Description<br /><br />Lethal Weapon (1987): With over seven minutes of previously unavailable scenes, the director's cut of Lethal Weapon is a long-overdue present for fans. Riggs's solitary homelife and the tragic loss spurring him in a reckless disregard for his own safety now come into greater focus. We see that recklessness is new scenes underlining the differences between the two cops. Murtaugh, just 50, needs reassurance about his skills at a firing range. Riggs, not caring if he sees another birthday, coolly walks into a schoolyard sniper's field of fire. All the humor and adrenaline that made this original an entertainment milestone are here, too. No scenes have been removed. But new action and new insight are now included. Include yourself in the excitement.<br /><br />Lethal Weapon 2 (1989): Riggs wows the pretties of a hotel spa before getting to Getz. Murtaugh receives bad bodywork news from an auto repairman after his beleaguered station wagon sees some Riggs-piloted street action. Plus, feisty Leo shares a newly included scene in which he recalls a suspect's address by complex spins of numbers that, well, no one can tell it like Leo. And no one would follow his lead but Riggs and Murtaugh. It's police procedure, Lethal style. And it's yours to enjoy as the duo draws a bead on criminals hiding behind diplomatic immunity.<br /><br />Lethal Weapon 3 (1992): Riggs and Murtaugh are back again. This time, they must stop a former cop who has become an arms dealer to L.A. street gangs.<br /><br />Lethal Weapon 4 (1998): Mel Gibson and Danny Glover return as buddy cops Riggs and Murtaugh, with Joe Pesci riding comedy shotgun as chatterbox Leo. Murtaugh is still the family man. Riggs is still the gonzo loose cannon and - what's this? - family man. His will-he/won't he marriage to Cole (Rene Russo) is one of the new wrinkles in this powerhouse crowd-pleaser that also stars comedy favorite Chris Rock and international action star Jet Li. This sequel involves an action packed battle with a Chinese ganglord.spect's address by complex spins of numbers that, well, no one can tell it like Leo.

After several years trying locate al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden, her<br />work finally pays off in 2011, and a US Navy SEAL team is given the go-ahead by President Barack Obama to kill or capture Bin Laden.<br /><br />Much of the film’s tension comes from Maya trying to convince her doubting colleagues that Bin Laden is where she believes him to be.<br /><br />Bigelow’s movie is also controversial in its portrayal of extreme interrogation techniques and the fact that Maya, albeit reluctantly, believes that these techniques are necessary for success. zerodarkthirty-movie.com<br /><br />As reviewed in the March 2013 issue of An Cosant&oacute;ir (The Defender) The Irish Defence Forces Magazine by Sgt Wayne Fitzgerald - dfmagazine.ie - military.ie

B007MU85D0|5.0|I first listened to this album with the song \\"Of Monsters and Men\\" on VH1's top Video's when my wife mentioned how beautiful and genuine the smile of the colorful protector character was at the end of the video. I then listened to the song and the lyrics carefully and they are so touching. I don't usually review music as it's so subjective but the lyrics to that song touched me and this album is so worth listening to that you absolutely will not go wrong in purchasing it. Music, with few exceptions, has gotten so predictable. I like artists with real talent like Bruno Mars, etc but I can't get enough of this music. If you are unsure, purchase \\"Of Monsters and Men\\", close your eyes and just listen to every word and make your decision. You will enjoy it and be happy that you added this to your collection. Happy listening.

B00A8LYYI0|1.0|Probably one of the worst horror movies in a long time. The graphics were awesome, I'll give it that, but the storyline was crap. Everything was rushed, they met, were almost killed, fell in love and ran away together, then were willing to die for one another all in less than 48hrs. The acting was almost as bad as the storyline and to be honest the only ones you want to live are the monsters. I would never recommend this to anyone, not even as a cruel joke.

B000002AGB|5.0|At its very core, Rock Music should be astoundingly loud and extremely nasty...it should sound like the speakers are about to explode and the amps are about to catch fire, and the guys in the band should sound like candidates for a straight jacket...in \\"Live at Leeds\\" and again at \\"Live At The Isle of Wight\\", The Who did \\"loud and nasty\\" better than any rock band before or since.<br /><br />This concert can NOT be appreciated with headphones, or listening over little computer speakers on a Sunday afternoon.  To understand what this concert is about, you need to find a friend with a couple of speakers the size of refrigerators, powered by a 1,000 watt amp.  You need 30 or 40 people who have been drinking more than they should until past 3 a.m.  Then, crank this CD up to the max...so loud that the walls shake...so loud that any neighbors within five miles call the cops.<br /><br />Got it?  An ocean of booze...1,000 watt amp with smoke coming from the back...3 a.m...walls shaking...floor vibrating...that is what rock music is REALLY about, as played by The Who.  Have your bail money ready.<br /><br />The Isle of Wight banned rock concerts for over thirty years because of THIS performance.  \\"Live At Leeds\\" presents The Who at their very best...\\"Leeds\\" was a performance when every member of the band was in prime condition...\\"Isle of Wight\\" sounds like four guys who have not slept in a week...who have been surviving on whiskey and pills....about to fall off the stage...\\"Isle of Wight\\" is a loud, nasty mess...the very definition of rock music.
159514188X|5.0|Have you ever wondered if your actions, no matter how small or big it is, had impact on other people? Well this book will make you reflect about it specially on the crucial times of being a student.<br /><br />We all know that in school there will always be those people who will be your friends and who will be the \\"douchebags\\". I don't know everyone's history on school but I think this book will affect you in one way or another. Why did I say that? Because I was.<br /><br />I already know that this book will be an emotional one even before buying it. I read the synopsis and said to myself I should prepare myself. Now it's just a matter on how much toll it will take on my emotions.<br /><br />So we are introduced to 2 main characters here on the first few chapters, Clay and Hannah. You will not be spoiled, Hannah committed suicide as said in the description. The only question is why? What are the events that made her decide to end her life. That is the whole point of this book. Clay discovers who, what, when, where and why did she made that decision. And Clay is included in the reasons, he just doesn't know why.<br /><br />Thirteen Reason for Thirteen People.<br /><br />The way Jay Asher told her story through cassette tapes us quite unique. It makes that part feel organic in a way. His writing style in this book quite honestly is a little bit confusing at first since the POV of Clay and Hannah is constantly alternating so you need a little bit more concentration while reading. But it totally works, it creates a dynamic between the alive Clay and the non-existing Hannah anymore.<br /><br />What I really like about this book is the lesson it teaches us. It makes us wary of are actions in the past and maybe the actions we will do in the future. It makes us think how we interact to other people and say to ourselves \\"Is what I am doing wrong or right?\\" It questions are actions.<br /><br />The simplicity of the story which is grounded in reality and also the fact that it really happens in our society (young or adult) makes this book one of my favorite among all the books that I have read in my entire life.<br /><br />I highly suggest you read this book but I warn you prepare yourself  emotionally.really happens in our society (young or adult) makes this book one of my favorite among all the books that I have read in my entire life.<br /><br />I highly suggest you read this book but I warn you prepare yourself  emotionally.
B000QRIGJY|5.0|I chose this book for much the same reason I used to read Travis McGee novels.  There's a certain similarity to all crime novels; this particular series is short on sex and misses a lot on police procedure but remains entertaining. If nothing else, the frequent allusions to LA streets and geography remind me of The Californians on SNL and that's always humorous.

0694524786|1.0|Michael York overly emotes so that, for instance, Peter is always shouting and Lucy talks softly. I am constantly adjusting the sound volume. This is a great book, but it is exhausting and annoying trying to follow Michael York. I wish the producers had modulated the volume. I do not have this issue with any of my other audio books. For a contrast, try Christopher Timothy's reading of James Herriott's &#34;All Creatures Great and Small.&#34; Timothy also does a dramatic reading with different voices, but the volume is reasonable and the voices are plausible. I get the impression York was trying to treat reading &#34;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&#34; like a Shakesperean stage production. It is overblown.

B008JFUMT2|4.0|Another great Die Hard movie with Bruce Willis still kicking xxx.  Most of this movie takes place in Russia (or what is supposed to be Russia).  Protests in Russia are going on over political prisoner Yuri.  John McLain gets word that his estranged son John Jr. has been arrested for killing someone and is in a Russian prison.  Of course, John takes off for Russia just as his son and Yuri are  being taken into the courthouse for trial.  As you might suspect, they escape and John takes off after them.  It is an interesting movie and even takes them to what is supposed to be Chernobyl later in the movie.  Of special interest was the absolutely amazing car chase scene, probably the longest one I have ever seen.  They really went all out on the stunts.<br /><br />OK--Yeah--It was severe BS. I mean, going over to Russia and doing all the typical Die Hard type stuff seemed a bit unbelievable, BUT, that's what makes a movie fun.  Nobody wants to see something ordinary.  You want to see the impossible odds getting overcome.<br /><br />With that said, the movie was pretty much non-stop action with lots of stunt work and busting up things and kicking xxx.  Lots of fun for the action junkie.  I plan to get the DVD as soon as it becomes available.
B008220D7S|5.0|My husband and I saw this New Year's Eve and neither of us could keep from laughing the entire way, even when it was hopelessly sad what was happening in this marriage.  Most people who don't &#34;get&#34; this film just aren't in the age/marital bracket necessary to have a frame of reference.  But there are so many truisms in it that single people simply can't understand I can see why they would be confused instead of entertained.  So far, my favorite film of the 20-teens.

0375869026|5.0|Recently, I've been reading the book, Wonder. And as sad as it is, it is such an amazing book. The main character, August, has a deformed face and is trying to get through the hardships of middle school for the very first time. He's making it through with very little friends to accompany him, and the ones that he does have are always pestered to ditch him. It's a tempting offer that they just ever know what to do about.<br /><br /> August is a very nice boy but no one is able to see past his face to get to know the funny, understanding, and kind August that his family sees. We would recommend this book to people who like reading about hardships that they can relate to.

159514188X|5.0|Thirteen Reasons Why is based on a girl named Hannah Baker. She committed suicide and nobody knows why, except for 13 people, including Clay Jensen. Hannah left 7 cassette tapes that were to be passed around to the 13 people, and only the 13 people. The whole book is based on one night, when Clay gets through all the tapes. He doesn't know why he's on the tapes, and he's scared to find out. I think Jay Asher did a really good job finding the personalities in each character. He captured everyone's emotions in every scene. I found the book hard to put down. I'd suggest this book to people who are looking for a romantic mystery.

0547848412|5.0|How any self-respecting reader could expect to contribute new and meaningful thoughts to the almost 4000 extant reviews seems both daunting (and perhaps a bit foolish).<br /><br />It was only after the attention \\"Life of Pi\\" garnered in the Academy Awards that I unearthed a copy of the book that had languished on my bookshelf for a couple of years---and proceeded to read it over the last two days.<br /><br />I do not feel I can add anything to the many lyrical reviews that exist but felt obliged to chime in that I adored the book and agree with numerous other reviewers who call it magical, enchanting and significant on a variety of  levels. Yes, I skipped some of the gory, bloodier bits involved in life-and-death survival but thought author Martel did an amazing job with language that captured every nuance of such a fantastical voyage.<br /><br />As a non-religious person, I initially wondered about the inclusion of the multiple belief structures but found them instead a wonderful addition to the fable.<br /><br />The writing was excellent and kept me engaged for the entire ride...er...sail.

B005IQZB14|3.0|I picked up this book with the expectation of reading a memoir that would allow the reader to glimpse into the unexpected discoveries, both psychological and life-changing, gleaned while Ms. Strayed hiked the PCT trail.  We learn some background information about Ms. Strayed as she takes us back in time to help the reader get a sense for what prompted her to embark on this journey.<br /><br />In her early twenties, Ms. Strayed experiences a personal tragedy (the untimely death of her mother) that sends her on a downward spiral of destructive and dangerous behavior.  We soon understand that her mother was really the glue that held the family together.  Without her mother the rest of the family essentially comes unraveled. The lack of family support from her siblings and step-father only worsens the problem by not providing her with the stability that would have helped her cope with this loss. However, many of her problems are self-perpetuated and of her own doing.  She becomes involved with a heroin addict and, subsequently, becomes addicted herself.  She also engages in unprotected sex with multiple partners and not without consequence. Despite being married to what seems like a pretty decent guy who cares deeply and supports her more than the rest of her remaining family, she still pushes him away and continues on the path of self-destruction.  I was a little disappointed that we don't get a sense of her emotional state as she deals with these difficult situations.  I think having a better perspective on what her internal dialogue must have been like during these moments would have given readers an important understanding of who she was at that time and how these early-life events compelled her to make changes.<br /><br />The book is structured so that most of the flashbacks are revealed as she's hiking the PCT.  The trail narrative mostly consists of her day-to-day means of surviving the hike: worrying about having enough clean drinking water, constantly fighting with her incredibly heavy and over-filled backpack, worrying about the possibility of a run-in with a snake or a bear.  It becomes apparent almost immediately that Ms. Strayed is very much unprepared for long-distance hiking: disparaging with the advice of the sporting-goods store employee who tells her to do some practice hikes before-hand, overloading her pack, constantly struggling with her too-tight boots, and underestimating the mileage she believes she can cover daily.<br /><br />What we don't find out as she's hiking is, again, this lack of inner-dialogue and self-discovery.  I think there were many opportunities where we could have become emotionally involved as her earlier harrowing experiences certainly are of interest to the reader.  How did she get off heroin?  How did her sexual experiences affect her and how did she reconcile those behaviors with her marriage ending?  Knowing how she approached these struggles would have added to the narrative.<br /><br />Another aspect of the book that I found problematic was that Ms. Strayed made this trip in 1995, yet the book wasn't published until 2012.  Yet her narrative covers her journey in minute-by-minute detail and what occurs during her long hours on the trail and what happens off it when she's setting up her tent for the night.  She goes into very specific details of what she eats, what the weather is like on a particular evening, the book that she's reading and even what she's thinking about on any given day.  These passages are rather extensive and detailed, as if they had just happened days ago, rather than many years ago.  She even recalls all the encounters and detailed conversations with other hikers that she met on the trail.  But even these encounters with fellow hikers seem to be superficial, as they don't add much weight to the story.  She learns how to better pack her bag and rids herself of unneeded equipment and gets a few tips for hiking a particular section of the trail.  But again, the interactions with these folks don't seem to add any significance to the story and they become mostly anecdotal.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the book did not come to an entirely satisfying conclusion, there wasn't really that moment of having arrived at a significant epiphany that you'd hope for at the end of this journey.  It just seemed to end abruptly with her stopping at a particular point, getting off the trail and rewarding herself with ice-cream.  Huh?  Given that she spends so much of the book describing the small minutia of the day-to-day hike, I was rather surprised that she leaves the most important questions answered.  It is her intention, at the onset of the hike, to use the time to come to grips with her difficult childhood and her mother's death, and to consider the end of her marriage and all the weighty questions that have troubled her.  The reader is left with this tremendous gap of how she went from being in a troubled, confusing place in her life to getting herself together and finding success and happiness years later.  It's hard to say exactly what she gleans from her journey (other than to buy hiking boots in the correct size and don't overload your pack).  I would have like to see the narrative less focused on her evening ritual (which didn't vary much day-to-day) and more introspective on how it affected her emotionally and psychologically.  The day-to-day routine loses its meaning when there doesn't seem to be clear purpose behind it.  The trail doesn't always connect us to the greater story (essentially the point of making the journey) and the reader becomes more of a passive observer than a participant in her endeavor.  Many times I didn't feel connected to it and didn't feel as invested as I would have liked.  The ending left too many loose ends and open questions that could have been addressed more effectively. It's almost as if she needed to hurry up and finish the book.  I think the conclusion could have been handled better; instead, it just felt very abrupt and sudden.<br /><br />I'm really not sure in what category this book really belongs.  It's part auto-biography, part adventure memoir.  But considering that Ms. Strayed did not originally undertake this hike with the specific intention of publishing a book about her journey, I'm sure there were a number of liberties taken while writing this book.  I appreciate that Ms. Strayed ultimately completed her journey and overcame many considerable obstacles.  Though it's an enjoyable read with Ms. Strayed's easy, conversational style of writing, I think it falls short on what it attempts to achieve.  Simply put, she doesn't show the reader how the trail changed her, how she learned from the experience and hardships nor does she connect her past to the present.  We have some understanding of how she became \\"lost\\" but little connection is made to how the hiking experience actually helped her to be \\"found\\" again.ractions with these folks don't seem to add any significance to the story and they become mostly anecdotal.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the book did not come to an entirely satisfying conclusion, there wasn't really that moment of having arrived at a significant epiphany that you'd hope for at the end of this journey.

B0075MFS9Y|5.0|I love the sound of this group, especially the upbeat tunes.....  Hope to see them in concert some day!  Love them!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|It is wonderful, soothing and a blessing to have. Have problems turning the head off at night & with different combinations which is also great you can customize your own sounds. A great thing to have.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Probably the best James Bond movie so far. Fairly gripping story with close and intense fighting scenes. Very clear picture & sound. Very nice soundtrack. Sets up well for next film. This film takes the action up a few notches and sets the bar so much higher. How will they top this in the next film.<br />A must have for Bond fans.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I would love it if I didn't have such a hard time getting it to start on my kindle fire
B0065AVS0K|3.0|Had to watch this film for class. I think the idea of the film's production itself was a success, but the story and certain elements were contradicting and didn't make sense. I think the acting was good overall.  It's just not my kind of movie.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|It is all the songs that were sung in the movie.  And sung by the performers that were in the film
B000HAB4KS|5.0|Had to watch this film for class. The action in this film, plus the story, was really thought out. I think the production aspect of this film was very impressive, and I think this film sets a high standard.
B003VANOFY|5.0|All around great headset.  Awesome sound good bass, great for gaming. I would fully reccommend this to anyone thats looking for one
B009X01GJ2|1.0|It did have nice colored leather so I gave it one star.  It was heavy.  It had no pockets to hold a wiping cloth or loops to hold a stylus or pen.  When I put my kindle in landscape mode, I had to be very very careful or if I tilted it the wrong way, the tablet (still in the hard plastic protector inside the jacket of the case) would flop face down right out of the jacket!  Good thing I was using it on my bed!  I've since read that a lot of people have had to use tape and velcro to get the hard plastic part to not flop down out of the jacket.  For this price... I didn't feel I should have to do that so it was returned.
B001V9LPWQ|2.0|I've loved this movie since i was a kid, and I want to get this for my son for his birthday coming up. (he's going to be 3) My question is why in the hell is it 60 stinking dollars ???! I wish I could go see it in Imax and it still would be cheaper!! What's the deal?
B00AFEXRME|4.0|Fans of Denzel Washington will not be disappointed with his performance in FLIGHT but their expectations of what the movie is about may not be met.  IMO, FLIGHT is a perfect title for the movie because that in a nutshell is what it is about:  one \\"would have been\\" mid-air catastrophe if it were not flown by the experienced pilot, Whip Whitaker, with an outstanding 30-year career as a commercial pilot in denial about the cause and effect both in his career and personal life due to his drug and alcohol addictions. FLIGHT as in an on-the-job pilot high on alcohol and drugs; FLIGHT as in the movie's theme of one life ending plane crash diverted by a pilot everyone labeled HERO who finally had to come to terms with his addictions and the consequences of his choices.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|The GrandKids love this movie.  They got it in the mail.  The movie is great.  No problems wha so ever with the DVD.

B0002KZAKS|5.0|I purchased 2 of these mics and they are just the best in my opinion and the members of my band.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|My great grandaughter picked number of stars.....she is 6 and enjoys playing the games and is good at them. Eventually I will have to buy her more.....she is so competitive.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is fairly entertaining. As a horse owner it's pretty fun, although it would be better if there were options to do different events. Put some RODEO on there and this app will blow up! =)
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Had not seen the first two seasons so I purchased them on Amazon.com.  Love the series!  Was so happy to be able to purchase Season 3 and not have to wait to see the episodes on PBS.  Highly recommend the Downton Abbey Series.  No one will be disappointed.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I thought the ending was OK. It's hard to accept any ending of a book you just don't want to end.
B007N85POS|5.0|Everyone loves this App.  My granddaughter and I play this together, sometimes over FaceTime.  When we hear the music we know what the other is playing.  We have so much fun with this.  Keep on creating those Angry Birds....
B004FEFS5E|5.0|I'm no hotshot or pro, but a home enthusiast.  I have the book version of the older edition, and bought the 3rd edition kindle version to share with my 12 yr old, and for the all new HDR chapter.  I do own a DSLR, but also use a bridge type cam, p&s etc. which do have some control over features too.  Appreciate that its an easy read, and totally loved it while I got started with this hobby of photography.  He may not use all the terms but I didn't feel it was condescending, but instead appreciated all the different analogies so that you understand exactly what it is you are going for.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Oh, I will have to watch this again to get everything.  This movie is like Vanilla Sky, you have to really pay attention, but it is worth it.
B008476HBM|5.0|This is a classic English literature, so it has a fairly complex vocabulary and indirect way of communicating that is not quick to read. I certainly expanded my own vocabulary in reading it.  The story itself has sufficient twists and turns to be quite enjoyable.<br />I definitely enjoyed this story.  (And you can share it with the kids, as there's no sex or profanity in it.  Whether they'll understand the nuances of phrase or not is a separate question...)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|If you do not have this Bible app for your iPhone or tablet, you need to get it and subscribe to a daily devotional that helps you make time for your Christian daily Quiet Time.  Yes, Yes, Yes.  This one is the BEST!
B007KDFWRG|5.0|Great CD!  I saw them play live in New Orleans a couple years back....they are amazing!  This CD in particular is one of my favorites.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Everyone needs this app on their electronic devices for reading different documents that pop up.  Great tool turned into an app.
B0074JOCIG|5.0|I absolutely love this DVD.  I saw him live at The Grove, and he was incredible.  This DVD is well worth the purchase, I've watched so many times I've lost count.  Quality is very good.
B005LAIIRQ|5.0|Great movie!!!! Liam Neison is a bad ass (as always) If I remember correctly theres no sex or cussing (could be wrong) so it would be okay for older children. It a bit violent though. I love the man vs nature story line. It's something you don't see to much these days. Simple plot line, no frills entertainment. Just pure masculinity.
B004T4KQJS|1.0|I found that the idea presented by the author is really rather simple and short, but he spends so much time repeating it over and over again. Not sure why so much space was devoted to critique of creationists. Very poor cosmology book. In this day and age, he should have blogged it out.
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|I have just about every version of Jane Eyre ever made. This one I happened upon while watching cable television one evening. After watching it, I had to add it to my Jane Eyre library. Instead of following the story from the beginning, the story begins with Jane running away after her failed wedding to Edward Rochester. Then goes into a flashback. This beautiful romantic tale will not disappoint.
B00ADQPB50|5.0|I love how every episode packs as many surprises and turns as a whole season of anything else, brilliant writing , acting (jessica Lange), and direction, have to collect.<br />Can't wait for season 3.
B003EYVXTQ|4.0|The book is so much better but this is a good movie.  I wish it had stuck to the story a little closer.  I know everybody always says the book is better, well true in this case.  Still if you watch the movie you get the jest of the story. It is worth your time to watch.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|When I first started to read the book I wasn't sure if I wanted to read more. I didn't know what the future of our lives may contain. And then it soon reached the point where you can't put it  down.
B006X5L6VS|2.0|This is an intriguing app but it's very glitchy. I have this on my Kindle Fire. If you move the sky around (as one should be able to do) the app shuts down. Disappointing.
B00BIQU1K4|5.0|Great work!!<br />Improves with every listening. Recommend using good headphones (mine's a Bose noise cancelling one),lie back,preferably in a dark room with no distractions and concentrate on all the layers of sound..if you can fathom the depth at once that is (lyrics are secondary)...gets better every time I listen to it...<br />All that said.Fantastic album!!<br /><br />(Aside, and a fervent wish --hope SW with all his versatility and talent shows die-hard PT fans some mercy by re-gouping PT to release atleast one PT album per three solo projects!!! PLEASE!!???)
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I didn't realize music could sound this good!  I am amazed at the clarity and the overall quality of the sound which these headphones provide!  This is probably the best purchase I have ever made in my life!  I feel these headphones are a real bargain under $100 when I consider the cost which I have spent on all the music I have downloaded and purchased over the years, because now I can really enjoy listening to all this music which I love and it feels like I'm in a recording studio!  Everything sounds tremendous on these headphones whether I am using them on my iPhone5 or my PC.  I recommend these to anyone who loves music because these headphones are a bargain!  I also like the fact that you can buy replacement parts for these if you need to down the road!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is the best game I've seen.it's new and addicting we are looking to find out more about the great game
B008JIWNYG|4.0|I have never been a great green lantern fan, however I know the general stories and characters.  This story arc is entertaining and engrossing.  It doesn't shatter any molds and and is somewhat easy to guess what's going to happen next.  Overall I would recommend to a friend.
B0000AM6IY|5.0|This movie is as great as it was when it first came out for viewing. Great actors and just an overall great movie for all ages!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is probably the 8th time I've reread The Hunger games! It is very well-written and always leases you wanting more when you put it down!
B009HEJXFS|4.0|Good addition to the legacy.  I liked it.  Good plot, acting, concept.  Not my favorite of the bunch but I'd recommend it.
B0058RN85O|5.0|i love this show. it cracks me up. it met every expectation i had. me and my wife watch episode after episode and then rewatch them. great purchase
B0090EHVMC|4.0|This was a good movie.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Can show this to kids (unlike Cat in the Hat) which was crap and way too adult for kids.
B00APUQRPC|3.0|I'm not a big Clint Eastwood fan, nor Justin Timberlake. But even I was disappointed with Eastwood's performance. How can a old, crabby actor blow playing the role of an old crabby baseball scout!!<br /><br />Timberlake cannot act to save his life. Their relationship (w/ Adams) was bland and extremely predictable, eventually ending in sex--what else???<br /><br />However--enter Amy Adams!! Amy is sweetly stunning as Eastwood's daughter who just wants loving acceptance from her steely father. Adams plays the twisted feelings of loving/hating her dad, wanting to have nothing to do with him and yet that natural, deep desire to be close to him! Adams' performance isn't dazzling nor striking--but sadly the director nor script require her to perform that way. Very disappointing. Maybe the easy-going script attracted this very talented, multi-Academy Award nominated actress.<br /><br />For me--the movie has NO substance worth seeing unless, like me, you adore the work of Amy Adams! The ending is very satisfying because how her character ties in. Easily the BEST part of the movie--as endings should be!
B004UIOUHC|4.0|Not my favorite, but it works.  One of the apps I needed to make a secured site work.  Four stars.
B003YBNRHU|4.0|Doobie Brothers - World Gone Crazy (Eagle)<br />It's like punk never happened. The Doobies started out as a serious Californian rock outfit, with plenty of great tunes custom built for singing along to whilst traveling life's highways (and tarmac ones, too). In the late `70s, with Michael McDonald on board, they hit the middle of the road with a more AOR sound, and that's the sound they've returned to on \\"World Gone Crazy\\". It's not a bad record. The better songs, \\"My Baby\\", \\"Don't Say Goodbye\\" (with McDonald on vocals) and \\"A Brighter Day\\" stand comparison with their classic earlier material and even Willie Nelson turns up on \\"I Know We Won\\". 7/10.
B009KHCT94|3.0|This movie was not what I expected.  I have to give it props for concept and special effects and some acting, but I both loved and hated this movie.  So, when you do the math, that equals three stars.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Well there's really not much to say. It runs everything I throw at it without any problems. I haven't tried overclocking it yet mainly because I don't have to with it's super fast clock speeds. This is probably the best CPU for any hard core PC gamers. The integrated GPU can run just about any game but I'd recommend getting a dedicated GPU to play at higher settings and take some of the stress of the CPU. Using just the stock cooler I idle at about 40C and about 50C when playing Guild Wars 2 at max settings.<br /><br />My Build<br />Case: CM Storm Enforcer<br />PSU: XFX Pro Series 750w 80 SIlver+<br />CPU: Intel i5 3570k<br />GPU: XFX Radeon HD 7870<br />RAM: G Skills Sniper 8GB 1866Mhz DDR3 Dual Channel<br />Storage: Samsung 840 250GB SSD<br />Western Digital 2TB 7200RPM
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Not a perfect movie, but the concept is great and the acting is good and so I'd recommend watching it at least once.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|Rhonda Bird does again only this time she helps you to understand the little things to be grateful for.  To many of us go through our daily days taking things for granted.  The magic puts things in perspective.
1451683405|3.0|Hmmm, any discipline whether theology, philosophy, mathematics or physics or a host of others (you pick one), because all originate with the human mind, depends on some indemonstrable human premise.  (Especially that of history.) Free will it seems to me is a concecpt dominated by several \\"human\\" disciplines.  This book did little to convince.  Lot of of the  posts here accuratly reflect the problem of \\"language\\"  -- Rarely do any of us possess the vocab to accurately communicate the precise feeling we possess about complex topics such a free will.  And even less often will our words be accurately understood by another human being.  Still, I believe all books have value and have moderate recommendation for this book.

B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Works exactly as the original, which I left behind on vacation.  When ordering replacement cords for electronics, I'm often worried that the replacement is a cheap knockoff, but that's not the case here.  No problems at all since this is from Amazon.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Totally addictive and increasingly challenging.  I have it on my kindle and have it with me all the time - it's perfect for short breaks during work, long car trips or relaxing at home.  In the arcade mode I've opened all 3 worlds, but now am working on getting all 297 levels within each world - It just seems like I can't stop until I make it!
1616550414|5.0|I got this book yesterday and fell in love. From the timeline, to the concept art, to the pages dedicated to each game, this book is a must have.
B00AH8U4OW|5.0|Yes, I think it's better than Hung, SOA, Weeds, and all the rest.<br /><br />Just wish I didn't have to wait until the season was over to get all of the episodes!
B009YQJ322|5.0|Finally somebody in the film business gets it right. Don't look to Hollywood, thank Peter Travis and writer & producer Alex Garland. The helmet does not come off, EVER! Full of great one liners and special effects, at times the blood looks a little fake, but I'll settle for that and a excellent overall project. Looking forward to the trilogy!<br /><br />MoPop
B009AZZEU2|5.0|This is one of those albums you end up playing all the way through..not a bad one in list.<br /><br />The band seems to hit their stride about track 4 ..then you hear sounds we remember from years ago, the heavy loping grove with dark lyrics and deep meaning.<br /><br />If you love Soundgarden buy this album. However, don't expect them to sound the exact way they did 15 years ago. While the mood is similar the album is well produced and mixed and not so raw and grating as loud love or bad motor finger.

I give something a try because people are so neg.  do not get this game! if you love to restart games over again. go for it. but seriously the company needs to relook into this game and fix it. yes 4 stars intill you loss all your data in the game goes down to 1
B0098460O4|5.0|I used to like Andrea Boccelli and Sarah Brightman, but I found their voices got too much repetition in my mind.  You know when the song is repeated over and over in one's head.  This albumn places beautiful songs in my head because most of the songs are duets and sung beautifully.  I love this albumn much more than the AB's and SB's CDs!  Together is so very uplifting.  Jonathan's and Charlotte's talent compliment each other. Their singing transforms the selected songs into  treasures for the heart and mind.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I've never been disappointed by a John Green book. Even though this book had it's sad moments, it was still written with amazingly real emotion. The characters jumped off the page and I found myself so fond of Gus and Hazel as real people. I'll still be reading Green 's books when I'm old!
B005USZYDU|4.0|I thought it was an amazing book full of details. And I always love a good mystery with great characters.
B0006VBFM0|1.0|I gave my wife a Swatch for her birthday, but it proved an extremely ill-chosen gift. Within a year, the protection glass fell off. The sales women told me that my wife should not close the strap tightly, because that could damage the watch.<br /><br />The replacement watch lost its hour hand in a matter of weeks.<br /><br />Swatch: great marketing, terrible quality.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book gives great insight to what really happens in war. This young man was  a true American hero doing what his country asked him to do. Protect his fellow soldiers. God bless Chief Kyle and his family.
B004F27I3Q|5.0|It is so nice to here this type of music . That sounds so old school , some may think has been lost . If you enjoy the deep sounds of old school heavy metal this is for you . I heard a ten second clip for a channel break a couple of years ago and knew i liked for just that . Great CD .
B001NLKWLW|4.0|This was a good story and I quite enjoyed it.  However I had a bit of a problem with the character's names and remembering who was who and would need to back track a few times....probably my problem with comprehension.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|I deleted this after a few days because it took a very long to to load every time I attempted to play it then crash immediately after it finished loading.

B005M4K94G|5.0|This is my favorite Santana disk, and with the remastered version it's better than ever. The original was pretty noisey and the mix was a little off, but this version is way better, not great but much better. Go get it!
0062238868|1.0|I so wanted to like this book.  Alas the author comes across as a unidimensional bigot who enjoyed killing.  He seems neither interesting nor likeable. This is a disorganized screed with no real unifying narrative.  Don't waste your time.
B008220DGE|5.0|This film plays more like a fevered dream than like realist history,<br />so people expecting some sort of conventional narrative may quickly lose patience with this movie. They may also be missing something special. In addition to being glowing symbols more than they are conventional characters, neither Freddie Quell (Jochain Phoenix) or Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffmann) is especially likable.<br />But the performances suggest emotional and historical truth in ways that are often moving, without pretension or sentimentality. Freddie Quell is a figure of the American male id, post World War II: violent, sensuous, insatiable. He's driven to drink drafts of American industry to quench his burning: the fuel of torpedoes, the fluids of photography, institutional cleaners, all mixed with the fruits of the earth. Dodd, \\"The Master,\\" is a new-model super ego who might tame and direct Quell. Dodd is smug as a baronial magnate, as full of literary pretensions as Tom Sawyer; his resolve is borrowed from his steely wife (Amy Adams).<br />Hoffman's Dodd, contrary to rumors about the film, is not a charismatic, psychological autocrat, but is wounded, defensive, and dreamy. He lives out a fantasy of priestly insight and command, but few people really believe him; he gets the benefit of many doubts. As Quell is drawn to Dodd's fantasies of mind over history, Dodd is drawn to Quell's energy and chemical inventiveness. Together they suggest different means of achieving atomic-age versions of the old American goal of obliterating the past and standing alone in a new present. They also suggest the polar tensions of raw animal desire and magisterial fantasies of triumph present in many American men. Quell's desire to consume, dominate and love the earth (Quell is obsessed with a woman sculpted in sand) meets a rhetoric of platonic self-mastery in Dodd.<br />The preposterous incongruity of the men and their desires does not result in a drama of control and exploitation, which audiences may expect, but in inchoate attempts at mutual understanding in several scenes that, if not more humanly intimate, are yet more dramatically resonant than most sexual episodes in movies. The 70mm \\"real film\\" photography in this movie is amazing; many of the film's strongest moments, including those with people, are wordless. An irony of the film is that lush and magnificent nature (the Pacific ocean, the Arizona desert, the San Francisco Bay) is often overlooked by Quell and Dodd in their self involutions. Nature in American writing often becomes a symbol of self; the oceanic and desert shots sometimes suggest the roiling interior energies and ideal spaces of these two men, but they barely acknowledge these colossal, external realities. But lived, human nature may have the last word, in an ending that is unexpectedly funny and tender. I rate this as one of the best American movies.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|I am surprised that Hollywood created a movie with such a powerful message about damaging personal habits. Very powerful. Denzel Washington is awesome in this role.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I wanted a bag that would not just hold my canon and gear but that would also hold other stuff like my Flip Camera, my small Nikon, my mp3...my stuff. This bag is perfect. It is large, fairly well padded. The straps are good and the waist band very comfortable. The price is good as well. My only complaint is it has NO STYLE...just a black backpack. but that doesn't effect its purpose.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Mark Watney is stuck on Mars. No problem. His intelligence and handyman skills combined with a never-say-die attitude leave you to believe he will make it, he will survive, he will somehow be able to return to Earth. Take a chance, don't let the technical potato farming bog you down and stay with Mark for the duration. It's a story worth reading.
0525951652|5.0|I just finished reading this book for the second time and feel just as strongly that it deserves 5 stars as the first time that I read it when it originally was released. Follett does an amazing job of delivering enough information to fill a history textbook through the conduits of characters so interesting that you do not realize how much you are learning. His characters are complex and realistic, which of course means that they are not all likable. By having a cast that includes families in Great Britain, United States, Germany, Austria, and Russia, Follett is able to give a thorough explanation of the diplomatic failures that led to World War I, how so many countries ended up involved, and how it was finally ended. He does not simplify matters by making all Germans evil or all Americans heroes. They are all people who may or may not fully believe in the cause they end up fighting and sometimes dying for. Several romances also are woven into the story, though Follett's sex scenes are always my least favorite part of what is otherwise a fabulous story. I was somewhat disappointed that he did not maintain a strong Christian point of view for any of his characters. Though two of the main characters are raised in a strict Christian home they fall away from their faith for reasons that aren't satisfactorily given. I was especially disappointed in the development of Billy William's character into someone that I found rather unlikable, but that's the real world . . . I don't have to like all the people in a book for me to accept that they can be that way. The book is filled with sad and sometimes chilling quotes regarding the future and avoiding any other war of this magnitude, and I am anxious to get started on the sequel, Winter of the World.
B00004WKII|5.0|If your a Hendrix fan, you will enjoy this set. Only a few song's were flaky or poorly remaster. Most are great, and different tune's of same song's not herd before.
1423113454|5.0|...is that I always learn something interesting. It is like a history, mythology, and geography class all rolled into one. But the best part - I learn without even realizing it. I found Riordan through his extremely popular Percy Jackson series. That is a tough act to follow, but I think I am actually enjoying this new series even more. Egypt is fascinating!<br /><br />As a child, I was always drawn to myth. I still remember studying the Greek and Roman gods in class and learning their names by heart. The stories continue to enchant me so I already had a good background when I started the Lightening Thief. However, with a few minor exceptions, (Isis, Horus, Osiris) - I came into the Kane Chronicles with a limited understanding of the Egyptian counterparts.<br /><br />Riordan did not leave a single detail to the imagination. He nailed his research and flawlessly mixed documented information on Egyptian life and beliefs with his fiction. I also love the conversational style of his writing. Sadie and Carter are believable as brother and sister and their banter is reminiscent of most sibling relationships. The use of two POV's is executed without a glitch. I never felt confused or distracted by the differing narrators.<br /><br />The book itself is non-stop action and fun! We follow Carter and Sadie as they discover their ancient bloodlines and family history... and of course fight to save us all . There are most definitely lots of mishaps, surprises, and near-death experiences with the gods and goddesses along the way. And magic. Did I mention magic? Carter and Sadie learn a lot about themselves and each other in this adventure... and make some very tough choices. I really enjoyed this book!
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Love the color, durability, affordability and the way it perfectly does it's job of protecting my kindle in a beautiful case. Definitely recommend.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great game.  I think it is actually easier than the first one. WARNING this game is EXTREMELY addictive.  Have fun.
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|This is a little different. Normally games like this you want to move the guy around an environment trying to collect things like stars and things. With this, you move the environment to get the sleepwalking guy to his destination. It is unique, fun to play, and surprisingly challenging. A great way to kill a little time as each level doesn't take too long to finish. I think it is well priced at a dollar.
B00ADYYBFI|5.0|I love the show and all of the songs they perform on the show.  There are so many songs to pick for the soundtrack but these are all great.  My person favorite is Wrong Song, showcases both &#34;Juliette&#34; & &#34;Rayna&#34; (Connie Britton & Hayden Panettiere). If you are a fan of the show, definitely get this! If you aren't a fan of the show, this may make you want to watch!
B0000067L2|5.0|I was young when album was released. great album acid rock. My 2nd best pick is the album with &#34;In a white room with no curtains.
B000002J0B|4.0|Being the kind of person who doesn't follow the crowd, I enjoy a musician's effort to take a different path. Led Zeppelin could have rehashed Zep II forever, and there are some fans who apparently wish they had (see one star reviews of any LZ album after II). Instead, LZ put out albums like III, Houses of the Holy, and In Through The Out Door. And that's what makes them what they are.<br /><br />Houses of the Holy is one of those \\"stretch\\" albums and it's also one of the finest. HOTH captures a time and place like no other in their catalog. The band were spending a lot of time in LA - it was almost their home away from home. The first song on the first side (for you vinyl freaks), The Song Remains The Same, contains the line \\"California sunshine, sweet Calcutta rain\\" which pretty much describes the rest of the album. The quick transition to The Rain Song is one of the best in all of rock, and whenever I hear Song Remains The Same I *expect* to hear Rain Song immediately after.<br /><br />The stretch songs are D'yer Mak'r (as we Yanks say \\"Dyer Maker\\"). Yes, Bonzo just cannot get the reggae beat right, so he plays it as a straight rock beat. But the song works and bounces along with the sunny attitude that pervades the album.<br /><br />For those who are not familiar with James Brown, they won't get The Crunge. Here, the band tries funk! And even humor! If you don't get the \\"I'm just trying to find the bridge\\" joke then you really need to get a James Brown compilation and count how many times James calls out for the bridge (\\"Take it to the bridge!\\"). In music parlance, a bridge is a connecting section of a song in contrast to the first section leading back into the original section. Listen for this in popular songs. And one of the funny things about James Browns' songs is that \\"trying to find the bridge\\" is sometimes a challenge! Hence, the joke..... get it?<br /><br />In case you forgot that John Paul Jones is a master multi-instrumentalist, he gets his due in No Quarter, a song that became a cornerstone of their live performances. The song is what Jack Black described when the band received the Kennedy Center Honors - \\"Songs about Vikings. Songs about making love. Songs about Vikings making love.\\" Jones' keyboard work is excellent, and fans who think the band rises and falls on Page's guitar just need to get a life.<br /><br />Oh, Page is still in these grooves. Over The Hills And Far Away is often described as Stairway the Sequel, but it can stand on its own. Page delivers excellent acoustic work in the intro. Dancing Days is a very upbeat song, but still delivers a punch. And if you're looking for some Zep crunch, it's right there in The Ocean.<br /><br />The most important feature of HOTH is the introduction of Page's layered guitar production that would be fully realized on many cuts on Physical Grafitti. Page must have felt that one riff per song was not enough, and he packs several riffs into one song and layers them one on the other. Some of those riffs could be the seed of a song of it own! \\"But if you listen very hard, the tune will come to you at last.\\"<br /><br />HOFH is one of a handful of Zep albums I return to again and again because of the variety, the sunny quailty of the songs, and even the humor.arter, a song that became a cornerstone of their live performances.

B007SYWFRM|1.0|I have this on 1st gen kindle fire &amp; android phone. 2 different experiences. Works fine on phone. Game on Kindle is a nightmare. So many bugs: Cant complete certain goals because items dont exist; can add friends on Gameloft Live but they never show up in game; cannot send gifts (it says they are sent but friends never get them); havent received gifts since last year (even though friends say they send them); when visiting friends villages I do have, it is painfully slow, often locks up the game, or just throws me back to main screen; no kindle update available for new 'dino world' and about a dozen other problems I'm too lazy to list here.  Sheesh...complaints all over the internet too with little to no response from Gameloft. STEER CLEAR OF THIS FOR KINDLE.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is a twist on Mahjong, but it works within a 3D sphere. I actually stayed very entertained with this for hours. First I beat the cube all the way through but then there is a mode where it grows... I cannot seem to beat this. I don't even know if you can. But I can't select the tiles fast enough to keep up and, before I know it, the cube has built itself full. I'm finding more of a challenge on that, trying to speed up and get ahead of it.<br /><br />While I did enjoy it, original Mahjong still holds my attention the most. But this is a fun alternative if you want to mix it up a little bit.
030758836X|5.0|I listened to the audiobook, and the narrators were beyond fantastic! Julian Whelan BECAME Amy and Kirby Heyborne IS Nick. I can give no higher praise.<br /><br />This book is so much better if you go into it without knowing anything other than one basic fact - Nick's wife Amy is missing. That's all you need to know so try not to read plot summary and reviews (yes, I see the irony). The story is told from alternating point-of-views of Nick and Amy. It goes on about their lives and what happened leading up to the disappearance & what happens after. But, as with all marriages, things aren't always what they seem. And Gilian Flynn - she's a master/ a mistress of teasing out a story ... giving us a slow buildup ... and then BAM - hang on suckers because we're about to get own & dirty into the real meat of the story. It levels off for about a second, and then BAM ... again, and again, and again. And guess what - the characters are so damn UNLIKABLE! That's right, I hated myself for liking one over the other but, I couldn't stop listening to the audiobook. It was intense, and insane
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This is one of Nicholas sparks best! Touching in every aspect. A love story for all relationships. Your heart will be sad & happy.

B001ANSSDC|4.0|This book takes you on a wild ride and flips you all over the place so you can have an idea what it is like to have a mental condition and need medication to get by.  I hope Bradley Cooper does a good job in the movie version, I heard that he does.
B009LT1YZ6|4.0|I'm generally not the biggest fan of motion/tilt games, but this one is one of the better ones. It is a lot like labyrinth, except instead of a ball you have a fish and the walls and holes you have to avoid are moving. But, this games seems a lot more responsive than labyrinth in that the fish generally does what it is I ask it to. I'll have to give it some bonus points for that, often times the things I'm trying to control with my accelerometer tends to do things I don't intend, and this fish actually did what I wanted it to do. The graphics are really basic. I think it earns the one dollar it is asking.

B0032KLAKE|5.0|super movie, very good and exciting, just an all time favorite that you will enjoy for a long time to come
B0094K1MH2|5.0|My 10 yr old son LOVED it!!!  My daugher (8) also loved it, eventhough she was a tiny bit scared in some parts.<br />This movie is a gem.  Glad we discovered it.  Even great for adults.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game addicting and super fun. Don't want to putmy tablet down! Make sure to get it because it is on of the best games I have played
B004XQYBA2|5.0|I rarely think games are worth more than a dollar. Usually I try to weigh how long a game can remain entertaining (replay value) and how well they are put together and compare that to other games you can play for just as long for a buck. I think you would be rather hard press to actually finish all 10,000 levels of this game and I think the engine is put together quite well. This is easily my favorite Sudoku game so I not only think the $2.50 they are asking for is justified, but I would have been okay with the idea of paying even more for it. This is worth every penny. That is, if you like Sudoku. If you don't like Sudoku, stay away... this doesn't add anything to the game to make you change your mind. But if you do like Sudoku, then I can't recommend this app any more.<br /><br />But gameplay is very fast on this. You can add little notes in the boxes and playing with the numbers is very intuitive. Getting this game is causing me to refuel my old Sudoku addiction (just when I thought I could go clean).
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This sharpener has worked very well for me. Also light and easy to carry. I bought a knife on amazon and it has yet to be useless for me with this sharpener keeping it nice and sharp.

B000OCXI3K|5.0|I almost didn't read this book because of some of the bad reviews that stated it wasn't written well and was boring and had bad character development.  Hmmm.  Well, I found it to be one of the best books I've read in a long time.  In my opinion, those that hate the book object to the main character, Vianne's, attitude toward the church (thus missing the whole point of the book).  She states from the beginning of the book, she doesn't believe in the established church, but she feels there is room in the world for everyone, whatever their beliefs.  This is a timely tale about bullying (yes, even adults can be bad bullys!)  It's a tale of tolerance in a world full of divides.  It's about how people can get so caught up in their fervent belief systems, that they lose touch with humanity, and become short-sighted to the point they think everyone  should have the exact same worldview.  (That's all belief systems, not just the Christian church.)  The prose is absolutely gorgeous!  Joanne Harris is a master of prose, much like Barbara Kingsolver, another favorite author of mine.  It sends the message that life is for living and not a perpetual funeral.  Yes, bad things happen, but so do good things.  We all have the strength to face life head on and come out alright in the end.  It's about what your focus is.  If you are determined to be unhappy, you will be.  It's part coming of age, part modern morality play, part study of life.  If you liked such books as She's Come Undone, The Help, The Bean Trees, The Mill River Recluse, then you'll like this one.  I'm a voracious reader of all books from classics to modern fiction and this is one I recommend very highly!
B007REV4T8|5.0|Excellent movie.  5 stars, no question about it.  Between the clever and exciting action sequences and the highly layered and detailed storyline, it's difficult to point out any flaws.  A lot of people are going to be excited about the movement towards a more familiar bond that begins to appear in this film.  At the same time, he's still the same &#34;beat everyone up with your bare hands&#34; kind of bond that Daniel Craig has really created.  Better than Casino Royale...hard to say, but definitely right next to it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|What a great app it is I love playing it and it is very fun<br />It ha  great features on it and it is fun and easy to play.you should play this app because  you will like it

Another plus is that every month or so you Getty new themes like New York, Rio, Rome, and many others!! There is even a Christmas theme!! Hope this review help you :)

B000XXTCF8|1.0|First off, I want to make it clear that this one star review is not because of Van Morrison or his music.  Van Morrison is awesome, but I can't believe that every song on here that is remotely popular is \\"album only\\".  I got it in my head that I wanted to hear \\"Domino\\", and I wanted to hear it real bad.  Until I went to get it on my phone and saw that the only way I could buy it was to buy these other 20 songs that I really don't want to listen to that badly.  Then I notice that every other song on here that is popular is the same way.  I really don't appreciate the blatant attempt by amazon or the record company or whoever to manipulate me as a consumer.  So I don't get to hear the song when I want, and amazon loses a sale.
B009738XXM|3.0|I'm not Carley Rae's target audience but the infectious &#34;call me maybe&#34; hooked me anyway. Unfortunately it's the only song on the album that did.

I recommend people to get 4 core instead of 6 core if they are on a tight budget. 4 core is good for most everything and 6 core gives you that extra Omph! I cannot find anywhere that has a better deal for this processor.<br /><br />Highly recommended<br /><br />Update<br />9/12/13<br />Still works great. Had no problems overclocking to 4.0 ghz. I can play all games at maximum graphics with acceptable frames. Cooling is great not ever going above 120F.
B008YWY0HK|3.0|The movie, Brave, was very well made.  What was lacking is story line.  I watched it with my grown daughter<br />and we both liked it.  But we agreed that the story line, while an important one, was much misplaced in this<br />movie. Lovely movie but cartoon-ish in story line.  Too bad. The good thing, we agreed, is that we didn't spend the<br />going rate of approximately $15.00 each to see it in the theater.  We really wanted to love this movie, but the<br />best we can say is that, all told, it's okay.  We will save it for it's visual beauty for her baby to watch when he<br />gets older and the story line, while it could have been told better, is still a valuable one.

B00005OBSD|5.0|I remember Free from their early 70's hit single \\"All Right Now\\" but there is so much good blues here. As another reviewer remarked \\"Going down slow\\" alone is worth the price of admission. Speaking of \\"Going Down Slow\\" if I had heard it without knowing it was Free, I would have bet it was \\"Humble Pie\\" circa 1972.
B007FH9GT2|5.0|Highly entertaining, though is a bit long.  Part of a trilogy, so you ought to read all three.  The author died after completing the third book so there won't be any more.  It also tells you a lot about how things are done in Sweden, which is super.<br /><br />Highly recommend<br /><br />P.S.  The movie of this book was terrible.  After about 30 minutes, we turned it off.

B0055PGUYU|4.0|Fascinating case studies and scientific information to explain how famous people and companies create change. A great motivator if you are looking for a read to inspire you.
B005USZML4|5.0|This book may be aimed at the young reader, but I found it just as absorbing as all of John Grisham's books.  Very good story, which I really enjoyed.
0425252868|4.0|I purchased this book for my husband for Christmas  --  he read it in a week and said it was an excellent book.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It wasn't until Amazon that I decided to check out this series.  I am hooked! I loved it and can't wait for next season.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This is not the first time I've read this book. It's not the second time I've read it.  I love the meat of this book. It's not a short book. It has plenty of entertainment value.<br />I love the way Patrick writes. I love the third person perspective he wrote it in. I can't wait for his third book to come out. I suspect I will read this one again when it finally arrives.
1401322786|3.0|I got this gift for my wife and she loves it. Says it was a really good book that sucks you in.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game rocks!!!!! It is soo  adicting cant stop playing it buy itttt amazing game recomend playing it really cool
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game, I'm on it for hours!! The only problem with it is that there are  times when it will Allah, hence the 4 stars. But other than that it's pretty awesome!
1439152802|5.0|Kate Morton has a unique way of telling stories from the past,and the present, that excites me as it develops mystery, clues , and answers, all at the same time.  So many friends and reviewers said that the ending was shocking.  Being a real mystery lover, I did figure out the 'surprise' very shortly into the book.  But interestingly enough, I think that Kate Morton's writing is so exquisite, that confirming my suspicions a little more with each chapter, actually greatly added to my joy while reading this book.  Every time something happened, my first thought was of how cleaver this story was unfolding!!<br /><br />The basic plot was simple enough. A young girl witnessed the shocking episode of her mother killing a man who showed up at their home.  It was ruled self-defense, and the child was asked to keep this event a secret from her siblings.  Sixty years later, as all the siblings gather for their Mom's 90th birthday, and final days of her life, questions and new answers are discovered.  Love, friendship, WW1 War time bombings in England, and families broken apart all added to the fascinating truth of 'the secret'.<br /><br />Kate Morton never fails to please!!
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Such an awesome series--certainly recommend to anyone and everyone! Season one is suspenseful, exciting, and addicting!! After starting the first episode, you will want to clear your calendar for the weekend until you get through the entire season!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This series is one of the best I have seen. This is a story about a wealthy family in the early 1900s that everyone will love. Very similar to the original &#34;Upstairs Downstairs&#34; that was popular in the 1970s, the Downton Abbey saga features a larger household and staff. Personally, I like the &#34;Upstairs Downstairs&#34; series better because the smaller household brings a closer family &#34;feel.&#34;<br /><br />Without spoiling the season finale, I must say that I was disappointed the way it ended. If I were writing the beginning of the fourth season, I would begin with a dream scene that corrected an otherwise horrible situation for the family.
B0075MFS9Y|2.0|I normally like folk-y kind of music. This, not so much. Most of the songs just droned on and on, leaving me completely not interested. I tried listening to the CD again, since so many people liked it so well. I wanted to like it, I really did, but I just couldn't.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is one of the best games I have played!!! it is so much fun and it's addictive! !!! I really recommend this game
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|This is a good product.  I bought it for my wife's kindle fire and she likes it.  Not bulky, not heavy.  It does the job.  How it will holds up over a year or two remains to be seen.  For $15 (or$16) I'm willing to take that chance and replace it with another if she still has this Kindle.
B002GHIPYI|5.0|When I received this I noticed its cheap packaging and stiff construction and didn't expect much. But as soon as I plugged it in I was blown away at the rich bass and clean treble and comfort yet solid build. I compared the audio quality to a $299 Bose noise canceling headphone and these sounded better as far as pure audio. The downside is they do not fit around the neck when you take them off and they don't fold up. Otherwise as a pure listening experience I would highly recommend these and give it 5 stars just for the audio dynamics.
B008MM9630|5.0|I play often!  maybe 2 often just wish you didn't have to wait so long for more energy otherwise great game!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This series is one of the best I have seen. This is a story about a wealthy family in the early 1900s that everyone will love.

Personally, I like the &#34;Upstairs Downstairs&#34; series better because the smaller household brings a closer family &#34;feel.&#34;
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|fit right on my Kindle Fire, and is really helpful protecting it while on the go! I recommend this to everyone for a smart, inexpensive, investment.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|A book they makes you look within your heart and accept different people, different family dynamics and the patience to understand people that have experienced a different life than your own. Written in such an eloquent and enticing manner. And the flowers are an incredible bonus
B00A3XWAU2|5.0|How can anybody not like the song \\"A little Rock N Roll\\"??<br />I love this CD, reminds me of Bad Company and Paul Rodgers.<br />Or even more recent, Black Country Communion
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So easy to play, but so difficult to put down. Probably one of the better free games available on here.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|Bought this for my husband and I and it is now the favorite game of my 4 year old son!  Lots of fun for hours on end.
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|This is a great movie! The story is superb, the acting is strong and I really wish I had not waited so long to see it. I highly recommend this movie to people who love a good story. The MMA aspect is just the back drop. Similar to how boxing is a backdrop for Rocky. It helps with the story, but it is not a movie about MMA fighting.
B0007Y89ZM|5.0|I surprised my husband with the Eagles DVD's for Valentine's Day.  He really likes their music and I think it is his favorite DVD now!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Excellent story and writing.  Kept me engaged throughout, even though both main characters were despicable!  Well worth it.  She is a great author.
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|Season two of Haven is an excellent sci fi show. It continues the twists and turns of all the weird things that happen there. There are more hints of things from Audry's past that keep leaking out and making you want to know more.. Great show!!
157421327X|5.0|Good basic start to learn Zentangles.  Plan on doing it with my artistic 10 year old grandson.  He will do the drawing and I will scan onto fabric to make a quilt for him.
1416583432|4.0|I bought this book for a friend who wanted it and he has enjoyed reading it. I will probably borrow it from him.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|ok this game is the BOMB I liv this game I played it on my best friends I pod ALL the time!!! :) I JUST LUV LUV LOV!!!!! :)
1452110581|5.0|I got this for my Cat Lover husband and me,not so loving, and we had great fun.  So I got one foe my Mother and he liked also.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Do I really need to say anything about this?  It speaks for itself!  I was able to view the whole seaon 3 before it finished on T.V. here in Utah!  However, I will say, the ending is disturbing.  Lots of questions arise from this particular ending.
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|Solve my business class calculation problem. Excellent price and excell well to solve my calculation problems. Nice piece of equipment.
B004WGIXX4|3.0|It was just too silly for me.  I skipped throught most of it and saw that it had a happy ending.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like this game because of the monkey that looks like all the little five monkey combined. I also play on my free time at school or home. I'm in love with game. I can't wait for Temple Run 3 to come out on the Kindle Fire.
B005LAIIA8|5.0|9 yr old daughter LOVES it.  it's her #1 movie. it goes on trips & to friends & she loves it.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|I love this Cd/soundtrack and I love the movie/ My husband and I have watched it multiple times and will watch it more times
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I ENJOYED reading this book!  I saw all the movies before reading any of the books, so as I was reading I could see the characters in my mind, which made me enjoy the books even more!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The graph ic content in this video game is absolutely fantastic! The team's necessary are very accurate as well. I'm really pleased with this game.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I dislike but am greatful that this game has a limited play time. It is easily addicting for puzzle fanatics like myself.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Help, I love this game but I can't seem to get the Rome update.. the Rio update worked easy enough... anybody??
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Omg this is the best book I have ever read!!!!!! I have all ready read this 4 times and I still love it!!!!!!
B0088P2A7A|5.0|I like the idea of being able to look a singer, actor, spots person, etc. up and it tells you about the person.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Fantastic. There's a great variety of puzzles. It's challenging. And it keeps track of your completion times. It provides hours of fun.
B0031RS7X6|3.0|Typical Sophie Kinsella. Easy reading, no big surprises. Twelve more words required apparently. Can't think of anything else to say.
1401322786|4.0|I loved this book. I found it a jewel that's going straight to my collection. The story of Dor and what he goes through touched my heart. The thing that is the most important, more important than the time that he creates is the love of his life Alli. It only takes him thousands of years to finally realize it.<br /><br />The themes in this book showcase that despite our technological advancements, we have forgotten the precious commodity that we already have but neglect: the simple things in life. I always say it and I know others do as well: I wish I had more time. This book reminds me that I can have it if I just reflect on the small, simply things that are already in my life that make time irrelevant. My family, my friends, that special someone. These need to be cherished because they are the precious things in life that stick around no matter what happens.
0375703764|5.0|Book wasn't for me. I bought it as a gift for my son. It was just what he wanted at a fair price.
B007DCHZ6U|5.0|The chorale I am singing in -- The Cape Fear Chorale -- is going to be performing the Suppe Requiem.  This CD has helped me enjoy and appreciate the Suppe Requiem with its beautiful varying movements.
B00ATU5JRA|2.0|I Tried it but to many things to down load. Fills my kindle space up.Heard it didn't work anyway. Got rid of it
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love books with happy endings. I would highly recommend this book.like the one that is only a matter of the most important safe haven
B00AEKFLOQ|5.0|After browsing around for a while I came across this item for a decent price. I am very satisfied with my order. The delivery was very speedy and the item was brand new just as described. Very pleased
0553582453|5.0|The story of Fitz and the Fool continues with this well written book by Robin Hobbs.<br />I can't get enough of these stories!
B002SSUQFG|5.0|This watch has a nice weight to it and it looks nice. I have puny 6.75 diameter inch wrists so 75% of the (decent) watches on amazon don't fit me but this watch looks great on anyone who has smaller then average to average sized wrists. You do need to wear the watch for 8 or so hours a day to keep the time piece momentum thing going (I am not a watch wiz) so if you leave it by your bedside for a day or so you will need to wind it up to the correct time and date. The day of the week indicator also displays days of the week in Spanish. Anyway for the price of the watch it's well worth it if you asked me I was contemplating on buying a cheaper watch but I figured that 300+ reviews with the majority of them being 4-5 stars, you can't go wrong. This watch is a great watch and it comes in different colors too, the prices are also different I believe this black 809 model is more expensive then the green or blue one.
B008VBYN80|4.0|Good graphics fun game would be better if you didn't have to build with crystals that you have to buy with real money
B005IDXIL2|5.0|Love this game and since I can't bowl anymore because of knee problems , I. feel like I'm really bowling.
0205313426|4.0|Haven't needed to even open the book yet, but it looks great and I love the author! I expect I will keep the book for my own personal library.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|I was disappointed in the novel overall. Had some thought provoking ideas but not a strong interesting read. I'll hesitate before buying another work by this author.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|It is so hard to find a good movie without magic, vampires, witches or other demonic influences that a family can view with their young children.  This fits the bill but is very sad and heart-wrenching.  Most youth should be ok but may need some discussion to acclimate it to their lives without fear.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I believe this was the author's debut novel and it is great. I laughed out loud (Dartb vader!) and cried. The characters are well developed and I liked that their feelings were expressed through the poems. Awesome book! There is a sequel but it can stand alone too. No cliffhanger. Definitely read this!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This is a pretty simple item but I was impressed by how well and how quickly it put a nice edge on my knives. It isn't fancy but it's sturdy, and the diamond rod is great for serrated blades. Nice sharpener to throw in a backpack or leave in your truck. Great value.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Fun overall. Creates an effective sense of dread. A bit overlong and concludes more weakly than expected, but still a good read. A little history, a little science fiction, and a lot of suspense. A romance in every sense of the word.
B00BHU9DUK|3.0|I like the book and like some of this movie.  But I did not care for the 'stage' format it was filmed in.  I was really disappointed mainly because of the background.  It would have been so much better if we could have actually seen more of Russia and its beautiful landscapes.
0812981448|5.0|I am working on a business that I am launching this year and this book showed up at the perfect moment. It was inspiring with all it's stories of people pursuing their dreams. It was helpful in that Blake gives insight into his business building process and gave me hope that I am not off my rocker and can really make a go of something that will make a difference in the world.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great app 2 have...the large display is easy 2 see and use. I've had it for a while now and it never freezes nor has it ever crashed!! THANKS DIGITALCHEMY 4 MAKING THIS CALCULATOR....BY FAR THE BEST OUT THERE!!!
B00AFEY354|5.0|I loved this movie.It portrays coming-of-age stories by so many different proectives and shows that even the &#34;Beautiful People&#34; are not immune from insecurity. It was recommended to me by someone else who has the book on their required reading list for High School Literature. It definantly should be. It's that good.
8866130931|5.0|Moleskin planners are classy, thin, and colorful. They come in a variety of choices and also host a great selection of notebooks. I became a fan of Moleskin planners many years ago and continue to be one now! Happy writing ツ
B009GIPDQS|4.0|The kind of con story that makes you fall in love with the anti hero. Grisham know his laws well
B00B2DSIAI|4.0|My daughter really likes this movie and in HD it had great graphics.  Fun to watch and I had to laugh about some of the old games that I saw that were out in the 80s
B005VPRDAY|5.0|My grandchildren love to play with these toys and it keeps them busy when they come over to visit for the day.
B00BESM14U|4.0|Really enjoyable movie about coming of age in the early 90s. I watched it with my girlfriend on a quiet night in.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I love anything that Susan Boyle records, but will always<br />remember her singing I dreamed a dream.  this item was received promptly.<br />I would recommend purchasing on-line.
1554681723|5.0|If you have ever owned a Labrador Retriever (THE ULTIMATE DOG!) you will certainly appreciate this book.  It is written from the point of view of Enzo a yellow lab mix.  This is not a light read.  It gets very involved and most people will get very emotionally involved with the plot.  The ending will have you thinking about it for days...  If you only read one book this year THIS IS THE ONE!
B000I3W1XS|4.0|I give The Search for Spock 3.5 stars, as it's not as good as the previous film (Wrath of Khan), but it nevertheless entertains. The Klingons are in full force in this one, with some tacky fight scenes. I'm not being negative here; sometimes tacky is good. The story is an interesting one, centered around the resurrection of Spock, while conflict erupts over the Genesis device. Overall, this film is a worthwhile watch.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|My husband and I both love this series and cant wait until season 3 comes out on digital!  So off main stream and great landscapes.  It really brings you into the story
1616550414|5.0|I give this five stars because I love how they are so detailed with the pictures/arts and how they arranged the games in the order in which they did. We all know deep down that most of the games were made without the intention of some day putting them in a timeline. That's what surprises me about this Historia. Somehow they managed to arranged them in a way that makes a lot of sense and I'm looking forward to seeing more Zelda titles that would fit in between the current ones.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|One of the best auto-bios I have ever read. If you had the chance to see him on Stars Earn Stripes he real was a humble guy. His recent death is a great loss to our country.
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|kinda stupid.  i would't but another, if part two came.  save your money.  can't wait until i get my twilight saga 2
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|I love Peter Pan it's such a classic Disney movie and looks great in Blu Ray! My children love this movie as well!
B009E9QOEO|5.0|That it took such an occasion is a shame and may you rest in heavenly Led Zeppelin peace, Ahmet Ertegun.<br />This is just a blast !<br />Rock and roll the way it should be and probably never will be again (short of one more tour !)<br />We, who knew when we needed to push those speakers to that next level, and knew we were in the presence of Rock and Roll,were lucky.<br />I am afraid that it will never be again...that grandness that we were a part of and so many are still chasing today.<br />Thank you to these three and ,in the the proud shadow of the fourth,Jason, for bringing back the hammer of the gods.<br />May we all go out in such a grand style.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I enjoyed the story thoroughly.  It seemed to be a quicker read because it had non-stop action.  A very good book and fitting end go the series.  I am just wondering when the next movies come out.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|He def put some major thought into this one.  It begins to pick up very quickly unlikle some books where it takes a while for something good to happen  highy recommend for history lovers and sci fi lovers.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Incredible character development and suspense<br />A Masterful storyteller of a terrible time in our country's history.<br />Please stick with it through the tough parts.  It is worth it!
B004GCPJDQ|2.0|I have purchased two of these products with the same result. I agree with some of the other negative comments like the poor fit and finish but the real deal breaker for me is that the batter pack life in both cases was less than a year. I am a software engineer by trade so this device gets a lot of daily usage (frequently more than 8 hours/day). I would still expect better rechargeable battery life for the price though.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|After trying all the free Sudoku games months ago, I chose this one and just never got around to buying it - until now.  It outshines the others by far.<br /><br />Not only is the game well thought out, it is the only one that was able to teach me how to play (many others didn't even have help, much less instruction on how to play).<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and try it, you'll not be sorry.  If all apps were this well written, android would be a much richer experience overall.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game for kids and adults. But it does get addicting. You play three times and you are sucked into it. Other than that it is an amazing game.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey is brilliantly done.  The character development is extraordinary, and you find yourself feeling as if you personally know these people.  The mingling of the storylines of staff and nobility is exquisitely put together.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best game that I have ever played! I accomplished my goal of beating two million in under a mounth and now I have overexceeded that goal by almost a million!! Best game I have had since temple run#1!!!!
B004XQYBA2|5.0|Tons of puzzles, game handles very well with a very intuitive interface.  I normally stay away from sudoku apps because they're usually awful by design, but this is one of those rare exceptions.  Well done!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Im starting to get the hang of it, But I must say that I had to uninstall and install it again because the app froze up and also I bought gems at $2.99 twice but never received them? that's 130 gems :(  my email shows I was charged for it... even with all that I love My Horse ..
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This is a book that really pulls you in as you go on this pilgrimage with Harold Fry.  I felt like a I walked the length of England with<br />him.  My book club chose this to read and we had a great discussion.  So glad I read it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|You should totally get this app, it rrrrooooccckkkkssss!!!!!!! If you font get it, that means you don't like really fun games
0312370849|5.0|I Loved the book and I learned quite a bit.  My father was always critical of the French during the war and now I understand.
0688014291|5.0|Quick read, got it's point across by half way through. I am acquiring more books from the same author. Would definitely recommend.

B00973902K|5.0|Fun, fun, fun. Gets you moving, dancing all around, sing the words, upbeat, feel good.  Fun, fun, fun!  More from Carly!
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I like playing this game-I can't put it down!  The good thing about some of the timers for things-I can work or do other things, and collect gold at my breaktimes.  I refuse to spend real money to buy gems.  The bad thing is I have no friends playing this game to trade hearts with so I'll probably never get any of the ponies requiring hearts :'(
B009CPJHY4|5.0|this movie really speaks to boomers. i am all about movies for adults!!!! no cursing, no nudity,no stupidity, just real life.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I love this movie and this edition it's just great..! You get a lot for what you pay..! I already bought two..!
B008B3H4VQ|5.0|Awesome album, great music and lyrics. Lost in the Echo, Burn it Down and Castle of Glass are my favorites. Highly recommended.
B000KJU1HI|5.0|so happy to have this and all the other parts of this collection of this brilliant and seminal rock and roll documentary
B007PTJOV0|4.0|I love this game. Mario brothers was the best game during my  by childhood. I should be sleeping but I'm awake playing it right now.
B00479SVBU|5.0|This is cool to play in my truck because my trunk has no auxiliary and it sounds good through my speakers i be jamming
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome. Everyone needs to do an update if you haven't already. I LOVE,LOVE,LOVE it!!! How could you not.
B000W9DTG6|5.0|All three for a good price. Love these movies and was happy to find them for a decent price. Case is a little wobbly, but I'm not one to complain about cheap products.
B003JBI4F0|5.0|I purchased the Kindle version, and found it very easy to follow and work with.  The examples are straight forward and easy to translate to my own work.  Walkenbach writes at just the correct level (for me, at least) not too simple and not too complex. Very helpful!
B001NERPHS|5.0|one of the best records out there and i am happy to own it on the special edition cd set
B005LAJ16I|5.0|This got to be the most fast paced un-put-downable edge of the seat tv series till date... cant wait for season two
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Left the reader wondering the point. Left things hanging with no clear purpose.., such as what was the \\"issue\\" he was dealing with regarding his business and how does it relate to his personal issues? It started out as any other smut romance and continued to only be about sex and never ended with a meaning to it all except barbaric sex.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Great book! Reminded me of Ray Bradbury and Neil Gaiman with its evocative narration and dreamy prose. Go ahead and read it!
B000YAA68C|5.0|Great movie, great price. Definitely worth buying, I don't regret it at all. Movie was new as promised and in good condition.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Wating with baited breath for Season 4! Excellent.  Everything I expected and more ...  it is now out &#34;on loan&#34; - laugh!
0307719774|2.0|I ordered this from Amazon a few years ago without getting to look through it first.<br />I didn't like it. The questions were incredibly uninspiring, and the space it gives you to write your answers is TINY.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|get this game you will love it play all day so much fun! !!!!!! get it you wont regret it
B00AFQC4QC|5.0|With much research behind it, as well as the personal experience of growing up in the region, Christoph Fischer's work of historical fiction provides insight into the psyche beneath the levels of destruction in WWII-era Europe. If you are someone who wonders how such atrocities could have occurred prior to, and during WWII on the continent, you will want to read The Luck of the Weissensteiners.<br /><br />The setting is Czechoslovakia, though it could have been almost any country in the region.  Ethnic disrespect, hate, and violence have gone on for centuries in central and eastern Europe. Until reading this book, though, I did not understand how finely differentiated these forces were. Indirectly, the book also helped me to better understand how the dark side of nationality has wiped out countless human beings during various periods in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia--and for that matter, North and South America.<br /><br />The Luck of the Weissensteiners follows two families and their circles of life, as they try to navigate the virulent events of their time. The story begins with the romance of a German bookseller and a young, beautiful woman of Jewish heritage. They will soon be caught in the whirling winds of their time. The author depicts how nearly impossible it is for the characters of this saga to avoid the propaganda machines around them, the pressures to conform, often in a chameleon fashion due to sudden changes in governance, and most unfortunately, the programming in ethnic bias from the time they were children. Despite the serious subjects, there is much warmth in this story. Some of the characters do find ways to stay true to the best in their natures or even redeem themselves, just as real individuals did then, and have always done on the plains of human existence.<br /><br />If you enjoy well drawn characters whose lives and choices so deftly represent the themes of a book, The Luck of the Weissensteiners provides a rich read. In some ways, thisbook reminds me of classics I read long ago like The Canterbury Tales, or even The Odyssey, due to the diversity of personalities and the theme of journeys. From ethnic origin to talents and occupations, physical descriptions to sexual preferences, and economic status to political leanings, we see a cross section of humanity. Through their eyes and reactions, we can appreciate the full range of real outcomes and experiences, happy to sad or shocking, that occurred to real individuals during this era. By the way, the title of the book was an outstanding choice.<br /><br />The Luck of the Weissensteiners would be tremendous in an audio version. For now, consider reading it out loud with a few friends who are interested in what life was like for those who lived the events of the novel's time. Though some critics might question the generous use of adverbs and adjectives in his narrative voice and in the dialogue tags, Christoph Fischer deftly weaves his tapestry of history and fiction, with a grace not unlike Jonas, one of his primary characters. For me, the author's choice of narrative style brought economy to the complex story being told, as well as a kind of mesmerizing rhythm.

0451205766|5.0|I didn't bother to read it again but I was delighted to see it was a 21st century edition with a new foreward, etc.  That was excellent since the recipient needed that kind of commentary.
B008Y1YK0I|4.0|The blu-ray restoration of this classic is absolutely incredible. It's almost amazing that they could restore it to this level of quality. The sound is also very good with the only minor complaint being that the dialouge in some parts is a little low. The music shines throughout. One quick mention of the movie. I watched this on a 106 inch projector screen on top volume with the Polk speakers cranking and really enjoyed it. It was the first time I think I ever watched it start to finish (in three seperate sessions because it is so long)! The camera work is my favorite part of this movie and still to this day some of the best work ever done. The scene where they take the town with hundreds of horsemen riding in is absolutely stunning. Why only four stars? I don't feel I will watch it again for awhile and is does drag in a few parts. Maybe I will come back and rate it five stars after another viewing. Still comes highly recommended and is without question an all-time classic.

When I wasn't reading, I was constantly thinking about the book, wanting to know what comes next.<br /><br />An absolute must read. I promise you will not be disappointed.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I'm sure I've reviewed this one before, but I'm going to do it again because I LOVE THIS GAME..the first, second, and third ANGRY BIRD games kept getting better and better, but this STAR WARS ANGRY BIRD really pops! The difference I think is the difficulty in obtaining higher levels. Where gravity was always a factor in trajectories, now WEIGHTLESSNESS  and ORBITS is just as big a problem. BIRDS IN SPACE  started that but add the forever endearing STAR WARS theme and, it becomes really interesting...and remaking the birds into SW characters is soooo hilarious! But don't let the cute fool you. The levels become very difficult as you advance...I think I reviewed STAR WARS ANGRY BIRD month's ago, and I STILL haven't beaten the game! I am an ANGRY BIRD fan all the way, but this one is honestly the best...and you get to kick Darth-Bird-Vader right in the....well, you know....enough said

1616550414|5.0|While I was surfing Amazon for all their Zelda merchandise, I came across quite a few books, manga, etc. There was another book almost similar to this one- at least that what it says. If you read the reviews on this $80 book you will know that it has nothing to do with the game- other than the history of the company who created the game. The cover looks pretty but I mean it's seriously about nothing else- why is it $80? When this absolutely beautiful piece of work done by Dark Horse is on sale for $20??? It HAS EVERYTHING! Even in the back is a full size comic of Skyward sword redone for English. It has artwork for every Zelda game ever released as well as information, and so much more! I seriously shed a tear after looking through this book- it is so beautiful! It even has translated Hyrulian Text into english and Japanese~! Maps and even extras that never made it into the games. I am so very VERY very VERY!!!!!!  Happy HAPPY!!! with this purchase and ANY true Zelda fan should have this in their collection! Thank you Dark Horse! 8D

B007PTJOV0|5.0|We LOVE this game. Brings me back to the original Mario days. 1 thing I don't like is when you use all your lives you have to start all over at the beginning of the world not just the level before. I don't know how many times I passed 3 or 4 levels then die and have to try and beat them all over again. Great fun though :o)
B001ANSSDC|1.0|So many things wrong with this book. The guy sounds mentally challenged more  than amnesia. Yes he's mentally unstable but he's not dumb. The father really has no point other than he's a jerk. Doesn't make sense. Tiffany has a bad rep because  of the reasons she lost her job an  is called a psycho. She deals with her husband's loss differently but doesn't need to be thought o  as a psycho especially by her sister. Dumb. Dumb. Dumb. Maybe the movie is better?

B007HC3LHS|4.0|The most unique aspect of \\"Into the Darkest Corner\\" takes a little getting used to and may be off putting for some readers: The chapters alternate between the development of Catherine's abusive relationship to handsome, mysterious Lee and her anxiety-ridden life four years later. I found the first four chapters disorientating, as they take place in four different years (out of order). After that, the narratives settle into a back and forth that is easy to follow and allows for the horrific details of Cathy's past to slowly unfold.<br /><br />One effect of the abuse Catherine suffered is OCD that causes her to check the doors and windows of her apartment for hours. The new neighbor upstairs, a psychologist, encourages Cathy (as she calls herself now) to get treatment. Cathy is beginning to make progress when she discovers Lee has been released. How can she have a normal life when he could appear at any moment? And will anyone believe her when she begins to find subtle signs that Lee is stalking her?<br /><br />This book was hard to put down--gripping enough that it kept me up until 4 in the morning. While the climax isn't completely surprising, there are some good twists along the way. The abusive relationship seems realistic; the author does an excellent job showing how a young woman without family, making questionable decisions (hard partying and one night stands), falls under the spell of a charismatic man who slowly becomes more controlling until he erupts into escalating violence.<br /><br />On the other hand, the appearance of the new neighbor / psychologist / love interest felt a little too convenient, and I didn't feel we're given any compelling reason for his attraction to her; she seems more like a \\"project\\" for him. Also, the description of Cathy's OCD rituals is, well, repetitive. I appreciate that the writer shows us how tedious and time consuming the rituals are, and I'm not sure how she could have gotten around this problem, but the fact is, reading those actions repeated over and over again gets boring.<br /><br />Still, this is an exciting page turner, and I enjoyed it. I especially admire that the author wrote most of it during National Novel Writing Month. An impressive feat!ose actions repeated over and over again gets boring.<br /><br />Still, this is an exciting page turner, and I enjoyed it.

I am very excited to see what their future brings. If you like this style of music I would also recommend JJ Grey & Mofro. I will also recommend people to check out JD McPherson and Charles Bradley. Neither falls under the same genre but I bought their CDs off of Amazon with this one and they are great too!

B00756GRUE|3.0|I like it, it is a keeper, but it has very limited functionality.<br /><br />The word Chronograph means stop watch. The button at 2 O'clock starts and stops the stop watch and the button at 4 O'clock resets it. That is the second hand returns to zero. The 12 O'clock position. You can't run the large second hand continuously, it stops, possibly after one hour. I think this is to conserve stored power. All three buttons are normally screwed down, so access to the stop watch is slow, you must first unscrew the two buttons and then re-tighten them after use. Hardly convenient. It is not clear how waterproof the watch is with the buttons unscrewed.<br /><br />The small dial on the left is the second hand, the small dial on the right is an hour hand that rotates once every 24 hour while of course the main hour hand rotates twice in 24 hours. The small dial at the bottom is a minute counter for the stop watch and fairly hard to read too. Compared to the stop watch on your Android phone, this is useless.<br /><br />The whole watch and strap is beautifully made and looks the business. Many watches these days have a day name and a day of month display, this watch only has a day of month display and it is extremely difficult to read. The day of month display has tiny numerals on a black background and is recessed in the dial making this far harder to read than any other Seiko watch I have. You also have to manually reset the day of the month every month that has less than 31 days.<br /><br />Unlike Seiko Kenetic watches, there is no way to discover the amount of stored energy left in the battery.<br /><br />I have a Seiko Quartz Diver's Watch made in the 1980s that looks similar, but has an LCD display for many functions including stop watch, different time zones and the day and day of month which adjusts the day number 100% automatically. The SSC017P1 designed about 30 years later looks more impressive, but functionally, it is completely out classed by the earlier model. TheSSC017P1 is a basic watch that tells the time and looks stunning. If you want a watch that does more, look elsewhere.

B0034G4P4O|4.0|The Adventures of Tintin (Steven Spielberg, 2011)<br /><br />I have to admit, I was really, really expecting to not like this movie. I can count the number of Spielberg-directed efforts I'd be willing to watch again on one hand, Tintin has never really adapted all that well to the big screen (I've seen at least half a dozen attempts, none of them completely successful), Spielberg hasn't delved into the PG world for over two decades (his last PG-rated film was 1991's Hook) and Peter Jackson never has. And honest to Ritz crackers, of all the people you could have cast as Tintin... Jamie freakin' Bell? Billy Elliott, for pete's sake? Why does this kid even have a career after Jumper?<br /><br />And yet, somehow, I am amazed to tell you, it all works. I'll put it this way: my fifteen-month-old son barely has the attention span to watch a ten-minute episode of Moomins or Curious George, but I put The Adventures of Tintin on this morning and he sat in his high chair riveted to the screen the entire movie. And you know what? So was I, well without the high chair. Everything that should have been irredeemably wrong about this movie somehow works.<br /><br />If you're familiar with Herg&eacute;'s series of Tintin comics, The Adventures of Tintin is a (loose) adaptation of The Secret of the Unicorn, with a very abbreviated version of Red Rackham's Treasure in the last fifteen minutes. If you're not, the plot: Tintin (Bell) is an award-winning Belgian reporter between the World Wars. He and his faithful dog Snowy are wandering aimlessly through a flea market one afternoon when they chance upon a beautiful triple-masted model ship. Tintin buys it for a pound and is immediately accosted by two men in succession who want to buy it from him for dozens of times more than he paid for it. Obviously, there's something special about this ship. After Snowy accidentally knocks the ship over, Tintin finds a miniature scroll hidden in the mainmast—and soon finds that Professor Sakharine (Craig. Daniel Craig.), one of the men who had attempted to buy the ship from him earlier in the day, has an exact replica. With, presumably, another scroll. Thus begins a globetrotting game of cat and mouse, as the two attempt to wrest each other's scrolls away.<br /><br />Now, I'm one of those people who thinks that this motion-capture form of animation that's gotten so big recently is just downright creepy-looking, which was another thing the movie had against it in my head before I started, but ten minutes in I had almost forgotten I wasn't watching a live-action film (save Snowy, who's always pretty obviously a CGI creation). The characters are expressive and just shy of realistic, almost all of them very well-voiced—and delivering great lines thanks partly to Herg&eacute; and partly to screenwriting team Steven Moffat (Coupling) and Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead), who are obviously familiar with the series and inserted references to a number of other Tintin adventures (The Crab with the Golden Claws, Explorers on the Moon, The Land of Black Gold, and many more). Spielberg has always been good at action sequences (and that handful of his films I'd be willing to watch again all turn on distinctive ones—1941, Duel, Saving Private Ryan), and he delivers some solid ones here, especially in the film's climax. This is excellent stuff all around. It would have been very nice to see them draw it out another twenty minutes or so and work in at least a little more of the actual Red Rackham's Treasure storyline, but you can't have everything. ****.

B007L6VR12|5.0|Like I said above, I thought this was the best Wes Anderson movie ever - and I'm not necessarily that big of a fan.  But this one really spoke to me: I'm from the &#34;period&#34; of the film. (Yipes, I love having to say that - at least there were no dinosaurs in it ...)  I was also involved in the Boy Scouts and in a production pf Benjamin Britten's &#34;Noyes Fludde.&#34;  So, what's not to like?  I thought all the performances were absolutely top notch!
B0083DJWGO|5.0|Nassim Taleb objectively observes human endeavors which allows him to accurately separate the correlated events from the causal.  His writing style is humorous and engaging.  He proposes that human activity of all kinds needs to be subject to some level of stress to be maximally successful and that by deliberately minimizing stressors we are causing great harm. I have read two of his other books:  Fooled by Randomness and The Black Swan so it is difficult for me to know if one needs to them as a prerequisite to Antifragile to get the most out of it but if you were going to read only one of his books then Antifragile is the one to select.

B007REV4YI|5.0|In my opinion, James Bond has been missing-in-action since the Pierce Brosnan days. Daniel Craig's James Bond in Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace was not James Bond. He was a gritty, masculine action hero who shouldered his way through every obstacle, regardless of the fact that he was wearing a $2000 suit. He was a great action hero, one that I enjoyed watching, but he was not James Bond and the the movies in which he starred were not true James Bond films. They were too serious and were missing all the little things that identified a classic Bond film like Goldeneye or Dr. No.<br /><br />Skyfall is very much a continuation of these films. It is dark and dead-serious and Bond gets shot, beat, and wrecked throughout the movie. But as I watched it, I could not help but feeling that the real James Bond had finally returned. Maybe it was the return of regular Bond charaters Q and Miss Moneypenny who have been absent for the past two films. Maybe it was the overwhelming presence of Javier Bardem's character Silva, a character that will go down as one of the greatest villains in cinematic history. I still can't quite put my finger on the reason why it feels more Bondish. But whatever it is, I am hoping that director Sam Mendes can do it again.<br /><br />The story is bold and intense, a welcome departure from the relatively weak Quantum of Solace. In tone and style, it is similar to The Dark Knight, and Bardem, who was largly ignored during awards season, is just as interesting and evil as Heath Ledger's Joker. The cinematography also deserves a nod; the film is beautiful to watch. While not my favorite Bond film, Skyfall is a very well-made movie that sends the James Bond franchise back to the forefront of the action scene.

0765325950|4.0|Like many others, I have come to the end of this great journey. The Wheel of Time is done and with its last words I turn the page and move on to the next Age of my life. In time the Wheel of Time will become memory, and myth and be forgotten as all things are forgotten and shrouded. For now, I will cherish the freshness of its bounty.<br /><br />What I would have like to know before I bought this book:<br /><br />1) Is it an action book or is it a character building book?  It is an action book that uses said action to  build on the characters.<br /><br />2) Does it get to the point?  The entire book IS the point.  This book is The Last Battle, stage by stage. There is a bit of necessary metaphysical world  ... thing ... with Rand that is skim-able.  No details here.<br /><br />3) Did Brandon Sanderson do a good job?  Wow what a question to answer.  Brandon is not Robert Jordan. The book does not feel like a book Robert Jordan would write. Why? The attitude of certain characters changes completely. What they say does not match the feel of who they are. On the other hand, some characters are blatantly spot on.<br /><br />4) Is #3 a bad thing?  I guess you have to decide for yourself.<br /><br />SPOILER WARNING, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED<br /><br />This book is essentially two things:<br /><br />1) The Story of the Last Battle, from the perspectives of all those who fought in it (as many as Brandon could fit). It is a magnificent book of the very last struggle of the Age.<br /><br />2) It is a eulogy. Many characters die. Some die grandiosely. Some die whimpering. Some die stupidly. Some results will not be what you want. What is certain is that ... many die. This is as it should be.<br /><br />I skimmed a lot of the `creation' battle between Rand and Shaitan. It was boring, even if well placed to explain both time and the vastness of the struggle. Everything else was more interesting. Yet, I could see the reasoning and artistry of those 'creation' scenes. It simply wasn't'my thing'. It might not be yours.<br /><br />Mat, Perrin, and Rand got what they wanted: love of their lives and life. I ...wished for something different.  I wanted to see the main characters EMBRACE sacrifice.  I did not see that. I saw them shoulder burdens, but not deep personal loses. Only Egwene did ... but she's the least of all the main characters. She's not one of the 3 Tavaren.<br /><br />The ending is epic and I loved the book until the very final part when I find out Rand lives. I believe in the classical Greek concept of greatness: a good man lives, but a hero dies. Rands survival cheapens things after a magnificent struggle. It seems the secondary characters hefted the sacrifices while the main characters empathized with them but walked away, pained, yet smugly happy.<br /><br />In a fit of total personal opinion, I would have:  Killed Faile, Mat and Rand.  Don't get me wrong. I like all three characters but their deaths would have struck the bell of true tragedy and sacrifice that I think is missing.  Tragedy is more powerful when it strikes the main characters in force. Entire nations of 2nd tier and 3rd tier characters can die and it won't bring as much impact to the reader as 1st tier character suffering. I can picture Perrin weeping in desperation and feel his pain if Failed died. The unfair world remained unfair and doing the right thing doesn't necessarily mean being rewarded in any way. I can picture Tuon, stoic empress and the mask she would put, the front, even as her insides clench in grief ... even as she planned the next stage of her conquest of the world. Tuon's alignment is, what I would call, lawful evil.<br /><br />That the world sees Rand as dead is good drama for the 'in world' legend of the Dragon Reborn. It is a symbol of sacrifice and of hope. But, the reader is not part of the world. The `trick' of Rand's body snatching doesn't include the reader because we know Rand is very much alive and happy. The 'trick', thus, robs the ending of majesty ... of sacrifice.<br /><br />In conclusion, a very rewarding read that falls short of greatness because it fails to nail home a core concept the series was very much about: Heroes sacrifice so that others may be spared.<br /><br />4 stars
