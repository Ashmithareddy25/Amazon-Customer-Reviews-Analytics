B002W7J3SO|5.0|I have watched this movie often enough that I know the dialog! I will continue to watch when I'm in the mood for a great movie.
B006ZB3V2C|2.0|I used it one day then forgot about it til I saw I had this review to fill out. Maybe I need to experiment more to appreciate it.
0375842209|5.0|Couldn't put this book down.  Not the typical Holocaust novel, this is a fresh take on the circumstances of one girl and the family that takes her in, as well as the neighbors and friends who touch her life in the ghetto.  Once I grasped who the narrator was, it took on a whole new meaning.  The book seems to span many levels of thought and spirituality.  Will try more by this author.
B000NMW6M0|2.0|This movies is all over the place (literally).  I just don't think the writers, producer, or director ended up with what they were hoping for.<br /><br />I guess internationally tying the tragic events of giving a gun to someone as a gift sends a message, but trying to pull it off in a 2+ major motion picture just didn't work out in this movie.
0544104404|5.0|This book is a fresh look at some of the most recent research on what helps children go forward.  It contrasts the things that don't work, as studied over time.  A light but enlightening read.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|So glad I got this move along with the Firefly series! I am in love! Only wish there was more to watch :)
B008JFUO4U|5.0|Good movie.  Nice mix of action with some suspense and drama.  Was not very indepth character development but overall entertaining.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Absolutely love the Firefly series! Only problem is that I wish the show had continued! I highly reccomend it! :)
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I downloaded to my Samsung Galaxy.  It took less than a minute and I've had no problems with the app so far!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game it is so much fun! Best free game I have downloaded no need to spend any money on it just work your way up to a cool little town
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|It was interesting to imagine these people having conversations about politics and life as it was in the mid 1850's.  But, if you like a fast paced storyline, it isn't here.  I enjoyed it; but not all people have the patience to stay with the story.
B009CGCQPU|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  I already own it on DVD, but had to buy the digital copy to keep on my Kindle Fire.  It is a must see for anyone who enjoys period pieces.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|I am totally obsessed with this game I just wish I could earn more aura... or there were other ways to earn aura
B000UJ48U4|5.0|Be sure to watch your movies when received.  Some are coping them and the first one I received only had 1/4 of the movie.  Could not watch the rest, if I tried scene selection it would have a black screen and just go straight to the end!  However, the company complied and sent another copy. Still have to make sure it has the entire movie.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Great story, great plot. Worth re-reading. Love it. This author knows how to illustrate a great novel. Writing at par with Game of thrones.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|This was the first of Richard Castle's books I have read. I enjoyed it. It wasn't too suspenseful enough and the ending wasn't too much of a surprise. It was a good introduction to the series and I am looking forward to reading the rest of Nikki Heat books. It does remind one of the television series with minor differences. Those differences keep it interesting.
B005D4YP0Y|5.0|Great Sandal fits like a glove , protective toe is a must have. This is my second pair.Dog ate teh last ones
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|:This is one of the best non-fiction books I have ever read, it gave both sides of the war and it was hard to put it down
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|First, I want to thank Fox News for encouraging me to read this book.  That said, everyone should read this book.  Especially those least like to do so, like the people who watch Fox News.<br /><br />Wish I'd had a prof like Reza Aslan when I was in college.
B0063IH60K|3.0|This game was fun to play, however, not happy about all the advertising that comes with playing it. Also, once you are done with one game, it isn't easy to restart a new one.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love the books!!<br />Not as 'raunchy' as everyone made them out to be, but a great love story!<br />I swear I fell in love with Mr. Grey!<br />Totally worth reading!<br />(I read all three in less than a week!)
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|It's a very good book.  Hard to put down and keeps you interested.  It's hard to write about it without giving away the ending.  Definitely a book that is worth reading and very entertaining!
B009VIZDLI|5.0|The book was really enjoyable. Simple yet insightful, and very funny. Would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a refreshing change.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Addictingly fun,  don't want to put it down!  Downloaded it for my son but I can't stop playing Minion Rush!
B003INBNXO|4.0|Loved the decor, the fashion, the sutle humor, the discipline, the strength, I could go on. Sum it up, I loved the movie.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is a great series about a law firm.  It seems as though the characters are still developing as there are quite a few questions regarding each character's background.  The story line is fairly straight forward but the characters are likeable.  Overall this is an entertaining series.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fantastic and the fun is endless I love this game because it allows you to change your character
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Not only is the plot captivating but Rothfuss' writing is beautiful - some of the best prose I've read in a very long time.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app for Christians. You will enjoy this app and enjoy the choices you have. One of my favorites! I love this app.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|this game is fun when it works correctly...invariably the game freezes on me daily....sometimes it refunds your bingo credits...but more often not
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|While I loved Deception Point and Digital Fortress, and enjoyed daVinci Code, this book was lacking. It felt convoluted rather than complex, and the ending was a real letdown.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I think it needs to have more levels...other than that it's a fun game to play .......I finished all the levels and started them all over again
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|I havent done extensive testing but my initial 2 weeks of use I have to say the charging is much faster than the charges I have had earlier. The charger fits tight into my CRV outlet and for me that is good. I have cases where the chargers were not connected despite being in the outlet.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this lovely escape from the 21st century and am looking forward to reading other works by Jane Austen.
B003IY48PS|4.0|one of the best terror films in the 80´s i recommended the movie get it now i like the item
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This game is so strong!!!! I can't put it down!!! The only thing I don't like is how fast you run out of energy it gets annoying.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|So enjoyed this book. A great insight into modern Kabul and how the circumstances, politics, war etc have affected the lives of innocent people.  The characters were made life-like and you can so relate the them and feel for them. Great read as always from Khallad. He is a seriously good writer.  Buy it!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I'm having the same update issues... uninstalled reinstalled and same problem. I'm quite irritated as now I'm losing my weekly prizes. Cash items are hard for people to get that do not spend real money to play games. I am glad I do not invest my hard earned money in a game that has this many issues. Please fix and provide us something for the inconvenience...
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|When I am running I just randomly die in this game. But otherwise it's a good game. I like it.<br />I recommend it for people who like the movie.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Very interactive but what confuses me is the fact that some care options weren't available until certain levels. But overall this app is great fun!
B00BP0P9U0|4.0|I just love this book, it is a very useful tool to refer to when questioning muscle engagement, or with injury prevention and rehabilitation.  I find it clear and precise with explanations for and modifications with mat work.
B000MR1V22|5.0|This movie had it all. The acting was fantastic. Each character was played perfectly. I went through a range of emotion.  First I traveled back in time to the era of which I grew up. I laughed, cried, loved and disliked grandpa. I love how this family came together and realized what it's all about. Loving each other. What a great movie.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|It was a great kids movie, and it kept my granddaughter occupied for the 2 hour car ride home.  Wonderful to have her entertained and not wanting to know when we would arrive home every fifteen minutes.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Worked with my Kindle HD just fine. Only criticism is the Align the Streams of Time. This was difficult for me and if there was help I didn't recognize it. The only option I saw was to quit that mini game. Glad I purchased it.
1451695195|5.0|I'd heard Dr. Alexander speak on a talk show and was interested in reading about his experience...I am a firm believer in another dimension and the premise that as energy we continue on and have pondered the question of what makes us 'us' since I was a child.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book as did my Mom and don't understand why people feel they must discredit experiences such as these. I loaned this book to a girlfriend who is very entrenched in Christian doctrine and was skeptical...if she couldn't find scripture to connect one of Dr. Alexander's experiences to she simply couldn't accept it, and told me about an article in Esquire magazine i should read.  I did read it, and it attempted to discredit the doctor by suggesting that he was having financial issues at the time of his coma and simply cooked up the entire story as he lay in the hospital.<br />First, had that been the case, he would have come up with a story that much more closely resembled other NDEs, and second, they never bothered to explain how it was that Dr. Alexander could have described exactly a sister he'd never met or seen a picture of.<br />Reading about NDEs not only affirms my beliefs but makes me smile when I think of friends and family who have passed.
B0012HQKZE|5.0|This is Anthony Hopkins like you have never seen him before.  His acting in the Hannibal Lectar seies is phenomenal, as well as his portrayal as C.S Lewis in Shadowlands.  The Edge, however, is my favorite Hopkins movie.  He &#34;dives&#34; into his character and makes you believe him, and what he is going through.  There are triumphant times as well as very low times.  He is put to the test physically, mentally, emotionally, as well as his prideful lifestyle and attitiude.  He realizes that money isn't everything and tries to grasp life as a beautiful gift that we only have for a little while.  This movie is a must see for anyone who loves nature and flawless acting!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|My old Razer deathadder's side button speed working so I decided to buy another, then for some reason i decided to check out other mice. The sheet size of this one caught my eye because I have larger hands and the price point was especially enticing. I've used it for a few weeks already and I am still completely satisfied withy my purchase. It's a fairy sturdy build, has one of the most comfortable scroll wheels and the excellent tracking with a considerable dpi range. I recommend to all buyers looking within this price bracket
B00AM7E4LM|4.0|This is a good book proposing a method for picking up the essential skills of a discipline. The author asserts that it would take 20 hours of correctly organised, focused effort to learn most things to a competent (but not expert) level.<br /><br />The book starts by telling the reader the main steps of the learning method. The author then describes his efforts at applying this method at different disciplines: learning to play go (the game), windsurfing, playing the ukulele, a new type of keyboard, a computer programming language, and yoga.<br /><br />Overall, the method seems sound. It basically involves doing enough research on the topic to find out the essential, core skills and then working out how to learn and practice them.<br /><br />The book gave me an approach to learning that I could use. I would still have to think hard about how this method could be adapted to<br />different types of learning, but I'm still better equipped than I was before I read this book!
B002PJN59M|5.0|I saw Excalibur in 1982 and own this movie. I even name my son after the actor who played King Arthur. . . Nigel Terry. My Son's name is Nigel Perry, using Perry as his middle name. This is an epic and beautiful story. The scenery was beautiful too. I even liked the music score or battle score of \\"Carmina Rurana\\" by Carl Orff a German composer. The dark tales of the \\"Knights of the Round Table\\" kept me captivated. In school, I was always intrigued about the \\"Middle Ages.\\" About Castles and Moats. The armor that the men had to wear, live, and fight in. The love story between Genevieve and Sir Lancelot. . . The King's wife. Everything was well placed from Merlin to Morgana and Mordred, the son who wanted his father's throne. The ending was a bit bloody, but I suppose that was realistic because when there is a battle blood will be spilled. I liked the part when the nuns took King Arthur's body back on a boat and that haunting music played. I also liked the \\"Lady of the Lake\\" she re-birth the the sword of power \\"Excalibur\\" to Merlin and King Arthur had Percival return it. I thought that was pretty cool the way she had her hand extended and the sword went back under water. I didn't think there would be another movie to top Excalibur; as far as the King Arthur myths until 2002. Antoine Fuga directed his version of the dark ages with, \\"KING ARTHUR.\\" I'm going to rate and review this movie next.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love watching it - but what I really like is my Prime membership.  I've been talking up Amazon Prime all over the place.
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|This UNO app does not work on my kindle fire it looks like it connects then goes directly to kindle home page very dissatisfied
B00A285OOW|2.0|I thought the book was not as well written as Philippa Gregory's other books.  Too much repititive chapters.  In the summers they went on progress then they were preparing for christmas, then they were  going on summer progress then Christmas again.  it just wasn't very interesting. Too much time spent on describing who people were.<br />Disappointing.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Good fun playing this game but wish the energy blasted longer but fun looking for all the items and the different scenes
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved it. First time reading this author and will definately read her other books.<br />Interesting style having both central characters as narrators. Would definatley<br />recommend.
B00004WX4X|4.0|Sounds great, looks great, definite must have if you enjoy Hip-hop. Although the track &#34;You Have The Power&#34; skipped. I was still generally pleased with this record.
0143122916|5.0|Shin's story is indeed a remarkable one, and should be required reading of all high school students, to accompany Night by Elie Wiesel.  In the 1990's, I stood on the DMZ line overlooking North Korea, never realizing people, including children like Shin were in such horror-filled camps, suffering.  The author points out that these camps have existed twelve times as long as the Nazi concentration camps. Shin is the first known person to escape a North Korean prison camp.  This story will shock and unsettle readers as they learn how far a totalitarian state will go.  What is even more remarkable is that Shin has developed empathy and will not stop telling his story until every North Korean prisoner is set free.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like this app good way to kill time..wish I could have a lot more diamonds ..but what girl doesn't
B008KMHFJY|5.0|This story keep me interested from the beginning to the end. The Love story was amazing and knowing that you can read the view of both of the main characters makes you won't you to finish it quickly...
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a phenomenal book about finding yourself(in my opinion) Charlie is the main character  who is special, how he understands and tells the truth and looks at things differently, If you are under 15 I would not recommend this book to you
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is the most awesome game ever not even temple run 2 can beat u have to get it right now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00ALKO9WE|4.0|Very good book. I can see why the critics around the world have embraced this story of humanity.<br />After re-reading the conclusion a number of times however I am still in the dark on what happened to the receiver and the young child.<br />I will read more reviews in order to get a better understanding.<br />Overall a great read
B009DCOU9S|5.0|Highly recommend this one for those of us who like mysteries and not feel pressured with being timed. Really recomment this one.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I lqtms a little every time I play :) considering it was free and is a great time waster I'd recommend it
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|If you like Mahjong, you will love this one. Not too simple so you get through it in a heartbeat, but not too hard either.
B00AQ71FLK|3.0|This game is exactly like league of legends everything is the free ppl every week  to the victory and defeat sign all the same :(
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|Highly recommend this one for those of us who like mysteries and not feel pressured with being timed. Really recomment this one.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Whether you are a Tennant fan or not, the mystery of this season is awesome. It keeps you thinking and wondering<br />and I am curious to see how it turns out. It has kept me enticed and interested!!! Very impressed.
B00BY9GQHM|5.0|Lots of fun, just challanging enough to keep your interest but not so difficult that you just leave it alone.
B00300EI3W|5.0|Shockingly sad documentary on how our nation so shamelessly not only promotes but prioritizes profit over health. What is it going to take for our government to truly support its people?
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game plus it stimulates any brain cells you have. It certainly makes you think. Great Thinking Game!
B008EZVNO0|5.0|What can I say! This guy is the real deal. I think I have just about every one of his albums and this is up there among the very best.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The plot twists are a little contrived, but it is as much fun to watch as Seasons 1 and 2.
B003SHDP4K|4.0|Interesting story. Good insight into Christainity and particularly the Catholic Church and all it's myths and sinister historic fables.<br />Murder, action, mystery, travel - it's all in here.
B001AQIYJC|4.0|Very sweet movie. Kinda sad but over all I give it for stars love Meg Ryan and Nicolos Cage. :)
0307730700|5.0|I couldn't put this book down and once finishing it was just in awe of Adam Brown. I think because it's a true story it has double the impact. It's quite an inspirational story about a truly amazing yet humble human being. And congrats to Eric Blehm for writing such an exceptional book.
B004TI1WME|5.0|This app works just as advertised.  I find it easy to use and really like the &#34;adding paper&#34; display feature.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I downloaded this for my daughter and she loves it. initially I thought humm, this is going to be a wasted space on the fire. But ive been Proven  wrong because my daughter always pick this game to play. My only dislike is some characters/costumes  are hard to obtain without spending money. Why not update it with free minions the kids can win?
B0014KFM2Q|5.0|If you don't like this, you must be from a non-parallel universe<br />Buy it, Try it and you'll love it<br />In this order, please remember that in NJ you got your Springsteen, you got your Willis, and then, there is me
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love the graphics and I can play this for hours:) love it. You got to buy it AMAZING AND AWESOME
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game so much-needed fun games for free download minion game is to be a great way to be able to be a great deal
B006LSZECO|5.0|The book is easy to read has lots of twists and turns and very hard to put down. I would highly suggest it anyone looking for a fun summer read.
B003274QH6|5.0|Bought this for a friends birthday & I know he'll love it. There is no reason to not love this series!!! :)
0143038583|5.0|Michael Pollan really does a great job of teaching people about food and making more educated decisions about our food.
0345803485|1.0|I downloaded this book from my local library. You would expect that would be a quality recommendation in itself. Its on the NYT list. And allegedly the author is on the 100 best list. Either my taste in literature is founded so deeply in past, I thought the reader sounded like a 15 year old, and written by a 16 year author.<br /><br />After listening to the first couple of pages, I thought I was listening to an audiobook of a comic book. Fictional novels and literary license still need to follow some sort of adult understanding of the real world. Even Science fiction needs to follow some standards of reality. This novel, as some other critics have noted, sounds like a fantasy of a teen age girl.<br /><br />I have some business experience, and know that giving the customer what it wants is only way to stay in business.<br /><br />Publishing houses are  business.  It knows its customers are most likely female, and are looking for something to accommodate their desire for fantasy.<br /><br />But not all the readers in the world are female, or young, or desire to read fictional fantasy. At my age, I crave fiction that can be considered a form of art and intelligent good writing.<br /><br />I would ask the publishing industry and critics at NYT's pay a little more attention to the fact that I and I suspect a considerable of those should be warned or told that some books are dribble for those who want dribble.  If Amazon or other book sellers can denote whether a book is for young people or children, it seems logical that some of us who also buy books would appreciate that effort.
B004ELSDZK|4.0|I liked this game. But it is just the game for me.<br />I was looking for more of a puzzle game.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Great game lots of new stuff to do.......Great for the whole family:-)  Feel free to add me game name kathy  kathybat
B00A7W29BE|4.0|This scanner is perfect for taking shots of receipts, check or anything else you need a pdf of. Easy to attach to emails as well.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|A little late to the party, but glad we found it. This show is so well made, great acting, fabulous visuals, interesting story. Has it all humor, romance, mystery, drama. It is a tv show that does not insult your intelligence and is non offensive. Thanks amazon for having season 3!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game. Very easy to waste a lot of time with it. On down side is it can quickly drain your battery due to high graphic usage
B004KPX4W2|5.0|Don't expect an Oscar for Best Actress, but this was a great movie to watch. If you like these sort of comedy/shootem up movies this is a must.
B005F9CPG8|5.0|While I prefer to listen to the expanded song list of the Red Album & the Blue Album as far as compilations go...hell, I grew up on those....this is a good, enjoyable listen. It's the songs that charted #1...that's what it's billed as & that's what u get. From \\"Love Me Do\\" to \\"the Long & Winding Road, not a bad track here. This just reinforces the fact of how great the Beatles were. It's not often that popular & really good, challenging, innovative music coincide. Play this thru & u will see, at least once upon a time, this was so...
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|I would have been dissapointed seeing this in the movie for $10 a ticket, but it was fun to watch at home when bored. The story line was there, but the acting just couldn't pull it together.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  You can visualize the characters.  Would recommend.  Make sure you read walking disaster next and you<br /><br />will get to hear Travis's story.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|I'm not a Tom Cruise Fan, so I hesitated to watch this movie. I would have been dissapointed seeing this in the theater for $10 a ticket, but I'm glad I rented it.
B00503BN1M|4.0|I enjoyed this version of the &#34;frienefits&#34; eff buddies more than it's counterpart released the same year. Surprisingly I was misled by the various review sites. At least that's my take after watching. Definitely re-watchable in my book!<br />Rated R so not for kids.
B00E8B1358|5.0|These movies can't be a good quality flick, it's impossible. If you sit back and take it for what it is, you will enjoy the heck out of it. I was dissapointed that there wasn't more Bruce Willis.
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|Directed by Spielberg protege JJ Abrams -- Star Trek 2009, Mission Impossible 3, Star Trek: Into Darkness<br />All around sci-fi & coming-of-age flick enjoyable for the whole family. It feels very Spielberg 70's/80's and has his fingerprints all over this one. This is a uniquely fantastical tale of a small town with some big boots to fill when something changes one night. Full of clich&eacute;s but get your popcorn, sit back and enjoy a very well-made film!
B00BIVN82M|5.0|HE IS THE BEST CURRENT SINGER.  I JUST LOVE HIS MUSIC.  I DO NOT LIKE YOUR REQUIREMENTS. SO THERE NOW.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|update glitches, fix it, and there is a &quot;lost all my dollars glitch. sure am glad I didn't use real money to buy them
B00002N9ER|5.0|Use these to secure 4 cell MagLites to various bulkheads on my boat. Holds them securely. What else is there to say?
B007HO392S|4.0|I love Carrie Underwood's sweet ballads, but I like even more when she's a little darker.  Both Blown Away and Two Black Cadillacs are great songs.
B00000251N|5.0|I feel that the songs, the scoring and the performances are unforgettable. The music<br />captures the feeling and the message of the film in remarkable performance.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Nice documentary about how one place produced so many stars.  I can't believe that a small studio and anolog style recording is proven to create such great records.
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|it is not the worst movie I have seen but definitely not worth a purchase I would spend my money on another movie for sure
B0077EBWVI|5.0|Great movie. Loved Kenny Wormald and Julianne Hough, thought they did a great job. I thought it was very entertaining
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|not to bad but would wait till comes out on hbo or something but if seen everything else worth a watch
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|This was a great movie, definitely worth watching. Out of the Quentin Tarantino films, I would say it's one of my favorites, along with Inglourious Basterds.<br /><br />However, my one complaint is not with the movie, but rather with the delivery: Amazon Instant Video. Unfortunately, the dialog volume was a little too low when I watched it using the Amazon Instant Video app on my Samsung Smart TV (2012 model). This made it hard to hear the dialog unless I cranked up the volume really high. The problem with that was that when there were loud tracks (music, certain sound effects, etc.) it became too loud. I spent the entire moving frequently raising and lowering the volume.
B003U6BE8I|5.0|It was a great movie that my son and I had a good time watching.  Full of action and adventure.
B005QYKD4I|4.0|This was a fun movie.  No Oscar nominees here or anything, as the acting is just okay, but it was a really entertaining Transformers movie.  If you need an escape for 2+ hours (it is a bit long), this will do the trick.
B0094K1PW4|2.0|We use a Wii to stream the videos to our TV and the film was good but the picture quality was terrible.
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|I give him credit for creating something new, fresh, and very personal.  Most folks will probably either love it or hate it.
B00005JNNZ|5.0|To believe and fight for one's standards. In the giveme world of today how refreshing to find someone who would not be compromised.
037571457X|5.0|I laughed, I cried.  This is a favorite of mine.  I watched the movie after I read the book and it was all great.
B00DHSK3RM|4.0|I love playing this game as it's so much fun, but I can't figure out how to play it on my tablet. I have to play it either on my laptop or my smart phone. It would be nice if I could play it on the kindle..
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Tangled is a great read.  It is funny, fresh and original.  It isn't often that we get to indulge completely in a man's point of view and if I didn't know this book was written by a woman, I wouldn't have guessed it.  The author must have seven brothers or something!<br /><br />Anyway, I enjoyed watching Drew Evans evolve from self-indulgent and spoiled to altruistic and head-over-heels in love with Kate. Even when he was a jerk, the author made him likable and also respectful of women. Well, sorta. (Especially wanting his niece to be a banker, nice touch!) That was a very fine line to walk and the author did it brilliantly.  I agreed with lots of Drew's opinions and learned a few things along the way, too.<br /><br />Readers, this book is fun, funny, sexy and romantic!
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Love all the songs.  Really all are enjoyable to listen too - really great sounds and music - totally enjoy it.
1781162646|2.0|I think this book was written by Nicholas Sparks. I am a fan of classic Stephen King. Absoulte loved Misery and The Green Mile.  This book, however, is slow, boring, and worst of all, misleading.  If you're looking for a sentimental coming-of-age novel, this story is perfect.  Mr. King is a master storyteller and he is great at mixing genres.  However, the covers states: Who dares enter the funhouse of fear?  Wouldn't that make you think there's horror involved?  There isn't.  There is a murder that you hear about through a conversation between characters. Big deal. A vision/ghost in a funhouse, and a crippled kid who knows things, like in The Shining. Super.  None of this amounts to a \\"horror\\" story. I'm less upset with the story than the misrepresentation of the story by the publishers.  If I wanted to read a young love tale with a dark twist, then I would've enjoyed this more (although I still think it's slow and boring and I have no idea where the climax was.) I listened to the audio book and stopped an hour and a half before the end.  I couldn't take it anymore and I didn't care enough to finish. (I still intend on reading The Shining.)<br /><br />I read part of Duma Key and had to stop for the same reason. Too slow and sentimental. Never got to the scary part if there was one.  I'm baffled by all the high praise for Joyland.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you love Nicholas Sparks, you'll love this story.  If you're looking for classic King or Dean Koontz, this is not your book.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Although I have no clue what will happen when I die, I always believed that I would remember once I crossed over. I wasn't raised with a strong religious foundation. So those NDE's who said they saw Jesus or God, or who would quote scriptures and mentioned hell had me disheartened. I hadn't followed that same spiritual path. That wasn't how I perceived God. Dr Alexander's story/message is not about who or how you believe in the Creator, it's about the love you give and receive. And how we're all inter-connected to each other as well as the Creator. This was a really good story. I don't even care what the critics are saying (as I'm sure their narrow minds won't allow them any rest). This made more sense to me. I'm glad he shared his story.
B00821OX98|5.0|Nice dorky mindless fun. Aliens, guns, cheap cg, whats not to love? The tall.alien makes me horny for some reason. So tall and slender. I think i love black men. Hail overlords!
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I was so intrigued by this story - just had to keep reading and was sorry when it came to the end. I will read it again. It's odd - even though Harold was described as a tall man, I kept picturing him as stooped and actually rather short..but he 'grew' as the story progressed. It was such a refreshing change from much of current fiction.

B002ZG997C|5.0|l first saw The Book of Eli on TV and ordered the DVD right away so I could watch it whenever I chose. I found it to be inspiring, entertaining, and thought provoking. Of all of Denzel Washington's movies, this is by far my favorite. Near the end, when the character's personal challenge was revealed, I was floored. It gave a new meaning to \\"walk by faith\\". See it with friends so you can discuss it afterwards. But by all means, see it!
B004GXZ69W|5.0|Thank you, the product is perfect. It's taking a bit of time to get use to the movement and handling, but I look forward to reliving some wrist pain. More later...

B00D6BQPMM|5.0|Very sweet, cute, funny, charming romantic comedy where the guy just happens to be a zombie (not a spoiler!). Imaginative concept that turns the whole &#34;zombie&#34; thing on its head. Cast is terrific. Very well done. Recommend!
B005BGBPBG|5.0|I enjoyed the movie as it was a little bit of a tear jerker and was easily viewed on my Kindle when traveling.

B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|Glancing through the songs on Doo-Wops & Hooligans, we were surprised by how many of the songs we know and enjoyed.  So before taking a family trip, we added it to our road collection.  It stayed in our CD player for most of the trip with my wife and I and both children enjoying the music.  There is not a miss on this album.  Even the songs that were not released are toe-tapping catchy.<br />As parents, we did recognize that some lyrical topics are not the best for our children, it is not language that is concerning. So a conversation about the lyrics and a check of their understanding of appropriateness and we were good to listen.  This one will remain in the car for future enjoyment.
B004LP15LS|5.0|Of the three EMI Salzburg productions recorded by Karajan in the 1970s, this Fidelio (the others were Salome and Tristan and Isolde) to my mind is the only all round success. All the singers acquit themselves well in roles well suited to their vocal qualities. They can all sing dramatically with great expressiveness in the three key roles. While there is a great deal of competition in the role of Leonore, and it will always come down to personal preference for favourite sopranos, I feel Helga Dernesch is the equal of any in this recording. She is in her prime and the voice soars. And who else has ever managed to combine such vocal power with an expression of vulnerability and jangled nerves in the great \\"Abscheulicher!\\" central aria? Ridderbusch is in his element as a basso profondo as Rocco. Kelemen though an already seasoned performer invests the evil Pizarro with venom and dark voiced strength to spare. Vickers sings his heart out as the heroic Florestan. I think his singing here, as with Dernesch over Ludwig (who does not quite have the top notes or impact) is freer and more beautiful than in the earlier Klemperer set. His voice is absolutely right for the character and he meets the challenge of his murderous introductory aria without strain. All of this is top notch, but even the secondary and minor roles in this performance benefit from superbly clear singing and characterisation, Laubenthal and Donath are just right, with their terse exchanges and clipped expression, as the immature limited outlook bfs; van Dam is comfortable in his role as the Minister with proclamations from high, with his rich fruity baritone, flying in at the last minute to save the day! Then there is the prisoners' chorus scene which is executed and sung with such feeling and perfection it will bring tears to the eyes. Karajan adopts just the right tempo here, reliable as he is throughout the opera allowing each tableau or scene to breathe and unfold its musical treasures.<br />The recording balance is superb. The orchestral playing - we are talking about the Berlin Philharmonic and Karajan in their heyday - is superb and again finely controled by the maestro in the service of the drama and singers. The ensembles are perfectly sung with voices blending in a way that can only have emerged from the luxury of adequate rehearsal time which only Karajan could command in his recording projects.<br />Bernstein, Bohm, Klemperer are all \\"good\\" for one or two reasons.<br />But why bother with them when you can get this, that satisfies on every count?<br />Unmissable for all Beethovians and opera lovers.
B000N3ST3Y|4.0|While I have many Genesis albums on vinyl and a few on cassette, I only have one on CD.  When I saw this Greatest Hits CD for a great price, I could not resist.  The selection on the album is skewed toward the last five albums, but that is where Genesis had their radio heyday.  Big hits like Invisible Touch, In Too Deep, and Hold On My Heart are paired withclassics like Misunderstanding, Turn It On Again, and Abacab.  To these familiar hits are added some not so familiar but equally enjoyable songs: I Know What I Like, Congo, and, especially, the remake of The Carpet Crawlers.  You can argue what songs should have been included or should have been excluded, but it is a fun collection that keeps me singing while listening.
B001O1O71C|4.0|This book is about a young and clue less boy Bruno. In his simple youth filled mind, all he wants is a friend. He does get a friend, Samuel who without Bruno's knowledge lives in a concentration camp. But he also gets much more than he asks for. Bruno's lack of knowledge of the time period and horrible things that are going on leads him sadly to his death. Throughout the book you come to know Bruno and his life and how such thoughtless, childish acts  can lead to shocking and tragic endings.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's so much fun to play, and not just for the kids either.  Very challenging and entertaining.  I challenge the kids to beat my scores and they often do, so I have to up my game in turn.  It is also good for hand eye coordination.  Not an easy game for small kids, but they can have a lot of fun trying.
B004LZFWJO|5.0|What can be said except fun. It is a fun and quite game which will keep you entertained. Get it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|After reading book one, I was curious what would happen next. It seemed fairly predictable, but had kind of a fairy tale pursuit in the way the story line went. It still had too much repetitive writing and was a bit obnoxious, but this book had everything from suspense, lust, love, &#34;danger&#34;, just a good follow up to book 1.
B00E25KVLW|4.0|I would have given this book five stars but I found a small error and e mailed the author about it. He will fix it soon. I especially liked the scaffolding chapter. He shows us how to create a minimal read only web app while still using the scaffold generator. It also taught one the routes, controllers, views etc. that were not needed. A good contrast to the full blown CRUD application developed in the previous section with the same name. This book did not burden the student down with front end twitter bootstrap , zurb or other design gems. That is good. I do think there should have been an optional chapter on Git version control. Git  is very easy to implement and use. Good bang for the buck etc. Only need a couple of pages. Git is also needed for Git hub and the extremely easy and popular Heroku web cloud deployment. Finally the chapter on Web servers was out of place in a beginning rails book. IMHO!!<br /><br />Still a good book.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|After reading book 1 and 2, could not resist reading the third book. I loved it, but wish the author would find some new descriptive words. It was a good ending and follow up from books 1 and 2. Although Christian Grey is a sexual deviant, I now also wish I had my own Christian Grey. These books did wonders for my sex life!
B00124PXW8|5.0|God vs Devil so damn creepy! I wonder what a remake would be like in our time now with all advances in film...
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I picked this book up because of all the press it received over the last year. I read reviews before reading, and yeah, the author is very repetitive in her writing and it can become obnoxious after a bit, but this book kept my interest and made me want more.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I liked it up until I reached level 99 &amp; it suddenly stopped loading. Kept saying to go to the app store &amp; download the update. Everytime I did that it just kept redirecting me to the app store. Now I can't open it at all. I tried shutting my kindle down, then downloading it. I did that several times, still nothing.
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|Amazon Video is subpar to say it nicely, I have a Netflix and Hulu Account and I have never had more issues than I have had with Amazon video. My husband had the same issue when trying to rent the cars movie for our son. Same Story starts and stops and then finally stopped playing altogether. So now Im looking to get reimbursed but besides the review button I cannot find out how to get contact customer service. This is absolutely ridiculous with all personalization of websites these days and I cant find the correct link to refund online purchases. It is Ludacris they have completely lost me as a customer. Save your self time and money don't use amazon video.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great game! Lots of variety in games, plus a slot game to earn more bonuses. Very enjoyable for all ages...Enjoy!

B000ICM5IK|2.0|What a shame.  Bill Conti does some new versions of classic Rocky themes for the last movie and they are NOWHERE TO BE FOUND HERE.  INstead , we get a greatest hits, which they've already done a few times, and these hits have ACTUAL DIALOGE spoken over them.  what a waste - and not even a great overview - where is MEASURE OF A MAN?  This has some ok old tunes, but the fact there is no official ROCKY BALBOA cd is a disgrace.
B0074VTHKM|4.0|Ending could have been a little more exciting but overall good book. Good story. Still enjoyed it. Easy read. :)
B00E9ZAT4Y|5.0|FINALLY!  Disney's crowning achievement is finally going to be available in Hi-Def.  I must say Disney is slow to release their catalog in Blu except for their animation but this is so exciting!  I have loved MP for 40 years and now can see it the say it was meant to be seen!
B000JQUHLM|4.0|I chose this rating because the style in which it is written made me think back to the movie &#34;Pollyanna&#34; starring Haley Mills as the delightful 12 year old child. It is relaxing and easy reading.  The ease or difficulty of reading a specific book is not the issue for me, if it is relaxing to read, then that is what matters to me.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I loved this season and was sad to see the first doctor leave. I'm usually not into sci fi things, but I really enjoyed Doctor Who season one.

0399255370|5.0|I bought this book for my grandsons and we all laughed at the letters the crayons wrote. It is NOT mean-spirited as one misguided reviewer claimed. Of course the crayons are whiny...they all have legitimate complaints and they are expressed much like a child would write in a letter. Apparently that reviewer has never read some real letters from kids at camp because these \\"crayon letters\\" fit that style perfectly. They are hilarious and children will laugh! It's easy to write things kids will laugh at but it's harder to write things that parents and kids will laugh at together. We had a great time reading and re-reading this book and it opened the door to discussions about life being unfair. A book is great if it can open the door to discussions without being preachy and alienating the child. This book is a must-have for any child's library! I hope the author writes many other stories just as funny and entertaining.

B008GWSS6W|5.0|Great adaptation of The Taming of the Shrew.  John Wayne and Maureen OHara have so much chemistry.  Loved the whole script
B000UVT3OI|1.0|Garth wake up! Love your music but you're a goof for not allowing your stuff to be sold in downloadable format (like iTunes, Amazon MP3, etc). You inconvenienced me by NOT providing a way for me to purchase your music for download for my listening enjoyment on a moments notice at my whim, to be listened to the very minute I purchased your music. Instead I had to wait a couple of days for the shipping company to deliver something called a CD, something of which I have vague recollections of from my high school days. So I'm rating this with 1 star, though it doesn't even begin to compensate for my inconvenience (don't forget I was further inconvenienced by having to take time to rip it to mp3 and then sync it to my mobile devices).<br /><br />PS. Love your music Garth!

B006IGZX0C|5.0|The Help reminds us of the cruelty and insanity of segregation.  It also reminds us of how much things of changed.  This movie could not have been made in Mississippi in the 1960s.  It is ludicrous to believe that the races had different diseases and that their interaction needed management by the state.  It was the height of insanity for whites to believe that the maids needed by use separate bathrooms, but were allowed to completely raise their children.
B005544TRQ|5.0|USA has out done themselves by producing a show filled with smart dialogue, great character development and substantive plots. I am so glad a friend recommended this show and I look forward to watching how it develops over time.
B008JFUN6E|4.0|This film is about world destroyed by Third Worlders and open borders. LA has been turned into the worst of Mexico City. The very wealthy have recreated Beverly Hills in a space station, and the corporations they run are crushing what's left of the world. That fact that one of the last on the space station is Indian is significant; in the novel \\"Camp of the Saints\\" one of those who makes a last stand for the West is an Indian. Since the rabble have destroyed the Earth they're trying to make it to the space station to destroy it. And why was Matt Damon, apparently the only young white guy left in LA, chosen? He was the only competent guy left. You can read this as the oppressed overthrowing their oppressors; you can also read it as the end of civilization, overwhelmed by immigrants. The maker is laughing, just as he was laughing in \\"District 9.\\"
B002BJGYU8|5.0|I love this series and am so happy to have it all on DVD.  The Gilmore Girls are a ground breaking family in TV history and are thoroughly enjoyable without being &#34;preachy&#34;.

140006922X|5.0|Well researched and easy to read!  I could not put it down.  I read books more than once because everytime I get more out of them and this time will be no different.  I will be reading this book several times as it was extremely interesting and sheds light on many questions I had about Jesus and his time period.

055358202X|2.0|This book brings a lot more focus on Greyjoy and Dorne, although I don't know how riveting these aspects of the story are in the context of the bigger picture. Sure, the Iron Men are somewhat vying for control of Westeros as well, but to give them full focus in the form of the character narratives was a bit of a challenge to fully invest in. The Dorne storyline just felt like one big distraction, so one can only hope that things will make sense later on. But given the narrative structure that Martin followed for this book and for the next one, we won't really find out the full relevance until book six.<br /><br />Initially I was enjoying Cersei and her paranoia - it was a natural progression for her character and all that she had been going through. But then Martin decided to go into a rather weird sexual dimension that I found was rather unnecessary. And it just went on and on and I didn't really see the point in indulging in things that much.<br /><br />Not even the chapters involving Brienne of Tarth and Arya Stark were enough to cheer me up. Normally I truly enjoyed reading more about these two characters but their narrative direction in this book was a little lackluster. And it's not a problem of bad writing in this case. So much had happened in the past book that we were back at the phase of the story where new plots had to be established before we can even declare the beginning of rising action.<br /><br />On the whole, the book suffered severely since the characters of relatively greater popularity such as Tyrion Lannister and Jon Snow were absent from this novel. We have no idea what's going on with these characters for now and things won't make more sense until the next book or so. And it didn't help that Martin had some rather weird ideas for what he wanted to do with the characters that were in fact featured in this book.<br /><br />A Feast for Crows is my least favorite book in the series thus far. And I don't have particularly high hopes for the next one at this point.ne at this point.
0321885112|5.0|I recently attended a 9 day workshop and decided to give sketchnoting a shot at the event. I had only read through 1/3rd of the material but have been mind mapping for years so I was confident that I could muster up a decent attempt. I usually like to take copious notes when listening in meetings and presentations. Otherwise, I'm afraid, my mind wanders and stop paying attention. The result is usually a long stream of content that never, I repeat, never is read again. I approached this event differently. Instead of capturing everything, I decided to capture less but make it more powerful on my page - utilizing different colors, pictures, fonts, etc.... People were stopping by my seat and praising my notes. I posted a few of my notes on the event's facebook group and then people started seeking me out and introducing themselves. They shared how much they were enjoying the posts. Near the end of the conference an individual who was sitting near me offered to pay me for a copy of my notes. I resisted. He insisted. I accepted. The next day he handed me $100 and proceeded to photograph all my notes. I'm looking forward to finishing the book and evolving my technique! Thanks Mike for this gift!
0439813786|5.0|Now this book is a story that is told in both words and pictures. In fact, practically the first 50 pages of the book are purely images that help convey what is going on in the story. More than any introduction could have done in words, we first encounter the unique world of Hugo Cabret through those beautifully drawn images that lead us on a little adventure as we follow him around the station. In fact, these full-page images are practically storyboards for the movie itself - hence my respect for the creators of the movie who made sure to follow the book as closely as possible.<br /><br />This is not to say that this novel is light on writing either. The story that is told through words remains just as vibrant and magical as the pictures themselves. And this is not about pictures that illustrate what is being described in the other parts of the books. The words pick up where the pictures end and vice-versa. And in this regard I have full respect for Selznick's abilities as a storyteller. In this book he was able to masterfully utilize both aspects of the illustration and the words to tell one coherent tale. And it is certainly a story worth enjoying to the fullest.<br /><br />Some friends have complained how expensive the book is for what appears to be \\"just\\" a children's book or something, and I can't fully blame them. I only picked up the book because it was discounted as part of a store-wide sale at the time. However after having gone through the unique reading experience that is this book, I can safely say that it's more than worth the retail price. Seriously, you cannot go wrong with owning a copy of this book.<br /><br />The Invention of Hugo Cabret is a magical experience captured in a book. It is a celebration of the silent era of movies and the fulfillment of a child reconnecting with his father in an unexpected way. It's a great book for readers of any age
0380789035|5.0|Truly an amazing work of literature. I had never read Gaiman before picking up this book for a book club. It was my suggestion and I found it on a list of the 100 best works of fiction in the last century. The description there intrigued me and I decided to suggest it.<br /><br />I wasn't sure at all what I was getting into and had a few moments of worry for the other people in the book club after a while, this book pulls no punches. Gaiman is graphic and brutal in his description in a good way, not too heavy handed but leaving little to the imagination. It's a very mature book in nature and fantastically written throughout, the characters are gripping and well defined. Though the 500+ pages were daunting to me at first, I found myself careening through them in a rush to find out just what happened next. Every detail helps the story and doesn't bog the reader down. I'd highly recommend it for a chunk of modern, thoughtful fantasy and fiction.
0061433063|5.0|There's certainly a degree of \\"pride\\" to be experienced reading about Tiffany pretty much being a witch. And as much as it's not exactly a glamorous job, it's a strongly necessary one. And given how I've come to love Tiffany over the years, it is certainly worthy of respect to see how well she fulfills her duties and how she's able to hold her own even among fellow witches. That says a lot about the strength of the character and how much she has grown (and definitely matured) over the years. She's certainly growing up to be quite the formidable witch.<br /><br />And this book helped address other questions about her development including resolving the question of Roland, better situating what place her father has in things and even the passing of the old Baron. Heck, we even addressed the question of Wee Mad Arthur from the Ankh-Morpork City Watch!<br /><br />Pratchett's writing remains as playful and elegant as ever in this book and I don't see how one can make the statement that this is meant to be a young adult novel. If it truly is one, then it's a great one that doesn't talk down to its audience, and thus it works well on a number of levels. Plus it's the main place where one can read about the Witches of Lancre, and that inevitably draws older readers who love the likes of Granny Weatherwax.<br /><br />Admittedly I enjoyed the complexity of our \\"villain\\" in the book, even though you can argue that the Cunning Man is practically simple given his singular motivations. But defeating him wasn't simple at all and how Tiffany managed to work her way through this problem in order to come out on top was definitely admirable.<br /><br />Plus man, he totally had one of the best descriptions of cats in a footnote towards the end of the book.<br /><br />I Shall Wear Midnight is essentially your true coming-of-age book for Tiffany Aching and one that makes her pass through the fire - quite literally, in fact.
B002ZG999U|5.0|VERY FARE PRICE, GREAT MOVIE, THANKS<br /><br />REALLY! SO I'M DOING YOU A FAVOR AND FILLING OUT THIS STUPID SURVEY,  WHY DO I HAVE TO ADD MORE WORDS &#34;REQUIRED&#34;
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I enjoyed this book by Hosseini, as I have his other books.  He is a superb writer and I recommend it highly.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Other reviews go into more details, so I won't bother.<br /><br />Grabbed this when it was on sale. No regrets. Although I had already seen all 3 movies, I'd not seen them in Blu-ray nor did I own them myself. Sale + good trilogy = no brainer. Bought it.<br /><br />I would like to add that someone mentioned the discs being difficult to remove from the case. That wasn't the case with mine. Could easily remove the discs. The only complaint I can make is the 2nd disc per movie, you need to remove disc 1 in order to get to disc 2. Minor complaint though. Still worth buying, in my opinion.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is fun and addictive. It is also very cute. :P this game is like temple run but a lot more cute haha
B000SEFNMS|4.0|I could never comprehend of doing this, even though I am 16 and an Eagle Scout. Greta book by Jon Krakauer
B0050NJMKG|5.0|Really great book. Would recommend it to anyone interested in colonial history in Africa.<br />The books shows how cruel the  belgian colonial government was.<br />You can see why the Congo is in the state it is in today. Obviously, it is not all about colonialism, but it had an important impact nonetheless.
B0043UB0EI|5.0|Enjoyed every minute of this series,it was well made, I was hesistant in the beginning but now I am a fan...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so much fun!!! I would recommend it to everyone!!! The new updates make this app even more enjoyable. I love how some of the characters have different outfits to choose from, if only my fave character had a different outfit. She is so pretty!!! Anyway, also, every update has a new country. Right now it is Tokyo, please look at the date if this comment, who knows what the next one will be. It's so much fun with the new gadgets like the pogo stick and the jet pack and so on. You can even land on the roof!!! Just download this fantastic game. You won't regret it. I swear.
014241493X|3.0|...but I only liked this book. I recognize that I am not the proper demographic, but I found the \\"drama\\" in this book to be distracting and even annoying. The characters are all in high school, dealing with typical high school issues, when one character runs away and the others, in their search to find her, totally disrupt their lives. I found the characters clever and mostly likable. The were very well spoken high schoolers and quite bright. I found the ending less than satisfying. Green is so clever and so witty and so interesting. This book didn't live up to my expectations of his storytelling capabilities. It was a quick read and that was good.
B0094M2ITG|4.0|Lovely story! Something in it for everyone. Bit of a slow start, and but stick with it. Loved the ending.
B00B4FU6KE|4.0|I liked this novel. It was different from anything I've read. The narrative was very disjointed at times, and that would be my primary complaint. However, I liked the narrator and I was interested in her story. I am hesitant to write a proper review, as I don't want to give away a central plot point. Ultimately, this novel is about coping with loss and family and the whole messy world of family. Memories differ from family member to family member and the narrator must learn what the truth is for her and her memories. The novel had a lot going on and the narrative was curious, as it was not very linear. Overall, it was an interesting and intriguing novel.
B0012GMVDK|5.0|For anyone totally in love with his style and his sound, this CD may well be his best - classic Leonard Cohen - gotta love it!
B007D2XSW0|3.0|When an image is altered and saved, it goes somewhere. Havent found it yet?  I have gone through the file explorer and everything. Maybe they will fix soon for the Galaxy S4. Would be much higher than a 3 star.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I can see all of Collins' characters and scenes vividly. The story Is both moving and thought provoking. I look forward to reading the next two books in the series.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|One of my favorite bands and good selection of songs.<br />The Cd came in a slip and nothing was chipped.
B0049OSQ18|5.0|I love this cd.  The Decemberists are a band I recently saw on Austin City Limits and I liked the one song I heard them play.  Taking a chance, I ordered this cd and was not disappointed.  I got the one song I liked, plus a lot more!
030758836X|3.0|I've ordered many books but this one took almost 3 wks to get. Took my<br />Money from my account the day after it was ordered...
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|This is an amazing cd that I love to listen to.  I would highly recommend.  I don't think there's a bad song on it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a really good game<br />For kids. I love it!!!!!!!<br />It teaches us how to take care of pets too!!!
B007V5CF5K|5.0|Love the fun and graphics of these games. Have replayed it just to keep my mind busy and relax. Great game :)
B004AKCMD4|5.0|First things first, this movie is beautiful.  Especially on Blu-ray.<br /><br />Everything about the animation is meticulous and eye-popping.<br /><br />That's without even getting to the story itself, which I found to be delightfully conceived and executed.  The voice actors did their jobs capably, and the soundtrack was nice (even with the strange surprise of Owl City being involved).<br /><br />I would recommend this to parents who are tired of sitting through totally mindless movies with their children, and want to be able to have something that both they and their kids can enjoy.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I am not the best at these action type games but it has cretainly kept my grand kids busy. They love the challenge and the graphics. I will have to keep practicing :)
B0091WNK8M|1.0|I have a brand new HD tv and this movie kept pausing very, very frequently. I've never had a problem streaming with red envelope company starts with \\"N\\". Amazon can you please fix this? Goonies is a classic movie and I love it. Please fix this streaming problem!!!
B009RH9HDS|5.0|I love this cover. It does everything I wanted to have it do. I ordered an I Pad cover from another company, and don't like it at all. I like how protective it is, the pivot and stand feature, and especially the color, orange!
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I had to take a break between book 4 and 5. Five was so much better. But I am very confused about the point of some characters ( John snow) worried what happened to others and still waiting for the big battle-or any battle! Still loved it!
B0094K1K42|1.0|I'm wondering if she read the script before taking this role because it's the low spot of Cherlze Theron's career
1451613512|5.0|This one of the honest account of history that is denied to Americans unless they go out of their way to find. Oliver Stone is a true American who loves this country but it doesn't mean we have to be the dominating empire of the world by repeatedly going into damaging wars.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|I found the book very well written. It starts simply enough but as Harold´s pilgrimage continues, a series of very deep feelings and attitudes begin to surface. Makes you wonder about the things that are left unsaid ant the ones uttered that can cause so much pain and misery....and about loyalty and betrayal....and about the resilience oh the human spirit.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|This series is MUST TV!  Worth it just for the history story, but much more entertaining than most series.  The costumes are works of art and the actors are great!  I recommend the entire series!
B006LSZECO|1.0|This book may be well written, but the characters in the book are just vile. When I thought it couldn't get worse, it did. I could not recommend this book to anyone.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Just good entertainment. A fine story line with a great cast and visually brings the books to life,form the wall to Winterhaven its as if they filmed it on location
B0015DYIH2|3.0|Somewhat sappy in plot . Characters-particularly heroine a bit  undeveloped.  I've read a lot better in the young adult genre.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|But since the new update I've been stuck in a 'new update available visit app store loop'  if that could bee fixed I could go back to really enjoying the game.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I wanted a reader like my Kindle Fire for my Nexus 10; I tried CoolReader but didn't like the interface, same for the Aldiko reader.  This has search by book or author and a look I like.
B00CHI5F5S|3.0|decent plot- weak spots - love interest, placing bug in gansgter's house,<br />luke warm character development -<br />great &#34;shoot em ups&#34; and explosions, great sets<br />decent acting
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|While I haven't finished the book I think is interesting to observe for yourself if we really  create our experiences or just our experiences are given to us to learn to accept what is coming and trust in our Infinite self.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|In a way I'm lucky I banished cable from my home. I've been hearing about this great series for years now and when we finally finished our last marathon (Battlestar Galactica and a few others) we picked up the first series of this. It's been awesome so far. We don't usually watch sit coms but these characters are just so compelling.
B004SIP8SY|5.0|For a hot chic, she sure pushes the limit on killing the bad guys.  AND the bad guyss are really bad.
B00992CF6W|5.0|A good game good controls great graphics for a game on a hand held device.  I did not know what to put here
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|For $35 it's a bargain.  It was a very easy setup. Works great from my Galaxy 3 phone.  Works well from my computer, but I think the clarity is better from my phone.  You can continue to use your phone and computer and even turn them off and Chromecast continues to work.<br /><br />Negatives:  Can't control the device from your TV set. =<br /><br />Pros:  Easy setup (basically plug and play)<br />Virtually plug and play<br />Always available from phone or computer<br />Control Cast from cellphone or computer<br />Allows me to take advantage of languuage vidoes on Youtube.<br /><br />Cons:  Sometimes videos get stuck in the loop and turning off TV, unpuggling dongle does not help to turn off videos.<br />Need two USB outlets (inlets?) so device can charge itself
B004MPEFBE|5.0|It's a great ending to an epic story, there are plenty of things to love about this movie. Harry Potter journey ends here in a truly heroic tale!
B001VEE5KK|5.0|I loved this movie.  Kate Winslet, Ralph Fiennes, and David Kross all give outstanding performances.  I was especially impressed with the performance by Mr. Fiennes, who had less on-screen time than I was expecting.  The Reader really stays with you, long after having watched it.  This film is about much more than a teenager's crush on a beautiful, older woman.  Although the coming-of-age aspect of the movie works well, the consequences of actions not taken reverberate intensely in the second half of this film.  Don't miss this one!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Ok I love this game I play this game mostly everyday bit it needs updates bad like for real One more thing I think that if they update minecraft pocket eddition then more people would buy it and maybe people would switch to this game. Update
B00A2YAY3C|4.0|It is a good movie that accurately represents parts of the battle.  Lot of big names stars before they were achieved movie star status
B000FC12Z0|5.0|This book is amazing for mystery fans, and even for those who prefer other genres. It is one of those books that make you want to read more and more books, regardless if they are the same genre or not. The plot is so intricate and near impossible to understand, as so typical of Agatha Christie's books, yet when Poirot actually explains how the murder took place it makes you feel a little stupid, for how the facts were so obvious and only reasoning was needed. In the end, this book keeps you on the edge until the last chapter, with Poirot changing ideas about how the murder was committed. Highly recommended.
B0010T75W6|5.0|The songs are the best,<br /><br />Forgive me for I did not know<br />for I was just a boy and you were so much more<br /><br />Than any god could ever plan<br />more than a woman or a man
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This movie was good. I think if I would've actually really rated it, it would've received 4 1/2 stars because Gru left the girls to steal the moon and he almost lost them for good if a minion hadn't put the dance recital ticket in Gru's pocket. But other than that I enjoyed it so I gave it a 5 anyways.
B007Q35PLI|5.0|The entire cast is fantastic and the movie is eye-opening to the world of autism. Temple's story is so moving. A movie everyone should see!
B008PE9GSA|5.0|These guys are the best, from the early blues years through MTV years & now back again sounding great for their age.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|This movie was very enjoyable for our whole family. Action, love, humor, it was all there. We would watch again!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I liked the story but it; had way to many four letter words. I almost put it down after the first few chapters
B005PK56TA|5.0|This was literally the best show I have ever seen. I have never loved a show so much or gotten so connected to the characters. And I think I've re-watched the season at least 10 times. It's amazing!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I loved the story line, but had to get past the language. I don't care to read so many four letter words
B00821OX98|5.0|This series is very well done. I like the characters and the relationships between them. All three seasons so far have been exciting.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|The story was great once I got past my revolution of the language. I don't like the four letter words
B0091REZMW|1.0|so I have been playing this game for quite some tome but after dealing with countless issues of it freezing I decided to take a break.  now about a month later I decided to give it a try to see if they had fixed the bugs.  to my surprise even though I'm using the same device and never deleted the app ive lost all my progress!  from level 150(ish) to level 1. it obviously recognized me because the old listings from my wall are still there but my coins diamonds collections and level are all gone<br /><br />its a fun game but apparently they don't like it when you take a break. this app will be getting deleted
B00992CF6W|5.0|How do you get the updates? I love the game besides that it's very fun and entertaining, very addicting and enjoyable
B005BGBPBG|5.0|Great!! It was a wonderful movie that portrayed the life of normal people in the shambles of love! Definitely worth watching, buy it!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|A great game! does not even take forever at all. way way way better than temple run because has great new items and is very fun, more camera affects witch means you can see more clear! And really the truth is well let me get to the point.... ITS A AWESOME GAME!!!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|For anyone who is looking for a game to do when you are bored, this is one of those games. And it doesnt require internet!
0920668372|5.0|I never read this as a kid but it was a great gift and they were happy to I'm happy. Best book deals on Amazon and usually free shipping!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Really? This is a pain considering I have spent over 50.00 during my 70 levels. Very disappointed with the overall ability to continue a free game that wasted my cash.
B005544V6A|5.0|Had no idea how great this show was.  My Dad mentioned it, but I never watched it.  With Amazon Prime I just watched the whole first season.  It's a show you can't miss...watch it.
B009WUAK2M|3.0|Good performance by the usual suspects. Not the most complicated plot, but entertaining nonetheless. Plenty of action and some memorable lines.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|i hate drama but this one was sweet nice to watch  I need to start from season one to get a better under standing
0385535147|5.0|A can't put me down novel !! Same here i have said what i wanted to say nothing more nothing less!
0141316047|5.0|All my children are adults. When they left home, our several copies of \\"Charlotte's Web\\" disappeared. One of my grandkids said something the book. It wasn't on any of our bookshelves, so I went to the source of all things important,  Amazon.com, and found a 50th Anniversary edition, reasonably priced. The book is hardback, in perfect condition, and I immediately read it. What a pleasure it is to have this beloved classic on the library shelves again so we can take it down and read it to the youngest family members.
B008AIGWVA|5.0|My son wanted this for his Kindle Fire. It downloaded and installed easy. He likes it quite a bit. It is funny! I would recommend it.
B009ZZDNT6|2.0|When it worked it was nice to wake up to.  One time the sound was so soft I didn't hear it for awhile. Another time it didn't go off at all.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Nothing groundbreaking but a decent sit-down-with-popcorn movie. Not a cinematic masterpiece but I would recommend it to my friends. If you are looking for a good Sunday movie, this is it.
0316077046|5.0|THIS BOOK SERIES GOT ME HOOKED IN SO EASILY, IT WAS INTERESTIMG RIGHT FROM THE START, THE UNIQUENESS AND THE DETAILS MAKE THESE BOOKS MESMERIZING!! I LOVE THEM AND I SAY EVERYONE SHOULD READ THEM!! BECAUSE YOU WILL EXPERIENCE A WHOLE DIFFERENT WORLD DIFFERENT THAN OURS THATS JUST BREATH TAKINGLY BEAUTIFUL!! READ THEM AND TRY NOT TO FORGET TO SLEEP AND EAT LIKE I DID ;)
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Today I went on and it said go to app store. Nothing happened and can't get on Organ Trail. Game was better without update.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|Quality in delivery over computer outstanding, it was just as good as watching it in the movie theater, as I had my computer connected to my big screen TV.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This is the last of these reviews I am going to make because to push for a number of words shouldn't be necxessary.  The star ratinbg says it all as far as I am concerned.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|i almost cried reading book it touched my heart.....the characters are so real and their love for eachother. You can just about visualize what these characters look like. You need to read this book..you will laugh at there remarks and you will cry. It makes your problems look not as bad . My prayers go to those who have cancer and those who have died battling cancer...god has gained many angels.
B008602KQI|5.0|I've watched this movie 3 times and I'll watch it 3 more :-) I can't wait for the next one to come out in theaters.
B00AEBB8YW|4.0|A very sweet movie. I really enjoyed it and love the story line. It was recommended by a friend and he wasn't wrong.
1623360277|5.0|I am 69 YO and allergic to many meds and so am hoping to stay well and not need any meds. This is a great book that is easy to read and understand. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a lifestyle change to better health.
B00AEFY66U|3.0|I bought this because I recently saw &#34;The Great Gatsby&#34; with Leonardo DiCaprio and must say I love the new one better. It's soooo good. This one is ok. My sis-in-law liked this one better so I guess everyone has different tastes.
B008FTAAG2|5.0|Apparently I have alot of catching up to do in the female metal department. It's an area I totally ignored and that ignorance now seems unforgivable. But listening to this album will help me get over that. I first heard Maria's voice on 5FDP's new album, with the song Anywhere But Here. The 2nd version of the song, the one where she and Ivan perform it like a duet, is the one that got me interested in Maria Brink. Her presence really amplifies that song and my curiosity was peaked. I then started doing my homework and knew I had to get into this band. But where to start? Logic dictates at the beginning with their first album, but I decided to forego logic and go with instinct. I'm glad I did as I love this album and have been listening to it for a week straight as of this writing. I will of course get all thes rest of their albums at some point. I'm really drawn in by Maria's voice, she's like a hot, metal singing siren. She has a unique voice and is very talented, she can belt it out and scream with the best of them. I absolutely love Blood, Adrenalize, Whore, You're Gonna Listen, Burn, Beast Within, Comance and definitely don't have a song that I don't like on here. Haven't skipped anything in my week of listening yet and don't plan to. Great album, great sound, love Maria and can't wait to hear the earlier stuff to see how the band progressed to where they are now. Lesson well learned for me!!!
0679745203|5.0|Sensuous and Mysterious.  This book transports you back in time and gives you a tale of many pleasures.  Intelligent writing.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Im prolly one of the few people who havent seen Despicable Me. Game looked fun, it is, and now im going to see the movies.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|Darius Rucker has done it again. I haven't stopped listening to this CD since I received it in the mail. Love all the songs. He's a terrific entertainer!
8866137480|5.0|I love my planner! The pages are great to write on, the organization is easy-to-use, and I love the peanuts design!
0345803485|5.0|Very much as I expected the books to be. Very good almost new without any marks or anthibg wrong with book.
B00BNWWVFG|5.0|Wow if you want a movie to keep you on the edge of you're seat this is it. You won't really know till the end of the movie who the bad person is.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|I was very happy with this movie. I'd recomend this movie to anyone with a heart. It's definqtly a movie I'd watch again.
B00CLZ4B4I|5.0|My children, ages 9 and 7, LOVE this movie.  There is one scene that sort of scared my 7 year old the first time she watched the movie, but now she watches it at least once a week by herself.  My husband and I both like it very well too, so it's a great one to watch as a family. I highly recommend this one!
034580404X|5.0|Came as expected, one book does have a dent but thats part of shipping. I was impe<br />Resisted with it completely.
B006HH5Y6K|5.0|Marc Bolen had it right! So sorry he passed at such a young age.......... Still moves me, A True Planet Queen!
B00BWYX2MG|3.0|Tried this on several gloves I use riding my motorcycle.  It works but doesn't seem to last very long.  One pair of gloves it did not work on which is a mystery.  Not overly impressed and seems very expensive for how well it works
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love the app but my only concern is that i cannot update it to 0.7.2 or 0.7.3<br />Also check out chrisandthemike on you tube he is so awesome
B0017SWPXY|4.0|A true delight. You feel you are there observing the world through Enzo's ( the main character/ the dog) eyes.
1847940684|3.0|Good examples and I could adapt some of the principles, but hierarchical roles in medicine make this not as useful as I aha
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think this game is the best out of all &#34;temple run&#34; style games. Lots of bonuses and mini games
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I like the game because it had enough variety in the games to keep it interesting. The dialogs can be long but once I figured out I can touch the screen to speed them along, it was much better.  MA2 is better than the first because it does not have a limit on 'misses' so you can touch the screen as much as possible. My 4 not 5 is only because the 'save' point is the end of each chapter, so that means you may have to do some of the chapter games over if you quit in the middle of a chapter.  I also like the unlimited tips even if I did have to wait penalty seconds before getting the next hint.  I got the game free during Amazon app of the day, and will probably purchase the first MA even with some of it's limitations (like number of touch penalties).  I will probably play this again in a few months since there are so many games in the full story I am sure to forget many of the hidden object locations. ha.
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|Helps one trying to improve old ways of thinking (I.e. learned from parents) and to improve your attitude toward life.
B004CRR9G0|5.0|Epic adventure with a timely environmental message.  Typical of Miyazaki it features a strong, well developed heroine that both Japanese and American culture would do well to follow by example.
B009VL28W2|5.0|Having seen them in concerts in person I felt like this Blu Ray concert really captured the essence of a a great Metallica show.  They really are the best live band out there in my humble opinion.  You may disagree, but for me Metallica sets the bar, and this Blu Ray helps to illustrate why.  An excellent live performance with a great set list with attitude and a little bit of theatricality goes a long way.  The HD looks really good here and the sounds is crystal.  If your a fan, or if you are just someone looking for a great concert Blu Ray pick this one up!
B00CL8D83U|5.0|As a fan of almost thirty years, I may be biased, but I think these guys are amazing. Pop music does not get any better than The Pet Shop Boys. Electric is the album we fans have been waiting for, although never disappointed, for years. When &#34;Axis&#34; was first released, I knew something special was coming. The third release is imminent soon, my favorite track on the album, &#34;Love Is A Bourgeois Construct&#34;, which inevitably gets me on my feet! I saw The Boys back in 2002 on their Release Tour, which was very low key, but now I'll be seeing them here in Boston next moth at The House Of Blues. The Electric Tour (per YouTube) looks amazing!
B000NDMRCS|5.0|Excellent movie and gives you cause to think.  Afterall our world is experiencing global warming and we need to think about how to sustain our earth.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The grandkids (4yrs and 7yrs) light up while playing the game!<br />And amazonly mimick the movie characters during the adventure<br />of the game!!
B008I43DYU|4.0|have this on my iphone and use it frequently when at the hardware store with my husband.  now my kindle will be just as good to have along
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This book touched me. The stories are everyone's stories and the wisdom throughout the book stays with you.<br />I could not put it down as I needed to know what happened to each and every one of the characters who were interwoven through parallel stories. Readable and meaningful...this book makes you think about your own life and relationships.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|if u like jet pack joy ride you'll love this super high pace non stooped.action thriller game yes sir that is the best
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Pretty good game. Gets a bit laggy when you've been playing for a very long time but that takes hours. That being said... I've played for hours. Seriously.<br />It's a lot of fun. I like that you can earn gems without having to pay.
B003ZJ70W4|3.0|I don't think it was as exciting as the first one although the ending brought me back in.  It was okay
0307266303|4.0|It sad to say that it took me around 2 years to get to this well known book (long queue), and with more than 1000 online reviews I'll try to provide my concise and honest opinion.<br /><br />As everyone already knows (either from the book itself or from other media coverage) the authors went to Mexico to learn about a tribe of natural born runners. The Tarahumara tribe use to run from place to place and can cover up to 300 km in a single session. Moreover, they use to run barefoot or with very primitive sandals made out of car tires.<br /><br />The author describes his adventures to finding the tribe, talks about their running abilities, some scientific discussion on barefoot running, and the climax of the book is a weird ultra-marathon that was arranged with few of the elite western ultra-marathoners and couple of runners from that tribe (together with Christopher McDougall, the author).<br /><br />The story is very interesting and novel, especially as the extreme sport of \\"Ultra-marathon\\" is not well known to most people. The writing style is light and entertaining, and I'm sure the book will appeal both to runners and couch potatoes.<br /><br />The one thing that bothers me is the \\"strong\\" scientific statement the author use to justify his main thesis (that we were born and evolved to run). For instance, he concludes that the Homo-sapience prevailed in the evolutionary race (over the Neanderthals) due to its running abilities. Without getting into details, to the best of my knowledge this is *not* the common thought in the scientific community. Also, with respect to the bare-foot running the author presents only evidence that supports his thesis and does not give (any) room to the other side of the argument. So, before throwing away your expensive shoes, please do some more reading about the bare-foot running debate. The book tells only half of it.<br /><br />Anyway, putting the scientific side aside, the book is highly recommended. I'll give it 4 stars due to the scientific parts, but the story telling part is well worth the 5.e scientific parts, but the story telling part is well worth the 5.
B00CQGU9GG|3.0|Its great to have all this music in one place at a good price. The packaging is cheap cardboard sleeves in a cheap cardboard box. No notes book or extra tracks. Sound quality is ok but nothing special. lots of great songs. What do you expect for 10 cds for $40?
B00E7PQVHK|4.0|I have the original Kindle Fire.  Originally this game would crash during the initial loading.  Version 1.1 seems to have fixed that!  I like the gameplay very much.  The story is nothing special.  My biggest complaint about it is that the touch controls are often poor.  I'll tap the left side of the screen and my character will move right.  It doesn't harm anything it's just irritating.  Also, I would just like a little improvemnt in battle as well.  You have to be very precise with your moves.  Still fun, just occasionally frustrating.  Maybe future updates will fix this too!
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Denzel is a great actor who often gets placed in medicore movies. This one is good from start to finish. Special effects and chillingly real for anyone who flies a lot.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I loves this game. It is so much fun to play. It is also super easy too. You will love it.
B000T00PE2|4.0|Angels off of this album is in the movie &#34;Snatch&#34;<br /><br />Teardrop is why I actually bought this album because the Tiesto remix was really good.
B00EE3FTNM|4.0|The first episode is slow moving and heavy on drama, understandable considering the subject matter. The pace is necessary to set up the primary characters. I understand the same case will be arched over the entire season. There will probably also be subplots that British teledramas are notorious for.
1451695195|5.0|This book is magnificent! Some of the people writing ignorant reviews here have missed the point of this book. It never ceases to amaze me how so many people find so many things to try and discredit an author----one who took the time and effort to write down his very personal experience in the form of a memoir.<br />I believe it's a sign of our times when people just cannot hold anything in their life anymore as truth. Very sad indeed I say.<br /><br />Thank you so much Dr. Alexander for writing your story.  I recommend this book to anyone who feels they actually do have a soul, and wants to read an inspiring story that will leave you feeling wonderful.<br /><br />Buy this book, download it, share it, whatever...but definitely read it! You'll feel so much better after you finish it, and remember, most people don't write their very personal stories thinking they are going to embellish them....they write them because they had an experience that moved them so profoundly that they had to write it.<br /><br />I am grateful to this author for sharing his story.
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|this is a shark week app and you go around as a shark and try to eat scuba divers. feeds into the misconception and htsteria that big sharks want to eat people, they don't.
B00B9366VO|5.0|It takes people like Dave Grohl, people with the time and money to see value in the obsolete, to make us all see the value in everything that technology has passed over and left behind.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|His best to date the multiple stories which were all tied together over along time and widespread  venues were the best I have seen  everyone looking for a good read will enjoy this fine story
B00E8B1P9M|5.0|I loved this movie, it was great action and Rock is fun to watch. I look forward to part III if their is one.
B000FC1192|5.0|I really really really loved this book! This book made me feel like I could read this book over and over again! :)
B0054LJGWS|5.0|The premise sounded a bit far out, even though I'm a bit Neil Gaiman fan, so I kept putting this one off.  It was the best yet - it made me really think about the Bible, good vs. evil, the apocalypse, and laugh.  The authors' use of the English language tickled my funny bone and just delighted me.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Addictive, fun, just wish it had more scenery. Otherwise I find it to be very entertaining and funny. Like the upgrades.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|A very thought provoking book on life and death and on living in a perpetual life of pain, agony, and frustration.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I just finished  50 Shades of Grey and found it \\"interesting.\\"  I am a senior and know almost all of the terminology although having tried only one or two.  I say \\"interesting\\" because it is.  I feel the descriptions of Ana and her \\"orgasms\\" (again, i use the word lightly) are just - well - interesting (like in sseing-a-shrink interesting).  In other words, it doesnt take her long - in fact a thought can do it.  Now wait just a minute here!!!!  I was VERY disappointed in the ending - it just stops without any explanation of the many questions and doubts I had.  But then - aha - i discovered that the second book must be read to do that.  And I am sure this book will end into having to read the 3rd one to put all of this mish mash together.  I would not recommend this book to any age reader.  It is false leading to think orgasms come and go at the drop of someone \\"biting their lip.\\"  Ana says doesnt want pain, so although she constantly asks for it on almost every page.  Her \\"please\\" is getting a little annoying.  But -- like some -- I will read the next two.  I cant see either of them any more confusing than the first one.  But maybe I will be able to figure out this \\"interesting\\" author.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I really liked the old version. This new one is not as user friendly. The maps are not as easy to use, and I don't care for the &quot;cartoony&quot; look to it. Please bring back the other one.
B00D6SBOWG|3.0|Have this app on my iPhone and love it.  This version needs to be updated to reflect the sheer awesomeness of this game.  I still play this version but it needs some work.
B004CLYKLI|5.0|I could not put the book down. Probably, I was aspiring tiger mother; at least I recognized responsibility for my children's future. But from the beginning I tried to invent games and activities, but never was good at forcing a disciplined approach.<br />There is no one-size-fits-all recipe to parenting, I am sad to discover. And there is no guarantee that any approach will work, but I admire Amy Chua for her courage to think for herself, search, try, recognize what works and what doesn't, and accept the costs.
B008OOYALE|4.0|I love playing this game n breeding dragons is awesome.  Feeding n playing with them is fun n evolving them is great too.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love using the weather channel.  Not sure I like the newest format.  Can't seem to find some of the same things I used to use.  But I do like the prize option now.  Some of the options I can't find to get the points everyday.  Even though I still love love the app.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I for one never grew up a 'trekkie'.  I saw a couple of the movies, namely 2 and 3 in the original series, and caught the Borg movie with the Next Generation cast.  Thought they were all good.  Thought this one was great, too.  The special effects are mind blowing, I saw it in the theater in 3D and it was pretty damn amazing.  Since I don't have any recollection of the original cast members, I'm not all caught up in how things \\"should be\\".  I don't think it's a bad thing that a guy like Abrams is trying to reach a wider audience.
B00821OX98|5.0|The writing is superb, there are twists enough to keep one on the edge of your seat, the acting is awesome. This feels alot more like a movie franchise than it does a TV series. Gritty, real,scary, thought-provoking and I am SO addicted to it ! I watched the entire first season & half the second season in one night. :) HIGHLY recommended~
B000001FLA|5.0|Last good job of Studio Ynguie Malmsteen, along with the first few, starting his work did not give the inspiration that these albums had.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I gave it four stars because I liked it very much.  It was exciting from beginning to end. It would also be good for young teens to read as it was wholesome and evil still lost in the end.  I did not give it a five because while it was very well written, it is not a masterpiece in literature.  However, it was good escapism and I recommend it highly!
B00942Y4IY|5.0|Very good quality, seamless streaming, I like Amazon Prime. It is worth what you pay annually. I will use it more
B00942Y4IY|4.0|Good story. Clever idea. James Spader is perfect as a quiet but confident intellectual. Kurt Russell does a good job as the commander of the team who is struggling after the death of his kid. Again, definitely worth watching.
1433521784|5.0|First I really love the feel of the cover.  I like how this will lay open flat when reading at a desk or table.  The cover and the stitching are very high quality making this bible worth every penny.<br /><br />Even more than the cover which there are several kinds that you can choose from for the ESV Study Bible, the content is just amazing.  There is more in here than I ever expected from a study bible.  I highly recommend getting this study bible even if you just want to get the hard cover.  The ESV is an excellent version that is easy to read.
B00985E3UG|4.0|I enjoyed the book, though I really wouldn't say it had any giant revelations. I like that Moss was able to convey that the problems really are more complex than just reduce the amounts of salt, sugar and fat. As Moss points out, calories are cheap and for processed foods to be appealing, they need vast amounts of salt, sugar and fat. Because processed food calories are cheap, they do end up feeding a large percentage of the population. Eating healthy consistently is almost a matter of wealth (not quite yet, but that is the way the world is turning). Government cannot be expected to regulate in the US because it is complicit with the food companies in a variety of ways for a variety of reasons. Enforcement of regulation is expensive and costs are passed on to the consumer etc. There is a lot of credit given to the notion that the food companies are creating demand for their products by creating \\"bliss points\\" and \\"mouth feel\\" etc. That may give a consumer preference for one processed product over another (therefore competitive advantage), but the reality in my mind is economic. I'm not convinced that processed foods are that hard to avoid; if you can afford it. Well worth a read.
B00BRUQ7ZY|2.0|The author presents a different perspective of the life of Christ but in doing so avoids the Gospel according to St. John, which bears witness to faith and is intended to strengthen faith.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I expected this to be bad and it wasn't. Tom is still the king of the big budget movie. The story-line never stalled and the pacing was great.
B00A2FSXHK|5.0|I think this is the perfect example of a film adaptation holding to the original story's feel/focus/thrust while still *adapting* the plot for its own narrative and cultural purposes. No, the movie does not stay true to P Dick's storyline, but it holds true in all the ways that matter. Most of the story's general concerns are present and done so in a way that is more in keeping with the different culture that exists in the 21st century as compared to the mid-20th when the story was written. The acting, of course, was great, as were the special effects and editing. Let's face it, it's hard to go wrong with Spielberg.
B0086700CM|4.0|Great game of dexterity set in a jungle with some seriously ticked off apes - game play is fast and furious and mistakes are costly.  A very fun game that has caught on - not my favorite but a great way to spend 10 minutes.
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|If you never read graphic novels before , start with this one. Forget about stupid film, read the comics. If you already read it, start again.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|If you haven't heard of this game yet you need to serious re-evaluate your life plan.  Simple puzzle/action game that is too much fun and EVEN BETTER without all those annoying ads :]
B000Q9ISSQ|5.0|This book made me laugh out loud more than any other I've read in recent years. My husband would get annoyed with me as I tried to contain my giggles while he was trying to sleep! I love Bryson's writing style and if you have ever visited Australia, are just about to visit, or are indeed Australian, you will love this book.<br /><br />As a Brit who's lived in Australia for six years and recently taken up Australian citizenship, I found this book was spot on when it comes to looking at this country from an outsider's perspective. The sometimes just, sometimes fanciful, fear of all the deadly creatures that live here, the vast space, the Aussies' no-nonsense but always friendly and laid back attitude, were all things I could relate to.<br /><br />You don't have to have been to all the places he mentions to enjoy the book by any means, but I think it's fair to say that the more you can share in his experiences the more you'll get out of it. You may not agree with every depiction - his disparaging outlook on the little town of Macksville, halfway between Brisbane and Sydney, which he can only imagine people being pleased to have arrived in if it was the &#34;only place on earth not underwater,&#34; was hilariously funny, although we regularly enjoy a great meal in The Star pub there on our travels between Sydney and Brisbane and think it's a nice country town. Bryson somehow manages to depict it as a dump, but does so in an affectionate and jokey manner so that even if you're born and bred in Macksville you'd be unlikely to take any offence.<br /><br />But it's not all light-hearted and fun - he delves into the &#34;uncomfortable&#34; topic of Australia's history and treatment, past and present, of the Aboriginal community and asks some tough questions that he can't get answers to.<br /><br />Bryson's love for Australia and its people is evident throughout the book, and in the main he praises everywhere he goes. As any foreigner knows if they've been here, the Aussies are very keen to know that you like it here and often their first question is about what you think of their town/city/country. If you like it, you can go on to say anything you want about it - the Aussies are very good at laughing along with you.
B002FOQY2M|3.0|We bought this one for our daughter after she fell in love with Some Nights - it was fun to see the progression but more or less a forgettable disc.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|What can I say, I'm a Whedon groupie.  He seems to have a special talent for putting a team of people together to tell his story in such a compelling and endearing way.  There was something particularly great about the chemistry on Firefly.  It is rare when you can feel a connection to a character--like you really know and like them, not just for their strengths (that are easy to admire) but also for their failings and frailties.  To get attached to a character as if they're family or friends, so that you actually miss them when they're gone--that is a special talent...that is SO Joss.  BTW--Colbert bump is the reason for the re-visiting of Firefly.  It was great seeing Joss but it made me miss Mal and his band of outlaws.
B001D08CRY|4.0|So I bought this for a pie recipe that was on the show, when Carmela brought the Rigot pie to Jeannie Cusamano's sister to convince her to write a recommendation for Meadow.  I made this pie for a contest at work.  It did not win the contest, but I did not expect it to either.  It was very different.<br /><br />I look forward to trying more of the recipes.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I loved this book. The writing is great and I became invested in all the characters. I was sad to be finished and wish there really was a Circus like this.
B0083DJUMA|5.0|A eye-opening look at what's next and how it will change your community. See how the physical world is going the way of the web Highly recommended!
B00DU74U74|3.0|There was more kissing and less action than i thought there would be. I was slightly underwhelmed.  It was ok.
B006LSZECO|1.0|The book started out pretty good. The story kept your interest until about half way through. The ending is so unbelievable and leaves you feeling like you wasted your time and money. Choose something else!
B00874T02K|5.0|I developed a six pack massive pecks, and iron biceps because of 4 weeks of this app. GET IT NOW!!!
B00BAYLQI0|5.0|I bought this for my girlfriend's birthday.  We had seen this movie at the theater together and it was the best movie either of us had seen in a very long time.
0399159347|4.0|This is the first time I've ever read anything by Liane Moriarty. I thought this was going to be more of a chick-lit/beach read book but it turned out to be a very interesting novel that was unexpectedly heavier than I originally thought. (As other reviewers have given detailed plot descriptions I won't do so here- but let's just say this book does deal with some serious subjects). This book is well written with characters that are very likeable and with a plot line that unwinds slowly but with surprises around every corner. It is hard to put down, even once you find out what the husbands secret is. And the Epilogue was wonderful- satisfied the question of \\"but then what?\\" to some degree.
B00361HV02|5.0|Black Rebel Motorcycle Club is the best, and you will know if by the first three songs in this album.
0679805273|5.0|I have purchased and given this book to babies and adults, graduating students from high school and college.  Its &#34;point&#34; never gets dull.  I have half a dozen right now that are just waiting for the next event to be shared.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|The first 3/4 summarizes Aslan's interpretation of the results of his extensive research. The final  quarter digs into those resources and will be tedious to the casual reader.
1490313370|5.0|Nothing new can be written but the delivery can be presented in a format to get your attention and motivation.  James Altucher has done both.  Shame on you if you cannot find 10 times the purchase price in just one idea that you may know but have forgotten to use lately.  Tacking action is the message.<br /><br />The chapter on being an “Idea Machine” truly works.  We get dull thinking as we grow successful or old or both and this was a refreshing reminder to get back to the task of thinking for ideas.  It Works.<br /><br />I did find disagreement with the book in several places, but then I found that thinking through our differences strengthened my beliefs, so it was a good thing.  We must be will to have our most cherished beliefs challenged.<br /><br />It would be easy to write in this review a “You SHOULD do” list to make myself feel good and show you that I know everything, but I’ll leave that high level of perfect knowledge to my 10 year old daughter.  LOL<br /><br />Buy the book and then actually READ THE BOOK.  You will find yourself better for doing it.
B005LJETYI|4.0|Pretty great short read, enjoyable and doesn't get bogged down in techno-speak or silly plot twists.  Only negatives I'd comment on are somewhat unsatisfactory ending and some uneven pacing and jumps.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I has to restart game after reaching level 65.  lost everything even the cash items. do not waste your time. I gives it no stars.
1594203334|5.0|Entertaining and insightful! A must read for Francophile American parents.  Loved the anecdotes of Parisian life and culture.  Insightful ideas and practical advice though gets very generalized at times, maybe stereotypical, when reviewing American parenting.  But so fun to read!
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|Pretty good movie.  I would not have paid the $14+ to buy this movie.  Was kind of fun but is lacking something but I'm unable to put my finger as to the missing piece.
B008Y6YCB0|3.0|the english accent was hard to understand sometimes but the story was interesting for the time period. I enjoyed Gweynth Paltrow and the others in the cast made it enjoyable.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Waste of time..... Watch redtube instead!  There was no story to read.... A time killer yes but definitely not food for thought.
B000SW2ER2|3.0|It's all right to have sci-fi movies that aren't \\"shoot 'em up blast the aliens\\" flicks, so the leisurely unrolling of this movie didn't bother me.  What was irksome was the idiotic behavior of George Clooney's character, Kelvin.  He plays a shrink sent to a space station to investigate what a friend of his there said were things he couldn't describe.  The question is: why not?<br /><br />This is spoiler territory coming up.  Some alien presence, or the planet itself, is replicating people out of the space station's crew's memories.  When the initial call for help went out, why didn't the commander simply present the \\"visitor\\" he had and say, \\"Look, I left this person behind on earth months or trillions of miles ago, and here he is standing right next to me.\\"  Further, why would these replicants cause insanity in the crew?  Genuine puzzlement and fear, certainly.  But lunacy?<br /><br />The owner of the space station sent out a security team to the station, which was never heard from again.  Why?  The movie never refers to it again, except once in passing.  Did they die, go crazy and crash into the strange planet below, what?<br /><br />And the star, Kelvin, who is initially shocked to see his dead wife suddenly beside him there in the middle of nowhere, gradually comes to accept her presence and even to fall in love with her.  Did he fall off his rocker and bang his head on a spaceship tailfin?  He knows his wife is dead, surmises that this creature near him is some sort of alien concoction, and then defends her and wishes to return to earth with her.  Gordon, the physicist and the only person who makes any sense in this movie, is dead set against that, for understandable reasons.<br /><br />There's an underlying theme of forgiveness and second chances running here.  The creations themselves realize that they're not the originals, and yet they are true copies of the crew's memories.  They're also indestructible, or rather self-healingly immortal, which poses an apparent problem at the end.  But the alien force evidently takes this into consideration and, well, shall we say that love conquers all?  That even an incomprehensible force wishes to aid humans?  I wonder if an eternity with no escape will be as satisfying to the couple in question as the two think it will be.<br /><br />This is really a two star movie, but I gave it three for its high-value production and for attempting something a little out of the ordinary.  There are elements of Moon and Event Horizon here, but the movie does try to be a different kind of smoke.  Also factored in is the suspicion that my disgust with the reactions of most of the movie's characters might have overshadowed some of its subtleties.
B005IQ5H7M|4.0|Typical quirky Vonnegut story. Entertaining to read and moves along quickly. If you liked Galapagos, you'll like this one as well.
B0074QGGK6|4.0|Short and sweet wish there was more. I liked it. I thought the ideas were useful for many areas if life not just creative endeavors .
B00DU74U74|3.0|I like the characters and storyline although I wish the movie could have shown more of the survivors story. The end is believable. Overall it was entertaining with no real expectant twists and turns.
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|They had the story line and the actors to make this an epic. It just took too long to develop and the connections<br />just seemed not to fit in the end. Cloud Hapless is my title and review for this film!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|The standard android keyboards have nothing on this.  It learns what you type and after a while will predict (correctly) the next work in your sentence so you just have to tap that word.  This saves a ton of keystrokes, I have it on my tablet and smartphone.
B00455IVHU|5.0|I'm not a huge Streisand fan but thought that the premise sounded interesting.<br /><br />I'm so glad I watched it. It is a sweet movie with stand out performancees by Lauren Bacall and Jeff bridges.<br /><br />I would really recommend this film.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the episodes in this series. The plots move along quickly and are laced with humor, tragedy, and adventure.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|McConaughey plus good writing - the screenplay only enhances Michael Connelly's book with great dialogue. - and the series of Mickey Haller books are always well written.
B004GYY714|5.0|My Fire HD did not support streaming from WWOZ. With TuneIn Radio I can easily listen to my favorite out-of-town stations.

B003QSS2VW|4.0|It is a nice story for Little girls to see. I watched with her and we both enjoy Disney movies,
B004R0WKNE|4.0|I thought this movie was good. Harrison Ford's performance was a little over the top, but was probably supposed to be that way.  I did laugh out loud a few times. Overall, I thought it was a cute movie.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|After reading this book, I can't wait for the 3rd book to come out. I was an easy read, kept me wondering.
B000FC10IO|5.0|Well worth the read. As with the Keys to the Kingdom, Nix leaves us an ending both sorrowful and hopeful.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Such a good series! Kept me turning the pages! Can't wait for the movie and the next book to come out!
B005EWDA3I|4.0|Third book is a quite different from the first two and rounds off the story in typical HM fashion - very enjoyable.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Such a good series! Kept me turning the pages! Can't wait for the movie and the next book to come out!
B00BEJ5O6Q|1.0|Save your money, one one song on the CD.<br /><br />Love the song, but come on one song when all other artists have at least 7 or more.  That is my last purchase of Blake Shelton, even tho I loved the song........save my money

B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Great cast, great characters great storyline. Storyline kept me on edge through the whole series and I was disappointed when it came to an end. This is one of the very few series that I would watch over again.
B000UZNRS2|5.0|If you're a fan of the Camel Club you'll love this one. It's really two stories in one book. Excellent. Loved every page to the very end.

B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It is a good game. It has everything I like in a game. Challenging and fun. The only thing I didn't like was once I downloaded the game and tried to play, it took another hour and a half to load all of the content. But overall once I got to play it, it was a great game

B005ZCXPP0|5.0|For those fans who love the Marvel movies, this one fell right into place and helped fit missing pieces into the eventual Avengers release.

B003O86FMW|5.0|A page turner with an unexpected twist. I couldn't put it down for long. Enjoyed the book a lot. Hope you like it too!
B00CFA222M|5.0|Of course the Title reminds me of the 1960's version Jack the Giant Killer. This film feels like its coming to a conclusion and then more of the story is told. Very good film.
B006ANJ4BW|3.0|It wasn't as good as the original but ok.  Still a good use of 2 hours.  I would watch it again.
B007H7XJD4|4.0|Henry Cavil does an excellant job, even his body was toned to exception. This film probably helped him in becoming Super Man. Henry is very handsome and the muscles that show in the Soper man outfit seem to be all his own.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|My husband and I did not see this movie when it came out at the theater but watched it first online and were so taken with it that we had to have the DVD so we can watch it whenever we want to.  It is wonderful!!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This show is something that will simultaneously stretch and engage your mind. There are many scenes of aesthetic beauty, heroism, and a gripping plot that guides this odd space family along on their journeys through barely travelled frontier of space. Whereas Buffy and to a lesser degree Angel were tied down to the moribund, overly familiar specifics of everyday life on earth, Firefly has no such artistic shackles and is able to fly as independent and freely as Captain Malcom Reynolds, its soaring voyages only restricted by the depths of the writers’ imagination.<br />Prepare for one of the shortest, sweetest, and tragically curtailed epics of the 21st century. And don’t forget to watch Serenity for the final act of this dramatic, genre-breaking show.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I got it on my 4th generation iPod touch and I realised it was so good I had to get it on my kindle fire HD too. Love this game
B000OJFV4C|4.0|I am a History Major and I study British History, so the whole time I was complaining about the inaccuracies.  It was entertaining, but if I wanted to watch a porno, I'd have just gone and done that.  I realize sex was important, but the first episode had 3 sex scenes in the first 30 minutes.  If sex is all you have to keep a show going, then you are in trouble.  It did get cleaned up a bit towards the end and started to get better.  I also didn't like how Henry VIII was immediately one of my hated characters.  I don't feel like they portrayed him correctly.  For the sake of entertainment, I would still recommend the show.  I did enjoy it, I just wish it was more historically accurate.

I have been looking for a book that identifies those who are generous and explains why they give and give and give.

An uplifting book with hundreds of powerful insights.

B00BU18U82|5.0|I love this app. If you have a good computer as well get this game for it there is FS 2009-2013 it is a great game on kindle ipod etc. Also on the pc.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I enjoyed the game until it prompted me to update at the app store. Once at the store it only gives me the option to open the game, and not update it. When I click to open the game it tells me to update (not allowing me to play)...and the cycle continues.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Not really a &quot;free&quot; game, another way to rip off the gamer. Screen with hidden objects can be too small and bard to see. It's not like the other hidden objects game that G5. Produces.
B005TBN3EU|1.0|If you loved the first movie, well, you're still probably not going to like this one. It's a huge let down after the first. Very similar plot, the characters are even more over the top (cartoon-ish even). I wouldn't recommend it and I thought the first movie was very funny.

B00ECUARO8|5.0|me and my girl had a family night. We all had decided to watch it and everyone of us loved it.course some of its not fit for a child to see but it wasn't all that bad at parts. Damn good movie.
6305428042|5.0|Fun for the whole family.  My own children enjoyed this when they were young, so I purchased it for my classroom (4th-6th grade) for the holiday season.  A bit of the humor is a little &#34;fresh&#34;, but it went over the kids' heads.  Enjoyable and very entertaining!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i liked this game alot :) it was fun and super addicting love it!! get this game especially since its free

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|After a nice, but kinda slow start, I am now Plowing through it, and LOVE it...I'm gonna recommend it to every friend I've got that reads, including on facebook.  Really good characters, and so far, even though I'm more than halfway, I can't figure out what's going to happen, something I can often do, because I read so much, and I really like NOT KNOWING!!!<br /><br />If this is the first book by Liane, I hope it sells well, so she'll write more, I really like the way she writes!!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I loved the thoughtful, descriptive language McKenna uses in &#34;Misremembered Man.&#34; It is a deeply moving book that shows the reader a transformation of a simple man waiting for his life to really begin after years of abuse, neglect and abandonment. Without pointing fingers or directing the reader to &#34;the reason&#34; the character has had struggles, McKenna allows the reader to accept the carefully layered childhood experience of the character with his current life, enabling the acceptance of good and bad and good vs. bad in the human experience.
B0000399WI|5.0|I didn't do it, a lawyer #@&*%^ me. Has to be one of the all time best prison movies ever.
B002DQLGHU|3.0|They left out so much from the book its almost hard to understand what is going on and how they figure things out. Read the book first and it will help you but also disappoint you.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I really like this game. It's just like the UNO you play with cards. The game is really addictive too. I find myself playing against my friends and forgetting what time it is.

B00821OX98|5.0|The story line is some times on the edge but overall good show.<br /><br />Would recommend to any SiFi buff to watch
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I think that this game is so much fun. I love the objective, and all the characters. I just hate how it gets so hard, like once I got trapped between 3 trains and they were moving towards me.
B006GWO5NE|1.0|No it did not fix my problem. The power cable is not the problem the kindle will still not charge and I can't get any one to help me. All my books are ony kindle and now I can't read them.

B00499QUK2|5.0|Benjamin Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman make a very convincing Sherlock and John Watson. Their physiques and personalities complement one another. Steven Moffat's take on the Doyle stories is modern yet sympathic to the originals. Wish there were another season.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|The show got its claws into me and never let go. I keep wanting to watch &#34;just one more&#34; to see what happens.
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|For fans of Les Mis, this is the movie to own: it is a fine drama in its own right, and surprisingly successful in putting across the larger-than-life 19th century romanticism and melodrama of Victor Hugo's original novel. Some things have to be said with more than words, and this musical says them. It has a big heart.<br /><br />In adapting it to the big screen, director Tom Hooper opted for quiet and intimate vocals rather than the full-throated Broadway style. Given this treatment, some of the songs have less impact, and at times their instrumental accompaniment is almost inaudible. But this style of \\"whisper-singing\\" is so great for the actors!<br /><br />Among a stellar cast, Hugh Jackman carries the show both vocally and dramatically. I was less convinced by Russell Crowe, whose singing was not up to snuff and whose characterization of Javert never quite came into focus for me. It was a pleasure to see (and hear) a shockingly deglamorized Anne Hathaway take huge chances and succeed wildly as the doomed Fantine; and casting the incredible, the beautiful, the hilariously funny, the totally twisted Helena Bonham-Carter as Madame Thenardier was a stroke of absolute genius.<br /><br />The ultimate test of any movie is what it leaves you with, and whether you want to see it again. For me, the redemptive conclusion of Les Miserables, after all that had come before, packed a huge wallop. It actually brought a tear to my eye, and what more can anyone want?
0553583182|5.0|I love this book, it is great , its a great reminder of what i already now, it is very helpful and focus deep on the logic of yourself

B00A2FSSHK|4.0|I think this one was underrated by a lot of folks.  Solid sci-fi that holds up pretty well.  HD quality on the stream was good too.
B0002KPIQY|5.0|...That Angelina Jolie was headed for greatness. A tragic story of how a young life was cut short by sudden fame.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I watched PBS Downton Abbey Season 3 episodes on TV as they were aired.  However, the HD quality of Amazon Prime's had me noting things I missed previously.  I watched every episode AGAIN!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I can't wait for the third book to come out.  I read the first one in scattered bits and pieces over several months and had difficulty keeping characters straight, but the compelling subplots always pulled me right back into the essence of the book.  When this second book came out, I read it straight through, grudgingly stopping for food and sleep.  I discovered that I still wasn't very good at keeping the characters straight--I guess my brain doesn't process Russian and German names very well--but the continuity of the story lines across generations was beautifully done.  I will read it again, and I am commending it to all of my friends.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Sense downloading it, I can not put it down. I have found it to be addictively fun, full of so many things to do.
B008478VE8|3.0|Interesting topic, but a little tough to read.  Obviously written a long time ago in \\"Old English,\\" and some areas require re-reading to fully comprehend. Best to have an interest in botany on some level to read this one.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|This book makes you think about the world differently and help you understand the different views of the world. I would hug highly recommend it to anyone who wants to read about surviving and animals.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Willard you cry your eyes out, but makes you put things into perspective. Very well written with a very lovable main character.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Poorly written and the main characters are annoying. A true review would take far too long. The plot itself is character driven, but lacks any real excitement.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really enjoy this game!<br />In this game you will raise a horse<br />Clean its pen, groom it and much more!<br />You can also enter competitions and earn coins and gems!!<br />It has daily tasks you can complete and objectives!<br /><br />It's defiantly a 5 star app!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|This is one show that takes a family and time and provides a look into the past for a family in England.  From marrying the right man that can provide a women security to World War I and beyond.  Family issues like any others but with class and distinction.  The house alone is worth watching the show.  The kitchen is just what it would have looked like during that time period.  The costumes are true to the era.  Even the hair and makeup fit the history.  I'm thrilled to have found season three on Amazon Prime.
0312330537|5.0|Lovely book<br />Set in India, Bombay<br />Beyond the story, it is beautifully written<br />Suspense<br />Deep!! Makes you think and reflect on your own life
B0033AI4PM|5.0|Truly a legend in the making. It's everything you want in a musical. And her talent is phenomenal. Without Streisand this film would just be a nice movie.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|we enjoyed the story line - retired doesn't mean what you think<br />4 great stars that are &#34;senior citizens&#34; - very funny - want to see the new Red 2
B00ECU2RGY|2.0|What a waste of talent.  Morgan Freeman and Tom Cruise, were so wasted in this movie.  The script is just awful, so slow, I mean really slow, and when there was action it was predictable.  Wish I could have gotten my money back.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I use it on my kindle fire, and for the most part I'm able to look at pins, add pins, It hangs up a lot and that is frustrating. Also I have a lot of boards and it's not easy to scroll through to pin something to the correct board... all in all it does what it needs to do.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Series keeps me on edge.  Enjoy the era.  Acting is a little stiff; however, overall enjoy the entertainment. Worth watching
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|This has been a real problem, and I can't get Amazon to send it.  It was supposed to come with the charger.  The charger arrived in a small padded envelope, but one cable.  I still want my cable!
0385528787|5.0|Early on in the long-awaited conclusion to her MaddAddam trilogy, Margaret Atwood writes:<br /><br />\\"There's the story, then there's the real story, then there's the story of how the story came to be told.  Then there's what you leave out of the story.  Which is part of the story too.\\"<br /><br />And in MaddAddam, at last, Ms. Atwood gives us all of the above.<br /><br />It's been a decade since I first read [[ASIN:0385721676 Oryx and Crake]], and four years since I read [[ASIN:0307455475 The Year of the Flood]].  I loved both books, loved the way the two intertwined and complemented each other.  So, in preparation for this final volume, I started by rereading the first two novels of the trilogy.  Wow, oh wow, did they hold up well!  I realize that not all readers have the time or inclination to revisit books they've already read, but in this case it was well worth the extra effort, if only to fully appreciate the connections between the three novels.  I don't believe that a trilogy was planned when Ms. Atwood wrote Oryx & Crake, and yet it was almost as if she had salted away loose ends a decade ago as part of some subconscious, brilliant master plan.  For those who aren't inclined to follow my suit, MaddAddam helpfully opens with a four-page summary entitled, \\"The Story So Far.\\"  Personally, I wouldn't consider reading this final volume without having first read the prior two at some point.<br /><br />When last we visited with the God's Gardeners, it was the post-pandemic Year of the Flood.  We'd been on a harrowing journey narrated through the eyes and voices of two Gardeners, Toby and Ren.  In MaddAddam, Toby is back as narrator, and while Ren is a secondary character in the novel, I have to admit that I missed her voice.  This time around, the tale is told by Toby alone until late in the novel a surprising second narrative voice emerges.<br /><br />And it's appropriate that Toby tells the tale, because it is primarily (Finally!) the story of Zeb, a man that Toby has secretly desired for years.  Up until now, Zeb has been an enigmatic character, always hard to pin down.  In MaddAddam, it becomes clear that Zeb's history is inextricably linked to that of Adam One and the God's Gardeners, as well as that of Crake and the Crakers.<br /><br />But in addition to looking backward, the story of Toby, Zeb, Snowman, the God's Gardeners, the Crakers, and the \\"MaddAddamites\\" who engineered them, moves forward.  The whole bunch of them are joined in an uneasy community.  The Crakers are an alien intelligence.  Says one of the MaddAddamites, \\"Their brains are more malleable than Crake intended.  They've been doing several things we didn't anticipate during the construction phase.\\"  Amen to that!  There are many unexpected complications of joining humans and Crakers together, many of them quite comic.  The comic relief is welcome, because Atwood's post-apocalyptic future is dark.  Of all the Craker characters, there is really only one who stands out, a young boy christened Blackbeard.  He befriends Toby, and is, simply put, adorable.  He is also the entr&eacute;e for readers into the Craker mind.  Can it possibly be accurate to say he \\"humanizes\\" them?<br /><br />There are many dangers facing this little tribe.  Probably the most aggressive threat is that of the Painballers--escaped prisoners who have all but lost their humanity.  The matter of humanity is, I think, central to this tale because if humanity is to be measured among the characters, it's a broad spectrum.  The Gardeners and their allies are a fairly admirable bunch, trying to live in peace, sustainably, and protect the Crakers.  While the Crakers have some extraordinary natural defences and abilities, left to their own devices in this harsh world, these childlike beings would surely perish.  The Painballers are entirely human, but have regressed to an almost animalistic state.  And then there are the pigoons--the enormous, genetically-engineered pigs that have acquired anunknown degree of human intelligence in addition to the transplant organ-compatibility they were designed for.  The pigoons are a threat to all constituencies, and in MaddAddam, we learn a great deal more about these animals.<br /><br />I can only write so much here, and yet it is a testament to Ms. Atwood's epic achievement with this final volume that there is so much substance contained within a mere 416 pages.  I want to discuss the role of mythology and written language within this tale, the allegorical elements, the cyclic nature of the story being told, and the connectedness of all things.  And, I want to quote her at length, for the sheer intelligence of her thoughts, and the beauty of her expression of them.  Truly, I could go on and on.<br /><br />She has given us the story, the real story, and how it came to be told.  Ms. Atwood has looked into our future with this trilogy.  She has extrapolated trends in our culture today and carried them into a worst possible tomorrow.  Her work is disturbing because her vision is undeniable.  Different readers will get different messages from this tale, and will take away different lessons.  Despite the darkness, I am left with a feeling of hope.  And a very strong impulse to start talking with the bees.n degree of human intelligence in addition to the transplant organ-compatibility they were designed for.

B003M70O5O|4.0|I've watched these because I have friends who urged me to do so - they're entertaining. If I don't watch I don't feel like I'm missing out, but I'm never not entertained while watching. I'd recommend all of them if you have the time.

B00CL68QVQ|2.0|Acting was not very convincible, even De Niro didn't deliver what he usually does. Very predictable dialogs, very disappointing ...
B004ADH1RI|5.0|My entire family is Bookie obsessed! This is one of the very few movies we caballero sit down and watch over and and over...and now we have introduced it to the next generation!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I updated the game like it asked to now it keeps telling me too go to the app store to update I cannot play the game anymore plz help
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|Definitely recommend it. A quick read which I didn't want to end, while at the same time, very thoughtful and insightful about important issues such as race, immigration, and human relationships.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|Why did u have to update it i cant click channels anymore plzzzzzzzzzzzzzz fix it and takes long for the video to load
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini does a wonderful job of making the characters and scenery seem real.  He teaches us of countries and cultures so very different from that of the U.S. with people who struggle for basic human needs.  The story follows the lives of several people who are connected, closely or distantly, to a gut-wrenching occurrence in the beginning of the book. Some of the characters were less developed than others, but that did not take away from my enjoyment of the book.  I felt totally involved in the story and didn't want it to end.
B00540G3G6|4.0|For Tim Burton fans this movie is a must. I do enjoy watching this movie around Christmas and Halloween. Childhood favorite.
B001P5I5ME|5.0|After Downton Abbey, I was looking for another series to watch with the family... I bought this one hoping it would be worth it - and it is! Although my kids are used to modern action shows, they ask to watch this series! The acting is superb, the dramas very interesting and there is no violence. So wholesome and a bit educational as it is set in pre-electricity rural England. Wish I had bought the collection of series 1-4 from the start.
B0084AYLK8|4.0|When I bought this for my Victorian business class, I thought this book would be dull and uneventful. It turned out to have a lot more to it than meets the eye. I found myself reading more than was required and I associated with the characters. While fictional, the book gives good insight to what life was like back then. I would recommend this to friends
B0046B1KHG|5.0|Great movie, I've seen it a bunch of times and it's always hysterical!!! Good laughs for the whole family, MUST SEE
031603441X|1.0|He left \\"Pathetic\\" out of the title. Only read this book if you're curious as to why Keith Richards, and Anita Pallenberg, have looked like heavily made-up corpses for the last 30 years.  I don't know why I borrowed it from the library, waste of time.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I will have to be patient as I wait for the next season. Thank you for making it available to Prime members!!!!
B00E8B1P9M|1.0|What a pile!  This movie is pure do not waste your hard earned cash.<br />I thought the first one was crap.
B00B9366VO|5.0|Great rockumentary that had the entire family entertained, which is a rarity in itself! It's a story about a board...
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|This &#34;based on a true story&#34; tale of the rise and fall of a mid-century American gangster has it all: glamour, guns, girls and Joe Pesci (Am I a clown? Do I amuse you?). Only 'The Godfather'  or 'Godfather II' can come close to 'Goodfellas' for the crown of best Mafia movie ever. It follows the story of Henry Hill, who starts the life of a wise guy when still a kid, rises in power and wealth, and ultimately meets the fate all wise guys do. Scorsese, De Niro and Pesci hit their collaborative crescendo here, and Ray Liotta was cast perfectly as the impressionable Hill. Just make sure the kids aren't in the room when you watch it.

B00ECU2SGS|5.0|Mud dramatizes what the majority of people in our country experience in their every day lives.  People who are raised in loving, supportive families, and who are able to do well in school, get above average wages need to watch Mud and try to understand.  The movie is about life most people experience and another side of love few will understand.

014132161X|5.0|Five children go exploring one day for something to do and find an amazing \\"being\\".  They stumble across a sand fairy that has the ability to grant them one wish a day.  They think they have struck it rich, but soon find that the things they often wished for were not the best ideas after all.  They are pleased to discover that when the day ends the wish also seems to end, but that doesn't help them at all during the day when their wishes are seeming like the worst ideas they ever had.  They soon learn that perhaps having the ability to have what they wish for on a daily basis is not such a great and amazing thing.  Will they ever learn what wishes they truly could appreciate?  Maybe the saying is true, \\"be careful what you wish for\\".  Perhaps they should heed this advise and think things through or at least over before wishing.<br /><br />When I was a kid, my Grandma read this book to me.  When I saw it in a local bookstore I just had to have it to read again and with my own child too.  My son enjoyed it very much, just as I remember enjoying it when it was read to me.  This classic is a truly meaningful story that is full of fun and adventure too.  I enjoyed sharing this book with my son and reliving the memories from the time my Grandma read it to me.  These children are so sweet to read about and the \\"thing named it\\" is just the cutest, yet not so polite, thing ever.  There is so much more to this story than just the fun, it has a true message underlying also, which is great.  Even if as children we are more into the adventure than the message.  This is a great classic to share with your children and I am so glad I found it again to be able to do so with my son.  The writing is very \\"old school\\" but it adds to the book and being that it was written in 1902 makes it feel like a step back in time for the reader in a way.  I loved watching the children go on the daily adventures they had because of their wishes they chose to make, as did my son.  Pick up and read this great classic, you won't be sorry.<br /><br />5/5 Stars!
B00942Y4IY|5.0|All geeks love tech, especially alien tech. Mix alien tech with human antiquity, and you've got us hooked. Ancient astronauts, gotta love'em, even if they're evil, slave-owning, pyramid-spaceship-dwelling, body-snatching aliens driven by selfish motives. Too bad the spaceship had to go!
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|The game is fun but expect to pay real cash if you want to play more than a few games. Also I've been booted from games because of glitches which still deducts from your coins. The only way to earn free coins is the rare and few and far between scratch off cards or you get 1 coin for leveling up which takes about 10 games. I'm very disappointed. The creators took a great game and made it frustrating. I hope they fix the problems or I won't be playing anymore.
B000FBJG04|4.0|Many of the events in the HBO series are compressed to meet production deadlines while the book I believe is a much more accurate rendering. One of most noticeable differences is the scene in the HBO series where Liebgott, Webster and another soldier go looking for the German officer and find him in the cabin. They then shoot him as he tries to run. According to the book, it was 3 totally different men in a different area.<br /><br />The book also gives a much truer and more tragic accounting of Captain Soble's service including his attempted suicide after the war.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|First, let me say I like most anything Judi Dench is in.  She brings a refreshing and almost innocent outlook on life to her characters. All of the actors were perfect in their roles.  Maggie Smith brings her crotchety self that she does so well to a perfect ending that I won't give away.  I found it particularly interesting to see the way 'Brits. move to other (exotic) countries and adjust so easily.
B008BSOAPE|5.0|This is a very sweet story and well worth the read. John Green doesn't disappoint with this tale of love and adventure. Typical to Green you laugh, you cry, you wish the story was slightly longer!
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|I have to admit, I mostly loved the music.  It was a refreshing movie of elderly people enjoying who they are, where they have been and trying to help others.  Maggie Smith is brilliant as usual, the whole cast was excellent.
B0070ZLZ1G|4.0|As he bounces between personal story, anecdote and hard science, Tough paints a compelling illustration of the challenges and opportunities facing education today.  I was initially drawn to the book after reading an feature in the WSJ written by Tough and then hearing this ideas presented on This American Life.  For those interested in what makes successful kids tick (both in poor inner city neighborhoods and in wealthy suburbs) and perhaps looking for some insight for their own parenting decisions, this is a worthy read.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I love the historical value and the actors are fabulous. It is well written and a joy to watch. Thanks
B0046B1KHG|2.0|Plot and outcome were too predictable. Attempts at humorous jokes / situations etc were lame. I found many other animation films to be much more cute.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This game has been a great time passer. This rating system is a 3 stars. The game is a 5 stars.
B0008JIJ2E|5.0|With the exploitation of the martial arts movies of the 1970s they got a bad name for violence and offence use of the arts. The karate kid is totally different in most respects. Two actors from comedian backgrounds that can make a real and touching movie is great. Although this movie is getting up there in age it still holds up well combining real life situations we all go through friendships and teachings that we don't find they find us. Good movie for the whole family
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Unpredictable, superb cast, move along comfortably without any drag and sudden surprises that keeps your mind thinking about it long after you have stopped watching.

B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Avengers isn't just a mindless superhero action fantasy<br />. It is that .. But its an enjoyable movie on its own merit as well.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This book is fascinating and well-written. It teaches so much about daily life in Palestine under the Roman Empire and paints a magnificent, detailed portrait of Jesus, the day-laborer from Nazareth who, just as all Jews living at that time and in that place, desperately wanted a return to the Israel of pre-Roman times. So much light is shed on the traditions, customs and beliefs of the Jews of this period which in turn allows us to discover the historic Jesus, the apostles, and all the other protagonists involved in this amazing story.<br />This is not a religious work, although religious rites and beliefs are discussed. Rather, it is a book for those who are interested in history and discovery of the truths behind the New Testament.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|Great and highly addictive game. Can't put it down! I could play for hours.  If you like bloons or plants vs zombies, you'll love this.

B005SHTXN0|2.0|language in the movie is inappropriate, it would have been much more entertaining if the script was written without all the vulgarity
B004JN1CW4|5.0|READ THESE, please, I beg you! Because I can guarantee that this series will not leave you unsatisfied. (I wish there was a punctuation mark in between a period-which says I'm serious-and an exclamation point-which is practically screaming.) There were so many times I found myself with my jaw hanging open from shock and my eyes bulging out of my head. Thomas and the Gladers are no longer a part of the Trials, but now they'll stop at nothing to see WICKED and their plans terminated, and the cost is high. Death, destruction, action, and even hope await you in this final chapter of The Maze Runner Trilogy. I don't want to say too much about the story line itself-I don't want spoilers to abound or anything. Oh, and The Kill Order is also a part of the series as a prequel, and I'll be reading that shortly (as soon as I snatch it up from a friend). The Death Cure (and every other book I've read in the series so far) is an indisputable 5/5 stars ;)

B001NLKZUA|4.0|This was a nice continuation of the series; it was very engaging and quite entertaining. I had to skip over some of the drawn-out self-doubt and romantic struggles, but otherwise it was a fast-paced plot.

B00B0U2SFE|5.0|One of the best movies about this tragic time in history. Every person should watch this film at least once. The music is also beautiful. Be prepared to cry.

0786962984|3.0|I think it is like an intriductory game for those kids who want to learn more complex games. It is a light fun game which is a classic. I love it.
B0087ITBT8|4.0|Good to see Barbra in another movie. Wish it wasn't an comedy but an comedy is better then nothing. Streisand and Roqen have good on screen chemistry together. The only downside during the film is to much talking scenes in between the funny scenes. A good film to watch on an rainy or snowy day.
B0052GACNM|4.0|I purchased Duets ll for entertainment while driving my car from city to city.<br /><br />First I must tell you my listening pleasure is selected jazz & classical instrumental music.<br /><br />The roster of great artists is excellent. The selection of tunes have proven themselves for many, many years, great.<br />Tony Bennett blends the tune and words very well, telling the story of the song better than anyone. The balance of tune and words are superb.<br />The supporting Orchestra is good but not great, but it is amazing what studio players can do, really cool.<br />The voices are well projected with good presence, not dominated by heavily orchestrated music.<br />It is wonderful to hear these excellent singers without too much entertainment background. This is a great platform for the artist to really show off how good they are. Lady Gaga is a very versatile and creative singer as is the voice of Amy Winehouse/s voice Want to have a romantic dinner for two, this will help.<br /><br />I recommend this for a relaxing and enjoyable listen.  Enjoy.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Huge special effects budget.<br /><br />All candy. No fiber.<br /><br />Delicious!<br /><br />Cool gadgets, e.g. : (flying aircraft carrier)<br /><br />No more words needed.
B009AMANBA|1.0|This movie was garbage. It couldn't hold my attention from the very beginning. It starts out with a couple of soldiers reciting the Gettysburg Address in front of Lincoln along with a couple of well-spoken, seemingly Harvard-educated black soldiers (one a private and one a corporal) expressing their hopes for the future to the president. It is so unbelievable. The speech wasn't even that popular at the time to be so well known amongst commoners. The black soldiers were extremely unbelievable. They spoke better than most of the high school graduates nowadays. I am supposed to believe that some uneducated, freemen or even former slaves in the 1860s speak that well? Seriously?<br /><br />I think I started daydreaming shortly after this pompous showing of Hollywood fiction. The movie is well made I suppose if you can swallow the crap Hollywood is trying to throw down your throat about history.
140006922X|5.0|Most Americans rely on the bible and religious instruction at their local church for their entire knowledge of the life of Jesus and the people in his life. This book makes it very apparent the limitations of relying on a text produced by political bodies with their own agendas over the centuries. The author makes very clear that there is the historical Jesus the man and Jesus the Christ figure and his book is about only the former.<br /><br />The author does a great job of putting into context the history of the area and the politics of the region with successive rulers and how this shaped the response to Jesus the man when he began to preach and how that was by its very nature and act of sedition. The fundamental question is who owns the land and its resources, which at the time of Jesus was the Roman empire headed by its emperor. Now in the United States those of European ancestory believe we have a God given right to all the land and all that is beneath the land as the Romans did for the lands they claimed to be within their empire and anyone who claimed otherwise was branded a seditious criminal and crucified.<br /><br />I can understand where the historical context provided by the book would upset \\"true believers\\" who prefer to believe that the bible is the literal and factual description of actual events and not the interpretation and reinterpretation and embellishments done by authors over the centuries.<br /><br />Something I had not thought much about until reading this book and the author's comment that the first gospels were written not only more than a century after the time of Jesus but in Greek. They were not written in Hebrew or Arabic, the languages Jesus would have spoken, nor in Latin the language of the Roman overlords, but in Greek. How anyone can think that words spoken in Hebrew or Arabic and then passed from one person's recollections to the next over a couple of generations and then translated into Greek and then into Latin and then again into old English can be accurate and relied as the literal representations of what was said has not knowledge of languages or how a translator's cultural bias will affect the outcome of their work. It takes a very simple mind to be a literalist with regard to the bible or any religous text.<br /><br />I would disregard the 1 ratings by religious fanatics who it is doubtful have bought and actually read the book. For a book authored by a true scholar on religions it is very well written and easy to understand. The author is trying to educate rather than impress and I intend to read his other works as well based on this book of his.to old English can be accurate and relied as the literal representations of what was said has not knowledge of languages or how a translator's cultural bias will affect the outcome of their work.

006114665X|5.0|Clark begins his splendid account of the events leading to the outbreak of the First World War with a 96 page sections (nearly a fifth of the book) on the pre-war history of Serbia, beginning with the reigns of King Milan (1868 to 1889) and his autocratic son King Alexandar (sic) (1889 to 1903), of the Obrenovic dynasty.  These two monarchs were pro-Austrian, ignoring the  intense nationalist feeling of the Serb people and sections of the Serb army which wanted to reconstitute the greater Serbian Empire that had existed under the medieval Tsar Dusan.  The unpopularity of the royal policy was one - but not the only - reason for a group of army officers putting a bloody end to the dynasty in 1903, installing the new figurehead Karageorgevic dynasty, and embarking on an anti-Austrian and pro-Russian foreign policy which had massive popular support.  The military officers who had carried out the coup, led one nicknamed Apis, embarked on a policy of subversion of the Serb population inside Austria-Hungary and carrying out the occasional assassination of Habsburg notables.  Prime Minister Pasic, though as nationalist as any, was worried by the illegal activities of Apis' agents, but powerless to stop him.  Apis was actually the head of Serb Military Intelligence. (I was strongly reminded of the situation in today's Pakistan.)  When Pasic learned of the intended assassination of Crown Prince Franz Ferdinand at Sarajevo, he sent \\"a warning of sorts\\", through the Serbian minister in Vienna, to one of the Austrian ministers who did not take it seriously and did not pass it on to his seniors.<br /><br />At this point Clark moves on to look at the wider European scene - the gradual and hesitant formation of the alliances which would be drawn into the war.  Though this story is in outline familiar, Clark challenges several of the generally prevalent ideas. He argues, for example, that, though the British press encouraged fear of the German naval programme, British ministers were not particularly worried by it, nor had they any need to be: in 1905 the Germans had only 16 battleships compared with Britain's 44, and in 1913 Germany unilaterally called off the naval arms race.  Nevertheless, key British policy makers had identified Germany as the main enemy, perhaps ever since the Kruger Telegram of 1895 (for which Clark also provides a perspective that I have not seen before).  He brings out the arrogance of the British who justified every expansion of their own empire while  resisting every German move that might give them any influence, protesting, for example, when Germany built a railway which would give the Transvaal an outlet to the sea in Mozambique.  Curiously, there is no  reference in this very detailed study to the three missions of Joseph Chamberlain to Germany, in 1898, 1899, and 1901 to negotiate a possible alliance with Germany.  It was the failure of these negotiations which would lead Britain instead to turn to France, and later to Russia.  But Clark also maintains that for Britain the Ententes with France and then with Russia were primarily directed against Germany.  He sees the Entente with France in 1904 mainly as an attempt by Britain to weaken the alliance between France and Russia (always regarded as the biggest menace to the British Empire), and the Entente with Russia in 1907 as taking advantage of that country's weakness after her defeat by Japan, to end these threats which were seen at the time (and by some British politicians even in early 1914) as much more dangerous than any threats from Germany.<br /><br />There is then a fascinating and detailed chapter showing that in all the Great Powers  the conduct of foreign policy was hampered for long stretches of time by uncertainty about who was actually in charge of it - monarchs? chief ministers? foreign ministers?  foreign service professionals? even ambassadors accredited to foreign courts?  the military and naval establishments? finance ministers? - and this accounted for swings in policy, especially between hardline and conciliatory steps which tend to be forgotten when, with hindsight, we see a steady march towards the great showdown of 1914. The detailed account of the Agadir Crisis in 1911 is a striking case study of rival policies alternating within France, Germany and even Britain.<br /><br />Clark shows how insecure the different alliances seemed in the three years before the outbreak of war:  how Britain continued to be worried by Russian activities in the Middle and Far East and feared that Russia might leave the Triple Entente;  how Britain and France resisted Russian wishes to open the Straits; how uncertain France was whether Britain would actually stand with her when the crunch came;  how Austria had failed to back Germany in the Agadir Crisis and Germany had failed to back Austria during the two Balkan wars;  how, even before Italy switched sides, she had coveted Habsburg Dalmatia and had ignored the interests of Germany and Austria, her partners in the Triple Alliance, when she attacked Turkey in 1911.  Right until July 1914, though both blocks prepared for being forced into what each considered a defensive war,  there was always the possibility that he tensions within the blocks might prevent a war between them.<br /><br />The book ends with a gripping account of the period between the assassination at Sarajevo and the outbreak of the war a month later. Even during the very last few days, there were vacillations. Right up to Russian mobilization the Germans, having encouraged the Austrians to deliver the ultimatum to Serbia, hoped that the ensuring conflict could be limited to those two countries.  In Russia there was dithering  about whether to have partial mobilization against Austria only or total mobilization against both Austria and Germany.  As late as August 1st Grey told the French ambassador that his Cabinet had decided against British participation.  Especially because Clark focusses throughout on day-to-day diplomacy carried out by some people with very human anxieties and hesitations, nothing seemed pre-ordained.nted for swings in policy, especially between hardline and conciliatory steps which tend to be forgotten when, with hindsight, we see a steady march towards the great showdown of 1914.

B005GG0MIS|5.0|An interesting explanation of the relationships shared by US presidents from Hoover through Obama. There is information, perhaps unknown to the general public.  The authors do a good job of explaining modern American history and  showing that sometimes accomplishments are based not on what happened, but on what was prevented from happening.  This is not a usual book for the Nibbler, it is more of a full course banquet.

I wasn't an English person born during World War II.  My father was  not killed in said war.  But this album has said it all to me.<br /><br />Side Three is, to me, the most perfect, intense, sad, hard hitting, most beautific album side.  Ever.  A minor all the way folks!  It still haunts me.<br /><br />This album got me through very hard times.  \\"After all it's not easy banging your heart against some mad bugger's wall\\".  Enough said.
0694003611|5.0|This book has been around for quite some time...since my childhood & I'm now buying it for my friend's kids.  Cute book perfect for bedtime ;)  If your hesitant to buy check it out at Barnes & Noble first, then hit amazon...prices are usually much cheaper ;)
B00DV2D0JC|5.0|Well worth the money.  Great graphics, good story line. Puzzles were logical and not too hard or too easy.  Liked the bonus chapter and the hidden object scenes available at the end. Will buy G5 games again.
0307120007|5.0|Good book for a little one of toddler age.  The textures inside are fun for a little person to explore ;)
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|This game won't challenge you, but it is a great game for zoning out and clearing your mind.  Strangely addicting!
0805047905|5.0|Another classic book from Eric Carle....very cute colorful images inside.  If you enjoy most of his books then you will surely enjoy this one! If your hesitant to buy, check it out at Barnes & Noble first then hit amazon...prices are usually cheaper ;)
B008CRC506|5.0|This is the better of the two seasons.  Great music, good acting and wonderful production value.  Great for lovers of theatre and those interested in getting behind the fictional scenes of a fictional Broadway show.
030726999X|5.0|Purchased as a gift for someone who read &#34;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&#34; and really enjoyed it.  From what I have heard - this is a great trilogy, and everyone I know that had read it had nothing but positive comments to say.
0062255657|4.0|This is an easy read written for a younger audience.  It does get a bit confusing since things aren't explained clearly.  A lot is left up to the reader.
1594135851|5.0|Purchased as a gift.  Great trilogy - very captivating of the reader's attention.  Anyone I know who has read this book and the others have given great feedback.  I have not met one person who did not like &#34;The Hunger Games&#34;.  I am an elementary/middle school teacher and both students/adults have enjoyed these books.  A must read for all ages!
B00C81AVNU|5.0|A fun and lively soundtrack.  Worthy of the Tony.  Cyndi Lauper knocked it out of the park with this one.
0399226907|5.0|This is a classic for little ones.  Purchased for my friend's son who is a toddler (3) and I also use as an introduction to a butterfly/caterpillar lesson with Kindergarten.  If your a fan of Eric Carle you definitely won't be disappointed!
B001BZRUR4|5.0|The beginning will grip you and then you will fall in love with the main character and his dog.  Quick read but gives lots to think about.
B0030MM68O|4.0|Exciting and fast paced. Gave me a flavor of this eras battlefield soldiers that I did not have. I gave it four stars because some of the scenarios were a little over the top, speaking as a former military person.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|The visual effects in this movie were first class and the action was just right. I'm so tired of these fast paced shoot em up movies. This had a decent plot, great acting, and moved along just perfect. Way to get it right.
B00821OX98|5.0|I had seen a couple of episodes on TV. Once I Found it on amazon I started watching it. I really love this show. Good story line, kind of cheesy at times but very enjoyable.
B003BW0CB6|5.0|The Lincoln Lawyer inherits a rich, landmark case when his compatriot is killed, only to find out he really didn't want it after all.  Harry is hired as his investigator, and Harry's daughter and FBI ex-lover all get involved in this spin
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|This is a great charger, its small, doesn't cost much compare to other brands, has a nice look, and it easily fits into any Cigarette lighter. I used both ports at the same time and it performed great, I like Anker products and I recommend it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Minion rush is so fun and easy to play,all the levels are so fun to play<br />And exciting and enjoyable.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Great book. It really makes one consider who our dogs really are. Beautifully and thoughtfully written. Just what I needed at this time in my life:)
B005LAIHR2|2.0|ROCK OF AGES practically telegraphs its trite, predictable, and formulaic story about two talented souls (the otherwise unknown Julianne Hough and Diego Boneta) going to LA in the Eighties to make music and subsequently get \\"discovered\\".  And of course after the mandatory fifteen lines of dialogue the duo suddenly bursts into song (Hough and Boneta do have some serious pipes, and it was good to hear several cover songs from long ago, yet the onslaught of the music rings numbingly hollow).  Meanwhile a tavern that launched so many musical careers (via its proprietor, played by Alec Baldwin, and his assistant, played by Russell Brand) teeters on the brink of economic collapse. . .unless it can convince former prot&eacute;g&eacute;e-turned-rock-legend Stacee Jaxx (a bored looking Tom Cruise) to perform onstage.  The luring of Jaxx brings about the vigorous opposition from a group bent on curtailing Jaxx's demonic brand of music, a group led by the mayor's wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones).  All the various subplots come (so predictably) together, culminating in the performance of a song composed by the Boneta character himself--an instant hit and chart topper.<br /><br />Yet ROCK OF AGES never gains footing or momentum; the two supposed leads can't carry the freight, the Jaxx character is unlikable, the subplot surrounding the budding romance between the Baldwin and Brand characters unbelievable as well as damaging to digestion.  We all know how the Zeta-Jones character will evolve, with a collective yawn pertaining to the boy-meets-girl/loses-girl/reunites-with-girl predictable story, strongly signifying why ROCK OF AGES made its theatrical run with much prior fanfare, then limped to DVD status with a glossy haired whimper.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I can't stop playing! I must be number one. One of the top three games for Kindle Fire in my opinion.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Great story telling, good acting, good film work. And playback quality is good.  Didn't watch it on h b o the first time.  Will buy season 3 @ amazon too
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|this series was fantastic from the first to last frame. I cannot recommend it enough. i won't go into a word of detail, as i went in cold just based on the cast. you won't be disappointed.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|I have a ten year old son, and he is too old for many children's movies, but he is too young for PG-13.  There are not many movies that fall in the area between these interest levels. However, this movie fit the bill.  The family enjoyed it, and although my 5 year old found it a bit scary, it was enjoyed by all.
B0067LY4WG|5.0|Having attended the concert Old ideas ( and more)  I have to express my impresions .Mr. Cohen who performed with his band great show. seems to be  like an old wine with all tastes , colours and aromas. I need to have this cd to be kept reminded
0345803485|5.0|Could not put this book down!<br />I Can't wait for the movie!<br />You definitely gotta read all three books tho!
B004YW4L5K|4.0|4.5 out of 5 Stars. First of all, when I first heard about this book and it's plot, I imagined a total different thing of what the book actually is. I think I got caught by the hype of this book and for that reason I had a lot of problems reading the first chapters.<br />Said that, the book is very well written with outstanding well developed characters, even the secondary characters that appear in no more than ten pages are well defined. The dialogues between them feels real and always add something to the main story. I enjoyed a lot the different kind of emotions that this book can make you feel, from very sad moments to hilarious ones and others where you want to kill some character.<br /><br />The reason why I don't give this book 5 stars is because I don't kind like this genre a lot, for ME, this book lacks action. When I started reading the book I imagined a lot of action in it, I imagined the gods doing god-things (like converting the water into wine :P), I imagined super battles Avengers style but no, this book doesn't has nothing like that and for that reason the first half of the book was kind of boring. Another thing I disliked was that some of the flashback mini-stories were quite boring.<br /><br />Although that, the book managed to suck me in it's story and made me want to know what was going to happen with every character I care.<br /><br />If you like this genre or if you are a fan of Neil Gaiman and you haven't read this book yet, then this is a must read for you.<br />If you are neither of that, then this book can wait, it definitively worth the try but it can wait.
0670026603|4.0|Easy fast summer read. Good character development and setting. Found some parts a tad unrealistic and did not agree with author's point of view. Provides great book club discussion.  Would highly recommend.
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|I just have to keep trying to beat the next level.  My Kindle keeps running out of juice before I'm ready to quit playing.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Great book. Though fictional, it gives the reader a insight into the lives of those so affected by these wars. Still we wonder how we seem to be repeating many of these same mistakes.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|I don't like that you have to buy you energy and hints. Otherwise, it's a good game in that you can pick it up or turn it off and anytime.
B003O86FMW|5.0|One page of this book forces you to read the next. Couldn't put it down, only start it if you have the time to finish it!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is seriously the very best free calculator app available for Kindle! Does all of the basics and even has a few advanced features. I highly recommend it.
B00A0SJJUO|5.0|I saw this when I was a teenager, now my son is almost a teenager. We watched it with him. He wasn't as impressed as my husband and I but as we talked about it, he came to appreciate it more. He even asked if there was a rematch!!
0099448599|5.0|So much detail that was missing from 'the ninth gate'. It was a rollicking ride that fleshed out many details missing from the movie.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This is a great game, fast moving, actually makes me grit my teeth :)  It is lots of fun to play.. go ahead and get it.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|One day I'll be proud to say Neil Gaiman wrote books during my lifetime...his books will last forever, I'm willing to bet.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Love the brutal honesty this book reveals about Steve Jobs.<br /><br />Very self empowering, leaves you feeling anything is possible.<br /><br />Loved it!
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I enjoyed the story and felt it portrayed foster care children fairly accurately.  It was intereting to see how an interest in flower and their meaning could save her from the streets and give her a good life.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Really fun but challenging for children. Fun to play with others and perfect for passing time. Can't wait for more levels.
B00ABLJ5NQ|5.0|It was a wonderful walk down memory lane.....all the way to the end of the lane. Though the memories weren't mine they acted as a catalyst, igniting very magical childhood thoughts and times. Great writing as usual from Neil
B008HK3XOU|4.0|No problems with this stand. It works exactly like it should. I got this for my wife and she has dropped it several times with no issue.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|It's fun to shoot the bubbles away a good game to do for just passing some time or trying to shut down after work go ahead try it
B003DTLUFO|4.0|Is this a knockoff or the actual thing? When I got it in the mail, her torso was disconnected from her legs (This is normal since you'll need to do this to change her legs from a straight to bent legs) and she can barely hold together on her own. I'm aware some cannot stand on their own and will need the stand but others I've gotten such as Sonic, Snow Miku and Madoka Kaname felt solid and &#34;real&#34;. BRS on the other hand just felt like she was about ready to fall apart even if you pick her up the wrong way.<br /><br />I've managed to keep her in a comfortable position on my audio interface and it was a pain trying to prop her on it but finally got it. Either way she's cute and worth the buy just...don't handle her too much or else you'll probably wind up with a lost part lol.
B003XDXVXO|3.0|I rate this three stars because I didn't care for her love interest in this film.  JLo was cute, but the love interest dude? eh. but the story was alright. It entertained me for an hour or so.  I preferred watching &#34;What to Expect when you're expecting&#34; which also had JLo... this one was cute though.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This game is enjoyable because you warm up as each level gets faster so that you can keep up the pace for a long time.
B00ECUARO8|3.0|Matthew does a good job of becoming his character and you see and feel the emotion that causes the story to happen. Some foul language to watch out for but not real extreme by my standards. I can recommend it.
B006O5YHUY|5.0|This movie is so much better than I expected. Great story, Great acting, great fight scenes. I can't believe I've never even heard of it.
B007FTZDN8|3.0|I love the selection of topics, but anything over 10-15 minutes loads very slowly on my Kindle Fire.  That is disappointing.
B007UXSPK2|3.0|Not a great movie; not a big fan of Tom Cruise.  It was an okay movie; I find him very stiff in most roles.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|read this & followed it w/ book 2 The name of the wind of this series ,cant wait for book 3
B0043JDUNS|5.0|Great action scenes and very funny at times.  Love these super hero movies.  Definitely a good choice when you just want to vegetate.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|What fun! Not to be missed! I gained some insight into how World War I changed the social strata in England, as well as enjoying this series immensely.
B001RP1G0U|5.0|Makes you laugh and cry, all in the same movie.  Sweet movie with a lot of very funny lines.  Had me laughing out loud.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I was a little wary of buying this after reading some negative reviews, but the one I got is awesome, totally free of flaws or defects. Only thing I don't like is that it's rather poor at opening locked doors.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|It's a nice continuous flow of individual short stories made to be a novel. I didn't believe I would like this book even though it was highly recommended. I was pleasantly surprised how quickly I was drawn into the story. I found myself forcing to stay awake to continue reading and waking up in the middle of the night to squeeze out a few more pages.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I ABSOLUTELY  love the game it's amazing it is good for kids who love horses I like how you can have friends and race your horse I just love horses
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I read everyones' (or,..., almost everyone's) reviews about this type of product.<br />So, I bought several adapters from different brands and sellers.  You know, you get a little nervous when you Must have a charger.  We went to Northern MN.  We had no electricity or running water.  (*That is a different kind of review. LOL. So we had to have a way to charge our Nokia & Samsung cells and the gps.)<br /><br />Having said that, the Anker 18W worked wonderfully.  I would indeed buy another and would recommend it to friends and family.  I had no problems and in fact, I bought two just in case something went wrong!  It has a good rating though a couple folks had a \\"breakdown\\" so I just bought two.  I never took the second one out of its package.  Maybe I can give it away as a gift!  They are inexpensive and invaluable.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Its awsome and it feels like yhu have  real pet when your playing this game awsome yhu guys need to play this
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|The best writers appear to have gravitated to TV.  Gutsy producers have committed capital.  Aspiring actors and actresses are discovered by and are remaining with the small screen.  Dexter is one of the best series to arise from this sea change.
1423113454|5.0|First, the Lightning Thief. Then the Sea of Monsters. The Titan's Curse, followed by the Battle of the Labyrinth and the Last Olympian. Now.....THIS. Does Rick Riordan EVER run out of great ideas?<br />(WARNING: SPOILERS BELOW)<br /><br />Enter Percy Kane. Or was it Carter Jackson? Either way, with his sister, Sadie, they have to fight a whole new arsenal of monsters, ranging from demons with Swiss army knife heads to dinosaurs with leopard-spotted necks to stop a disco-clad god of chaos from destroying the north American continent. Together, Sadie and uhhh... Carter Kane (I DID know that!) team up with a basketball-loving baboon and an all-powerful cat as they go on this epic twenty-first century egyptain Odyssey, uncovering shocking truths about their ancestry and abilities.<br /><br />I recommend this book to any reader who can read this sentence.<br /><br />VBG
B001RIY4WE|5.0|Terminator may have introduced the world to a great Sci Fi movie but Terminator 2 took that movie and multiplied it by 100. This is the gold standard of Action/Sci-Fi movies. Great plot, great scenes and memorable characters.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Great story.  Intriguing characters. Card takes you into this world with his depth of detail. He has a talent for balancing the dialogue between cerebral and simple. Rarely a dull moment in this story.
B0085A9HXS|5.0|The Raid Redemption is easily one of the biggest surprises in years! Non stop action throughout the entire film. I have never seen such amazing and great fight scenes in my life. This shows that a great movie does not need a huge budget. Dubbed version is too great would recommend original language and subtitles, may be a bit harder to follow but its much better that way.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|when you pull up the weather channel on a kindle fire the back ground is so light you can hardly see the temp
B00DHNJGCU|4.0|My first impression of this movie from the trailer was that was just going to be another action flick.  After my wife and I watched it we both commented to each other that it had a (somewhat fresh) plot, story line that had some surprises and less computer generated graphics in terms of the more typical exaggeration of the explosions etc.  In short we were pleasantly surprised but we had relatively low expectations starting out.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|I have read all three of Khaled Hosseini's books and have enjoyed everyone of them.<br /><br />I would thoroughly recommend this book.
B008476HBM|4.0|If you are looking for a great filled with humor, lost love, longing, and characters you want to reach into the book and slap...this is that book!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I read the book in 3 days. I lived the Crossfire series. Please let me know when the next book is coming out
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|I love the futuristic aspect of the movie. Also Tom Cruise is a great actor. But the movie  was confusing
B0059WTMLW|5.0|This has many variants and a wide selections of levels.  I play all the time and haven't seen a duplicate puzzle at any point.  If you love Sudoku this is the app you want.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|I'm hooked! Video streamed well. We did not have any difficulty watching it at all. I would recommend this to my friends.
B000JMLFLW|4.0|got hooked up from the beginning. really nice drawn characters with a strong woman at the center, its a charming book.
B008JFUN6E|4.0|This is far from a perfect movie. Let's get that clear.  There are characters with no motivation or very little (w-why does Kruger take Frey? Why does Spider suddenly want to fix everything? These aren't impossible questions to answer in character, but I'd have liked *some* gesture toward those), and then there's the how exactly does Max, you know, put on a t shirt that is somehow under that rig? And of course, it's another Straight White American Guy saves the world movie.<br /><br />However, it's the only movie I've seen this summer where I didn't know the ending after the first ten minutes of the film. Big plus.  The story seems disconnected, but I find it far better than the predictable plots of, say, Iron Man 3 or Pacific Rim.<br /><br />And it is beautifully filmed. To the point where perhaps the cinematography calls a bit *too* much attention to itself? But all you critics of the shaky cam, at least we didn't get blinded by lightflares like we do in like...every Joss Whedon movie ever?<br /><br />For people decrying this as Left Wing propaganda, I am sorry, but I can't quite follow your argument.  Primarily because, well...let's look at Patel, right?  Brown-skinned token president of Elysium who worries about how things look, instead of getting things done, and who is completely hamstrung by Delacourt? If that doesn't sound like Right Wing critiques of President Obama, I don't know what does! (And if you look at it, when Congress has just given themselves a free pass from Obamacare, so it's good enough for you and me but not good enough for them, well...Obamacare looks a lot like what Max faces on Earth!)<br /><br />A lot of the people who dislike it dislike the film for the very reason I like it: Max *isn't* a white knight hero from the get-go.  He's a bit selfish, not super smart, average Joe guy just trying to get by in a terrible world. He's not out to overthrow anything or be a hero.  He resists it throughout the movie.  I felt a lot more for Max than I did for Raleigh Becket in Pacific Rim (a movie of far more racist stereotypes and shallow characterization than this); and considering that I categorically do not like Matt Damon, this was very, very grudgingly given.  I see a lot more of Blade Runner's Deckerd than the other cookie cutter cardboard pretty boy heroes this summer's crop of films have given us.  I went in expecting to hate the movie and ended up loving it--despite its flaws.did for Raleigh Becket in Pacific Rim (a movie of far more racist stereotypes and shallow characterization than this); and considering that I categorically do not like Matt Damon, this was very, very grudgingly given.

B00AHXIC50|5.0|I was resistent to Bruno Mars at first cuz I'm not really into radio pop. There are some great and sexy songs on this album and after seeing his performance on SNL I had to get it.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|This game was really fun but then I couldn't update it when it told me to but then I couldn't play it....
1426308469|5.0|My boys LOVE dinosaurs, and this one is great because it's detailed without being too lengthy or boring for little kids (3 and 5 year olds). It's got all their favorites plus has introduced them to some &#34;new&#34; dinosaurs. The illustrations are great, too.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game reminds me of Myst, in its aesthetic and puzzle design. Super fun to play, and a great app because you can play in relatively short installments!
B005LAIIGC|5.0|Saw this in the theater with my kids and I knew I'd preorder it on Blu Ray as soon as possible. Great holiday film but not so much so that you can't enjoy it all year long. Loved it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome! A lot like subway surfers, but with your favorite minions! The hardest part is when you have to defeat<br />vector... But in the end it is very easy! I highly recommend this to anyone that loves despicable me!!! This is a must have : )
B0011Z31V8|5.0|It's called &#34;The Very Best of Prince&#34;, and it is. Kiss, Diamonds and Pearls, Raspberry Beret, Little Red Corvette, 1999... Come on, what else are you looking for?
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Love the game it told me to update I did that now it doesn't work!!<br />It just keep saying go to app store to update!  Can you fix this asap!!
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|LOVE this movie! Probably more than my kids because I grew up with games like this. John C Reilly and Sarah Silverman are perfect in this and, like many Disney movies, you ca enjoy it with the whole family but it's even better as an adult :)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great game. Not to hard. Not to easy. I wish it had more than ten levels. Great.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|If you are a Joe Bonamassa fan, or just someone willing to try something different then this may be a pleasant surprise. Listening tastes vary so greatly that it is difficult to say if you'll like it, but I can assure you that you won't be hearing any of this on your pop forty station.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|This is a great series, we looks forward to the next season.  One of the best now on television, I highly recommend it.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Great game for airports or at home in some spare time with the family. I've been trying to play for a while and finally got the chance and haven't put it down yet.again I say Great game.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I liked it until I got to the end. It was as if Sylvia Day didn't know how to end of the book.
0061339202|4.0|As a higher education instructor, I loved the theoretical approach to creativity and practical applications for how creativity works best.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don't think that I could possibly say anything about this book that hasn't already been said by the thousands of other reviewers, so I'll just give those of you who are contemplating purchasing it a bit of advice based on my own experience. First, buy this book. I don't care if you have to sell a kidney or give up coffee for the week, do it, it's totally worth any personal sacrifice made on your part. Plus, it's like what, six bucks? That's a steal. Second, once you have physical possession of the book, locate a secluded, quiet area where you can hunker down for a while and read without threat of interruption. If possible, I suggest traveling to some secluded corner of the world like the South Pole or some tiny hut in the far reaches of the Congo. If travel is not possible, then I suggest turning off the phone, sending the pets to a pet spa for a few days and signing the kids up for a week of summer camp. No measure taken to ensure your fortress of solitude should be considered overkill. Third, make sure you have plenty of munchies and fluids within arm's reach. You don't want to have to stop reading because your tummy is grumbling so loudly that you can't concentrate on what you are reading or you become parched and are in danger of dehydration. (As a side note, make sure your chosen haven is within close proximity of a bathroom and that you have a clear path to it, thus shortening the travel time needed for the bathroom break or, in a best case scenario, you can keep reading while walking to the bathroom without risking a fall, thus providing a maximally uninterrupted reading experience.)<br />So as I have previously stated, I couldn't possibly say anything in this review that anyone else hasn't said, and my advice may seem ridiculous, but this book is definitely worth it. The only regret you could possibly have with this book is if you do not read it (or if you purchase it, ignore my advice, come to a really great spot and have to stop because the dog needs togo out or you pass out from lack of nourishment).<br />Bottom line: yeah, it's that good.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|Its not the camera, its the Kindledesign. Its the fact that there is no lens on the other side of the screen, so all you can do is take pictures of yourself, or view what you are shooting from a wide angle and hope to hit the trigger correctly. Kindle need a lens on the other side and a reversal  of image like the I phone.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|My husband and I enjoyed this movie during the Christmas Holiday. I was not sure what to expect. I never heard of the movie before I ordered it. I am glad that I gave this movie a chance. It had a great story line. It was a modernized animation movie. Again enjoyable.
159463176X|1.0|Wow wow wow. I have RAVED about A Thousand Splendid Suns to everyone, EVERYONE!! I loved Kite Runner!! Two stories with such depth and emotion. When I found out there was a third book, I was beyond excited. Yet I am left SUPER DISAPOINTED!!! The story went all which and ways, didn't flow, characters didn't morph together, super slow from the middle to the end, it was a pointless book!! I felt like he wrote it just for the sake of writing it! Not what I expected so angry...
B000HKW7E0|5.0|OMG this movie was so so so funny. My family and I wached this movie during the Christmas Holiday.We are looking forward to ordering second sequel.

B0039O8AQK|5.0|Faithful reproduction of George Orwell's dystopia of a world divided between three totalitarian megastates at perpetual war with each other.  Two low-ranking Party members dare to fall in love, and are brutally crushed.<br /><br />  A neat touch was the patriotic anthem composed by the film-makers for the totalitarian state of Oceania.<br /><br />  Those not familiar with Orwell's book or interested in politics might find the film depressing.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John Green is one of my favorite modern day writers. He captures so much truth in his stories and never fails to bring in something unexpected. This story is about cancer and he it seems as if he understands the horrors of illness personally. I recommend this book to anyone, especially if that person is going through a rough time. I hope my review helped.<br />xx
B000ZM1MG4|5.0|Dustin Hoffman had this role down.  Honestly, he looked and acted like a woman.  The story was fun, interesting and insightful.<br /><br />As his character Michael transformed into Tootsie, he began to experience the way women were exploited, disrespected and harassed by men who held powerful positions over them.  Since this kind of misogynistic behavior continues today, this movie continues to be relevant.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Suzanne Collins herself caught fire with her masterful tale of Catching Fire. The perfect balance of good and bad, right and wrong. A revolution in itself.
B000Y5JFN4|4.0|Another movie that I just saw for the first time.  I expected more, but I am glad that I saw it.<br /><br />I know it is a work of fiction, but I expected it to be more realistic.<br /><br />The characters had very little depth.  I wanted to know more about them.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I found it very winding and boring in many places. Also the wife was a unbelievable in the way she was carriying out her revenge.
B004UFEJXK|5.0|I had never seen Wall-E before.  So, I was completely blown away by the animation, the story and the attention to detail.  The garbage alone that Wall-E collected and treasured for himself says a lot about our throw away society.<br /><br />I will watch this again and again.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|I guess I need to spend more time on it, the first experiment did not gave me any results so I guess I need to focus more? I like the ideas and the easy reading anyway
B004EFYZ1C|4.0|Like this app its nice to see moon phases for planing my hunting & fishing. It was worth the 99. Cents just to see what the other side of the moon looks like. I had never seen it before<br />Good app...
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I am impressed with the drama and characters that are the essence of Walking Dead. There is mystery  and suspense around every corner.  While I miss some key characters, the introduction of new players keeps the storyline fresh and intriguing.  It reminds me a bit of Lost where you suspend judgment on the plausibility of the plot and just sit back and enjoy te drama.<br />Well done all around.
B003G4W49C|3.0|Interesting story it closes too fast. Peter and Valentine are not credible characters, neither is Ender. Entertaining but not remarkable.
1400069807|4.0|As a former employee of General Foods at the Tarrytown site from the mid 70s to the late 80s, this book reminded me of those days. May not be for someone with no experience in the food industry.
B003Z49LYO|5.0|Amazing actors, emotional, great costumes and lush scenery. Gemma Arterton is definately someone to watch. Tess of the D'urbervilles is a story that still resonates today.
B00ECUARO8|3.0|Good acting poor plot, too slow. Really hard to stay awake through the whole movie. We did like the location scienry.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Great book, I couldn't put it down. Easy to read and characters were interesting to follow. Can't wait to read the sequels
B004CFBMRY|5.0|I bought this book after having done a running workshop with a barefoot enthusiast and couldn't put it down.  It was like a non-fictional Dan Brown in terms of its page-turning entertainment value!.  I have bought a whole bunch of copies to give to injured runners I know who have all but given up on running in the latter years.
B005LAIHRC|5.0|The blue ray plays great on my system and with surround sound, I can crank it up and enjoy all the songs. Great purchase
B0089OBLDO|4.0|A few issues that are a fault of how the product is inherently designed, but that design allowed it to do what it does great.<br /><br />DO NOT get this if you are looking to transfer an arcade stick or other similar perpherial.<br /><br />For normal controllers, however, this thing is a charm.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Great way to pass some free time.  I really enjoy games that start out easily enough but become more difficult as you achieve higher levels.  You'll have lots of fun while testing your dexterity.  Really good bubble game.
B002EBDP9G|5.0|This is the best historical account of the United States that I have ever read.  I hated to put it down.  A very easy read and interesting book.  I would recommend it to everyone.
B004EF65QA|5.0|I loved this mini series - I have watched it 3 times now!  The acting and story are very engaging.  I would highly recommend if you enjoy historical romances.
B009KY5OGC|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the building of our nation.  It was very helpful to me in my education of the rich history of the U.S.  It is very well written.  You will not want to put it down.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|i recommend this product, good series, great option to rewind, re-watch on your own time. thanks for offering in video.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I loved this book. So very well done. Anyone reading this review should get it immediately. You will not be disappointed.
B00CB4ET0K|1.0|Classic oxymoron, but it's true. Yes, the game is free to play, but soon you will find that you will hit a wall and the only way to efficiently progress through the game is to shell out real money, and a lot of it.<br /><br />To complete the game expect it to cost a ton of time and more than $100 dollars of real money.<br />I really am not sure how this game has received so many 4 -5 stars. The only reason I can come up with is this game was reviewed based on early game play. In the beginning a couple of weapons are provided that will get the job done, but latter on fall woefully inadequate.<br /><br />There are three different monetary units in this game.<br /><br />War Dollars: You can earn war dollars by grinding through the game or you can buy them. War dollars are limited to Rifles and Machineguns, but only mid-range guns. The best weapons you have to use glu credit.<br /><br />Glu Credit: You mainly have to purchase it. You can earn a little by leveling up 4 - 6, or reaching major benchmarks in the game 180 stars about 10 glu credits.<br /><br />Axis Plans: These you earn over time by shooting spies. After 250 points you have a chance to spin the wheel for weapons or power ups. The reward vs. payout is low, but over time you might just get lucky.<br /><br />I understand the need to make a profit, but this game is way too expensive. For example the best machine gun will run you more than $50 real dollars not game credit. The ultimate pack offers a discount over the individual price of weapons, but even that is $70 dollars.<br /><br />Even if you buy the ultimate pack certain supplies have a limited life span.  Armor will be depleted and you have to buy more. If you die in a mission you can spend 10 glu credits to revive your player, that's basically 50 cents. 55 grenades will cost you about 5 dollars, and yes you will need that many or more to progress through the game.<br /><br />I would gladly pay to play a quality game that doesn't try to milk me for all that it can. At this point I think I'm only playing the game to see have far I can go for free.<br /><br />Check out some of the comments on glu's community website.

1452101248|4.0|I look through this cookbook more than I use it. The pictures are gorgeous, the food all looks amazing, and the flavor combinations are inspired and delicious. I don't always use it because I'm never sure if the recipes will be a hit with my family- so far I have loved almost everything I've tried (about 25% of the recipes) but none have been huge hits with my pickier husband and kids. I can't plan a family meal around any of the recipes so far, but I do use them for starters and sides, and this is my favorite cookbook to use when I'm (very rarely) cooking for myself.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I played this game on my iPhone&hellip;but it kept freezing up. When i found it on my Kindle Fire&hellip; I was so exicited to play! It Rarely Freezes up and it's so much fun! (It's better than Temple Run 1 &amp; 2.) The game is addicting.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Obviously there's been a lot of controversy over this book.  For me...I took it at face value...exactly what the author professed it to be...an examination of Jesus the man in his time.  It was simply fascinating for me to read and think about Jesus in that context.  Well written...easily understood.
B000W93CHC|4.0|Readers will recognize many of the same narrative touches as with the first book and will even recognize some similar character archetypes. The plot begins to feel a little formulaic. Each chapter goes something like this--someone gets beat up, someone gets laid, someone plots against someone else and one of the two parties has his/her plot foiled. I felt like the inclusion of a sex scene in almost every single chapter was gratuitous, but all of that sex and violence and scheming make for a real page-turner. All in all, this is a great read, especially if there's a beach cottage, mountain chateau or hammock involved.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is the third book I've read by Kahled Hosseini, and the best yet.  It was a beautiful, heartwarming tale of how people's lives connect and bring the best out in each other.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Well written, thought provoking work.  While none of us will ever know the \\"truth\\", this at least gets us into the discssion.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I really enjoyed this game until it wanted you to update it.  Tried updating and it keeps taking you to the same screen telling you to update.  please fix this!
B004UFEJXK|4.0|Wall-E is an enjoyable film. I think it's funny when a character like a robot is given human emotions, and they animate it so that he or she is actually likeable. Not my favorite Pixar film, but still enjoyable, and a fun escape.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I agree with the others. After the update it no longer let's me play the game. It did update just keeps bringing me back to the app store.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|I gave it 5to stars because it works well on my DROID X2 running Eclipse ROM. It is a useful ap, and the widget is customizable.
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|Good story line. In the end felt sorry for Maggie's parents. As far as the love between her and Laurent, don't know what will become of that.
B00AEFXE9U|5.0|Almost Famous is one of those movies that give me great pleasure every time I watch it. The characters are so easy to like and the story is just so humane. Practically anyone can relate to those people personified by top-notch actors.
B007TXN4TK|4.0|I love piano games. All kinds especially this one. But in certain songs(such as dance of the sugarplum fairy) it's sooooo hard to press three keys at once. It's not possible at all for me. So you end up getting a bad rating because of the stupid keys. All in all the game is awesome though. That's the one(and only) problem I found with it.
B0096HFD8W|5.0|I think this movie is a definite horror classic. It follows the 1st flick with intense thrills & a bit of gore. Id say it goes down as a must see! Wes Craven never fails.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|I really liked the movie. I felt like there was a lot of hype, but it was still pretty solid.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|No real reason to have this application it isn't worth anything the app is worthless to me...So I deleted it from my kindle
B002U3CCKQ|5.0|This book held my attention from start to finish.  Gillian Flynn has a talent for making you love her characters.  It is a great read!
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|definitely like the movie moon but with some twists not a bad movie at all. probably worth watching a second time
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I am not a reader of the Graphic novel so the plot is fantastic and original to me since I do not know what is coming.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I originally got this game for my 5-year old, but we are both hooked on it! It's fun, the minions are adorable and anyone would enjoy it. I highly recommended Minion Rush!
B00ECU2SGS|3.0|It held my interest OK but I can't say &#34;wow, that was great&#34;!  McConaughey dirty & muddy is not my thing.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I am a little obsessed with this series on TV and being able to read the books has been awesome. The character development, descriptive scenes makes this book a must read. I love the story, obviously, but the book is worth reading even after seeing the TV show.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved it and didn't want it to end.<br /><br />The author should write a trilogy based on Christian Grey's views.
B007ZCOT6C|2.0|The central theme of the book seems fine but overall offers nothing unheard of....<br />It revolves around classic theme of romance b/w rich girl and poor boy both going through identity crisis. The start is promising, however you keep expecting the plot to get better but it doesn't. Rather reading seems more like a task here than a journey. Weak plot and poor editing made it a painful read!
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|This reminds me of the good ole days when I was a kid. It's fun and rewarding. Fast paced.  Gotta try it.
B000002KNI|5.0|I first heard this album on a walkman with high end headphones.  I'm still in love with the album.  The songs, the crowd noise, and the on-stage interplay between singers and audience make listening a unique experience.  Never fails to bring a smile to my face.  I'm too young to have been to the concert, but listening takes me there every time.
B0026S93C0|4.0|While this may seem like a 'chick flick' it is enjoyable for all.  This movie defines so much of the 1980's it should be on everyone's watch list.  Jennifer Beal gives a great performance, the music is good, and the story is engrossing and entertaining.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Magical from beginning to end.  The characters are fascinating, the story is engaging, and it's truly hard to put this book down.  Definitely a book I'll re-read ( and I don't re-read books)!
B00A285OOW|2.0|Not enough character development. I found Henry's constant paranoia tedious. I love Phillippa Gregory but this one can be skipped.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Loved this book!  It begins with an unusual premise and remains intriguing enough to keep you reading through the end.  Well written and a fun read.
B000LB7G00|5.0|I got this mouse for work where I am doing 3D models and walkthroughs of them in Navisworks.  It has been very helpful when it comes to navigating the models.
B005DJREJS|5.0|Great show, possibly over blown a little but I watched every episode in one sitting. I definitely recommend this show.
030789701X|5.0|got the item few days ago and all i can say is damn the book is perfect only problem is its 6.1Lbs
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I'm not a huge fan of comic book movies with a few exceptions, but this one definitely delivers.  The dialog is snappy and relevant.  The visuals are astonishing, and unlike a Michael Bay movie, the action is visual engrossing and actually worth watching.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I was hooked in the first season.  Season 3 was so easy to play with Amazon Prime.  I gave it a four because, although I really liked the season, there was more doom and gloom than happiness.  Too much sadness.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|This app is so awesome. It makes going to youtube a whole lot easier! And there r no errors! U people shuld TOTALLY GET IT!!!!!!!!#
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft PE is a game that should be shared to everyone because you could do anything I recommend this game for you
B003UMW62A|5.0|Great movie for kids and adults, my 4 year old loves it. Adam Sandler plays the part perfectly, funny and personable.
B001NLL93W|5.0|I've read a few popular series but this one I really do love! Great story lines that just keep you hanging on to see what happens next.  On to the fourth book now and still have trouble putting my Kindle down.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|I have this installed on my Android phone and Kindle. I use it to see if there are any Wi-Fi spots available and the strength of the signal. I also used it to identify what channel I was using compared to my neighbors.
B009E3EYS8|5.0|Jr. at the drums is as good as dad. Plant's voice is still amazing. Page's skills show why he is a guitar god. The band plays in perfect pitch. Amazing concert!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|This book made me cry, made me laugh and intrigued me.  I did however find the  flip flopping of different times and different scenes in the last half of the book confusing.  It seemed I was starting a new story several times.
B00B0HXC4I|5.0|I can't get enough of these fellas.  They are a talent that I have not heard in my years of music.  I hope more people attract to Ghost like bugs to a zapper.
B008KYOCA2|1.0|I don't know why this is so popular. The interface is clunky, it doesn't sync with my google calendar, and the documentation is in broken English. I deleted it already.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Best uno I've played in years. Best part is ur able to play online. Fun  customization , u get mad every time u have to pluck 2 or 4 card but that makes it fun<br /><br />GET THIS GAME
B002NXOQF2|5.0|I have loved this book since a teenager.<br /><br />Even as an adult it's amazing. Get on board! You won't regret it.
0307474259|3.0|The first several chapters were very clinical. Author bogs reader down in lots of data and studies. I would even recommend skimming, or skipping, those, unless you're in the medical profession. Last two-thirds has more pertinent content related to eating habits and suggestions for diet changes. However, is interesting that many of his conclusions back up the main theme of another book about weight gain, entitled Wheat Bellies. Although, not fat, I was having blood sugar problems -- prediabetic. And I lost over 25 pounds by cutting way back on carbs, before I read either book. Is all common sense ... and exercise.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|Touching story.<br /><br />Thoroughly enjoyable page to page. The kindle version is easy to read without any formatting errors.<br /><br />Get on board.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|It was one of those typical Hollywood movies. It's a Friday night movie when you decide to stay in and relax
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Im not much of a reader but this book is spectacular i am definitely reading the other two!!! Im absolutely mind blown astonished and excited for the next book!!
B009GX69RK|5.0|What a genuinely fun way to relax. The New Girl Season 2 (and Season 1 for that matter) is also as charming and funny as it is relaxing. Put on some PJ's and grab a snack, because you will want to be comfy while watching the DVD. Why do you need to be comfy, you ask? Because you will want to watch the entire season in one sitting. Simply addicting! So go on...get the New Girl Season 2, and have a good time.
B00ADS90EQ|5.0|I  love  this  movie. I  own  the CD and DVD  also. It's a  feel  good  comedy  and I  love  the  quirkiness  of  it.
0062014536|4.0|I read this when it first came out and have been sitting on my review ever since. First, I want to say that I really enjoyed this series as a whole. Lauren has a beautiful style of writing that is a pleasure to read. She has a wonderful use of words and flow of writing. Her pacing, her descriptions, her characters - all are excellent. Now getting back to the characters - I love their dimensions, their thoughts, their intensity of their actions, and the variety and honesty of who they are and what and why they do the things they do.<br /><br />The concepts of this series are not entirely outlandish, and how these characters react to their circumstances (both good and bad) was told honestly and believably. What I particularly enjoyed about this last book was that we get both Lena and Hana's POV. I know that some didn't care for Hana's POV, but I felt it was really important. So often in these types of books and series we only get the \\"good guy's\\" POV. I loved the other side of the story told through Hana's eyes. It really added that extra bit of depth that I felt was vitally important to this series.<br /><br />Love triangles are not my favorite thing, and in this series, though I did not love it, it did certainly make things interesting. Particularly when you consider the fact that this entire world revolves around the threat of love. So a love triangle, while not my favorite literary device, most certainly has it's place. I had stronger feelings toward one particular guy than the other, but I also empathized with the other guy's situation, as well as Lena's dilemma. Did I think Lena handled things perfectly? No. But she's young and if I were in her exact situation, I simply cannot say how I would have reacted, which makes these situations more realistic.<br /><br />My dilemma with this final book was the ending. It's not that I'm against open endings and an author's freedom to end a book the way she wants. I appreciate the reasoning behind how things ended. But I was left with many questions. I even asked Lauren at a signing if she always knew how things were going to end for one particular character (because this person's outcome simply crushed me) and she said yes. So the fact that Lauren held to her vision and intention should be respected. It just doesn't mean I loved it. But I liked it. Then I created my own extended ending and my own epilogue in my mind. But I honestly would have loved Lauren's epilogue, or even a fourth book (though if she decided to kill everyone off, than I guess I would not have loved her epilogue, lol).<br /><br />Bottomline: This is an excellently written series with wonderful, multi-dimensional characters. This final book, though not my favorite of the series, is still a worthy read and provides the needed depths of both sides of the battle, making this stand out next to similar books in this genre.s left with many questions.

B00594XOZU|5.0|I love it.It's like texting but better.I think teens and preteens would like it. If your phone doesn't take pictures this would be a cool thing to if you had a smart phone or a tablet.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Just downloaded a few days a go. Love it so far. Recommend it highly to anyone who likes to create.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Amazing book could not put it down... highly recommended<br />It all seems so real that you cry, laugh, and praise the book
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|Loved this game until update. Now keeps sending me to the app store but no unpate available. Can't play anymore. Someone please fix.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|I bought this book because I have been watching the TV series and wanted to know the story behind it. The book is a page turner and depicts a situation and setting we don't always get to see. Not quite as glamorous or drama-filled as the TV series and makes a nice grounded companion piece to it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really like minions so this is a very good app if you also like minions.<br />Have fun enjoying this game:)
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|It was shorter and creepier than I expected, but a very good story.  Would have liked more filled out ending.
B008Y5OWMK|4.0|Heaven's Gate is not a perfect movie, but it is an eye to behold! This film is a bit too long, but once you sit down to watch it it won't seem that way. Gorgeous photography sets too. The very beginning of the film or first several minutes don't really seem to be needed, but on the whole a very near perfect movie.
1439170916|5.0|I have brain cancer - my second cancer - I've had thyroid cancer before - So I wondered whether it was a good idea to read this book or whether it would depress me or even upset me.  On the contrary it has been a great pleasure to read.  It is an exciting read - Will Self's quote on the back of my edition is about right - \\"Feels like a thriller more than anything else\\".  That's about right!  Mukherjee writes so clearly about the science that it's not hard to follow the suspense he's creating as he describes patients and research experiments.  Moreover, it's a connected tale, and as a cancer patient I've found it very interesting to learn how medical science got to where I could have the treatments (successful so far!) that I've had.  It describes few cancers in detail - there is quite a lot about leukemia though - he only includes enough to illuminate the particular development in cancer research and treatment he's describing.  I'd recommend this book to anyone with an interest in cancer - I came to it thinking cancer was pretty simple - it's just about mutations, right?  No, there's a lot more to understand that is relevant to the experience and treatment of the disease.  I think what I've found most interesting, has been the discussion of the individual genes that have been discovered that lead to some of the behaviours of cancer, e.g. ras.  I knew nothing about all these individual genes and their influence on cell behaviour.  I am not a scientist as such, more a humanities person, but I found it all very straightforward to follow and enjoyable to read.
B00B769XB8|3.0|Hansel and Gretel : Witch Hunters is a fair movie with good special effects. I liked the movie, but would have liked it more if it would have had a better story and less violence and gore.
1616551607|4.0|The Sky features the artwork of Yoshitaka Amano who developed the characters in the video game series Final Fantasy. This is a reprint of three previously rare books and is a high quality work.<br /><br />There are pages of sketches of heroes and creatures encountered in the games. Some are pen and ink with a simple watercolor accent of one color. Others are fully painted. All are pretty amazing, and show a vivid artistic imagination.<br /><br />What you won't find are many words. There is no introduction, and while there are some character names sprinkled throughout, there is a lack of description. It's been a while since I played some of these games, so I vaguely remembered some of the characters, but the art is consistent. It's probably for more of a niche collector, and one who is more familiar with the Final Fantasy series, but I enjoyed poring through the pages and enjoying a top fantasy artist.
B00C7JFIRC|4.0|I liked Oz the Great and Powerful for it's photography sets and costumes. I thought the story could have been better, but never the less I did enjoy this film. Excellent cast too.
B0019IB0II|4.0|This book has a ton of good information that was never printed before about stroke and its aftermath. Jill Bolte Taylor's experience helped me understand what happens during a stroke and gives great advice on how to help someone who has had a stroke.
B00CFA225Y|4.0|I really liked Jack the Giant Slayer for it's story and great special effects. The sets and costumes were great along with the photography. Gorgeous color too.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I have it my PC so I bought it for my tablet too. It is a simple little game to relax with.
B006P3HXZG|3.0|This movie is an enjoyable movie with excellent animation. And if you love cats, I recommend it highly. I have loved cats all my life and used to breed Persians before Hurricane Katrina. I only have one kitty now, which is plenty enough. Also a funny movie too.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|I bought this game for my desktop computer several years ago. I really liked it. When I saw it for my tablet I wasn't sure if it would be worth my time to even try since I'm pretty disappointed with these types of games for the smaller platforms. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the game runs smoothly and I haven't found any glitches with it. The puzzles are interesting. I'm glad I gave it a try.<br /><br />I'm using an Asus tablet (Android).
B009MO5ES8|4.0|I liked , Premium Rush on all levels. The story , the acting, especially Joseph Gordon-Levitt. The photography, and the whole concept of this film are excellent.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game I wish this game had more minons and<br />you could be gru love it laugh out loud! !!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I had heard great things about this book and it was just ok for me.  Perhaps I was expecting too much.  If I had randomly bought it  at the bookstore or airport I probably would have given it more stars.  That being said while I was reading the book it was definitely a page turner for me. I think the ending was a little far fetched,  if you want an easy entertaining read I think it is worth it.  There are definitely books that are worse....
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Classic video game lovers will get all of the inside jokes and the story is really great.  Performances by all are excellent.
B0050DZ8J0|4.0|Much more 'let's get dowm to business' than on other social media sites.<br /><br />This is more of  an electronic format to  keep  up with the Professionals in your daily lives.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|This is such a cool series!  What a great story line.  I won't lie, Snow and Charming get a bit irritating...but you HAVE to live Rumplestiltskin/Mr. Gold.  We are working on perfecting our Rumple impressions because he is so cool.  I can't wait for the next season!  Highly recommend.  Great family show.
B007D5E7C2|4.0|Uma is fab as the main character...power to the woman for once :)<br />Great movies especially on a double disc
B009U9S6FI|5.0|I love that there is a Kindle version available.  Frankl's perspective from his experience is very meaningful and insightful. Amazing book.
B006QSL9XC|5.0|Just visited the actual Gettysburg. Was at Little Round Top twice and the site of &#34;Pickett's charge&#34; twice - which were featured in the film.  We could &#34;feel&#34; the experience by watching the movie!  All the actors were wonderful!  Jeff Daniels (who is from our area in Michigan) was extraordinary.  His portrayal of Chamberlain was beautiful!  He captured the fear, the sense of responsibility, the honor, and the courage of a great man! Jeff - you're a great actor!  Thank-you!
0307277453|4.0|Book shipped very fast, and my brother says it's a good read.  He's going into high school and must read a science book over the summer and write a paper on it. He says it's an easy read, and understandable and not too long either.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|So much fun I hate it, couldn't put it down. I love these types of games once I got started I was hooked,finished way to soon though. They need to make them longer. Would recommend to anyone who likes match 3 games.
B0095NCXKI|5.0|I gave this to my friend for the holidays and she loves it.  We've watched it together multiple times and it never gets old. I love this show!
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Best thing i've read since hunger games! I could not put it down. It was so fast paced with twists left and right, and you have so many questions while you read. It just kept me interested and sucked in the whole time. I'd recommend it to anyone who loves Sci-Fi or the Hunger Games
B0063GORYU|5.0|It took me a little while to get into Spider, and I thought it impossible to win, but once I figured it out, I have yet to go back to regular solitare.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|the goals are endless and yes there is a random element that makes every game a challenge to me and you.
1410430103|5.0|I have read several REACHER books and I enjoy the plots, characters and locals. I have ordered the latest book I can't wait to<br />read it.
B008LD09LS|5.0|its the only app you need - i suggest a tablet so you can see the view from height though.. small screen = minimal view in flight
B009FZHYKU|5.0|LOVE this Show...Never Was A Huge Zombie Fan, But The Characters And Plot are So Good!! Can't Wait Til Season 4!!
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|Those actor are so cool i love specially this one  . When i was watching i look like crazy laughing so loud but i didn't care lol
0393343405|5.0|This book is well researched and historically provocative.  By centering the book on the little known (these days) poem by Lucretius, On The Nature of Things, written a couple centuries BCE, the author is able to trace the history of the known world and identify how the world became &#34;modern&#34;.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Exelent I recomend it to everyone. Suzanne Collins has done it again people. She worked up another miracle.  2 thumbsup
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Loved the book,  as good as the movie, very well written, read  the book  first,  a good heartwarming love story but suspenseful
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is well put together and very much addicting. If you're into Temple Run I encourage you to try this one. I can't get enough of it!
1400069742|3.0|I bought this book to get a better feeling for the isolationist/anti war/ pro Germany movement.  It largely served the purpose.  I ended up with a much better understanding of the Lindberghs (both Anne and Charles) and some sympathy for his plight as America's hero.  The author, however appeared to be engaging in significant revisionist history in the portrayal of FDR.  I have read widely about this era - from the viewpoint of Churchill and the English as well as from the view point of Roosevelt and the American political scene.  (also a bit from the German and Russian perspective)  Nowhere was found the kind of recalcitrance on the part of FDR described in this book.  It was a steady theme of the author which ignored both the political realities and the actual facts.  I'm afraid is rather spoiled an otherwise interesting book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is an awesome game . It gives you an adrenaline rush. I play this game everyday. . Highly recommended
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|A lot of sci-fi movies nowadays are all about the CG and action. This movie had everything from CG, action, and more importantly an actual story. I had my doubts about this movie because of Tom Cruise but this made me realize Tom Cruise is a really good actor. Morgan Freeman was awesome as always.
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|As always, my son enjoys his kindle and he loves playing this game.  He is intrigued on war and war stories from his grandfather.
B001IF252M|5.0|I haven't tried other VGA adapters, but this one is certainly durable and functions as intended. I have had it for over a year and have no complaints. Even fits tightly into the ports.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|From sad beginning to happy ending was an enjoyable and inspirational story.  I would really like to visit this town and then characters. Tough subject matter, dealt with understanding and great supportive characters. I look forward to reading the rest of this series. Janice Mote
B000GFLKEY|5.0|I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys action movies, explosions, and the excitement of a well done heist.
B00DHKKN6Q|2.0|This game similar to candy crush but with bubbles. This is an addicting game. But I could live without the ads.
B00005V9HH|5.0|I really enjoy movies like this. The whole movie keeps you on the edge of your seat and I can't wait to watch it again.
B00CRS5HII|5.0|ONE OF DARIUS'S BEST HE'S AWESOME WHOLE ALBUM IS AWESOME WAGON WHEEL STANDS OUT FOR ME CAN'T REMEMBER NAMES OF OTHERS BUT GREAT MUSIC
B000M5AJQS|5.0|I have enjoyed this movie every time I've seen it.  A definite must see when it comes to intense shoot em up meets organized crime drama.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|This is a sweet little series - very relaxing to watch with all of the English stereotypes we have grown to love.
B000K7VHQE|4.0|I watched it once and enjoyed the story, but not sure if I'll watch it again. One of those movies I would rather rent than buy but still glad you watched it.
0763660531|5.0|Though ostensibly created for young children, the beauty of Becker's debut, his wordless storybook, also presents something for the rest of us. Don't rush through it, but spend some time lingering over each page, filling the cup of your own imagination from the richly beautiful illustrations. Read it with a child, and watch the magic unfold. Read it by yourself, and rediscover your own sense of enchantment. If this wonderful book doesn't touch your heart, have someone check your pulse.
B000EGF0B4|5.0|I have always enjoyed watching this movie. Its not a very complex story but the message is simple and meaningful. I also recommend reading the story, short but enjoyable too.
B007GCY8FS|1.0|before it becomes so absurd that it isn't even worth finishing?<br />First of all, Sherlock Holmes would BEG to study at his feet. Reacher's analytic ability is even more acute than Mr. Spock.<br />And skills? An admitted \\"only average\\" driver he is still able to drive 80mph on a dark highway, see the woman in the back seat blinking her eyes/looking left and right.<br />But Wait!! there's more...It's a code!! In short order good old Jack is \\"in the know\\".  The coded info provided by the brilliant cocktail waitress hostage makes it clear that things ain't good.<br />In fact, things are so bad that I deleted this thing from my Kindle library.<br />Be warned<br />Reacher Creature said it all....check his review.
B00A285OOW|4.0|But still really good!  This whole series, The Cousins' War has been great, as was The Tudor Series.  Wish there were more!
B000FCKGPC|5.0|The scope and breadth of these books is truly a wonder!  I can't wait to read the final book, especially to see what Tyrion is up to!
B001XUH69Y|5.0|A classic. I have seen this movie , maybe, 50 times over my lifetime.  A story of bravery, romance and the endurance of the human spirit
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|This gives you a look into what it really took to make some of the greatest albums of the last 3 decades.
B005544TRQ|4.0|Enjoy the season. The characters are funny and smart. I liked the concept of the show. The actors are great
B00CWY76CC|2.0|do not know how the game works///???  instructions are not informing on how to use.,CAN any one explain the game ?
B0012DP8A6|5.0|I COULD WATCH THIS MOVIE OVER AND OVER AGAIN. THE CHARACTERS IN THIS MOVIE CRACK ME UP AND ALL FOUR OF THOSE GIRLS CAN SING.
B009RX8MQ0|5.0|Amazon is listing the DVD-Set of the second season of Revenge without any info on extras. In fact they wrote None. This is not true, since this will be included as Special Features on the Second Season DVD Set:<br /><br />- Audio commentary on \\"Illusion\\"<br />- Audio commentary on \\"Forgiveness\\"<br />- Audio commentary on \\"Truth - Part 2\\"<br />- \\"The Sound of Revenge\\" - Featurette 14:50 min<br />- \\"Dressing Miss Davenport\\" - Featurette 8:19 min<br />- Deleted Scenes (35 scenes - ca. 40 mintes)<br />- Blooper Reel<br />- \\"Schooled in Revenge\\" Trailer
0811879542|1.0|I bought this book based on the reviews. I was expecting way more from it and find it pointless. The book has you push dots on pages, shake it, turn it etc and the next page prints the \\"reaction\\" from what you did. If it at least made noises when you do those things, that would've made it more interesting. My 3&4 year olds were done with it by page 5. I also expected better quality but the covers feel like they are made out of thin cardboard and it's just not very sturdy overall. Its not a true hardcover, more like a thinner version of what they use for the pages of board books. Im very disappointed in this purchase and I wasn't expecting to be.
B002APU580|5.0|I love this show and Keira Knightley is amazing!  Sometimes I'll watch this show 2 times in a day.  I'm always watching for something different in the surroundings or facial expressions etc.  Love the archetecture of the time and furnishings in the homes, etc
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great graphics. Fun to play wi the right level of difficulty. Use expert level. Great combine object puzzles,but could use some more combines in hidden objects. All in all a perfect game!
B00004SYWZ|5.0|The CD shows off the multi-talented group and their diverse songwriting. It still has that pop sound trademark but the songs are solid.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game, but there's three reasons why I don't play much anymore.<br /><br />1. It lags really bad sometimes.<br />2. The prices for the boards and characters are RIDICULOUSLY expensive.<br />3. It gets boring after a while, and mostly a time passer after that.<br />It's a fun game, but it isn't as fun as when I first got it.
B004UUKDNA|3.0|The CD is not one I can listen to for long periods of time. A few songs are okay, but after a while, they begin to sound redundant.
B00B6OEDS4|3.0|Rhye has some amazing tracks on this CD.  They are bringing back 90s R&B with electronic soul underscoring deep and moody vocals.  Unfortunately the whole album isn't great all the way through, but the handful of tracks that are standouts make it worth owning and supporting.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|If more &#34;romantic comedies&#34; (ew) were this well made, this thoughtfully directed and this smartly acted, then movies might actually be worth paying attention to again.
1449433251|5.0|I ordered the paperback copies and they are so well packaged.  They are heavy-duty well-bound books with all of the favorite Calvin & Hobbes comics and stories inside.  My husband loved them as a birthday gift.  They look great anywhere and aren't so precious that you can't take them out, read them, have fun, and then put them away.  Well worth it.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|So I am about half way through and choosing myself is the best thing I have done my whole life... The advice in the book is just awesome and really really simple... And to top it all off... You quite the funny guy James. Awesome style of writing and very inspiring.
B000JMLFLW|4.0|It's very different from the movie. It had settings that weren't in the movie. That is what made it interesting.
B0013FNC38|1.0|Bad Business Dealings!!  I ordered the Jason Mraz cd of We sing, We dance, We steal things, and I only received &#34;We Sing&#34; which contained only 4 songs. When I contacted Paige One, and asked if more cd's were coming since I didn't receive the complete cd, I was told that I &#34;may&#34; have to return it.  When I inquired about returning the cd, I was told that the original cd I ordered was not in stock and I should order from another seller.  Instead of refunding my money, which was the price of a complete cd, I now have to reorder and repay.  Not happy with Paige One and do not recommend to my enemies to order from them.
B00B3L3RPA|5.0|A classic. Great book. Recommend for anyone, a very easy read you would be surprised. Loved it. It will catch you off guard a few times!
1401941893|4.0|The cover is so bright and positive and pretty, that I shall confess it really made me want to like this book.  And, I do like it a bit, but not with any particularity.  There's nothing profound here, nothing I've found earth shattering enough to change or rebuild a life.  Nothing that provoked an \\"Ah-Ha!\\" moment.  It feels like a collection of positive-speak that I've mostly heard or read before, no deeper than your better-than-average Cosmo article.<br /><br />I also took issue with how high the appearance oriented chapters ranked in the table of contents.  It gave me a bit of a bad taste that chapters of \\"Mirror,Mirror\\" and on \\"You are What You Eat...\\" began the book.  And, though the advice in those passages isn't particularly bad, I took issue with that framework. (By \\"framework\\" I reference the titles for those chapters as well as primary placement.)<br /><br />Overall, it's pretty positive bathroom, office-waiting-room reading, but also not overly memorable.
B0015AARJI|4.0|lever is functional and fun, is just what I needed because the product is described as advertising thanks for product
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|a fine and free app.  No problems downloading and works great.  The large screen print is very nice for these tored old eyes.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|addictive!  fun for all ages.  hubby and I will sit for hours trying to solve it then the kids will take over.  keep the levels coming.
B009NG1Q96|4.0|Liked the book. Read it in a single day<br />. Could not put it down. Really good read. Fast paced
B00AQB2A3I|5.0|For those of you familiar with Steven Wilson, you've come to expect nothing but sheer brilliance.  This doesn't let us down.  We are lucky to among those who have benefited from knowing his music!  Thanks SW!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It was a pleasure reading this story.  What I initially thought would be a slog through a rather depressing situation ended up showing the power of personal ethics, unstoppable innovation, and, of course, love.  Mr. Howey's talent for creating engrossing characters and engaging story lines is  superb.  I've just downloaded \\"Shift\\" and am looking forward to the read.  Also, I consider these books to be underpriced, and will be making a donation on Mr. Howey's website.
B00E8B1358|3.0|It was a entertaining movie. The effects were pretty amazing, but nothing special or outstanding. One of those &#34;it's a rainy day and there's nothing better to do&#34; type of movies.
142311339X|4.0|Well I liked that it had a protective cover but some of the pages we're bent. Although I did straighten those out other than that it was very nice. Well okay there is one more thing I don't think It had enough padding because it was basically just in card bored. Ya other than those it was perfectly fine!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Very good in some chapters.  Did get bogged down in some areas.  Pretty deep at times for me.  One of the better ones written about death experiences.
1423140591|3.0|There was some writing on it like &#34;It's my book so give me a doghnut&#34; and then it said who it belonged to. other than that it was fine.
0385504225|4.0|I loved ninety - five percent of this book.  but the end was a little strange it is one of his best mystery
B0061PEAUY|4.0|Kathy Reichs is an accomplished author as well as an obviously seasoned forensic anthropologist. I do get a little tired of the overly-wordy explanations sometimes, as they seem to stall the story. But a riveting read, and my first e-book!
1452126577|5.0|Well made book, cute and to the point. You don't see many hardback books anymore and this was a great surprise. Good binding and an entertaining read. I look forward to many other books from Grumpy.
B008OOYALE|1.0|from the sounds of it,its not that much fun and that it has a long time to breed dragons. not the best one out there...but Dragonvile is a lot better than this app...I hope I helped...:/
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Fun for the kids but I deleted this app because I'd rather have my kids playing flags of the world or rhythm cat, but it does use strategy so it's not that bad I suppose.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|Thought this a wonderful multiplayer game, it's awesome to play. Works terrific if you like shooters that is plus full use of  all the vehicles.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Ilove it,everyone in my family also play the game. We have lots of fun. You will have a great time with your kids!!! Get it.!!!!
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|Gangster love this game a lot of fun has a lot of World War Two facts and its exciting so far I noticed it doesn't save unless it's just acting up for me but I had stopped playing after first mission and I had to do over again and I hope asking me to vote didn't stop me and if I have to start over I will change my review
B004HWYTP4|5.0|A comedy Action!  Sure they threw in a little romance, but not so much as to detract from what it was supposed to be!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The product was received in a timely manner and was packaged well. I thank the seller for receipt of this product.
B000N2HCM4|5.0|A well written book giving an insight of the life and feelings of African-Americans. I recommend it very highly and it should be read by everyone.
B00846REIS|5.0|I was so sad when Cory got beat up. Made me cry.  I love these books. Couldn't wait for the next one.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Having books digitally to my kindle make it a product worth having.  This story is precious and for a dog lover like me, you would love it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|It was a great book. I couldn't put it down. I fell in love with Gideon  and Eva. Couldn't wait to read the next book.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I was glad that this book progressed the way it did. Gideon and Eva deserve to be together. I can't wait to see where they goes from here. The wait is killing me.
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie is really amazing.  I didn't think I'd be into it, knowing that it's about kids killing each other for national amusement.  Although I never read the books, I found myself rooting for characters, hating others, and crying over deaths.  According to friends who've both read the books and seen the movies, the crew did an excellent job at capturing the essence of the original stories in slightly less than two and a half hours.  I love it, I'll watch it again, probably buy it, you should watch it too!  It's a real check to see if you're human and have emotions.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|I thought it was a heartwarming story. I  was surprised that Jo ended up being a ghost.. In parts it was a real tear jerker.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|This is a really awesome feel good movie.  I would definitely recommend it for families with kids of all ages.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|This movie was very disappointing. The acting was terrible, the plot was horrendous. The visuals, however, were fantastic. The part played by Franco was clearly written for Depp and from there it became increasingly obvious that this movie was about how blonde, white women are good, while brunette, darker women are evil, and women can't do anything for themselves and turn into horrible witches because of men.
B005BUZJ6O|5.0|The only way to describe these young men is extremely talented. Music and books are extremely important to me and I listened to all I could find from these young men. If you don't give this music a chance you will be missing something! Something big.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|I love Gaiman's earlier works but this one fell short for me. I never felt like the story really developed like it could have. It was either a short story run on too long or an incomplete novel.
B008602KQI|4.0|Would not recommend for elementary aged children.  Some scenes are pretty graphic, and would give them nightmares.  Good movie, though.
0062255657|5.0|Have only recently discovered Neil Gaiman and his amazing otherworldly writing. Am enjoying reading every book I can written by him. This book was no disappointment.
B005ZCXPP0|4.0|I liked the way they put it together. Everything fit very well. Some good &#34;I love America&#34; stuff. That's all!
0763660531|5.0|No words are necessary for 'readers' of any age. Becker takes his audience on an imaginative and magical journey through his wonderful pictures. Can't wait to sit with my granddaughter and begin our own &#34;Journey.&#34;
B0086213XW|4.0|This work was created for the purpose of entertaining its audience  and it was very easy to watch. Would watch again. Purpose was entertaining rather than factual.
B004UNX1LS|5.0|this is an amazing app I no longer have to go to youtube to watch music videos!!!!All though they don't have every song on here they at least have all the good ones!!!
B009NQZVKG|5.0|This is a very fast moving suspenseful book.  It was fast moving with lots of action.  There were so many things going on but in the end the good guys win out.  If you like spy type stories and action you will probably like this story.  I do recommend it.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Tried to open the game as usual this morning, update prompt interrupted loading process, says \\"Newest Version is available! Please visit the App Store to update\\" with a green box \\"Go to App Store\\"...I click the green box and get sent to the app store, which shows my originally purchased app, I tap the 'open' hoping it is the updated version, and it sends me directly back to the 'Update' prompt on the original game load screen.  HATE loops like this....maddening.  Where is the update and exactly HOW does everyone access it??
B004LE7PCM|5.0|First time Sherlock Holmes reader, really enjoyable and amazing value for money. Wound definitely recommend it especially for somebody new to Sherlock Holmes like myself.
B00DYTKKGI|5.0|This game keeps my daughter busy for hours!  Even though there's only 4 patients and all the other &#34;cool&#34; stuff is locked (and I refuse to purchase it for $10), she still occupies herself with the free options provided. :)
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|Well it seems they buggered the game and created a update snafoo, i'm lvl 71 and no longer can get into this game cause it now tells me I must go to the app store to update and it does nothing but ( open ) the same said product, over and over again. I do so hope they correct this problem. Otherwise it's a pretty darn good time waster :). Good luck, hope to be able to continue on this venture! Best wish's to the rest of you out there! aka FloridaDave
B00CRMX53S|5.0|I heard this one track on a mix. I've been listening to it on repeat since. Figure, I might as well get the darn track it self.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is fun hilarious and addicting now I just wanna play it all the time.awesome is how I describe it in one word
B00COHAUD4|3.0|The movie was pretty interesting but it wasn't really that scary. I was expecting a lot more jumpy moments, but no luck here. I always recommend people to watch movies for themselves because everyone's tastes are different.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this thing! Most people enjoy the feeling of taking care of some thing. With this you can!!! I love minecraft and after a while, I get bored of playing minecraft so I do Dragon story! Dragon story also makes me happy after a (nother) argument with my sister.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I doubt there is a perfect way to end this series but I was really happy with this book. I was flying through it and really enjoying it and at the same time dreading the inevitable end of the series I started when I was 15 two decades ago.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is my favorite book series ever! The words hold so much power and captivated me when I read them. Thank you so much Suzanne!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Don't ususally like fantasy.  Book got me hooked.  Can't wait for the third.  Best bood of this type I ever read.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|As always, Greg Rollins is brilliant!  Sigma Force series never lets you down.  Love this book and cannot wait for the next one!
B00DYTKKGI|1.0|I wish I never got this app.you pretty much need to buy EVERYTHING. Even the DOCTOR'S KIT. This should not be free with all the purchases to make..and its just sad to see these kids!!! You need to clean up their blood,take out thorns, it's just so sad!<br /><br />DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU ARE RICH ON YOUR DEVICE!!!!!!
1594746036|2.0|I'd heard a great deal about this book, and visually it is quite exciting. The book is full of bizarre vintage photographs. Unfortunately, the story doesn't live ups to the photographs. Angsty teenager Jacob Portman goes to Wales to try and find out about his grandfather's past. A refugee from the Nazis, Abe Portman grew up in a children's home in Wales presided over by the enigmatic Miss Peregrine. A mysterious abandoned manse, time travel, and a new girlfriend will all help Jacob unravel the truth about his grandfather and himself.<br /><br />While there are elements of fancy added to the characters, the basic story is, rather, basic. There's lots of reviews that compare this book to X-Men, and yes, that's pretty much it. More problematically, this reads like a child's story. The book is classified as young adult, and that appears to be the one constituency that is not served. The pictures are not as integral to the story as their volume might have one believe. It seems like Riggs often wrote the plot around the pictures, and that doesn't necessarily make for the best plot choices.
1609611543|5.0|For the many people out there with IBS, I'd say give this a try.  I've been suffering from the symptoms of IBS for about 17 years, and have been experimenting with all of the recommendations out there.  The probiotic &#34;Align&#34; seems to help me quite a bit, but I would still have &#34;bad weeks&#34; every once in a while. Taking various fibers would seem to help for a little while and then I'd have a huge cramping period again and give that up.  I tried being Paleo for a while and did the Whole 30 diet, which helped, but I find these two options too restrictive and unsustainable. Lately I've just given up wheat, as recommended in this book and so far, so good.  I've been off wheat for two weeks, while still eating everything else.  My intestines are very happy, I have had no cramps, and I'm very regular every day.  While it is sad to look at a future in which there are no delicious treats made with wheat (and there are many), I am currently thinking that it will be very worth it to feel good all the time.  An added bonus is that I am less hungry in general and I have fewer cravings for sugar.
B004U7JYXS|5.0|I bought this because it saves a lot of money than buying the one in smaller packs. Overall the film are in great condition, and the shipping was pretty fast.
B00514HDNW|5.0|I am legend is a great book but you have your parents check the book before you read it. It is my fourth favorite book. It is about a man who survives 3 years whit vampires outside his house from dark till dawn.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Failed to see on broadcast TV,but just as well. It is much more interesting without commercial breaks. Julianna Margulies is totally believable and underplays effectively. The subplot about the travails of the law firm keeps things moving just below the episode's main theme. No car chases and no gunplay. I love Kalinda.
B008AX1HD8|5.0|Nice thriller with unusual developments and very lively and vivid descriptions of people and places. It is like visiting Sydney
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|A good book filled with everything a reader wants. Made me think about my life, very inspiring. Get this book! No bad things really, and completely recommend!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this game is a great time killer. all I want to do it just upgrade all the cars... then maybe ill be finished with it! lol
0807014273|5.0|The book is excellent, a must read for anyone looking for inspiration & the quest to succeed against all odds.
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|As a long time fan of Tetris and similar &#34;block clearing&#34; puzzle games, I find Slydris to be an elegant take on the genre.  Controls are simple, and the core design is clear and easy to understand.  The potential for cascades and combos using the special blocks is a nice touch, and the visual design and feedback are gratifying and pleasing on the eyes.  Sounds are great, and the music fits the mood of the game nicely.<br /><br />Of special note is the &#34;Zen&#34; play mode, which is something I wish more games had.  You can't really lose, you can just tinker with the game's mechanics and get a feel for how the blocks work.<br /><br />All in all, this is one of the best puzzle games I've played in years, and it's a great mobile game with intuitive and well-designed controls.  They don't come much better than this.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|After surviving abandonment , ten years abuse, enforced slave labor, starvation and deprivation of all human kindness in a horrible Catholic orphanage, a boy finally has a family. When his adoptive parents pass on, his loneliness prompts him to try to find a mate.  The ensuing events lead to an eventual heartwarming and sweet conclusion.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It was a good game to play I love horses and it shows me how to play the game fairly well
B009GX7IRA|5.0|NCIS gets better each season.  They never cease to surprise me with the suspense and different plots.  I can't wait till next season.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I log in to be told there's an update and a button to go to the app store. However the app store just has a button to open.  Where I'm told that there's an update and a button to go to the app store.....and round and round. Even deleted and reloaded, to no avail.
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|Hosseini is a vivid, authentic voice for the downtrodden of Pakistan and Afghanistan.  He is a great story teller.  His is an important story to hear and he tells it in a way that conveys to western sensibilities the richness and complexity of these turbulent times.  While &#34;The Kite Runner&#34; hangs together better, &#34;A Thousand Splendid Suns&#34; contains the same epic sweep.  It was hard to take, yet impossible to put down.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is fun and challenging.  it's good for kids and adults.  i would recommend it for anyone.  great fun.
B00AA2I2NK|5.0|I can get lost in this music -- and often do.  I like the minimalist composers (such as Philip Glass) and I have seen Einaudi called a minimalist.  I am not sure.  It is the very simple melodies that carries this music forward, not the complex interplay of rhythms.  Since getting this one, I have bought other Einaudi albums as well.  They have high points, but this one is consistently excellent.  With such spare music, there is a danger that it will quickly become boring.  I have not found that to be the case with this album.  Einaudi takes us on a journey of constant variation on his simple themes.  I don't know how many times I have listened to this record.  I still love it.  It gets me every time.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Ok like all these kinds games, you can play one levels 1-2 mins or for hours, you will love norm well worth the 99&cent;
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|the puzzles were interesting but I got it. love hos games<br />good brain games makes you use your head!! reallly love it
B005DJREJS|5.0|Couldn't stop watching. Just kept knocking them out one after another. Silly and fun! Kept me laughing.  Character driven.  Love the guidance counselor!  She's Brilliant!!!!
B0076UXKDG|5.0|I spent $3000 for the camera, $6000 for lens... I don't care how much this cost.  It's built like a tank, and fits the camera perfectly.<br /><br />The 800E feels so much better with this grip, even when shooting in normal horizontal mode.  I have slightly bigger hands, so this makes the camera fit just great.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|I believe this is a great show. Especially, for my especial need little boy. He loves the program and makes him calm down.
B0035O66CO|4.0|I was helping my grand daughter research the Dust Bowl. This story was one of about 9 others that she could choose to review. Times were very hard and different during this time of American history.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|I was on level 49 yesterday. Today it says I need to add 39mb of space and now it just says visit the app store for an upgrade. Fix this please
B00C3EM5J0|5.0|I bought this for a previous phone, and had to do it again.  Smaller dictionaries only have 40% of the words I look up.  This has 85-90%. TBM
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Wonderful book by a brilliant man. I encourage you to get your copy and read this honest and heart warming book.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|If you were a kid growing up this is the fast paced puzzle story for you!  So good!!! Even though I wasn't old enough to enjoy most of the 80's that did not deminish my enjoyment of the book at all. Fast paced and spoke to the nerd in me!!<br /><br />If you enjoy Dan Brown style action mystery this is a book you need to add to your list of books to read.<br /><br />!So good!!!

B008NEMPTO|5.0|I have seen the movie many times but I didn't truly experience the movie until I saw this 3D Bluray copy. It was incredible. The train effects towards the end of the movie may be the best use of 3D I have ever seen in a movie. As for the movie, I loved it on Bluray but absolutely loved it more in 3D.
0440244412|4.0|If you have made it to book 5 then you will completely understand when I say that Karen keeps her fast pace and answers your questions. I felt this series really gives you the chance to figure it out but keeps it interesting by not always playing by the rules. Most, if not all of your questions are answered and you truly do find satisfaction with your main players. If you find yourself still with questions you might want to pick up her spin off series about Danni.<br /><br />~Notteaurora
B001VLXNLU|5.0|I love the entire series of books but this book really hooked me!  The suspense and descriptive writing is great. PC Cast is a great author.
0812973992|2.0|I have tried to read this book 4 different times.  Each time I became a little more bored.  I have decided to give it up.  It may be great to some.....but not me.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoy this very much. Makes you think. Sometimes it seems hard other times you just over look something right in front of your eyes. Lol Good game.
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|Canada is one memorable read by a writer that has quickly moved up my \\"Must Read\\" list!  In short, the story as a morality tale told through the perspective of a man looking back on his formative, turbulent teenage years.<br /><br />I want to reveal nothing about the plot, but feel comfortable in saying that this is a story that is about re-invention; that is, every character here is, in short, running away from one destiny and towards another.  Some crash and burn in the attempt to re-discover, re-invent, and re-define themselves; others persevere and end up stronger for it.<br /><br />This story seems to operate as a modern Western, a morality tale, a tell-all confessional, a family drama, and a crime drama all at once, and it succeeds on all levels.  A life-affirming read, especially for those who experience rough times growing up and lived to tell about it.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Can be costly and whole app seems to be built around buying extras required to play game properly.  Is fun .
B001ILHY1I|5.0|good movie
B0091X2K0A|5.0|Classic movie.  Timeless story.  Funny but then transitions to tragic  This is a must see movie for a message about life and war.
B004EPZ06G|5.0|good movie
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This was well-researched and well-written in easy to understand sections. It brought great insight into introverts who are often misunderstood and overlooked for their quiet leadership style.
1401938906|1.0|Until I got to the first experiment, I was elated. But when the first experiment failed, it single-handedly made me question my belief in God. I cried for a half hour uncontrollably.<br /><br />I want to give my son faith that life can be good. But I'm sick, thinking that all hope is lost.<br /><br />Worse, I see all the good reviews. So apparently God, or the Force loves them more.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Who really doesn't like google?<br />Highly recommend it for anyone who doesn't have the ap built in already - just can't go wrong.
B004LQEYAG|5.0|I enjoyed watching this movie as much now as I did years ago when it first came out. You can't go wrong when it has Paul Newman and Robert Redford starring in it.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|only whale sperm could be more exspensive for such a small amount.. increase the size and not increase the price. great product though.
B005COO1X6|2.0|The story was hard to get into. The story didn't explain where the car came from or why it was there. I was left feeling empty. The characters felt real which is a definite Stephen King mark which is what I like about his stories. Other than that, I'll just stick to his longer stories.
0316228583|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I devoured it in a few days and was sad to turn that last page.  The subject matter is far from gay but that's what life is, isn't it?  We're all trying to make our way through this world, in our own little lives.<br />She is truly a master weaver.  The characters are believable and the story - while not earth shattering - is so well told and fluid that you don't even realise how far you've read.<br />Highly recommended
B009DCOU9S|4.0|A bit too much dialogue but one of the best hidden object games I've played in a while. Progresses nicely as far as level of difficulty.
B003EYVXTG|1.0|This movie is a low budget film and is boring from the get go! I can see where it would make it seem like most people in Missouri are meth addicts...trust me they are not! If you are looking for a high quality movie bypass this one!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. There were stretches when I just couldn't put it down. The author did a great job of using the collective memories of individuals to paint a complex but understandable picture for the reader. The story really examines both the best and worst of humanity, but avoids any hint of being \\"preachy.\\" I intentionally didn't see the movie because I wanted to read the book first, but I will be surprised if the movie can come out ahead of the book!
B00CS7ZIHI|4.0|I loved this band and everything they do is wonderful.  The band always changes and evolves.  No stagnation for Jared Leto!
1616551607|5.0|The quality of each art book included is quite amazing! The level of detail towards preserving the original works are truly astounding as the viewer is able to clearly discern which pieces were originally created utilizing different techniques such as water colors. Even the fabric case that houses the art books is visually stunning, fantastically made, and quite durable. Anyone who enjoys the art associated with Final Fantasies 1 - 10 should certainly consider buying this amazing collection! P.S. Those who buy the art books exclusively for viewing Final Fantasy 7 and/or 8 pieces will likely be discouraged as there are not many created by Yoshitaka Amano or at least there are not many in the associated art book included.
B00E8B1358|3.0|This one had lots of action. But like the first one better, had more of a plot line in it.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Best Blu-Ray package I ever ordered so far.  The box is high quality and can take a beating so that is good.  The internal set up makes it easier to take care of the disk.  The book that comes with the pack is great.  There is another set but that set comes with hot wheel size replicas of the vehicles in the series.  If I knew about that package before this one I would have ordered that package but this package is worth the money.
B0014D6PCO|5.0|This movie is a great way to reboot the Batman franchise. It has a decent plot and the action is fast-paced. Christian Bale's voice hasn't become completely ridiculous (that happens in Dark Knight) so it is overall highly enjoyable.
B005BDZQKU|5.0|This is the best package to order.  The footage is actually in Blu-Ray quality not just a step above dvd like other packages.  The collectibles in the package.  I am thinking about having the little replica movie posters framed maybe as a conversation piece.  All in all good box set.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Smh was very disappointed with my purchased...it was missing the bottom piece of the case to close the case was broken off and the headphone piece that screws into the phone case was missing. Like I said very disappointed
B000Q9IR0A|5.0|This is the book to read for most mid level managers.  Execution is definitely something that a lot of executives up or down do not take seriously or just leave to the people below to do.  However execution is really the key to any strategy
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This show should never have been cancelled. The writing, music, effects and cast are wonderful.  The characters become your friends.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Wasn't sure I'd like it, but it reads easily and provided an interesting insight into the complexity of the Presidency and how former Presidents can still be very effective.  Interesting insight into the personalities of our former Presidents and their relationships with each other and, in particular, their successors.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|Showed it to friend that never saw it and he loved it too. Wishes he saw it as a kid.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love mindcraft my best friend got me in to it been playing it since. Play it all the time
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci are simply the best!!! This is one of those films I can watch over and over and never get tired of!!
B000IDEORY|4.0|Quality was not so good...guess because it was on HD tv....Maybe the original<br />was made before hd tv...so I was expecting more...
B00C2VIA52|5.0|This is one of the best games that I have ever seen as a kid and I have seen a lot of cool games.
B007TK77QE|5.0|This book has all the ingredients that one can relate to. The interactions of teenagers with parents at their worst. And thinking that everyone else has great family relationships looking from the outside. But... the old saying about what goes on behind closed doors....<br />The class of people who think they are a cut above others, to the point of exclusion socially, is in my opinion very well written and sums up society.
0316247545|5.0|I loved the book. It completely met all the expectations i had for it and i it had a little more. I was very pleased.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This mouse met my expectations and beyond. If you are debating on whether or not to get this mouse because Anker isn't a big company then don't worry about it. They will deliver.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|We have watched this film probably 20 times. First in the theater, then as DVD rentals and now whenever we want.<br />Need an uplift? Want to smile? Just watch this movie!
B008JFUREC|5.0|My grandchildren loved the first movie and was so excited about the second one.  The 3 year old was totally consumed for the entire movie.  The 21 month old got a little bored after an hour.  I will buy this when it comes out on dvd, because there isn't a lot for children to watch that is clean.
B00AZMFO6I|4.0|Let's just say, we hum this tune a lot!! Wilfred steals the show, sorry maggie.<br />LOVED the final credits showing the &#34;retired&#34; musicians and the behind the scenes options.<br />Thank you, thank you!
B005WMQ5R8|5.0|Brain-injuring, hypnotic, blissfully eye-melting cinema that punches you in the gut with its visceral nature. Hand drawn over multiple years of hard work and labor from the studio culminates in an eyegasm of lustful and rich imagery that would make any fan of anime and/or racing movies pleased.<br /><br />My only - and I mean ONLY complaint about the movie is the male lead's English dubbed voice. From a purely nitpicky character design standpoint, his English voice does't seem to match the character's look. But, that's not reason to avoid experiencing and sharing this film.<br /><br />I just bought my first 50&#34; LED, and put this bad boy in… Yes. Buy this movie.
B007NZQU72|5.0|I always knew I was different but after reading this book I now know I am a  highly sensitive person. This is first book I have read about HSP and I am eager to read more. I ran across this book by \\"accident\\" and I believe it has changed my life. My parents and ex husbands have always tried to change me but I don't need to be changed. I am what I am and it feels so good to finally hear I am okay. I have always needed time to myself, to meditate, to pray or just regroup after a busy day. I have downloaded her other books and can't wait to read them. If you are or know someone who is HSP, read this book. This has brought me out of the shadows and into the light. I will not feel guilty anymore for being different. I have some wonderful qualities and now feel proud of them. G od bless Elaine Aron for this book.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|The third in a series and it is awesome. Looking forward to the next. Better than the TV show! But I understand why they can't put some things from the book on TV!!!!!!
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I loved Downton Abbey until I watched the last show of season 3, and theykilled of Matthew. It make you think that when life is going at its best, then the worst happens.  Was so disappointed.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Another dud for FAOTD.  Maybe these apps should be tested by Amazon for functionality and compatibility before being presented to the masses.  Reviews as far back as 2012 complaining about the inability to save edited pics, and that is still an issue.  Rapidly losing faith in FAOTD.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|it just isn't my kind of entertainment.  However, I am quite certain that younger folks will find it great fun.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Just started watching this show in May of 2013.  Was getting the DVD's from the library & my husband & I were always waiting expectantly for the next one; as soon as we would get it we watched the whole thing through.  Imagine my surprise when we could get it for FREE on Amazon, when we wanted it because we were Prime members!!  It streamed seamlessly & we watched all the episodes without leaving our home!  Thanks Amazon!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|i found it to be great fun...and quite challenging for me.  i found the graphics and set-ups to be quite entertaining.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|The reader does what is does.  No more no less.  There are no surprising fireworks shows or aha moments.  For the person that wants to track progress the unit does so.  It bookmarks and highlights as well.  And does sync with three units for reading.  great feature.  Phone tablet computer I read any where any time.  I do wish it would do the magic of page turning.
0060853980|5.0|No . Really. Is one of thats thing what you must do before die... and I sure tou that apicalypse never have been funnier xD
B006LR0XLM|4.0|Greatest electronic storage locker since the phonograph.  Pics music recipes anywhere 24/7.  Share with family/friends.  Im happy and you can be too.
B00DZSPKZY|4.0|I love the simplicity and usability of this app. The automatic sorting of apps makes everything very easy to find while the home screen makes the apps I use most easily available.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|I hate this dictionary so much.<br />I really really hated it so much that I would throw it away.<br />I hate it
B00EI6E17A|5.0|Danceable, singeable! Awesome! Cool! Very awesome lyrics and chorus. It also has a very awesome chorus/pre-chorus! Another classic single! I Love it! Lets go ARTPOP! :)
0307474259|5.0|Followed the advice and lost 20 lbs in 3 months.  I believe that the &#34;food pyramid&#34; from the USDA is false propaganda.
B00CL0J99K|3.0|There's a lot of good ideas on this movie but what they did with The Mandarin !!!!! My god ! He was the nemesis of Iron Man and now he's just a trickster ! The actors are good and the action scenes are simply the best of the trilogy but I can't excuse the producers to what they made to my favorite vilain.<br />A real dissapointment after the masterpiece of \\"Avengers\\" !<br /><br />Maybe because I'm french and the american audience is different but as a Comic book fan : 1 on 10 about the story but 10 on 10 for the action and the visual effects !
1401322786|5.0|Yet another awesome book by Mitch Albom, one of my favorite writers.  I've read them all, and he continues to amaze me.  His subjects touch the heart, and he writes from his soul.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Another addictive game of Angry Birds. It has gotten so popular that they now make vinyl stickers for bedroom walls like those made for athletes.<br /><br />My grandson is wild about Star Wars Angry Birds and his walls will have the vinyl stickers come his 4th birthday soon!<br /><br />Great game and at a great price, free.
B00CL6HGIK|4.0|It wasn't a great movie but walberg and crow both gave great performances, as usual. Definitely worth watching. The end
B008JGSM6G|5.0|If you want a game to challenge you, this is it!<br />This will keep you mind working for all the time you are playing.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Love this game so much.My son shows his creativity ,so much in this game .tThank you Amazon .Wish I could sync it to my IPad
B007V65R54|4.0|Some interesting case studies on statistics as we (as a society) march on to BIG DATA.  I was initially draw to this book via an NPR interview and his contributions to FiveThirtyEight.  I'm not a follower of sabermetrics--I like the movie Moneyball and will leave it at that!<br /><br />I would have appreciated a bit more insight into the pitfalls of &#34;garbage in, garbage out&#34; but I think Silver does an admirable job on coverage of misinterpretation of data.  Silver tackles topics from political science to environmental science which is very ambitious with the thread of statistics.<br /><br />I imagine that this publication may polarize some in his field; however, I think this book is worth a read for both the technical and non-technical minded.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|It was great.  Very witty.  It is a quick read and very enjoyable.  I definitely recommend it to you all.
0385366752|2.0|I stumbled across this audiobook accidentally.  I listened to the UNABRIDGED version that was read in two voices, one for Nick and one for Amy.  The spoken narrative was well done.  While I can appreciate the idea behind this story and the plot twists that it takes, I hated this book.  The first part of the book had me depressed. I kept thinking Geez, am I going to listen to this whole thing and just find out after all of that, he killed her?  Bleh  But then the second third began and we find out there is a twist!  Hooray.  I felt better already.  For like five seconds.  Because then we find out that Amy is as unlikable as Nick is.<br /><br />You can have an amazing story, but if your characters are horrible, you have no one to root for.  You don't care what is going to happen to anyone and that is what happened with Gone Girl.  I could care less.  What I did care about was when would it end?  It needed serious editing because it was way too long.  I was relieved when it ended.<br /><br />I've read some of the other reviews here and its good that so many people can look past the awful characters and just appreciate the story idea.  It's kind of like the first Dexter book... such an awesome concept, but what horrible writing.  I couldn't bring myself to read a second! I also can see where some people may have felt that it ended too quickly and the complaints about the end, but I disagree with that.  Because how else would you wrap this story up?  It had to be that way and dragging it out even longer would have been a horrible idea.<br /><br />So, overall, I hated it, but I gave it two stars because I feel like the concept was a good one, the problem is I don't think you can tell this story and make ANYONE likable (Well, I liked Rhonda Boney - not sure of spelling since I was listening versus reading) and that was the inherent problem with the story overall.  So, good try, but a fail for me.
B00DYTKKGI|2.0|I really couldn't understand this game.I thought me being a nurse I would like it.That didn't work for me.Mybe it need instructions.
B000JML90Y|2.0|relative boring in its approach to explaining evolution, reading it is quite tedious, there must be a more engaging method of presentation
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This is how 3D should look.  Action slows down a couple of times but that is to develop the characters somewhat.  Nothing you will object to.  I have already watched twice and will again many more times.
B003VIWO8Y|4.0|I am neither a Megadeth nor Metallica fan - I am a casual listener of both - so I did not buy this book out of some blind devotion for all things connected to either band.  However, in recent years I have read many blurbs or quotes from Mustaine and found him to be rather humorous and insightful.  I read an excerpt from this book and put on my to-read list and about a year later, here I am.<br /><br />First off, Mustaine (or his handler) is a good writer.  He kept the entire book interesting and I was always reluctantly putting the book (or Kindle, rather) down at bedtime or at the end of my lunch break.  Despite Mustaine leading a somewhat common life to rock and rollers of that era, it's still fresh for some reason.<br /><br />Second, I had no idea how much his firing from Metallica affected him and he was very open about that entire situation.  Maybe that is already well known by fans but again, I am a casual listener.<br /><br />My only gripe was despite the book's ability to draw you in and hold your attention, when I was finished, I felt like more could have been said.  I did not feel like I had the whole picture of the &#34;story&#34; like I had after reading Slash's autobiog or Ace Frehley's or Peter Criss's (all great reads).  The complaint is that Mustaine is a likeable guy and you want to know more about him.<br /><br />Overall, this was a great read and I recommend it to any fan of rock music.  It's not on a gift list for my mother but I have recommended it to my brothers and friends!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I dont really watch drama more than once but I have been watching it over and over again so that says something.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|Loved this book. Tear jerker, gut wrenching and sweet all at the same time. Must read and I will be reading it again.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|The story is very interesting - We read it for our book club. It stimulated a lot of good discussion.
B005898CFI|5.0|Good no matter how many times I watch it. I really enjoy red buttons in it too. A good one for anyone.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Love hidden object games. This ia the first one I found that involves coins and long continuous play. I can understand most people don't have the patiance for this type of game but when ur like me and finish a game in one day this is the best way to stay intertwined.
B003G4W49C|4.0|A very interesting sci-fi type book. I couldn't stop turning the pages. I love being able to read a book and never want to put it down and it definitely fit.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I finished the game then had to go back and get three stars each level plus pick up all the awards. Couldn't help myself - it was Rio fun.
B001CDD84Y|4.0|I really liked the Jumpers they remind me a lot of the Nightcrawler from X-Men. The action scenes were fast paced and the movie had some decent effects, it also had Samuel L Jackson.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|Best movie im Years, best plot, and never a dull moment:) 5*****!!! Love the culture it showed, and the difference in ones home can be by the surroundings in there &#34;home environment&#34;

B00BPWDMP2|1.0|Put it in my car player after playing two lanes of freedom and it rejects the disk and will not play
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|It is plenty of fun but I uploaded it before playing so the loading screen tells me to update the already updated game. Also plenty of other small bugs.

B000PDYVVG|4.0|It's a book that I keep going back to and discover a new aspect every time I read read it.  The way the three countries themselves act as characters in a subtle way is what strikes you... A very good read and makes you introspective.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Maggie Smith and Shirley MacLaine together are priceless, so funny and smart.<br />New characters thrown in with the familiar ones add more drama.<br />Great writing all around with superb delivery by first class actors.<br />Not binging on episodes but savoring one at a time. Love it.
