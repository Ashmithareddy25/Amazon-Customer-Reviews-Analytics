0786838655|5.0|In my opinion The Lightning Thief is one of the best books that I have read.  The plot is really interesting and exciting.  There are also a lot of funny situations that Percy and his friends get into.  If you like Greek mythology and a good book this is the book for you.  The book is about a kid named Percy, who is the son of Zeus and a mortal.  He goes to a summer camp for other kids like him, called halfbloods.  He is sent to recover Zeus' lightning bolts that have been stolen.  His quest takes him across the country and he finds himself in many life or death situations with ancient Greek monsters.  Will Percy be able to find the lightning bolts in time, find out in The Lightning Thief.

B00007AJGH|4.0|It's an excellent film, a classic DVD everybody should have. The only problem is that the DVD menu itself is a little confusing, so you may have a little trouble finding trailers, or specific special features listed in the box. In other words, everything written in the box is in the DVD, but it may take some time until you find it...
B0013FXWU6|2.0|Yes Daniel Day Lewis did a great portrayal of madness...I suppose this was to be relevant to today's audience's because of our dependence on oil and our involvement in Iraq.....but it really doesn't connect on that level.... The atmospheric twilight zone sound track intrudes rather than supports the drama...We do not get much to judge the motives or development the Lewis character. Nothing like a little sip of gin and a bowling ball to crush someone's skull early in the morning as a new oil well is coming in.......It's not some well trodden feel good Hollywood movie...but it over reaches in so many odd ways...
1594481717|5.0|One of the greatest sources of worthwhile reading is my former economics professor. Periodically, a book will arrive at my house with his latest recommendation. Having not failed in his ability to impress, A Whole New Mind definitely stands out above the rest. Going beyond the everyday business hype and hum drum inspirational model, Daniel Pink sends readers on a journey into a new way of thinking and learning.     Pink divides the book into two primary parts, with the first essentially an introduction and argument on how and why industry is moving away from left to right-brain thinking and into what he calls the Conceptual Age. A sound argument is positioned on three primary motives: abundance, Asia & automation. Basically, we live in a time of plenty where machines can do almost anything and any leftover knowledge work can be sourced in Asia for a dramatic cost savings.     Completing part one, I was convinced that we were in fact moving into a new age. And, I was a little unnerved about the value of my MBA as a commodity in this period. It appeared that I was going to have to adapt or fail miserably.     In part two of Whole New Mind, Pink lays out a pallet of skills to exercise and refine the right side of the brain. These skills, which he categorizes as senses, include design, story, symphony, empathy, play and meaning. A much quicker read, this section of the book incorporates basic descriptions of each \\"sense\\" and a portfolio of exercises and recommendations. The portfolios are fairly comprehensive considering the thin nature of the book, but it's presented in a way that allows you to pick and choose based on your interests and the amount of time you have. As for me, I've still got the book parked by my computer and check out a recommended link every now and then when I need a break or have a few extra minutes. As a very left-brained individual to start, I've actually enjoyed challenging myself while at the same time increasing my marketability in this futureworld.    What Thomas Friedman cited as his favorite business book is actually worth the investment in time. Pink's Whole New Mind is truly an experience that will get you thinking beyond the norm and into something progressive and dynamic that is evolving in front of us each and every day.
B000YABYLA|3.0|Well acted, well scripted, well filmed....this fairy tale...we touch upon sensitve issues, then we gloss them over with some new spray on....this must have been made for third graders...and I have no fault in that...you can't just say this is pro life hype...but in the end...its just a fairy tale....the truth is so much more cutting...I really don't get what the producer/ director was trying to accomplish....just I suppose a film that the grade schoolers could talk about....the simple music and the simple viewpoint...are fantasy land...Why this movie made the top ten lists...must only be a reaction to some of the dark films of 2007....
B0017KP93U|4.0|It's weird. If you would have asked me what one band I thought wouldn't have a greatest hits sort of record, Radiohead probably would've been on the top of the shortlist. Not because Radiohead don't have their far share of great tunes, but because if there was an album band in the ninties and early 00, it was Radiohead, where each record had it's own distinctive flow and feel.  Containing songs from their six EMI albums (nothing from \\"In Rainbows\\" is included here as it was recorded after their contract expired), \\"The Best Of\\" is surprisingly well done, with each album represented fairly well, and is a good primer for people who may not know much about Radiohead, or don't own any of their albums.  DISC ONE:  \\"The Bends\\" and \\"OK Computer\\" are best represented here probably, with five of disc one's tracks coming from \\"The Bends\\" and four coming from \\"OK Computer\\", while \\"Pablo Honey\\", \\"Kid A\\" and \\"Amnesiac\\" all account for the other eight songs.  Any song here that a caual fan would want are here, from their first hit single through their alt-rock radio staples \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\", \\"High and Dry\\" and \\"Karma Police\\". This disc also features some of their more experimental material, as \\"Everything In It's Right Place\\" (which is even odder sounding I think not leading off a record), and \\"Pyramid Song\\" represent. The selection of songs on this disc, the one that will be more widely availble as a single disc variation, is strong, and will please the casual listener.  The problems with the disc come down to sequencing, as it is weird to hear \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\" between \\"Optimistic\\" and \\"Idioteque\\". As a group with records that were individual entities, it provides for a slightly incoherant mix, which might confuse people, and doesn't help out the overall flow of the record.  Another problem with the first disc, again the one that is going to be more widely bought over time I have to believe, and I never thought that I would say this being a non-fan of these albums, is that \\"Amnesiac\\" and \\"Hail to the Thief\\" are underrepresented. By focusing so much on \\"The Bends\\" and \\"OK Computer\\", still my personal favorite Radiohead discs, it doesn't show Radiohead in it's fullest light. And I have to wonder where is \\"Sit Down, Stand Up\\", still one of the best Radiohead songs in my opinion.  But hey, you can't please everyone, so...  DISC TWO:  The bonus disc for this special edition is where you can find more album tracks, and is pretty cool in it's own right. It's pretty interesting to hear \\"Anyone Can Play Guitar\\" on the same disc as \\"I Might Be Wrong\\" and \\"The National Anthem\\". And the selection, too, is strong, with any lesser known more popular favorites (odd statement that), and the inclusion of \\"True Love Waits\\", availble on the live EP \\"I Might Be Wrong\\" is a nice choice.  The problem with this disc is it renders itself fairly worthless. Not the quality of music (in fact, the stuff from \\"Amnesiac\\", my least favorite record from the band, sounds better not on the album itself, if that makes sense), but one has to wonder who needs the second disc. It skimps on new material (no surprise as Radiohead did not endorse of support this product) or even remixes, meaning that fans who dig the band don't need it, and casual fans will shrug it off because the single disc edition already has everything they want.  The packaging and booklet for the record are strong, on par with what you see with most comps of this sort.  Overall, EMI put their work into putting together this record. It features everything that a casuel fan could ask for, and for those who decide to splurge on this edition will get a fairly strong overview of Radiohead's music thus far. It's a strong collection, well put together, flawed but for sure does what it was setting out to do. Fans probably don't need it, but newcomers will enjoy it.
0743290119|5.0|I read this on a girls' weekend with my college friends, and it couldn't have been a more perfect pick for the occasion!  It combines everything I love about Sex and the City and The Devil Wears Prada. Weisberger brilliantly portrays the friendships between Leigh, Emmy, and Adriana, and develops the pact they make to help each other change their lives with excellent skill.  I'm sending each of my friends a copy!
B000WCBPOG|4.0|If you liked the interpretations of the Beatles songs from the movie, this CD is good.  It doesn't have every single song, but has most.  I'm particularly fond of the Gospel rendition of Let it Be.
B000PKG7TI|5.0|I have only become a fan of Nightwish in the past year, a few months prior to Dark Passion Play's release.  At the time, I was mostly a fan of the new stuff with Anette, though it was with \\"With I Had An Angel\\", \\"Nemo\\" and \\"Sleeping Sun\\" with Tarja (all of which are included in this set) that made a made fan to begin with.  Still, I mostly preferred Annettes pop-rock approach to the songs over Tarja's operatic voice.  But then as I was looking for new nightwish material, I went back to listen to songs with Tarja.  I watched some live perforances on Youtube, which then lead me to this DVD.    After watching, I have new respect for the band that I already loved and new appreciation for Tarja and her approach to music.  The live perforances are phenomanal, and I reccomend it to any new or old fan of Nightwish.  As for the DVD. The sound and video quality is just about top notch.  The documentary is so-so.  The band speaks in finnish most of the time, but it's still a little interesting to see some of the stuff that goes on backstage and such.  There's no narrator, so it often seems like you're watching Big Brother or something without the whispering or having much of an idea what's going on sometimes.    That said, I wish they would have performed more songs from their older ablums, including \\"Dead Boys Poem\\", \\"Deep Silent Complete\\" and \\"Elvenpath\\", but then again this is a tour for their \\"Once\\" album, so I shouldn't complain.  The songs they did choose are among their best.  Again, if you're a fan of Nightwish, new or old, I reccomend this.
B000NQR7R0|5.0|I downloaded a few of the songs after watching Kill Bill 2. I wasn't able to download the whole CD, so was forced to buy it. I'm not disappointed at all. It's seriously one of the best CD's i've bought in years. I am now a huge Chingon and Robert Rodriguez fan!!!
0393327345|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I actually haven't seen the movie and surprisingly didn't know much about it.  As a result, I read the book with open eyes, in much the same way that people did before Brad Pitt and Edward Norton beat each other senseless on the big screen.<br /><br />I've read a couple of Palahniuk's other novels and have found them insightful and morbidly funny.  Palahniuk has a reputation as an unflinching, cringe-inducing author.  I have to admit that while parts of his other novels have been excellent, overall I've found them to be uneven.<br /><br />Not so with Fight Club.  I enjoyed it from start to finish.<br /><br />There's some great dialogue in Fight Club and some sharp observations on male culture.  Ultimately this is a satirical novel about men; specifically men who, in previous generations, would have worked the land or built things with their hands, but in today's world find themselves in mindless `grey collar' service jobs like waiters, chauffeurs, & low level office drones.  These are men who have lost their identity, having neither power, nor the satisfaction of performing meaningful labour.<br /><br />Fight Club may not be for everyone.  It's a testosterone driven novel that, while tame by Palahniuk standards, may make some readers cringe.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  Palahniuk has a unique voice.  Fight Club is sharp, lean, and remarkably entertaining.  I highly recommend this novel and look forward to seeing the movie (finally).
0452289963|5.0|I am still reading it, but I am enjoying it quite a lot. It makes me understand my behaviour and my actitude, and, eventually, improve them.  For me, it is more a book on psicology that a spiritual guide, although the label is it not important.  I admire Eckart Tolle for having written a book like this.  (But please note that eventually my opinion will change once I have finished reading it)
B000TX7B5U|5.0|\\"Nelith is a prophet, from the prophet came the king, from the king came the prophet, from the prophet came the swing, from the swing came creation, from creation came love, you don't know what this life is all about!\\"<br />-Praise the Lord and Pass the Ammunition<br /><br />As a metal fan, this album is refreshing. I listen to bands like System of a Down (Serj's former band), Iron Maiden, old school Metallica, Children of Bodom, Coheed and Cambria, The Mars Volta. THis album is amazing, and my favorite album of 2007. It's #3 on my favorite albums, and this may be the \\"Powerslave\\" of the 2000's.<br /><br />On this album, Serj takes a direction similar to his SOAD stuff, except this time, in a personal way. \\"Empty Walls\\" is about his family dying in the Lebanon riots. \\"Money\\" is very reminiscent of Chop Suey- one of those songs that's fast in the chorus and slow in the verse. You can feel the emotion in these songs off the album. \\"Saving Us\\" is a song with lots of emotion, great music and lyrics too. \\"Praise the Lord and Pass the Ammunition\\" is a wierd, but great track nonetheless. And of course, the best song, \\"Beethoven's C***\\". A duet between Serj and a backup singer, with great music and lyrics.<br /><br />Overall, this is an amazing album, and worth it if you like System of a Down. Yeah, SOAD is one thing, but Serj by himself is another. Be sure to buy this album!
0790733226|4.0|I won't rehash the plot in this review. Most other reviewers have done that and there is a review by amazon about this movie's plot. I will only add my \\"two cents\\" here.<br /><br />I thought this was a very interesting movie and that it was made believable by the great performance of Jodi Foster. If another actress had tried to pull this off, it might not have worked.<br /><br />This is not your usual \\"contact with extraterrestrials\\" movie. I think that's refreshing. In most movies with aliens, the aliens are either nice or evil but there is always the usual way the aliens meet us or us them. In this movie, Segan uses a different approach. We get some real science tossed in. Cosmos fans will undoubtedly recognize some of Sagan's lessons scattered here and there. So this is more like science probability than actual science fiction.<br /><br />This is simply a movie that speculates about the events that will occur when humans discover that Earth is not the only planet with life in the cosmos and contact with that life is finally made.
B00005JPNZ|4.0|A lot hasn't changed in 20 years.<br /><br />Indiana (Dr. Henry) Jones is still a professor in his day job, a swashbuckling, whip-toting, fist-flying finder of thingies on his side job as Archeologist Extraordinaire. Of course, this isn't really how archeology is pursued; but who cares?<br /><br />We find Indy at the start of this rendition in the trunk of a car, being made off with by the Evil Commie Russians during the Cold War of 1957 (come on, those of you of Russian descent; it's only a very, very hokey movie, operating from the mindset of the 50s). He has expertise their Fearless Leader wants to utilize(Fearless Leader: Commander Spalko - Cate Blanchett, in a throwaway role). She is after artifacts that exhibit mind control (jeez, where have we heard this plot before?). In the dry expanses of the Nevada desert, she has located the warehouse where all artifacts with intrinsic occult properties are taken to languish by the United States government, and she thinks Indy can help her decipher one of the most powerful ones.<br /><br />Plot gets in the way, however, and Indy escapes. Further along, still pursued by the bad guys, he meets up with Mutt, a young man who also is pursuing him for his own ends; Mutt's mother has been kidnapped in South America, and she has noted Indy as being her most likely savior, without explanation to her equally swashbuckling - but lacking in experience - son. He has tracked down our intrepid aging hero to aid in the freeing of said Mom.<br /><br />What follows is an almost nonending series of fights, flights, encounters, escapes, and pursuits, in true Indy fashion, over desert terrain, narrow mountain passes, and thundering, high waterfalls and rapids. There is nothing you might not expect; some pretty good special effects; and some crystal skulls that Mr Spielberg would have us believe point directly to the early intervention of beings from another world, who came here long ago for unexplained purposes, and who seem to want to impart some of their wisdom to us - but in a way that probably is not recommended for anybody.<br /><br />This was a movie primarily for those of us who have fond memories of Indy and his exploits (I must admit to being a fan of #1 and #3, but really, really grossed out at #2). It may seem a bit tired for a new generation, but darn, it's good to see Indy looking so fit at, what? 60? 65? Good to see Karen Allen too; she doesn't really seem all that much older. Cate Blanchett must have been free from filming for an uncomfortably long stretch; this movie seems out of her league. References to Rocky and Bullwinkle have been noted, and they are not too far off. I'm sure she'll rebound with a movie better suited to her talents next time.<br /><br />Also present, very briefly, was Jim Broadbent, a great British actor, and John Hurt, in another one of his quirky character roles, basically walking through his part virtually voiceless until the end. I miss that voice. His part was fairly limited but he did all right with what he had. Shia Labouef, as Mutt, was an interesting addition, and a bit at the end hints that he might pick up the torch and carry on as Indy's successor. I really can't see Indy doing another one. I'm there too, and at some point the bones put an embargo on further derring-do, but who knows? Anything is possible.<br /><br />Overall, it was a good couple of hours, and those of us who count Indy as part of our collective journey through life will want to include it in our libraries. Somewhat dated, but eminently watchable.- but in a way that probably is not recommended for anybody.

B00139XZF4|1.0|I immediately concluded that this movie does not stand alone, apart from clarity that the book probably provides. (After all, something made director and screen play writer Chris Weitz think that this production would be worthwhile.) I never read the book, now I never will.     This cinematic catastrophe is loaded with story-line gaps, an endless parade of lifeless characters, and general plotlessness. As a viewing experience, it is only mildly endurable for the special effects. What a cast! But it doesn't help. What a budget! But this movie makes Kevin Kostner's Water World look like a work of genius by comparison for all of the criticism it received in view of its titanic price-tag.       I found myself nodding off and the movie made as much sense half awake as it did with my initial full attention. What a cinematic disaster. Anybody got a golden plot compass?
B000RJO57I|5.0|Like Shaun of the Dead, this movie is  hilarious and fun and I loved it.  These two guys are the present day Abbot and Costello duo, their humor and antics are superb and very entertaining.  When you watch these guys you forget all your troubles for a little while, and isn't that what entertainment is all about?
B000SM7QUC|4.0|I bought the disc before I got the book and after listening through it, it made me want the book more. The album is good. There are some good songs and there are a few not good songs. Overall pretty good. Definately read the book.
B00008EY65|4.0|I really did not know what to expect when I sat down to watch Hellboy.  While there have been some excellent movies based on comic books, I had never even heard of Hellboy until recently, and did not have high hope.  But the trailer for Hellboy 2 was so entertaining, that I figured I needed to give Hellboy a try.<br /><br />What a surprise!  Hellboy is a light-hearted action-horror film (there's a new genre for you!).  It is filled with action and suspense, yet it is also filled with comedy and charm.  This movie does not try to take itself too seriously.  My guess is that it comes pretty close to the comic books, and does not try to be \\"more\\".<br /><br />Ron Perlman truly shines as Hellboy, bright red skin, horns, and all. The tender scenes between Hellboy and Liz (Selma Blair) (fire-starter and love interest) are sweet and funny.  Doug Evans is very engaging as Abe Sapien, Hellboy's friend and partner. John Hurt is excellent as Hellboy's \\"father.\\"  Another standout is Jeffery Tambor as Hellboy's boss. He is a real jerk throughout most of the film, and you just plain don't like him.  But near the end, the \\"Thank You\\" scene between these two actors is dead-pan perfection.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very enjoyable movie about good verses evil, where the (unlikely) superhero makes a difficult choice, and still gets the girl in the end.  As I said before, I had no idea what to expect, and wasn't even sure that I would like it.  But, there is something quite appealing and charming about this film; it almost sneaks up on you.  I highly recommend that you give it a try.
B00164KYS2|1.0|\\"And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.\\"<br /><br />I'm not sure whether the above passage is ironic considering Sarah Jessica Parker's resemblance to a horse, but there is no doubt in my mind that it is indeed prophetic and the movie version of Sex in the City is a sure sign of the approaching Apocalypse.<br /><br />Although I'm quite sure that this movie will be a hit with disillusioned women who wish it were based in reality, where they could buy a neverending supply of ugly dresses, ridiculously priced shoes, and everything else that one would buy to make themselves look like a Prada-sponsored hobo; it's just not realistic in any way.  It's pure fantasy.<br /><br />It's basically a story of four women who fool themselves in every conceivable fashion (pun intended).  When they are not embarassing themselves wearing clown outfits in public, they are attending get-togethers and parties where everyone is secretly pointing at them and calling them \\"cougars\\".  If all four looked like Heather Locklear, I could understand the invites these four nobodies get to high profile, in-crowd events, but the fact that three of the four (excluding Charlotte) have aged in dog years since turning thirty makes the barrage of respective social calendar invites about as realistic as Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.  As if it could get any more ridiculous, viewers are supposed to believe the Four Horsemen are desirable enough get a perpetual string of non-mongloid, uber-successful men, who conveniently don't have ties to former families, ex-wives, baby mommas, or children.<br /><br />There are so many more despicable aspects of this wretched piece of garbage that I can hardly write the review without getting into Moby Dick proportions.  Suffice to say that I was irritated by the perpetual product placement; I thought the writing was amatuer at best; the filming was more of a hindrance than an aide (TV to film translation on par with A Night at the Roxbury); and the obvious misandry that permeated throughout surely shouldn't have garnered any support for the whoresome foursome during their city-wide search for STDs.<br /><br />In the end, the movie paints a view of women in New York that probably belongs to the Expressionism genre.  Perhaps if they looked in the mirror and fixed the angst by engaging in a life that doesn't involve pure hedonism - while actively eliciting contempt from the audience - their lives would be a little more fulfilling.  Instead, it's the materialism of MTV's Cribs mixed with deviance of HBO's Hookers at the Point.  A longer and more painful experience than a trip to the dentist's office, SATC exudes the neurosis of not only the characters, but also the five loosely crammed together episodes being passed off as a movie.nt; I thought the writing was amatuer at best; the filming was more of a hindrance than an aide (TV to film translation on par with A Night at the Roxbury); and the obvious misandry that permeated throughout surely shouldn't have garnered any support for the whoresome foursome during their city-wide search for STDs.

B0012K1ILW|1.0|Erykah Badu is whack!  She has been going down hill every since that EP she put out (Worldwide underground)  She is truly disappointing her fans. (I was one of them)  She makes you wait years and years for her albums to come out and then she puts out a cd with ten songs on it?  That is not a complete album. Half of the songs are not even songs, they are chants \\"hold on, my people,\\" over and over again!! What are you talking about? do you even know?!  It couldn't have taken her more than two  weeks to write and record this album!  This is by far her worst! On my first listen I had buyers remorse and if I could have returned it I would have!  I was the type of Erykah Badu fan in High School with pictures of her on my wall, my friends all knew who my favorite singer was because I was singing her during class and down the hall way.  NOT ANYMORE!  She needs to get it together.  I'll definitely be hesitant to buy anything else of hers.  She always talks about smoking trees, they must be messing with her brain cells.  A mind is a terrible thing to waste, and so was my money on this album.
B00005MP58|5.0|First, to put my review in perspective, realize that I am biased towards  the novel.  It is one of the finest pieces of literature in the English  language.  I especially enjoy the development of the characters, the  masterful orchestration of the plot, and the subtle wit and humor  throughout the novel.  It's an absolute masterpiece.  There is no way  that a movie of reasonable length (a few hours) could provide the same  depth that a novel could.    That said, I still enjoy owning this version of P&P.  I also have the  Keira Knightley version of P&P and enjoy that too, although I would pick  the A&E/BBC version of the two if I were forced to.  You should realize  that the A&E version is 5 hours compared to the 2 hours of the Knightley  version.    Because of the 5 hour running time, the A&E version uses more of the  book's dialog.  To me, that, by definition, makes it more \\"realistic\\"  and faithful to the book.  You'll also need to get used to the manner  of speaking, which is a bit different from current English.    My only downcheck for the A&E DVD is the lack of subtitles, which I need  because of my poor hearing.  But it isn't enough of a problem to cause  me not to rate this offering 5 stars.    It's a classic story of boy meets girl and how they eventually fall in  love, surmounting the obstacles of their pride and prejudices.  All the  film's romantic tension is relieved near the end during the walk to  town.  One of my favorite shots of the movie is the wonder and relief on  Darcy's face when he learns that Elizabeth loves him.  I suspect all of  us can identify with the joy he feels, as learning that the person you  love returns your love has to be one of the greatest emotions we humans  can experience.    Guys:  this is not just a \\"chick flick\\".  It's quality entertainment and  you'll want to pay attention to the dialog, for there lies the subtle   humor in the movie.    I also think the casting for the characters of Mrs. Bennett and Mr. Collins  was perfect.  The most fabulous bit of acting was done by the actress  playing Mrs. Bennett.    Finally -- once you've seen one or more movie versions, read the book.  You  won't be disappointed.  [...].
B000UVLK1M|5.0|SHORT REVIEW: Very enjoyable cd, with great production & instrumentation by Herbie Hancock. great pop songs by Joni Mitchell. great performances by all performers involved.    LONG REVIEW: A seemless cd, made up of a variety of jazz musical sounds by Herbie, together with the jazzy introspective folk-pop of Joni Mitchell.    Sure its on the mellow side but Joni is the showcase and her lyrics, here performed by Joni and others, goes perfectly with the savy down tempo playing of the instrumentalists. But that is not meant to be a negative comment. The instrumental passages and moments are very good. This is jazz, a bit mellow, but not in a bad way. Its loose and improvisational jazz(heck look who is playing it!!!), with a wee bit of sly Hancock funk, lightly sprinkled throughout. Subtle yet poignant. Sweet yet salty.    ...if you have any hesitation, see if you can listen to the first 2 songs all the way through. Beautiful performances all the way around, but these songs are not meant to be 30sec clips. Sweet Bird & Tea Leaf Prophecy are also very nice. I was not disappointed with anything really. Even the non-Joni songs fit seemlessly into the overall vibe of the cd. I have even enjoyed the cd playing it loud while driiving, just to hear every musical nuianse. A real audio treat, and to quote a review I saw for another work, \\"every sound is deliberate and perfect.\\"    Reminds me of Miles Davis cool-jazz ensembles of the late 50s and up thru the 60s up, until he he formed his Bitches Brew group (which had the harder sound that was inspired by late 60s hard rock.).  its Miles influenced cool-jazz, filtered thru 70s era Joni Mitchell, with the jazz being a bit more experimental & low key in some sections.     ...to me, as jazzy and loose as this cd is, it still has a good amount of style, rhythm & melody throughout. Except Herbie & Co. play with it, much the way Joni herself did on many of her original songs & albums.     If you are only familiar with Joni's singles youmay nt be aware of the rest of the songs she had on her original albums. some tended to have alot of instrumental experimentation venturing into jazz turf.     loved this cd throughout & recommended for jazz and joni fans looking for different versions of her songs.     Thanks HH & JM.

0143038419|3.0|I would only recommend this book to women who can relate to the author's personal life. If you are happily married suburban soccer mom, don't read it. You will find it it irritating and narcissistic. Gilbert doesn't try to put down marriage, she only says that it didn't work for her anymore, which is very personal. And that is the book's tone - subjective and personal.    So if you don't view life in black and white tones and have been through a traumatic experience (I would consider divorce to be such), I would definitely recommend it to you.

0060977493|1.0|I am no fan of Arundhati Roy as political activist and commentator, so my view of her as novelist may be biased accordingly, but I have to say that this book was not worth the time I wasted reading it.        What disappointed me about this book was how far removed it was from the common Indian experience.  It invokes the common novel themes of doomed romance, caste conflicts and unfulfilled aspirations, but only in their lowest common denominators.   Ms. Roy could have written a simpler, more credible story, without having contrived to drag in Western characters that dont offer anything to the story.   What the heck is a half-English girl doing in a Kerala lagoon anyway?   Cant the story be told without these fake references to non-Indian protagonists?  If Arundhati Roy the political commentator is so worried about imperialism and racism, she might do well to not continue its prejudices.        To further  prurient interest  the author  includes references to incest and other sexual taboos. Once again, these only leave the reader with distaste, without enlightening us any further on the human story involved. She could have saved the pandering to Eastern exoticism and mystique, the narrative is not improved for all the gimmicks she tries with it.          Apparently, Arundhati Roy has stopped writing fiction to concentrate on political activism.        It is no small thing that God save us from her future efforts.
630460291X|2.0|You know what I'm talking about; \\"The Adventures of Robin Hood\\" starring Errol Flynn. Comparing that classic film with this Costner drek is like comparing \\"Road Warrior\\" with......\\"Water World\\"? The Flynn version is fun and light hearted. It has a great score and incredible colors. Costner's version is only pandering to modern sensibilities.C'mon, the movie reeks of political correctness Maid Marion fighting in black armor? Great a strong female character, Morgan Freeman as Robin's sidekick? Hey, the wise token ethnic character.(Sorry Morgan,you were good, but unnecessary)Christian Slater? Stick him in for more youth appeal. This movie adds nothing really to the Robin Hood mythos. If you must watch it, fast forward through any parts that don't feature Morgan Freeman or Alan Rickman.
630469654X|5.0|Love the movie... so much so that 20+ years later, I bought the horse! (Well, not THE horse, but a Friesian...). :) I enjoyed the story--but really, all of the horse lovers out there know it's all about the horse and the fabulous horseback fighting scene at the end. Too cool!
B000XV6VOK|4.0|Great mini-series.  If your familiar with King Henry and his reign you basically know what happens...And of course Henry wasn't one of the most respected Kings in history, it's his daughter Elizabeth that really shocked the world.  But this tells the story of King Henry and his obsession with women and multiple marriages.  I was a little sad to see Anne go, but hey--that's what happens!! She loses her head.  (Season 2) I'm not ruining anything for anyone.  That's history for you.  But, I'm also glad they didn't prolong her execution..I figured they'd drag it out into another whole season!! Go Showtime!
0307387178|4.0|I wanted to read this book before I saw the movie and I actually regret that decision. A compelling and mysterious story, it's well told by Krakauer, who is wise enough to warn you about his non-objective slant on the subject matter right in the introduction.<br /><br />The book really was 'hard to put down', except in chapters 14 and 15 where Chris McCandless is scarcely mentioned and Krakauer instead dissolves into a memoir about his own time spent trekking the Alaskan wilderness.<br /><br />To his credit, this is the author's attempt at giving the reader a comparable viewpoint into the mind of an adventure-seeking young man, but he tended to delve too far into his own experiences leaving me wondering if I was ever going to hear the rest of Chris' story.<br /><br />Overall, a good read, especially if you're a fan of travel/adventure books. To be frank, however, I think the movie might be (a) more exciting and (b) stick to the subject at hand better.<br /><br />I'll let you know once I see it :)
B0000AQS0F|5.0|What a great TV show!! A friend insisted I watch this show. I had the DVD's for three months before I finally watched them. I can't stop and I am on the third disk. I am sad that there isn't more to see. This quite literally is the most fun I have had watching a TV show in 20 years!!<br /><br />I think people are over analyzing this show on both sides. This is just a great idea and just a blast to watch! Somehow there has got to be a way to get this back on the air! This is right up the sci/fi channels alley! The characters are great and the stories are fun. I don't know about you but I watch TV to be entertained and this show does it fantastically!<br /><br />I would give this 10 stars if I could. Nuff said just buy it and enjoy!

How much we have ruined this pretty earth.

0563486430|4.0|Having been completely sucked into the new Doctor Who (both 9th and 10th Doctors) I now find myself devouring everything I can get my hands on.  The novel tie-ins all seem to be written for an all-ages audience; not terribly sophisticated writing, but entertaining.    I thought this one was a decent example; a fine start with a good handle on the characters and nice dialogue.  The middle section of the book requires much suspension of disbelief as the Doctor gets himself thrown to the lions in the colliseum and enacts a spectacular escape, but the final third of the book is where the story really takes off.  With the Doctor in peril Rose rises to the occasion and deals with some genuinely thought-provoking issues - I'm trying to not spell out the plot points, but she faces some interesting conundrums and I enjoyed the way in which things played out.

B0016B6ZKG|5.0|For those of us who were alive and partying when Donna Summer was the queen of disco, this album marks a welcome return after an absence of nearly twenty years. (Actually seventeen, but who's counting?)<br /><br />Looking fit and fresh for her guest appearance on American Idol, where she sang the first single from this album \\"Stamp Your Feet\\", she proved that not even time can stop a Summer in full flow.<br /><br />\\"Last Dance\\", one of my favorite songs from the past, was featured in the Ashton Kutcher/Cameron Diaz movie \\"What Happens in Vegas\\", as further proof that some performers are destined never to fade away into the woodwork.<br /><br />Anyway, back to this album, my favorite song is the title track, featuring Ziggy Marley, providing a bouncy reggae vibe that's guaranteed to have you shaking a leg, even when you're sitting down.<br /><br />All twelve tracks were co-written by the Queen, and regardless of tempo, they're all winners.  If I had to pick my top five, I'd choose the two I've mentioned before, plus \\"Sand on My Feet\\", which reminds me of \\"Breakfast at Tiffanys\\" by Deep Blue Something; the jazzy Latin \\"Driving Down Brazil\\" and the disco track \\"I'm a Fire\\".<br /><br />As she herself states proudly on track four, the Queen is back!<br /><br />Amanda Richards, June 2, 2008
B00005BL2A|5.0|Maybe it was because I expected a more danceable, synthpoppy album. I said, what the hell is this and I didn't care to listen to it any more as I had also the CD singles of Dream On, I Feel Loved and the magnificent Freelove.  It was not long ago that I took the time to listen again to this album and really have to say now that this is one of DM's best albums. I just can't stop hearing songs like Breathe or Goodnight Lovers. This is DM's at a very special phase that we may not hear again. Those two songs (Breathe or Goodnight Lovers) actually doesnt't sound very DM as one could say but has such emotion, such soul that now I feel like I have found a treasure and plan to enjoy it forever. Martin Gore is such a genius.
B0017KP93U|4.0|Music: 5 stars.... Compilation: 3 stars<br /><br />When Radiohead decided with the \\"In Rainbows\\" album not to re-up with EMI, it was only a matter of time before the label would squeeze a few more drops out of the money machine that Radiohead was for EMI. The label simply had to find a good time and excuse to do so, and that time has come now (new tour!). The band has made clear that it has nothing to do with this \\"best of\\", all the while also acknowledging that EMI has the legal right to do this. Now the question is: is this compilation any good?<br /><br />\\"The Best of Radiohead: Special Edition\\" (2 CDs, 30 tracks, 135 min.) is a very generous overview of Radiohead's best songs from the 7 albums it recorded for EMI. CD1 (17 tracks; 76 min.) brings the \\"greatest hits\\", and hence not surprisingly focuses on tracks from three albums: a whopping 6 tracks from 1995's commercial breakthrough album \\"The Bends\\", including the singles Just, My Iron Lung, High and Dry, Fake Plastic Trees, and Street Spirit (Fade Out)  and also the fabulous title track. 1997's \\"OK Computer\\" album, viewed by many as one of the most important albums of the 90s, gets 4 tracks, including the singles Paranoid Android, Karma Police, No surprises, and also Lucky. 2000's so-called experimental \\"Kid A\\" album gets 3 tracks: Optimistic, Idioteque, and Everything In Its Right Place. With that, 75% of this \\"best of\\" compilation is filled. The remaining 3 studio albums get a mere 4 tracks: the monster hit Creep from 1993's \\"Pablo Honey\\"; Pyramid Song from 2001's \\"Amnesiac; and finally There There and 2+2=5 from 2004's \\"Hail to the Thief\\".<br /><br />CD2 (13 tracks, 59 min.) brings deeper tracks from the various albums, and is just slightly more of a headscratcher to me than CD1. There are 2 singles that didn't make CD1 (Knives Out from \\"Amnesiac\\" and Go to Sleep from \\"Hail to the Thief\\"), and after that it's a bit all over the place: You and Anyone Can Play Guitar From \\"Pablo Honey\\"; Planet Telex from \\"The Bends\\" plus Talk Show Host, a B side of that era; Airbag, Let Down and Exit Music (For a Film) from \\"OK Computer\\"; The National Anthem and How To Disappear Completely from \\"Kid A\\"; I Might Be Wrong and Knives Out from \\"Amnesiac\\"; and even the live mini-album \\"I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings\\" is represented with \\"True Love Waits\\".<br /><br />In all, while it is always possible to split hairs and argue over the selection of the tracks, it is difficult to be upset with the final result. EMI actually did a pretty good job of it! I will say that I am not crazy with the sequencing of the album. I would have preferred a chronological sequencing, for one.  Notice that on CD1 the 3 tracks from \\"Kid A\\" are  scattered and buried in the second half for some reason. For anyone not all that familiar with Radiohead, if you are wondering whether to buy this, or to buy the single CD, I would urge to buy the single CD compilation. If you like what you hear there, the next step is to explore the individual studio albums of Radiohead. I have no idea to whom the 2CD Special Edition is marketed to, to be honest. The causal Radiohead fan doesn't need that much and the rabbit Radiohead fan already has all of this. But the music is fantastic, let there be not doubt about it.w Host, a B side of that era; Airbag, Let Down and Exit Music (For a Film) from \\"OK Computer\\"; The National Anthem and How To Disappear Completely from \\"Kid A\\"; I Might Be Wrong and Knives Out from \\"Amnesiac\\"; and even the live mini-album \\"I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings\\" is represented with \\"True Love Waits\\".

B00005RYKU|3.0|I must confess, I can't think of too much to say on the topic of The Glass House.  It's certainly not a horrible movie; it's a decent film though.  The story line was actually fairly decent regardless of how implausible, but I don't usually go to the movies to see reality, I exist in reality and I know what it's like.  If I want reality I watch documentaries.  Anyway, I have tried to curb my overwhelming bias for Leelee Sobieski in my rating.  She's one of the three actresses I simply adore looking at and watching in general.  So it really didn't matter if the rest the cast wasn't very good, I probably would've enjoyed watching it anyway... yes, I did try to curb this bias in my rating and look at the movie as a whole.<br /><br />The basic premise of the film is based around two kids, Ruby Baker (Leelee) and her brother, which inherited a lot of money from their dead parents.  Their guardian, Terry Glass (Skarsgaard), (unbeknownst to others) borrowed a lot of money from loan sharks, so now he wants the kids' money to pay it off.  He tries to weasel his way through the movie to get the cash any way he can.  The movie is classified as a suspense/thriller, so I'm assuming people can guess where that all goes towards the end.  It's actually a lot better than the quick overview sounds and a lot of this has to do with the interaction between Sobieski and Skarsgaard, who, in my opinion, gave the best performances in the film.  Luckily most of film is centered on them, and thus, the general lack of the other characters is made up for.<br /><br />Her brother was incredibly annoying throughout the film, but he was supposed to play the role of the annoying little brother, so I suppose he succeeded.  For some reason I just plain wasn't into his acting, it felt kind of forced a lot of the times (then again, he is young and not a major character).  Terry's wife, played by Diane Lane, simply listlessly goes through this film, which, again, I think her character was supposed to do.  She wasn't a major presence in the film so her presence didn't get annoying, but at least her acting performance was more convincing.  I will say that I did enjoy the end of the movie.  It was only semi-expected on my behalf.  I kind of figured out what would happen by the end, but the way they executed it was actually pretty interesting, so it definitely didn't disappoint on that level.<br /><br />I don't think anyone would consider this one of the best movies ever, but I think most people will find some general merit in it.  It's a pretty decent story that keeps you interested throughout the whole movie with a good amount of intrigue to keep you guessing at some things during the film.  And if none of that really gets you there's a solid five minute scene of Leelee swimming in a pool in a pretty small bikini.  That alone has to be worth at least one or two stars in my book.  Coupled with the fact that there is a scene with her in just her bra right before this!  A good time in itself, I say.  Sorry... the bias came through there, I couldn't help it.  Anyway, not a top priority movie, but definitely worth watching if it's on, or picking it up used for under five bucks.  It does have some re-watch value, but not a ton, I think the few times I've watched this it has been years apart... definitely worth seeing once at the very least though.ajor presence in the film so her presence didn't get annoying, but at least her acting performance was more convincing.

0307346617|5.0|I am a geog teacher and have recommended this book to other geographers (as well as most of my friends and family).  There are many reasons to read this book - including the author's admirable creativity and consistency: many points are developed to their logical conclusion, in surprising and satisfying ways (which is also why I loved the ZSG, too).<br /><br />But for those of you who have ever taken a college-level geography class, you might recognize a few overarching geographic themes:<br />- Some more obvious, but well thought-through points about how the physical environment shapes human action (new importance of mountains, polar regions, etc.);<br />- Immigration as bodies moving across porous borders through complicated, organized networks (i.e., border security cannot just be a \\"wall\\" between two countries);<br />- How exceptionally interconnected the world is, and how our current standard of living depends upon global flows of material and finance: what happens when that collapses?  (Note where the U.S. economy rebuilds itself);<br />- Yet another downside to urban sprawl: cities that are harder to surround, conquer and clean out because of the fragmented, low-density development patterns;<br />- Many, many vignettes about the changing nature of war - from the difference in fighting a new enemy that sees no borders / no boundaries, to refuge in the sea, etc.<br /><br />And finally, I appreciate how the author has thought about the current geopolitical situation, and then in a compelling way illustrated how a new virus outbreak would play out - the world is NOT flat, as Thomas Friedman has argued, but geography matters!!!  Many of these lessons here would ring true for multiple types of global disasters - including pandemic, rapid climate change, etc.  Scary to think about.<br /><br />And don't get me wrong - this is not an academic book; its primary value is for entertainment, and it does deliver in this regard.  It also made me think, and thus I highly recommend it.

1423101464|5.0|My three kids were slobbering over the Amazon package when it arrived and couldn't wait to tell dad that THE book had finally arrived.  We've been in count-down mode since we finished book 3.  Each night as we read, my husband would come to the end of a chapter and everyone would BEG for him to read just another chapter.  I have three daughters (7,9 and 11), but this series would please boys equally well.  I have thouroughly enjoyed the stories myself.  What a wonderful vehicle for kids to access the ancient Greek myths.  This story addresses Daedalus and the Labyrinth.  HIGHLY recommend.

0618680004|3.0|Let it be said: Richard Dawkins is a very good writer, and the kind of person with whom one can readily imagine an enjoyable and simulating evening over a glass or two of red--enjoyable that is, so long as he refrained from his predictable outbursts of rambunctious polemic. And this highlights the two sides of Richard Dawkins: at once engaging, personable, rational, pleasant, entertaining; and alternatively unreasonable, angry, boisterous, given to ill-conceived diatribes. If he is preaching to his own choir, these diatribes will likely elicit hearty \\"amens!\\" If believers are his target audience, his arguments would go farther if he would restrain his clamorous tone.<br /><br />Many believers will find, as I do, that Dawkins' arguments are often wide of the mark with respect to our brand of theism and Christian Faith. Some of his arguments are undisguised straw man. Many others are waged against a fundamentalism into which many Christians do not fit. In fact many believers will find themselves nodding in agreement. For example, when Dawkins declares \\"As a scientist, I am hostile to fundamentalist religion because it actively debauches the scientific enterprise. It teaches us not to change our minds, and not to want to know exciting things that are available to be known. It subverts science and saps the intellect,\\" I heartily agree! However in Chapter 8 (Dawkins' defense of his own hostility toward people of faith) he devotes the final section to answering why he deplores even the more moderate, rational wing of Christian faith. Here he develops his \\"moderates validate fundamentalists\\" argument. \\"The teachings of `moderate' religion,\\" Dawkins contends, \\"though not extremist in themselves, are an open invitation to extremism.\\" What?? And how does this not apply equally to \\"moderate\\" atheism? While Dawkins dismisses the notion that Stalin and Hitler operated out of their atheistic world-view (his arguments are less than convincing), why are extreme acts of atheists not validated by more moderate atheists? I have often thought that Hemingway followed atheism to it's logical extension: existential despair and suicide. While most atheists I've met do not take their atheism to that extreme, could it not be argued that moderate atheism paves the way to such actions. (I'm not forwarding this argument here. Theists also commit suicide. And Hitler's atheism is arguable. I'm only suggesting that Dawkins' argument against moderate expressions of faith is unfair, and can be turned back upon his own brand of moderate atheism.) It is apparently Dawkins view that, without the more moderate voices of religion, the more extreme versions would fade away. He never explains the logic behind this supposed linkage. It could be argued that all forms of moderation legitimize and validate related extremists. Moderate social drinkers validate alcoholics. Moderate environmentalists validate eco-terrorists. Moderate progressives validate socialism. But so what? Assuming the truth of the argument, does this mean we should abandon moderation?<br /><br />Dawkins' \\"central\\" atheistic argument is found in chapter 4. After dismantling (to his satisfaction) many of the standard theistic arguments in chapter 3, Dawkins attempts to demonstrate \\"Why There Is Almost Certainly No God\\". This argument from probability betrays his simplistic concept of the Christian view of God. For those unfamiliar with Dawkins' core atheistic contention, Dawkins' argument runs something like this: Believers, appealing to the extreme improbability of this universe developing as it has, the fact that it is hospitable to life at all, indeed the extreme improbability of life itself, contend that our universe demands the existence of an intelligent Cause. But, Dawkins counters that postulating a God only extends the problem of improbability, and pushes it back in time. That is, any God appealed to to account for the complexity of our universe must himself be yet more complex. And his existence thus becomes more difficult to explain than the material universe we observe. Thus, in Dawkins' view, the notion of God is \\"very close to being ruled out by the laws of probability.\\" Dawkins is either unaware of, or fails to understand the Judeo-Christians concept of God as the eternal \\"self-existent\\" One. No believer I know has struggled with the question, \\"Whence God?\\" Nor will Dawkins' expostulations raise such a question for believers. The God of believers is far beyond Dawkins' notion of demanding explanation. It is indeed reasonable that we seek logical explanations for causation in our material world. To suggest the same logic must apply to God does not follow. Christians understand that God exists outside of our physical dimensions. As such, he cannot be restrained to our time bound concepts of causation. Dawkins' shallow reasoning reminds me of a favorite passage from David Bentley Hart: \\"... since strict materialism is among the most incoherent of superstitions ... it is incapable of imagining any conception of God more sophisticated than its own.\\" (The Doors of the Sea, page 14.)<br />In fairness, Hart goes on to depict unbelief in more generous terms, but Dawkins leaves one wondering if his concept of God is as small as it seems.<br /><br />There is an interesting confluence in Richard Dawkins, and one that should be telling for believers. He is considered by many to be both the world's foremost evolutionary biologist, and the world's foremost atheist. Is this indicative that evolution and atheism are intrinsically linked, as many of my believing and unbelieving friends insist? Or is it rather indicative of how believers have 1) failed to embrace evolutionary science (which has now moved beyond reasonable doubt), and 2) failed therefore to develop a reasonable theology around evolution. Because I am convinced of the later, I am engaged in discovering the promising theological implications of evolution. As other Christian thinkers join in this process, I believe one effect will be to remove the stinger from Dawkins' atheist arguments. For example, Dawkins devotes much of The God Delusion to evolutionary explanations for the development of religious impulses, morality, altruism, etc. Apparently, he views these explanations as the death knell of theism. As a theist who has thought long on the concept of \\"Evolutionary Creationism\\", I found little in these explanations to disagree with. Furthermore, I did not see how his arguments inherently favored atheism over theism. Certainly they undo many worn-out theistic arguments. And they effectively rebut many traditional Christian assumptions. But those arguments and assumptions were incorrect, and should be scuttled. If the Creator has (as I believe) used evolution to bring humankind into a state of God-consciousness (which by Dawkins' admission is ubiquitous in all cultures, and favored by the great majority of people), why should it surprise us that evolution would be his tool of choice?<br /><br />Reading The God Delusion was, frankly, less challenging to my faith than I anticipated. His best arguments are leveled against religious fundamentalism; here I share many of his views. But when he turns his guns upon my faith, his extreme hostility tends to invalidate his arguments. When a person becomes consumed with antipathy, reasoned argument can give way to irrational tirades. Dawkins' atheistic zeal seems to have negated any trace of respect he might have shown toward those with a different persuasion. And when we cease to respect our adversary, a consequence is that our arguments are inevitably weakened.more difficult to explain than the material universe we observe. Thus, in Dawkins' view, the notion of God is \\"very close to being ruled out by the laws of probability.\\" Dawkins is either unaware of, or fails to understand the Judeo-Christians concept of God as the eternal \\"self-existent\\" One. No believer I know has struggled with the question, \\"Whence God?\\" Nor will Dawkins' expostulations raise such a question for believers. The God of believers is far beyond Dawkins' notion of demanding explanation. It is indeed reasonable that we seek logical explanations for causation in our material world. To suggest the same logic must apply to God does not follow. Christians understand that God exists outside of our physical dimensions. As such, he cannot be restrained to our time bound concepts of causation. Dawkins' shallow reasoning reminds me of a favorite passage from David Bentley Hart: \\"... since strict materialism is among the most incoherent of superstitions ... it is incapable of imagining any conception of God more sophisticated than its own.\\" (The Doors of the Sea, page 14.)  In fairness, Hart goes on to depict unbelief in more generous terms, but Dawkins leaves one wondering if his concept of God is as small as it seems.    There is an interesting confluence in Richard Dawkins, and one that should be telling for believers. He is considered by many to be both the world's foremost evolutionary biologist, and the world's foremost atheist. Is this indicative that evolution and atheism are intrinsically linked, as many of my believing and unbelieving friends insist? Or is it rather indicative of how believers have 1) failed to embrace evolutionary science (which has now moved beyond reasonable doubt), and 2) failed therefore to develop a reasonable theology around evolution. Because I am convinced of the later, I am engaged in discovering the promising theological implications of evolution.

B00187MXA4|5.0|An idealistic genius of a man produced this album. His voice is like an air raid siren. His passion is unmatched. He is the product of that which makes Western civilization so sublime and gut wrenching in perfect screeching harmony.<br /><br />If only the world was as fair as Serj would like it to be! In the mean time, his songs will keep me company while I fight wars I cannot even be sure are just. His riffs will accompany me on dark roads as bullets whiz by my head and explosions sound in the distance.<br /><br />One day when the dust has settled I hope that Serj and I will be able to share a cool beverage on a hot day and talk about how things are better than they used to be because he had a conscience and I had a gun.<br /><br />If only. Meanwhile the clock ticks and his voice hypnotizes me and I think a little harder than I would otherwise have thought.

B0016HNOXQ|4.0|I was expecting the spacey, trippy music of Dummy. Not to be had, but this was still very good.  Beth Gibbons's voice is as beautiful as ever, but this time instead of being backed by ethereal sounds and beats, it's very beat heavy and throbbing.  Very different, this is not really trip hop.  It's more like hip hop/torch singing, uh.. torch hop?
0061245097|4.0|This second addition to the Night Huntress Series has proven even stronger and more intriguing than its predecessor and will leave fans of the first book well satisfied.<br /><br />The storyline for OFITG actually begins a few years after the events of the previous novel [[ASIN:0061245089 Halfway to the Grave (Night Huntress, Book 1)]]. Our half vamp heroine, Catherine Crawfield, has been working for the government culling troublesome vamps. When an assassination goes wrong and she finds a price on her head she is forced back into association with her former mentor and lover, the very delightful vampire Bones.<br /><br />The romantic element in this book is, quite frankly, red hot. Frost doesn't tease the reader with a waffling heroine who suffers with a \\"should she, shouldn't she\\" dilemma for half a dozen novels. The feelings between Bones and Cat are very much mutual and it offers a refreshing change from other books in this genre that depend on unresolved sexual tension to fuel plot. In OFITG, the action element is strong enough on its own that that isn't necessary and all the tension we need comes from our villains as well as interactions with an ever increasing number of complex secondary characters.<br /><br />This isn't to say the book is perfect. Cat's character at times comes across as a bit juvenile for someone in her mid to late 20s who has been slaying vampires for the past several years and slang terms such as \\"hurl\\" and \\"duh\\" don't help with this image. Also the first half of the novel feels a bit rushed and it's easy to feel disoriented within the timeline. This along with a lack of detail on occasion (Cat acquires a kitten early in the novel that conspicuously lacks a name) leave the reader feeling like Frost's editor had her limited to x number of pages and she had to cut out some of the depth.<br /><br />Overall this was a great read that very skillfully blended romance and urban fantasy. Frost continues her trend of writing books that have very satisfying endings while keeping you interested in future books.you interested in future books.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|It's odd for me to say this - I loved this CD right from the start, but I didn't listen to it again for a week. After a week, I popped it back in and thats when I was just blown away. For some reason, I had to let this album grow on me more than just the listening enjoyment. Their latest creation, \\"In Rainbows\\", presents an album that delivers a sense of maturity within each musician, and they all respectively come together again to bring the goods. I don't think I could ever describe any previous Radiohead albums with the word \\"maturity\\", because they always seemed to have a clear grasp on what they write that they just sound mature. \\"In Rainbows\\" just has this feel that this band has matured within their own right playing together for all these years. The album grows on you not just by listening, but also by feeling the growth within this band. This album speaks to me in an ambiance only Radiohead can do, and this time it's very refreshing.
B000MXPE74|5.0|I had never heard this CD before purchasing it, it was reccomended to me by Amazon because I had recently picked up a couple of Libertine CDs. I have to say that this is a GREAT CD and I am glad Amazon reccomended it to me. It is a lot of fun, they have their style but they are sure to keep it interesting throughout the whole CD. I will be picking up their other CDs soon!
B000XTLUW0|5.0|I have to confess the first song that I heard that made me interested was on guitar hero. But, after that I heard map of the problematique and decided that \\"I had to buy this.\\" At first I was thinking a live album would be filled with anoying repetitive shrieks from the audience. But, it isn't like that at all. The audio is crystal clear, the dvd is amazing, and the songs put me in a trance. Muse is clearly one of the best bands out there, i'm so happy that I found this cd, and this band.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|I had read them say prior to this albums release that this was going to be a completely different sounding album, two thoughts came to mind \\"uh-oh\\" and \\"Yeah right, every band says that.\\" But it is a different sound, and it is a great album, bands need to evolve otherwise they just release the same CD over and over with different lyrics.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like about this album is that they don't have that rap-rock sound to them anymore, its a much more emotional sound which is fine. But Fort Minor takes care of the rap shtuff for ya (even if he talks about how they wanted to take rap out of LP on there)<br /><br />Sum it up... buy it

B000005RS0|5.0|I can't believe I have never reviewed this album before now. When this came out I was just starting to discover the club scene. As a kid in the 70's in small town America we all knew who Tina was, as she was considered kind of a has been. All of a sudden this album came out, and I would turn my radio on a 6 in the morning to get ready for work and the first single was Let's Stay Together. Well, I looked forward to hearing this song every morning. And then I would hit the clubs at night and they started playing What's Love Got to Do With It. I was mesmerized by Tina from then on. I actually bought the LP and wore it out. Then the cassette and remember blaring this album in my 76 Regal while cruising. Finally bought the cd, and it will always be one of my favorite albums of all time. I Might Have Been Queen should also have been a single. Tina will go down as my favorite singer of the era, and it's due to her soulful singing on this album!

B00127RAJY|5.0|I had been working out for a while when I got this, and I thought it would be no big deal. As so many others have found, I WAS SO WRONG! This workout attempted to kill me numerous times. The workouts are excellent: fast, painful (in a good way), and well-rounded. I think Jillian does a great job explaining form, and she seems to know exactly when I want to give up because she always says something right at that time. Also, Jillian is NEVER fake or annoying (to me at least). I can't even watch some other DVD's because the instructors are so...gross, cloying, fake-encouraging. I feel like Jillian is someone I could actually hang with (if she would stop trying to KILL me :)). I've been through all the levels now (I've been doing the workouts for a few months). I can honestly say that my body has transformed as a result. I am so much stronger--toned and I can take a lot more cardio. I love this DVD!

B00004R7X5|4.0|Despite being of analog quality, the listening satisfaction of this recording cannot be beat.  I gave it 4 stars due to the familiar hiss of the era's analog technology.  However, I was so enthused after listening to this recording of Scheherazade that I continued to successively buy three more DDD & SACDs convinced there had to be a comparable recording with all the added audio spatial resolution.  The increased fidelity simply showcased orchestral flaws that detracted from listening ease of that first Karajan recording.  DG must re-masters this and Resphigi's Pines of Rome that will inevitably be worthy of a 5 star rating.  You will not find a better performance.  I highly recommend this recording even if you already have a different rendition.  Karajan is simply the standard here.
061891868X|4.0|If only more scientists wrote for popular audiences with the humility Lee Smolin does. Whilst it occasionally gets bogged down in the detail of its own material - there are more minutiae on particle physics here than most people will care for in a bedtime read - Lee Smolin's major points are clearly made and they ring like a bell.<br /><br />In some ways this is a work of popular philosophy of science, not popular science itself: Smolin approaches his subject through the prism of the failings of string theory to coagulate over the last thirty years, but only in the loosest sense is this an attempt to prove string theory wrong and his own favoured research programme, quantum loop gravity, right. For one thing, he accepts from the outset that there are significant issues with his own programme.<br /><br />Smolin's concern is more around the practice of modern physics; how the gradual disappearance of anything resembling testable empirical evidence has given way to ever more theoretical modelling which in turn has led to hypotheses of increasingly incredible (literally, that is) implications. For any variety of string theory to work (it is more of a cluster of similar possible theories, rather than a discrete theory as such) the mathematics require something like *eleven* spatial dimensions, some of which, it is variously hypothesised, must be so small as to be conceptually unobservable (the image we are invited to consider is dimensions which curl up into little donuts smaller than an atomic particle across), or which appear to require an infinity of alternative universes - a \\"multiverse\\" if you will - into which these dimensions can be projected. (I may well have not understood or expressed this perfectly: the important point is that the theory must account for the absence of any physical evidence for the extra dimensions: solution - they're invisible, of course!)<br /><br />Smolin's concern is not just that these are outlandish and faintly ridiculous consequences - though they surely seem to be - but precisely that they are systematically untestable. *By definition* there is no means to measure spatial dimensions smaller than the smallest subatomic particles. *by definition* we cannot see or measure physical effects occurring outside our own universe. These are not just difficult to say with a straight face, Smolin argues, but by any commonly understood sense of the term they're altogether unscientific: logically closed, untestable, unfalsifiable, unreliant on any kind of inductively gathered argument.<br /><br />Precisely the sort of arguments, in other words, that give religious cosmologies a bad name: utterly verboten, you would think in the enlightened mead-hall of the physical sciences. (Yet, and without apparent irony, biologist Richard Dawkins makes favourable reference to the \\"multiverse\\" theory in his recent book The God Delusion!)<br /><br />Smolin argues that this uneasy development collides head-on with some uncomfortable realities about the sociological aspects of the practice of science. Again, Smolin is persuasive here (though in my case preaching to the choir) in citing favourably the late, anarchic, philosopher of science Paul Feyerabend, whose general message is that for scientific methodology anything goes, and all theories have a role to play for the good of the \\"development of knowledge\\", and that determined insistence on an existing accepted theory for framing ongoing research hardens quickly and dangerously into dogma: you need the vistas that different theories offer, says Feyerabend, or they are \\"as useless as a medicine that heals a patient only if he is bacteria-free\\".<br /><br />For his trouble, Smolin is duly criticised for exhibiting \\"postmodernist\\" or \\"relativist\\" tendencies, and while I don't think this *is* a criticism myself, it is in any case unfairly awarded, since Smolin avowedly retains a belief in the possibility of objective truth, and promises to (but in the end doesn't really) take issue with the work of the most celebrated \\"postmodernist\\" philosopher of science, Thomas Kuhn. (I'm a fan of Kuhn's so I was looking forward to the challenge, and was a bit disappointed to find it didn't materialise).<br /><br />Practically, Smolin feels that String Theory is now a \\"paradigm in crisis\\". Certainly, the theoretical tail seems to be wagging the practical dog. It is difficult to see what practical utility a theory has which postulates invisible dimensions and which doesn't seem to point with any clarity to a possible solution at all, let alone one with the elegance of a f = ma or e = mc2.<br /><br />I suspect this book will annoy the hard-core science-is-truth crowd, but anyone with a more open mind will find a valuable perspective here.<br /><br />Olly Buxtonmodernist\\" philosopher of science, Thomas Kuhn.

Especially nice is the chocolate Buttercream and the seven-minute icing. The blueberry pie is quite good (we made six of them at Thanksgiving).

0679731369|4.0|I had a hard time getting into this book. I have not read anything by Flaubert before and thought it might prove to be a hindrance, but found that it was not.<br />Julian Barnes sets the stage very well, even while flitting around with the narration and once engaged, I enjoyed the novel and the quirky style more than anticipated. The novel stands on it's own quite well.<br />The book centers around a retired physician haunted by scholarly questions and minutiae from the novels and real life of the author, Gustave Flaubert (1821-1880), especially in trying to determine which of two different parrots he visits once graced the author's desk?<br /><br />The scholarly obsession with Flaubert by the good Dr. Braithwaite doesn't make much sense until the last few chapters when betrayals of love and literature slowly surface.<br /><br />A favorite quote .... \\"Language is like a cracked kettle on which we beat out tunes for bears to dance to, while all the time we long to move the stars to pity.\\"<br /><br />That poetry wraps around this novel so nicely.<br />It's all about words! .....And words deceive much as people deceive.<br />Why does Flaubert keep changing the color of M.

B0017KP93U|5.0|On Amazon U.K., a number of Radiohead fans are already complaining that this compilation is unwarranted, unnecessary and unjust, and I'm sure they'll be doing the same here soon.  Many of these fans argue that Radiohead should not be anthologized because their albums should be heard as albums, not as parts of a collection.  While I can respect that opinion to a point, Radiohead has released singles for every album, and I see no reason why those singles can't be anthologized for neophytes.  Almost every band in history has been anthologized at some point.  Why is Radiohead different?  What makes them above a \\"greatest hits\\" collection?  Even Pink Floyd has had the compilation treatment, and they are the epitome of the difficult to anthologize, album-oriented band.      Sure, I'll agree that new fans should check out the individual Radiohead albums (especially \\"The Bends,\\" \\"OK Computer\\" & \\"Kid A\\"), but what's wrong with starting with this collection first?  When I was younger, I was turned on to R.E.M. through the compilation \\"Eponymous;\\" I got into the Psychedelic Furs with \\"All of This and Nothing;\\" and I discovered Echo & the Bunnymen on \\"Songs to Learn and Sing.\\"  All of these bands were album-oriented artists, and hearing those collections made me go out and purchase the original albums by those bands.  So, if you're already a die-hard Radiohead fan, obviously this compilation is not for you, but if you're new to the band, this is not a bad place to start.      Also, any fan could criticize certain omissions (for me, \\"Stop Whispering,\\" \\"Morning Bell,\\" and \\"You and Whose Army\\" were the most strangely M.I.A.), and certain albums get more exposure than others (seven songs from \\"The Bends\\" seems a bit excessive), but overall this compilation has a strong track selection.  The track listing is a bit haphazard at times (a straightforward chronological order might have been preferable), but again, that's a minor complaint.      As for the also-prevalent fan criticism that this is a cash-grab from the record company, what compilation isn't?  Record companies are in the business of making money (in exchange for promoting artists and bringing them to a wider audience), and I for one see nothing wrong with that, especially considering how many people download albums for free from P2P sites these days (wrong in my opinion), leaving record companies little choice but to try and make money wherever possible.    Finally, I like that this compilation is being issued as both a single-disc and a double-disc collection, depending on how interested you are in the band.  If you've never heard anything besides \\"Creep\\" on modern rock radio, stick with the single-disc version.  If, however, you've heard over half of the singles on the first disc, and you like them, you should probably consider getting the double-disc version.  Overall, if you want a well-put-together collection by one of the most influential bands of the last fifteen years, ignore the naysayers and pick up this set.  It's a great place to begin.
B0012QE4Q2|2.0|This movie wasn't horrible, but I have seen other movies that depict this story much better, \\"Anne of The Thousand Days\\" for example.  But this movie focused on Anne Boleyn, King Henry VIII and his relationship with both her and her sister, Mary.  The acting wasn't that great, and if you want to see a truly OUTSTANDING Anne Boleyn performance, check out Natalie Dormer in Showtime's The Tudors!!!  They should have picked HER for the role in this movie!!  I went to see it because I love anything to do with the Tudor period, especially Henry VIII. But it is certainly not the best I've ever seen.
B0014KD46W|4.0|As other reviewers before me had said this record needs to be listened to a few times to really appreciate it. Yesterday I had a long listening session that included \\"Kind of Blue\\", Clapton's \\"Journeyman\\", Duke Ellingtons greatest hits, and \\"Nine Lives\\". This CD held it's own with this group. Some really good songs with interesting arrangements and some very nice guitar work by Jose Neto. He's a good riffer, I wish he would have soloed a bit more. But, that's just the old jazz guitarist talking. Even my Maine Coon cat liked it! And he's critical.....
B0012IWNTA|5.0|I really didn't like their comeback album, Beautiful World ( posted a critical review on Amazon some time ago and got bashed for it ).    The concert DVD, on the other hand, is excellent!    I don't have the disc with me while I write this, so I'll give a general impression based on what I can recall offhand.    The production is great - from the sets to the costumes to the visual effects. The choreography is fabulous, and their musical director deserves major kudos as well.    From the opening sequence leading to the first song, Reach Out, you can immediately tell that this show is going to be a huge spectacle. The guys stand at podiums below giant flags emblazoned with the Take That logo, reminiscent of a political rally ( though I'll stop short of comparing it to something Holocaust-related - don't think they'd appreciate that! ).    The next 2 hours feature recent compositions such as Beautiful World, Patience, I'd Wait For Life and Shine, interspersed with Take That classics like Relight My Fire, Sure, Pray, Everything Changes and Could It Be Magic.    While the Beautiful World studio recording came across as bland and vocally weak, I heard nothing of the sort on this DVD. Although Gary is clearly the lead singer, Mark and Howard did admirable jobs on their own solos ( e.g. Shine and Beautiful World, respectively ), and even Jason jumped in with a very competent performance of Wooden Boat ( strumming guitar with a nice string ensemble for backup ).    Other standout moments: Could It Be Magic - done slow and dramatic, with impressive stage props; Everything Changes - updated to an adult-contemporary / acoustic version, very nice indeed; Never Forget - featuring an imaginative screen as the backdrop, incorporating animation with live-action sequences; Back For Good - always a crowd-pleaser, made all the more poignant by the massive audience's enthusiastic karaoke-ing; and Shine - my personal fave from the Beautiful World album, with Mark acting as circus master.If you crave some boy-band memories, check out It Only Takes A Minute (albeit redone with some serious exotic dancing thrown in ), and Pray - the only song that retains the original choreography from the '90s.    Yes, I used to watch TT's concerts on VHS, and caught them 'live' in Singapore just before they broke up. 10 years on, they've matured gracefully and sound even better than before. I still don't understand why their studio release pales in comparison, but IMHO, no artiste deserves a listener's respect if s/he sucks on-stage, so TT has no such deficiency to contend with.    This DVD had me beaming for 2 whole hours. Definitely good value for money. :)    Highly recommended for all TT fans, but a good gift for initiating newbies as well.

B000IOM1Z0|4.0|The Turn of a Friendly Card was Parsons fifth studio album, it peaked at #13 on the charts. The single \\"Snake Eyes\\" peaked at #47 & \\"Games People Play\\" was a Top 20 hit. The third single was \\"Time', it peaked at #15. The Turn of a Friendly Card has gambling as its central theme & it does this rather well.    The album opens with \\"May Be a Price to Pay\\", unlike most Parsons albums up to this point, it's not an instrumental. It's probably the weakest song a Parsons had ever opened with. The song begins with a horn fanfare then gets into the proper part of it but it never rises above the ordinary. Next is \\"Games People Play\\", it borders on pop but nothing unique though it does have a catchy chorus. \\"Time\\" slows down the tempo, it's one of their prettier songs. \\"I Don't Wanna Go Home\\" has a syncopated feel but once again isn't anything special. Bairnson does give a pretty decent lead solo. \\"The Gold Bug\\" is an instrumental & is the easily the best song on the album. On previous albums Parsons would have opened the album with this song. Its beginning reminds me of music from a Clint Eastwood spaghetti western. The sax solo is a highlight of the song. Then we get what was on the original release a five part song that was called \\"The Turn of a Friendly Card\\", each section identified by a part, i.e., pt. 1, pt. 2, etc.  The first part was entitled \\"The Turn of a Friendly Card, Pt. 1\\" , is a slow tempo song with a beautiful melody. It becomes a recurring theme through the remaining songs. Then comes the single \\"Snake Eyes\\" which has a prominent rhythm guitar. It solidifies the theme of the album. Then comes \\"The Ace of Swords\\" (a tarot reference), a harpsichord is one of the main instruments opening the song. It's an instrumental that has a jazz-like section. \\"Nothing Left to Lose\\" is another slow tempo song that features a memorable melody. It ends with a reggae sample then goes int a heavier rendition of previous theme. Ian Bairnson gives us one of his best solo efforts. \\"Nothing Left to Lose\\" repeats the melody of \\"The Turn of a Friendly Card\\". This ends the original album. Overall there isn't a bad song on this album & the five part song \\"The Turn of a Friendly Card\\" is the definite highlight of the album. \\"The Gold Bug\\" stands right above it.    The remastering is excellent & features seven(!) bonus tracks. We get the demo version of \\"May Be a Price to Pay\\" Then there's three versions of \\"Nothing Left to Lose\\", the first one is only the instrument tracks, the second one is has a Chris Rainbow voval but incomplete, then the third version has Eric Woolfson doing a guide vocal (a common practice in those days). We get an early attempt at \\"Time\\", this song came a long way from this version. There's a rough mix of \\"Games People Play\\", which means it was a mix they knew they weren't going to use. Finally there's the demo version of \\"The Gold Bug\\" which is interesting because we see some of the genesis of the song. It's not near as good as the finished product, which is what makes it a demo, right?     The Turn of a Friendly Card is another Parsons album I'm never quite sure about, my feelings go back & forth on it at times. It's a solid effort just not a spectacular one. I guess you could say I've been spoiled by some of their better efforts.
B0015I2P0Y|4.0|I like most of what I've heard from elbow's previous efforts, but this album seems like a new direction -- it is more melodic, more rich, and has a greater depth, but without sacrificing variety.  There are a range of different kinds of songs on this album -- my first impression was that it starts out strong and seems to get more subtle and delicate as the album continues, but on subsequent listens I've found there to be a lot of variety and interest in the later songs.<br /><br />The song opens with \\"Starlings,\\" that sets up a gentle rhythm and melody to chanting that then blasts out suddenly like trumpets -- the vocals are lovely and melancholic ... a man in love who feels he's out of prospects \\"you are the only thing in any room you're ever in, I'm stubborn selfish and too old.\\"  \\"Weather to fly\\" is another very moving  song -- reminds a bit of later Pink Floyd, but has a distinctive sound.  I also really dig \\"The Loneliness of the Tower Crane Driver.\\"  For those who like alternative rock and pop, like Pinback, Radiohead, Wilco, Sparklehorse, Andrew Bird, Death Cab for Cutie, etc. this is highly recommended.
B00028HBKM|5.0|I still cannot believe that people made a fuss over the \\"violence\\". I will admit that it's pretty harsh but Mel was trying to fit the Isiah 53 description of Christs' death. I like how it touched base with Christs' last temptation which WAS NOT temptation for a woman but satan tempting Him not to die for us because we don't deserve it. I also liked the relationship status briefs it shows on Him and His disciples. For a believer, and someone whom is a reader of the Bible and believes it, this will bring to life what you have read, and for those whom do not believe..this film will probably be just another over-dramatic film (I've heard these terms from some folk thats why I mention it here).<br />Over all, the acting was great but of course I do agree with some when they say this is not a film that you watch over pop corn and soda pop...<br /><br />However, I just wish they would have left the first version of Mel's film alone, how funny to complain about an accurate descriptive film (that includes violence) and yet we except pornography and MUCH more violence in everyday films...just go to show how our world is running today. I loved the film because it's my roots, whether or not people want to believe it, thats a different story...do you own research...
B0013KTGAG|3.0|I just saw \\"Sunshine\\" recently and thought it had a lot of potential but the actors/ characters didn't really seem like earth could have picked them to save the solar system! They all seemed to have mental problems, like the captain of the first ship, Icarus 1!!! He waited for 6 years staring at the sun waiting to murder whoever came by so they wouldn't be able to save the earth.<br /><br />!!!SUNSHINE SPOILERS!!!<br /><br />Wasn't sure what the story was trying to tell, was the proximity to the sun makeing them go nuts since someone on board the Icarus 2 was also getting all happy from just staring at the sun? There was a wrist cutting suicide and guys on a fragile space ship could not keep themselves from getting into a fist fight? I did like the idea of the shield for the ship and having to deliver a bomb to the sun although it seems as though the writers didn't exactly know what to do as the ship got there. Even if the suns flames don't get you, being in the sun would instantly make you a cinder, not sure how he was supposed to detonate a bomb while he was in the sun!<br /><br />I just get the feeling this script had a lot of rewrites and some of the ideas of the original plot were vestigial appendages in the final script
B0015D3Z4O|1.0|Let it be said that I'm a lifelong Madonna fan and love most of her stuff. Now, it used to be that the bottom album on my list was \\"American Life\\" with its mostly dry, lifeless sound but after \\"Hard Candy\\" even *it* is starting to look good.<br />More than a Madonna record, this looks like one where she guested vocals at. The lyrics are mostly just shallow expositions and the sound is a thick, Justin-infused concoction which doesn't hold up. The songs feel like an overlong, boring repetition of hip-hop style beats. And while Madonna doesn't shy away from trying new things and has done r&b/hip-hop style music in the past, those felt like interesting, honest experiments (or just plain amazing, like \\"Forbidden love\\" from Bedtime Stories); \\"Candy\\" sounds like MTV-worthy goop and blends with the background noise quite well.<br />The cover and booklet art don't stand out either: a boring retread of earlier Madonna concepts which get a more ho-ish than erotic makeover. Yes, she probably looks better at 50 than most women in their 30s and 40s, but what what do we care if the music sucks?<br />\\"4 minutes to save the world\\", the first single, and \\"Miles away\\" seem to be the most listenable, but even those only manage to become minor Madonna songs. Proof that she can make great music still is the \\"Confessions\\" record so I eagerly await her next album. I just hope she's very very far from Justin/Timbaland and the Atlanta hip-hop posse when that comes.<br /><br />Rating: Boo-worthy

0978607651|5.0|I gave this large format book to my son who is a graphic designer.  I had seen a segment on television about Todd Oldham's admiration of Charley Harper, and the story caught my imagination.  My son loved it, and recommended it to a retail store where he works near the Savannah College of Art & Design.  They now carry it.  Full of inspiration for the artist or the aspiring artist in your life.
B000QQFKYE|4.0|Regarding INLAND EMPIRE, David Lynch said digital filmmaking was a revelation for him and he'd never return to conventional cinematic hardware.  The smaller equipment offered greater freedom of movement and the superior light-capturing ability allowed for less cumbersome set-ups and more \\"natural\\" takes.<br /><br />And also--he can shoot FOREVER and it don't cost nothin'.<br /><br />The digital world allows Lynch, in INLAND EMPIRE, to, finally, fully indulge in his obsession with the dread eminating from mid-century modern furniture.<br /><br />This isn't so much a movie as a meditation on the decor.<br /><br />As for the story, it's Brand Lynch: the main character (Laura Dern) suffers through endless fracturings of persona and reality.<br /><br />What's new here is the time alloted for the background to roar and yawn and seeth/fester/stutter in tones from dullest taupe to fever red to blinding flourescence.<br /><br />Lynch sees the normality of these 1950s Americana settings as a mask getting ready to fall and expose a truly horrible underneath.<br /><br />Though I think this one has a happy ending.  Your call.<br /><br />INLAND EMPIRE isn't great Lynch, like BLUE VELVET or MULHOLLAND DRIVE.  It lacks narrative cohesion.  BUT--it's something to fall into, watch several times, groove on the truly uncomfortable vibe, maybe nod off and dream some weird stuff yourself and see how it fits into Lynch's bizarre, utterly unique Living Space.<br /><br />Cheers.
1594489505|5.0|I read this novel immediately after reading \\"The Kite Runner\\".  I had not read the reviews, but selected it simply because it was written by the Kahled Hosseini.  For those who want a happy tale and are averse to graphic brutality, this book may not be for you; unless you are willing to patiently hope to find redemption.  In that respect, this novel mirrors life - redemption is not always obvious but it is generally there for those with the patience to hold on.  The brutal treatment of the women in this story at first made me wonder if Hosseini was intent on being an apologist for western intervention in Afghanistan (and Iraq) by painting such an intolerable picture.  But as I read the story, I recognized a beautiful resilience in the women and some of the men.  There indeed are monsters in this book.  But there is more than enough bravery of human spirit to leave one with a sense of hope by the final page.    This is a GREAT book!  I borrowed it from the library, but I would own this one for purposes of exploring the wealth of middle eastern literary references alone.
B0009S4IHY|5.0|A fantastic lesson in comedic storytelling from Chinese cinema.  A classic hero story with lots of over the top laughs.  It seems that much of modern day comedy focuses on gags and doesn't place too much emphasis on an actual story.  That's all fine and good - I love a good laugh as much as the next person - but Kung Fu Hustle manages to get in those gags and laughs without sacrificing the story.<br /><br />I went into the theater thinking it was going to be a good-times cheesy Kung Fu parody... I left thinking it was the best movie I had seen all year.
B000FC1GJW|4.0|Pullman's trilogy has made it's hold in our society.  If you have read the first two books then it is pretty much a conclusion that it is time to pick up his third.  The Amber Spyglass is my least favorite of the trilogy.  It is a bit anticlimatic.  It seems that Pullman pulled the focus away from his charactors to put it on some agenda.  After all the buildup the ending was just to abrupt to leave me trully satisfied.
B00005JKDR|5.0|Everyone has their favorite Pixar film - this is mine.  I remember sitting in the theater, blown away by the entire world that had been created by the minds at Pixar.  The story is great and the comedy is all there.  Every time I watch I pick up a new joke or gag and it never gets old. The voice actors are great and there's not a weak spot to be found.
B000YDOOU0|3.0|I'm going to have to say I was disappointed with this album for a number of different reasons. I'll start by saying that it is not by any stretch a bad album, per-se. Metheny does have some serious chops and his new trio-mates, Christian McBride and Antonio Sanchez, are both excellent musicians that I have liked for a while in their own rights. Those concessions aside I have to say that I feel like Metheny is stuck in a rut musically speaking. I think its such a shame that Metheny sounds just like last time here. Not that Metheny sounded bad the last time around, just that I was hoping for something different or new to come with the new trio. If there is any exploration here it is tepid at best. At first when I began listening to this album, it struck me as pretty good standard Metheny affair. I found I could not stomach an entire albums worth of it though and began to zone out during Metheny's solo's. The album became for me a vehicle of the two other trio members who are both in fine form here. Still, however, a disappointment.
B00000K3CR|5.0|this is another really cute movie. Tom hanks looks so very young and cute in this movie while he was so much younger and was still a new actor back then. Even Elizabeth Perkins looks very hot and quiet stunning in the movie. Overall its a good pass time movie and also quiet entertaining with all the thrill that takes place between tom hanks &  Elizabeth Perkins right from the beginning to the end. Being a movie buff I would also recommend this movie for ones private collection.
0399226907|5.0|This book goes in and out of favor with my daughter, but the fact that at different stages she finds it engaging is what really makes this a great classic book. We started reading this to her at 3 months. She could follow along in the story and be engaged at 6 months. And even now at 18 months, she's saying the fruit names, putting her finger in the holes and paying attention to the story line. This is a MUST GET book for any child!
B000J10EQU|5.0|This is one superb movie starring Brandon Routh , also very entertaining and also quiet a romantic movie. More over to watch this handsome superman doing his considerate act of saving the world again & again & again & again simply tirelessly is a great treat in itself. This is one of the movies one can never watch over & over and still never get bored at all & so its a lovely addition to ones personal collection.
0783226837|5.0|This movie is a classic!!!  My favorite memory was renting this film when I was 12 and watching it 8 times in a row with my friend.  I will never get tired of this movie.  Every time its on TV I have to watch it.  If you have never seen this film Kevin Bacon is at his best when he is saving people from giant man-eating worms.
B0008JIJ2E|5.0|This is also one funtastic movie. The way the unspoken affection of the karate Master is shown is simply amazing. Even the kid is a good obidient student & also very casual. The determination of the kid and even his coach is very good as well. The kids victory at the end is a very nice ending again. This is one of the must watch films and a must have movie in ones personal collection. Thats what I would say.
078322933X|4.0|EThis was a good movie. It was very much full of suspense. Good story too. One thing it definitely supported was my strong conviction in the right to own a gun. This is a movie is a must see for a candy*** liberal do-gooder who doesn't believe in the private ownership of guns. That person might have a changed view on gun control after viewing this (I hope). I recommend this movie for Rosie O'Donnell and Michael Moore and other peeps of their ilk. This would be rather educational for them.
0393330435|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book but like others, I found it annoying at times.  It is an autobiography.  Most of the book is about boring details of Steve Wozniak's life.  His account of how Apple Computer started and how the Apple I and II where created is very interesting,  unfortunately it is a very small part of the book.  It was very annoying reading his constant bragging about how humble he is.    The book gave me a better understanding of early PC history and the history of Apple. I also wanted to learn more about a guy I consider a hero.  I did learn more about Woz but I must say that based on what I learned from this book I respect him a lot less than before.
B0014Z4OQG|2.0|I still am not sure how we sat through this movie.  I guess we kept hoping it would get better.  The entire premise of someone continually video taping anything while everyone around them is being killed is idiotic.  The movie could have been pretty good had it not been filmed through the \\"eyes\\" of a video camera.  Don't waste your time or money buying this junk.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I have watched DVD a lot and listened to the CD numerous times.  Sarah and her band was very good on the concert.  I would recommend a must buy for music lovers.
B0016A2FFG|5.0|Takes you back.  Listen to that organ.  Wonderful, both technically and musically. Soul music like it should be.
0671449028|5.0|love this book.  I hope my son will too when he gets older...simple and quaint and nice.
B000YAA68C|5.0|Although I generally am not a big fan of \\"chick flicks\\" this was one of my favorite movies of 2007. It's the type of movie that makes you both laugh and cry. Be sure to have tissues handy when you watch it. Even the guys in the audience were laughing at the funny parts. Oh, and for you Buffy the Vampire Slayer fans, James Marsters has a decent sized role as a husband to the main character's best friend. I was pleasantly surprised to see his name in the opening credits, and then almost didn't recognize him because he is a brunet in the movie.
0694003611|5.0|My babies love it. Not sure why, maybe the rhythm and the simplicity. I have bought a second copy as the first one was read to rags.
1423101464|5.0|This is an excellent book in a wonderful series.  I am a librarian and I could not wait for the library copy so I preordered on Amazon.  We had to put our names in a hat to pick who read it first that is how much our family loves the series.  My children are 11 and 16 and they both read it in a few days.    It is exciting and funny.  All the favorite characters are back and a few new ones.  We can't wait for the next one!
B0000VAFO0|5.0|DVD in good condition (oughta be; it's new), containing the film ordered (what a surprise), BUT did in fact include scenes I'd not previously seen and which helped clarify the plot just that bit more.  Am well pleased.
B0015D3Z4O|2.0|The songs linger too long, behind a generic, repetitious dance formula.    There's nothing interesting to keep you listening. I'm not sure what happened here - not what I would have expected from this artist.
B000002GIE|5.0|I think this was a pretty good album.   I even got laid while playing \\"Rock a bye bye\\" a day before joining the military.
B001A4LYN2|1.0|This is a movie that tries to be artistic but fails on all levels. Very little character development, and what characters you do get to know change personalities randomly just to fit the storyline. I have learned that the more hype a movie has, the worse it will be. COMPLETE LETDOWN!!!!!
B0000VCZK2|5.0|The remastered versions are much better than the originals.  Would recommend purchasing this set to everyone.
6305079900|4.0|While almost 25 years after its release, the Terminator franchise is still going strong.  James Cameron's original film is a low-budget thrillfest that truly made Arnold Schwarzenegger a star.  The film follows a young carefree women as she learns that she will one day give birth to a resistance leader that will save the world. The downside is that evil robots don't want to see that happen and send a robotic Arnold back in the past to kill her long before she's even pregnant.  Lots of bang for the buck with this film as the action and stunts are thrilling and brutal.  Go check out the move that started this billion-dollar franchise.  I recommend it for adults 18+.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|Truly stunning visual effect. Keanu Reeves,Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss totally rocked in all that action. Hey it's sci-fi fantasy the story line can afford to be blurred.
0316067601|5.0|\\"I tried to get a hold of myself. But again in my mind I heard that terrible, terrible scream, the same one that awakens me, bullying its way into my solitary dreams, night after night, the confirmation of guilt. The endless guilt of the survivor. `Help me, Marcus! Please help me!' It was a desperate appeal in the mountains of a foreign land. It was a scream cried out in the echoing high canyons of one of the loneliest places on earth. It was the nearly unrecognizable cry of a mortally wounded creature. And it was a plea I could not answer. I can't forget it. Because it was made by one of the finest people I ever met, a man who happened to be my best friend.\\"<br /><br />In 2005, Marcus Luttrell was part of a four-man mission in the mountains of Afghanistan. A member of the elite Navy SEALs, he was tasked with killing a Taliban leader who had close ties with Osama bin Laden. This small team was hidden outside a village, surveying the area and looking for their target, when a small group of goat herders stumbled upon them. The soldiers quickly detained the two men and the teenage boy and debated what they should do. The most obvious solution and the one that would be most conducive to their mission would be to immediately execute their prisoners. But when the four soldiers put it to a vote, it was determined that they should let these people go. Morality won over personal preservation. But was it morality or fear? \\"Was I afraid of these guys? No. Was I afraid of their possible buddies in the Taliban? No. Was I afraid of the liberal media back in the U.S.A.? Yes. And I suddenly flashed on the prospect of many, many years in a U.S. civilian jail alongside murderers and rapists.\\" The former prisoners quickly and inevitably reported to the Taliban leaders and the SEALs were soon fighting for their lives. Before long three of the men were dead and the fourth, Luttrell, was running for his life (though not before they killed somewhere around 100 enemy soldiers. Don't mess with the SEALs!). It was a terrible slaughter, made worse when a helicopter carrying a rescue force was shot down, killing sixteen more Americans.<br /><br />Lone Survivor tells the story of this mission through the eyes of Littrell, the only man who lived to tell the tale. The book was released to great acclaim and has become a fixture on the bestseller lists. While the book is in many ways a typical war story (a description of SEAL training camp, tales of combat, lots and lots of bad language and tales of remarkable heroism) it goes beyond the story to share at least a couple of very important statements about warfare today. And this is, I think, where the reader stands to benefit most.<br /><br />One of this book's most important statements is that the current rules of engagement soldiers are required to adhere to are irrational and are the product of politicians who are far from the action. \\"Any government that thinks war is somehow fair and subject to rules like a baseball game probably should not get into one. Because nothing's fair in war, and occasionally the wrong people do get killed.\\" American soldiers are being forced to fight in situations where they are almost guaranteed to take casualties because of restrictives rules of engagement. These rules may make sense to politicians safely ensconced in their Washington offices, but they are utterly unfair and unsafe on the battlefield. Luttrell states that these rules are costing lives and that the United States should not be willing to fight wars that she cannot fight to win.<br /><br />The other important statement is about the role of the media in modern warfare. Luttrell's disgust for the media knows no bounds. \\"It's been an insidious progression, the criticisms of the U.S. Armed Forces from politicians and from the liberal media, which knows nothing of combat, nothing of our training, and nothing of the mortal dangers we face out there on the front line.\\" \\"I promise you, every insurgent, freedom fighter, and stray gunman in Iraq who we arrested knew the ropes, knew that the way out was to announce that he had been tortured by the Americans, ill treated, or prevented from reading the Koran or eating his breakfast or watching the television. They all knew al-Jazeera, the Arab broadcasters, would pick it up, and it would be relayed to the U.S.A., where the liberal media would joyfully accuse all of us of being murderers or barbarians or something. Those terrorist organizations laugh at the U.S. media, and they know exactly how to use the system against us.\\" Those of us who have watched recent wars from afar can attest that this is exactly the case. The media, and particularly the liberal media, seems to side with the bad guys. Soldiers are fighting brutal warfare, all the wonder more terrified of their own nation's press than the guys shooting at them. They hardly know who the real enemy is.<br /><br />Lone Survivor is an enjoyable book, typical in many of its facets, but atypical in its deeper message. It is a book Americans would do well to read and to consider.rrested knew the ropes, knew that the way out was to announce that he had been tortured by the Americans, ill treated, or prevented from reading the Koran or eating his breakfast or watching the television.

6305127646|5.0|\\"The Saint\\" is my type of movie.  It is the perfect blend of action adventure, science fiction, and romance.  Excellent performances are given by Val Kilmer as the international thief and Elizabeth Shue as the reclusive scientist.  He is trying to steal her formula for cold fusion.  Together, Kilmer and Shue sizzle.  Their kisses are hot and passionate.  There is plenty of suspense and intrigue as they are pursued by Russian henchmen.  Beautiful London and Moscow scenery and a rocking soundtrack enhance the chases.<br /><br />  Val Kilmer delivers his best performance as the Saint and proves that he can hold a movie on his own.  I was quite impressed with his ability to disguise his appearance and voice and pretend to be so many diverse personalities.<br /><br />  As gas prices continue to soar, I wish cold fusion was a reality.  The implications of \\"The Saint\\" are frightening.  Will the United States run out of heating fuel during the winter as Moscow does in \\"The Saint?\\"  One can only hope that there will be someone like the Saint to steal us the formula for cold fusion.<br /><br />  If you like romantic adventure, then you must buy \\"The Saint\\" for your collection.  The Saint will steal your secrets and your heart.
0307346617|4.0|This book begins to drag after you get about half way through it but it still is very cool that Max Brooks tries something different with the zombie genre. Well written and often very interesting. I can't wait to see what he does next.
B000XV6VOK|3.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the first season of \\"The Tudors,\\" but the second season was rather disappointing. The problem is that everything happens so darn FAST! In Season 2, Henry VIII (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) marries Anne Boleyn (Natalie Dormer), who gives birth to Princess Elizabeth, the child who eventually will become Queen of England. However, Season 2 also depicts Henry forcing everyone in England to take \\"The Great Oath\\" promising to support Elizabeth's right to the throne. Sir Thomas More (Jeremy Northam) is murdered, Katharine of Aragon (Maria Doyle Kennedy) dies, Henry is excommunicated by the Pope (Peter O'Toole), Anne has a bunch of miscarriages and falls out of Henry's good graces, Henry starts screwing around on Anne and eventually becomes obsessed with Jane Seymour (Anita Briem), the entire Boleyn family is brought down, and Anne loses her head. (And no, I am not spoiling anything for people who haven't watched all the episodes yet...anyone who has even a mediocre grasp of history knows what happens in this story!)<br /><br />The fact that \\"The Tudors\\" has only aired for two seasons and the character of Anne Boleyn is already dead depresses the hell out of me. Why does Showtime feel the need to rush everything? The series is based on such vivid historical characters, and \\"The Tudors\\" would be a much better program if the writers just slowed everything down and spent more time allowing the events to unfold. This season spanned at least five years (of course, none of the characters appear to have aged a day...imagine that!). I'm especially disappointed that Dormer will most likely not return next season, because she was the best part of the show. Also, the character of Anne was generally portrayed as an innocent victim in the series, but the character of Henry becomes darker and more sinister with each passing episode. There is nothing likeable or redeeming about him at all anymore, which is unfortunate, as he is the central focus of the series.<br /><br />Where will \\"The Tudors\\" go from here? At this rate, Henry should be dead by the end of Season 3 and Elizabeth should be on the throne early into Season 4. Unless the show slows down a bit, though, I honestly don't think it will last much longer. Viewers who are truly interested in the Tudor period simply won't stand for much more of this crap.ors\\" go from here?

0307346617|5.0|Mr Brooks's accounts of the war were necessarily horrific and should inspire those of us who came out of it with a sense of responsibility to never let it happen again.<br /><br />My family was lucky. My dad and my uncle foresaw the Z outbreak and moved us out into the farm less than a week before Utrecht was torched. While our survival tactics on the farm would neatly compliment Mr Brooks's collection, I am surprised that not much more material regarding the biology of Z has been written, much less made available to survivors.<br /><br />Suffice to say that a clan of veterinarians with the war years to keep us busy (apart from staving off the odd Z attack) provided us ample time and opportunity to dig deeper into the Z's. From my uncle's notes on Z autopsies, he theorized that the Z pathogen is likely a virus / prion hybrid. In simplest terms, he surmised that human to human transmission is via viral infection through bodily fluids -- the zombie's fatal bite -- and human to Z transformation is caused by a prion which attacks the human nervous system and blood. The Z virus's role seems to be to cause a severe type of flu or fever that significantly raises the body's and brain's temperature leading to a comatose state. Once the human is comatose and its brain/bodily functions slowed, the Z prion transforms the central nervous system and blood into a battery - battery acid combination which kills the person, but animates the body to keep transmitting the Z virus-prion hybrid into other humans. My uncle didn't succeed in fully mapping out this transformation, but he was focused on identifying the interaction of the extreme body heat, and nervous tissue transformation through some as yet undiscovered protein (some sort of rNA?) or \\"molecule-sized parasite\\" (carried through the Z virus.<br /><br />Just as he was researching how the Z virus and prion \\"live together\\", my uncle was himself accidentally infected right at the end of the war. Before he fell into the coma, he willed that his brain and blood be extracted for observation. In a sealed chamber rigged by my dad, my uncle's brain / blood battery has been powering the light in the basement with a steady direct current since the end of WWZ.<br /><br />I'm certain that my uncle's findings are not original. And yet I've found no credible discussions of causes and preventions for possible future Z outbreak. I pray that this is period of \\"peace\\" is not merely a lull in the storm.

B000LJKXXY|5.0|This game was introduced to me by one of my coworkers. He brought it in and taught us the rules, which took about a minute and a half to learn. He'd been playing this game for years and after our 5th game, I finally beat him! Its just a matter of learning the skill and being cunning. Its a great game for anyone that loves chess, but its simpler and easier to learn. I would say that anyone from age 4 and up can learn how to play it. Its a great game for classrooms also.  The rules of the game are simple. Each player gets 10 fences and one pawn. The winner is the first person to get their pawn all the way across the board. Each player takes turns, either moving their pawn or a fence. Once the fence is on the board, it cant be moved, and you cant put fences all the way across the board to completely block the other player. You have to leave at least one opening for your opponent to make it across the board, even if that means they have to travel through a maze or all the way back to their side of the board to get around your fences. I love this game and am ordering more of them in our office, as we've now set up a tournament!

B00014NE62|5.0|Over twenty years after it was made \\"Maurice\\" has changed into a classic but did not age at all. This coming-of-age and coming-to-terms story faithfully taken from E. M. Forster's novel was transferred into the screen with such adroitness that with the passage of time it rather increases its appeal.<br />We are transferred to the Edwardian England some years before the outbreak of the Great War. The main hero Maurice is an average student (it is funny to note that everybody including Maurice considers his studies a commendable pastime but generally a waste of time as he should go into business) who falls for a fellow student, an impoverished aristocrat Clive. Their romance is purely platonic which seems to suit Clive (who finally decides to change his minds and gets married which puts an end to their little fling) survives their Cambridge period but is clearly insufficient for Maurice. After failed attempts to cure himself of his illness (both medicine and hypnosis are used) he visits Clive in his estate and falls in love again - this time for a game-keeper. This love is consummated and provides an opening for a happy ending which neither Forster nor the movie does not really offer.<br />The movie tells this story rather slowly, indulging in beautiful landscapes and period interiors, but one can hardly mind. It is simply a great movie with very decent performance from the cast - including Hugh Grant with a moustache.
B000E97X66|5.0|Like everyone else, Bruce has the \\"best live show ever\\". And if this and Live 1975/1985 are any indication, he deserves that reputation. Think \\"sheer, combustible energy\\". So if the bombastic arrangements of Born to Run weren't to your tastes (though they certainly are to mine!), this album is for you. For instance, \\"Thunder Road\\" becomes a bare-bones piano/harmonica ballad, and it works very well. And how about that energy? Well, Clarence Clemons manages to take the place of the entire horn section on \\"Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out\\", which is also given a more prominent guitar part, and \\"Spirit in the Night\\" becomes a swinging, nervy dynamo. \\"She's the One\\" ends up so frenzied you can barely understand the vocals, but it's so good you won't care. I also think this version of \\"Born to Run\\" embodies rock `n' roll even more than the original does, because it takes away the Spectoresque production. Of course, the original's great, but this one might be even better. They also instill \\"It's Hard to be a Saint in the City\\", never one of my favorite Springsteen songs until now, with all kinds of life. And you thought that \\"Lost in the Flood\\" was intense originally? You haven't heard this version. Give a listen to Bruce's howls... it's creepy stuff. Ironically, Bruce takes one of his most energetic songs (\\"The E Street Shuffle\\") and slows it down to a moderate, bluesy pace. But it sounds just great! On the other hand, \\"Backstreets\\" doesn't sound much different than the original (though the piano fills are different from the original version - and yes, I have heard \\"Backstreets\\" enough to know the difference), but it still sounds good, even though I'm generally opposed to people playing live like that. Now, allow me to stop raving for just a second and concentrate on criticizing one song. \\"Kitty's Back\\", taken out to seventeen minutes and change, is just too long. I like parts of it, especially the sax soloing near the end, but it really throws off the momentum. So the train temporarily becomes derailed, but it's brought back on track by a powerful \\"Jungleland\\" and a rousing \\"Rosalita\\". Oh, and \\"4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)\\" is awesome, as always. Other than the accordion. The biggest surprise is \\"Detroit Medley\\", a fun medley of Mitch Ryder hits. Then it settles down with another excellent sparse piano ballad, a long but worthwhile rearrangement of \\"For You\\". The concluding doo-wop cover \\"Quarter to Three\\" revs things up once more, and is quite good, complete with a fake ending.

Both he and Morgan seem especially suited for the religiosity of this session especially the title cut \\"Moaning,\\" which is pure funk with a capital \\"F\\".<br /><br />The rest of the session is rather mundane but still of very high quality. My favorite is Blues March, which is a return to funk with a march tempo and a explosive blues kick. A drum launches Golson into one of his unimaginable solos. God, how under rated can a tenor player be? Morgan stretches out on this piece also.<br /><br />Blakey just kept getting better after this album. But I must say that Golson's playing with the pre-Coltrane flavoring to it, stood out and just made me want more. Amen and Five Stars

This change will be in the form of restructuring, layoffs, budget cuts, position eliminations, and anything else associated a \\"crisis\\".    You, the reader, also need to make your own choices based on the information available to you and I don't believe this is sufficiently covered in the book.

0385340567|4.0|Jack Reacher decides to diagonally see the country so he leaves Maine heading for San Diego using whatever transportation he can find.  When Jack enters Colorado, he notices on his map a road from Hope to Despair, which fascinates him and he takes it.  However, in town, the waitress at the only restaurant ignores him when he enters.  Soon four big men tell him to leave; he breaks the nose of one of them and demands coffee, which is served.  After locking him up for a few hours, the judge orders him removed from Despair.  Jack decides if they put him on the road west he will keep going but if they point him towards Hope he will return; Jack never retreats.<br /><br />At the edge of Hope, police officer Vaughn picks him up and tells him to forget Despair, a company town that is run by the enigmatic owner of the state's largest metal recycling plant.  Jack tells Vaughn he will return to Despair and does so by sneaking around until he trips over a dehydrated corpse.  Back in Hope, Vaughn tells him a college age girl wants to see him at the restaurant. Her boyfriend is missing since they entered Despair.  Jack talks to her and vows to himself that he will find her husband as she explains she married her boyfriend and what is going on next door; not anticipating that evil in Despair is killing American soldiers overseas.<br /><br />NOTHING TO LOSE seems over the top of the Rockies but no one will care as Reacher being who he is refuses to back down from a confrontation; sort of like Rambo starring in A Bad Day At Black Rock (instead of Spencer Tracy's Macreedy).  The story line is action-packed from the moment Jack decides to get a bite at the company town's restaurant and the four deputies prove they don't know Jack when they confront him.  Fans of the series will appreciate his latest quarrel that soon leads to repercussions half way around the world.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner

His solo there is so intense and emotion filled that it leaves you breathless.<br /><br />Miles takes a back seat to Cannonball, but not because its Cannonball's gig, but because Cannonball's playing has no end to its emotional depth. It is a clich&eacute; to say it, but it is simply something else, period. And Hank Jones piano playing cannot be improved upon. It is exquisitely precise and the chords he drops makes the spine tingle. This is a good album, period.<br /><br />Fifty stars

Family was trying to decide what we should do.  I cried all the way through the book.  I had seen my father twice beffore this trip and had observed enough to br concerned.<br /><br />  Alice Howland taught cognitive psychology courses at Harvard for over twenty-five years. Alice and her husband, John authored Molecules to Mind, she published papers, and lectured around the world. Her three children were grown and on their own paths (not that she was very happy about Lydia's choice of acting, but she hadn't given up trying to influence her to go back to real school). Her son Tom was doing well in school, daughter Annie and her husband, Charlie are attorneys trying to conceive a first grandchild.<br /><br />Facing a busy schedule and travel and everyday stress, Alice isn't concerned when she begins to forget little things, where the keys are, names of acquaintances or a momentary sense of disorientation. After all she is fifty and that is part of menopause. .<br /><br />A trip to her family doctor to get some suggestions for cognitive memory reinforcement and to see if medication is available does not help. Alice is stunned to learn that she has Early Onset Alzheimer's and that there is not very much available for treatment. Telling her husband and children is even harder to face. Eventually she has to face the loss of her teaching and life's work.<br /><br />\\"Still Alice\\" is Alice's voice as she struggles with the advancement of Alzheimer's. As the disease advances, she is living more in the now, and often hurt by her interpretations of family member's words and actions. She reacts with anger and confusion as her world shifts and becomes more unfamiliar and frightening. Her family also has to deal with their emotions. The realization that their funny, loving accomplished mother and wife is slowly disappearing before their eyes are devastating, and they each react differently. Alice tries to stay aware of what is happening, but has the disease advances her voice becomes quieter and briefer. Lisa Genova has a Ph.D in Neuroscience from Harvard University and works with several Alzheimer's organizations as well as serving as the online columnist for the national Alzheimer's Association. Although \\"Still Alice\\" is a work of fiction, it is apparent there is much drawn from real life experiences and observations. Genova has given a voice to a population not usually listened to. The characters are facing uncertainty and struggling with Alice's decent into unknowing. There are moments of hilarity as well as heartbreak.

We have had to uproot him from his home in Texas to move into our home in Utah where either my husband or I can be with him around the clock. We moved into a house and I have drastically cut back on my work load. I keep looking back to the pages where Alice tries to describe her confusion and tries to frame what she wants from those around her so I can somehow meet those same needs in my Father. I fear I am falling short.....there is so much anger directed at me and my husband for moving him away. No matter how hard I have tried I feel I am falling short. \\"It's nothing personal, Mary....I like your brothers more than you\\".  It's not all gloom and doom.

B0015RFCZ0|4.0|This film was just fun to watch.  I play piano and my fiance plays guitar, so we both had a connection to the musical aspect of this movie.  It really takes the concept of music as something that connects everyone to a different level.    It was beautiful and heart-warming (my fiance even shed a tear!).  My only complaint was that it could have been longer to accomodate a little more character development, but I understand that this movie is supposed to have a sort of fairy tale feel to it.
B0015D3YQI|5.0|Perhaps one of Dario Argento's most bizarre films ever, Phenomena is pure 80s horror fun, with brilliant moments and a killer score. Although it is often criticzised for making little or no sense, Phenomena is effective at setting up a dream-like feeling of spookiness, with the required gory pay-offs. While not as polished looking as Suspiria or Inferno, or technically advanced, I find it still holds up with time.<br /><br />The story of a young girl who can communicate with insects, and her stay at a creepy Swiss boarding school, complete with slasher killer, this one is for horror fans everywhere.<br /><br />May I add, the Anchor Bay edition is the best looking transfer still, without those annoying Italian language shifts mid-conversation, and with the gore complete.

Well, that is exactly how Erykah Badu's music is.  You have to have a certain mind-frame if you put an Erykah Badu CD in because she will take you places, whether you have heard the disc once or three hundred times.  Her music is much like a drug, but perhaps that is her intention.  \\"New Amerykah\\" is a really good album, but, in order to fully appreciate it, listen to it several times.<br /><br /> \\"Honey\\" was the first song released to radio.  This song generated a nice amount of buzz for Badu and it's corresponding video is creativity at its best!  \\"Honey\\" has a great beat, sweet lyrics and a nice delivery by Badu.  In fact, her voice shines throughout the album.  She can do quite a bit with her vocal instrument; on this album, she hit some notes I didn't know she could!  She truly amazed me with certain vocals.  \\"That Hump\\" is a great song.  In this song, she gives her listener much as far as vocals are concerned.  There is also a great deal of sincerity within her voice.  This track is a slower-tempoed song and you will definitely find yourself replaying it because you'll feel you missed something the first time.  \\"Soldier\\" has a magnificent beat, though kind of simple.  The melody is great as well.<br /><br /> If you took anything positive from Badu's past albums, you should definitely add this disc to your collection.  It's similar in style to her previous works, but there are vast differences between her past work and \\"New Amerykah.\\"  This disc should not be passed up.<br /><br />Mikeisha's Top 5<br /><br />1. \\"Soldier\\"<br />2. \\"Honey\\"<br />3. \\"The Healer/Hip Hop\\"<br />4. \\"Me\\"<br />5. \\"Telephone\\"

0743290119|3.0|After loving the author's first book, The Devil Wears Prada, and being really disappointed by her second, Everyone Worth Knowing, I was hoping Chasing Harry Winston would be more like the first and less like the second.  There were parts of this one that I really liked and parts that I thought were ridiculous.  The writing was at times clever and entertaining, but at other times unrealistic and contrived.  There was way too much awkward and gratuitious name dropping of celebrities and other books, and the characters all seemed really shallow and underdeveloped.  Overall it seems like the author spent a lot of time writing certain parts but not so much on others.  Definitely not worth $25.95 for a hardcover of less than 300 pages, but at 40+% off at Costco, not necessarily a waste.  I'd recommend it as a quick, light beach read, but if you're looking for really good chick lit, try Emily Giffin's latest - Love The One You're With or Sherri Rifkin's LoveHampton.

0140622144|5.0|I almost put this book down after the first 100 pages. The writing was difficult to get into and I kept thinking to myself, \\"is it worth the bother?\\"<br /><br />I am SO glad that I did persist through the book, because it certainly was worth it. Woolf's writing is very lyrical and flows so freely (and so scattered!) that I sometimes had to re-read sentences multiple times to make sure I'd understood things correctly. It was slow going compared to my usual reading; but it was so beautiful! There's a passage in the book where Mr. Ramsey is reading, and it explains my approach to the book rather well:<br />\\"He read...as if he were guiding something, or wheedling a large flock of sheep, or pushing his way up and up a single narrow path; and sometimes he went fast and straight, and broke his way through the bramble, and sometimes it seemed a branch struck at him, a bramble blinded him, but he was not going to let himself be beaten by that; on he went, tossing over page after page.\\"<br /><br />Woolf's brier patch of words is thick and convoluted, but it was completely worthwhile picking it apart in spite of the slow start.
B00122M2QU|3.0|It is a fast album. It is definitely metal or rather metal core with fast hardcore influence. Riffs yes, but not a lot of groovy stuff. Here and there are surprises (a guitar melody comes in the middle of a song and you go like hey, this is strange) in a good way. It is raw, not very will thought as if they are in a hurry (and yes they were in a hurry by the way to release the album). The lyrics are classic Max; shut the **ck up, jump the sh** off and stuff like that... Not innovative, but have energy. Drumming; well it is Igor at its best but not shining as it was in Dante album (as in that performance the music is relatively slow, giving more space to drumming and filling). As a package, the feeling is more Soulfly than Sepultura or Nailbomb; but without the feel of the guest musicians like it was in Primitive... Do not expect any Gojiralike influence, no stops and breaks. Not a great leap forward in terms of musicianship, but still it fulfills the curiosity of fans.<br /><br />At the end, a fan may ask would the world be the same without this album; the answer is a definite yes!
0595440096|5.0|I have thought for days about words to use to describe Lisa Genova's book, Still Alice.  But words just weren't coming to me.  Finally I realized the reason is because this wonderful book transcends thoughts and words.  It meets us on a deeper level, by opening the hearts of the readers to the plight of Alice and her family as they live through the process and the progress of early-onset Alzheimer's.  Very few authors have the capacity to create fictional characters who seem so real and to elicit such deep emotions from their readers - using only words!  Lisa Genova has masterfully created a masterpiece, that I - like many other reviewers and everyone I know who has read this book - literally could not put down.  I was thrilled to have it with me for a day of air travel, and very sad to say goodbye to Alice and her family when I read the last page.  Yes, it's very sad to say goodbye.

I highly recommend this film, which is often tagged as a ''Halloween movie,'' but can really be enjoyed at ANY time of the year.
B0000AUHPK|5.0|The performance of Binoche and Finness in Wuthering Heights was amazingly powerful. People often criticize the movie, but, I believe, the director was extraordinarily faithful to the original story.  All criticism was directed at how sadistic Heathcliff(Ralph Fiennes) was towards everybody. It is the director's right to add or omit whatever he finds necessary to make a movie version of the book. In this case, the director's choice was to have the characters semi identical to the book's original ones.<br /><br />It's very simple, if you loved the novel, you would love the movie and forgive the portions that were omitted, and admire the total focus on Heathcliff's anger, and evil side. It's not the movie/director/actors' fault that the novel original characters are actually defected, imperfect human beings.<br /><br />Even though Wuthering Heights is a great piece of literature, a wild emotional story that is written in a fascinating way, the characters always puzzled me. If everybody is calling Heathcliff a sadistic crazy man, what then is Catherine? I believe that Catherine is even more sadistic and cruel than any other character in the novel.<br /><br />Catharine was completely engaged in self worship and didn't care about any other human being.  The only thing she loved about Heathcliff was his love and devotion to her.  She enjoyed breaking his heart, breaking her husband's heart, and enjoyed torturing Edgar's sister with her sense of entitlement to Heathcliff and his love.<br /><br />\\"..Why did you betray your heart Catherine?....I forgive my murderer, but yours, I will never forgive...\\" yeah, Fiennes got to me saying these words, but for the love of God, how delusional can people be? Nobody broke Heathcliff's heart but his Catherine, and no one killed Catherine.<br /><br />Five stars, to Wuthering Heights for its timeless depiction of human dark side, and when I say dark side, I mean every character in the movie except Catharine the daughter. To me, Catharine the daughter is the only character with some common sense and virtue.  I would give more than five stars to the movie if possible, simply because Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche captured so well, the darkest side of love and selfishness as the stars of a great novel.he daughter is the only character with some common sense and virtue.

630471193X|4.0|Phenomenon is a pleasant film with fine acting (particularly John Travolta and Robert Duvall), beautiful setting and photography, and nice score by Thomas Newman.  Unfortunately, the 2.35:1 widescreen DVD is not enhanced for 16:9 TVs, which makes it a real shame.
B00003CX5P|4.0|Is it really 9 years since The Phantom Menace brought Star Wars back to the Cinema after a 16 year hiatus? Back in the summer of 1999, the world was a very differant place to today. Bill Clinton was still American President. The Twin Towers were still standing and few people had heard of Al Qeada. As we counted down to a new Millennium the world appeared to be on the cusp of a new golden age of econmic prosperity and relative peace. Admist this background came Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace. The hype and expectation for this movie was probably greater than anything before or since in movie history. What film could ever hope to live up to this hype and expectation? No film ever could. The initial response from fanboys and critics across the world was cries of anguish and pain. Claims of childhoods being raped drowned out the more sensible reflections that actually this movie whilst not particularly great, was as bad as many claimed it was. Now, almost a decade on from the initial release, perhaps the time is right for a more considered view of this film?     The Phantom Menace is the very definition of a \\"mixed\\" film. It has both good and bad points, and whether you end up liking this film will depend on;     1. Do the bad points outweigh the good points for you?   2. Do the good points outweigh the bad points for you?     Thus you will find the answer of whether or not this movie works for you, somewhere in the balance of the two.     Some of the bad points; George Lucas's direction is stiff. Lucas hadn't directed a film since 1977 and it shows.   Jar Jar Binks is annoying and tedious and frequently gets in the way, however, as with so many complaints about this film, Binks is NOT as bad as some would have you believe, and you CAN enjoy this film despite the presense of JJB. Children will love Jar Jar, so if you show this film to your 8 year old child, please don't let your loathing of Mr Bink's ruin your child's love for this character.   Other bad pointsare that the pod race goes on too long (it went on too long in the theatrical release, and for some reason its been extended further for the DVD)   Ewan Mcgregor unfortunatly gets very little to do.   Natalie Portman shines as Queen Amidala, but as Padme she often leaves a lot to be desired. Jake Lloyds Anakin is given some annoyingly silly lines to read out (as with Binks, Lloyd is NOT as bad as outraged fanboys would have you believe)   The Gungans are probably the worse species in SW history (except for the Ewoks of course ;) ) and the final battle between the Gungans and the Battle Droids is unengaging.   Perhaps my main complaint about Menace is that the two characters that get the most screen time, Jar Jar Binks and Qui-Gon Jinn, are the two characters that don't really feature in the next two films. Thus, this is, I think, the central problem with Menace. Its mainly filler. Lucas needed \\"more\\" in this film.     Some of the good points; Liam Neeson is the glue that holds this film together. Anybody that says the acting was better in the OT, should look at Neesons performance. Its at least as good as anything in the OT.   The political sub-plot is interesting and engaging and seeing how Palpatine begins his rise to power is compelling. Ian Mcdiarmid is outstanding in the small number of scenes he is given.   The Mother/Son relationship between Anakin and his Mother is well done and you do feel a sense of Anakins pain at being parted from his mother and having to leave her as a slave. The twist of Anakin's origins (that he was born without a father) adds a mystical and mythical element. Deeply religious people may be offended, but \\"virgin births\\" feature in many mythical stories.   Seeing the workings of the Jedi Council and how the Jedi relate to the Senate is interesting.   Darth Maul is cool and The Duel Of The Fates is probably the most exciting lightsaber battle of the Saga. The piece of music that accompany's the duel is truely outstanding (otherwise JohnWilliams' score on TPM isn't very memorable - Like Lucas, at times you get the sense he is warming himself up with this picture   The general time and effort and attention to detail is wonderful. For Amidala's gowns alone costume designer Trisha Biggar should have won an Oscar. ILM's special effects are amazing. The film looks outstanding and sounds wonderful. As a piece of art, The Phantom Menace is an awesome blend of creativity and artisitic inspiration. Too bad the final product ended up so mixed.     Just to say, the movie ranks as a solid *** affair, but the DVD package itself takes it up to **** The central documentery; The Beginning is one of the best DVD extras you'll find on any DVD release. An absolute gem. It even captures the moment George Lucas himself realise's the movie is not panning out as well as he had hoped. Also included in the extras is a full commentery, deleated scenes, trailers, music video and web-docs (which are also of the highest quality)     In closing, The Phantom Menace IS a deeply flawed movie. Slow, plodding and yes, in places even dull. Much of it is filler and a setting up effort. But it also has moments of pure brilliance and many parts are good or very good. Theres a fascination at seeing the Star Wars universe; BEFORE THE DARK TIMES. This is a film that is about children and for children. Theres a lightness and feeling of innocence that contrasts fantastically to the much, much darker Episode III. Given the time in which the movie was released, itself a moment that could be described as \\"before the darkness\\" you can't help but feel a pang of nostalgia when you watch The Phantom Menace. Even those that hate this film must feel that somewhere?
0312995423|1.0|Let me preface this by saying that I did love \\"DaVinci Code\\" in all its clichéd glory.  Although, I know that \\"The DaVinci Code\\" is far from being a literary masterpiece, it serves its purpose. I was interesting and well researched, and it made me like Dan Brown. Now since I liked \\"the code'\\" and since the copy of \\"Digital Fortress\\" I started to read is my roommate's (whose literary taste I respect), I was expecting to be entertained. I was not.<br /><br />\\"Deja read\\"...A female cryptographer and a college professor! You are kidding, right? One college professor being Indiana Jones, ok Mr. Brown I buy it...but two! (Or I don't know how many books he has written or will write about the same characters) Two! Really?! Last time I checked my college professors, though pretty interesting and smart people, never jumped off planes and headed to Europe to solve life threatening mysteries.<br /><br />Now I know its only a book and its fiction. Blah Blah. So, I'm trying to leave my logic issues behind and I'm trying to allow myself to be caught in the beautiful pages of fiction, but I can't. Why? Well because this book is horribly predictable. I quit. Done. Thank you Mr. Brown, I never quit a book. I quit! But you know what, that makes no difference because I have a pretty good idea how this book goes...Let me sum up what I think happens: both characters are unknowingly working the same case which may or may not damage/strengthen their romantic relationship. They will travel through Europe and will uncover some ancient European mystery. Then the bad guys will mess with them in an attempt to protect some sacred ancient tradition tied into some modern institution. These bad guys will stop at nothing to silence these not so buff but extremely brainy heroes, so that the mystery remains a mystery. In the end the heroes will solve it all with the help of math and history, and will explore their love living happily ever after.ing 7 pages huh?
B00139W3NE|1.0|If you read the book don't see this movie, they did nothing but mutilate it.  I amazed me on how they screwed up the time line, and the characters.  But if you haven't read the book I guess it would be ok, but otherwise don't see it.

B00000K3CK|5.0|This is a wonderful Christmas movie. If you love old movies this is a perfect one to get.
B001AIRUOU|5.0|Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas is returning to DVD, for the first time in anamorphic widescreen, with new special features.  For true fanatics (with the funds), there will also be a limited Ultimate Collector's Edition with a numbered, hand-painted bust of Jack Skellington with his Sandy Claws hat and beard and a sound chip that plays quotes from the movie, a letter of authenticity, a special coffin-shaped box for the bust, a booklet with the Nightmare Before Christmas poem, and an extra disc for the digital copy (not sure what the advantage of that is).  That's listed for pre-order at Amazon ([[ASIN:B001AIRUPE here]]) at roughly a hundred bucks more than this edition.<br /><br />A Blu-ray edition with the same special features as this set plus an exclusive intro by Burton will be released the same day.  The page to pre-order that one is [[ASIN:B001AIRUP4 here]].  (Doesn't look like there's a Blue-ray Ultimate edition.)<br /><br />The Nightmare Before Christmas is the kind of Christmas movie you might expect from Tim Burton (Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands): macabre, sort-of-but-not-too-scary, and ultimately good-humored and good-natured.  It's also quite a feat of animation, the first feature-length stop-action film.  And it's a musical!<br /><br />The story takes place in a world where the magical side of each major holiday is run by a specialized, hidden holiday town, like Santa's North Pole headquarters.  One year, the restless Jack Skellington of Halloween Town discovers Christmas Town, is very impressed, and decides Halloween Town should expand its horizons and take over Christmas that year.  Unfortunately, he and the other residents of his town don't understand Christmas as well as they do Halloween, and their basically well-intentioned efforts threaten to ruin Christmas altogether.<br /><br />The animation is highly imaginative and particularly well suited to the Halloween connections, as we would expect from a Burton-produced project.  The songs, by Danny Elfman, are catchy and fun, partly because of twisted but good-hearted subject matter.  There are scares, adventures, a romance, lessons learned, and a good Christmassy outcome.  Most kids and adults will be delighted, though parents may wish to consider the scary stuff for very young kids who don't like being scared.<br /><br />The new special features are these:<br /><br />-- audio commentary with producer/writer Tim Burton, director Henry Selick and composer Danny Elfman (who also sings in the movie)<br />-- Burton's original \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" poem read by legendary horror actor Christopher Lee<br />-- new intro by Burton for Frankenweenie (see below)<br />-- a digital copy of the movie<br />-- \\"What's This? Jack's Haunted Mansion Holiday Tour,\\" a two-part promo for the Disneyland theme park attraction<br /><br />Features carried over from the 2000 Special Edition:<br /><br />-- \\"The Making of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" (about 25 minutes on the Special Edition)<br />-- \\"The Worlds of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" (the worlds being Halloween Town, Christmas Town, and \\"The Real World\\")<br />-- deleted scenes (scenes that didn't get past the storyboards and cut animated scenes)<br />-- storyboard to film comparison<br />-- theatrical trailers and posters<br />-- Burton's early short stop-action film Vincent, about a boy who dreams of being Vincent Price, who narrates (5:50)<br />-- uncut version of Frankenweenie, Burton's early short live-action film wherein the basic events of Frankenstein are played out in suburban America, with a young boy in the place of Dr. Frankenstein and a pet dog in the place of the monster (29:50)<br /><br />There's no mention in the press release of the old commentary with Selick and director of photography Pete Kozachik, which went into detail about the technical aspects of the animation.  No mention either of the DTS 5.1 sound option included on the Special Edition.  The soundwill be Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround, aspect ratio 1.66:1 (original).<br /><br />Looks like an excellent set.  The video and sound quality of the previous DVD was excellent, and Disney claims the new anamorphic version will be even better.and sound quality of the previous DVD was excellent, and Disney claims the new anamorphic version will be even better.

B0010YSD7M|5.0|As a big Stargate SG-1 fan, along with my son, it would be hard to submit a bad review for this movie. We miss the series and any continuation-movie is greatly anticipated! Worth the money and we can watch it again and again. Only minus is Richard Dean Anderson needs to poke his head in even for a cameo!
B000PFU7OO|5.0|I loved this movie and the music.  There's no sex, drugs or violence.  Its just simply an example of a loving and supportive relationship.  Very gentle, respectful and creative.  The music is hauntingly beautiful.  I dreamed this music two nights in a row and had to buy the download because I couldn't wait for it to come in the mail.    Gentle, loving, and hauntingly beautiful, and ultimately a bit sad.  But absolutely worth it!
B0007PAMR4|4.0|Well after reading several reviews from people who had great intentions and obviously are Dune fans, I have to tell you ... on my copy of this movie which I bought last month(extended version) it also has the original movie on one side of the double sided disk... Boy did I get lucky!!... David Lynch was right not to put his name to the extended version...that being said I am glad I bought this dvd ... it still has great value with the original movie on it... One thing the original has is the flavor if you will of the book... having read the book first there is a mystic quality ... its like reading the bible....there is this general acceptance of events in a mystical fashion that makes the original movie true to the book...if you didn't read the book you may be missing that quality and the extended version might really work for you.    Lord of the Rings was the same way.. there was plenty missing from the book content of the series but Jackson was true to the flavor .. the mystic quality of the books.  We saw the same thing with the movie Wing Commander... Chris Roberts was true to the original writing for the PC games, yet, if you had never played the games you might have looked at the movie from a much different perspective.  The original Dune Movie has this Mystic quality .... the material is doled before you to give you these feelings and the feelings guide you through the story.  This Story is a Messianic journey, a mystical tale, the book reflects that tone and so does the original movie.  Knowing that,had I made the original movie, I certainly would not have put my name on the extended version, however, there are plenty of fans of the original movie that have never read the book!  David Lynch was right!?!  I think it is a matter of perspective.. but, I'm sure glad they put the theatrical edition on the flip side of the disk.. whew!! I gave this 4 stars...I also still play the PC games.. Dune 2(Dos) and Dune 2000 and I loved the book series.[[ASIN:B0007PAMR4 Dune (Extended Edition)]]
159562015X|5.0|The stated goal is to help people do more of what they do well. The author's methods are designed to uncover our key talents via thought patterns, feelings, and behaviors. The patterns are then categorized into 34 broad themes such as Achiever, Relator, and Ideation. The broad themes point to a person's natural talents, which can be further developed. One interesting aspect of the book is that it points out that no amount of training will help a person excel in an area of natural weakness. In fact, it stresses that we cannot do or be anything we choose since we are not good at everything. But if we figure out what our natural talents include and develop those, we can be extraordinary in those areas. The book emphasizes that in business, people enjoy their work and accomplish a lot more if they are doing something for which they have some natural talent.     The author rejects the idea that we can each be anything we want if we just try hard enough. I think the premise has a lot of merit, and there are people who try and try and never succeed and should have moved on to something for which they were naturally inclined. The author advocates putting effort into what you are naturally good at rather than spinning your wheels forever and inevitably failing anyway. Nevertheless, there are plenty of examples where someone dreamed and achieved beyond their natural talent.     I believe that we are not always fully aware of all of our natural talents.  So don't automatically reject pursuing a dream because you may mistakenly believe you lack natural talent and it is therefore beyond your reach.  Sometimes our talents don't emerge or develop until later in life. This is a thought-provoking book in an important area - finding your dreams.  Another book that may also help you find and achieve your goals: [[ASIN:1577315987 Five Wishes: How Answering One Simple Question Can Make Your Dreams Come True]].
0718152433|5.0|Fantastic book From Jamie Oliver!!!! I have been putting his organic farming lessons to good use and am proud to say that I have my first real garden! I love the way he is sooo passionate about his garden and even gives you the dirt on the secret love affair he is having with it behind his wife's back! haha :)     I see that another reviewer didn't like the dead rabbit picture or other game pictures in the book which is interesting because it shows just how far removed we are from the food that we eat. Jamie is trying to change this by getting you closer to what you are putting into your body by using the freshest of ingredients in a seasonal way (that includes fresh meat). The book itself is set up in seasons and has a wonderful variety of offerings for each. (However; if you did happed to catch the Jamie at Home show on the Food Network you will already have seen the majority of these recipes).  They are fantastic recipes though, and I do use them very often. Some cookbooks I buy and they quickly become dust collectors. This one however; is permanently open!    I do highly suggest this book to anyone who cares about good cooking in a fun way and wants to learn a trick or two about organic gardening. It really has helped me reconnect with food in a way that eludes most Americans today. And please...get over the rabbit pics, let me just clue you in to the fact that your fish and chicken don't actually hatch with little Styrofoam containers around them perfectly filleted and ready to cook! Buon Appetito
B00139B39E|4.0|This is a great set, as would be any set by Dream Theater, but for this to be a 5 star release, it would need to be the VERY best of, not just 22 cool songs.    So why isn't it the very best? If you haven't heard much Dream Theater before, this is a great place to start, but for the sake of a review, I'll list off my personal Dream Theater 'Best of' 2 Disk Compilation. Strangely, it is TOTALLY different from the products set. Ultimately, this is a best of set of opinion. And that's what favorite songs come down to. Opinion. So you won't be disappointed with the official release unless Dream Theater turns out to be not for you. Chances are though, you'll like the light side or the dark side alone, if not both. If you're looking for further insight into great Dream Theater songs to get ahold of ahead of, or along with this album or are wondering what select few tracks would be good to start with to get your feet wet, this list of what would be on my own Dream Theater best of will help you out. Note it is entirely different than the actual release. I truly feel these are all superior tracks to what is found here. I give this release 4 stars because no Dream Theater set is a bad one, and the official one up for purchase here is good. It won't dissapoint.    Dream Theater songs better IMO than songs on this set.  [When Dream and Day Unite]  The ones who helped to set the sun  The killing hand    [Images and Words]  Metroplolis (seriously, WHY isn't this on here?)  Wait for sleep (at 2 minutes, they totally could have fit it in there)    [Awake]  Scarred  6-00  Innocence Faded    [Fallling into Infinity]  Speak to me  Anna Lee  Take away my pain    [Scenes from a memory]  Overture 1928  Fatal Tragedy (dear god how is this missing)  Beyond this Life    [Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence]  Blind Faith  The Great Debate  Goodnight Kiss  About to Crash (Reprise)    [Train of Thought]  This Dying Soul  Honor thy Father    [Octavarium]  I walk beside you  The answer lies withinNever Enough  Panic Attack    [Systematic Chaos] (It would have been cool to include one of these to complete a cool 160 minute set)  The Dark Eternal Night  In the prescence of enemies pt1  Repentance    Anyways, you can't go wrong with the official release, but if you want a different take on what is really the 'Best of' Dream Theater, from a fan who has 150 bootlegs of them, find these songs. Start with Metropolis. That would be the best introduction to the band of all. Then get Fatal Tragedy. Third, get 'This dying Soul'. If none of those three songs bring you into the fold, you probably don't like the band.
B001AIRUP4|5.0|I was able to find the information online for this blu ray and figured I'd pass it along.  The original dvd contains Burton's short films such as Vincent and I was glad to see these are also on here along with a ton of new features, nothing appears to be left out.  If you have a blu ray player and like the film I'd say it is worth it to double dip, with those colors popping off the screen at 1080p or hearing kidnap the sandy claws and Danny Elfman's score ([[ASIN:6305216088 Good Will Hunting (Miramax Collector's Series)]]) in the newer sound formats (if your lucky enough to have them).

B00007GZQZ|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies and I cannot understand why it was dissed by critics. A lot of the comedy is slapstick, with collapsing stairs, flying Perdue chickens and \\"weak\\" trees. But in the context of rehabilitating the house, they can get away with it. This is a truly funny movie with none of the grossness that usually passes for comedy in Hollywood. And it is a must see for anybody who has ever rennovated a house. We are currently remodeling our home and use terms from the movie all the time from the \\"Shirk Brothers\\" to \\"anybody call a plumber?\\"
B001A3CP5Y|4.0|It has been 20 years ago since The Traveling Wilburys had formed, and became one of the most surprising groups ever. For Tom Petty, Roy Orbison, the late George Harrison, Bob Dylan and Jeff Lynne of ELO, the opportunity of making great music couldn't be anything but sweet. Yet as time had passed, many record buyers had been looking back and forth seeking to find a copy of the first Traveling Wilburys album, which seemed to be more than met the eye. But that had changed last year when Rhino re-released the 2 Traveling Wilburys records into 1 unique Anthology. Now, for those who just wanted the simplicity of the first one finally have a second chance.<br /><br />The Traveling Wilburys: Volume 1 has finally been re-released in record stores. This new 2008 re-release doesn't seperate itself to those who've bought last years' Traveling Wilburys Anthology, but as a stand alone album, it is worth the wait. All the classics have been remastered from the ground up, and bring back the soulful and classic and simple appeal the 80's group had to so many fans. The album includes the classics Handle With Care, End Of The Line, and Dirty World to just name a few. The album also adds on by bringing in the rare tracks Maxine and Like A Ship, which adds a lot of flavor into the original album. The feeling of the album sounds better than ever for a the 20th Anniversary of this classic.<br /><br />All in all, The Traveling Wilburys: Volume 1 is a great addition to your MP3 Player or for your music library. If you've bought last years' Traveling Wilburys Anthlogy, than there is no need to purchase the 2008 re-release because all the tracks are there. However, if you are into Roy, Tom, and company and haven't yet bought the distinctive album, than it is time to hear this collection, which shows that the history of The Traveling Wilburys isn't over at the end of the line.<br /><br />Album Cover: B+<br /><br />Songs: B 1/2+<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Remastering: B+<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2+
B00005JLWN|5.0|Like all good sci fi, Equilibrium is about the world of today, not tomorrow. How much of our souls are we willing to trade for physical security? As our government continues to strip us of our freedoms in order to \\"protect\\" us, like the Cleric we need to seriously consider what we have lost.<br /><br />When I first saw this film at its first release, I confess that I would have given it only maybe 3 stars. But it has haunted me over the years and when I watched it again just recently I saw so much more in it.<br /><br />And the action sequences, especially the famous Gun Kata, have a terrible beauty.

I did, and not just at that ending.  (People who've watched it know what I mean.)<br /><br />It's a \\"road movie\\" that you're sure to enjoy.
0446402389|4.0|Mr. Smith has a great command of mid 20th century USSR history which alas seems to be returning today for yet another round of cruelty.     The one thing that bothers me is that the reader, based on a stand alone first chapter, figures out the resolution to this thriller way before the super spy does.  It contributes to a deflated ending.    But for his very young age, Mr. Smith has already mastered using history as an accurate reflection of another time.  If we are lucky,  we may hear about the next few chapters in the promised new career of Leo Demidov and his lovely Bride, Raisa.  And it's great to see another young writer who is able to combine creativity with literacy.

B000A6T262|5.0|For years I followed Star Trek.  I think I was initially drawn to the series by Spock's physical appearance (those wonderful slanty eye brows and sexy ears)!  Here's a complete set of all the movies that literally sprang out of the TV series, ...all in one place...easy to get your anxious fingers on & pop into your DVD player...instant gratification.<br /><br />I had to have this set because I'm getting along in years and I find my memories of Star Trek getting fuzzy (\\"IT HAPPENS\\" as Judy DeNutta cites).  At any time of my choosing, I can climb aboard the Star Ship Enterprise, make a salami sandwich in the gally, and sit along side Capt. Kirk and crew, cruising the Universe, going where there is mystery, aliens who remind me of my old boy friends, and whatever else comes down the pike.<br /><br />If you are a \\"Trekie\\", you need this set.  If you don't have this set, you are not a true \\"trekie\\", and your identification with Star Trek is fraudulent!  Amazon can save you.  Order the set NOW!  Thanks for reading the rantings of an old Trekie.  Live well and prosper.

B0015ODDUY|1.0|As soon as I bought my Kindle, I started looking for some of my all-time favorite books and references.  When I found this, I said \\"80 cents, what a deal!\\"<br /><br />Well, it's no deal.  First, this is a poor translation; it has little poetry or flow.  Second, it was obviously created by scanning a text.  The number of spelling errors is staggering.  Couldn't these people download a free spell-checker from the Internet?<br /><br />I would love to give it \\"zero stras\\"  (0 stars) but one is as low as you can go.  Try one of the other Kindle editions instead.<br /><br />I have to agree with another Kindle reviewer: Amazon should do some basic review of these texts and eliminate the rip-offs.  I would be happy to help.
B0016HNOXQ|3.0|I was a fan of Portishead back in the day (90's) and think their first album \\"Dummy\\" is basically perfect. Second CD \\"Portishead\\" is also wonderful . . . so I've been waiting 10+ years for \\"Third.\\" That's a lot for a work of music to live up to. Okay, so it's not perfect . . . but enjoyable nonetheless. Just doesn't grab me the way their earlier work did.
1592332803|4.0|I like this book alot. I found the ones with fruit or veg work the best. The choc cake wont work for me i have tried 4 times. may be because we have australian mesurements ?? not sure. went back to my own recepie for that one.   I bought this for my daughter as she has an egg and nut allergy.The only problem was that the book has come apart already. The binding is not good.     However the carrot cake is the best even my egg eating friends love it and say it's the best ever!!. we just didn't put in the nuts.   Over all pretty happy and love all the pics!!!  t
B000002OX7|5.0|Throughout the 1960's the Who were basically a singles band with the notable exceptions of \\"A Quick One While He's Away,\\" supposed theme album \\"The Who Sell Out\\" and, of course, \\"Tommy.\\"  The latter's success would force the group to stay together when bassist John Entwistle and drummer Keith Moon had debated forming a group called Led Zeppelin with Jimmy Page (this fact perhaps leading to Who guitarist Pete Townshend's outspoken resentment of that venerable act).  Further success with \\"Live At Leeds\\" would lead the band into the studio once again to commence work on yet another Townshend theme album titled \\"Lifehouse.\\"  While \\"Lifehouse\\" failed to reach fruition during the Who's lifetime, many of the songs from that project formed the nucleus for one of the group's greatest achievements: \\"Who's Next.\\"    With \\"Who's Next,\\" the Who would enter the world of AOR as well as provide themselves with sure crowd pleasures along the lines of \\"Baba O'Riley,\\" \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\" and \\"Won't Get Fooled Again.\\"  This being more than an ample enough amount of \\"hits\\" for the traditional album of the period, the group would continue to provide meaningful listening with \\"Bargain,\\" \\"Love Ain't For Keeping\\" and \\"Getting In Tune.\\"  Even Entwistle's humorous \\"My Wife\\" and Townshend's bouncy \\"Going Mobile\\" maintain the pace of high caliber material on this, the group's finest hour as a working unit.    The Who would continue to make music into the 1970's, on through the untimely death of drummer Moon, eventually disbanding in the early 1980's before surviving members Roger Daltrey, Entwistle and Townshend revived the act--minus Moon replacement Kenny Jones of the Small Faces--until Entwistle's own unexpected demise at the turn of the century.    Outside of greatest hits packages \\"Meaty, Beaty, Big And Bouncy\\" and \\"Hooligans,\\" this is the one definitive Who album to have in your rock and roll arsenal.  The later release of a double-disc CD set provides some interesting alternate takes, butnothing to rival the pure energy of the original album.
B000IU3XTM|3.0|Damien Rice set the bar ridiculously high with his 2004 release, O. On his debut, there was incredible production and amazing sounds coming out of every track. While the follow up to O, also a single character title, 9, is a solid album, fans expecting the artistic saturation found on O will be somewhat disappointed. While Damien Rice's song writing is solid, his voice is great and the lyrics provide good images, we don't get anything like the backwards singing on \\"Cold Water,\\" or the clinking glasses on the drunken \\"Cheers, Darling,\\" or the raw emotion so direly expressed in \\"The Blower's Daughter\\" or \\"I Remember\\" or the Sweedish opera singing on \\"Eskimo.\\" Instead we hear Rice producing an album that is more straight-ahead and with fewer layers. There's more electric instrumentation on this record as well, leaving fans thirsty for the acoustic tranquility of O as well. Don't get me wrong though, it's a pretty good album and if this were Rice's debut, it would probably score 4 stars or maybe even a 5. However, those of us wanting something equal to or greater than O will be a little confused by 9. It's still worth the money, but don't get your hopes up. Personally, I'll forgive Damien for a little sophomore slump and anxiously await his next release.
B000003BF1|5.0|Throughout the 1960's the Rolling Stones were basically a singles band who either felt compelled to or were urged by their manager to serve as the antithesis to the Beatles while simultaneously parodying their rivals' releases.  Consider the sheer blatancy of \\"Their Satanic Majesties Request,\\" the cover art of \\"Beggars Banquet\\" and, now, the title \\"Let It Bleed\\" juxtaposed with \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,\\" \\"The Beatles (aka the White Album)\\" and \\"Let It Be.\\"  Thankfully, with the Beatles' demise and Stones' manager Andrew Loog Oldham's departure, the group would begin to be more original until the late 1970's when they began to once again hop on the bandwagons of the day, be they punk, disco, etc. with the notable exception of the fantastic \\"Some Girls.\\"     Long before that album, though, and shortly before the almost equally amazing \\"Sticky Fingers\\" comes \\"Let It Bleed,\\" where the Stones enter the world of AOR as well as provide themselves with sure crowd pleasures along the lines of \\"Gimme Shelter,\\" \\"Midnight Rambler\\" and \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want.\\"  This being more than an ample enough amount of \\"hits\\" for the traditional album of the period, the group would continue to provide meaningful listening with \\"Love In Vain,\\" \\"Live With Me\\" and \\"Let It Bleed.\\"  Gram Parsons influenced take on \\"Country Honk\\" would round out a fantastic A-side to the original album, while Keith Richards' \\"You Got The Silver\\" keeps up with the high quality material on this, the group's farewell to their first golden era, brought about by the untimely passing of founding member Brian Jones, who is only present on two cuts from this album, but is clearly represented by the fallen blonde figure on top of the cake.  Jones had, in fact, been fired from the group by this point, but was not expected to die so soon afterwards.    The Stones would continue to make music into the 1970's, through personnel changes of Jones' replacement Mick Taylor for Small Faces guitarist Ronnie Wood, eventually disbanding in the mid 1980's before coming back with a vengeance at the close of the decade and bassist Bill Wyman's ultimate resignation from the group.    Along with greatest hits package \\"Hot Rocks\\" and the aforementioned \\"Sticky Fingers\\" and \\"Some Girls,\\" this is a definite Stones album to have in your rock and roll collection.
1594489505|3.0|Similar to The Kite Runner, Hosseini's latest novel deals with illegitimate children in an Afghanistan reeling from turmoil and change. This time, Hosseini focuses on the female perspective by recounting the lives of Miriam, an illegitimate daughter of a wealthy cinema owner and business man, and a woman named Laila, whose parents are killed in a rocket attack. Both women, in the span of 18 years, end up married to Rasheed, a shoemaker who ends up beating them both relentlessly. The women try to escape from their husband's rule. All of this takes place against the backdrop of the Soviet Union leaving Afghanistan and the subsequent Taliban takeover.     I ended up reading this book incredibly quickly, as the prose and the pacing is well done. You really do fly through everything. But what bothered me about the book was the same thing that bothered me about Kite Runner - everything seemed like it was written by someone who wanted to provide a perfectly balanced story that had to end in a somewhat neat package. Both of Hosseini's books, although filled with tragedy, telegraph the redemption that saves the newest generation. I can understand the desire to end on a hopeful note, but there is something too artificial about the way that Hosseini goes about executing his vision.     Overall, this is a decent read, but one that does not live up to his previous outing.     A Quote:    \\"In that week, Laila came to believe that of all the hardships a person had to face, none was more punishing than the simple act of waiting.\\"
0786838655|5.0|this book is the second best book that i have ever read. the first is the new and latest book in this series called The battle of the labyrinth. it has imaginative characters and one of the best plots ever. theres my ten cents. by the way                                                                                                                                                            READ THIS BOOK
B000M53GQS|3.0|..those darn loudness wars even ruined what would be a great 2-fer set. I have not even heard the first disc (City to City) since I immediately went for the second disc (Night Owl).. horrendous mastering, and no, this recording is not remastered... one listen to beginning of \\"The Tourist\\" and you hear all the clipping and flutter. I saved the disc on my computer and used a noise shaper to soften the harshness of the tracks and a regain tool to somehow lessen the clipping. It worked! DBpowerAMP is a great tool to use. But back to the CD. You may be disappointed in the mastering as I was, but it beats an old beat up cassette that seemed to be eaten by my tape player more than once.   I can't figure out why re-release of City to City since the prior CD release was nicely remastered. This was the second release I bought on the \\"Collectibles\\" record label. The first was a reissue of Barnes and Barnes debut, I expected less that high fidelity on that one, but this one I was expecting more or less a pristine recording without having to do the work myself.
0679879269|2.0|Magical! Provocative! Inspired! Genius On Paper! Crap!    I was totally swept away into the worlds of His Dark Materials, and then half way through The Amber Spyglass, I lost it.    (WARNING! This will contain spoilers!)    It was as if Phillip Pullman set down his pin and let a much more incapable person finish up. So many story plots were left unfinished, untouched. There is SO MUCH stigma and story and expectation about the subtle knife and how it is a \\"god killer\\", but it is just dropped and becomes pointless. The authority gets taken out by a breeze!    What ever happened to the betrayal of Asirel? He kills Lyra's friend, in a most cruel way, and then goes on a holy crusade of sorts... And Mrs. Coulter, in The Subtle Knife, seems to be bent on killing Lyra, and if I'm not mistaken plans to do so, then in the Spyglass she is trying to protect her... Make up my mind for me!    Lyra's \\"choice\\" and Eve like fate, due to Mary's temptation, which is a huge plot point in the first two books is almost totally passes over in 2 paragraphs, and is nothing as dramatic as the other books seem to make it out to be. I thought Lyra was \\"destined to bring about the end of destiny,\\" and that she was going to be the new Eve. Pullman seems to have an interesting interpretation of the story of Eve at any rate.    The obvious solution to Will and Lyra's problem of staying together is not even discussed. If the angles can deal with the specters that have been created every time a window is opened (which is also a week explanation), why can't they deal with the few specters that would be created for Will and Lyra to remain together?     There are several more instances where this book falls short of the bar raised in the first two in the series, but for the sake of going into a full out rant, I will simply say this, Pullman should not have raised such a high level of expectation. I burned through the first two books because I was totally enveloped in the story, and I found myself begging for more, but what I got was a total disappointment, and if there were any kind of legal precedent for suing an author for my money back for the cost of the book and the length of time it took me to read the story I would.
B0018CWEYY|3.0|I love LOSt and think this season was as good as it's ever been. However, as we are receiving a third less episodes in this set than we have in the previous three, why can't they knock 33% off the price as well?? I get really irritated with the inconsistencies of TV shows on DVD (1/2 seasons of Entourage for full price??? 10 30 minute episodes of Curb Your enthusiasm cost more than 25 episodes of The Office??).<br /><br />So, I know I'm going off on a tangent a bit but I feel compeleed to gripe that fewer episodes should be reflected in the cost!
B00005JPNZ|1.0|BELIEVE ALL THE NEGATIVES FOR THIS ABOMINATION AND BETRAYAL OF THE INDY SERIES. MONEY IS THE ONE TRUE GOD FOR THESE FILMAKERS AND THEIR ONLY JUSTIFICATION FOR TURNING OUT THIS TRAIN WRECK. THEY COULD NOT LEAVE WELL ENOUGH ALONE AND JUST HAD TO DESTROY WHAT WAS A LEGENDARY LEGACY OF FUN AND ADVENTURE. EVERYTHING ABOUT THE PRODUCTION REEKS...STORY, SCRIPT, ACTING, STUNTS, EFFECTS...etc. NO THOUGHT, NO ORIGINALITY, NO INSPIRATION, NO MAGIC...NO RESPECT FOR THE ART OF FILM THEY ONCE ELEVATED. IF YOU LOVED THE SERIES, AVOID THIS INSULT TO THE GENRE WITH EXTREME PREJUDICE. THERE IS NO OTHER WAY TO LET A TAINTED HOLLYWOOD RUN AMOK KNOW THAT THERE ARE STILL SOME INTELLIGENT PATRONS AMONGST A MORONIC MOVIE GOING PUBLIC FOR WHOM THIS WAS MADE. A SAD SAD END TO FINE SERIES. IF YOU WANT TO PLAY MAKE BELIEVE, PRETEND THIS FILM DOES NOT EXIST...CLOSE YOUR EYES AND MAYBE IT WILL GO AWAY.
B00003CXGG|4.0|Nothing spectacular to add, just that the movie is fun to watch... especially Jet Li's fight scenes.  Also a tribute to Aaliya - she showed promise. Plot was pretty tried and true - acting average to good.  Fight scenes, not overly realistic but lots of fun!    If you missed out on this movie somehow... I recommend!    All the best,    Jay
B000001FYL|4.0|Stripped down a bit, a lot more \\"earthy,\\" Jon Bon Jovi's \\"Young Guns II\\" album is a nice breakaway from his efforts with the band that bears his name.  Fans of Bon Jovi, however, will find plenty to enjoy in this album.  For starters, the raucous \\"You Really Got Me Now,\\" has an excellent \\"jam session\\" feel to it.  \\"Miracle\\" and \\"Never Say Die\\" give the listener a light dose of what made Bon Jovi tunes like \\"Born To Be My Baby\\" so much fun to listen to.  Then there are tunes like \\"Blood Money\\" and \\"Bang A Drum\\" that herald the coming Americana sound that Bon Jovi would play more of with their later albums.<br /><br />Last but certainly not least, \\"Blaze of Glory\\" sounds like a hairband tune soaked in whiskey and left out over night.  It's the highlight track on the album and it alone makes this one worthy of purchase.  Also included is Alan Silvestri's \\"Guano City,\\" a passable track from the score of the film.<br /><br />Overall, this is definitely a keeper for fans of Bon Jovi or anybody who enjoys grittier rock.  Recommended.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|I liked this film a lot. Richard Curtis has put together a fine film, showing the foibles of human nature, and the characters' reactions. I laughed often, reflected softly, and ultimately thought it is a treasure among those films that talk about \\"love\\". The stellar cast handles the material well, especially Bill Nighy, the over-the-hill rock singer. Liam Neeson, Hugh Grant, Laura Linney, Emma Thompson, and Colin Firth are all excellent.  It's very episodic, and the episodes with Mr. Firth are especially sweet. \\"Love Actually\\" won many awards, worldwide, but was ignored by the Academy. I laughed often, reflected quite a bit, and was allowed to put myself in touch with these wonderful characters. ALL love, or infatuation, is an enigma, and the \\"porn\\" couple really put it in perspective. I loved those two. Also, Neeson's son (I don't know his name) is one of the best kid-actors I've seen in a long time. It's a good ride, and loads of fun. Check it out!
B000WMFZMY|5.0|Very good movie , the second time ihave seen it since it was first released..
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|I love Jane Austen and this portrayal is packed with beautiful scenery and people, but after listening to the soundtrack I realized that's what I loved so much about the movie.  Unlike so many soundtracks out there, this work really stands alone, taking on a life beyond the movie.  I've bought it as a gift for anyone who loves beautiful music and I rate it as my favorite album of the year!
B00000JSJC|5.0|I enjoyed this film a lot.. although not many fans of \\"Drug\\" movies will tag it as such.. but it's a very good thriller with lots of twists and turns.    =)
B000YXMMAE|5.0|It took me a while to warm-up to this album. I was at Bonnaroo in 2006 when they debuted most of it in what I thought were the bare-boned stripped-down versions, so I had a pretty good idea of what was ahead. Upon listening to it for the first time I found myself waiting for more sound in each cut. But after a few months I think that's what Radiohead were aiming at. This album is non-pretentious, simple yet elegant, and shows a more adult side of the band. As the band members enter middle-age, it is refreshing to see their music mature along with them. (It's also fun that they are my age so we can all grow old together :)Thom's voice is astonishing as always, and each individual band member's influence is heard throughout the album - they are so good together it just makes you sick to your stomach. The melodies are beautiful, sad, haunting, and yes, they do still know how to lay down some mad guitar! Well worth the long wait - this album will not disappoint. Now...when is their next album due to be released?
B00164KYS2|4.0|I am a huge fan of the SATC series and have eagerly awaited the release of this movie. It does not disappoint! The girls are back and better than ever. The chemistry between the friends is as it ever was - magical. I laughed and cried and felt every emotion on the screen in my heart. I have some little issues with the movie's final scenes but perfection (as was the series finale) can be difficult to achieve twice. So, stop reading reviews and get to the theater!!
B0013FNC38|5.0|If you like Jason Mraz AT ALL you will love this CD. Unlike Mr. A-Z, it has more of a flow to it, and the duet \\"Lucky\\" is fantastic!!! :)  I think this album has a sort of beach/surf feel to it and would be a great pick-me-up disc--and a great addition for a summer collection. :)
B000005ZGZ|5.0|The problem with picking a favorate album by Fuguzi is that each time you listen to one of their records, it BECOMES your favorate. \\"Kill Taker\\" is probably the quintessenal Fuguzi album: it fuses their blasting punk with their brilliant experments, with amazing results.    But End Hits is more suited to my taste. The band is loud as ever, but they remind me just as much of Captian Beefheart as they do Minor Threat here. They use hardcore textures, but only as a framework to play with  layered guitars, shiffting time signatures,  creepy vocal experments, and wierd electrtonic utterances. They are constantly locking together for insane rhtyms, scraping amazingly controlled feedback out of their amps and mics, and adding codas to songs when you least expect them. It is like walking a dark house and having monsters pop out when you are off gaurd. This is art rock painted on a hardcore canvas.    This band also REALLY knows how to use a studio. They have this knack for making increadibly layered, intercate music, while allowing it to sound live and spontainious. They must spend hours getting all the amps and microphones in just the right place, to get just the right depth. The result is that even their off the cuff noises are as rich as other bands layered overdubs.     The music is frightening, dark, thick and completely uncommerical. All the songs are fully realized, and the experments always work. The intensity never lets up but there are musical surprises everywhere. To be honest, you have probably not heard much like this. I sure as hell haven't.     Strongly Reccomended.
B000W91RUG|5.0|Wow just great to see the geeks in action!!!    Love this comedy. The best at this moment!!!
B000BJ7C6K|5.0|the first true \\"help somebody out\\" concert album ever, organized by george & his friends. good job, george. excellent music, especially giving ringo such a wonderful song to sing forever! glad so many of us gave to your worthy cause. hope you're enjoying heaven. surely, that's where you are now due to your kindness.
0689865384|5.0|Devour is not nearly appropriate enough for how I read this book. I nearly inhaled this fast-paced story, and could never have hoped to put it down before I finished it.    The premise may have been done before, but Scott Westerfeld breaths new life into the idea, and markets it to the fertile minds of Young Adults who can use it.     Tally lives in a gorgeously complex dystopia, set in a future that seems all to far off and yet at the same time all to near, that appears very simple up front. 'At the age of 16, you get a surgery to become beautiful', what could possibly be wrong with that? Everything. This novel (and subsequent ones) explore the darker natures of humanity about how far one is willing to go to remain an individual, when everyone else is screaming \\"Conform!\\"
B000YABYLA|4.0|When I first heard about JUNO, I had some mixed feelings about venturing to see this film solely because of the fact that it's about a pregnant teenager.  There are so many elements here that makes this movie likeable and it could have ventured into something depressing, but it didn't.    Diablo Cody should get some kudos for grasping the concept of how the quirky yet outcast teenager acts nowadays.  The writing for this is simplistic, but it's Ellen Page's portrayal of Juno that knocks the movie out of the ballpark.  She played Juno with a lot of heart and sarcasm and almost accepting of her situation.      What was wonderful about this film was the fact that each of the actors and their relationships evolved for a reason.  Michael Cera's portrayal of (Paulie Bleeker) was one of bewilderment and confusion over the fact that Juno was pregnant.  How would a teenage boy act if he got his girlfriend accidentally pregnant?  That was about as realistic as it comes.  Jennifer Garner did an amazing job of playing her role as well as a woman who was in desperate need of family and wanted to have a child at all costs and it was refreshing to see her play a character that wasn't an action character, but a character with a lot of heart and she showed a lot of range that she has never had in the roles that have been given to her.  Jason Bateman coming to the realization with his character was great as well.  Jason and Jennifer complimented each other as it was a real situation that they were able to deal with.      Overall, the film makes light of a serious subject and it all wraps it up like a bow the end result.  It may not be a result that everyone is going to be happy with, but it was a result that made sense nonetheless and connected each character to each other for life.
B000YABYLA|3.0|I first heard about Juno when I read about its popularity at the 2007 Toronto Film Festival. The story, upon first read, about a smart-ass teenager who finds herself pregnant and faced with the challenge of how to handle it, did not impress me. It wasn't a storyline that captivated my imagination or my intellectual curiosity. So I wondered. Why did this film keep receiving adulation from just about every movie reviewer under the sun? Rotten Tomatoes had a multitude of positive reviews with a few negatives ones sprinkled in. I decided I wasn't going to fall for the media circus surrounding this picture and would wait for it to come out on DVD.<br /><br />Now I have written screenplays before so I believe I can be quite critical from a screenwriter's standpoint given that I know what is involved when crafting a screenplay. Let's first review the movie:<br /><br />Juno tells the story of a 16 year old girl, sarcastic, smart and a bit too cocky for her own good as she finds out right at the start of the film that she is pregnant after having casual sex with her highschool boyfriend, Paulie Bleeker. Once Juno finds that she's pregnant, she informs her best girlfriend and they discuss what exactly she should do. Juno then breaks the news to her parents. Her parents give her the OK for an abortion ( a tad too cavalier in my opinion). Juno attempts the abortion route but gets cold feet. She then decides to give her baby up for adoption. She places an ad in the local paper and identifies a lovely wealthy couple who want to adopt. Will things go smoothly for Juno? How will she respond once she gives birth?<br /><br />For starters, this basic plot outline doesn't do much for me. I'm not intrigued by it and my curiosity has not been peaked. If I read the logline of this script it would not be one of my first reads. But let's begin to analyze this picture.<br /><br />Now I realize that each and every family on this planet is different. Parents are not the same all over when it comes to their emotional reactions. Juno's parents know very well the sharp-tongued verbal antics of their daughter (mother shown is actually step-mother to Juno) so one would take that into consideration. However, the reaction by both parents to Juno's admission of pregnancy is so calculated and without serious emotion that it begs the question, what kinds of parents are these people and would they actually exist in real life or are they just a caricature created by screenwriter Diablo Cody? One has to seriously ask this question because once Juno decides to initially opt for abortion wouldn't she at least bring one of her parents to go with her? Juno ends up visiting the abortion clinic alone! What kind of parent would send their teenager alone to an abortion clinic to get an abortion? It begs all credulity! I bring this up because it strikes at the very premise of Diablo Cody's smartly penned dialogue. These characters are indeed fictitious with not a shred of relevance to an actual family faced with the challenge of raising a \\"know it all\\" teenager.<br /><br />Once Juno enters the abortion clinic, the director tries to show how uncomfortable Juno is inside it by focusing on strange sounds the various people are making inside, (i.e. such as nail filing). The woman at the abortion clinic front desk appears to incongruous to say the least. No abortion clinic I've ever heard about or visited would ever feature such a character at the front desk. Again, this character was created by Diablo as a way to entertain the audience but at the same time \\"creep\\" Juno out from actually having an abortion.<br /><br />Let's discuss Juno's boyfriend, played by Michael Cera. The on-screen chemistry between Michael and Ellen Page (who plays Juno) is good but nothing to write home about. This is mainly due to the meekness of Michael Cera's character. They are such opposites that again, it strains credulity to think that a sarcastic \\"know it all\\" like Juno would be attracted to such anintrovert like Michael Cera's character. I'm not saying it couldn't happen but Michael's character is bland, boring and dull.<br /><br />The two parents who consider adopting Juno's child, Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman, are played well and I don't have any real criticism for either character. Both actors perform well and the twist that Diablo Cody includes in their relationship provides for the drama that occurs later.<br /><br />I've come to the conclusion that the reason why this film gained such popularity is two: People were delightfully stunned by the crisp, back and forth repartee between characters (courtesy of Diablo Cody's sharply penned dialogue); the overall fine acting by all of the cast; and finally, audiences like movies where everything is taken into account and there are no serious questions left to ponder. Juno nicely wraps up by the end of the film and you're left with nothing more to ruminate on. At least I didn't.<br /><br />But as a screenwriter, I'm here to tell you that in cinema, if you want respect from a screenwriter, you've got to inject some plausibility into your screenplay! (Unless you're writing an action/adventure film like Rambo or a superhero film like Iron Man)<br /><br />Juno, as a drama/comedy, has no plausibility. Audiences who saw this film were simply looking to be entertained and they did not approach this film with the background of a screenwriter. But great dialogue does NOT MAKETH a GREAT MOVIE. Great dialogue ELEVATES a good story. But I can't say that Juno is even a good story. I'm not sure what is \\"good\\" about it especially when it treats one of the most polarizing topics in the United States (abortion) with such triteness!<br /><br />I've read interviews with Diablo Cody about how she came to write Juno, and what I found most interesting is that she focused more on the dialogue of her story than anything else. And in many ways, she had to! The story in and of itself, as it is presented on screen, is boring. It does not stimulate and it does not provoke. If the dialogue had fallen flat in this picture, Juno would not even have ranked a blip at the Toronto film festival. Now Juno COULD have been more stimulating a picture, if the issue of abortion had been delved upon much more in depth. But then that would have changed the point of the story.

Yes, Ellen Page does a masterful job of capturing the character of Juno. I actually hope to see her star some day in better films than Juno as she is obviously a capable actress. Time will tell. What I took from this picture was that audiences like films where everything is resolved by the end of the story and the lead character rides off into the sunset. Audiences enjoy seeing films that don't provoke and merely entertain. Audiences want to forget about \\"reality\\" and see a film that describes another world far removed from the one they are living in.t saying it couldn't happen but Michael's character is bland, boring and dull.    The two parents who consider adopting Juno's child, Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman, are played well and I don't have any real criticism for either character. Both actors perform well and the twist that Diablo Cody includes in their relationship provides for the drama that occurs later.    I've come to the conclusion that the reason why this film gained such popularity is two: People were delightfully stunned by the crisp, back and forth repartee between characters (courtesy of Diablo Cody's sharply penned dialogue); the overall fine acting by all of the cast; and finally, audiences like movies where everything is taken into account and there are no serious questions left to ponder. Juno nicely wraps up by the end of the film and you're left with nothing more to ruminate on. At least I didn't.    But as a screenwriter, I'm here to tell you that in cinema, if you want respect from a screenwriter, you've got to inject some plausibility into your screenplay! (Unless you're writing an action/adventure film like Rambo or a superhero film like Iron Man)    Juno, as a drama/comedy, has no plausibility. Audiences who saw this film were simply looking to be entertained and they did not approach this film with the background of a screenwriter. But great dialogue does NOT MAKETH a GREAT MOVIE. Great dialogue ELEVATES a good story. But I can't say that Juno is even a good story. I'm not sure what is \\"good\\" about it especially when it treats one of the most polarizing topics in the United States (abortion) with such triteness!    I've read interviews with Diablo Cody about how she came to write Juno, and what I found most interesting is that she focused more on the dialogue of her story than anything else.

1577314808|5.0|This book will teach you why you shouldn't worry so much about every day life and help you achieve your goals by make you concentrate on what you have to do right now in order to reach your goal and not worry about of the future if you will reach your goal or not which would take your concentration off the work.  Highly recomended.
B00190OHD6|4.0|I enjoyed this one(though I love most romance movies) more than usual. Mainly because most of the movie is not about some girl trying to get some relationship (girl and boy meet through some miracle, attraction, fight and get back together...). What she goes through and how coaches her through the grief is awesome and even though the result is not (like usually) immediate she ends up finding her way.
B00005JPNY|4.0|I found the movie enjoyable along with the special effects.  After seeing the movie I read which the book and watched the movie again which helped make sense to any gaps in the movie.  The book is of course much better however I did enjoy seeing the characters brought to life.
B000002JB8|5.0|It's funny to read other reviews that complain that the CD didn't \\"take off\\" or that it \\"put them to sleep\\". For me, that's the beauty of this piece of music. It's absolutely beautiful!      It may seem odd to write a review so many years after a release, but this review is being submitted to verify that some music does stand the test of time. Music serves many purposes in my life and obviously this is not a disc I would play at the gym or night club. We are talking sleepy-time here. We're talking wine and headphones, relaxation! Seriously, I sometimes put a CD on at bedtime and like many others I enjoy drifting off to music. There's nothing worse than being on the edge of REM sleep and having the next track ruin the trip. But this is not just ambient nonsense, without structure or complexity. This disc is absoultely amazing and unlike some of the horn blazing synth sounds Vangelis produced years ago. Don't misunderstand me, I enjoyed that too, but I've realized over the past few years that I keep coming back to this one CD, over and over again, year after year. It's probably played on my player more than any other CD ever. ( since I usually try to sleep every night or so) The tracks are layered, lush, calming and beautiful. The ocean waves and the voices bring to mind undersea reefs and tropical island paradises. After all these years I still appreciate this piece of work and wonder how Vangelis did it. So if you want to escape, relax and or drift off on a beautiful journey, this is your CD. But beware, you might be asleep before the last track.
B000UR9T8C|3.0|***Minor spoilers***<br /><br />The third movie in the Spider-man series is not terrible (unless you truly think it was, but this is my turn). However, it tries to be much more than it is. For instance, the first movie had the Green Goblin. The second movie had Doc Oc. This outing has three--count 'em---three villains.<br /><br />Of course, this depends on the way you count the villains. One starts bad but turns good at the last minute. One starts of not \\"good\\" but aligned with Spider-man, then turns on him after being forcibly rejected. And one is presented as the escape convict with the misguided heart of gold.<br /><br />That being said, with so many villains whose story needs to be told, the story of Spider-man 3 ends up just feeling too rushed. There's too much story to be told here.<br /><br />My personal preference, if they insisted on making a movie with Venom, would actually be to present the symbiote in this movie, merged with Spider-man only. Then, after Peter realized what it was doing to him, he'd ditch it at the end of the movie, and end on the shot of Eddie Brock getting attacked/assimilated by the symbiote just before the fade-to-black, indicating that Venom would be the main villain of the fourth movie. (Similar to Harry finding his father's Goblin lair at the end of movie 2.)<br /><br />But that's just me.<br /><br />In the end, this movie was a missed opportunity that tried to be too much.
B000BNX4MC|5.0|I'm sorry, with all due respect to the reviewer, Mr. Simanton, I thoroughly disagree with his review.  My kids love the movie as much as I did, back when it came out, there is no loss of effervescence in our home.  This movie is one of all time favourites of my older two children, who are 17 and 8.  The soda bottle is still fine here, thank you.
B00005JKCH|4.0|An origin movie that doesn't feel like it. Obviously, they had to show how Peter became Spiderman, but that doesn't have to take the whole movie, as we can clearly see. In fact, one of the things that really works here is that the origin of the hero and the origin of the villain are both developed as fast as they can and at the same time. The audience doesn't feel rushed at all in the process, and you may not even notice at first that the Goblin is created the very same night as Spiderman. Each wakes up a new man and then sets out to get to know their new abilities.<br /><br />Some of the Goblin's lines are hackneyed (\\"We'll meet again, Spiderman!\\") but with Dafoe's delivery, you can see the theatrical megalomania as a natural part of the character. A few of the effects using CG characters could use a bit more polish to make them feel real, but they thankfully use real actors whenever realistically possible.<br /><br />On the whole, there are a few missteps here, but mainly on the technical aspect, which doesn't truly detract from the story. It is largely personal preference whether you prefer the first or the second in this series, but it's hard to say that this first outing was anything but a success.
B001AEF6BI|1.0|Yeah, I know I'll receive flak for this, but I just don't care.  This double-dipping has got to stop.  FOR YEARS we've been asking for an s.e. of this film.  And this isn't good enough.  As the other reviewer says, this doesn't SEEM to have the \\"deleted scenes\\" released on TV (usually used to replace racier or more violent scenes on a TV broadcast, see the 4 disc edition of Superman (1977) as an example of re-cutting these scenes into a movie).  Why waste your money when they'll just trot out another edition in a few years?
B0014KD46W|4.0|Hi. I've been a fan of Steve Winwood's since I was 8 or 9. The Spencer Davis Group was one of the first albums I ever bought.<br />I LOVED Traffic; loved Blind Faith...<br />After that he seemed to lose his way. It seemed that he had \\"devolved\\" to utilizing the \\"flavor of the month\\" (musical) philosophy .<br />Now, before all you folks who loved \\"Arc of the Diver\\" go nuts on me, it just wasn't the gritty Steve Winwood I'd come to love. It was synths that (now) seem terribly dated in the voices that were used ( as is much of the music from the 80's), and his style- his persona was submerged or hidden by all this...\\"stuff\\".<br />Now, he's found his way back! This album is wonderful! Note: I've given 4 rather than 5 stars only because the writing on a couple of songs in the middle of the CD are not his best...But they still very VERY good! It's gritty, and mature and pure Winwood!<br />I hadn't realized just how much I'd missed his sound, his soul, his ideas!<br />This is a WONDERFUL Re-INTRODUCTION to a seminal artist & I recommend this to anyone who is looking for real, soulful tunes that harken back to  his best days, his best musical endeavours!<br />Buy it! You won't be sorry!
B000MRAAJW|3.0|I love watching Nature, Cosmos, and other documentary type programs. This one was so hyped up, I perhaps expected too much. This program was lauded for its wonderful photography, etc, but so far I haven't found it to be unusual.  I gave it an average rating, as it simply didn't hold my interest, and the photography is average for this day and age.

B0017KP93U|5.0|I did and its 256 KBS the songs have been remastered dont give money to EMI Thom and the guys didn't want this compilation to happen but its good for the older songs (especially from Pablo Honey) the remastering is really clean...even on idioteque things sound cleaner. if that makes any sense and i dont really think that needed to be done...but you know how record companies LOVE to remaster everything they get their hands on. RADIOHEAD IS THE BEST LIVE BAND EVER THANKS TO THEIR DALLAS SHOW A FEW WEEKS AGO!
B000EHQTZO|5.0|Can you imagine being a teenage kid, or even an adult, back in 1933 when this classic first hit the movie theaters; sitting there staring up at the big screen and watching this wonderful movie, which I'm sure more than a few people in the audience proclaimed as being the greatest adventure story they've ever seen in their lives.<br />Little did those people know that 75 years later KING KONG would still be unmatched in its cinematic greatness, or in it's ability to enthrall and delight the observer.<br />KING KONG is non-stop action from beginning to end, featuring great acting, great writing, great theater, and great special effects.<br />It also features the greatest heavyweight fight in cinematic history, when Kong and the T-Rex go at it for one round.<br />Also, there's just something about the Black and White format in which this picture was shot, and I believe that that in itself lends a lot to this movies timeless appeal.<br />Carl Denham: the guy who is always behind the camera in the movie, also utters one of the classic--and overlooked lines--in Hollywood history, when he refuses the African Chieftans offer to trade 6 native girls for 'the golden woman', stating under his breath that \\"Blonds are scarce around here.\\" That line cracks me up every time I hear it, and I've heard it a hundred times.<br />KING KONG is truly a delight to watch, and any parent who wants to share a truly memorable movie watching experience with their movie loving offspring, owes it to their child to turn them on to this movie.<br />Yes, it was \\"Beauty killed the beast,\\" but this movie will live forever.<br />The King is dead... yet he'll outlive us all. Long live the King of all adventure movies.
B00168ML1G|5.0|I'm not a comic book fan at all. So I know about Spiderman, Superman and Batman, but I know nothing of some of the \\"minor\\" superheroes that end up starring in big budget motion pictures. I know nothing about Iron Man's origin, the villians, and all of the backstory that go into the universe he lives in. Is the movie, IRON MAN, a movie I could enjoy when I don't know about or really care about Iron Man? The answer is YES. Bases on box office returns and great reviews, the public loved this movie. The critics got this one right. This really is a good movie.<br /><br />The strength of the movie starts with the cast. You have Oscar winners Robert Downey and Gwyneth Paltrow. Downey is excellent as Tony Stark, the rich industrialist weapons manufacturer. Stark is a womanizing playboy who has every gadget imaginable, but few if any true friends. Pepper Potts (Paltrow) is his harried assistant who perhaps harbors long buried feelings for Stark. Jeff Bridges is okay as Obidiah Stane, Stark's partner who has big things in mind for Stark Industries. Perhaps the best thing about Bridges' performance is his bald head and huge beard. It is pretty funny. The rest of the cast is stellar.<br /><br />The plot seems to be standard superhero stuff. I was worried that the movie might try and make a politcal statement about war. After all, the plot involves a gigantic weapons manufacturer and Islamic terrorists. The movie wades through these waters with ease, giving it realism while never offending any one's political beliefs.<br /><br />The movie has some violence that could be too harsh for younger children. There is some adult situations but no bad language. The sountrack is great and the set designs (like Stark's house) are incredible. This is a fun movie and I know I'll never read an Iron Man comic book, but I can't wait for the next movie.

B0013FXWVU|4.0|Horton Hears a Who is a wonderful adaptation of the Dr. Seuss book with something for everyone. The animation is wonderful, the casting was right on target for the characters and the rhyming mastery of Dr. Seuss is showcased. At first glance, Horton Hears a Who is a wonderful film that kids will definitely enjoy. Look a little deeper, however, and there is plenty for adults to discover. There are fun historical references peppered throughout the film and endless levels of philosophical discourse. As you're watching the film, consider the implications if the Earth were substituted for the speck? This film gives Dr. Seuss credit for the genius he is while entertaining all audiences. It will bring the kid out of everyone!
B00005JPNZ|1.0|Upon hearing about Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, I was \\"giddy as a school boy\\" to go see it.  After going opening night to see the film, that giddiness turned to grouchiness and disappointment.  The latest installment of the Jones adventures stars an aged Harrison Ford as he is trying to find the crystal skull and return it to its rightful owner.  What the previews neglect to show you about this movie is that the rightful owner of the crystal skull is an alien.  Yes my friends, an alien.    That's what the whole plot revolves around, the alien skull with mystic powers.  The movie had me wondering if there was going to be a cameo appearance by David Duchovney as Agent Mulder.  Perhaps this is a job for Agents J and K from the MIB.  And when the job is all said and done they can neuralyze everybody so they can forget anything ever happened.    That's what I'm doing with this movie, forgetting it ever was made.  Whatever George Lucas was going to do in terms of great filmmaking he's already done it.  Crystal Skull puts a scar on the Indiana Jones legacy.  A completely unnecessary film.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|LOST is one of the best shows (if not the best) on television currently; I love the characters, the story continues to go into new and exciting places and it's the only show where I'm DYING to see what happens next. Seasons 1-3 were superb and 4 is no exception. Great new characters are introduced (Miles, Daniel) and more questions are answered but the mystery is still enticing. Glad to see some old characters return and the death of some was sad to see. Can't wait for Season Five to find out what happens next...
345387336X|5.0|As a general rule, I read very little science fiction. And, when I do, I like for it to be short and not too intricately detailed about the science aspects. That's me.<br /><br />Since this was so highly rated by Time Magazine, I gave it a try. I was amazed to discover that this book complies with both of my requests of science fiction. Additionally, it merges Asimov with Raymond Chandler. \\"Ubik\\" is a whodunit, with concepts of psi powers and lunar travel and videophones. . . . to solve a murder (or are there murders?). The key science fiction element is the \\"half life\\" - a state where the deceased somehow are hooked to machines which allow them to communicate with the living while their bodies lay dormant in a conservatory. Sound a bit like \\"Matrix\\" or how about \\"Minority Report?\\"<br /><br />We work in and out of this half life concept, and the same becomes confoundedly confusing when it appears that one of the paranormal's psi powers can control the world about the half life by changing time and all around us. Mind over matter. All that matters is in the mind. If you love the volley between mind and reality, also reach for Murakami's \\"Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World: A Novel.\\"<br /><br />\\"Ubik\\" should be made into a film, especially as author Dick complied by finalizing a screenplay before his early death. But, alas his manuscript is not on celluloid. But, his ideas are - as reflected by the movies recited above - and some accuse the \\"13th Floor\\" to be a ripoff of Dick's \\"half life\\" concept which arouses your imagination in \\"Ubik\\".<br /><br />Finally, like so much literature of the 1960's, the ending is a great twist. It throws you off balance. It truly is an ending which Rod Serling would have loved.
0670020745|5.0|This remarkable book, \\"My Stroke of Insight\\" by Jill Bolte Taylor is far more than a dynamic story of a brain scientist, who suffered a massive stroke and amazingly recovered. It inspires the willingness to look beyond what we think is reality to an exploration of human consciousness and its limitless possibilities.<br /><br />For anyone who has contemplated the value of spiritual awakening, those who are currently going through an awakening and even for those who are total skeptics on this subject, this expressive scientist is able to explain the physiology of the brain, what is actually occurring and in the process, she is able to offer inspiration.<br /><br />I loved this book.<br /><br />Katie Davis, Author, \\"Awake Joy\\"
B0016A2FFG|5.0|Words cannot express how beautiful this album is. Lay It Down has the music and the signature of what an Al Green album should have. ?uestlove, James Poyser, Larry Gold, and the late great Chalmers 'Spanky' Alford have laced together an album that is natural, pure and true to the legend of Al Green's sound and feeling that has been long since oversaturated by today's R&B music.    Al Green is as sharp and as soulful as he's always been. The passion and soul in his voice is desperately needed in the current climate of music.    I profoundly recommend this album without hesitation or delay. This is truly a phenomenal piece of music with an icon of unmesurable status leading it's way.

0446691437|5.0|Of all places, this book was recommended by a screenwriter after we had come off the ice having played a game of hockey.<br />Looking back, I can think of no better poetic allusion to Pressfield's wonderfully thoughtful and amusing book than two men, dressed in armor, discussing the philosophy of creative obstacles.<br />This book, while being filed in the 'self-help' genre, is less a 'How To...' manuscript than one of changing perception.<br />It is candid, fervent in intelligence, and so personal that I constantly felt the author was writing directly to me. (A notion observed in many other readers as well).<br />Pressfield has real world accomplishments and real world obstacles. The obstacles take the form of 'Resistance' and every day is a relationship at play with retreating from them or overcoming. All misery emerges from the rift of who we are and who we want to be.<br />I always have this book at arms length, quote it often and have written my own projects with it's guidance.<br />A quick read.

0321544080|4.0|If you like to look at great pictures, and learn the story behind them, this book is for you! I really enjoyed reading this, and I will probably flick through it from time to time.    However, I did not learn much that will make me a better photographer. The reason is that Joe is on a very different level, and on a very different budget, than I am, so as long as I don't have a lot of strobes and soft boxes, I really can not apply his tips. I did learn some principles, but to me, the strength of this book is the great pictures and the amusing stories.
0446402389|4.0|I don't often read thriller novels about serial killers, but after a good review in the NY Times I felt I wanted to check out this author's first book.  This book, while it has it's flaws, is (as other reviews have mentioned) a remarkable debut and I will look forward to reading more from Mr. Smith.    The book's strength is in its setting.  Especially during the book's first half, as the protagonist agonizes over the decision to turn his wife over to the State apparatus, Mr. Smith's take on Soviet Russia was convincing and gripping.  Had this story of a serial killer been set anywhere else, I think it would be nothing more than a mediocre story with little to compel the reader forward.  However, as it is set when and where it is, the story is able to work on multiple levels and retain its fast pace.     The story is less strong, however, when it focuses on the serial killer aspect.  Some of the twists in the story are a little less than believable.  In fact, the novel really could be two separate stories - one being a thriller of a man trying to escape the coercion of an oppressive regime and the other being the story of a serial killer.  In my opinion, the first story was more compelling than the second.  Mr. Smith's dialogue also tends to be too stiff and formal and I can never quite believe any love connection between the two main characters.  I'd like to believe that Mr. Smith was trying to convey the idea that the characters were speaking Russian, and thus, much is lost in the translation.  I'm not sure that was the case however.    But for all its flaws, the book did make great use of the setting and deserves four stars.  Perhaps it's not as smartly written as books from the greats in this genre, but its pretty darn close, and Mr. Smith's career will be fun to watch either way.
B0015I2P0Y|5.0|I don't normally review music. I just listen to what I like and that's that. Elbow is a group I've never heard of, which isn't surprising, since I really don't pay much attention to the names of the groups I listen to.<br /><br />  Elbow has been around for about a dozen years. They have a very nice, mellow and original sound. I don't know enough to call it by the name of a style, but it is very easy to listen to. Interestingly, every once in a while, they drop in a bit of an old song. Cute device.<br /><br />  Overall, I am surprised that I haven't heard Elbow in the past: they really do have a nice sound, original and, quite frankly, relaxing.<br /><br />Jerry

B000S0GYRU|5.0|First of all, I what to say that people who have rated this movie less than 4 stars don't know nothing about horror movie, because after viewing more than 1500+ horror movies, this one is in my top 3 best horror movie of all time. Second of all, Halloween by Carpenter may be one of the best horror movie ever made but it's not the only one. Third of all, Halloween might not have been made if Suspiria did not exist, because it's one of Carpenter favorite movie and it influence him to make horror movies.    So, why it is that praise and that popular? It's simple, the atmosphere, the incredibly creepy music, the great and shoking killing scenes, the ingenious use of color and the slow pacing of the action, are what you need to make a really scary horror movie.    You whant to know what is a great horror movie? Do yourself a favor and buy this, you won't regret your purchase trust me.

1400064287|4.0|This book has significant value. Its obvious implication is in the field of advertising. However, it has much merit in the education arena.   The book depicts 6 ways to make your ideas stick in people's heads. Educators are repeatedly researching ways to make their materials relevant and important enough to the students that they will remember the necessary information.     The more important educational use of the book deals with creating \\"vision\\" for your school district or school. School leaders are constantly attempting to bring all parties together to see one common vision. This book provides parameters to do just that.     *Simplicity: the idea must be stripped to its core, and the most important concepts should jump out. In the face of assessments, standardized tests, etc., educators need to be reminded what the school or district's number one goal is.    * Unexpectedness: the idea must destroy preconceived notions about something. This forces people to stop, think, and remember. Teachers and administrators need \\"wake-up\\" calls occasionally.  A particular parent or student's behavior might jade their vision. Unexpectedness can help refocus staff.  * Concreteness: avoid statistics, use real-world analogies to help people understand complex ideas. Student in classrooms around the United States could benefit from \\"understanding subtraction\\" like Japan and Taiwan teaches in their classrooms.  * Credibility: if people don't trust you, they'll ignore you. In some cases, they will be openly hostile, which means they'll actively try to dispute your message. A school's relationship with their community plays a critical role in credibility. Schools without credibility have a much bigger struggle to create ideas that stick.    * Emotional: information makes people think, but emotion makes them act. Appeal to emotional needs, sometimes even way up on Maslow's hierarchy.  Educators have not capitalized on this as much as they so obviously could in the classroom and with the community.  * Stories: Schools have ample opportunity to instill a more connected feeling with their students and community. They also have a very real place in learning. Brain research by Pat Wolfe and many others has confirmed story telling as a very successful way to establish long-term memories.
B00005JPNY|1.0|Is there a zero star rating?  This is one movie that should never have been made.  The author of the book has proudly declared his hatred for the Chronicles of Narnia series and its author C.S. Lewis and has stated his series is to be an anti-Narnia.  While the movie may have tried to disguise the open attack on the church by use of the name \\"magisterium,\\" the sole purpose of both the book and movie is to discredit the Christian faith and malign God.  In the final book (and I assume also the movie based on it if one is made) God is killed and the church destroyed.  Aren't there enough dark works that exalt evil without making one with animal characters and CGI animation to lure children to it, thinking they will see a wholesome Narnia style movie, only to assalt the principles and morals on which Narnia is based?  If you don't believe in or approve of God, uplifting faith and organized churches, that is indeed your right.  But don't produce something that tries to subvertly fill children with lies and distortions about what billions believe and hold dear.

Stepping into the only diner in town, not only doesn't Jack get served, he is arrested- after taking out a few burly but surprised opponents. After a night courtesy of the DPD, Reacher is hustled back to the boundaries of Hope, where he makes the acquaintance of Vaughn, a member of Hope's police department who is both curious and skeptical about this enigmatic stranger. Jack had every intention of passing through Despair, but after a taste of its inhospitality, he wants to know what exactly is going on in this middle-of-nowhere place.<br /><br />Tell Jack to do something and he will do exactly the opposite, soon to become a considerable aggravation to Despair's authorities. Vaughn is also curious about some recent activities in the neighboring town and more than a little willing to assist Jack in his quest to uncover the nature of the bustling commerce so carefully shielded from prying eyes. In return, Reacher offers Vaughn some well-deserved support in a personal dilemma that has shattered her dreams for the future. In fine form, Child builds a frightening house of cards erected by three separate agendas, but all balancing on one horrific possibility. Returning to Despair night after night to confirm his suspicions, Reacher's problem is to subvert the most heinous plot without bringing down the entire structure to the detriment of the residents of a town that exhibits extraordinary loyalty to its employer.<br /><br />Child delivers with the usual one-two punch of crisp dialog, ill-equipped actors and the unchecked arrogance of power, digging deep into the assorted bag of fears that currently plague this country, tossing out a handful of issues for consideration, each of which is daunting on its own merits. The iconoclast never actively looks for trouble, reasonable to the extreme when confronted with options other than violence; he offers his opponents the same free choice he exercises. Trusting his logic as well as his impressive physical skills, Jack Reacher, a man with nothing to lose, puts it all on the line in a harrowing conclusion of good vs. evil, an epic struggle that is merely an appetizer for a protagonist with an appetite for action.

B00005JPNZ|2.0|Before getting to the theater to watch this new installment of Indiana Jones I watched Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade to help get me in the mood.  I was reminded what a wonderful movie and franchise Indiana Jones was.  And then I went to see this fourth installment.    There is no way this could be a bad movie.  Again, it stems from a wonderful franchise and has some of the most leading names in the industry behind it (Harrison Ford, George Lucas, Lucasfilm, Steven Spielberg, Shia LaBeouf, and David Koepp).  How could this go wrong?    The fact that it did baffles me.  I understand that Indiana movies are supposed to be fun, but this movie got a little bit too fun.  Being a little over the top is okay, but the extremes that this movie took were too much for me.  For instance, and I only mention this because it is right at the beginning of the movie, a man cannot be blown away several miles within a refrigerator, drop, roll a few hundred yards for good measure, and then get out and dust himself off.  And if something this implausible happened once or twice throughout the movie I think I could be okay with it but something like this happened every ten minutes.    I wouldn't be so upset about this but the rest of the franchise isn't like this.  Indiana Jones wasn't quite so immortal.  The storyline was never this predictable.  The plot was never so thin.  You would think that after twenty years that something wonderful would be created.  I'm extremely disappointed.    And some of the changes... changing from Nazis to Cold War Soviets as the enemy was a needed change.  Harrison Ford/Indiana Jones is now 20 years older so if Nazis were still around there would be a lot of explaining to do.  But the fact that Indiana Jones now goes by Henry irked me extremely.  Indiana's name has ALWAYS been Henry but he has ALWAYS gone by the name Indiana.  There was no reason to change it so friends called him Henry only because Sean Connery mentioned it was his real name as the endof the third movie.  And somewhere along the line Indiana Jones became a Colonel.  What is that all about?  Also, they couldn't pull Sean Connery out of retirement to do this movie.  That's too bad, but I can understand Sean wanting to remain in retirement.  But how about a two minute cameo like he did in Robin Hood?  How about at least leaving the door open to future cameos if they start making more Indiana movies?  No, instead they have him killed off.  Just closed that door.    There were some good things about this, however.  Harrison Ford could not have done any better in his reprisal of Indiana Jones.  He flowed back into the role like he had been playing it for the last twenty years.  Harrison Ford is one of this and last generation's greatest actors and this movie reminds us why this is.  Shia LaBeouf's star keeps rising and I, for the most part, enjoyed his role in this movie.  There were some light-hearted funny moments and hearing the Indiana Jones score by John Williams on the big screen filled me with a flood of memories.    Despite the two-star rating, I'd advise seeing it at least once if you are an Indiana Jones fan.  If this were a regular movie I would have given it three stars but I docked it a star for its lost potential.  It really should have been soooooo much more than it turned out to be.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Anyone who gives this less than 5 stars might be completely out of their minds.<br /><br />This is a realistic and harsh look at the lives of the men as they served during World War II. It burns into your memory.<br /><br />Each of the actors did an oustanding job in their potrayal of the men of Easy Company.<br /><br />I love the DVD set. The video diary of actor Ron Livingston is a real bonus. It was impressive to see all of the actors go through rigorous training and bootcamp for their roles. Hat's off to them.<br /><br />5 STARS ALL THE WAY!
0307388840|3.0|Personally, I hated it. The writing was beautiful, the characters were alive and realistic and the story was believable yet moving; and I hated it. It was difficult for me to get into and while some moments seemed to drag on for 50 pages, others seemed to pass in a paragraph. I found myself skipping over pages and saying to myself \\"Ok, I get it already, move on\\". This was my primary reason for disliking the book, my other reasons are based more on personal taste so I won't bore you with them. Basically, I can put up with a lot for a good ending. Atonement's ending lacked... well, an ending.
B0000041WV|4.0|These Dvorak symphonies, recorded by Kertesz/LSO from 1963-67, are still a fine choice if you are looking for a complete set, followed by Kubelik on DG. Symphonies 1-5 and the overtures are all excellent, with a bit of dropoff on 6-9. Not that the last four great symphonies are bad by any means, but when compared to performances by Talich, Ancerl and Szell they come up a bit short. So, by all means get this complete set (especially at this price), then supplement as (or if) you see fit. The sound is fine throughout. Kertesz also has a set of Dvorak's Symphonic Poems and Overtures on a Decca 2 CD set that is very good, but may be out of print.<br />**I was reading over this review and realized I didn't choose some of the wording appropriately. When I said there was a dropoff in the late symphonies, I didn't mean for it to sound like they weren't played wonderfully. These are some of the best Dvorak symphonies ever recorded. The point I was trying to make is that Kertesz doesn't have much competition at all in the early ones (1-5), while there is plenty in Nos. 6-9. The other orchestral works included in this set are also true classics (In Nature's Realm, Carnival, My Home and Scherzo capriccioso). Kertesz is still my first choice in Dvorak's symphonic/orchestral works in most cases. However my picks for the late symphonies are: No.6 - Ancerl/Czech/PO on Supraphon, Nos. 7 & 8 - Talich on Naxos Historical and No. 9 - Ancerl. Talich is also my choice for the late tone poems, and Kubilik or Szell for the Slavonic Dances. You really can't go wrong in Dvorak as long as you stick to a conductor who has this music in his blood (Talich, Ancerl, Kubilik, Szell or Harnoncourt). I have recordings by all of the above and haven't been disappointed by any of them.
B000NS45DW|5.0|A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a wonderful story that is one I have enjoyed reading over and over from the time I was 15 to now in my fifties. If you are from New York you will relate to it even more, but if not you will love it anyway. Her other book, Maggie Now, is great also.
0385340567|4.0|After having Reacher team up with his former army colleagues in \\"Bad Luck and Trouble\\", Lee Child has gone back to Reacher's loner roots. \\"Nothing to Lose\\" opens with Reacher literally walking into the small town of Despair, Colorado, where he's promptly arrested and run out of town. What are the secrets that the residents of Despair are so desperate to keep hidden? Reacher is equally determined to find out and no one is going to stop him.<br /><br />The pace of this book is slower than most of the others that Lee Child has written and my feeling is that perhaps it relates to a departure from formula. Usually Reacher encounters someone - a former colleague, an attractive woman, a man with a missing wife - with a problem and that creates the momentum. In this book, he simply stumbles on behavior that he finds odd, and therefore starts investigating, with several clandestine visits to Despair that do start to feel somewhat repetitive. Along the way he teams up with a local policewoman who also provides the obligatory romantic sub-plot. The book keeps you guessing with lots of sub-plots and little mysteries along the way (some of which turn out to be red herrings, but I suppose that adds to the intrigue).<br /><br />\\"Nothing to Lose\\" delivered my much-anticipated \\"Reacher fix\\", but it's not Lee Child's best. Although it's a stand-alone novel, I wouldn't recommend starting here if you haven't read any other Lee Child books: you won't get what the fuss is about. I wasn't as absorbed by this one as I have been by the others in the series. The middle section dragged a little, but having said that it's still an easy read that goes down fast and keeps you up turning pages into the night. Probably if it had been another author this would have rated 3 stars for me, but I'm a shameless Reacher fan, so I'm rating it 4 stars.

B000B5XOSO|5.0|There's never been a more potent weapon than sex. In the hands of the wrong woman - an angry one - every man is in danger. Even Batman. Especially Batman. In Tim Burton's darkly oddball sequel BATMAN RETURNS, Batman seems unbeatable against Gotham City's nemesis Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) or The Penguin (Danny DeVito). He's not in any real danger until he meets Catwoman, a tiny, curvaceous blonde out there in that Gotham tomb of a city all by herself. Batman knows she wants to kill him, but he can't figure out why. And, confused neurotic that he is, deep down he digs it. Big mistake. Michelle Pfeiffer, cursed with a rare beauty, has spent most of her career playing someone's object of desire - an exhaustingly passive role for such a talent. In Catwoman, she found the part that would turn her image on its head, and she sank her formidable acting claws into it.<br /><br />Tim Burton isn't an actor's director - he's a visionary with his sights set elsewhere. But Pfeiffer can handle herself. First, she takes Selina Kyle - pre-Catwoman - and makes her much more than the frumpy, put-upon office gal the character might otherwise have been. Pfeiffer's Selina is full of nervous twitches, and when she talks to herself, it's scary. Pfeiffer brings Selina's sexual longing front-and-center, particularly when she's imagining the amorous exploits of her cat. And when Selina confronts her evil boss Shreck with his secrets, Pfeiffer plays it coy, almost like a seduction, as if she doesn't care about the danger.<br /><br />Everything Catwoman will be, Pfeiffer shows us, already exists in Selina. As Selina trashes her pink, frilly little girl's world on the way to her transformation into Catwoman, it's a pissed-off Michelle Pfeiffer we've never seen before. Then, once concealed in her skintight cat suit, Pfeiffer is free to climb over the top, and from her first line as Catwoman - \\"I don't know about you, Miss Kitty, but I feel so much YUMMIER\\" - we know she's not going to stop there. This character could have been just another campy confection, but Pfeiffer makes her truly dangerous. Her Catwoman voice is more a guttural growl than a purr. And when she gives herself an astounding tongue bath in front of the horny Penguin, it's too flat-out nasty to be a come-on. It's meant to provoke. Then, in that signature moment when she backflips up to Batman and Penguin and delivers a welcoming \\"Meow,\\" it's perfect: jaded, world-weary and dripping with sex. Suddenly, the rest of the movie falls away and it's down to the two of them, circling each other, sizing each other up. As Selina to Keaton's Bruce Wayne, Pfeiffer struggles to control her neurotic alter ego in a comically dysfunctional relationship. As Catwoman to Keaton's Batman, she tries to rip her opponent/lover to shreds. In either guise, she's forever peeking from behind her mask, assessing the damage, wondering how far she should go - the perfect participant in a romance for the '90s.racter could have been just another campy confection, but Pfeiffer makes her truly dangerous.

B0010V4TZU|3.0|I don't quite know what to make of this stuff.  Fun, light airy African/pop-influenced music made by the half-shaven (or unshaven), young-looking guys you see at 24-hour coffee establishments wearing sweaters and skinny jeans.  I'm probably \\"supposed\\" to like it this year but by next year regard it as a passing fad.  But do I actually like it?<br /><br />The short answer is \\"yes.\\"  The long answer is \\"maybe,\\" which may be why its taken me a while to offer my thoughts on it.  Initially this is very appealing music, great stuff for parties and hanging out.  It has the feel of Talking Heads without some of the quirkiness and polyrhythmic complexity, or Peter Gabriel (who is actually - and smartly - namechecked in one of the songs) without the heavy moodiness.  But it has a sort of unquantifiable air of disposeableness about it too, as if its shelf life may expire at any time within the next year or so.  The songs are fine on their own but all together are samey.  There is one central idea here and, although it's clever and certainly well-executed, the impact is dulled as the band repeats it over and over.  I am finding that these songs work better on mixes, split up amongst other things, rather than together in the album context.  For me that's a warning sign.  Not timeless stuff, but adequate for its purposes.<br /><br />What I am wondering is what will happen next for this band.  Where is there to go?  They do one thing very well.  Will they try two or three things on their next album?  Focus more on songwriting than sound (that is what I'd probably suggest for these boys)?  Do the same thing again and get lambasted by critics?  Your guess is as good as mine.  While it will be interesting, I have some doubts as to whether I'll even care by the time phase two is rolled out.  Then again, I have been proven wrong plenty of times before...
0465092764|5.0|I am writing this blurb in reply to Lubos Motl's (you guess it, another String practitioner whose livelihood is being threatened by this book) comment.    The fact that Peter Woit runs a blog critical of String only shows that he is consistent with his opinions. It should shock any impartial observer that in the eye of String practitioners--Lubos Motl being by no means exceptional among String people--this somehow automatically qualifies Woit and his readers as \\"crackpots\\". But what is even more shocking is the comparison to William Dembski's ID (Intelligent Design) blog, because String itself actually provides the perfect analogy to ID.    Let me elaborate. At the height of the recent Pennsylvania ID trial, many education experts came forward to defend the theory of Evolution. One of the hotly debated issues was the definition of a \\"theory\\" in science. The ID people, including Mr. George W the Decider, have argued repeatedly that, since Evolution is just a theory, other theories such as ID deserve at least some mention in the classrooms. The defenders of Evolution rely on the rebuttal that a theory in science actually means something that provides the best framework to explain a multitude of independent observations or experimental results and therefore has been accepted by scientific community at large. This, of course, is a lie. String has been paraded as a \\"theory\\" in every physics department for over two decades, and yet not only has it produced no testable prediction but it will almost certainly never be able to do so. This puts String squarely in the company of ID. Furthermore, just like ID has morphed constantly, free of the constraint of experimental confirmation, String has changed constantly ever since its inception. In other words, not only does String produce untestable predictions, but these predictions also change from year to year, often dramatically and in a mutually contradictive way. (Have they settled on the dimensionality of space-time yet? Is it 26, 10, 11, or all of the above?)    Other similarities exist, chief among them the religious ferver driving both groups to influence popular opinions and police dissenting thoughts, as exemplified by Lubos Motl's criticism of this book. But there is one big difference between String and ID. The String practitioners are insiders of the science community. They hire their own and make sure String-related papers get published. When a group dominates the peer-review process, it controls the career of every physicist in related fields. It then gains the power to influence, bribe, coerce and intimidate.    Of the five purported String supporters in general physics cited by Motl, I have not worked with Gell-Mann or Hawking, so I don't know what their excuses are (or if they actually need one, since String people tend to misrepresent general enthusiasm for high-energy theories as specific support for String). Prof. Weinberg is the head of a large String group even though he did not publish many real String papers himself. I would certainly count him in the String camp. Dr. Randall and Dr. Arkani-Hamid both took advantage of String referee's eagerness to find supporting work and padded their publication counts with a series of well-publicized \\"String-Phenomenology\\" (an oxymoron) papers, thus can hardly be called disinterested third parties either.    The rest of Motl's criticism can be condensed into two simple arguments. The first is that the author does not know details in String as well as he does. This is probably correct technically, particularly in light of the freely changing nature of String's \\"conclusions\\". But the core message (as well as the title) of the book is not that String gets the details wrong but that String has no details that can be proven wrong (or right). In this sense, Motl's straw-man argument is irrelevant.    The second point Motl made is, \\"The problematic statement that string theory makes no prediction is repeated hundreds of times, and in many particular contexts, such a statement becomes not only boring but also patently false.\\" But Motl did not offer any justification why that statement is false. He simply proceeded to throw out more buzzwords and correct more details. One has to conclude that these buzzwords are nothing more than smoke screens meant to obscure the fact no justification could possibly be offered for his claim.    String is a unique phenomenon. It is the most \\"successful\\" pseudo science in modern history. Its catalyst is the unprecedented absence of real experimental input in high-energy physics during the past 30 years. Like a cancer, it turns otherwise worthy members of a formerly proud body into the self-promoting endlessly-propagating automatons sucking all resources dry. Later generations of historians of science will surely make their careers studying this bizarre event. Yet it has not begun. This book is not perfect, but as the first formal effort to recognize and document this historical phenomenon, it is a must read.

So befalls Linkin Park, who turn to uber-producer Rick Rubin for guidance and make their best album yet.<br /><br />All parties involved have seen the writing on the well: NuMetal and RapRock are teetering towards the tarpit.

Thus, once the true-to-form first song \\"Wake/Given Up\\" crashes your sound system, LP drops a major ballad in the form of \\"Leave Out All The Rest.\\" In fact, the only traces left of the band that roared on [[ASIN:B00004Z459 Hybrid Theory]] are found on that opening track and on the excellent single, \\"Bleed It Out.\\" Otherwise, maturity has found its place on \\"Minutes To Midnight.\\"<br /><br />After all, once you've left Southern California to sip Cristal with Jay-Z, tour the world and make a stop in Post-Katrina New Orleans (\\"The Little Things Give You Away\\"), well, \\"Numb\\" just isn't the song/viewpoint that's going to emerge. The band members that were just entering their twenties at their debut are now pushing thirty; rapper Mike Shinoda delivers the killer \\"Hands Held High,\\" as virulent a protest song as any band, much less a band where the big protest number is rapped, delivered in 2007. It's then followed by Chester, who strikes hard with \\"No More Sorrow.\\" It's some great stuff, powerful.<br /><br />However, Linkin Park still has to overcome the presupposition that maturity also means syrupy. \\"Valentine's Day\\" is a sappy song with a dumb lyric, even if Chester tries to sound like he's really hurt. His hurt is far more convincing when he's po'd, but again, the NuMetal Sing-like-the-cookie-monster style has left the station, so LP probably decided to reign in the screams from popping up too often. It also means that there's a noticeable decrease in the guitar heroics which, while not a detriment, does remove some of the visceral force that made [[ASIN:B00008H2LB Meteora]] and the debut memorable.<br /><br />Even minus the blunt force, \\"Minutes To Midnight\\" still whomps 90% of what passes for rock records these days.

0812975219|4.0|This everyman's introduction to randomness should prove interesting to everyone who invests for profit, fun or retirement. The narrative style conveys the author's point that random spikes or troughs can occur in any investment without warning and that the oft used normal curve does not necessarily model the behavior of investments. It's sort of like saying that the normal wind speed is an accurate model for what could happen in tornado alley on a specific day in the summer.    That being said, there's little guidance for the investor about ameliorating the effects of \\"black swan\\" events; the best one can do is expect them and try to avoid being over-extended in yesterday's hot  investment when the bottom falls out.

At times it seems as if the band is trying to be something they aren't.    Pretty. Odd. has taken the momentum created by A Fever You Can't Sweat Out and fumbled it.

If you love R.E.M. buy this album and go see them if you can.   I bought it, then saw the 6/01 show in Berkeley.I haven't been able to get these songs out of my head!
B000YXMMAE|5.0|As soon as the opening lines of \\"15 Step\\" came on through my headphones the day that Radiohead released the mp3s without a label, I realized that it was going to be a pretty special listening experience. Radiohead has done some interesting and wonderful things with their music over the last decade or so with \\"OK Computer\\" (one of the best albums of all time in my opinion) and another strong release in \\"Kid A\\" only a few years later. While the band has evolved a lot since \\"Pablo Honey\\" and \\"The Bends\\", they have continued to display a pretty unique sound. It would probably be best to describe \\"In Rainbows\\" as a return to their \\"OK Computer\\" sound. Radiohead fans are sure to enjoy this release and I have a feeling many previously non-fans may find this album a little more accessible and fun than the last couple of releases.    A couple of my favorite tunes are \\"15 Step\\" and \\"All I Need\\" but there are really no fillers on this album. I guarantee you will enjoy it.
0307237702|5.0|The book is a straight forward read with substance and heart.  I recommend it to anyone who plans to vote in November 2008.    Here are some representative out-takes from the book to give you a feel for the content of the book:    P11 & 12 - I wish the country had fewer lawyers and more engineers.   I think America has more often been a force for good than for ill in the world; I carry few illustrations about our enemies, and revere the courage and competence of our military.  I reject a politics that is based solely on racial identity, gender identity, sexual orientation, or victimhood generally.  I think much of what ails the inner city involves a breakdown in culture that will not be cured by money alone, and that our values and spiritual life matter at least as much as our GDP.    P15 - In the world's greatest deliberative body, no one is listening.    P16 - With the rest of the public, I had watched campaign culture metastasize throughout the body politics, as an entire industry of insult - both perpetual and somehow profitable - emerged to dominate cable TV, talk radio, and the New York Times best-seller list.    P17 - Throughout my years in Springfield, I had clung to the notion that politics could be different, and that the voters wanted something different; that they were tired of distortion, name-calling, and sound bite solutions to complicated problems; that if I could reach those voters directly, frame the issues as I felt them, explain the choices in as truthful a fashion as I knew how, then the people's instincts for fair play and common sense would bring them around.  If enough of us took that risk, I thought, not only the country's politics but the country's policies would change for the better.    P22 - It's not simply that a gap exists between our professed ideals as a nation and the reality we witness every day.  --- No, what's troubling is the gap between the magnitude of our challenges and the smallness of our politics - the ease with which we are distracted by the petty and trivial, our chronic avoidance of tough decisions, our seeming inability to build a working consensus to tackle any big problem.    P23 - We know that the battle against international terrorism is at once an armed struggle and a contest of ideas, that our long-term security depends on both a judicious projection of military power and increased cooperation with other nations, and that addressing the problem of global poverty and failed states is vital to our nation's interest rather than just a matter of charity.  But follow most of our foreign policy debate, and you might believe that we have only 2 choices - belligerence or isolationism.    P37 - What has characterized the ideological core of today's GOP is absolutism, not conservatism.  There is the absolutism of the free market, an ideology of no taxes, no regulation, no safety net - indeed, no government beyond what's required to protect private property and provide for the national defense.    P41 & 42 - Maybe the critics are right.  Maybe there's no escaping our great political divide, an endless clash of armies, and any attempt to alter the rules of engagement are futile.  Or maybe the trivialization of politics has reached a point of no return, so that most people see it as just one more diversion, a sport, with politicians our paunch-bellied gladiators and those who bother to pay attention just fans on the sidelines:  we paint our faces red and blue and cheer our side and boo their side, and if it takes a late hit or cheap shot to beat the other team, so be it, for winning is all that matters.    But I don't think so.  They are out there, I think to myself, those ordinary citizens who have grown up in the midst of all the political and cultural battles, but who have found a way - in their own lives, at least - to make peace with their neighbors, and themselves.  --- I imagine they are waiting for a politics with the maturity to balance idealism and realism, to distinguish between what can and cannot be compromised, to admit the possibility that the other side might sometimes have a point.  They don't always understand the arguments between right and left, conservative and liberal, but they recognize the difference between dogma and common sense, responsibility and irresponsibility, between those things that last and those that are fleeting.  They are out there, waiting for Republicans and Democrats to catch up with them.    P53 & 54 - \\"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\\"    Those simple words are our starting point as Americans; they describe not only the foundation of our government but the substance of our common creed.    The value of individual freedom is so deeply ingrained in us that we tend to take it for granted.  It is easy to forget that at the time of our nation's founding this idea was entirely radical in its implications, as radical as Martin Luther's posting on the church door.  It is an idea that some portion of the world still rejects - and for which an even larger portion of humanity finds scant evidence in their daily lives.    P54 & 55 - At its most elemental level, we understand our liberty in a negative sense.  As a general rule we believe in the right to be left alone, and are suspicious of those - whether Big Brother or nosy neighbors - who want to meddle in our business.  But we understand our liberty in a more positive sense as well, in the idea of opportunity and the subsidiary values that help realize opportunity - self-reliance, self-improvement, risk-taking, drive, discipline, temperance, hard work, thrift, personal responsibility, optimism, faith in free will, self-government, free-market economy, family, community, patriotism, honesty, fairness, humility, kindness, courtesy, compassion manners, competence, civil behavior, moral bearings, authenticity, empathy, fairness ...etc.    P59-60 - Despite what seemed to be a death penalty system ripe for reform, few people gave my bill much chance of passing.  ...  It would have been typical of today's politics for each side to draw lines in the sand: for the death penalty opponents to harp on racism and police misconduct and for law enforcement to suggest that my bill coddled criminals.  ... Instead of focusing on the serious disagreements around the table, I talked about the common value that I believed everyone shared, regardless of how each of us might feel about the death penalty: that is, the basic principle that no innocent person should end up on death row, and that no person guilty of a capital offense should go free. ... At the end of the process, the bill had the support of all parties involved.  It passed unanimously in the IL Senate and was signed into law.    P86 - For all our disagreements we would be hard pressed to find (someone) ... who doesn't subscribe to the basic set of individual liberties identified by the Founders and enshrined in our Constitution and our common law:    The right to speak our minds;  The right to worship how and if we please;  The right to peaceably assemble to petition our government;  The right to own, buy and sell property and not have it taken without fair compensation;  The right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures;  The right not to be detained by the state without due process;  The right to a fair and speedy trial;  And the right to make our own determinations, with minimal restrictions, regarding family life and the way we raise our children.    We consider these rights to be universal, a codification of liberty's meaning, constraining all levels of government and applicable to all people within the boundaries of our political community.    P100 - \\"So few people read the Constitution today,\\" Sen. Byrd said, pulling out his copy from his breast pocket.  \\"I've always said, this document and the Holy Bible, they've been all the guidance I need.\\"    Before I left, he insisted that his secretary bring in a set of his Senate histories for me to have.  As he slowly set the beautifully bound books on the table and searched for a pen, I told him how remarkable it was that he had found the time to write.    \\"Oh, I have been fortunate,\\" he said, nodding to himself.  \\"Much to be thankful for.  There's not much I wouldn't do over.\\"  Suddenly he paused and looked squarely into my eyes.  \\"I only have one regret, you know.  The foolishness of youth ...\\"    We sat there for a moment, considering the gap of years and experience between us.    \\"We all have regrets, Senator,\\" I said finally.  \\"We just ask that in the end, God's grace shines upon us.\\"    He studied my face for a moment, then nodded with the slightest of smiles and flipped open the cover of one of the books.  \\"God's grace.  Yes indeed.  Let me sign these for you then,\\" he said, and taking one hand to steady the other, he slowly scratched his name on the gift.    P294 & 295 - When a group of Chicago activists asked me to speak at a large antiwar rally planned for Oct, (2002), a number of my friends warned me against taking so public a position on such a volatile issue.  Not only was the idea of an invasion increasingly popular, but on the merits I didn't consider the case against war to be cut-and-dried.  Like most analysts, I assumed Saddam had chemical and biological weapons, and coveted nuclear arms.  I believed that he had repeatedly flouted UN resolutions and weapons inspectors and that such behavior had to have consequences.  That Saddam butchered his own people was undisputed; I had no doubt that the world, and the Iraqi people, would be better off without him.    What I sensed, though, was that the threat Saddam posed was not imminent, the Administration's rationales for the war were flimsy and ideologically driven, and the war in Afghanistan was far from complete.  And I was certain that by choosingprecipitous, unilateral military action over the hard slog of diplomacy, coercive inspections, and smart sanctions, America was missing an opportunity to build a broad base of support for its policies.    And so I made the speech. ... I also said that \\"after witnessing the carnage and destruction (in NY), the dust and the tears, I supported this Administration's pledge to hunt down and root out those who would slaughter innocents in the name of intolerance\\" and would \\"willingly take up arms myself to prevent such tragedy from happening again.\\"    What I could not support was \\"a dumb war, a rash war, a war based not on reason but on passion, not on principle but on politics.\\"  And I said:    \\" I know that even a successful war against Iraq will require a US occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences.  I know that an invasion of Iraq without a clear rational and without strong international support will only fan the flames of the Middle East, and encourage the worst, rather than the best, impulses of the Arab world, and strengthen the recruitment of Al Qaeda.    P356 & 357 - The audacity of hope.  That was the best of the American spirit, I thought - having the audacity to believe despite all the evidence to the contrary that we could restore a sense of community to a nation torn by conflict; the gall to believe that despite personal setbacks ...we had some control - and therefore responsibility - for our own fate.    It was that audacity, I thought, that joined us as one people.  It was that pervasive spirit that tied my own family's story to the larger American story.    P362 - My heart is filled with love for this country.
B00005OWEG|4.0|As a kid I remember hearing about Apocalypse Now and thinking that it was some sort of dark and forbidden territory for a war movie.  That was much the way Vietnam was presented to me in general growing up.  Since then I've written a college thesis on the war...    I watched the original a number of times and it was entertaining as compact, action packed and surreal.  I preferred Platoon.  But I always heard stories about \\"The French Plantation Scene\\" and \\"The Bunny Scene\\".  So what did Coppola do?  He gave us what we wanted to see.  And now we have his whole vision.  I can see the merit in saying that Redux is too long and rambling - that it lacks the pyschedelic punch of the original.  But the humor makes it all the more surreal.  The GI's in the medical unit cared less about Willard, helicopters or Playmates.  Kilgore wasn't that different than some commanders I knew in Iraq whose priorities were just...out of this world.      I'll have to say that as long as it is, I prefer Redux because it was what Coppola wanted us to see all along.  It gives his vision much more majesty and breathing room.  It was also what most of the viewers wanted to see all along with the long rumored \\"forbidden\\" scenes.

B0015XHQTE|5.0|This review is from; [[ASIN:B0015XHQTE Dirty Harry Ultimate Collector's Edition]]<br /><br />Actually Target just made my day because they had it on sale for $49.99 so I bought a set last night.  The \\"Dirty Harry\\" movie series featuring Clint Eastwood is a genuine classic that was perhaps a blueprint for many future, cop movies with an \\"attitude\\".  Actually Dirty Harry isn't that dirty. He simply had to co-exist in an uneven, justice system and always angry, yet clueless police superiors throughout the five films while dealing with matters in his own way. Even if his own way meant crashing cars through buildings or whipping out that giant 44 magnum for quick and swift justice.<br /><br />\\"Now are there six discs in this Ultimate Collector's Edition Set or seven? Somehow in all of this excitement I lost count!\\"<br /><br />There are seven discs in this Dirty Harry Ultimate Collector's Edition Set and the exclusive disc that is available in this set is the Eastwood documentary \\"Clint Eastwood- Out of the Shadows\\". Trust me, if you are a hardcore Eastwood fan like me, the extra cash to buy this set is worth it because of this exclusive documentary disc on one of the greatest screen icons of film history. \\"Out of the Shadows\\" (1 hour 26 minutes) which was a DVD originally released in 2001, documents Eastwood's entire life from his upbringing in the San Francisco Bay Area to his entire film career. It is narrated by Morgan Freeman. We hear from his mother, Ruth Wood.  We learn of Eastwood's passion for Jazz. We then learn of Eastwood's stoic rise in the film industry from his minor roles (many film clips are shown, even his minor ones) to his first major TV series \\"Rawhide\\". We learn of his close relation to legendary director Sergio Leone who gave Clint his first major starring role in the Spaghetti Western trilogy despite the English/Italian language barrier. We also learn of his very, special relation to his dear friend and director Don Siegel who became his best mentor. It was mainly from Siegel that Eastwood became more interested in directing in addition to acting. We learn of Eastwood directing \\"Play Misty for Me\\" for free because the movie studios didn't want risk funding a new and inexperienced director, but Eastwood did it for free anyways simply to get the experience.<br /><br />In addition to Eastwood himself, we hear from directors Martin Scorsese, Don Siegel (vintage recording) and Sergio Leone (vintage recording). We also hear from actors/actresses Eli Walach, Forest Whitaker, James Garner, Meryl Streep, Gene Hackman, Richard Burton (vintage recording) and many others. I wasn't ever really a fan of actress, Sandra Locke, but she is oddly missing from this documentrary except for her film clips. Nevertheless, Locke was vital to Eastwood's film career and I still would have liked to hear any of her current insights, but her romantic separation from Eastwood as well as her lawsuit against Eastwood & Warner Brothers might be the very reason she has been excluded. We also hear of Eastwood's 1986 Mayor campaign in Carmel, California which was an area that was one of his favorite retreats and current home. Since I live fairly close to Carmel, I still remember those \\"Go Ahead & Make My Day - Vote for Eastwood!\\" bumper stickers from 1986. I personally own over 20 Eastwood movies on DVD so it was a real pleasure to watch this. It's a great documentary of his success, failures and motivations.<br /><br />As for the five DVD movies they are great new transfers. I used to own the old 2001 transfers which I initially thought were pretty good transfers, but they were many noticeable film flaws especially on the first two films \\"Dirty Harry\\" & \\"Magnum Force\\". The colors on the new transfers look more vibrant and most of the film imperfections from the previous transfers have been drastically corrected. Fantastic restoration!  Each film comes with its own feature length commentary, featurettes and trailers. Dirty Harry is the only film that is a two-disc edition while the remaining four films are single discs. Any special features from the old 2001 DVD set (which weren't many) are ALL carried over to the new set plus there are many other new ones added.<br /><br />There are many physical extras included in this set. Some are typical, but some are pretty odd yet unique.  There are five mini poster cards for each of the five films plus another card featuring all five films (actually it's a picture of a gun with 5 bullets stamped with names of all of the films which is similar to the box art). A fold up \\"Scorpio\\" map of San Francisco is included which documents exact locations for the first \\"Dirty Harry\\" film. A set of six mini Warner Brother movie studio inter-office memos/telegrams about the \\"Dirty Harry\\" film production is included. It was interesting to note there are memos relating to Frank Sinatra's initial interest in the title role, but he had to reject the role because of his injured hand. The film also had the alternate title \\"Dead Right\\" instead of \\"Dirty Harry\\". Old \\"Blue Eyes\\" as Inspector Calahan? I'm sure glad it worked out for Clint Eastwood instead who initially rejected the role due to his own scheduling conflicts. In fact, a mini letter from Eastwood is included in this DVD set stating how he got the \\"Dirty Harry\\" role after his initial rejection which he regretted in addition to statements about thanking you for buying this newly, remastered DVD set. \\"Oh you're welcome, Mr. Eastwood!\\" The mini letter also contains a pre-signed signature.<br /><br />The DVD set also contains a 44-page book about all five \\"Dirty Harry\\" films. Note this book is \\"hard-cover bound\\" not paper bound. Very nice! The book is filled mostly with color/black & white photos with notes on each film's villain, Dirty Harry's partners and memorable quotes. The final extra is a replica inspector Calahan badge & photo I.D. enclosed in a vinyl wallet. Gee, now I only need a 44 Magnum with this badge and I can  start harassing and arresting  some of my co-workers or friends!<br /><br />My only, minor complaints for this whole DVD package is the package itself. While packaged nicely, I would have preferred individual slim plastic cases for all five films which are similar to the James Bond Ultimate Edition DVD sets. In the Dirty Harry DVD set the documentary is packaged in its own cardboard/plastic single fold cover, but the remaining six film discs are packaged in two cardboard/plastic tri-fold covers. The cardboard tends to wear after repeated removals & replacements, but if slim plastic cases were used they could be replaced easily.  I also didn't like the fact that none of the special features for each film disc are printed anywhere on the package. If you want to know about the features for each disc, you have to simply insert the disc in the DVD player and scroll through the on-screen menus. Not a huge deal for me, but I think it would have been helpful if the all of special features were printed on the tri-fold disc holders or on some sort of page insert. I'm sure the individual, new \\"Dirty Harry\\" movies sold in the plastic snap cases have specific listings of the special features printed on their own, individual, case inserts.<br /><br />Overall, despite my minor complaints this is the best DVD set to have of the classic \\"Dirty Harry\\" series. Vastly superior in picture, sound and supplements in comparison to the older 2001 DVD's.  I contemplated about buying the new movies individually and foregoing the Ultimate Set, but the documentary disc \\"Out of the Shadows\\" swayed me to the Ultimate set and I'm sure glad I did because the nicely-packaged, physical extras were a pleasant bonus! \\"Do You Feel Lucky Punk?\\" Yes, I'm one lucky punk today!emaining four films are single discs.

B0012K1ILW|4.0|I must say that this isn't the typical E.Badu listeners are used to hearing. But, without change there isn't growth. I know I don't wanna keep listening to the same thing over and over again each cd. Anyway. When I first got it, I wasn't really feeling it. I'm still taking multiple listens to some of the songs. However, I just saw E. Badu & The Roots live like 2 weeks ago and she kilt it. So, that motivated me to take a deeper listen to New Amerykah. And, I now I am completely diggin it. All I can say is give it a chance before you dismiss it and you won't be disappointed.    *Favs: My People         Healer         Me         Soilder

0061564893|4.0|Gavin Menzies, 1421: The Year China Discovered America<br />(William Morrow, New York) 2003<br />xxiv+552 pages<br />ISBN 0-08-053763-9<br /><br />Critiqued by Frederic Jueneman<br /><br />The early Fifteenth Century saw a burgeoning of The Renaissance in Europe--a stirring of intellectual, religious, and philosophical thought that also gave rise to visions of empire and conquest.  And, apparently so too in the Far East, for Ming Emperor Zhu Di of China, in his infinite imperial wisdom countermanded his conservative-minded mandarin advisors and commissioned an unprecedented fleet of ships to explore the entire globe in 1421, and to bring veneration and tribute to his sovereign majesty, the Son of Heaven.<br /><br />At this time Europe was relatively unaware of any lands in the Western oceanic expanse and traded overland to Middle Eastern and Asiatic marketplaces, paying baksheesh and bribes to the wealthy and avaricious Mongol and Persian potentates along the Silk Road, while complaining over the ever-increasing prices in such trades and looking for alternate passages.  This was a very old complaint, as the Roman statesman Seneca in the First Century AD had also bemoaned the high costs of goods and spices from the Orient and predicted that another route across the Western expanse beyond the Pillars of Hercules would some day be found.  But, until the Portuguese Prince Henry \\"The Navigator\\" sent a paltry few but successful lanteen-sailed fleets to explore the west coast of Africa and eventually sail around the Cape of Good Hope into the Indian Ocean, little was known of any sea lanes other than those in the Mediterranean and along the western Atlantic shores of Europe.<br /><br />Henry the Navigator procured his clues secretively from the 1428 World Map provided to cartographer Fra Mauro by the Venetian trader Niccol&ograve; da Conti, who arrived in 1420 at Calicut, a major trading port on the Malabar coast of India, just prior to the launching of the four square-masted \\"treasure\\" armadas of exploration and commerce by Zhu Di.  Da Conti undoubtedly was also able to secure a berth on one of the junks then currently plying the Seven Seas as well as access to navigation charts used by these intrepid traders in the Orient.  One is led to think that Venetians had a special place in oriental esteem since the excursions of Marco Polo in the late 13th Century.  For, at the time of Zhu Di, the Chinese already had at least eight centuries of seafaring experience. (In AD 499 the Buddhist priest Hoei-Shin returned from a land twenty thousand li (8000  nautical miles) east of China, naming this continent Fusang after the red-fruited maguey trees that grow in Central and South America.)<br /><br />Prince Henry himself had a special heritage in seafaring.  His grandfather was the English prince, John of Gaunt, son of Edward III, who in turn had sent his prelate Nicholas of Lynn on a westward voyage of exploration in 1360 to find the fabled Avalon of King Arthur.  Henry's mother was Queen Philippa, daughter of John of Gaunt and wife of John I of Portugal.  The English and Portuguese enjoyed a unique mar¬time relationship through their royal lines and patronage, while maintaining an uneasy truce with Aragon and Castile, the two Spanish kingdoms (which were later united with the marriage of Ferdinand and Isabella).<br /><br />The 1428 World Map was a chart of sea routes, but also showed a passage around the southern tip of Africa.  So, when the Genovese navigator Christopher Columbus came on the scene there was sufficient knowledge of the seas to whet his appetite for westward trade routes across the Atlantic.  His voyage on a English ship in 1477 at least as far west as Greenland showed such feasibility.  However, John II of Portugal refused to support Columbus' offer to voyage westward, as the Portuguese previously knew of the islands in the New World, having already explored and colonized them for some years, not to mention the sea routes around Africa, and were jeal¬ously guarding this information as regnal trade secrets, punishable by death if they were revealed.  And yet, Columbus may even had sailed west in 1485, on a secretive voyage sponsored by Pope Innocent VIII, visiting the island of Antilia.<br /><br />But, Bartolomeu Dias' voyage of 1487 around the Cape and the subsequent unauthorized and incorrect copying of his maps by the Italian Henricus Martellus blew the lid off of this secrecy.  The egregious inaccuracies of the maps have been attributed to Columbus' brother Bartholomew, deliberately showing that no sea route to China from India was possible.  Columbus himself took this misinformation to Spain, and persuaded Ferdinand and Isabella that he alone had the knowledge to get to China by a westward passage across the Atlantic.  The rest should have been history, except that--and this is not found in Menzies' extensive references--the 19th century American essayist and historian Washington Irving almost single-handedly created the Columbus Day observance out of whole cloth, whitewashing the misdeeds of his hero while fabricating a new-fashioned tradition.<br /><br />The islands in the western Atlantic marked on the 1428 World Map--the same year Joan of Arc led the French army against the English--which was brought from Italy in that year by the Portuguese regent Dom Pedro, son of João I, were commissioned by Henry the Navigator in 1431 to be rediscovered, explored, and perhaps colonized, sending his admiral Gonzalo Velho Cabral in search of these landfalls.  The major island in the group established by Portuguese that same year was named Antilia, modern-day Puerto Rico, the colonists of which were still there when visited by Lisbon navigators in 1447.  In fact, Andrea Bianco's 1436 map of the Atlantic also shows the Sargasso Sea, a vast seaweed-choked area in the mid-Atlantic that could only have been mapped by visiting seamen.  But who were these mariners?<br /><br />The four fleets--collectively termed the Sixth Voyage--sent out by Emperor Zhu Di (Yong Le) early in 1421 were commanded by the eunuch Admiral Zheng He, who himself remained in the Asian sphere while his four eunuch sub-admirals, Hong Bao, Zhou Man, Zhou Wen, and Yang Qing, collectively and respectively sailed to South America, Antarctica, Australia, and the Pacific, to the coasts of Africa and both coasts of North America, and into the North Atlantic and the Arctic.  These voyages extended over some two-and-a-half years, and of the over one hundred shallow-drafted treasure vessels,  warships, and supply junks sent out in 1421 only a handful returned late in 1423, considerably worse for wear.  Author Gavin Menzies, himself an experienced naval officer, gives a detailed description of each admiral's expedition, which we won't recount here since the author himself describes an exquisite elaboration.<br /><br />But no heroes welcome greeted these returning seafarers, as the educated Confucian mandarins had in the interim acceded to domination over a dying and powerless emperor and who had always considered the voyages a scandalous waste of assets.  The emperor had already committed vast resources in repairing and adding to the Great Wall that was first built in the 3rd century BC and fallen into disrepair for centuries.  He engaged hundreds of thousands of artisans and workers by moving the capital to Beijing and reconstructing the complex begun by the Mongol Kublai Khan into what became the Forbidden City, and by denuding whole forests of hardwoods to build trade ships and grain barges for domestic and foreign use, as well as for the Temple of Heaven and outer buildings within the Forbidden City.  All the kings and princes of the rich provinces of India, Africa, and the Middle East had been summoned to the dedication, but European monarchs were considered too backward and unenlightened to invite.<br /><br />Within two months after the outset of the voyages, disaster struck.  The newly built palace in the Forbidden City, completed with no expense spared, was struck by lightning during an awesome thunderstorm and set afire.  The emperor's favorite concubine died in the conflagration, sending him into a grief-stricken self-imposed seclusion, exacerbating the effects of his previous strokes leaving the Son of Heaven in ill-health and gravely frail.<br /><br />Subsequently, upon return of the ships, their official records were seized by the Confucians, and upon Zhu Di's death his son Zhu Gaozhi reinstated the imperious mandarins. and followed in turn by his son Zhu Zhanji, who intensified the line of an agrarian China with a policy of increasing isolation--a position which continued until the Qing (Manchu) Dynasty took control in 1644 and systematically destroyed the archives leaving no certified chronicle of the four separate voyages of exploration, and China itself went into a profound isolationist seclusion.<br /><br />In 1423 the highly educated and elite mandarins were still smarting from their loss of influence when Zhu Di wrested the kingdom from his nephew Zhu Yunwen twenty years before, aided by the eunuch insurgents.  There was no love lost between the Confucian mandarins and the Muslim eunuchs.  The lowly eunuchs were often privy to the inner secrets of the palace as well as influence that aroused hostile envy among the mandarins, even while they enjoyed prestige and position under Zhu Yunwen and the previous emperors.  So, the details of the otherwise well-documented history of the voyages were scattered but not completely lost, even after the collapse of the Ming Dynasty.  Fortuitously, the detailed methods of navigation, the Wu Pei Chi, were among the few records that survived the pogrom.<br /><br />However, with the survival of some records along with several copies of maps scattered across the civilized world, pieces of the puzzle are just now beginning to take shape.  Voyages of trade among the sea¬faring peoples of medieval Africa, India, Indonesia, and the Middle East were themselves not without maps and charts, many gleaned from those of the meticulous Chinese explorers.  These are the Catalan atlas of 1376, the Kangnido map of 1420, the Zuane Pizzigano of 1424, the Genoese map of 1457, the Fra Mauro of 1459, the bogus Martellus of 1489, the Alberto Cantino of 1502, the Martin Waldseem&uuml;ller of 1507, the Piri Reis of 1513,  and the Jean Rotz of 1542, among others.<br /><br />There were also the small colonies of Chinese and Asiatic peoples left abandoned in various ports and islands around the globe, hopeful of rescue by returning countrymen, a deliverance which never came.  These voyagers planted seeds, animals, and people wherever they went, and also left artifacts and inscribed stones in evidence of their passing.  They, moreover, removed like samples of the places visited, such as fine Aztec porcelains, New World yams, and even the now extinct South American mylodon (depicted on the Piri Reis map).<br />The rumored presence of such people in the Americas prior to the celebrated voyages of Columbus, not to mention the later ones of Giovanni Verrazano and Amerigo Vespucci, inter alios, might have persuaded Columbus that China was closer than it really was by sailing west across the Atlantic.  But, knowing the perfidy of Columbus, it might have merely been another justification for his and his brother's deception with the king and queen of Spain.<br /><br />The Columbus cult, perhaps initiated early in the 19th Century, denies any previous contact with the Americas by other cultures, or even voyagers, except perhaps for occasional unfortunate Vikings who were somehow blown off course--despite the fact that prevailing winds and currents are in the wrong direction.  All the surviving maps--or copies of earlier pre-Columbian drafts--are either considered suspect or outright forgeries.  And yet, Ferdinand Magellan made sail around Cape Horn below Tierra del Fuego at the nethermost tip of SouthAmerica with the foreknowledge that such passage was possible, not to mention the information available to Henry the Navigator early in the 15th century.<br /><br />The Jean Rotz map of 1542, included in his Boke of Ideography presented to Henry VIII, depicted Australia two centuries before Capt. James Cook discovered it.  A copied portion of the now lost 1428 World Map, showing a portion of South America and Antarctica. had been taken from the effects of a mariner, who had previously sailed with Columbus, when the unfortunate sailor's ship was captured by the Ottomans around 1513, and this part was then incorporated into the map of Admiral Piri Reis.  The Cantino map of 1502 had unusually correct longi¬tudes of East Africa within some 30 miles accuracy over a thousand miles of coastline, a precision not yet known to the Portuguese mariners, despite the earlier voyages of Vasco da Gama, Pedro &Agrave;lvares Cabral, and Diego Dias.<br /><br />The controversial Vinland map (also called the Yale map), ostensibly from 1420-1440 and depicting high northern latitudes of eastern North America and Greenland, couldn't have been drawn by Norsemen as they had an oral rather than a literary tradition, and so it too was considered suspect.  Walter McCrone, the late physical chemist and critic of the map, and personally known to this reviewer, considered it a forgery because of the presence of anatase in the ink.  Anatase is one crystalline form of titanium dioxide, first produced commercially around 1920, and now permeating the global environment because of its widespread use in latex paints.  (Rutile is the other more naturally prevalent crystalline form of titanium dioxide, often found in beach sand.)<br />Furthermore, the black ink outline of the Vinland map overlays a yellow line, giving the appearance of antiquity by the \\"bleeding\\" of the black ink over time.  But, unfortunately, the two ink lines were chemically determined not to be from the same bottle.  It's little wonder the critics thought it was a clever forgery.<br /><br />However, in counterargument, it is also known that cartologists often draw a light colored outline before detailing with a darker ink, and in the instance of the Vinland map there is no such bleeding in evidence with the accompanying text.  It seems that the light yellow line itself is what has darkened with age.  Moreover, it was also discovered that anatase was occasionally found in inks used in medieval monasteries.  So the jury is still out on the Yale map.<br /><br />But then, according to Menzies, it was Admiral Zhou Wen who had the duty of sailing around Greenland after charting the eastern shores of North America.  And, amazingly, the Arctic climate in the early 15th Century was relatively ice-free and temperate enough for such an excursion.  But, according to various oceanographers, sealevels have been rising at the rate of two to four millimeters per year, so that over the last 600 years, submerged lands that are from four to eight feet under water today were then above sealevel.  This meant that for essentially ice-free Greenland and Arctic regions considerably more glaciation must have existed on the Antarctic continent and Tierra del Fuego, which is what Admirals Zhou Man and especially Hong Bao have noted in their South Pacific and Antarctic sectors.  (For the most part Yang Qing remained in the vicinity of the Indian Ocean.)<br /><br />Moreover, Zhou Wen himself touched on the northern shores of Iceland and then continued northward across the Arctic along the Siberian coast, and through the Bering Strait past Japan to his home port near Beijing.  Even in Columbus' own notes from his 1477 voyage it is stated, \\"Men have come here [to Iceland] from Cathay.\\"<br />The original Vinland map could only have been detailed by such a voyage during the summer of 1423, for an Atlantic hurricane had decimated his fleet earlier, forcing protracted layovers for repairs.  Furthermore, the map shows large areas of land that are today underwater, with particular emphasis on the so-called \\"Bimini Wall\\" that Zhou Wen may have had constructed for repair of his ships.

I especially enjoyed the battle scenes because he gave the reader both sides of the battle.  I can see why it took ten years to write.  I felt like I lost a good friend when David passed on.

B00005JLT5|5.0|The film is based on a true story and is set in World War II.  It centers around a world class pianist by the name of Wladyslaw Szpilman who survives the Holocaust with the help of Polish revolutionaries attempting to overthrow the Nazi occupation and with the courageous help from non-Jewish sympathizers.  You may have seen a number of movies on the Holocaust and ask yourself why torment yourself with another 2 hour horror - yet this movie places you in the seat - you loath the Nazi's along with Wladyslaw's brother as they separate the Jews from the rest of the population, make them wear armbands and re-settle in ghettos - you feel the fear of Wladyslaw's loving family as they climb about the transport train - you feel Wladyslaw's hunger and his dry mouth and lips after hiding out for days without food and hunger - and eventually you see how Wladyslaw is spared by the enemy, who at the end of it all is human.  This movie is incredibly difficult to watch in many scenes yet is unforgettable as it should be...
0061251305|5.0|I was initially put off by the title of this book, but once I started reading it i couldn't put it down. This is by far the best organizational behavior book I have ever come across and it literally changed the way I view my own company's culture, as well as those of our clients, and people I meet every day.<br /><br />The book is easy to read, and summaries of the key ideas at the end of each chapter make it easy to review, retain concepts, and implement their suggestions. I recommend spacing out the book by reading a chapter a day over a few weeks so you have time to reflect on the book's concepts and really digest the material. I've recommended this book to all my co-workers, clients, colleagues, and partners at my firm.  A must have!
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|This is a superb film . . .very independent, produced on a tiny budget--the director actually gave his salary to the two lead actors.  Neither Glen Hansard or Marketa Irglova is a trained or experienced actor . . .both are singer/songwriters, and they are absolutely brilliant.  This film will inspire even the hardest of hearts.  No one needed to be \\"perfect\\" or \\"experienced,\\" because you feel like you are watching a moment of two people's lives, very natural and real.  And the main song from the movie, \\"Falling Slowly,\\" won a well-deserved Academy Award--it's one of those gems of a song that comes along very, very rarely and changes your life.  If I could give the film 100 stars, I would.  Highly recommended!  ~Amy R.

0618680004|2.0|Quite an effort in collecting all kinds of incidents, articles and sayings, all with the purpose of showing how bad the idea of a God is, and how unfashionable and harmful religion can be.  I started reading, expecting that the evidence will soon converge into a real decisive conclusion; it took me up to page 50 to realize that the author himself is not very sure about what he is promoting.  The author ranked the human judgment about the existence of God along a spectrum scale of 1 to 7, one being for those who are 100 per cent believers in the existence of God, and the seven is for those with total disbelief, and he simply said \\"I count myself in category 6, but leaning toward 7\\", that translates into a 70% to an 85% degree of certainty, in other words he is not really sure about what he is talking about.  The book is not a serious scholarly study, nothing compared to what people like Morton Smith or Bart Ehrman did write, it may be read as some kind of malicious dark rant that carry no much weight other than the \\"strong feelings\\" of a person who just hates religion and can't stand the idea of a God.   I just have two words of advice:  1- Mr. Dawkins; if after your \\"investigative\\" effort you are not quite sure about what you are preaching, and you can't reconcile yourself to sit comfortably in your own \\"category 7\\", don't gleefully keep throwing all that mud, just go back and try to do a better job in convincing yourself first.  2- To the potential reader/buyer of the book; you may consider reading this book if at one time in your life you enjoyed listening to an old lady telling you how bad her neighbors whom she so dislikes are.
0575077174|4.0|There aren't too many authors that do epic science fiction well and Alastair Reynolds is certainly one of them.  You can't get much more epic than this.  Six million years in the future and spanning the whole galaxy.  Quite a departure from the \\"Revelation Space\\" universe.    There is no warp drive in this universe though.  You only stay youthful by means of relativistic time dilation and a type of stasis that slows the passage of time.  There is still plenty of awe inspiring technology however.    The main characters are the \\"shatterlings\\" who started out as clones of various family lines at the start of the star faring age.  We are mainly concerned with the \\"Gentian\\" Line whose originator was Abigail Gentian whose own story is told in a series of interludes.  Each line started with 1000 clones and their mission has been to circle the galaxy doing various good works and trading with the sometimes highly modified human civilizations that have grown up along the way.  After every galactic circuit the shatterlings of each line meet to share their experiences.    Campion and Purslane are two of the Gentian line who have become romantically involved which is not the done thing with shatterlings.  At the start of the story they are on their way to the latest reunion where they expect to be censured for violating line protocol.  They have also picked up a mysterious robot passenger called Hesperus.  A distress call is received: most of the Gentian line has been wiped out by an attack on the reunion.  The survivors, together with Campion and Purslane regroup on another planet where they try to understand what has happened.  The resolution reveals some unpleasant truths that have previously been suppressed from everyone's collective memory.    Overall this is a fine far future science fiction story but it falls just short of five stars in my opinion.  One issue was the ending which seemed slightly flat to me.  Reynold's recent book \\"The Prefect\\" was better in my opinion butthere is no doubt that Mr Reynolds is a fine talent in this world where hard science fiction seems to be becoming increasingly scarce.
B00139XZF4|3.0|I didn't read the book.  The story was easy enough to follow, it just didn't gel and seemed to jump to quickly from scene to scene leaving absolutely no time for character development.  The real pupose of my review is to comment on the actual video quality of the Blu-ray edition.  I own a couple dozen Blu-ray disks and have rented at least as many more.  This is by far the best looking picture I have seen.  The colors are amazing and the dark shadow scenes (of which there are many) look fantastic.  The blacks are very black while shadow detail is still present.  I am sending the video from a PS3 to a Panasonic PT-AE2000U projector.  If you like this movie I would highly recommend getting it on Blu-ray!  It's now my reference disk for showing off my home theater's HD video capabilities - the surround sound audio is great (standard DTS), but I don't have a pre/pro or receiver capable of decoding the DTS-HD soundtrack.  I'm sure it's even better.
B000YIGNKE|2.0|I was quite disappointed in this adaption of \\"Persuasion\\", which is by far my favorite Austen novel, but where do I start with the problems?<br /><br />1.  Mary is silly and lacks the overweening need to be the center of attention and class consciousness. This version lacked those elements that made Mary stand out as an illustration of class consciousness.<br /><br />2.  I adore Anthony Head but I did not think him well suited to play the Baronet. There was none of the mincing foppishness that characterizes the Baronet in the book. Instead Head is angry all the time.<br /><br />3.  Anne would never run around Bath without a wrap and hat after the captain nor would she be so emotional. Anne controlled herself throughout everything, except when she stopped the captain to ask if he wouldn't stay for the concert. She also did not ask him to the concert but ran into him by his design.<br /><br />Outside of the cinematography, the rearrangement of the plot was contrived and heavy on the romance without regard for the social commentary that is an integral part of Austen's books. The actors, while quite attractive, were miscast, outside of Benwick and Anne, and Anthony Head with a better script and more foppish characterization.<br /><br />I was very disappointed and the 1995 version of \\"Persuasion\\" was much better all around. Note to director: Don't mess with perfection.

B00005JPNZ|2.0|INDIANA JONES AND THE CRYSTAL SKULLS has all the elements of the series: the whip, the sarcasm, the heroics, the cobwebs, the puzzles, Karen Allen, but at the same time, shoots itself in the foot with over-the-top stunts (even for Indiana Jones) and surprisingly enough... a lack of creativity.<br /><br />There were great things about THE CRYSTAL SKULLS. The opening moments in the warehouse were top notch Indiana Jones. Cate Blanchett was phenominal. In fact, the nuclear city and the diner were interesting, funny and good leads in to an adventure movie. Karen Allen's return put a smile across my face. The graveyard scene was excellent as the skeletons seem to emerge from the dark crevaces of the multi-layered cemetary.<br /><br />Yet, then there were the moments that were so ridiculous, even for Indiana Jones, that the stunt and effect had the exact opposite effect that the Directors intended... at least on this viewer. The first... was the motorcycle sliding under the tables in the library. Then the kid apparently didn't hear the motorcycle or the commotion looks up from his book. Wow. That was bad.<br /><br />The waterfalls... 3 of them. Everybody just crawls back into the boats and goes on with business. Silly. A swordfight as Mutt Williams stradles 2 jeeps racing through the jungle. Yet, the biggest turn off of the entire film was a scene where Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) decides to drive off a cliff. I know that the point was to show that she has just as much balls as Indiana Jones, but... she drives off the cliff as if she had it planned ahead of time that the tree branch 100 feet down would catch them... lower them down to the water gently and then swing back up and hit the soldiers climbing the cliff wall. The whole thing was ridiculous as it gets.<br /><br />Then of course there was the ending that was way too similar to RAIDERS. Couldn't they have thought of something new?<br /><br />I guess my biggest gripe is that names like SPIELBERG and LUCAS would be so shameless as to stoop to the cheap thrills level that EMMERICH, BAY and WISEMAN do with their summer movies.

B00003CXA2|5.0|RUN FORREST RUN!  Run right out and buy this one.  I have watched this movie at least 20 times.  How can anyone not love Forrest?
B000YABYLA|5.0|Both my girls (ages 14 and 17) thought this movie was fantastic.  I had my doubts but I must admit, the movie wasn't glamorized, Ellen Page captured the way teen-agers think and talk, and the relationship and support of the step-mom and dad were great.
B0015519VS|2.0|when i bought this CD i wasn't so nieve as to think that it was going to be as good as confessions. but i did expect something a little better then what i got it was truly the songs of a man in love and though it was sweet it was disappointing to his many fans that are so use to his work that is very upbeat and can truly get u dancing. so i wouldn't recommend this CD to anyone expecting anything close to Confessions
B0010OMXKA|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed both the DVD and CD in this package.  The concert is a joy to listen to and to watch as the various artists join Andrea Bocelli in his native Tuscany. There is a wonderful mix of musical genre with many talented artists that guarantee you will find something to enjoy.  Being able to take the CD along with me simply extends the delight of the music as I call to mind the video images from the concert as I listen.
B000P0J05G|5.0|Army of Darkness is one of the best cheesy classic \\"Horror\\" movies of all time.  Especially for 13 bucks this is a must pick up hd-dvd
B000LPS3B2|5.0|I've watched a number of Asian horror films, and at times have found them to be unsettling, but sometimes lacking a coherent story to give the scenes context. \\"Shutter\\" puts to rest any such notion. Despite being created by a couple of twenty somethings, this is mature filmmaking at its finest. It's tension comes not from special effects or gore, but from a truly fascinating (if not original) plot involving engaging characters, mysterious photos, a vengeful spirit, and the impact of past decisions on the present day.     Tun and Jane are the primary characters, who accidentally hit a pedestrian on the way home from a dinner party, then leave the scene without offering any assistance. Their lives, and those of their friends, are soon in disarray as disturbing images appear in photos taken in and around their college campus. Soon, friends begin dying as a result of apparent suicides, and we learn of a sordid incident in the past that Tun had dared not reveal to Jane. We are also introduced to the idea of spirits appearing in photographs (apparently with real photos that are acknowledged in the credits), giving credence to the idea that Tun and Jane are being haunted by the ghost of the woman that appears in the pictures. The search for an explanation and a solution is suspense at its finest, as the tension built between the characters and by the storyline is masterful and palpable.    The fright factor is also significant, as the ghostly appearances are often surprising and not without some element of shock. The use of lighting and shadows is well done, and the acting (granted, it is subtitled) more than capably enhances the sense of urgency and fear. The use of the female apparition, now an Asian genre staple, is more effective here than I've ever seen, as her presence leaves an indelible impression on the viewer.     This is one movie you'll think about even after the credits roll, as the ending is one you'll not find in American films. It's not uplifting or heartfelt, but it is a satisfying conclusion that unifies all the themes present in the film. I highly recommend, even if subtitles annoy you :)
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|The story is wonderful - how interesting how invested you get in a serial killer - you really want him to \\"win\\".  The acting is great - love Michael Hall - All the Characters are done well and explained well.  The banter & conversations are smart & witting except when they shouldn't be.  Great Series.
1594489505|5.0|I first read The Kite Runner and was amazed.  I loved it deeply and felt really connected to the characters, and then I read this book.  I honestly picked this book up and said, there is no way that it can be as good.  I was right, it was better.  This book is a fantastic journey with two exceptional women that I came to love and care for and feel connected to on some level.  Every woman should read this book as we need to identify with our fellow women across the world.  This book literally brought me to sobbing and I am not a sappy gal.  Everyone that I have recommended this book to has absolutely loved it!
B000000HU1|5.0|Once again, I'm assigned the crazy task of trying to describe a Gong album.  Actually, it's not as hard as it might seem.  Most of their albums have more or less the same idea- crazy, unusual horn sections that sound both obnoxious and circus-like mixed with far out space rock/haunting female vocals that seem to echo throught your head.  It's this very combination that results in a sound and style that really is quite unlike anything else.    While I feel the songs near the beginning of You (Radio Gnome Invisible, Pt. 3) don't flow together very well, it's impossible to ignore the amount of creative ideas that are both relentless and diverse that constantly shift through the album.  One minute I'm at a circus, the next I'm sailing through the solar system.      Much of the album had what I like to call \\"atmospheric melodies\\".  A sound that creates an atmosphere, and keeps your attention at the same time.  I believe the Alan Parsons Project were influenced by this band quite a lot after hearing songs like \\"A Sprinkling of Clouds\\".      What's really strange is when the band goes completely jazz, it really DOES sound like as close to jazz a rock band can get (and even calling these guys \\"rock\\" sounds strange, doesn't it?)  This band has a very natural ability to play jazzy music.  I can't help but get caught up in the haunting female voices, that seem to sail ever so gently in the background during certain songs.    \\"The Isle of Everywhere\\" is the ULTIMATE song.  Really, it is.  It's the best song ever made.  It has a suspenseful atmosphere, jazzy solos, and a frantic guitar jam near the end that amazes me every time I hear it.  It's the kind of song that NEVER gets old, even after many listens.  It's a masterpiece of a song.  The final song is the longest one on the album, at over 11 minutes.  I like it too, for the most part.  Experimental?  You betcha.  It reminds me of a zoo, for some reason.      Oh, and the album sounds fantastic, thanks to the updated recordingequipment used in the mid 70's.  Doesn't sound dated at all if you ask me.  It's a great album and perfect music for those of you who like experimental jams or atmospheric sections.
0316067601|3.0|I enjoyed this book, but it is not one I would want to read again.  Nearly the entire first half is a detailed  - too detailed - description of SEAL training.  After about ten pages, I thought, \\"I get it.  SEAL training is hard.  Got it.\\"    The story of the author's adventures once he lands in Afghanistan and his subsequent rescue is exciting and (just barely) makes the first half of the book worth wading through.  I also found interjections of his political views a bit off-putting, not because I disagree or agree with his views, they just seemed out of place in a story about his thrilling adventures.  I felt their interjection detracted from the story he had to tell.    The most irritating thing in the book, though, is the author's ignorance of which companies manufactured the aircraft he flew in.  Every plane he flew in was referred to as a \\"Boeing\\" as well as the jet engines in the planes he was in.  For example, the C-130 and the C-141 are not Boeing aircraft, they were made by Lockheed.  In addition, Boeing does not make engines at all but purchases them from GE, Pratt & Whitney and other companies just as does Lockheed, Northrop, etc.  These easily verified errors made me wonder what other errors exist that I missed?  One is left wondering just how much work was put into editing this book.    I very much enjoyed his description of the Battle of Murphy's Ridge and his very charming description of his days with the Pashtun villagers.  His recognition of their humanity and basic decency was heart-warming.  I admire the tenacity he displayed and his loyalty to the memories of his dead comrades.  But I still believe that the book would have been improved with a more attentive editor.
0452289963|5.0|I have read many books that claimed to have the keys to happiness in your life but this one delivered.  I cannot recommend it highly enough.  Everyone is different and not everyone will find the book as amazing as I have but everyone should read it at least once.  Tolle has written about complex behaviors at work within each of us in a down to earth, easy to understand way.  In my case, it felt like he knew the secret me and had been inside my head to hear what my inner voice was saying. A lifetime of egoic behavior that had resulted in unhappiness I thought I couldn't control was revealed to me within this book.  The moment I understood what was happening inside me the unhappiness vanished.  Book of the century for young and old alike.
0440238609|5.0|This is an amazing collection, I originaly purchased these books after watching the movie \\"The Golden Compass\\" which is the first book in this collection. The way the movie was written is leaves you up in the air at the end of the movie wanting more so when I found out the movie was based on a book and there was a series I purchased them immediatly.     I am a new mother and I do not read much but of coarse if I want my daughter to read I need to show her it is fun so I was looking for a fun and easy to read story and this is it.   These books keep me turning the page, I would compair the type of story to \\"The lord of the rings\\" the writer has a great imagination. I feel like I really know the characters.  The story begins in a world similar to ours but different, the largest difference is that the characters spirit or soul is not inside their body but it portraid as an animal that talks and travels with them, adults \\"demon\\" (which is what they are called in the book) stay the same but childrens demon change based upon how they feel or the circumstances. This demon like a spirit or a soul determins your personality, and if the demon hurts the person hurts.     I am trying to be very careful not to tell you too much but my parents told me about the story and that is what made me so interisted.   The first book is basicaly about an experiment where the seperate the demon from the child in order to maintain control of their adult behavior. I will stop there because I can go on all day.    I would recomend this series to anyone adult or child with an imagination, it is easy reading and is a wonderful story, bravo to the writer he has made me LOVE reading again.
B00006J3WH|5.0|Wasn't actually to thrilled with the pictures, but I bought the CD for the music. It was awesome. Those actors have some great voices. Would like to see a collection of all of Anthony Stewart Head's singing from the show but... I won't hope too much. Hey Joss! You make it available, I'll buy it! Highly recomend this soundtrack to any who loved the episode!
B000OV170W|5.0|Although I am only 13 years old, I enjoyed My Sister's Keeper so much! Since the main character Anna is 13, I felt really comfortable reading this book and could really imagine what it would be like to be in her situation. My mom loves all of Jodi Picoult's books and she recommended that I read My Sister's Keeper. At first I was a little wary about reading such a long book that is meant for adults, but I ended up loving it! I read the book in less than a day and I understood every single word of it. I think that all kids would be able to understand this book and they would most likely enjoy it as much as I did! I hope this review helped you understand what it was like for a young girl to read this book.
B00008A7QK|5.0|T.Rex-Electric Warrior *****<br /><br />In a nutshell Electric Warrior is one of the greatest and most important records in rock n' roll history. Countless bands form or changed their approach because of this album alone. 1 part glam, 1 part folk, and three parts excess and you have T.Rex's masterpiece, Electric Warrior.<br /><br />In terms of glam, Marc Bolan's 1971 opus is on par with Bowie's Ziggy Stardust, who could have even learned a few things from this.<br /><br />From the first high-healed stomp of 'Mambo Sun' through the beautiful pop balladry of 'Cosmic Dancer' on through the rollicking 'Jeepster' and 'Planet Queen' and the  indulgent 'Life's A Gas' and the closing of the bitter sweet 'Rip Off' This is one of those albums that you can't even comprehend making or dream of making because it is not plausible, it simply just happens out of nowhere.<br /><br />To say that 'Bang A Gong (Get It On)' is the focal point of the album would be more than cliche, but at the same time I dare anyone to find it's contemporary, because even on a flawless album such as this it still reigns supreme and triumphs over all. It's half-pick guitar riff, and evocative imagery make it one of rocks most celebrated and covered tunes.<br /><br />Electric Warrior is simply put...that good, and this reissue is THE definitive version. With extensive liner notes, lyrics, a poster. Great sound, and plenty of bonus material. All bonus songs are excellent and top shelf as is the rare included interview which closes the album. So yes is this worth buying another Electric Warrior version, yes, it is essential!
B0002EXH54|1.0|I'm reviewing the remastering of this album. Megadeth certainly isn't one of my favorite bands, nor is Metallica. I listen to them every now and then, but that's really it. Why should you care? Well, you shouldn't. haha but seriously, Megadeth never got the critical acclaim Metallica did. Also the musicianship of Metallica is far superior to Megadeth. Metallica have a tightness about the way they play together. Now I think that Kirk Hammett is overated, but even so Metallica is a much better band.<br /><br />What sets Megadeth apart is their sound. Metallica always sounded very polished, but Megadeth had a very crass sounding. The guitars were always overily distorted and angry, the drums sound flat but absolutely shred and Dave's voice is in the background where it should be. There's nobody that would argue that Dave is a good singer, but his voice is Megadeth. His voice is creepy, like an Alice Cooper type voice that just adds to the creepiness of their albums. A Megadeth album is like a slasher movie.<br /><br />BUT.... When you listen to the remastered album everything becomes to perfect. The guitars have lost their edge, the vocals no longer blend in but stand out and there is more bass. It's just not Megadeth. Megadeth is loud and in your face and not polished. It's supposed to be abrasive. But Dave has remixed the albums and taken the shine away from them. Instead of being a politically fueled punch in the face, it's just another metal album. The CD's sound better they way the first came out. They'd probably even sound better on a record because of all the extra noise. It's those little things that make it a Megadeth album.<br /><br />Dave will always be trying to one up Metallica. It's just the way it is. Like their later stuff, the remix is a yawn. Dave once said about Youthanasia \\"Try and find a mistake in the album. You won't\\" It's that in your face, I don't care attitude the album has lost and that's what makes it cool.
0452289963|5.0|I wish everyone in the world could have the chance to read this book. I have spent the last 25 years on and off persuing my quest for awakening and have studied with some very learned teachers and must say most of the truths I have been given are in this book so simply and eloqently written.  Thanks
B00005JKEZ|5.0|What can I add to what has already been said about this film.  But, there is some perspective I would like to give regarding Mr. Flynn.    Errol Flynn was not regarded as a good actor by many people.  He never received an Oscar but was a much better actor than he got credit for.  How many people could have played this role?  When you look at Flynn's career, Captain Blood, The Sea Hawk especially, but also his later roles, he was a very good actor who was just not given the opportunity to move beyond that style.  When he did Elizabeth and Essex (with Bette Davis), she didn't want him because she said he was not an actor.  I totally disagreed with that.  He was good.  Of course, in Robin Hood, he had some very good people around him like Basil Rathbone, Claude Rains (John Gieguld's teacher at RADA), Olivia (who was an extremely good actress besides good looking) and Paulette as Friar Tuck.      The music was great, the script was great but what made this movie was Errol Flynn.  He was the center of the picture and he carried it.  Of course, it was an ensemble picture, but Flynn was very good.  He was a natural actor.  In Charge of the Light Brigade, or even Santa Fe Trail, he was much better than he was given credit for.  I think because, like Robert Mitchum, he was never caught acting.  There are actors like that and he was one of them.  Curtiz, the director, saw this in him and it is no coincidence that he directed him in his greatest performances.      An especially good scene in the film is where Errol Flynn enters the castle in the major opening scene.  Cagney?  I don't think so.  It took someone who not only had the look but the ability to project that look from inside the character.  Not only did he do it, he did it well.      As movie historians know, Errol Flynn did not like the way he fenced in the Sea Hawk.  He took lessons and became very good.  Being a good fencer is a staple for British classical actors, but Flynn really had to learn and he did it well.Unlike Richard Greene (who played Robin Hood in the TV series and was captain of his school's fencing team), Flynn took it to heart that he looked like an amateur next to Basil Rathbone (who was a great fencer) in his first film.      Although Errol Flynn's personal life matched his life on stage, and he died young because of his lifestyle, one only has to think of Robin Hood and know that he was born to play this role, and it would be this role that keep him alive for years after his career was over.
0393324818|5.0|I so love the work of Michael Lewis because this story, and another favorite, [[ASIN:0140143459 Liar's Poker: Rising Through the Wreckage on Wall Street]], are essentially about stepping back to consider groupthink.  Groupthink is a topic that fascinates me.  I haven't read [[ASIN:0140296468 The New New Thing: A Silicon Valley Story]], but it's about startups and silicon valley?  Hmmmm... it might be about groupthink too.  I'll check it out this weekend.<br /><br />In Moneyball, Lewis examines the effects an outsider can have on the group, in this case, Major League Baseball.  That's an extremely high level but, if you're like me, that's about all you need to know.  Even if you don't care for baseball, I think you'll enjoy Moneyball.  You might even be angry that Congress and the media give so much time to baseball.  Since baseball is hard to avoid in America, I think people should try to understand it better.  And even the most die hard, stat-loving baseball geek I know learned things from reading Moneyball.  So whether you're a total insider to baseball, or a complete outsider to baseball, I think you should read, and that you'll enjoy, Moneyball.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|This movie is probably one of the most \\"make-me-feel-good\\" gay-themed movies that I have ever seen and overall a very satisfying experience. What I love about this movie is that it doesn't give the usual cliche of traumatic past or tortured soul ... it is plain sweet, sexy, and down-to-earth. Added with luscious backdrops of San Pedro beaches, surfings, sunsets, AND AMAZING soundtrack - this is basically what gay-themed movies I have long wished for.     Because falling in love could be gentle, beautiful and rewarding - even among M/M. Sometimes there is no need for over-the-top or dramatic situation. This movie is also a story about commitment to other family members and acceptance of one's sexual preference over the other.     Both main actors make the relationship work and truly believable. The sex is romantic and sensual without having to show full body nudity. When it comes to that first love making, you can feel the tension that lead up to there and it's perfect. There are also those scenes where both characters just stay in bed, look into each other's eyes ...     It sizzles ALL the way through ... and worth watching more than once. I recommended it to another friend and she loved it as much as I do. So yeah, this is one well rec'd movie.    The only complain that I have is the length of the movie. In only 85 minutes, this movie is just TOO DA*N SHORT!
0312305060|5.0|This is an exceptionally well crafted and well written novel, deserving of the Pulitzer Prize.  The author ties together the stories of three very different women living in three very different time periods, but who share a common lineage.  And, more importantly, the women share the ultimate quandary of the human condition:  getting through the hours of the day in some meaningful way.      Suicide pervades all three stories.  I don't agree that the book is ultimately a downer, especially given the affirming character of Clarissa, who seems to get through the hours in a positive and admirable way.      The most haunting story is that of Lara -- the 1950's housewife with the \\"perfect\\" husband and home who is deeply dissatisfied and alienated.  Is the author holding her up as what-not-to-do, as a negative foil to Clarissa's more positive approach to life?  Perhaps, though I find Lara somehow attractive and wish her story were more developed in the novel.  Ms. Moore's performance of the character in the movie, which is largely faithful to the book, perhaps also influences me and makes the character more intriguing.     A first rate novel.  The movie is also first rate.  I recommend both.
1400032717|5.0|Be careful! The emotional impact of this story sneaks up on you. Told from the point of view of 15-year-old, autistic Christopher Boone, Mark Haddon's The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time leads you to believe that it is going to be a mystery when Christopher decides to investigate the murder of his neighbor's dog, Wellington, who he finds dead with a pitchfork through his side. What happens beyond this plot point is an amazing study into the needs and struggles of those who suffer from \\"special needs\\" and their families.    I want to say that I was pleasantly surprised by this book, but the surprise wasn't necessarily pleasant. Haddon has created an amazing book that has an unbelievable emotional pull that will leave you both shocked and sympathetic for the characters. It is a fast read, but very well crafted.
0061537934|5.0|[[ASIN:0061537934 The Art of Racing in the Rain]]  This novel, by Garth Stein, is easily the best book I have EVER READ;  at the age of 56, and having read hundreds of books, that is saying a lot!!!  You might think that a story told by a dog, about his life and that of his master's, would be \\"hokey,\\" but I SWEAR it is anything but.  Enzo and his human companion Denny, live through many tough challenges.  The story is so beautifully and heart-wrenchingly told, that I felt all the pain that the book's characters were feeling. This book permanently changed for me, the way I look at my own companion, Benny, my Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.  During the last hour or more of reading the final chapters, I cried so hard that my husband asked if I was OK?  Only one other favorite book came slightly close to touching this one;  \\"Charlotte's Web,\\" and I cried a child's tears then, when Charlotte the spider died.  Give this book to everyone you know, male OR female.  What a great read!!!  I will read everything this author writes!!!!  GARTH STEIN ROCKS!!!!  Please make this into a movie!!!!!!!!!!!
0425200477|5.0|I'm still relatively new to the world of Agatha Christie as The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is only the third book that Dame Agatha wrote that I have read. I've heard that she has been known to reuse plot devices and that sometimes, some of her stories can become repetitive, but if they are all written like The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, I would be happy with that. This will easily top my list of favorite books.    I don't want to go into too much detail, as I'm always afraid that I'll let something slip that will spoil the end of the story for newcomers to Christie's writing. The book is so complex that I wouldn't even know where to begin. There is a suicide, blackmail, cocaine abuse, secrets and of course, murder. In his usual flair, Hercule Poirot (who happens to be in the right place at the right time) is brought in to investigate. Through the course of the book, suspicion is plainly brought on each of the main characters in the Ackroyd household, and you will never have a clue as to \\"who done it\\" until the very end. Every chapter, I was sure I knew who had committed the murder, yet every time I was wrong. An ingenious book.
B0007MWZEK|3.0|It was a little louder than we thought it would be.  It does a pretty good job of sweeping, not as good as a powerful vacuum cleaner.  We are pleased with it, though.  The kids don't mind sweeping the floors when asked, because the Swivel Sweeper is fun to use.
0930289234|4.0|The only graphic novel on the list of 1001 books you should read in your lifetime, Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' Watchmen is an interesting deconstruction of the superhero mythos. The story is a little dated, as the original 12 issues were published in the late 80s and deal with more Cold War issues such as the constant immanent threat of nuclear war, but many of the questions raised would still be relevant today. It is also a study into what it takes to be a hero, and the lengths that one hero would go to to ensure world peace.<br /><br />The art is a little sparse, but it fits for the tone and feel of the story. Told in a more cinematic style, you should pay attention to the panel flow and the stories in the story to find hidden correlations in the story.<br /><br />Overall, even with the slightly dated material, it is an amazingly well thought out story, both in dialogue and the visual aspect of the story.

0316067598|5.0|This is a first class story about real American heros. The story is so well written it is very hard to put down. There was not a time the story dragged. It tells very well what we should be thinking and saying about the enemies of the United States and not worry about offending those who hate us. The author went through a nightmarish adverture in Afghanistan and makes it very clear that his buddies who did not make it upheld the finest traditions of the Unites States Military. The author did also, but does not boast at all as to the really heroic and honorable conduct by him. I was very sad and proud of the descriptions of how the members of the Seal Team fought very valiantly and how the author overcame the tremendous odds he faced in trying to survive long enough to be rescued by American troops.
0198326769|4.0|Well this is book for Young Adults and therefore I must admit that the style was a little bit problematic for me. I guess because I'm only an \\"adult\\". It's very simple, very on the level of the main character but after a while I get used to it and I might say that this naiveness was even charming. Big part of the book is like as if we are waiting something (big) to happens, the main thing but I wouldn't say the book is boring; again it was charming.<br />I usually find myself very irritated with the child character who is completely (and impossibly) ignorant about the things around them since it's usually not convincing at all. But I think he is one nice exception. Bruno is lovely constructed character and his views are very convincing. Occasional sparks from the world of adults are giving reader nice background picture and contrast with readers understandings and Bruno's ignorance (or misunderstandings) are really lovely. So, indeed Bruno is very likable \\"young man\\".<br /><br />I will not tell anything about plot but instead will type what it says on the back cover,probably the best book blurb I saw:<br /><br />\\"The story of The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas is very difficult to describe. Usually we give some clues about the bookon the cover, but in this case we think that would spoil the reading of the book. We think it is important that you start to read without knowing what it is about.<br /><br />If you do start to read this book, you will go on a journey with a nine-year-old boy called Bruno. (Though this isn't a book for nine-year-olds.) And sooner or later you will arrive with Bruno at a fence. Fences like this exist all over the world. We hope you never have to cross such a fence.\\"
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Excellent!  A bit grittier than is typical in many period pieces such as those by Jane Austen, but that only made it more believable.  In addition to enjoying a great drama, I also feel like I learned a bit about the divisions geographically in England during this time period with the up-and-coming innovative and industrial North (and Northern \\"ways\\" as it's put in the film) and the more pastoral South where money is made more in financial deals than in industry (in which a 'gentleman' would only \\"dabble\\" for entertainment, not something as crude as money, etc). Also, a great star-crossed romance around which all of this drama occurs.  I highly recommend this.  And, BTW it is set in England, not in the U.S. as many seem to think initially!
0671449028|3.0|This book is okay, but it doesn't seem to draw my 2-year-old's attention very much.  The storyline is interesting to him, but I believe it's the pictures that are not too appealing to a younger child, as they're more like a drawing rather than distinct separate animals, etc. that he can clearly see.<br /><br />I would buy something else :(
B0013D8LOK|4.0|The movie really grabs you, firstly the story line about injustice in a grimy London where the extremes of poverty meet the extremes of the high life of the time.    We have all at sometime heard about the actions of Sweeny Todd and the movie really illustrates this although rather gory!    Johnny Depp is one incredible actor and plays the part of Sweeny Todd as if he has a wee bit of Sweeny in him!!!!!!    While the movie is in essence a musical it's not for kids!
B00139XZF4|4.0|[[ASIN:B00139XZF4 The Golden Compass [Blu-ray]]] This movie is a little confusing at the start. If you have read the books you will know what is going on but if you haven't I suggest watching the movie a couple times to understand it better. The Blu-ray version as usual is outstanding when it comes to the video quality. It is a good movie and it moves rather fast. I had to watch it a few times to get the gist of what was going on but once you do you will enjoy it. I hope that they make the other two books into movies.

B000UJ48UO|5.0|I have always enjoyed this great movie and now that I am starting to use my Blue Ray player more often, I am glad to see a classic like this one on Blue Ray.
B000VWYNOG|5.0|This is one of the smoothest, best put together albums I have ever bought. And with 2500 albums in my collection that's saying a lot. I used to think that Van was a mumbler and most of his lyrics too hard to hear, but this album cleared it all up and I have a new respect for him. A great album!!!
B0013D8LCW|3.0|Wow, I can't believe all the five star reviews of this agonizingly slow film.  The film is technically very well made, and Trevor Wright's acting is wonderful (about the only thing going for it), but the movie seemed 5 hours long to me.  It took a half hour to get going and then moved at such a slow pace it was like it was stuck in slow motion to get to the very predictable conclusion.  This is not a movie I would want to watch a second time.  Disappointment.
B00164KYS2|5.0|The movie picked up nicely from the 3 year hiatus and oh I did miss them dearly.  The movie was full of laughter and heartache. The movie was awesome and I can't wait to buy it when it becomes available. I give it A++++.
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|Each track is unique and truly shows how versatile Donna Summer is. She is not just Queen of Disco but the Empress of Versatility ! I like Slide Over Backwards and Crayons in particular. And Stamp Your Feet sounds like a motivation anthem that is needed for trying times and should be a hit for 2008.
B000XUOIQ4|5.0|so many of the kids movies have such scary parts in them, this one did not.  it still has the \\"bad guy\\", but it doesn't terrify them.  this movie is wonderful, my 4 year olds absolutely loved it! the adore the little kitten marie and all of the great songs in the movie.
0380713802|5.0|Bill Bryson is so right on with the quirks of Europe.  It's a great read for those who've traveled there, because he can take you back to those moments and make you laugh.

B000ULQV0W|5.0|Uno de los mejores cd que compre en el ultimo tiempo. Si sos un fan de Pearl Jam , definitivamente debes comprar este disco. Eddie Veder en su estado mas salvaje!    One of the best cds that Ive ever listen in the last time. If you enjoy Pearl Jam as much as me, you definitely have to buy this album. Eddie Veder in his wildest side!!!!
B0015KO52S|4.0|I have to admit I was concerned that the band would not release a good second album but I was wrong. This is a better album than the first even though Im getting tired of Mr. White. The rest of the band has a lot of talent and makes me curious about their other bands.
032147404X|5.0|Other reviewers have noted Mr. Kelly's slightly odd sense of humor --- I really didn't mind it that much, and in fact it was pretty much entirely isolated to the intro to the book and the chapter intros, so if it bugs you just skip those  sections.  The rest of the book is full of fantastic tips, ranging from the obvious-to-anyone-who-has-taken-a-picture to those that made me go \\"Huh, I never would have thought of that.\\"    I guess my only complaint (if I had one) is that he never mentions any equipment I use (I have an Olympus dSLR).  To be fair, that doesn't really matter since his tips aren't equipment-specific (and he makes a point of mentioning it at some point), but it made me feel a little left out.    Unless you're a professional photographer, you'll probably learn some great stuff from this book, so it's well worth the really cheap price (plus it's chock-full of full color pretty pictures).
B0010V4TZU|4.0|This is a really good CD, Vampire Weekend has a neat style that reminds me of Indie meets India for some reason. I would buy another CD by them but this CD gets old after a few listen tos. I don't know why, its catch, bouncy, and they are really talented but it gets old real quick.
1401300529|5.0|It took me a long time to finish reading The Coldest Winter. I would read for a while and then leave it behind as I picked up another book only to find myself returning to another section of what is a really great book. The beauty of Halberstams book is that it has eleven parts which read as self contained essays. Frustrating some readers will be the lack of an overall narrative. I, for one, enjoyed how the book lacked narrative and each section stood alone, each building on the other like a string of short stories. The book reads neither as a political history or a military history but instead appears more personal. Personal to Halberstam as you can almost witness his surprise when his research discovers something he had just learned. And the book is personal to the stories of the front line troops that fought, bleed, and died in Americas forgotten war, Korea. Halberstam does a wonderful job of viewing the conflict from all sides. You find your with Mao and learn his motives, see Stalins influence and most important focus on General MacArthur, his ego, errors and politics. No book can replace the great AMERICAN CAESAR BY WILLIAM MANCHESTER as a biography. But Halberstam is not wanting too write a biography. Instead he follows MacArthurs decisions and views the results as implemented on the ground by a wide variety of United Nation troops. When you have completed the book you have a grand overview and a better perspective of where the Korean War fit in to the geo-politics of the day and was a steppingstone for the Republican Partys right wing who still today try and leverage the simplistic military solution to national security for political advantage. The heart breaking thing is the number of dead and the many on both sides lost due to poor leadership and missed calculations and missed opportunities. A large part of the end of the book is spent covering several important battles. However, the last two years of the war are covered quickly with only a short section on Pork Chop Hill. Mainly because all these battles were a war of attrition and a meat grinder approach. None, in the end, changed anything about the outcome. No doubt that when Halberstam met and interviewed Paul McGee the pulse and heart of the book was discovered. In the end my very favorable opinion and recommendation for this book is based on the fact that Halberstam is a gifted story teller on these pages. He brings you down to the personal no matter if its Mao, Truman, MacAurther or Paul McGee holding the perimeter against thousands of Red Chinese attacking his platoons position. Read it and you will be shaken.
B000ESST6U|5.0|The beautiful music of Handel is complemented by modern choreography. The performers are young and agile, as well as being wonderful singers. Opera the way I like it, a wonderful romp.
B000002KIC|2.0|Of course, the music for this concert CD rates a \\"5\\", but with the remastered version out, this version (pre-2002) is shown to be very limited in its fidelity.  I own this and just heard the remastered version (2003, 2-CD set) and I am blown away by the high quality of the remastered Last Waltz.  If you love The Band and The Last Waltz concert, the difference in sound quality of the remastered CD is worth the expenditure.
B0008ENICU|5.0|With its powerhouse of 1930s blockbuster ladies, this movie delivers a one-two punch: unbeatably clever dialogue and a cast of all women.  Although in many ways, it is a true \\"period piece\\" (with its beautiful Adrian clothes) and yes, women lives different lives today, it still rings true and its story and acerbic writing is just stellar and timeless.    Every part is perfectly cast and it is such a well put-together cinematic gem.  Don't miss it!    I saw this for the first time when I was about 14 (in the 70s) and I think teenage girls today might relate really well to it.  The Grande Dame of Chick Flicks!
B000AA4JMU|5.0|I love this music and this movie! The music is fabulous! The movie has some of my favorite movie quotes of all time! One of my favorites is, \\"These sausages is mouldy!\\" \\"Shut up and drink your gin!\\"
B0012E2HRC|5.0|Eastwood's tear jerker is finally released in definitive Edition.After the bare bone release (FULL PICTURE!!)years ago ,Warner finally considered this classic for a re-release.It has an audio commentary from the editor and the camera operator.There ares some nice docs and the film is presented in it's full wide screen glory and a new 5.1 Dolby track.  It's great to watch this wonderful movie as it was ment to seen.  Sit back and enjoy.
B0018QCXGY|3.0|It seems the good city of New York just can't get a break these days as the next big external threat comes to cinematically level the city... yet again.  As if global warming and terrorism wasn't enough.  \\"Cloverfield\\" is the military designation codename for an \\"LSA\\" or \\"Large Scale Agressor\\" scenario.  The film plays as a firsthand eyewitness video account of a Godzilla-type monster on shore leave in NYC.     If you can suspend the disbelief that no one in their right mind would continue to videotape while smack dab in the middle of such an unbelievablably monumental catastrophe, your enjoyment of this film might increase by a few marginal points.  The hand-held video camera style photography lends a realistic credibility to the proceedings but does nothing to promote any sharp picture resolution.  To me, the notion of rendering this movie in 1080p High Definition makes about as much sense as gold-plating one's toilet bowl.  You'll have the prettiest crapper on the block but so what?  The HD picture only serves to further augment the grainy pixilated imagery so common with low-grade digital video.    Don't get me wrong, the sub-par picture resolution does nothing to diminish the film's ambitious production value.  The 5.1 Dolby True HD surround sound is a revelation.  Crank the volume on this one.  Your neighbors will love you for it.    This DVD is loaded with extras, all presented in HD as well: Director audio commentary, outtakes, deleted scenes, alternate endings, Easter eggs, and three featurettes covering production, visual effects and creature design.  But exclusive to the blu-ray edition is the most impressive feature of all: a Special Investigation Mode which allows you to watch the film with pop-up military intel that gives you background on the creature and the people involved, along with a GPS map of Manhattan which shows you exactly where the creature is in relation to the protagonists and the action taking place on the screen.    This is an all-together solid package but I can't recommend it if you already own the regular DVD version.  For the enterprising filmmaker or digital effects artist, this DVD offers an insightful look into the filmmaking process.
0451529308|4.0|I first read this book when I was in third grade. I was about halfway through the book when I had to fling it across the room from me in utter horror. Eventually, the pull of the book was too strong: I picked it up, finished it, and sulked for a week. And ever since then, whenever I try to reread it, I end up tossing it across the room, screaming, pulling my hair: the characters just get under your skin. You *care* about what happens to them.    The little women are Meg, Jo, Amy, and Beth. They have flaws, just like real people: Meg is vain, Jo is boyish, and Amy is a bit of a brat. Beth is utterly angelic, and can do no wrong. But while these may sound like pasted on personalities, they're not. Over the course of such a long book, you become deeply attached to the characters, and get to know and love them.    The story centers primarily around tomboyish Jo. She is constantly getting into scrapes, but is dedicated to her family and goes to great lengths to prove it. It's a growing up story: we follow Jo from a carefree girl who whistles and runs outside to a wife who would give everything for her husband.    Now for the bad: Louisa May Alcott is fond of injecting moral lessons into every chapter. That might have been nice in the 1800s, but now, it can seem a bit cloying. That said, the stories themselves are enjoyable enough if you can get past the morality.    Further, this book offers some of the most emotionally dissatisfying scenes I've ever read. Hence me throwing the book across the room. I don't want to spoil it for you; you'll know it when you get to it. And you'll be as upset as I was. So be prepared.    Overall, Little Women is a good family story with realistic characters. Young girls will probably enjoy it the most, but I think anyone can get something out of it.
B00008PW2D|5.0|A short, but sweet season, I love the fun of season 5.<br /><br />Of all the heavy relationships, serious issues, and \\"true life\\" this show tends to embody, season 5 is nice for its frivolity.<br /><br />True it is shorter than any other season, but a savvy shopper can find it for a smaller price (if Amazon ever fails, try a video rental sale when they sell their former rentals)<br /><br />The episodes make you happy to be a girl! \\"Anchors Away\\" is great, soo many boobs, all of them seen by Carrie (And what a great song in the end!).  \\"Unoriginal Sin\\" allows us to see the truly lawyer-ific side of Miranda, and she goes up against the \\"desperate\\" Catholic church, while Carrie must change the name of her column due to lack of activity: --- & the City.  \\"Luck Be an Old Lady\\" is great if only for it being Charlotte's \\"thirty-faux\\" birthday!  \\"Cover Girl\\"  Carrie's head on Madonna's body as a mock up for her book cover, in addition to the \\"taste\\" difference between Carrie and Samantha in their clash over what is sexy makes this episode hilarious and we get the Amy Sedaris and Molly Shannon cameos!  \\"Plus One ...\\" a fun episode complete with Miranda's Freudian moment and Carrie's \\"skinned: date, Samantha.  \\"Critical Condition\\" is a throw away episode ... Samantha and Miranda come to an understanding, Carrie freaks out about what she might have done to Aidan, and Charlotte refuses to take Bunny's harsh treatment \\"lying down.\\" \\"The Big Journey\\" is great, just the beginning alone can be re-watched over and over: \\"I need a man on top of me\\" and the \\"very 'Some Like It Hot'\\" reference is hilarious.  But this episode is all about Carrie, no doubt.  \\"I Love A Charade\\" is a snoozer, but Charlotte steals the show with her new playmate, Harry ... unlikely and very entertaining.<br /><br />But based on what everyone else has been saying maybe only die hard fans should buy it, but everyone who enjoys SATC should see it once!
B0011UBDTK|1.0|The package came and was supposed to be brand new.  It looked repackaged and just like the others disappointed reviewers, it wouldn't play in either of my dvd players skipping and freezing up.
0930289234|5.0|This is constantly regarded as the graphic novel that started it all. Graphic novels still aren't favorably looked upon by many, but if you look at this story with it's complex psychological overviews of every single character and its amazing story, it may as well be regarded as fine literature...as a matter of fact, it is. Time Magazine named it one of their \\"100 Best Books\\" Not 100 best comic books...best books. The story and artwork presented here tells why the heroes feel the way they do and you actually feel for them.
B000Y179KO|2.0|Having been a fan for some years it was great to hear the Eagles were releasing a brand new Album. Yes this album is extremely well recorded but unfortunately it is mostly just that. The majority of the tracks hardly reach average - that \\"I really want to play that again\\" feeling is missing. The are two exceptions; \\"Long Road Out of of Eden\\" is brilliant and \\"Last Good Time in Town\\", written and lead vocal by Joe Walsh shows Joe has still got the magic (reminiscent of \\"Life's Been Good\\" days). Maybe good value if only for these two tracks.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|I bought it before the movie came out. Uncensored, uncut, just a blast to remember all since episode one.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|What a difference film makes. The colors and depth of the shots is spectacular. I didn't realize just how degraded movie quality has become until seeing this movie shot using film. There are minor issues that I have with the film, but overall it was great to see such a full length feature motion picture epic for STARGATE SG1. I just wish that they would move to the big screen with the original SG1 cast.
B000YIGNKE|4.0|Product arrived in timely manner.  I have enjoyed this version of Persuasion however as others reviews have stated the last five minutes of her running thur the streets was a bit much.

B00164KYS2|5.0|I am a huge Sex and the City fan!  I own the series and have been excited for this movie since I first discovered it was in production.  I must say that it was such a great movie and highly reccomend it!  Some of my girlfriends that went with me had not seen the series and they enjoyed the movie so much they're going to go buy it as well; and they were able to follow the movie without confusion.  I really do hope the producers and everyone involved do decide to release this movie on DVD (as I'm assuming it most likely will if it's on here already).
0553208845|3.0|Siddhartha is a man on a spiritual journey. German writer, Herman Hesse, starts off strong about a man who is willing to give up everything in search of his self and to live without the needs and comforts of life. Siddhartha is searching for meaning which includes a spiritual journey without material possessions and even relationships. He has a love relationship with Kamalah who would provide him his son, something that she predicted. That is where the story, I think gets lost. Instead the book sort of lost it's way rearding Siddhartha's journey by his relationship with Kamalah and his search for religion and spiritualism is brushed aside by his relationships with one woman and his quest to continue to find himself. Hesse is an interesting writer in that he starts strongly trying to help us find our own spiritual center much like Siddhartha has in his life and he gets lost along the way or is detoured. Despite it's short length, it's quite a powerful book but it loses it's punch midway in the novel
B000N6U0E2|5.0|I have not been so inspired by a film in a long while.  It was truly a story of believing in yourself when nobody else does, when the world hands you lumps and lemons, make the best of it, make lemonade as the saying goes.  The true story of Chris Gardner is hard hitting, as real as he lived it in his own experience back in the early 1980's.  It's a truthful documentation of his personal life battle to succeed despite all adversity, and how he overcame all the ditches to wind up on top, all the while being a solid and supportive father to his impressionable son.  The line with his boy on the basketball court, where he tells him never to let anyone take his dream away by telling him he cannot do something, is very poignant as it shows us how easy it is to fold under negative pressure from people who say I CAN'T or YOU CAN'T.  The message here is to take what you do have, even when it seems it isn't much, and try with all you have within you to turn it around, survive, come out on top and say I CAN.  The supporting cast is extraordinary, especially young Jaden Smith as Christopher Jr.  The extras are very interesting, especially the interview with the real life Chris Gardner.  I recommmend this movie for all as the message is very positive and personally empowering....Believe in Yourself!
B000VXLC3K|5.0|Carol King is brilliant. The live versions are excellent and in the same sequence as the popular album, adding a degree of predictability to the non-produced live versions. The performances are - at times - a bit tentative in an innocent way, and give a genuine impression of an up and coming superstar who has launched a promising career but still has big things to come. It presents a refreshing view that makes her music more \\"real\\" than the pasturized version we're all familiar with. I highly recommend it to anyone who grew up \\"in the era.\\" You will not be disappointed.
B0007TKH66|4.0|I was a bit skeptical of this show when I first bought, but found that I really enjoyed the first season...it has all sorts of things that hint at what's to come on the ``Star Trek'' original series. The only thing I don't like about the show, especially what's to come, is a particular thread that was inserted dealing with time travel...but I'd come to learn that that wasn't solely the creators' doing, but at the behest of the studio. That said, I definitely enjoyed the first season and would obviously recommend it to die-hard `Trek' fans, but also casual fans of sci-fi, tho in that case, I'd suggesting renting it through Netflix or Blockbuster.
B0017R5UAA|5.0|The Fleet Foxes are a rock band that sounds like no other -- imagine a pastoral choir overwhelming a sweeping folk-rock band, in the middle of a sunlit forest in the spring.<br /><br />That's about the sound of the Fleet Foxes' self-titled debut album -- it's a stream of lush, jangly folk pop, edged with a touch of baroque and country-rock. While their \\"Sun Giant\\" EP was an excellent introduction, it's nothing compared to the rough-edged grandeur of the full-length album, with its glorious instrumentation and vivid lyricism.<br /><br />The only really offputting part of the album is the opening five seconds, when an off-key chorale sings, \\"Reeeeed squirrel in the morning/Reeeeeeeed squirrel in the evening...\\"<br /><br />Then the song suddenly melts into a gentle acoustic guitar shimmering with keyboard. \\"The sun rises, over my head/Hold me dear, into the night/Sun it will rise soon in the morn...\\" Robin Pecknold sings with all the solemnity of a choirboy. His voice soars over the steelier riffs and thumping drums, only to settle down with, \\"The sun rising, dangling there/Golden and fair, in the sky...\\"<br /><br />Wow. When an intro is that lovely, just imagine what the songs that follow are going to be like.<br /><br />In this case, it's the shifting folky \\"White Winter Hymnal,\\" with its kettle drums and beautiful campfire harmonies (\\"I was following... I was following... I was following the pack/all swallowed in their coats/with scarves of red tied 'round their throats\\"), followed by the endearingly energetic rocker \\"Ragged Wood\\" (\\"You should come back home/back on your own now!\\").<br /><br />It gets no less endearing after that: Gentle bluesy ballads, jangly folk-pop with lots of squiggly mellotron, sweeping pop chorales, bouncy countryish rockers with lots of intertwined guitars. Things get quieter near the end -- \\"Fleet Foxes\\" ends with a trio of lower-key, folkier ballads, sometimes with nothing more than Pecknold's voice and a guitar.<br /><br />There's something very warm and welcoming about the Fleet Foxes' music, and there's hardly a song on their self-titled album that doesn't contain that sunniness. And though the bittersweet songs focus on the usual topics -- family, love, lost friends -- there's a strong feeling of pastoral beauty, especially since they're sprinkled with meadowlarks, wood-women, \\"quivering forests,\\" Tennessee and grassy graves.<br /><br />In fact, the lyrics are crammed with vivid (\\"And, Michael, you would fall/and turn the white snow red as strawberries\\") and striking language (\\"I hold a cornucopia and a golden crown\\"). At times, the band's lyrics are pure poetry (\\"Wanderers this morning came by/Where did they go?/Graceful in the morning light/To banner fair/To follow you softly/In the cold mountain air...\\").<br /><br />These songs are wrapped in lush melodies of striking music, which happily swirl together folk, classic earthy rock, pop, baroque and a bit of country. And an coustic guitar is the lead instrument here; sometimes it's all by itself, and sometimes it's intertwined with a smooth mix of other instruments -- hollow drums, rippling mellotron, steely guitar, and a hint of harp being plucked somewhere.<br /><br />And finally there's Robin Pecknold. He sounds a little off-key in the spare ballads, but in the more complex songs he sounds sweet, strong and truly beautiful, especially when he does that soaring thing. And I have to say, I'm a sucker for the band's sunny chorale sound -- the harmonies really make those melodies sound exquisite.<br /><br />The Fleet Foxes' self-titled debut is one of the best albums I've heard all year, with its blend of styles and bittersweetly lovely songs.

B001AIRUP4|5.0|Only Tim Burton could produce a holiday musical about Halloween's grotesqueries taking over Christmas.<br /><br />And in fact he did. Burton wrote and produced a charming stop-motion musical called \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas,\\" which is as close as we'll ever get to a Burton Christmas film. And there's rarely a dull moment in this town called Halloween -- from start to finish, it's a quirky, macabre, vintage-flavoured ride through the darker side of everybody's favorite holidays.<br /><br />In Halloween Town, the undead Jack Skellington is king, and each Halloween the residents try to make their celebration even more horrible than the year before.<br /><br />But this year, something is missing for Jack, and he starts wondering if scaring people is all his life has. He ends up wandering into a sort of holiday junction, and finds a portal to Christmas Town -- it's full of snow, lights, presents and innocent fun. Jack is instantly enamoured of Christmas, and decides that for this year, the residents of Halloween Town are going to celebrate Christmas.<br /><br />He manages to convince the other Halloween residents -- except the sweet rag-doll Sally -- to go along with his plan. So Halloween Town is redecorated and filled with presents (in a suitably ghastly style) and \\"Sandy Claws\\" is abducted so Jack can take his place. But are the people of Halloween Town just not suited to innocent merriment, and can the Pumpkin King fill the capacious red suit when Christmas Eve rolls around?<br /><br />The idea of Halloween ghouls and spooks deciding to take over Christmas sounds terribly twee in concept, like a gimmicky children's book. Fortunately Tim Burton's darkly humorous sense of humor and delightfully gothic designs -- as well as Henry Selick's brilliant direction -- end up turning the movie into something that is more than just another kid's movie. Think a Burtonesque \\"Princess Bride.\\"<br /><br />Much of its charm comes from the richness of Burton's visuals -- his Halloween Town is saturated in spiky iron fences, ghost dogs, insects, mad scientists, and a spooky cloudy night that never ends. And though the inhabitants of Halloween Town are devoted to being grotesque and spooky, there's a lighthearted benevolence in their actions at all times. It almost makes Christmas Town look... dull.<br /><br />But it's also an incredibly funny, sweet little movie, with plenty of heart. There's an adorable little love story between Jack and Sally (\\"My dearest friend, if you don't mind...\\"), despite Jack's total cluelessness. And Burton weaves in lots of solid musical numbers (\\"There's children throwing snowballs/instead of throwing heads/they're busy building toys/and absolutely no one's dead!\\").<br /><br />But the crown jewel is Burton's macabre sense of humor. Hardly a scene goes by without a creepy gag (one child's present is a shrunken head) or clever dialogue (\\"Jack, please, I'm only an elected official here. I can't make decisions by myself!\\"). But the best humor comes from the Halloween-town's residents eagerly trying to be festive, and only making Christmas even creepier than Halloween ever could be.<br /><br />For a skeleton puppet, Jack Skellington is a pretty adorable hero -- he's earnest, generous, but suffers from a bit of ennui from the same old performance every year. His meditative songs about Halloween and his attempts at Christmas add an introspective note to him as well. And he's backed by a bunch of lovable characters, with Sally and the ghost dog Zero at the forefront.<br /><br />\\"Nightmare Before Christmas\\" is a macabre, wildly adorable little movie that reminds us why we love Halloween (besides the candy). Sometimes the dark and fun go hand in hand.ost dogs, insects, mad scientists, and a spooky cloudy night that never ends.

B00000ADG2|5.0|\\"The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill\\" still sounds as fresh and new in 2008 as it did when it was released in 1998. It's hard to believe that its been ten years since this masterpiece was released. The songs are timeless. \\"Ex-Factor,\\" \\"Doo Wop (That Thing),\\" \\"I Used To Love Him,\\" \\"Lost Ones,\\" \\"Everything Is Everything,\\" \\"To Zion,\\" and all the rest are classics. I bet in 2028 somebody, somewhere will still be rocking this CD. I'm still hoping for another Lauryn masterpiece. I know she's had her issues through the years since this Grammy-winning darling was released, but her talent is timeless. They don't make 'em like her anymore. I think she has another one in her. If she ever does decide to comeback, she has one fan that will be patiently waiting for her new \\"Miseducation!\\"

B000WC3AOE|5.0|I ordered a DVD Video and was not aware of the the new DVD-HD and Blue Ray Video formats. The DVD-HD Video would not play on my DVD recorder and I had to return the Video. There was no problem on my return, even though this was caused by my lack of product knowledge.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Super duper effective workouts with this dvd! I loved and used The Firm workouts for the majority of my workouts over the past 4 years. I thought I was fit and in shape... until I tried this dvd! I could keep up, but I was more out of breath, sweated more, and felt more challenged and worked in these short 25 minute workouts than in many of my hour long Firm workouts! This dvd kicks my workout up a notch in a shorter period of time! I did the 1st w/o twice before going on to the 2nd workout. Now I just alternate the two into my other regular home workouts. I have previewed the 3rd workout several times. I can tell it's going to be an incredible kick butt challenge. Extremely sore shoulder muscles from a Cathe workout prevented my from giving it a shot this last week, but it's coming up and I can tell I'm gonna love it! I also use Cathe Freidrich, The Firm, Shape, and various other workout dvds of all types. I have lost 90 lbs and kept it off for 4 years with workout videos. I highly recommend this video for the intermediate/ advanced exercisers!
B00004W50Z|4.0|This is a good album, but it pales in comparison to \\"Music From Big Pink\\" or the self-titled \\"The Band\\".<br /><br />The sound represents a slightly darker side of The Band's career than the period of the first two albums. It is melodic, and musically well-done. But, it is dark (for The Band) and pessimistic. The sound is metallic-tinged and sharp. The words are certainly not jovial, and you can hear a distraught, hurt tone in many of the vocals. At the most peppy and spunky moments, its aura is at best ambivalent. This is not to knock this album, again I repeat, it is good musically. Just don't try to cheer yourself up with it.<br /><br />The best tracks in my opinion are Strawberry Wine, Time To Kill, The Shape I'm In, The W.S. Walcott Medicine Show, and Stage Fright.

B000001DWG|5.0|Mother Love Bone may have only released one album and a four song EP in their time, but they are legendary as far as the Seattle sound goes. In a class of their own, and if you listen to the disc, you will realize, a band that almost all the Seattle hit makers, have spent the past twenty years trying to emulate... however, have never quite made the mark. THis disc showcases all of the bands major label material, consisting of the LP:Apple, and the EP:Shine.<br /><br />This band came out of the late eighties, and while they were children of the glam rock era, they were the people who basically invented the grunge rock sound. The combination of these two styles, along with some really finely penned lyrics, make these songs all sparkle, and at the same time, make the head get deep, and also make you want to crank some volume, and sing along. This is a free natured sort of rock music. Unique. Loud. Somewhat raw, and just an overall good time record. Mother Love Bone is a band that threatens to be invisible these days, but really, some of these songs should stay bright for years down the road. Theres not a letdown in the bunch, but my key picks would be SHANGRI-LA, CROWN OF THORNS (especially the extended version from Shine)and HOLY ROLLER, I'd name more but they ain't poppin into my head as quickly. This is a record that any fan of the Seattle scene couldn't possibly not enjoy, and thats more than I personally can say for it's spin off younger brother Pearl Jam, who usually bums me out for the most part. But lets not try to get onto any sort of negative spin here people. Thats not what this stuff is all about.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|My God!  How could anyone have watched this \\"camera shakey\\" film on the big screen?  What a waste of time and money!  As one reviewer said, some of the special effects were great, but what's with the hand held camera effect?  \\"Blair Witch\\" had the same annoying effects, but compared with Cloverfield ... it was still frame!    Where did the monster come from?  Where did it go?  Lots of room for a sequal, but who would ever go see a sequal to this really bad movie?

I found nothing special about this book. I read a lot of books on meditation, yoga, and buddism, and this book doesn't hold up to any of them. I read the reviews on this site and ran out to buy this book. After forcing myself to read it I finally had enough. I definately don't want this book to be in my libary.
0099489988|3.0|Having never read anything by this author before, I decided to purchase this book after reading some of the positive reviews.  In general, I enjoyed the story . . . but the characters were not developed well AT ALL.  The story made it seem as if the baby was just left in a room all day . . . and not really given much thought.  I didn't really \\"get\\" Claire's family.  Like I said, the characters were not well developed so it made it hard to feel connected to them.  Some of the story lines were a bit far-fetched and a little hard to believe.<br /><br />Having only read one of her books, I'm not inclined to write this author off just yet.  However, I hope this is one of her less inspired writings.
061891868X|4.0|I am a mechanical engineer, so my mathematical understanding of physics doesn't go much beyond special relativity, introductory quantum mechanics and just an appreciation for what general relativity has to say about mass telling space how to curve.<br /><br />Lee Smolins book is written for the lay public as well as physicists and was a very interesting and eye opening read on the great number of string theories which abound. According to Smolins, string theory is very likely just a beautiful mathematical \\"bookkeeping\\" system which can relate current observations to each other and unify some of the forces of nature.<br /><br />The author is a onetime string theorist who has since left the field and insists after 30 years there have been no breakthroughs and certainly no predictions of any new particles or phenomena which can be tested. Based on what Smolins is saying it sounds to me like string theory amounts to a multi-dimensional curve fitting spline whose coefficients can be calculated and precisely tuned to rationalize just about everything we already know, but makes no new and testable predictions.<br /><br />He also says that it scarcely has the needed properties to call it a \\"theory of everything\\" and that far too much time is being spent on it by too many people caught up in its mathematical beauty and elegance, something he admits it has a great deal of. The idea of subatomic vibrating, open and closed rubber bands being the ultimate component of particles and energy is very appealing to many people.<br /><br />He also says that the string community spends time calculating these potentially infinite (\\"fit\\" coefficients) universes and the only test of their work is that it fits known prior phenomena.  Furthermore, the only critical test a new string theory receives is peer review from a specialized community that is starting to believe that predictions of any new observations are not in the cards and we shouldn't be looking for them anyhow. When we stop requiring a theory to anticipate new observations we are no longer following the scientific method.<br /><br />Until I read this book I believed, based on my faith in physics, physicists and the scientific method, that string theory was the answer to everything and only required time for it to provide some testable predictions. It has had over 30 years time and research by a disproportionate percent of the physics community. I am now not so certain that it is a valid theory, especially after some of the strongest string theorists are telling us not to look for testable predictions.e new observations we are no longer following the scientific method.

B0000062Y2|5.0|I fell in love with this music when I first heard it in 1973.  In the past, I have purchased the vinyl LP and cassette tape.  Now that I have the CD, I can listen to Ted Neeley's awesome voice hit all the high notes; Carl Anderson agonize over his decision to believe or betray; and Yvonne Elliman's confusion without worrying that the tape will break at the worst possible time or worse still, simply wear out.    Jesus Christ Superstar is a major part of my audio life.  I listen to it with wonder whenever I can, as often as I can.  I highly recommend this soundtrack to anyone who enjoys extremely excellent music and wants to be transported by the experience.

I have read all Sophie Kinsella's books and love each and every one of them, as she has the ability to turn out a different character and different storyline with each one (apart from the Shopaholic series naturally).     I think if you like her style of writing, this book will not disappoint.

0517223546|4.0|I'm a working mother, so I don't have as much time to read as I'd like, and when I do have time, I find that I prefer lighter fare. My family will be traveling to the UK this summer, so I picked up this book hoping to brush up on my British history in a format that I would actually complete.    The book lived up to my expectations. I really liked the way it covered different generations, because the transitions between eras made it easy to put the book down and not end up reading all night. I also liked the sense of the sweep of history that it conveyed, and the sense of how small the individuals were against the sweep of time. And, by giving me stories of normal people responding to large historical events, it made it easy for me to get a sense of what the Magna Carta is about and who all the different important kings were, and more.    I'm now trying \\"London,\\" by the same author!    I found the stories light and enjoyable, but not stunningly compelling and sometimes clichéd - hence the 4 stars instead of 5.

Highly recommended!

This is not a rock and roll show... it's the Presidency.\\"      I have told my friends to read this book. If they read it, they don't always change their minds. But some do come to understand that Obama has a logic for his positions that is at least coherent and respectable.    This book was profound for me.

B0016B6ZKG|5.0|When I heard that Donna Summer was releasing a new record in 2008, I expected it to be one of those \\"cover albums\\" that all these \\"legacy\\" artists were doing these days. If not, then I expected that it would be some sort of Celine-style adult contemporary ballad album. So, I didn't have much high hopes for this CD. However, when I received \\"Crayons\\", I was astonished to find that this was a brand new collection of modern, upbeat and relevant songs that have been produced by some of the most sought-after and hippest producers of today (Greg Kirstin, Toby Gad etc.), and the end results were absolutely devastating!!!    At the age of 59, Ms. Summer delivers these 12 songs with such rare, fierce energy that will make most of today's younger diva-wannabes sound like they have been in an eternal narcotic coma. Her voice is better shape than ever, with much richer texture and depth than it did in the 70's. Musically speaking, Summer is on twin-turbo mode, delivering a refreshingly diverse style that is always in high spirit and energy. Pop, R&B, hip hop, rock, world music... you name it, it's there! To my surprise again, rather than sounding like a mish mash of clashing styles, strangely enough, this is an unbelievably cohesive collection of 12 superbly crafted songs. The secret lies within Summer's unmistakable vocals, which form the backbone and center piece of the music here, rather than the other way round. Ms. Summer handles the various styles with effortless ease, and her iconic vocals provide the consistent paint brush that magically blends all these contrasting styles together, painting a vivid soundscape of many different and yet harmonious colors.     Further cohesion of the album is provided by the consistent themes of the lyrics. Ms. Summer co-wrote all 12 tracks here. In fact, this is probably one of her most personal record to date. Summer sings about her own journey to career success (\\"Fame\\", \\"Be Myself Again\\", \\"The Queen is Back\\"), with a good dose of humorthrown in - how many references to the \\"Queen\\" can you spot in this record!? She also declares her love for her husband of almost 30 years (\\"Sand On My Feet\\", \\"I'm A Fire\\"). Clearly, she is at a place in her life where she is finally at ease with her at times tormented past, to the point that she can now sing about it with decidedly positive attitude that is both convincing and refreshing.    Highlights of the album include the current single, \\"Stamp Your Feet\\", that opens the record with an uplifting, anthemic statement; \\"Fame\\", a wonderfully chaotic and frantic rock/pop creation that is reminiscent of En Vogue's \\"Free Your Mind\\"; the Billboard #1 Dance Record \\"I'm A Fire\\"; the sensitive and very personal ballad \\"Be Myself Again\\"; and the socio-political epic of \\"Bring Down the Reign\\". In fact, it is extremely difficult and unfair to pick out specific songs from this extraordinarily strong collection.    I think that the die-hard Summer disco fans may be disappointed here - no, this is not a repeat of the Morodor/Summer formula here. It is far from a disco record. For the disco fans who refuse to move on, they should find consolation by the fact that Summer has a tremendous back catalogue with Morodor. For the vast majority of the music lovers, \\"Crayons\\" is an important, historic milestone for a legendary artist who just refuses to be stereotyped and who refuses to just simply walk away from an increasingly hostile industry that favors young age and image over real talents.... and thank goodness for people like her. No doubt a whole new generation will finally be introduced to Ms. Summer, who will now be opening the doors for many other legacy artists who deserve a second listen.

0757307272|5.0|The Success Principles for Teens is a phenomenal book!  I wish I would have had a copy as a pre-teen or teenager.  It would have saved me a lot of needless pain & suffering. This book teaches teens how to take responsibility for their lives, set goals, and establish healthy self-esteems and healthy self-perceptions.  It encourages the reader to be persistent and to give their best no matter what.  Each chapter is sprinkled with inspiring stories that back up the 20 principles.  It is extremely fun and entertaining to read while teaching important life skills.  I am 27-years old and was motivated to take the suggestions in the book.  Implementing these suggestions has absolutely changed my life for the better.  I am now goal oriented and have a much more positive outlook on life.  This book made me feel that I finally have the tools necessary to deal with the real world.

I mean, all I could do would be to be apathetic or pessimistic about my future. \\" The truth is once you learn how to die, you learn how to live.\\" - that'd be the last thing I could say.<br /> Certainly, it WAS sad that Morrie passed away because he was respected by lots of his students and graduates.

In particular, I extremely enjoy \\"Mother Mary\\", \\"The Pedestrian\\", \\"She's a Saint, Not a Celebrity\\", and \\"Dark Side of Night\\". There are others hits as well, but I could do with one or two others (nuge nudge, Ruby Room). Overall, I'm am extremely happy with this purchase. If the next official Green Day album is as good as this, its sure to make it to the top of the charts.

It is rare or impossible to see classic films on the big screen, so we get use to seeing them on television usually cropped, cut and grainy. I've seen Casablanca once on the big screen and this DVD does a good job matching what I saw on film. It's all about detail and clarity! The bonus features are also worth owning.

0385338724|5.0|The day was crappy and the evening worse.  As far as Lexi Smart was concerned, life couldn't get any worse.  She was out with her friends celebrating their bonuses, her loser boyfriend stood her up, and she had to attend her father's funeral the following day.  Caught in the rain in search of a nonexistent taxi, Lexi was fed up and frustrated.  She had a low level job with limited prospects, a loser for a boyfriend and little hope of doing better.  She was a the snaggly-toothed, stood up, no bonus girl whose dad just died.  Spotting a taxi Lexi ran after it, but her stupid, cheap, shiny-soled boots slipped out from under her, and the pavement came up to meet her.<br /><br />Lexi woke up in a hospital, not really sure what happened or how she got there.  She remembers the crappy day and horrible night, but that was three years ago.  She didn't recognize the woman in the mirror.  When did she get her teeth straightened, her hair dyed, and what happened to the extra weight she used to carry around?  She was supposedly married to a drop-dead gorgeous millionaire, and the boss of her own department at work.  There was only one possible explanation.  She must have died and gone to heaven.  This couldn't be her life.<br /><br />It didn't take Lexi long to realize that all was not right in her fairy-tale world.  Her friends were no longer her friends, she had a reputation for being the bitch-boss from hell, her husband acted like a pre-programmed robot that didn't know how to respond outside of the set parameters, and her husband's architect claimed to be her secret lover.<br /><br />Lexi's struggle to mesh the past and the present into a life she would live with is both heart-wrenching and laugh-out-loud funny.  The story-line is a well used one, but Sophie Kinsella added so many unexpected twists and turns that it didn't feel worn or clich&eacute;d.  Remember Me is a fast, easy read that will keep you snickering right up to the end.

Delaney & Bonnie had a wonderful ability to gather talent around them. No wonder Joe Cocker stole this band and Lowell George took the heart of their next band.    However, when this album came out in 1970, Eric Clapton was the only name in the band most folks recognized. Eric is at his best here as \\"just one of the boys.\\" Don't expect flashy solos, just 3 guitars (or is it 4 - George Harrison was on this tour too?) picking you up and whisking you away.    When \\"Things Get Better\\" starts, you'll say, \\"This is the hottest song I ever heard.\\" Then it gets even better! By the time \\"Coming Home\\" has run over your brain, you'll just give in and hang on to the train barreling to rock 'n' roll nirvana. No rhythm section ever drove harder. I dare you to restrain yourself.

The movie is a complete masterpiece with it's music and camerawork. Nothing will ever compare to this film nor will John Carpenters work to follow . The Rob Zombie film should be passed on as the rest of the halloween films. H20 showed some promise however. The 1978 Original Halloween is a classic and a great lesson how horror films should be made start to finish.

B0014Z4OQG|5.0|I'll make this short since I really don't enjoy writing these durned Amazon reviews any longer:    1) The Cloverfield monster is the Id Monster from the 50s sci-fi classic Forbidden Planet (neat!)--gives one a lot to think about    2) The \\"shaky cam\\" is a novel way of introducing very imaginative and symbol-laden camera-work all while making it seem \\"natural\\" (to at least a 21st Century person). Nothing in this film is unplanned or random, including the white noise, jump cuts, and frequent visual chaos    3) I hope everyone saw the \\"thing\\" splash into the sea during the last flashback; the characters are so self-involved they don't even notice.    4)The whole film is greater than the sum of its parts and hits hard at a lot of contemporary culture and the modern mind-set. It's not about 9-11, it's about the national head-state.    5) Watch this with Spielberg's \\"War of the Worlds\\" and the first half hour of \\"Saving Private Ryan\\"--don't forget to watch Forbidden Planet too. Add in the much maligned \\"Southland Tales\\"--another great 9-11 film.    5) One of the sharpest flicks I've seen in a long time--almost an art film    6) Showed this to an interesting pack of people and they all thought it was a work of genius    Oh, Godzilla came out in 1954, nine years after the atomic bombings of Japan--this came out roughly seven years after 9-11. The movie is a fascinating take (or re-take) on the Godzilla fad as a social-psychological phenomenon. Our monster is just a lot more irrational.    Oh, reading the other reviews is painful    Oh, go into this film assuming the writer and director knew what they were doing
0451197968|5.0|I could not put this book down.  I had to know how it was going to end.  Another well written book by Stephen King/Richard Bachman.  It definitely has the Bachman feel to it.  It is not a happily ever after ending but the main character gets his justice in the end!
B00005JPS7|5.0|Now here's one for the collection.  Robert Downey Jr. shines, and is perfect for the role of Tony Stark.  Robert Downey Jr. has been around for some time, but this movie has catapulted him into superstardom.    I am a big fan of superhero movies, and strongly believe that this one delivered.  I am looking forward to owning it on DVD.  There was really nothing to complain about for me.  It was really tight.  No plot holes, no cheesy moments, no cgi flaws, everything was there and in perfect proportion throughout.  Had they tried to pull off this movie decades ago, it may have fallen short, but modern special effects are at work here, and the designers do quite a fine job with this film.  Notable is the amazing detail on the intricate body armor and electronic systems of the suit.  You really believe that the suit (Stark's invention) is formidable and ultra high tech.  There is plenty of action, and some unbelievably cool moments that will have you hitting the rewind button, or watching the whole movie again soon.  I give it a full five stars.  Enjoy!
B0014I4KIK|5.0|While perusing the internet one day, I came across an article on Duffy. I had never heard of her or heard any of her music, but I love to find and listen to new artists, so I went to her website. I was floored by her. Her voice is soulful to say the least and yes, she is likened to 60's British pop, Dusty Springfield, Lulu, etc. I have recommended her Rockferry album to all of my music loving friends and so far, I've got positive responses from all of them. There is not one song on this debut CD that I dislike. \\"Serious\\", \\"Hanging on Too Long\\" and \\"Warwick Avenue\\" are my favorites, but I like all of the other songs and listen to this CD in its entirety, never once FF'ing to the next song. That's rare for me. Normally, I buy a CD and end up only liking two or three songs on it. Also, someone else recommended finding another song, not on Rockferry, called \\"Breaking My Own Heart\\", another great song from this Welsh phenomenon. I don't know all the hype about whether or not she was on Britain's version of American Idol and was a runner-up nor have I heard any hype about the marketing for her. I am oblivious to other people's opinions as truly, it is a matter of individual taste. Yes, there will be some who don't like Duffy, but at least listen for yourself and form your own opinion. I truly enjoy Duffy, her music and her voice and can't wait for her next CD. I hope it is as great as Rockferry is.
0307346617|5.0|What a great book! In a genius move, Max Brooks tells this story in the style of a Studs Terkel oral history by various survivors of the Zombie Wars. Set in the near future, the book starts as the author describes how his book first started off as a postwar UN report on the war. His interviews for the report forms the book he writes based on personal recollections of various people around the globe. A doctor in China who first noticed a mysterious disease, a US infantryman who battled the zombies, a Japanese man who, as a teen, had to make his way out of his apartment building against marauding zombies. Stories like these are woven together to tell a believable history of the Zombie Wars from the start to the final defeat of the creatures. A very enjoyable horror book! I have heard this book is being adapted into a movie. I hope they do it right.
B00063EMJ6|5.0|What can I say that I haven't already said in my other review of Neil Young DVD live show?  He is a master singer and songwriter.  I never get tired of any of his performances, which is why I buy his works whenever I can. There is something about Neil's music that brings out the best in feelings when listening to his music.  You're just glad to be alive, especially when watching his live show DVD that I recently rated.  By the way, I have already watched his live show more times than I can remember and love it every time.  You are one of the best Neil and I thank you for sharing your talent with us all!

B000OYC7A8|5.0|I have reviewed many Pink Floyd albums (CD's & DVD's), none of which have ever been a disappointment.  This group, with lead performer, David Gilmore, is the best of the best.  David Gilmore mesmerizes the audiance with his picking and singing talent that is second to none.  I have sat in awe and watched him and his group perform.      If you love Pink Floyd as I do, you won't want to miss out on this special event that brings you lasting music enjoyment over the years.  I highly recommend this DVD to all of the David Gilmore and Pink Floyd fans.
B00006AW2M|5.0|This has always been my favorite Rolling Stones album.  Always will be.  Sure, it's spotty and flawed, the sound quality and/or mix is weak in places, parts of it are seemingly thrown together, but that becomes part of its charm, its strength, its mystique.  What it does for the imagination, for me, is inestimable; the possibilities are endless.  A wistful romanticism shines through the tarnish.  What it lacks in polish, it more than makes up for in character.  From the opener \\"Sing This All Together\\", a rousing hiking march sung in unison with Hobbitlike exuberance, you know you are going on a trip, a journey both physical and sensory as you are transported over varying terrain and through unfamiliar vegetation with subtle changes in the purposeful and multifarious percussion, finally sliding into the medieval \\"Citadel\\" with its strained, strange and brazen instrumentation (a Stones hallmark), and its rather complex arrangement (for pop music) with contrary instrumental lines.  \\"Men at arms shout 'Who goes there...'\\"  Stand forth and declare yourself.  \\"...Here the peasants come and crawl, You can hear their numbers called...\\"  I always loved the lyrics; for one, I was reading science-fiction and fantasy at the time.  No doubt Mick & Keith were having some fun with this one, commenting on their cloistered existence as pop stars, and venting their antipathy toward conventional society.  The traveller then shuffles along to the next attraction in the sideshow, the plucky harpsichord induced otherworldliness of Bill Wyman's \\"In Another Land\\" (I wish he'd done more like this gem, & \\"Shades Of Orange\\"), a cool, breezy, dream-within-a-dream which ends all too soon with the dragonlike snore of oblivion.  Nicky Hopkins does some of his finest work here on the keys, evoking a wistful, timeless place where \\"the sea and the sky and the castles were blue\\".  The track regularly emerges from the trance with a typical Stoneslike (although the bulk of the Stones did not participate until after the fact, Steve Marriott and Nicky Hopkins filling in with Bill and Charlie) refrain of barbaric intensity (oddly muted) and irreverence (the half-hearted vocalization of a trumpet, for instance).  \\"And nobody else's hand will ever do, nobody else ('s hand) (will do)...\\"  Romantic.    From the medieval we fastforward to \\"2000 Man\\", a futuristic hillbilly ballad with impressive, lovely acoustic guitar picking, and robust, though peculiar drum time which unexpectedly fits the meter of the song, then into the organ surging refrain and a continuation of the sci-fi tinged lyrics:  \\"Oh daddy, proud of your planet, Oh mommy, proud of your sun...\\"  Yes, there may be a pun in there.  It doesn't have to make sense does it?  This is impressionism; the whole album abounds in colorful glasslike fragments, like the 3D photo on the cover.    \\"Sing This All Together (See What Happens)\\"  A free form, free fall instrumental continuation, replete with lots of percussion, of the opening track, amply summed up in the Newsweek article cited below.    \\"She's A Rainbow\\"  I have long wondered:  Is this a paean to Mia?  \\"Have you seen the lady Farrow?\\"  That's what it sounds like to me.  After all, this was a time when, along with the Beatles, other pop stars and celebrities such as Donovan, Mike Love, Mia Farrow (whose sister, also at the ashram, was immortalized in John Lennon's song \\"Dear Prudence\\"), and Mick Jagger were spending time with the Maharishi.  A continuation of the Stones formula to pop music with the one-two punch of the delicate and airy (the Stones could be quite elegant and courtly at times) on one hand, countered by the brutal and beastly on the other.  Effective combination, later taken to dizzying heights of success by their understudies, Led Zeppelin.  The song shimmers with iridescence, with tight little neoclassical musicbox piano sections, flawlessly executed, strings (arranged by John Paul Jones) and unknown instrumentation (characteristic of the entire lp), offset by the heavy pop rhythm, finally breaking up into the ominous foghornlike stylings and twittering violins segueing into...       \\"The Lantern\\"  Distant church bells clang with foreboding as the song drifts into perhaps the most engaging double guitar intro in all popdom.  Taken in combination with the prior song's outro, is this not contemporary classical music?  Also, for me, among this album's highlights has long been those short, poignant instumental passages in this moody, atmospheric track.  Very moving...    \\"Gomper\\"  Ahh...  \\"By the lake with lily flowers, While away the evening hours, To and fro she's gently gliding, On the glassy lake she's riding...\\"  Is this not poetry?  Music in the Eastern mode, this, with killer guitar line, augmented by Jones' sitar flourishes and flute, and the drumming and percussion is still with us to move us along on our trip.  I see a late, golden afternoon sun scene interwoven with images on some ancient tapestry.  Thus the gliding, aquatic themed song progresses along, until portentously turning into a disjointed, insectoidal/electronic freakout.  What's not to like?      \\"2000 Light Years From Home\\"  I was partial to this early on, with its science-fiction theme.  Since I had discovered sci-fi, astronomy and pop rock at about the same time in my early adolescent life, I had long made a connection between them, and so was happy to receive this verification.  And eagerly anticipated more.  Eerie mellotron tones by Brian, evoking those lonely light years in the vast reaches of space, that he seemed destined to drift into on a more personal level.  \\"It's so very lonely, you're two thousand light years from home...\\"  I have always been fascinated with the throaty, raunchy guitar section in the middle, with attendant pulsating rhythm section, in all its glorious simplicity.  Oh yeah, the only music video promo I know of from this lp is of this song, and it is a good one (good luck finding it---oh yeah, YouTube).  I hope there are more (though I do doubt it)...    \\"On With The Show\\"  Catchy tune, that, reminding us that all is glittering sham and that we're still in the show back here on planet earth, after all (time to start the album over).  No doubt this drew further unflattering comparisons to \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" (i.e.:  that the Stones \\"copied\\" the Beatles' idea of the Vaudeville, minstrel show concept prevalent on \\"Pepper\\").  Maybe so, but who cares?  This is still a great album, and actually owes little to the Beatles' opus.  After all, both bands were very much in \\"show business\\".  Incidentally, \\"Child Of The Moon\\" (B side to \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash\\") belongs with TSMR, with its goin' against the grain musical motif.  In fact, so does \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash\\", with its odd, dark fairytale lyrics---and these two were recorded mere months after the Satanic sessions.  They were clearly transitional pieces---Request, with a boost in raw power, and were hailed as the Stones' \\"return\\".    This lp has often been compared unfavorably to the Beatles offering \\"Sgt. Pepper\\", which became THE record album against which all future albums would be measured for some time to come.  Sure, Pepper was released prior to Request, undoubtedly informed and inspired the Stones' (& everyone else's) effort, was sheer in-your-face genius when establishment media pundits were gleefully predicting the Fab Four's demise every year, was arguably the first \\"concept\\" album (which spawned hundreds of others by various groups), but.  Pepper and Request occupied different universes.  Whereas the Beatles album was an earthbound, transcendant, ironic small town carnival ride, the Stones offered a trip through the outer cosmos, through time and space.  You could get lost there.  While it celebrated the familiar and mundane, Pepper was really about the inner journey.  Where Pepper was introspective, Request was strictly outward bound (what could be construed as an appeal to the inward search, \\"Open our heads, let the pictures come...\\" was more an invocation to submit to the sensory magic of the voyage), ranging from the Middle-Ages (even prehistoric:  \\"...Pictures of us painted in our caves...\\") to the interstellar---eclectic, outlandish and strange, and it would have been interesting had the Stones continued on that trip.    But then, the drug busts and attendant chaos had entered the studio with them.  They managed, in spite of it all, to finish the album.  But sooner or later the Stones had to come back to earth.  They were too far out.  Back on terra firma with the delta blues; earthbound once more, like Icarus with his melted wings.    Point of fact, some early reviews of \\"Their Satanic Majesties Request\\" were quite favorable.  One in Newsweek for January 1, 1968 related a music critic's \\"amazement and admiration\\" upon hearing \\"Sing This All Together (See What Happens)\\", later referring to it as a \\"masterpiece\\" (strange as that may seem), a \\"fantastic eight-minute pocket opera of a disoriented world, a perfectly articulated jetstream of sound which vacuums out of the air everything from pure melodies to fragments of conversation, screams, volcanic rumblings, mad ornithological croakings, Stravinskyan karate chords, turning itself rhythmically inside out like a wind sock, and ending with a choral climax...\\"  He goes on to say, \\"It is the Stones' look into the abyss, their giant anthem of the new chaotic togetherness that leaves no one either connected or alone.\\"  A fellow high school pal of mine at the time related another glowing review of the lp, though I don't now recall his source or much detail.  Condemnation became quite fashionable later (one negative Rolling Stone magazine review comes to mind), everybody scrambling to get on the bandwagon, because the Stones had dared to make a departure from the same old tried and proven formula.  Back to the blues, rock 'n' roll, back to the cotton fields, the salt mine, at the expense of any further exploration.  What a shame.  Even the Stones have felt compelled to be apologetic about this album ever since, so great was the animosity directed towards it.  Once again, people in the main prove themselves to be hidebound, deaf and blind fools.  And groups such as Pink Floyd have been extolled for the very thing the Stones were denounced for.        Of course, I'll be among the first to say that some of the Rolling Stones' best work was their powerful blues renditions.  Nobody did it like them.  And the gritty rock numbers, not to mention the lyricism of their folkish tracks of yore.  But don't let anyone convince you otherwise; there's not a bad song on this album, and it does draw from their past work.    The Stones really had been building up to this, at least since \\"As Tears Go By\\".  Not content to merely cover great blues standards, and needing to branch out into pop music (where the money was) with original songs possessing a diverse mix, due in no small part to Brian Jones' virtuosity and fascination with exotic instruments, they began to experiment with more original sounds.  So the progression toward Request was in that sense inevitable.  If you listen carefully to \\"Going Home\\", the long track from \\"Aftermath\\" of the previous year, somewhere in the break you can hear traces of that incipient melody that would later grow into \\"Sing This All Together\\".    I have been fascinated with this record from the first time I saw it hanging on the wall at the record store, with its white smoke and blue cover bordering the enigmatic 3D color photo.  With a cover like that, it had to be good, I reasoned.  So when my sister asked what I wanted for Christmas, I said that album.  And it was a great Christmas present---one of the best I ever received.  For one thing, Yule was a great time to explore that record, what with all the time off from school.  And explore I did.  I don't remember anything else about that holiday season, except listening to TSMR.  Over, & over, & over...  Sitting in the cushioned chair with my head between the speakers, looking at the cover front and back, inside and out.  Later on I bought a second copy just so I could stack the records to hear both sides without having to get up.  Omigod, this has all the earmarks of brainwashing (now gaze into the 3D image).  And happily did I take that trip...    © 2008 RAPWreckerds
B00002E233|5.0|Look, im not ripping on Jaws here in any way. Jaws is great, it literally caused mass panic people believed what they see. Here not so much, However, this movie is amazing. The acting is superb, and not cheesy, the storyline flows together, and its action packed. This movie constantly suprised me, and in my opinion its the best shark movie ever made. I love Jaws, but at times its too slow, plus this film has the best scene of all time, with Samuel L. jackson
B00030IZY0|3.0|This is a bootleg copy from VHS, and I'd normally be really upset that I actually paid money to support thieves, but I consider this recording \\"abandoned art\\". This is probably my favorite live recording, and has been for more than twenty years, and it still hasn't been released on DVD. Used VHS copies are available if you look. I don't know if the ones you'll find these days are also bootleg, but there was an official VHS release (and also a laserdisc release). As much as I dislike bootleggers, I can't really fault them for keeping this recording available.    The video is really low quality, the audio is marginal, and the audio and video are out of sync. Make sure you check out the alternate audio tracks, because the default track is bad.    Cyndi's goofy and doesn't connect well with the French audience, and Rick Derringer is a dork here, but the performance is very good. Look for the 1987 NY Times review. It's a 1987 recording, so don't expect recent songs.    All the stars I'm giving this are for the performance, which would rate 5-star if it was a quality, official release.    Edited to add: This review was for the Brazilian DVD bootleg of the 1987 live Paris show that aired on HBO in the 80's and was available on VHS and laserdisc. Amazon seems to have attached it to something different now that the Paris DVD is no longer available.
B000A6CLL0|4.0|I have to say I didn't realize the show had so much trouble with low audiences and budgets until I read the official review. We watched and recorded it avidly when it was a regular program. I bought Enterprise season 3 as a Mother's Day gift for my wife -- we already own the first two, and I'm giving her season 4 for her birthday.  We've been Star Trek fans since Picard and The Next Generation, but this is the best of the bunch, in my opinion. Season 3 exemplifies all the qualities that make Enterprise top of the heap -- great writing and acting in almost every moment of every episode. Archer ranks right up there with the other captains though his obsession with the Xindi threat (a logical response) sometimes makes him seem one-dimensional. The strong ensemble, however, makes up for that -- they all take turns as main characters in episodes and come off looking pretty good.  My family and I enjoy the trips back in time, especially one to earth's past (that life looks frighteningly familiar!) and one to transplanted earth natives trapped in the wild, wild west culture.  My younger son tells me I really nailed it as a husband when I bought this one. All in all, I'm glad we got it even though I wish they had dropped the price earlier. Oh well -- this show's worth it.
B00005JPKE|5.0|This movie is so great in so many ways.  I am not the biggest fan of Clint Eastwood, even as a director but can't deny he has talent.  This film is one I loved and will remember forever.  I am amazed that he was so willing to make the film in Japanese and worked so hard to make it as authentic as possible.  While Flags of Our Fathers comes out as too distant or false, this film comes with great feeling and insight.  It well deserved a nomination for Best Picture and probably should have won it.  I really appreciated this filma and highly recommend others to see it too.

0375831002|5.0|First Sentence:  First the colors.<br />Last Sentence:  I am haunted by humans.<br /><br />Death tells us the story of young Liesel Meminger who watched her brother die, her years with her foster parents, Hans and Rosa Hubermann, Max Steiner, the Jewish man they hid in their cellar, her best friend Rudy who wanted to be Jessie Owens, and her life on Himmel Street in Molching, Germany during World War II<br /><br />Although written as a book for young adults, this is one of the most stunningly beautiful, heart-wrenching tragic books I've read.  It made me laugh; it made me weep.<br /><br />Narrated by Death, the astonishingly visual descriptions at times amazed me. The characters are wonderful and tenderly brought to life. It is a story of love, courage, friendship and loss.<br /><br />It is a story of a love of reading, of stolen books and the power of words.  It makes me mindful of what is best, and worst, about us humans.  I, most of all, makes me grateful for my own passion for words, reading and books.<br /><br />I first listened to the audio version of this book.  Allan Corduner did an exceptional job brining this story to life.  I loved the story so much, I then read it in hardcover.<br /><br />The physical style of the way it was printed brought the story even more to live for me, and I had Corduner's voice in my head.<br /><br />There are a couple pieces of music that, when I heard them for the first time, I happened to be in the car and was so moved, I had to pull over, stop and listen.  I had the same reaction to this book, as it started.  The entire prologue of this book had me sitting in my car, pulled over off a very busy road, just listening.<br /><br />What can I say; Death is haunted by humans.  I was haunted, in the most wonderful way, by this book.
B000068TPN|5.0|Very good DVD .Mel Gibson did a great job on this movie.I highly recommend it.
0385340567|2.0|Not his best, alas, and it's hard to explain what's wrong without spoiling some of the plot points, but I'll try.  There were hints in past novels that author Lee Child is anti-military, despite all his military plotlines.  In this latest, his slip is showing big time.  The good guys are folks who are really fed up with the military.  The bad guys are active military, and even worse military contractors, and finally, the worst of all possible villains:  Christians.  Fundamentalist Christians.    Can anyone guess the intended victims of the Christians?  (Not a spoiler; it barely registers in the plot).    Canadians are singled out for particular praise because they were smart enough not to fight in Iraq.  And real American soldiers are opposed to the war in Iraq too because they're smart enough to see through the BS - just ask 'em, any one of 'em.  There's also a gratuitous horrors-of-war subplot which owes a substantial debt to Dalton Trumbo's \\"Johnny Got His Gun\\", if anyone still remembers that fine piece of propaganda.    The protagonist Jack Reacher has suddenly acquired an encyclopedic knowledge of Holy Scripture, which he quotes literally chapter and verse whenever it comes in handy, and specifically to put down fundamentalists who \\"cherrypick\\" the Bible to support their own agenda.  Kind of hard to swallow from our avowedly atheist action hero.    The main plot point is invalid as a matter of physics, and of medicine, but it is a very popular stalking horse of environmentalists and anti-war activists.  Similar stuff has been bubbling beneath the surface throughout the series, but this time Lee Child just couldn't stifle the politics.  Well, I don't need politics in a Reacher novel, and I'll bet you don't either.  Overall the series is still excellent, but don't start with this one or you'll be disappointed.

B000NY12CI|5.0|What's to say?  As fine a memoir as I've ever read.  Ayaan is born in Somalia, one step removed from a life as a desert nomad.  She quickly moves from being a diehard fundamentalist in Kenya & Saudi Arabia, to an Islamic apostate fleeing to the West, to a Dutch MP, to an international refugee in fear of her life.  And she faces each challenge with a courage I can only envy.  The wrtiting is clear and taut and as exciting as the best beach thriller.  She is an inspiration.
B0015XHQTE|5.0|What a bargain!  $60 is a major bargain for what you get.  In addition to the DH movies, you get a lot more cool memorabilia inside. I kept finding more things as I dug in there. How cool is this? A wallet with an inspector badge, a case file which is really neat, pics, books, etc. Even if you have the original DVDs...get this box set!
B001CD6FKI|1.0|A big mistake from the Wachowski Brothers. Fans of the Japanese animated series will scratch their heads over this garish big-screen disaster. In theory, most live-action cartoon adaptations represent a waste of film. &#34;Speed Racer&#34; is no exception. The 135-minute running time becomes a cinematic endurance test.

B0011HF6GE|5.0|As one of the likely thousands of folks who stumbled upon this album after \\"googling\\" the music from this Season's finale of House, M.D., I can only say that I wish I would have had this amazing disc in my collection months ago.  I typically don't enjoy highly inflected vocal performances (Iver sings in a consistant falsetto throughout the entire album) but here it is not obtrusive.  The innovative use of sounds, loops, etc, combined with Iver's falsetto don't get in the way at all of delievering a performance that is hauntingly beautiful and melodic.  A wonderful solo debut effort!

B001AIRUPE|5.0|Aaron has already pointed out the main announced difference between this Ultimate edition and the non-ultimate Collector's Edition, the numbered, hand-painted bust of Jack Skellington with his Sandy Claws hat and beard and a sound chip that plays quotes from the movie (with certificate of authenticity).  Amazon has since posted more details (above).  Looks like the bust will come in a special coffin-shaped box.  This edition will also have a booklet with the Nightmare Before Christmas poem, and an additional DVD for the digital copy.  Not sure what the advantage of the extra disc is.  It will cost you about an extra hundred bucks for those extras.  For that money, you may as well know about the movie and the other details of the set and the alternative new releases.<br /><br />The Nightmare Before Christmas is the kind of Christmas movie you might expect from Tim Burton (Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands): macabre, sort-of-but-not-too-scary, and ultimately good-humored and good-natured.  It's also quite a feat of animation, the first feature-length stop-action film.  And it's a musical!<br /><br />The story takes place in a world where the magical side of each major holiday is run by a specialized, hidden holiday town, like Santa's North Pole headquarters.  One year, the restless Jack Skellington of Halloween Town discovers Christmas Town, is very impressed, and decides Halloween Town should expand its horizons and take over Christmas that year.  Unfortunately, he and the other residents of his town don't understand Christmas as well as they do Halloween, and their basically well-intentioned efforts threaten to ruin Christmas altogether.<br /><br />The animation is highly imaginative and particularly well suited to the Halloween connections, as we would expect from a Burton-produced project.  The songs, by Danny Elfman, are catchy and fun, partly because of twisted but good-hearted subject matter.  There are scares, adventures, a romance, lessons learned, and a good Christmassy outcome.  Most kids and adults will be delighted, though parents may wish to consider the scary stuff for very young kids who don't like being scared.<br /><br />The Nightmare Before Christmas is returning to DVD in three editions, all with newly restored and remastered transfers.  For standard definition, there will be the 2-disc Collector's Edition ([[ASIN:B001AIRUOU here]]) and this Ultimate Collector's Edition, which will have the same features except for those mentioned above.  This will be the first time the movie will be available in anamorphic widescreen.  There will also be new special features.<br /><br />There will be a Blu-ray edition with the same DVD special features plus an exclusive intro by Burton ([[ASIN:B001AIRUP4 here]]).  There has been no announcement for a Blu-ray Ultimate edition with the bust, and I don't see a page for one here at Amazon.<br /><br />The new special features, shared by all the new new editions, are these:<br /><br />-- audio commentary with producer/writer Tim Burton, director Henry Selick and composer Danny Elfman (who also sings in the movie)<br />-- Burton's original \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" poem read by legendary horror actor Christopher Lee<br />-- new intro by Burton for Frankenweenie (see below)<br />-- a digital copy of the movie<br />-- \\"What's This?

No mention either of the DTS 5.1 sound option included on the Special Edition.  The sound will be Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround, aspect ratio 1.66:1 (original format).<br /><br />Looks like an excellent set.  The video and sound quality of the previous DVD was excellent, and Disney claims the new anamorphic version will be even better.kenweenie, Burton's early short live-action film wherein the basic events of Frankenstein are played out in suburban America, with a young boy in the place of Dr. Frankenstein and a pet dog in the place of the monster (29:50)    There's no mention in the press release of the old commentary with Selick and director of photography Pete Kozachik, which went into detail about the technical aspects of the animation.

0060872675|3.0|I kind of thought this book would be more like the fictional book \\"Where's my Cow?\\" described in \\"Nightwatch\\", instead it is a mix of that and the book Sam Vimes thought it should be.     The difference is that the first would be enjoyed by the child, the other would be more enjoyed by a fan of Terry pratchett who is reading to a child.

B001A3EM8M|3.0|When it came down to 1988, it was a banner year for the Traveling Wilburys bringing in a lot of joy and excitement into a mainstream audience with the teaming of Roy Orbison, Tom Petty, Jeff Lynne of Eletric Light Orchestra, George Harrison, and Bob Dylan. With Traveling Wilburys which showed and delivered a lot of promise into a classic Rock vibe that delivered to audiences young and old. Sadly, Roy passed away shortly after Volume 1 was released and there was a lot of pressure for the classic group to make another record, without Roy in their lives. But, the group which became a foursome actually did, and after over 10 years out of print, it finally has a new ligth for record buyers everywhere.<br /><br />The 2008 re-release of the Traving Wilburys second and final album, awkwardly titled Volume 3 has finally been released. The album which was featured in last years' Traveling Wilburys Anthology which did very well for listeners of all ages, has now been re-released as a single disc album to a whole new generation. While Volume 3 doesn't appeal as well as 1988's Volume 1, the songs have all been restored and brilliantly reintroduced to a new generation of record buyers and MP3 players. The album does have some great songs which include Inside Out, the upbeat Wilbury Twist, and the little-known classic She's My Baby. The re-release also includes B-Sides including the 60's Rock-inspired track Runaway as well as Nobody's Child. While the album has been restored well, the feeling of the album just doesn't appeal as vividly as did Volume 1, because the group wasn't complete without Roy Orbison. Still, the foursome managed to put out a strong guilty pleasure for those who've loved the first Traveling Wilburys album.<br /><br />All in all, if you've already purchased last years' Traveling Wilburys Anthology, there is really no need to buy Volume 3. On top of that, Volume 3 doesn't haven't the strength that Volume 1 had delivered, and it also was very sad the group has disbanded after Volume 3 came out. Still if you're a fan of guilty pleasure music, I suggest you get a good hard listen to this album and hear that magical Wilbury excitement all over again.<br /><br />Album Cover: B<br /><br />Songs: C 1/2-<br /><br />Price: C<br /><br />Remastering: B-<br /><br />Overall: Clume 3 came out.

B00164FLC6|5.0|I'm tired of reading negative comments about this movie. It's not Gone With the Wind, Citizen Kane, Fellini or Ang Lee. People have been complaining about product placement, toilet jokes, bad writing. It is what it is...a fun movie. Everyone hates it except the movie going public who spent 58 milllion dollars to see it the weekend it opened.
B000059XUO|5.0|I love this movie and this edition with all of the extras did not disappoint.  Great interviews and behind-the-scenes stuff perfectly complement a fantastic movie.  I'd recommend this in a heartbeat.
0743290119|1.0|trust me, I wanted to like this book as much as the next person. I enjoyed Lauren's previous two books, and had high hopes for this one. However, I found the plot line of this weak, the story line totally unbelievable and the conclusion totally contrived. It almost seems like she phoned this one in, cashed her check and left us to pick up the pieces.  Save your money; I wish i had.
0066620996|4.0|Jim Collins and his research team have done an extraordinary job! There is a reason why this book has sold way over two million copies and why it was named the #1 Bestseller.       When I first purchased a copy of the book and flipped through the pages, I was a little overwhelmed with all the charts illustrated throughout the text. I thought to myself, \\"oh no, it's going to be another book where I will be hugging the dictionary and scratching my head!\\" However, it was nothing that I had predicted. It was so easy to read and comprehend as every chart and figure was carefully explained and simply exemplified.       What I enjoyed most about reading the book was the fact that everything here is common sense, nothing is new. For example, we know that hiring the right people is essential in running a great company and being able to insert them into the right tasks (their strengths) will not only create a better working atmosphere and environment, but establishes a comfort zone and constructs a relationship between management and employee in regards to trust and understanding. Additionally, as in every company, the sooner the company is able to understand, accept, and confront their brutal facts (weaknesses), then the better and stronger the company can become. \\"Good to great companies faced just as much adversity as the comparison companies, but responded to that adversity differently.\\"  Lastly, knowing and understanding what you are passionate about, what you can be the best in the world at, and getting paid to do just that will help push and drive yourself to become Great, as the motivation is there.       This is all common sense knowledge, and a stroke of genius on how Jim Collins and his research team were able to validate and justify it. They have proven what we know is true and what we know should work with years of research through company comparisons and specific examples.       Overall, this is definitely a book worth purchasing. It provides numerous examples of specific scenarios that reflect the concepts and theory related. And most notably, it is written so simply that a sixth grade student will be able to understand it.

B000IU3XU6|5.0|I've loved Josh since the start and this is the best album he has ever released.  The songs are all so beautiful and it is the album you can listen to from start to finish.  Josh's voice is breathtaking and so soothing.  Everyone should own this album.    Top songs:  February Song (to me, it's the best song he has ever released)  Now or Never  Solo Por Ti  Mai  In Her Eyes  Machine  Verita
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|Yet another refreshing take on the ordinary things that life throws at us albeit it a 'little' outrageous. As usual the British take on comedy is A1, full of clever wit,innuendo, and black humour. My ribs were aching by the end!
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|Cloverfield is not clever. It is not the first time that a film has used the gimmick of being shot by handheld camera. A better movie to have been done in this style would be The Blair Witch Project. At least The Blair Witch didn't give me a headache, and was actually creepy in the end.  Cloverfield is not terrifying. I was not on the edge of my seat. I did not care about the characters. The monsters were not very frightening. It lacks intensity.  Cloverfield is not worth your time or money. The whole beginning of the film is worthless. They wait way too long to bring in the monsters. There's this big part about this guy's girlfriend that is boring and you will not care about that takes up a long time. That beginning part should be introducing you to the characters and making you care about what happens to them, but it is not effective in doing that at all.  I wish I had skipped this one.
1595141715|1.0|If a book could be rated R this one would be. It was a wonderful idea but, the book is just full of foul language and underage drinking and sex.  No teen should read this book with out a parent reading it first with a follow up discussion afterward.
0452287588|5.0|This book is enlightening and a fast read. You will enjoy your life more if you live in the present and realize all else is a construct of the ego and the intellect. I have read many spiritual books on Buddhism as well as other religions, but this one rises above the formality of religion and gets to the heart of spirituality.
B0011UBDTK|1.0|I had the same issues that other reviewers experienced with the DVD's. Amazon has sent me two different sets and neither will play several episodes in Season 3. I also tried multiple DVD players and computers.    There is something wrong with the manufacturing of this product.
0061245097|5.0|I liked it that the heroine was a dhampire, half vampire, half human.  She is strong and really kicks butt!  Very fun reading.
B000KJT8IG|4.0|Classic Christmas movie - in the H-D Format movies never looked better,   that along with a great price, and good extras. A must have to get through the holidays.
B000QCQ9O8|5.0|I truly believe there is no better book. \\"Atonement\\" is so beautifully written, there are no down parts, no slow parts, no boring parts. The author could be talking about paint drying and you still wouldn't be able to put the book down. One sentence just flows into another so much that you're pulled forward, and you're on your way. McEwan is now one of my favorite writers.     Of course it's not for everyone, though. Nothing is. If you enjoy simpler books and quicker reads, then you may not enjoy it. This book will make you think. You have to like that. Atonement is for someone who wants something meaningful, something that explores human emotion, and something that isn't afraid to break your heart in the end. Don't read it if you're one of those people who feel \\"tricked\\" at endings that don't turn out the way you expect or want. The ending of this book changes everything, so much, in fact, that I had to reread the entire thing over with the ending in mind to grasp everything from that new point of view. I can't emphasise enough that this is one book you shouldn't go without reading. Wonderful.
B0013FBS20|3.0|Enjoyed this in the theaters, even better on the big screen at home.   all the extras are great, and the picture is amazing in 1080p. Big Will Smith fan, although didn't think this story was the best.
0312370830|4.0|I knew very little about the book beforehand & really enjoyed the story. The scenes depicted are entirely plausible especially if you have knowledge of the war or have visited places like Dacow (though that camp was not referred to in this book). I found it light reading for a heavy topic & it kept me up late in the evenings wondering what would happen next. I look forward to her next book.
B000P6YNSE|4.0|What makes a show like \\"Alias\\" or \\"Lost\\" strange is that they're entirely built on mysteries and double crosses, questions and answers and finding out what they all mean is the fun. Sure we can knock the show for drawing out its answers a bit too long and revisiting might lose that mystery because we now know what it all means, it's always great to get immersed into a show that doesn't involve a crime being solved in an hour. But even the great shows stumble and season 3 is one season where there's enough promise and greatness to outweigh the flaws but just too bad the flaws are just so visible.    Season 3 opens with Jack, Kate and Sawyer held hostage by the Others; Sayid, Sun and Jin are on a sailboat attempting to rescue them while Locke and Desmond deal with the fallout of the electromagnetic explosion that happened at the hatch. But naturally there's plenty to branch off from as answers (some) are revealed, new ones are introduced and some characters won't survive till the end.    I tried to be as broad and general as I can since the fun of a show like this is getting caught up in it and not really worrying that you've watched a good number of episodes in one go. And watching it on DVD or Blu-ray helps the flow of the season well since disappointment isn't as easy to get when you don't have to wait a week or deal with frequent commercial interruptions. A lot happens in this season, some of it surprising and some...strange but the show creators don't so much stumble as they occasionally drop the ball then bounce back.    The first ball drop is the opening set of episodes before a long break which dealt rather heavily on Jack, Kate and Sawyer's time in captivity with the Others. While it introduces their society and some motivations and a new main character, it feels strangely sluggish and the show just kind of limps along for awhile. Then there's the new characters Nikki and Paulo which deserve their dislike from fans since it seemed like a good idea to try rather than something vitally integral to the show. But then the show gets into the swing of things and twists add plenty of fuel for the mythology and the 2 part finale is quite the whopper for changing the show around. But as you can probably guess, some of the answers seem slightly frustrating as if the show's winking at us in a \\"this is all you're getting\\" way. One of the mysteries surrounding the Others was their kidnapping of several flight survivors and the reveal or shall we say, the tease, of what happens to them is just silly.     There's a lot of episodes that are great here to exceptional to just merely serviceable. Ones like \\"Man Behind the Curtain\\" (complete with creepy late night cabin visit), \\"Man From Tallahassee\\" and the 2 part \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" are season highlights and it's worth checking out the season if you're a Lost fan. Just be prepared for some...iffy parts along the way.
0743298039|5.0|I found this to be such a good read. The characterization was magnificent! The tale was so intrigueing, and I stayed up into the night-I had to find out what happened next.<br /><br />I loved the description, also. It was so good-I could place myself in the story. The author described everything thoroughly-to an exactness of storytelling. There was not any vagueness-all was crystal clear.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend this book, and I will read the author's next work.
B00125WAWS|5.0|DEFINITELY A GREAT MOVIE!!  You can't \\"DEBATE IT!!\\"  I STRONGLY RECOMMEND ANYONE TO ADD THIS ONE TO THEIR COLLECTION!!!!!!  I LOVE YOU DENZEL!!
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|What a stunning record, not a bad track on the whole thing. Unlike many of todays records that just recycle the same song over and over, here there are 12 distinct different styles to the tracks. I download and listen to new music daily and have been for years, i know what's good and what isn't, this thing smokes your speakers on a number of tracks.    For people complaining that she doesn't sound like she did in the 70's well get over it, to by honest most of that stuff was tried and repetitive after awhile. These tracks certainly sound fresh and will for sometime to come. And once again to those people complaining about her processed voice in areas, i wonder how 'n' heck your voice is going sound when you are 59 years old.
1416550518|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. I hated to see it end and that's a rare comment from me.  Like Rebecca and titles by Victoia Holt and Susan Howatch, Kate Morton exhibits a wonderful flair for Gothic writing. SWo much so that at times, I felt as if I was at a ball at Riverton swirling in my party dress.<br /><br />I won't repeat a synopsis of the story since so may other reviewers have alrady done this but will urge you to read this book as soon as you can.  While smem are comparing The House at Riverton to The Thirteenth Tale by Diane Setterfield, in my opinion this is the better of the two books.<br /><br />A wonderful tale which combines a good storyline with great characters and just enough mystery to keep one turning the pages quickly. I wouldn't steer you wrong as I now reread this tile. LOL
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|Yeah, I don't buy many movies, as I generally only watch a movie once ever. But after watching Once about the 5th time, I decided this would make a good video to double my video collection.   It's an incredibly hard movie to explain- It's so different than anything else I've seen. I've watched it with 20+ people, probably, and no one has ever not liked it. It's pretty amazing. The music is downright awesome.   Can you tell I liked this movie?
0525457585|5.0|I don't often read books.  I think I can say that I've read about as many books as I have fingers.  I also can say that this books is so precious to me that I have it in hardcover.  On top of that, this is the first review I've ever written.    I'm 29 years old and this by far is and is not a children's book.  It's good fantasy for a child's mind, but it is so much more.  If you aren't into philosophy, then you will miss so much that this book has to offer.  But to each their own.    Being a child of the 80's, I had certainly watched and enjoyed the movie.  But the movie totally misses the point of what Michael Ende was trying to convey.  And I don't blame Mr. Ende for wanting to have nothing to do with the movie (they snuck his name in in the credits).  I hope to see a remake of the movie that actually sticks to the story within my lifetime.  Regardless, I have the book.    The message of this book is so powerful.  The journey it takes you on is necessary for the end to have its full impact.  The way it touches on reality is so phenomenal.    If you want to read about the human journey, this is the book for you.  The conclusion brings purpose, not only to the main character, but a reminder to you.    What are we living for?  Read and find out.
B0013FNC38|5.0|This CD is fantastic. Mixture of pop, folk, funk, rock.  I love it almost as much as his first one.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|This is the musically vision of \\"The Heroin Diaries\\" by: Nikki Sixx. There are songs where you'll feel alive and no matter what you're going through, everything will be ok. However, there are songs that make you see and feel the demons of your mind. It's all like a beautiful nightmare that will make you want to take a cold shower, but at the same time, smile. There has never been an album that has made me feel an intense, emotional feeling within me like this. It is ,without a doubt, a masterpiece.
B000Y1ZXUM|4.0|Great musics<br />Great sound (PCM 5.1)<br />Great performance (shakira's)<br />Good video... (the quality is great but the producers of the show... hum... well.. they did everything red most of the time. I didn't like it)
0743486285|5.0|This is the story of a man who was at the height of his career while hitting rock bottom and it's so haunting because it's all true. It's not a cookie cutter vision of being a junkie. It's rawr and naked. It doesn't matter whether you don't like Motley Crue or even know who the hell Nikki Sixx is. It will keep you wanting to read more and more. Sixx did NOT release his diary to make a quick buck, but to stop others from going down the same path as he did. If it only helped one person, it still would've made a difference.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|Well.. this is a great classic movie. You can't expect much, because it is already an OLD movie! But the sound and image quality are great on this bluray!<br /><br />The 5-disc pack is very cool. Just wondering if I will have patience to see the other 4 discs... lol!
0446402389|5.0|GREAT POLICE PROCEDURAL AND LOVE STORY. THIS STORY IS ABOUT A COUPLE WHO HAVE SUSTAINED ATROCITIES AND SEEN HORRIFIC TORTURES OF INNOCENT PEOPLE,BY THE RUSSIANS IN CHARGE OF THE STATE. A STORY OF REDEMPTION AND LOVE. A REAL PAGE TURNER, COULD NOT PUT THE BOOK DOWN. LOVED EVERY PAGE OF IT
B000YEUUCK|5.0|I just say this Blu-Ray is perfect! It also have all backstage activity during the show. So you can rewatch the show, but taking a look at the backstage.. it is just awsome!<br /><br />Picture and sound quality impressive! Blu-Ray arrived to stay!
032147404X|5.0|Great how to without tons of theory. Just good advice.    Super cheesy chapter introductions, but not overly distracting, and overall an excellent book for the beginner and intermediate photographer.
0385333846|3.0|Okay--so the juxtaposition of war, time travel, and alien abduction was certainly inventive, and Vonnegut's deadpan frankness in dealing with the book's subject matter would have been fairly revolutionary for the time.  The book is also brilliantly structured--jumping from fragment to fragment of Billy Pilgrim's life with masterful control and timing--all without a boring or confusing moment.  I can see why the book is considered a classic, and it's probably deserving of that label.  I still didn't like it.    A label of which the book isn't deserving is \\"anti-war.\\"  I was surprised to see several reviews rhapsodize about Vonnegut's \\"screaming rage\\" against the absurdity and tragedy of war, so much so that I began to wonder if I had indeed read \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" and not some other acclaimed novel involving the Dresden firebombing and Tralfamadorians.   If anything, the book is about accepting war and tragedy as part of life and trying to deal with it.  The book is depressingly (and, after a while, rather annoyingly) blasé about death, no matter how horrible or unjust.  Death by assassination?  So it goes.  Death by gangrene?  So it goes.  Death by torture?  So it goes.  Thousands killed in the firebombing of Dresden?  So it goes.  I realize that Vonnegut experienced the firebombing firsthand and that the subject is probably one of great personal importance to him--which only makes me wonder why the event isn't given any more emotional weight.  The novel almost feels like an attempt by Vonnegut to ameliorate the tragedy, rather than to make any meaningful statement about it.  Or maybe the amelioration is his statement.  At any rate, I also missed the apparently abundant black humor.  There is an almost overwhelming amount of tragedy within the novel's slim frame, with the only ray of \\"hope\\" being that, in the big picture, the life of the individual doesn't really matter anyway.  If you find that notion funny, you'll probably pick up on the humor.  And like the book.    As a side note, I found \\"The Wind-up Bird Chronicle\\" by Haruki Murakami, while wildly different in many aspects, to be oddly similar to \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" in both subject matter and in its juxtaposition of war brutality and fantasy.  While Kurt Vonnegut undoubtedly displays a finer control of lanuage, I found Haruki Murakami's approach funnier, more affecting, more emotionally satisfying--and, if possible, even weirder.
0452273331|2.0|I like to read what other successful, powerful people read. So when I heard that Marc Cuban swore by Ayn Rand's \\"The Fountainhead\\" I ran here to Amazon to get it.<br /><br />Written in the mid 30's, this is a VERY wordy book. Don't misunderstand...I like to read and am not put off by words...but far too much time was spent describing one's dress or the shape of one's face or the color brick of a building or...<br /><br />Further, and more importantly, this is a book about unhappy people trying to find fulfillment in life without giving up their values and morals. On teh surface, that sounds Inspiring. However, 90% of the characters in this book are unscrupulous and immoral. The lone purvveyor of integrity goes thru life struggling to stay employed, and ultimately commits a crime so dangerous that you simply cannot understand how he's a 'good guy'.<br /><br />And speaking to THAT last point: when you read his Courtroom monolouge, and then see how the jury voted, you will laugh OUT LOUD. No, it's not meant to be funny. It's implausable. In fact, it's improbable.<br /><br />Perhaps in 1938 this was a motivational, inspirational tome.<br />I think I'll stick to Brian Tracy and Tony Robbins.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This was completely worth the money.  I bought this for my kids but I didn't think that they would like it as much as they did.  They loved watching all of them.  They still want to watch them time and time again.  My kids are 2 and 6.

B00004XMTJ|4.0|As a longtime fan of \\"Cats,\\" I have seen the musical multiple times on Broadway in New York City in addition to traveling companies in Wilmington, DE and Philadelphia, PA.      I cannot tell you how excited I was when I first heard that \\"Cats\\" was going to be released on video in 1998. I remember buying the video the week it came out and watched it many times. Now that the world has largely transitioned to DVD, I recently bought the DVD version of this great musical, and here is my review.     Seeing the musical shot in such close proximity gives you a view of the stage and the cats themselves that you simply cannot experience from a theater seat.  The costumes are brilliantly designed, and the stage props and lighting is elaborate.      While I enjoy the additional musical instruments in the orchestra, my feelings are divided about how the cast was brought together for the film. The cast is a mixture of members from Broadway and international companies, and while the voices blend fairly well together overall, there are parts of the musical where the differing voices and accents are somewhat distracting. I feel that some voices/characters in this cast are not up to par with the Original Broadway Cast that I grew up listening to, the most notable being the voices behind \\"Skimbleshanks,\\" \\"Jellylorum,\\" and \\"Mongojerrie and Rumpleteazer.\\" Other voices/characters are equal to and even surpass the Original Broadway Cast, including the great \\"Mr. Mistoffelees,\\" \\"The Rum Tum Tugger,\\" \\"Munkustrap,\\" \\"Grizabella\\" voiced by London original Elaine Paige, and \\"Old Deuteronomy\\" voiced by Broadway original Ken Page.     I am glad that Webber decided to film additional musical sequences that were cut from the Original Broadway Cast recording, including musical outros for songs like \\"The Old Gumbie Cat\\" and \\"The Rum Tum Tugger\\", additional verses & dance for \\"Bustopher Jones,\\" \\"Skimbleshanks,\\" and \\"Mr. Mistoffelees,\\" and the hilarious \\"Awful Battle of the Pekes and Pollicles\\" in itsentirety, which was completely cut from the Original Broadway Cast due to time constraints.     However, the fact that \\"Growltiger's Last Stand\\" was omitted from Act 2 is a disappointment, to say the least. This song is one of the highlights of Act 2 and it is a shame that it was not included for this film. But, given the choice whether to have \\"Growltiger\\" or \\"The Pekes and Pollicles,\\" I would probably choose the \\"Pekes\\" simply because we have never had a recorded version of this song before.     Despite these small criticisms, this film is a wonderful adaptation of the famous Broadway musical and has high recommendations from me.
B00168ML1G|5.0|I never see movies twice in the theater, and I think I'm going to see this one a third time. They did everything right - it's fun, fascinating, adventurous, funny, touching, and the chemistry between Robert Downey Jr and Gwenyth Paltrow is spellbinding. GREAT MOVIE!!

B000OVLBGC|5.0|American college campuses overflow with devotees of Communism. The media are loaded with people who think Che Guevera was a hero and that the United States was wrong for resisting Communism.'<br /><br />  And then along comes a movie like \\"The Lives Of Others\\". Yes, it is a dramatization. No, the Stasi did not lavish two or more full time agents on a relatively minor dissident like the playwright here, Georg Dreyman. Yes, Communist bureaucrats did destroy the lives of others, as the Minister of Culture does here in pursuit of Dreymans girlfriend, Christa-Maria Sieland.<br /><br />  The hero is Hauptmann Wiesler, a Stasi Colonel. Tasked to nail Dreyman for something, anything, Wiesler becomes disillusioned as he realizes that his venal boss is so willing to destroy lives in order to curry favor with his higher-ups. Wiesler becomes sympathetic to his intended prey, which is unlikely to have happened in the real German Democratic Republic worker's paradise.<br /><br />  Bit by bit, Wiesler becomes a subversive himself as he discovers his own humanity.<br /><br />  The cat-and-mouse game between hunted and hunter, state servant and obsequious bureaucrat builds to somewhat predictable, but still suspenseful climax, as the Communist bureaucrats are flummoxed.<br /><br />  The end of the film plays out against the fall of the Wall and the dissolution of the German Communist state. Wiesler's Stasi is no more. The corrupt Communist leaders become ordinary citizens, stripped of their powers over the lives of others. Dreyman goes on to prosper in the new freedom, still haunted by his experience. Wiesler, once a godlike figure over his hapless victims, becomes a victim himself, but a noble one.<br /><br />  Overall, a chilling story and an honest metaphor for the horror that was a Communist nation where no one had a right to privacy.<br /><br />Jerry
B0010V4TZU|4.0|Vampire Weekend's name, which is also the name of their debut CD, is in no way indicative of their music style. The name screams dark goth synthesizers being overlayed by screeching a-melodic guitars and pounding drums. The actual music though, is pure reggae-rock beach-chair relaxation. And the lyrics are what you'd expect from 4 Columbia University graduates.  [...]

B000I2J6K0|3.0|While the workout itself is challenging and fairly interesting, the quality of the DVD is very poor. It creates a distraction from the workout. She is appears to have her husband recording the video in her living room. I also would have preferred a little more of a cardio aspect to the workout, this DVD tends to focus on more stationary exercises that help work the muscles but not necessarily get the heart-rate up. Overall it is worth doing if you have other DVD's to fall back on, because repeated use of this one would get dull pretty quick.
0061122416|1.0|This is one of the most ridiculous books I've ever read.  I only picked it up to see what all the fuss was about.  It turns out that it's not about much.  Coelho fancies himself as a Hemingway of sorts, using simple language rather than being unnecessarily verbose.  But he ends up doing something more like Hemingway's pal Fitzgerald, getting really bogged-down in exposition without advancing the story.  What really confuses me is how they are going to make this into a film.  However they manage to do it, I hope they make it better than the book.  It simply can't be much duller or worse.  And Julia Roberts really hasn't read much if she considers this her favorite book.    What You Should Stick To Instead:  The Old Man and the Sea (by far the best novella dealing with spiritual awakening)  The Living (Pascale Kramer)  The Sibyl (Par Lagerkvist)
0452289963|4.0|This book, so far, has been instrumental in helping me to live in the present and to shake off all the nonsense which has turned out to be just that, nonsense.<br />The book could be difficult to read at times.

B00000DWG6|5.0|Here's the original CD release of Live At Leeds, like the LP, just six tracks. It was released to resemble a inferior bootleg album, with crackling noises heard and a simple looking jacket. Now, I know you can get the two later rereleases with the rest of the concert added, then all of Tommy added, too. Those are great CDs. But if you want to hear Live At Leeds the way The Who originally released it, you have to get this version! Young Man Blues is here in its edited form, Pete's solo is a bit shorter, but flows better. And Magic Bus has the backwards bit for a few bars before Roger starts singing, only on this! This IS one of those low budget CDs (hey, like the original) with a minimal amount of info in the \\"booklet\\", but it does show that photo of Pete jumping with his guitar over his head with thousands of people in the audience-the same photo was included in the original album extras. It does state that it was recorded Feb. 14, 1970 except for Young Man Blues which was recorded December 26, 1968. I've never heard about this before; I don't believe that it is correct. I'm sure the whole concert was recorded at Leeds University at the same time. Well, for a budget CD you can expect some incorrect information! Regardless, this is a fine addition to your Who collection.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|Thank You - I love it!!!    CAn't wait till the third series is out now!!!
B0018QCXGY|5.0|It really seems that most movies these days fall into one of several categories:<br /><br />1. Shoot-em-ups<br />2. Sequels, Prequils and the sort<br />3. Chick-flicks<br />4. Scary movies<br />5. Mindless comedies<br /><br />In your typical shoot-em-ups, the hero saves the world from impending doom while maximizing collateral damage to the bad guys. Wow, shocker.<br /><br />Sequels, etc are typically not as good as the originals and its just more of the same.<br /><br />Chick-flicks are dramas where the guy gets the girl in the end.<br /><br />Scary movies have moments that might creep you out, plenty of things jumping out at you and maybe some ghouls mixed in for good measure, but its still cheap thrills in the end.<br /><br />Finally, comedies are just some cute way to fit a stand-up routine in with somewhat of a story.<br /><br />Cloverfield, however, does not fit into any of these categories. It's a refreshing new way to communicate a simple message in a realistic kind of way. The most interesting part is the realism of the movie (save the one leap of logic: the giant monster rampaging through New York). Sure, the government would get involved, and sure, the resulting actions are all logical and probably what would really happen. Interesting movie and worth the investment to see a couple of times.
B000XTLUW0|5.0|Quick and to the point...if you are a fan of Muse, or even just a fan of live music, then please, please buy this.

B00127RAJY|4.0|If you are looking for something to get moving to, this is great.  Jillian varies the activities, and gets muscles moving!  Do be careful: the video does not explain specifics on doing the exercises correctly and the warm-ups and cool downs leave a little left to be desired.   Give your self extra time for viewing and doing the video b/c of the start-up time on the the disk. Also, because of the added time for warming up and cooling down, the video does take longer than the advertized time limit of the actual work-out - more like 30 minutes.    I was surprised that the actual time of having your heart rate up was less than 30 minutes as trainers, etc all over the US are saying that one should keep his/her heart rate up for 30 min during exercise for optimal fitness and health.
0316143472|5.0|David Sedaris's new book is finally out after me waiting, like, a whole month for it.  It's about time.  My only question is, why is he spending so much effort making appearances when he should be back at home writing another book?  Anyway, this is just an introduction to say everyone should buy this book, like 10 copies at least, to give away to nephews, nieces, aunts, neighbors, people in the check out line at the grocery store who smile at you, and just about anyone else you come across who knows the words to Isn't It Lovely.  And I guess I don't mind that he's touring.  I'm sure he needs a break and to socialize from time to time.  If anything, it's another way he can gather more material for more stories.  Excellent job Mr. Sedaris.  I'm a big fan.  THANKS.
0571226167|5.0|In my neurotic workings to make myself a more literate & urbane creature, i've undertaken a number of the recommended \\"reading lists\\" that have come to plague my life, psyche and bank account.  To many of you who have probably already read this novel and are just glazing your brain away at amazon reviews, you will not be suprised the Mrs. Plath's novella graced a spot on many of the said lists.  Also, over the years i've always come to notice the books reputation, often for darkness.  Naturally being a guy, i've also not failed to notice that the Bell Jar is often a well placed accessory of many if the stylish thinking-girl types.(I swear i've not met a man who has read it, or admits to having read it)<br />  So I plunged into it, expecting a maddening, dark tale that would explain the trend of certain girls who like to cut themselves.  Instead I was just impressed that i could see the very honest report of feelings of depression and anxiety.  It wasn't really dark at all I felt, it just showed well what it is like to be in that realm of detachment and uncertainity that a great deal of youths have found themselves in.  I almost hate to say it because i know that it is trite, but the novel makes a good companion piece with Salinger's Catcher in the Rye.  The book was enough to make me interested in Plaths poetry as well,(i'm very interested in reading Ariel), and now I feel I can property join the thousands of others who are sad that such a talent was been snuffed out so early and unable to have a full life of work within the realm of American letters.

0792163710|5.0|'shane' is my favorite western. it's just about perfect and ,i think, everything that could be said about this film has been said. i would only like to add why ,imho, shane didn't respond to joey's cries of \\"come back, shane!\\" i believe that shane didn't want to die in front of joey.  shane was gut shot by palance, and if you watch closely as shane rides off, just before the film ends, you can see shane's hand stiffen up. he's dead.  that's my observation, although some others believe that shane couldn't return because he had fallen in love with jean arthur.  unlike another western classic 'red river,' this movie had a great ending.  believe what you will, but i really think shane died in the saddle.

B00000ILDE|3.0|Sigourney Weaver is the only really good cast member of this movie.  The little girl is 2nd.  Otherwise, the acting is just horribly bad.    The movie has none of the subtle menace of the original.  The original was a work of art.  This is just a (too-long) popcorn flick.      The special effects are very nice.  But please, the props are \\"dated\\" because Ridley Scott's high standards of set design were allowed to erode.  This is how you raise the budget hugely, yet end up with a cheaper-looking movie as a result.    Don't get me wrong, this is an entertaining movie despite some horrible, cringe-worthy acting and poor editing.  But the original was a masterwork.  Don't confuse the two.

The acting was good the special effects were a treat and the story line played out very well!<br />One thing I have learned: when a movie is over-advertised to the Nth degree and/or it carries a list of current rock bands designed to boost ticket sales, chances are it isn't any good!  Whereas with Hellboy, although I don't think I saw it advertised much, it seems like the less advertisement the better!<br />I recommend this movie to any sci-fi/action buff!
B000HEVZ6W|5.0|\\"Gattaca\\" is the perfect example of how a very good movie can be made without spending tons of money producing it. All the emphasis is placed on the story, a very good story I might add,  rather than dazzling special effects and inner ear damaging surround sound. Hollywood should take some lessons from this film and give the public more fare that uplifts and inspires rather than the apocalyptic doom and gloom they keep pushing on us. I try to rent movies on blu ray before I buy them to see if they are worth the additional cost, which is what I did here.  The Blockbuster copy I rented, was excellent, has a lot more zip and sparkle than the dvd version that I own.  The Amazon price is right and I will be buying the blu ray version.

B000I2J6K0|5.0|I got this video because I was looking for one that had a shorter workout for the days where I couldn't fit in a whole hour.  I also was intriqued by the reviews for Erin O'Brien's workout.<br /><br />Once you get past the cheesy \\"You're Pregnant!\\" montage at the beginning (and the pimping out of her husband James Denton of Desperate Housewives fame) you get to an incredibly intense workout.<br /><br />O'Brien is very likeable with her makeup-free, low ponytail look.  She is wearing a simple gray tank and olive yoga pants with a couple of inches of her belly showing (yes, a video where the instructor herself is pregnant!).  The video takes place in her living room, she is free of fancy backdrops or fellow exercisers.  Occasionally the lighting changes to show her at silhouette so you can better see her form.  She isn't overly chipper and plastic, but feels like a real person, a friend or a personal trainer.<br /><br />You will need a sturdy dining table chair that won't skid across the floor (for triceps dips), a coffee table, couch arm, and wall nearby.  A mat or towel is also required.  I don't have the non-skid chair so I repeat a different arm exercise.<br /><br />I currently do yoga 3-4 times a week and walk 2-3 times a week.  I am still in my first trimester.  I found this to be a good workout - writing this the morning after yesterday's run with the video, I feel my muscles got a good workout - especially those in my legs.  The video was at a fast enough pace that I broke a sweat, but never was panting or overheated.  I must say, I kept thinking, \\"if this woman who is in her third trimester can do it, I better be able to!\\"  O'Brien's laid-back personality and attitude also made me want to work with her, and not hate her (which I usually feel after a couple views of a workout video).<br /><br />The video is broken into four sections, and are clearly explained.  Once in the exercises, you may for a second feel confused because of weird camera angles, poor sound when they are shooting her from above, or overly creative camera editing.  However these aren't terribly often or long and you can easily catch up and get the gist of what is taking place.  The music is subtle which is good because it's a bit annoying (up-tempo instrumental versions of nursery rhymes).<br /><br />The studio is her living room, and it's not really large.  I too have a tiny living room, slippery wood floors and a lot of furniture and was able to do the entire routine in my little space in front of the TV with no issue.<br /><br />O'Brien reminds you many times to drink water and pauses the exercise to drink herself.  She encourages you to take pee breaks when necessary, and offers alternate exercises if you are panting or feeling overheated.  She concentrates on those muscles that will be needed for delivery, but I feel as though I get an all-over great workout from this routine!when they are shooting her from above, or overly creative camera editing.

0140277447|4.0|The Rape of Nanking is historically accurate.  Since I have lived in China for a very long time, I have heard about this horrible massacre since I was a little girl.  I have heard in news that Japan had concealed this event even from its own people.  The leaders of the country had been in denial of this whole historical event for many years.  The teachers had taught the students the false information in their history class.  I even heard that Japan had burned those textbook that included the details about the Rape of Nanking.  Japan had really infuriated the Chinese people by not facing what they had done decades ago.  These things were all revealed in this book.  Although The American Pageant did not really talk about the Rape of Nanking, we did learn from the textbook that Japan tried to follow Germany's path to take control over the continent of Asia, including China.  This fact led to the great massacre and was included in The Rape of Nanking.<br />The author of this text, Iris Chang, had heard about the Rape of Nanking when she was little.  She heard this from her parents, who had immigrated to America from China during World War II.  Therefore, she had the background information about this event.  However, she said in the book that the Nanking Massacre had \\"remained buried in the back of mind as a metaphor for unspeakable evil\\" because she had never found any books in any public libraries that had been written about this massacre.  Thus this triggered her to collect information to write a book about this.  The text interprets the Rape of Nanking as inhuman.  The book describes all the details about the tortures and killings that happened during the massacre as well as the data of the total number of people who died during the seven weeks.  The text also records how Japan had kept the massacre as a secret to the rest of the world.  The book hence has exposed the truth the public about the event and criticized the lies that Japan has been using for years.<br />Iris Chang said in the book that \\"the Rape of Nanking should be remembered not only for the number of people slaughtered but for the cruel manner in which many met their deaths.\\"  I believe the author really wanted the audience to understand the pain that many had suffered during the massacre rather than just simply knowing how many people had been killed during this event.  The text also helps the readers to understand that not all historical events will be revealed in the light because some of them will be concealed by the government or denied by the government.<br />I would recommend this book to anybody, especially those people who are interested in Asian history.  I really wanted to know more about the Rape of Nanking, and I liked this book because I think this book provides a lot of great details about the event.  I would give this book a rate of 4 because I really like the information it is giving throughout the book, but I think it gets a little bit boring as the book goes on.g said in the book that \\"the Rape of Nanking should be remembered not only for the number of people slaughtered but for the cruel manner in which many met their deaths.\\"  I believe the author really wanted the audience to understand the pain that many had suffered during the massacre rather than just simply knowing how many people had been killed during this event.

B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|This movie is great, everything about it is great, its like Zack Snyder saw Frank Millers graphic novel 300 and just decided to make it into the best movie a man can watch.     The bluray also includes lots of extras like a couple deleted scenes and many interviews and producion diarys.    THe great thing about this bluray is that it probably has the most replay value ever, I pop this movie into my ps3 atleast once every two weeka to see all the action sequences in glorious HD.    Just buy it
B00006RINF|1.0|I listened to various snippets of songs from 2 Lacuna Coil albums on Amazon (this one plus \\"Unleashed Memories\\"), and was initially blown away by Cristina Scabbia and the musicality of this band. However, after receiving the actual CD's, I was grossly disappointed...The male singer absolutely, unequivocally ruins every song he joins in on (which is 90% of the time). This in turn just makes the music seem clown-like, pathetic and campy at best. Very sad - I really wanted to like this band. They should eject the male singer and let Scabbia take the lead entirely to herself. Pathetic...Just wish I'd known this before I wasted my cash on not one, but two of their CD's.
B0010358CQ|4.0|My wife and I greatly enjoyed Ex Machina. Especially the visuals of the first scenes in the Cathedral. Spectacular imagery and a good story to boot.
B000UJCALI|5.0|Just got my first 32\\" widescreen about 3 weeks ago, I'm a kid in a candy shop, but after about 50 DVDs, movies, and concerts, THIS masterpiece seems to look the best !?!? Sure, it's always been a hypnotic movie, for 28 years now, but I've never seen it look so breathtaking. If someone else can give me more such title suggestions, I'm open !
B00168OINA|1.0|Somehow, they managed to bring in the Roswell Alien Spacecraft Crash, and create an entire film around alien visitors - though none of this is really explained. Indiana Jones movies have always been 'fantastic', but they have also always been 'well made', which is why it is especially frustrating to watch Steven Spielberg make perhaps the worst film of his life with this overblown disaster.<br /><br />At best, the film is a series of vignettes - most of which do not work at ALL. Harrison Ford, now way past his prime, grunts through the entire film with not an iota of his past energy or interest (at one point he looks thoroughly bored). Shia LaBeouf pretty much does a scene for scene re-enactment of his role in \\"Transformers\\" and \\"Disturbia\\" - for all his hype, his acting is very one-dimensional and every character he has ever played is just the same.<br /><br />The only saving grace is Cate Blanchett who plays an over the top 'woman in charge'. Towards the end, she becomes obsessed with knowing all about why the aliens even came to earth in the first place. This results in a 'climax' where the alien finally comes to life and looks her in the eye to transfer his 'knowledge' to her, and Cate dies a horrible fiery death. This would have been interesting had the writers bothered to let us know what the actual plot was all about, but instead it seems like a boring afterthought.<br /><br />Heres the thing - the script in this film is just terrible. And there is virtually no story. Unlike \\"The Last Crusade\\" that captured our collective imagination, this is one tedious romp through landscapes, waterfalls, caves, underground palaces, etc, with no charm at ALL. I am shocked at how Ford and Spielberg together could create something so boring, lifeless and insulting.<br /><br />One generous star. The worst film of the summer, and the worst Indiana Jones film. And this is also the worst film Steven Spielberg has ever been associated with. I'd rather watch \\"Glitter\\" (seriously).
B000XV6VOK|5.0|To tell the truth, I'd see so many trailers of the upcoming second season for several months that I put off watching and just DVR'd the series for awhile. I was totally sick of it. However, when I started watching I got caught up in the acting, the costumes, the storyline.  While probably not historically 100% correct, this second season brought up a lot of the \\"facts\\" surrounding the beheading of the gorgeous Ms. Dormer (Anne). I'd see Anne of a Thousand Days and, per usual, Richard Burton's personally totally dominated that movie. And it was only a 2-hour movie. I don't agree that this series is being rushed. I had never really thought about the fact that Henry was manipulating his country's religious leanings and all he went through to do that, to create an environment where he could divorce his first wife and marry Anne. Yes I knew the basics but the miniscule workings were fascinating. I could be crude and tell it for what it was - it wasn't just about an heir, MALE heir, though that figured heavily.  Lust was certainly involved here (putting it nicely...). I also find it fascinating to see how Henry is changing (in the series).  The show finale was mesmerizing - slow, lush and, well, engrossing. While the Anne in this series was no lady and treated people with harshness, you had to respect how she handled delay after delay of her beheading.<br /><br />I am most definitely not a history buff but love historical movies. I love to see how people lived in that time, the language they used, the food they ate, clothes they wore. The Tudors is rift with those details. It transports you to another time (only about 500 years ago - seems amazing that it was only that long ago). I eagerly await the next season(s) and wouldn't mind if it kept going into Queen Elizabeth's reigh - the Golden Years.
B00015TOCY|5.0|Eno added innovative weirdness to Bryan Ferry's pop sensibility in Roxy Music - same as Cale did for Reed, and Lennon did for McCartney. When Eno left the band after their first 2 albums (1972's \\"Roxy Music\\" and 1973's \\"For Your Pleasure\\"), he broke up one of rock music's most interesting partnerships.    The problem was - it wasn't enough of a partnership for Eno. It was Bryan Ferry's show, and he chafed under Ferry's dominance. Wishing to record his own music, Eno released his first solo album \\"Here Come The Warm Jets\\" (1974). He followed it up with \\"Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy)\\" (1974).    Both are art-rock masterpieces and a must to own. Of the two, I slightly prefer Tiger - but that's only because I like the way it segues and flows. Jets was more jarring in places. Both contain the most fun and engaging songs of his career, wherein Eno's wild keyboards are accompanied by his all-star friends. On Tiger, those friends include Roxy Music's guitarist Phil Manzanera (who also arranged the songs with Eno and was his assistant producer), Brian Turrington on bass guitar, Freddie Smith on drums, and the great Robert Wyatt on percussion and backing vocals. The lyrics are delightful: clever, surreal, and dreamy -  as is the music. Mostly the dream is pleasant - occasionally it's a bit more nightmarish. The playing is tight.    Eno would later issue his half-instrumental album \\"Another Green World\\" (1975), and \\"Before And After Science\\" (1977). I like them, but they aren't as much fun as the earlier two. Together these 4 comprise his vocal \\"pop\\" era, which was followed by years of instrumental \\"ambient\\" music. He'd go on to produce and play with many artists - most frequently with Bowie, Talking Heads, and U2. And he made some great music with them. It could even be argued that his input with these often imitated high-profile acts makes him the premier sound-shaper and most influential and important musician of the past 30 years.     But for me, nothing matches hisexciting work with Roxy Music - and his first 2 solo albums.
B0000640VO|2.0|Well, I suppose the people who love this film about an impish gamine pixie and the ones who don't will just have to agree to disagree.  While many feel that director Jean-Pierre Jeunet displays a light, joyful touch in this film, I felt that he was trying to cram his sense of whimsy down my throat and I couldn't help gagging on it.  When I feel that my life is lacking in cuteness, I have some pictures of kittens sitting in baskets that I can look at instead of spending a couple of hours with this film.    But then, I don't like \\"E.T.\\" either, so clearly I am out of step with what warms the cockles of most movie-goers' hearts.  So bear that in mind when you are deciding whether to pay attention to this review.
B000002TQV|5.0|I am guessing millions of more people will buy this album in the coming decades.The sound of this album explains just the basis of Radiohead's sound structure.What is amazing about Radiohead and often overlooked is how unyielding the sound truly is if you try to mimic it. I cannot think of one cover of any song on this album I'd give a second listen. It is just too difficult to gain inspiration from and procreate. Getting on now. Fake Plastic Trees. It is my favourite song by this band. I don't know how he does it. It is very difficult to sing when the song isn't playing and there is such \\"major key tonality\\" and a driven rock structure approach that the band and the vocalist assume that it truly owns the record. The Bends, title track, keeps your faith vested but isn't an instant classic. \\"High and Dry\\" is sometimes the \\"best thing to happen to you\\" My Iron Lung, you will love. \\"I wish I was\\" is the \\"how to disappear completely\\" of this record, excellent shower alone music. \\"Bones\\" makes me miss the 90's with a precussion.<br /><br />Disclaimer - I don't understand what they are singing about 100% of the time and I don't want to because the guitar obstructs any possity to reign on the bends.
B00000273M|5.0|Their jangling guitars and vocal harmonies remind me of the Byrds, and the Bangles never fail to get me going.  Hard rocking mixed with humor and style, their songs are an eclectic mix that emphasizes their outstanding talent.  Walk Like an Egyptian is one of the weirdest and catchiest songs ever recorded, and the video truly captured the quirkiness of it.  My favorite on this album, however, is the fantastic cover of Simon and Garfunkel's Hazy Shade of Winter.  I wish they had recorded a 20-minute version of it, because when I listen to it, I don't want it to end.
0446619078|5.0|When the constant snarking from Harvey \\"98\\" Pounds becomes too much, Harry snaps and puts Pounds' head through the glass wall between his \\"office\\" and the area where the detectives work.  Irvin Irving goes to bat for Harry and has him put on Involuntary Stress Leave rather than firing him, and requires counseling.  At first Harry is ... uncooperative with this.  Then he decides that, as long as he's not doing anything else, maybe he'll finally take a look at the murder of a prostitute that has been unsolved for 30 years ... the murder of his mother.  What he discovers is NOT what he expected.<br /><br />We learn more about Harry in this tense thriller - about his past and his relationship with his mother as well as some surprising relationships that his mother had with other people.  Fans of Bosch will not want to miss this one.
B00011F5DK|5.0|The first time I played Blokus I was at a pot-luck gathering at Church.  This game has very simple rules and only takes a minute to learn how to play.  I had so much fun playing this game that I knew I had to get one for my family.  I now play with my three kids (ages 6 and 5 - twins) regularly and we all love it.
0553382179|4.0|A hoot - but seriously...<br />This book have a few veiled religious references, but they're not obtrusive and don't smack you in the face.  It's well thought out, humorous, and I can see it working for people just like me - slobs!  I've lived for years in the certain knowledge that I'll live in CHAOs (Can't Have Anyone Over syndrome) for my entire life.  This book is going to change that.  She's down to earth, simple to follow and has carved out a plan she frankly says rescued her from lived in clutter and depression.  She works with a known behavioral truth - habits take about 27 days to create - or break.  So, she puts that forward as the core of her approach to shaping up your home.  She starts you out with one simple chore.  Shine your sink.  I loved that.  Like she says, I can do that!  For the terminally disordered this book might be the way back to a clean house and an ordered life.  I like the book, only received it about a week ago and plan to use it for at least 27 days.  I have faith...
B0015D3Z4O|2.0|I am very dissapointed with this CD.  Don't get me wrong, it's listenable, just not my cup of tea.  It reminds me of her older (80's) stuff...which I do not care for.  My biggest problem with this CD is that her voice is center stage with minimal effects (or instrumentation for that matter).  I hope she returns to the over the top electro-sounds that she and her crew do so well.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|These movies (well, the first 3, I have yet to watch the fourth) are about how I remember them.  That is to say they are very good.  But by todays standards, they can be a bit slow.  Definitely worth it for me just for the nostalgia, though.
B00005JPNZ|1.0|After nearly 20 years, you would think the fourth George Lucas/Steven Spielberg Indiana Jones movie would be great. The first Indiana Jones movie was great, the second was a dud, the third was very good. This one was worse than the second. A big disappointment after 20 years.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|Anybody that likes Beatle music or that grew up in the sixties listening to them will love this movie.  It is very well made and the songs are tastefully enacted.   I saw it in the theaters when it came out and I liked it so much that I bought the DVD.
1423101464|5.0|LOVED IT!!  I was taking a stab in the dark when I started reading the first Percy Jackson book.  I've not had a moment of disappointment since!  I've very much enjoyed every book, including this last one.  I'd recommend the entire series to anyone who enjoys an exciting and fun story.
B0015D3Z4O|1.0|Whatever suspicions are aroused from the god-awful cover art (looks like she's up to the old 'trying too hard' tricks circa \\"Erotica\\" and \\"Bedtime Stories\\") are resoundingly confirmed with a solitary spin of this, Madonna's creative nadir.  She's made perplexing but ultimately likable albums in the past (the unnecessary animosity and muddled politics of \\"American Life\\" and the backtracking safety zone of \\"Confessions\\"), but nothing so completely unloveable and lifeless as \\"Hard Candy.\\"  To observe someone so used to breaking ground and introducing hot, edgy producers to the masses latching on so pathetically to obvious safe choices du jour is almost as squirm-inducing as the granny goes dominatrix cover.  If this is some kind of kiss-off to newly ditched label, Warner, the sad joke is squarely upon Madge.  Whereas a Madonna album used to be both reason for a party and a sure-fire way to keep one going, \\"Candy\\" only ends up making it clear that it's time for Madonna to be escorted out.  Awful and sad.  'nuff said.
0553804367|5.0|I haven't read \\"A Brief History of Time\\", but this book is written in a style that is easily understandable, even though the concepts discussed may be far beyond anything you might think about in your day-to-day life.  Definitely a five star read!
B000088E6D|5.0|Michael Buble is an unbelievable artist. he has brought back BIG BAND!  I purchased two of his CD's before attending a concert at the Honda Center in Anaheim, CA and my boyfriend and I found ourselves immersed in a nostalgic time past.  Growing up listening to Big Band, Sinatra, etc.. with my grandparents was a treasured experience and i am extremely pleased that there is a young artist to bring this beautiful style of music to my 7 year old. He likes the CD too:)  The concert itself was nothing short of amazing and i highly recommed one in the future for anyone 6-106:)  Great buy!!
B00026WU64|5.0|This brought me back to the time I was a Dj at WKDK in Newberry, South Carolina. The 33 record came in, I played it and was told to put it on the back shelf. To controversial for the time and place. I ended up with the record and played it until 33's faded out. Over the years I remembered that record and often wished I could play it again and then I found the CD on Amazon. The CD is exactly as I remember the record but a better quality.  Anyone interested in the early Dylan and that time period should really get this CD, only to hear how Blowing in the Wind originally sounded before Joan Baez and Peter, Paul and Mary made it popular.
0930289234|4.0|Being a comic book fan I figured this was a must read. I hate the hype this novel receives because I believe it creates unattainable expectations. While I think the hype hurt this novel for me, I have to agree this was an amazingly well crafted graphic novel. From the stories within the story to the inclusion of \\"newspaper articles\\" and biographies, this book sets the bar for what a great graphic novel can be. Within the short span of 12 chapters, Alan Moore has created a universe that will suck you in. The only reason I give this a 4 rather than a 5 is because it didn't quite live up to the grandiose expectations I had. While it was impressive, I don't think I would call it perfect. I do, however, agree it deserves to be on anyone's \\"Must Read List.\\"
B00000IQW3|3.0|this movie was sweet!  graphics were awesome!  I remember watching it as a kid but watching it again after all this time made it even better.  I thought the graphics were cool considering the advancement in technology since then.  The scene where he actually beats the record and the whole trailor park city is there cheering for him was great!!!
1400034205|4.0|Guys....the only bad experience i have had so far with buying stuff through amazon.    The book I received was through Amazon and was described as \\"new\\" but it was actually soiled on the outside. Otherwise the book was fine.    About the book its a splendid book with the exotic prose of the classics of yore like that of \\"Great Expectations\\".    I am still half way through the book and am reading in the speed read mode.  Happy reading guys.this is a book worth the money.    CJ in LA
B00005JKN9|4.0|This was one of my all time favorite movies.  Definately in the top 10.  However, I thought it was a bit long.  The length of the movie took away some of the suspense.  I thought the movie was similar to a modern day gangster movie.  \\"friends close and enemies closer\\"  Thought it was good.
B0015XHQTE|5.0|WB have proven they know how to release classic titles with their exceptional multi-disc offerings from Astaire/Rogers and the Wizard of Oz and Gone with the Wind and FORD/WAYNE etc etc...and now they have brought that same excellent packaging and extras to a much more current series DIRTY HARRY.    All the movies look much better than ever before ...maybe even better than they did in movie theatres. Previous extras are included ...so no need to keep old editions and each movie has interesting and fast moving featurettes of approximately a half hour that do add considerably to the enjoyment  factor.  I've only listened to a couple of the commentaries...they all have new ones. Professional Eastwood brown nose...er biographer Richard \\"windbag\\" Schickel doesn't add much to Dirty Harry...but John Milius as insane as ever is a hoot on Magnum Force.  I'm hoping the commentary on The Enforcer is good as its by the director...we have the aforementioned Schickel back kissing butt on Sudden Impact so I'm not  expecting enlightenment there.    Should you buy this box instead of the individual movies?  ...its a little better price to buy them this way but the individual movies have such cool graphics and packaging.  There is a fake badge in this set AND an exceptional documentary on  Clint Eastwood \\"Out of the Shadows\\" that all true Clint fans owned already but IS included here...as well as mini theatre one sheets and a very nice letter from Clint about the series...  tough call...oh and a nice book with photos and brief notes...so the whole package takes up about the same space as the individual DVDs for those wondering about shelf space.    THe movies themselves are close to the heart of baby boomers like myself who may have liked John Wayne  when  we were kids but as we became high schoolers and grew up Clint  was/is  OUR guy.  There is a slight decline in quality from movie to movie during the series as Clint ages and the writing has to find  more  cute lines for him to toss off ...but I  enjoyed them all and still  do ...with the possible exception of the Dead Pool...which is now  more  of a curiosity to me.    Bottom  line...if you like  Clint/Harry ...you will  be delighted with the quality of prints, extras and packaging.  In fact its so good I'm getting tempted to upgrade to blu-ray and get the set in that format!
B0016HMYEQ|3.0|This movie was definately not that bad.  That is basically the best way to put it.  I had an advantage however because I rented this movie only after being warned about 20 times about how I wouldn't like it.  So, expecting the worst, I was mildly surprised.  I didn't mind the Blair Witch effect with the camera that some people hated.  I thought it was cool that you didn't see what was terrorizing the city.  However, the last 15 minutes made me sick.  What a good way to ruin a decent movie.
B0002JJBZE|5.0|Season 2 saw the full maturation of the Star Trek franchise.  Gone are the awkward feeling-out episodes and the plain bad/boring episodes of the first season (e.g. \\"Charlie X\\", although \\"The Changeling\\" is pretty bad).  Also gone is the awkward broadcast schedule, where uniforms and cast members appeared to change because the shows were broadcast in an apparently random order relative to their filming dates.  In full flower is the Star Trek Triumvirate of Kirk, Spock, and McCoy - Spock representing cold logic (the ego?), McCoy emotional humanity (id?), and Kirk balancing the two with action (superego?).  The addition of Chekov as the last \\"main character\\" of the Original Series crew is also welcome.    With the rise of stories revolving around the Triumvirate, there is an inevitable diminution of secondary character interactions.  That's not to say that Scotty, Uhura, et al. are not given ample screen time in some episodes (e.g. Scotty's murder trial in \\"Wolf in the Fold\\"), but we don't have many interactions between them - e.g. Sulu and Rand discussing fencing, or Uhura singing in the officer's mess.  That's a minor quibble, of course, as the season is rich in fantastic and varies episodes.  There are some outright comedies (\\"I, Mudd\\" doesn't work, but \\"Trouble with Tribbles\\" and \\"A Piece of the Action\\" both routinely appear at the tops of lists of favourite episode votes).    Other reviews have listed the episodes for the season, but I will give a partial list of highlights, divided by classic Trek themes:    1. Comedy episodes:  - The Trouble with Tribbles: insatiable purring furballs infest the Enterprise while docked at a space station is disputed space.  The Klingons pay a visit and further chaos ensues.  - A Piece of the Action: cultural contamination by a survey ship 100 years easrlier creates a culture based on 1930's Chicago mobs.  Kirk and Spock attempt to redirect the course of the planetary evolution.  Contains the a memorable line uttered by Mr. Spockin a mob accent: \\"I'd advise yez to keep dialing\\" (the phone).  In a recent straw poll in the local newspaper, this episode was voted \\"best Trek episode\\" of all time.    2. Prime Directive episodes  - The aforementioned A Piece of the Action  - Patterns of Force - an historian recreates Nazi Germany on a planet at war with a neighbour    3. Alien Culture  - Amok Time and Journey to Babel - the former dealing with Vulcan mating rituals, the latter with the Father-Son relationship between Sarek and Spock.  - Friday's Child - the Klingons and Federation fight over mining rights on a pre-technological world    4. Transporter/holodeck/technology malfunction  - Mirror, Mirror - a transporter accident sends Kirk, Uhura, McCoy, and Scotty into an alternate universe where their counterparts are genocidal empire-builders.    5. Threat to all life in the galaxy/universe  - Doomsday Machine - The USS Constellation's crew are killed by a giant superweapon, and Kirk and the Constellation's captain must figure out how to destroy it.  - Obsession - a gaseous entity that eats red blood cells (thus killing its victim) is encountered.  We learn that Kirk's first landing party command was destroyed by this same creature.    The final great episode of Season 2 doesn't easily fit into a standard Trek category, and that is \\"Wolf in the Fold\\", where Scotty is charged with the multiple murders of women on a shore-leave planet.  It was written by Theodore Sturgeon, who also penned \\"Psycho\\".    There are extras on this disc, and they are quite good.  I would have liked to have seen more text commentaries by the Okudas, and would really like to have heard some audio commentaries by the actors (both Nimoy and Shatner gave good commentaries on the ST films they directed).  There are interviews with Nimoy discussing his photography career, Nichelle Nicholls on the origins of Uhura's name, and writer D.C. Fontana on the writing process, for just a few examples.  Now that the price of these serieshave come down to more affordable levels (they were originally $100 each!), they are worth the money to see the stories uninterrupted by ads and uncut for syndication.
0143038419|4.0|i thought it was both comical and insightful. allows you to take a step back and not take everything too seriously. easy read, i'd recommend it especially to women.
B0014Z4ON4|4.0|INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM sometimes gets a rough ride, but this is undeserved. TEMPLE OF DOOM is a rollicking thrill ride with terrific set pieces and an exotic sense of adventure, and is pure serial adventure. Wonderful fun.
B00005UKKF|5.0|Birthday present for my nephew who has been watching it ever since he got it!  I think it was a definite hit!
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|[[ASIN:B000Q6GUW0 Dexter - The First Season]]    WONDERFUL first season.  Dark, humorous, thriller, mystery. Very entertaining!
0452289963|3.0|I was excited to hear about this book, and my wife picked up a copy. I was really disappointed to find that it was full of lush generalizations and a great deal of 'pop' new age thought.  It continues to astound me that so few people pay attention to Rudolf Steiner (who wrote 100,000 pages of clear, original, and decisive thought on the most wide ranging spiritual concepts) and yet fall head over heels for someone like Tolle. All the best to those who pursue this path, but I think the path of platonic dialectical ascent outlined in Hicks' \\"The Shattering Light of Stars\\" is much to be preferred to this.
B000UGG39Q|3.0|Down is one of my all time favorites and I have listened to the first two albums countless times. Unfortunately, I feel like Over the Under is just a weak album. The mixing on this album is horrible and the studio staff should be ashamed. I also found most of the songs to be boring and uninspired. With there first two albums, every song was its own entity, but with this one it just doesn't do anything for me. It is still worth a listen, but it is not worth the praise that most have given it here on Amazon.
0393324818|5.0|Michael Lewis made his name writing books describing the people behind our financial system -- books that were inevitably described, for some reason, as \\"funny\\" or \\"hilarious.\\"  Perhaps these same reviewers were in stitches while reading Javascript technical manuals or the Kyoto Accords.  Truly, I saw neither any humor nor any attempts to be funny in these books, which were, sadly, just dull.    How refreshing, then, to have him find a topic better suited to his tone.  Yes, money plays a role, but what's described here is the pursuit of excellence, and the courage to flout conventional wisdom in the pursuit of a competitive edge.    A fascinating subject about dedicated professionals.  True, these people may come off as a little singleminded, but they have to be (as this book demonstrates) in order to compete against people equally dedicated to finding an edge.
B0018QCXFK|4.0|[[ASIN:B0018QCXFK Bee Movie [Blu-ray]]] I borrowed this movie and I wasn't expecting much because of what I heard about it. I watched it with my 17 year old daughter and we laughed and thought it was very good. The next day I bought it on blu-ray. The picture quality is fantasic the colors pop off the screen and the audio sounds amazing with Dolby TrueHD 5.1 surround sound. When the tennis ball hits the ground with Barry the bee on it...it's like your hitting the ground with full force. Some parts of the movie are a little unrealistic but what animated movie isn't. It's definitely worth a look.
0060763280|5.0|As a professional in the financial services sector, I purchased this book for one reason and one reason only. But, the lessons in this book go far beyond anything one might imagine if the title alone were a  guide in your decision to read and/or purchase this book. Do yourself a favor. Buy and read this book, and then buy a few more for you closest friends. It is that good!
1584726644|5.0|I've been listening to several of the classics on audio book this past year and finally grabbed a copy of Pride and Prejudice.  I have never read this novel before, but have seen a couple of movie versions of it and really liked the story.  This version had decent reviews, so I gave it a try.  I was not disappointed.<br /><br />The reader was Kate Reading who did an excellent job capturing the characters and what I imagined the accents for that time and place would be.  I found myself drawn into this novel and was always anxious to listen once again.  I normally just listen while I'm driving but found myself listening at home for a few hours.<br /><br />Jane Austen's writing style and characters are very captivating.  I found myself recognizing some of the characteristics of the characters in people I know and liked how she showed strengths and weaknesses in the major players.  I especially liked the father's subtle sense of humor.  I will definitely read more of her books.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this audio book for anyone wishing to enjoy literature at its best.  Men as well as women should like this type of romance.
B00140PK6O|5.0|For those who have not tried watching British miniseries, books turned to movies or BBC television; this is the place to start. Cranford is not to long (not long enough, also) being just 5 hour-long episodes. It is a comedy/drama that will delight any new fan. It is an ice cream sundae for those already loving the British Victorian stories. Beautiful costumes and sets. Plus an insane Victorian milk cow (I'll not \\"spoil\\" this portion with an explanation).<br /><br />Cranford has it all. The cast is headed by Judi Dench, being a guarantee of enjoyment for any movie.  She is the star in every episode with her superb acting of the character Miss Matty.  Like the other ladies of this small British Village, she specializes in knowing the right thing to do and say in every social engagement. It is a laugh-out-loud experience to watch the town's old spinsters interact--especially when the new young doctor arrives in town.  It seems young and old alike decide he is their chance for love and living.  What a hilarious set of events caused by a prank by the young doctor's friend. If it's not marrying hopefuls wagging their tongues then it's the anti-railroad ladies trying to preserve the perfectness of the small community. You will side with those against the new railroad intrusion.<br /><br />The ladies will have you laughing one moment and then genuinely moved by their situation the next. What an amazing story, the book written by Elizabeth Gaskill.  The British accents are delightful but for those unaccustomed to the dialects, the DVD offers subtitles in English, often a help, yet not distracting when not needed as they are place outside the widescreen box.<br /><br />The young boy Harry Gregson is played by Alex Etel and is a young, poor chap you will fall in love with. You will want to contribute yourself to his livelihood, this thirst for education, and his dedication to assist his family in survival. The list of fine acting is endless, as the entire cast seems destined for an award for their work.<br /><br />Yes, Cranford is the DVD to buy to get a taste of British drama/comedy. Be prepared: it is addictive and this particular DVD set is right up at the top. The story is so small-village comfortable and ends so feel-good delightfully that we should all be so lucky as to live in Cranford. Next best idea: replay the story beginning with disc one.work.

B000PFU7OO|5.0|This is a good record, nicely arranged. Some of the songs will be understood and appreciated better if you previously watched the film [[ASIN:B000X1Z0BU Once]].
1592332803|5.0|how delicious! i've been baking out of this book for a few months now, so i can honestly say its recipes are excellent. I've been wowing vegans and non-vegans alike since my first attempt (the fudge) straight through my most recent (the cinnamon coffee cake). In fact, I've had to buy two extra copies because I was getting tired of being asked for the recipes and will give the book instead.
B000K15VSA|5.0|Ok, so I am a Sci-fi geek more than anything.  I absolutely love this movie in each and every one of its forms.  The bonus features are awesome as are the \\"toys\\" that come in this set.  Any fan of sci-fi should pick this up.
B000002H97|4.0|This is the album which defined the Metallica I came to love. This is the one that differentiated them and made them special. \\"Enter Sandman\\" is the quintessential Metallica piece.
B000063DI9|5.0|I have never been a HUGE MAiden fan, I mean, I like them but they aren't a band I overly got into.  This is the first Maiden album in my collection.  I do like their sound, just never got around to buying their albums.  But this is a classic album.  The album is a great album song for song.  There isn't a bad track on it.  If you want to take a trip down nostalgia lane, and hear what metal music is supposed to sound like, pick this up.
B0013J30XG|5.0|This movie...what else can I say about it? Imagine all the characters from the cartoon. Got that picture? Ok. Then imagine them as having fully fleshed-out, multi-dimensional lives, personalities, and feelings. Then imagine those personalities and feelings of real people interacting with each other, loving each other, working through grief, fighting injustice. Pretty awesome. The depth of these characters was, quite frankly, breathtaking. Especially given what they had to work with from the original.<br /><br />The movie has just enough of the freaky camp from the tv toon without blowing the believability of the story and characters.<br /><br />Honestly, I cannot say enough positive things about it.  I saw it 3 times.
B0000062Y2|5.0|This is a good translation onto CD from the movie.  If you are expecting the solid, powerful vocals present on the rock opera album, you won't get it here.  They are not weak by any means, just 'different'.  But it does make for good comparison between the two albums.  There are aspects of the Judas I like on this album and some I like on the other.  Same with Jesus.  It is good to see how two different singers approach the characters.
B00000IQW5|5.0|This is one of those sleeper movies that no one has heard of.  I rented it when it first came out and usually every year there after.  I don't mean to but I always cry, from the gut cry.  My Daughter forbid me to buy this movie, but now that she is 26 I feel as an adult I can handle it.  I popped it in the DVD recorder the music started & I was gone for 2 hours.  I love Richard Dreyfuss, Holly Hunter & John Goodman..they are awesome in this movie.  If you want humor, romance, love & a good cry rent this movie.....
B0015UKX7Y|3.0|I applaud these very young musicians for looking backward to the music of the late 60's/early 70's. There's a wry irony in most of the lyrics that adds a modern edge.  Indeed the singing and lyrics are the best parts of the CD. I wonder if these songs would have benefited from a little more time in the oven. In particular, the flat mixing has a muddied sound to it that limits every single track. Was this done to sound like the 70's?  Perhaps, but it doesnt quite work.  I'd really like to see them perform these tracks live and without the symphonic instruments.  I suspect it would improve things across the board.
B000GIXEIG|5.0|This movie is great because it is a great laugh.  I have bought it for so many friends for birthdays and holidays that this itself becomes funny.    The insertion of Sarah Polley as a witch who did not appear in the actual original Beowulf tale/epic poem is itself genius.  She, unlike the rest of the actors, has a flat American accent (in ancient Scandinavia) and recites her lines with the same rhythm every sentence: dull and emotionless.  A great scene (SPOILER WARNING!) occurs when Beowulf (smitten, obviously) comes to visit her in her dank cave set apart from the village.  He's curious about Grendel, the troll, of course, and has come to seek her magickal advice.  She responds in defense of Grendel, again in her flat acting-less style, and then *FLASHBACK!* to her asleep in her cave, and suddenly, who should come bumbling in?  Good ol' Grendel, whose huge bulk he maneuvers through the tiny entrance.  He makes his way over to her, lying on her stomach, pulls away her blanket and skirt, and proceeds to impregnate her.  The *FLASHBACK!* ends, Beowulf, entranced, reaches forward to kiss her.  She pulls back, and says, drolly, \\"Don't forget: I know how you die.\\"  And then, they too, have sex.  It's a wonderful script.  Brilliant timing.  Brilliantly bad acting.    The second best thing about this movie is Grendel himself.  He does not speak, of course, but mumbles unintelligibly to himself (the best noises being his sex noises, which are SOOO awkward and uncomfortable).  It's entertaining to watch him bowling with human skulls just because of his self-directing gurgling speech, his cartwheels, and his squeals of joy.  It's also fun to watch him mock the lone Christian in the land (a foreign priest), who, on a bet, spends the night outside with his rosary, praying in Latin, to prove his God will protect him from the monster.  Grendel creeps up behind and mimics his Latin mutterings, which is classic.  Also, Grendel is very stupid: once, while in the King's hall, his arm becomes entangled in a piece of rope hanging from the ceiling.  While he could cut the rope, Grendel chooses not to, and instead chops off his own arm.    I particularly love the cursing in this movie--it's just great because, here I am, watching an Old English epic poem playing on the screen, and so I'm expecting Old English dialogue, so forth, and am rewarded with the constant line of \\"f***ing troll!\\"  This alone sets me in hysterics.    This should be a cult classic.  It really should.  I recommend it to everyone.  Also, it's so self-serious that you can tell it's not even intentionally a spoof (shame).  But don't expect to ACTUALLY think it's a good movie.  It's only great because it's SO bad.

B0012QE4Q2|3.0|I love Tudor history. I even love some of the actors featured in this film. However, the history buff in me wanted to scream as I watched history manipulated for the sake of drama. This story is already dramatic enough, no changes needed to be made. Anne did not get involved with Henry until after his affair with Mary was over. She did not \\"steal\\" him from her sister, and certainly not while Mary was pregnant. Anne married Henry Percy?? Really?? Funny, I've never read that in a single biography. Yes, betrothals were viewed as sacred as a marriage, but it is my understanding that they were denied the right to become formally betrothed. I'm not even sure why the \\"secret\\" marriage ceremony was included in the story.     Mary did not go to the palace and grab Elizabeth and raise her. The incest incident was even dismissed during Anne's lifetime as an attempt to legitimized her murder. So many things wrong with this movie historically... I'm sad to think that there are those who will walk away from this movie thinking they've gotten the real story. Natalie's shining moments were at Anne's trial and execution. Her performance was moving and realistic. I give this movie three stars for those moments alone. Bana was not really able to QUITE pull off Henry's ruthlessness. He tried.
B000XTLUW0|4.0|An absolutely wild in love Muse fan, I was able to enjoy this DVD to an extent beyond what it deserves, which is why I rated it at 4 stars. I saw the band on this tour twice in the states with a similar play list. The energy of the live shows adhered me to this band for life, and therefore I was excited to purchase the DVD to sort of relive the intensity and excitement and power that I felt seeing them on stage.<br /><br />I was pretty bummed from the start, when during Knights of Cydonia there were only occasional flashes of the full view of the stage. The fervency felt when you are in the crowd seeing them live and watching the words to the chorus flash consecutively across the huge screen behind the band \\"No. One's. Going. To. Take. Me. Alive.\\" Lost, completely. And why? It was a genius decision of showmanship to bond the audience to the powerful lyrics and to feel a part of the song through this visual, not to mention a really cool stage show effect, that essentially was never seen on this footage.<br /><br />Many other cool lighting effects from the show were lost in a similar manner, such as during Supermassive Black Hole when the light behind the band is so bright it looks like they actually are playing in front of an exploding star. It seems that the director became so wrapped up in the many possible aspects of a concert experience, that what was lost was the idea that simply showing the stage from the true perspective of an audience member, as it is mean to be seen, is quite effective!<br /><br />Other examples of poor editing:<br />Panning or flashing off to ANYTHING else besides the lead instrument during a solo? WEAK. I was so mad so many times on this.<br /><br />It is odd not to show much except blurred obstructions of the horns and other instrumentals on songs highlighting such musicians.<br /><br />Showing shots of anything besides Bellamy when he does that last, \\"Hold you in my arms\\" falsetto at the end of Starlight is unacceptable. Whoever made that editorial decision, I want to meet you out in the parking lot after school. I seriously took it personally.<br /><br />Some of the effects worked, as I did like the unique color treatment, particularly in the intro, and I actually enjoyed seeing many of the different perspectives, especially that swooping camera angle that looks like you are flying down onto a crowd of open hands waving in the air. They would have been even more effective and fun, however, if used very sparingly, and I would have loved to see any camera shot last more than 3 seconds. I admit to a short attention span, but this editor really needs to be put on Riddlin.<br /><br />Essentially, Muse as a live band does not NEED all of those effects and dodgy fancying up. The energy of the show, the talent of these musicians - who on stage sound much much larger than their 3 man band - struck deeply a chord within me in a way that no other band has in many years. I am left a little dismayed that those fans who have not been fortunate enough to actually see them live will not even gather a fraction of that feeling from this disjointed DVD.<br /><br />Yet, do I still have it on constant rotation? Yes. Yes I do. Because without having a new album to fulfill my Muse cravings the CD, with live versions of many of my old favorites, sustains my taste for the time. *nibbles*out in the parking lot after school.

B000000OU0|5.0|Anyone  an Eagle  fan will really enjoy this  cd,It will have  you singing along with every song,The remake of  Hotel California is outstanding and  you will be  playing it  over and  over. For  a  live  concert cd, well done not  hearing  the crowd breaking up the  music.
B0001KZM3O|2.0|One of the great things about the Floyd is that as a rule, the music came first and lyrics second. The Floyd made excellent music full of mood, atmosphere and ear numbing guitar solos. Lyrics and political agenda were sometimes prevelient in Floyd albums, but never took a front seat to the music. These are the reasons that this album is such a disappointment. You could tell starting with the album \\"animals\\" that lyrics were becoming more important to Roger Waters (Bassist and main lyrcist) than the music. Even with \\"the wall\\" the lyrics were playing a major role, buy there was still some great music: Comfortably numb, Hey you, Mother, etc. This album is where the lyrics and the political agenda of Rogers Waters took over and the music became minimalized. No mood music. No great guitar solos. Just Roger Waters ranting about post war Englad and Margret Thatcher. There are a few songs I do enjoy: the Heroes return and the gunner's dream. Not Now John added some much needed rock and roll to this depressing album and some singing by David Gilmour (lead guitarist). It should be noted that by this time, the rest of the band had been relagated to session mucicians. And this album is considered by many to be a Waters solo album in all but name. Judging by his other solo album, I would have to agree. I couldn't help but feel like was being hit over the head with political ravings and no Pink Floyd music to cushion the blows.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|John Adams is a must see series for every patriotic American or indeed any person who is inspired by the prevailing fight for justice, peace, honesty and truth. The writing and directing combination is extraordinary enabling the viewer to saviour each moment of each episode as if it were the finest of wine. The journey the viewer is brought on during the 7 episodes is one of heartache and joy, betrayal and friendship, love and adventure and what the very essence of life entails. To write anymore would be a sin toward anyone who hasn't yet had the viewing pleasure, I promise you this, you will remember this series in as fond a way as you now remember `Band of Brothers'.
0385333846|4.0|Despite its international acclaim and enormous cult fan base, Slaughterhouse-Five is a novel that by conventional standards should not have been. \\"This book was written by a pillar of salt,\\" author Kurt Vonnegut remarks in the prologue as he attempts to relive the Dresden firebombing; and from that moment on the reader goes on a time warped journey through the past, future, and fourth dimension always returning to the horrific massacre during World War II that he can never explain because there can be nothing to say.   After serving in the war as one of the worst soldiers ever, he marries a rich fiancé he doesn't love and works a job he doesn't deserve. Although he has enough wealth to give him security, he has no control over his life because he has become \\"unstuck in time,\\" fast forwarding and rewinding to different moments in his life, never knowing which one he will visit next.   At some point he is kidnapped by plunger-shaped aliens from the planet Tralfamadore and adopts their fatalistic views that time is not linear but a moments that you can visit any time. In this way, the structure of the novel reflects this Tralfamadorian ideal, jumping out of order instead of going chronologically. Billy claims to draw comfort from this but the reader is ultimately struck by the impotence of this character.         Although Vonnegut died last year at age 84 (so it goes), his masterpiece is still considered one of the most remarkable anti-war books to be published; bizarre and humorous yet subtly heartrending, this novel boldly strips down the glorified war epic, ultimately concluding that there are no words for such a senseless experience with the destruction of war.   Poo-tee-weet?
B000UX6THK|5.0|A cultural phenomenon during its 1990-92 run, \\"Twin Peaks\\" holds up wonderfully well almost 20 years later.  The gold box edition offers both the original pilot and the international version, as well as all the episodes from \\"Twin Peaks\\" all-too-brief two season run.  After reading of some viewers' problems with discs, I was concerned that I might run into some of the same.  Happily, that was not the case.  The set that I ordered from Amazon was perfect.  The episodes themselves have beautiful clarity, perhaps more so than when they originally aired, and I found the extras to be both informative and entertaining.    For those not familiar with \\"Twin Peaks\\", it was a strange and exhilerating television experience, the likes of which I had never seen when it first aired.  Conceived by David Lynch and Mark Frost, it is a dark and deeply disturbing journey into the psyche of a seemingly normal, all-American town.  The sudden bursts of violence were shocking for a network television show in the early '90's, and those images still pack a punch today; there is an unsettling eeriness that prevails through most of the episodes, leavened by quirky, sometimes oddball humor supplied by the eccentric inhabitants of Twin Peaks.    The brilliant David Lynch has stated that Twin Peaks belongs to the same universe as  his underrated \\"Lost Highway\\", and there is a certain similarity of themes that are constant, I think, through not only \\"Highway\\", but \\"Mulholland Drive\\", and the earlier \\"Blue Velvet\\".  They all seem to be part of a macabre world that looks familiar, but is, somehow, not our own.     The cast of \\"Twin Peaks\\" is enormous and everyone seems to inhabit their characters to an impressive degree.  I can't think of a villain in television history who is more terrifying than the diabolical Bob; the very sight of him slithering and cackling makes one want to scream.  As played by Frank Silva, he is the essence of unending horror and the stuff that nightmares are made of.  Eventhe madman Windom Earle (Kenneth Welsh)can't hold a candle to Bob's demonic presence.      On the flip side of the coin, the series' lawmen--FBI agent Cooper and Sheriff Harry S. Truman--are wonderful, stalwart, brave men, vividly brought to life by, respectively, Kyle MacLachlan and Michael Ontkean.  \\"Twin Peaks\\" was, perhaps, the finest hour for both actors.  MacLachlan has gone on to lesser (I think), husbandly roles in \\"Desperate Housewives\\" and \\"Sex and the City\\", but I'll always remember him chiefly for this turn as Dale Cooper.  Of the many other cast members, the great Piper Laurie is deliciously malicious as scheming Catherine Martell, with Jack \\"Eraserhead\\" Nance on hand as her clueless, cuckholded husband, Pete; Joan Chen is convincingly demur and devious as the traitorous Josie; and Richard Beymer is both touching and amusing as nutty, rich hotelier/bordello owner, Benjamin Horne.  Ray Wise and Grace Zabriskie offer a touching and, ultimately, chilling portrait of a grief-stricken married couple.  The younger cast members are also compelling, especially Madchen Amick, Sherilyn Fenn, Lara Flynn Boyle, and Sheryl Lee, who plays both the ill-fated Laura Palmer (whose murder sets the series in motion) and her lookalike cousin, Maddy Ferguson. In fact, it would be difficult to single out any performer in the series who isn't dead-on with their characterizations.    While the pilot and Season 1 are pretty much flawless, Season 2 almost sinks a few times, due to some seemingly superfluous plot developments that do nothing to advance the plot. In fact, getting through episodes 17-22 may require some patience and a certain level of tolerance for out-and-out inanity.  It's worth hanging in there for the remaining episodes because they come close to recapturing the essence of the earlier shows, and, in some cases, surpass the exhuberance and sheer weirdness that was displayed in the first season.  Anyone expecting everything to be neatly wrapped up in the finale will be sorely unamused, although, for me, \\"Twin Peaks\\" is more a case of the journey being more important than the destination.  I think \\"Twin Peaks\\" is as close to a television series masterpiece as has ever been produced for American television.
0141439661|5.0|Taking place in Norland, England, in 1811, Jane Austen astounds her wide audience with yet another uplifting and eye-opening novel.  Sense and Sensibility explores the life of the Dashwood family, consisting of the new widow Mrs. Dashwood and her two daughters, the composed and affectionate Elinor along with the sensible and spontaneous Marianne.  Inheriting all of his father's money, John Dashwood visits his sister Mrs. Dashwood and gives the three devastated ladies a good share of his inherited money.  During the visit, John Dashwood's wife, fanny, brings along her sensible older brother, Edward Ferrars, who develops a very close relationship with Elinor Dashwood. Although they are given a hard time by Fanny, Mrs. Dashwood, and the later promiscuous old friend Lucy Steele, Elinor and Edward establish and progress their love throughout the entire novel.  As their love grows, Austen compares and contrasts the trait of sensibility, possessed by Marianne, and the trait of sense, possessed by Elinor.  She does this through the two sisters' interactions with their significant others.<br /> Just like almost all of Jane Austen's preceding novels, Sense and Sensibility dives into the themes of love and judgment.  The reader learns how the characters in the novel become blind when they are in love, and the effect this has on their judgment.<br />Although it is a great read, I do not recommend it to just anybody.  Readers must stay attentive to the multiple characters that are introduced throughout the novel; readers must also have strong patience because the novel is written with the old English dialect of the early 1800's.  This is one of Jane Austen's best novels, in my opinion.  In her novel Mansfield Park, she merely spends the whole novel demonstrating the progression of love in a New England town.  In Sense and Sensibility, however, not only is the reader able to explore the development of love in a relationship between two people, but also the progression of individual character qualities, such as those of Elinor and Marianne Dashwood.  In totality, this novel is one of Jane Austen's best works.
B000MX7V5M|4.0|A great classic movie!  Cary Grant and Grace Kelly make a great romantic combination and when coupled with Alfred Hitchcock what could be better? See if you can find Hitchcock in a cameo in this movie.  He always inserts himself somewhere in his movies, sometimes more obvious than others.  This is definitely a \\"Must Have\\" for those Cary Grant collectors!!! And the Collector's Edition has some nice Extra Features.
0792164903|1.0|If you're just looking to watch a Johnny Depp movie and don't really care whether it's made up or supposedly based on something then this movie is fine to watch. Unfortunately, if you're looking to watch a movie based on Washington Irving's classic story then this movie isn't really for you. Yes, it can claim to be based on Irving's \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\" but only very loosely. Only the names of less than a handful main characters and where the story takes place comes from Irving's story. The rest of Sleepy Hollow is so extremely far from \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\" that if it were not for the Galloping Hessian of the Hollow (in otherwords the Headless Horseman) the names of the characters and location could be changed and still tell the same exact story without anyone suspecting any link to Washington Irving.    I saw this expecting the usual Hollywood adaptation of a book (or in this case short story), which is to say it's based on the book but things are altered. I was more than extremely disappointed to find out it really couldn't claim much in the way of being based on a story I love. Ichabod Crane is a school teacher from Connecticut, not some constable from New York City sent out to investigate things. Katrinia van Tassel doesn't practice witchcraft. \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\" isn't some kind of horror laden murder mystery. It's more about Ichabod's intrest in winning the heart of the young Katrina as much out of greed for inheirting her father's fortune (Baltus van Tassel was, after all, a wealthy farmer) as his actual genuine intrest in her. And as much as it was a bit of a love story it was also a ghost story. Those who have never read \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\" won't know that Brom Bones (Abraham van Brunt) is suspected to know to much about what happened the night the Horseman chased his rival for Katrina's affections away (nor will they know Katrina turned down Ichabod's affections with her and may have actually been toying with him all along), Irving seems to suggest the horseman that night was Bones at one moment then at the next reveals that the good Dutch housewives of that part of New York know it was really the ghost of the Hessian soldier. They won't know how Ichabod delighted in reading a book by Cotton Mather on Witchcraft in New England even though it terrified him so at night. They'll be likely to believe that if they watch \\"Sleepy Hollow\\" they'll know what \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\" is about.     This movie isn't for those looking for \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.\\" Disney's animated classic is much closer to Irving's story than this. I've seen a couple others, one starring Jeff Goldblum from around the early eighties and one more recently aired on Halmark Channel that are more closely based on the story than this movie should even be allowed to claim. If you don't care about it, then this movie may appeal to you. But if you really want to see a half-way decent adaptation, then do yourself a favor and steer clear of this movie.

1401902197|5.0|I have been a fan of Louise Hay for years, but recently determined to make a concerted effort to direct my life in ways that would benefit me.  I ordered Hay's new DVD \\"You can heal your life\\" and was so moved by it and the accompanying DVD with full length interviews (I bought the expanded version), that I searched for more Hay material.  I purchased I Can Do It and not only read it and underlined parts, but I have created cards with affirmations on them to carry in my pocket each day.  I listened to the CD that comes with the book for several weeks and have so incorporated the material into my thinking that I'm much more aware of the negative thoughts I'm hearing from others and thinking myself.  I immediately change my thought to a more positive one.  I have given a copy of the book I Can Do It to both of my grown daughters and one of them has just told me how much she loves it, though I haven't heard from the other one yet.  This is a total bargain.  Buy it.  It will change your life for the better.
B00065GX64|5.0|This is what every filmmaker should try to produce.<br /><br />This film is difficult to rival.  It was and still is an influential movie that discussed reality with realism and never shied away from continual controversy.  One of the first films about a serial killer, with details ripped from the headlines and extras ripped from the streets.<br /><br />Peter Lorre is a genius in this film.  Even though you know everything, he still manages to illicit some sympathy from viewers.  Lang is excellent at creating a story that draws in his audience and captivates.<br />This movie also solidified Edvard Grieg's \\"In the Hall of the Mountain King\\" as a terrifying piece of music.<br /><br />Although made in 1931, this film looks and feels well beyond its time.  This new edition of this film will ensure its legacy to continue well beyond as a masterpiece!<br /><br />Highly recommend for anyone, especially those who consider themselves cinema connoisseurs.

0307394549|4.0|This is a great book tht makes my mouth water every time I look at it. I can't get enough of it, and have liked 2 of the three cookies I have made from it...not being a big molasses fan...Some of the cookies are a bit tricky and take A LOT of ingredients, which I am not used to. All in all, it is a GREAT book.
B000W9EOEC|5.0|Upon initially receiving this album, I was a little worried it would be repetitive at times like Daft Punk's songs on their other albums. Don't get me wrong I really love Discovery and Human After All (and some from Homework), but I can only handle so much before I get bored.     However, Alive 2007 sounds so amazing. I'm very satisfied with the way they mixed the songs together and changed up some of their sounds. I'm not always articulate with my words, so I'll just say that any Daft Punk fan should love this as well as some others that may normally find them too repetitive. This album makes me crave for more tour dates so I can finally see them live!
0321544080|5.0|Fabulous book, hilarious but very useful comments, great pictures!  I'm sure Joe is a great teacher and person!    Someone here said Joe didn't reveal everything. That is not true. He gives you more details in the beginning and as you read further, it's more about particular atmosphere or thoughts he used to create the particular image - NOT an instant-recipe for perfect photo!  Doesn't matter if you are a pro or a rookie, his thoughts could provide you with something you accidentally overlooked!    This book makes you think and use your brain, rather than copy/paste or steal his ideas!
B000BJS4BM|1.0|There were no hit singles from \\"Confessions On A Dancefloor\\" and that shows how good the album will be if the singles are bad.  I didn't like any of the singles from \\"Confessions...\\" as they weren't very mainstream.  Madonna's new release \\"Hard Candy\\" is a much better album.  If you want to buy a Madonna album check out \\"Hard Candy.\\"  \\"Confessions...\\" just isn't worth it.
0061150142|2.0|First, the good things about this book: Its \\"Then/Now\\" layout is intriguing and keeps the pages turning. Second, the rift that results between two close families as the result of tragedy is explored in a thoughtful and sensitive way. Third, I was fascinated by how art can reveal one's state of mind, even suicidal tendencies. I found myself really wishing I could see Emily's paintings.    But overall, it is difficult to really care about \\"The Pact\\" characters, which seem silly and shallow. Chris' father is as wooden as a tree trunk. His mother gushes so much emotional excess, ranting and raving, that I just want to slap her. Emily's mother retreats farther into the Twilight Zone with every page. The defense attorney's parenting skills are almost as bad as his courtroom strategies to 'invent' the truth.     Emily's reasons for suicide seem limp and uncompelling. Why she is not able to open up to anyone about her feelings and her one upsetting experience makes no sense, especially as she comes from a loving and supportive family. Why she feels so pressured to be 'perfect' is also unclear. I wanted to be sympathetic to her cause, but instead she comes off weak and ultimately selfish. If she had just had the guts to be honest with Chris about her feelings for him (or lack thereof), she would have hurt him a lot less than putting him through that suicide pact and its horrific aftermath.    Meanwhile Chris, her knight in shining armor, totally disappoints by not rescuing her at all. Emotion, and not common sense, is the biggest motivator for all these characters, and whenever feelings rule, common sense retreats. Example: Chris decides that his promise not to tell anyone about Emily's death wish should take precedence over keeping her safe. Another example: Chris decides to bring the gun and bullets to Emily, while simultaneously telling himself he will talk her out of using them. I also found myself wondering how, through all their sexual experiences, Chris could be so clueless not to notice Emily's physical loathing of him.    Blatantly unrealistic was the huge black hole that resulted by no one even asking Chris what happened that night! Are we readers to believe that the police, the prosecuting attorney, the defense attorney, Chris' parents and everyone else were never curious or bold enough to ask him what happened, even while preparing for his big murder trial? Ludicrous.     I have heard great things about Picault delving into controversial subjects, and for that reason, I was looking forward to reading this book. However, another disappointment happens at the end of the story, when she cops out and does not carry the controversy over to the very edge of the cliff. Not everything has an 'out' or a 'pat' answer, and this book should have had the guts to deal with the full, sobering ramifications of that controversy.
1416523359|1.0|As a long time reader of Stephen King's books, it took me two tries to get into this book. The story takes too long to get into the subplots and too much of the book occurs in Lisey's eccentric ramblings and memories. It should have been called \\"Lisey's Labyrinth\\".
B00127RAJY|5.0|I'm a fan of Jillian from the Biggest Loser TV show, and like so many others would give my right arm to have her as my very own personal trainer to bust my butt into fine shape.  I have her other DVDs, but they just didn't have staying power for me.  There wasn't enough to keep me interested and wanting to come back for more, no matter how much I loved her on the small screen and believed in her training.      This DVD has its flaws, but overall it's well worth the money.  As mentioned by other reviewers, you can't skip past the intro or the beginning commentary (you only need the talk once...if that), which is annoying if you do this DVD every day like I do...but I've managed to put up with it so far.    What I really love about this DVD is that it's simple.  These are routines that I won't need the DVD for after a while (or even now if I bothered to jot them down on paper), so I can do them just about anywhere if I pop on some headphones and get at it (you will need hand weights, etc. but not too big of a deal when you're traveling). Right now, I'll enjoy watching Jillian and her cut body...just imagining what mine COULD look like some day if I stick with it (I can dream folks).     The work out was definitely more challenging than I thought it would be, and winded me during pretty good.  However, afterwards I felt great and the next morning I wasn't overly sore (you know the kind of soreness where it even hurts to be a desk monkey all day?).  I am thinking about coupling this with Turbo Jam Cardio Party (45 min session) to pack some extra punch.  I just feel guilty about only doing 20 minutes of exercise, but appreciate its convenience on days when I don't have a lot of time.  However, I do wish that there was an option for an extended workout so I could really get some more bang for my buck on days when I do have the time.    This DVD and turbo jam cardio party have to be my two favorite work outs thus far.  They both keep my coming back for more and the resultsare quick and amazing (you'll be strong in no time).
0321544080|5.0|well, unfortunately i don't have all the neat equipment and access joe has.  but joe has a great eye for \\"the moment\\" and gives us an idea of what it takes to get it.  it was an interesting read to see how he decides to capture his images.  various elements we may overlook are a big help to the overall effect of the picture.  flipping through the book of a well-known international photographer alone gives you a feel for the professional look.  i was disappointed that this book wasn't about camera settings to shoot with for different situations, but i gotta say joe does impart interesting professional knowledge.  just to review his work alone is a fascinating learning experience for young photographers like myself.  in sum, don't expect to learn about exposure and settings so much, but prepare to observe how to capture \\"the moment\\" through a professional eye.  joe gives us access to the professional world of photography that we normally don't have access to.
B000YABYLA|5.0|My biggest fear about this film was that it was going to be \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" ala femme and I didn't get the appeal of Napoleon Dynamite at all.  There's quirky and then there is over-the-top quirky.  Thankfully, this was nothing like the aforementioned film.<br /><br />This is a great little 1.5 hour flick well worth your time. It takes a few minutes to pull you in, for the first 20 minutes I was on the fence as  to whether I was going to get involved.  I couldn't tell whether there was a decent film buried among the quirky tunes and cheeky, cynical teen dialog.  Be patient, a good story is in there.<br /><br />Page is perfect,her mannerisms, her delivery, her presence.  All totally believable. It's a story that drags you into this 16 year-olds' world and about 30 minutes in you realize that despite this kid's cheek and smart mouth, you really do like her and keep your fingers crossed for her.<br /><br />Maybe a couple of the quirky tunes I could have done without.  I don't know, they seemed a little over-done to me but that's ok.  I love the fact that she played Mott the Hoople's All the Young Dudes, a favorite of mine that had radio play when I was about her age.  It would have been great to have had a friend like Juno when I was sixteen.  She certainly helps make her friend's (all 2 or 3 of them) lives interesting and entertaining.<br /><br />Jason Bateman.  This guy is always able to play the perfect smarmy, good-looking, charming-then-arrogant creep isn't he?  I sure hope he really isn't this way in real life.  Every time I see this guy the character he plays makes me want to punch him in the face (credit the writers I guess)  I knew the guy was going to be a jerk from the first scene for his character (Mark).<br /><br />Jennifer Garner finally gets to play in a very different role.  Totally feminine and full of mother-wanna-be goodness.<br /><br />I loved this film.  It isn't a chick flick either, just a quirky comedy/drama about a young lady who doesn't know who she is,finds herself with child, grows up (just a little bit) and learns to deal with it. Entertaining, witty and totally believable.<br /><br />One fear:  Some clod will try to turn it into a TV series, maybe a \\"Joan of My So-Called Life\\" kind of thing?  Leave it alone, this story is perfect at 93 minutes.hild, grows up (just a little bit) and learns to deal with it. Entertaining, witty and totally believable.

0446577391|4.0|Stone Cold surpassed the first two books in this Baldacci Series ... The Camel Club (1st) and The Collectors (2nd). The author completed the development of his lead character Oliver Stone and firmly knotted the loose threads of his former CIA career. The political espionage was pausible; the pace relentless. Baldacci carried the storyline of his apolitical characters from The Collectors giving us more twists in the sub-plot between the ruthless Casino boss and the lovely con artist. I finished the book in two readings within 24 hours and enjoyed every page. I highly recommend reading this series in the correct sequence, otherwise important details about the characters' background will detract from the appreciaton of the story.
044100590X|5.0|When I started off reading Dune 3-4 years ago, I gave up about 200 pages in just because it seemed too complex to me at the time. Years later, I came back to it again because the summertime is quite boring with no job/school.<br /><br />Suffice to say, not only did I understand what was going on a lot better, I actually loved the book in the end.<br /><br />Dune is set on a planet known as Arrakis, which happens to be the gem of the interstellar empire that House Atreides and Harkonnen are in. As it turns out, Arrakis is the sole source of spice/melange that is vital for traveling the galaxy as it helps to sharpen psychic powers and vision for pilots.<br /><br />Recently, the control of Arrakis has been shifted from House Harkonnen to House Atreides. House Harkonnen does not want to give up its source of wealth and power quietly and plots to make matters very turbulent for House Atreides on Arrakis.<br /><br />The Baron, head of House Harkonnen, plots to rid Arrakis of the Atreides anyway he can and eventually sends the young heir to the throne (Paul) into the hostile desert sands. Paul meets the Fremen (sand-people) during his time in the deserts and ends up, no thanks to the Baron, surviving and goes about biding his time until he can somehow convince these people to fight with him to get his rightful throne back on Arrakis.<br /><br />A sub-plot to this book is the fact that Paul Atreides is much more than a mere overthrown duke. He is the product of a plan by the Bene Gesserits, a class of humans highly trained in the psychic arts, to breed one of their own that can see into depths of the future and mind far better than any of their typically female members can.<br /><br />This book was a real joy to read. Sometimes it was tough getting bogged down in all of the characters and places, etc. However, it was not as difficult to read the second time around and I thoroughly look forward to the reading of the second installment in Dune Messiah.
B000J103PC|3.0|An excellent performance by Meryl Streepe (aka Miranda Priestly/Dragon Lady).  Miranda is somebody really big in the fashion industry.  She is soooo big, that everybody jumps to her every desire, including designers, writers, photographers, etc.  Miranda runs a huge fashion business and fashion magazine based out of New York City.  Miranda keeps 2 personal assistants and has only one (Emily) right now and Miranda is looking for a second assistant.  This is the job that \\"a million girls would die for,\\" as you will hear said several times.  The \\"devil\\" wearing Prada does not refer to a Satan figure.  It is just that Miranda is such an unapproachable person, so much so that when she comes in to work, everybody else quickly walks the other way and the workers all go into complete panic.<br /><br />Enters Anne Hathaway, as Andria, a simple girl with a degree in journalism.  Andria is immediately snubbed by Emily and Miranda as having no fashion sense and totally wrong for the job, but Miranda decides to hire Andria anyway, against her better judgement.  Miranda is truly the boss from hell.  Working for her is faster paced than Superman can fly.  She is abrupt, demanding, cold, and volitile.  You are also on call 24/7 and the pay is not that great.  Andria is trying her best but getting frustrated fast when finally she decided to get with the program.  Seeking the assistance of male co-worker and fashion coordinator for Miranda, Nigel, Andria sheds her dumpy sweaters and black school-girl tights and starts dressing in the high-fashion style from the company's supply.  This begins to please Dragon Lady and Andria/Andy begins to acquire bigger and better job responsibilities.  Andy also begins to take on the all-for-business personality more in-keeping with her new line of dress.  Her friends and boyfriend don't really like the changes either.<br /><br />The movie is about the big business of the high fashion industry, even taking you to Paris designer shows.  It's about intense career committment that is above a personal life.  It's also about change, what's important, wheeling and dealing in the corporate world, disappointments, and caring or not caring about people. The \\"Devil Wears Prada\\" could also be a comparison to the concept of giving your personal life over to the corporate world.<br /><br />I guess you would call this a chick-flick.

0374105235|5.0|Ishmael Beah makes no plea for forgiveness nor does he beg a place in this world.  Yet this memoir earns him both.  The horrible atrocities that Beah was both victim and perpetrator of are described with a sort of detached sensitivity that makes this readable to those of us living outside of the tragic, war torn reality that was Beah's.  I applaud Beah's redemptive work as I wish him peace and happiness for the remainder of his time here.
0880796863|5.0|For those interested in Tarot, no matter your level of experience, this deck and book pack are a great value.

0316143472|2.0|I love David Sedaris, but I have to agree with the other reviewer that this book is like one of those \\"Best of\\" albums.  Although I did smile/laugh to myself a couple of times, often it was a sense of familiarity rather than with surprised, belly laugh mirth.  Sedaris also perhaps did not benefit by my mental comparison to a book I had just read, Bringing Home the Birkin, by a first time writer I had never heard of, but who had a unique tale.  I couldnt help but think that Sedaris needs to DO something soon...climb everest, maybe, or take a road trip.  SOMETHING.  Please.  And soon.
1400049628|4.0|After seeing such movies as `Night of the Living Dead', `I Am Legend', `28 Days Later', and a host of other post-Apocalyptic disaster tales, I've had reason to ponder what I would do if I were holed up in a secluded cabin surrounded by hundreds of zombies.  How long would I last?  What should I have with me?  How should I prepare my house?  I even bought a high-end sniper rifle and a crate of ammo!  I seriously thought I was a complete weirdo for even giving it any attention, but I've found to my relief that I have lots of friends out there.    I picked this up in the `humor' section of my local bookstore, which is not where it should be.  I would classify this book as science fiction, or perhaps fantasy.  It reads like an Army field manual and can be quite dry in spots, but it was nonetheless extremely engrossing.  I would liken this to a technical manual for diehard Trekkies that goes into all the performance and engineering specs of some ficticious space battle cruiser.  It even has a large section on zombie outbreaks throughout history (and there have been a lot) and it makes a valiant attempt to explain why there's no historical record of them.    For those that `want' to believe in an impending zombie uprising, this book will grab you from page one and not release you.  Otherwise you're part of a vast government conspiracy to cover up zombie outbreaks!    Worth reading.
1577314808|3.0|This book was a revelation for me, and helped me tremendously.  That said, it was unfortunately boring, repetitive and \\"full of unnecessary words\\".  I believe Tolle could've achieved the same result with 50 pages instead of the 224 in the book.    It should've been either fully psychological or fully \\"spiritual\\".  I don't doubt Tolle \\"seeing the light\\" but it was less believable once I felt that he was listening to himself talk.    Again, the first part of the book was very powerful, and helped me be in the 'NOW', after that, for the second part, I had to skip passages, and run toward the last page. To read with a manual on how to use it fast.  ;-)
0521673763|5.0|Dr. Stahl and Nancy Munter have outdone themselves once again.  While the bar they have set is always high, this is the best book they have produced to date.  Details are rich and easily understood - they even include tyramine content by brand.  Everyone involved in treating patients needs to have this book in their library AND read it.
1592332803|3.0|I want to start out by saying that I really do enjoy this cookbook, and I use it often, however I believe that is because it is one of the only dedicated vegan baking books out there at the moment.      I was very excited when this came out and I was able to purchase it.  It has a wide range of recipes that also includes breads and ethnic treats.  Here is the slight problem I have with it. Nearly every recipe requires the use of Egg Replacer, Vegan margarine, regular sugar, and basic all purpose flower.  Although in the beginning of the book I believe it talks about the use of substitutes for these items, it doesn't really give many examples of it.  In some recipes it uses large quantities of vegan margarine.  Basically you can take any non-vegan recipe, look at it and substitute milk for soymilk, butter for vegan margarine and eggs with egg replacer.  It does not make the recipes unique, it does not give them much more thought, it doesn't really show off what vegan baking can be in its creativity and health benefits.    Until a better vegan baking book comes out, it is worth the purchase.  You can always try your hand at playing around with the recipe ingredients.
B0002VL0KQ|5.0|I have not been a big Celine Dion fan, but I watched her sing the title song, \\"Miracle\\" on a tv show.  I bought my original CD from a local store after watching the performance. The songs are absolutely wonderful!  My personal favorites are Miracle, Come To Me, and If I Could, but all of the songs are great.  I bought this CD as a gift to my niece, who is pregnant with her second child.  She loves these songs, as well.  I used the music to put together a slideshow of pictures of my children growing up.  These are songs from a mother to her child (or about her child), and describe the unconditional love of a mother.  I highly recommend it if you are looking for this type of music.
B000E33VWW|1.0|I do not understand why this move received a lot of good reviews? I watched first \\"Infamous' move about T. Capote. It is much greater move than this. It balances out hrrible crime and Truman's life style and personality. I so much like \\"Infamous\\" that it became my favorite move which I can watch over and over again. The main character in that move is a really great actor. His play moved me comparing with \\"Capote' main character, actor really plays poorly . His artificial play was felt throughout the move. It was first and last time I has been watching \\"Capote\\" and I would not recommend this move to anyone. A poor quality.
B0013BNY2Q|4.0|No band shaped my life more than R.E.M.  One of the greatest American rock bands of all time.  And there are no harsher critics than those who love. So . . .<br /><br />My favorite R.E.M. albums are Murmur, Automatic, and New Adventures, which to this day remains mystifyingly underrated.  I love Up.  Reveal to me was a collection of solid songs that was absolutely ruined by over production.  I think I side with Peter Buck in my opinion of that album.  And Around the Sun took a full solar year to get through, it felt.<br /><br />With Accelerate the are once again rocking, but as one reviewer put it, brevity isn't to be confused with intensity.  Living Well is the Best Revenge and Horse to Water are the best tracks in my opinion, and I also love Mr. Richards.  Houston sounded great the first three listens but got old quickly.  Sing for the Submarine - sort of a low point on the album.  But I'm still praying that R.E.M. will crank out a few more songs equal of my favorites, which always seem to be songs that the radio stations miss:<br /><br />Half a World Away<br />Sweetness Follows<br />Let Me In<br />Leave<br />New Test Leper<br />Lotus<br />Hairshirt<br />Swan Swan H
B000AP04OM|5.0|Everyone knows how popular this movie is but I had no idea after 30 years how much I would love it. My mother insisted I see it as a teenager and I wanted no part of it. As an adult with girls 3 and 6, we are enchanted with this movie and watch it any chance we get. It is always the first request on movie night for my girls. Everytime I watch this film I appreciate it in a new way.The story is lovely and apparently real. The dialog is  witty and meaningful.The songs are catchy and the scenery will mesmerize you. It has all the elements and twists in our own lives. This film  is poetry in motion-picture!-And the sound track! It is just a must for any personal collection.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|Hooray!  Their best album since Kid A in a career dotted with triumph and success!  The perfect synthesis of the earlier 'guitar rock' however one may interpret that with their 'experimental' sound, however one my interpret that.  It's like the Bends and Kid A got drunk one night and had vigorous unprotected conjugation, and nine months later out popped this little gem of a record complete with spooge explosion on the cover.
B000000XB9|5.0|This is a great compilation from CCR, & anyone who's a fan should love it.  I might have changed a couple of the selections, since it's missing \\"Born On The Bayou\\" & \\"Midnight Special,\\" two songs that I wanted & ended up buying Vol. 2 just to have.  I highly recommend this CD.  It's worth every penny.
B00139XZF4|5.0|I am not particularly partial to the fantasy genre, but I much enjoyed this film.  I give it kudos for its originality and direction.  The film moves along while holding your interest with a good subtext on the importance free will.  Dakota Blue Richards is simply charming.  A great family film.  Highly recommended.
B000000XBC|4.0|I bought this in addition to Chronicle Vol. 1, because I wanted \\"Born On The Bayou\\" & \\"The Midnight Special.\\"  As compared to Vol. 1, more of the songs on Vol. 2 are covers of songs by writers other than John Fogerty, & I was less familiar with the CCR covers of those songs than I was with those written by John Fogerty.  I really liked most of their covers.  I was also pleasantly surprised to discover a few John Fogerty originals that I didn't know from my youth that were really good.  As a true CCR fan, I'm happy I have Vol. 2, but Vol. 1 is more reliable as a general sampling of CCR.  Still, I recommend Vol. 2 to anyone who is willing to accept a few (& I don't mean many) songs on a CD that won't really flip their switch mixed in with some truly classic songs.

B001AK3S4Y|5.0|While some good directors never quite \\"get it,\\" it took Guillermo Del Toro only one misfire -- the icky, slow-paced \\"Blade 2\\" -- to get the whole comic-book adaptation thing right.<br /><br />In fact, just about everything is right with \\"Hellboy\\" -- Del Toro crafted an action blockbuster with a grimy, slimy cult-movie feel and a quirky sense of humor. It's graced with excellent acting, spectacular action scenes, and the trappings of clockpunk and Lovecraftian horror -- not to mention that it stars a six-foot-tall scarlet demon with a soft spot for kittens.<br /><br />In 1944, young Professor Broom accompanied an army regiment to a remote Scottish island, where the Nazis -- led by Rasputin -- were about to open a portal to another world, and allow the vast tentacled Ogru Jahad (Seven Gods of Chaos) to enter our world. Rasputin and the Nazis were destroyed, but something came through the portal -- a baby demon, whom Broom names Hellboy.<br /><br />Fast-forward sixty years -- a grown Hellboy (Ron Perlman) and his fishy friend Abe (Doug Jones) are working at a paranormal government agency that specializes in policing the supernatural, with the weirded-out Agent Myers (Rupert Evans) just joining the team. Soon afterwards, Hellboy is called on to kill Sammael the Hellhound -- but it turns out that Sammael can replicate himself indefinitely.<br /><br />As Hellboy and his team try to hunt down the remaining Sammaels, the dying Professor Broom (John Hurt) finds that a revived Rasputin and his immortal Nazi followers have orchestrated all this. And Rasputin is continuing to pull the strings behind the scenes -- including using Hellboy's love Liz (Selma Blair), a depressed pyrokinetic. And when Hellboy suffers a devastating loss, his journey will take him right back to his roots -- and the potential destruction of the world.<br /><br />Watching \\"Hellboy,\\" it's easy to see how Guillermo Del Toro because world-famous for the exquisitely dark \\"Pan's Labyrinth,\\" and why he's been chosen to direct the forthcoming \\"Hobbit\\" movies. This adaptation could have just been another paint-by-numbers comic-book story,  but Del Toro gives it the kind of grime, quirk, brains and heart that a lasting cult movie should have.<br /><br />Part of that cult appeal is \\"Hellboy's\\" distinctive look, with Lovecraftian tentacle-gods and some steampunky details. And the action scenes are pretty spectacular -- trains, slimy hellhounds, sword-swinging Nazis with chopped-up faces, giant clock cogs, and a fiery explosion in a mental asylum. And there are some truly spectacular action scenes in a vast underground labyrinth, full of ancient hammers and collapsing bridges. There's just enough action and grossness, without going overboard.<br /><br />But Del Toro is able to balance out the action with some truly touching moments, such as the aged Broom's final scenes in his firelit study. And there's a lot of dark humor here as well -- and not all of it is Hellboy's dry one-liners. The movie is liberally peppered with dark humor moments (\\"1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45.\\" \\"DID he now?\\"), including some hilariously macabre scenes involving a bad-tempered Russian zombie (\\"This is Ivan Klimatovich. Say hi, Ivan.\\" \\"Go that way, Red Monkey!\\").<br /><br />Most importantly, Del Toro is able to give his characters little human quirks -- hair plugs, love of cats, and Hellboy sanding down his horns in the morning. Perlman is simply amazing as \\"Red,\\" whose gruff scarlet exterior hides a kindly, affectionate heart. Not many actors could emote through that many prosthetics (including a very lifelike tail), but Perlman makes it look natural.<br /><br />Though he's playing a ninetyish old professor, Hurt plays his role with a quiet, powerful sense of goodness. Jones and Evans also do excellent jobs, one as an erudite psychic fish-man (\\"We lead a charmed life,\\" he observes as cockroaches skitter around him) and an earnest young agent. Selma Blair is the one downside -- she sort of mumbles in a monotone most of the time.<br /><br />\\"Hellboy\\" is one of the best comic-book adaptations that Hollywood has turned out, primarily because of the darker, eerier aesthetic Guillermo Del Toro brings to it. Definitely a must-see.c-book adaptations that Hollywood has turned out, primarily because of the darker, eerier aesthetic Guillermo Del Toro brings to it. Definitely a must-see.
B000K4WLXA|3.0|I love the final fantasy series.  ESPECIALLY final fantasy 7.  it was a game that truly changed my life.  I didn't see the movie when it first came out because I was very bitter that it wasn't a PS3 remake of 7.  But I bought it a while ago and had a chance to watch it.  The story is very simple to understand if you're a fan of the game.  It begins about 2-3 years after the events of the first game (i think, I can't remember the time for sure).<br /><br />Its filled with brilliant CGI action with traditional anime themes.  I enjoyed it, but I realized that it just made me miss playing 7.  So I fired up my PSX and played 7 for a few weeks until my fix was fixed.<br /><br />If you loved FF7 and care about the characters you will like this film.  Casual fans of action movies might not appreciate this as much as the die hard constituency of FF fans.<br /><br />Worth a view, but not a buy.  Rent it.
B000O75F7C|5.0|I first heard this cd at a friend's house. It was so incredible that I just had to buy it for myself. Every time I listen to this music, I get transported into another magical world.   Porcupine Tree has that incredible power to get the listeners entranced. The music, the singing, the lyrics are top-notch. This band has made many unforgettable cds. The music in this one ranges from a melancholic sound to a frantic beat. All the songs fit in with each other magnificently. Give it a listen through a sampler, and you'll discover one of the best bands of today.

B00005A46T|5.0|This album to me is not nu metal either,no rapping and just small dj crap and is just a METAL cd.This one totally blew their first album away and same with vol 3 not really nu metal just like this one,only vol 3 is the least \\"heaviest\\".And for iowa is the heaviest thing they done just plain metal and can't wait for their new album they say it will be different from slipknot but BRUTAL let's see if finally they can be called brutal.I recommend this album to any metalhead,besides many real metalheads listen to slipknot the only \\"nu metal\\" band they listen to which they don't really sound nuish ha.So get this is fast,loud,heaviesh,and just awesome it also has some death metal thing going on especially in the last song when you hear a angry growl,but yeah not there yet.SO GET IT YOU METALHEAD MAGGOTS!

B0016B6ZKG|5.0|Where's the smidgen of \\"Once Upon A Time\\", \\"MacArthur Park\\", \\"Love to Love You Baby\\", and \\"Last Dance\\" in this album?  Perhaps nowhere, but I am NOT complaining.  This is yet another evidence that Donna's musical talent, principally her voice, is a chimera--just like a box of crayons and their spectrum of colors!  Listening to the album for the first time and getting treated to a broad repertoire of musical styles--with one, perhaps two, danceable tracks, and one definitive ballad--whisked me back to an era that marked the height of The Diva's productivity and proving her mettle for adapting her voice to the musical form.  The fact that she co-wrote all of the songs also proved her musical creativity, and attending to other priorities must have been the reason for not treating her fans to a full-length album for 17 years.  No matter the collaborative effort it must have taken to produce this collection of songs, she seemed to have returned to the limelight seamlessly.  After all, Donna is the diva of all divas, and the queen may be back but was never really away!  You go girl!<br /><br />Footnote:  Could it be that she was referring to \\"Driving Down Brazil\\" in her VH-1 concert in 1999?  \\"Stamp Your Feet\\" is the perfect wake-up, pick-me-up song. \\"The Queen Is Back\\" starts out with an intro reminiscent of her song \\"Tokyo\\" from \\"She Works Hard for the Money\\" album (1983), while her reggae voice in \\"Crayons\\" sounds familiar from \\"Unconditional Love\\" and \\"I'm Free\\", the latter from \\"Cats Without Claws\\" (1984).  Funky, soul-lish \\"Science of Love\\" can come straight out of her Quincy Jones collaboration back in 1982 with \\"Donna Summer\\". Yet even the funkier \\"Slide Over Backwards\\" harks back to her raspy voice from \\"My Baby Understands\\" in \\"Bad Girls\\" (1979) and her Rod Stewart imitation in her live \\"Dim All The Lights\\" from \\"Live & More Encore\\" (1999). There is indeed something for everyone's taste in \\"Crayons\\", and the miscellaneous flavors we get from Donna's musical skills testify to her extraordinary versatility.fy to her extraordinary versatility.

B000URDEB0|5.0|By far my favorite from this band. Nothing against the original singer, but this new gal has some pipes. Not even sure how I got started on Nightwish, maybe it was Amazon, not sure....either way, love the group!! Since I've bought this CD, it has not left my car, that was about 4 months ago or so. I got the double album with the instrumental stuff on the second CD. In all honesty, the second CD is nice for long drives, just keep on rockin down the highway. Anyhow....overall I really like the new singer, one song they have where she doesn't really let rip gets on my nerves, but who cares, the rest rattle my windows just fine. To summarize this band, I'd say imagine the gutsy power of Type O, the guitars of Rammstein, and the voice of Evanessence.....truly an awesome sound from this group!!!! Keep it coming Nightwish!!!
1582701709|5.0|1.This book is very good as it spells out tools to be positive and successful. It is not, and should not be considered, a spiritual book though. As many reviews state, the so-called secret has been mentioned in many important places, bible, sayings, sages, etc, for a long time. But what makes The Secret, this book, important is that the author chose the right time to paraphrase an important equation in the language of the 21st century, and with the marketing that accompanies such an effort. It undoubtedly has helped many people in many ways, and if only for that it is highly commendable. Notice I write \\"equation\\", I do not believe the so-called Law of Attraction is a Law per se, as Karma, for example, is.     2.In early/mid 1900s you had masters of this same approach here in the USA, especially Emmet Fox, from whom I think I read everything long ago, and then the one and only Florence Scovell Shinn, check out this last author \\"The Wisdom of Florence Scovell Shinn\\" and you will see what I mean, regarding the law of attraction, so on and so forth. This topic is indeed very American, though the author is Aussie, most \\"Masters\\" (as she called them) are Americans. In reality, this approach is very in-tune with the Anglo-Saxon idea of the world.     3.Books like The Secret should be used to round up, polish, provoke, and help, but understanding their shortcomings and that many questions will remain open, the ultimate search is, as the Oracle of Delphi stated, self-knowledge, or as Vedanta agrees Self-knowledge. That is why there will be frustration, visible in many of the negative reviews, when people expected it to be a panacea, which is not and cannot be.     4.But thought-importance leads us to thought-control, and now we are talking about a very important matter. In the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali there is an interesting concept: Pratipaksha Bhavana. It means the mind can only entertain one thought at a time. Ideally by using this concept one reverts back to the thoughtof the Divine: this is Brahma-Abhyasa. So, finally, the use of a mantra or Mantra Yoga is nothing else that using the Law of Attraction to concentrate our mind on the Divine. This is the highest thought or mental modification.
B00005NGZX|5.0|Converge is really in a league of their own, and this album really shows. I would have to say that I had to \\"acquire\\" a taste for this album though. At first, it may sound a bit disorganized or chaotic, but after listening to it more and more, every song is simply intoxicating.     As a drummer, I am blown away by what I am hearing. Especially in songs such as Fault and Fracture, which is by far, in my opinion the best track on the album. If you like this CD, you may not necessarily enjoy the Converge CD's before this, but you will enjoy their other work. But none of it matches Jane Doe. This album is pure gold from track 1 to 12
0307265730|5.0|Jhumpa Lahiri just keeps getting better and better. \\"Unaccustomed Earth\\" is her third book and her second collection of short stories. I'm amazed that she was able to top \\"Interpreter of Maladies\\" with such rich, emotional portraits of love and loss. This book contains eight stories, three of which are linked together, and like all of Lahiri's previous works, each story focuses on individuals from Bengali families who are now living in the U.S. The title story revolves around Ruma, a woman who feels obligated to ask her widowed father to move into the home she shares with her father and son. Other highlights from the book include \\"Only Goodness,\\" which revolves around an older sister's sense of duty toward her alcoholic brother; \\"Nobody's Business,\\" a story of an American man who falls in love with his unavailable Indian roommate; and \\"Hema and Kaushik,\\" three related stories that chronicle the relationship between two characters that spans more than 20 years.<br /><br />Lahiri is one of the most prominent writers of modern fiction, and \\"Unaccustomed Earth\\" is another flawless collection of prose. I recommend this book to everyone, and strongly encourage you to check out the author's other two works as well.
1594489505|5.0|I thought the Kite Runner was a heart rending story, but Khaled has proved that he is a master at weaving and pulling out the innermost of human emotions.  The way the lives of Mariam, Laila, Tariq are interwoven is nothing short of mindblowingly exquisite.  As you read, you could picture the very scene in such vivid detail, feel the emotions of the person in the scene, that its almost as if you are right there, in Afghanistan, among the bombs, in that age.  The precocious daughter, Aziza, tears your heart apart, and you are almost ridiculously enraged at the things that such a small child has had to go through.<br /><br />I found it very interesting that at the end of the story, in the final chapter, Khaled turns the narrative style to present tense \\"Tariq has headaches now\\", \\"She decides that now is the time to tell Tariq\\"... I am not sure yet exactly what the significance is, and although I can surmise many theories, I think it will take a bit of time for me to really understand the author's intentions...<br /><br />I would rate Khaled to be easily among the very best authors of the world... and this book is a MUST-READ !!

She is to become the wealthiest of all the wallflower maidens but with her relatives conspiring to have control over her fortune -- she sets out to make A daring proposal to the most handsome and scandalous viscount.<br /><br />I read this book A few months ago but I could not pass up writing A review for such A great book by Lisa Kleypas! This one is definitely A Keeper! Sebastian is the most sexiest hero LK has ever written about! His looks and personality will blow you away! Both the hero and heroine's character was superbly developed. I love A book that has characters with real life personalities that I can relate to, and this book certainly had that. Sebastian said some of the funniest things to Evie and the chemistry between them was priceless. The storyline was interesting and the love scenes were sensual and sexy. The only problem I had was that I am not A big fan of Lillian so I was annoyed that she had such A big roll in the book and I felt that she overshadowed all the other characters with her huge personality, but that was just A minor setback for me so don't let that stop you from reading this great book! Believe me when I tell you, you won't be dissapointed!

B003A9YC3Y|5.0|There are many classics from the thrash genre. Metallica’s Master of Puppets. Slayer’s Reign In Blood. As one of the pioneering acts I would say YOD was easily Overkills finest overall moment. Almost all of that is due to former guitarist Bobby Gustafson.<br /><br />The songs here have a wide variety of dynamics going on within each and every song. From the classic Elimination to catchy songs like I Hate, Birth of Tension and E.N.D. There really isn’t a weak track on the disc. Epic is an understatement.<br />The production sounds a tad dated but it’s still very much listenable.<br /><br />If you’re a thrash fan old or new who’s never heard this album, give it a shot. It’s a genre benchmark and possible along with Under the Influence Overkills finest moment.
B00169XU8I|5.0|Madonna is back with a compilation of sweet but strong tracks. There have been several reviews made on this album and so far it has been positive. It's definitely a great dance album but quite different from Confessions On A Dancefloor. My fave tracks are: Dance 2nite, Beat Goes On, She's Not Me, Miles Away, Give It 2 Me, and 4 Minutes. Overall, it's a fantastic album and I sure cannot wait to see her in concert this summer. Go get the album, you won't regret it. Thank you.
B00004SZWD|5.0|It's a world unto itself. A world of possibilities, of ideas, of dreams and of intimations. It's a world of music, and at times it's a better world than ours. Songs In The Key Of Life is Stevie Wonder's genius in full bloom and on display, in all its ambition and single-mindedness and multifaceted exuberance. Despite the fact that it's absolutely sprawling (in the days of vinyl, it was spread across two full-length LPs and a bonus EP), it has a kind of unity and internal logic that's so strong that even the record's weaker songs seem absolutely necessary. The best songs, meanwhile, are just plain incredible. \\"I Wish\\" is a rattled funk monster, and \\"Village Ghetto Land\\" is a bitterly ironic piece of social commentary. \\"Sir Duke\\" is an ecstatic tribute to Mr. Ellington, and \\"Contusion\\" is a ripping slab of jazzy prog-funk. And then you've got the stark, spooky melodicism of \\"Summer Soft,\\" and the rapturous \\"Joy Inside My Tears.\\" \\"Have A Talk With God\\" expresses personal faith without being preachy, and \\"Knocks Me Off Of My Feet\\" professes helpless love without sounding corny. What else? Well, there's \\"Isn't She Lovely,\\" which is jut fantastic (even though it could stand to be a couple of minutes shorter). And then there's that flawlessly cosmic paean to universal love, \\"As.\\" And a lot of other great stuff. Like \\"Black Man.\\" And \\"Ordinary Pain.\\" And \\"Saturn.\\" And... oh, just buy the darned thing already!
0061124265|5.0|This is the first novel I decided to read by Paulo Coelho. Yes, the title is very blunt, quite literal, and perhaps a bit pretentious to a jaded generation who consider such things as \\"cool\\". However, the text itself is turely far from pretension. Infact, it's quite modest and dealing with such a subject as suicide and mental institutions, the story becomes simple,honest, and life affirming.    In the first page of Coelho's novel, Veronika decides to die (no pun intended). Her attempt, though, fails, and she awakes in a mental institution where she is told by the head doctor, Dr. Igor, that in her attempted suicide, she had in fact had done serious damage to her body, her heart to be exact, succumbing her to eventual death. So it seems she did succeed. The remainder of the novel is Veronika accepting her fate and allowing herself to become free(for a lack of a better word)or liberated, uninhibited of all the things in life (including herself)that seem to follow routine. Along her \\"journey\\" of self-discovery she meets a few people in the institution that more or less guide her in her path (some more inadvertently than others). The outcome is ultimately satisfying though there is a twist that's quite predictable but that's really not the focus of the story's intention. So therefore, it holds little regard.    \\"Veronika Decides to Die\\" is genuinely a beautiful story: well written, good, reliable characters, simple but effective message. One doesn't have to be a female to enjoy the story because in the end it's fully universal to everyone including those who've never had the though of suicide in their minds. It's a quick read with much to admire.
B000SEK28S|4.0|This is the first book in the Blossom Street series, and an introduction to the people on Blossom Street.  I'm one that enjoys coming a little late to the party in a series of books, so if I really like the first one I can have a reading marathon without waiting a year for another in the series to come out.  Macomber is wonderful at character development, and you find yourself really invested in the people in the book.  Some of the plot was predictable, but satisfying. I'm looking forward to reading 'A Good Yarn' next.

0316143472|5.0|I have been waiting for a new David Sedaris book for a long time.  I read the entire book yesterday afternoon and I could not stop laughing.  His descriptions, dialogue, and demented details are uniquely Sedaris.  This book did not disappoint; I knew what I was getting into the moment I read through the table of contents.  Some critics are saying that there is nothing new here, blah, blah, blah.  What do they want from a David Sedaris book?  Romance?  Epic Adventure?  YA Fiction?  I am a huge fan of Mr. Sedaris (David, not Lou), and his essays on his life leave me laughing.  The section on smoking was not only funny, but very truthful.

There were times when I found myself skipping a bit through the racing elements to get back to the 'meat' of the story, but overall a thrilling ride with a satisfying ending.  I was a bit hesitant initially, because some of the reviews felt this novel was too depressing.  I didn't find that at all, though it was emotionally draining at times. I loved Enzo's character, I'd enjoy a friend like him.  Those crows got what was coming to them :)

Although, given the trend of todays current animation(dead leaves style) maybe I should be glad that they decided to go CGI and not something like that.    Anyone who likes action anime and a story and world in the vane of Ghost in the Shell will like this.  Maybe a rental before purchase, but given the inexpensive nature of the HD-DVD/DVD combo disc, 2 rentals will get you this!

0333382846|5.0|A tremendous resource for costuming enthusiasts of this era.  I read the one review that said the patterns may not come from the actual garments, but instead from second-hand artist's renditions (resulting in less authenticity).  Based on the number of actual photographs in the book I don't necessarily think that is the rule, but rather the exception.  I still see a great deal of value in the book as the garments are covered in more detail than any other book I have ever purchased.  If you can't go see and copy the garments yourself, this is the next best thing.<br /><br />Buyers do need to be aware, however, that they will not find much on middle class garments (it isn't pointed out, anyway), and absolutely nothing on peasant garments.  Also, head coverings were not as extensive as hoped, and again, what is covered is only upper class headware (which the middle classes sometimes wore similar styles, but this book doesn't make any attempt to elaborate).  No biggins / coifs are discussed, though Elizabeth is reported to have worn coifs.  Not a whole lot in the way of under garments are discussed, but the book does provide one of the best period prints I've ever seen depicting farthingales (they were bigger than the bum rolls today's reenactors use!).  Does not give instructions or details for making stiffened farthingales or cages of any kind.  One or two photos of silk stockings (too expensive for middle and lower classes, however the knit style shown may be applicable to lower classes).  The book does not cover Sumptuary Laws which governed what colors / garments could or couldn't be worn by which classes.<br /><br />Excellent for showing stitch work and up close construction of actual garments, both in seams and decorative finishes.  A couple up close samples of lace are provided, as are fasteners of various types.  Covers both men's and women's garments.<br /><br />Patterns are simple versions in miniature with no details for proper order of construction.  As other reviewers have said, one would need plenty of sewing experience to take these patterns and create an actual garment.  Bottom line:  It is not an exhaustive work, but an excellent and important one within its scope.d, one would need plenty of sewing experience to take these patterns and create an actual garment.

I love how different Duffy's sound is and how she throws is back to the 60's era.  Her broadness of range is appealing and I really think she is unique.  I am getting tired of the women artists right now who can't be any more unique than continuing to get the biggest beat masters to help them sell an album, i.e Madonna using Timberland and Timberland.  Duffy's cd is a sweet cd and she has alot more going for her than her other competitor named Winehouse.

And whilst horrified at what she has endured, you want to read more - to see how someone survives an attack like that, and what life is like for a rape victim in the hours, days and week afterwards.     I couldn't put this book down - a combination of great writing and admiration for the author, made this a compelling read.
B0013TPV0Q|5.0|When I first purchased my kindle I was dissapointed that the kindle store did not feature the entire Sedaris library but to my suprise 6 am I searched for Sedaris and the new book was right up front. What an uplifting and humourfilled book thus far A+
0689865384|5.0|Last I heard they were making a movie out of the trilogy.  This book caught me by surprise as to how good it was.   Tally's adventures are incredible  and entertaining that you cannot let go of the book.   It still reads like a teen book but do not let that stop you from reading this book it is GOOD!!!!!
0452289963|5.0|A New Earth is Eckhart Tolle's second book on the power of living in the present moment. Like The Power Of Now, his first book, A New Earth is special to read. Words are powerful carriers of energy, and both of Eckhart's books emanate the love, peace and joy that he obviously experienced while writing these from a place of presence and high level of consciousness.    The book takes its title from a Biblical prophecy that refers to the emergence of a new heaven and a new earth, the deeper meaning of which relates to the transformation of human consciousness and the reflection of this higher level of awareness in the physical world. Although the title has its basis in a Christian teaching, A New Earth is a spiritual book and as such can be read by people of any religion or people of no specific religion. In fact, it is interesting to note that the feedback received from the webcasts done recently by Oprah and Eckhart Tolle has indicated that many people have found that reading the book enabled them to understand the teachings of their religions in far greater depth and to apply them with far greater insight than they had previously had.     While The Power Of Now was written in question and answer format, A New Earth reads more like a traditional book, and it is therefore often the preferred introduction to the topic for many people. It was certainly Oprah's choice for the webcasts that she and Eckhart conducted! Having read both books, I would probably recommend starting with The Power Of Now; however, this really is a personal choice and either will do as a starting point. The important thing is to read at least one of these books, and to reflect on and practice the teachings contained within them. Increasing your awareness and living in the present moment can be a challenging process, particularly when you start, but the rewards are immense.     In addition to going in-depth on subjects such as the ego and the pain-body, A New Earth addresses the topic of consciouscreating, particularly in Chapter 10. Although Eckhart never refers to this as The Law Of Attraction, the principles that he discusses provide a spiritual view on the process of creation. If you've ever felt disillusioned by the very materialistic view of The Law Of Attraction, then Eckhart's description of how consciousness creates may be just the antidote that you need!
B0018R3A9W|5.0|The last time I was this moved by a songwriter was the first time I heard Ani DiFranco. Adele is just 19 years old and has an ability to weave words and wisdom together as if she's been around much longer. Add to that a voice that is so striking and soulful it'll leave you suspended in time just hanging onto her words and phrasing. Her influences include Billie Holiday, Etta James and Peggy Lee, but the pendulum swings wide and she's also inspired by the likes of The Cure and Jeff Buckley. The beautiful, full-figured, young Brit speaks, sings and writes with an East End accent (working class), which only adds to her earthy appeal. When discussing her weight she's said, \\"I don't actually care. I don't want to be on the cover of Playboy or Vogue, I want to be on the cover of Rolling Stone or Q. I'm not a trend-setter, I'm a singer.\\" Columbia Records inked a deal with Adele's worldwide label XL Records to break the youthful chanteuse in the states. Since debuting on MySpace in 2004, she has received nearly 3.5 million profile views! The phenom entered the UK Album Chart #1 and 19 has already been certified Platinum in her homeland! The single, \\"Chasing Pavements\\" is a global hit and promises to be a smash on several radio formats here in the U.S. We're delighted to welcome Adele to our world of Smooth! Thanks for the burst of articulated, raw expression... it's been sorely missed 'round these parts.
B0019X3ZZY|1.0|I am a huge fan of the Criterion Collection and own every title in their line.  I do not - and will not - own this one for one simple reason - it is the most vile, disgusting piece of garbage I have ever seen.  I watched a video of the film several years ago - and yes, I'm sure on the DVD it will be much sharper and clearer when the children are forced to eat their own feces (seriously).  It is the one movie I have ever watched that literally made me ill, I wish I had NEVER seen it.  I am not a prude, I am a liberal, censorship-hating cinephile who nevertheless feels strongly enough about this film to publicly denounce it, hoping to save some fellow human beings from enduring this horrendous work.  Some films stick with you and change you forever - \\"Sophie's Choice\\" and \\"Schindler's List\\" spring to mind as examples of films that still haunt me and disturb me but I am glad that I saw because they reveal truths about humanity that need to be expressed and shared.  \\"Salo\\" is haunting because it was made by someone who obviously hated himself and humanity, and it haunts for it's hatred and misanthropy.  If you're into seeing young people forced to have sex and eat their own urine and feces, and then watching them brutally and graphically mutilated and murdered - then this is the film for you.  I am embarrassed that the revered and esteemed Criterion Collection is putting out this piece of garbage - for a second time.  There are those that will buy this simply because they TRUST the folks at Criterion, and in choosing to put out this film, they have betrayed that trust.
B00133KHCO|5.0|A very touching film about a boy finding his way in life. For music and movie lovers. How two people's worlds can come together and make music magical. Just get the movie and you'll love it too.    My girlfriend and I loved it.   I also got a great deal on Amazon.com  Came in about a week. Thanks.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Great workout (working to get to level 3). Deceptively hard because you don't think 20 minutes can be a tough enough workout to make a difference. It does. I wish you could cut to the chase and get right to the start menu, though, so you don't have to wade through stuff in the beginning. It's tedious when you do the workout everyday.
B0014KD46W|5.0|Since Steve Winwood was 16 years old and leading Spencer Davis to their chart leading hits, he has always continued to grow. Exploring new musical ventures and teaming up with Super Star performers, many times at their request. Heck, Jimi Hendrix was astonished that he was going to actually have Steve Winwood record on his Historic Electric Ladyland LP!  Add to this his diversified talents that would draw in Latin Legend Tito Puente and you have a solid idea of just how legendary Steve is.  Sure, he has changed directions several times, from Spencer Davis and earlier goups to the Jazz influenced Super Group Traffic, to the Mega Star Super Group Blind Faith, to his 1980's top pop chart era where he had several major solo hits and today, his 21st Century rebirth into jazz/Latin/Rock.  Listen to his 2003 'About Time' and you will hear   Steve's solid Jazz/Latin influence coupled with his 'blue-eyed soul' vocals. Not to mention the sound of his terrific Hammond B3 playing, occassionally taking back seat to his equally great guitar work. Yes, a  mega star for certain! Now he brings us Nine Lives!  With Nine Lives, he once again assembles masterful songs, all of which are well arranged and supported with superb musicianship.  The songs range for rockish 'I'm Not Drowning' and 'Dirty City' (where he invited his close friend Eric Clapton to play with him) to the Latin influenced 'We're All Looking' and 'Hungry Man', and both songs will get you feet moving! There is also the classic Winwood easy-flying type song such as the aptly named 'FLY'.    Clapton's guitar work on Dirty City is not overwhelming, and that it exactly as it was intended. It's just as it needs to be to make the song work. And that's what top musician's do. In this case very successfully. For the remainding songs of the 9 on this CD you will be equally pleased and will find memorable enough to want the lyrics.     Mr Winwood turned 60 just days ago, but his vocals are as strong and his musical drive just assteady as it was in his earler rock days.  Do not miss this terrific piece or work. You will play it over and over again! Guaranteed!     Added 6/17/08 - Just Saw Steve at Westbury Music Fair in NY and it was a smash!  He played 6 of the 9 songs from 'Nines Lives' along with songs from his 2003 hit 'About Time', Traffic, Blind Faith, his early solo years and nailed them all! If you have the opportunity to see him live, DO NOT miss the chance. He is a most gracious living Legend who loves to entertain us with his musical genius!
B000GIXEIG|5.0|This movie, to me, was exceptionally well done.  The fact that it was made in the area of the original poem made all the difference to me.  The scenery was beautiful and the actors did a fabulos job of acting despite the hazards and the cold and the leaking ship and shortages of financing.  Gerard Butler was the most fantastic Beowulf.  He made you feel the climate and the atmosphere of the land and problems of the people,  I truely liked the fact that he took time to try and understand why Grendel only killed the tribe of the king and not him or the woman.  Gerard made you feel the feelings of Beowulf and his confusion at the reason for Grendel's anger toward the king.  I loved IT!!!!
0141439793|4.0|I watched the recent BBC version of the Northanger Abbey story first and loved it.  I'm a Jane Austen fan who hasn't read all the novels but I'm working on it.  So I got the novel to see how it compared.  It was great!  I love her humor - tongue in cheek and so witty.  But the thing I really want to comment favorably about is the Penguin Classics edition.  I get so much background and insight and explanatory information from these editions.  I've read 3 of them now and they are marvelous. I've read quite a few novels from this era and it is really helpful to have notes to refer to in the back that explain things.
B000YAA68C|5.0|I am a big Gerard Butler fan. I have viewed several of his movies and am amazed at the variety of parts he fits into.  This movie did not disappoint me at all.  This is a movie that I had to purchase for romantic and comedic appeal.  It is well worth watching.
B000LPQ6DE|4.0|I LOVE the story of Jane Eyre. It is right up there with Pride and Prejudice in my opinion.  I've seen many different film and miniseries adaptations (and even a musical version that is excellent!) and they all have their strengths and weaknesses.  This 2006 Masterpiece Theatre Classics version has excellently captured the sense of humor and chemistry between Rochester and Jane.  It also doesn't abridge the plot points, as some do, but has a good pace and isn't at all tedious as some mini series, more scrupulously tied to the novel, tend to be. (Two exceptions of note for me were a skip in the story line that later fills in the details and takes just a bit of license. Perhaps this makes for better cinema and brings Rochester into the latter portion of the story - which I can appreciate because he is lovely to watch! And, the ending left out a happy detail, which I couldn't understand.)  I thought all the acting was absolutely first rate!  Very realistic and appealing (perhaps a bit too attractive, compared to how they are described in the book, but hey, that's not too surprising in the \\"biz\\".) And I loved the music. It was haunting and most evocative of the shifting mood of the story. Brilliant all around! A credit to Charlotte's masterpiece!
0307265730|5.0|This book is a series of stories and the first story hooked me immediately. It really pulled at my heart chakra. It was subtle and beautiful. As I read the first story on the plane, I found that I was often smiling to myself, as the interaction between the grandfather and grandson really touched me...not in a sentimental way, but in a subtle and deep way...if that makes any sense at all.     I found that with the start of each new story, I was a wee bit reluctant to leave the last characters behind, so it took me a few pages to get into each story. But once I was in, I really enjoyed it.    The last section - three stories about two characters named Hema and Kaushik - was just exquisite. That is the best and really perfect word to describe this piece of work. Lahiri says so much about connection and karma and the complexity of origin, love and loss, without saying anything at all specifically about those topics. The intereaction between the characters is everything. Lahiri is an excellent story-teller. Her style is steady, subtle and powerful all at the same time. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is interested in how humans connect with one another in various ways, or in the many, many different permutations of the concepts of family and origin.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|We purchased the DVD as a gift for a convent for retired nuns.  Their glee at receiving it was overwhelming but the sound and pictures were difficult for them to enjoy with their set up so they did not experienc the full joy and fun of this outstanding work.

B000VBJEEG|5.0|In an age of overstimulation, car chases, crashes, and the planet being in peril more than once a week, Ratatouille is good old fashioned, classic storytelling at its finest.<br /><br />If you love a good story.  See this film.<br />If you love a good movie.  See this film.<br />If you have kids.  See this film.<br />If you are single. See this film.<br /><br />What you will find are themes that are universal to us all.  The need to be true to yourself, to overcome humble beginnings to become someone special, the need to persevere when those closest to you don't  understand, and out of their best intentions seek to teach you to play it safe.<br /><br />You will find that Ratatouille works on so many levels.<br /><br />My favorite scene is when Remy is captured an locked in the chef's trunk.  Ready to give up he is rescued, but not before the ghost of Gusteau challenges him to be who he truly is, not who other people want him to be.  No matter the consequences, he is not a rat, he is a Chef, and Chef's must cook to be true to himself.<br /><br />Be sure to savor the scene where Anton Ego, the critic, tastes Remy's Ratatouille.  For those of us older types, it can be a very poignant moment.<br /><br />Most Highly Recommended!<br /><br />Cheer!

0618918248|5.0|This book just  reinforced my true feelings about religion. If you look at things in a logical & orderly manner, it just doesn't seem to make any sense what-so-ever. Just think of how much more pleasant the world would be without  the hatred & war that religion has caused throughout the ages. Religion is just another way of dividing people.

0061537934|5.0|This novel is now on my top ten favorite books list. It has a unique narrative voice, that makes this novel both singular as well as inventive, standing apart from the onslaught of new releases readers face each year. With themes that many people can empathize with balanced with the racing metaphor, which I thought would never work coming from a non-racing background yet ultimately will add to the experience to any reader. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!

1552091090|5.0|This is a book I've had for years.  I first heard it read aloud in a school faculty meeting, and tears were flowing.  It was meant to show the teachers how much every child means to their parents.  I have since read this book to preschool grandchildren; they, surprisingly, did not miss the meaning.  They enjoyed the messes the kid made, too!   I continue to order this book for friends as a gift to remind them of the legacies that we leave with our children.  They truly learn what they live!  I ordered this one for new parents of a nephew.  It's a great shower gift for a baby.

B0010ZR160|3.0|We all know Ben Affleck as actor, screenwriter and celebrity, but now he is starting to establish himself as a film director.  \\"Gone, baby, gone\\" is based on Dennis Lehane's novel, writer famous for setting up his stories in Boston, Affleck's home town.  We are also introduced to Casey Affleck, Ben's younger brother who is making his mark on the big screen.  Story is set to the event of the young child's adbuction.  Child's mother is a shady character, addict who occasionally serves as a mule to a local drug lord.  It seems that their unresolved differences are the main cause for little girl's disappearance.  Film is a great showcase for the underclass of the unfortunates one is familair with not only in Boston area but anywhere else in US.  We see uneducated , trashy people, women not ready to be emotionally available to their own children until it is too late.  People who should not have children have them and the one who should are not so lucky.  Ben has a long road ahead until he becomes a remarkable director, but he is learning and one has to give him a credit for that.  I can see why the supporting female role was in race for the Academy Award this year.  Good assemble of fine actors cannot help the weak story of the screenplay.  Better luck next time, Ben.

B0000AK7AC|1.0|First and foremost: Babe is one of my favorite movies.  If you haven't seen it, you're missing out.  But this movie has \\"coming attractions\\", previews that cannot be skipped.  Granted, they're only a few minutes long.  But you have to watch them each and every time you play the disk.  No skipping to the title menu.  If there were other versions available, I'd buy them.    Hey studios: Ineffective marketing tool.  Next time I'll research before I buy, and won't buy a movie with forced previews.
1600241824|2.0|Yet again, another lousy packaging by Hachette Audio. After ordering \\"The Ultimate David Sedaris Box Set\\" last year from the same publisher, I should have been wary of buying this. I love hearing David Sedaris read his own stories in his inimitable style, but I really hate the way they are packaged in both of these sets. Like the previous collection, the CD's are packaged in blank cardboard sleeves with no artwork or track listings, which will eventually scratch up the CD's if left in them. The CD's, when put on my computer to copy to Itunes, showed no track listings. Track names were listed on the CD, but this is just a lazy and a cheap way to present such a talented and funny author who deserves so much better. Dissapointing, especially for the $34.98 list price. Hachette Audio, you suck.
B000J103WK|1.0|This item was worthless to me.   I did not realize that it was \\"HD\\" and would not play on anything except an HD DVD player.   I understand that Blue Ray has made HD obsolete so now I have a DVD that I cannot even watch.

B0006GVJEE|5.0|This intelligent and action-packed thriller made me stand up and take notice of several actors who I hadn't known before, as well as the work of director Luc Besson. Few action thrillers are as original as this one; after all, there are only so many shoot-'em ups that you can stage before the whole idea becomes shopworn. But this one manages more than a few original twists and turns--as in the Lolita-like love story between the young girl and the older man, which was downplayed in the American version by cutting some of the footage that was left in the European release of the film. Sometimes it doesn't pay to live in the land where stodgy and/or prudish characters like Mrs. Grundy and Samuel Bowdler were icons--you get these Bowdlerized versions of European films. :-)<br /><br />Jean Reno is terrific as the hitman with a heart, and Natalie Portman is impressive as the precocious 12-year old who has lost her family to the corrupt cop, played by Gary Oldman. Oldman is superb as always, but perhaps plays his part even more over top than usual, as the double-dealing, cocaine-snorting cop who's searching for Reno and Portman after a drug deal goes bad. Also, I hadn't seen Danny Aiello in many years, and it was good to see he's still working.<br /><br />The whole cast is terrific, and there's enough action in the flick to satisfy even the most jaded taste. I thought Reno was the most memorable, which is saying something as it's no mean feat to upstage Portman or Oldman in this film, but he's just great as the simple, but big-hearted hitman with acrobatic, ninja-like skills. Each scene is memorable and just well written and tightly directed. There's no wasted verbiage or action.<br /><br />With the restoration of over 20 minutes of previously cut footage the movie has even more appeal than the original. I think this movie is the best of its genre and easily stands heads and shoulders above the competition with a strong plot and story, engaging characters, strong performances, and enough action to fill up three lesser movies. Overall a fine film and one that is probably destined to become a classic.to fill up three lesser movies. Overall a fine film and one that is probably destined to become a classic.
B000LAZDQA|4.0|This movie is simply phenomenal. The movie is about human relations with oneself, each other and about sex. The movie attempts to de-mystify and de-eroticize sex in such a splendid and matter of fact way that it succeeds, and while doing so manages to make a great film.<br /><br />\\"Shortbus\\" is about several characters. Sofia is a sex therapist who has never had an orgasm, James is a gay man in a great relationship but suffering from depression and Severin is a dominatrix who is unable to have a meaningful relationship with anyone. Along with other minor and major characters, these people interact with each other, changing for the better or the worse each other's lives and sex lives.<br /><br />This movie is so amazingly touching and moving that I found myself completely absorbed by the characters and their stories. I was completely immersed in their compelling and interesting stories, being the joy and sadness along them. The movie, which has mostly first time or little known actors is frankly, simply brilliant.<br /><br />Although the movie is about sex, depicts real un-simulated sex and sex is the main topic, it actually is about something else, something deeper: it is about human relationships. As another reviewer mentioned, this movie will not be enjoyed by those at issue with sex on movies or gay scenes; but, everyone else, this is a great great and, let me say it again, great movie.
B00000255F|5.0|A dreaming harmonica and a rainy-day piano begins \\"Thunder Road.\\"  The harmonica fades away and the piano picks up.  \\"The screen door slams, Mary's dress waves,\\" Bruce Springsteen sings.  \\"Like a vision she dances across the porch as the radio plays: Roy Orbison singing for the lonely.  Hey, that's me and I want you only.  Don't turn me home again - I just can't face myself alone again ...\\"The drums come in, the guitar twangs, the bass rolls, and we take off on one of the sweetest rides rock and roll has to offer: \\"Born to Run.\\"<br /><br />About mid-way through that song, Springsteen informs us, \\"I got this guitar and I learned how to make it talk.\\"  Well, he's not kidding.  But the instruments on this album do more than talk: they come to life, like shapes growing in a pop-up book or strangers emerging from shadows in the dark of night.  Clarence Clemons' saxophone roars like the engine of a muscle car crashing through the late-night air, and Roy Bittan plays the piano as though he were writing a love letter.  Garry Tallent's bass rolls with all the streetsmart indifference of one of the \\"street corner youths\\" Springsteen mentions so often.  Max Weinberg's drumming becomes the pounding of two young lovers' hearts.  And Springsteen's guitar, well - it's youth itself.<br /><br />That's what \\"Born to Run\\" is all about.  It's the ultimate serenade to youth in all its rebellious, slick, chrome glory.  It's in the music, it's in Springsteen's voice, it's in his words.  He recorded this album, his third, when he was just 26 years old.  Almost 35 years later, it's still the greatest thing he's ever released - and that's really saying something, because Springsteen has released some of the greatest albums of all time.  He has never been in better form than on this beauty, though.  In the pantheon of rock and roll lyricists, Springsteen may not deserve to sit right beside Bob Dylan, but he definitely ought to get a spot near him.  The material he wrote for \\"Born to Run\\" is sheer poetry.<br /><br />The best song on the album is the title track, a rip-roaring, slick anthem, and the best of its kind.  It's Springsteen's signature song, and also the finest example of Springsteen's trademark philosophy, sung right in the first verse: \\"Baby this town rips the bones from your back - it's a death trap, it's a suicide rap.  We gotta get out while we're young, `cause tramps like us: baby, we were born to run!\\"  Springsteen's \\"stay and rot, leave and live\\" philosophy may be the heart of the song, or it may be the subject matter: a declaration of love to a girl named Wendy.  Springsteen's protagonist wants \\"to die with you Wendy in the streets tonight, in an everlasting kiss.\\"  Well, with Danny Federici's glockenspiel shimmering like a brand-new set of rims, guest drummer Ernest \\"Boom\\" Carter's kick drum pounding like a young lover's heart, and Springsteen shouting some of the most sincere lyrics he's ever written, if \\"Born to Run\\" doesn't win over Wendy, nothing will.<br /><br />The theme of young love resurfaces on most of the album's tracks, but in particular on \\"She's the One.\\"  The upbeat, carousel-style piano part adds a sort of dramatic irony to its lyrics, which focus on a man's love for an intensely-attractive but freezing-cold-hearted woman.  Love alone - be it love for youth or love for a woman - doesn't drive these songs, though.  They're also driven by an intense desire to live and to get the hell out of this lonesome, washed-up town - because as far as Springsteen's concerned, you can't do both.  That desire eventually inspires the protagonist to resort to robbery, on \\"Meeting Across the River.\\"  Springsteen sounds like he's trying to make himself believe something that he doesn't believe.  \\"The word's been passed,\\" he says.  \\"This is our last chance.\\"  If the somber tone of the song, enforced by a lone jazzy horn, is any indication, they missed their chance.<br /><br />It's not always \\"all or nothing,\\" though.  The smooth, easy-rolling \\"Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out\\" is as cool as any rock song released in the `70s.  It's also regarded as one of the hardest rock songs to understand.  The song is actually loosely based on the formation of the E Street Band; its protagonist, \\"Bad Scooter,\\" is named after Springsteen's pre-\\"Boss\\" nickname.  Bad Scooter is saved by \\"the Big Man\\" in the third verse: that was the nickname for Clarence Clemmons - hence his improptu solo.<br /><br />On the vinyl release, side one and side two are closed by \\"Backstreets\\" and \\"Jungeland\\" respectively.  \\"Backstreets\\" rolls and thunders like a Friday night in a corner bar, resting on pounding drumming and a low grumble from Springsteen.  It revolves around the relationship between the narrator and \\"Terry\\" (most likely Springsteen's long-time friend Terry Magovern).  The two are forced to hide their love from the others and \\"hide on the backstreets\\" - until Terry runs off with another man, leaving the protagonist lonely, angry, and heartbroken.<br /><br />\\"Jungeland\\" is a different story.  Clocking it at an astounding nine and a half minutes, \\"Jungeland\\" is a rock epic and a Springsteen masterpiece.  Revolving around gang violence, the song is composed of roughly four sections.  The diversity of these sections is impressive: the song opens with a bold violin part, which leads into a piano piece.  That part picks up into a standard rock part (arrangement-wise), which leads into the most rebelliously romantic instrumental bit ever in rock, highlighted by a knockout performance from Clemmons.  Then Springsteen comes back in and everything's quiet; he's supported only by a hard-truth, mournful piano part.  Finally, the song climaxes with a crescendo and a mad rush of emotion.  But while the diversity may be impressive, it's the way Springsteen weaves them together that is truly extraodinary.  He is the finest seamster in rock n' roll.<br /><br />Additionally, \\"Jungeland\\" features some of the greatest lyrics ever put on paper by the Boss - or anyone else in rock, for that matter.  Rod Stewart, John Mellencamp, and similar musicians tried to write music like this, but only Springsteen could compose a piece like this, the final lyrics of the song:<br /><br />\\"Outside the street's on fire in a real death waltz<br />Between what's flesh and what's fantasy<br />And the poets down here don't write nothing at all<br />They just stand back and let it all be.<br />And in the quick of the night they reach for their moment<br />And try to make an honest stand<br />But they wind up wounded, not even dead --<br />Tonight in Jungleland.\\"<br /><br />And with that, one of the very finest records in rock history comes to a close.  Springsteen's heartbroken corner youths walk into the night; his nowhere-bound factory workers' sons draw back into the shadows.  This is the \\"working man's album\\" if ever such a thing existed: Springsteen's been there.  That's why he's endured over all these years.  He's a regular guy.  If he was sitting beside you in a bar or at the gas station, you wouldn't even notice him.  But he's a regular guy with a whole lot of talent: he can write rock and roll like no one can (save for Bobby Dylan).  His songs are beautifully-arranged, styled like the rock n' roll classics of the `50s and `60s, and they capture the feelings Springsteen writes about so powerfully that they could make a 70-year-old man feel like he was 25 again.<br /><br />So for those who feel they don't have time to listen to Marvin Gaye or Bob Dylan or any of those \\"old folks\\" because they're too busy being young, well, give the Boss a shot.  \\"Born to Run\\" was ranked the 27th greatest album of all time by VH1, and the 18th of all time by \\"Rolling Stone.\\"  It remains the ultimate celebration of youth, young love, and that inescapable feeling that comes with it: we were born to run.as any rock song released in the `70s.  It's also regarded as one of the hardest rock songs to understand.  The song is actually loosely based on the formation of the E Street Band; its protagonist, \\"Bad Scooter,\\" is named after Springsteen's pre-\\"Boss\\" nickname.  Bad Scooter is saved by \\"the Big Man\\" in the third verse: that was the nickname for Clarence Clemmons - hence his improptu solo.    On the vinyl release, side one and side two are closed by \\"Backstreets\\" and \\"Jungeland\\" respectively.  \\"Backstreets\\" rolls and thunders like a Friday night in a corner bar, resting on pounding drumming and a low grumble from Springsteen.  It revolves around the relationship between the narrator and \\"Terry\\" (most likely Springsteen's long-time friend Terry Magovern).  The two are forced to hide their love from the others and \\"hide on the backstreets\\" - until Terry runs off with another man, leaving the protagonist lonely, angry, and heartbroken.    \\"Jungeland\\" is a different story.  Clocking it at an astounding nine and a half minutes, \\"Jungeland\\" is a rock epic and a Springsteen masterpiece.  Revolving around gang violence, the song is composed of roughly four sections.  The diversity of these sections is impressive: the song opens with a bold violin part, which leads into a piano piece.  That part picks up into a standard rock part (arrangement-wise), which leads into the most rebelliously romantic instrumental bit ever in rock, highlighted by a knockout performance from Clemmons.  Then Springsteen comes back in and everything's quiet; he's supported only by a hard-truth, mournful piano part.  Finally, the song climaxes with a crescendo and a mad rush of emotion.  But while the diversity may be impressive, it's the way Springsteen weaves them together that is truly extraodinary.  He is the finest seamster in rock n' roll.    Additionally, \\"Jungeland\\" features some of the greatest lyrics ever put on paper by the Boss - or anyone else in rock, for that matter.  Rod Stewart, John Mellencamp, and similar musicians tried to write music like this, but only Springsteen could compose a piece like this, the final lyrics of the song:    \\"Outside the street's on fire in a real death waltz  Between what's flesh and what's fantasy  And the poets down here don't write nothing at all  They just stand back and let it all be.  And in the quick of the night they reach for their moment  And try to make an honest stand  But they wind up wounded, not even dead --  Tonight in Jungleland.\\"    And with that, one of the very finest records in rock history comes to a close.  Springsteen's heartbroken corner youths walk into the night; his nowhere-bound factory workers' sons draw back into the shadows.

B000BT97AO|4.0|This beautiful movie that has the magnificent quality of looking like a dream and a graphic novel at the same time. It also looks a bit like a mix between [[ASIN:B000O77LWE The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]] (the remake) and [[ASIN:B00003CXKM The Cell]] in style. Neil Gaiman has created an amazing story, but the filmmaker, photography people, costume and set designers, CGI and all those involved in the creative process have created a movie and a world that is amazing and beautiful to watch. The complexity and the greatness of this great world make it alluring and enticing, on in which you would get lost in an attempt to solve a great mystery.<br /><br />The story? Oh yes, there is one. But honestly, I was happy enough just looking at the movie. The movie is about Helena and the world which she has created through her drawings. One night the border between the real and the created world are crossed and Helena is trapped. To return to her world and wake up the Queen of Light she must find the charm.<br /><br />The movie is full of symbolism and discusses the idea of duality: good and evil, light and dark, dream world and real world. In fact, the dream world is quite the allegory for the real world. Touching on doubles, dreams and even a bit of psychology, this film is great. The cinematography, the story and the look of the movie were all excellent.<br /><br />The DVD includes the making of, subtitles in 9 languages, commentary, trailers and a poster gallery.
B000WTNCQI|5.0|On \\"The Joshua Tree,\\" their fifth album, U2 climbed the Everest of rock.  Every rock band since has been attempting to do the same, but none have come close.  Never in history has rock music sounded so free and so beautifully harmonious as it did on \\"The Joshua Tree.\\"    \\"The Joshua Tree\\" came after 1984's \\"The Unforgettable Fire,\\" an ethereal dream of an album that was a far cry from the anthemic rock found on the group's first three records, 1980's \\"Boy,\\" 1981's \\"October,\\" and 1983's \\"War,\\" arguably their first masterwork.  The Police were considered the world's biggest band after the release of their massively successful fifth album, 1983's \\"Synchronicity.\\"  When Sting declared that the group was finished at the peak of their popularity in 1984, the world was more than prepared to accept U2 as their new saviour.  But the surprise ambience of \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\" left even the band's most dedicated supporters unsure what to do (though, in support of that album, Miles Davis reportedly asked that it be played on his deathbed).  Additionally, the band realized, according to vocalist Bono, \\"U2 had no tradition.  We were from outer space.\\"  They had toured the United States extensively, and were profoundly affected by the country, its open spaces, and what it stood for.      America.  The band had found their tradition.    Producer extraodinaire Brian Eno, who also produced the Talking Heads' and David Bowie's finest albums and released some darn fine records himself, capitalized on the group's desire for music with a sense of location, a cinematic quality, urging the band to build its songs from the imagery found in the American writings they had been reading.  Drummer Larry Mullen Jr., who had narrowly escaped blending into the background on \\"The Unforgettable Fire,\\" built a strong foundation for the album's soundscape, just as Franklin, Jefferson, and the gang fashioned a sturdy base for America.  The Edge's guitar had echoed to infinity on \\"The Unforgettable Fire,\\" but now he was surrounded by mountains and plains.  The Edge used his surroundings to create a sense of direction that he didn't quite have on the previous album, and in doing so, he escapes his boundaries.  To fill U2's America, Adam Clayton's bass became its people, and Bono - who might as well be applying for the job when he sings, \\"I have spoke with the tongue of angels\\" on the album's second song - Bono became their voice.    One doesn't have to venture far into the record to hear how far U2 had progressed since their debut began with that iconic, buzzing guitar part seven years before.  Whereas that album's opener, \\"I Will Follow,\\" was a pounding love song, \\"The Joshua Tree\\" begins with \\"Where the Streets Have No Name.\\"  The group realized that they didn't need to fashion the loudest opening they could.  Instead, the song begins with a dreamy synthesizer part that sounds like it has more history than any person ever could.  Then the Edge's guitar starts ringing, softly, dreamlike ... Larry Mullen's drums burst in, and at that point, U2 broke down the walls of popular music in the 1980s.  \\"I want to run / I want to hide,\\" Bono sings.  \\"I want to tear down the walls that hold me inside / I want to reach out and touch the flame / Where the streets have no name.\\"  One believes him, too, which is no small accomplishment considering the grand nature of Bono's lyrics.  More importantly, though, the music makes one feel what Bono's singing.  By the time Bono has entered the song, we too want to run and tear down the walls.      The group took their gospel influences and turned them into the album's second track, one of U2's finest and most recognizable songs, \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For.\\"  On \\"The Joshua Tree,\\" the music conveys each song's message as well as Bono's lyrics ever could; \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\" is a prime example of this.  Once again, the world's most famous Irishman sings of loneliness and a spiritual search forfulfillment, utilizing the image of barren American countryside for dramatic emphasis:      \\"I have climbed the highest mountains  I have run through the fields  Only to be with you  Only to be with you.\\"      But he still hasn't found what he's looking for.    By the time we reach track three, however, he may have found what he was looking for - but if so, it wasn't what he needed.  So goes one of the most misunderstood love songs of all time, and the second-best thing the group ever recorded: \\"With or Without You.\\"  Nowhere is that cinematic quality the band was shooting for more richly realized than on this song.  When the song begins, all soft, steady drums, thumping bass, and uncertain guitar, one feels the sense of loneliness and romanticism oft associated with the landscapes of midwestern America.  Bono backs it up with some of his greatest lyrics:    \\"See the stone set in your eyes  See the thorn twist in your side  I wait for you.  Sleight of hand and twist of fate  On a bed of nails she makes me wait  And I wait without you  With or without you  With or without you.\\"    Everything comes together on this one, but by all the heavens and the earth, the highlight is the Edge's guitarwork.  The climax of the song features one of the greatest and most powerful guitar parts in history, created using \\"Infinite Guitar,\\" a device which allows each note played by the electric guitar to echo infinitely.  And echo it does: it echoes to the sky, it echoes through the hills, it echoes across the plains, and it hits hard in the hearts of any listener who has any life left within him or her.  Particularly during the climax, images abound.  Bono standing atop a high mountain, whailing in heartbroken agony, the Edge's searing guitar his words rolling down into town.    Things take a different turn on \\"Bullet the Blue Sky.\\"  First it's just us and Larry Mullen pounding the heck out of his drums.  Then Adam Clayton and the Edge come in, and it's like someone dropped an atomicbomb.  One of the darker songs the band has recorded, \\"Bullet\\" deals with Bono's frustrations with the Reagan-led United States during the 1980s.  When Bono growls, \\"This guy comes up to me / His face red like a rose on a thorn bush / Like all the colors of a royal flush / And he's peeling off those dollar bills / Slapping them down,\\" he's singing about Ronald Reagan.  Bono was not a fan.    It spoke volumes about the band that they could seamlessy transition from the pounding, portentous rock of \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\" to \\"Running to Stand Still,\\" one of the group's most powerful compositions, a song that is sad, regretful, and as beautiful as anything U2 ever composed.    \\"Step on a fast train  Step out of the driving rain, maybe  Run from the darkness in the night.    She is ragin'  She is ragin'  And the storm blows up in her eyes  She will suffer the needle chill  She's running to stand still.\\"    The song deals with drug addiction, inspired by a girl Bono knew from his hometown in Ireland.    \\"Running to Stand Still\\" closes side one of the album.  Where side one is all grand anthems, side two is more simple anthems.  \\"Red Hill Mining Town\\" and \\"In God's Country\\" are two loving odes to old-fashioned America.  \\"One Tree Hill,\\" which, yes, the popular television series was named after, was written in memory of Bono's friend Greg Carroll, who died delivering Bono's motorcycle during a rainstorm in 1986.  \\"Trip Through Your Wires\\" was written as a companion piece to the ruthlessly bittersweet love song \\"Sweetest Thing,\\" which the band released a single before the release of \\"The Joshua Tree.\\"  It seems bizarre for Irish rock star Bono to open a song playing a rusty harmonica like a good ol' American boy, but he pulls it off.  It's the final two songs of this side that are the most interesting.    The first of these is \\"Exit,\\" which is unquestionably the most sinister song U2 has ever recorded.  The song revolves around a once-religious man who becomes fueled by darkimpulses when he can't work out life's mystery with the \\"hands of love.\\"  Unfortunately, the song motivated Robert John Bardo to murder actor Rebecca Shaeffer in 1989.      The closing song, on the other hand, titled \\"Mothers of the Disappeared,\\" sounds light, bright, and dreamlike, inspired by the tale of the \\"Disappeared,\\" thousands of people who resisted the Argentine military regime that took power in 1976.  Bono learned about the Disappeared during the 1986 Amnesty International Conspiracy of Hope tour, where U2 appeared alongside Lou Reed, Bryan Adams, Peter Gabriel, and Sting.    Now here we are, just past twenty years after the release of the album.  The Joshua tree on the album cover - which, by the way, is the most appropriate and one of the best covers of all time - has been dead for eight years.  U2's \\"Joshua Tree,\\" however, is as strong as it ever was.  When \\"Rolling Stone\\" compiled its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, \\"The Joshua Tree\\" was ranked 26th.  On VH1's 100 Greatest Albums list, it was ranked 15th.  And on the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame's list of the Definitive 200 albums, \\"The Joshua Tree\\" was ranked the 5th greatest album of all time.      Today, U2 is frequently ranked just behind the Beatles on lists of the greatest rock bands of all time.  Both spread messages of love, love, love, and both evolved in unpredictable ways with each new album.  Since the release of \\"The Joshua Tree,\\" U2 has continued to evolve, chiefly in the '90s.  The first record they released that decade, 1991's \\"Achtung Baby,\\" was fittingly described by Bono as \\"the sound of four men chopping down 'The Joshua Tree.'\\"  That album, which I would also very strongly recommend, is U2's second masterpiece, just one of many beautiful albums that they have released throughout their career.  But never has the band recorded so natural and smooth a work as \\"The Joshua Tree.\\"
B000LC3IDI|5.0|This is a well done horror film that makes you think.  I liked how certain questions were answered following various clues in the film.  I have not seen Saw part I, but this is definately better than Saw II.      This film definately compells the audience to think about deep issues.  We all from time to time run into people who we feel have done us wrong and we fantasize about exacting revenge on them.  Normal people would experience much emotional pain if and when they see another human being suffering regardless of what he has done.  One of the premises of the film is that vengenge does nothing but increase one's emotional pain.  Unlike the previous Saw film, the two main test subjects in the film had a choice to be better people than Jigsaw but choose not to.  They were so consumed with rage and allowed it to get the best of them.      The people who were kidnapped and placed in various torturing/killing machines were objects of rage for the subjects.  The kidnapped people had no control over their fate.  Only the test subjects could stop the machines if they wanted to.    People may complain about films like this but if we read the news every day we see that people for the most part behave the same way (if not worse) as they do in this film.  Most are under the false impression that vengenge solves anything.  In the end of the film Jigsaw smiles as he is about to be killed, because of how rediculously predictable people are.
B0010YSD7M|3.0|Stargate will always be a great series...no question about that.  Unfortunately, this DVD misses being more than a hurried attempt at wrapping up some loose ends. So many loose ends that none get fair treatment, and it ruins the story. Locations were great, same quality production values, but just not put together. So sad to say it, but true.
B0015D3Z4O|4.0|The songs: Four Minutes & She's Not Me are my two favorites...Although I will admit that the entire album is growing on me. I can already imagine gay bars mixing these songs into even better dance songs. I am happy with the CD... but it didn't strike me the same way Confessions did where EVERY song was sooooo good. At the end of the day I am still a huge Madonna fan...and would love anything she makes!  : )
B000UJ48VI|5.0|The opening scene of `Lolita' is flawless, utterly flawless.  In fact, it may be one of my favorite movie sequences of all time, flaunting one of my favorite supporting performances of all time; Peter Sellers' Clare Quincy.  Sellers marvelously uses his wit and humor to draw us into his character and create a bond with us, wetting our appetite as to what he is really all about.  As he staggers from side to side and attempts to humor his unexpected guest we find ourselves fully embraced by this film and completely ready to delve right into Kubrick's vision.<br /><br />Many have baulked at that said vision, claiming that it strays to far from Vladimar Nabokov's scandalous novel.  I personally have never read the novel (I really should now) and so I cannot comment on that regard, but Kubrick has been known for his personal interpretation of his source material so it doesn't surprise me.  I personally was recently called out for judging a film based on its source material and was told, and I quote:<br /><br />\\"This review is not a film review; it is a disappointed review from a reader that can't distinguish the art of movies from the art of literature.\\"<br /><br />I want to address this subject since Kubrick is the master of making each and every movie his own vision versus that of the original author or materials.  The reason I criticized that particular film (`Less than Zero' for anyone wondering) was that is veered so much from the original text that it dumbed down the authors initial concept and created a generic film about drug addiction that did nothing to distinguish itself as important or vital.  It took the authors marvelous concept and delivery and muddled it with clich&eacute;s and in the end created a film void of any real substance.  The difference between a film like that and anything Kubrick has made is that, while he may veer from the original intended impact the source material conveyed he always creates a film filled to the brim with substance and vision and thus creates a film that is socially important.  Just look at what he did with `A Clockwork Orange' or `The Shining'.  He may have strayed from the authors originally penned words, but he never extracted true meaning and emotional impact from his work.  Both films are marvelous examples of inspired vision.<br /><br />That said, `Lolita' does not disappoint in remaining true to Kubrick's style and vision.<br /><br />The story follows Professor Humbert Humbert as he entertains his dangerous attraction to the underage Lolita.  Humbert first meets Lolita when he is being shown a room within her mothers home he is planning on renting.  It is the sight of the beautiful blonde that seals the deal and convinces Humbert to rent the room.  Despite his lusting for Lolita, it is her mother Charlotte that desires to have her way with Humbert, and eventually Humbert gives in to her advances if only to have more time to spend with Lolita.<br /><br />I was shocked in the route Kubrick went with the film, straddling the edges of a black comedy as apposed to embracing the film as a serious and dramatic adult film.  I only had the synopsis and the many years of hearing the term `Lolita' thrown around as a backdrop so I was expecting a much darker film.  What I got though was an entertaining look at the amusing side of the male psyche.<br /><br />When you think about Humbert's situation, it is not as far fetched and or `scandalous' as one may initially conclude.  While yes, his eventual `relationship' with Lolita is illegal and morally repulsive his initial attraction is not that uncommon for men of his age and even younger.  She is a pretty young girl who is obviously mature for her age and is flirtatious beyond her years; whether out of spite for her mother or out of repressed urges caused by the loss of a father in such a dramatic way.  Nevertheless, her advances towards Humbert, no matter how subtle, no doubt would draw his attention towards those not-so-grey areas in life.What `Lolita' shows is the danger in succumbing to those human desires and the aftereffect that it has on a man's soul.  As Humbert dives into a relationship with Lolita he becomes raked with guilt and insecurities as he struggles to keep Lolita to himself despite her obvious desire to be free of him.  Watching Humbert slowly fray until he becomes a panicked skeleton of his former self is both humorous as well as alarming.  His obsession consumes and in the end controls him to the point where he is a slave to his own pagan desires even though he knows they are morally corrupt.<br /><br />I think the biggest reason this `comical' approach works is that it manages to humanize the situation as apposed to over dramatize it.  Sometimes when a film takes a very dramatic approach to a subject such as this one it can come across almost otherworldly, as if the situation were so horrible it could never happen.  The approach taken here helps the audience to see that this is more common than one may want to admit.<br /><br />The film, and Kubrick's vision, are pushed along by some very strong performances, most notably that of Peter Sellers who plays Clare Quincy, Humbert's rival.  Sellers has often been lauded as the king of comedy and so it is not too farfetched to conclude that he would be the comical highlight of the film.  His opening scene along is marvelously constructed.  Like I said; one of the greatest supporting performances of all time.  Shelley Winters is also extremely memorable and utterly hysterical as Charlotte.  Her performance solidifies her as one of the greats and really defines her characters desperations beautifully.<br /><br />The two main stars really had to sell this though, and so without the dedication of both James Mason and Sue Lyon `Lolita' would have fallen flat.  Mason comes off a tad boring during the first half of the film, but as his characters obsessions get the better of him it becomes apparent that that `boringness' was necessary to creating the needed effect of a mind gone mad.  He was just a normal guy who lost it because of the passions of a young girl.  Sue Lyon is very effective as Lolita.  From her first scene we can tell that she is extremely desirable.  For a young actress (and a debut performance at that) she really holds her own amongst the cast and does a very fine job of making Humbert Humbert relatable, because truth-be-told, we want her as much as he does.<br /><br />In the end I must call `Lolita' yet another Kubrick masterpiece.  It is far from what I expected but in the end it manages to exceed my expectations because it became something so much more than a generic drama.  Kubrick is nothing short of a genius, and this film fits beautifully in his catalog of marvelous cinematic gems.human desires and the aftereffect that it has on a man's soul.

B0002V7OI8|5.0|I read what David Chute had to say and he is almost completely wrong. The movie was great with remarkably developed characters, superb dialogue, and terrific acting. Robert Duvall gives a 5 star performance and the movie is certain to be one of your top 20 favorites.<br /><br />Its not just some big rock hitting earth and killing a lot of people. That sort of comment should be beneath anyone who represents amazon. The truth is, the meteor is discovered about a year's travel from earth. At first, a coverup while the government decides what to do about it. The press find out (as they always do) and the world as a whole is forced to deal with the situation. The movie goes from executing three plans for survival each heart wrenchingly realistic. This isn't a silly bunch of oil diggers being sent up by NASA-- as was the case in the ridiculously far-fetched Armageddon-- this is a movie steeped in fact! Entertaining from start to finish, I highly recommend it!
B000UO8BB6|5.0|Recorded in May 1962, midway through Herbie Hancock's two year Jazz apprenticeship that began the year before, all of the signs of his future greatness are here. Some of his electrifying talent and obvious promise are exemplified by his superb pianism: a solo rooted in the 1940s Blues and Stride technique of Albert Ammons and Meade Lux Lewis, single note lines with fragmented chords whose complex beauty evoke composer favorites like Ravel and Debussy, blues and gospel influenced melodies that are effortlessly stretched into 16 and 32-bar themes, and those crisp, caustic tone-clusters that Hancock would later use to such wonderful effect while anchoring the rhythm section in the second great Miles Davis Quintet. Like fingerprints on glass, his talent and great promise are all over the compositions that fill this set, writing that is mature beyond his years. The signs are all here on a recording made when Hancock was all of 22 years of age. His fine compositions include what would later be a huge hit for Mongo Santamaria: 'Watermelon Man', and 'Three Bags Full', which features a great tenor sax solo by Dexter Gordon that sounds as if he'd been listening closely to John Coltrane. Gordon's solo is not as blistering as Coltrane's sheets of sound but it is artful and deeply expressive, as he celebrates the strength of character needed to overcome private demons. Hancock's own personal favorite from this set is 'Alone and I', a ballad in A that features some exquisite Haiku piano playing that reveals the lyrical beauty in midnight loneliness; Dexter Gordon's haunting sax sings the wounded soul wandering in the darkness. It is an impressive and beautiful track. Freddie Hubbard's trumpet and flugelhorn are a powerful addition to the sound of this great album. His solos are never less than searching and strong. Three alternate cuts round out this superb debut.<br /><br />This remastered CD, its audio refurbished in a 24-bit resolution analog to digital transfer for the Rudy Van Gelder Edition, features instruments that sound full, warm and immediate, the hallmark of most Blue Note recordings of the early 1960s. This is an important release for all those who care about where Jazz was heading in those early revolutionary days. Strongly recommended.<br /><br />Mike Birmaner Edition, features instruments that sound full, warm and immediate, the hallmark of most Blue Note recordings of the early 1960s. This is an important release for all those who care about where Jazz was heading in those early revolutionary days. Strongly recommended.    Mike Birman
B0013FXWU6|4.0|A well shot film by Paul Thomas Anderson about the greed that fuels the oil business based loosely on Upton Sinclair's novel [[ASIN:1934568457 Oil]].  Sounds like a movie about history, so what's this nonsense of a horror movie based on actual events?  The title sounds like a horror film, is it that?  No.  The score is like something out of [[ASIN:B000UJ48WC The Shining [Blu-ray]]], could it be the mood?  No.  In 2007 I pre paid for my oil and did a budget plan with a local company, my rate was $2.59.  On May 1st 2008 I was sent my new contract to lock into the a rate of $3.84 which I had to return by May 30.  On May 22, 2008 I received another letter saying they had sold out of oil in record time and my contract was void and they would send out new information.  On June 3, 2008 I received the letter stating I could lock in for $4.29 a gallon, for the avg I need that is $326 a month and $3,586.000 a year.  And I have a new house and don't use that much heat in comparison to others.  Oh, before arriving home to get the letter in the mail I stopped to fill up my gas tank at over $4 a gallon.  I've just set the stage for some real life horror or satire depending on how you see the glass.  Paul Thomas Anderson knowingly or unknowingly creates a character in Plainview  that can be used as a metaphor to mock the ridiculousness or our current state or to show the true horror of it.  As for the title in a revolution there is usually blood.  Either way nobody is packing up the family and moving to Beverly because we couldn't afford the gas it would take us to get there.  Another horror film just in theory it reminded me of (again only in theory) is the highly criticized [[ASIN:B0008191WO The Amityville Horror]] for it's being based on a true story.  Ghosts or not that family's financial fears are real and hit home.    MY IDEA:  I read an article that stated that Nascar is suffering because these die hard fans usually travel all over to see the races but with large vehicles and what not they cant' afford it.  So here it is.  The biggest gas guzzlers have to be race cars, so what if Nascar boycotted itself.  Went on strike.  Those guys make pretty decent money and their fans are die hard.  More people might watch Sportscenter then the news and it plays about 20 times a day and each time would cover such a story.  Perhaps maybe just a well known well off racer.  It's a theory which I'm sure someone could poke a ton of holes in.  I don't have the answers I'm just throwing out ideas.      DVD Features:  (NONE)
B0015519VS|5.0|I've grown up listening to Usher and I must say this Album is mature and just as HOT as Confessions. If you're looking for a CD of club joins, this is not for you but the quality and enjoyment you will get out of this CD is just as good. If you're like me and have been a fan from your teens to your twenties you should love it( or maybe you're just not ready for grown folks music but whatever. It's the club joins that sound the same and are boring; I mean if I hear another two step song I'm going to hurt somebody).I love the hold CD and each song has something that makes it melodic; a few songs I enjoy best:Track3- love the way he says ba-by; Track4- love the beat and the song is oh so sexy;Track6- featuring will.i.am it's a fun song and I see it being a hit single; and also track13 Appetite- and that better be a single, I love it. I could go on, but I'll let you buy it and come up with our own list of favs. You may have to listen to the CD more than once, unlike the negative critics, but ALL the songs grow on you and you'll love it.
B000BVEKO0|4.0|Don't get me wrong with this review, I love the old koRn sound as much as every other koRn fan. However, another stomping koRn album that followed in the footsteps of \\"Take A Look In The Mirror\\" or their previous recordings would have been disasterous.<br /><br />Like it or not, the traditional koRn sound was becoming stale. KoRn needed to make some drastic changes and they have for \\"See You On The Other Side.\\" The album has a heavy industrial influence that blends perfectly with the guitar elements that Munky and Fieldy bring to the table. The \\"back to basics\\" guitar riffs work very well with the industrial/experimental theme of the album. Also, Jon Davis has greatly changed his focal style from the usual \\"scat\\" sound to something more melodic (with well placed \\"heavy\\" vocals).<br /><br />To me, the highlights of the album are \\"Twisted Transistor,\\" \\"Love Song,\\" \\"Open Up,\\" and \\"Seen It All.\\" These songs show that koRn are heading in a new creative direction that will only get better with each album.
1594489505|5.0|I have told everybody I know to read this book, I have bought 5 hard copies just for gifts. I believe every man woman and child should read this book and find out what goes on in Afghanistan.  This is a powerful novel i can hardly wait until he writes his 3rd novel.
B00139W3NE|3.0|While it was cheesy starting out and hard to follow, it picked up with the introduction of the ice bear. Sadly, just as we were enjoying it, boom it just ends. The very odd, uncomfortable ending leaves the viewer hanging.  Review would've been 4 stars if not for the sorry ending.  I didn't read the book.    I loved the ice bears and Serafina the witch.  Everything else was so-so. The movie jumps around barely able to keep a plotline going, if at all.  There was no relationship between Lyra & her uncle which is sad. Kidman's character Mrs. Coulter was one-dimensional and boring.   I'd probably read the books now.  After reading the reviews, I have no idea what attack on christianity anyone is talking about. I would have had NO idea whatsoever of any parallels between the church and magesterium if I hadn't read these reviews. I'm glad I didn't read them prior to watching the movie.  Decent effort overall, but poor screenplay or plot and some lack of characterization brings this movie down a notch.
0307387178|5.0|\\"...there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun...we just have to have the courage to turn against our habitual lifestyle and engage in unconventional living...\\"  -Alexander Supertramp   Certainly unconventional, Into the Wild, is not your typical coming of age story.  Christopher McCandless, a graduate fresh from college abandoned all aspects of the predictable way of life to be immersed in nature and his personal ideals. Leaving behind family, his few friends, and his own name, McCandless or Alexander Supertramp was, \\"a man of means, by no means...king of the road.\\" However Into the Wild is not chronological fiction-esque novel, but more of a scavenger hunt jumbled with Krakauer's personal and historical anecdotes. Into the Wild is not only informative on the life of Chris McCandless, but also of other figures with similar stories, and some of Krakauer's past as well.    This novel, as it follows a young boy through his journey, is not just a memoir, but more of a warning and source of inspiration. If I would take anything away from this story it would be the need for personal experiences. McCandless warns against a stationary life, not only physically but mentally and to perpetually change. The story begins as Chris road trips across the US in a run down old car, and ends in a run down old bus in semi-Alaskan wilderness. And between those two circumstances lay hippie camps, encounters with southwestern farmers, danger on the railroad, kayaking on the Mexican border, bonding with strangers, and a final trek into the Alaskan wilderness. Chris heeds all to find themselves in nature and to travel by ever-changing scenery   McCandless, stated in Into the Wild, was criticized as a young naïve radical, without the common sense to take on an adventure of this proportion. However, McCandless was an extremely intelligent young man, not only a college graduate, but always earning high marks in all courses, an avid reader of philosophy and a follower of Thoreau. The novel doesn't really focus on Chris's life before his cross-country adventure, so its hard to see if his experiences we read about really affected him as a person, or if he was the same way his entire time.   This story was an eye-opening experience. As Chris wandered around the American continent I wandered my own mind. Chris's attitude and way of life melted through the pages of this novel and into my own fingertips. His individual character, and never-ending love of nature and his charismatic way of drawing in the people he met in his life. I can only offer my sincere recommendation for this novel as the story gives so much to you.
B00154GEFU|5.0|If you like Asia you will like this disk. It is basically a continuation of where they left off when the original members left. The first song starts out with a riff like \\"Heat of the Moment\\". Remember when Robert Fripp declared progress rock no longer being progressive in the early eighties, he was right.  It just goes to show you how lethargic the music scene is when no one is hungry anymore and everyone one is playing dead. At least Asia put out a disc of new material which in this day and age you are penalized for and really got the street team out there working it. The price of the disc is right also.
B000002KAT|4.0|It's hard to think of Van as an introverted mystic, but this is where it all started.  Yea, he had a first life as a Belfast bluesman and some time on Bang records when he produced one of the great pop singles of all timee, but this documents Van's summer of guitar.  If you don't study this album, you're not a Van fan.  As a matter of fact, find it on vinyl and digest it in twenty minute doses of mysticism.<br /><br />Essential.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|I am loving this new album.  Madonna has some great beats on there for my walking workouts with my iPod
B000MR9D5E|5.0|to begin with, the budget and effort put forth into this film is beyond any documentary you could ever watch.  These guys poured heart and soul into this film for 5 years, you can tell by their 'making of' xD    the footage is truly amazing.  unlike anything youve ever seen before.  some of the things you'll see in these dvds is so majestic that you wont even believe your eyes, really!  truly a wonderful set.    i am a senior in high school, and ive seen a lot of documentaries in school.  this is the only one ive seen worth buying.  a truly breathtaking set.
B0016HNOXQ|1.0|At first, I thought this album was terrible; with flat vocals and uninspired and pretentious noise filling in for the lush and skillful signature beats that launched an entire genre.    After three listenings, I still hated it.     After five, I hated it and I had a head ache.    However, after I read the reviews here, I realized that if I don't like this album, it must be because I just don't understand the music. I also realized that the thematic fulcrum of this album is heart-break and pain.     Then, suddenly, it hit me; I finally \\"understood.\\"  This album gave me nothing but heart-break and pain.  It is living art.  Amazing.    If you hate yourself, buy this album. It's cheaper than buying two angry monkeys and recording them fighting each-other with power tools in your closet.
0618918248|4.0|Richard Dawkins utilizes a lot of solipsistic rhetoric and speculation on which he bases his premise: that God is scientificially illogical and thereby can not reasonably exist.  Yet, he does not argue cogently from point to point, but keeps returning the arguments of Darwinian evolution and statistical probability.<br /><br />Let us remember though, that empirical reasoning is a useful human construct that allows us to impose some degree of order on the cosmos in order to shape our understanding of it.  However, empiricism itself recognizes that its suppositions are useful until new evidence presents itself.<br /><br />Much of Dawkins' arguments are based on supposition, speculation and self-serving theories that don't really don't have much of a basis in fact.  He tries to draw tenuous analogies to weak hypothesis that simply aren't very convincing overall, and don't tie together well enough as a treatise to support such a bold title.<br /><br />Some of his points are amusing, and some standing by themselves, are valid, but comparing Cargo Cults to Christianity and Scientology is really a stretch.<br /><br />Mr. Dawkins bases his arguments on the implicit premise that human reason is practically flawless, and that we know everything useful and important that could possibly be known.  Otherwise, how can we know that his arguments are in fact correct?  Simply because you can't bottle the essence of God and analyze what he is comprised of and determine how he functions in a laboratory, it is illogical and foolish to expect Him to exist?<br /><br />Comparing what you know to what you don't is admittedly useful, but the analogy breaks down when you try to apply the scientific method to determine or refute the existence of God.  We're trying to apply our limited human understanding to fathom the infinite.  It's a noble and worthy effort, but ultimately, in spite of his eloquence, the arguments Dawkins has presented against the existence of God simply aren't terribly compelling.<br /><br />Unlike Martin Luther, I don't see faith as reason as adversaries, but rather as complementaries - as each has the potential to mitigate the hubris of the other.  I do not deny the existence of God - but I don't accept many of the things that are attributed as having come from Him.<br /><br />I don't deny the existence of Mr. Dawkins, either - even though I don't believe in Atheists.  If his perceptual framework as a biologist leaves him no room for belief in a deity, I haven't any issue with that.<br /><br />But using the framework of his scientific disciplines to try and convince me that my Theism is equivalent to the superstition of an unenlightened aborigine?  He's welcome to try, but I remain unconvinced that he's right.<br /><br />He believes that there is no God.  I believe that there is.  So what?  Neither of us is right, neither of us is wrong.  It's not a competition.<br /><br />He argues that faith is irrational, as is romantic love.  Ah yes, and so are art and music.<br /><br />Yet, it is a little bit of these types of irrationality, well-directed and channeled through friendship, romance and artistic pursuits, that enrich our lives and continue to bring more beauty into our world.<br /><br />I would think that a hyperrational, non-intuitive world in which all the mysteries had been solved or rebuked wouldn't be worth living in.  Could we use more rationality?  Absolutely.  But do we need to eliminate or discard everything that scientific method can't create or empiricial reason can't resolve?  If we did, we'd lose our compassion, as well.<br /><br />That's what I perceive as Richard Dawkin's line of reasoning carried out to its ultimate, absolute conclusion.  If we're not arguing about whose faith is right, then we're trying to argue that faith itself is wrong.<br /><br />A much better book in this vein is Sam Harris' \\"The End of Faith\\".  It presents arguments against blind faith which are much more thoughtful and well-reasoned than Dawkins' polemic.
B000BCKFWK|4.0|Everything was great, except that the product was a little damaged in shipping. It needs to be packaged better.

B00000G3I2|3.0|This well acted film is a great portrait of sterotypical 60s generation sell-outs who in their youth were a little bit concerned about things besides themselves. But the times, they-are-a-changin'. They \\"grew-up\\" and ended up caring only about themsleves and material gain(of coarse) which is what adulthood means to most Americans. They lived through the 60s, their youthful idealism and naivete, on into the 1980s to become yuppies and narcissists. The only truly decent character is already dead at the beginning of the film and his funeral is what brings these old friends together while at the same time being an obvious symbol that, in a way, what was best about them is now dead. This film stands along with a handful of other films as a particularly instructive document of the so-called baby boomer generation and American culture at the late end of the 20th century.
B0001VV1GK|5.0|I just bought this for my 2.5 year old who loves anything with wheels. He had the Fisher Price garage, and just seemed bored with it. I found the Plan City line after buying the forklift and firetruck made for Pottery Barn Kids by Plan Toys. Everything so far seems very durable, safe and has kept my son VERY busy! Not to mention, there are so many things to add to the Plan City, so I feel it's something to \\"grow\\" with! We love it! Only problem with it is that my son woke up at 5:00AM...wide awake saying he wanted to play with his parking garage!
B0018RWD1S|5.0|You have to acknowledge the TALENT that Amy Winehouse has....This is an excellent album with an entire disc of unreleased material. She has a very unique , throwback style that is completely modern , yet pays homage to the female artists that came before her. Although I don't agree with her much publicized antics , she is one VERY talented artist...I just hopes she stays around for many future releases
B000A6T262|4.0|I read a dozen reviews before I bought this set. I won't go into the good and bad of each movie. They're all good in their own way. If you have any interest at all in Star Trek, it's simply great fun to watch them in succession. I've made it through the first eight and none had any defects. I have yet to explore the special features DVD's but I suspect they will be loaded with interesting and fun extra info.    The only bad I must agree with is the packaging. The outer box graphics are simple, but nice. Unfortunately, the box is too light weight. After all, there's 10 double wide DVD boxes to hold together here. The individual boxes are well made but the lack of booklets is somewhat disappointing too.    Overall I'm very happy to own this set and glad it was even available. Can't beat the price either (it was 150$ at the ST Experience in Vegas).
B0018QCXGY|5.0|Well this is a love it or hate type film. If you have ever had a nightmare about some large creature chasing you in some environment, I think the film will appeal too you. It captures the essence of the type of nightmare quite well. It's a new take on an unexplained creature ravaging a city in panic.   I was pleasantly caught of guard by the high quality special effects, which only enhanced the overall feeling of the movie.
B00005JLCI|5.0|The most powerful rendition of our beloved Hamlet and the most usable format for the classroom!  Teaching three different classes and being able to cue up to the spot we left off sets the most organized tone!  Anyone need copies of VHS versions?
B000NQRE0K|5.0|As the title says, this is the best movie ever made. I'm weak for big-scale action movies, however Braveheart is not just that. This movie contains outstanding acting, tantalizing plots, exhilirating action sequences, along with everything else you could possibly want from a movie. Considering when this movie was made, it is obviously far ahead of it's own time, with competition recently starting to surface, yet still fall short.
0452289963|5.0|Excellent, excellent, excellent.  I have recommended this book to so many people, and they have all raved about it.  There is a shift that happens when one is open while reading this book.
B00076ZZ9I|5.0|I really don't understand how anyone can give this classic album on DualDisc a one star review.Granted,the audio may not be up to their exacting standards,but that's just nitpicking.Real fans of this album and this group will be glad to see the bonus video footage on the DVD side.I know I was.
B00008972S|4.0|This Collector's Set is a real treat for fans of this very well made film.  Included in the set is a great book containing the entire screenplay which I had fun following along reading while I watched the movie.  This book also has a forward written by none other than the scriptwriter himself, Ernest Lehman.  In addition, the book also contains write ups about the making of the film plus biographies of the main actors and directors as well as other key contributors such as composer Leonard Bernstein.  Famous for his Beethoven, Brahms and Stravinsky cycles, people tend to forget that Bernstein was a very good composer in his own right; this is shown here in his inspired work together with lyricist Stephen Sondheim producing some of the most memorable songs such as \\"America\\", \\"Tonight\\" and \\"Maria\\".<br /><br />Finally, a Collector's Set with something truly worth collecting!  The bonus disc contains very nice documentaries on how the film was made with excellent interviews of the cast and crew as well.  Although the picture quality isn't perfect as there are still a few frames here and there with white spots and other imperfections thankfully these are not too frequent and hence do not take away too much from the overall enjoyment of the film.  The sound quality is excellent and comes in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround sound.<br /><br />This film is that rare musical that has excellent music and choreography as well as a good storyline.  Many musicals tend to be unbalanced in that they are stronger in one over the other.  \\"Oklahoma\\" for example has great music but a weaker storyline and it's the same with say \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" but \\"West Side Story\\" is very well balanced with great drama in what is essentially Shakespeare's \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" retold in a modern setting as well as brilliant dance and song sequences.  Although the singing has been overdubbed by \\"better\\" singers the overall acting of the cast and especially that of Natalie Wood is first class.<br /><br />This is one Collector's set to shout about and is certainly value for money.  Highly recommended!'s set to shout about and is certainly value for money.  Highly recommended!
B000ZLFALI|4.0|Stellar!  I absolutely love this movie.  The music is amazing (despite it being all covers of the Beatles, it is done very well, often bringing a new, refreshing light to the music).  The acting is extremely believable (\\"oh yeah, they're acting!\\").  Very well thought out script and characters.  Good mix of romance, drama, action, etc.  I highly recommend this to young Beatles fans, but it still has a lot of merit for those who have never even heard of the Beatles (if there are such people).
0783225857|4.0|Having read the book twice and now watching the film, it's nice to see that the film has actually done justice to the book in that it's successful in bringing out the actual message of innocence lost and about the difference between right and wrong, good and evil as seen from the point of view of 3 children and specifically the little girl Scout.  People tend to hate and seek to destroy that which they don't understand just because it scares them and the children learn at the end that the best way to overcome this fear is to face it head on and to seek to learn and understand rather than to judge and destroy.  At the end, this is what Scout does as she befriends the feared Boo who saves her brother's life.  We all naturally love to support the underdog and this film tells the story of Atticus fighting for justice and teaching his kids as he does so by his actions as well as his words.<br /><br />This dvd has an excellent documentary about the film as well as good interviews with the cast and crew as they look back at their experiences while making the film.  The picture quality is okay but not perfect and could do with another restoration job although the 2-channel mono sound quality is okay but a 5.1 surround option would have been much appreciated.  Overall, this is a well-crafted film with excellent acting and an excellent screenplay.<br /><br />Recommended.
0738702994|5.0|The rich imagery of this deck by Anna-Marie Ferguson provides for striking insight into many situations and questions.  I have owned these cards for about a year, with much success.<br /><br />Bordered by soothing sage green (as are all the cards), the majors are each identified with a subject from Welsh mythology, who is portrayed on the card.  The minors are fully illistrated with thoughtful renderings, which I always like to see.  The (not quite reversible) backs are done in a rich, warm brown with gold diamonds and a red and gold compass in the center, featuring a winged dragon.  As well, there's a beautiful, beaded, brocade draw-string bag included that's a nice addition to the package. (And the cards fan out really nice; silly, I know, but I like to do it and it's something any product by US Games won't do.)<br /><br />The excellent \\"Tarot Companion\\" gives a solid grounding in Tarot, as well as providing the mythology behind each of the characters portrayed in the majors, and comments for each of the minors.  This companion book gives, as well as the Celtic Cross, a spread previously unknown to me called the \\"Horseshoe Spread.\\"  Included in the deck are cards portraying two other new spreads called the \\"Red Dragon Spread, to overcome an obstacle,\\" and \\"Llew's Spread, to illuminate a situation.\\"  I have found working with all three of these spreads to be insightful.<br /><br />The Moon (Lake of the Maidens), The Universe (Cadair Idris), and the Eight of Cups especially speak to me.  I am intrigued by the cool colors, full moons, indigo skies, and calm waters of these three cards.  I'm sure you'll find cards within this deck that speak to you, too.  This deck would be an excellent beginner's deck as it's grounded in the RWS tradition, but with the added depth provided by the Welsh mythology, it will provide insightful readings for the more experienced as well.
B00003CXB2|5.0|This film defies description as it needs to be seen to be believed!  Everything about it is magical and if you thought director David Lean's work on \\"Bridge Over the River Kwai\\" was good \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" even surpasses that great work handily and is his crowning achievement in an excellent career of films.  The cast is brilliant, the screenplay excellent, the camerawork inspired making this a film fully deserving of its 7 Oscars and like a true classic never shows its age making for a thoroughly enjoyable viewing experience and greatly rewards repeated viewing.<br /><br />This Collector's 2-disc version is also a treat as it comes with good making-of documentaries and the picture quality is excellent.  The sound quality in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround is also first class.  I really like the sand-coloured cloth covering of the dvd case as well as the full-colour 12-page booklet.<br /><br />No movie-lover can go without having this film in their library and this is a must see for all film buffs.  Great film, great dvd version makes this highly recommended.  I can only imagine how much better the Blu-ray version will be and I wait with bated breath!
B000I2MRHE|2.0|I liked the piece of equipment,but the baby was a bit too old for it - 5 mos.  I'm not sure a baby younger than that would do much with the product.  Suggest they make it a bit larger, so larger babies can use.  Good to develop upper body strength.
0316143472|4.0|A very enjoyable read, with a couple of pieces that may be among Sedaris' very best.  It does however, feel like there are couple of essays that should have been left out of this collection-pieces that did not add to the book as a whole, or seemed too similar to each other.  I do think that \\"Solution to Saturday's Puzzle\\" is one of the great pieces of humorous writing, up on a level with Wodehouse's \\"Clicking of Cuthbert,\\" which it resembles in almost no way.  Frankly, the book is worth it for the giggles and guffaws to be found in that story alone, the rest of the collection is icing on the literary cake (though perhaps occasionally spread a bit too thick).<br />Buy this book and enjoy the sharp hilarity of our dreary lives...and if you like it, you might want to try Marc Acito's new novel.  He's another one of our wittiest writers.
B00007KWHG|5.0|This is a very good CD. After seeing a performance of Jersey Boys, I was going to buy there \\"Original Broadway Cast Recording\\" CD. I listened to clips of \\"Jersey Boys\\" and clips of this CD. I bought \\"Very Best of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons\\" because they sounded better to me. After all, they had the real sound. There was a reason this music dominated the juke boxes.
0670018651|5.0|This is a delightful and truly fascinating book.  My husband and I took turns reading it aloud  (he said, \\"It's like wine, isn't it?\\") and it even got him interested in one of the five-star Masterpiece feminines-to-be-worn-as-masculines. The idea of smelling like a Vietnamese beef-mint salad (\\"Diorella\\") is just too appealing for him... Myself, I'm tickled by the fact that \\"Stetson\\" is a heady feminine floral oriental  (in a box bearing a photo of a rumpled Tom Brady in shearling) and \\"Anais Anais\\" (pitched to lissome teenage girls in the late '70's) is dry enough to be a suitable masculine. Turin and Sanchez's enthusiasm for this little-explored subject is contagious and they are not total snobs -- they like \\"Vanilla Fields\\" better than \\"Lalique\\", \\"Lady Stetson\\" better than \\"Chanel No. 22,\\"  \\"Old Spice\\" better than \\"Polo Black.\\" Their writing is witty, erudite, and downright Nabokovian when they are sufficiently moved to wax eloquent about a Masterpiece. Be prepared to take an immediate trip to the mall (as I did, bearing a little notepad with all the interesting scents with pithy tags like \\"hot rubber\\" and \\"cilantro floral\\") and get a headache from sniffin' all the stuff. This book made me seek out scents from the past that I would have otherwise avoided, like Estee Lauder's \\"Knowing\\", Dior's \\"Dune\\",  and Clinique's \\"Aromatic Elixer\\" (all 80's Masterpieces which deserve a second chance), and venture into the new world of  artisanal fragrance.  I ended up exchanging phone numbers with the perfume lady at Barney's after an intense 20 minute powwow with Le Labo and Lutens.  And at Neiman's, I experienced the divine confluence of Chanel's \\"Cuir De Russie\\" on my right arm and Serge Luten's \\"Five O'Clock Au Gingembre\\" on my left, both of which lingered deliciously all night long.  What fun! And I'm someone who formerly was fine with a drop or two of lavender oil here and there... My only complaints are for the lack of a proper index and I'd like to know what these guys think of the popular thing of mixing and layering different scents (such as a client of mine who smelled like a luxurious Lutens-something which was the result of \\"CK One\\" and patchouli oil *yikes!*).

B000LW7OWE|1.0|this movie is hogwash. oliver stone blew it with this one.With subject matter as the doors a really good film could have been made. its filled wth inaccurate information ie jim didnt quit film school stone did! the surviving Doors in documentaries state that stone missed the boat, morrison had addictions he also was talented but by the look of this film you would never be able to tell. Val kilmer does look and sound alittle like jim morrison but he never seems to let us want to  care anything about him or his art.the movie is a mixed up mess \\"IS EVERYBODY IN\\" Gee i hope not!

B000OCZETQ|5.0|An incredible mystery/fantasy that draws you in from the very beginning.  I traveled from deep despair to wonderous joy in this realistic fantasy tale with the fight between good and evil, a lost soul and redemption. What great visualizations the words created. I look forward to seeing and reading the Chronicles of Narnia, Prince Caspian, Book 2.
B0009S5AEE|1.0|This book is a waste of money.  It is a collection of emails that David sent to his subscribers and repackaged in book form.  Just stick with the original book, \\"Getting Things Done\\"; you don't need the sequel.    [[ASIN:0142000280 Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity]]

B00004VVN9|5.0|Just a wonderful story of true love, discovery, faith. Story line was great. Acting superb with actors such as Chrisopher Walken, Natalie Wood, and Louise Fletcher. A high tech visual experience. I truely enjoyed the film and recommend it to anyone.
B00008972S|5.0|Although I am in my mid-30's, I grew up watching a lot of musicals thanks to my mom. It wasn't a Saturday afternoon matin&eacute;e at home unless a musical was on tv. That being said, this is one of my favorite musicals of all time, along with South Pacific and An American In Paris.<br /><br />I have owned the VHS (and the soundtrack), but this is the best version available that I have seen. I bought this boxed set shortly after it was released and have watched it over and over. The color is beautiful, the bonus disc will make any WSS fan smile and the accompanying book has tons of photos and the screenplay.<br /><br />Simply fantastic.

B00003CX9Q|5.0|-This review pertains to the .[[ASIN:B00003CX9Q E.T. - The Extra-Terrestrial (Widescreen Collector's Edition)]]and the [[ASIN:B000069AT7 E.T. - The Extra-Terrestrial (Ultimate Gift Boxed Set)]]*-    E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial is in all likelihood the most personal film that Steven Spielberg has directed. It gives insight into the director's life experiences and his childhood in particular. For the most part the film is shown through the eyes of a child. It captures a certain sense of innocence and wonderment that was rare in films of the early 1980s. It's also startlingly honest in its portrayal of children growing up in contemporary America. Rarely do films give a truthful account of what the social behavior of children is really like. These children playfully torment one another, they swear and most importantly they aren't always good to each other. As a child, I recognized this and I still find it intriguing that one of the most accurate views of childhood should be found within a science fiction film. No wonder the story still touches people today.    The story concerns an alien (who happens to be a botanist) that is stranded on Earth. Government agents pursue him so he retreats into the vast forests of Northern California. One night a ten-year-old boy named Elliott sees him. Soon the two become friends and a symbiotic bond is formed. E.T., as the alien is dubbed, comes from a distant planet where his species experience reality through a collective conscious. Without his species he cannot emote, maintain physical health and therefore his life is endangered. But miraculously a link is formed between E.T. and Elliott, and this keeps him alive. E.T. feels Elliott's pain and distress, both emotional and physical, and responds to it. Now Elliott shares E.T.'s emotions, which further complicates his life. In one memorable sequence, E.T. discovers beer and becomes drunk causing Elliott to act in an intoxicated manner while at school. Soon the link between them strengthens and neither of them can sustain themselves. In order for either of them to survive E.T. must be reunited with his own species. All during this time the only other people to have seen E.T. are Elliott's siblings and a mysterious man who is only known as Keys. Elliott must learn to rely on his older brother, Michael and his younger sister, Gertie to keep his secret. On Halloween night, they manage to sneak E.T. out of the house, and Elliott and E.T. embark on an amazing journey through the forest. Deep within the forest, E.T. constructs a communication device out of mundane household items and attempts to contact the other aliens. When Elliott wakes up the following morning E.T. has vanished. Elliott returns home to find his mother panicked about his disappearance. His older brother, Michael searches for E.T. and finds him, half dead in the river and proceeds to bring him back home. Only then do the children reveal E.T.'s presence to their mother. But before she can absorb the shock government agents, dressed in space suits and armed with guns, break into their home. Meanwhile E.T. and Elliott grow weaker. And the only hope for their mutual survival is for E.T. to return to his home planet.    The film is something of an emotional roller coaster ride and its climactic bicycle chase is breathtaking. By the time the end credits have started you'll either have tears in your eyes or you'll be too exhausted to absorb the film's impact.  Much has already been said about the film's artistic and technical merits, so I won't go into great detail about the brilliance of the acting, the production design, John William's wonderful score, Melissa Mathison's script or Spielberg's direction. But I will say that they all deserve credit for this wonderful film. E.T. is truly a modern classic!    * The original 1982 widescreen theatrical version of E.T. isn't easy to find. It's only available in two expensive sets, both of which I recommend. Currently both of those DVD editions areunavailable here on Amazon.com, but they can be found in some novelty and collector shops. Hopefully when Universal releases this title in the future they'll include the original version as well as the 20th Anniversary edition.
B00006AFUR|5.0|I admit it - I've been listening to this album almost non-stop for the past five days. It is honestly one of the most engaging pop/alternative albums I've heard in a long time.<br /><br />You won't find standout players here who strut their stuff as much as a band that works together and works well. No solos, no crazy breakouts, but a cohesive melodic and harmonic structure that shows a great deal of prowess. The tempo changes and progressive song structuring is something I'd expect from much more experienced bands, and in particular the multiple bridges in songs that flow seamlessly from section to section are very well-done. You will not get bored listening to a repetitive under-rhythm here.<br /><br />The songs vary in tempo and feel in such a way that the entire album just works. \\"Oblivion\\" and \\"The Mission\\" are the catchiest and so high-energy they're almost danceable. \\"Capricorn\\", \\"Edge of the Earth\\" and \\"Echelon\\" offer impressive displays of tempo changes and ethereal guitar work. \\"Buddha for Mary\\" is just bizarre, but somehow I like it. \\"Fallen\\", \\"Welcome to the Universe\\" and \\"93 Million Miles\\" are on the darker side, but still well-composed.<br /><br />The part of myself that has followed Sevendust since their roaring eponymous debut screams that I'm just a poser for listening to pretty-boy Jared Leto's screams, groans and layered crescendos. The rest of me is too busy dancing to half the tracks to care.<br /><br />True headbangers will despise 30STM as too poppy, too out there, too synth. Pop fans will wonder what the deuce Jared is singing about - \\"what's with the fascination with the echelon\\" and \\"into the wild...I'm with the mission over the hill, come here with me\\". In both of these, I think the band succeeds in conveying its own message, its own feeling, its own conceptualization, and leaves it open to the listener to discover. The lyrics take the listener far down the ladder into meteoric metaphors of primal territory, and are as atmospheric as most sci-fi epochs.<br /><br />This one isn't for the headbangers or the divas. It's for us geeks, and I'm proud to accept.'t for the headbangers or the divas. It's for us geeks, and I'm proud to accept.
0804115613|4.0|Fried Green Tomatoes by Fannie Flagg was not only insightful for me, but inspired me to live my life to the fullest.  I do believe that this could very well be the most inspiring book I have ever read.  This novel has multiple stories going on at one time, giving the reader different points of views.  It starts in a nursing home, with a daughter in law that is not so exited to see her mother in law every weekend.  She stumbles upon an old woman by the name of Mrs. Threadgoode, who is eager to have someone to talk to, and starts to reveal the story of her younger life in Whistle Stop, Alabama.  Intrigued with Mrs. Threadgoode's tales, Evelyn, the daughter in law comes to visit the Rose Terrace Nursing home on a regular basis.  Throughout all the visits, Mrs. Threadgoode helps Evelyn through many of life's challenges, including menopause.   One theme that I established from this fantastic novel was \\"There is a gem in every rock.\\".  Mrs. Threadgoode is a major example of this, the nursing home being the rock, and Mrs. Threadgoode being the gem.  Through listening to Mrs. Threadgoode's stories, Evelyn is able to conquer challenges in life such as sugary eating habits, and is able to set a foundation for a bright future.  Another theme I captured from this novel was to \\"treat everyone as an equal\\".  Idgie and Ruth, two of the main characters in this book, are in a homosexual relationship, though everyone in Whistle Stop treats them equally.  In today's world, I think this value is somewhat overlooked.  An additional example of this is when Idgie let's the homeless man work for her in the café, even though he doesn't appear to be the most charming and well kept human being.   Fannie Flagg characterized Idgie as a spunky, fun-loving woman who changed over time.  Towards the beginning of the story, Idgie is somewhat impulsive, wild and a little immature as shown when she runs off and proclaims love at the age of fifteen.  As Idgie grows, not only physically but emotionally, she becomes more understanding and blossoms into the sort of person that people come to for there problems, or look to, to brighten their day.  Another well developed character is Evelyn.  In the beginning, Evelyn is anxious, stressed and somewhat disturbed.  Mrs. Threadgoode teaches Evelyn to deal with her stress, making Evelyn more patient, and eager to take on life's challenges.     The point of view this novel was written from was third person omniscient.  This made the novel even more interesting because I was able to see the thoughts of all of the characters in every different story, clueing me in to the little hints leading to the main plot.  I believe Fannie Flagg uses this to give the reader the extra insight.   Over all, I enjoyed this book.  It offered an insight into the past which as a teen, I don't see much anymore.  This book was hard, and sometimes impossible to put down, and inspired me to re-think my morals and how I judge people.  I would highly suggest this book to women and girls high school aged and up for a page-turning, good time.
B0000DZ3EN|4.0|Going into this movie, do not expect a rehash of the original. This movie is intended to be truer to the spirit of the books than \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" was. The plot, in fact, is a combining of the stories from \\"The Marvelous Land of Oz\\" and \\"Ozma of Oz\\"--the second and third books in the series. Though some minor hat-tips were made to the original movie, making it a cursory sequel only.<br /><br />For instance, the Ruby Slippers in the first movie were Silver Slippers in the book. Here, they make reference to Dorothy using Ruby Slippers in her previous adventure out of deference to that movie.<br /><br />However, the books have much more of a dark, foreboding tone than the saccharine sweetness of the original movie. (Not too much, since they're still kid's books, but it is still there.) This one captures that feel much more than the original.<br /><br />If your kids are old enough to handle the slightly dark tone of this film (not too much, but still dark) they should easily fall in love with the imagination and the characters of this movie.
B00154GEFU|3.0|i'm used to at least a few faster and more melodic songs from 'asia'.  even if the theme is dark, the music made it listenable.  only the first song is worthy of 'asia'.    i understand that john went thru a lot of physical problems, but so have many of us.  i try and keep an 'upbeat' outlook and still discuss my moods.    miss josh

B000006045|5.0|The first four tracks on Mezzanine are masterpieces, probably the apotheosis of Trip-Hop.  Dark, dreamlike, beautiful, stunningly sculpted -- one senses the hundreds, even thousands of studio manhours that went into each song.  The rest of the album is brilliant as well, though the \\"comedown\\" tracks #5 & #11 might be skipped on repeat listenings.  Tracks #6-10 continue the greatness in different directions -- sometimes sly and funny, sometimes crunching rock.  Each song has an arc, which takes multiple listenings to understand.  This might be sounds repeated at the beginning that are layered upon, then layered upon again, until the whole things unwinds and you are left with the same sounds (the heavy thudding beat in \\"Angel,\\" the looped feedback in \\"Dissolved Girl\\") in a new context.  Songs unfold like dreams, with images and bits of narrative fading in and out.  Be sure to listen to this on a good stereo; Mezzanine uses the entire audio spectrum, including some very deep bass.  (E.g., at 1'30\\" into \\"Angel,\\" you should be alarmed at how the stygian bass is getting even louder...right before the \\"door-ajar\\" car sound which is the tolling bell of doom.)  This might be the most tightly controlled album I have heard.  Brilliant stuff.
B0015D3Z4O|4.0|Not as disco and fab as \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" but a fun dance c.d. nonetheless.  Very heavily Hip Hop produced, mostly in a good way.  (Exceptions: hip hop artists think uttering \\"Madonna\\" is an actual song lyric.  Also, am surprised that Madonna let this album sound so much like a Gwen Stefani solo album).  A few really strong pop songs.  I'd buy this again if my copy were to disappear.
B00006F2TV|5.0|This is another movie that made my 3 year old granddaughter very happy.  Thank you very much for it and the fast delivery.
0743298020|4.0|This was a strange book for me. When I was reading it, I couldn't put it down. But when I stepped away, I wasn't compelled to pick it back up. Because I do read quite often, I still finished it very quickly. I just found the paradox interesting.<br /><br />I found myself relating to Margaret with respect to her love of books. Even now, I can find myself staying up until 3am on a work night reading a book. What's a little sleep compared to a great book?<br /><br />Because I do read so much, I tend to see a lot of story lines coming.This story was nice because I couldn't even begin to imagine where things were going. And I loved that!
0525950079|5.0|I just finished this incredible book and am sorry that I did; it was like saying goodbye to family.  I have read all of Ken Follett's books, and this was unquestionably the best!!  He is a great writer, storyteller, and historian.  I have several favorite writers, but Mr. Follett has far outstripped them all.  I will not discuss any parts of this saga except to say that though I read \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" when it was first in print years ago, it is absolutely not necessary for the enjoyment of this marvelous book!  I also researched Follett's historical background, and he has precisely captured the period and the actual events.  THIS IS A MUST READ FOR ANYONE WHO LOVES TO ESCAPE INTO A GOOD BOOK!!!  I do not know how Mr. Follett does it.  BRAVO!
0385340567|2.0|I was thrilled when this book arrived, read over half in one sitting.  However, the feeling of Deja Vu was there from Reacher's arrival in Hope.  The plot bears alot of resemblance to Killing Floor.  I was very disappointed when I finished the book.  Really hope the next installment returns to the quality of earlier books.
078322611X|5.0|Every one should see this movie - If you have not, you are missing out on a very good well know and well done movie.  A good family movie! The newer DVD has bonus footage that tells why the movie is still going strong after nearly 10 years.

0375703764|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing. I would recommend it to anyone. Actually I wouldn't. It literally changed my life... It's moved me to feel things I've never felt before.  I find myself scared of the dark (I've never been scared of it) and the book has made me hyperventilate and everything has become so unusual to me. It's a great book, but it's more than just a book..

B0014Z4OQG|4.0|*** IMPORTANT MESSAGE ***<br />The origin of the Cloverfield monster is indeed hinted at,<br />during the  final scene of the film!!<br />The scene where the two main-characters are on the ferris wheel.<br />Before the camera pans to the girlfriend, it's shooting the ocean horizon,<br />If you look closely (of if your television is the size of a space-station) you'll notice a comet/meteorite/satelite/something crash into the ocean in the distance.<br />I've extensively debated the point of origin (space or the ocean)on the horror forums,<br />and so far all signs could point to either.<br />(I personally believe it came from space,<br />because scientificly, the ocean wouldnt make sense.)<br />Here's why I believe this:<br />1. A satelite/whatever only now disturbing something that huge is implausible,<br />as underwater eartquakes would have disturbed it millenia ago.<br />2. Any earth-based creature breathes either air or water, has either lungs or gils, not both,<br />and the creature from Cloverfield was clearly breathing air,<br />which implies that it would eventually have to surface for oxygen.<br />And something that huge would be nearly impossible to miss once it surfaced.<br />3. There would have to be multiple creatures, for activities like...I don't know...reproduction.<br />Making their presence all the more obvious.<br />4. Not to mention that EVERYTHING that comes from the ocean requires fins, while this creature was clearly walking around on giant legs, a trait common to land creatures.<br />5. An alien origin would nullify any earth-based logic.<br /><br />That being said:<br />The movie's characters are soo believable,<br />and you get so immersed in their initial conflict that you forget you're about to watch a monster flick.<br />The shaky handi-cam adds to the realism, as does the lack of creature footage.<br />You see it, but you only get a vague sense of what it looks like.<br />You do however get a much better sense of what the spider-like flea-creatures that come off the behemoth look like,<br />though again, you only get a vague sense of how their bites work.<br />The character that is bit, is quickly ushered away before you get to see the outcome of the obvious infection.<br />It was a really good monster flick, but it definitely felt incomplete.<br />I know there's gonna be 2 more movies from different angles,<br />and knowing that makes this one seem all the better.<br />But all in all, very enjoyable.<br /><br />MORAL OF THE STORY:<br />The bigger they are, the faster you should run!!how their bites work.  The character that is bit, is quickly ushered away before you get to see the outcome of the obvious infection.   It was a really good monster flick, but it definitely felt incomplete.  I know there's gonna be 2 more movies from different angles,  and knowing that makes this one seem all the better.  But all in all, very enjoyable.    MORAL OF THE STORY:  The bigger they are, the faster you should run!!
B00151HZME|5.0|This is one of the best albums I've heard in a long time. Here's a track-by-track review:<br /><br />1. \\"You, Appearing\\" is the quiet opener. It's slow, and other than the vocals, one can't really assess what the rest of the album is going to sound like. (B)<br />2. \\"Kim & Jessie\\" really sets the mood for most of the album. Here, you can really hear the new wave influences, with hints of Duran Duran here and there. (B)<br />3. \\"Skin of the Night\\" is the first ballad, sung by a female, in the album to make use of the new wave sound. A great guitar riff is played towards the end of the song. (A)<br />4. \\"Graveyard Girl\\" doesn't stray much from \\"Kim & Jessie,\\" except for the fact that there's a break in the middle where the girl talks. An excellent addition. (B)<br />5. The eight-minute \\"Coleurs\\" can actually be two songs in one. The way I describe it is it sounds like taking Depeche Mode and splashing it with Daft Punk. (A)<br />6. \\"Up!\\" sounds like an extension of \\"Skin of the Night.\\" It's another ballad and makes great use of synths to create the atmosphere of the song. (A)<br />7. \\"We Own the Sky\\" is \\"Teen Angst\\" slowed down. Again, synths create the atmosphere of the song, with bleeps later on in the song that sound like how rain should sound like when it drops onto something. (A)<br />8. \\"Highway of Endless Dreams\\" is the first soundtrack piece of the album. Most of the song consists of the riff found on \\"Skin of the Night\\" but is isolated and brought forward in all its glory. (A)<br />9. \\"Too Late\\" is a fitting signal that the album will end soon. It would fit well with Coldplay's ballads. (A)<br />10. \\"Dark Moves of Love\\" continues the sound of something that's going to come to an inevitable end. It's a bit faster and harder than the previous track, but still has an optimistic, but depressed, sound. It eventually becomes... (B)<br />11. ...\\"Midnight Souls Still Remain,\\" the most ambient track on the album. Unlike \\"Highway of Endless Dreams,\\" which could be played during the climax of a movie, this track would fit well on its end credits. A great ending track. (A)<br /><br />Although the entire album is noteworthy, the key tracks are:<br />\\"Skin of the Night\\"<br />\\"Graveyard Girl\\"<br />***\\"Coleurs\\"***<br />\\"We Own the Sky\\"d fit well on its end credits. A great ending track. (A)    Although the entire album is noteworthy, the key tracks are:  \\"Skin of the Night\\"  \\"Graveyard Girl\\"  ***\\"Coleurs\\"***  \\"We Own the Sky\\"

You cannot go wrong with this comprehensive tome.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|The Peppers did it. They created their best album yet. This is the first album in three years that I have been able to continusely listen to. The music is definitely mellower than past RHCP, but in my opinion, suits them better than anything they've ever done. All four of these guys are in their elements on this album. Frusciante's guitar playing is, while no Hendrix, definitely well-suited to the album, and he keeps up beautifully with anything handed to him. Flea is, as always, amazing. Chad Smith, while not a standout, fits into his rythyms and intracacies fine. Kiedis' voice, while not stunning, is the only voice that could work for these guys--I personally like his voice quite a bit. There are both standout gems on the album, and a few that could have been left out. To give you a taste of the music, I'll review a few select songs.  DANI CALIFORNIA--more mainstream than anything else on the album, except for maybe Snow. Definitely a good song. Number one most played on my iTunes. 9.5/10.  SNOW (HEY OH)--love, love, love the guitar riff at beginning. Overall, a great song with good lyrics, fantastic guitar (John shines on this one,) and Anthony's voice is VERY well suited to this one. 9.9/10.  HARD TO CONCENTRATE--melodic, beautiful. best lyrics on the album. This song isn't given enough credit. 9.2/10.  CHARLIE--Seriously, what on EARTH is this song about? I know Anthony said it was about someone's imagination or something, but come on. Sounds like drugs to me. Not a particularly good track. I still like it, but it was definitely skippable. 7.5/10.  IF--This song is...not a standout. The lyrics are very cute, and the music is alright...but nothing special. 6.9/10.    BUY THIS ALBUM.   It's seriously one of the best things I've heard in quite a while.
B0013D8LOU|5.0|Honestly, I often hate horror films. They have so many gross zombies and visuals these days that I hate watching most of them (especially \\"Jeepers Creepers\\"). But some of the best bloody horror films are so honorable that stay in my memory for the longest time.<br /><br />And, believe it or not, \\"Sweeney Todd\\" is that kind of horror film. It is my favorite movie of 2007. There's nothing better than watching Johnny Depp sing happy melodies while he cuts the throats of gentlemen and politicians. For some reason, it's so relieving to watch them die, because I really haven't liked too many politicians lately.<br /><br />Don't ask me why, but there's something hilarious about listening to Helena Bonham Carter sing about making meat pies out of the rich people walking on the street. It's gory to watch Depp slit their throats, but I enjoyed watching Depp's character, Sweeney Todd, and Mrs. Lovett make mince meat out of them. No, really. They make meat pies out of them.<br /><br />I hope I didn't scare you away with these gross details, because this is a great musical about rotten people. This is a great musical about rotten judicial officials with sexist attitudes. This is a great musical about the rotten people who dream obsessively of killing them. In this case, Sweeny, also known as Benjamin Barker, was unfairly accused of outrageous crimes. Judge Turpin raped his wife, and according to Mrs. Lovett, Benjamin's wife committed suicide. Now after his 15 years in prison, Barker is out for revenge against Judge Turpin, the man who punished him and killed his wife.<br /><br />This is also a dark comedy that takes a great twist when Mrs. Lovett convinces Todd to kill the rich hypocrites who make the poor beggars miserable. It's true that they shouldn't hoard all the money, but there's something outrageously wrong about actually killing them. Thankfully, \\"Sweeny Todd\\" is one of the few movies that enables viewers to watch the rich people get killed, with the grateful knowledge that this is just a movie (thank goodness).<br /><br />I'm not going to give away the ending either, but I will point out that there is a big surprise in the end about Sweeny Todd's wife that reveals many things.

B000127LW2|5.0|I have watched most of the Voyager series on broadcast tv, but watching it in order brings a new understanding to it all (I started watching voyager during the broadcast of the forth season).    The Caretaker sheds light on how they ended up on the other side of the galaxy and how they decided to join two crews into one starfleet crew and start thier long journey home. It was fun getting to know all of the crew's stories before ending up in the Delta Quadrant.    The Special Features are a blast to watch. Season one of voyager is a 'must have' for anyone who loves star trek.
B000065BPB|4.0|I have owned this product for about 9 months. I must say they have excellent sound quality, but require a powerful source. My iPod doesn't have enough juice to bring out the finer details these headphones can product, however 99% of the time I'm using them with my PC and a high quality music file.     I have read other reviews about the phones not being large enough for people with above average head sizes. I don't believe this is true. I have a large head (7 3/4 hat) and I can use these headphones after only extending them about 50% of their capacity. My only complaint is out of the box they tend to squeeze your skull. They require a bit of breaking in before they're comfortable to wear for extended periods of time.

0307265730|5.0|What a wonderful collection of stories, equal to her debut triumph and Pulitzer Prize winner, The Interpreter of Maladies. I was immersed in each story and felt connections to the various characters, despite the cultural differences.  There is so much in life that can be universally understood beyond ethnic, national and racial boundaries, and Lahiri communicates this beautifully.<br /><br />The first part of the book contains five separate short stories which all deal with similar themes.  All of the Bengali characters are involved in unconventional relationships, often marrying Americans despite their traditional parent's wishes.  The emphasis is the rift these relationships cause between the parents and their grown children who shirk the conservative lifestyle and culture of their parents.  But underneath it all, there still remains a sense of obligation to aging parents and a familial bond that transcends the younger generation's Americanism.<br /><br />The second part of the book is three related stories that could have easily been a novella.  It is the story of a Hema and Kaushik whose lives intersect at different periods over the years.  They first know each other as young children whose parents are close friends.  Then they are thrust back into each other's lives as teenagers, under uncomfortable and tragic circumstances.  Finally, decades later, they meet randomly in Rome and have a fleeting affair despite Hema's engagement. Theirs is a story full of remorse and what-could-have-been.  It is a sad but profound conclusion.  I loved the different voices Lahiri gave to these three stories, the first being told in first person by Hema, the second by Kaushik, and the final story of their last reunion in third person.  Brilliantly written and engaging.

B000FC2L1E|5.0|While working at a bookstore, I decided that I needed to read one sci-fi and one romance novel just to get a feel for the genre. I selected Diana Gabaldon's \\"Outlander\\" for the romance novel, and was absolutely captivated by her story and style. I devoured the first three books in less than six weeks--an amazing feat for me as a slow reader with sight impairments--and have started at least 200 people on these books since then. I've had exactly 2 negative reactions.    Voyager, as I said above, is my favorite of all the books so far. In the last 300 pages or so, Gabaldon's plot moves at breathtaking speed, tying up many ends. The conclusion is stunning. In a year when real time/distance travel is curtailed by high gasoline prices, the \\"Outlander\\" series--and \\"Voyager\\" in particular--is a mental escape of the first order. If you need some place to go on your \\"staycation,\\" I would strongly suggest Scotland in the mid-1700's, and a visit with Jamie and Clare Fraser. You won't be disappointed.
0452289963|2.0|First of all, I went into this with minimal expectations and solely because of Oprah. Now, I don't know what Oprah is on these days, but she has been making some embarrassing and ridiculous decisions of late, especially in endorsing the useless Dr. Phil (I cannot believe he still has work after that Britney Spears fiasco, of all things) or her tired 'Book Selections' (almost all of which have a troubled female character at the helm). Of late, she's been getting more preachy about spirituality and new-age living, and who wouldn't, if you have zillions in the bank and all the time in the world. I would love to build schools in Africa too, but I just don't have the cash for it.<br /><br />Meanwhile, her latest endorsement is for Eckhart Tolle, a somewhat sleazy (yes, sleazy) author who insists that he is 'enlightened' and 'fully conscious' at every single state or stage of life (he also insists that he is 'enlightened' during every waking moment, but then what about the times hes fast asleep? But I digress). Anyway, the entire book is pretty much a direct-to-video rip-off of the basic tenets of Buddhism. Now Buddhism, which is what I dabbled with when I was in my late teens, is a beautiful faith, but the beauty of it is that its' leader believed in renunciation and sacrifice, and did not state at every hour that he was 'enlightened' or 'had no ego'.<br /><br />Tolle is extremely egoistic. His massive ego, for one, comes to the fore at every single stage, simply because he is so obviously in love with himself and his 'enlightened soul' that its almost frightening. THIS is a spiritual work? Oprah, what are you on? How could you force-feed a nation such trite garbage? I would rather read the fictional works of Roger Zelazny than sit through this self-indulgent ode, because quite clearly, the message of this book is totally lost within the first twenty pages itself.<br /><br />Certain basic principles are true though - we need to move away from the 'I' and think of the 'Us', we need to creatively foster our souls through generosity, forgiveness, etc, but hey, we already knew all of this. The book promises to \\"Awaken you to your life's purpose\\", but instead seems like a count of the authors' highly selfish musings on life, while all the time reminding us that if we follow him, we will also become as 'enhanced' and 'spiritually awakened' as he.<br /><br />Heres the thing : A true leader or spiritual guru should NEVER claim to be 'fully enlightened' or 'in a state of higher consciousness all the time'. This is up to his followers to judge. If you don't believe in the entire guru-seeker system, then don't write such books. Tolle seems extremely vain and even somewhat desperate during the course of this book, and his 'handy hints' of 'moving up the spiritual ladder' are at best laughable.<br /><br />What is even more laughable, is that like the hideous \\"The Secret\\" from 2007, this will another massive seller due to the Oprah Effect. There are other, much better books, most notably by Deepak Chopra (who doesn't say \\"I, I, I\\" all the time) and his son Gotham Chopra. Or try reading the works of Sri Sri Ravi Shankar and the \\"Art of Living\\" Course. Eckhart Tolle is a soulless being, a shell of a man, a corporate-backed marketing machine with no respect or concern for the upliftment of humanity.

Mix all that up with Homeland Security, the Iraq War, neglect of disabled vets, and, amazingly, endtimes fanatics, and you have a well structured story that actually managed to surprise me.

B0015XHP4K|5.0|When I heard they were releasing these on Blu-Ray I wasn't exactly thrilled to be buying them again. I had bought First Blood on Blu-Ray when it first came out after I had rented it at a Blockbuster and was so impressed by the picture I had to buy it. I had seen First Blood in so many different versions including most of the standard DVD releases that I didn't think it possbile to look as good as it does on Blu-Ray. After that I decided I really wanted them all on High Definition but they hadn't announced plans to release the other 2 on Blu-Ray. So I bought the others on HD-DVD (french versions). Again the picture was quite a bit better than any standard DVD previously released but not quite as good as First Blood on Blu-Ray. When the trilogy was finally released on Blu-Ray I admit I was a little mad, I wished they had just released them all together in the first place and now buying the trilogy yet again on Blu-Ray would also mean I would have 2 versions of the same First Blood movie.<br />I found this set at Best Buy for $29.99 (someone had accidently put them in the wrong area but they honored the price). This was cheaper than buying Rambo: First Blood Part II and Rambo III individually so I bought the whole set.<br /><br />I am very glad I did though, the picture on the other 2 movies are just as good as on First Blood, and better than the HD-DVD versions I had bought. The sound is also much better than any other version I had. I would strongly suggest that if you are skeptical to just buy these, there is not a better version out there and believe me I know. I watched these with my girlfriend and even she was amazed at how good they looked and she is not picky about picture quality. The movies look like they were just filmed yesterday and not back in the 80's. There is very little grain or film artifacts in these either. One review I read said he didn't realize how much sweating there was in the Rambo: First Blood Part II until he actually saw it in High Definiton and I have to agree, it is so clear everything shows up and looks amazing. If you own a Blu-Ray player and love the Rambo series you owe it to yourself to buy these.e to agree, it is so clear everything shows up and looks amazing.

B000VFGQUC|5.0|Simply, Thin Lizzy remains a vastly underrated band & Live and Dangerous - when the title was originally issued on a double live album - is one of the best live sets from the 1970s, when such releases became very popular.<br /><br />And this package highlights the band in all its glory, on stage and delivering high-octane music to an appreciative audience. The DVD portion features a 1978 concert from the Rainbow Theatre, which is not the venue where the double live album was recorded. Phil Lynott (vocals, bass) keeps the joint rocking by seemingly feeding off the crowd's energy from the opening note to the closing chord.<br /><br />There is also the highly-acclaimed 1983 \\"Farewell\\" concert from the Regal Theatre, selections from appearances on Top of the Pops and interviews with band members Scott Gorham (guitar), Brian Robertson (guitar), Brian Downey (drums and percussion). The bonus CD is a treat, a 1975 concert from Derby College.<br /><br />This is a fantastic collection of outstanding performances from a band that defined the golden era of arena rock.

0765342294|4.0|I had always known that this particular series was very popular, but I honestly had no information about it (I didn't even know how old these books were until I read the introduction and copy write etc). So I was surprised when I learned that it was actually a very famous sci-fi rather than some odd, stereotypical modern-day repeat of the same formula that most writers seem to use today (again, another example of that I had no clue when this book came out). I read it, and found it to be a very engaging story that brilliantly combined elements of action and suspense with many classical allusions (the smallest and weakest ending up being the champion, as with the Biblical story of David, among a few others) as well as a very interesting look into human psychology that is so convincing that you have the motivation to go argue with some genius just because you felt that this book told you how too.    In a militaristic aspect, this book doesn't apply very strongly to todays military (with the exception of possibly the Navy and any form of an amphibian attack force thingy), as almost all \\"fights\\" occur in zero-g. In comparison, this book is like a \\"Life of Pi\\" except that instead of animals, you have 10-year-olds flying around shooting each other with lazers.    The only thing that prevents me from rating this novel a full 5/5 is that it isn't very emotionally satisfying. You can't feel any sort of joy for the charachters when they triumph or any sort of sympathy when they fail.    Other than that though, it's great.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|I have never ever read the book to this movie.  But this 2007 adaptation of the Austen novel actually motivated me to WANT to read the book....and read other Austen novels as well.  I've also seen the older 90s adaptation with Amanda Root but even though that film was good, it just didn't make me like the characters so much.  This newer version concentrated so much more on the two main characters and I caught myself skipping back to certain scenes just to watch it again.  *spoilers*  Especially the scene where Anne falls while crossing the stream and the first thing she sees hovering over her to help her was Wentworth.  And oh, this new Wentworth is so much more dreamier and what I would totally picture him to be!  When I do read the book, this is the Wentworth I want to picture in my mind.  hehe    Anyway, don't worry about how the movie compares with the book.  It can never compare I'm sure, so don't even bother.  But the movie on its own is a joy to watch and a great enjoyment.  It has definitely become one of my favorites.

0810994739|1.0|It dumb founds me that our society can give accolades to Diary of a Wimpy Kid, an embarrassing comic book.  It's hard to believe that an adult man actually put pen to paper with this drivel.  The book is full of whining, complaining, and disrespect.  It would be one thing if the main character Greg, were to have an epiphany, but unfortunately this does not happen.  When my wife asked my 8-year-old and 10-year-old son's, \\"If Greg were your brother would he get in trouble in our house for his behavior?\\".  Both unequivocally answered \\"YES\\".  When she asked \\"Would you like to have Greg for a brother?\\".  They both said, \\"NO!\\".      We're in a society where most young people going into the workforce, think they're doing us a favor because they showed up, and were giving five stars to a book that tells them that this mentality is OK.  In the messages to our youth today we see complete disrespect for oneself and everyone else around you, taking no responsibility for your behavior choices or the results of those choices, and generally teaching our children that foul mouths, lying, sarcasm, disrespect, whining, and complaining are all good things.  You give your kids to someone else to watch most of the day, unlimited access to the Internet, video games, and other mindless and divisive media like this book, feed them full of Red Bull, Diet Coke, fast food, and frozen food, and you wonder why your children are such behavior problems. Does anyone understand the concept of raising their children?  Does anyone understand critical thinking?     As a Cubmaster, baseball coach, and father of four boys, who range in age from young elementary school through late high school, all of whom read at four to six grades above their age level, are physically fit, spiritually grounded, excellent students, and respectful young men, with my oldest soon to be an Eagle Scout, I can tell you that the youth of today need far better guidance than they're getting, especially much better scrutiny by their parents of what goes into their bodies and minds.    Mr. Kinney, I find it deplorable that you want to jump on the bandwagon of encouraging this type of behavior in our youth and mentality in our society.  To some this may seem like a harmless little book, but to me, The Diary of a Wimpy Kid series, and many other books like it, serve as an indictment of our society for the moronic, disrespectful, self-centered level it has now stooped to.  The intent of reading is to develop the mind.   Instead, we're pushing for everything in our society to remain at a mere fourth-grade mentality level.  I guess that's why they knew \\"Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader\\" would be such a success, because evidently, most of our society isn't.  How sad.
B0018RBN8C|5.0|What is it with the UK and putting out great soulful singers. While I've seen the inevitable comparisons to Amy Winehouse in some on line reviews, I think Duffy has the chance to have a longer lasting career belting out tunes.<br /><br />So far my favorite track is \\"Mercy.\\" My other two favorite tracks would have to be \\"Warwick Avenue,\\" and \\"Syrup & Honey.\\" While there's not a bad track on the album, I would have to say my least favorite songs would have to be \\"Serious,\\" and \\"Delayed Devotion.\\"<br /><br />I think the main thing Duffy has going for her, is that she has the potential to have real cross generational appeal. She is a singer I could easily recommend to my mom. She leaves all the cursing out of her songs that seem to be rampant in Amy Winehouse's songs. Don't get me wrong, I love Amy, but I wouldn't feel too comfortable recommending her to my mom, who's tastes seem to run along the \\"cleaner\\" lines of lyrics.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|I first got this disc from Netflix and only got about halfway through when I paused my DVD player and turned to my computer to order it.  When I got back, I found that the movie just kept getting better.  This movie would be worth seven stars if they were available.  Julie Taymor alone deserves Eight stars just for her work here. This movie absolutely captures the combination of heartbreak and wonder that was the sixties.  In this movie, she achieves what the makers of \\"Hair\\" tried to do.  While we're at it, seven stars apiece for the performers - all of them.  I almost said actors, but these people not only gave masterful acting performances, but did so while singing and dancing to top professional levels.  This ensemble took a group of (by now) old songs, and reworked them into something new and exciting. I was aware that changes had been made in the songs, but the changes made them fit so well into the story that it gave them a new meaning beyond what the Beatles had originally intended.  Special notice should be given to the draft board scene.  Originally the song \\"I Want You/She's so heavy\\" was probably about some horny guy fantasizing about a sexy woman. In this scene it creates a picture of the dehumanization that every poor slob that got drafted in that era went through.  (The real sergeants weren't such good dancers, but they were just as brutal and uncaring.) Then it segues into a supreme denunciation of our purposes for fighting in Vietnam.  Totally brilliant.  Then there is Joe Cockers version of \\"Come Together\\".  I never cared for Joe Cocker in the Sixties, but my respect has grown since then, and in this cameo, he shows himself for the master performer he is.    For those who were lucky enough to have missed the sixties, I would say, \\"Watch this movie.\\"  Too many depictions of the sixties tend to show it as a time of wild, crazy, \\"happy times\\".  What this movie shows is how the drugs, the runaways, the \\"Happenings\\", the communes, the pursuit of exoticreligions, and all the other craziness was caused by a need to find a way out of the horror that surrounded us.  There were, as this movie shows, rioting in the streets of every city, the bodies were coming home by the thousands, and a totally evil draft system made sure that the poor and working class suffered while the rich found exemption.  No place was really safe, so it was no wonder that many turned to drugs for escape.  For those who survived the sixties, be warned.  It will hit you from time to time on wounds you thought had healed, but the experience of the movie on the whole is so positive that it will be worth the occasional pain.  To those who say that the time of the big movie musical is over, I say, \\"watch this One, the musical is alive and kicking high.\\"
075640407X|5.0|I'll make this review short and sweet.  I opened the book and from the first chapter I was hooked.  I have never in my life loved a book like I did this one.

I started reading this book after I ran out of Harry Potter books, poor little Harry Potter cannot hold a candle to Kvothe and his misfortunes in life!
B00139W3NE|2.0|And to think there's supposed to be 2 more of these movies. I have to agree with other reviewers who found that character development was out of touch here and pretty much void throughout the entire movie. New characters appear out of the blue and nothing is known about them but they end up being an integral part of the story which really cheats the viewer. It's also too fast paced at times to know what is going on or what the story is actually about. I think there is a rush in Hollywood to make Fantasy adaptations yet they have no idea how to keep it equal to the novel or the series. Hollywood is too anxious to make the next series of LOTR's or Harry Potter's that they are hardly putting any work into the storylines or CGI to make it interesting at all. This movie is full of so many gaps that it does the novels extreme injustice. A fantasy-based movie like this should not be under 2 hours if you're trying to encompass a huge story as The Golden Compass is supposed to be. And if it was going to be over 2 hours, at least make it more interesting. The story is boring and quite confusing throughout even for this avid Sci-Fi/Fantasy reader. 2 stars
B000E5N62U|5.0|Donald Fagen never disappoints. My only gripe with this album is the vocals on Great Pagoda of Funn, where DF appears to be competing with Michael Bolton in the blood-vessel-bursting stakes - tho the effect here is more emphysemic than priapic.  The truly bizarre harmonies and dry lyrics make up for it tho.  Any one know why Funn with two N's?
0800141660|5.0|This movie was well done. I loved the beautiful scenes of the English countryside, they made it feel as though you were there. The chemistry between all the actors was very strong and every scene just flowed so naturally. They really did a gorgeous job on this movie I don't think you will be disappointed. I do want to recommend you read the book first, it's always a good tribute to the author, as well as to see what the author was trying to portray. Some other movie recommendations would be \\"Emma\\" with Paltrow, \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" both A&E and Knightley versions`, and I know this is not an Austen movie but I just want to throw it in \\"A Room with a View\\" such a great movie. As for books that are similar but not exactly like Austen, the authors would be Victoria Holt aka Jean Plaidy (Mistress of Mellyn for starters), E.M. Forester, Bronte sisters, and Philippa Gregory are all very entertaining reads.

Like Thriller from MJ, or Raising Hell from RunDMC, or Ten from Pearl Jam, or a bunch of Beatles albums, etc, etc , my list is loooong...This Paul Simon album just has to be amongst your favorites, it is a feast for the ears. Get yourself a really good system to play it on, heck if that means you have to sit in your Harman Kardon equipped car with the windows shut, seat back, eyes closed and the engine idling, in your driveway, then so be it!!

B0013D8LCW|5.0|.........Some \\"Childhood Fantasies\\" can come true ) (alternate review title).  Oh, and.....how about even a 2d alternate title:  \\"Who do YOU think was holding that Video Recorder?\\"     ((Here is my approach to obtaining/viewing/reviewing Gay tales in film form (you could see it as seeking the holy grail of that genre, or as looking for the \\"Addictive Film\\"---that movie one returns to time and again). Selection and purchase of a film to view is based mainly on finding new releases by favorite directors/screenwriters and/or on comments/reviews by others of you at major online sites. Re the latter, sometimes I feel correctly steered by you (the \\"Keepers\\" filling my DVD shelves), other times mislead, occasionally badly (the \\"Throwaways\\"----and I do toss 'em). Rarely, I come across the \\"Addictive,\\" those I can re-watch at least every couple of months or so (see below starred *** area for a list......and for some of the \\"near-Addictive\\" as well). For some movies, I'll share a full review with you, as follows for this film. Thanks for sticking with me so far.))     As a preface to all this, I'm not interested in telling the story here; I'm into telling 'about' the story here. And that's easy because the gay relationship part of it is one of the best on film and DVD today.     First off, it's got to be said that, whether one's straight or gay (except for those already \\"out\\"), putting yourself \\"out there\\" for this type role has got to be an extremely difficult decision. Why? Because people in our backward and selectively puritanical society are going to make assumptions about you for doing so---whether they be correct or incorrect. Bearing this in mind, Director Markowitz was surprisingly fortunate in obtaining the acting services of both a Trevor Wright and a Brad Rowe. And whether taking these roles was good for their careers, both actors absolutely shine in this production.......as used to be said: these guys got Chemistry. There's a naturalness, a comfortableness between the two that's seldom been achieved in other gay romances set to film.     Also, big kudos to this director for being able to elicit/draw out such intimately physical scenes between our two leads. Kissing, especially, comes across as unforced, unrushed (except when they're \\"hot\\") and completely enjoyed by the characters (even if and when \\"tongue\\" might be involved). I'd call this kind of \\"acting\\" going above and beyond. Would that every American, gay romance director achieve this same degree of natural intimacy on the part of male couples; very few have. In my opinion, only French director, Christian Faure, in his 2000 French production, \\"Just A Question Of Love\\" ([[ASIN:B0008ENHXA Just a Question of Love]]) (or \\"Juste Une Question D'Amour\\" when looking it up on some other film websites), set the bar higher. Intimacy between the two in that film fairly crackles.     As for their individual performances:     -- Trevor Wright puts Zach across as the ultimate likable guy---one putting everyone else's needs before his own (whether they deserve it or not). He's the one often being put upon, yet he stays so positive.......no wonder that Shaun falls for him. He makes us all fall for him. And nowhere do we do so more than when, at the end of his most intimate scene, he and Shaun are lying happily face to face, and Trevor has brought Zach's expression to such a peacefully satisfied level that Shaun just has to say: \\"You're so beautiful\\" (and at that moment we can see he truly is). Then, our Zach can only shyly bring himself to wrinkle his nose and softly scoff: \\"Shut up.\\" What an endearing moment.     -- Re Brad Rowe: In preparing for this shoot and the extreme intimacy of some of the scenes, someone had to lead the way. I more than suspect that person was the older and much more film-experienced 'The Brad-ster.' This becomes apparent when you listen to the DVD Special Features Voice-over Commentary by Markowitz, Brad and Trevor, and conclude that Brad's comfortably easyand low key approach was just what was needed to pull character Zach (as well as newer performer, Trevor) out of any shell of fears and doubts he might be having. In the end, it is through Brad's Shaun that we see Zach being so very fortunate to have wound up with a loving/caring person who would remove him from the undesirable circumstances in which he lived.......and, importantly, get him into the advanced art schooling he so definitely deserved.     As concerns their \\"time-together\\" scenes and performances, it becomes obvious from listening to specific comments by Trevor and Brad in the Voice-over that they are quite proud of their work in the love-making scenes, particularly the really intimate moments. How often could we expect to hear non-gay actors express such thoughts---knowing everyone watching the video would hear them? Not often, I suspect.     And let's not forget about Director, Jonah Markowitz. It's obvious from watching this, his first-time feature film, that he has the chops to run with the big boys. Why? Because for any film to be successful, it is the \\"little touches\\" a director/scriptwriter worth his salt throws in that mean the difference in a memorable production and one that isn't. Take the exciting scene we all love where Zach returns to Shaun's house and, for all practical purposes, throws himself into Shaun's arms (and bed). Markowitz doesn't just shoot this happening; instead he gives us a very emotional lead-up scene of an agonizing Zach, pacing around his little art workspace and nervously knocking things about. Now, finally, he's fully admitted to himself who he is, sexually, and what kind of relationship he wants with the one who means the most to him. At this point, he's got our sympathies and has us worked up almost as much as himself......just waiting for that next step to be taken. It's then, in the very next scene, that we see Shaun heading for his front door and the person we know is anxiously waiting there. What happens next is:Wow!!  So you see, folks, this is how a really successful director does things.     Moving on to other considerations, not everything about the film works out so well for this reviewer. While Tina Holmes does a fine job with her role as Zach's sister, Jeanne, it is not her fault that her called-for and frequently whinny/naggy, oh-poor-me, onscreen time exceeds what otherwise would have made for a better film. We'd already quickly learned that it is Zach who is the real put upon one, whose life is being stolen. Better, by far, would have been less scenes involving her and more of involving Zach/Shaun's developing relationship.     And what's my favorite scene? Well I have to say that, other than those arousing \\"BGLM\\" shots (Dudes, ya just gotta learn what that means by taking in the DVD Voice-over feature), my fave is definitely that quiet, easy surfside stroll taken by Zach and Shaun, their arms comfortably bumping from time to time. They begin talking of writer Shaun's last book, a gay romance novel. And then, because of Zach's glowing remarks about having read the book, it starts becoming clear to us that it's becoming clear to Shaun that Zach clearly knows about and is comfortable with Shaun's, shall we say, big sexual proclivity in life. Then, it's, like, WHOA!!!......as it suddenly hits Shaun what just might lie ahead for the two of them. It's a perfect little scene.     A final thought involving an appropriate 'mantra' for this film.......which would be: {\\"Little by little, the 'Master' leads the 'Student' out---capitalize those 3 letters if you will---so he can be who he really is, and comfortably so\\"}.  That's really the journey on which this movie has taken us. (If you actually watch this film, the terms just now used will have so much more meaning).     P.S.---And, importantly, at the very end we've learned that, like fairytales, some \\"Childhood Fantasies\\" can also come true (here,again, if you listened well during the screening, you'll know what this means).     P.P.S.---If you've been wonder'n about this review's title), then all ya have to do to satisfy that itch is to grab a look and listen to the DVD Special Features section, wherein the Director + Brad + Trevor walk us through that 'first kiss' scene. Very enlightening.     P.P.P.S.---As to who was holding that Video Recorder (you know, the one that shot a little video titled:  \\"SKATE THIS! with GABE & ZACH,\\" showing a couple of early teenage skateboarders doin their thing) the answer would likely be a younger Shaun.  Then, it hits us:  isn't it interesting that an emotionally down and vulnerable Shaun---on the downspin from a difficult relationship breakup---finds his way back to that place of pleasanter times, that place of fonder connections, that place of.......Zach.  (We've already pretty much arrived at the conclusion that he hadn't come home to see his away-from-the-area parents, or a brother he'd been seeing from time to time, anyway).     ***This film is becoming \\"Addictive.\\" ***Other such habit formers: \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" / \\"Boy Culture\\" ([[ASIN:B000R7G9JW Boy Culture]]) / \\"All Over The Guy\\" ([[ASIN:B00005QAQD All Over the Guy]]) / \\"Second Skin\\" ([[ASIN:B000088UZ4 Second Skin (Unrated Version)]]) / \\"The Man I Love\\" ([[ASIN:B0000CBL9I The Man I Love]]) / \\"Latter Days\\" ([[ASIN:B0002I84JO Latter Days (Unrated Edition)]]).     ****
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|This was a great movie, the picture quality was amazing the intense action and the characters. I have a HDTV and when i watch this on it its amazing the picture is awsome and the surround sound. This was continuen from FF7 the game where it takes you futher into the story, i really like how much action and intensity was in this movie it was so cool, sword fighting, gun action, mid air combat, fast speed explosions, and fun fighting sequences to. This is how i like animation to be, iam really into action like this is its more fun and exiting. This was like so cool its amazing how the creators designed it and made it look so intense, and made the picture hi quality and its even better watching it on a HDTV cause of the effects and picture quality, so this was a awsome movie.
B0001MDP3G|5.0|I loved the book and found the movie just as good, which is unusual.  The Battle of the Crater [not in the book] is especially good--awful, really.  Confederate armies on the verge of defeat are blown to Hell by an underground mine.  Well-fed, well-trained Union soldiers advance into the breech only to be mowed down by the famished, desperate and shell-shocked survivors.  Courage beyond the bounds of courage.  The battle ends with mutilated Federal corpses piled up like cord wood...it's not a cinematic invention...it happened just this way.<br /><br />The rest of film is excellent, too, but certainly far from perfect.  The home guards, chasing down disgruntled soldiers and run away slaves, are just too evil for words.  As a matter of fact, they are just too evil for reality.  Slaves were valuable and deserting soldiers could still serve in the collapsing Confederate armies. Wholesale murder wasn't in the cards.  At the same time, a film needs villains but sometimes villainy is more effective if handled more delicately...with more subtlety.<br /><br />Still the film worked for me, especially the enormous tragedy of women--impoverished, grief-stricken women--waiting for men who would never return...waiting for men who would never again plough a field or make love to them again.  Multiply Ada by hundreds of thousands and we start to get a feel for the unfathomable tragedy that was the American Civil War.  620,000 men never came home...more than all the other American wars put together.  The South was especially devastated...most of her military aged men were dead or crippled while, simultaneously, the Federal Government exacted full revenge on the flattened South.<br /><br />Hey!  It \\"unified\\" the nation or was the nation's disunion just internalized?  By the way, I'm a Southernor and wasn't disturbed by \\"fake\\" accents.

B00003CXD5|5.0|I'm embarrassed to say that \\"Treasure of Sierra Madre\\" changed my life.  I saw it as a child and was enchanted by three American ex-pats kicking around in Mexico and searching for Mexican treasure.  By the age of 21 I was spending every other weekend in Baja and Sonora and did so for years.  Since then, I've spent a lot more time there, bought a home in Jalisco and am, even now, living directly on the Rio Grande in South Texas.  My interest in Mexico has culminated with my writing two novels, \\"Skull Rack\\" and \\"Hummingbird God\\" on the glorious, brutal, gold-plated Conquest of Mexico.<br /><br />None of these things speaks to the quality of the film itself but clearly this is one of the really great films.  In my opinion, it is very nearly perfect.  I only disagree with one part.  There is a cave-in and the Dobbs/Bogart character suffers some kind of head injury.  Afterwards, he shows signs of increasing paranoia terminating with theft, attempted murder and Dobbs' own death.<br /><br />I have no doubt that the film was deliberately scripted this way so that the viewer had alternative options for Dobbs' deteriorating behavior--brain injury or pure greed.  In that this is a story of greed, I would have ommitted the head injury.  Dobbs' behavior springs from the depths of his own darkening soul.  Other than that, the film is simply wonderful.<br /><br />We learn a lot of interesting things.  A down-and-out gringo can beg but he can't stoop to the level of a shoe-shine boy, otherwise his \\"goose is cooked.\\"  We learn that ordinary men are capable of murder when their financial interests are threatened and we learn that gold dust doesn't necessarily shine.<br /><br />The banditos are terrific.  I loved it when the one bandit tries to talk his way out of possessing a burro that belongs to somebody else.  I love the rough-and-ready Mexican justice and I love it when the condemned bandito--unawed or too stupid to fear his impending death--asks for a pause in his execution as he retrieves his battered sombrero blown off by the wind.<br /><br />I love it when the two gringos discover that their gold, which has been blown away by the same gusting wind, is gone forever.  They erupt into hysterical laughter.  After all, what the Hell else can they do?  Months of hope and back breaking labor shot to hell.  I love it all... especially the truth that the real Treasure of the Sierra Madre isn't the gold, at all.  It's the love that the Indians have for the old man.<br /><br />Ron Braithwaiteo blown off by the wind.

B00004U8P9|5.0|A biazarre film and a work of genius.  It pokes fun at virtually everything including old science fiction movies; horror movies; transvestites: homosexuals; incest; professional spokesmen; sexual innocence; UFO's; cannibalism and even Nazi Germany.<br /><br />Franknfurter, or  whatever his name is, has the qualities of a transvestite, bisexual Count Dracula and Dr. Frankenstein.  He's also an \\"evil\\" person who seduces both Brad an Janet.

Unfortunately, this blond superman is used for Frank's carnal purposes, another slap at Nazi theory.<br /><br />Anyway, it's all a lot of fun right up until the very end when the persecuted and  Igor-like Riff Raff, dressed like a rather extreme Flash Gordon character, and Magenta, with white streaked hair reminiscent of the \\"Bride of Frankenstein\\", show up to blast Frank and his one-time girl friend Columbia, with absolutely ridiculous ray guns.<br /><br />It's all unbelievably stupid which makes it a near perfect comedy.<br /><br />Now I have a question for all those who read my review.

B0017V7GLC|5.0|Let's examine the elements that make Velocifero one of 2008's most essential albums; densely layered electronic stanzas, haunting-yet-endearing vocals, infectious grooves and captivating hooks. While Ladytron's fourth album may be their most accessible to date, don't think that the Liverpool electronica  outfit have dumbed down their sound for mainstream acceptance. All the attributes of the band's previous work is again utilized on Velocifero to great effect. The album is affluent with the group's patent analog synth programming, subtly tinged with distortion and embellished with a healthy amount of bass, and the 13 tracks therein are enlivened by tactful melodies without being overtly poppy. Vocalist Mira Aroyo again delivers Bulgarian lyrics in a sultry monotone while co-frontwoman Helen Marnie's girlish vocals are as enamoring as ever. Moreover, Velocifero is abundant with memorable elements like the new-wave keyboard arpeggio which electrifies Black Car, the groove-laden bassline of Ghosts and the sweeping, dramatic ascent of Runaway. Driven by mystery, melody, and danceable beats, Velocifero has \\"Electronic Album of the Year\\" written all over it in bold letters.
B0015HOFZI|1.0|Can this be? No sound while the album is playing?    I got this unit yesterday and excitedly dropped what I was doing when it arrived.  Trouble is I CAN'T HEAR ANY SOUNDS FROM MY PC while the unit's USB cable is connected to my Dell / Windosw XP PC.    I called Sony support and spent about an hour with them on calls yesterday and today. The bottom line is that they say it's SUPPOSED to work this way. Even thought the manual for the included \\"Sound Forge Audio Studio LE\\" software indicates that one should be able to hear sound while recording!  Sony's attitude was pretty much \\"well, it's supposed to work that way, the manual is wrong, too bad.\\"    Another reviewer (R.McAnally) wrote:    \\"The software instructions in the manual     will lead you to select a \\"record\\" option     that will prevent you from hearing the audio     as you record it. This was a little annoying     until I found the \\"Vinyl Recording\\" feature.     If R. McAnally reads this and cares to comment more specifically about experiences hearing live sound, I'd LOVE it!    I was using this \\"Vinyl Recording and Resortation\\" tool in the software and even selected the \\"Monitor Input\\" selection and still no sound.    In my opinion, if I can't hear live sound from the album I'm recording, this product is worthless junk.  I'll be looking to ship this one back to the Amazon affiliate and start shopping for a decent unit!
B0010X73ZG|4.0|That's my question.  If you watch the movie and was faced with the same situation the main character faced at the ending what would you do?  Of course you have to see the movie to know what I mean.  The Mist is a wild movie that, at times, gets your heart racing and your goose bumps showing.  For a good part of the beginning you are left wondering, \\"What is in the mist?\\"  There were some parts that had me excited and wondering what's going to happen next.  The movie was good, and if you like horror flicks you will like this movie.
B000ZINGIK|5.0|I hated The Metal Opera, I love this. There really is a difference.    This album really surprised me, especially looking around on amazon where almost every metal album is rated 4 and a half or five stars, I was hesitant to pick this one up. However it's one of the best metal albums I've come across in a long time, in both song writing and pure emotion in each song. It is nothing like the metal opera, which I personally can't stand listening to. The 11 minute title track as well as \\"Master of Toys\\" with Alice Cooper make this album worthwhile alone. Really great and diverse song writing with great musicians and a sense of honesty and dedication from everyones performance. Truly great album.
B00104QSOM|4.0|This was a great movie.  The visuals were great.  The movie looked like they actually went back in time and recorded a piece of history, in color.

The movie was a bit long but well worth watching.  A must buy.
184195392X|5.0|Imagine losing your entire family to a freak-boat accident - mother, father and brother - only to find yourself stranded in the middle of the Pacific Ocean with a 450 lb. Bengal tiger and the bare essentials to survive.  Piscine Molitor Patel faced this reality when he and his family set out to Canada with many of the animals that his father, a zookeeper, cared for in a family-run zoo in India.  Life of Pi by Yann Martel plunges the reader into a seafaring story of adventure, survival, and most of all, self discovery as Pi Patel searches for not only a way to co-exist with Richard Parker, but also the intimidating thought of the meaning of life.     Yann Martel does an extraordinary job of placing the readers of all ages into the shoes of Pi Patel, a 16 year old boy, in his adventure and search for answers, especially in religious terms; at times, Pi even begs the readers to formulate his/her own answers, asking them: \\"What kind of god is that?  What is there to inspire in this son?\\" (56). Aside from the religious focus in this novel, there exists a very unique story of survival and coexistence with Richard Parker ad his own \\"Ark\\" of animals.  The awe-inspiring and detailed imagery Martel employs during Pi's own rendition of \\"Cast Away\\" (Tom Hanks) is yet another piece of evidence that proves this novel's award as Winner of the Man Booker Prize.     I would recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in both adventure/survival novels as well as religious-themed novels.  Yann Martel will have readers of all ages eager to turn page after page from start to finish and still wanting more.

B00007L4MJ|5.0|Fritz Lang created a utopia in which he did not believe. He ended his masterpiece film with a message which he thought hopeless in real society. Over thirty years after the film's completion, he stated in an interview how he envisioned Metropolis: \\"You cannot make a social-conscious picture in which you say that the intermediary between the hands and the brain is the heart - I mean that's a fairy tale - definitely. But I was very interested in machines.\\" Deeper meaning must lie beneath the surface of this quote, influenced no doubt by the turbulent social, political, and economic climates present in Weimar Germany at the time the film was made. It is impossible to believe that Metropolis was simply a project made by a hobbyist, signifying nothing - which is what a face-value interpretation of this statement would conjure. Lang was making an idealistic statement film - a message to the squabbling masses of how they should act rather than how they are acting. The art, politics, and economic status of German society all played a roll in influencing Metropolis.<br /><br />Art<br /><br />World War I marked the end to the first phase of expressionism typified by art groups Die Brucke and Der Blaue Reiter, and heralded in the comparatively new medium of film as an art form. Major players in the world film scene were beginning to appear in the wartime years of 1914-1918, not the least of which was Hollywood in 1914. Until then, studios had relatively little control over the motion picture industry, films instead being produced by independent artists with limited funds. During wartime, the power of the studio system grew rapidly as film began to take a firm hold on the world as a legitimate form of entertainment. Out of these burgeoning enterprises, the German studio UFA, Universum Film AG, would rise to prominence after its inception in 1917. With the end of the war and the adoption of the Weimar Republic, German artists were once again able to focus attention to their trade. German expressionist painters who were interrupted by the war came back to a world changed by technology. They quickly embraced the medium of film for their own, employing UFA as their main base of operations. Expressionist painting was still fashionable, but the style was giving way to the newer trend of Dadaism, the so-called \\"anti-art.\\" Film, however, was wide open. As an art form, film had not been explored by neither America nor Germany. Used mainly for escapist entertainment or newsreels, the moving image had hitherto not been used to express the deep emotions and subconscious layers of the human psyche as the canvas had. The Expressionists changed this. In 1919, Robert Wiene created Das Kabinett Des Doktor Caligari, which was more of a moving painting than anything that had come before. The Expressionists had created the world's first art film.<br />Lang's inspiration has roots in numerous historic events of the time period, as well as social changes and art forms - especially German Expressionism. Indeed, Metropolis is often considered the last silent German Expressionist film; ending a legacy which began with Caligari, and continued on through Nosferatu: Ein Symphonie Des Grauens, Der Mude Tod, Mabuse Der Spieler, Faust, Der Golem, The Hands of Orlac, and Die Strasse, among many others. The art form would continue into the sound era with films like M (1931) and The Testament of Dr. Mabuse (1933), both by Lang. Its influence would spread to present day American cinema as well, with clear examples in the stark contrast and expressive lighting of noir and neo-noir films like The Big Sleep (1946) and Sin City (2005), the surreal angles and set design of Night of the Hunter (1955), the dark and brooding plot of Blue Velvet (1986), or the expressive colors and sets of A Clockwork Orange (1971). Metropolis might have been the last great silent German Expressionist film, but it was certainly not the last expressionist film. The elements of Expressionism, which focus on heavy symbolism, abstraction, and the search for a deeper meaning to situations, played a role in Lang's choices as the director of Metropolis. Subtlety was difficult to convey on the silent screen, so to create an effective message film, the director would have to employ some very unsubtle tactics. As an art form, Expressionism is about as unsubtle as possible. Examples of this are the architecture of the city, with laser-like highways streaking across the screen, channeling the Rayonist movement which influenced Expressionist painting, the jagged crosses in the catacombs chapel, and Rotwang's house, which looks like a building straight out of Caligari. Babel reaches into the sky as the tallest object in sight. Even the name is expressive, referencing the biblical parable, and as a result being the embodiment of man's triumph over God. The biblical Babel was destroyed. Lang's is successfully completed - the tallest thing in the city. As far as the technical prowess of the film is concerned, Lang's passion for the project is indicated in the meticulous execution of his special effects and sets. Everything runs smoothly, and considering Metropolis was made in an era which predated most of the special effects techniques we know today, it is one of the most impressive films ever made; on par in terms of technical innovation with some of the greatest films in history, perhaps even Citizen Kane (a film also no-doubt influenced by Expressionism).<br />The story, too, is highly rooted in expressionist philosophy. The idea of utopia was a staple in the dialogue of Die Brucke, the pioneering art group headed by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, and generally considered the beginning of German Expressionism proper. The expressionist philosophy which embraced war in order to bring mankind closer to this ideal utopia is also explored. Metropolis is plunged into chaos when the working class rebels and wreaks havoc on the city, and only then do the people realize the key to unity: amediator between the two classes. From chaos came order. This is what the painters of Die Brucke and Der Blaue Reiter hoped would result from World War I, and this is the premise behind the conflict in Metropolis. When Lang professed his disbelief in the film's message in his 1960s interview, it was after the message of Metropolis had been completely disproven. Not only did World War I not create the utopia the expressionists had hoped for, it had made the world far worse. World Was II was the wake-up call for Lang. With over 50 million killed, the war sent as strong a counter message as possible. There could be no mediator; if two groups hate each other enough, there is no force in the world which can stop them from killing each other if that's what they decide they want. Naturally, after witnessing such destruction, Lang would pass the plot of Metropolis off as a fairy tale. Seen through modern eyes, the film does seem overly optimistic for the future of mankind, but professes a future that is highly unlikely. If Lang meant in his quote that he felt this way at the time he made Metropolis, he was lying. At the time, he was as firmly rooted in the fundaments of expressionist thought as Kirchner was.<br /><br />History<br /><br /> Glorious at the time, tragic in retrospect, the years of 1926 through 1928 saw a dramatic upturn in the German economy - although this resurgence would be short lived. After the crushing inflation of 1924, where a loaf of bread cost as much as one billion marks, the economy began to heal. Optimism was in the air and the dark, morbid atmosphere of Expressionist films of the early decade (Nosferatu, Der Mude Tod, Der Strasse, etc...) changed to decidedly lighter tones. Metropolis was one of several films that shared this feeling of hope. UFA switched focus from horror to epic films, of which Metropolis is more closely akin. Films like Niebelungen and Faust were adaptations of classic literature. It seemed that this new sense of idealism wasthe death of expressionism as the Germans knew it. Metropolis is a tale of idealism at its most dramatic. Although there is discontent within the working class, the concept of a mediator presents a solution so simple it seems absurd in the light of feasible socioeconomic reality. The middle classes seem content, although the film gives them little notice. The upper classes occupy the Tower of Babel, and are never portrayed, with the exception of the main character Freder, as being unhappy. The plot is an unrealistic account of the maintenance of a utopia. As Lang said, it is a fairy tale. But in the relieved haze of post-inflation Germany, Metropolis seemed like a celebration of ingenuity and German strength. After all, UFA could afford to make the film, reputed to be one of the most expensive silent films ever made. Little did the people know that 1929 would provide yet another disaster - one which would make the inflation of 1924 pale in comparison. The Great Depression ruined Weimar Germany and paved the way for the Nazi takeover. Metropolis, being made three years before the crash, seemed blissfully ignorant. There is no better evidence for this than the message plastered on the promotional posters for the film, which stated, \\"Metropolis, the city of the future, is the city of eternal peace - the city of cities in which there is no animosity, no hatred, but only love and understanding.\\"<br /> Another strong influence on Metropolis was the contemporary political climate in Germany. The film portrays two social classes, upper and working, who coexist. Each is shown as necessary for the other's survival. The upper class (brain) controls the actions and organization of the working class (hands). Without the brain, the hands are unorganized and chaotic, as evidenced in their climactic riot. The working class in turn keeps the city from shutting down completely. This is evidenced when they destroy the Heart Machine and the power goes out. But these two groups also serve another purpose: they are both allegories for the various political parties in Germany. Near the end of the 1920s, the Weimar Republic had been overwhelmed with several political parties. The SPD (Socializimus Partei Deutschland), the KPD (Kommunizimus Partei Deutschland), and the NSDAP (Nationalsozializimus Deutscher Arbeiter Partei [Nazi Party]), were three among tens if not hundreds of parties warring for power over parliament. The communists are represented here by the working class, who live communally underground. The upper class were synonymous with the Weimar government: the socialist party. Left out was the middle class. In a case of life imitating art, this is what happened in Weimar society as well, at least with the petty bourgeois, who were the main constituents of the Nazi Party. Like in Metropolis, the dramatic polarities between the upper and lower classes provided enough of a distraction for the middle class to go relatively unnoticed. However, the situation in real life allowed the Nazis to come to power through gradual infiltration into the parliament. It would not be until the Great Depression, Hitler's dream come true, that the party would truly break through as the leader. But at the time Metropolis was made, the Nazis were going by relatively unnoticed. They were not nearly as strong as the ruling Socialist Party nor did they have the manpower of the communist party. In an ironic twist of fate the Nazi rule was consummated on the eve of an international disaster - something the early Expressionists philosophized as one of the instrumental steps toward utopia. Instead of a war, it was the great depression which launched Hitler's utopia - something drastically different from the one portrayed in Metropolis. The idea of a mediator is the only allegory for the middle class in Metropolis, and only appears at the end of the film. As was the case in real life, the mediator prevailed over both upper and lower, and took the form of national socialism. This is one reason why Lang believed that the moral behind the film was not realistic. A middle class was capable of keeping the upper and middle classes running synonymously, but this certainly did not produce utopia.<br /><br /> Metropolis was an allegory for where Weimar Germany thought it could go. Envisioned as an idealistic portrait of future society, it turned out to be, as Lang called it thirty years later, a fairy tale. But while unrealistic, it remains one of the most important films in history for its technical prowess and its sheer scale. We remain hopeful even to this day that we may one day live in a city like the one portrayed in the film, but just as much as it was in 1927, this dream seems unreachable. There will always be conflict, whether a mediator is present or not. The ultimate proof of this is in our own minds. The id and superego cannot function without the ego, the mediator, but we as humans are still fundamentally flawed. We would never allow something as tranquil as a culture devoid of animosity. Our naturalistic instinct toward anger is the biggest reason why utopia would never work. We will not evolve into a race without anger because it is the aggressive who prevail in the world, and the process of natural selection will chose those who exude it. The world will keep getting worse, and there will never be a utopia.
B00004SYWZ|5.0|I loved the album 'Hunting High and Low' in the mid-eighties in spite of the typical production values of the time. The songs behind the slightly 'tinny' sound in vogue back then were full of yearning ('Here I Stand and Face the Rain' is still one of my favourite love songs ever - from any band); I read somewhere that Pål Waaktaar saw the album as a type of love-letter.    'Minor Earth   Major Sky' still has the sense of beauty and emotion of their earlier albums; maybe in a more mature way.  Steer clear if you're a musical snob, because you'll probably have your mind made up before you've even heard it (by the way U2, Coldplay and Leonard Cohen admire them so if you do decide to like them don't worry, you're in good company...) but if you love great melody, vocals etc. this album is well worth buying.    Stand-out tracks? The title track, 'Summer Moved On' and 'Little Black Heart'.

B0013J30XG|4.0|Part comic book, part video game, part movie, part kaleidiscope, almost overwhelming<br /><br />Emilie Hursch is Speed Racer, a prodigal talent in a long standing racing family.  His brother Rex Racer was a hard-charging, risk-taking racer who seemingly loses his life in a dangerous icy cave race.<br /><br />Big corporations, greed, and conspiracy have control of races, dictating the winners for the past 50 years.  Speed Racer and his late brother don't play by those rules, and they must battle the evil influences of win at all costs racing monopolies to not only save racing, but also their family business, respect, and lives.<br /><br />The race scenes are amazing.  If NASCAR were like this in the future, I could see how people would like it.  As it stands now, it's far too boring to just see cars go in circles over and over and over again.  Perhaps if today's racing took some keys from this movie they would improve.  Since this is not only unlikely but also impossible, we will just have to enjoy the impossibility of this movie and its special effects.<br /><br />The action scene special effects are purposefully corny in some circumstances, and do not take away from the overall feel of the movie.  It only adds to the technical masterpiece of cinematography that is displayed.  Jagged and explosive, the oddball combination of a comic book and Japanimation somehow coalesce into a pleasing display of 21st century cinematic achievement.  It really is quite stunning when you think about all the green screen work that was necessary for the film.  Although, the storyline and scenes with the younger brother felt out of place, irritating, and a distraction to the overall carnival thrill-ride this movie provides.<br /><br />I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the monkey.  It's a simple fact: if you add a monkey to a film, the movie gets better.  It's an immutable, irrefutable truth.  Just ask Clint Eastwood.<br /><br />A fun movie, with just enough action, story, and special-effects to keep an audience enthralled, especially of the pre-teen variety.of the pre-teen variety.

0312305060|5.0|'The Hours' is certainly a unique, audacious piece of literature.  The author attempts to dissect the enigmatic Virginia Woolf and her most famous creation, Mrs Dalloway, then projects the results into the lives of characters living in America many years later.  Although the stories all hang together thanks to superlative prose, I'm not entirely sure what the author was trying to say about mankind (or womankind).  I'm sort of left scratching my head, but smiling at the same time.  I also found it to be a bit odd that nearly all the characters were gay or had some naughty near gay interlude.  For me it almost 'The Hours' seem farcical.      Bottom line: certainly deserving of the Pulizer prize.  Highly recommended.

B0017R5UAA|5.0|Fleet Foxes is a wonderful new band. If, like me, you've given up on surfing the air waves for music with substance a long time ago (I'm 39), I would like for you to know that there actually IS a lot of lovely music out there - you just have to look for it, and Amazon, as well as music magazines such as Uncut and Mojo are great for doing this. Iron And Wine (The Shepherd's Dog), Devendra Banhart (Smokey Rolls Down Thunder Canyon), Midlake (The Trials Of Van Occupanther), My Morning Jacket (Z, Evil Urges), Death Cab For Cutie (Narrow Stairs), and The Church (After Everything Now This, Uninvited Like The Clouds) are prime examples of the high quality of music that can be found, if you make an effort.<br />And Fleet Foxes are no exception. The songwriting, the musicianship, the arrangements, the lyrics, the lead and harmony vocals - excellent! Admittedly, these guys are a little \\"different\\", whatever that means, BUT...trust me, it all falls into place after a few spins. Fleet Foxes has developed a sound of their own, but the music contains elements of, for instance, The Beach Boys, The Band, Pentangle, and Crosby, Stills & Nash.

1593979827|5.0|In listening to this audio, one gets a good sense of the author's pursuit of the truth.<br /><br />Through motorcyling with his son Chris and friends in the midwest, they encounter within themselves and others, thoughts, feelings and truths that might never have been discovered.<br /><br />The challenge of this kind of trip forces you to look inward for strength, determination and trust.  You become your own best friend.<br /><br />As the author moves onto the philosophy of life and being, he has done some serious introspective.  So much so that he has become at times delusional and out of step with society, which he blames for many of the problems that he is facing as well as others on this path.<br /><br />One has to agree with the author that our western society has made it almost impossible for one to follow his/her own path.  There are so many distractions along the way, which makes it easy for one to falter.  This is one good reason that many have turned to the eastern religions for a more balanced spirit.<br /><br />The author moves forward with the help of his son Chris.
B000WGZGNS|4.0|Since Beyonce went solo, I have been very disappointed in her. Not that I have a problem with her going solo. She just have not lived up to the hype surrounding her...until now! This DVD concert is the first project that lives up to her \\"legend-in-waiting\\" status.    This concert was great. Beyonce sings and dance her heart out in every number. Don't expect too many surprises though, because this DVD is basically an upgrade from her \\"Beyonce - Live at Wembley\\". She took the concepts of her first solo DVD and Destiny's Child farewell Atlanta DVD and upgraded the performances a level or two. That's not a bad thing, but I expected to see a little more from her.     I have only two real complaints: There is no bonus footage (behind the scenes footage, interview, or bonus track). In this day and time, you expect more from an artist and I think Beyonce short-changed us on the extra stuff. Its no wonder Christina Aguilera's DVD is doing better than Beyonce's (despite costing more).     The other complaint I have is the video is stretched. Why? To make her appear thinner? It didn't work because even though Beyonce is beautiful, you can tell she was heavier than her last tour. I just find it tacky that they tried to cover that up by stretching the video.     Either way, I enjoyed the concert and I think you will too.
0345457692|4.0|Altered Carbon is a fantastic novel in a genre that I usually don't venture into much.  Needless to say Morgan has risen above the fold of other \\"cyberpunk\\" novels and Altered Carbon has made me an instant fan of his.    Altered Carbon has three things going for it: good pacing and action, clever plotting and originality.  The book is action packed and moves quickly but not at the sacrifice of character development.  From the intro up until the end we are thrown in the whirlwind that is Takeshi Kovacks' life and it is exciting.  The crime story aspect of the novel I found to be very Asimovian which is not a bad thing at all.  The twists and turns are not just plot driven but also correspond to the development of Kovacs as a character.  Finally, there are quite a few novel sci-fi ideas in Morgan's world and the stack juxtaposition lends itself to many intellectual dilemmas.  I wonder if Morgan realized when he thought of it that it would probably be an idea on which to base multiple books around.    The writing is serviceable and the details are dense which in turn creates a rich but challenging world to exist in.  This book is not for casual sci-fi readers nor is it for the squeamish or juvenile as there is pretty explicit violence (and sex).     Altered Carbon juggles many themes such as individuality, identity, morality, and immortality all centered around advanced technology that basically allows you to switch bodies but keep your memories.  Its fascinating stuff and handled with thought that goes way beyond just the initial conception and introduction of the idea.  Morgan really runs with it all the way to the finish line.    Bottom Line:  Highly recommended for sci-fi fans who don't mind a little steroids with their breakfast.

B00005JPAO|5.0|That's my favorite line in the film, from a wickedly funny exchange between the Queen and her son Prince Charles. She says it to her beloved dogs when she abruptly decides to go for a walk and leave the Prince to drive off in a huff to a stag hunt after he exasperates her with his wimpish apprehension of getting shot at. One of my favorite scenes in an excellent film.  Helen Mirren deserved her Oscar for Best Actress.  Her portrayal of QEII is spot on.  A marvel how much she resembles the Queen in appearance!  I've seen this movie several times and it gets better every time. Michael Sheen's Tony Blair is also quite excellent.  All the actors are top-notch in their roles.  The movie's take of the royal family's behind-the-scenes machinations when Diana died is believable. That's what lends it an almost documentary feel throughout.  Highly recommended.
B00164KYS2|2.0|This is a review where I have to be up-front: I've never seen HBO's hit comedy \\"Sex and the City.\\" Not because I have anything against sitcoms that revolve around women gossiping about clothes, men, and sex, it's just that I can't afford HBO. Therefor I was actually looking forward to seeing \\"Sex and the City: The Movie,\\" as I hoped it would give me some clue as to why the show became such a big hit. Well, I can see the appeal, but I'm not sure if a movie was the best format for this show. Maybe a mini-series would have been better? Since I haven't seen the show I'm not sure what's been going on to lead to the events of the movie, but the movie revolves around Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker), New York's ultimate single girl.<br /><br />Carrie is a professional writer, writing many books (mostly about relationships and fashion), and having a long relationship with Mr. Big (Chris Noth), a relationship that I assume has been going on since the show. They are now taking the big step of moving into an apartment together, and they've found a great apartment with only one flaw: the closet is too small. No worries though, as Mr. Big promises to build Carrie a bigger closet. This decision leads to the two deciding to get married, in a manner that is very business like and unromantic. That said, it's rare that any relationship these days gets a proposal, so maybe this can still be considered a success? Well, if you've seen the previews, you know that the wedding doesn't work out, which gives the movie it's emotional pull.<br /><br />But this is \\"Sex and the City.\\" This show isn't about one woman it's about four. So while Carrie's story should be enough to fill out a movie, we get major storylines for the other women as well. There's Miranda Hobbes (Cynthia Nixon), who's own marriage is in trouble after her husband cheats on her (he did this, apparently, because his wife stopped giving out). There's Samantha Jones (Kim Cattrall), who apparently didn't have much use for a steady relationship in the show, but now has one in a Hollywood hunk. Finally there's Charlotte Goldenblatt (Kristin Davis) who stands out as the only character to not have any relationship problems in this movie. In fact, she's pregnant in this movie, which is noteworthy because in the show she was told she couldn't have children, so it's nice to know not everyone's lives are full of gloom.<br /><br />Finally there is Louise, Carrie's new assistant who came to New York to find love. Carrie hires her because this girl reminds her of herself before the reality of life sank in. This is a touching storyline, but I have to wonder how much reality could have really sunk in when the woman walks around the city wearing fancy jewelry and never gets mugged? Never mind. Despite the checklist of characters one has to name off just to scratch the surface of this movie, it's to the writers credit that the movie is not more confusing. As someone who's never seen the show I was amazed at how much these stories made sense in their own right, and that the movie didn't seem to be handicapped by the TV show's established continuity.<br /><br />With that out of the way I need to get to why the story - for everything it does right - never quite takes off. The movie is two and a half hours long. If all this was spent wisely on the lives of the girls this might not be so bad, but the movie gives us many scenes that simply do not need to be here. These scenes include the girls talking about their sex lives, the latest in fashion, and least three five minute scene where a variety of different dresses are worn by the girls. Dialog that either advances the story or is mindless gossip is almost always spoken in a fashion store, because these women are always shopping. Always shopping. Even during some of the more emotional scenes one can't help but feel that this feels like a glorified commercial on some level.<br /><br />It also doesn't help that for many of these situations the women comeoff as unreasonable while the men come off as much clearer thinkers, which seems to defeat the purpose of a \\"chick flick.\\" I also want to give special mention to Jennifer Hudson, who plays Louise, as this is her first role after she won an Oscar for her role in \\"Dreamgirls.\\" I've debated Hudson's acting talent in \\"Dreamgirls\\" with friends, as I felt she was a better singer then an actress. At least one of my friends felt that singing was acting. Well, her performance here should validate my opinion a better, because despite playing one of the better characters in the movie, her acting and line delivery is so flat and unconvincing, that it brings into question whether she's a competent actress or not. Trust me, this is not something you want discussed about you if you won an Oscar.<br /><br />On the positive side I can see why this show was such a success. These characters may seem shallow, but spend enough time with them and they revel human characteristics that make them very realistic at times. The dialog is not completely dumb, the discussions with fashion obviously appeal to women, and there's something to be said about a movie where middle-aged women are portrayed as beautiful, sexy things, in a Hollywood that believes you've outlived your beauty once you reach 40. The biggest problem is the length of the film though, and how the script deviates too much for me to really recommend this. I liked some of it, and I am not opposed to a sequel, but a tighter script where the characters talk more about their lives and less about shoes would be far preferable.<br /><br />Rating: ** and a half starsff as much clearer thinkers, which seems to defeat the purpose of a \\"chick flick.\\" I also want to give special mention to Jennifer Hudson, who plays Louise, as this is her first role after she won an Oscar for her role in \\"Dreamgirls.\\" I've debated Hudson's acting talent in \\"Dreamgirls\\" with friends, as I felt she was a better singer then an actress.

B0015D3Z4O|4.0|Madonna is at her best when she is having fun and not preaching to us about the ills of the world. This is why I love \\"Hard Candy\\"! Its simply a fun, dance-filled and catchy album. This is the first album since \\"Ray of Light\\" in which I totally enjoyed from the first time I heard it.    I love how Madonna used her past (she went back to 1983) to create these songs. Its amazing how her last album with WB pay tribute to her first album with the label. I think its wonderful she re-discovered her roots. Songs like \\"Give It To Me\\", \\"Heartbeat\\", \\"She's Not Me\\" and my favorite \\"Dance 2night\\" takes the best elements of 80s pop and mixed it with modern urban beats. \\"Spanish Lesson\\" and \\"Miles Away\\" sounds like Madonna is trying to re-capture her \\"True Blue\\" days. The other songs are good, but they don't stand out to me.    Many people have blasted Madonna for \\"selling out\\" and doing \\"black music\\". For one, its ALL black music and for anyone to call Madonna a \\"sell out\\" tells me you don't know Madonna's history. For many months after WB released her debut album, people thought she was black until she made her first video. Her second album \\"Like A Virgin\\" was basically R&B/pop and of course, there's \\"Bedtime Stories\\". The fact of the matter is, Madonna has always done R&B.    I will admit that lyrically, Madonna is at one of her weakest points. Vocally, she doesn't give us much to praise. Its the production, the beats, and the concept that keeps this album from dragging. This may not be one of her best albums, but it will go down as the album that returned Madonna to her roots.    The only real complaint I have is the unattractive cover and the hideous artwork. You can barely read the credits because of the colors and how tight the words are. The pictures are some of the worst pictures of Madonna I have every seen. Despite the artwork, the music is hot. Enjoy!
B000RZIGVS|4.0|I got mine from ebay for 245 bucks with shipping,which is reasonable this set I think. I agree Star Trek seasons are overpriced. When you consider     1) It is an older show   2) doesn't have as many extra features (i do like the ones included though)   3) other sets (of similar shows) cost around 35  and go on sale for less sometimes.     The packaging could be better for sure. The seller from ebay put enough cushioning and it arrived with no trays broken or any damage. I know from experience Amazon just puts one air bag for most DVD sets. While this is ok for most box sets, this set needs to be packed more carefully.      The Voyager sets have similar (but cooler looking transclusent ones) design in packaging but since the sets are smaller they dont break as much.     It is a pain flipping through the trays on the set, however. So I put my DVDs in a DVD binder. I put the box in the closet for storage. That way it will stay in excellent condition.     I've watched all the discs up until Disc 5 of season 4, I didn't have any problems with audio as one reviewer mentioned.

B0013FNC38|5.0|Again Jason Mraz delivers.  Light, fun, original.  My favorites are tracks #2 and #3.  Admittedly the acoustic version of \\"I'm Yours\\" is better, but this isn't an acoustic album.  Can't wait for the next one!
B00168OINA|2.0|Though I saw the new Indiana Jones movie about two weeks ago I delayed writing a review. How does one even write a review for a movie of this caliber? Indiana Jones is one of the most loved movie trilogies of all time. We've waited twenty years to see this movie, and fans of the movie are just waiting to pounce on critics who dare say one nasty thing about the new movie. Praise it too much though and cynics will call you a fanboy. So since I'm in a lose-lose situation I'm just going to be honest in my critique, and all I ask is that you keep this in mind: I've been waiting most of my life for this movie too. So the new installment of the franchise is \\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.\\" I personally find the title to be a little underwhelming, but what's in a name right?<br /><br />So the movie revolves around Indiana Jones (played once more by an aging Harrison Ford), his father having died a few years before, and his life is in a bit of a transition. And when I say his life is in a transition it means that he's been accused of communism and, as a result, fired from his teaching position. Yes, unlike what we were led to believe, the Nazi's have been replaced with the Soviet Union. Which brings me to Cate Blanchett's portrayal of, of...oh who am I kidding, I don't know her name, she's Cate Blanchett playing a communist. Which means this is one of the meanest, sexiest, and best acted communists you're going to see in a movie. Also joining the cast is Shia LeBeouf as Mutt, a kid who seeks Indies help to find his mother, who'd been kidnaped by the commies.<br /><br />Now I have nothing against LeBeouf, but he's one of the hottest stars in Hollywood right now, considered to be the next Tom Hanks. Judging from his performance in this movie though, I'm not sure why this is the case. He's not bad, but his chemistry with Harrison Ford is a bit, shall we say, uninspired. The characters don't seem to gel at any point, and we get the feeling Mutt is, more or less, just along for the ride. The story revolves around a crystal skull that could lead to a lost alien civilization, containing knowledge that any ruler in the world would want to have. Yeah, this movie involves aliens. But as I've been telling people, once you find God I guess there's nothing left to find except aliens.<br /><br />The movie contains everything you'd expect an Indiana Jones to have: chases, fights, lots of stunts, and a scene involving a snake. Pull a lever here and there to open a secret door to a cave to move forward, and it all goes as you might expect. There are two major reasons this movie doesn't work though. The first is the story is a little too silly, even for Indiana Jones standards. Granted, as many people most likely point out when one brings up the story they'll be quick to point out that none of the stories are very good. Fine, I'll admit that. But that doesn't excuse the story for being NOTICEABLY poor in this movie! See, if you're going to make a movie with a silly story, the best thing to do is make the movie fun enough so that this isn't an issue. See \\"Pirates of the Carribean,\\" \\"Jurassic Park,\\" and \\"Speed Racer\\" for some good examples.<br /><br />The second issue is Harrison Ford himself. To be blunt, this man looks too old to still be doing this. Most of the dangerous stunt work involving Indie keeps Fords face shadowed, leading me to believe a stunt double was seriously involved in the making of this film. Ford's age may even explain the reduced action scenes involving Indie (Mutt does more of the dangerous work this time around) and maybe even the reduced action scenes in general. When I add it all up, the movie comes off as being too familiar, too silly, and too restrained. I'm not sure what I was expecting from a forth Indiana Jones film, but I expected to feel more then indifferent to it.<br /><br />Rating: ** starsfor the ride.

B0001LJC2K|4.0|Great CD from this British band. Yes, the band is poppy but they infuse enough rock, prog and Queen to keep them interesting. Keep an eye on this band. I think they're only going to get better. A real great listen with the spirit of Freddy Mercury.
B000H7JD4K|3.0|First of all, I'd just like to say that I'm glad Iron Maiden are still together and putting albums out. I thought 2003's DANCE OF DEATH was a fine modern Maiden CD with great cuts like \\"Paschendale,\\" \\"Rainmaker,\\" \\"Dance of Death\\" and a few others. I like the fact that Maiden has their own highly unique sound and refuse to jump on stylistic bandwagons. Iron Maiden is Iron Maiden.<br /><br />I'd also like to point out that I had owned and digested their debut album and KILLERS before Bruce Dickinson made his premier as vocalist and they subsequently made it big in America.<br /><br />With this understanding, I bought A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH when it came out in 2006 and I've given it numerous listens since then. I'm sorry but this isn't a very good Maiden album. It's okay; it's very original and I respect that; there are some good parts here & there and a couple of fine songs, but that's about it.<br /><br />What's wrong with the album?<br /><br />- For one the production isn't all that great for a modern CD. I'm not a big Evanescence fan or anything, but the production on their 2006 album THE OPEN DOOR was incredible. The thing is, Evanescence are a relatively new band while Maiden has been releasing albums since 1980. Since Maiden have WAY more experience shouldn't their CDs sound significantly better than a group of young bucks? The best way I could describe the production on LIFE AND DEATH is that it's raw. Even though this is so, it wouldn't matter to me personally if the songs were great (after all, I'm a huge fan of rawly produced albums like Bathory's HAMMERHEART). But this is hardly the case.<br /><br />- Bruce is a fine metal vocalist and has numerous stellar moments with Maiden, but on LIFE AND DEATH he too often sounds like he's straining to stay in key and it grates on the nerves (some places worse than others). What's interesting is that Bruce is a much better vocalist on his solo material. This indicates that he's likely pushed to do things against his better judgment in Maiden. Perhaps his judgment gets squelched by the democratic Maiden proccess machine. Who knows? All I know is that he comes across annoying on LIFE AND DEATH too often. I realize this is sacriledge to uber-Dickinson fans who automatically rate any Maiden CD a masterpiece as long as he's on vox, but I don't share such mindless enthusiasm. In fact, some of my favorite Maiden albums are without Bruce -- the debut, KILLERS and even X-FACTOR. But, don't get me wrong, I love Bruce; I just can't stand it when he grates on the nerves.<br /><br />- There aren't that many good songs on a WHOLE. \\"The Legacy\\" is nigh stellar and there are a couple of other decent tunes like \\"Different World\\" (notice I said decent, not great) but by and large the songs don't work as whole numbers. For instance, the beginning of \\"The Longest Day\\" is creative and catchy but it's ruined by most of the rest of the piece, especially the chorus. Despite this fact, you'll hear numerous shining MOMENTS interspersed throughout the CD, such as the chorus of \\"For the Greater Good of God.\\"<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH ranks with Iron Maiden's weaker efforts, but it's thankfully no where near as bad as VIRTUAL XI. Regardless, there's quite a bit to like and respect here if you're a Maiden fan, especially the fact that it's totally original, sounding like no other band or release. But, be forewarned, it's a real hit and miss mediocre affair IMHO.<br /><br />3/5 Stars is generous.s his judgment gets squelched by the democratic Maiden proccess machine. Who knows?

0743201140|4.0|Easy read.  Very positive.  Good book for team building, but the downside is that you MUST buy a book for each individual person so that they can take the on-line test.
0385503954|5.0|\\"Atonement\\" was an absolutely beautiful novel.    McEwan is very gifted at characterization- that's probably what I liked the most about the novel. Also, I felt he was extremely adept at getting his audience involved emotionally with the story. (Right after I finished reading I had to call my fiancee to make sure he wasn't dead or something.)    I can see why some readers might not enjoy his style, as it's somewhat complex and a little hard to follow at points, but I think it's well worth it to muddle through the parts that are a little convoluted. He's not at all pretentious when you get down to it; his writing style is just different than most modern authors' styles.     \\"Atonement\\" is a romance at heart, but there is much more than the love story going on (despite what the movie trailer made it look like). It's just all around a good read. If you're looking for an easy one I wouldn't bother, but if you're looking for something to make you think, then I'd at least borrow it from the library. I bought it after that.
0060536977|3.0|This review pertains especially to the unabridged audio book version of Michael Crichton's PREY, read by George Wilson.  (Robert Sean Leonard performs the abridged audio book.)  I'll address first the reading, and then the story.<br /><br />I have not really listened to a lot of books.  I'd always wondered if listening to a book counts as having \\"read\\" it, giving that absurd question far more thought than is worth.  One thing I've learned, though, is that despite not seeing the words on a page I retain far more of the story, even the author's language, than I had thought I would.  I guess that that's because, as the words are read, one paints the scenes in one's mind, and it's the vivid memory of those scenes, a memory both visual and auditory, that sticks--like old-time radio.<br /><br />So let me comment on the auditory experience.  George Wilson's baritone voice does a nice job with the narrative itself.  But is it common for a reader to try to give distinctive \\"voices\\" to the characters?  In particular, should a male reader attempt to \\"put on\\" a female voice?  And how about mimicking children: should an adult male reader of a book try to switch to children's voices?  This method of book reading might work well with a particularly good actor, but Wilson's attempts fall short of the mark.  When Wilson first started reading the words of an Asian-American character, Mae Chang, in a soft, high voice, I started to laugh.  It just sounded alternately unintentionally seductive and silly.  And forget the arguments between the kids; it's like listening to an adult mock the way children talk.  Far better for Wilson just to have read the entire material in his own voice.<br /><br />As for the novel itself, PREY follows the formula first set out by Michael Crichton in THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN and developed much further in JURASSIC PARK.  The formula works quite well; it's like variations on an amusement park ride.  What makes Crichton's novels particularly fun to read for someone who likes the \\"science\\" in \\"science fiction\\" is that Crichton weaves in a lot of factual science material into his narrative.  At times, though, the way he weaves that material in can be borderline pedantic; what's worse is that it can destroy the flow of the story and diminish its effectiveness.<br /><br />PREY is essentially JURASSIC PARK with swarming hybrid nanomachine-microorganisms in place of dinosaurs.  (Wouldn't THE SWARMS have been a better title, incidentally?)  Both stories involve technology that isn't too far removed from the present, and concern the havoc that results when human beings, full of hubris and highly fallible, attempt to play God.  The basic problem with PREY's monsters is that they aren't a feature of popular culture.  And swarming dust doesn't immediately strike one as very terrifying.  Crichton does a great job, though, at making these swarms frightening.  He builds the tension for a satisfying ride through what one would be forgiven for calling Nanoland Park.<br /><br />There are problems with PREY.  Beyond the expected plot holes that suspension of disbelief wants to hide, the occasional hackneyed plot twists and interactions between characters, and the sometimes embarrassingly bad dialogue, PREY takes far too long to get the story going.  A good first third of the book takes place in a home in which some strange things happen; developments that seem far less mysterious to the reader than they are to the--supposedly smart--characters.  The home scenes basically reveal that Julia Forman, the wife of the main character, Jack Forman, and the mother of two-going-on-three brats, is acting very strangely.  Before the action even moves out to the desert--Nanoland Park--the reader already knows that Julia is \\"possessed\\" by the evil nanoparticles; we just don't know how or why.  We are left to wonder about some of the other strange occurrences, while having to put up with arguments between the brats and, even worse, wimpy Jack's inability todo anything with any kind of conviction at all.  Not caring about the characters is not where the reader wants to be when the action begins.<br /><br />However that may be, once the Nanoland Park ride begins, the story becomes compelling and fun.  (I knew I had got caught up in it when I hesitated to kiss my wife one evening!  You'll have to read the story to understand.)  It would make a good summer read, or, if you can put up with George Wilson's varying \\"voices,\\" a good beach listen.  What gives this pulp fiction a kind of redeeming value beyond entertainment is that Crichton occasionally also succeeds in making you ponder the world through the lens of science; for instance, he makes the point that our bodies in all their sum parts are essentially swarms of nanoparticles and that our mental activity is actually far more decentralized than what we might think.n at all.

0525950079|2.0|Over the years, I have enjoyed many of Ken Follet's books. I thoroughly enjoyed Pillars of the Earth and was looking forward to World Without End.  I was disappointed in World Without End.  It seemed to be a collection of vignettes about sexual liaisons tied together very loosely through a small english village and a few historical events.  ES
B00005JPSM|2.0|I could hardly finish this movie. There was so little dialogue, and so little action. Most of the scenes were silent, and we were just watching people walk around or cook. I was bored sick, and I don't reccomend this film unless you want to fall asleep.    I love Catherine Zeta Jones because she's so charming, Aaron Eckheart was likeable, and Abigail Breslin is a brilliant little actress, but none of them could save this movie. It was a waste of money and talent. It seems like they used the script for another film, but just took out what they couldn't use instead of re-writing it. The trailer makes it look entertaining and fun, but it wasn't. I was disappointed, and I wanted to turn it off before we were at the end. I just kept thinking that it would be over any time, but it dragged on and on.    There are no surprises and no scenes that are worth watching the movie for. Everything was bland and boring. Don't bother watching it. If you read a review of it by a good writer, that will be more interesting than the film itself.
B0012E6R3W|4.0|I don't know why people have a problem with this album. Sure, it's no \\"The New Order,\\" but it doesn't try to be. And that's why it succeeds. The Formation of Damnation represents the perfection of the \\"modern thrash\\" sound. Modern thrash isn't really even thrash at all (more like groove played fast with the occasional thrash riff), but if you have any stomach for it at all, you'll be able to appreciate this album's greatness.    Let me just say, it's great to have Alex Skolnick back. The Gathering would have been a lot better if he'd been around, and his solos really make this album stand out. Riff-wise, it's about what you'd expect: fast, somewhat groove-oriented, sometimes thrashy, backed up by Paul Bostaph's intense pounding on the drumset. Not much bass to be heard under the guitars, drums, and vocals...but that's a pretty common thing in modern metal albums. And then there's Chuck Billy; you either love him or you hate him. I, for one, am a big fan, and he's in fine form here. As always, he mixes it up between snarling clean vocals and death growls, with the balance perhaps a little more on the clean side than on The Gathering.    There are some real smokers on this album. After a grandiose intro track, \\"More Than Meets the Eye\\" kicks things off with a lot of intensity. The terrific chorus and even better guitar solo make it a real standout. \\"The Evil Has Landed\\" is another gem and is solid enough to overcome the terrible pun in its title. \\"F.E.A.R.\\" is pretty killer as well; Chuck's vocals in the chorus (which is amazing) recall James Hetfield's better days. The title track isn't as strong as those three, but is terribly catchy and showcases Chuck's death growls. There are few songs that seem a little bit like filler, but they all have their moments. Nothing bad enough to use your skip button.    Bottom line: if you enjoyed Testament's past couple albums, you'll absolutely love this one, as it is definitely a refinement of that sound. If you weren't too crazyabout The Gathering but didn't mind the style, then you should definitely pick this up. But don't expect true thrash. Testament knew exactly what kind of album they were trying to make, and they pulled it off perfectly. Highly recommended.
1416563156|4.0|The premise behind the journal is that it was given to Indy by Henry Jones Sr to record his experiences.  What you get is the highlights of Indy's career from early (The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles) to the films and a little in between (continuity from video games).  The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull pages are a bit light especially the stuff about Mutt Williams (I'm avoid spoilers, but I find it hard to believe that Indy makes just one comment about him).  The pages have illustrations from the movies, including grail diary pages, translations, and little notes from the KGB people that have supposedly found the book.    This is a must for Indy fans.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|I waited a long time to watch the classic film JAWS because I always heard it was so scary and full of gore.  I finally watched it this week and though the movie did make me jump a couple of times  the images of blood and guts are about the same if not milder than what you would see on a typical CSI episode.  The film is a true landmark in the horror genre  mostly because the three main characters (the marine biologist, the police chief and the shark hunter) are so well developed with complete back stories and very well portrayed by fine actors.  The plot of the story is rich in themes that go well beyond the man vs giant toothy sea monster we usually think of when someone mentions the film JAWS or hums the trademark theme song.  JAWS has truly earned a lasting position in our popular culture.
0316113506|5.0|Spark! An amazing book, hands down...why? Many books explain how exercise helps with wt. control, physical benefits of getting in shape, and other fountain of youth aspects . These are great reasons to exercise, but Spark hits on an entire different niche, the mental benefits and effects on the brain. Sometimes just knowing how and why exercise helps with bad moods, depression and anxiety is all the push people need to get moving. I have read a few negative responses, but hey, guess you can't please everyone...right. I 100 percent enjoyed and found the book to be fascinating and helpful with my own bouts of depression. Let's make a deal to all those who have something negative to say regarding Spark...before making a comment, go for a run and then write how you feel and we'll go frome there.....health in motion
B00000K3CM|5.0|Home Alone 2 - Lost in New York is just as delightful and hilarious as the first one. The whole cast returns including Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern who are still causing trouble but this time on the streets of the Big Apple. Culkin has great comic timing, too bad he had a hard time finding roles after this one. I enjoyed this sequel and mostly I hate sequels, I highly recommend this family film, enjoy!

B0001XAPZ6|2.0|After seeing almost all of Miyazaki's films I watched this one and... WHAT HAPPENED?! I was expecting another great film and this one! NOT GREAT! The animation was weird, the story pretty pointless, and the characters are annoying! I'm giving this puppy a 2/5 because I respect Mr. Miyazaki enough to not give him a one (even if I did hate it) lol! I guess it's just a matter of opinion. :D

B000002UUX|5.0|Rust in Peace is one of those albums where everything comes together: songwriting, performance and recording. This is by far the best Megadeth has to offer. I've heard every Megadeth album multiple times, but I always find myself coming back to this one.    First, the playing here is top-notch. The addition of Friedman gives Megadeth a completely new dimension in terms of sound. From his modal guitar solos to his mechanic speed-picking, this album cooks from first to last note.     Second, the songwriting and lyrics. Great and...great. Song structures are tight, lyrics are melodic and have meaning, really not a bad song on the entire album. No fillers here.    Lastly, the recording is so clear and crisp, you would never know that is was recorded in 1990. A great sonic achievement.     In closing, if you are just getting into Megadeth, this is the album to start with. Great thrash, unbelievable playing, and one of the best sounding metal records of all time.    Favorite Tracks: Holy Wars, Hangar 18, and Rust in Peace.
0060594896|5.0|Don't borrow this book from anyone--you will want your own copy! This is a book that is on my list of books never to be without! Canfield is masterful at writing in plain, easy to follow directions for accomplishing goals and even those dreams that some never let themselves think about since childhood. I used to think that I had to work to earn money before I could find my purpose and have any fun. Now I absolutely know that I can have fun living my purpose and have the money, too. The Success Principles gives hope and direction to anyone who seeks and acts on the wisdom in its pages. I am practicing this now and cannot wait to teach this to the world!
B000O77QD8|4.0|I\\"ve read a great deal of WWII history, including several accounts of the pacific campaign, and although I'm a right winger and hawk, i'm not oblivious to the human flaws of politics and war.  The stories of the kids in these battles are incredible, and they may be reluctant heroes, and maynot be heroes in any sense of the word, but they are ordinary people driven to extraordinary actions.  As a movie, this book does pander a little to political correctness, and suffers for it.  The brutality of the Japanese, their instigation of the war, and the horrifying mutilation of Americans, including Iggy, are glossed over.  The author's naive remarks to his father about how the Japanese were just plain folk and naively driven to the war by their leaders and the father's reaction, of course, are left out of the movie.  And Ira Hayes, a true tragic hero, is rendered well, but the clear subtext of the movie is the nascent racism he faced.  Perhaps he did, and the rendition of it was appalling in the movie, but that wasn't teh subject of the book.  But despite these inaccuracies, I thought it was a good story, well told, worth seeing, and moving.
0756404746|2.0|Apart from LOTR, I haven't read much fantasy lit.  Books like this are the reason why.  Meandering.  Slow.  Self-indulgent.  And worst of all, boring.  Basically a 600 page setup for a sequel.  Unless you're addicted to long, bad books, don't waste your time on this one.
0316143472|5.0|I loved this book!  David Sedaris is a beautiful writer.  He's incredibly funny and witty, but he also has an amazing amount of humanity.  This collection does not disappoint!  GET IT!
0553804677|5.0|\\"The Lies of Locke Lamora\\" is an awesome book!    Absolutely fantastic ... one of my favourite books ever.  I love it.    However, I do not like the hardcover edition as much as the paperback.  The font under the dustcover is strange, there are a few grammatical errors in the book, and the first two words of each chapter are capitalised ... which really annoys me, but probably won't bother anyone else.    Also, make sure you know whether the version you are purchasing is American or British, because it can be frustrating to find words spelled differently to what you're used to.  \\"The Grey King\\" vs \\"The Gray King\\", etc.    But the story itself is wonderful and 100% worth reading!
B001AQR3IU|4.0|Fantasy is hard to find in the movies -- for every \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" there's only a handful of bad sword'n'sorcery tales for kids (\\"Eragon,\\" \\"The Seeker\\"). As for fairy tales, forget it.<br /><br />But one little fairy tale HAS made its way into theatres -- an enchanting little story loosely based on a Neil Gaiman novel. And \\"Stardust's\\" charm is its lack of pretension, and its willingness to be silly, romantic, fantastical, sparkling and most importantly, tongue-in-cheek. And it has pirates too.<br /><br />A wall separates our world from the world of magic -- and one night, Dunstan Thorn went over it, and had a brief tryst with a beautiful princess, who is imprisoned by a witch. Nine months later, baby Tristan is left on his doorstep.<br /><br />Nineteen years later, a dying king magically flings a ruby into the sky, and says that the prince who finds it will be the new king. The two remaining princes -- and the ghosts of their dead brothers -- et off to find it. But that ruby dislodged a star, and it plummets to the ground across the Wall -- attracting the attention of three ancient witches, who use the hearts of stars to restore their spent youth.<br /><br />Still with me?<br /><br />Tristan (Charlie Cox) also sees the star, and the snotty girl he adores (Sienna Miller) says that she will marry him if he gets her the star before her birthday. Tristan does manage to find and entrap the beautiful star, Yvaine (Claire Danes), and they start off on a magical adventure of air pirates, unicorns, evil witches, and true love.<br /><br />\\"Stardust\\" has pretty much all the requirements for a fantasy and/or fairy tale movie -- magic, love, an evil villain, and lots of odd characters to round out the cast, and flesh out the story. Not much is actually new. But like the original Gaiman tale, the movie winks affectionately at you as the story unfolds.<br /><br />In fact, the movie only really stumbles when it stops to ruminate on true love and how precious it is, etc. Cute, but boring -- especially since the romantic leanings of the leads are pretty clear. Director Matthew Vaughn really shines when he's focusing on airships, goat-men, and the occasional magical sword-fight with an dead man.<br /><br />Despite the scattered nature of the plot, Vaughn directs with a smooth, sure hand, and he sprinkles plenty of comic relief through it -- Captain Shakespeare dancing in drag, or the Greek chorus of murdered princes. And the dialogue avoids fantastical pomposity by being just as tongue-in-cheek (\\"Nothing says \\"romance\\" like a kidnapped injured woman!\\")<br /><br />Cox makes an excellent wide-eyed, slightly blinkered country boy, who turns from a bumbling suitor to a strong young hero. Danes isn't quite as ethereal as one would expect Yvain to be, but she gives a solid performance, and Miller is perfect as the snotty, shallow Victoria.<br /><br />But while the younger performers are solid, the veterans are absolutely brilliant. Pfeiffer is hilarious, chilling and pouty as the constantly frustrated witch, and De Niro steals the show as a cuddly, twinkly-eyed gay pirate who pretends to be brutal. And Peter O'Toole and David Kelly have brief but brilliant appearances.<br /><br />\\"Stardust\\" is exactly what the title suggests -- sparkling, funny, wry, and just deep enough to be entertaining.

Pfeiffer is hilarious, chilling and pouty as the constantly frustrated witch, and De Niro steals the show as a cuddly, twinkly-eyed gay pirate who pretends to be brutal. And Peter O'Toole and David Kelly have brief but brilliant appearances.    \\"Stardust\\" is exactly what the title suggests -- sparkling, funny, wry, and just deep enough to be entertaining. A solid, sweet little fantasy movie.
0199206589|3.0|I read sections of this book to see if it was worth reading further, but my conclusion was \\"no.\\"  The tone is lively.  However, the author is not to the point and doesn't give straight answers.    For example, I wanted to know how he defined \\"geopolitics\\" for the purpose of this book.  He asked a rhetorical question, \\"But what exactly is geopolitics?\\"  His answer was a rambling about Google, some pundits, and his opinion that the definition is \\"slippery.\\"  This was unsatisfactory.  He later talks about how geopolitics works, how politicians legitimate geopolitical policy with phrases (\\"axis of evil\\"), but what good is this information without some practical definition of the key concept?    In later chapters, he has interesting stories but he also has unhelpful titles for subsections.  For example, \\"Geopolitics of national sovereignty and the international system\\".  Why not just say \\"national sovereignty and the international system\\"?    The material is interesting, and it is obvious that this author has a lot of things to say.  Unfortunately, it lacks coherence and conciseness that are necessary for a lay person to grasp the take-home messages.  I think the author didn't spend enough time editing his own work.  If I were the editor, I would be happy to sift through the lively stories in spite of the careless choices of inexact words.  Since I am not the editor, however, I will wait for the second edition.
0446402389|5.0|Leo Stepanivich Demidov, a war hero and member of the MGB, working as a high ranking  employee of the State Security force, started off with one ambition: to serve his country.  His job was frequently unpleasant, arresting and interrogating enemies, sometimes their own citizens who tried to undermine the government. Leo was involved with many successful arrests and took many prisoners, many of these prisoners guilty of anti-Soviet agitation, counterrevolutionary activity, and espionage. The problem was, no on could be sure they weren't guilty of these crimes, anybody from a retired vet to a top-ranking Party official could be under constant threat of arrest for attempting to overthrow, subvert, or weaken the Soviet Power.<br /><br />When Leo finds himself in danger of arrest himself, the story starts to twist, and together Leo and his wife struggle against the very system that he once obediently and willingly served.<br /><br />Leo and his wife are obsessed with solving a string of murders and this gruesome case soon becomes a cause they are both willing to die for.  \\"Isn't this the way it starts? You have a cause you believe in, a cause worth dying for. Soon, it's a cause worth killing for. Soon, it's a cause worth killing innocent people for\\" PG 393.  In trying to find justice, they were quickly forced to imitate the very system they were up against.<br /><br />Child 44 was a thrilling mystery, love story, and horror story all in one. Even though parts of it were sickeningly gruesome, I found it hard to put it down. I have already recommended this book to many friends, and look forward to subsequent novels from this author.
0765316978|4.0|John's work on the latest installment in this universe delivers on the promise made in Old Man's War.  The whole of human entry in a hostile universe is held in the balance with a desperate set of double cross, political machinations.  Scalzi's very likeable, irreverent characters must shepherd a new human colony (named Roanoke) through a ban imposed by a monolithic alien alliance.<br /><br />His development of the Obin, the teenage charge of his two protagonists and the politics of the human empire are fist rate.  Shades of Heinlen and Asimov creep into the well written text.  The novel continues to introduce new technology, societal concerns and interesting ethical dilemmas.<br /><br />I found Scalzi's style getting better with each page and the twists and turns in the books to be genuinely surprising.  My only regret is that this appears to be the last book in this universe from an emerging master.
B0015519VS|1.0|If you're an Usher fan music-wise, DO NOT BUY THIS album! You will be disappointed, unless you've been a \\"player\\" reverted to a one-person lover recently, or recently been married and you're ga-ga in love right now, or you're in love competing with yours or your partner's past. \\"Love in This Club\\", is okay, but I bought the CD based on his past works and it turns out that that song and its remix are the best songs on the album. I used to think his voice could do wonders for any song, until now. I couldn't wait for the CD to finish playing. Well, I'll add it to the pile of disappointing music waiting to be taken to CD Warehouse ASAP!! I should have read the reviews first. Looks like another Chris Brown year.
0321525655|4.0|This book is about getting the correct mindset and preparing for a presentation.  It's message is that presentations today suck, and it's because we forgot to take the time to think about it.<br /><br />This book is not about design techniques, but more about the framework of a good design, and laying down the fundamentals and basics before you work your way through your own techniques.<br /><br />So in summary, if you need a book to convince yourself (and others!) to make good presentations, this book is a must - but if you're already an expert communicator - this book will be just a fun read, but likely you won't gain anything new.
B0012Q732O|3.0|Ok it has loads of flaws.....however if you take it as a piece of big dumb entertainment then i found it quite entertaining    However personally i found this film a bit to close to mel gibsons apocalypto...very similar plot and there was one scene that felt like it was ripped off from apoclaypto    but in the end dont try to analyse the film too closely it would be frustrating that way and just take the film as it is
0312360266|1.0|I'll admit, the cover looked good and so I bought it. But the overall book was terrible. The characters were so shallow, unreal and emotionless in so many ways. I'm 16, and even though it is rated for teens, you couldn't pay me enough to finish reading this book. The events were so boring and the book itself was simply a short story with a lot of detail.
B00005JPXY|5.0|I saw Cloverfield with some trepidation--I was aware of the bad reviews, and I hate bad horror films, but I love good ones so I thought I'd take a chance.  And despite all the bad reviews, I'm glad I did, for Cloverfield is the perfect monster movie.  Is it confusing and badly explained?  Absolutely--but just remember how confusing 9/11 was, even if you were not caught up in the midst of it.  What Cloverfield does so well, that so few movies even try--horror or not, is to put us, the viewer, right in the middle of the action.  We are not an invisible, omniscient watcher, we are as much as possible a participant, in the character of Hud (most of the time) who carries a video camera through the action.  Sure, it's been done before--Blair Witch Project--and to much criticism then, too.  Some people just want their movies told in the traditional format.  But to be made to FEEL what it might be like to be in these events, you just can't do that.  Perhaps it was Steven King (in his story The Mist) who first realised that the people on the ground are too busy fighting for their lives to care much where the monster comes from--and also that if a monster appears, it might not be obvious at all where it comes from anyway.  We, as the audience, naturally want to know, but that's where Cloverfield breaks from tradition (as did Blair Witch)--that knowledge is no more forthcoming to us than it is to Hud and his friends--because we ARE Hud and his friends.  And if you wonder how Hud could be looking through the viewfinder all the time, he isn't--early on the camera is transfered and there is clearly a strap that holds the thing around waist level--which is why some of the shots focus on peoples legs and feet rather than their faces.<br /><br />But Cloverfield does follow some horror monster traditions, and to great effect, especially those concerning pacing and the reveal.  The pacing (in spite of certain reviewer's comments who simply seem to have forgotten the quiet moments, as one naturally does--but they are there) is beautifully handled.  At the point when you're wondering if you actually went to the right theater, the monster strikes, and then events build to a climax, with a brief glimpse of the monster, and settle back down.  The movie continues cresting and ebbing like a series of ever more horrifying waves, always maintaining some aspect of mystery about the creature's appearance until the final minutes of the film.  And it's a glorious monster, too--knobby and hideous and alien, pretty clearly inspired by the idea of a wingless bat but unlike anything I've really seen before.  I don't buy it as an undersea creature myself--anything that big that lived in the ocean wouldn't have the musculature or skeletal structure to stand on land, much less withstand aerial bombing--but of course, that's not the point, it's not real anyway.<br /><br />Those who quibble about the acting and characterizations and the two day growth of beard puzzle me--sure, not everyone lets their beard grow over the weekend, but plenty do.  The actors were superb in their parts, and even the main character, who had the most difficult selling job--going back toward the monster to rescue his girlfriend rather than escaping--showed just the right amount of conviction for his cause mixed with understanding and concern for his friends' situation.<br /><br />Admittedly, Cloverfield isn't for everyone--if you hated the narrative style or camerawork of Blair Witch, then definitely save your money.  But if the shock of Alien made you think that's the standard which horror should aspire, then rush out and get Cloverfield now.

B0016B6ZKG|1.0|I own all of Donna's previous albums and was very excited about Crayons, however, after listening to it I must say I miss the old Donna who sang lush ballads and dance songs that entertained and made you feel good. I think this album was meant to target only the new and hipper fanbase since the lyrics and the techno music appeal to them more than the older fans like me. I'll take Last Dance or Can't We Just Sit Down and Talk it Over\\" anyday over this repetetive sounding collection. I still love you Donna but Crayons will go to the bottom of my stack of Donna Summer CD's (i.e. CD purgatory). Love to Love You Baby!!

1594489505|5.0|This is simply a book that must be read. The sentence construction is short and crisp, much like the life of the Mariam, the protagonist. The story spans about 40 years in the life of Mariam, the main character and Laila, a secondary character. The backdrop of the story is the city of Kabul and the recent history of Afghanistan. When we first meet Mariam, she is a 9 year old girl living in Herat (a city far from Kabul) in an banished existence because she is the illegitimate child of a prosperous businessman who, as it turns out, failed as a father to Mariam. Once Mariam's mother dies, there is nothing left to do but to marry the 14-year old Mariam to a 40-year old man from Kabul. And thus begins Mariam's nightmare, to be interrupted by an errant bomb that destroys 18-year old Laila's house and lands Laila into the same household, married to the now 60-year old man. Along with Kabul, Mariam's life degenerates into despair -- first by the mujahideen, who armed to the teeth by the US during the proxy war with Russia, turn their sights and US-provided weapons on the citizens of Kabul, and then by the Taliban, whose fanatic zeal denies women the right to even basic health care, leave alone education. I doubt there are many American or European -- or for that matter, Asian -- readers that have seen documentaries where women were routinely herded into the central Kabul stadium and summarily executed for negligible offenses like walking the streets without a male chaperon, even if the male is a 3-year old child! Such a summary execution awaits Mariam as well, though for different reason than roaming the streets all alone. I continue to be simply amazed at how the burden of collateral damage by the many wars in Afghanistan has been borne by the children and women, the two classes of society least prepared and most ill-equipped to deal with it. This was a sad book. When the reader is first introduced to Mariam, she is so full with young life and its resultant expectations. To see the society and culture trample on her in a manner that is shockingly commonplace for the women in Afghanistan is hard to fathom. It is worth remembering that even though what what Mr. Hosseini has written is fiction, it is, nevertheless, fiction grounded in reality (see also the Bookseller of Kabul, which I reviewed earlier and contains sad vignettes of life in Kabul.) There are parts of that book that will simply tear your heart out, and those same parts are repeated with chilling precision in this book. I recommend people to read this book, if for nothing than to pray to God for the countless souls lost in a place called Afghanistan
B0015D3Z4O|1.0|Good lord is this album awful. Sometimes it's OK to just become old and realize you are old. Madonna is still somewhat sexy, but her music is garbage. Timbaland is my favorite music person in the world, but I think he mails it in on this one. My thinking is that he realized he was working with someone old and they wouldn't notice the poop because they can't hear as well as they used to. I used to idolize Madonna before I realized that all of my favorite music should be force fed to me by American Idol. Now, there is no need for other music. I think the best song ever by Madonna was Beautiful Stranger. It's awesome and my life was really good then. I didn't even have to use a nightlight back then. That song was perfect. \\"You're everywhere I go\\", those lyrics are totally awesome. Now Madonna is just kinda old and creepy. I have nightmares about her riding a big wheel to my house and baking me cookies. I just yell at her, \\"I don't want your cookies, Madonna!! Get back to the senior center!!\\". So you can see why I give this one star. I would count to ten and hope this album hides from you.
B000P12LWY|5.0|I highly recommend this DVD for anyone who has not seen the series The Tudors and those who have seen it and enjoyed it will want to watch it again. People who are very familiar with the Tudor period in English history may have some initial trouble adjusting to the concept of Henry VIII not growing fatter as he ages, but the acting is superb. It is a fascinating and complicated period in English history and the series does an excellent job of conveying the upheaval that Henry's desire for Anne Boleyn and determination to annul his marriage to Queen Katherine created in his kingdom.
0380820846|5.0|Besides Colin being my favorite Bridgerton sibling (Anthony is a very close second), this book is one of my favorite romance novels. It's light, funny and you can't wait for Colin to come to his senses and finally fall in love with Penelope.<br /><br />A lot of people are bothered by Penelope's lack of self-esteem. I personally enjoyed watching her grow a pair throughout the story. I think her self-esteem, or lack thereof, adds to her charm. Who wants a perfect heroine anyway?<br /><br />Colin is absolutely enchanting....and watching him and Penelope interact throughout the book is delightful. Sometimes you want to smack him upside the head for being so obtuse, but even then you can't help but love him.<br /><br />I can't even put into words how much I enjoyed this book. It's not the steamiest one in the Bridgerton series (see: When He Was Wicked), but the story is very well written and the love scenes will not let you down. This book is the epitome of a Julia Quinn novel: fun, witty and charming.

B0014I4KIK|3.0|Like many of the radio listeners out there, I really liked Duffy's first singly \\"Mercy\\" from her debut \\"Rockferry\\" album. I bought the album hoping that the rest of the songs on the album would be somewhat like \\"Mercy\\", however, after listening to the album in it's entirety, I feel cheated and disappointed. None of the songs on the album are like Mercy - an upbeat tribute to the 60s, but rather are slow ballads that seem to resemble each other in their mediocrity. Even Duffy's trademark soulful voice cannot make up for the useless collection of songs. If you like \\"Mercy\\", you are better off just buying the single on Amazon or iTunes. Don't waste your money on buying the entire album.
B000WGNLLW|5.0|I waited a few months to review this album because I like to know if the album has a good 'stay' factor for me.  In fact, I love this album even more over time.  It's a fun mix of layered DD sound and dance grooves, along with several soulful songs reminiscent of Ordinary World and Come Undone.  The first 3 tracks, The Valley, Red Carpet Massacre and Nite Runner all start the dance feel but then Falling Down brings a reality check showing why DD is so versatile and talented.  Simon LeBon's lyrics are at times fun and at others more relatable.  I can't count how many times I feel like dancing my way through traffic while listening to this in my car.  Tempted and Skin Divers bring you back into that \\"I just have to move and sing along\\" feeling.  If you ever get a chance to see this album performed live, you'll love it even more.  Enjoy RCM !!!

B0015519VS|3.0|If you are looking for a confession on this CD you won't get it. Sometimes love can either make or break your creativity. In this case, Usher being \\"in love\\" was to his disadvantage. Throughout the CD you know that he is in love, but lyrically and musically it doesn't come across as strong. Lyrics are typical and the music is weak. This may have been a rushed project for him. There are some exceptions on certain songs like #8 and #13 which are my favorites. I never did like \\"Love in this Club.\\" It sounds like another song I know, but the video makes the single sale in my opinion. I doubt if anybody will be buying the entire CD in MP3 format, they may just buy a few songs and that's it.
B000GIXEIG|1.0|This was seriously one of the worst films I've seen, and I've seen \\"The Curse\\" with Wil Wheaton.  There is no continuity with accents, character, and least of all the story of Beowulf.  The only thing this movie has in common with the poem is that there is some guy named Beowulf and some guy named Grendel.  Grendel is not at all meant to be a sympathetic character.  He is a _monster_, not just a big man.  There is no mention of Odin or Valhalla in the poem.  There are absolutely NO sexual themes in the poem, something from which many a modern storyline could learn.  These themes do not make a story better, and it is quite clear that they forced this down our throats with the addition of an entirely new character just to be some kind of horrible, awkward \\"love\\" interest.      The poem aside and taking this as an independent story, it's awful.  It's four-monkeys-at-one-typewriter awful.  It's almost \\"Galaxy of the Dinosaurs\\" awful.  And if the story wasn't bad enough already, they decided to throw in the F-bomb a few times for NO REASON.  Look, I bought this movie because of the reviews on this site, hoping for something that vaguely resembled the only worthwhile poem that has ever been written.  And understandably there is no way to do the poem its full justice, but I was hoping for at least a fun story that was well-written.  This catastrophe of a movie was much more of a disappointment than I was expecting.    I'll give it this though:  the landscape was pretty.

For myself this product is awesome, I work a job that involves almost no mental involvement but pays well, so this Moleskine Music note book is great for working on daily solfege and composition projects. 8 stave's is more than enough, but I recommend a .04mm pen instead of pencil as pages smudge with pencil....just remember to wait for the ink to dry before closing the book.
B000RZIGVS|4.0|STNG fans will be hard pressed to tear themselves away from their DVD media players with this one!  All seven STNG seasons plus some great interviews and how-they-did-it extras are in this one package.  The STNG-feel of the DVD user interface adds a wee bit of ambiance, and evolves as the show evolved: getting better and better with every season.  The quality of the video and audio is excellent.  To top it all off, NO COMMERCIALS ;-)    I'd have given the STNG Complete Series 5 stars had the set come in a higher quality container.  Borrowing a line Michael Dorn delivered so eloquently as Worf in \\"Qpid\\", \\"I am NOT a marry man....\\" when it comes to the packaging.  The individual, unmarked plastic trays are taped together into three bricks.  Functional, but it gives the set a cheap feel, and makes it a bit tricky to find particular episodes you'd like to watch.  You have to flip through the trays to look at the disks themselves to see what episodes are provided by each disk.  Each disk is very well marked, though, showing which season, disk in the season, and episodes you can find on each disk.  The date each episode first aired is also provided with each episode's name.  There is a poster that describes highlights of each season, but it doesn't provide an episode-by-episode-by-disk listing.  The packaging for the original Star Trek series and seasonal packaging for STNG look far superior.  If you don't care about how the packaging looks or the lack of exterior clues to what you can find on each tray, this complete series is for you.  It's compact, and does protect the disks as well as such CD/DVD plastic trays usually do.      So.  If you just want to get your hands on the complete set without caring about what the set looks like on your shelf, you'll find the STNG Complete Series completely satisfying!
0060557818|4.0|A review by Hank Wagner, co-author (with Christopher Golden and Stephen R. Bissette) of the upcoming Prince of Stories: The Many Worlds of Neil Gaiman, due out from St. Martins in October 2008:<br /><br />Richard Mayhew has resided in London for three years, and, on the whole, has found it an enjoyable place to live.  After all, he has good friends, a decent job, and Jessica, his lovely fianc&eacute;e.  One evening, on his way to a formal dinner he is not especially eager to attend, a young woman collapses on the sidewalk in front of the couple.  Apparently homeless, the woman is bleeding from deep cuts on her arm and shoulder.  Ignoring Jessica's pointed suggestions, he refrains from calling the police.  Instead, he carries the woman to his apartment, leaving his irate fianc&eacute;e to attend the dinner without him.<br /><br />The young woman, who goes by the unlikely name of Door, is the sole survivor of a brutal attack on her family, perpetrated by Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar, two wicked creatures who take pleasure in inflicting pain and death.  Richard helps Door locate a friend, the Marquis de Carabas, who takes her from the apartment before Croup and Vandemar can find her there.  Richard is puzzled by these events, but, as the hours pass, they seem less and less real, more like a fantasy he concocted to create excitement in his life.<br /><br />He returns to work the next day to find that no one notices or acknowledges him.  Richard becomes a non-entity, invisible to all but the closest scrutiny--no one, not even his fianc&eacute;e or best friend, recognizes him.  His erasure is so complete he ends up unemployed and homeless.  Tracing this dilemma to his encounter with Door, Richard seeks her out, eventually discovering the world that exists under the streets of London, a world inhabited by such colorful personages as the Lord Rat-speaker, a female assassin called Hunter, and a fallen angel named Islington.  Richard assists Door in her search for the man who ordered her family killed, and eventually discovers the terrible secrets behind their deaths, secrets that threaten the very existence of London Below.<br /><br />Brash, charming, funny, and edgy, Neverwhere is Gaiman's novelization of the television series that he wrote for the BBC in the early nineties, his chance, as he has stated, to do things on the page that he wasn't allowed to do on the small screen, expanding on his intriguing concept of a world that exists beneath our own.  Featuring covert social commentary, unforgettable characters, a unique setting, sudden violence, heroism and villainy, Neverwhere in its final literary form (the US version is significantly different than and far superior to its UK predecessor, featuring almost 10,000 words not in its previous incarnation) is yet another of Gaiman's modern classics, far surpassing the television series that provided its origin, and spawning a comic book adaptation and discussion of a future feature film version.lly discovers the terrible secrets behind their deaths, secrets that threaten the very existence of London Below.

B0013FXWX8|3.0|DreamWorks Animation once again produces a computer animated film that contains topnotch animation, plenty of comedy, and recognizable celebrity voices. Kung Fu Panda also has a generous helping of heart, and Jack Black's voice performance manages to be exceedingly entertaining instead of generally annoying, as some of his live action routines tend to become. With martial arts action, adventure, and jokes for both children and adults, Kung Fu Panda is worthwhile family entertainment.<br /><br />\\"There is no charge for awesomeness,\\" states the all-powerful Panda warrior Po, as he dreams about fighting droves of enemies and defending his home, the Valley of Peace, with unmatchable martial arts skills and esprit de corps with his battling companions, the Furious Five. But when he awakes, Po (Jack Black) is nothing more than a clumsy and overweight panda noodle vendor who is destined to serve the valley the finest meals with his father (who is a goose). Po yearns to learn kung fu and help save his people by doing battle against all who threaten their way of life, but as his father continually reminds him, it is not his destiny.<br /><br />Fortunate circumstances change everything one day when Po journeys into the city to watch the sage Master Oogway finally choose the legendary Dragon Warrior, prophesied to defeat the vile Tai Lung, a rogue warrior who has been locked away for years. The candidates are the legendary Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Mantis (Seth Rogen, who seems to be in every animated film this year), Viper (Lucy Liu), and Crane (David Cross). When Po accidentally crashes into the arena via fireworks strapped to a wooden chair, Oogway pronounces the unconscious panda as the mighty Dragon Warrior. Shocked and thrilled, Po joins the five skeptical warriors in the Jade Palace as they train to battle Tai Lung, who recently escaped from an inescapable prison stronghold. But the greatest kung fu teacher Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) is outraged at Oogway's decision to leave the city in the hands of the unskilled panda. It will take everything in Po's power to live up to the designation bestowed upon him, and to prove that even a chubby lummox can master the martial arts.<br /><br />Kung Fu Panda is another technically superior achievement for DreamWorks Animation, utilizing some of the best computer graphics and animators available.

B0011UBDTK|4.0|This show is one of my all time favorites! The packaging on this set is so pretty and gives the show the display it requires. Unfortunately, like other reviewers a disc in season three was messed up. Luckily for me, only one episode wouldn't play compared to the multiple episodes other buyers can't get to play. Other than that, it was well worth my money!!
0060920084|2.0|Bill Bryson drives aimlessly around America by himself and complains. Not his best work. Anyone who tucks into chicken fried steak every night doesn't get to critique restaurants. If he bothered to study about any culture other than Anglo-American, he might enjoy some of the areas he traveled through. He manages to use racial terms I honestly have not heard in three decades.
B000TGCR3I|4.0|I truly enjoyed this film. Tekkon Kinkreet is one of those films that can be watched over and over again and is definitely a lot deeper than first appearances show. Treasure Town is presented as an amalgamation of diverse peoples and ideas, a natural juxtaposition of images and contexts. The subsurface story of the film deals with a base duality of light and dark that is echoed throughout the film, an exploration of ideological contrast and dependency inside of a morally ambiguous surrounding context. The structure of the story is somewhat simple, but thankfully the content is joyfully and cohesively complex.     Saying all that, I do have some reservations about the film. As I mentioned earlier, the story is a bit cut and dry for me, though I do feel that the characters and the complexity of the symbolism make up for that somewhat. The ideological anthropomorphism of the \\"nature of progress\\" subplot was a little simplistic, a possible consequence of the secondary animal identification of certain characters within that particular context. This symbolic layering and its effect on character interaction is a fun thing to watch play out, but sometimes the foreshadowing could get a little bit thick.    Overall, Tekkon Kinkreet was a great watch. I totally recommend it.

0786948523|1.0|I have been playing DND since good ole first edition and every one since up to nad including 3.5...so there was some excitement about the new system. In terms of pure roleplaying this new edition was going to either rock or blow chunks as it was quite different. I am reviewing the system in the terms of the roleplaying aspect(What DND is supposed to be) and not as any other game type. The end result....yup you guessed it...a huge step backwards.    Gone is the incredible detail of characters that is the trademark of DND and in place is now AT WILL POWERS...or more simply...DND for Dummies. The true flavor of being a character is gone and now there are powers that remind you of playing a video game or an even better comparison...a Miniatures game! The Monster Manual shows the creature(The artwork is the one huge plus in this edition, but I dont buy games just for art) and the stats...which have symbols....very much like the minis game. The feel is hack and slash and the idea that you add half your level to attack...crazy no matter the class. I do like that there are 30 levels now, but to breadk them up into 3 tiers...no need.     All in all our gaming group is staying with 3.5 and we will be fine with that...sad really....this is the first DND system we will not switch to. Different can be good, not just this edition. Too bad WOC listened to the online gamers instead of the true source of money (The Pure PRGers).    As a side note, If I were going to rate this system as part of a minis game with the touch of roleplaying thrown on top of it....I think it is quite good. Similar to Battletech minis and adding the Mechwarrior RPG on top of it. It is simple and has clear and limited choices for advancement...all good for minis games....not RPGs.    Any hope of a real RPG...say 4.5?
B000WCDI64|5.0|This just came in the mail for me today and I was ecstatic because I already knew what to expect ---><br />not only because I'd watched clips from it on youtube, but because I know the powerful voice that Amy has.<br />And of course, it was amazingly incredible and I could barely contain myself the whole time. It's so incredible.<br />But you can't mix the two factors of it ---> don't mix the person with the voice. In a respectful response to one of the previous reviews, I must say that I agree to a certain extent. It is really hard to watch if you're only watching it to see what a wreck Amy's life is. It's hard to see that and not feel anything.<br />But if you can listen to her music objectively, from a stand-point of 'I want to hear great music and Amy produces great music', then this dvd would be perfect for you &lt;3
B0018CAAN6|2.0|I am a huge Madonna fan and couldn't wait to get my hands on some Hard Candy. The song \\"4 Seconds\\" was all over the radio and I was hooked. And the first listen through the CD, it was as good as I hoped it would be....    But then came the second and third plays...instead of getting better and better the more I listened to it like Ray Of Light and Confessions On The Dance Floor did, this CD just fell flat. Why? Nothing of substance in the lyrics. The beats on most songs are just generic like anything you hear on the radio now. \\"4 Seconds\\" is still catchy, as are a couple of others (\\"Give It 2 Me\\", \\"Miles Away\\") But some are just painful and annoying (\\"Incredible\\" is anything but...)    Madonna must be saving her good stuff for her next album, as this was merely a called-in CD to finish out her contract with Warner Bros. before moving onto her huge deal with Live Nation...at least I hope she is!
B00007KQA3|3.0|3.5/5 - Beautifully crafted sets and spectacular acting are marred by an inability to grasp some of the most important concepts in the novel. Particularily the Novels final, perhaps most crucial chapter.    ***Be forewarned I will deal with spoilers of the novel from here-out to illustrate my point.***    I will begin with the single most important concept this film does not deal with, and that is the novels final and most important Chapter. Nineteen Eighty-Four the film almost completely ignores this final chapter. The Bookdoes far more to explain the aftermath of winstons treatment, and this is crucial to our understanding. Granted, the Books end can be perceived very different between individuals. I personally found it redeeming and hopeful of the future. The party meant to stamp the emotion, cognitive ability, and love right out of winston. Instead, they taught him how to really love, think about the world around him, and feel good natured emotion. To become a better man. The Ministry of Love had created in all their efforts exactly what they were trying to destroy. The party was falliable. It might fall, but Winston felt great gratitude towards Big Brother for teaching him these things. Winston loved Big Brother for it. Not in the way the party intended, but would he rise up against them? I do not know. The film did little to express the ideas of this chapter, and I would have had no way of formulating this idea of the novels conclusion based on it. I do not believe any viewer could come to an accurate conclusion of their personal theories of the novels final chapter based on the film. Some changes may always be necessary, even if just for keeping the running length below 3 hours, but this final chapter IMO needed to be shot word for word, scene for scene, in order, with every action maticulously displayed. The film even leaves out the crucial 'I betrayed you' comments by Winston and Julia to each other.    Many other small situational contexts were changed throughout, such as the timing of events, and characters involved. George Orwell set out events in the Book in a particular order for a reason. The changing of the timing of these events blurs the ideas a little, but not to the point of serious detrement. The film does however, botch up dealing with the Brotherhood. Little mention is ever made in the film about the Brotherhood. It was my interpretation that the Brotherhood was organised and controlled by the party. An ultimate form of control. Consider the line in the book referring that the party makes the revolution to establish the dictatorship. None of this was touched upon in the film. Winston does not bring Julia to see O' Brian, and the conversation between the three does not take place in the context of the Book. In fact, a viewer who has not read the Book may not even grasp that O' Brian is claiming to be part of the Brotherhood at all.    There are numerous other little changes I will not touch on. These two are the most important, and most detremental to a film that is among the greatest ever made in the fields of acting and cinematography/directing. The scenes involving a crowd watching the telescreen are classics of cinema.    So my verdict? Do not see this movie if you have not read the book. You will not get an acurate representation of the most important concepts with which to formulate an understanding of the material. Even Winstons time in the Ministry of Love is portrayed on a level minimal to the length of coverage given in the book. Read the book, then see the movie for it's artistic merits and to understand from what direction it was made, filling in the various holes from your previous reading. As a film not based on prior material, it would be one of the greatest films ever made, but it is based on a book, with ideas that crucially must be represented here. Some of the most important, are not.
B000ZOXDFA|4.0|Long anticipated part three of the Queeen Elizabeth trilogy is finally out there with beautiful Kate Blanchett in the lead role.  Film focuses on the time in British history when Spain, the most powerful country in Europe, attempts to invade Britain in the name of the Catholic faith.  The premise film makes is that Spanish are using Mary, Queen of Scotland, as a bait for Elizabeth to give Spain a reason for invasion.  Important favorite at that time of Elizabeth's reign is Sir Walter Raleigh, who ends up marrying her favorite lady-in-waiting Bess.  Film attempts to cover many aspects of that time: clash between catholic and protestant faith, conflict between liberty and inquisition, Elizabeth's internal struggle between her duty as a queen to her country and her own need for love and loyalty of the man. One constant about all films about this fascinating queen is that she was strong, wise and dedicated ot her service toher people.  Her sense of duty and leadership overrode principal requirement of the time - to marry another prince and create political alliance with another strong European royal powerhouse.  She has managed to deliver prosperity to England and help protestanism establish its roots there.  She has redefined history as a woman, ruler and a political figure of her time who was able to control church, her court and her royal subjects with her wit alone.  However, the full acting credit in this film should go to Samantha Morton in her role of Queen Mary.  Ms. Morton has delivered wonderful depiction of the queen who dies for her faith and her belief of what is righteous life and reign ought to be.

B000X3SZLU|5.0|This has not been mentioned in any of the reviews but the DVD version (not BlueRay disk) is recorded in PAL (European) format, not NTSC (US) format, and most DVD players in the US refuse to play it.  It plays OK on a laptop but who wants to watch a concert on a laptop.  I was about to return the DVD but upon researching on the internet, decided to buy the [[ASIN:B000N254LU Philips DVP5982 1080p Upscaling DVD Player]].  The DVD player plays this DVD beautifully and also up-converts it to 1080p for my 46\\" SONY HDTV using a HDMI cable.  The concert sounds and looks great!    I am not yet ready to commit to a BlueRay Player or a PlayStation 3, so the upscaling DVD player fills the gap beautifully.  There is very little noticeable difference between a upscaled DVD and the real thing.

B0011UF79C|5.0|I showed this to 5 classes of freshman Biology students, and on the whole, they loved it.  Some of them had a hard time following the story, but I think that had more to do with their two-second attention span than it did with the quality of the story.<br /><br />As one student pointed out, the movie is an odd mix of the 1950's and the future.  It is artfully done and imaginative, and still contains enough ethical substance that we can hold a decent conversation.  Just the fact that I could still enjoy it after watching it 5 times in a row says something for its entertainment value.
B0012E6R3W|5.0|Testament. Somehow left out of the Big 4 of Thrash, they released a handful of classic albums in the late 80's and early 90's, creating a trademark sound of fast riffing and complex, beautiful solos at the hands of axeman Alex Skolnick. After the decent but different The Ritual in '92, Skolnick leaves the band and they fall off the map. After making a slight comeback in '99 with the groove/thrash/death masterpiece The Gathering, Testament once again fell off the map.    9 years later.    After hearing the news that Alex Skolnick was once again joining his old band after expirimenting with jazz and other genres, it was clear Testament was back for real. The Live in London CD/DVD from '05 (with Skolnick on lead axe) gave hope, and finally in '08, hope was no longer needed. This new effort features not only Skolnick back on lead guitars, but Testament mainstays Chuck Billy on vocals and Eric Peterson on rhythm guitars, original bass player Greg Christian and ex-Slayer drummer, Paul Bostaph.     Every song on this album is fairly unique and I think it creates a decent blend of Testament's whole catalouge. We've got The Gathering-esque tracks (TFoD), Low-esque tracks (The Evil Has Landed, Killing Season), the closest thing to a The Ritual-esque track (Afterlife) and of course, The Legacy/The New Order/Practice What You Preach/Souls of Black-esque tracks (More Than Meets The Eye, Henchmen Ride, The Persecuted Won't Forget, F.E.A.R.) In fact, the bridge riff from Henchmen Ride sounds like it's been torn straight out of the mid '80's. Every member of the band sounds great as well, some more than others however. Obviously, Skolnick sounds great. For those of us diehard Testament fans, his solos are instantly recognizable and definitely welcome after 3 albums without. He also wrote the song F.E.A.R. entirely on his own. Peterson inputs some great songwriting as usual as well as his spectacular rhythm playing and even a few leads. Chuck Billy... This man deserves special mention. Not only does he possess a beast-like size and appearance, he's got a beast-like voice to back it up. After a battle with cancer in the early '00's, Billy sounds better than ever here. That's right. Chuck Billy is so beastly, he beat cancer. He mostly sticks to the classic '80's melodic singing style that made him great, but occasionally blends in the '90's death growls and does it well. (Listen to the end of F.E.A.R.) Christian and Bostaph don't shine on this one, but they aren't supposed to. There are some nice drum fills and the bass can be heard rumbling in the background occasionally, but nothing standout. Even the rhythm-heavy closer, Leave Me Forever, is just good, not great.    In the end, Testament have created a great album, tapping their old thrash metal roots in the process. Nowhere near as groovish as Low (probably due to a return to E tunings on the guitars, unlike many other \\"thrash comebacks\\" ie. Slayer's Christ Illusion or Exodus's last few albums) or as deathish as The Gathering, The Formation of Damnation blends everything Testament has ever done. Even though the production is crystal clear, it's the low point of the album. (A testament to how great the album is overall... no pun intended) The bass could definitely be louder and some solos are too quiet, but otherwise, it's all good. Past, present and future are all looking good for the mighty Testament.
0765348780|5.0|Gardens of the Moon is the beginning to a series that is epic fantasy at its finest. He took what Tolkien did, with his ideas of intelligent species co-inhabiting a world, and became the first I have seen to TRULY expand and master the concept. Erikson creates so many grim, suspicious, and mind-blowingly powerful characters in this book and the ones that follow, that the introduction and focus on Ganoes Paran in this book provides a much needed contrast.   For all of those who have become bored with a repetitive, unchanging genre (unfortunately symbolized in my mind by RA Salvatore), this series provides a welcome relief and carries my strongest recommendation.
0393327345|3.0|Chuck Palahniuk's novel \\"Fight Club\\" has become a cult classic since it was published in 1996.  A controversial novel from the start, it has been debased as pretentious and trashy by some critics, and hailed as a masterwork by others.  Whatever the case, \\"Fight Club\\" has become culturally significant enough to merit a reading no matter how pretentious you think it might be.    For its size, the plot of the novel runs pretty thick.  It involves a sort of existential love triangle, philosophical musings on anarchy, and the infamous underground fight club which gives the book its name.  The unnamed narrator has insomnia and is told to visit various support groups for ailments ranging from testicular cancer to blood parasites to see how bad it really can get, and develops an obsession with death.  Somewhere along the way he meets Marla and Tyler, renders fat into soap, and starts fight club and a terrorist group aimed at destroying corporate America, culminating in an epic confrontation on `the tallest building in the world.'      The plot moves along at a fast pace due to Palahniuk's minimalist, to the point writing style.  This `pop art' style can be thrilling to read but a little unfulfilling to the reader wanting more depth of language.  In fact, the prose is quite ugly, and seems rather testosterone driven, but I have seen critics hail the style as reactionary, as well as some who claim that it's just poor writing.      One thing that did seem a little over the top, though, was the faux-Nietzschean philosophical ramblings of Tyler.  I can only assume that he was supposed to inspire a profundity in the reader, but it all seemed rather contrived.      \\"Fight Club\\" is an efficient piece of fiction that is fun to read.  It only takes a few hours to get through so it couldn't hurt to pick it up and give it a shot.  Maybe you'll find something about his language more profound I was able to.

014303961X|5.0|I picked up [[ASIN:1593082398 Lady Chatterley's Lover (Barnes & Noble Classics Series) (Barnes & Noble Classics)]] from Amazon for $6.95.  In the absence of an available Everyman's Cloth Edition, the B&N is likely the way to go.  In terms of supplemental material it is quite comparable to this: ([[ASIN:014303961X Lady Chatterley's Lover (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)]]).  These materials are:   1. Brief Author bioptic   2. Chronology   3. A lengthy (23 pages) and diverse Introduction by Susan Ostrov Weisser, a well credentialed professor of English at Adelphi University (NY).   4. Brief footnotes to explain slang / obscure terms   5. Thorough Endnotes for references (9 pages)   6. Brief comments by thirteen well known writers.    7. Four provoking discussion questions   8. Bibliography for further reading.    The novel centers on the Love affair of the Aristocratic Constance Chatterley.  Unique at the time it was released, Lawrence's book, rather than condemning the extra-marital affair, Lady Chatterley and her lover, the groundskeeper Mellors, are in fact spiritually healed from their experience together. In an increasingly industrialized and uniform world, laden with class lines and arbitrary social norms; Lawrence holds that people have become alienated from and ashamed of their bodies; they've forgotten that love between two individuals can spark a sensation of life so primordial that it cannot but be right to pursue.    Originally deemed pornographic, Lady Chatterley's Lover may still shock some readers with its frank portrayal of sexual intercourse.  The sex-language is much more apparent than it is in Sons and Lovers.  Readers who have aversions to seeing words for body parts may be offended.  It is all done in good taste, but still must be called R-rated.  Likely, it will be offensive to only a small few.    Lawrence's writing style consistently flows at a level near perfect.  Sometimes there are certain phrases that frequently get repeated; some would say too often, others would point out that this is also the case in real life.  I find his prose to be perhaps his ultimate strength.    One complaint I have with this book as well as Sons and Lovers, (though it might be deemed trivial) would be his selection of topics.  He's always writing about love and relationships.  I guess I just prefer topics like Crime, War, Travel, and other general areas of life.  Just me though.  Still--quite surprisingly--I enjoyed reading Lady Chatterly.  Its frank display of love makes it relevant today; while other older novels avoid the actual act as if it were the plague.    I find much truth is contained in Lawrence's philosophy about primal instincts, his observations about industrialism, and his suggestions (however one may interpret them) about feminism (a great discussion point for this, his last, book).
0307236722|3.0|Hi, I purchased this book since it was selling as new, but when I received it, it was a damaged product.  Even though I didn't get what  I expected, I send the book back and I got my money back.  He was very responsive and very communicative and quickly in returning my money.  My only disappointment was that I ended up with no book.
B00144VBBS|2.0|Love his music, well most of it.  He's not a \\"fan artist\\".  What I mean by that is he comes to a town, does his show and then bugs out.  He doesn't see anyone after his show.  The only people I see that he cares about are his fan club.  Even then his meet and greet only contain a certain number of people.  I do support hiw work on with the troops.  But for a plain old boy from Oklahoma, I have yet to have the oppurtunity to meet him.  He is not like Garth Brooks.  Garth stayed after his shows and signed autographs no club membership needed, and he stayed for hours.  Garth realized his fans were the key.  Toby I think is close to understanding that but only for a dollar.  Garth did it for dedication.  Toby:  Where's your dedication?  Here is the best greatest hits album, and you want me to throw down more money for your music and your label and in exchange I get 1 new song?  Sorry bub, it ain't happening.  Not in my house!
B0015519VS|4.0|Now as a newly married man myself, I can appreciate and understand where Usher is coming from on this album. I only wish that it came two years ago (only cause that's when I got married).   But I do have to agree with one person's comment that said, maybe Usher should have hit people with a single that represents this cd better than \\"Love in this club\\". His second single/video \\"Moving Mountains\\" is a better representation of the vibe of this cd.   I'm a firm believer in getting your grown man on and that's exactly what he intended to do with this one. It's more about showing his emotional growth on this album. But at the same time he appealed to the young, married men who can relate to exactly where his head is at.   Overall, I think my favorite songs are \\"Trading Places\\" and \\"Love You gently\\"...But the song I can most relate to is \\"Appetite\\" as I'm sure a lot of men can!
B001ADHCV6|5.0|Being a long time fan of the Eagles, I was very anxious to get my hands on their new album. After listening to the music, I can say that this is one of their best albums; right at the top in my opinion. Although the majority of the music is more on the quiet side, there are some selections that are definitely upbeat Eagles-type rock. Quite a few of the songs have been hits on the radio already. The quality of the album is stunning. This is a very well produced effort by the Eagles, once again. For any Eagles fan, this album is a must buy. My kids, both teenagers, love many of the songs, so this album has appeal to the younger set also.
B00092ZL80|5.0|I enjoyed every minute of this music DVD.  Since I grew up during this music era, I've always wondered of a joint concert with the great 70's and 80's \\"large\\" bands.  This is as real as it gets.  If you loved listening to \\"Chicago\\" and \\"Earth, Wind & Fire\\", you'll love this joint \\"live concert\\" DVD as well, or more. Tower of Power is the other group from the 70's that I would like to see in a joint performance.

B000PTYPAC|3.0|It's nice to be on the product page of a pop punk album without seeing a whole bunch of one-star reviews from heavy metal fans. Anyway, I originally ignored Paramore after hearing \\"Misery Business\\" (sorry; I never liked that song). But I became interested after hearing \\"Crushcrushcrush\\", so I then decided to pick up their second album, Riot!<br /><br />First off, I have to say that although I do think Paramore is a solid band, I don't think they're worth ALL the hype. I think the reason why they're so popular is that a lot of freshman college guys look at lead singer Hayley Williams and are like, \\"Whoa, what's-her-name is HOT!\\" Anyway, the best songs on the album are near the end: \\"Fences\\", the mellow \\"We Are Broken\\", and possibly \\"Born for This\\". There are also a few songs that I can do without, like the off-key \\"Hallelujah\\"; and sorry, but \\"That's What You Get\\" feels like a 13-year-old wrote it. And the obligatory end-of-album acoustic-version-of-the-first-single neither helps nor hurts the album.<br /><br />Riot is far from being a bad album, but let's be honest: if it weren't for the presence of Hayley, I could easily say that Paramore aren't much different from any other emo band out there. Ah well; the album is still sure to rock a keg party.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert

B000VI6T6K|5.0|5 Tributes 5 Orignal Songs. That was Monterey pop for you right there. Jimi Hendrix played 5 tributes and 5 orignal songs... Though the greatest peformance on here, \\"Wild Thing\\", is a tribute Jimi Hendrix litterlay made that song his own and in the end lighting the guitar on fire was classic never had been done before. The sound quaility on here is stunning and it sounds like the actual concert live right in front of your eyes... All the songs on here sound great and this was music that was tottaly different back than. Some other key live tracks on here are, wild thing, hey joe, like a rolling stone, really bassicly every live track on here is just great. This is a perfect album with no flaws whatsoever. Great timeless concert buy today!
B00102F5WK|4.0|Although this has gotten some mixed reviews, I found it to be quite gripping. It can be painful to watch because it deals with \\"extraordinary rendition\\", rather vague terms for what amounts to sheer and brutal torture of suspected enemies.<br /><br />In this case, a man with an Islamic name is simply removed from a flight and taken to an \\"interrogation room\\" . He is questioned and beaten within an inch of his life, slowly and gruesomely (no, this one isn't for the faint-hearted).<br /><br />Meryl Streep is pitch perfect as someone who supports this practice. Reese Witherspoon does a fine job as the wife wondering where her husband is, how come he suddenly disappeared from seemed to be a routine flight home.<br /><br />I urge you to check out the documentary in the \\"special features\\" section of the DVD. It contains actual interviews with survivors of this practice, this torture and it lends credibility to the movie.<br /><br />The film does not have pat answers or easy solutions. It is raw, brutal and honest.
B000002H2H|5.0|along with many other metal albums of the 80s this is one that goes right with them. metallica is a great band some key tracks on here are, ride the lightining, creeping death, for whom the bell tolls. the best song on here is for whom the bell tolls. great album buy today
B000P0J09C|3.0|Full Metal Jacket shook the world when it came out onto the big screens back in 1987. It was then supposed to be one of the best movies ever made on the Vietnam conflict. I was in my late teens when I went to watch it. If you're old enough to remember this era, it was right when America was putting a lot of focus and attention into exorcising its old nightmares of the south east jungle chaotic defeat. Full Metal Jacket was among the last of the movies based on this theme to reach the audience in the 80's.<br /><br />I still remember having had mixed feelings about this movie: it was as close to a video report as was possible back then and, to some extent, it was quite new and unprecedented. The effect was that, both in terms of format and contents, it felt quite realistic and altogether encompassing. The story has the viewer involved in it, suffering along with the rookies before getting engaged on the battlefield.<br /><br />The first half of the film is probably the most noteworthy for the quality of its depiction of the US military's brainwashing of its youth before fielding them as fresh meat to the hungry war beast. Beyond that first half, and although the actors' play is top notch and some fights are of almost mythical reach (I'm thinking about the NVA's female sniper scene for instance), the second half of the film -the one that takes place on the Hu&eacute; battlelfield- is heavily impacted by a tough, \\"not-so-real\\" touch, ie, the movie was actually shot in a derelict part of London, with fake vegetation, palm trees and overall buildings. It's so blatantly obvious that it killed in me the bonding with the movie that I had felt right until then. It probably was for budgetary reasons that Kubrick opted for that movie location, but to this day, I still don't understand why he did not go for the Philippines, or Thailand for instance. With that \\"little\\" correction, the movie would certainly have ranked, in my opinion, among the Top3 best Vietnam conflict movies ever made along [[ASIN:B000050HNS Apocalypse Now [Region 2]]]and [[ASIN:B00005V4V4 The Deer Hunter [Region 2]]]B000050HNS Apocalypse Now [Region 2]]]and [[ASIN:B00005V4V4 The Deer Hunter [Region 2]]]
B0000DZ3IG|4.0|Enjoy the music from bluesy sound to jazzy fun songs. We enjoyed the movie, so we wanted the CD because of the music.
B000LXH0AY|5.0|I a musical with teeth that will bite. The movie will put you in places that the averge person don't want to know about or ever go. To put it simply it's real life with some singers.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|I love this album.  Madonna is one of my heroes;  about my age - well OK, maybe 2 years younger if I'm totally honest :(    ......but sounding and looking better than most the \\"stars\\" half her age.  I listened to 4 Minutes over and over under headphones, it's a great track and I'd have bought the album just for that, but surprisingly I like most of the rest too.  The collaborations work well.  She gets better and better.  I just need an excuse to dance to it - I wonder if the AARP has discos?
B00104QSOM|5.0|By far this was the film of the year. The performances of Daniel and the Director were amazing. We as the public rarely get to see a movie that actually is fully casted with performers that make you believe that this is who they really are. This movie accomplished this, the last was Sideways. If you want to experience life at the turn of the century, you can with this film.
B00133KFGW|5.0|This was a great movie.  I liked it very much. Yes the world is not so nice, how some people can still survive is appealing to me.This young man is outstanding and I really enjoyed his ability to feel and express the joy he felt for and with music.
B00004Y6O9|4.0|When Van Halen hit the record stores and airwaves back in 1978 it was truly something unique.  Today there are hundreds of guitar wizards out there who have copied Eddie Van Halen's style, but back in the day there was no one else who sounded like this band.  I never really became a Van Halen fanatic over the years, but I have a lot of their stuff and have always enjoyed pulling the albums out for a listen now and then.  This their debut remains one of their all time best in my opinion.  The album spawned 4 hit singles but with the exception of \\"Runnin With The Devil\\" it is the lesser known songs that I think are the best here.  \\"I'm The One\\", \\"Atomic Punk\\", \\"Ice Cream Man\\" and \\"On Fire\\" are my fave's here.
B0014KD46W|2.0|Like the other reviewers above, I was unimpressed by this album, which just seems like \\"product.\\"  It is frankly boring, with a sameness to the sound of the tracks which nearly put me to sleep.  Although Winwood has never been a strong vocalist or lyricist, his efforts here are frankly dull.  Is he just riding the little blip in popularity caused by his recent appearances with     Eric Clapton at MSG??    Save your money; buy the \\"Blind Faith\\" album or something else!    Dr. Bob Wesly
B0006399FS|4.0|U2's most recent disc is another high quality release.  The album starts out with one of their all time great singles in my opinion, \\"Vertigo\\" and is for the most part strong albeit a bit pedestrian the rest of the way.  My reaction to this album is fairly typical of most U2 releases.  I always like them, but they never blow me away like they do for a lot of people.  This album hits me about the same.  I like it, but don't love it.  The material here is fairly straightforward with the band not taking any major risks like they did on many of their late 80's and 90's albums.  This can be seen as a great return to form by some or a blatant attempt to pander to the masses by others.  I guess I fall somewhere in the middle.  \\"Bomb\\" is one of the rare albums in my collection where I think the singles are actually the best songs on the album.  Along with the aforementioned \\"Vertigo\\" Bono's lament about his fathers death \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\" is a heart wrenching killer of a song and another of the albums top cuts.  Overall I give \\"Bomb\\" about a 3.5 star rating.  Above average, but not great.  The band has certainly done better, but this one has enough to like about it to make it worth a listen.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I agree with the other reviews,cancelled too soon,one of my all time favs,but why does it cost so much here at Amazon?You can find this for less than 20 bucks at Target.Long Live the Browncoats!!!!!!
072325804X|5.0|This is a wonderful book and makes a truly lovely gift.  The illustrations are beautiful and the quality is excellent. An outstanding gift for any baby or child. I've bought three already!
B000YXMMAE|5.0|I started to really get into Radiohead when \\"Hail to the Theif\\" came out. I then bought all the remainder albums/singles. This band never ceases to amaze me. Every time I listen to their albums I feel as though I'm in a trance, almost meditational. The way they layer the guitar, drums,  electro-noises, beats, thumps..the captivating rhythms just echoes in my ear, in wonder how are they so imaginative and genius? Bravo! Thom Yorke, Bravo! Again! ..\\"the beat goes round and round!\\" You can't over play this album!
B000PY52EU|3.0|Watching the trailer for this film I sat there rolling my eyes! When I saw this was coming on cable, I decided to check it out. While the film has some good performances, I never felt anything new was brought to light. I could see this girl had \\"daddy issues\\" in the opening credit. I give it credit for trying to be different, but it doesn't completely succeed. I never felt emotionally connected to anyone in this film.<br /><br />The film is riddled with clich&eacute;'s and political incorrectness too. Would this film have ever seen the light of day, if the roles were reversed? A white man holding a half naked black woman captive! I can see the movie executives writhing in their seats now! I mention this only because in these times, where everything is scrutinized to the point of absurdity, it's hard to believe we would see this sort of thing. Don't get me wrong, I have no problem with any of this. I believe that political correctness should be completely done away with, along with any other censorship. Bring back my smoking cartoon characters, my stereo-typed ethnic characters, as it seems, \\"Political Correctness\\" is never going to be fair. It's only the biggest cry-babies that get the special treatment anyway.<br /><br />If you think I'm wrong, why don't they stop making films that portray Italian American's as gangsters and ignorant store/restaurant owners? or German American's as ruthless and evil Doctors and Nazi's? or Irish American's as Drunken wife beaters?.... etc....etc. We either need to stop all stereo-typing or stop catering to whining cry-babies. Censorship and political correctness is just one step closer to a very bland and controlled world. A very boring place, if you ask me. OK....I'm bracing myself..........
B000002AHM|5.0|There aren't enough superlatives to describe this performance. So I won't even try. I will say that my entire perception of \\"guitar\\" was forever changed the first time I heard this album. Not only because of the effortless 200 mph runs but moreso because thee guys can do this while paying attention to and complementing eachother's playing.     Friday Night in San Francisco is a beautiful recording with plenty of raw emotion, despite what some other reviewers have said. Once you have removed your jaw from the floor and pay attention to the phrasing, song structure, sheer improvisation, and interplay of three geniuses in their prime, you will add this to your desert island list.     Something else that I really like about this album is the way the stereo mastering has the guitars separated into left and right channels. So if you are sitting in a room with really good audio equipment, you would swear you are in the room with these guys. The sound quality is among the best live recordings I've ever heard (I've heard a lot.)    If you haven't heard this album before, I can't encourage you enough to go forth and destroy the paradigm in your mind of what a guitar can do. You'll be amazed. Truly amazed.
0452289963|1.0|Want to spend time with Hollywood elites?  Oprah, Tom Cruise, Kirstie Alley, Isaac Hayes, Jason Lee, Kelly Preston, Will Smith and on and on.  Read this book, deny Jesus, and you can get autographs, drink beer, find out why L. Ron Hubbard said Jesus was a pedophile, whatever you like while you are burning in hell for eternity.  This way to get \\"doctrine\\" out of your life is just an excuse to set your own rules and live how you want to live.  There is only one way to salvation and it isn't through you.  Jesus is the only way.
B0014BECF8|4.0|The title marks George's 25 years in the music business. But it is worth noting that, for the last 20 of those years he has, quite ingeniously, remained at the top of the tree while maintaining the workrate of an arthritic tortoise - just five new studio albums, and one of those was a covers collection.     OK, his disenchantment with the music industry is well known, but even diehard fans must be a bit miffed that the record release which coincides with his world tour is not a new collection of songs, but another retrospective.     It is only eight years since the \\"Ladies And Gentlemen : best of\\" with which Twenty Five's track listing overlaps considerably.     No amount of cunning packaging - such as dividing the collection into themed sections with the twee titles \\"For Living\\", \\"For Loving\\" and, on the triple CD version, \\"For The Loyal\\" - can disguise the fact that fans will be buying some songs for the second, maybe third time.     OK, that's the \\"buyer beware\\" message.     \\"Twenty Five\\" offers a handful of inessential new cuts (the likes of \\"Heal The Pain\\" with Paul McCartney, \\"This Is Not Real Love\\" with Mutya . . . yawn) but it is also a reminder of the gobsmacking range of Michael's work.     That means everything from the gorgeous, saccharine-tinged glory of \\"Careless Whisper\\" to the most cack-handed protest song ever in \\"Shoot The Dog\\".     It's a journey from the shuttlecock-down-the-shorts frippery of Wham!'s \\"Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go\\" to the big band crooning of \\"My Baby just Cares For Me\\", from brilliant throwaway pop like \\"Faith\\" to songs of disarming autobiographical honesty like \\"My Mother Had A Brother\\".     George is a pop everyman capable of the sublime (the cover of Stevie Wonder's \\"As\\" with Mary J Blige) and the ridiculous (the afore-mentioned \\"Shoot The Dog\\").     Pity he's not capable of upping the work rate.    [[ASIN:B000R34AJ2 Real Girl]]  [[ASIN:B000H1QYXY TwentyFive]]
0974872407|5.0|La sombra del viento siempre tendrá un lugar especial en mi vida como lectora principiante.  Ha sido la primera novela con más de 450 páginas que me ha estimulado a terminarla.  Quedé enganchada desde el principio de la inocencia de Daniel, del humor negro de Gustavo Barceló y de lo inerte del Padre de Daniel.  Por supuesto, que el Cementerio de Los Libros Olvidados me cautivó súbitamente.    Personajes como El Inspector Fumero, Laín Coubert, Jorge Aldaya, Nuria e Isaac Monfort, Miguel Moliner, Penélope Aldaya, Ricardo Aldaya y por supuesto Julián Carax te atrapan en cada página que devela sus interioridades, sus secretos más arraigados.    De todos, mi favorito, Fermín Romero de Torres.  Salpica la novela con un humor populista arropado de reflexiones irrefutables.    Lo único que le critico a la novela es que pudo ser más sucinta y menos trabajada.  Es necesario analizar muchos juegos de palabras, sin embargo, luego del análisis correspondiente, cada descripción te entretiene en la lectura.  Definitivamente una novela con una prolija narrativa basada en las descripciones:    \\"La puerta cedió como la losa de un sepulcro\\",  \\"Otra reputación le acechaba, ésta de índole menos decorosa\\"  \\"Cacatúas de color rabioso\\"  \\"El rumor de los pasos se extinguió en el rastro del viento\\"  \\"Hay peores cárceles que las palabras\\"    Una historia de suspenso que habla de inocencias, amistad, desesperanza, desamor, dolor, y maldición.  Hermosamente coronada con el renacer al que todos tenemos derecho.
B001ADHCV6|3.0|First of all, I want you to know that I have owned every other piece of work that the Eagles have ever done...right up through \\"Hell Freezes Over\\". If anyone has ever asked me who my favorite band of all time would be, I have always said \\"The Eagles, of course!\\".    I'm giving this a 3 star rating...1 for musicianship, 1 for vocal work, and 1 for production. Beyond that, I can't give any more. To my shock and dismay, there isn't one song on this CD set that REALLY grabs me. I can hardly believe it myself.    I have always revelled in The Eagles diversity in regards to their songwriting and new material, but the same can't be said here. And it's not because it's different. I can handle different. It's because the entire set lacks the songwriting filled full of \\"play-it-again\\" hooks and dramatic peaks that is the classic trademark of The Eagles I know and love. They had no problem accomplishing this in \\"Hell Freezes Over\\", so I'm at a loss to understand why the songwriting is missing here.    Perhaps they were trying too hard to be political, and lost the edge in their writing because of it. Or maybe at this particular point in time their lives are so settled that they've lost the creative muse. Oftentimes, writers' creative muse is born out of overcoming adversities and then putting them in perspective in song. Without those adversities present, the writer has to struggle to find a new trigger for their creative muse...and sometimes it just doesn't happen.    Although the shortcomings of this CD could NEVER overshadow all the wonderful past works of The Eagles, and I'll always be a huge fan and admirer, it's easy-listening background music at best. And, GOD, you have no idea how much it pains me to say that!    Buy it for your Eagles collection, and listen to it when you want to be \\"low-key\\". The price is reasonable for that.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is the best show ever.  I've seen every episode at least 5 times and it still makes me laugh every time I watch them.  I've converted several people into fans.  This really is a great show.
0156027321|4.0|When I first finished this book I thought it was your typical over-hyped bestseller with nothing to it besides cliche lessons.  After thinking about it for awhile and reading it a second time I began to understand that which I had glossed over before...the carnivorous island, the meaning of all of the animals, and even the ending.  I enjoyed the story at face value even though it was a bit monotonous at parts especially with the boring lull of endless days and Pi's eating habits.  Also, the opening line, \\"After you read this you will believe in God\\" was a bit much and I never quite believed in God even after all of the religious undertones of the narrative.  The ending was probably my favorite because it made me question whether the story was true or not...whether the frivolity of human nature kept Pi alive.  Either way it's a great story and quite refreshing.
B000PMFTCC|5.0|Your expeditious handling of my request for the Luisa Miller CD was tops!  It arrived in excellent condition and in record time.  Thanks!
0743454537|5.0|Excellent book!  Jodi has a way of making you look at a subject matter - when you think you think you have a stance on it and making you re-think it.  She is one of my favorite authors.  Well worth the read!
B000WCDI64|1.0|I couldnt watch this one all the way through. Her voice was off as if she was high.
B000YAA68C|5.0|I really thought this was a beautiful movie, you have to watch it a couple of times to figure out that it's a wonderful love story. I thought the acting was terrific. It makes you feel good to think that some one you love is looking out for you at all times...P.S. I LOVE YOU
B00005V9IJ|5.0|Aristotle once wrote that man is a social animal.  That this passage has been translated as man is a \\"political\\" animal is beside the point.  The main point is the same, which is that our lives are defined by the people whom we spend them with.<br /><br />Tom Hanks portrays a FED EX executive.  In his line of work, time is everything.  Time is what defines the parameters of his organization's business model.  After an airplane crash, he ends up stranded on a tropical island where time has no meaning at all.  It doesn't matter whether today is Tuesday or Saturday as there is no difference between the one and the other.<br /><br />What is worse is that heis also totally alone, cut-off from civilization.  His only \\"companion\\" is a soccer ball that FED EX was trying to ship across the world.  For those who think this silly, I would challenge you to put yourself in his shoes and see how long YOU would last in isolation w/out going nuts!  There is some very nice symbolism in the film when it is finally time for him to let go of the soccer ball.<br /><br />This is both a depressing and an uplifting film, both at the same time.  The movie doesn't drag on, which is one worry that I had when I picked it up.  The pacing is good and there always seems to be something that draws your interest in the story.  In short, another fine Tom Hanks flick!
B000H5V8DG|3.0|Poor product manufacturing! Had to return 4 disc's of the 29 disc set due to bad scratches. Upon viewing series (only viewed 16 disc's so far) I have come accross 2 more disc's that do not show any damage but has frame freezes!I have no idea how many more there like those untill I view them.  Amazon was good to replace the first 4 disc's (had to receive a whole new set to replace the 4 damaged disc's?)and return the old set?  The series itself is great, I watch as mutch as I can when I can (takes alot of time to watch 105 episodes (29 disc's).[[ASIN:B000H5V8DG Alias - The Complete Collection (Seasons 1-5 + Rambaldi artifact box)]]
B0013FDM7E|4.0|I will admit that I used to not care for Will Smith back in his Fresh Prince days.  Hard to believe that it was going on 20yrs ago that he was a young Hollywood upstart.  I'm all about giving credit where credit is due, so I will say this:  he has come a LONG way as an actor.  This film, in particular, required a great deal of acting ability, not the least of which because he is the only person on the screen through 90% of the film.<br /><br />The movie is kind of a cross between the TWILIGHT ZONE, [[ASIN:B00005V9IJ Cast Away (Widescreen Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B00004VVNB Logan's Run]].  A \\"cure\\" for cancer has caused an airborne virus which has killed most of the inhabitants of the planet.  Most of the rest who have been turned into zombie creatures.  A select few people are immune to the virus.<br /><br />The lone survivor of New York City is an Army biochemist (our man, Will Smith).  He is desperately trying to find a cure for the virus in his basement lab, and his only companionship is found in his dog.  He is able to travel about freely during the day, although NYC has been overrun by the animal kingdom (some of them quite dangerous).  At night he must stay locked up, lest the zombies find him.<br /><br />If you're into end-of-the-world movies and / or zombie flicks, then this one is certainly worth picking up.  It is quite a profound concept in a way:  a zombie flick with a big budget, an \\"A-List\\" actor and a very good soundtrack.
B00164KYS2|4.0|FULL DISCLOSURE...I'm a 40 something year-old man.  So SEX AND THE CITY wasn't really meant for me.  But in that, the movie (and the series) failed pretty miserably...I REALLY LIKE THESE STORIES.    I find Carrie and her friends to be mostly annoying, self-centered people...folks I would probably greatly dislike if I met them in \\"real life.\\"  Carrie, in particular, is annoying because she thinks she's deep and looking for love and happiness with a man...when in reality, possessions are what makes her happy.  Samantha, at least, is open about her shallowness (it's her need for love that she squelches).  Miranda is capable of warmth, love and openness...but she's also very controlling by nature, and this often runs her afoul of the people she most wants in her life.  Charlotte is cheery and optimistic, and essentially a very good person...she is truly capable of happiness.    (Folks, if you're reading this, and aren't familiar with these characters...I'm sorry.  But to be honest, the movie SEX AND THE CITY is not for you.  You MUST be familiar with these characters (and the men in their lives) to enjoy it or even FOLLOW it.  So I'm writing under the assumption that you ARE familiar with the roles portrayed by Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall, Cynthia Nixon and Kristen Davis.)    So WHY do I like these stories?  Well, in part because I got to swallow the entire series in a space of about 3 months.  We do not have HBO, so never saw them spread out over the years.  I rented the first DVD in the series, and my wife and I enjoyed it.  I think I liked the witty banter (no one talks that way...but I sure don't mind seeing clever people on screen), the sometimes frank talk about sex and yes, even rolling my eyes at the crazy clothes and shoes.  It always amazed me how ridiculous these women...especially Carrie...could look at times.  Also, seeing the show in one long chunk really allowed full immersion in the stories.  It was hard NOT to watch the next, and the next, and the next.    So we entered the movie full of anticipation.  And we were not disappointed.  The film (rather long) is basically 5 episodes strung together...which is nearly as long as all of the pregnancy shortened Season 5!  We are picking up with the girls about 3-4 years after the show ended.  And not everything is going well.    SPOILER ALERT:  If you don't want to know WHAT the girls have been up to, skip ahead.  Miranda is seemingly happily ensconced with Steve, Brady and Magda in their suburban brownstone across the river.  Yet, she and Steve have not had sex in 6 months...and a greater rift is waiting just around the corner.  Samantha is now living with Smith in California and managing his huge career.  He clearly still dotes on her...but she is also clearly pulled back to Manhattan and her hedonistic lifestyle.  Charlotte and her hubby are VERY happy raising their adopted daughter Lilly...but life has a surprise in store for them as well.  Finally, Carrie is seemingly very happy  living with Big...but they are not married.  A situation they decide to rectify.  If you've seen the trailers for the film...you might think it's all about their wedding.  You'd be wrong...but that's all I'm saying.    END OF SPOILERS.  So, the film lovingly reintroduces all our favorites.  The actors all launch into their roles with relish.  They haven't missed a beat.  The drama (and antics) of the movie unspool just like in the TV show.  You could imagine that the emotional stakes of the film are raised higher than the TV show...but that isn't really the case.  Yes, big things happen to all of them...but didn't they always on the show too!  Didn't Carrie regularly go through the emotional wringer?  Same in the movie.  I will say that in the same manner in which the series ended in a very satisfactory manner...the movie aims for the same feeling.  The series ended as though it were saying goodbye forever.  The movie does the same...no major loose ends.  Yes, they could make a sequel...but they don't NEED to in order to satisfy the faithful viewer.      So...all my rambling boils down to this.  If you liked the show, and would like to see more of it...and aren't expecting the big screen version to be anything more meaningful than the show...you'll be well-satisfied.  It doesn't reinvent the wheel.  It delivers.  That's a pretty good endorsement, all in all.    (And if you hated the show...please stay away.  You won't be helping anyone!  And if you've never seen it, don't start with the movie.  Start with Episode 1, Season 1, like I did.  By the time you reach the end, the movie itself will be on DVD and you can polish off your experience with that!)
B0011UBDTK|5.0|I ordered the 2007 set from Amazon last week, and despite the fact that the package says 2005 on the back, it actually is the newer one that was released on December 18, 2007.  You have to look at the UPC...that's the only discernable difference between them (even the sets currently selling in stores with the free movie ticket say \\"2005 Home Box Office\\" in the fine print on the back, but they have the 2008 UPC..i checked at Target the other day!).  There are three different releases floating around: 2005, 2007, and the 2008 release that comes with the free movie ticket.  Amazon is not even selling the 2008 version at this time so I doubt anyone will be getting the free movie ticket.  However, those of you who are disappointed that you believe you received the 2005 set from Amazon, check the UPC on the back to see which one you really have:     2008 # UPC 883929018062    2007 # UPC 026359445828    2005 # UPC 026359866128      Hope this helps clear up some of the confusion.
0061537934|3.0|I enjoyed THE ART OF RACING IN THE RAIN, a book that reminds me of the work of Mitch Albom or Nicholas Sparks.  This is essentially the story of one man's life struggle, as seen from the perspective of the family dog. The dog, named Enzo, is as intelligent as a human being, and pretty much thinks like one.  Most of the humor of the book comes from Enzo's unhappiness with his dog status, and his intense desire to be a human in the next life.<br /><br />The actual plot of THE ART OF RACING IN THE RAIN, however, revolves around Enzo's master Denny, who suffers a series of family tragedies.  I personally found Denny's story a bit on the melodramatic side (nothing about this book is particularly subtle), but Enzo's presence makes this novel more original and fresh than it otherwise would be.  The ending of this book struck me as a bit too Hollywood, but parts of this book are emotionally touching.<br /><br />THE ART OF RACING IN THE RAIN is easy to read, and you can finish it in one sitting.  There's quite a bit of crude humor in this novel, but I think most people will enjoy it.  If you think Mitch Albom and Nicholas Sparks are pure schmaltz, you will no doubt think the same thing about this novel.  But if you like short, sentimental stories, I think this book is definitely worth your time.

0785125965|4.0|When a comic is called World War Hulk, you shouldn't expect Shakespeare.<br /><br />If you expect a whole lot of people getting punched in the face by the green Goliath, along with the usual property damage, you wont be disappointed.<br /><br />The meagre plot is only there to drive confrontation and confrontation is what this book is all about. I like the Hulk as a character but have never really followed his book because it's always so repetitive, [with the exception of the fantastic recent 'Planet Hulk' story] so this was a good opportunity to grab a dose of some mindless Hulk Smash action and see those smug bastards Tony Stark, Mr Fantastic, Black Bolt & Dr Strange get their comeuppance.<br /><br />If you like big superhero battles and explosions, this is one of the better books to give you what you need.
B00004YA0T|5.0|Bruckner è sempre stato il compositore che mi affascinava di più sebbene  fino a poco tempo fà avessi sentito solamente la nona sinfonia all'interno di una raccolta della Reference Recordings. Ho successivamente comprato la nona appunto (RR) e la sesta che ho trovato ad un prezzo stracciato (Edizioni Telarc diretta da Jesus Lopez-Cobos). Se la nona della RR è veramente superba sia dal punto di vista dell'esecuzione che dell'incisione la sesta della Telarc è sicuramente superiore in quanto dinamica rispetto l'incisione che stiamo analizzando della EMI ma la qualità della ripresa e l'esecuzione sono assolutamente sotto tono!  Devo riconfermare ciò che ho letto più volte su Eugin Jochum e la sua maestria nel riprodurre il messaggio musicale di Bruckner.  Sono rimasto veramente stupito dalla qualità generale dell'incisione EMI anche considerando il prezzo a dire poco incredibile, in Italia penso sia impossibile trovare un cofanetto di nove sinfonie di questo valore musicale ed artistico ad un simile prezzo. Assolutamente consigliatissimo!
0385340567|2.0|Holy conspiracy theories, Batman!  Did somebody take James Lee Burke and tuck his liberal rants between the covers of a Lee Child novel?<br /><br />Don't get me wrong - Burke and Child are two of my favorite authors - but the venerable Burke started a fast descent when his politics began to irrationally overpower the gripping atmospheric prose of the Mississippi delta and Dave Robicheaux's hard-hitting tales of southern noir.  But if one were to judge Child solely on the basis of \\"Nothing to Lose\\", they might conclude that that he is already well down that slippery slope.  Which would be a true disservice to the author and his readers.<br /><br />So this starts out as the vintage Lee Child/Jack Reacher thrill fest, with the stoic loaner Reacher alone on a desolate highway separating the fictitious and allegorically named Colorado towns of Hope and Despair.  Borrowing heavily from Stallone's \\"First Blood\\" - and even a bit from Stephen King's eerie \\"Desperation\\" - Reacher wants nothing more than a cup of coffee while passing through Despair. Instead, he finds himself first ignored and then in jail for vagrancy.  With a provocative and mysterious prologue, and Reacher's first fist fight by page fifteen, all the pieces were quickly falling into place for a classic Child/Reacher escape to fast action and delicious revenge.  The mystery of the Despair deepened, a company town supported by a massive metal recycling plant and controlled Waco-like by the omnipresent \\"Mr. Thurman\\".  And keeping with his trusted and successful formula, Child provides Reacher's love interest in the form of  \\"Vaughan\\", a patrolman of neighboring Hope.<br /><br />But a promising start begins to fray around the edges a hundred-or-so pages in, and, by halfway through, has literally lost all \\"Hope\\".  Repeated encounters between Reacher and Thurman and his thugs become tedious - even boring, unheard of in Child's pages - as the plot meanders and stumbles through incongruities and inconsistencies alien to Child's usually credible plot lines and meticulous research.  But in this installment, while Child can still add depth and interest to a story with minutia ranging from the perfect cup of coffee to the physics of a cell phone call, he is inexcusably sloppy in tying together his central theme.  Unlike the smart, lean, and unencumbered prose we've been conditioned to expect, \\"Nothing to Lose\\" reads with all the clarity and efficiency you'd expect in a \\"Code Pink\\" manifesto.<br /><br />It's a shame, really.  Lee Child is arguably the standard in contemporary thriller/action fiction, and Jack Reacher is, as so well said by the Chicago Sun-Times, \\"...the perfect hero, loved by women, feared by men, respected by all.\\"  But not this time.  Let's just hope that this episode's muddled and confused Reacher is an aberration, and that next year's entry will return to the straightforward thrills of \\"Persuader\\", \\"Tripwire\\", or  \\"Killing Floor\\", rather than following James Lee Burke down a path that will not only cost him a loyal fan base, but also tarnish the great writing that justifiably has earned their fealty.redible plot lines and meticulous research.

B00009TB5G|5.0|First of all, if you're going to watch these films you may as well get the full story. These Extended Editions are the best for fans of the book as well as newbies who don't mind a more complicated storyline than the theatrical editions. They are chock-full of more action, more humor and (dare I say it) more plot. Even The Two Towers, in which Peter Jackson took one of the most significant deviations from the novel (deciding that it would be more dramatic as well as realistic for Faramir to be tempted by the Ring), includes scenes that give additional backstory to the multiple subplots. It's such a beautiful film that it made even me, who is normally a stickler for movies sticking to such important plot points, fall in love with it. Gollum is absolutely stunning - the amount of physical discomfort that Andy Serkis forced himself into is mind-boggling but obviously worth it, given the results.
B0014127BO|3.0|It seems the days of Reckless is far far away and back. Bryan's 11th album just follows recent laid back acoustic rock trend probably since ON A DAY LIKE TODAY. Many fans like myself want blasting rockers like KIDS WANNA ROCK. Recent \\"lack something\\" situation arises from the fact that he no longer has strong songwriting partner such as Jim Vallance (in this album he finally returned to the team on three songs) or Mutt Lange and probably strong band support in background music. He does not have strong vocal appeal from the start and huge support in any aspects is essential for him.<br /><br />A couple of songs here are above OK such as I THOUGHT I'D SEEN EVERYTHING a single cut in Japan and SHE'S GOT A WAY. OXYGEN is another brilliant song. It is OK album if you have gotten used to Bryan style since late 90s. But if you stick to mid 80s Bryan I guess you are not so into this.<br /><br />Verdict: Adult mid tempo Bryan. Showing maturity.<br />Rating: 71 out of 100<br />Recommended for: Bryan Adams fans since late 90s.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|David Lynch is an auteur known for such strange and brilliant films as \\"Mulholland Drive\\" and \\"Blue Velvet\\". \\"The Straight Story\\" is warm, tender, and normal. Further proof of the genius that is David Lynch.
B0015D3Z4O|4.0|I have been a fan since 1982. This isn't her best effort but it is definitely a great addition to her amazing library. Songs like \\"miles away\\" and \\"incredible\\" are not to be missed.
0316143472|4.0|I am a big fan of Sedaris, so I was hot to read this book and I did, in one sitting. \\"April In Paris\\" was fabulous, I will never look at a spider quite the same, however I still hate them . I found his smoking piece a bit tedious as Iam not a smoker,thus lacked empathy, but luckily it took place in Tokyo, making it a facinating and funny travelogue. I find the rehashing of old material endearing, as opposed to objectionable, as Iam fond of his family history and NYC/drug/alcohol stories so I mine them for new nuances and chuckles every time I read them. Not his best work (\\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" is), but I laughed out loud several times and  for pieces like the tender (yes, I know it's about spiders) \\"April in Paris\\", I say kudos.
0060763280|5.0|I found this book very helpful. It made me question my views about money and wealthy people. I was very open to change when I read the book, so I was willing to look into myself and see which principles applied to me and sometimes to my friends. Keep in mind that this book focuses on your thinking which defines your money blueprint. In other words, it focuses on changing your money blueprint starting with your mind. It is not a book that lists specific businesses to invest in, etc. After reading some of the negative reviews, I suspect that some of the readers were looking for such specifics. However, the title and subtitle of the book both identify the book as a guide for our minds.<br /><br />I recently attended Harv's Millionaire Mind Intensive seminar with my sister. It expands on the books principles with exercises and presents more principles not mentioned in the book. It was very informative. My sister and I learned a lot about ourselves. It encouraged me to implement some changes in my life that will be very helpful. Also, I can now identify poor mentalities from wealth mentalities within myself and in others. Some of the negative reviews of this book really demonstrated poor thinking. On a positive note, there were some really good books recommended in the negative reviews, I would recommend reading all of those books including this one.<br /><br />You can expect this book to start the change and improvement in the roots (your mind) of your tree which in turn will improve the quality of your fruits (your results). It will at least get you thinking about your actions and your thoughts towards wealth. I would also recommend that you attend the Millionaire Mind Intensive seminar. Be open and ready for change at the seminar. It will help, if you allow it to. If you don't have a reference number in your book to attend, use 638333.
0671799320|4.0|Yergin's opus is a compelling read but the plot falls apart in the paperback version - literally!  The pages start to separate from the binding before you're 100 pages into your read.  If your goal in purchasing a paperback is transportability the loss of entire sections actually makes the book a bit easier to carry around, but don't plan on lending it after you're done.
B00005K3OT|5.0|Delightfull, seductive, humorous, and bold would be the four main words to describe this film. A wonderfull story with great performences and wonderfull musical score by Rachael Potter. Juliette Binoche was terrefic, she was very adorable and so was Victoire Thivisol who played her daughter. Carrie-Anne Moss and Alfred Molina delivers a good performence as well and Judi Dench, she is brilliant as always. The film throws light on the simple pleasures of life, the life in towns in France. A film worth watching!
