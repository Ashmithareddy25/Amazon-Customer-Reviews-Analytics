B007SGM084|1.0|I bought this series because of all the hype and I ocassionally enjoy a good smut novel. They were horrible. I only read all 3 because I was stupid enough to buy them. The books were horribly written and could have all been written into one book. She only needed to leave out the same phrases that she said a million times over and over.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|very colorful. I love the ice age characters. my son likes it too. the home set ups for the animals are cool too.
B005LAIGPA|5.0|I orderend Chronicle on Amazon, very excited to see the movie again..to my satisfaction it came in the mail only a couple of days later and in great condition! thank you very much. I will be eager to order again.
0345803485|5.0|This is a great book (first of the trilogy) I could read it again and again...so hard to put down once you start...book 2 was even better.
030758836X|2.0|I read for fun and entertainment; this book resulted in neither.  I selected this book based on Summer reading lists, and it started out great. The book dragged about half-way through, but I was willing to tolerate the meandering for the genuine wit. Then it seemed as if the author suddenly needed to wrap it up in 10 pages. But wait! Why not throw in ridiculous research trivia (there is a catfish black market) and two amazing minority women! The ending was incredulous and abrupt. More disturbing to me, however, is the implication that an adulturous man is deserving of (even if \\"produced\\" by) a diabolical sociopath murderous wife. It started as psycho-thriller and ended just plain psycho.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Time just seems to fly by when playing this game!!!<br />hahaha<br />I love the concept and idea to this game and it is VERY addictive.<br />I try real hard to get 3 stars every time ;P<br />It definitely helps playing video games on my Kindle Fire versus my iPhone because the screen is way bigger!<br />I recommend playing this at least once if you've never played it!<br />Warning, it will become addictive! :)
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great summer read, well written. There were surprises that I enjoyed. The book being told by husband and wife in their own versions kept me interested.  But I did not like the ending. I felt like the ending was explained in haste.
0385342063|5.0|Really liked this book! Again Sophie writes in her unique style and doesn't over detail everything, allowing the book to move right along! I loved both the main characters and the side ones as well. Some of it is predictable but come on, what chick lit isn't? At least the story getting there is different and entertaining! Anyway, I couldn't put it down all day and it was a sunny hot day which normally I'd be running to the beach for. I loved the Shoahaulic books but liked this one even more. Keep them coming Sophie!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|really fun and some off the games are a good challenge I like that you are given rewards for completing a game
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this is a very fun game. although you can only get really far or highly upgraded by using glue coins. which you get by signing up for ads or using real money. but that's understandable because this game is FREE nuff said
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was outstanding. Another great writing from Nicholas Sparks where you are going along with the story and at the end, when you think it is going to end one way, BAM, there is a twist an it ends totally in the opposite direction. Nicholas Sparks is creative and a genius at making a story POP at the end. I can't wait to start his next book!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this app is such a blessing. I have it on my Kindle Fire and my HTC Vivid. this app is my favorite app on both devices. it has reading plan's,  you can highlight in many different colors,  and read different versions of the Bible. this app is a wonderful way to stay connected to Jesus.
B003VANOFY|4.0|It's super easy to set up and just as easy to get/update software at Logitechs website. Two things do stand out that bother me, and I'm still on the fence whether I should swap this one for a different one. When playing a FPS, explosions will render static in the headset. Secondly, it is super sensitive to having other wireless items close by. Thankfully the long charging base has a long cord and I was able to move the base far enough away from other electronics. I did give it four stars because it is still super comfy to wear, the 7.1 surround still kicks butt, and it does do it's job providing clear sound (except explosions). I would still recommend this product but beware of the flaws. It could just be my headset, or I could still have some sort of interference.
B0077ATSSQ|4.0|The film surprised us as we watched, knowing the outcome of the father and that this would be painful; but marveling at how many individual stories, such as the child's, have unique elements in this shared tragedy. The beauty of the film is exactly in its lifting out the story of an obsessive, difficult child dealing with an unimaginable loss. I found it refreshing that this child WAS annoying. Should his process of dealing with grief be packaged neatly into something palatable? I thank the directors of the film for grating us and for forcing us to realize that grief is handled in so many ways and that there are many quiet miracles and many quirky people and ways that help us heal.<br />The acting was superb. Max von Sydow and Sandra Bullock and the child were simply amazing and deserving of accolades. And thanks to the Tom Hanks character, we have yet another example of a strong, involved father, parenting a difficult kid, everyday he could. As for the New Yorkers portrayed, well, it's why we love that city and are so sorry to not be there very often. A fun addition to the film. It got four stars, not five only because it needed a sharper editor's had a couple of times.  4.5!<br />  Suzanne
B00846REIS|5.0|I started reading it and after 6 hours had to force myself to put it down. It was enjoyably raw and engaging.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This a great book to help you deal with everyday situations, it explains in detail how to deal with others, I would highly recommend it!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|um I would say this game is pretty decent but you have to keep on playing and playing and it is SO hard.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I very much enjoyed this story and was curious the entire time to find out what would happen next. The story gives the reader a lot to think about and contemplate.
0385534639|4.0|Two magicians are in constant competition regarding their techniques. They each choose a competitor, set the arena, train their competitors and then set them out in the arena until only one is left standing. This competition's arena is The Night Circus, which is filled with out of the ordinary attractions. Many attractions are enhanced by magic but sell themselves as merely illusions.<br /><br />Surely such a competition would only last one night, thus making a novel unnecessary. Well, there is a little more to the story than that. The competitors do not know the rules of the competition and sometimes it is many years before they even know who their competitor is. In addition, they are physically bound so that an emotional need for each other eventually develops.<br /><br />And then there is the circus.<br /><br />Chapters are told from different points of view in different time periods. The circus is described as dreamlike and maybe that is why the chapters jump between characters and time periods. This usually doesn't bother me, but at first I had a hard time getting into the story. The middle is phenomenal. Towards the end, the different chapters are closer and closer in time with the effect of an impending crescendo. However, it felt as if the story should have ended about 50 pages sooner. In addition, I was not impressed with the culminating scene.<br /><br />If you pay close attention and think it out, you can figure out how this story will end while not knowing the exact details. I guess I was just not impressed with the execution.<br /><br />There is no doubt that Morgenstern is an excellent writer. The writing reflects the tone of the story. At the beginning, there is a lot of jumping around and some confusion, which is exactly what a lot of the characters feel about the circus because it is so secretive. The pace is much faster and the reading more intoxicating during the middle as the protagonists' relationship intensifies. And since I don't want to giveaway the ending, let's just say that it seemed to me that the writing seemed to match what was going on in the story as it had during the other sections. I may be imagining all that, but looking back on the book, that is what occurred to me.<br /><br />I don't really know how to recommend this or to whom. I went back and forth between giving it three or four stars and decided to give it four because three and a half is not an option and three just didn't seem to do it justice. Maybe I am over thinking it. While it is not a book I am likely to pick up again, although it is the type of book that may get better with each subsequent reading, I am glad I read it.
B0025KW29U|5.0|you do not have to Have a phd in horribleness to love this movie. It is short but every second of it is well worthy of viewing. this is now my #1 favorite musical and is my second favorite movie of all time. If you love musicals you will definitely love this one.
B005LAIGRS|3.0|Since I do not go the theater (very rarely) and DVDs are released fairly quickly...well I waited for what I previewed as an action filled thriller with great actors.<br />I was soooooooooooooooooooo disappointed! Within 30 minutes I had the entire film, plot, characters etc. figured out.<br />This film was horrendously done. Yes, Denzel and Ryan are great actors (and they did the best with the script) but even Denzel couldn't save this film.<br />All I kept seeing was a wanna be Bourne Supremacy! Director Daniel Espinosa did a poor job!<br />Only reason I gave it three (3) stars is due to the acting from Denzel, Ryan and Joel Kinnaman. Without them it would have been a one (1) star.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It was so easy and I enjoyed them both. It was alot of fun reading on my I pad.I need to purchase the third one now.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I could not put this book down. I can see the Twilight Fan fiction in it if that be true. I enjoyed it and thought the characters are not totally real but fantasy is why we read:)
B004UID2LC|3.0|A lot of force closes and vidio that cannot be opened.  Average at best- still looking for something better at this point.
B005Z5F5VE|5.0|I'm folllowed U2 for a long time and love all their music.  They just keep getting better and better.  Maybe it's because they are close to my age and we're going through similar stages of life together but their music has resonated with me since the first time I ever heard them.  I also admire their activism outside of music to help make this a better world in which to live.
006198969X|4.0|\\"My seven-year-old self would throw on some jewels, heels, fluorescent bike shorts (to, you know, make the outfit more 'daytime'), and heart-shaped sunglasses and march into those meetings looking fabulous. But that doesn't exactly fly when you want to be taken seriously (Conrad)\\".<br /><br />Don't we all wish we could dress like that, like we did when we were kids and no one cared that we wore sneakers with our Sunday dress or that our our t-shirt didn't match our shorts. Sadly, growing up and learning that we have to iron our shirts makes us realize that the older we get the more important our fashion sense becomes. It's important be presentable and Lauren Conrad's book Lauren Conrad STYLE does just that with tips and advice on how to look put together and fashionable no matter what body type you have.<br /><br />Technically I would put this post on my original blog, Bee's In a Broom Cupboard, because that's where I keep the majority of my movie/book/game/etc. reviews. Yet, since this book has to do with style and beauty I felt that it made better since to put it on this blog and maybe later I'll attach it to my other blog as well. Those of you that aren't familiar with the famous Lauren Conrad are really missing out. Lauren Conrad is a famous fashion designer who made her first appearance on MTV reality series Laguna Beach and The Hills (from 2004-2009). Through these series we got a taste of Conrad's everyday life and personality as she grew for an ordinary high school California girl to a popular fashion designer who interned for Teen Vogue. Now, along with her awesome fashion lines (The Lauren Conrad (2008), LC (2009), and Paper Crown (2011)), Conrad is also an author of L.A. Candy (2009), Sweet Little Lies (2010), Sugar and Spice (2010), The Fame Game (2012), Starstruck (released Nov. 2012), Lauren Conrad BEAUTY (released Oct. 2012), and Lauren Conrad STYLE (released Apr. 2012).<br /><br />I bought Lauren Conrad STYLE \\"used\\" from amazon.com for about $8, along with a bunch of my textbooks, because I wanted to at least have one book to look forward too and having seen her book posted on her website, [...], I thought maybe this would be a nice book to get some good tips from. After all she's one of the most stylish girls of our generation and always appears classy and put together with the latest fashion. I'd trust Lauren Conrad's style tips over many other beauty tip books because she's successful in this area of expertise and considering how famous she is only adds to the fact that she knows what she's doing.<br /><br />Lauren Conrad STYLE is divided into three sections with eleven chapters. Section Fashion goes over; 1) Building your Wardrobe, 2) The All-American Uniform: Jeans and T-shirts, 2)The Hunt: How to Shop, 4) Mastering Your Closet, 5) Accessories, and 6) Getting Dressed; The Fun Part. Section Beauty covers; 7) Makeup, and 8) Hair. Section Lifestyle discusses; 9) Work and School, 10) Travel, and 11) Events and Parties. Now I don't think it's necessary that I go and anaylize each chapter so I'll discuss the ones I found most helpful and beneficial. I really liked the layout of this book and how each chapter was organized in a category. This made it easy to maneuver around the book so instead of reading from front to back I could skip around to the chapters that interested me most and then read the others later.<br /><br />My favorite chapter in this book was her chapter over Travel. I find packing for vacations and trips to be really stressful because I hate having to plan out my outfits in advance and figure out how to cram a bunch of put together outfits into my carry-on. Not only does Conrad give advice on how to pack and where to place items to give more space, she also gives examples of the best things to pack for a specific trip. She gives a check list of the things you could/should back for a trip to the beach, a week long vacation with hot weather and with cold weather, and a three day work trip. I found this step by step check list really informative and plan on using it in the future when I go on my next vacation. No more stressing over the appropriate outfit!<br /><br />My second favorite chapter was her chapter over Makeup. I LOVE makeup and am always interested in finding different looks to try. Not only does Conrad give a step by step for how to pick the correct foundation and apply it correctly but she also gives tips on how to use liquid eyeliner. There are also a few looks, ex. Smokey Eye look and a Daytime/Night time look, that she explains step by step on how to achieve this look. Her chapter Hair is very similar to the Makeup chapter in that it gives great tips on how to get wavy hair as well as some step by step's on how to master the Sleek Ponytail and tips on how to master dying your hair.<br /><br />The only thing I was disappointed about was her chapter Work and School. I found what she had to say really informative and helpful in the chapter, especially when she says \\"dress for the job you want, not the job you have.\\" I thought that was such great advice that when I realized that this chapter was the shortest chapter (maybe 10 pages) I was disappointed. This is the area of my personal fashion that I struggle with the most. I want to dress classy for my job just my job has some physical work to it too so I was hoping she would have more advice on how to dress for different occasions as well as maybe some different styles for different job types. I felt that she was so brief with this chapter, which even though what she did say was helpful, I just found myself desperate for more advice.<br /><br />All in all, I thought this was a great informative book and would recommend it to any of my girlfriend out there. There are some great tips and fashion ideas for just about any style; professional or beginner. I'm definitely looking forward to reading her next book Lauren Conrad BEAUTY and might possibly check out some of her earlier books as well.formative and plan on using it in the future when I go on my next vacation.

B0059XTTW8|3.0|I knew this wasn't going to be a thriller from all the awards it received. Having a lot of action and being fast-paced is usually a killer when it comes to art and sure enough, I was proved right. This story, based on a book and a rehash of a previous movie was done the artsy-fartsy way. Though I don't mind that, I'm a bit wary of constant mumbled dialogue, lots of captions translated from other languages and plenty of shots of the camera lingering on mundane items.<br /><br />If the story strayed much from the original or updated it, I wouldn't know because I never saw the original or read the book. My bias is not based on either. It's solely based on a fresh look at a slow-to-develop story that had plenty to like but plenty to ruin what I enjoyed.<br /><br />I must say I liked the ending. That was a big plus. Who was guilty, though no surprise, was still intriguing. However, the way the movie was edited left several threads hanging such as the boy with the glasses, the girlfriend of the rogue agent in Istanbul (a sequencing problem also) and Oldham's ex wife thread that was as confusing as it was vague, especially when played against Colin Firth's character (I think?).<br /><br />Though it ended well, I'm still left with a lot of questions and unresolved issues. Maybe that was the intent, for arts' sake, but I didn't like it.<br /><br />Why they gave this thing all those awards is beyond me. I'd only recommend this to the highbrow crowd.
B0086700CM|4.0|it is ummmmmmm ok ha ha cool I guess it needs another way to make money I need eight thousand more ahhhhhhhhh
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is addicting, fun, and cool. There is a game for everyone!!!!! I recommend this game to everyone young or old.
0345803485|2.0|The author doesn't seem to have a very deep vocabulary so you'll see words like \\"flush,\\" \\"crap,\\" and \\"grinned\\" sprinkled generously throughout this engrossing novel. Also, I lost my shit at the final scene. I think it was supposed to be deep and meaningful, but I found it hilarious!<br /><br />Thanks E.L. James for a wonderful reading experience, and I hope more 16-year-olds get their diaries published, too!
0143115014|4.0|This may be the only beauty-related book in print today which is not a mess of compliments designed to keep the authors' careers alive by kissing ass. It is, instead, balanced and honest and full of useful information.<br /> I took this book with me to Sephora and was amazed at how much it helped me understand what I was smelling. I was able to draw connections between scents that before had seemed unrelated, and I began to see more subtlety in perfumes.<br />Tania Sanchez is a wickedly funny, modern author who should have much more material available for us to enjoy. Turin is no less wonderful, but Sanchez just glitters.<br /><br />The only misstep is the number of classic and otherwise famous perfumes not listed in the book, including at least five referenced in descriptions of other scents. This is a sloppy mistake, but does little to diminish the great breadth of reference.
034580404X|5.0|This is a must buy item. I'm so glad I bought them together. I love this book and it's worth every penny. Going to the store is actually worth more than this.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The whole truth and nothing but the truth. God word will save your soul and bless you if you just believe.
B008JGSM6G|2.0|Like many others, this does not fit the screen on a droid 4, and does not rotate. Very picky when it comes to screen entry. Level selection screen choices are too small and tricky to pick. Uninstalling...
B007SPN5MA|4.0|REALLY LIKE GLENN HASARDS MUSIC, THIS DIDN'T DISAPPOINT ME!! ALTHOUGH I LIKED ONCE BETTER! HIS GUITAR PLAYING IS JUST AMAZING.
B005LAIGRS|1.0|If you have a bad case of insomnia, this movie will solve that.  It is the most boring action film I've seen.
B002QW7ALM|5.0|Really liked the story and the ending. Well thought out both in script and scenery. Characters could have been better developed, but overall a great movie.
B004GUSG4M|3.0|This book was good. There are parts when it gets a little slow and I felt that I should skim through it. The antagonist was kinda obvious and so was the ending. There were some exciting parts that happened more toward the end. I gave it a 3/5 cause I was entertained even though I knew what would happen.
B005ZUR724|4.0|great buy. lots of quests and tons of interactions. would recommend to many. lot like world pf warcraft yet simpler.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|After the ending in the second book, I wondered how there would be much left to explore in this book, but I was not disappointed. Complications and devious plotting abound from the get-go, leading you through another satisfying story of action and suspense. The two main characters in this series, Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist, are by no means perfect, in fact both characters have many flaws. But, over the course of this series, I felt I knew them both so well that even their most glaring faults could be overlooked, despite my disapproval, as one might do for a long-time friend. There are so many layers of complexity both in the story and in the characters of this series, that you can't help but be intrigued. I thought everything was tied up in a satisfying conclusion, where all is revealed, without any loose ends left untended. This was a great series and highly recommended!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|good game<br />no worries about energy just collect families and build ur island<br />keeps you engaged animals will all interact with you if you want too
B00000JLEP|5.0|This CD is magnificent. Both the repertoire and the execution are excellent. For lovers of good music from the beginning of last century, Scriabin is one of the leading figures and this CD shows why.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|This is a very strong CPU. it will do anything you ask and more. Everyone who said it will not overclock well, were wrong. I have a 2500K, a 2600K and this CPU. This one will overclock probably better. The only thing you can't do with it is keep it cool, but it is made to withstand the extra heat. It runs on a lot lower voltage than Sandy Bridge but still runs hotter. If you are going to Overclock and stress test (which you have to), invest in a very good CPU cooler. I have a Corsair H 100 and a Noctua NH-D14 and they both struggle with it, but do the job. The good news is the extra heat will only affect you during stress testing. During normal useage,temps are about the same as Sandy Bridge. I am glad I have it and would buy another.
B0083GVG6K|4.0|This series is a wonderful new addition for TV viewing.  It provides wonderful theatrical performances, songs and dance while containing a very, very good story line.  Can't wait for the new season!  This is a refreshing and much needed TV offering.  The only criticism I have is the lack of better volume in the video.  The nuiances of the dialogue require intense listening and I just could not adjust in enough volume. Thanks, bab2
B004ODLUGM|5.0|Firstly, I haven't purchased this DVD yet, but I will as soon as I can.  I borrowed it from our local library because my two older kids love the book.<br />I am pushing 40, and was drawn into the absolutely fantastic production values put into this short children's film.  Already knowing the story inside out (hey, reading it every night for weeks on end, it's almost memorized now), I was pleasantly surprised how many added details these filmakers were able to put into this DVD.<br />On top of this, there is a wonderful behind-the-scenes featurette on the DVD showing all the work that went into making this film.  And not only did the filmmakers put their all into this show, they managed to bring in top notch actors to voice the main characters.  I mean, having Helena Bonham Carter, Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid from Harry Potter movies) and John Hurt (the poor man who found out how Aliens are born) working on this shows just how seriously everyone took the project.<br />Beautifully rendered in CGI computer graphics, the main characters actually inhabit a real-life created world; that's right, the background soil, trees, rocks etc. were all made in miniature, including meticulously made leaves and twigs.  Amazing.<br />This goes to show how a labour of love can be realized with the right people helping you out.<br />And the music!  Full orchestra soundtrack - not just a synthesizer.<br />And all wrapped up in a 34 minute show.<br />Incredible.  Well worth the price, despite being a short film.  If you've read the book, prepare to be amazed at seeing the book truly and believably come to life!<br />This is one item that could stand to have more stars available for rating..it deserves a 10!
B006OE7XM4|2.0|Love \\"On The Way To Harlem\\" - it made me buy the CD.  A few other cuts - OK - but most sound like album fillers.  Porter needs direction and a producer with better ears who can help him to make stronger tune choices.  On the whole, CD is a disappointment.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|~TLDR  Buy now, and read immediately, then come back to read this review.  It is that good.  A great next step for readers just being introduced to the genre via Hunger Games.<br /><br />This collection of novellas is absolutely amazing.  Brought together here in this omnibus they make an excellent book with a fast moving story arc filled with strong and memorable characters.  The first novella (or chapter here) is especially evocative as it was written to stand by itself.  It is a potent story exploring deep emotional loss and questioning ones own existence.  The rest of the novellas are fruit of this seed story fleshing out an incredible world and its secrets piece by piece.  The writing is clean and tight with no wasted words.  You get a great feeling of the world and the characters that live here.  The story is wholly original but there are flavors of the TV show Lost and the Wasteland/Fallout games.<br /><br />Bottom line, buy this.  And rejoice that there are more stories to come since you will want more as soon as you are done (don't skip the epilogue though, after the FAQ!).  Thank you Mr. Howey and keep the stories coming!
B0002V7OI8|5.0|I know many movies try to top the previous disaster movie this one was great.  It showed the human spirit is willing to try and over come all
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Awesome read as only Nicholas Sparks can provide.  I recommend reading.  Keep them coming. Kept me in suspense the whole time.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|Not a bad story line, interested me enough to want to purchase the next 2 books in the series.  The characters develop well as the story line progresses and the sex scenes start off quite confronting but you can't stop reading... Want to say it's fantasy but maybe not for some!  Left me wanting to know what happened next.
B005K17RU0|5.0|works as advertise, like it better than the weather channel app,would recommend to everyone who needs a weather app, love it
B005LAIGPU|4.0|There is a downside to this movie, and I'll address that first, so as to get it out of the way... The high school kids in this movie are portrayed in such a ridiculous, over the top, irritating caricature of every stereotype ever conceived, I almost had to turn it off. The first 20 minutes or so of this movie is a true test of one's patience! I almost feel like the focus groups for this movie must have felt like messing with the producers, and telling them the most outlandish thoughts that popped into their heads.<br /><br />Okay, that's the bad... now for the good, and there's quite a bit of it, fortunately. After the rough beginning, this movie settles into something unique, gripping, and filled with intelligent special effects that are utterly convincing, as they blend with the \\"home video\\" style perfectly. This is a great story of friendship, family trials, and why you DO NOT bully other kids!<br /><br />What I found really awesome about this movie was how clearly it was influenced by the old anime film, \\"Akira\\". That Japanimation movie is perhaps the most influential of all animes, and its heritage is given a true, respectable homage in \\"Chronicle\\". It never directly steals, but there are clear references in the movie... if you have your doubts, compare the wardrobe of the main character during his final rampage with that of \\"Akira\\"'s protagonist, late in the film.<br /><br />As bad as the first 20 minutes of this movie is, the last 20 minutes are superb, more than making up for the rocky start. Any fan of \\"Akira\\" should investigate \\"Chronicle\\".
B006RED4GA|2.0|not a bad movie but barely keeping me interested enough to watch. i am about half way though it at this point and plan i watching it through.  dont expect anything great coming out of this though.
0439023521|2.0|I should start by saying that I'm a 63 year old male and obviously not the target demographic for this book. That said, I was tempted by this title when I first saw it announced a few years ago, but only got around to reading recently. It's a potentially interesting idea, but the book itself is disappointing.<br /><br />I imagine everyone knows the premise, so I won't summarize it. My criticism is based on a poorly developed and implausible background, obvious authorial manipulation and poor characterization.<br /><br />The background: The Capitol is supported by twelve regions, but we only learn a little about two regions, 12 (mining) and 11 (agriculture), with some references to the others. The regions have populations of about 8,000 each, and for the most part seem to have fairly low level technology, although two are described as involved with manufacturing luxury goods. In Region 12 there's no indication that the women or children under 18 work in the mines, so we're supposed to accept that well under 4,000 miners supply the coal needed by the Capitol. The workforce in Region 11 (agricultural) apparently utilizes more women and children, but it is still far too small (particularly given the technology) to produce sufficient food even if there are other food producing regions. The problem is simple: The regions are supposedly exploited and oppressed by the Capitol, but their economic value would be trivial and it's impossible to see why the rulers would bother. Put differently, they exist to support the story line, but their existence is arbitrary.<br /><br />Authorial manipulation : Since the regions are essentially prisons and we're repeatedly told about the oppression, it makes no sense to then say that the populations of regions 1 and 2 are richer or more well fed than anyone else. The author uses this supposed class difference to imply that the richer districts are complicit with the games authorities, and to set up a rich kids (bad) versus poor kids (good)conflict. In addition, the rich kids are presented as arrogant and sadistic, so killing them is emotionally easy, and Kat does not deal with the real ethical dilemma of killing innocents. Instead, her enemies are so bad that it's clearly okay to kill them. The result is that the book reads like an extended high school revenge fantasy.<br /><br />(SPOILER ALERT) In addition to manipulating the set up, the author uses what amounts to deus ex machina to further the plot. Perhaps the worst example of this is when Kat, having barely escaped a forest fire, climbs a tree to escape pursuit by four tributes from the two richest regions (her implacable enemies). In spite of her supposed woodland experience, to say nothing of her recent escape, it doesn't occur to Kat that climbing a tree makes her vulnerable to fire, but fortunately it never occurs to her enemies (or the author?) to set fire to the tree. Instead, after some slapstick individual efforts to climb the tree and attack her, they decide to wait her out by building a camp fire and sleeping under the tree until morning. Not surprisingly, this gives Kat the opportunity to counter-attack and escape.<br /><br />Characterization:  Kat is bitter, self-righteous and a little paranoid, and develops not at all during the novel. Most of the other characters are little more than roles with names--arrogant rich kid/enemy, silly condescending adult, innocent victim/friend, etc. Some of this works as satire, but the overall effect is to make most of the characters automatons or straw targets. The book is probably too violent for younger readers, but for the most part you don't feel that real people are being killed. The cardboard environment is reinforced by the sketchy descriptions of the physical world and much of the action, and it's difficult to believe there's a real world outside of Kat's head.<br /><br />I can't say that the book is unreadable since I did finish it, but I think it's main interest is as an enormously popular social phenomenon. There is a lot of better written, more believable YA fiction (including science fiction) available.
B00002N9ER|1.0|These brackets hold the flashlight too strongly.  I estimate it takes a pull of 20 pounds or more to get the flashlight out of them, and you might pull the screws out of their mounting if attached to something like a kitchen cabinet before the light comes loose.  An older person, a woman, or a child is not going to be able to get the light, especially using just one hand, a very bad situation if an emergency.<br /><br />Get some kind of tool or broom holder at the home store instead.<br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br />Addendum  July 20<br /><br />Using a piece of wood I wedged the fingers a quarter of an inch further apart and placed them in 225 oven for fifteen minutes.  This greatly reduced the force needed to release the flashlight while still holding it firmly.

I knew that I had what I later learned to be a \\"wheat belly\\" and that anything from homemade pastries to sprouted grain bread called out to me with the taunting \\"bet you can't just have one\\" so I thought I'd give it a quick read.<br /><br />The book contains a ton of researched data to convince the mind but the real proof is to go \\"wheat-free\\" for a while and feel the sense of well-being that comes from losing the emotional/physiological daily ups and downs from \\"wrong\\" food choices... I no longer get those post-lunch \\"blues\\" sitting at my desk and feeling that energy let-down that pushes me to look for something to eat to get me through the day.<br /><br />I love eating this way, feel much better, am losing inches and am so glad I bought the book because I never would have been convinced otherwise!

I read anywhere from 1 to 3 books a month from all genres from novels to comics and J.K Rowling to Tom Clancy and on occasion I'll admit I even read fanfiction for my favorite couples but this is the worst book ever.  The \\"plot\\"(and I say that in the losest way possible) is painfully slow with very little if any charecter development syntax and word choice falls to a 8th grade level.  The sex tries for provocitive but falls on its face obviously this person never invested much time into understanding the workings of a BDSM relationship and just went with the wikipedia description of BDSM.

B004I8WD6E|2.0|Finding a case for your iPhone can be a daunting task. There are hundreds (thousands maybe) of cases out there. I'm also incredibly picky. I figured I would buy a few cases and see which one worked best. I wanted to find a case that provided protection, but didn't hide the beauty of my new iPhone 4S. I decided to give this case a chance based on the positive reviews. Unfortunately, it didn't meet my expectations.<br />While it does provide good protection for the iPhone on the sides, back, and even face, it is a very bulky case. It adds quite a bit of thickness to the iPhone. Also, it had surprisingly sharp edges. They started to wear down some, but they are still there. The back design is kinda ugly, but I could live with that. What was the deal breaker for me was that this thing is a lint magnet. The top has a lip that goes over the front of the screen. This is a good thing because if you drop it face up, the screen has some protection. Also, if you lay it flat on a hard surface, face up, the screen doesn't touch the surface. The problem with that is, when you put the phone in your pocket, this lip accumulates all kinds of lint and pushes it to the edge of the screen. You end up with a layer of lint and dust around the edges and under the lip. There's no easy way to clean that other than taking the whole case off. It's maddening. That's not something I can live with. If that's not a concern for you, and you want good looking, solid protection, then this case might be the way to go. After all, the price is certainly right.

B00005JMUA|5.0|\\"Kill Bill Vol. 2\\" was something of a surprise. The first movie was some kind of slapstick-and-slash, samurai parody. The second was closer to a serious drama, with a lot more character development. I had expected the comic book splatter to simply continue for another two hours...<br /><br />Part of me was disappointed, another part actually liked \\"Volume 2\\" better. My more serious side, perhaps?<br /><br />But sure, the concluding part of Tarantino's inimitable epic does have its fair share of mayhem, including murder by black mamba, poisoned fish or kung fu. Best character: Samuel L. Jackson as an obscure jazz player, visible for only two or three minutes. LOL. Fresh out of \\"True Romance\\", I imagine.<br /><br />Otherwise, I admit the complete disconnect between the spaghetti western music and the actual plot was also to my liking...<br /><br />OK, Kiddo, I give this film five stars.
0801959543|5.0|I was totally addicted to sugar, but didn't know it. Sugar in the morning, sugar all day, sugar in the evening, until I passed out at bed time. My health was terrible, and my mood swings were legendary among my friends.<br /><br />In 1978, an ex-girlfriend mailed me a copy of Sugar Blues. I read the first chapter over lunch that day, and OMG - I had all the symptoms described there! I threw out everything containing sugar immediately. I knew I couldn't stop cold turkey, so I bought one case of pineapple juice (which I hated) that evening, and vowed to have no more sugar after that case was gone.<br /><br />Eventually I was diagnosed with hypoglycemia (another battle with doctors), and learned that keeping my blood sugar levels under control was vital.<br /><br />34 years later, I'm still off sugar and all the variations invented by Big Sugar, still read ingredient lists like a fiend, and don't miss sugar at all. In fact, on rare occasions when I eat something with sugar accidentally, I can't stand the sweetness.<br /><br />If I can get off sugar, you can too.<br /><br />I am so thankful for this book. I would probably be seriously diabetic or dead without it.

0525478817|5.0|I literally finished this book less than a minute ago and am now rushing to write this review.<br /><br />When I first heard of this book I thought \\"Here's another writer who's going to write about cancer so that even if the book sucks people will say they love it because they lost someone to cancer.\\" I was dead wrong.<br /><br />This book is about Hazel, a teenage girl with cancer that has left her hooked to an oxygen tube for the rest of her life, however long that may be. While attending a support group that she hates, Hazel meets another teenager named Augustus Waters who changes her world.<br /><br />The story revolves around their relationship with one another and a book that Hazel introduces Augustus to, a book that takes them halfway across the world for answers.<br /><br />I don't think it's possible to finish this book with a dry eye but it's worth shedding a few tears to finish this. John Green is my new hero for writing this book, he really delved inside of his characters and what it is to be a teenager dying from cancer.

1594744769|3.0|When I picked this book up I was a bit afraid of what I'd find. There's been so many glowing reviews that it seemed like a book that was sure to be a letdown. In some ways, the book lived up to its expectations, in others...not so much.<br />I must admit, the beginning is a bit slow. The story didn't really capture my attention until a little before half-way through. It's not that the story per se is written badly (although it's not amazing writing) or in a boring manner, it's just that it's not particularly original. At least not until later. When it does pick up, though, there's no stopping it. The plot takes over and it's hard to put the book down. I read the last quarter breathlessly.<br />The characters are fun, especially Miss Peregrine and the peculiar children, although we don't really get much background on any of them. The narrator, Jacob, is not quite as engaging, but he is perfectly adequate. I assume we'll get to know him much more in the books to come.<br />Surprisingly, what bugged me the most about the entire book were the pictures. By themselves, they are fascinating and inherently creepy, but included in the story like they are, they just seemed forced. As if the book had been written by drawing them at random and deciding \\"okay, so this is what happens next\\". In my opinion, the book would have been stronger if they'd been left out, or if the author had just sent us to a website where we could find all of them.<br />All in all, a fun read that I do recommend, though don't expect it to awe you as much as you think.

It is actually refreshing that one can use the background characters in this version.  I know a lot of folks are probably a little miffed that the main characters are only directing the quest or objectives.  I really enjoy seeing the renditions of the unknown characters being made into little surburan units. The artistry is very cartoony but it also shows so much of the creativity of Ice Age design team.<br /><br />Now the bad&hellip; what is with the Flintstone rip off.  You could exchange the characters from the HB series and really have a stone age adventure.  The only difference would be brown background instead of the plastic white.<br /><br />As you see,  I left it with 5 stars.  The game is wonderful you can put it down and come back to it if you like.  That's where it is winner but building ice age community like Bedrock..ehhh.

B00003CXAE|1.0|One of the worst stage shows ever remains one of the worst movie musicals of all time. Following the tradition of every desperate actor in showbiz, the film is miscast with a bunch of 30-somethings who should have played the parents. Travolta and Newton John lacked all chemistry and the remaining cast brought nothing to the picture. The only two good things about the film were the new songs added....and now every stage version features them, as if it's going to make you feel better about the travesty of seeing dimwitted adults try to recapture their youth. I saw this film when it came out and it just boggled my mind that adults would flock to a script so pandering. But then the stage show continues to horrify audience even in the 2000's and STILL the tradition carries on to cast 40-somethings as teenagers....only because people who are 60-something now go to see this show and overlook how bad the actors are because they can't actually see the stage performers up close! This is NOT a great movie musical and the film's message is \\"ladies, sell yourself out to be a whore to get ahead.\\" But I guess there's truth to this....how else to explain Kim Kardashian and her family. Paris Hilton, and any of the REAL HOUSEWIVES.

B005LAII08|5.0|Walt Disney's new Pixar animation film \\"Brave\\" has a lot going for it: astonishingly life-like animation, a plucky heroine, an enchanting setting in the Scottish Highlands, and a fast-moving and engaging story equal parts comedy, drama, and supernatural coming-of-age tale. Parts of the movie are violent and/or extremely intense; this movie may be frightening to really young children.<br /><br />Merida is a princess, the eldest child of King Fergus, ruler of an ancient kingdom set somewhere in the Highlands of ancient Scotland. The introduction shows her to be an independent tom-boy with wonderful red hair, a love for the outdoors and archery, and the angst and stubborn streak of a typical teenager. A precursor sequence tells of a dramatic family encounter with a vicious bear that lays the groundwork for key parts of the rest of the plot.<br /><br />As the story proper gets underway, we learn the time has come for her to be betrothed to the eldest son of one of the clans of the kingdom, a crucial event of state for which Merida's mother, the dutiful Queen Elinor, has been attempting to prepare her for years. Merida refuses to play out her role, subverting the betrothal process and fleeing into the forests. There, she has an encounter with a witch, who offers her a magical way out of her responsibilities as a princess. This escape comes with unfortunate and even terrifying consequences for Merida's mother and for the Kingdom that Merida will only slowly come to recognize. She will be forced to race the clock, attempting to apply her mother's lessons to putting things right.<br /><br />\\"Brave\\" has a nice mixture of action and comedy, even in its supernatural elements. The action builds to a dramatic and emotional climax at story's end, assisted by a score highlighting both gaelic and modern music. Its final message explicitly stresses Merida's right to find her own destiny while suggesting that she must also take responsibility for the consequences and for her obligations as a princess to the kingdom. \\"Brave\\" is highly recommended as excellent entertainment.ons as a princess to the kingdom. \\"Brave\\" is highly recommended as excellent entertainment.

B005LAIHIQ|5.0|When I saw that Tim Burton and Johnny Depp were making a big screen adaptation of \\"Dark Shadows\\" I was thrilled. But a little apprehensive, how could a clunky, corn ball old television show be revived and made relevant for today? The attempt at resurrecting it in the early 1990's as a television series with Ben Cross in the lead was a dismal failure and a horror, but not in a good way. But I felt that if anyone could pull it off Tim Burton and Johnny Depp could. What I didn't realize was how well they would do it. The new \\"Dark Shadows\\" is surprisingly very, very good! Depp of course is absolutely perfect as the fish-out-of-water Barnabas, released from his coffin in 1972 after being trapped in it and buried away for over a century. The culture clash is hilarious. Depp's Barnabas is a hoot, but also very endearing and lovable. The film is much darker than the trailer suggests, much closer in feel to Burton's wonderful \\"Sleepy Hollow.\\" Though some of the silly fans of the old series were hilariously outraged that the film was a ,gasp, \\"comedy,\\" they can be totally ignored and their opinions regarded as irrelevant, because nothing anyone could do with \\"their\\" show would make them happy. They should just watch the old show's dvds and stay in their fantasy world. Now don't get me wrong, the old show is fun and has a certain charm, and Jonathan Frid and Grayson Hall are great. But the show was always campy and impossible to take seriously. Anyway it was great for its time, but that was then, this is now. Burton took the right approach in revving up the fun. The new DS is what the old show would have been if they had had a big budget and writers with a better sense of humor. Frid and the other cast members of the old show were cool enough to \\"get it\\", they loved the new movie. It was sad that Jonathan Frid died just before it's release. The movie succeeds, however, largely due to the fact that Burton and Depp genuinely love the old series and paid loving homage to it. The cast is perfect, especially Michelle Pheiffer as Elizabeth the matron of the 1972 Collins family and Eva Green as the witch Angelique. Helena Bonham Carter as Dr. Hoffman is great and steals every scene she's in, as does Jackie Earl Haley as Willie Loomis. Chloë Grace Moretz and Gulliver McGrath are delightful as the Collins kids. The entire cast is great including Alice Cooper and Christopher Lee in wonderful cameos. The production values are first rate, the movie is beautiful and visually stunning, and the music! The music is incredible, maybe one of the best scores ever! The Danny Elman score is unexpectedly brilliant! And the incorporation of some great old 70's songs like \\"Knights in White Satin\\" and \\"Go All the Way\\" is also brilliantly achieved. The Carpenters \\"Top of the World\\" has never sounded so cool! Barry White's \\"My First, My Last, My Everything,\\" is the perfect accompaniment to a hilarious love-making scene between Barnabas and Angelique. It's great seeing all the 1972 nostalgic references, like \\"Scooby Doo\\" on television and \\"Deliverance\\" and \\"Dracula AD 1972\\" on theater marquees. The lava lamp is great fun! The movie is fun, brilliant and a breath of fresh air, everything it should be and I can't wait to own in on dvd! I hope the film does well enough box-office wise to warrant a sequel. It has made so far nearly 80,000,000 at the US box-office, which is amazingly good for a film so off-beat, with such a quirky sense of humor and based on an old 1960's/'70's forgotten television show! Plus it has become fashionable for movie critics to unfairly trash anything Tim Burton does. The movie will grow in popularity when it becomes a cult film on the college circuit and is released on dvd and to cable television, it will find its audience in the US. And the film has done very well internationally, world-wide it's box-office gross is close to $250,000,000 so far. That's good news for Barnabas and company and the movie is good news for audiences who enjoy aslick blend of humor and horror. Buy this as soon as it comes to dvd!slick blend of humor and horror.

They're very easy to take care of too; if they get anything on them I just rinse them off and let them dry.  I would definitely order these again, especially at this price.
B005M0R524|5.0|Excellent series And good quality DVDs. I could not stop watching it. Now I can not wait till the actual series resumes.
B003UESJF6|5.0|This flick is a different kind of show in which you can't help but root for the villain Megamind. He's not so bad once you get to know him. You begin to feel sympathy for Megamind early on. He and another baby who will become the heroic and handsome Metro Man, are placed in spacepods and sent out to safety by their parents as their home planet destructs. Baby Metro Man smoothly glides into an affluent family's home while infant Megamind's spacepod bounces and lands elsewhere. Their upbringing is very different as a result. Megamind duels Metro Man as they are growing up and hopes to defeat him eventually but isn't prepared for the outcome when he finally does. Megamind finds that his greatness as a villain is diminished  in the absence of a hero. Hmm...What to do.

B001TEAELQ|3.0|I'd known Paul Tibbets (pilot of the \\"Silverplate\\" B-29 ENOLA GAY and commander of the 509th CBG) for years while he was alive. I've also known Dutch Van Kirk, navigator of the \\"Silverplate\\" B-29 ENOLA GAY. This was one of the first WW2 military history (and aviation history) books I'd ever read, which happened to have been back in 1966, when I was 12. I'd never thought of it this way, but the men I knew in the 509th CBG always told me that they felt Hersey had portrayed them as militarists, rather than who they really were. Who they really were, were normal, patriotic Americans, doing whatever they could to help bring an end to all the pain and suffering of WW2.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|So very well written and the story that develops through the trilogy is incredibly romantic and intoxicatingly seductive.

B00321LFBC|4.0|Seriously, there are two reviews here; don't listen to the other.  If you don't want to watch animals mating then you just don't want to watch animals, because mating and food are really the only two things any animal is interested in.  This show isn't perfect but I feel I had to correct what this dope was saying about it.  I like nature docs because of the footage and these guys know what they're doing so don't be swayed by a one start vote.  Thank you.
0385344228|5.0|\\"Defending Jacob\\" is the story of a teenage boy accused of murdering another boy who may or may not have been bullying him.  But Defending Jacob is not a story about bullying.  Like \\"Law and Order,\\" the case in this book is ripped from the headlines, but instead of bearing similarities to Columbine, the story reaches out to Casey Anthony and Natalie Holloway for inspiration.<br /><br />The story is told from the point of view of the father of the accused.  It is a brilliantly written novel, but ultimately very hard to live with when the story comes to an end.  To the writer's credit, I was completely shocked by the ending.  Jacob's guilt or innocence is not clear until the very end and even then, the story isn't over.<br /><br />Again, brilliantly written and paced, but left me feeling very, very sad.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|absolutely love this Bible app! easy to use, many different translations available &amp; can easily switch between ones I use regularly. love following along with my church's lesslns through the live option. also love the reading plans, wide variety to choose from &amp; appreciate that it sends me a reminder notification to do my daily reading.
B0028R3G5O|5.0|This a great collection which of course showcases her voice.  I got this CD for Hole in my Heart(that goes all the way to China) and Goonies are good enough.  I quite happy with Hole in my Heart but maybe I was thinking of the singles version of goonies are good enough.  It doesn't sound as good to me as I remember.
B001FB5634|2.0|This movie is literally dark.  It is filmed in such low light it might as well be a radio show.  The screen is sometimes completely black for minutes at a time.  I can't speak for other viewers but squinting at shadows for two hours gives me a headache.  As for the story, I didn't find a lot here.  It's relentlessly bleak and simple.  Perhaps if I'd been able to see it I would have appreciated it more.  As it is, I can't recommend it.
1400069289|5.0|\\"The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business\\" by Charles Duhigg is a book about what motivates us.  Why do we go to church?  Why do we stay at a church?  Why do we gamble?  How responsible are we for our actions?  How do companies manipulate us into buying their products?<br /><br />Some of these stories we already know.  Duhigg highlights the story that was recently in the news of a father who found out his teenage daughter was pregnant thanks to the coupons Target was sending her in the mail.  That was how good Target's research was that they could tell based on a woman's purchases not only if she was pregnant or not but which trimester she was in.<br /><br />Some of the stories were brand new to me.  Duhigg begins his book with the story of Pepsodent and how brushing ones teeth in the early part of the 20th century went from being something very few did, to something everyone felt they had to do.  What ultimately made Pepsodent a success was something very small.  The company focused on the tingling sensation left in your mouth after you used it.  That's how you knew you teeth were clean.  It's part of the reward system that Duhigg insists is necessary for establishing habits, both good and bad.  It's also why, incidentally, your current toothpaste and shampoo foam.  They don't have to foam to work, but the foaming action gives you the confidence that it is working.<br /><br />But the biggest part in maintaining habits, Duhigg writes, is community.  Whether you are trying to lose weight, stop drinking, or go to church, you must do these things with others in order to keep the habit going.  Otherwise, you're likely to fall away.<br /><br />\\"The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business\\" was a great book, filled with interesting stories and tidbits.  For example, how Febreze could bring a forest ranger to tears because it finally eliminated the skunk smell from her home, but wasn't widely accepted by housewives until they saw it asa reward, a final spritz after they had finished cleaning.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoyed reading this series of books, but I do have to agree with others, it could have been written with a little more class and leave some parts to our imagination. I must say it did get more interesting as the books went on.

B0057R5XRG|4.0|I remember being in the theater and having tears well up in my eyes the first time I saw a dinosaur on the screen with the actors.  While those feeling came back while I watched my Blu-Ray copy of the first film, I couldn't help but notice how fake the dinosaurs look at certain points.  The movie cleaned up great and the actors and anamatronic dinosaurs are in clear HD, but when you see the CGI dinosaurs you notice a problem.  They look as though they have been pasted into the movie over something else that should've been there.  It was a bit disappointing, but the thrills of the movies and the memories they bring back more than make up for the lack of attention paid to the CGI while they transferred to blu-ray.

0765326353|5.0|I will just barely give this book five stars. I really wanted to give it 4 1/2. Wish Amazon had 10 stars. I'd give it a 9. It's a solid beginning that shows great promise for the Stormlight Archives as a whole. As others have said, Brandon Sanderson does a great job of world building. Again. Terrific ideas that hold together and do not feel overly derivative. An true achievement in this flooded genre of fantasy.<br /><br />A few things cause me to hold back...just a little. I found some of the jumps between characters' POVs a bit awkward. It felt like some character sections should not have been interwoven, but rather be told one after the other. I also found minor disconnects between character personalities, and their motivations, especially Shallan.<br /><br />In Shallan's case, her slowly-revealed background does explain motivations for her actions, BUT her personality doesn't quite show how that background drove her to her present position.  Nor did I clearly see the impact of that past on her present personality. For her to accept the course she has taken does not seem completely within her character, unless a second driver were more clearly expressed.<br /><br />The plot pace feels a bit slow, which may be why the narrative felt a little unfocused at first. This book covers a lot of ground and with the narrative split between the various character arcs, it did not always feel that the plot was moving forward. However, it was still an interesting read. And ultimately, by the end of the book Sanderson wove the plot elements together gracefully.<br /><br />All in all, the above is nit-picking. I'm just stating a few thing that would, for me, move this book from one of the most enjoyable I've read to near perfect. I seriously look forward to the continuation of this series.  This work read and felt fully like a massive train leaving the station on an epic journey.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|great puzzle game for those bored out of their wits. ca. get old at times but I still enjoy it on a regular basis.

B006RUJST6|5.0|\\"This review was first posted on Kids Corner @ Kindle Nation Daily.\\"<br /><br />Review - 5 stars -- 7th grade and up...WOW!!  I really liked this book...it introduced me to a new style of poetry - Slam Poetry.  Layken and Will are very likeable characters...You instantly liked Layken and felt for her.  Losing her father unexpectedly and then having to move away from home.  She is trying to be strong for her mother and brother...but is really struggling with his death and then the move on top of that.  I thought she was older than she was since she was driving the moving truck at the beginning of the book.  And so did Will, her new neighbor, who was attracted to her from the first time that he saw her horsing around with her brother and his.  Will is a huge fan of Slam poetry and that is where they went on their first date...a Slam competition. It is hard to give any more information without putting a HUGE SPOILER ALERT on this review...Huge obstacle keeps them apart... Download this book; pick up this book to find out what happens!<br /><br />Educational Value - 5 stars --STAAR testing (Texas mandated test) has a focus on poetry.  This would be a great book to read to the class.  This would be a great intro to poetry for middle grades.  This would be a great unit for leaving rhyming poetry behind.<br /><br />Entertaining Value - 5 stars - I downloaded the 2nd book immediately. This book covered so many different issues that happen to people every day.  It was not just a romance.  It talked about morals, doing the right thing - even when you did not want to, responsibility and more.  It will bring tears to your eyes at times.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|My kids and I were really touched by this story. I read a review in WSJ and then bought it on my Kindle. I'd read a bit a night to my boys who are 10 and 8 and they wanted more and more. We ended up finishing it in about a week. The story appealed to them because of the issues it brings up in how kids deal with difficulties fitting in. I also think they enjoyed the different perspectives style of writing. They felt a lot of sympathy for Augie and then they were able to see how it affected the others as well. It was a good lesson for them.
030758836X|4.0|Most mysteries are either so over the top as to be unbelievable, or you know \\"who did it\\" way too early, but faithfully plod through the pages on the off chance that something unexpected will happen (when it never does).  In this mystery, it does not matter that you know what happened about midway through the book.  It is watching the characters unfold, bit by bit, and in some surprising ways, that kept me reading.  Like others said, the primary characters are unsympathetic, and usually I ditch any book where I don't like the characters.  Not so this one.  Besides answering the tired question \\"can we ever really know another human being?\\", which has been answered in so many other books, this book delves further and asks \\"can we ever really know ourselves, and what we are capable of?  Can we figure ourselves out BY ourselves, or does it take connections with others to show us who we really are?\\"  That is the mystery.<br /><br />I gave the book 4 stars because some things struck me as a bit far fetched (no spoilers here).  Otherwise, I look forward to reading the author's other works.

I am very pleased with this as it is very unique and very different from earlier donnas music.There is not one song I dont like on this. It is a little taste of different styles of music as she really impressed me with the songs fame,crayons and stamp ur feet. This is very good and I suggest u go order it now especially if u want to see another versatile donna that never stopped making the best music ever!! Really am wearing this out. It is great and you will play it alot. I have also ordered alot of her music from amazon and am pleased with them. I have just received cats without claw and its a big hit around here! we all loved donna summers unique style only she had and its all here on amazon!

0618918248|5.0|Without a doubt one of the most informative reads out there on Athiesm. Sometimes it gets a bit too scientific, but once you push through there's always an \\"a-ha!\\" moment of clarity.<br /><br />A must read for Athiests, Agnostics, or anyone on the fence for religion!
B007Z9QS5K|5.0|I loved this movie! During a summer sadly lacking in much substantial material (mostly action/ 'shoot em up' films this year), I was thrilled to find a conglomeration of great actors and actresses with heartwarming stories. The perfect fit when stress relief is called for- I laughed, and giggled, and shed a few tears, too (tears and laughter both being such healthy ways to unwind.)<br /><br />I loved all the sub plots, and the competition between the couples trying to win the first baby of the new year showed the silliness of human nature- with a twist at the end that backed up the speech Hilary Swank's character (from a different subplot) gave. I liked the tie in there. I loved how Sarah Jessica Parker learned that she was more than just a mother; she found balance between being there for her daughter, but learning to live again, herself. I also loved how Halle Berry's character brought poignancy to those who have to be separated during the holidays. (Sniffle.)<br /><br />I really enjoyed the twist involving Josh Duhamel's character and how the separated 'soul mates' find each other. Robert Dinero is excellent as always, with Katherine Heigle and her co-horts giving me some good laugh out loud moments. I also liked that there were snapshots of other well known actors and actresses. I do love a good ensemble cast.<br /><br />All in all, New Year's Eve was a wonderful movie experience. I say, keep the tissues near for the tender moments, but be ready for a good laugh to lighten the mood. And enjoy!
B00383YC2S|5.0|Aliz&eacute;e returned to the music scene in 2010 with a radically different sound courtesy of this album. This album is dressed with dark, nocturnal, glamorous and even gritty artwork and the music it accompanies matches these themes. Taking inspiration from artists of the past like Andy Warhol, Aliz&eacute;e Jacotey creates songs that are haunting yet catchy and full of wonder in \\"Une Enfant Du Siecle.\\" This album is far more trippy, synthetic and dreamy than her previous album [[ASIN:B000WZ8RB2 Psychedelices]].<br /><br />The highlights of this album include \\"Les Collines (Never Leave You),\\" a near-perfect pop song that showcases her vocal talents and leaves you in a state of ecstasy. All the musical elements really come together here, although it is a shame Jean Elan's upbeat remix, which gives a new pace to the song, is not featured on the album. Seek out that remix and the excellent, beautiful music video attached to \\"Les Collines.\\" The song \\"Limelight\\" is another phenomenal song; this one being Aliz&eacute;e's first English song. Limelight begins with pretty but eerie rifts and is more of a chant than a traditional song. It is different but quite charming and pretty, much like this whole album. Another song that really stayed with me was \\"14 D&eacute;cembre\\" which provided a blend of 80s synth-rock, pop and chanting.<br /><br />This album is a step away from the styles of music Aliz&eacute;e is usually associated with and, if you come in expecting [[ASIN:B00005LIXM Moi Lolita]], you will be disappointed. Still, she admirably delivers a lot of mature, clever songs, which often allude to or tributes Edie Sedgwick, Andy Warhol and similar figures of pop culture past.

B007SGM084|1.0|(Review by Marge, not Ernest)  My curiosity got me. My hairdresser raved about the books being amazing and super sexy. I had no reference for her taste in literature at that point. Sexy sounded good for a fun summer read.  I ordered the trilogy for my Kindle and regretted it after book one.  The books are written for a 5th or 6th grade reading level.  The explicit sexual descriptions and nature of the sex were at first entertaining but quickly became tedious and I skipped them to get to the story line.  It's a story that could make a good chick flick - and probably will - but I felt uncomfortable reading it, not about the sexual subject matter, but the poor writing and shame of wasting good money and good time.

B005KXT58U|3.0|I have been a fan of Amy Lee for a long time. Evanescence's first two albums were much loved. However, after purchasing this album (which I actually bought as a cd, should have waited for digital simply because I don't feel it was worth 14 plus tax) I can say that I am only rating it as okay. The music all seems to meld together and it's hard to tell the songs apart. It's okay music and her singing is beautiful as usual but there is something off about this album. It just doesn't fit with the other two as well as I had hoped. It's okay to listen to but not great. There isn't anything really inspiring about it as far as I can tell. I'll be keeping it around and hopefully something about it might rub off on me but we'll see.

B006ZZAMWK|3.0|These boys are onto something. You can tell by the crazed looks on the concert-goers' faces.<br /><br />You can also tell by their finances. As of June 2012, according to the chairman and chief executive of Sony Music Entertainment UK, One Direction represents a $50 million business empire. Aside from their music sales, the band has already published three books and the top-selling calendar of all time. And they have commercial endorsements with Pok&eacute;mon, Nokia, HarperCollins, and Hasbro.<br /><br />So, people - and in particular, girls - love them. And that's not necessarily bad. Certainly you'd rather have your daughter loving One Direction than, say, Pitbull. Their image is clean and wholesome. I would use the term \\"puppy love\\" if I could do so uncondescendingly.<br /><br />And the band takes steps to ensure its parent-friendly image. Certainly you wouldn't want your daughter reading the steams-of-consciousness of 18-y-o boys on Twitter, but they've got that covered: A team of social media experts tweets on their behalf.<br /><br />The one thing that doesn't sit well with me is how manufactured the whole thing is. They don't make their own music, they don't tweet their own tweets. They don't dance or sing or just generally behave in the way any normal self-respecting 18-y-o male would. It's as if Clear Channel Broadcasting, Inc. handed us some carefully constructed characters singing carefully constructed songs to appeal to the young-female mp3-buying segment in a very specific and primal way.<br /><br />That makes me fidgety.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Have had no issues with this app on my Kindle Fire. The only feature I feel is lacking is the weather map--I'd like to see it predict weather movement in the near future (instead of only past to present) like weather.com's website map does.
B003UYUP58|3.0|This is a well written book but unfortunately the author has mostly narrated development of medical oncology. There is very little mention of great achievements in surgical and radiation oncology. This is likely due to author's training and lack of inter disciplinary experience. In cancer treatment today most curative treatments are as a result of surgery and radiation.
B005ES0YKO|5.0|I have been using it for almost a month now and it looks nice (sporty) and tough I have been using it to workout out on my home gym and been holding up pretty good. It looks like this one will last for a long time.
030758836X|2.0|I love psychological thrillers, but this did not deliver the goods for me. The two main characters were simply not compelling. One was self-centered and unpleasant in a pedestrian way. The other was a malignant narcissist--now we're getting somewhere!--but carried out a plan that required a delay of gratification that seems impossible in such a personality. I found the plot implausible, and the book dragged in the middle with unnecessary detail; I continued reading only to find out the ending. I was not outraged by it as some readers were, because the characters were not real enough for me to have any expectations of them.<br /><br />If you want to read a truly masterful story of a twisted relationship, find Ruth Rendell's The Bridesmaid (or, for that matter, any of Ruth Rendell/Barbara Vine's standalone novels). Rendell presents the most monstrous of characters in such a way that we recognize them perfectly, even if we don't like them.<br /><br />I liked Gillian Flynn's first two novels, though they too were flawed--I'll be hoping for better things from her.
B008CJ0KBU|5.0|Lost Girl is refreshing to have on TV! I loved this show right away and I'm glad that Canada could bring such an innovated show to reality. It is edgy, new, and sexual.

B007R41E8O|4.0|I had a lot of fun. This game is a mix of actual hidden object games, and finding missing objects to put in given locations to gain more objects or open up a new scene.  It is challenging at times.  Your not going to whip through this one in a day.  The only negative would be your location orentatation since you do have to go all over the place to find a game to play, place or find a hidden object, or open new scenes. The help is a major plus for this.  Without using the help object, this game will give many days of play. . . maybe more.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Since it has been narly 10 years since the mini series and no movie sequel is out... I found the book 'A Heart for Milton' quite satisfying. I downloaded Kindle for PC and for $2.99 had a MOST satisfying read.
B007Y5IAV0|4.0|The Short Story:<br />Serj Tankian's HARAKIRI is a good addition to his solo discography, but it never quite reaches the heights of his past solo releases or his output with System of a Down.  Recommended primarily for pre-existing fans; this album probably won't convert any skeptics.<br /><br />Long Story:<br />It feels like Tankian is a tragic solo artist; his work will forever be compared to his previous band System of a Down.  For this reason, it's hard to see his work as completely separate from the band, especially when a lot of what defined the band's sound is apparent in his solo outings.  Serj Tankian's HARAKIRI is marked with exotic vocals -- crooning that doesn't quite feel conventional.  It's rife with heavy guitars -- while the music doesn't exactly thrash around, the instrumentation is heavier than most contemporary solo artists.  It's filled with shifting dynamics and tempos -- songs jump from loud to soft, slow to fast, in a blink of an eye.  It's lyrics jump from the super seriousness of world politics to the absurdities of random imagery.  While it feels like all the ingredients are here for another System of a Down masterwork, it falls a bit short in comparison.<br /><br />HARAKIRI begins with \\"Cornucopia,\\" one of the album's strongest tracks.  It feels a bit restrained for Tankian at times, but it works well.  Lead single \\"Figure it Out\\" is probably the heaviest song on the album; it thrashes about with slippery guitars, rumbling bass, rapid vocal delivery, and intense double-kick bass drums.  The album is largely devoid of such heavy/thrashy moments until the penultimate \\"Uneducated Democracy.\\"  Title track \\"Harakiri\\" aims for serious, melancholy, political lyricism, and it succeeds for the most part.  Unfortunately, the song suffers from a lack of emotion, which feels apparent throughout the album.  One of the Tankian's vocal traits that I've really enjoyed is his ability to express, his ability to convey desperation, his ability to let the listener know the urgency of the lyrics.  This feels largely gone in HARAKIRI, and it comes across the most in its title track -- a track that hinges on that very thing.  Other times, the social commentary feels a bit tired (it reaches its zenith in \\"Reality TV\\").<br /><br />Fans of Tankian will largely know what to expect from this album.  For me, I was glad to see a few departures from his sonic wheelhouse.  \\"Deafening Silence\\" is a slick, electronic song that is backed with quiet female vocals.  It may not have the strongest melody on the album, but it's a nice change of pace and an interesting one.<br /><br />HARAKIRI is a nice installment to Tankian's relatively solid solo output -- I would definitely recommend this to fans.  For listeners who are unfamiliar with Serj Tankian's work, you could start listening with better albums.  For his work in System of a Down, I would recommend [[ASIN:B001414XLQ TOXICITY]], or for his work as a solo artist, [[ASIN:B00187MXA4 ELECT THE DEAD]].  Listeners who have come this far and are not convinced of Tankian's worth as an artist/vocalist, this album will not do much to change your mind.  Standout tracks to sample/download: \\"Cornucopia,\\" \\"Occupied Tears,\\" \\"Figure it Out\\" and \\"Deafening Silence.\\"  HARAKIRI doesn't contain much surprise, but what it lacks in surprise it makes up for in consistency.<br /><br />(Additional Release Information:)<br />There is an additional version of HARAKIRI.  This deluxe edition comes with two additional songs: \\"[[ASIN:B008EEX5HO Revolver]],\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B008EEX5RO Tyrant's Gratitude]].\\"  \\"Revolver\\" shifts between midtempo alt rock to uptempo thrashing.  \\"Tyrant's Gratitude\\" feels a little more like something that would have appeared on System of a Down's debut album in terms of instrumentation and vocal delivery.  Both of these songs are quite good -- if listeners bought the original version, I'd recommend downloading these tracks if you are a Tankian fan.tener know the urgency of the lyrics.

0345803485|1.0|I picked this book up after all the hubba bubba on it and was vastly disappointed. In short, this book is about a messed up, creepy guy who is also a billionaire, smart, handsome, funny, blahblah (basically all these positive things to balance out his sick, perverse, abused side- his true side) and falls in love with a senseless virgin.<br /><br />The only realistic part of this book is when she SERIOUSLY questions how messed up he is. It's unfathomable, though, when she continues to say sorry and decide to stay with this creep. (And in my opinion, there is honestly no way to think of this Christian Grey as at all attractive...unless I have an image of Alex Skarsgard in mind, but even then.)<br /><br />I'm not even going to mention the literary aspect of this novel. Everyone already know it's terrible.
B004LROMWU|5.0|I bought this series over the summer so we could catch up before Season 2 started.  The family (15 and up) watched all of the Season 1 episodes in three nights and we count the hours before the next Season 2 show.  This series is well done, and not full of cliches (yet).  We're totally nerding out on it too - we bought the comic book that describes the time before Season 1, and another set that details the Battle of Fitchburg that occurs between the end of Season 1 and the beginning of Season 2.  We're in a pitched family battle over whether the series concludes like the Colonists VS Redcoats (Humans beat Skitters), or Colonists VS Indians (Humans become extinct).  Get this series, it is smart and entertaining!!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love my Mah Jong game purchase.  I have so much fun trying to beat myself each time I go onto one of the selections.  There are 4 different categories -  Red, Green, White, Black.  Each of those categories has 15 games in it.  So, there is plenty of game fun to be had.  Enjoy

B004QOB8SO|5.0|The writers and cast of this series continue to put out an incredible show. Instead of doing 12 so-so shows, they put 3 outstanding episodes. Every actor is top in their craft, the original Holmes would be very pleased with this 21st C. Version.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|I came across this band in one of my Pandora stations. After I had crafted a station that pretty much only played this album I decided it was high time I went ahead and purchased it. Currently my favorite album - listened to it on repeat the first week I got it, have added a little more variety in my listening since, but still keep coming back to it.
B004GJXQ20|5.0|Brilliant read, addictive. Better than the TV series and the series is very good. Have advised all my friends to try it out. Might not be for everyone but I found I was looking forward to reading it every evening.
B008ASLNN2|2.0|Haven't been so disappointed by a sequel in a while. Incoherent and overplayed, it is nothing like the first one. Will never pay to watch a third one.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This gives you what you want for a free solitaire app.  The ads appear before a new game starts and doesn't interrupt game play.
B003B02O14|4.0|Very interesting, a fun read of course it's not his best novel but it was worth the read. Anyone who has ever just wanted a mulligan or restart their life over this is a book for them.

B0064TVQ5E|5.0|A good time killer. I haven't played long but so far so good. I have it on my Kindle so I haven't had a problem with the tiles being too small. Test it out if you like this game, its free.
B005K17RU0|4.0|My family has come to rely on this weather app, to see what the weather has in store for our area.<br />I would have gave it an extra star if it had BP measurement.  Then it would help us know if the fishing was good or bad.<br />Over all this is a great weather app.
B000K4X5XA|4.0|Some years ago (let us never mind how many), I'd likely have given this one a full five stars. I still give the film four stars for its spirited sense of fun, for the visual splendor of its first half, and for the lead performances by Reeve, Kidder, and Hackman.<br /><br />But would it be too cruel to admit that aspects of the film haven't aged as well as these aforementioned qualities? The epic, visual grandeur of Superman's first half - the sweeping fields of wheat, the open plains, the ice fields of Krypton - gives way to a more mundanely photographed, almost workmanlike view of Superman/Clark Kent's urban Metropolis.  This second half of the film just doesn't look as splendid as the first.<br /><br />Add to that, the action in Metropolis is often dependent on special effects that appear badly dated. Now, the aging process on effects does not necessarily have to be a problem. To wit: the special effects of every film that Ray Harryhousen worked on appear dated, and yet his work is largely the reason people still watch `Jason and the Argonauts.'  The very artificiality of his effects seems to highlight the otherworldliness of the varying Greek gods and monsters.<br /><br />Alas, where Harryhousen's work has aged well, the effects in `Superman' haven't.  The effects seem to have been designed to make Superman as believable - as realistic - as possible in the late 70's era. Thirty plus years later, however, special effects technology has moved on - and what was cutting edge then now appears... to be not.<br /><br />However. With all of that said, the film still gets those four stars - for its sense of fun, and for its performances.<br /><br />Reeve was so good as Superman that his performance has - in many minds - become the definitive interpretation. There's a fine, subtle humor to the way he plays the dual roles of Kent and Superman that accentuates his character's role as an outsider. Plus, Reeve looks good in the red and blue suit. No small task.<br /><br />Margot Kidder remains my favorite Lois Lane. Smart, tough talking, driven, and prone to chain smoking, Kidder was able to carry out a difficult task: making Lane a believably smart reporter who could still miss the blatantly obvious fact that the hulking Iowa geek with glasses next to her is in fact the superhero with whom she's fallen in love. A lot of other actresses have taken on the role, some to very good effect (Neill and Hatcher), some not (Bosworth). None have quite matched Kidder's work here. (In my opinion, anyway...)<br /><br />And then there's Hackman.  From what I can tell, not everyone likes his take on Lex Luthor - too much humor, not enough evil. If I'm being honest, I have to admit that Hackman doesn't really seem to be playing the part for dramatic effect. But darn, the man is funny - and I feel like his acting choices fit a film that places charm and wit above  a frenetic sense of drama. Plus, hey - it's Gene Hackman. I don't know about you, but I've never seen the man phone it in or give a bad performance - even when he's playing a light role. His effort is miles better than Kevin Spacey's rather dull, slightly sour take on the role.ot Kidder remains my favorite Lois Lane.

0316044695|3.0|Like most people, I am thankful to the military women and men who serve our country.  I admire their courage, conviction and determination.  I have been fortunate to meet some men and women who have served in the recent wars; they have all struck me as smart, inquisitive, contemplative people who have thought deeply about their experiences, about why they were needed, and about the people they fought.  Inspired by them, I have read quite a few accounts of the wars, and I have heard a few accounts in person.  This is why reading this book was a shock to me.  I cannot quite believe that it was actually written by a member of one of an elite military unit.  I simply cannot believe that.<br /><br />The lack of humility, introspection and the simple unwillingness (or inability) to think about the meaning of the experiences narrated in the book is simply shocking.  As I read the book, the angry and brute-like reasoning that emerged throughout struck me as either a tone created by a ghost-writer or as the voice of a truly infantile and hideous person, admittedly one on the verge of emerging into adulthood (because of some moments of small insight).  But, the further I progressed through the story, particularly the events of operation Redwing, the more I began to think that if Mr. Luttrell really thinks and understands his experiences as he claims in this book, than it may be that he is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and from survivor's guilt.  He clearly feels guilty about the incident when he prevented his colleagues from executing a group of Afghan shepherds and often refers to that moment as the cause of the terrible events that followed.  It may be that he is right; it may be that he is not.  More than likely, he is right.  But, it struck me as rather sad and lacking in understanding of what this war is about when he continuously referred to the Middle East and to Afghanistan as a barbaric, uncivilized world, and to the idea that his job and that of theUS military is to preserve civilization.  Again, he may, in some way, be right. But, if that is indeed the reason for all this loss of life (on both sides), then the men and women who fight for our civilization have to show others, particularly the enemy, what civilization is.  Part of civilization is respecting others and trying to minimize damage by playing by the rules.  Some might say that by doing the civilized thing with the shepherds he did the right thing, but paid a personal price.  Yet, perhaps if he had not done that and he still had found himself under attack, the Afghan villagers who protected him may not have aided him.<br /><br />Instead of using his experience to reflect on how these big issues about the meaning of the war are reflected in the very nature of his personal decisions, Mr. Luttrell uses the moment to rant against the media (or the liberal media, as he calls it) and blames them for keeping an eye on the behavior of the military.  He repeatedly attacks the Geneva conventions (what would he have said about those had he been captured?) and at one point makes a comment defending the decidedly uncivilized behavior of some soldiers at Abu Ghraib.  Mr. Luttrell's rhetoric and unwillingness to even think about all the issues certainly does not dispel the myth that some liberals hold that some military men are childish brutes.  Mr. Luttrell's narcissistic worldview also emerges when he describes the vigil others held for him.  He could have simply described it; it was quite touching and truly a display of kindness from the people of Texas.  Instead, he makes exaggerations about how no other people would do something like this.  Yet, at the same time that the vigil is being held, a tiny little village has taken a stand to protect him against the Taliban.  Yes, this people are not making him tons of food and singing n public; they are doing something more costly, risking their lives and safety for him.  Mr. Luttrell describes those Afghan villagerswith a measure of sympathy and gratitude.  Yet, he does not seem to realize how much they put at stake for him, how those people risked their lives and that of their children for him, a stranger, a man who would call them barbaric and uncivilized, a man who lied to them about who he was and who seems to think he flat out deserved their aid for no reason.  Incidentally, he does not even bother updating the readers about what happened to these folks after he left them.  One can only hope that he had has the nobility to follow up on them and perhaps reached out to them in some way.<br /><br />For all his talk about his God protecting him and so forth, Luttrell seems hardly like a good disciple of the basic teachings of Christ, at least as he portrays himself in the book.  I certainly feel that the image of Luttrell that is painted here may not be entirely one of his own devising; it often feels like the image of the man portrayed in this book was a carefully constructed by someone else.  The image that emerges is of an obedient, dim-witted but supposedly kind hearted good-old-boy who loves his mom and his dogs and Texas.  He may have been used for propaganda inside the US to push for an anti-liberal media campaign.  Outside the US, this book can easily be served to stoke the fires of anti-US sentiments.  For people who have feel that the US had invaded, intervened in and harmed their countries, the US is always a big old abuser, a kid with too much power.  The man portrayed in this book, \\"Lone Survivor\\" is a reminder of the good old American bully.  As such, it makes me respect and appreciate the courage of Mr. Luttrell and his fallen comrades.  We are grateful to them.  But, we can also be ashamed of the way Mr. Luttrell reasons about what happened.  As an American watching the rise of other superpowers and the loss of American dominance at a global scale, the worldview displayed in this book makes me think that there is, indeed, some justification for the argument that it is time for some other power to take the lead or for the US to grow into a different kind of leader.
0811875040|4.0|i read some of the reviews of 'miette' and found them soooo sad.  while i thank the reviewers for their detailed corrections ( and i wrote them down, as well) i didn't agree with the negativity...i didn't want the 'tone' of the reviews to bum my happiness....all in all, the book is inspirational.  and gorgeous.  i appreciate all the hard work and creativity that went into it....my only criticism ( which i didn't see noted anywhere) was about the size of the piping tips.  the author identified them by size...but my tips are all numbered.  eeeeek.  does that mean i have to measure my piping tips now???  anyway, i love this book ...it will go into my collection of other beautiful books like the french laundry cookbook, etc...and yes, i recommend it to you all....
0374275637|5.0|This is a monster book packed with fascinating insights about how our cognitive systems process and render information. Its starting premise is that we have two discrete \\"systems\\" for mental processing. Daniel Kahneman, a cognitive psychologist who transformed himself into a Nobel Prize-winning behavioural economist, gives these the Dr. Seussian labels \\"System 1 and System 2\\".<br /><br />System 1 is fast. It makes snap judgments on limited information: it manifests itelf in the \\"fight or flight\\" reflex. System 2 is more deliberative: courtesy of this, one meditates on eternal verities, solves quadratic equations and engages in subtle moral argument. Though this is interesting enough, their interaction is more fascinating still. System 1 is lightweight, efficient and self-initiates without invitation; bringing System 2 to bear on a conundrum requires effort and concentration.<br /><br />This talk of snap judgments calls to mind Malcolm Gladwell's popular but disappointing \\"[[ASIN:0316010669 Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking]]\\". Kahneman's account, rooted in decades of controlled experiment, is a far more rigorous explanation of what is going on, and is able to explain why some snap judgments are good, and others are bad. This conundrum, unanswered in Gladwell's book, is Daniel Kahneman's main focus of enquiry.<br /><br />It also invokes another popular science classic: Julian Jaynes' idea of the \\"[[ASIN:0618057072 Bicameral Mind]]\\" - wherein there are large aspects of our daily existence, which we consider them conscious, really are not - driving by rote to the office, playing a musical instrument - these are also mental processes, I imagine Kahneman would say, undertaken by System 1. Jaynes was widely viewed as a bit of an eccentric: Kahneman's work suggests he may have been right on the money.<br /><br />It gets interesting for Kahneman where the division of labour between the systems isn't clear cut. System 1 can and does make quick evaluations even where system 2's systematic analysis would provide a better result (these are broadly the \\"bad\\" snap judgments of Gladwell's Blink). But System 2 requires dedicated mental resource (in Kahneman ugly expression, it is \\"effortful\\"), and our lazy tendency is to substitute (or, at any rate, stick with) those \\"cheaper\\" preliminary judgments where it is not obviously erroneous to do so (and by and large, it won't be, as System 1 will have done its work). Kahneman's shorthand for this effect is WYSIATI: What You See Is All There Is.<br /><br />Kahneman invites the reader to try plenty of experiments aimed at illustrating his fecklessness, and these hit their mark: it is distressing to repeatedly discover you have made a howling error of judgment, especially when you knew you were being tested for it. This has massive implications for those who claim group psychology can be predicted on narrow logical grounds. The latter half of Thinking Fast and Slow focusses more on our constitutional inability to rationally adapt to probabilities and soundly wallops the notion of Homo Economicus, the rational chooser each of us imagine ourselves to be. This is where Kahneman's Nobel Prize-winning Prospect Theory and gets full run of the paddock.<br /><br />Kahneman draws many lessons (which, by his own theory, doubtless will go unheeded) for scientists, economists, politicians, traders and business managers: \\"theory-induced blindness\\"; how we become (irrationally) risk tolerant when all our options are bad and risk averse when all our options are good, and how we systematically underweight high probability outcomes relative to actual certainty. For those with nerves of steel there's a real arbitrage to be exploited here.<br /><br />This long book is a rich  (if \\"effortful\\") store of information and perspective: it is not news that our fellow man tends not to be as rational as we like to think he is, but we are inclined strongly exclude present company from such judgments. Kahneman is compelling that we are foolish to do so: this is a physiological \\"feature\\" of our constitution:  the \\"enlightened\\" are no more immune. This is a valuable and sobering perspective.<br /><br />Olly Buxtonlling that we are foolish to do so: this is a physiological \\"feature\\" of our constitution:  the \\"enlightened\\" are no more immune. This is a valuable and sobering perspective.<br /><br />Olly Buxton

I have been watching them since their first performance on the Sing Off, and they amaze me everytime.  The best part is they are the most down to earth people you will ever meet.  They will take the time while meeting with fans to sing a request, or visit a childrens hospital, so that others may take part in their love of music.  Watching the viedo of the young girl \\"Izzy\\" dance to their music, while hooked up to an I.V. brought a tear and a smile to my face.  You will not be dissapointed by Pentatonix.

B0037QGS0A|3.0|\\"Chloe\\" (2009) directed by Atom Agoyan is the remake of the French film Nathalie... (2003) made by Anne Fontaine with Fanny Ardant, Emmanuelle B&eacute;art, and G&eacute;rard Depardieu, as three participants of erotic thrilling psychological drama. Chloe follows the Nathalie's footsteps quite closely. The difference is in the final act, and I prefer Nathalie's ending. All Atom Agoyan and the rest of Chloe's creators had to do to make it a truly great movie -was just to remake step by step the French original. The most amazing thing about Nathalie... was its palpable erotic tension on the screen and at the same time, the lack of steamy sex scenes which was more than compensated with the subtle communication between two women, older, Catherine and younger, Nathalie and between Catherine (Ardant) and her husband of many years (Depardieu) whom she still loves but does not know anymore how to make them both happy.<br /><br />Both movies run almost the same time, French film - 100 minutes, and North American -96 but I prefer the intelligent, insightful, nuanced, implying and not shoving in your face the sensational fatal attraction ending film Nathalie. It is not to say that Chloe is worthless. It is gorgeous to look at, and three main actors, Julian Moore, Liam Neeson, and Amanda Seyfried all gave very good performances. The young Amanda Seyfried was a very worthy screen partner to Juliana Moore who can do no wrong to me. I was especially impressed by Amanda's face and how it changes from young and innocent to sexy and seductive, resentful, dangerous in a course of seconds. The problem of Chloe is its script which goes weak and out of breath in the final part. The final of Chloe makes me think that the authors of the film don't trust their audiences and feed us with sex, melodrama, and very unsatisfying a la fatal attraction climax because they are afraid we don't get the subtleties that made the original film so thrilling.<br /><br />Another problem I have with Chloe is the character of Catherine and David's son, Michael. He existed in the French film but on the background. In Nathalie, he left his parents' house and from what I could judge, he had quite normal relationship with them which allowed the plot to concentrate primarily on the unusual and quite fascinating relationship between Catherine and the call girl Nathalie whom she hired to find out if her husband cheats on her and what he actually expects from a woman. In the film Chloe, the character of Michael was annoying, and in the end his only purpose was to justify unsatisfying final act of the film.<br /><br />Chloe - 5.5/10, Nathalie - 9/10er of Catherine and David's son, Michael.

B005OP7162|5.0|Gosh, friends come in so handy, so often. My BFF told me of this TV series and just today I finished all 22 episodes and can't wait for the next season. What a great concept for an intriguing, captivating drama. I am so glad I streamed all episodes as they air the day after the do on TV, sans commercials. And with the little enticement of the pay package, I received .10 off each ep. :D Others I have watched and loved, include, Damages, Nip/Tuck, and Mad Men ( rules )<br /><br />I hope to see more quality TV series as the above. They are compelling and absorbing and rich with talent, quality and intrigue.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|I really enjoy the games by this company. their hidden object adventures continue to improve. This game was the just-right balance of relaxing game play and feeling challenged. the zoom feature is great too. And ... you can't beat the price!

B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. Altho I've not hiked more than  five miles at a time during my life, I found the story throughly interesting, scary, funny,sad, happy and most of all brave. It's a great testament to a stong woman who didn't give up.
B006C1DH92|5.0|I got this one as the Amazon free app of the day on 12/27/2011, I loved it then and still play it now! It would be worth paying for, in my opinion. One of my staple games! I am not a big games person, so if I like one and play it as much as I have this one, it earns a permanent spot on my devices. Plays well on both my Samsung Galaxy Player (my 1st ever Android device) and also on my Samsung Galaxy Note (my 2nd ever Android device).
B007HC3LHS|4.0|Elizabeth Haynes has me checking the position of the forks and triple checking the locks, and I am almost normal! Her demonstrative OCD details increases the suspense.  Her plot is so tight, I over-looked her character's not-so-believable need to stay in such a creepy relationship--no one is that good-looking. But,the story is definitely good-reading!
B002ZG99TK|5.0|I think just about every boy loves trains, and yes those of us who are still boys at heart. I don't want to leave girls out as I think they will enjoy Unstoppable, but it just seems to me girls don't get as excited as boys do about trains. Once again great action, and acting, but the star is 777. I love this movie.
0307887448|4.0|Don't take this book too seriously, and you'll have quite a good afternoon of entertainment.  Wade Watts, along with most of the inhabitants of an increasingly crowded and desperate planet, spends his days immersed in an online VR world called the Oasis.  Wade's primary objective:  winning a contest to inherit the Oasis inventor's billions by finding three magical keys and clearing three gates - a race that will involve everything 80s, because this was the Oasis founder's obsession.<br /><br />I was thoroughly entertained by all the movie, game, book,and music references from my teenage years.  The suspense surrounding the contest was engaging enough that I sat by the pool and flipped through all those Kindle pages in a single afternoon.<br /><br />Implausibly easy plot solutions?  80s culture references poured on a bit thick?  Improbably happy endings?  Check, check, and check.  Don't overanalyze.  This book is not trying to be Ender's Game.  This book is trying to be fun, and it succeeds.  I enjoyed the description of the Oasis and the contest, and liked some of the bonus side plots as well, such as virtual schools where the students can't misbehave because it's not permitted by the programming... and the fitness program that monitors your calorie intake and won't let you log in until you get enough exercise...  PLUS I got to read about Ultraman and Wargames and Ladyhawke and Monty Python... all in the context of a game taking place in a dystopian future?  Pretty cool afternoon, there.<br /><br />This is Ernest Cline's first book, and his pacing, humor, and ability to create an engaging alternate world point to great things ahead. Keep writing, Mr. Cline; I'm looking forward to your next book!  (Awaiting your entry... Stun Runner, Atari, 1989)
B000OXHRRC|4.0|its a wonderfull movie saw 2 years ago and after all this time saw again and again i always enjoyed a good movie
B0081L37Z0|5.0|I thought this movie was going to be a 3 star movie but I was wrong. This movie is super funny (all age audience).
1469984202|5.0|I have had to turn towards YA recently to get good solid dystopian stories. Ones that are not fantasy or space related. This adult story hit the mark in all ways. I picked this one up without knowing anything about the author and bit hesitant on the length. I should not have been. Great story, characters, descriptions. Very realistic and definite could happen vibe. Even the mystery was interesting enough to keep me reading.<br /><br />I understand he is releasing a prequel to explain how they ended up in the silo! Can't wait!
B0051BVQFG|3.0|think \\"blackhawk down\\" plus \\"independance day\\" without any of will smith's silliness. the alien invaders dont seem very formidable considering they came here from somewhere else.its watchable, but not more than once.
B006ZDU7QI|5.0|This album is fantastic. Every song is well thought out and the production is outstanding. Worth getting for more than just the single.
B004XUMPFQ|5.0|in my opinion this is one of the best shows ever on tv. science fiction meets western. a great cast and good story lines about a crew on a small independant freighter who take on some passengers to help pay the bills and the fun commences.the show was cancelled before the first season finished airing.i dont know if it was put up against stiff competition or a bad time slot,but the show definately deserved better.you cant go wrong buying this.dont forget to get the movie \\"serenity\\" which was made after the series was cancelled and ties up some of the loose pieces
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|This is a great show, and the first season was excellent. The DVD came  in new condition as I expected, and shipping was quick.
B0012HF5NC|3.0|this could have been one of the best sci-fi movies ever if they would have deleted every scene with will smith and randy quade.thier \\"over the top\\" acting could not have been worse. the story is good and it has stellar special effects.the movie actually does a good job portraying the helplessness of trying to defeat a vastly superior foe.did i mention how bad will smith and randy quade are?
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|This is a great show, and the first season was excellent. The DVD came  in new condition as I expected, and shipping was quick.
0790729652|1.0|The copy they used to transfer this to DVD (I am referring to the cardboard front '97 edition DVD) is terrible.  You can see screen \\"pops\\" and \\"scratches\\" throughout the movie. (The defects you see on films in the theaters when a movie roll has been played a bunch and starts to get worn).  It is not much better than VHS.  Surround sound is terrible, it is pretty much just Mono sounding even though listed Dolby Digital.  Hopefully the special edition or Blu-Ray is a better transfer.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|long playing time.  not hard, not real easy either.  been playing for couple of days, 1-2 hours per day. it just keeps going.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this app I have this on my Iphone 4s it is so fun and addiction this game is so intelligate
B007BLCGNU|5.0|I had heard many rumors over the years about J Edgar and formed an opinion that was very negative.  This movie gave a much needed insight to this man.  I actually felt sorrow for this guy at the end. He was such an ass but having to live as he did answered a lot of questions on how a someone can turn mean.  It is too bad he could not live a more fuller life and the bigotry against his sexuality created an even bigger bigot out of him.  He was ruthless at his job.  We cannot turn a blind eye to his accomplishments.  I think everyone should watch this movie more than once, if you do you will learn something new everytime.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great game.  I have this game on my Ipod also.  Having trouble putting it down.  Really makes you think. Love it._
B00407PNY2|5.0|I remember one Sunday night many years back as Ed Sullivan spoke of a new movie release titled \\" Bullitt \\"<br />A preview was shown of the car chase & Steve McQueen was introduced to the audience by Ed. A rousing cheer of applause went up for Steve as he stood up & even in the public domain he seemed a little bashful but there he was in the flesh \\" The King of Cool \\" sitting with the public enjoying the Ed Sullivan's Sunday evening show. Probably a month went by until one of our local Cinemas advertised the arrival of \\" Bullitt \\". Being a \\" Hot-Rodder \\" with a lot of muscle car friends it was off to the movie & what a movie it was ( is ). Of course being car fanatics the plot didn't mean too much to us , we were there for the chase !<br />I had always wanted a 68 Charger R/T but I had to settle for a 69 as I couldn't find a 68 for sale. When they got to the part where Bill Hickman being followed by Steve made the left turn & lit the tires up , I couldn't believe it ! That Charger sounded identical to mine , if that movie theater seat had have been vibrating you would have swore you were in the real thing!<br />Crazy as we were we went back & watched that movie 4 or 5 times during the next couple of months. It just got better but of course we had the big screen & the theater sound system. Our women got us into the plot & Steve's love life. As far as I'm concerned this movie holds the all time record for the best car chase ever in the history of Cinema , WHY ? Because it was REAL ! For those of you who didn't go through the muscle car era ( 1960's - early 70's ) you really might not have any idea of how these cars performed & handled from a driver , owner , tuner perspective .  The modern day word would be awesome , the best years of my life & this movie takes you back for a hair-rising ride as it really happened ! Even today in the present times I watch the movie 4 or 5 times a year. Sure at reunions if the title \\" Bullitt \\" comes up , it starts. How many hub-caps did that Charger lose ? How many times did we see that green Volkswagen show up on the streets during the chase ? Was it really Steve McQueen or Bud Ekins that did the real heavy driving scenes in the Highland Green Mustang ? A side note , the driver of the Charger the real life Bill Hickman ( stunt driver & actor ) taught James Dean sport's car racing & actually held James Dean in his arms as James died resulting from Mr.Dean's accident on the street. Also if you research what both Bill Hickman & Bud Ekins ( two of the stunt drivers ) have said when asked , that 440 Cu.In. 375 HP Charger could just pull away from that 390 Cu.In.Mustang at will & believe me I can personally relate to that statement ( & I am a Shelby man , so don't think I'm anti-Ford ! ) BUT Steve & the Mustang were the good guys , \\" That's Hollywood \\" ! These were talented men & actors driving the real thing not fancy mirrors & trick photography. May all these fine actors & talented drivers who have passed on REST IN PEACE, THANKS GENTLEMAN ! It was the end of an era. FIVE STARS ALL THE WAY !
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Don't know why this is a best seller..... It's badly written porn from what I could tell ... At times I felt it was written by a horny teenager.  Not worth the $10 at all!!
B00846REIS|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! I could not put it down. It is very well written. It is full of passion, suspense, comedy. The chemistry between the characters is off the charts! The side characters are wonderfully written. I can hardly wait for the next book!! If you liked Fifty Shades of Grey you will love this one too!
B006CHMRAG|4.0|I bought this watch because of the excellent price and the Seiko reputation I have grown to respect after owning four Seiko watches over the years.  This is an attractive watch that has drawn numerous compliments.  I like the self-winding aspect, which means I never have to worry about replacing batteries. My main negative issue with this watch is its band, which is rather scratchy and becomes irritating after wearing it for a few hours. Minor negative issues are the fact that it does not keep time as well as my current Seiko Kinetic; it loses about two minutes a week, and will only run for about 36 hours when not being worn.  Despite its negative aspects, this is a good-looking leisure-wear, outdoor-sportsman's watch that I hope is as rugged and long lasting as all my other Seiko watches have been.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|Starts to play music then buffers using up your data plan.  Need an unlimited plan with this app.  I am on verizon 3G, still.  I will give 5 stars when that problem is fixed.
B006ZDU7QI|4.0|The album is very diverse and with the exception of a couple songs I think its a solid album all the way through. I'm often confused by bands like this which can create a variety of styles within one album, there's a part of me that likes it, that respects their creative ability to mix things up and be diverse. Then there is the side of me that wonders if bands such as Gotye suffer from an identity crisis, not knowing what their sound is, what voice to stick with as their \\"signiture sound\\". Either way I enjoy the album immensely and am inspired to explore more of their work.
B0086700CM|5.0|This was my most favorite game of all time the only problem I have with it is that you cant make the wallpaper YOUR wallpaper
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved this series from the first to the last page.  The author always put new turns in the story so it was never boring.  The only thing bad about it is that it is basically a porno adult version of the Twilight series: a single, innocent female attracted to an impossibly awesome rich guy in the Seattle area who has underlying issues in relationships. And their lives in the story follow the same plot: girl in school gets a crush; they both like each other and get together; etc. etc. (dont want to spoil the rest of it).  I must admit though that this author writes a lot better than Stephenie Meyer. But other than that Twilight-ness I liked it because it is easy to relate to emotionally and you can't put the book down once you start because you get so caught up in the story.  I also loved just how modern day it was and I would definately recommend this to anyone (adult) who has been through relationships before and isnt afraid of reading an eye opener.

B0058YPG1G|5.0|Walter White such a likable guy:)  We have a love/hate relationship with Walter, a murder or two under the circumstances seems acceptable, well, sort of.<br /><br />Walter, Jesse, Gus, the trio that made the money. Walter and Jesse cooked, and Gus led the meth to the money. These three lived under the threat of death, and in the fourth season we realize it is either Gus or Jesse and Walter. The episodes leading to the finale were tough, tense and violent. When the big bang came, it was so unexpected. It was an exquisite set-up, Walter hiding at the Senior Nursing Home, outside the the window, and the cute little white haired lady yelling hello to him.  Gus arriving with his entourage, and then leaving in that fashion. Kudos!<br /><br />Skyler knows the story, and now she is implicated, big time. Walt Junior goes on trusting his dad as the best there is, and wondering what is wrong with his mother. The baby oblivious to everything.  Hank will be vindicated at the end, the lab burned down and he realized something was there. Hank alone suspected Gus. Here is a man who can't see inside his own family, but everything else seems pretty clear headed. Mike, alone in Mexico recuperating, will come home to what?<br /><br />We have a series five about to start, and we are all anticipating what we will behold. Can Gilligan live up to this past season? Oh, we all think,yes. What a ride we have in front of us!<br /><br />Highly Recommended. prisrob 07-15-12<br /><br />[[ASIN:B004K8W3EE Music from the Original Series Breaking Bad]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001DJLCRC Breaking Bad: The Complete First Season]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0012QTT4O Pilot]]

B00772M1F6|5.0|Thank you Amazon for putting this album in the Best of 2012...I would have missed out on listening to an amazing singer - every time a J.D song pops up on my phone, I smile and prepare to dance. I love the throwback sound...I almost feel like I have to run to the record player and start the album over at the end of the playlist...not sure how to categorize the sound...rockabilly? rock? Whatever it is, it makes this listener smile and dance around the house while cleaning up after four children!

B003UESJHE|4.0|Best picture well-deserved, although Colin should've won best actor also for A Single Man. Basically this film is all talking but I was intrigued from start to finish. And it also served nostalgic purpose seeing Colin and Jennifer reunite on the big screen for almost like 15 years. Although I'd prefer the blu ray including theatrical trailer of this film but I cannot complain after all because the film is so strong. I could watch it over and over agian. Highly recommended.

B004EQAVHI|5.0|I read the book last year and was deeply impressed with Ishiguro's spare, elegant writing style, the gentle way he approached his shocking theme.  I wasn't particularly interested in seeing the film, feeling that it couldn't be done well, would be too dreary etc, but my husband had brought it home from the library and we settled in to watch it last evening.<br /><br />The film is wonderful.  It takes over where Ishiguro left off, using the same spare, meditative style, but the characters are sharpened up and the story is intensified.  The several issues embedded in the theme are brought forward with more clarity than in the book.  This is an \\"art film\\"  --  beautiful, provocative, something that stays with you and generates a lot of discussion.  It will not appeal to everyone.<br /><br />The music is like one of the major characters, very important and effective in setting the scene.  The acting is simply superb, including the child actors.  One of the interesting devices the film-maker uses to demonstrate the isolation and the 'otherness' of the characters is to have hardly any 'normal' characters appear, and if so not for long.  The landscape is both beautiful and bereft.<br /><br />Many reviewers here brought up the obvious question:  why did the characters go through with the role they were assigned from birth?  Why didn't they try to escape?  I've seen only one reviewer answer this question the way I would. Most young men did in fact respond to the military draft in the way they were brought up to respond, very few failed to sacrifice themselves as required by their country and the culture of the times.  And not many civilians balked either, not many asked searching questions about the rightness or wrongness of the war du jour that their governments had decided upon.  Many parents sent their children off to war with pride.  So it is not much of a leap, really, to see how the sacrifice of this particular group of young people was so easily accepted in the largerculture.<br /><br />In spite of the sadness inherent in the story, it is not an especially depressing movie.  The film maker treats the ordinary human emotions so simply and so honestly that the sadness is not overly burdened with suffering.  The characters look for ways out of their conundrum, but in the end they accept the role they have been dealt in life.  They live as fully as they are able to within the boundaries of their constricted lives.  There is also happiness and exuberance, especially in childhood, and they have a short period of freedom in their late teens when it seems like anything might be possible.  Then reality and the constricted options they were born with kicks in.<br /><br />A beautifully done, important movie, but I can see why it didn't come up for the Oscar.  It's a bit ahead of its time and it raises too many embarrassing questions.
B0063IH60K|4.0|to me this is a good app, I like solitaire and this is a good old game of solitare. I enjoy this app. the adds do get a lil old though
B002DKGWSE|3.0|I saw the first one as a 13 year old kid at a friend's house on ON TV.  So when I saw this in the 5 for $20 bin at BlockBuster I had to buy it.<br /><br />I really didn't remember all of the first movie, just one scene that probably will never leave my mind.  It was pretty graphic.<br /><br />This movie follows the same storyline as the original, but has a few differences (the one scene I mentioned before is not in this one).  I liked the few changes that they made as far as the outcome of the daughter better than the original.<br /><br />I really thought the acting was great.  Seeing the \\"dad\\" from Raising Hope and \\"Jessie\\" from Breaking Bad was a surprise, and they were excellent bad guys.  The mother, father and daughter protagonists are also very good.<br /><br />Just a warning, for those who are squeamish.  I knew that the rape scene was coming and I had a togh time getting through it.  Pretty long.  This movie is not for you.
B002UZCJ8Y|2.0|There's a generally underwhelming tone to SURROGATES. Although far from being a bad movie it never really engages or realises its potential. It's a predictable slice of dystopian cop schlock lifted only by some neat set pieces and a nuanced performance from Rosamund Pike (as Willis's grief-stricken wife). There's the nugget of an interesting movie here but the concept of living through a surrogate isn't given the attention it deserves, and what we get instead is the usual action romp we've come to expect from Willis, who is, in fact, capable of more. Watchable but a missed opportunity.
B0086700CM|3.0|The lag really gets on my nerves, but it's an ok game overall. Do not play if you can't tolerate lag.
0811879542|5.0|Okay ... I am an avid fan of children's books...I have been collecting for over 30 years!<br />I am a parent,  aunt,  educator, and an advocate for all children! But enough about me..<br />I pulled this book out on a Friday afternoon in my pre-k class... although I really love this book I wasn't sure how it would work with a small group... but it was an awesome read! The kids patiently took turns following the directions on each page.<br />I had five kids in the group and each had a turn to follow the directions for two pages. They were so intrigued by what was happening that there was none of the usual squirming about.<br />I'm not sure who enjoyed this experience more... me, watching the kids enjoy this book OR the kids just loving this \\" video game in a book \\".<br />If you have a young child in your life (age 3 +) this is a must have! You cannot go wrong with this \\"experience in a book)!!
B002TXOHIW|5.0|Great product for the promotion of the #Occupy movement. A better suggestion is to buy in bulk, as you'll never know when you'll run into a friend who might want to watch it,...
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|It's awesome! If you love Cut the Rope I don't see why you wouldn't love this it's just as awesome, if not more awesome. I really like the different things they added like the rockets or fireworks and the stick/unstick ones!

B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so fun that I could play it for ours on end and when I don't know what to do I can play this game and never get bored. The best part is trying to fulfilled the many goals because it entertains for a while and when you finally finish that goal there's always a new and better one after that.

B0083SBMBM|5.0|I dont really like super hero movies... but to tell you. THIS IS BY THE FAR BEST SUPER HERO MOVIE IVE SEEN! :D when i saw it. it made me laugh like a couple times. XP There is so many funny scenes in it. Its also a really great movie, Even my boyfriend was laughing right by my side and so was everyone else in the theater. :) If you ask me... I would deadly want to own this movie and let my family watch it :) There is one thing i know for sure.. They will laugh ;)

B0063IH60K|4.0|This is one of my favorite free apps.  I never have problems with it and it keeps the kids entertained
B0086DBE62|5.0|Fun and enjoyable for sure. It is a good rendition of a old fairytale. The characters have a bit of a twist to the original ones, but since everyone knows the story, its nice to have a tweak to them. I like how that there is more centered on the difference to the storyline, than the characters which for the most part are easy to figure out. It's all good and entertaining for this reviewer.
B008JGSM6G|1.0|Can not play because it does not fit on my screen. It did not allow for scrolling either. UN installed.
B0016OLC5Q|1.0|This sounded interesting, but in the end it was difficult to sit through. I found it pretty dull and the main character just drolled on and on. The skipping back and forth in time was also annoying. Don't bother with this one.<br />And Amazon's terrible streaming didn't help. Not sure if anyone else has had this problem, but the movie kept repeating small bits multiple times and I would have to click on the slider to get it to progress normally again. It was almost as if I was watching a skipping record. I have no problem viewing netfilx on my computer, but Amazon needs to work on their streaming. Too bad.
B0001ARCFA|4.0|Although the sound is a bit flat in the mid range, the stage is pretty good for the price. I bought these as a carry around pair of cans I could use with my iPhone. It fills that need quite well. Comfy fit, good sound, great value. The negatives are that the material of the pads can make you get a hot ear. I'm comparing it to my beyerdynamics 990. My 990 are super comfy and has a felt like finish leaving your ear pretty cool.  Other negatives are the build quality being pretty cheap, and the bulky size.<br />With all that in consideration, I would recommend this to anyone looking for cans in at under 100.  At that price I think your top choices are Gredo and Sony and these. All good headphones for diff reasons, but I think this one gets the edge for comfort, sound, and value.
B0081L37Z0|2.0|Predictable and kinda disapointing. Ok if u r sick and stuck in bed and bored. Not terrible but it is mediocre.
B005LAIGN2|1.0|I rented this because I love WWII aviation and all things related. Knowing the George Lucas had a hand in this I had very high expectations.<br />The opening action sequence had me looking forward to the rest of the film, but then the acting and the script began and I could have wept it was so bad. Technically it was a laughing stock, planes never seemed to run out of ammo or fuel and the ammo they had was super human in effectiveness. If this was made for 10 year old kids then forgive me but this was pathetic. Cheesy doesnt begin to describe it. I met one of these pilots (William H Holloman III, 8 years ago at a hotel in Prescott Arizona, there was a fighter pilot convention going on, he was a wonderful man and took me to meet other pilots from WWII there, I just learned that he passed away a few years ago, I'm glad he never saw this movie. I would advise anyone viewing this film in the future to turn off the sound for everything but the battle scenes and just enjoy the CGI work. It is the only redeeming quality this film has.

B007ZMD14I|5.0|I liked this album right off the  bat, but the more I listen the better it gets.  I actually think it may be better than Chinese Democracy, though that could be due to this being new.<br /><br />However you cut it, with this and Chinese Democracy being so solid, it appears that finally the boys in GnR have gone on to bigger and better.
B006T3RM08|2.0|At first glance this looks like a great product.  However, once you install your keyboard and trackpad the trackpad locks up 100% of the time.  There is not enough clearance for the sides of the trackpad.  Once you press down on the trackpad it locks into that position and you have to remove the trackpad from the Clique in order to use the trackpad again.  I had to cut off the side of the holding area where the trackpad sits in order to continue using the Clique.  I should have just returned it.<br /><br />I own both the Clique and the [[ASIN:B006M7IDTA MeshWe Bluefin Seamlessly Connects Magic Trackpad to Apple Wireless Keyboard (apple white)]] and the Meshwe has this product beat in my opinion.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|great app...like the widget..occasionally force closes but hopefully ics 4.0 upgrade will resolve this issue. overall great app and has mire available versions than other apps
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I love playing this game and challenging myself to beat the clock. I like that the pattern keeps changing and refuse to move to the next level until I get three stars.
0452270073|4.0|I was prompted to read this book after an issue of Entertainment Weekly suggested it to fans of the PBS series Downton Abbey.  The story looks at Siegfried Sassoon, a noted poet and decorated war hero, who has been sent to a psychiatric hospital for patients suffering from war neurosis.  Siegfried is there because he has printed a statement that the was is continuing only because the powers at be have not ended. It is up to Dr. Rivers to prove that he is sane or delusional.  The idea being that no matter what, one should be honored to fight for England no matter what the cost and if you disagreed with that you were insane.<br /> I found the story intriguing but confusing at times.  It was hard for me to keep the characters straight.  Also the underlying references to sex and homosexuality where never made clear to me.  I think more needed to be written to have a better understanding of these variables in the story.<br /><br />  I am now curious about Sassoon and am going to try and find more out about him and his role in World War I.
B0009PAVI2|5.0|This is a great product for the weekend shooter, who is a minimalist, and wants to protect their investment. The cool thing is the low profile and it helps that it is water resistant as well.
B005ETA5K2|4.0|I've owned many, many wireless adapters over the years, and this is the best one I've owned to date. It was very simple to set up on Mac OS X 10.6 in an AES WPA2 mixed N/G network. It has nice range with the standard antenna. I like this one much better than a \\"high-end\\" adapter I recently purchased from Micro Center for an older Windows XP Dell machine. It was easier to set up and it has better range - even though the one I just purchased from Micro Center has dual and longer antenna (by about one inch). Wish I would have purchased two of these instead. Oh, and the Alpha was about $20 cheaper.
0817439390|5.0|I have been reading/viewing everything about photography that I can for the last 5 years. Everything from blogs, books, videos, workshops, and so on to get a better grasp of my favorite hobby. Now after reading this, I wish I would have started with this book, or it's previous incarnations.<br /><br />While reading this book I put away most of my gear and grabbed my camera, put on a lens to take shots as I moved along the chapters. Bryan really breaks it down into easy to follow fundamentals. The book is about content, not about personal product sales, or pushing a new fad in photography. While there are other books out there that have the same information, his flow, and examples make it a brilliant simple read.<br /><br />The first four chapters are like being in a Photography 101 class and not a workshop about the camera itself, getting you to understand the basic foundations of capturing light.<br /><br />Simply, if I had to do it all over again, this book with a decent DSLR kit would have been perfect. This will be something I suggest to folks with mid/high end point & shoots or DSLRs. This book is a great read for all ages, start here first, and then move onto this series [[ASIN:0321839951 Scott Kelby's Digital Photography Boxed Set, Parts 1, 2, 3, and 4]].<br /><br />Really do yourself a favor and give it a read, save yourself some frustration.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|The book was an easy read and had you excited to turn the page.  You learn to care for the characters and understand what they are going through.  You understand Abby's doubt and Travis' feelings.  You root for Travis and want to knock some sense into Abby early on in the book! I read it twice and am very excited for Travis' point of view to come out next year! Read an excerpt on Jamie's website!!  Definatly a book you will not be able to put down and will have you thinking of the next book!
B006RUJST6|5.0|I just finished this book and I loved every minute of it. It was turly a GREAT READ. I was laughing out loud, crying and I'm excited to read more. I was even reading parts to my husband because he was wondering what was so funny:) This is a must read hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|Nice, attractive photos help with this mostly find the object and pick the differences game. It's a decent fun time. Sometimes the object descriptions are overly vague, but nothing too difficult
0439023521|5.0|Saw the movie first, but the book was sooo much better. Much more detail. I got to know the side characters more in the book then in the movie. I felt sorrier for those who died. Onto the next one...
B00772M1F6|5.0|This absolutely one of the best albums I've heard in the past five years.  There are no duds on this album.  Every song rocks out and makes you want to get up and dance. This album reminds me very much of the super hip road house bar bands from the fifties and early sixties.  There are very few bands or singers that I care to see anymore, but this band ranks in the top five acts that I would love to see.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is perfect. It has reading plans, easy layout, and makes reading the Bible much easier because you have it anywhere.Everyone needs to have this app!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Holy moly cannoli!! What an awesome book!!! I read this book in 5 days, and loved every page of it! I've never read a book with so many twists, turns, truths, lies, mystery, suspense, secrets, psychotic minds in my life!!! This was my first book I've read by Gillian Flynn, and am excited to read her other books. I found myself gasping out loud with each secret that was revealed. I found my mouth hanging wide open as I read on. You really can't tell people about this book farther than what happens in the first 2 chapters, without giving something away. Bravo Gillian Flynn. The ending was so crazy, I didn't want it to end!! This would be a good book club book. AMAZING!!
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|I hope the manufacturer has used a different material in this new cord.  The original's cover crumbled off.  I do like the idea of the cord connecting to either the computer or an outlet.
0439023513|1.0|Both my wife and I read and discussed this book.  We concluded that it was by far the worst of the set and we loved the first one.  The primary issue is that the Katniss, who starts off in the first book as a strong female lead, ends in this book as a neurotic suicidal basket case.  Katniss becomes the poster child of neurosis leading to suicidal behavior.  By this I mean she is overwhelmed with anxiety, hysteria, sadness, depression, anger, irritability, mental confusion, low sense of self-worth, impulsiveness, unpleasant & disturbing thoughts, negativity, cynicism, dependency, aggressiveness etc... It's like the author looked up the definition of neurosis and rewrote the character to fit that definition.  The reader is front and center of this emotional pin ball machine as her thoughts constantly whip back and forth.  She obviously has a death wish by the end of this book and breaks down in a series of suicidal actions and mental ramblings.  Gone is the girl who was forged in poverty and starvation to become a master hunter/bowman and the primary bread winner and protector of her family.  Gone is the girl with the strength of will and character that allowed her to win in the first hunger games book, instead the author seems to devolve Katniss into a complete mental breakdown.  This devolution started to in the previous book and just nose dived in this one. Not recommended to anyone, but please keep away from children!  Now if you are looking for story that depicts a woman who through severe intervention can survive such neurosis and suicidal behavior then maybe this is for you but if not then avoid at all cost.
034580404X|5.0|This was a great trilogy. I thoroughly enjoyed reading each book. I kept me interested throughout and I loved the characters.
B005WGBQ9G|5.0|Season 2 definitely is better - if you put down your adolescent penchant for the cheap zombie gore and scares (which get old).  Really - we have the development of what people do in a desperate survival situation - between daily life to crisis and how different people respond to it.  This season really starts to drive deeper with each character and does it masterfully.  Some make you scratch your head - you can understand their logic... maybe not agree... or maybe even be confused (which is excellent, the human mind is too complicated to be framed as simply as a lot of directors/writers do).  Anyways - GREAT series - it has elements that keep me interested as well as plenty of thought provoking situations.  And yes - there still is that quick-easy zombie clash every now and again to give you that fun jolt of undead action.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Great game.  Very addictive.  Great graphics, so far not freezing up as it does when you play on Facebook.  Love the Kindle Fire edition of this game.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|This novel was an emotionally wrenching portrayal of the infamous Velodrome d'Hiver carried out on July 16-17, 1942 when Jewish men, women, and over 4,000 children between the ages of 2 and 12 were rounded up by their own countrymen the local French police and sent to Auschwitz....none of them came back. In the end, France sent nearly 80,000 Jews to the death camps and only 2,000 or so came back. This book highlights one of the most infamous and shameful periods in the modern history of France. The story revolves around 10 year old Sarah Starzynski and the plight of her family during this phase of the Shoah (Holocaust). The story continues in 2002 when writer Julia Jarmond, an American journalist living in Paris with her French husband, starts composing a story for her newspaper about the events of July 16, 1942 to coincide with the 60th anniversary of the event. Secrets held for over 60 years slowly become revealed that tie Julia's husband's family to the family of Sarah Starzynski.<br /><br />It was not until 1995 that French President Jacques Chirac, who had just been elected, officially acknowledged France's complicity in the murder and deportation of the Jews of Europe.<br /><br />Zakhor.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|this app. is great for kids and adults. I would recommend this game to everyone! The. only thing I would suggest is: make it a little easier to get acorns. The kids get a little impatient. sometimes.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|Is an ok app. after a little bit it gets too hard and you have to skip some levels.  It is VERY addictive!  Cant get off the app.
034580404X|5.0|My daughter was reading the first book and told me I should read it so she loaned it to me. I knew it was a controversial book but I kept an open mind. I started reading it and couldn't put it down! I just had to order the boxed set so I ordered it through Amazon. I couldn't wait to get it so that I could read the other two books! I always had my nose stuck in them. I hope that E.L.James is writing another fantastic book like these.
0439023521|5.0|I read it and couldn't stop reading it, definetely is a must read you'll love it and wanted it to read more and more.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I see lots of mixed reviews about this series...personally, I love it! There's times when its raunchy an times when its sweet...I think the author did a great job mixing the two into a sexy, passionate, beautiful love story. This book made me laugh, cry, be inspired in my own love life, please continue to write E L James, I will read them all.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Reading the first few chapters was the most difficult part for me. Gale this...hunting that....blahblahblah  is basically all I saw on the begining pages. But once the actual games began, well that's a whole dif story. I became addicted to it almost immedietly after the games started.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I found this boring, repetitive, and with NO story at all.<br />Can't figure what what the hype is....are people really this desperate for some physicality, even to the point of abuse??
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this app is super fun and well developed. I have not had any issues with it yet... no glitches.  very satisfied!
B000OYC7A8|5.0|David Gilmour Live will keep alive his genius and his contribution to Pink Floyd. This DVD being in Blu Ray is a plus. It's one of my standouts of my library.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|most of the games have similar goals and skills. but its cool for passing the time just not a lot of variety so far. and not all the controls are responsive enough
B006ZNRD06|5.0|Has been working great on my Fire now for over 6 months. Has played every video format that I've thrown at it. Yes its not &quot;free&quot; its a trial so you see if it works for you.

B0066W1AZK|3.0|The kinds kept beating me :( But the quality and the simplicity of the game helped improve my chess skills.
B000F6YW0S|5.0|Mesmerizing! I have been listening to these suites in many forms and they all have their strengths. John Williams's interpretation of Bach's Lute Suites on Guitar are beautifully played and the soundscapes he creates are bound to found a way into your mind. If I listen to these as a drive I simply cannot help myself humming along as they come across as a song. Regardless, these are pieces that you will treasure if you are fond of Bach's compositions and/or the guitar. Bach often used his compositions in many ways (e.g. cello or lute). As another reviewer stated the guitar is the main instrument in this recording from 1975. It is very beautiful and is likely to be a desert island disc.
0571238343|4.0|This is a great reference book. I used this in college as a text book and thought it to be something I would be able to use in the future as well.
B000FCKGPC|2.0|First, I loved the first three books.  But, this one is a total flop with almost no forward movement to the plot line.  The dialog drags on to the point of tedium in the extreme...the book could have been cut in a third without losing anything to the telling of the tale.  I'm in a real quandary whether to bother with the next book...if it is more of the same, think I'll pass.<br /><br />Martin needs to get back to the basics and story writing style of the earlier books!!!
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I've been a Rush fan for 7 years now, and own all their albums on CD. I LOVED this album. The entire story being told has a sense of wonder and discovery about it. There aren't and bad songs on here, none that I will skip on impulse. All the songs are fun, and the guys are still playing as strong as ever. A MUST BUY for Rock fans.
0375869026|5.0|I order this book for my daughter. I found a great deal here. I am very happy with my order.  It's was very fast and no damage.<br />I would recommendation for everyone.
B005IQZB14|1.0|Whiny and self-absorbed, made me wish she had fallen off the cliff after her stupid boot.  Save your money until this loser learns how to write and finds something interesting to write about.  Who cares what Oprah thinks!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|easy 2 use great 4 church. handy on the go Bible. this is jus s very good app. I dnt have 2 worry bout losing my place when reading.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|this calc is simple and with large display. don't have to be worried about fat fingered typos. also handy to use on a desk or anywhere else by just switching apps.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Lots of differnt levels to choose from; u can play easy to hard. Lots of fun, a must have, one of my new favorites :)
0547569653|4.0|This book does not hold you in suspense from page to page but there is enough information and stories in it to keep you reading to see what transpires next in the life of Scott Jurek.  Scott shares his personal experences growing up and his transformation into and ultrarunner and vegan.  I have tried several of the recipes included and they are quite good.  This is not a \\"how to training aid\\" but rather an insight into how Jurek handled his own progression.  There are accounts of his experiences in many of the ultra races he participated in.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I've read everything he has written and this one does not disappoint!  I'd like to get inside of his head for a day just to see how his thought patterns work...the flow from start to finish, from plot to plot, all fit and make for great reading.<br /><br />I just found out that he's going to be one of the speakers at the Savannah (GA) Book Fair next February...you can be sure I'll be in the front listening to what he has to say!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I think that if you have a daughter or son that they would love this game as much as I do it is fun and adorable.
B003F3NEBG|5.0|This is without a doubt the most faithful adaptation of the book. The actors are wonderful. Despite other reviews,I think Colin Firth is wonderful as Darcy,his acting skills make it easy to discern Darcy's thoughts without need for dialogue. This version has several nice touches-after Lizzie and Darcy's blowout argument while Lizzie is visiting Charlotte,we see our 2 main characters ruminating over each others words,whilst seeing the others reflection in mirror. I felt this version beautifully shows,as the book did,Lizzy and Darcy's realization of how prejudiced they are about each other and their families-and subsequently how they overcome this. Never mind about \\"special editions\\" or blu ray-if you love Austen you owe it to yourself to see this series-I guarantee you will fall in love with Austen's words,and her characters,all over again
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game I have it on my I pod touch and its a little easier but I still love it on a kindle fire :) :) :)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is the best kindle fire calculator out there.........<br />there are other ones that costs money that really SUCK!!!!! d&bull;_&bull;b
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great read, totally expected not to enjoy this book as much as I did, ended up not able to put it down!
0374275637|5.0|Author's lucid style of writing makes this boring subject very interesting. I have read all the chapters and my 'remembering self' and 'experience self' agree the most interesting chapter is where the author rips apart interviewing and task observations as the best methods of candidate selection. I like this the best because I was never good at interviews although I have been rated as a good performer in my yearly appraisals. Years later when I went to the other side of the table I didn't still get how 1/2 hr of talk and a probable answer to case-study or a coding question can bring out the best in a candidate; it certainly never brought out my best. This subjectivity, also talked about Malcolm Gladwell in one of his essays on Ivy League selection process, is not only detrimental to candidates but also to the institute/organization and society as a whole.<br /><br />I am sure everyone can relate this way to some or the other aspect of behavioral research presented in this book. The author keeps it short and terse. I never felt that the author was exaggerating or harping on one point. The book is a very good read; I am on to footnotes now.
0061438294|4.0|Enjoyed the book, actually learned some new things on reading people's body language.  I plan on reading the book again and highlighting important points.
B005LAII3U|5.0|This remake returns to the Big Screen, starring Colin Farrell, and this compelling fight for defeat aims to please! PG-13. Cast is Superb and Special Effects Stunning. Douglas is a factory worker with a stable job and loving wife. A company offers him the memory of the ultimate espionage adventure and because he's desperate for a vacation, he decides a virtual vacation is better than no vacation as he agrees. As the memories are being implanted, the system goes haywire, then breaks down. The drama begins as Douglas runs to unite with a rebel soldier as the war begins. Douglas is on the hunt for a power-crazed leader, who wants to control the entire free world. A thrilling battle becomes explosive. Highly Recommended for science fiction lovers!
B004UXUX7S|5.0|I've now seen all of the best picture nominees from last year and The Descendants is far and away the best of them all.  The storyline, acting, setting, and soundtrack were all excellent.  I don't particularly like Clooney movies as they tend to insist upon themselves too much.  But this performance was low-key and played perfectly.  I enjoyed every aspect of the flick which is something I can't say for most of the nominated movies, especially War Horse (yuck).<br /><br />The Descendants losing out to the Artist leaves me with the same feeling I had when Fargo lost out to The English Patient, and Avatar lost out to The Hurt Locker.  Pure travesty.  As I've said numerous times, a great movie will stand the test of time.  The Descendants, Avatar, and Fargo are great movies.  The Artist, Hurt Locker, and The English Patient are good but certainly not great.  Well, actually, The English Patient just flat out sucks.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This app is a must play. Really cool characters and very fun easy to play.  I can't stop plaing this game!
030758836X|5.0|Love when I come across such a well-thought out book. One of those rare occasions were my dread of finishing it increases with every page.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|like Mario bro. I had when I was a kid but with leprucans<br />like it a lot its fun. my daughter will really like it and it should be easy enough for her to play
1907563202|5.0|To say that I loved this book would be an understatement for sure.  It is filled with wonderful items to make and the directions are perfect. I would highly recommend this book.
B00785P2QC|3.0|I enjoy playing this game it passes the time well.  I like how the game keeps playing when I am not there.  One of my friends plays it too.  I am trying g to get all of the properties.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|Thought this would be a great app to have, since I've got several songs on my cloud drive. I used an AmazonLocal voucher to get three songs I wanted, Amazon had them, voucher = 3 for free! Sweet! Loaded from cloud to device no worries. Built a play list, success! Start driving and blasting tunes. iPod goes to autolock, player quits. Doesn't do this with iTunes player. No way in settings to keep playing when in sleep mode. So to keep music playing, I have to constantly fiddle with my iPod. But, I can't put it to the home screen, or it stops playing. I like to listen while working, but won't ever be able to listen to Amazon music cause the MP3 player is CRAP! CRAP CRAP CRAP! Worthless for a player that quits when the device screen goes dark. I've scoured the net for answers, and found no answers, but this same issue across multiple devices, including phones, tablets, etc.<br /><br />Can't believe this app was rushed with such a simple flaw NOT ADDRESSED!
B00683JLXA|4.0|love the sound effects, i just wish there were more levels!  there are almost 200, but this game is so addictive i am constantly playing it.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|I hesitantly purchased the first book (kindle version) after a few people I knew (and respected) were reading it.  I had read reviews and thought it wasn't for me but caved in `thinking' if it is so so popular it must be better than it seems, and secretly hoping I would be delighted - but alas my 'inner goddess' was not pleased, and certainly my brain was not engaged at all.<br /><br />I simply add to the many existing reviews if you think it's not for you IT IS NOT.  Don't fall for the 'best seller' marketing.  It is totally unbelievable, extremely repetitive, unrealistic, poorly written and does not deserve your attention.<br /><br />I have to wonder how any self respecting independent thinking woman can ever be sucked into this book - who actually can be excited by a man who controls what you wear, eat, think, and do and who physically punishes you for not obeying his absolute command.  This is a backward step for humanity.<br /><br />The BDSM and porn market must be licking their lips in anticipation of new converts.  But as for literary merits it does not rate at all.  Thinking about it I wonder did one of the authors teenage sons ghost write this?
B0058VW36U|5.0|I whunt it to be free sooooooooo bad so pleas oh ever made thise game pleas make it free .Why I put all the stars on it I playd it before in a store

B0057AOOZ0|5.0|Beyonc'e made me dance to \\"Dance for You.\\" I like this song and many of her other songs that make you feel sexy and want to dance.
0307744434|2.0|I'm 70% into the book and still wondering what the heck's going to happen. Beautifully written, yes, with compelling imagery and immaculate detail of the magical circus, but it sorely lacks a definite plot. There's hardly any character development--I have yet to call any one of them my favorite, and there's way too much description and little dialogue/ meaningful interaction. The romance is ill-written with no essence of chemistry... I find this book such a shame because of its lost potential. The writing (grammar/style) is SUPERB but the plot SUCKS. All I can say is--if you want to practice your GRE vocabulary or need an example on how to input more compelling and vivid descriptions/imagery into your own writing, check it out. Otherwise, do yourself a favor and skip this one.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|i like to play with gravilux when i'm getting stressed out and need to chill. it is soooo soothing but also fun. i enjoy just spacing out on it or also experimenting with ways to make different designs etc. the only improvement i want to see is an option to have it in 3-D when you wear glasses. that would make it my #1 favorite app. oh, and add some generative music attached to the particles and that would make it even cooler! but i give it 5 stars as it is because there aren't many apps like this and it's also great to show to friends.
B0063IH60K|5.0|awesome game!!!! I'm not a big card player but this game is fun and it keeps your brain working. I would recommend this game to everyone ages 7+
B0061S0A64|4.0|once i figured out how this worked i had a lot of fun with it. everything you do with this app pretty much sounds gokd. the down-side is that everything sounds the same. i wish it felt a little more like i was making my own music with it rather than just rearranging someone else's.  also, drawing (musically) on the background would be much improved if it would fade in/out rather than the sound coming in so suddenly. but it's very original for a music app and pretty relaxing.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I literally just finished my first workout with this DVD level 1. This DVD is short and sweet and you will sweat!!! I needed something I could do at home after work, so I thought this would be a great buy & it was. Jillian is straight to the point; no bullshit (which is what I liked) and she makes you feel like you can do anything. WAY better than that P90X guy. I couldn't complete every work out for the entire alloted time, but I still feel like I got my ass kicked. I had my first baby 12 weeks ago and I think this workout is a great way to get your body back.  Put the baby to sleep and pop this bad boy in!! After one workout I know if I stick to it I will lose the baby weight. I feel this DVD will get me back to my old self.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I read a lot, about a book a week for most of my life and i practically read this one straight through.  I love it, and everybody that i have let read it has felt the same way.  Very touching and heart wrenching at times, but worth the journey!<br /><br />I have never recommended a book to anybody and I recommend this book to everybody!
B004RE29WW|1.0|I thought Sci-fi \\"buffs\\" were smarter than this.  I am not even that big on plot points, but this movie fails.  Ok, in some ways the movie isn't too bad since i cared for the general plot and characters.  Since i am not a big fan of the Alien series i did not feel cheated by the deaths of the kid or marine.  What bothers me are the laughable effects and major plot holes which i guess fans seem to want to overlook because they blindly love the series.<br /><br />First; Why is the alien killing?  It isn't eating, it isn't protecting, and is not building a nest.... c'mon people!  I mean Jason Voorhees had more reason to kill than this alien.<br /><br />and Second; Why did the Corporate Force fly all the way out there, armed to the teeth only to stand there at the end and watch that platform SLOOOOOWLY turn so Ripley could jump into the vat and kill herself saying, \\"What is she doing?!?\\"  DUH - stop her, you have like 5 minutes while that platform turns to that vat of lead...<br /><br />At no point did i feel that the alien did nothing more than provide jump scares.

B003O86FMW|4.0|I thought the first book was good (3 stars), but this one was even better.  I do wish the author had discussed the social and political tensions even more.
0553801473|2.0|Like many readers, I was smitten with the world Martin created in [[ASIN:0553386794 A Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 1)]], was caught up in the vivid showing of the battles and the intrigue in [[ASIN:0345535421 A Clash of Kings (HBO Tie-in Edition): A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Two]], and was impressed by his ruthlessness towards his characters in [[ASIN:055357342X A Storm of Swords (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 3)]].  As with many readers and fans, I cut Martin some slack in [[ASIN:0553582038 A Feast for Crows (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 4)]] - the storyline was just too big, apparently for a single book. A rationale I thought reasonable, and although the storyline moved at a glacial pace, I had high hopes for some resolution of loose ends from Book 4, and some forward movement in _A Dance with Dragons_.  Were that it was so.  _A Dance with Dragons_ was in many ways, an utter disappointment.<br /><br />That is not to say I found Book 5 a total bust.  To avoid spoilers, I'll write in broad terms.  I did like the wider sense of geo-politics Martin develops here, as the conflict in Westeros has ramifications in the Free Cities and Valyria.  It was a relief to see the storylines that had diverged in _A Feast for Crows_  again rejoin each other, and readers are given a longer perspective of the political web that \\"the game of thrones\\" is: princes thought long dead instead found in hiding, old alliances and old rivalries between noble houses uncovered, details of storylines from the first four books (particularly around Daenyrs) brought to light.  In a perverse way, I also liked the lack of resolution of some of the story lines: tantalizing clues left about what will happen with Daenerys, Arya, the dragons; characters in difficult situations that I am anxious to see solved: Jon on the Wall, Bran Beyond the Wall, and Jamie and Brienne in the Riverlands.  As much as I enjoyed this, it was not enough to earn more than a mediocre review.<br /><br />There are many more points that I take issue with than there are redeeming features.  First is the geologic pace at which the story moves.  At just under 1000 pages, I had expected more forward movement of the plot.  This did not happen.  Stannis remains in the North.  Daenerys remains in Slaver's Bay.  Tyrion, for much of the story, is at sea - and so on ad nauseum with all the characters.  Books One and Two moved much more quickly, and which I liked much more..  Perhaps juggling 23 story lines has simply become untenable for Martin to maintain.  Another issue I had concerned the changes in authenticity of several of the characters.  While I recognize characters do (and should) change across the story line, Martin has several of his characters take almost 180 degree turns from who they were in the first four books - especially Jon (\\"The Night's Watch takes no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms\\") and Tyrion.  I also expected at least some sort of \\"chekcing in \\" with other characters from _A Feast for Crows_ would happen once the storylines from Book 4 was reunited in Book 5 - specifically the happenings and goings on of Sansa and Samwell Tarley.  It looks like readers will have to wait for the next installment to see what these characters have been up to.  In a similar vein,  Jamie was hardly mentioned at all.<br /><br />The divergence of story lines between Books 4 and 5 was a challenge as well.  As a relative new comer to the series, I had the advantage of being able to read the books more or less concurrently (I pity those who had to wait over four years between books), but even then I frequently found myself going back to _A Feast for Crows_ to reacquaint myself with characters and their stories that  I had fogotten all about, it having been 500 or 600 (or, in the case of Daenyrs) almost 900 pages since last they were a part of the story.  Some sort of prologue (other than the pointless prologue involving Wargs and apprentice maesters) recaping the story thus far would have been helpful, I think.<br /><br />As much as I am tempted to give _A Dance with Dragons_ a one-star rating, I can't.  This is a work in progress - I remain hopeful that, once the \\"Song of Fire and Ice\\" is completed, my objections and complaints will be inconsequential.  While I remain frustrated that the story has moved so little over the last two books, I also remain optimistic that there will be a payoff in the book(s) to come.  Those expectations aside, for a 1000 page investment in reading, there is precious little payoff for audiences here.ld have been helpful, I think.<br /><br />As much as I am tempted to give _A Dance with Dragons_ a one-star rating, I can't.

076531178X|5.0|[UPDATE: I just finished the trilogy, and due to the strength of the series as a whole, I changed my rating of this books from 4 to 5 stars, for I want to encourage people to read it as much as possible. If more interested in this change, read my review of book three in which I praise the series as a whole (no spoilers).]<br /><br />The writing is better than and more consistent, solid, and mature than books like The Hunger Games and The Name of the Wind.<br /><br />However, the emotions feel a little bit thin at times, and the tension isn't always as tight as it could be. I think the result of that lack of tension in this context (as opposed to it being intended as in a sort of literary work) takes away from the significance of the work.<br /><br />The beginning started strong. The world, characters, and situation was introduced smoothly, and they were attractive. Furthermore, Sanderson does a great job creating a wold that is internally cohesive and has a full history; many things outside the books main plot-line are mentioned; this gives a sense of realness to the world.<br /><br />The middle of the book is good. But there are times when I was a bit bored by the explanations of the magics \\"rules\\" or the political planning. And a couple significant events in the middle didn't feel as significant as they should have--but that could just be my fault (a reader does bring his moods and mindset to the book). And this is also where the emotions felt thin at times; they often felt too \\"telly\\" or repetitive; and I think this gave it a bit of a YA feel, in a bad way, but thankfully only a few times.<br /><br />The end of the book was VERY strong. I listened to the audiobook, and the last like 3 hours were super engaging. Just perfect; nothing more needs said there. The ending is well worth this read, and I certainly intend to finish the trilogy.<br /><br />PS: The book felt more like a sci-fi than a fantasy to me. Kinda interesting. I'm not certain why. I guess the crew reminded me of Cowboy Bebop or something. And the world just didn't feel like a classic fantasy. I don't know if I just wasn't 'reading it right' but the mid-evilness of it fell into the background. A few times I had to remind myself, \\"Oh yeah, I guess they do use carts and swords and stuff...\\"<br /><br />PSS: The audiobook reader, Michael Kramer, did a great job.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|i love to play chess and i never get to play eith anyone. So i got this app. It is a very good app. I recommend this app to people that like chess!
0765356139|5.0|This book is as good as the first. I give it an extra star though this book probably has similar faults as I mentioned in the first book because by this point I swallowed everything, hook, line, and sinker (I read it in a day and a half, which is much faster than I normally read books).<br /><br />This was a brilliant sequel. If you liked the first, you must move on to this one.<br /><br />The only other thing I have to add, and it mostly applies to the first, is that, while I have read a lot of books and have forgotten much of what I read, while reading this book I felt like it has the best action scenes of any book I've read.<br /><br />I feel like many books rely on emotional and plot tension to give action significance, and while this is indispensable, unless my memory fails me, the average action scene in a books are fairly simple and often short.<br /><br />Most action scenes are: significant plot point -> fight -> hero struggles -> succeeds! -> moves on.<br /><br />These books don't dispose of that format, but they execute it with such technical detail that it's beautiful. Furthermore, Sanderson allows power differentials that rarely occur in most books: generally you can't have someone totally raping face. But Sanderson is able to write action so that it fits consistently within the world and doesn't feel cheapened by its glorious fancifulness, where the pure ownage doesn't take away from the conflict and tension that drives the book.<br /><br />In short, they are like daydreams I've often have, with all the juicy and technical martial details ;), not vague combat.<br /><br />PS. I forgot to mention: The \\"trust\\" theme was a bit overstated and kinda redundant.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Cute game.  Love to play it with my four year old. Even better with updates since the movie opened. Keep the updates coming.
0765356147|5.0|A marvelous conclusion.<br /><br />I can't praise this series highly enough. I want to use profanity to stiff arm you into reading it; of course that wouldn't work.<br /><br />I am so impressed with this series. Some books I hear the hype of and get excited for but then am disappointed, other books I approach not expecting too much, and because I had heard nothing about this book until a single friend recommended it to me, I didn't have high expectations. Boy was I in for a surprise. This series should be WAY more popular than it is.<br /><br />This is the best series I've ever read, or as good as Harry Potter, but with a lot more going for it than HP. There are many books I love (e.g. Dune, Ender's Game) where the first book is excellent but the others are somewhere between \\"pretty good\\" and \\"crap\\". The Mistborn trilogy, however, is solid all the way through.<br /><br />Even though it's a series, the first book has a nice conclusion; it doesn't have a crappy hanging ending to coax you into continuing the series, and yet the whole series fits and flows together perfectly.<br /><br />I have never read an epic/high fantasy series that lacked boring so much. There's no sense in which Sanderson is writing more plot or world development for the sake of more, and he never dawdles on scenes or conversations or side plots . It all fits perfectly. It unravels in a uniform pace. In the end of this last book you learn more about the world just as you did in the first. There are no cumbersome info dumbs; it just flows.<br /><br />The series is as engaging as the best pop/genre fiction on the market (e.g. Hunger Games), but it offers more. He dexterously brings in religion (its benefits, faults, creation, and frustrations of would-be believers) and political theory (governing, parentalism, democracy, etc.) into the plot and dialog without being overhanded or pushing any agenda (Heinlein needs schooled in this area) or even being boring! There aren't long intricate boring-as-crapdiscussions about these things; they are brought up and add depth to the works but don't hold back the story or pacing one bit. There are also themes of hope, and faith, and class issues.<br /><br />The book also has a great female protagonist, interesting characters, and good relationships. They have personal struggles, and fight to prevent the end of the world. It's an intense ride. Read it! It's as exciting as a young adult adventure stories, but with the aforementioned content and death and desperation that nudge it towards the mature. Again, read it!<br /><br />PS. Maybe it's like Harry Potter meets Game of Thrones meets The Departed meets Assassin's Creed; now who wouldn't want a bite of that?<br /><br />PSS. Series like HP and, particularly, Game of Thrones took remarkably long, in retrospect, to get into the mainstream eye. This series seriously deserves that attention, and I think it will get there. Unfortunately the main garner of the attention is putting 'em on the big screen/tv. I kinda doubt that'll happen with this series. But they are relatively new, the first novel only 4 years old, and this is the first trilogy of three trilogies. I'm excited for the future of this, and for the future of Sanderson.

Susan has added more character to her voice and softened her delivery somewhat.  Their evolving sound is thrilling to hear, especially a live performance.

0441013597|5.0|To borrow a line from a film adaption of this novel: \\"When politics and religion ride in the same cart, the whirlwind follows.\\" Frank Herbert's Dune is easily one of the most layered works of fiction produced during the twentieth century. From examining byzantine political gambits to the human penchant for hero worship, Herbert using a far-flung future setting to examine the best and worst aspects of human nature.

1935670913|5.0|I just read some review from someone who said this was nothing more than an ego book. I LOVE that s/he doesn't \\"get\\" what it's all about. This isn't a promo book for his books. It's showing us HOW he did it - so of course there are some true life references.<br /><br />How boring if he DIDN'T share his sage advice with his first person account. And I think what it all really boils down to are the ones who hate this book are the traditional publisher worshippers who loathe self publishing and can't stand anyone who takes a no BS approach to success.<br /><br />He's VERY detailed with a business plan you can take - going so far as to tell you what kinds of things he says to people to build his loyal following. I love the complete outline and am vigorously taking notes for my pending fiction publication.<br /><br />I went snooping and found that the ones most adamantly hating on John Locke's advice were the same ones ankle chained to traditional publishing house advice of trying to get a local bookstore to host you for an author signing, etc.<br /><br />This is not how it works online and it's not the best use of your time anymore!<br /><br />One reviewer gave snarky mentions about how self serving he is in it. He's specifically hammering in the FACT that you have to be generous and loyal to your following and personally respond to emails and develop friendships. He is ALL about ethics (and the specific reviewer I read gave another author's promotion book a GREAT rating, where THAT author teaches people how to write their own reviews).<br /><br />Just goes to show you that you have to read it yourself. Either you embrace realistic advice, or you turn your nose up in the air like the snooty person you want to be and keep going after those author appearances and press release and agent fantasies that you've had for decades.<br /><br />This is one Kindle book that won't be getting deleted from my Kindle.
B00007KQA3|5.0|I gave the movie a `5 stars' because I read the book (some time ago), and the screenplay captured to mood, the dreariness, the hopelessness, the dialogue and the characters inch perfectly.  As you read a novel, you come to picture in your mind the characters the author has created.  The characters played on the screen by John Hurt, Richard Burton and Suzanna Hamilton are the 100% embodiment of what Orwell intended.  The novel is not compromised in plot, dialogue, or character portrayal whatsoever.<br /><br />The finite movie run time of 113 min. did not allow the movie to deliver all the miserable detail of a limitless novel.  E.g., the novel devoted much time into detailing \\"Newspeak\\", which was the devolution of the English language into a dumbed down simplified version of itself in step with the dumbing down of it's citizenry into a mindless mob.  But in defense of the movie, that detail does not readily lend itself to the screen because it requires no characters or dialogue.<br /><br />It remains a mystery to me why Orwell (real name Eric Blair), who was a devout socialist, would portray the outcome of socialism in the honest manner that he did.  Nevertheless, my bottom line critical analysis is that the movie = the novel.  If that's what you're looking for in a novel based movie, you will give \\"1984\\" a `5 stars' also

B0073PZIYI|4.0|Like the current addiction in Hollywood, the dark scenes at night detracted from the visual and plot line. I enjoyed &#34;Logan's Run&#34; although the chase was too long and did not fit with the character's friendship. In this movie the pursuit is illogical after the interaction with the main character. Still I enjoyed the overall plot and never got bored. The morality play about the idle rich who live a long time but are not alive versus the poor who appreciate anything they can get really strikes a chord in this country today. I liked the solution to the time squeeze and how the father was exposed as cold blooded. I look back on the movie wishing that I could have felt more emotionally connected to the two main characters. I suspect that the actors were too stiff and the director failed to get them to exude more feeling. This could have been a great movie.

John Prine comes from my hometown of Chicago (technically Maywood) and released this in the glory days of the the Chicago folk revival of the 60s and 70s, playing at the Earl of Old Town, Holsteins, etc. with the likes of Steve Goodman, Fred Holstein, Utah Phillips, Joan Baez, etc. etc. etc.
B003L77G06|2.0|After viewing other reviews. The product review has to do with a review of the quality of the DVD and the quality of the movie. The star ratings are assigned to the seller. A lot of the sellers have different star ratings. Otherwise sellers can get away with sending buyers low quality dvds.<br /><br />The season itself was so far my favorite season.<br /><br />As I indicated in my previous review:<br /><br />The second disk of the second season that I order has a bad area on it. Unfortnately the episodes on the second DVD disk is the reason I order the second season. During a couple of the episodes, the picture moves really slow and afterwards freezes. It is very irritating. If you have a DVD set that has a bad disk you should not sell it to someone. I will never buy another used DVD set because of something like this happening. It's not worth the savings.

B0086213XW|4.0|Sarah Polley proves her impressive directorial and screenwriting debut, 2006's [[ASIN:B000RQDMWA Away From Her]] starring a luminous, Oscar-nominated Julie Christie as an Alzheimer's patient, was no fluke with this incisive look at a most inchoate love triangle. With a title taken from Leonard Cohen's cultish song, this clear-eyed yet melancholic 2012 drama once again showcases Polley's prodigious acumen in capturing the complexity of adult relationships without casting blame or judgment on the parties involved. The focal point of the triangle is 28-year-old Margot, an aspiring writer from Toronto on an assignment in Nova Scotia to write the copy for a travel brochure on historic Louisbourg. There she meets Daniel, also from Toronto where he is a struggling artist and a rickshaw driver. An attraction is almost immediate but not consummated. When they fly home on the same plane, Margot discovers he lives just across the street from her, which complicates matters since she's been married for five years to Lou, a cookbook author specializing in chicken dishes. Their marriage is comfortable, and their interactions reflect a lived-in familiarity marked by cute practical jokes and quirky riffs of humor.<br /><br />But what Margot sees in Daniel is something that's been missing in her life, a sexual spark that excites her, even though she dares not act upon it since she really does love Lou in spite of his foibles - including a certain apathy about their relationship that he thinks is perfectly normal. She could see spending the rest of her life with Lou, but she wonders if he is her soul-mate or whether it's worth the risk to find out if Daniel is really the one. Blinded by desires she had yet to tap in her marriage, Margot knows if she acts upon those feelings, there will come some point where she'll have to make a hard decision between Lou and Daniel. Michelle Williams captures Margot's inner conflict with palpable empathy as you see her character expose her thoughts in moments of quiet in which she is the harshest judge of her actions. It's a shining performance which compares favorably to her evocative Marilyn Monroe in [[ASIN:B0076NKNLA My Week With Marilyn]]. There is a deliberate vagueness to the two men. As Daniel, Luke Kirby ([[ASIN:B00000F5B5 Mambo Italiano]]) manages to convey the lure of \\"the other man\\" without coming across as despicable even though it's clear he wants her from afar. At the same time, it's clear that Margot and Daniel have little in common, and they make you wonder how sustainable their relationship could be.<br /><br />Seth Rogen does something surprising in this film - he acts. He still doesn't stray that far away from his shaggy-dog comic persona, but he realistically shows how Lou's contentment and impassivity bring Margot both lasting security and unresolvable fear and longing. Similarly, Sarah Silverman makes her few scenes count as Lou's plainspoken sister Geraldine, who is married with two kids and an alcoholic just out of rehab, especially when she tells Margot what she thinks of her ultimate decision. That Polley can coax such fine dramatic work from Rogen and Silverman is a credit to her growing confidence as a filmmaker. As a native Canadian, she also presents Toronto as a setting with its own unique identity (versus other directors who use it as a double for New York or Chicago), and her cinematographer Luc Montpellier brings a lushness to the images that adds to the intoxication Margot is feeling. There are still flaws - the ramshackle pace adds to an already lengthy 116-minute running time, and the climactic time-lapse montage feels out-of-place for a film that had tread so lightly before. Regardless, this film should play on a double bill with David Lean's [[ASIN:0780023420 Brief Encounter]] to show how mores have evolved about infidelity over seventy years. Whatever the outcome may be, the bottom line is that there are no easy answers.moments of quiet in which she is the harshest judge of her actions. It's a shining performance which compares favorably to her evocative Marilyn Monroe in [[ASIN:B0076NKNLA My Week With Marilyn]]. There is a deliberate vagueness to the two men. As Daniel, Luke Kirby ([[ASIN:B00000F5B5 Mambo Italiano]]) manages to convey the lure of \\"the other man\\" without coming across as despicable even though it's clear he wants her from afar. At the same time, it's clear that Margot and Daniel have little in common, and they make you wonder how sustainable their relationship could be.<br /><br />Seth Rogen does something surprising in this film - he acts. He still doesn't stray that far away from his shaggy-dog comic persona, but he realistically shows how Lou's contentment and impassivity bring Margot both lasting security and unresolvable fear and longing. Similarly, Sarah Silverman makes her few scenes count as Lou's plainspoken sister Geraldine, who is married with two kids and an alcoholic just out of rehab, especially when she tells Margot what she thinks of her ultimate decision. That Polley can coax such fine dramatic work from Rogen and Silverman is a credit to her growing confidence as a filmmaker. As a native Canadian, she also presents Toronto as a setting with its own unique identity (versus other directors who use it as a double for New York or Chicago), and her cinematographer Luc Montpellier brings a lushness to the images that adds to the intoxication Margot is feeling. There are still flaws - the ramshackle pace adds to an already lengthy 116-minute running time, and the climactic time-lapse montage feels out-of-place for a film that had tread so lightly before.

One think I am sure is that with this book, that is rather long and difficult to understand at some points, you may be tempted to call it quits time and again, but I suggest to go all the way to the end, as it is worth reading it all. It was listed among the best novels of the XX century, I would not call it a novel though, but a fiction humorous essay
B005FITIDC|3.0|This is one of the tougher movies I've ever tried to rate. It is entirely due to my difficulty in separating the story from the movie.<br /><br />Here's the scoop. Sam Childers is a bad guy. We meet him as he's getting out of prison. He's a junkie biker. He has no reservations about inflicting serious pain on people. He wants his wife, who has found Jesus and a respectable job, to go back to being a stripper. After a particularly rough bout with drugs he begins to re-examine his life. He goes straight. Finds a job. Builds a church. Starts a construction company. Goes to the Sudan to help out there and finds he genuinely cares about the lives of those people. He's now on a mission.<br /><br />This is certainly a great story. Here's a guy who's scraping the bottom of the barrel, turns himself around, and becomes a true, moving force in the lives of a tortured people. But I don't know if the movie itself is all that spectacular. The director, Mark Forster, has had some outstanding movies to his credit. He seemed to want to play this one straight, with little razzle dazzle. But it all seemed too familiar. I felt as though I'd seen most of these scenes before in other movies. There was too little here that was fresh. It was all very professional and tight. You could practically set your watch to it it was so evenly paced. Maybe that was the problem. It needed something to shake loose from the normal.<br /><br />This is by no means a bad movie and it's easy to watch. During the closing credits the viewer is treated to actual footage of Childers and others depicted in the movie. This is a serious plus. Some might take exception to the Jesus thumping, gun toting point of view, but that's how the story goes. It just needed something to take it to the next level.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|As I read this book - based primarily upon the hype surrounding it - I kept wondering \\"Where is the friggin' editor?\\"  While the promise of learning more about the BDSM culture ( on which Book One was quite light) kept me going, I found myself horrified by the  repetitive use of words such as \\"clamber\\" and phrases like \\"fire up the mean machine\\"  ( this for a computer).  There is a not a character in the book with more depth or feeling than cardboard cut-outs.  To be fair, however, it does fulfill its role as \\"mommy porn\\" and may well liven up bedrooms around the country.
0345803485|2.0|I checked out the books at my local library<br />wanted to see what all the fuss was about<br />I hate to give a bad review on a person's story or anything for that matter but I just do not understand what women find so hot about the realtionship between anna and christian. he is controling, abusive, short tempered and so on. I hoped there would be a back story about his life, his up bringing with the grey's, seeing more of dr. flynn through out the book, he needed to get to know anna more than just sleep with her. Iam old fashioned,  she went to bed with him right away. get to know him first!<br />the author made anna weak, sure she got tough in the third book when christian was mad about her being pregant. she stood her ground then. but she always needed to be with christian. let her get some breathing space once awhile in the story. he is always there. she had to think about the contract.no she did not have to think about it ,the first read through she should had told him forget it, no matter how hot he was.<br />why not make the characters british since they use british words. and the story be in london england.<br />and anna be a 30 year old with a successful job with good morals and a kick your ass attitude and christian a 45 year old prince who has a dark past,suspense,interesting people in the story, a chase or two, mild sex scenes, heartache,understanding of the people in the story. what Im saying is interesting read, but not to be made in to a movie that should go straight to dvd. or be on hbo late night hours movie.

B008CJ0KI8|5.0|By the time Frank Ocean made his recent broadcast television debut on the Jimmy Fallon show performing the epic \\"Bad Religion\\" the secret was out and so was Frank. His admission in a recent letter on tumbir.com that he was bi-sexual finally dragged hip hop with its often vicious homophobia screaming into the 21st century and hopefully the whole horrible façade of hyper-masculinity associated with the genre crumbles with it. What is as important as Ocean's letter is the fact that he has talent to spare and then more, as such \\"Channel Orange\\" sees the birth of a new and potentially huge star.<br /><br />\\"Channel Orange\\" is much more than a hip hop album. It fits easily into an R&B framework and within its grooves are jazz, soul and rapping. It also is interspersed with musical fragments and interludes alia Kanye West (who Ocean has recorded with) where ideas literally spill over. The recent review in the Observer accurately describes an album where \\"beats run on after melodies recede, lonely guitars twang away in the margins, soundscapes overlap. The album, like the mixtape, is broken up with bursts of radio static, fragments of conversation, juddering tape-deck click\\". And yet at the core of Ocean's work are great songs. The sumptuous R&B ballad \\"Thinkin bout you\\" brings a huge burst of summer sun shining brightly into the dour pre Olympic grey of a British summer. The best days of Stevie Wonder are recalled on the pulsating beauty of \\"Sweet Life\\" one of the albums standouts where Ocean's vocals are at their best and throughout you can hear traces of other greats such as Al Green, Prince and Marvin Gaye. As with these artists Ocean is not afraid to tackle social issues. \\"Super Rich Kids\\" with Earl Sweat has a \\"Benny and Jets\\" style pounding backdrop on a song infused with pointed commentary on the class system in California. Equally the self explanatory \\"Crack Rock\\" talks of \\"smoking stones in abandoned homes\\" and the decent into drug hell. The big centrepiece of the album is the near 10 minute long \\"Pyramids\\" where Ocean throws in Tangerine Dream synths, lyrical references to Cheetahs and Cleopatra and a John Mayer guitar solo. It is where he shows his true potential on one of the best songs of 2012. The aforementioned \\"Bad Religon\\" is a big hymn like song where Ocean regrets \\"This unrequited love/ To me it's nothing but a one man cult and cyanide in my styrofoam cup/ I could never make him love me.\\" Other great songs pepper the album not least \\"Pink Matter\\" with Andre 3000, the excellent \\"Monks\\" and the soulful \\"Forest Gump\\".<br /><br />In a year that has already seen the superb invention of Death Grips much harder Public Enemy orientated \\"The Money Store\\" the release of \\"Channel Orange\\" represents more of soulful slow burn albeit it is highly commercial in parts. It is difficult not to swept up in the hype surrounding the release of \\"Channel Orange\\" with the Daily Telegraph calling it \\"magical\\" and the Times describing it as \\"astonishing\\". Frankly in terms of sheer invention it doesn't quite match \\"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\\" but it makes up for this with a set of songs destined to become recognised classics.

B001BPJJ1E|5.0|I'm not reviewing the DVD product so much as I'm reviewing the film itself. 1971's Melody is one of the most uplifting British youth love stories out there. It's very much a film from the early 70s, and one of the most unique things about it is that the story is told from kid's point of view rather than through the parents and teachers, which was very unusual for a film of that time. In that respect, the movie on many levels deals with rebellion against the older generations.<br /><br />On a side note, this film seems to be virtually unavailable/know in the US, but for some reason was a hit in several non-English speaking countries.<br /><br />The story concerns two 11-year-old English school children, Melody Perkins (Tracy Hyde), and Daniel Latimer (Mark Lester, of \\"Oliver\\" fame), who meet and instantly fall for each other. Much to the dismay of their teachers and parents, the young lovers spend alot of time together, even to the point of skipping school and going to a seaside amusement park. They both then decide to get married. With the help Daniel's friend Ornshaw (Jack Wild, also of \\"Oliver\\"), the couple is able to escape school again and have a \\"wedding\\" ceremony. All adults from the school find out, and attempt to stop it, which results in a final battle between the kids and the teachers. Ornshaw then helps Melody and Daniel escape on a railway car.<br /><br />The soundtrack is filled throughout with music by the Bee Gees, with songs such as \\"To Love Somebody\\", \\"Melody Fair,\\" and \\"First of May\\", which add to the film's overall uplifting feeling.  Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young's \\"Teach Your Children\\" plays out the final scenes.<br /><br />While some of the dialog and situations may be considered \\"corny\\", or unmemorable, the film nevertheless has a heart-warming plot with lovable characters, and a good example of British cinema from the 70s.
B0083GQKQG|2.0|It had the potential to be a great film about an anti-social child, a negligent father, a mother who is trying to work with a child she cannot bond with, and the carnage the child brings into their lives. Unfortunately, it takes an Oliver Stone turn for the worse. It starts out with the mother covered in what seems like bloody jello and brains rolling in some hippie orgy. It is filmed in flashbacks/flash forwards/flash sideways. It is extremely disjointed and unsettling.<br /><br /> It isn't until toward the end of the movie that it levels out and becomes a semi-recognizable story. It is a total train wreck the viewer cannot take their eyes off of. If the director could have taken some ADD medicine, it might have made a great movie. Tilda Swinton carries this disaster as best she can. John C Riley was a surprise. Known for his Will Ferrell movies, it was a shock to see him. He plays a father blind to his son's evil. His character is never truly explored. He just comes across as wanting to be his son's buddy, regardless of the child's behavior. He constantly makes his wife out to be the villain.<br /><br /> When Kevin is approximately between five and seven years old. He refuses to potty train and likes to torment his mother by pooping on himself. No matter how hard she works with him, his dead eyes and soul are impenetrable. She loses it, and he exploits her guilt.<br /><br /> She finally has a child who is loving and kind which they give the impression makes Kevin physically ill. The interesting dynamic of this film (and where it could have been explored further) is when Kevin is sick and cuddles his mom and rejects the dad. He shows the audience a clue that he knows who truly loves him (tries to love him) and who is a huge part of the problem (the dad).<br /><br />  When Kevin hurts the little sister, all the viewer can ask is was why is this kid not in a psych ward??? Ezra Miller plays fifteen year old Kevin. He could have been good, but his character is poorly developed. Granted the story is from the mother's perspective, but there needed to be more between teen Kevin and his mother for one to fully comprehend what the heck is going on. The killing spree is glossed over. The end is sloppy. All the audience can think of is, \\"thank God it's over, but now there are a bunch of unanswered questions!\\" One literally has to shake the movie off. It is that disturbing.
0345803485|3.0|I understand why this book is important. I understand that it's a hit because it made the sub/dom fantasy accessible to the masses. I enjoy reading the story and want to know what happens.<br /><br />That said, I was sorely disappointed and really wish this had not been THE book that introduced this fantasy.<br /><br />My problems with it:<br />1. The sex scenes are not well written enough to serve as actual erotica. They don't bring the reader into the moment well enough.<br />2. The main character is a virgin. The majority of people reading this book are not virgins. It bothers me that the fantasy is about being virginal and inexperienced.<br />3. The fantasy is associated with abuse. I'm sure this is common, but it annoys me that that's all that makes it okay in the main character's mind.<br />4. The writing is hideous.  The emails were the best written parts of the book.
030758836X|4.0|This is my first Gillian Flynn book. The book easily held my interest and I liked the style in that each chapter came from one of the main characters. That was very original to me. The sublot and other characters in the book were realistic, and added humor. This would have been 1 of the most fascinating books of the year EXCEPT the ending. Wow. For an author who spent so much time on both the husband and wife, the ending makes NO SENSE. It was like she just had to end the book due to timing or simply had no end in her thought process. Again, it is worth reading, holds your interest but this had one of the worst endings I have ever read and did not match the quality of the rest of the book.

0142420891|4.0|\\"Quitting's not hard. Deciding to quit is hard. Once you make that mental leap, the rest is easy.\\"<br /><br />Three years have passed since the tragedy in If I Stay. Adam and Mia are no longer together. Adam is a rock star; Mia a rising star on the classical music scene. On a particular Friday the 13th, after a rough interview, Adam happens to see one of Mia's performances. That leads to them reuniting. But can anything repair a broken heart?<br /><br />If I had to say my favorite thing about this novel, it would be the depth and complexities of emotion. Because this book is very different from many novels: it isn't about the wonderful giddiness that comes with falling in love. It is about rediscovering love, about breaking up, about moving on, about closure.<br /><br />Adam is our protagonist this time around, which threw me for a loop (I had read about it when I first saw reviews for this, but then, as I am apt to do, promptly forgot). So instead of seeing Mia and her feelings in the aftermath of last book, we get to see how the breakup affects the OTHER person (a good move, as I felt that Mia's feelings were perfectly explored last book). Which, in Adam's case, isn't well. He curls into a ball at his parents' place for three months. He holds people at a distance, tries to bury the incident, and takes up smoking. While I don't approve of the 3 month coma he goes into (I didn't think it was appropriate for Bella in New Moon and I'm not going to be fickle and say it's okay if a guy does that), I do think that you can feel the depth of his emotion, his pain over the break up, the constant wondering \\"Why? What did I do?\\"<br /><br />The other major character is, of course, Mia. As you look at her through Adam's eyes, she starts out as an enigma. Does she truly hate him, as Adam suspects, or are your Reader Senses tingling? I won't delve too much into what it turns out she feels, as that would spoil the novel, but what I will say is: Adam learns that his assumptions aren't 100% true. And I really liked that. I really liked that Mia turned out to be different than the conclusions Adam jumped to.  Because it is all too easy for an author to have her characters immediately make the correct assumption--which, I think everyone knows how rare THAT happens in real life.<br /><br />When the big conversation finally appears, I was very impressed at the maturity, the intensity, and the complexity.  This isn't some silly Big Misunderstanding where the girl thinks the guy doesn't love her and the guy thinks the girl is a slut.  This is a misunderstanding on a far more realistic and personal level.  These are two adults that have been to hell and back.  These are two people still coping with a tragedy--each one affected differently.  It is two people that have been hurt by the other, albeit unintentionally.  It is two people trying to figure out how to associate with the other after years of being apart--physically, emotionally, psychologically.  It is beautiful and heart-rending at the same time.<br /><br />Last time, I got a little nitpicky about the Oregon setting and how vague it seemed. Well, I thought Forman made New York come to life. I could almost see the glittering lights, the tall skyscrapers, smell the oceans and the dingy subway cars. It was amazing.<br /><br />My only real complaint is: I didn't like how Adam became basically comatose for 3 months in the aftermath of his breakup with Mia.  I know it seems petty, but it just bugged me, and since I critiqued Bella in \\"New Moon\\" pretty harshly for doing the exact same thing, I just wouldn't feel good if I gave this a pass.  Even though, in this book's defense, Adam's retreat was much better written.  His friends resent his retreat.  His parents are disappointed in him.  He gets out of his funk without having to resort to trying to commit suicide.  Adam is coping with the loss of a girlfriend and a monumental tragedy--and guilt over a vow he made.  And, let's face it, Forman is a farsuperior writer to Stephenie Meyer and can pull it off better.<br /><br />I tore through this book is a little over a day (please, give the girl a medal!! :) ).  Hell, the book made it almost impossible for me to sleep, even when I finished it!  I couldn't get the themes and elements out of my head. Forman is truly a master writer. She wields words in a beautiful way, creates deep, intense emotions that promise to rock your world. I really enjoyed this book, probably the same as \\"If I Stay\\", and am eagerly anticipating her next novel.<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br />*C.S.

B005LAIGF0|4.0|Really don't understand how in the world Anna Paquin was not one of the Oscars contenders for this movie.<br /><br />This movie should be cut in half. It's over 2h 30 minutes and there is no reason for this. The long shots over New York sometimes taking over 30 seconds are boring. The DVD has the extended version (...over 3 hr). I haven't seen it yet but I wonder how much longer the shots of New York could be.<br /><br />Anna Paquin is outstanding. Her acting in this movie is something I have only seen from Meryl Streep. She has a great future in the acting business. Again, I really don't understand why she was not nominated for an Oscar (...maybe because she is not part of the establishment and the Hollywood in-crowd).<br /><br />Now to the movie. A bus driver is distracted by a totally irresponsible adolescent and kills a woman who was waiting at a pedestrian cross over. This is a tragic accident very well portrayed in the movie (...blood all over the place with amputation). It is quite obvious that she (Anna Paquin) feels guilty because SHE is responsible for the accident. She never tells anybody the real story about the stupid hat that resulted in someones tragic death. She then takes it on the driver and soon she makes herself believe that it was the driver's fault.<br /><br />Very well done movie and the subplot with her divorced parents it is very credible and very interesting. In most recent movies we are getting the message that most modern couples are irresponsible. They get together, have kids and then everybody wants to live like they were single again. In the mean time the daughter is looking for attention to boys in school who are on drugs and selfish.

1400069289|5.0|Well written and full of fun and interesting anecdotes and analysis, I highly recommend this book! Much of it ties into my vocational interests, especially as a Marketing Professor (with classic and current consumer behavior examples throughout). This one is on many \\"Summer Reads for 2012\\" lists and belongs there! (I included this snippet in my LinkedIn reading list, as well.)

0345803485|3.0|A fairly good romance that happens to involves some fairly mild BDSM. It's not amazing, or groundbreaking, or terrible, or any of the other melodramatic labels that abound in the reviews. Yes, it is informally written in a first person, present tense, stream-of-consciousness format. I don't think this makes the writing \\"terrible\\", but neither can it be a literary work of art.<br /><br />I have to laugh at the person who recommended Ann Rice's \\"sleeping beauty\\" trilogy to readers who wanted better BDMS-themed erotica. Really? Rice's books are filled with truly non-consensual sex (true slavery and rape), unsafe bondage and punishments that would kill or permanently damage a real person, no safe words, no plot, no consideration given to safe sex or birth control, and completely ridiculous and unbelievable characters.
B00000AOUD|4.0|Nestled comfortably in the gleaming memories of my childhood is seeing this album proudly displayed in the window of a campus record store, as if announcing that a new day had just dawned in the annals of rock-and-roll history...  You see, back in 1972 it still wasn't that common for an album to embody such an extended musical work---bands like Pink Floyd and Yes had only just begun to reach for more dizzying heights of inner self-exploration (some might say boring forays into self-indulgence). At the time, the legendary &#34;In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida&#34; was still widely regarded as the swaggering leviathan of hard rock.  So it was somewhat of a surprise that one Jethro Tull, a group that was still generally recognized as more of a blues/folk outfit, came forward with an honest-to-goodness concept album, a brilliant piece of music which expanded the boundaries of rock and roll and laid to rest any concerns regarding their place in musical history. This particular CD version contains the entire original album and a previously unreleased live version of TAAB (which is a mini-masterpiece all by itself). Also included is a comprehensive interview which delves deeply into the minds of the band as they relate the things they can (or can't) remember about the creation of this fantastic album. The production and sound quality is excellent throughout and the performances are stellar. Enjoy.  **** 1/2 starsterpiece all by itself). Also included is a comprehensive interview which delves deeply into the minds of the band as they relate the things they can (or can't) remember about the recording process.

0345803485|4.0|When I heard this trilogy was the latest rage, I came here and checked out some of the reviews and read the short synposis. It did not sound like something I would find enjoyable and skipped it. Last week, my sister told me I had to read them and asked me to so.  I still didn't feel real inclined to, but my sister is not much of a reader, and she was reading them.  Apparently, so were all her friends.  So, okay, I downloaded book one and began.<br /><br />I must agree with many of the reviewers who wondered if a teenager had written this.  Since I read the Twilight series, and did not care for the first person narrative, or the choppy writing quality, and my thought that the series read like a Dick and Jane book, I thought, when I began 50 Shades, here we go again...<br /><br />I kept reading, wanting to know what the hype was, and found myself completely engrossed and, I must confess, intrigued. I have had a book going steadily for the last 25 years, and I have never read anything like this.  So I must commend E.L. James her courage for putting her imagination to work in this series.  Many probably could not do this. Let's at least admit that it takes a certain amount of bravery to put those thoughts on paper.<br /><br />Christian Grey is a very complex individual. He is sexy, he is controlling, he is disturbing, and he is dark.  I did not like him much at all when I met him.  Less as the story continued.  As Anastasia often referred to him, after meeting him herself, he was 50 Shades of F***ed Up, and she was dead on.  There are countless sex scenes in this book, and as I was reading them, I was trying to figure out what was going on in his head to want to do these things, his need to do these things, why anyone would want to do the things he wanted to do to her. But, there is so much more going on aside from the sex that kept me reading.  I was a lot more intrigued with that part of the story and as I got further into the book, I began to change my mind about Christian.<br /><br />There is much more going on here than just sex and while the sex is excessive, and his insistence to do things his way is continuously disturbing, it was actually a pretty interesting story.  I was hooked halfway through with just wanting to know what was going to happen to him, if he was going to be able to overcome his many, many issues.  When I got to the end, it seemed his issues were only beginning.
0345803485|1.0|I decided to read this due to all of the notoriety it has been receiving.  I ask, \\"Why?\\"  It explores a sadistic and depraved man who deflowers a naive and insecure young girl.  What angered me is that she was stupid enough to allow it.  Did she have that little self respect?  The premise was stupid, and by the end of the fifth chapter, (I quit reading it after that) came to the conclusion that they deserved each other.

B000NQRR1Q|4.0|Some films are about plot, some about characters, and some about the form, the journey you take.  This is definitely the latter.  Oh, the plot keeps us going, and the characters are all interesting though they never really move forward.  But the craft is there, and it makes this movie worth watching at least once.<br /><br />Depp is fine as the main character, an amoral \\"book detective\\".  Frank Langella is wonderful as the millionaire book collector who sets him on his journey.  And Emmanuelle Seigner is wonderful as \\"the girl\\" - the unnamed companion/protector who provides most of the movie's occult mystery.<br /><br />And plenty of mystery there is! I'll give a spoiler here: the ending is ambiguous.  A mystery is set up and you really never truly find out the solution.  However, it's so much fun getting to the unsatisfying ending that you may, as I was, feel rewarded by the journey.<br /><br />And herein lies my warning: please don't go into this thinking that it will be a horror-noir with a satisfying ending like Angel Heart or Lord of Illusions. This film is arguably more accomplished than either of those in terms of sheer craft.  However, it is slower, more deliberate, and WILL NOT ANSWER THE MYSTERY in an overt way as those films did.  But in a very good way it leaves you thinking about the non-answers and asking questions, which, for me at least, was a rewarding experience.<br /><br />There are flaws: the ambiguity is frustrating at the end. There is no way you can solve what happened given the clues in the actual movie itself (there are a few more clues in the original novel, but that shouldn't count, especially given the divergence of plot).  There are two mostly-boring car-chase scenes. Sometimes characters are a touch stilted, which wouldn't normally be a problem except that Depp is extremely naturalistic here, and the styles clash somewhat.<br /><br />But, quibbles aside, I'd recommend this film highly.  Not perfect, and not completely satisfying (nor meant to be!) but well worth the journey, even if you never really get to the end.

B000KX0IOA|5.0|Having just watched the film Gandhi, and this was the 3rd time, I'm deeply effected by its striking relevance and timelessness. It has significance to our own history--excluding our attempts to just annihilate Native Americans. And right now in 2012 we're living through the consequences of the Arab Spring: the birth of several new societies struggling to emerge out of dictatorships, achieve equality for their diverse populations, and establish democratic governments. Right now we're horrified by the huge numbers of innocent men, women, and children that are being murdered by the regime of Syria.<br /><br />  This film, Gandhi, is not only relevant, it is addictive. Each time I watch it I never want it to end. It won 8 (I believe) Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Lead Actor, Best Director, Best Costumes, and more. It was filmed on location. Ravi Shankar, the world's most famous sitar player (whom I had the honor to hear in concert and meet) contributed to the score. This film makes the viewer want to know more about Gandhi, more about India, and more about history. I'm a Jewel in the Crown fan, and watching Gandhi is essential for filling in the historical context from the Indian point of view. The Featurettes, especially the stupendous filming of the funeral on an actual anniversary of Gandhi's real funeral, is gripping to watch. Ben Kingsley brought Gandhi back to life not only for people around the world meeting the brilliant leader for the 1st time, but as you'll see if you watch the Featurettes, for generations of Indians as well. It's utterly amazing how the film was created. Learning that story explains why the film is so superbly accurate.<br /><br />  Just as amazing is how much the main characters actually look like the real men from history. I know these actors from other films but was stunned to see their resemblance to the historical figures. I believe this film should be mandatory in all high school history curricula. And it should be in everyone's film library.
0525425764|2.0|I'm really disappointed in John Grisham's latest series.  To me they bear no relationship to his previous work.  I would say these books are more teenage fiction.
B003UESJH4|5.0|I've wanted to see this film since it was released in theaters, and I finally own it. It was worth the wait! The King's Speech is superbly directed with edge-of-your-seat emotional suspense and expert acting by Colin Firth (his best, most dynamic and absorbing performance to date), Helen Bonham-Carter, and Jeffrey Rush. This is an engaging, entertaining, heart-wrenching, and rewarding film to watch. Except for a few--actually extremely funny--short scenes of expletives, this film is suitable for ages 15 to adult. I'm a Christian and had to just laugh at those scenes. You have to see them in context! This is a film I will watch over and over. What a marvelous story--and it's history!

B00005LC1H|5.0|In my opinion, this is the funniest TV series ever produced. There were only 12 episodes, separated by 4 years; the first series was in 1975, the second in 1979, by which time John Cleese and Connie Booth, who wrote it, were divorced. There were no more episodes, but what we're left with sets the standard for TV comedy.<br /><br />Each episode is crammed full of funny lines and equally funny physical comedy. There's so much going on it's impossible to take it all in at one viewing. I've been watching it for 37 years now and it's still as funny as when I first saw it. Cleese, as Basil Fawlty the social-climbing hotel keeper, uses his unique physical attributes and his manic delivery to the utmost. Prunella Scales, as his acid-tongued wife, is a magnificent foil and Andrew Sachs as Manuel the trainee waiter (\\"He's from Barcelona\\" is the excuse for everything he does wrong) is one of the great comic creations in all of TV.<br /><br />If by any chance you haven't seen Fawlty Towers, (or Farty Towels or Watery Fowls- even the credits are hilarious) just sit back and watch and prepare to fall about laughing. If you don't find it funny, well, I'll send Basil round to insert a garden gnome in you.

0670022411|4.0|I really enjoyed both this and the 2nd book in the series, and can't wait until the 3rd comes out.  It's a novel take on vampires witches and daemons, with a lot of history mixed in (particularly in book 2).  I too am a little reluctant to try first time authors but was pleased with the both the story and the writing style which was well paced and descriptive without being ponderous.  The major characters are likable and relatable, and I find myself drawn into the storyline, wondering what comes now.<br /><br />Ignore the negative reviews.  If you enjoy reading, this is a perfect book for the pool or beach.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it!! Keeps me entertained for hours and the games are great! I love when they're half the coins too
0439023513|5.0|I have read all three books in The Hunger Games series and I must say that this last one was so much more intense than the last two but just as amazing. I could not put this book down. Warning for anyone out there who is squeamish or parents with teens, this book is not meant for anyone under 15 or 16. This book makes the first two look child like in comparison to the graphic details of death and despair.<br /><br />That being said and without giving anything away Katniss Everdeen shows just how strong willed a person can really be in the face of tribulations. I like that Collins shows a different side to the black and white picture painted by the first two books. Where you have the bad and insensitive people of the Capitol and the poor good people of the districts. Mockingjay shows the gray areas entrenched in all of us including Katniss who begins to question just how much damage she may have caused and figures out that not everyone is as good or as bad as they portray themselves to be. It shows the atrocity that is war and how even the minority or rebels all have agendas. That no matter what side people choose, where there is war and violence, innocent lives are always taken and their is enough blame to pass around to everyone.<br /><br />This book portrays how humans can be extremely vile and cruel and tear each other to shreds no matter who gets in their way or how young or innocent they are. But when all seems lost Katniss shows what keeps humanity hopeful and alive...the will to survive and that love always plays its part.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book and have recommended the entire series to all of my friends and anyone else willing to listen. Mockingjay keeps you in suspense of whats going to happen next after the truth comes out. It comes through on the action while setting the mind into motion of how this dystopia set in the future connects so quickly and truly to the world we live in today.

B00338QENI|4.0|I learned of this book from a physician that asked me to ensure our  pre-med student volunteers read it prior to their first  day at our medical center.  He donated 30 books to my student program; a sure indication that this was an important pre-requisite.  If you read the book,  you will understand why the request.  The book threads an interesting story with intriguing ethical impacts on modern medicine.  As a long time researcher at a large academic medical center that was mentioned in the book, I  recommend the book to my fellow patients and families  that seek care. Awareness is power and this book, although not deep in detail, will give you a sense of your patient rights.  And to my fellow colleagues, I recommend the book to remind us about our daily mission to protect our patients and families at all cost. How did the students enjoy it? Most read it in 2 days!

B008KNUKVI|5.0|The things these guys can do with their voices/mouths are unbelievable!!! You are hearing only five, yes FIVE voices; however, their sound is so full and complete, and their arrangements are so perfectly creative that you might as well be hearing a whole band that also uses electronic elements. They have the best bass and beatboxer that I've ever heard.  The trio of vocalists have amazing, dynamic and versatile voices with incredible ranges.  Their harmonies blend so perfectly, they're seamless.  The 2 original songs alone are worth it.  Plus, the song \\"Aha!\\" to me is an acapella master class. As others have said, listen to this with good headphones or earbuds because the intricacies of the arrangements should not to be missed. Buy it and marvel at their talent!!!

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book had me completely compelled to keep reading. All though I am very busy I took time away from my life to subdue myself in this book, And the other two. It was brilliant and I could not stop reading. The development of the characters was life threatening like it was my own life. Katniss and Peeta became a product of their environment. They did every thing in their power not to do this, but it took control. I read the last page and the epilogue while dreading the fact that it was over. Very original, Very graphic. One of the best reads I have ever had the chance to embrace. Thank you. My day has been ruined because I cannot read more.
0812548094|5.0|As much as I loved the Legend of the Seeker TV series (I mean it is what got me into the franchise), they diverted so much away from the books themselves. This book though has so much that happens during the course of it. I feel it has more action than the first one and we learn so much more back story that will make the firs books revelations seem trivial.<br /><br />The story is really one of those great classics. I actually found myself seeing parts of this book that Harry Potter might have taken inspiration from, which is a pretty big thing. The characters, setting, plot are all interwoven together wonderfully and you actually care about what happens. This is defiantly a book that earns its \\"New York Times Bestseller\\" recommendation.<br /><br />The pacing is amazing in this novel. I found myself just blasting through time wanting to know what happens next. Wither it was the action taking place, the suspense or even just the traveling; the book pulls you right in and doesn't let you go. Writing is top notch and I only noticed some minor printing errors in the book itself.<br /><br />Verdict:<br /><br />I say pick this novel up if you liked the first. It continues the great story and throws a bunch of curve balls at you along the way. If you are interested in this series at all, I highly recommend reading these books. Just from the first and second I am sucked into this saga and I can't wait to continue reading more about the adventures of Richard Cypher.<br /><br />Positive:<br />* As violent as the first one<br />* Learn a lot about the main characters in this novel<br />* Story you care about<br />* Amazing pacing even with almost a thousand pages<br />* Great writing<br /><br />Negative:<br />* Definitely not a kids book

B006OV7RQ4|3.0|This is a peculiar film indeed--that doesn't mean it's bad. It just means it's quite different from most films you might see. Most unusual is the fact that we get no \\"backstory\\" for the main story. The film opens with Martha/Marcy May/Marlene (Elizabeth Olsen in a tortured yet incredibly nuanced performance) escaping a cult in upstate New York to reunite with her estranged sister and her sister's husband. Flashbacks fill us in on what happened to Martha/Marcy May/Marlene while she was a cult member, yet we never learn how or why she became a member of the cult or why she stayed as long as she did.<br /><br />The present action--Martha/Marcy May/Marlene's awkward attempts to reconnect with her family despite what her brother-in-law characterizes as her \\"insane\\" behavior--focuses mainly on what can only be described as the post-traumatic stress that Martha/Marcy May/Marlene is incapable of dealing with. Her time in the cult has rendered her inert and paranoid, and the film ends as abruptly as it began, with a bizarre traffic incident, the meaning of which seems to fade into oblivion along with Martha/Marcy May/Marlene's future.<br /><br />Fans of quirky, introspective, and artsy films will have a lot to chew on after watching this one. If it's action or conventional storytelling you want, best look elsewhere.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|Buried in this mass of BS is a compelling story. Wading through the nonsense destroys the experience. By the time the character reappears you have forgotten who did what to whom. I found myself flipping through all descriptions of sigils of the various houses and the phony folk songs. I wish he would leave that nonsense out and focus on the tale he trying to tell. He really needs a good editor.
1416550550|5.0|I am an avid reader, always have been.  One of the things about Kate Morton's books is her characters are so dimensional that I can easily imagine them and become part of their story.  Her descriptions are so vivid I can easily move through her books as if watching a movie.  For me this book was such a great story and I didn't want to put it down because I wanted to know how it ended - yet I was sad when it did end because it was such a good book!!

The seasoned cast seems to be having fun with the movie as well and offers the viewer some interesting situations with predictable results.<br /><br />This one was good once but we will probably not watch it again. The ending of the movie is rather contrived and designed to leave the audience laughing, I didn't. The sound and video were both very good.

B0007RO57U|5.0|This is one of those rare opportunities to acquire great music played wonderfully. Not only is this a fantastic collection of music and performance, it is a terrific bargain as well. Put together, it adds up to a must have for the serious collector, music lover or novice who is just beginning their journey into classical music. This is a two disc set that covers about half of Handel's keyboard suites. There is a companion 2 disc set that belongs in the same lofty company as this one. Both offerings are at a price that would be an economy buy even if they each had only a single disc instead of two. In other words, don't miss either and grab the whole 4 disc collection!<br /><br />Handel's Keyboard Suites are a kind of summa of his art similar to Bach's Klavierbung. You could look on this music as an analog to the two volumes of The Well Tempered Clavier. It is a consensus that Bach's WTC is the pinnacle of his era's solo keyboard art and you won't find many (if any) who would place Handel's Suites in the same lofty catagory. Be that as it may, we shouldn't dismiss these out of hand as second rate or superfluous to those who only want \\"the best\\". Closer inspection will reveal that the WTC and Handel's Suites are conceived differently and each is a musical survey with widely differing identities. I won't go into a lengthly discussion of the differences and the large difference should be evident anyway. I would look on both as the height of art of two major maestros in music history. That should be enough to entice the student or inspire the curiousity of the seasoned music lover.<br /><br />Set up as Suites, each of the 8 on the disc are comprised of a grouping of several individual movements. Each movement is a different tempo, either determined by designation or labelled as a Baroque period dance. The number of movements in each suite varies from 4 to 6. Some are mixtures of tempo designations and dances. For example, Suite #1 in A Major has 4 movements, I. Prelude, II. Allemande, III. Courante, IV. Gigue; while Suite #2 in F Major is comprised of 3 different tempi designations Adagio, Allegro, Adagio and ends with a 4th movement Fuga marked Allegro. Handel is altogether freer in his approach than his contempary Bach, sometimes varying the number of voices within one fugue or mixing his dances in a non standard setup. His mood seems more varied too, sometimes featuring an exuberance that I think is a main attribute of Handel's universal appeal.<br /><br />The performances on these discs are unusual in that 2 different pianists are featured in a single project. The pairing has Andrei Gavrilov and Sviatoslav Richter on the recording, each player well suited to this material. Gavrilov has great technical skill and his enthusiasm is well matched with Handel's.

Allemande, III. Courante, IV. Gigue; while Suite #2 in F Major is comprised of 3 different tempi designations Adagio, Allegro, Adagio and ends with a 4th movement Fuga marked Allegro. Handel is altogether freer in his approach than his contempary Bach, sometimes varying the number of voices within one fugue or mixing his dances in a non standard setup. His mood seems more varied too, sometimes featuring an exuberance that I think is a main attribute of Handel's universal appeal.<br /><br />The performances on these discs are unusual in that 2 different pianists are featured in a single project.

B005CRQ4XI|5.0|An amazing true story, so well written it reads like a novel. I loved it so much I will read it again anytime I want to go an armchair adventure. Loved It.
B0088RQ4X4|4.0|So, I went into this with the expectations of a typical Disney movie. I expected little character development, glossy CGI, and a perfect story where nothing goes wrong. And let me tell you, I was absolutely wrong about John Carter.<br /><br />The story begins with a battle sequence that reminded me very much of Star Wars VI, which took place on Mars (John Carter, not Star Wars, haha). It soon cuts to the late 1800s in Pennsylvania, where John Carter lives. Carter's nephew begins reading his notes, and that's when the story picks up, and soon enough he's on Mars.<br /><br />Regardless of how similar the ships were to that of Star Wars, and the alien life form were constantly reminding me of the Na'Vi tribe in Avatar, the narrative was quite original. Well, as original as an alien epic can be! Essentially, there are two races of people, who've been waging war for a very long time, and another species (I don't know the name) which are the ones I'm referring to directly above.<br /><br />Also, another thing I want to touch on is the fact that it is a Disney movie. Let me tell you, if you didn't know it was Disney, you would not have figured it out. The movie had plenty of action, death, and yeah, gore. There was also some profanity thrown in here and there. So if the fact that it's Disney is the reason you don't want to see it, then forget that and watch this movie.<br /><br />Lastly, I'm going to touch on the pros and cons of the movie.<br /><br />Pros: CGI was excellent (If I remember, the budget was like 250million). The story line was original. The plans weren't perfect, not everything went as planned. (Something you don't see that often in a lot of movies nowadays.) And, there was death! Obviously they weren't super gory with it, but they made sure you knew someone was dying. (For example, in one part you see someone about to get ripped in half, it cuts to a camera angle where you can see the shadows, where you his them get killed.)<br /><br />Cons: The narrative got a little muffled occasionally. The acting wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing. And it never touches on the fact that they speak English. Maybe I missed something, but that seems to be a plot hole.<br /><br />Overall, 7.5/10.
B002L4QP0M|2.0|This was the first book I've read by Jeffrey Archer and I don't know if I will read another - I at least won't PAY to read another in any case. While the story was interesting enough for me to want to finish it to see exactly how it ended, I was often frustrated while reading it and came away feeling that it was unnecessarily long. There were several sections that felt to me that they did not contribute much to the story or were lengthened considerably for no real reason at all except if the author were being paid by the page. I also felt Archer tried to make the story super-complicated, almost as if taunting the reader to try to keep up with him. The only real praise I can give this work is that he enticed me to want to finish it, rather than reaching the 50 page threshold and deciding to not waste my time.
0385344228|4.0|Excellent book although I had higher expectations.. I thought it dragged out a little bit and the writing wasn't all that great in some places. But other than that, I would definitely recommend it. Very quick read because you wanted to find out what was going on! Did NOT like the ending....it felt like the author was just like \\"ok, I'm done writing this, lets just end it\\". The ending was an unexpected twist but I felt like it was rushed.
B008KNUKVI|5.0|I first saw this group on \\"The Sing Off\\" and was blown away that five people could produce such a fantastic sound. The rhythm and bass, the tight vocals, the arrangements--the entire package is unbelievable. I agree with another reviewer that the only problem is that once you listen to their music you want to play it over and over and you can't get it out of your head! No doubt this group is destined for great things.

B0053O8AQE|1.0|Look, I was really hoping this show would be good. I've been a fan of Kat Dennings for a while now, but as of yet she hasn't really had any projects worthy of her talents, and I was really hoping that this would finally be the one.<br /><br />Boy, was this a disappointment.<br /><br />2 Broke Girls is yet another mindless sitcom from CBS, the 'proud' presenters of other trash such as Two and a Half Men and The Big Bang Theory. This, unfortunately, was made in the same mindset as those: take a bunch of talented young actors, give them the most generic comedy personalities available (Girl #1 is sassy, streetsmart, and won't take any crap; Girl #2 is a formerly-rich airheaded blonde who doesn't understand working life), write plots that require absolutely none of your attention (this time they're gonna be maids!), fill the scripts with the most obvious punchlines imaginable, then hire a crowd of people to laugh as if it's the funniest thing they ever did see. With a couple seconds of channel flipping, you could find the exact same jokes and scenarios, only done much better, and usually done over ten years ago.<br /><br />The cast really does try to make the proceedings worthwile, but the fact of the matter is, this is comedy white noise. It's simple, inoffensive (topically, not intellectually), and the kind of show you can watch while working. This is a show where if you miss ten minutes from the middle, it will take less than 20 seconds to get caught up. And really, I understand the need for shows like this. Sometimes after a long day of work, you just want to turn your brain off and laugh. But there are better shows for that, and just because you don't want to use your brain doesn't meen you need to have it insulted.<br /><br />Please, watch something other than this. There are so many brilliant, yet overlooked comedies on tv right now (Louie, Key & Peele, Comedy Bang Bang, etc) that there's really no excuse for wasting your time on this drivel. Do yourself a favor and watch something else. Even the most recent episodes of How I Met Your Mother are better than this.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|I came very close to not buying this DVD, based on the bad reviews, but I am SO glad I did!  The negative comments from others led me to expect a horrible abomination from the theatrical cut, but it actually wasn't as bad as I feared.  Different, yes, but not bad.  Yes, the sound effects are different (for a reason), yes the song tracks are different (for a reason), yes, some of the visual effects are different (for a reason).  (The reasons are all fully explained in the commentary of this edition.)  What you have to understand is that the director, Richard Kelly, considers this a \\"remix\\" version of the film, not a \\"replacement\\" version.  He's not pulling a George Lucas and trying to usurp previous versions with this one instead; he was given the chance to make an additional version, so he did.<br /><br />What is awesome about this edition, however, is not the changes from the theatrical version, but Kelly's commentary track with Kevin Smith, because it finally makes everything so perfectly clear!  When I first saw the original film on the theatrical DVD release, I kind of understood it, but not completely.  Then I watched the deleted scenes and the extras (the Philosophy of Time Travel excerpts) on the original DVD and I got a much better understanding of the film.<br /><br />With the director's cut, the deleted scenes and the POTT excerpts have now been added into the film, so if you've never seen the theatrical release you might find this one easier to understand.  Completists should be aware that some of the deleted scenes that have been restored to this version are NOT available in the deleted scenes on the theatrical release DVD - they are making their first appearance here.<br /><br />But it's when you listen to the director's cut commentary that we finally get the full explanation of what Kelly meant to convey.  I won't spoil anything here, but even if you think you sort-of understand what the \\"manipulated living\\" and the \\"manipulated dead\\" and the \\"receiver,\\" etc all mean (from the POTT excerpts), it's never really made completely clear until this commentary with Kevin Smith -- even Kevin Smith admits there are things he didn't understand until this meeting with Kelly, like what the other characters were (subconsciously) doing throughout the story to influence Donnie.  And there is one relationship between two characters that I don't think anyone but Kelly got until now.<br /><br />Now, this might mean that Kelly is just really bad at getting his point across on a dramatic, script level - otherwise why would it have taken this many tries to get the true plot structure clear to the audience?  Unless he meant this film to be the \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" for its generation: deliberate vagueness to leave it open for individual interpretation.<br /><br />And for those wanting to know why Kevin Smith was chosen to assist in the commentary, it's because Kelly was attempting to make the movie more like a comic-book film (despite his own admission of not being knowledgeable about comic books) and asked Kevin Smith along to talk about whether or not he succeeded.<br /><br />Bottom line, which version do I prefer?  Well, the theatrical version, but mostly because I prefer its song selections to the director's cut song selections (song choices and song placements, which both changed).  But to truly understand this film, you need to be familiar with the deleted scenes, the extras, AND the director's cut commentary - all of which are in this edition.

I'm now halfway through the 2nd book and I'm hoping there will be more. The author is obviously very educated in the field of alchemy and its a very entertaining read. You can't help but try to figure out what's coming next, and you will be constantly surprised at how the story takes shape. I loved this book and am eagerly anticipating future work from Deborah Harkness.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Lots of S&M, a little romance and tons of childishly poor writing.  It feels like it's written from the perspective of a 16 year old.  What I can say about this book is it was brilliantly marketed.  Why is it such a HOT seller?  Because it was FREE for a really long time.  Now that it's paid, it still tops the bestseller list because of the number of copies GIVEN AWAY FOR FREE- not sold!  It is a wonderful idea for the novice writer, give your book away until it's a best-\\"seller\\" then start charging.

B00782O7IY|5.0|When I first heard about this movie i was a lil nervous knowing that there would be no dialogue. A 99% silent film, black and white with subtitles !!!!!! The idea seemed strange and stupid to me because so many people like me hate to read while watching movies. BUT after the first 15 minutes watching you forget the film is silent. It takes place round the late 1920's to early 30\\"s and because the film is done in silence and black and white you feel like your really watching a movie from that time period. Using unfamiliar actors for the star roles made this much easier, although John Goodman is in it. I gave this film 5 stars because it was a great film !!! It was different in every way from how movies are made today with poor dialogue relying more on visual effects to make the film entertaining. Instead this film has no dialogue and no visual effects, and your still entertained. The actors did a great job making you feel what they were feeling through expression and body language. The film really does pull you back in time with the way it was shot, and If your willing to accept the fact that its a silent film before you start watching it then i know you will enjoy it as much as i did.
0374275637|2.0|Behavioralism is the hottest and most groundbreaking science of our day. While I respect the author as a scientist; I wish I could say the same for his writing skills. A better read is Social Intelligence: The New Science of Human Relationship by Daniel Goleman.<br /><br />Level I by Kahneman is \\"reptilian\\" by Goleman. Level II by Kahneman is \\"frontal lobe\\" by Goleman.<br /><br />Goleman's work was obviously influenced by Kahneman. But if the goal is to inform and give the reader an enjoyable way to pass time; well ... sometimes it is better to read of a science - not by a scientist - but a gifted writer/reporter/scientist.<br /><br />That is the equivelant of trying to read a book about comic inflation from Alan Guth as opposed to one by Brian Greene.

B00364K6YW|3.0|It has been said that this is THE Pride and Prejudice...the best of the lot, but I disagree.  In spite of the fact that Colin Firth plays Mr. Darcy, the movie, while beautiful, lacks a certain spark.  Some of the scenes seem quite drawn out and there is no passion to be felt.  I much prefer Pride and Prejudice with Keira Knightley where emotion, tension and passion leap from the screen and one cannot help but be drawn into the story itself.  Darcy is excellent, as is the entire cast.  Truly a much better version in every way.  And for fun be sure not to miss Lost in Austen where someone from our time travels to Ms. Bennet's time.  It's wonderful and so much fun.  As for this version...I'd skip it and go for the other two.
B00004TJKI|4.0|Let me start by saying, if you liked this movie, you will love the far superior book by Robert Traver (penname of Michigan attorney, John D. Voelker). The movie concerns a defense attorney, Paul Biegler (a perfectly cast James Stewart) who defends a client, Lieut. Manion, accused of First Degree Murder for shooting the man who allegedly raped his wife Laura (Lee Remick).<br /><br />The first half of the book deals with the attorney and his partner (Arthur O'Connell) digging up evidence that is being subverted by an innkeeper to preserve the reputation of the slain man. Most of this has been cut from the film. The second half deals with the battle between Biegler and one of the prosecutors, Claude Dancer (George C. Scott), a man who will use every dirty trick in the book to win his case. The battle of wits between Biegler and Dancer is what keeps the momentum building until the end. Unfortunately, in the movie, there are many hints of Dancer's ruthlessness but he is never allowed to blossom fully into the archvillain that helped make the novel such a bestseller.<br /><br />Exceptional performances are given by all the actors mentioned, as well as by Eve Arden as Biegler's wise-cracking secretary and Murray Hamilton as a bartender with a few secrets. Of interest is the fact that the novel was actually autobiographical fiction based upon a case that Voelker defended in 1952. Aside from the movie's adult frankness for 1959, the film is also known for its Duke Ellington score.
078322737X|4.0|American Graffiti was a labor of love for George Lucas, who was writing much of the story based on his own experiences growing up. He managed to bring together a collection of excellent actors to show what being a teenager in 1962 was like. It offers a great mix of characters. There's the heading-to-college guy who is eager to experience the world. There's the guy who's nervous about leaving home. There's the guy who WANTS to leave home but didn't get into college. It's interesting that for the guys it's about who is going or not going to college. For the girls, there seems to be no sense at all that that is an option. Their gripes are mainly that their guys are leaving them behind. There's no sense at all that they have a future beyond waiting for their guys.<br /><br />The movie interweaves a number of character's stories over their one last night before some of the guys are slated to head off to college. They merge and diverge as they pass each other on the cruising strip, listen to great rock music, and have relationships form and break up. For those who say cruising died after 1962, I'll point out that there were still places people went cruising even in the 80s and 90s, so it didn't die out completely.<br /><br />Yes, some of the behavior might seem immature, but that's the point. These are kids on the verge of adulthood. They sometimes say silly things, or get confused. As a teen watching the movie everything makes perfect sense, and as an adult watching it one sees where the logic wasn't quite all there. The changes in perspective make this a fascinating film to re-watch every few years and see how one's point of view about it changes.<br /><br />The movie gets great kudos for having a wealth of strong female characters - something that many films do not offer. But, even so, it is amazing that throughout the entire movie the women never talk with each other. They are only there to be talked to by guys. The one time two women talk to each other in a bathroom, they are solely focused on the men in their life and how hard it is to have them leave. That's it.<br /><br />I enjoy watching this movie as a view into a snapshot of time. Sure, people weren't perfect - they never are. But they do the best they can, finding a path through the situations life throws at them, listening to music they adore, trying to do the right thing. Making mistakes, lying, and finally admitting the truth.<br /><br />Well recommended.they are solely focused on the men in their life and how hard it is to have them leave.

After a while I clicked on it, and saw it had 5 stars and over a thousand reviews, which made me much more curious.<br /><br />It started with a great \\"short story\\" leading us into a peculiar silo and its inhabitants. The air outside will kill them, and all protecting them is a silo, going deep down underground. The story relies heavily on character development, and it really makes you feel for them. I felt what the characters felt and I even cried for them! I never cry! Like I said, it's heavy on the character building, and at times a little slow, but I think that gives a better feel of the life in the silo as an outcome. The story really unfolds when we meet Juliette, the star of the book.<br /><br />This is a book you need time to sink into. But once you do it's great. Great price, great story!<br /><br />Read it :)

B00828HWJE|4.0|Dragon Eyes(released April/12)stars Cung Le as Hong(Pandorum),Jean Claude Van Damme as Tiano,and Peter Weller as Mr.V.The film was directed by John Hyams,and considering his extremely disappointing work in Universal Soldier:Regeneration,I was more than a little concerned about this effort.However I`m pleased to say that this film meets and exceeds my expectations.Hyams uses a light but stylized touch throughout the film,including an off coloured,sepia like toned lighting to emphasize the mood and look.<br />The plot involves Van Damme who is a lifer in jail for the accidental murder of his own son.He lived in an area called St Judes,which is run and controlled by Weller,a drug lord.He in turn has an Hispanic group running his east side and a black gang running the south side.To keep them both in check he,from time to time,will bring in the local Russian gang called the Devil Dogs.Weller also controls the cops,so he can have anyone locked down that he wants on a whim.<br />In the middle of St Judes is an apartment complex owned and run by a grandfather and his daughter.One day Le comes a calling,looking for a room to rent.Le has met Van Damme in prison,as he was sent up for the murder of a young lady he did not commit.In Le,Van Damme sees the Dragon Eyes,one good,one bad and both in conflict.Van Damme fine tunes Le`s innate abilities in martial arts and asks him,upon his release,to go back to his old neighbourhood of St Judes,and clean it up.Something Van Damme was originally trying to do when he was jailed.<br />Le does indeed go back and at first locks heads with the local gangs.Little by little he works his way into their good graces,and ultimately,Weller`s.Le`s plan is to play all sides against each other and it indeed works for the short term.In the long term however,Weller finally gets wise to his plans until the final showdown comes,in which the wrongs are finally righted.<br />It was an immense pleasure to see Peter Weller back on the screen and he plays his character to menacing perfection.Van Damme also does a good job with his limited role,virtually playing himself,as he teaches Le the finer points of martial arts.Le is also a credible performer here,and his strengths lay in the fight scenes.Watch for Van Dammes son as one of the two corrupt cops.<br />The story as I described it,is told in the film,in reverse order.So what we see as we are watching,is the past in flashbacks,eventually catching up to the present rolling along before us.The fight scenes were all nicely choreographed and through some judicious editing and camera tricks are given some really snazzy dynamic.<br />Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp and in a 2:35:1 widescreen aspect ratio.The only extra is a 10 minute featurette on the making of the film.<br />One minor point I would like to make before this review irises out,is directed towards Sony Pictures.Sony has NOT been,I feel,promoting their Van Damme films to their full potential.I had no idea this film had even been released until I happened upon its mention on Mr Van Dammes Facebook page,then I went a-looking.Van Damme has been turning out some of the best films of his career in the last few years and Sony should be capitalizing on it big time.Maybe his fans should be writing to Sony and creating some of that VanDammage I hear so much about.....at least,in my opinion.<br />All in all a recommended film of drugs and corruption and ultimate redemption in the barrio.Get it today.character to menacing perfection.Van Damme also does a good job with his limited role,virtually playing himself,as he teaches Le the finer points of martial arts.Le is also a credible performer here,and his strengths lay in the fight scenes.Watch for Van Dammes son as one of the two corrupt cops.<br />The story as I described it,is told in the film,in reverse order.So what we see as we are watching,is the past in flashbacks,eventually catching up to the present rolling along before us.The fight scenes were all nicely choreographed and through some judicious editing and camera tricks are given some really snazzy dynamic.<br />Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp and in a 2:35:1 widescreen aspect ratio.The only extra is a 10 minute featurette on the making of the film.<br />One minor point I would like to make before this review irises out,is directed towards Sony Pictures.Sony has NOT been,I feel,promoting their Van Damme films to their full potential.I had no idea this film had even been released until I happened upon its mention on Mr Van Dammes Facebook page,then I went a-looking.Van Damme has been turning out some of the best films of his career in the last few years and Sony should be capitalizing on it big time.Maybe his fans should be writing to Sony and creating some of that VanDammage I hear so much about.....at least,in my opinion.<br />All in all a recommended film of drugs and corruption and ultimate redemption in the barrio.Get it today.

B002OSY2T6|5.0|I bought this for my son when he was about 4 months old. At first it was his favorite tummy-time toy since it rocks, lights up, and makes cute noises/sings cute songs - plus he could see himself in the mirrored snail-belly. Then, once he learned how to crawl, he chased it around a bit. Now at 11 months, he's still playing with it by spinning it around and watching it light up in the dark space under his crib. The only drawback is that it is very repetitious (why it's under the crib). :)
B007Z9RAX4|3.0|Good job by Gina - one of the few women since Sigourney Weaver in \\"Aliens\\" to make me believe she was really badass. This is because Gina is *really* a badass. That she has enough acting chops to make you think she isn't just appearing in an extended cameo is a compliment to her. And this is why this movie (mostly) works in its goal of being a good action thriller.    Her acting was spare, as someone else wrote, a sort of feminine Jason Statham. In other words, she knows her strengths and one of them isn't acting. She keeps the emotions spare and doesn't try to milk a scene which lets the movie flow.    Not a legendary thriller action flick, but a good one that is worth the rental for a night. Weaknesses are the rather scatter-shot collection of Big Names brought in somewhat randomly in an attempt to flesh out the very spare plot. Outside of Channing Tatum, I thought the rest of the Big Names were almost slumming their way through the film. I just didn't buy their emotional investment (Michael Douglas looked a bit faded for obvious reasons, Banderas and McGregor didn't seem committed and Fassbender didn't have enough to chew on in the script.)    But when the movie stops trying to justify itself and just gets to fighting and fury, it is at home and a fun time. This is a flick, not cine-mah.    Three-and-a-half stars.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|this game is pretty fantastic. Its graphics are detailed, and I love the games free-roam feature. I have pretty much nothing bad to say about this game. graphical work sweet on a kindle fire.
B000FVE3A2|5.0|got this a couple of month ago and this thing is absolutely huge! this is the biggest watch I ever owned. it is also my first automatic in 25 years. this watch is EXTREMELY HEAVY! you better eat your oats if you wanna wear this monster. I believe it weighs in at 200grams. most of the weight is in the case. the bracelet is thick and beautiful because it has to handle the massive weight! I don't recommend heavy activity with this watch unless you need to lose weight. the watch alone is beautiful for the money. in direct Sun it shines like platinium. the stainless steel around the hour markers shines beautifully like jewelry should. I don't like the invicta and grand diver engravings. I think this was just overkill. the bezel is a bit hard to turn but it's sturdy. my jeweler took out 5 links. the bracelet is large if your gonna put it on a wet suit. no need. the screw down crown is big and screws in easily. this beats the crap out of my old aqualand in size. I thought that watch was big! My watch came with nh25a 21 jewel. I believe these watches also have nh35a 24 jewel movement. my watch is +5 sec per day. when I wear the watch, the movement slows very slightly. at night I leave the watch face up and it gains slightly. well balanced machine. this watch cannot be wound by hand. so I twirl it for 30 seconds and I'm good to go. this watch can't hack, but it can back hack. I just got to line the hands up right. I hope that this will last years took come. a friend noticed it immediately on my wrist. well how can he not notice  it?
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The book started a little slow, but once I got into it I could not put it down. I read the entire book in 2 days. I was very skeptical of the book, that it would live up to the hype or that it would just be about the sex. Erotica is not what I normally read. It was soo much more than I could have ever expected. I did not even want to spend money on the book, so I borrowed it. The minute I finished the first, i had to have the second and ended up downloading all 3. This is a MUST READ.

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|GREAT BOOK!!!!  I have read a combination of bad and good reviews.  Some had a big problem with the \\"abusive\\" relationship and violence.  When I think back to my college days, I can remember the serious crushes girls had on the \\"bad\\" boys, the parties with binge drinking, cussing, all of what this book so accurately writes.  I don't see a problem with this because although it is a fictional book, the reality is that all these things happen.  The problem so many see with the relationship is the overprotectiveness (possessiveness).  I think both characters are to blame for this behavior, not just Travis. Abby sends mixed messages to both boys for awhile in the book.  But we can't completely blame her because she is young,  troubled by her past and lack of love from a father.  She does need to learn from mistakes and grow.  Travis is also hindered by his childhood having no one modeling what a healthy relationship should look like.  Even with their troubled pasts, they come together and with each other they begin to learn love and trust.  Some have written that Travis' character is like so many others with a dominant male figure.  Even with these dominant male figures, the women do push back.  Maybe not to the extent that you would like, but they do in their own way.<br />  This is one of my favorite books and can't wait for \\"Walking Disaster\\"!!!!

B001GS1DS8|2.0|The original version was a goofy, if not plausible action movie with a semi-romantic twist. As one would expect, the original had decent character development for a film of this genre and excellent plot pacing.<br />The unrated version is simply choppy, lacking cohesiveness in the plot and failing to engender any sympathetic or comedic connection with the characters.<br />I had expected the original version improved by a few DVD-only scenes. Wrong. This version is less not more.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|There's no need to recap what many hundreds of others have said about WOOL and its plot. This is character-based science fiction at its finest. In WOOL 1 through 5, we follow the path of Juliette on her way from mechanic to sheriff and well beyond, all set within the crucible of a post-apocalyptic underground silo. Hard SF fans may find the detail here a bit light. Personally, I appreciated that Howey didn't stall the story with Clancy-like devotion to the technical minutia of silo operation and sustenance. It's as detailed as it needs to be and no more.<br /><br />Howey is poetic without being academic or overly literary. His characters change, and not always in predictable ways. A friend of mine warned me after I'd finished WOOL 2 not to start on WOOL 3 until I had a clear spot in my schedule, because I wouldn't be able to stop. Sure enough, I finished WOOL 5 at 3:45 AM this morning. I haven't pulled a late-nighter like that for a book in decades. No exaggeration.<br /><br />I know the film rights for WOOL have been bought and a script is under way. I can only hope that the movie turns out to be at least half as good as the books. The story's claustrophobia will be challenging. There are few explosions and not many opportunities for eye-popping CGI work -- and that's a good thing. Just as WOOL defies formulaic conventions in print, perhaps the film will do the same and give us all (pardon the inside joke) a bit of fresh air.<br /><br />I'm now ordering the next WOOL book and will make my way through Howey's other titles over time. Buy the WOOL Omnibus. It will be one of the best book purchase you make this year.

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I have heartily enjoyed the reviews of the many hapless readers who found this book to be full of cliches, stereotypes, pointless filler, sickening sappiness, swooning, brooding, and unfulfilled promise. I was even more surprised that no one has made the comparison to the great-grandpapa of mind-numbing filler, Robert Jordan himself!<br /><br />Now, there was a fount of hilarious reviews: [[ASIN:B000FFJRI6 Crossroads of Twilight (The Wheel of Time, Book 10)]]. His constant repetition of mannerisms. Descriptions of clothes, hair, tea-drinking, jigsaw-puzzle strategies, cures for lazy eye, etc., etc. ad nauseaum. Constant streams of new characters and events that led nowhere. (Reviewer Rusty Shackleford's list of plot points to be resolved is a labor of love that is not to be missed. Zhakrin has a good one, too. Gary from Seattle. ali, from Cupertino. And that's just the beginning ...)<br /><br />I, for one, am encouraged by this new discovery, a new Jordan. \\"Harkness\\" (and her \\"learning on the job\\" junior editor, of course) promises to be a motherlode of side-splitting, negative reviews, doubtless many reaching the pinnacle of Spam haiku or better. For this I am both grateful and hopeful.

0156034026|4.0|The phrase that comes to mind after reading this books is, \\"Radically beautiful\\". While it inspires serious feelings of unrest and makes you question a lot of the political state of the country after 9/11, it is also simply written and flows beautifully. It's a story about something so controversial that's told in the most unique and unexpected way. Honestly I can say I've never read anything like this book.<br /><br />It's about a man named Changez, a Pakistani immigrant who goes to school at Princeton, and then takes a job in a highly celebrated valuation firm. He proceeds to live his life as an American, not an immigrant. He talks like an American, walks like one, does business like one, all while trying to retain a semblance of self. But when 9/11 happens, his entire world is thrown out of balance. He tries to retain his American identity, but how can you do that when the entire country sees you as the enemy? This conflict inspires a sort of downward spiral for Changez, who's also fallen in love with a woman he can't have for a surprising reason.<br /><br />The entire story is narrated completely through Changez sharing his story with an American tourist in a cafe in Pakistan. With such an interesting and offbeat narrative style, of course you get something so unique. But it's not just the plot/characters you see from a unique angle. You also see a man who is so in love with America and all it's done for him, who is also completely ostracized because of the blind patriotism of its citizens. This is such a complex relationship for Changez to be dealing with, and it permeates the entire novel. It definitely gives an interesting sense of perspective.

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Dr. Diana Bishop is a university professor who specializes in the history of alchemy. She is also a witch, whose parents were killed when she was only seven, and has tried to ignore her powers and live life as a human. When doing research in the library one day, she somehow manages to recall a text which has been missing for many years. As a result, she is threatened by a number of other \\"creatures\\", some of whom should be on her side (other witches). She finds an unexpected ally in a vampire, who should be her natural enemy. I really enjoyed the book, and found it hard to put down. I read the entire book in a week, and I'm usually not a fast reader. I'm sure this is a book I will read again. I really like all of the main characters, and I like the fact that even the heroine and hero have flaws. I appreciate the fact that the violent scenes were not written in such a way that I got nightmares. There are a couple of \\"sex\\" scenes, but nothing that made me uncomfortable. I hope we don't have to wait too long for the third book! I'm already one third of the way through the second book, and I only started it two days ago.

0345803493|1.0|OK, so this is not necessarily a book meant to be a literary masterpiece, but if only someone had edited it somewhere along the line! Redundant best describes the writing. There is a plot here, interspersed with repetitive dialogue and the sexual antics that pervaded book number 1 of the series. I found myself skipping ahead to avoid the familiar angst ridden main character's inner turmoil about Christian. Tiring at best. The first of the series was better.

B000784WMW|5.0|I've had the VHS version of this production for years. Only recently did I learn that it lacks just over an hour that is contained on the DVD. So I ordered the DVD, and I am so glad I did. Since my VHS is several years old, the color on the DVD is so much sharper, even the sound is clearer. I love Jane Eyre. I've read the book a number of times. This production is the absolute best. I haven't seen all of the different productions, so I can't honestly compare it to many others. I've seen the one starring Samantha Morton and Ciaran Hinds. I've also seen the old 1970 version starring George C. Scott and Susannah York, which is an excellent version as well. Of course it's much easier to convey a story like Jane Eyre in five hours rather than two.<br />In my humble opinion, there could have been no two better actors to play the lead roles. Timothy Dalton, while certainly too handsome to fit the description given Rochester in the book, gave a stellar performance in this. He conveyed every emotion the part called for, not only through his dialog, but also his body language and those deeply expressive eyes. Zelah Clarke was perfect, and I thought fit the description of Jane so well, although she is not a 'plain Jane.'<br />I am so pleased that Alexander Baron, who wrote the dramatization, did not stray from the rich language of the time with all those memorable phrases (...I shall reflect upon the matter...I never meant to wound you thus...Jane, come hither...she is a singular person, Sir...). Yes, the story remains the same even with the language updated to a more comtemporary style, but keeping it authentic adds so much.<br />This production is a gem, and one I will enjoy over and over again for years to come. Film makers planning any future productions of this timless story will be hard pressed ever to top it .

B003O86FMW|3.0|Given the way the story of The Hunger Games ended, it was obvious that a second part was in Collin's mind. The second book explores Panem society a bit more in depth, and still includes everyone's favourite part, another round of Hunger Games.<br /><br />The book begins as Katniss and Peeta get ready to go on the customary Panem-wide winner's tour. They are paraded throughout the country to, mostly, twist the knife into the wound of all the losing districts. But she also realizes that her act of defiance against the Capitol has spurred a spirit of rebellion in Panem. Ambivalent as to her involvement and desire to be part of such a difficult entreprise, Katniss is ready to move on to a more peaceful and wealthy life in her District. But a forced wedding between herself and Peeta forces her to remain in the spotlight, until the new round of Hunger Games are announced, with all the rules changed. Katniss and Peeta are forced to participate in the Games, once again.<br /><br />In Catching Fire, the main focus is Katniss' growing anxiety at her feelings for both Peeta and Gale. Collins artfully captures the flightiness of teenage desire, which remains constant despite a world torn by trauma and pseudo-slavery. In this second round, the rules of the game also change drastically, increasing Katniss' sense of loss of control over her life.<br /><br />Although there is less attention given to the actual Games in this book, we are given ample time to see Katniss suffer from PTSD. I think that Collins' depiction of the effect of PTSD on teenagers, which she deepens in Mockingjay, is the highlight of this book. Katniss' heroic act from The Hunger Games takes its toll, and Collins has no problem depicting her heroine as capable of breaking down and being weak.<br /><br />The writing also gets better in Catching Fire. Collins shows a stronger mastery of the craft and, while still addressing teenagers, is capable of drawing in adults on her own merits. The senselessness of violence and the consequences of repeated trauma are definitely major concerns of Catching Fire.<br /><br />My only gripe with this book: I wish I had learned more about Panem society. Collins kind of opens up the topic by providing an interesting description of one district, and then drops it completely. We do learn from other districts through their competitors in the Games, but it really isn't the same. Somehow I was expecting something a bit more complex, but Collins decided to keep the focus on Katniss herself rather than expand the world she so convincingly sketches, even if lightly.e and the consequences of repeated trauma are definitely major concerns of Catching Fire.<br /><br />My only gripe with this book: I wish I had learned more about Panem society.

B002RHL8DC|1.0|I really wish this show had never been made.

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This is where I started losing my interest a bit. This book reminded me of Sir Walter Scott's Ivanhoe, in that the main character, supposedly the heroine, spends most of the book disabled by PTSD and medication. Even though the final heroic act is hers again, it's hard to see her as the strong character in this last installment. She spends most of her time in a medical haze, or crying, or hiding in a closet.<br /><br />Katniss, now living in discreet, long-lost District 13, has to deal with the trauma of two Hunger Games and the weight of the liberation of Panem on her shoulders. Through her actions in the first book, she has become a symbol of rebellion used to rally the Districts against the Capitol. Much less happens in this third book than in the first two. There are a few battle scenes, and the final one, but otherwise, this book is much more introspective than the other two.<br /><br />But at the same time, this book is among the strongest example of the mental and physical consequences of war and violence on people. It is introspective because Katniss has reached her breaking point. She is exhausted, emotionally and physically, and cannot sustain more trauma. So the book becomes not so much about the liberation of Panem, but about Katniss' eventual, slow liberation from PTSD.<br /><br />The end, although satisfying on a character level, left me wanting on the world-level. We don't know what has happened to Panem, in the end. Is is better for Katniss' intervention, or has it remained the same? I think we're supposed to make a link between Katniss' and Panem's healing, but it's not as obvious as it should be.<br /><br />GENERAL THOUGHTS ON THE TRILOGY<br /><br />These books are rough. Brutal. They don't pull punches and describe war and violence without euphemisms. It's refreshing, in a sense, because it stands in stark contrast with the official-speak so condemned by George Orwell, back in the day. Collins, I'm sure, sees teenagers as able to handle the truth. She doesn't sugar-coat the horrifying acts of violence in both Games and the war.<br /><br />Although the books do live up to their hype, somehow, they don't live up to their potential. The world of Panem deserved much more development than it did. Maybe it's the fan of complex fictional social systems, &agrave; la Middlemarch, in me speaking, but I do think that the world of Panem could have been the site for a much deeper critique of the current state of power and capitalism. It's dystopian-we get it. But how did it become that way? What happened between now and then that the site of American power moved to possibly Colorado (I suspect Denver) and its social structure turned back to medieval times? I've read a lot of anticipatory science-fiction that gave enough information to infer how the world might crumble. Not so with The Hunger Games.<br /><br />All in all, it was a mostly satisfying read. It took me 3 days to read all of them, which makes them a quick and entertaining read. And I must admit I did cry at the end (or that might have been how tired and sick I felt. You'll never know, hah :p). My desire for a more complex world aside, considering the audience, I thought they were excellent examples of what the best YA literature can do.She doesn't sugar-coat the horrifying acts of violence in both Games and the war.<br /><br />Although the books do live up to their hype, somehow, they don't live up to their potential.

She hunts with Gale, her best friend, and they share skills and resources to feed both their families.<br /><br />The book begins a few days before the Reaping. We get Katniss' point of view as she reflects on the consequences of the reaping and its injustice. At their core, the Hunger Games are a version of Roman gladiator shows: a way to control the outer provinces and provide entertainment to a blas&eacute;, luxurious capital population. In the book, the history of the Hunger Games begins with a war, after which the Hunger Games are implemented to \\"remind\\" the people, every year, of the Capitol's power over them. Attendance to the reaping is mandatory, and so is watching the Games. Think \\"Gladiator\\" meets \\"Big Brother\\" in a dictatorship.<br /><br />I felt instant sympathy for Katniss. In a world where living illegally is the only way to eat enough, where social injustice is rampant (and in fact institutionalized) and where children are held hostage against rebellion, her struggle to act morally despite the cruelty around her is heroic.<br /><br />As soon as the Games start, the plot picks up its pace and keeps you turning the pages all the way to the end. Her true/fake love affair with Peeta, which keeps both of them alive, is particularly fraught with teenage anxiety around relationships and desire. But ultimately, this is about survival. Who do you live for? What are you willing to do to survive?<br /><br />The writing, despite its slight faults, is gripping and evocative. Collins has a way to describe horrific scenes in a way that retains the violence, but maintains respect for the human victims. The book left me hungry for more.escribe horrific scenes in a way that retains the violence, but maintains respect for the human victims. The book left me hungry for more.
B00846REIS|5.0|Gotta say, this book completely takes from the 50 Shades of Grey phenomenom, but in my opinion, this is a superior book. The writing is far better and the heroine is actually likable (c'mon, you all are as annoyed with Ana as I am, admit it!). Have to say, the sex scenes are hot and the characters are pretty interesting. You can tell that Sylvia Day is a much more seasoned writer.<br />One thing I kinda wonder about is this (and this is aimed at 50 Shades as well)... What the heck is up with these 28 yr old Adonis Masters of the Universe that seem to be running about? Frankly, unless you're the head of an internet start-up, you have no business being a CEO of a major corporation at 28. Little thing to get annoyed about, but maybe that's just me.
0143119680|4.0|When I first started to read this book I was tempted to put it down.  It was not exciting at all.  But I kept at it and after I got through all the wine tasting and the pace started to pick up I really enjoyed it.  The characters finally came alive.  I look forward to reading the sequel.
B002GSXKN8|1.0|I saw the First two movies at a Kmart in a \\"2 in 1\\" set exactly like this package.  $7.  Later that week, the other two movies with the same kind of packaging for $5.<br /><br />No way in HELL would any human pay this much for something you can get for under $20.<br /><br />Thats all I have to say on that.
1401322336|5.0|book received on time and in good condition. Ordered this book after I watched jamie's documentary \\"forks over knives\\". Book has slightly British-culture recipes with ingredients like lamb and liver. I live in Southern California, so these sorts of recipes don't really appeal to me. BUT, Jamie offers some great \\"basics\\" of cooking in this book in his usual enthusiastic manner. Great photos and easy \\"how-to\\" wording.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|The game is fun and beautiful. But glitchy in that it says I have no net.  I did everything Gameloft suggested in help but no luck. Fix it and I will rerate. I miss the other villages.

B0088RQ4X4|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie but felt the story line was a little rushed, if they would have made this a two part movie and gone into more details it would have been worth it, 4 stars for a lack of patience when it would have helped the movie.
B006ZS81GG|5.0|I really enjoy this album. I actually saw someone listening to it on the bus one day and thought the artist had an interesting look. When I bought the album, it did not take long before I found myself listening to it on repeat every day and watching the videos for my favorite songs on Youtube. Lana has a smooth deep voice and the music is just fun to listen to. I got the deluxe album for a great price too! Buy it! You won't be sorry.
B00785P2QC|5.0|thhis game is great and very addicting. I have spent hours prefecting my city. if u like building or planning this is a great game!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|many games are fun and additive.  the problem and reason for my low rating is that many games are too slow to respond or do not respond at all to my touch. I lose time and points. very frustrating for a game that has so much potential.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|For all the people who complain about the energy. I've had this game for a long time now and I've learner that as you get to higher levels you get ALOT more energy! I have I think somewhere in the 30's of energy right now! I recommend this game to people!
B007WA56SC|4.0|Kylie Minogue  always  seemed to have a cut that worked and often more times than not folks forget how long she has been around doing her brand of dance pop music and having a catchy song at a particular time.  this compilation is a cool set and it showcases her big hits and it works even better these days with modern pop music rolling with euro pop. this is a good set by an artist who had a hand in alot of modern dance pop that you hear today.

B004QOB8SY|4.0|If you are a fan of the Sherlock Holmes books or movies, I think you will enjoy this series as well.<br /><br />At the root, it's the story of an obsessive compulsive detective and his over-protective friend. The friendship between Holmes and Watson is one of the cornerstones of this series, and rightly so.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I love this games, just wish you could start over without removing and installing again. On my third time going.
B007K3JCAE|4.0|Yes, I do think that Robert Downey Jr. has a tendency to play charcters very similar to himself. But, that is part of the appeal here in my mind.<br /><br />Of course, I enjoy the fact that he continually out-smarts his adversaries, even in the face of adversity.<br /><br />And like the [[ASIN:B004QOB8SY Sherlock: Season Two [Blu-ray]]] TV Series, the friendship between Holmes and Watson is a cornerstone of the story-line.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I don't know how this book got any good reviews.  The ending was extremely disappointing and lame.  It ruined the entire book for me.  I've never read Gillian Flynn before and don't think I'll be reading her again anytime soon.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|this really sucks, it shouldnt be at top seller list this talk very bad about amazon giving wrong impression on the book, anyone with a little experience reading novels, know this is a really bad book to have for the summer... i wish someone at amazone reviews the criteria for the books on their top seller list...
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I like this better than Router, which is a similar app. It allows you to &quot;erase&quot; any path that you have already created in a game. In Router there is a back button so if you want to change your first path you have to erase all of your others for that game.
073935275X|5.0|This is a trilogy of the Girl with the dragon tattoo, the Girl who played with fire and the Girl that kicked the hornets nest.  Suspenseful and a great audio book of the trilogy.
B003NX75B8|5.0|Ok, for the sake of increasing even more the rating of this book, I decided to just write the opinion that YOU SHOULD BUY THIS NOW. I really don't know how to make it more clear..
B000ICZCZS|5.0|This is such a great movie with Hugh Grant and he does an absolutely great acting in it and is such a great influence on the boy in the movie.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game it. made me think fast and more focus like and I don't like I love it.  amaaazzing game
B0023S50DO|2.0|Much of this movies does not make logical sense.<br /><br />1. Why not use a phone instead of driving?<br />2. Why was the boy that discovered the comet saved? The movie did not show any instance showing that he was smarter than any of the other students in the class<br />3. Why was the senator / president / fbi so stupid? They should have known that the news reporter knew nothing about the comet.<br />4. The drilling team should have accounted for more fuel.<br /><br />Overall it is mildly entertaining, but painful to watch.
B004FDPOHC|4.0|Having watched the movie, I knew what to expect from this soundtrack. I thought it was great in the theater and I still think the soundtrack is great.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by the special exclusive that Amazon added by downloading the digital only mp3 version, an extra track in addition to what you would get on the normal CD.<br /><br />I'm a little disappointing with the second track, it has Jeff Bridges' voice-over. Which isn't particularly bad, but it means I can't put that particular track in if all I want is some cool background music...<br /><br />All in all, I knew what I was getting (even the part about the voice-over so I'm definitely satisfied by my purchase. With the preview options available, I would definitely recommend picking up at least some favorite tracks.
1451627289|5.0|This book is GREAT! It pulls you in and makes you want to keep reading and reading about Jake Eppling's Story! It starts out in 2011 and then you back to the late 1950's early 1960's on several (small and large) quests to change the future for a girl, a boys family, and then an attempt to reverse the assassination of JFK! I have not yet completely finished the book, but I am half way through and I can tell you I have loved every page I have read. I recommend it to the world!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is awesome I will tell a lot of people about the game. everyone should play this fun game.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't put this book down!  This is such a page turning book.  Author did a great job putting excitement and love into these books.  I am not a reader and i couldn't put these down.  Read all three in two weeks.  Can wait to see more from this author.
0743424425|5.0|I had not seen The Shining movie nor had I read the book until now (at the age of 18). Now that I have read it, I must comment on how impressed I am with the novel. The Shining happens to be the first S.K. novel that I had ever read from cover to cover. I have read several of his short story collections and I tried to read another novel of his, The Stand, but I couldn't finish it because it was too big and boring. Anyways, The Shining is a perfect example of how horror stories should be written. I practically devoured the book after only a week (thats almost 700 pages). I couldn't put it down because of the high level of interest I took in its content. Each scene in the book is described in a brilliant way, which allows the reader to picture it almost perfectly. You almost feel like you are in the story (which is how books should be). I definitely think that The Shining is one of Stephen Kings best works!<br />Zachary B. Medina<br />Author of Decador
B005723JSQ|1.0|I fell in love the Shopaholic series (at least the first three books) and have been reading Sophie Kinsella since then. I was disappointed with 20's Girl but decided to her Kinsella another chance and read I've Got Your Number, and was so very disappointed with the whole book. Where is the funny witty Kinsella ? It's almost as if an evil twin wrote this one, a twin that is not very funny or endearing. The heroine lacks passion and does not have any redeeming qualities. I am finally making a promise to myself not to read any more Kinsella!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I found this game by accident and it is very fun.  I had found a glitches in the friends requests when visiting other cities which I hope the gamers will repair.  Other than this- once you figure out how to leave the game without shutting down your kindle the game is very fun.  By the way--your kindle is not an item for small children without supervision because its too easy to purchase items without the knowledge of the adult.  Fyi!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I had just about given up on Kindle books because of the overabundance of books that contain spelling and grammar errors that hurt my eyes and weak story lines filled in by prater that hurt my brain... but then I found Wool Omnibus Edition. After reading about 20 books over the past few months, Wool is hands down my favorite. It is well-written, suspenseful, intriguing, and wonderfully human. It pulled me in and kept me awake way too late each and every night I was reading it!  Just read it... you will be glad you did.
059306688X|2.0|The beginning and start of the middle of the book {I listened to the audiobook} were OK. This is a slow-mover, and I was disappointed by the boring descriptions of things that weren't important. I became tired of the long-winded descriptions of everything. After the main characters have an experience that would put most, normal people into the hospital, they feel like wandering around DC explaining the mystical significance of everything, in extreme, painful detail. The last half of the book includes a boring conclusion to the main plot, and an even more boring resolution to the over-all story. Brown's tone is dull. Da Vinci is certainly the best of the bunch for this author so far. I fast-forwarded through the last 50 or so chapters, and would have flipped through them if I had been reading the print version. I am happy to be finished with this book, and I would not recommend it if one is interested in a suspense or mystery novel. If one is interested in the theoretical meanings of various symbols, it might be a starting point for research.
B008359C2Q|5.0|The title of my review says it all. I could just copy and paste this for every episode of Mad Men because it's all good!

B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this game. It's the first thing I do when I get home from work. Team Lava makes such fantastic games.
0307341577|5.0|This is one of the best books I believe I've ever read!  You are continuously left wondering through each and every page, until the very end, where you find your suspicions may not have been as correct as you believed.  There is a macabre gloominess throughout the novel, and you are thrust into the pages amongst the characters -- as they come alive, you find yourself feeling sympathetic, horrified, angry, judging them, feeling for them.<br /><br />A VERY powerful novel, and a must read for anyone.
0345529057|5.0|The shipping was great (even to Singapore), the books arrived intact and in time. I watched Game of Thrones season 1 on TV and have to say that I love the book even more. George R. R. Martin has created not just an invigorating plot, but a world where anything is possible, which might be sandals-and-sword, yet very refreshing. I highly recommend this series!
0345803485|3.0|All I know, is that girl's water bill must be astronomical.<br /><br />My wife and I are reading it together, good story and character work, terrible imagery and writing style. Redundant writers write redundantly.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great game. if only I could figure out to to get more acorn. the animation is terrific. I wish I knew how long it takes for an egg to hatch before I buy. would recommend to everyone of all ages.
B00782O7IY|5.0|The movie was absolutely beautiful from start to finish.  The acting was execellent.  The music absolutely fit each scene.  The directing of the movie was superb.  One of the best movies I have ever scene.
B00001ODGR|5.0|I read the reviews before I ordered this concert DVD and the reviews were exactly right.  I really enjoyed watching this concert and would recommend it.  If you like anything that Styx sings, then you will really like this quality concert.
B008JGSM6G|2.0|This is a really bad adaptation of a really good concept that's classically available in much better versions.<br /><br />Sadly, the screen doesn't fit the actual Droid face, and the controls are not nearly sensitive enough.<br /><br />After a few levels, and a few of us trying, we agreed it was cumbersome and boring, and I removed the app promptly.<br /><br />Worth a look since it's free, but don't expect much.
0374531943|4.0|This book covers the life of Michael Collins, the Apollo 11 command module pilot.<br />Make no mistake about it, this was the high stress job of this flight.<br />And the more you read this book, the more you feel that this time all those awful NASA selection processes really flushed out the best guy for the job. This guy was one solid crewman to have on a dangerous mission.<br /><br />Collins is no brainhead. And he doesn't pretend to be.<br />Just a youngest son of a career officer who himself was a son of another U.S. army officer. The frequent home moves during his youth gave him a sense of belonging within humanity in general rather than to those of a single place.<br />It served him well through his decisions to become a pilot after West Point, then a fighter pilot, an instructor and a test pilot before finally getting accepted for the Apollo programme. He also clearly had considerable (and typically understated) self-confidence to go with such professional - and worthy - ambition.<br /><br />This book is well written. Collins credits his West Point all-rounded (humanities, sciences, military and physical) education a lot. But his writing style is clearly very much his own and it makes this book the most readable on the Apollo mission.<br /><br />I won't spoil the main narrative by summarising it.<br />But I can assure prospective readers that this book is as much for the generalist as it is for the technically minded : Collins explains everything very clearly and with plenty of genuine good humour.<br /><br />Enjoy.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|This battery app (more accurately to be used as a widget) will quickly tell you how much juice you've got left, what sort of time that gives you for wifi vs. mobile standby and browsing, talk time, and such.<br /><br />Bonus is that it shows you the amount of battery use committed to open and background apps, allowing forced stops if need be, and it also has a usage graph function over time so you can project your battery needs accurately.

B0073CNYWY|5.0|This is a beauitfully done story. It has all the elements drama, love, war, that entice an audience. Each character has his own story to tell. The personalities of the characters are rich and descriptive. Can't wait for the next season to begin.
1935670913|5.0|How many authors are willing to share their successful formulas with their fan base?  It's unheard of, at least until John Locke, on the heels of his astonishing e-mail successes of his Donovan Creed and Emmett Love series of books decided out of the goodness of his heart how to help those who want to write books and get them out in the marketplace the most sensible and economical way possible.<br />  While I am slowly working on a book and debating writing a fiction book as soon as I convince myself I can do a decent job at it, whether I ever get the opportunity to release a book of my own or not, it's great to have a guide to help get a good start.  Locke doesn't have to do this.  Other successful authors may in fact loathe the fact that their \\"secrets\\" or a successful game plan is out and isn't one of those get rich quick style schemes.<br />I'll let John Locke tell his own story, but I assure you it makes good sense, very good sense.  It isn't dull and includes some brief biographical tidbits for those who are interested.<br />  I am a musician, and I have always maintained that for every band or musician that gets published and gets a record deal and enjoys a fair amount of success there are 1,000 or more out there who are better but lack the connections, money and just plain luck to be more than a local band.  However, as John Locke is pointing out, our computer and internet universe is changing the rules for everybody.  We are clever, and with determination we can find ways to become successful provided we have the musical chops or writing ability and totally eliminate the layers of bloodsuckers who are there to take huge unfair proportions of your profits without doing damn near anything to earn it.<br />  I recommend this book for its great advice and especially for John Locke's incredibly unselfish attitude that we rarely ever see anymore.  Go get 'em, John.

B003FNWR6Y|5.0|The cards and bills are mostly from Mario, which is expected. What else can I say, it's Monopoly, so if you don't find it entertaining and even educational, being it from Nintendo characters won't change your perception. It has nice updates, like mention of Downloadable Content. The most amazing thing is that it arrived the next day, probably because I live in Seattle and we ordered it early morning. We have different editions of Monoply including the traditionla, the Muppets and now this one.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don't write reviews very often but I can't resist.<br />The Wool omnibus edition is fantastic. The characters are richly wrought. The story line is very unique and compelling.  I felt like I woke up one day in the distant future with Jules and Holston, Lukas and Jahns, and all of the rest. I felt like I lived with them through their suffering and triumphs. I'm very much looking forward to future installments. I don't read much Sci Fi but this book transcends genre. Along with City of Thieves by David Benioff, this is my favorite read of the past year. Urgently recommended!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Simply the best I have used with many Bible versions and reading plans plus devotionals. Easy to use and a great tool for keeping a person in the Bible.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|I read this book long ago but never made a comment on it. I loved it , the whole woman taking control of her life and going on this life journey to find herself is very inspirational. It's all about human discovering and wanting to fulfill your life. PLEASE DON'T WATCH THE MOVIE > Now I love Julia Roberts but the movie does not hold a candle to the book. If you want a book to inspire you in so many different ways then this should a great read for you!

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The Avengers does something quite difficult, not it's not CGI or presenting a compellng story (although it does have those). It manages the egos of several mainstream actors without selling any of them short. Everyone wants their character to be the \\"star\\" and the Avengers does a good job of giving each his/her due. Who would have thought that the Hulk would have actually held a solid place in the show, and not just act as a dumb brute. Well done!

B005K17RU0|5.0|with this app I am able to tell the weather without looking at the news on the television.  it's handy to have on the go.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I loved it, more than the movie, my daughter didn't want to watch it, because she thought it would take away from the movie, but after I purchese the first two episodes of the second season she loves it very well acted it is a hit I was tired of watching old Priot so this is very good keep it coming
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app. It is very useful when I lose my calculator.  Also when my calculator isn't around or near me I use this instead of string to find my calculator.
B007L6VR6M|5.0|This a singular Anderson achievement which outdistances his unique body of prior work both by stepping more out into the real world.  The characters and music merge seamlessly with a plot on the surface humorous and entertaining but on reflection thought provoking as well--one of the few movies I have seen in a long time that I have thought about for a long time afterwards and actually look forward to seeing again.  There are really two movies going on at once.  On first viewing, you see the outward moving by focusing on the story and action of the main players; but behind that, as is true of all Anerson films, there is a literally a background plot most of which is missed unless you ignore what is going on in front in order to see behind.  The movie has its strange points, Suzy with the bloody scissors after fending off the scout attackers and Sam's nonchalant reply that it was either them or us, the lighting hit on Sam near the end, and the chaotic final scenes when the storm hits.  I think one of the most poignant moments is when Willis agrees to adopt Sam to save him from Social Services and before agreeing Sam looks to Suzy for her approval--a look that speaks volumes of the depth of their relationship.  A superb cast all around but in my view Suzy steals the show.  Best move I've seen as long as I can remember.
1603427244|4.0|This is a very readable book with clear directions on each of the many ways to cast on and bind off yarns. Did not know there were so many techniques, and this will do me very well for distinction for the garments I make. Another way to stand out in the crowd! Thank you! I especially like the fact that it is spiral bound, that means I can follow the instructions and they stay flat on the table while I read and knit! Awesome!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|These are definitely not the best books I've ever read, but I was definitely captured by the story and could not put them down.  Definitely good for a vacation read and very entertaining.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|InItially the book read like another Twilight, but then the story got interesting. The main character actually behaved like a normal person under the circumstances, however, as the story progressed it became repetitive and the characters became, so unbelievable I almost couldn't finish it. I did enjoy the ending once I got to it and it definitely makes you want to read the next one, but I decided not to.
0439023491|5.0|Set aside time to read these three books, because once you start you just can't stop. One of those wonderful books where you just go there and become part of what has been written.
B003UYUR10|5.0|Saw it in theaters and thought it was good enough to buy on Blu-ray. Good acting, casting, music, screenplay, solid movie all around. The movie has a feel of destiny to it, as do many movies based in asia minor. It seems to me more like a movie for adults/teens but doesn't have potty mouth actors or nudity, so u can watch it with the family.  Some people might have been a bit disappointed if they were big fans of the video game, but that's the way it goes with all these things, right? Personally I don't know, I never played it. But if you watch the movie without expecting anything I think you will enjoy it.

B004XN3FHA|5.0|I like my smaller Surefire flashlights a lot but to go 800 lumens with Surefire is way too expensive so thought I would try Fenix.  I am very pleased with it.  The 4 power settings are at useful levels and one can go from low to high very fast.  Strobe access is also easy although I will rarely use it.  It comes with a hard case which is nice if you are packing it with other gear as it keeps other items from possibly pressing the \\"on\\" button as it does require only a light touch to operate.  It is nice they also include extra O-rings.  I have no way to test the brightness but seeing the results of the high setting I have no reason to doubt the 800 lumen claim - it is a very bright and useable throw.  As others have stated the battery holder rattles inside, but only if you try to, it does not rattle under normal use with my copy.  I use Powerex 2700 rechargeable batteries and they work well with it.  Highly recommend if you want a bright flashlight in a fairly compact package.

B000O8OTNC|4.0|I'm not trying to get my knives ancient-Japanese-katana sharp, just decently sharp. I didn't need another elaborate, intricate, difficult to use sharpening system like the ones I've purchased and tried in the past (I'm looking at you, Lansky). This little sharpener did the trick on everything from a Kabar to my multi-tool to some old and dull kitchen knives. I give this 4 stars because the fold out rod was only marginally useful on serrated blades. For just over $8, you can't go wrong.

B007G51UV0|4.0|Update:  Board is outstanding (once replacement of motherboard and CPU were received).  System booted with no problems.  Outstanding customer service from Amazon was a great help in ensuring this build succeeded.  System has been running stable now for 48 hours.  ASUS has done an outstanding job with the included driver CD.  Installing required drivers and utilities from their CD was easier than from other system builds that I have completed.  While I have some complaints about the AI Suite's user interface, overall I am happy with the software and drivers.<br /><br />For comparison here is my system build.<br /><br />Corsair Obsidian 650D<br />ASUS P8Z77-V PRO<br />Intel i5 3570K<br />Corsair DDR3 1600 8Gb<br />Corsair 850AX power supply<br />Asus GeForce GTX 670-DC2-2GD5<br />Samsung 830 Series 128 GB SSD<br />WD Caviar Green 3Tb<br /><br />Optical drives were reused from a previous build.<br /><br />----<br /><br />Received this motherboard for a new system build.  Once everything was installed and went to boot the system for the first time got all the proper initial indications.  Got the Standby power LED when I turned on the power supply.  However when I powered the system on for the first time it would not boot.  I got three of the four boot LED indications for a fault.  CPU, VGA and Boot Device LED's.  The VGA LED was interesting as I was using the integrated graphics from an i5 3570k for the initial system load.  The VGA card was going to be installed after the OS and initial driver load was installed.  This was not a big issue as Amazon allowed me to return it and get a replacement rapidly.  The replacement arrived and was installed, however on initial boot I got the CPU_LED lit.  It appears that the original motherboard may have damaged the processor.  Processor is being returned, and hopefully I will have it tomorrow to attempt initial boot once again.  I have had many ASUS motherboards over the years and have never once had a problem with any of them, ASUS motherboards have always been quality and my first consideration when building a system.  I do not know if karma finally caught up to me, or if there is some other reason for this problem.  I will update this review after the replacement processor is received.  This is more frustrating than anything, especially when spending $1,500 on a new system (minus displays).

B00821OW8K|3.0|I have to rate this fairly average, as someone who's seen a lot of sci-fi, both good and bad.  I'm given really no main character to identify with as a female.  Ignoring the girl geeks is a rather serious mistake.  I loved Star Trek in all its incarnations, as well as Star Wars, Babylon 5, Stargate, and Doctor Who.  If the premiere is any indication of how the rest of this series will go, I'm going to have to skip it.

B0077ATSSQ|5.0|I guess I am amazed at how low the average review of this movie is. I thought this was as good as \\"Big Fish\\" or \\"Notebook\\".<br /><br />This is a story of a child trying to get his life together after the tragic and traumatazing loss of his father. His does it in his own, very unusual way. I am not going to go in too much detail. It's a great movie, a tear-jerker for sure. I feel that it's definitely a must-see.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|An awesome princess tale that isn't centered around some \\"romance\\". Creative and fun . Merida is so much more human than other characters I've seen. She is proud,strong and selfish. You watch her develope into a kind and noble person. You also see that sometimes the \\"greater good\\" starts at home with her mother the Queen. The real adventure is not all the incredible things that happen, but rather how everyone grows from it. Plus a  ferocious fight scene at the end doesn't hurt either.
0345803485|5.0|I am not an avid reader, but I had someone tell me about this book and I started to read.  I finished books 1 and 2 in about a 4 day span which may not be alot for most people, but for me it was great.  I could not put this book down.  I have finished all three books and I will put them at #1 on my list.  At first I thought about not reading it because I wasnt sure how far the erotic scenes would play but they were not that bad. I would truly recommend this book.
0312641893|5.0|Marissa Meyer's Cinder (book 1 of the Lunar Chronicles) is a highly engaging, complex, and imaginative novel. I was captivated at page one and couldn't stop, I got the audio version of the story so I could listen to it  straight through while doing my chores. The characters were well rounded, I loved the descriptions used for the city and for the people. The Cinder's narrative felt genuine and techno-geeky, ringing true to her cyborg, mechanic personality. Even the robots felt alive, especially Iko.<br /><br />The story is tremendously complex, you can tell there will be many books written about this world. And though there were parts that I guessed ahead of time, I waited in anticipation for the execution of how the information would unfold. The progression of relationships between Cinder and the various characters in the story are well developed and well executed. No matter who's POV we were in, the story was exciting and moved forward quickly.

B005LAIHXQ|2.0|Prometheus might be the most expensive, most well-done grindhouse B-movie I've ever seen.<br /><br />There's a lot to appreciate about the filmmaking at play here.  The visuals are very impressive and detailed, with effective blending of CGI and practical sets.  The performances are really strong all around and the general pacing and atmosphere and things like that are all effective and evenly laid out.  It's so technically strong that it makes the absolute insanity and inconsistencies in the script and story really, really standout.  It's not a fun movie.  It's an impressive movie, but certainly not a fun one, and I wouldn't really know who to recommend it to.  It's not good sci-fi, because there are too many plot and logic holes.  It's certainly not a horror film, though it pretends to be one every so often.  I suppose it's more of an action/thriller?<br /><br />I guess the bottom line is, so long as you're not looking for anything that makes sense, you'll be okay.  It sounds weird to say that, because we all assume that we're want things to make sense, but...  I guess if you really, really liked Lost, and didn't care that it turned out to be made up on the fly, you might really get off on Prometheus.<br /><br />Mostly it's a visually impressive mess; a mediocre-to-bad script with excellent performances.<br />And the occasional penis snake.<br /><br />Let's cut this thing open, shall we?<br /><br />****HEAVY SPOILERS!  SUPER HEAVY SPOILERS!  I'M SERIOUSLY!*****<br /><br />Okay, so the basic plot of the movie is this: Some archeologists... or space archeologists or whatever... find various evidence that points to a planet where they believe the aliens who created human life may have come from.  Old Man Guy Pearce hears about this and funds a trillion dollar expedition to go to the planet to meet the creators because it would be awesome and because maybe they can keep him from dying from horrible old-age makeup.  Once they get there they do find their creators, butalso find out that said creators seem to hate humans and had been planning on wiping us all out with a super weapon (super-gross weapon, actually) before they accidentally killed themselves with that same weapon.  It's left unclear whether all of the creators (or \\"engineers\\" as they call them because it sound more differenter) died out or whether they just gave up on the whole attack earth thing and our surviving protagonist hijacks an alien ship with her bodyless robot friend to try and found out.<br /><br />I actually, really like that plot.  That's a neat story.  The problem comes from all the BS they layer on top of and around that story to pad it out to beyond necessary lengths.  It's such an awkward and stupid script; I'm not sure where to begin.<br /><br />There's a whole subplot with the android, David (played by Magneto), starts messing around with this Black Goo they find.<br /> Now, there's a bit in the beginning where an alien drinks the Black Goo and melts... which is not what the Black Goo (or BG, as I call it for no reason) does later, but whatever.<br />So, the scientists science it a little bit and sort of off-handedly decide its some kind of weapon.  David steals a jar of it, brings it on the ship, and secretly feeds it to the head scientist... for some reason.  It's heavily implied that Old Man Pearce asked him to do this during a clandestine meeting (while Old Man Pearce is faking his death for some reason; a ruse that fools exactly zero people in the audience).  The BG winds up making the head scientist really sick, but not until the next day and not until after he's had sex with Scientist hot-pants.  So he dies and she gets pregnant with an alien monster baby that almost kills her.  Magneto tells her about it after examining her, but then says that she shouldn't have the monster surgically removed, but instead should just go be re-frozen.  Hot Pants puts herself into an auto-surgeon 9000 and the movie turns into torture porn for a bit as the rapidly growing alien squid thing gets removed from her gut, c-sections style. ...in her defense, she takes it pretty well and is running and climbing in about twenty minutes time.  Also, that squid thing just sort of hangs out in there until the end of the movie, when it's grown into a nine-foot long version of the facehugger from Alien.  Oh, also, the BG turns a different guy into a murderous zombie... somehow.  Also another guy tries to pet a hissing alien penis snake and gets (deservedly) brutally murdered for being a dumb action movie idiot.<br /><br />If you bothered to read all that and you're wondering what it had to do with the plot about finding the creator aliens, the answer is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!!  It's 60% of the movie and it is total, pointless filler.<br /><br />Why would David feed the Goo to what's-his-name?  Did Guy Pearce ask him to, just to see what would happen?  Did he become an evil Android for a minute, just for the hell of it?  It couldn't have possibly been planned out beforehand because they didn't even know that the BG existed until David stole a bunch of it.  The whole sub-plot implies, with half conversations and significant glances, that David or Guy Pearce or possibly Charlize \\"Daddy Issues\\" Theron is carrying out some intricate plan... that benefits literally no one and gets a bunch of people killed.<br /><br />It's a total red-herring (along with several others I don't have the energy to relive right now) that desperately tries to confuse the audience into thinking the movie is super-duper smart.<br /><br />Also, how about this - near the end of the movie it's established that this is NOT the Alien's home planet, but a planet they use to make awful, awful weapons.  This is confirmed at the end when David tells Hot-pants that he can lead her to the actual home planet so she can get her answers... or, you know, die horribly, which is far more likely.  So WHY would the aliens leave, on Earth, little maps to the planet they make weaponson.  Of all the planets they (apparently) hang out at, why a map to THAT one?<br />I could keep going, but there's no need to beat that poor horse anymore.<br /><br />Aside from the insultingly stupid script, the visuals (while well done) are just a series if images borrowed from other sources.  Alien, Star Trek, the Abyss... a slew of sci-fi designs were yoinked to make the ship, the space-suits, the planet itself - almost nothing felt truly original to me.  But, I don't know, maybe that's me reading too much into it and being hypercritical.  I'm not exactly on the movie's side at this point.<br /><br />I suppose the greatest falling apart is that the film never knows what it wants to be.  It wants to be a prequel to Alien, but doesn't want to be an Alien movie.  Sometimes it's a horror movie, with creepy monsters and jump scares.  Sometimes it wants to be an action movie, with obligatory action scenes and flamethrowers and expendable guys with guns.  Sometimes it wants to be a psychological thriller about God, Religion and hating your parents.  Sometimes it's a stupid monster movie.<br /><br />And never once is it Science Fiction.  Don't even bother.  Just because something is in space doesn't make it science fiction.<br /><br />I don't argue that Ridley Scott is a very talented film maker, and I don't argue the movie is a lot better than a wide array of things out right now.  But if you're like me, and you like a decent story, this mess is absolutely infuriating.<br /><br />Vagina squids and all.

034580404X|4.0|The Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy is a must read.  I couldn't put it down and felt like I put my life on hold temporarily until all three books were finished.  My friends, who initially couldn't understand the draw, are now sharing them and completely get it.  They too are hooked on the Fifty Shades, the characters, the emotions, all of it.  And, they too have put their lives on hold to read them all. While we may not all live the lives of these characters, it certainly is exciting and provocative to read about.  Get it now, read it now.

0062197258|5.0|This is a first book by a new author, and it is a chilling one. The story line goes on two tracks, one taking place in 2003, and the other in 2007. They both are focused on the same young woman, who, in the earlier track, meets a very attractive man and begins dating him. The relationship turns rather nasty, and none of her friends believe her when she tries to explain to them that he is very dangerous.<br /><br /> The second track relates the life of this woman several years after her former boyfriend is incarcerated, and it shows the awful results in her life of the trauma she suffered earlier. She meets a man who appears to be sympathetic and willing to help her, but just when her life appears to be getting back into balance, she is informed that the former boyfriend has been released from prison. This, of course, does not help her recovery at all, merely adding to her paranoia.<br /><br /> To say more would be a disservice to future readers of this excellent book. The author takes the reader on a journey into the troubled mind of a victim of serious abuse, and shows the unusual ways she has developed in order to cope with her problems. There are some really rough scenes in this book, and it probably isn't for the fainthearted. That being said, however, I can highly recommend it as a cautionary tale to those who let their lives be run by nightlife, indiscriminate drinking and anonymous sexual contacts. It's also quite a good read!
B005LAIGOQ|3.0|This flick is a good start for Daniel Radcliffes' post \\"Harry Potter\\" acting career.  Though slow moving, we are treated to a  forboding,  foggy,  English countryside atmospheric style photography throughout.  Radcliffe plays his investigator roll low key and dosen't become bigger than the picture itself.  A mothers' lament for the avoidable death of her son, takes its' toll on a small remote village, after her death.  Be prepared for a few sudden shock sequences!  This is thought provoking horror, with minimal blood and gore, akin to pictures made in the 1940's 50's and 60's.  The CGI contibution is mainly for background, rather than creating overblown fantasy creatures.  For an hour and a half Radcliffe must hold our attention.  His fans and those who enjoy ghost stories should both be satisfied.  The films ending packs an unexpected punch!

This conceited loser thought he deserved an important position in the Kenyan government.  When his superiors disagreed, he become an alcoholic and drank himself to death.  Barrack met this man only once, when he revisited Hawaii during Barrack's tween years and when he berated the poor child to work harder at school(between visits to the local bars).<br />Barrack did not want to believe that this loser didn't care about his abandoned wife and son and so contrived his silly and pathetic tale that he only abandoned Barrack because of the important work he was doing.<br />It would just be a sad tale, except that the &quot;important work&quot; was bringing a Communist government to Kenya, and this dream father has inspired Barrack to do the same to this country.<br />Our dead economy is the result of this childhood delusion.

0679420266|2.0|The characters in this book make my skin crawl. Salamano beats his dog, Raymond beats his mistress, Meursault kills a man for no reason, and then a bunch of stupid court officials try Meursault for his character instead of his crime. Meaursault himself seems psychopathic. As someone who has been diagnosed with moderate recurrent depression, I have felt miserable for long periods of time, tried to disengage from life, and believed that existence has no meaning. A lot of people have had these thoughts, because life is cruel and unfair. And yet, unlike Meaursault, we haven't killed anyone.<br /><br />Maybe if it were the first existensialism I'd ever read, I would have been impressed. As it is, I just think The Stranger is a bleak book about a bunch of terrible people.

B002KANXXE|5.0|There are many reactions that an Austen fan gets when they confess themselves as such. Perhaps a shared fangirl squee. Maybe an \\"of course you are.\\" Plenty of times it's the admission of not getting Austen. Of not enjoying \\"romance novels.\\" Of being confused or bored by her prose.<br /><br />I carefully say that I am a fan, as I haven't yet made my way through all her works. More than anything, I love Pride and Prejudice with a deep, nostalgic, I've-read-it-a-million-times love.<br /><br />A friend of mine recently picked this up for a re-read, and her reading updates inspired me to give Persuasion a try. It took about three or four chapters before I liked Anne Elliot immensely and reading through the rest of the book was surprisingly easy. What Austen writes is more nuanced than just a romance novel. Her books, Persuasion included, are full of humor and smart commentary and little treats throughout the narration.<br /><br />I think it's all the better that my first time reading Persuasion has happened in my mid-twenties. Where while reading Pride and Prejudice I am all giggles and swoons, Persuasion had me relating and nodding sagely. Anne Elliot is the Austen character I've found so far the easiest to relate to. We've all had our opinions persuaded, we've all felt overlooked, we've all questioned the decisions of our family, we've all questioned our own past decisions. There we find Anne as she finds herself once again moving in the same social circle as Captain Wentworth, \\"the one that got away,\\" to put it tritely.<br /><br />Anne is to be appreciated as a more mature Austen character. She has many admirable traits and many quirks that made me like her. I loved that at 27, and sort of lost in the shuffle of her life, losing consequence and being overlooked, her happiest moments are when she feels useful. Yes, girlfriend. I also loved that often times, she had to retreat, and sit in silence and consider her own thoughts.<br /><br />Though I didn't feel the relationship between Wentworth and Anne quite as much as Darcy and Elizabeth, I loved the themes the plot set up let Austen explore. I loved the relationship between Admiral and Mrs. Croft. It is not often that Austen gives us peeks of long lasting, happy marriages, and in the Crofts she comments on what she thought it ought to be. Sharing the reigns while driving sort of thing. A second favorite moment came when Anne was discussing the differences in feeling between women and men. More than agreeing with anything that was said, I loved it in context. And, of course, that conversation led the way for THE romantic moment in the book, Wentworth's letter to Anne.<br /><br />At the end, I can't really compare this to Pride and Prejudice. I loved that one longer and better. That said, I also can't give Persuasion anything less than five stars. For any faults you might find in Austen, she was not a one hit wonder. Here she provides another book to fall in love with, and I have no doubt that I will visit Anne again. And again, and again.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Works fine, just fine. Alerts are pretty fast but some times it shows me in a different part of the state than I actually am. Does what I need it to.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I've been had. By a book.<br /><br />Gillian Flynn has done her job well. You can tell that she set out to not give us characters to like or root for, but to present to us a study of a complex and ultimately deeply damaged couple, Nick and Amy Dunne.<br /><br />For the first quarter of the book, I HATED Nick Dunne. There was little for me to relate or hold on to in the first place, as I've never suffered an unhappy marriage, but on top of that I actively hated Nick. Then, the twists and turns start and I just didn't know who to hate anymore.<br /><br />The first quarter of the book is also slow. Yes, you have the big mystery present from the onset, but it doesn't actually start feeling like a mystery until way too far into the book. I was curious because I wanted to know what happened, but for the first 35% of the book, the author wasn't doing an amazing job of stringing that curiosity along.<br /><br />Once the thrills and spills start, I can't say that I ever once saw anything coming. Mostly because at that point, my emotions, mostly hatred and annoyance towards the main characters, were involved. I wasn't trying to guess what came next, I JUST NEEDED TO KNOW.<br /><br />One of the reasons I'm wavering on the rating is because I felt manipulated. Yes, authors do play on the emotions of their readers, but I just feel like the very best ones do so effortlessly. It's the old theater saying that to hear someone say, \\"that's a great actress\\" is not a very good compliment at all. You don't want the audience to feel like they are watching an actress; you want them to be lost in a character. I felt manipulated. I saw the strings. There were such big A-HA MISDIRECTION moments that it felt a little cheap in the grand scheme of things.<br /><br />But. Flynn made me care. She made me feel things. She made me want to know how it ended. And at the end, she made me care and feel things all over again. It's hard to rate a book with such unlikable characters. The taste that's leftin my mouth is that dislike, but that doesn't mean the author's done a bad job, you know?<br /><br />If you are even remotely curious, I say go for it. If nothing else, reading this book will at least satisfy that curiosity.

0765316994|3.0|1.) I am not a Trekkie. I have watched episodes and I knew enough to know what a \\"redshirt\\" is and be intrigued. So, though I can appreciate and have basic knowledge of sci-fi series and tropes, I am not an expert.<br /><br />2.) These are three fun stars.<br /><br />Because all said and done, and despite the problems I had with the book, I never stopped enjoying myself as I read it. It was incredibly easy to read and moved quite quickly. I'm sure most people would be able to manage it in one sitting.<br /><br />I did laugh, though not the LOL, fully belly shaking laughter some people have described in their reviews. I also know, though, that many of the nods to other sci-fi works went over my head, so I lost LOL opportunities there.<br /><br />Even though I liked this book and found it entertaining, I can't help but feel that there was so much more promise in the premise.<br /><br />We see fuller manifestations of that promise in the opening chapters and then in the three codas at the end. At the beginning, Andy Dahl, our protagonist, fumbles around as he figures out that something strange is going on- that nonsensical things happen on the ship, that people avoid particular crew members and that away missions are avoided at all costs. This opening action is full of humor but not yet beaten down with the meta hammer or bogged down by shoddy plot devices.<br /><br />The truth is that Scalzi does what he intended by taking on these tropes. But. What we love to hate on TV doesn't completely work in novel form. It's easier, for example, to get away with a rotating cast of underdeveloped characters in a series than it is in a book. On TV we have visual clues. In the book, I kept asking myself, \\"who is this one again?\\"<br /><br />Most of the time, though, it didn't matter who \\"this one\\" was because the characters all bled together. The Girl, the Friend, um, the Other Friend... another guy... etc. There were no personalities, which again, is funny when you think about thembeing \\"redshirts\\" but is also a disservice to the book as a whole, as you read it.<br /><br />The writing is okay. Even though all the characters were basically the same person, the bright side is that they were a funny person! I would call the dialogue a bright spot, except that Scalzi suffers from Bad Dialogue Tagging-itis, which isn't a real thing but should be. He ends nearly every line of dialogue with a so and so said. All those \\"saids\\" add up and it grates.<br /><br />Despite my best efforts to accept it for what it is, I have a little bit of a problem with the plot. Scalzi uses this novel to poke fun at nonsensical plot devices used to solve unsolvable problems nice and neatly. Then, he employs one of these devices to solve all his problems, nice and neatly. Again, it's amusing to look at it in a \\"I see what you did there,\\" sort of way. While you are reading it? In the middle of the book when things keep making less and less sense? At the end of it all when you couldn't explain what happened if someone asked you to? Meh.<br /><br />The main action of the novel ends super abruptly. I was not expecting the end when it came and it really provided no satisfaction. It's a good thing the three codas at the end are great. They really helped wrap up the book, but also to infuse the fluffy plotting with a touch more gravity.<br /><br />Overall, I think bigger fans of the genre probably enjoyed this more than I could have. People like me, though, can still enjoy this easy, entertaining read as long as they are willing to accept it for what it is.<br /><br />I read this at the beach on Saturday afternoon. It was a nice fit.
B004XXIHS2|5.0|I have read most of Ira levin's  work (Rosemary's Baby, Stepford Wives, etc.).  I recently found \\"A Kiss Before Dying\\" on kindle.  I bought the Audible version.  The only downside to Audible books is that you frequently  doze off.  However, the audible experience was great.<br /><br />\\"A kiss before dying \\" was a terrific read--fast, exciting and keeps you guessing.  It is the author's very first book and his writing just keeps getting better.<br /><br />The book out starts out with young romance at a college campus.  However, the male suitor has ideas that go well beyond romance.  He plans to marry the heiress and gain  instant financial success.  Dorothy foils his plans by becoming pregnant.  He promptly murders her in a very cold blooded way.  The murder is  declared a suicide.  Enter the second sister who becomes suspicious.  The book constantly keeps you guessing by never revealing the actual name of the killer.<br /><br />The writing style of \\"A Kiss...\\" is terrific.  It's taut, suspenseful, fast moving.  It gets right to the point and does not look back.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed and recommend this book.<br /><br />S OBrien , Il, USA

030758836X|3.0|The first two-thirds of this book is fabulous.  Wonderfully written with lots of clever twists and \\"a-ha\\" moments.  The last third of the book jumps the shark and devolves into almost romance novel prose.  And the ending is lame and unsatisfying.
B00756GKBA|5.0|MDNA is a great album, even though the first CD contains great songs such as Girl Gone Wild, Give Me All Ur Luvin, Superstar, I Don't Give A, and many more.The second CD on this deluxe edition contains my favorite song on the Cd I F****d Up which has now become one of my favorite Madonna songs. Having been a person who originally bought the one disc CD and then bought the deluxe edition I would definitely say that any true Madonna fan should start out with this CD because they will enjoy it more then the one disc CD. I have been a fan of Madonna my whole life and I will continue to buy her CD's. MDNA is one of the great albums that Madonna has released.

0446572993|5.0|These days, it seems it's becoming more and more difficult to find a book that truly takes you by surprise. One which takes your expectations and then proceeds to completely blow them out of the water. I'll be completely frank; I absolutely loved The Innocent. David Baldacci set out to create an edge of your seat thriller and completely succeeded in every key area.<br /><br />The story follows Will Robie, an American covert assassin who knows how to get the job done. His life takes a surprising turn for the worse when his next target is actually an innocent victim. Upon refusing, he's targeted by people within his own organization and soon meets up with a fourteen year old girl, Julie, who's on the run for her own reasons. Their fates soon become intertwined as they find themselves in the middle of a grand conspiracy buried deep into the very heart of the American government.<br /><br />I've never heard of David Baldacci until now but his reputation clearly precedes him, the man knows how to make a great thriller. The book has a terrific plot; it's so exquisitely devised in such a manner that you can't help but marvel at the ingenuity that went into its creation. As the story begins to hit its stride early on, the reader soon finds themself consumed in a maelstrom of lies and deception. Seemingly no one can be trusted, and each frequent twist or clue adds even more depth to the overarching narrative. Eventually, everything that you believe is concrete, Baldacci takes and completely shatters into something else. These various revelations and surprises interwoven into the plot will keep you guessing to the very end and clamoring for just one more chapter. It's a story that's easy to comprehend yet so satisfyingly complex in its execution. It's also worth mentioning that Baldacci uses the tried and true `short chapter' format for his prose in order to keep the pace at an all-time high. This writing technique is a rather risky double-edged sword. It can either create the sensation of speed, adding weight to the intensity of the storytelling, thus creating urgency. Or it can fall right on its face and seem like a cheap gimmick used to create the facade of a fast-paced book. Fortunately, The Innocent falls into the former than the latter. With this dichotomy of adrenaline-filled pacing and a brilliantly satisfying plot, Baldacci is able to create the most important element of a proper thriller: suspense. The sense of discovering what's to come, who's behind it, and their real ultimatum is so intoxicatingly entertaining that it's easy to lose yourself among the pages.<br /><br />Even with such an engrossing premise and pacing, a book cannot possibly be entertaining if the characters aren't interesting, nor if the reader isn't given a reason to care about their predicament. Again, Baldacci nails it, the characters he's illustrated are not only interesting; they're probably the best I've ever seen from a techno-thriller. As much as I love characters that feature a James Bond esque persona, it's definitely a nice change of pace to find one that's written in a strikingly believable manner. As I said, Will Robie is at his core, a professional killer that works for the United States government. His profession has left his life without a sense of passion or hope, an almost complete disconnect from the world and the people that live in it. His stoic personality may be seen as a shortcoming too some people, but I found him too be sympathetic and surprisingly realistic. In reality, a killer isn't going to have a roguish charm that appeals to people, but rather an anti-social personality with a cold demeanor on reality and death that pushes others away.<br /><br />The other main character, Julie, is a gifted child with the burden of having to grow up too fast. While she requires the aid of Robie in order to survive her assailants, she never feels like an annoying addition too the book. She's street-smart and intelligent enough that she actuallycontributes to the plot rather than feeling like a burden. Here presence also adds a much needed dose of humor to what is an otherwise very stoic genre of military caricatures and stereotypes. Yet it's the relationship between these two characters that really showcases Baldacci's knack for strong characterization. With his skillset, Robie acts as the guardian for Julie, while she brings out the humanism locked within him, giving him the honorable task of protecting someone other than himself. It's very endearing, and it's punctuated even more by very amusing dialogue between the two. The book also doesn't rely on an oversized cast of personas to fill its ranks, but rather focuses on a small cast of characters with each one leaving a strong impression.<br /><br />When comparing this book to other techno-thrillers and why I believe it's vastly superior to the majority of the market, I'd describe the approach the author took as \\"streamlined.\\" David Baldacci doesn't fall into the pit trap that I've seen from my personal experience of reading techno-thrillers. He's not using this novel as an excuse to show off his vast knowledge of military equipment and tactics, or our country's political structure. He just wanted to create an exciting novel set in modern-day America with a light dose of politics to create the backdrop. Will Robie works for the government and kills bad guys, that's all you need to comprehend. It's simplistic, it's easy to get into, and it works. The rest is common knowledge that any U.S. citizen would easily understand.<br /><br />I hate to describe something as \\"perfect\\", but I literally cannot find a single flaw with The Innocent. It's a masterfully plotted thriller with excellent characterization, a well-conceived plot, and the suspense is literally non-stop. It's so fast and exciting that you'll be hard pressed to find a more entertaining book anywhere. I'm definitely looking forward to reading the rest of David Baldacci's work.
0061692042|1.0|I looked forward to reading this book.  I made myself read the whole thing because I thought the interesting part had to be there some where.  But I was wrong.  Certain parts of the storyline were told ahead of time so there were very few surprises.

It just changes the way your perceive news and events.<br /><br />It is incredibly fun to read, very witty and you can't help but feel intellectually raised a bit upon finishing it.<br /><br />It doesn't outright teach you much about trading but the knowledge contained within this book will make every trader who is willing to grow, a better trader.<br /><br />I've never read a book and been so intellectually infatuated by an author till now!<br /><br />I cannot wait to read his other titles.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|We beat the game within a few weeks then it froze and we cant get back on to play. The game its self was great graffics and fun. When ever I send a request telling that it doesnt work I get no response.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This game keeps the mind stimulated. Graphics are great, background music keeps it stimulating as well and game-play is smooth. Thanks for putting out a quality game...and for free, too.
B005FITIGO|3.0|This is a good movie, but its all too self contained. Everything happens within a falling investment bank, theres little contact with the outside world, which is the point of the movie, but also something of a failing. This would be an excellent first part of a trilogy. Its very good, but it might leave you wanting much more.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|Whatever I say will be somewhat biased just because I LOVE Robert Downey Jr. I have always been a big fan of mystery and detective like stories and movies, but shockingly, I had never read or watched any adaptations of Sherlock Holmes. I admit, the only reason checked both Sherlock Holmes movies was because of RDJ. BUT,I feel as though whomever they would've cast as Holmes I still would've liked the movie still. I liked the story plot of the movie and also the focusing in on the relationship between Watson and Sherlock. The movie had me thinking the whole time and I was happy that in the midst of all the twists and turns I was able to keep up and not be confused. Noomi Rapace did an amazing job as Madame Simza as well. In fact, I think everyone did a great job in their respective roles. I also enjoyed that in the film that Sherlock didn't \\"win\\" easily. He had someone just as smart and quick-witted (although they were the antagonist) as he (Prof. Moriarty) that was a great challenge for him. I can't decide whether I like this one or the first Sherlock Holmes better. In the end, this movie is definitely worth a purchase!
0307341550|5.0|This book mesmerized me. It is a mystery, but what makes it so enjoyable is the absolute skill of the writer. The characters are well-drawn and complex; deeply flawed and yet strangely relatable and even appealing. I read all three of Ms. Flynn's books in less than a week, and would absolutely recommend all of them. I hope this author keeps writing; I am looking forward to another wonderful story soon
0345803485|2.0|This reminded me of a young adult read with soft porn. The writing was terrible and the author uses the same 10 words in every other paragraph. I had to slap myself sometimes wondering why I kept reading it, but I did. It reminded me of a Jackie Collins novel my mom used to read but with harsher and more detailed sex adventures. It's an easy read and worth it just to see what all the fuss is about. It's a chick lit, not Voltaire. The first one if probably my least favorite, but it got me reading the second and third volumes which I found much better.
0345803485|1.0|This story is horribly written, boring, juvenile, and pedestrian. The characters are one-dimensional ( if not fractional) and the pacing is glacial. The subject matter might have been intriguing in the hands of someone who could actually write. Don't waste your time and money.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is awesome omg awesome me and my friends all have the same app I think every body should get it
B004P1JEXE|3.0|This book was hard to get through. At times it felt like school reading where i was reading just to get through it as opposed to enjoying it like i did the previous three books. The problem Martin has here is he completely overestimates how interesting and meaningful his minor characters in fact are. By minor in this case i mean Cersei, Brienne, Samwell and so forth. Yes they have major parts to play but they are not the main characters of the overall story.<br /><br />The annoying part about this book is that nearly half of it is divided between Cersei and Brienne and they both seem to have the exact same personal conflict driving their narrative. Both struggle with the fact they are strong women trying to fit in a mans role and are forced to suffer a lack of respect their peers would never receive. Simply put Brienne and Cersei's story lines are boring. Cercei spends the entire book scheming and plotting on the small council and it feels like a really poor political storyline. Nothing happens that couldn't have been told to other characters by ravens. Brienne's stroyline is even worse. Her entire arc is made redundant by the fact she is searching for a character who we know the location and situation of so there is no mystery to it. She plods around and like cersei we could have just learned of her actions in other more plot-forwarding stories.<br /><br />This book is not a complete loss however. Jaime's story may not be brimming with great plot but his character development helps save his portion of the story while the heart of Samwell's story is engaging. Arya's brief appearance whets the appetite but it only points out the glaring problem of having the major characters absent. Sansa's story doesn't do much either and isn't particularly worth mentioning.<br /><br />The Ironmen save this book from a two or one star review, though their storyline isn't perfect. For me i would have preferred if Martin had of made a decision and told their story from a single pointof view, but he decided to give Asha, Victarion and Aeron their own chapters. For me Victarion was the best addition to the series in this book as his mixture of loyalty/tradition/honor is so twisted its hard to see where the noble fighter gives way to the vicious killer. i would have preferred to see the iron islands through his eyes as opposed to a fractured experience.<br /><br />I wish Martin had of stuck to his original plan which was to return with his fourth book having followed a five year gap in the story. This would have made a great sense as the third felt like a great end to the first part of the story. In the end he decided to fill in the five year gap and its noticeable that he has no story here for the most part.<br /><br />Feast of Crows is a book about moving pieces around the board, getting them ready for the final act of the story, but most moves are unnecessarily detailed. The book could delete the entire Brienne and Cersei storyline, have updates for them in other characters POV chapters and the book would not suffer. In fact it would not be as hard to read.

0937381888|5.0|This book nails it down! The first chapter gets you brewing right off the get-go. He takes into account the varied ways one might come to the brewing event, i.e. home-brew kits, prehopped extract, individually bought ingredients, etc. and writes a step-by-step through the process. you will be brewing the day you get the book. no long chapters of all the ways to mess up. after the first chapter the book goes deeper and deeper into the brewing craft. you can stop after the first chapter and make great beer (i have made his example Cincy Ale, and love it), or keep going.<br /><br />This book has all the simple basics laid out for the average guy, or all the intricacy and minutia for the die hard.<br /><br />A brilliant book that doesn't make assumptions that everyone has all the perfect equipment, and facilities, AND TIME. Palmer is real about how to brew, and funny even: \\"the first thing about lagering is temperature. Make that temperature and time. No, there's three: temperature, time and yeast\\" I half expected the Spanish inquisition to jump from the next page.
B008FLYM50|5.0|Most people here have said it, so I won't repeat it. Simply an amazing and intelligent pop album. Brilliant. The best part for me is how the production only stands out when combined with Marina's vocals, otherwise the songs might not have been anything extraordinary. Marina is the reason the album sounds so good, not just the team of producers she worked with. The lyrics are so relatable and simple yet intricate.<br /><br />10/10 for me

As soon as I started reading about Sheriff Holston I became intrigued. I felt like a kid staying up late and telling myself, \\"One more chapter, then I'm going to bed\\". Just bought part 6 for my kindle and I am ready to find out more. Thank you for this series. I will certainly be reading more of Hugh Howey's books as well as other science fiction.
1878424777|5.0|I realize this comes from the Toltec theory and philosophy but for me, it's still New Age stuff. At any rate, I read the book and absolutely loved it, so I got the audio book. The narrator reads OK but certainly gets the point across. The 4 lessons are simple but not so easy to follow, so I listen to the audio book every now and then as a reminder. Certainly one of the better self-help book out there without the BS.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I really love this puzzle. At first i didn't think i could figure it out because you can't rotate the pieces. Once you get it figured out its pretty easy and fun to do. Its alot better than the puzzles that rotate, because when you have the right pieces they magically connect.

B0011ZWMVS|5.0|For those people who question Zimmer as a romantic composer, \\"The Last Samurai\\" strickes down naysayers.  This score is one of Zimmer's finest and demonstrates his ability to score any type of movie.  I expected a Gladiator type soundtrack when the movie came out and was pleasantly suprised to see Zimmer take this score in a different direction.<br /><br />Utlizing Japanese styles and instruments, this soundtrack captivates the senses with peaceful and melancholy themes anchored by violyns and cellos.  Unlike his more recent scores, Zimmer sticks to the orchestra and avoids synthesizers.  For a movie placed in the nineteenth century, this score appropriately accompanys the film's tranquil and chaotic atmospheres.<br /><br />\\"A Way of Life\\" begins the score mixing the beautiful and slow swelling themes of the countryside while conveying a passionate sense of desperation to hold onto the past.  Zimmer shows that he can work at all speeds: from slow romantic themes to moderate and intense action cues.  Whenever I hear \\"Spectres in the Fog,\\" I feel the impending charge of an unknown enemy hidden out of sight.  It is in this track where we hear one of the best action themes that I have returned to time and time again since the soundtrack released in 2003.  The mixture of the romantic and action cues culminates with \\"The Way of the Sword\\" and the final track, \\"A Small measure of Peace.\\"  This last piece is haunting and beautiful and is the best of the score.  It demonstrates Zimmer's abilities to send chills down your spine.<br /><br />Anyone who loves Hans Zimmer, classical movie scores, or Japanese musical styles will love this soundtrack.  The legacy of Zimmer's score will outlast the movie itself which is no easy feat.
B000002GXS|5.0|This is a superb follow-up to \\"Closing Time\\". His best collections of songs by a country mile. There is so much variety here, beautiful ballads and jazz-inflected swingers. How refreshing to hear him without all the clattering and banging in the background of his later LPs. Some recent discs sound like the soundtrack of a carnival in hell. Was that the idea?
0393064476|4.0|First, I will say that I did enjoy reading this book, but was a bit disappointed to find that the actual subject of the title, i.e., Lucretius' poem concerning the nature of things, was not broached in any detail until chapter eight. Everything before that was prelude and preamble. The first seven chapters were actually a short history of the last days of classical Rome, a survey of late medieval Italian society and papal politics, and the life and motivations of the book's 'protagonist', the Tuscan scribe Poggio, who unearthed the poem in a monastery in Germany. This was all well and good. Hats off to Poggio and his ilk.<br /><br />But, I cannot say that I share the author's conclusions about Lucretius' impact on Renaissance thinking. And I certainly do not think it had a major impact on the modern world. The sad fact is that while Lucretius theories were 2000 years ahead of his time, it is we moderns who had to rediscover and validate many of his surprisingly prescient, and untested, conclusions on our own, despite fierce opposition from the Church over atomic theory and all that it implies about the nature of reality. This war of ideas is still being waged in our own country today in the form of fundagelic creationism vs. scientific inquiry. Fortunately, barring any catastrophic collapse of our civilization, we may be able to hold onto our discoveries and push back against religious opposition.<br /><br />The book's true value for me are the troubling questions it raises about the stunning might-have-beens that were denied mankind by the rise of a strange, eastern Mediterranean cult into major religion status. This being Christianity, of course. After reading this book, I couldn't help but think that Christianity was a colossal mistake. What it teaches is nothing like the world we understand today. It's triumphant, primitive view of the universe clearly set us back almost two millennia. My god, I wondered, where might we be today if Christianity hadn't become the state religion of the decaying Roman Empire in the 4th century? What if ancient scientists had seriously attempted to investigate Lucretius theories in the first century a.c.e? Would we have had flying machines by the year 500? Would the Romans have 'discovered' the New World? Would we now be a true space faring species?<br /><br />Or was it inevitable that the steep decline of the Roman Empire set us up for a thousand years of intellectual darkness and Christianity was just one of many possible outcomes? As the author points out in some detail, once the Empire dissolved so did its infrastructure. Gone were the hundreds of libraries, the literate classes, and the great book collections. Most of the accumulated knowledge of the previous thousand years were well and truly forgotten. There were very few back-up copies for us to relearn from. The good news for me is that Christianity is clearly sclerotic and increasingly irrelevant to the modern world, and like an old man who sees his best days behind him is bitter, angry, and vindictive at being ignored and even laughed at for his old fashioned views. Someday we may all see the universe as Lucretius did and we will no longer be afraid.state religion of the decaying Roman Empire in the 4th century?

He felt the sun on his shoulders, watched a kestrel on silent wings, and all the time the ball of his foot pushed his heel from the ground, and weight shifted from one leg to the other, and this was everything.\\" (144)<br /><br />Perhaps Harold Fry had been somewhat lost when he started out. But, by the end of his 500-mile pilgrimage, the distances he traveled from the points at which he had begun were immeasurable.

B00005R2IS|4.0|The movie that put Mel Gibson on the radar screen,I know it's all been said before,this is a great movie,no doubt about that,unless your ideal of a good movie is Love Story with your special someone,but before you dismiss this movie as being just a guy movie girls,let me tell you this is a love story gone bad,very bad.This is what causes Max to be Mad Max.I will also say that this movie is so good,that one of my dogs is named Max,after the character from this film.Now I don't know if you want a special edition of this movie,but I have seen the original Aussie release before,and glad I have it now on DVD.So if your a fan of Mel Gibson,but your worried about this being a low budget movie,rest assured that this is a very good low budget movie.It's not believable,but what movie really is.It's dated,but what old movie isn't.But this movie stands out from all others in this genre.Buy it.
1612183956|4.0|This is one of those novels that had me from the first page, and which kept me up until late at night to see how things would end.  And while the conclusion of the book wasn't handled as well as the rest of the story, it's still an excellent effort from the author.<br /><br />The premise is a familiar one to those who have read sci-fi, fantasy and horror.  A man wakes up with no real memory of how he ended up where he is.  As he begins to fill in some blanks, the events going on around him only lead to further confusion and more questions.  In this case, Ethan Burke wakes up beside a river severely injured, gets himself to the hospital, then spends the majority of the novel trying to unravel the mystery about himself and the town of Wayward Pines.  For the reader there are some clues early that give a pretty good idea of what's going on, but it doesn't take away from the enjoyment of seeing what Burke can figure out on his own.<br /><br />I would have given this five stars if not for the ending, which seemed weak compared to the rest of the book.  When the revelations are made at the end about what's been going on in Wayward Pines, it feels forced.  It was just disappointing given how great the rest of the novel had been.  Even with that, though, this is a great read and one I'd recommend strongly.

B00127RAJY|4.0|I am not a fitness expert but my father is (long-time semi-pro bodybuilder) so I've picked up a lot from him and do consider fitness a hobby! I've done the 30-Day Shred completely on 2 separate occasions now, so a full 60 days at the 10 days-each level recommended. I find it to be a fantastic quick workout that you can do easily in your home when you don't have much time to spare. Granted, a 150-lb woman will only burn about 160 calories each time, but that is way better than nothing! I think the Shred shows beginners a set of basic, effective exercises and it will help you improve your endurance. I also like how clear Jillian is with her directions and her reminders about proper form, which is so important when exercising so you don't strain anything. The very first time I tried the workout, I was almost crying by the time I finished Level 1. I was beyond sore for the next few days, but it was the sore of someone who hadn't worked out in awhile! It didn't take long to get to a point where I could complete the entire 20 minutes without stopping, but I'm gasping for breath after every workout. All the basics are here - squats, lunges, various weight-lifting techniques for the main muscles groups, and cardio with both high and low-level impact options. I wouldn't recommend this as your only workout routine if you are looking to get into serious shape, but it's a great starting place and will teach beginners some good basics and will help you get to the next level of physical endurance. The only thing I really don't like is how short the stretching portion at the end is - not nearly long enough to be effective. I recommend seeing how Jillian does each stretch and then hold each pose much longer than she does on the DVD.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|This is a fantastic show. I discovered it on Netflix, watched season 1, and never turned back. It's such an engaging tv show, you'll want to see what happens next at the end of every single episode.  Season 4 may be the most intense one yet. 5 stars easily for Walter White, Jesse  and Hank doing a fine job portraying their characters.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I am an avid reader and I read all genres.  This book was recommended to me by several friends.  As I began reading, I agree the scenes were pretty steamy.  However, the plot that was woven in between the bedroom scenes was more than lacking. Twilight had more character development- and that is not saying much!

B00142X56Y|4.0|This is a fine production and performance of Die Zauberflote at The Royal Opera House. Colin Davis conducts a musically secure performance which is recognisably traditional in concept. The David McVicar production is effective.<br /><br />The singing and acting throughout are all excellent features. Simon Keenlyside provides an amusing and secure Papageno and Ailish Tynan matches him with an outlandish Papagena. Dorothea Roschmann performs with the same accuracy and vigour that she showed in Harnoncourt's Tito and Damrau is unassailable as the Queen of the Night and is ably supported by her three bizarrely presented `Ladies'. Sarastro is suitably authoritative and Monostatos and his cronies are equally effective. Tamino is increasingly convincing as the production progresses.<br /><br />So far then, this is a highly recommended production. But for me there remain question marks to do with the actual recording. Because of the preponderance of dark scenes some viewers may find a problem with digital grain. This is something to consider if your viewing screen is on the larger size and greater than 40 inches for example.<br /><br />Larger screens will make the digital grain more and more apparent as screen sizes increase. The other issue concerns the very low level of recorded sound which robs the music and the performance musically of impact unless the volume is turned up at least 5-6 DB. This is a lot and will require a sufficiently powerful amplifier. This may be a matter of concern for purchasers with moderate power at their disposal.<br /><br />In summary therefore - 5 stars for the production (in all respects) but reservations for the recording quality bringing the best score I can give to just 4 stars coupled with advice to check your replay equipment's compatibility bearing in mind the above observations.at you might like to know that before I buy a recording I now look through all the reviews to see if you have posted one. Your assessments and opinions are invaluable. Thank you. (US review)<br /><br />I particularly like your format of review. They give the prospective purchaser an idea of the style of the playing and relevant comparisons. They are succinct. Keep up the good work! (UK review)<br /><br />I'm sure there are many other serious collectors, besides myself, who wait for your synopsis and opinion before spending their hard-earned money on new releases...<br />Thank you (UK review)<br /><br />I'd also add to this. When you in particular review a particular CD, I pay pretty close attention. I would say the characteristics of your reviews I value the most are the detail and general sense of balance and fairness that comes across. That's a great help. Thanks for taking the time on your reviews.  (US review)<br /><br />............................................
B0070NSPCU|4.0|This is one of the best self-published books that I've read.  In fact it is one of the better books I've read - period.  The author does a great job of world building.  The magical system seems pretty rudimentary and only vaguely defined, but the author's skillful character and plot development more than make up for this.  The ending was surprising, but the clues were definitely there if you were paying really close attention.  I've read a lot of self-published books.  Most of them are pretty horrible.  I'm happy to say that my misgivings were misplaced in this case.<br /><br />I can't wait to read the next book.

A few of the books in the series slowed down a little bit and were not quite as eventful as others, but they keep me wanting more, and I can't wait for book number six.

B000001EUN|5.0|This was my introduction to the Scorpions when I was a kid in the eighties and now, 30+ years later, it is still an amazing album. It has all of the things that make a good Scorpions album. Great, straight ahead rockers, like Make It Real, Don't Make No Promises, and Falling In Love, and slow tempo burners like The Zoo, and Animal Magnetism. And what would a Scorpions album be without a ballad, Lady Starlight. There isn't a stinker on the whole album. Their performances are classic Scorpions with excellent grooves, catchy, singable melodies, and amazing guitar work. A top notch album from a band hitting their stride that would see them come to world wide commercial success just a couple of years later with the Blackout and Love At First Sting albums and tours. If you want classic Scorpions, this is it.
B000NA28I4|1.0|I just saw the last five minutes of Eragon on TV and was instantly reminded of why I shut the DVD off after 5 minutes into the movie. The casting was terrible, the movie script was horrible and the acting was wooden. Christopher Paolini should have waited for a better funded offer before he sold the movie rights. Hopefully this is one movie they'll redo. It's a great book that deserves a much better movie.
B000UZNRS2|3.0|I bought this book to read while flying to and from my vacation.  Easy and engaging read.  Problem: unless you have read this author in the past you won't know who some of the people and groups are and why you should care when they die.  The ending was contrived--it read like I have written X number of pages, so now it's time to wrap it up so let's kill off the two remaining antagonists in next few pages.  As I said, good beach read.
145162445X|3.0|A \\"must read\\" if you are a layperson interested in the subject.<br /><br />The positives:<br /><br />1. Very readable and summarizes in breadth an enormous amount of information of what is known -- and what is not known -- about cosmology.<br /><br />2. If you like the anthropic principle, this is the book for you. The author proposes that we live in a unique sliver of time for us to be able to appreciate the nature of our universe.<br /><br />The negatives:<br /><br />1. Most of the illustrations were a bit off the mark and not really lucid.<br /><br />2. There were quite a few straw men mercilessly beaten to death.<br /><br />3. In the latter part of the book there was too much philosophizing and needless religion-bashing.<br /><br />4. The author blows his own trumpet a bit too much about his own achievements in the field.  A little bragging is OK, but I had the feeling that he was going to nominate himself for the Nobel Prize.<br /><br />5. In an Afterword, his colleague Richard Dawkins tells us that this is the most significant book since Darwin's \\"Origin of Species\\". If it is indeed, then this assessment should not originate from inside the covers of the book itself.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|Most reviewers have already put it very well: Clockwork Angels is a classic Rush album -- certainly in their top 3 or 4. Remarkably this release manages to capture the adrenalin of their peak efforts over the decades.  The music is dynamic and complex, while the production is muscular and modern.<br /><br />Lyrically, the album is an expansion of the steampunk motif that Mr. Peart has been exploring for a couple of years. The clockwork universe metaphor is used to explore themes of individuality, loneliness, existence, and love, which in turn reflect a \\"bleeding heart libertarian\\" worldview (Mr. Peart's self description). The upcoming companion novel of the same name by Kevin Anderson should be a great treat for fans of Science Fiction or Rush.<br /><br />As the band's cultural stock has risen in recent years, much has been said or written about the glaring omission of Rush from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Sadly, politics (literally) has much more to do with this omission than most people realize.<br /><br />Mr. Peart, (although he has consistently said he is \\"no one's blind follower\\") initially raised the ire of some reviewers by acknowledging the widely read libertarian writer, Ayn Rand, in the liner notes to Rush's fourth album, 2112.  Mr. Peart is also known for not following the politically correct rock star/celebrity model (e.g. avoiding Hollywood fundraisers for the DNC, and generally eschewing the modern publicist's rules of the game).<br /><br />Jann Wenner, Rolling Stone's founder (and well known fundraiser for the Democratic Party) is, of course, an ardent leftist progressive.  He is also a huge player in the machinery of the modern celebrity.  Ayn Rand, although reviled by many on the Right for her libertarian social views and position in opposition to organized religion, is also criticized from the Left for her focus on individualism and free market principles. She was, in fact, against collectivism and redistributionism, which places her in directopposition to a large segment of the current Democratic Party.<br /><br />Although Ms. Rand was a Jewish immigrant, anti-fascist, anti-totalitarian, and very libertarian regarding individual freedoms, she - and by association, the band - were demonized by the professional Left for being insufficiently politically correct.<br /><br />Some 2112 reviewers in both England and the U.S., initiated attacks against Rush which went so far as to refer to the band as somehow \\"fascist\\".  The incredible irony of the attacks willfully ignored Geddy Lee's and Alex Lifeson's family histories in Nazi and Eastern European prison camps, as well as Rand's own terrible childhood under the maelstrom of Russian totalitarianism.  Nonetheless, there began a libelous assault against the band.<br /><br />The band's understandable reaction was to avoid the press altogether.<br /><br />Fortunately, as original Rush fans have gotten older and attained positions of leadership and influence, there has also developed a new generation of Rush fans who ignore the politically correct attacks, and simply discover the band on their own terms. Rush today is flourishing and succeeding beyond the wildest expectation of even their most ardent original fans.<br /><br />Rolling Stone, unable to ignore either the massive growing popularity of the band over multiple decades, or the overwhelming praise from the non political music press, has very noticeably begun to give the band more favorable notices.  Although some in the traditional rock press continue to give the band backhanded compliments; most reviewers today praise the band as \\"virtuoso\\", \\"iconic\\", or \\"legendary.\\"<br /><br />Furthermore, while Jann Wenner and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame have become somewhat anachronistic, Rush keep touring, writing and playing by their own rules-- all the while appealing to aspiring musicians and free thinkers over multiple generations.

It's my fav because in this episode we get to see a different more sweet and caring side of Klaus, and it's always cute to see the bad guy show some love. And I love the music they picked for this episode(Give Me Love-Ed Sheeran) but TVD always has great music for their episodes, it always fits so perfectly

The story of how they became vampires is very clear,easy to understand and it all makes sense, whoever the writer is, did an excellent job. If vampires were real the story they made up for this episode seems like a great fit. Most vampire movies/shows never explain where vampires came from...but really good episode

B005LW5J9O|3.0|The Kindle version of the book contains photo credits, but no photos. Otherwise, an interesting, and rambling, discussion of De rerum natura, its rediscovery and supposed consequences.  The author is the scholar, not me, but it is hard to believe that the renaissance, the enlightenment, Thomas Jefferson and modern science are all so dependent on this poem.
0345529057|4.0|After reading all of the reviews regarding quality of this set I almost did not purchase it. After reading all four books I was pleasantly surprised that no pages fell out, the binding was fine, and I had an easy reading experience. The only small complaint that I have is that some of the pages were printed a bit crooked. Other than that I feel like I got a great deal on this set! I originally went to Barnes and Noble and they wanted to charge me almost double what I paid on Amazon. Buy with confidence!
1594744769|4.0|The inspiration for \\"Miss Peregrine's Home For Peculiar Children\\" was a collection of bizarre vintage photographs, which Ransom Riggs intended to publish as an anthology of strange images for children. He was persuaded that rather than just present the images with brief notes, he should construct a story that connected them all in some way and use the photographs to illustrate it. The result is this d&eacute;but novel which is both beguiling and disturbing -- a haunting story that puts me very much in mind of Robert Holdstock's \\"[[ASIN:0586065857 Mythago Wood]]\\" in its brooding penetration of the everyday world with mythical and fairy-tale elements, and the interlinking of the world of mythology with that of obsession, madness and insanity.<br /><br />The story is, in the most part, expertly constructed and well written, and progresses at a pace that never slackens but which equally never feels rushed. Mysteries are invoked and revealed in a way that neither frustrates nor annoys, and while there are several pointers to allow faster readers to work much out for themselves, there remain plenty of surprises along the way, making the story suitable for readers of almost any age, from teens upward. If I do have a criticism of the book it is that the author's research into Britain would appear to have been extremely minimal and his setting of Cairnholm as a remote island off the cost of Wales is far from convincing --- seeming much a cross between Cornwall and either Scotland or Ireland than Wales to my mind -- there being nothing remotely Welsh about the villagers who populate it, or indeed about the eponymous children gathered there, whose modes of speech and vocabulary are both more transatlantic and more modern than one would expect of children in Wales in the 1930s.  Such slips can easily be overlooked, however, and no doubt will hardly impinge on the consciousness of most readers.<br /><br />While the story is lively and engaging it is undoubtedly the photographs which make this book unique. Almost any of them on their own would probably provide enough material for a complete story; with over 40 of them interspersed throughout the whole book, the effect is at once overwhelming and astounding. Each is itself faintly disturbing; the collection is powerful enough to suck you into Ransom Riggs' world of peculiar happenings and never allow you to leave.  Inclusion of some of the images into the narrative flow feels a little contrived at times, but overall the effect is a positive tour-de-force.  Do be warned, though, that the story of Miss Peregrine's wards does not end here - a sequel is in preparation and is due in Spring 2013; let us hope that the photographs used for that are equally weird.  Not surprisingly, the film rights have also been snapped up.ake this book unique.

B005G5PPGS|3.0|Started off brilliantly but I felt it seriously tailed off in the middle and only slightly recovered by the end. I think I just expected a bit more. Definitely worth a read though if you are a sports fan.
0307887448|3.0|2044. The climate is wrecked, oil resources have been depleted and the world economy has still not fully recovered from the excesses of the turn of the century. Wade Watts, like millions of other teenagers, escapes the real world by playing in the OASIS, a computer programme that has combined the old Internet and numerous MMORPGs into a virtual reality existence. Five years ago the founder of the OASIS died, leaving his multi-billion-dollar fortune to whoever can solve an elaborate puzzle he left behind in the game. Millions have tried and failed...until Wade stumbles across a key clue. Suddenly a race is on: Wade and several fellow gamers competing with one another and a sinister corporation to be the first to win the prize.<br /><br />Ready Player One is the debut novel by writer Ernest Cline, whose previous genre credit of note was co-writing the 2009 movie Fanboys. Ready Player One, like that movie, is a geek-centric, nostalgia-heavy paean for the past. In this case, Cline references early video games, 'classic' movies of the 1980s and various TV shows and bands as he creates a cultural landscape which Wade must delve into to solve the puzzles left for him and millions of fellow gamers.<br /><br />The book is mostly set within the OASIS, with the world outside described fairly perfunctorily. There are allusions to ecological catastrophe, peak oil, climate change and the breakdown of society, but these elements are not developed very far at all. Within the OASIS things are more engaging, with Cline creating worlds dedicated entirely to 1980s video games or to fantastical environments where the rules of nature are twisted. It's basically Second Life meets Tad Williams's Otherworld with a dash of EVE Online and World of WarCraft on top and is described vividly and energetically. However, the creations are usually built on cultural references with Cline contributing little that is original.<br /><br />This is Ready Player One's key weakness. The book is a nostalgia-fest, a romp through 1980s video arcades, ancient home consoles, old-skool Dungeons and Dragons campaigns and repeated viewings of movies like Ladyhawke and WarGames. For those who get the references, it's great fun. For those who don't, the book struggles a little. Being born seven years after Cline (and the creator of the OASIS in the book), I got a lot of the references but others, particularly to the very earliest days of home gaming, were unfamiliar. Cline, to his credit, does try to explain each reference in as concise a manner as possible, but this has a tendency to slow down the narrative whilst not necessarily helping very much (my visual imagining of Joust was very different to the reality of the game when I finally looked it up online).<br /><br />The characters are straightforward archetypes, veering very little away from the standard. Main character Wade is an awkward, non-confident nerd living with an unsympathetic extended family and being irrationally blamed for their misfortunes (when we get a glimpse of Wade's home life I was half-expecting him to be sleeping a small cupboard, Potter-style). Cline shows a rare burst of imagination in suggesting that in the future, trailer parks will be overcrowded to the point of having trailers stacked on top of one another with supporting framework and these will sometimes collapse, to no-one's particular interest. The other characters are likewise standard: Art3mis is the cute-but-determined geek girl, Aech is the loyal best friend and two supporting Japanese characters are awesome with swords and much-concerned with honour, which is an unfortunate stereotype. There are a few surprises given that we only know these characters through their online avatars and their 'true' selves turn out to be rather different, but again there are few real surprises here. The villains are, well, snarling caricatures of evil whose motivations are unconvincing and whose chief representative, Sorrento, is a laughable cartoon character at best.<br /><br />So, we have a book which contributes little of its own to the genre, competently-executed protagonists and awful antagonists. Normally this would be enough to consign a book to the mediocre pile, but Ready Player One still manages to rise above this. Cline's narrative has pace, verve and energy. His ideas are standard but they are handled well, and some of Wade's less laudable activities raise issues about how healthy it is to live your life online or in computer games. Cline is celebrating nostalgia but certainly not advocating dedicating your life to it. The determination of some characters to 'change the world' with the prize money whilst others dream of building a spaceship and escaping also opens an interesting debate about maturity and dealing with consequences rather than running away from them.<br /><br />Plus, the book is so much damned fun. There's spaceship and mecha fights within the OASIS, antimatter bombings, a puzzle based around the D&D module Tomb of Horrors, a 3D recreation of Monty Python and the Holy Grail and laughs than you can shake a stick at. At one point, as he ascends the levels and achievements of the game, Wade chooses as his vehicle the DeLorean from Back to the Future with a Knight Rider-style front grill and Ghostbusters logos on the side. Whether you find that amusing, eye-rollingly inane or merely unimportant will determine how likely you are to enjoy the whole book, but certainly, as a child of the 1980s, I found it fairly entertaining.<br /><br />Ready Player One (***½) makes up for deficiencies in characterisation and originality with its fast-moving plot and engaging cultural references. The novel is available now in the UK and USA. A film version is in development.

B0079UVRNI|3.0|In contrast to the gold disc of Sweet Baby James, this release sounds kind of average -- I'm sure the balances are all there and the textures, but it's just not as impressive a listening experience as the audiophile CD of the earlier album. I don't mind owning it -- it's a fine album, and a very special one -- but it's no revelation, just a nice solid job on a nice solid album, but not that much better than what we've known in the listening for 40 years.

It's not that Susan Cain's research revealed surprising data; rather, it was comforting to hear that other people fit into patterns that I identify with so strongly, so it can't just be that there's something wrong with me. I've always thought I was inferior for not fitting in with typical crowds, but Susan offers a way of looking at the world that says introverts are no better or worse than their extroverted peers despite their differences.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I got this when it was on sale for 3.99! What an amazing read I loved it from start to finish. I feel in love with Travis and Abby. The chemistry between Abby and Travis is enough to drive you crazy. I had a hard time putting this book down. I finished this book in one day. If you like other books in this genre you will love this book.
B00005NUZM|5.0|If you like to dance, you'll love this cd! I know I do!<br /><br />I've been a Michael Jackson fan for a long time, but Off the Wall came out before I was born, and although I had heard it when I was young (on my parent's record player), it had been quite a while. I recently bought the cd and - Wooo! I have enjoyed it!! Workin' Day and Night, Get on the Floor, Off the Wall, and especially Burn This Disco Out, have been playing so much at my house. Burn This Disco Out has to be the best dance song evah!<br /><br />I enjoyed hearing the Quincy Jones interviews, and loved the demos of Michael Jackson with his sibings helping him out. I like getting a peak into how it all came together.
B001NHNG64|3.0|This is my fourth Reacher book and have to say this is the worst I've read.  I can't go into too much detail not wanting to be a spoiler, but the plot is way far fetched.  It just didn't have an epic climb in action really.  Jack is still awesome and you do learn a thing or two about his past, but the book is too focused on other characters and not enough on Jack.  The enemy was weak.  The plot was weak.  If This was the first Reacher book I read I would've never picked up another one again.  It's worth the read if you plan on reading all the books in order...but other than that I wouldn't bother.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app! it is great for doing family Bible studies. I would recommend it to others! Also keeps you on track with great reminders
1603427244|5.0|Just wow. What is contained in this book is outstanding. What more could you possibly want. It has every cast on and bind off, you could ever want or need.<br />The written instructions are easy to follow yet extensive. The photos are clear and precise.<br />Perfect for the beginner, yet the experienced knitter will find a wealth of worthwhile information here as well.<br />A must have for any knitter's bookshelf.<br />I will be recommending to everyone, and get many as gifts to give as well.<br />You will enjoy.
B005LAII08|5.0|My 5 year old daughter and I loved this movie.  The characters were well written and as usual, Disney is great about adding some adult humor to keep it interesting.  One word of caution - I was glad that I did not bring my younger daughter, as I believe some of the bear attack scenes may be scary for children under 4.

B000I2MRHE|1.0|The first thing you'd think of when making something like this for infants/toddlers would be safety, right? Guess not.<br /><br />We laid this thing on a flat hardwood floor and our son couldn't get traction since the cloth slipped all over the floor. So we moved the thing onto a carpet. One of the first red flags that popped into my head when seeing this thing was that you just lay the spinner on top of the cloth; there's no anchor system for the apparatus like in other explore mat-systems where the hard plastic is anchored under the cloth.<br /><br />Well, the red flag was unfortunately justified. On a flat surface, our 4 month-old son still had the misfortune to tilt his body in a way that lifted the spinner up and it then came down on his fingers. Now, I want you to imagine the entirety of your body weight coming down with hard plastic edges on your fingers. Doesn't sound very forgiving pain-wise, does it? We didn't even know what was going on as we'd never heard him cry or scream like that before.<br /><br />Now we're sitting here with a screaming kid and wondering if we should take him to the doc since he goes back to screaming a minute after waking up.<br /><br />Sad thing is that I think he'd really be into this thing but if you can't bother to engineer a product that's marketed towards developing infants but doesn't prevent something like this happening to an infant, then you get 1 star from me. Yeah, it was also bad luck, but that's what preventative engineering is for.
B00020HCH2|5.0|Bruno Walter was esteemed for his conducting of Brahms. Walter recorded a stereo Brahms cycle in 1959 - 1960 which is rightly regarded as a string of pearls in the classical music catalog. This monaural cycle was for the most part recorded six years prior to the stereo cycle (No. 4 was recorded in 1951). Comparisons between the two cycles are inevitable, so...  What might be a clichéd expectation turns out to be true in these recordings: the earlier performances tend to be fleeter than the stereo set. Almost every movement in this monaural set is shorter than in the stereo set (the fourth movement of Symphony No. 2 is almost a minute-and-a-half shorter).  The sound in this set is clear, clean and warm (the last quality probably owing to the recordings having been done in Carnegie Hall), although on the distant side. The digital remastering has produced a noise-free listening experience. The stereo set has a more spacious atmosphere, with more dynamic &#34;thrust.&#34; The Columbia producer of the stereo cycle, John McClure, favored a bright sound which can verge on the edgy as dynamic levels rise. Dynamic levels are kept more in check in the monaural set, which can be considered as more pleasant or as frustrating, depending on taste. There is a mellow, lightly patinated quality to the sound of the monaural set, with the orchestral details shining through.  For the stereo cycle, Columbia accommodated the octogenarian Walter, who had basically retired a few years earlier, by doing all the recording in Los Angeles, where Walter had settled in the late 1930s. This necessitated the forming of a West Coast edition of the Columbia Symphony Orchestra, i.e., an ad hoc assemblage of freelance musicians. The composition of this ensemble is by now the subject of speculation and legend. The All Music Guide states: &#34;This group was an ensemble of 50 to 70 members, assembled from the best freelance musicians on the West Coast, many of whom typically never took on orchestral work, but made the exception to work with Bruno Walter.&#34; Does the phrase &#34;many of whom typically never took on orchestral work&#34; give the reader pause? This cycle was recorded with the New York Philharmonic, all of whom were thoroughly experienced in orchestral work at a high level.  The Columbia Symphony Orchestra for the most part played very well for Walter; The New York Philharmonic for the most part played beautifully for Walter. Walter had a long-standing and deep relationship with the NYP, going back to his first visits to America in the 1920s, and continuing into the 1950s. Walter was Musical Advisor to the Philharmonic, a sort of bridge between the Music Directorships of Artur Rodzinski and Dmitri Mitropoulos. (Walter wisely avoided the searing spotlight that came with being the NYP Music Director, having seen John Barbirolli abraded in the post, and then Rodzinski resigning after only four seasons, despite their achieving artistic distinction directing the orchestra.) The upshot is that the ensemble work on these recordings is generally tighter, many details are more sensitively performed, and the overall orchestral sound is fuller and better balanced than in the later stereo cycle. Listen to the last two minutes of the first movement of Symphony No. 1, for instance. While the Columbia Symphony Orchestra sounds lovely in this passage, the NYP plays it with even more finesse. There is a sense of the orchestra breathing as one with the conductor, beautifully conveying the subtle tensions of the music.  This set may not be a first choice because of the monaural sound, but it should be high on the list for anyone looking for another Brahms cycle.
1606995359|5.0|This is the first of FBI's hardcover reprints of Carl Barks's Duck stories that focuses on Uncle Scrooge.  Overall, its actually the 12th volume.  This one reprints the first 6 issues of Dell's \\"Uncle Scrooge\\" comic (actually \\"Four Color Comics\\" #386, 456 and 495 and \\"Uncle Scrooge\\" #4-6.  The 3 \\"Four Color\\"/\\"One Shots\\" were counted as \\"Uncle Scrooge\\" #1-3).<br /><br />Growing up I read many Walt Disney Comics.  One of my main sources was the great \\"Walt Disney Comics Digest\\" put out by Gold Key Comics/Western Publications.  I liked many of the comics they reprinted, but among the best were the \\"duck stories\\", especially the longer Donald Duck and Uncle Scrooge adventures, by Carl Barks.  (like many, I wouldn't learn who he was until years later).<br /><br />There have been many attempts at reprinting this material.  The most recently was the softcover volumes by Gladstone comics of Donald Duck and Uncle Scrooge stuff (include Gyro Gearloose).  I have several of them, but not all.<br /><br />I figured what with all the Duck stuff I'd read, that I would be familiar with most of the stuff, atleast the longer stories.  Not so.  While the short 1-3 page stories were new, even some of the longer stories I had not read before.  Also, it seems some elements of Uncle Scrooge stories hadn't yet bet set down.  The longer stories (32 pages) in this volume are:<br /><br />FC #386- \\"Only a Poor Old Man\\".  Here, Scrooge's Money Bin is showed as being located within downtown Duckburg (not yet up on 'Kilmotor Hill'), allowing the Beagle Brothers to buy the empty lot next down and build next to bin in a bid to cut into it and steal the money.  But Scrooge has outwitted them in moving his money.  But did he?<br /><br />FC #456- \\"Back to the Klondike\\".  This is the restored version that puts back some panels removed when it was first published.  Here, we learn about Scrooge's past as a Klondike prospector, and his first encounter with Glittering Goldie, Uncle Scrooge's lost love.  Oneof the powerful U$ stories.<br /><br />FC #495- \\"The Horseradish Story\\".  A lesser known story that gives info on one of Scrooge's ancestors and Scrooge dealing with a shyster lawyer trying to rob him of his wealth.<br /><br />US #4- \\"The Menehune Mystery\\".  A new story for me (don't recall every reading it!!).  Here, Scrooge tries to move his money in secret to an island hideout, but is outwitted by the Beagle Boys.  But Scrooge and family are helped by a group of fairies!<br /><br />US #5- \\"The Secret of Atlantis\\".  An interesting story that touches on Atlantis.  Scrooge tries to corner the coin market on a certain coin by rounding them all up but one, and dumping them in the Atlantic.  But when he destroys that one, he has to find another by diving in the Atlantic.<br /><br />US #6- \\"Tralla La\\".  Another classic story has Scrooge trying to relay in a \\"Shangra la\\" type world, but ruining it by the appearance of a bottle cap!<br /><br />There are 2 10 page stories.  The first has Scrooge replacing his money bin with a round, water-tower like affair after converting all his money to greenbacks, with the Beagle Boys trying again to steal it all.  His \\"#1 Dime\\" comes in handy, the first appearance of this item.<br /><br />The second 10 pager has US trick Donald and his neighbor Mr. Jones to tear up their garden and homes in search of a nonexistant treasure (so he can buy their land cheap).  But Hewey, Dewey, and Louise fix things.<br /><br />What is interesting in several of these stories is that Scrooge has no problem with converting his money (to all coins or all greenbacks, etc).  In later stories, the actual money in the bin is important to Scrooge, being the actual money he earned around the world, and would spur on stories from his past as he would pick up a certain coin and recall how he earned it.<br /><br />A change from the previous volume is they aren't organizing the stories by length, but by publication.  Which is more logical.<br /><br />Rounding out the volume is an intro by George Lucas, and material at the end giving a short bio on Barks (a much longer one is in the 'first' volume), and explanation of the 32 and 10 page stories, and a listing of the original comics (now they are consistent in calling the \\"One Shots\\" \\"Four Color\\", but noting the other term, which they failed to do in the first volume.<br /><br />I look forward to the next volumes!!

034580404X|4.0|I read all three books in five days. This is the first book, much less BOOKS I have ever read that fast. I raced through them because I couldn't stop reading them - but now that I am done, I am disappointed there's nothing more to read. I may read them again. As one story, I loved it. If you've heard anything about the series - you know there is A LOT of really graphic sex. You've also probably heard the seemingly ridiculous premise: that a 27 year old gorgeous billionaire with a very active and deviant sex life would be captivated by a 21 year old clumsy virgin. But if you can accept that at face value at first - it is explained by the end of the last book, and I think in a way that is at least plausible. Maybe.<br /><br />As three separate books, I found the first to be enjoyable enough to turn the pages quickly, but also terribly disturbing - I could only really skim the \\"rules\\" as reading them through was upsetting to think entirely through. Most of the first book is sex and Ana over analyzing every thing that happens to her or is said to her and it's a bit annoying - though, if I'm honest - real. I'm a woman, and I obsess about men. If the man was some totally hot hot shot bachelor, even more so. And it's titillating to be sure. I found the ending to be so completely unsatisfying that I had to read the second book. Though the title is Fifty Shades Darker, that is really more of a reference to how much you learn about Christian Grey's back story then it is about the actual content of the book. I thought that the first book was by far the most disturbing. I loved that there was more plot and while the plot is downright preposterous, I accepted it and enjoyed it anyway. I enjoyed the third book the most, perhaps because I'm a romantic and I enjoyed that it was more a love story than anything else at that point. Much is finally learned about the characters, and for me, it was a deeply satisfying book. I did find that the end was rushed - while much of the earlier books recall each hour minute by minute, years are skipped ahead in the final two chapters. I found it particularly amusing that a scene from the first book (written from Ana's perspective, as is the entire series) is rewritten from Christian's perspective as the final chapter. Just when you fell in love with him, he was a scoundrel all over again.<br /><br />Ultimately, the idea of an alpha male falling for an innocent girl isn't terribly original, nor is the idea of a woman being able to heal a deeply damaged man, but the book's popularity confirms that obviously these two ideas are in many women's fantasies. I have read much about how it is poorly written - but ultimately, I wanted to turn every page, and isn't that ultimately the point? It's by no means timeless literature, but it was an enjoyable read for me.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|Each season gets just that much better!!  Every time characters get killed off, they come up with others that are even more fascinating.  The two best episodes are \\"Salud\\" & \\"Face Off\\".  Having the DVD set means I own the videos & can play them at will.  The plot twists in this series are phenomenal!!
B0076XIS4O|5.0|This just goes to show that downloading all of the free songs offered by amazon is the way to go. After getting Genesis for free a couple months ago I ended up getting everything else by Grimes. Like everyone else has said before, it is the quality of her voice and not the lyrics that makes her music so mesmerizing. Highly recommended for those who want an unique aural experience.<br /><br />This album is my absolute favorite of the whole year. Rarely can I put a whole album on repeat without regretting one or two particular songs. I even made my library buy the album and every time I check on it's status (it is my baby and I want it to be loved) it is always checked out.

B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a pretty fun game. Starts off easy and gradually gets harder. There are lots of levels. Only reason I do not give it 5 stars is because there is no app Icon. It just shows a small white rectangle that says &quot;No image available&quot;.
B0076L9W9Q|5.0|I am a 40-something long-time rock fan who used to get very excited when my favorite bands put out new albums and also enjoyed discovering new exciting bands.  Life often gets in the way of that over time for those of us who go the marriage, kids, etc., route.  However, I did have the fortune of discovering Halestorm a couple of years back simply by hearing one of their singles on the radio.  I love that first album by them and would give it a five-star review if I ever get around to writing a review for that album.  That being said, this latest album from them ranks even higher in my book.  This album completely rocked my world from the first time I heard it--surprising me with its biting heaviness and attitude.<br /><br />What can you say about an album that starts off with songs like \\"Love Bites (So Do I)\\" and \\"Mz. Hyde\\"?  That is simply attitude that can't be faked.  Hard riffs and words laced with attitude.  \\"I Miss the Misery\\" and \\"Freak Like Me\\" continued the frenzied pace, and then surprisingly three ballads in a row come up.  All I can say is that each of them--\\"Beautiful\\", \\"In Your Room\\", and \\"Break\\"--are unique and different in their own right.  All are absolute winners.  From there, you ease back into the insane pace of this album with a commercial rocker \\"Rock Show\\"--a fun and catchy track.  Then the insanity kicks back in with biting tracks \\"Daughters of Darkness\\" and \\"You Call Me a Bitch Like It's a Bad Thing\\".  Yes, those songs are every bit as edgy as the titles make them sound.  Again, I was floored when I first heard these tracks.  Finally comes the epic closer \\"Here's To Us\\"--a gem of a ballad that none the less is laced with curse words.  What an ending to an absolutely amazing ride of an album.<br /><br />I cannot tout this album enough for those who like attitude-laced, female-fronted melodic hard rock that combines old school and modern elements.  I can't play most of this album around my kids who are each under age 10, but when on my own orwith fellow rocker adults I play this album into the ground.  Highly recommended.
B0055SWM08|5.0|this is the best game ever. The sound is great everything about this game I love and I hope you like or love it too.
B0071WQ7WU|5.0|My rock roots go strongly back to the 1970s and '80s, but I still like to look for favorable rock music in the modern day when time permits.  Shinedown is one of those bands that has come out in the past decade that I always anticipate new music from.  While it may have taken them four years to get new material out since the epic \\"The Sound of Madness\\", it has absolutely been worth the wait.  This album is everything I like to hear in a modern day album--walls of guitars, melodies, powerful singing, and variety of tempos.  Shinedown accomplishes all of that in this latest epic album.  From monster tracks like the opener \\"Adrenaline\\" to beautiful heartfelt power ballads like \\"Unity\\", the quality is there.  Just about every track has energy, attitude, and passion.<br /><br />As a parent, I enjoy listening to appropriate rock music with my young kids.  On this album, \\"Nowhere Kids\\" (track 7) and \\"My Name\\" (track 11) should probably be skipped with the kids around due to a bit of language--although they are killer tracks that I otherwise recommend.  To these ears, in fact, there is not a dud on this album.<br /><br />I highly recommend this album to rock fans of various generations.  I enjoy this album with both my thirty-something wife and my teenage nephew.  Excellent, rocking album from beginning to end from a band that has truly hit their stride.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This is a book that changes your life, mind set, and how you love. This a book that I would buy as gifts and re-read myself. I must say Thank you Adam Brown for everything.
B005ELZKWS|5.0|I'll stay out of the debate about this album vs. the new Van Halen album.  I love them both in different ways and am glad to have them both added to my 800-plus album collection this year.  I'll instead compare this album to the first Chickenfoot album.  Both albums are excellent in my opinion, but they are a bit different.  The first Chickenfoot album was very good but not quite what I expected from them at that time.  It was full of grooves and some left-of-center sounds and songs.  This second album sounds like what I would have expected on a first album by them.  The tracks are a little looser, more straight ahead, and probably a bit more mainstream sounding. (Note that coming from me, \\"mainstream\\" isn't always an insult--I'm not one of those snobby, anti-mainstream music listeners.)<br /><br />Regarding this album, Joe's guitar and Sammy's voice really come together in these songs.  A good example of that is the third track \\"A Different Devil\\".  This is that certain type of rock anthem that the debut didn't have--I love the melodies of this track.  The opening track \\"Last Temptation\\" has a bit of that first album groove--a very solid track.  \\"Come Closer\\" at track six is that epic melodic ballad that the first album didn't have--what a marvelous and heartfelt track.  Right after that at track seven comes a searing rocker bemoaning the financial plight of many in today's world--a song totally out of left field but that to me feels heartfelt and really works.  I also enjoy the slamming blues riffs in \\"Up Next\\" and the haunting ballad closing song \\"Something's Going Wrong\\".<br /><br />These guys, all masters in their crafts, really sound like a cohesive group--not by any means some thrown-together project or supergroup.  Seeing them in concert a couple months back (without Chad Smith, who is of course on tour  with the Red Hot Chili Peppers), further showcased their cohesiveness to me.  Sammy Hagar will be 65 this year but still sounds great and shows little signof slowing down or hanging it up.  Michael Anthony can still play that bass and still provides awesome harmonic vocals both on recording and in person.  And what can you say about Joe Satrianni?  I obviously know what a legendary guitarist he is but was even more impressed after finally getting to see him live.  He shreads in concert, and I also love his playing on this album--I disagree with those who have called it too restrained for him.  I hope these guys keep touring and put out at least another album or two.  For sure this album is absolutely worth a listen, particularly if you like that legendary lead singer and lead guitarist.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|this is a great knife/tool. I said &#34;tool&#34; because it's not your average knife. This is a 1/4&#34; slab of steel and weights 1 pound without the sheath. It's not only a knife can be used as a mini-hatchet or a prybar if needed. that's why it's called &#34;campanion&#34;. People who gave this knife negative reviews don't understand the purpose of it and didn't use logic when buying it.  It obviously isn't going to cut as well as some other thinner knives. You can't have a quarter pound thick blade and expect it to slice and cut as well as high grade chef's knife. however this knife is like the multi-tool of knives. It can do a lot of things but none of them really well but good enough to get the job done. The scales are pretty good and very ergonomic. The sheath is molded plastic. Very sold knife made in the USA for not a lot of money.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Oh this one is bad!!! Why oh why did I cave in and purchase Fifty Shades? I'm about half way through and I just can't finish this book. Fifty Shades makes Breaking Dawn seem good now, ok not really but I never thought I'd read another book as bad as Breaking Dawn....uggghhhh. Horribly written with awful characters...how on earth did this ever get popular. Nothing wrong with reading a fluff book with erotica in it but this one is garbage! There isn't much more I can add to all the other 1 star reviews...they all sum it up pretty well about how I feel about Fifty Shades....Don't waste your time or money on this one. If you must read it borrow it from someone...you've been warned.

B007KUFDBY|4.0|Hopefully someday, when they make a sequel to the excellent documentary to Waking Sleeping Beauty (Waking Pocahontas maybe?), we'll see how Treasure Planet figured into the behind-the-scenes nachinations of the post-Katzenberg Disney animation division. One can't help but wonder whether Treasure Planet fell victim to some of these politics, or, as perhsps it was with John Carter, the public just didn't want a scifi/space version of Treasure Island.<br /><br />The film itself is jaw-droppingly impressive. Few films from any studio have blended cel animation with CG as perfectly, created such vivid, vulnerable characters and such breathtaking, detailed panoramas. Seeing it on the new Blu-ray is almost like seeing it for the first time, unless perhaps you saw it in IMAX. Every line and every miniscule object or person in the distance can be seen in razor sharp clarity.<br /><br />Maybe the visual scope and tech detail overwhelms the characters and the narrative, as some suggested was the case with Sleeping Beauty. However, there's some superb acting here, including the now-A lister Joseph-Gordon Levitt as Jim Hawkins, Brian Murray as Silver, Martin Short as BEN, Emma Thompson as Captain Amelia and the always dependable David Hyde-Pierce as Doppler (a character that suggests those Duckburg \\"dog people\\" from vintage Disney comics).<br /><br />The generous bonus features, pretty much the same ones from the earlier DVD release, are very copious. Instead of an audio commentary, there is a vast \\"Visual Commentary\\" that starts and stops the film with supplemental information, stretching the experience out well over two hours. A feast for animation fans.<br /><br />My son loved this movie when he was seven and he loves it today. It was an attempt to grab the non-Princess audience for Disney features, and while it would never attract the \\"Hot Tub Time Machine\\" older males, it's great stuff for younger kids.<br /><br />Be sure to show your kids Walt Disney's original Treasure Island to compare and contrast the storyline. The relationship between Silver and Hawkins is more from Walt and less from Stevenson. And hey, reading the classic book is nice, too!land to compare and contrast the storyline. The relationship between Silver and Hawkins is more from Walt and less from Stevenson. And hey, reading the classic book is nice, too!

1451608659|5.0|I enjoyed this book and actually liked the way stories of Jennifer were mixed in.  Dominique's life in gymnastics was at times sad and her coaches disturbing.  The joy of finding Jen was a needed release throughout the book.  I've watched gymnastics closely on TV since I was a kid and in high school when Mary Lou won gold.  I don't want to believe some of the things Dominique speaks of in her family life and training and yet, know I must.  Dominique is amazing and talented and the book is great.  Kudos to her for telling her store and for being the champion she is.
B004SIP9P6|3.0|My fiance is a Scream buff so I got this for her. The movie is enjoyable to watch and it came in good condition and on time.
B00633W614|4.0|Jeffrey Archer is such a good writer, i could read almost anything he writes.  this was not as good as the first volume but i still will wait for the 3rd.
B000U0F7RG|2.0|The entire collection came in good condition besides one disc which was unplayable so that was disappointing. Other than that everything else was fine. I do not recommend this product if you want your collection to be complete.
B004T6IBNY|5.0|Tho game is by far the best pinball game I own. It was especially good on a road trip I took. This game is also a great bourdom buster!!
B00881VLCE|5.0|If u like puzzles this game is awesome. And u can add themes to your game. Honestly my 2 boys get hooked on it and before u know it.... an hour has gone by
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I enjoy playing this, as well as the color version in the evenings to unwind from the day. I also suffer from chronic pain, concentrating on games such as these help me focus elsewhere. I play on a kindle fire which can be a tad small,but it adds to the fun of the game for me. :)<br />  I have had no problem with download, force close or any other type of glytches. An app I highly recommend!
B0055S348W|5.0|I bought this software for my wife's Kindle Fire. The install was simple, it immediately recognized our printer and it prints well.<br />This software simply works and seems to be stable.  In my opinion it is well worth the price.
0062060562|3.0|I enjoy noticing the subtle differences in \\"The King's English\\" as written/spoken in the UK and the \\"English\\" written/spoken in the US.  Therefore, I was a little distracted by the dialogue, which left me having to remind myself that the setting of the book was London, rather than somewhere in the USA.  I suspect that the author is an American living in London. Probably most readers wouldn't be bothered at all by this.<br /><br />I did find this book entertaining and didn't want to put it down, which I pretty much didn't until I reached the last page.
159514188X|5.0|I have shared this book with almost everyone I know. I got this book January 2012 and every time I read it I cannot put it down ( so far I have read it about 5 or 6 times). It really was nothing like what I thought it would be but in a good way. Too often this topic gets pushed aside and danced around. The Story was extrememly compelling.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I think the book was very well written and the plot was fantastic. When I first read the book I loved it and I loved it so much that I read it 4 more times the situations in the book were very relatiable and made it seem you were the character. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a love story this is the book for you.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I have the game for Nintendo DS as well and it's definitely worth the download. There's a ton of variety. So in just a few seconds you can go from shooter to classic to puzzle. The pace is nice because it's completely doable to unlock all of the games without spending any real money, I really appreciate that in sn app.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love it.  Comes in handy when I don't have a calculator or my computer handy!  I would recommend this application for everyone. my 12yr son downloaded and he loves it too.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It's been a while since I've read a book I couldn't put down. I thought about it all day while I was doing other things and couldn't wait until it was my daughter's nap time to finally get those precious few hours to read it again!<br /><br />This book takes a look at a future that is all too possible for our planet. It's a story of what's left of the human race after some kind of disaster. Mixed in with the story of these survivors is a love story, a mystery and action adventure. It's everything you could want all rolled into one. I highly recommend it!
B007DIQC90|5.0|Music like this is the reason God gave us ears. This band is a gentle reminder of the beauty that can be found in something as simple and yet as complex as sound.    EDIT: or....maybe two sentences.
B004W7OQMA|5.0|This pertains to the vinyl version of this album.The CD is a good sounding disc,but the vinyl is better again.There is minimal surface noise and the sound quality is captivating.Try Limit To Your Love for a system test.The bass pedal on this track will wake up the most jaded listener.Overall it is strongly recommended
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great love story. What girl doesn't want to save the bad boy and have the happily every after. I didn't think I would like it but I really enjoyed it.
B0009HKH6Q|3.0|Thomas Crown is a millionaire but for some unexplained reason enlists a group of thieves to pull on a bank heist. It seems that the fun is in the game and not the money.<br /><br />Nobody does COOL like Steve McQueen and he is always a delight to watch on screen. Although this 1968 film looks seriously dated, Steve McQueen could walk out of the film and into the modern world without a second thought.<br />The story goes over the top when Faye Dunaway enters as the cutthroat insurance investigator Vicky Anderson. She always gets her man and no doubt she'll get Thomas Crown in some way. The hard part of the story is knowing that Vicki knows Thomas Crown is behind the bank heist and he knows she knows. In fact, she tells him she is the insurance investigator for the crime. As it can only happen in filmland, they fall in love and a moral dilemma.<br /><br />I'm trying to watch all of Steve McQueen's movie so it is always fun to see his consistent style. He has the moves and the coolness factor to the max degree. He has a few scenes where he just laughs and laughs--odd, yes, but pulls it off. He also gets to show his driving skills in a great dune buggy scene with Dunaway. Could he do anything that wasn't cool?<br /><br />There are several weaknesses in this film--none of which involve Steve McQueen. Dialogue is minimal in this movie and you can go stretches with few words said. That might be OK if it didn't deter from a confusing story. Faye Dunaway is young and beautiful but in bizarre wardrobe. Her character Vicky Anderson would never wear just jeans and shirt. I listed to director Norma Jewison's commentary and he mentioned a young and upcoming fashion designer created Dunaway's fashions. Maybe it was high fashion for 1968 but it was outdated by 1969. She once looked like she was dressed in a ballarina outfit complete with leggings and all. Odd on all levels, especially with all her  big floppy hats.<br /><br />The movie soundtrack was irritating. It was some sort of1960's funk that did not add appeal to the film. Of course, while saying that, I have to acknowledge that the opening song, WINDMILLS OF YOUR MIND, won an Academy Award.<br /><br />While McQueen's Thomas Crown is cool and fun, Dunaway's Vicky Anderson is calculating and conniving. She is not above breaking the law to get evidence or to use the height of nastiness involving innocent people just to get a jump on her investigation. Will falling in love with Crown be her undoing. Will she betray him or will love conquer all?<br /><br />Jack Weston is flunkie hired by a mysterious man (Thomas Crown) to drive the getaway car after the heist. Weston is an underappreciated actor. He adds a bit of humanity to the film. He's probably not the height of immorality but yet he falls in to the criminal life.<br /><br />A new but overused technique in this film is the montage scenes of showing several scenes at the same time one screen. Commonplace now, it was new back then and Jewison used it over and over and over to the point of annoyance.<br /><br />THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR is one of many of Steve McQueen's famous films, so any fan has to watch this film. Steve McQueen is ageless and the height of coolness.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|This mahjong game has excellent. setups and a great variety. in backgrounds.  I ha e told. any of my friends a out this game for the kindle fire.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My friend showed me this app and I thought it was going to be stupid. Two days later, I was almost finished. I love that it's free and challenges my brain. Almost anyone can play this game. My grandmother plays this game and my eight year old cousin. This is my current favorite game.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|It is not much like the game I remember but it is enjoyable.  The only drawback is running out of energy.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is a whole whole lot of fun very enjoyable there are a lot of cool games to play
B008JGSM6G|4.0|fungame but free play doesn't get hard or interesting until you get to 8x8 at least.  the time trial is really fun too
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|\\"Act of Valor\\" is a great military movie starring actors and real-life Navy SEALS.  Because of this some of the acting is a little wooden but to me, this did not detract too much from the movie.  I knew before I started watching that there were non-actors in the film and I was more interested in the story itself, based on real-life happenings that the SEALS participated in.<br /><br />It showed the camaraderie that military personnel form between each other, as they depend on each other, risking their lives together. It also shows the heartbreak of war and that the families waiting at home sacrifice just like our soldiers do.<br /><br />I thought the movie felt very realistic.  Be aware this is a military action film.  There is violence, scenes of torture, some language.<br /><br />This probably isn't my favorite military action film. That is [[ASIN:B003LL3N1I Saving Private Ryan[Blu-ray]]] but it ranks right towards the top.
0307389839|5.0|If you're a runner or you are not one. You gonna enjoy this book.<br />Maybe isn't the best running book, and maybe not gonna teach you much about running.<br />But, what you gonna lear with this book, is see different evey runner.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Doodle God is a great game for people who like to put there brain to the test.I would suggest putting kids safe mode on if your gonna let your kids play but it is still one of my favorites.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|Overall the game was good.  However, a couple of pieces were missing. We ednjoyed playing the game, but the missing pieces were disappointing.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|very kid friendly. love it. my kids enjoy it and it is very easy for them to play. im glad they enjoy it very much.
B0059XTUVI|5.0|I was not expecting this movie to be as good as it was. the only reason this movie held high standards was because of meryl streeps performance. what happened to actors like her. did they fall of the face of the planet. Meryl streep is a good character performer. i saw a video of the real thatcher and i could not tell the diffrence between them, the same way with julia and julia she was julia childs. Meryl streep deserved an oscar for this movie. if she was not in it i think this movie would of been a big flop. this movie is awesome. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is so much fun on the kindle fire. there no ads and its great! there's a lot of puzzles to do and its a challenging but fun game for all ages. its so addictive! LOVVE THIS GAME!!!!!! :)
B0086700CM|4.0|Good graphics, good tempo, nice reward system, good for quick plays too.<br /><br />Main but minor gripe: I'd prefer ads over the intake currency it promotes (had to turn on parental controls just to avoid accidental purchases)
0738711500|5.0|This product came in fast and I got exactly what I paid for. I needed the same exact set that my mom had bought, and it was the set I received. I am completely satisfied.
1466401885|5.0|Enjoyed this book very much! Read it in 1 night. Great quick read and I can't wait for Travis' pov!
B007C9N4H8|3.0|A good family movie where you will smile throughout.  However, it is not special in any way and it does not make you want to watch it again.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I remember playing the similar game in gradeschool. I love this game. Wish you could get energy a little easier though. Have fun and try not to get too frustrated. Have a great time playing!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|it worked initially but once i started playing with it the weather scrolled of the page and wouldn't return so after trying to fix it for a while and with no success I deleted it.
B0086700CM|3.0|game is a lot of simple fun. two stars for addictiveness one for graphics and negative two for super annoying lags and freezes. when it works its great!
B00881VLCE|5.0|This game is easy love working puzzles. This is a great game for all ages. My grandkids love working puzzles this game keeps busy.
B007VT6QSI|1.0|First, I refuse to acknowledge this girl as a boy. I am so convinced she is really a woman. Everything about her screams \\"feminine.\\" Theres no denying theres a pair of BB's missing inbetween her (his?) legs.  I am so tired of this teeny bop music CLEARLY manufactured by big media for the sole purpose of bending the minds of young people to get them to do what they want. I wouldnt be surprised if he starts singing about a Pepsi or a Ford Focus. Remember New Kids on the Block? NSync? Backstreet Boys? All the same scenerio just different generation. This girl is all fake. Nothing about her is real. She doesnt even write her own songs. There is ZERO feeling and truth behind this manufactured crap. Im also happy that his music is comparable to Nsync, Backstreet Boys and New Kids on the Block. Remember what happened to their careers?  Just wait America, Justin Biebers music will fade from our ears one day too. What ever happened to generally good music? Its ironic that her title is \\"believe.\\" Yes, Justin - I believe this is the end of the world.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read the first two books within 4 days! Could NOT put it down! It's a must read and can't wait for the movie!!! Taking a break for a day or two before I read the last one! (head hurts from staring at my tablet constantly)
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This was a great book--it reminded me of Rothfuss' Kingkiller Chronicles, tragic, talented main character who's telling his life in flashbacks, but Kvothe was much more dramatic and the desperate love story got a bit old after a while.  Interesting premise, and I look forward to the next one!
B005WUHAX8|4.0|Love that this case is waterproof. I am super clumsy with expensive electronics and this case makes me feel much more at ease.  The issues that I have with it (why I didn't give it 5 stars is that even with an extender I can't dock this on my alarm clock anymore.  I don't want to take the case off to do so which basically renders my dock useless. Additionally, music sound quality with the case on isn't great through the speakers.
0393307050|5.0|This book lived up to its billing. A wonderful look into the British naval life in the 1800's. I'm not a sailor and got a little lost in the jargon, but it didn't get in the way of the story. The characters aren't perfect and that makes them believable. I can't wait to read the next book.
B0086700CM|5.0|I don't get what everyone is complaining about. I love this game, it's addicting and I have zero issues with it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is one of the better games I have. capital YES to get this game. it's  hard and a time killer
B007JNR518|5.0|It seemed to be a struggle for director/star Robert Redford to get this fine film started since many studios passed on it, until the Disney people stated that they would finance it if Redford himself would star in it as well as direct.  Reluctantly Redford did star breaking his cardinal rule that it would be hard to direct and star in the same time--but as luck would have it, the film was a success despite the long shooting schedule.  One of the things I liked about this film is Redford's penchant for developing the character no matter it takes him---and that to me is one of the film's strengths.  Another is that he hired cinematographer Robert Richardson (JFK;Casino) to develop some awestriking visuals, because this film is definitely a visual treat--and should be seen on a big screen.  The Blu-ray edition, though, is excellent and if you have a large HDTV like around 60\\" or 65\\"--you'll definitely enjoy this film.  It's probably the most visual Redford film since \\"Jeremiah Johnson\\" which I also just purchased recently in Blu-ray.  This is also the film debut of a very young Scarlett Johanson who received raves for her role as the damaged daughter.
B0086700CM|3.0|I wouldn't waste the space on this app. Its fun at first but you do the same track every single time. Not very entertaining
0857680986|5.0|I am glad I was able to purchase his book, I don't need to keep on  checking-out this book from the library!
B008JGSM6G|2.0|Droid X2, it's not formatted right, not even close. if a column is off the screen (which means every level past the basic tutorial levels), it's unplayable.<br /><br />Will change to 5 stars if fixed.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Easy enough for kids to get on and check the weather. Use it almost every day. Very useful app to use.
B0058VW36U|5.0|it is funny awesome great app you should get it I would so anything to get this game everyone reading this get app
B0011TQLA2|5.0|Stinkin' good album. I have most of Radiohead's stuff already, everything except Pablo Honey, but for some reason I didn't get this one until recently. It is now number 3 on my list of best Radiohead albums, after OK Computer and Kid A. I thought Hail to the Thief was going to be hard to beat, but after a few months of listening I think In Rainbows is superior. It seems more focused, more musical, and slightly less experimental. It's as if they've taken the best styles and ideas from their previous albums and crafted a new album with them. The album is mostly medium to slower rock songs, like Nude, All I Need, and personal fave House of Cards, but the album also features one of the better pumping, adrenaline-fused rock songs in a while from Radiohead, Bodysnatchers. Overall a great album for a fan of any or all of Radiohead's various musical stages.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|i have found my new addiction. its even better that i got it for $free.99. tons of courses and challenges.  will be playing this for at least a few months.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is addicting and really fun... was unsure about the game at first but me and my wife play it....
B00802JMPO|5.0|I ordered all 3 books (as a set) from Amazon. The retail price is $15.95/each as Amazon had them for $9.57/each + shipping. I ended up paying a little less than $38 for the triliogy set. AND they came earlier than the expected date! The books are awesome and have a twist on love, lust, and sex! Definitely something new to my collection, but the story is smooth, and I didn't find it raunchy or anything. Enjoy!
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|Love Bruno Mars! He's a brilliant and talented artist ... songwriter, singer, performer. Excellent production on this album ... and what a great buy!
B004EPYZT4|2.0|In a decade of remakes by Hollywood, this is one of many that pales in comparison to the originals.  This version of Conan follows a different story-line than the original two Schwarzenegger films.  Here, we see an origins story of Conan, from birth to childhood, to his learning how to use and forge a sword, the destruction of his family, and his pursuit of revenge.  All throughout are graphic fight scenes high on blood on low on gore.  The special effects are good, though not original.  The dialogue is plain, enough to get the ideas across but nothing inspirational.  The biggest letdown are the lack of comedy and the boring soundtrack.  The original Conan movies had a steady mix of subtle and overt humor; whether it be the camel spitting on Conan, or Conan knocking himself out on a tree.  Not this movie, Jason Momoa's Conan is just serious, as are all the other characters.  Everybody is either wanting to kill or avoid getting killed.  This film's soundtrack was also lackluster with no memorable tunes.  This is quite unlike the first two movies, which was good background music appropriate for each scene.  Overall, another example of a film undone with a lackluster script to follow.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|I was hoping that I would love this and it did not dissapoint.  The DVD arrived early and the movie was delightful
B005K17RU0|4.0|a very good resource for a quick check on the weather wherever you are located. Found this app. to be great.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Pictures are appealing and beautiful, so many other puzzles creators use humdrum boring pictures. I also appreciate the fact that I am given the choice to have the edge pieces separated from center pieces. Over all, Magic Puzzles have been the most entertaining puzzle creations I have played to date. I will continue to look to Magic Puzzles for furture puzzles.
B001N3GUIE|3.0|I was a little disappointed in the film.  It was slow and muddled down with endless dialogue.  I struggled to get through it.  The highlight was seeing a young Leslie Nielsen in one of his first films.  The Naked Gun/Airplane star had come a long way.  May he rest in peace.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|this is one of the best games ever I would highly recommend this to every one. I hope you enjoy this as much as me.
B0086700CM|5.0|its sooper fun! I luv it. bee hop boo beep I a f a I a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
0099570068|3.0|I found myself to be very unsympathetic towards Kate, she wasn't a likable person in my eyes. I did relate to her as a working mother minus the nanny and the housekeeper though. I feel like this book was simply comic relief toward the over dramatic life I possibly live. It didn't show me anything new but I was entertained at times.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I've enjoyed this game and I haven't found it super challenging.  Was to the &quot;harder&quot; levels pretty early on.  My 3 y/o loves it, and has gotten through the 5X5 levels with a little help.  Good game for adults and pre-school aged kids.
B000UAFDP2|1.0|It is a great entertaining movie, I have seen it before and I own the dvd. But this blu-ray would not play in any of my 2 BD players!
B007VTVGAQ|5.0|Fiona is back..And back in a stride that can only be hers. The gallant, moody, devil-may-care poetess of all things angst ridden holds your attention for every one of the 2550 seconds on this album. Few artists have the ability to carry lyrical journeys against the free finger enthusiasm for a piano - ' The idler wheel....' proves that Fiona can. The album starts with mild mumblings that become energetically anthemic as the album progresses. There is Fiona's signature vocal rawness and range and then there is the emotive cadence of poetry arranged to powerful keystrokes and minimal instrumentation.This is not a casual listen, not something you plonk into the cd player of your car and drive along.. Fiona demands and commands your attention like a petulant charming woman-child.
B0083F5J7S|5.0|I love the song payphone so I ordered the cd, and it had no scratches or anything, and has very good audio quality in my cd player. I  love it! it is probably a good thing to buy from amazon. LOVE PAYPHONE AND IT IS MY NEW FAVORITE SONG!
0345803507|2.0|I recently finished reading the first book, and am in the beginning of the second. I doubt I'll make it to the third because I'm getting bored and frustrated by this series.  Anastasia Steele has to be one of the most irritating, unlikeable protagonists of all time. It makes no sense that a 21-year-old college student a) doesn't know own or know how to use a laptop b) has only two friends in the world, and c) has never had sex and or even touched her own genitals before she met Christian. And can I just point out that James made sure we didn't forget that Ana's friend Jose was Mexican, because he said \\"Dios mio!' in every conversation he had with her? No stereotypes here!<br />  I love how James is dressing up this abusive, obsessive-compulsive man as a tortured soul trying to reconcile his dark past by beating the shit out of women in the bedroom. That so is not what BDSM is about. Christian and Ana's \\"relationship\\", in reality, is unhealthy, albeit creepy.  If you want to read this book for the LOL factor, I'd recommend it, but I otherwise, I wouldn't waste my time.
1439130833|3.0|I decided to get the electronic version.  I downloaded it off of iTunes for only $4.99 compared to the hardcover version for over $20.  I find it useful for reminders and inspiration.  If you want this as a physical copy, be prepared to pay over double what you can get for less on iPhone.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I absolutely loved this book & that I was hooked on the book ever since Chapter 1. I was just looking for a good book to read when I stumbled upon this book. It was a reasonable price of kindle book. I just finished the book & that I will re-read the kindle book again. I really hope that the author does another book.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I really wanted to see what the hoopla is all about. I am happy I didn't actually buy this book but borrowed it from someone. I didn't check the reviews on Amazon before starting to read it and what struck me immediately was how much it reminded me of Twilight(and then I saw numerous people commenting on the same thing). After I read couple of pages I was starting to get irritated by numerous \\"flushes, blushes and double crap\\". Same words, over and over again. And then there was 26 year old \\"billionare\\" who is model handsome, flies planes, speaks different languages and even gives money to the poor and he is so captivated with our Anastasia. Geez, are you serious? As for the sex scenes, there a lot of other writers that do a better job with that. Plus, what kind of a woman would want the relationship described in this book? Hello, Feminists?<br />I will admit that I managed to get through only less than half of this book but I just couldn't find it interesting. As Homer Simpson would say: \\"Booring!\\"<br />I have read Twilight(and while not a huge fan, I thought the story was kind of cool so I could see the appeal)but this is its MORE boring and more ridiculous clone. As one of the reviewers wrote that most people who read a lot, wouldn't like this. He is right-because the people who i know who did like it, read probably 1 book a year. I read several books a week and I thought this reads like 15 y old wrote it.
030758836X|5.0|Gillian Flynn's GONE GIRL is an unusually powerful beach book.  Her plot features genuine surprises, her characters are well drawn, and games with unreliable narration serve the novel well.  In addition, the novel offers thoughtful, complete criticism of contemporary media-saturated society.
0345803493|5.0|It is a very nice story to read. In this book we learn a thing or two about the BDSM world. It is true that most BDSM books don't have much of a plot, a lot of sex and no real intimacy. The plot is that the former subs remains fixated. But he wants Ana. She loves him and he really cares about her. But can he say it.<br />Far away it reminds me of another book that I read about the BDSM scene: The Elevation to Divinity. From Mistress Lucrezia to Goddess Ira. Via Google I found out that the content was largely reality and not fiction. This book describes the reverse. What would happen if a man who is not under the spell of BDSM falls in love with a woman who is well known in the BDSM world. In this book there is intimacy, a plot and it is not superfluous.  I loved to read it. Like this book of E.L. James a must to read for those who love or are interested in the BDSM World. But back to 50 Shades Darker. Is  50 Shades Darker good? I find it entertaining, hot and worth reading.
B007C4ZJ0S|1.0|What a waste of big name talent in supporting roles. The lead actress wasn't even big name (nor will she ever be) and she was just awful. Poor acting, Poor script, poor dialog, all-round disappointing. Even the fight scenes didn't look real. The actors looked like they were just practicing their choreography in the fight scenes. You could actually see them move into position to take a hit. I knew after the first totally unbelievable scene the whole movie would be bad but watched the whole thing anyway. The film jumps all over the place without making it clear why, and drops characters without explanation shortly after they are inserted into the plot.<br /><br />My copy had subtitles I couldn't get rid of, but they came in handy when I realized half the dialog was mumbled. Glad I got it from the library, because I would have felt bad even paying $1 at Redbox for this. This film looked like it was written and made by a first year film student, not seasoned professionals.

0062060554|4.0|Whew....This book definitely gave me chills, however it is definitely one to remember.  I would recommend this book to any of my friends for sure :)
B006XF5BTG|5.0|How many books can change your life?. Well, I don't know, but I DO know one that can. Bigger, Leaner, Stronger is that book. And it will, if you follow it, for the better.<br /><br />Let me tell you how I knew about this book. Some time ago I was looking to get back exercising, so  I bought some equipment for a gym at home, tired of spending time and money in gyms, and I needed something for my work outs. So I headed for amazon, and looked for bodybuilding books. This one had (and has) very good reviews, so I tried it and, at first, I didn't like it much. It was talking about what type of workouts you should do, but about calories, aminoacids, carbs, proteins and a bunch of vocabulary.<br /><br />But when I continued reading, it all started to make sense, because without the proper vocabulary, you can't understand what you're reading. Then it goes on with the importance of nutrition, the good and bad nutrients and meals, how to make a meal plan if you want to cut, mantain or bulk. It also explains a lot of things that people don't know about Health, Nutrition and Fitness, and the biggest myths and mistakes of building muscle (although if you want it in more detail, there is this book: [[ASIN:147514377X Muscle Myths: 50 Health & Fitness Mistakes You Didn't Know You Were Making]])<br /><br />Then it comes the workouts. Although this is not a book about workouts, there are enough included in the additional free report, for a whole year. Finally, he gets to the supplements, which ones work, and which ones don't, so you can save a lot of money in useless supplements.<br /><br />After reading this book in a day, my life started changing, and it has, for the better, and quickly.
B008JGSM6G|1.0|the levels do not get any harder as you play I have something a lot like this but I actually makes a picture when you are done. each level takes about 30 seconds to complete I was half way through in about 15 minutes.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this. game is super fun I would rate it 50 stars if I could. its not a you have to pay to actually. play.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Ice age is a really fun game. It makes you want to come back. It's definitely an addictive game. Good graphics and rarely freezes for me. And for the few times it did, the great game was worth my time. I love Ice Age Village and hope you try it out.
B00884GR0W|5.0|way better graphics and less confususin the minecraft. the monster are reallofe and cool, the quests are fun, and the blocks are amazing. I know for a fact u cant build a disco in minecraft
B008BIN9EW|5.0|very good turn based strategy game. like others have said, it is just like a mixture of starcraft and advanced wars, only simplified. well thought out game that plays great on the kindle fire. no complaints and worth the money.
B007L6VR6M|5.0|With Wes Anderson, you either buy into his odd, very idiosyncratic and distinctive style, with it's touches of<br />twisted, surreal fairy-tale tone, and performances that are both restrained on yet not at all naturalistic -<br />or you don't. For me, I find his style almost always endearing, and both very funny and very touching (The<br />Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou was the one time it didn't really work for me).<br /><br />As always the performances here are remarkable from Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Bill Murray (the quintessential<br />Wes Anderson actor), Francis McDormand and Tilda Swinton as the adults, to two luminous and unique<br />performances by the film's pre-adolescent lovers Kara Haywood and Jared Gilman.<br /><br />While imposing a seemingly astringent style, all right angles (almost every cut within a scene is at 90 degrees or<br />180 degrees to the shot before it), and carefully composed tableaux, this film captures the wonderful, surreal<br />weirdness of first love (or at least one's childhood fantasy of first love) with a moving and hilarious honesty.<br /><br />Somehow, while the story of Sam and Suzy's attempt to escape from the insane adult world that surrounds them<br />has little to do with the realities of day to day life as we know it, it has everything to do with the realities of the<br />budding heart.<br /><br />I can't remember when a film so reminded me of my own first fantasies of love and (tasteful but honest) sexuality.<br />I love when a film makes a tear fall from my eye at the same time I'm laughing, and that's the rare trick Anderson<br />has accomplished here.
B0079XPUOW|4.0|I really liked the witty dialogue. He really hits it spot on saying just enough and never over explaining or lingering too long on one joke or moment. The characters are given adequate room to develop. The premise of the book is that the redshirts are all going to die a meaningless death, their sole purpose driving the point home that dangers encountered by the main characters are real and lethal. Despite this being known the story is both entertaining and hard to put down. On the other hand, it is no less filled with arbitrary deaths, weird science and plot holes. But this is entertainment and not a new way to write books, so we're still glad to read this book. At the end of the day I found the story satisfying and well written. I don't think the codas which are about 20% of the book are up to the same standard. The first was a complete turn-off and I ended up skimming though it. The other two are marginally worth reading. This would have been a 5 star review if not for what I thought of as unnecessary filler.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I just wish the new updates on the phones would make it to the kindle fire version.  Still a fun game though.
0345803507|2.0|I really like the Fifty Shades Trilogy however the quality of the book I purchased had a lot to be desired. I take care of ALL of my books so they all look brand new. 20 pages into this book half of it had fallen apart. not impressed to say the least!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I needed a little calculator for adding up bills! I downloaded this app and it does the job! nothing more nothing less. I would recommend this to anyone bedding a simple calculator.
B006LSZECO|5.0|In my opinion, this book got off to a slow start, but when it started rolling...brother hang on!  The characters and plot are twisted to say the least.  I'd say this was the best $12.99 I've spent so far this summer.  You won't regret investing either your time or your dollars in this one.  Enjoy
B0054JZC6E|5.0|&quot;that was soo fun &quot;  that's what I tell my mom after every game its like a you are have a super amount of fun.
034580404X|5.0|I LOVE THE STORY  HOT HOT HOT......WE ALL KNOW SOMEONE WHO HAS ISSUES... CANNOT WAIT FOR ANY OTHER BOOKS BY THIS AUTHOR
B00006FDCD|4.0|The shipping was great. Came in early. It was a good price. me and my daughter had just read the book and it was kinda of a let down with the movie. not as scary as I remember it being. P.S. the second part of the movie is on the back side of the one DVD. I'm sorry to say It took us a little bit of time to figure that out!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|very fun lots to do. always loved this game. had it on my phone. now on my kindle. this one is a lot better
B003XCVQ3C|4.0|I bought this to use with my MacBook Air.  It has connected to LCD displays, TVs, and wireless video senders.  On occasion the audio portion hasn't worked with the TV, but I can't place the blame on the adapter 100%.  It may be the TV as well.  In any case, it has worked the next time I tried it.  I like that the silver and white finish matches the Air.  I'd buy this again.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|It's an okay game; if you want something to pass the time. The games aren't that fun but at least they can entertain you.
B008FC4WA4|5.0|This could have been written by Nora Ephron, and seems like a direct descendant of \\"When Harry met Sally.\\"  However, the story is set in England, the characters have different names, and it was written by Nick Hornby.  This is a whimsical slice-of-life story that I wish had been fleshed out into a full-blown novel, or at least a novella.  I loved it, but was disappointed when the story ended.  It was simply too short.
034580404X|1.0|I was hoping for something better after all this hype.  It's a poorly written and boring sexual escapade.  The first book had a glimmer of hope only to be smashed by the 2nd and 3rd novels.  The sex gets boring. The story just takes a dive.  It's not even that risque.  I've read books that make this crap look tame.  I wouldn't reccommend this to anyone.  Shame on you media for hyping this hunk of crap up.  Extremely disappointed that I bought this.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|A story about Mr. S& a tentative Ms. M.  In the end of this first book, the tentative M had a mind to get away from it all....then it's to be continued.  I'm moving on to the second book to find redemption.  I need to find out if there is something sensible at the end of this series with sex scenes played out in scrutinizing detail every 2-3 pages!  Honestly, reading this was like being forced to finish a dozen chocolate cakes all at once!  It's good, it's yummy but one can only take so much.<br /><br />I heard somewhere a movie version is in the works.  Really now, it will be an x-rated film then, or the director should be someone really, really good to pass it for R.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Big Bang Theory keeps me laughing. I watch it all the time. I own the firt 5 seasons and constantly adding more to the collection.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|If I can use this successfully, anyone can! Great Bible!<br />Easy to use, lots of versions, very helpful. I particularly like the daily study guides.
B008JGSM6G|1.0|This app is already a rip off of the better app &quot;Router&quot;, and then it also fails to display properly on the screen. Amazon needs to do better quality control.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it really fun because you have yo beat games to earn coins too buy new games that's why it is such a really cool game
B0017YDPI2|5.0|Got it in the mail in 2 days. No signing. Perfect for my hectic schedule. Not a bad price for this dvd either.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|The cover is all i could ask for. It may feel flimsy at first, but it's definitely sturdy and the kindle fire snaps right into it!<br />My only complaint, and it's not even really a complaint, is that the folding cover that is supposed to work as a stand doesn't hold up very well. If you move the slightest bit it seems to give out. With that said, i generally hold my kindle as a book and only use that when I'm being extra lazy, so no huge issue there. :-) Love the cover and it's some great protection.
B003L77GGU|5.0|Whats not to like? Its blu ray. Its my favorite tv show. And it was a great deal for my favorite show!
B0086700CM|4.0|Temple run is fun but can get annoying. I wish they had more girls on it. Still it was exciting!! I have been waiting forever for this wicked and totally awesome app!
B0063IH60K|4.0|this is a pretty good app. it has great graphics and it is easy to move the cards. there is a couple of down sides though, there is a lot of adds and they are kind of annoying. the cards are also pretty small. one of the worst parts about this app is the dealing. you have to choose between a winning deal (where you are guarenteed to win)  or a random deal,  which you almost always loose.
B0086700CM|2.0|when i first played it ....it was fun then a few weeks later it was geting boring and it was running slow then froze my kindle fire but temple run brave works beter remove temple run frome devise....
B004UID2LC|5.0|ok the great things is everything, except wen the downside comes into play...everything stops loading...EVERYTHING.. and to get it working again i have to reinstall the app
B006LSZECO|5.0|Just finished reading Gone Girl....I heard it was really good but that is an understatement.  I loved the really sharp wit, but the none stop roller coaster ride of this marriage was brilliant. At times I was stunned at events that were taking place.....could not stop reading it. I am planning on reading all Gillian Flynn's Books.....
B004P1JDJO|4.0|I think everyone who manages people should read this.  My favorite aspect of the book is that the author draws from quality, peer-reviewed, academic research to support his argument.  This sets it apart from most management books.  In addition, it is well written and enjoyable to read.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love it angry birds is awesome this is all I can say I love angry birds!!!!!!!!!!' gosh sorry deserves a five star rating
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I've enjoyed it so far. I've reinstalled twice now and had to start over but easily made it back to 70+ levels. Reinstallation was not due to game but due to flawed Kindle Fire. New Kindle now, started game again. Good diversion, but I don't spend hours playing games so I generally have sufficient energy.
B0086700CM|4.0|Great game. Fun for the whole family. The little ones like to watch and the big ones like to take Daddy down.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a great time killer when waiting for an appointment or any other time. works great on my Samsung.My grand daughter downloaded it oh her Apple 4 and we challange each other to see who finishes the level first. I really enjoy it.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I was very pleased to come across this app. I do a lot on my kindle and was in need of a calculator from time to time.  this is so very convenient for me. Thanks!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|make your photos even better with this app! nice layout, interface, and tools! yep yep yep yep yep yep yep.
0143038419|1.0|In the immortal words of Dorothty Parker, a far better writer than Ms. Gilbert, this is not a work to be cast aside lightly, rather it is to be thrown with great force.<br /><br />I can't add much to what the other reviewers already have written, but what a mess. We're supposed to feel sympathy for, and worse, take advice from, a woman who cheats on her faithful husband, grows depressed when the lover who broke up her marriage leaves her, so leaves her job and her \\"prestigious\\" (her word) NYC apartment and  her \\"spare\\" sprawling mansion in Westchester on a year-long vacation on her boss's dime?  She insists on reminding the reader on each page  that she's just so physically attractive and so gosh-darn likable that no one can resist her (the men don't stare anymore because they're polite now, she says, not because she's aged). She devotes pages to convincing the reader that we all should feel entitled to this, but she fails to take into account that not everyone can afford, financially or otherwise, to bail on all their obligations for a year of \\"me, me, me.\\"<br /><br />The narcissism of the writer and story - and the ridiculous fact that she was paid $200,000 in advance to take this voyage of self-absorption is crazy.  But what could I expect? I read this on the recommendation of Raj from The Big Bang Theory. Last time I take advice from a TV character. Darn you, Kutrapali!
0345803485|1.0|I caved to peer pressure and read this book.  All of my friends have raved about how wonderful this book is.  I think it's time to re-evaluate my friendships because anyone who thinks this book is good, is fifty shades stupid! This book is not even worthy of one star.
B000058CAV|1.0|I did not view this DVD because it came from the wrong zone.  Hopefully, I can see this movie in the future and give a review.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is the worst example of a book getting \\"buzz\\" and becoming a best seller when it is seriously bad. Terrible awkward writing. Pathetic immature heroine. Ridiculous hero who also happens to be into s&m sex. The scary part is that I bet there are a lot of teen girls reading this and it's basically really poorly written porn. She loses her virginity to a dominant sex freak and it goes downhill from there.<br /><br />I'm sure there is some well written erotica out there. This is a total waste of time. Please pass the word and get this awful book off the #1 slot. It's an embarrassment.
B0008GNJZY|5.0|Great movie.  I love it when an individual takes the time to make a difference in the lives of our young generation.  This movie showed how negatives can be changed into positives in our lives.
B00571F26Y|5.0|As a healthcare professional I have been taught the low fat, whole grains approach.  I now realize how wrong it is.  This book has opened my view on nutrition.  Since reading this, I have read many other books that reinforce Dr. Davis's book.  This is an eye opening book that I would recommend to anyone with an interest in health and nutrition!  So many people could be helped with this book.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|This is the best show on Tv right now.  It has a sense of fun that Tv has lacked for a long time. Castle and Becket are the best team since John Steed and Emma Peel on the Avengers. The show is extremely well written and avoid both plot and character pit falls that so many other series fall into. The cast is perfect they all work well together.  This show is rare in that it can put you on the edge of your seat and have you worried about the characters one second and laughing or even crying the next. I have not seen anything that managed to keep me on the edge of my seat and yet keep a spirit of fun since the films of Hitchcock.  My only complaint is that none of the seasons are on Blu Ray despite the show being broadcast in HD and season two is the only season with out comentaries.  Still it is worth it for the episodes alone.  If you like good mysteries,fun characters,and edge of your seat sespense this is the series for you.
B0038NN3B4|5.0|I have tried losing weight the low fat -whole grain-calorie counting way with poor results.  I have never even read Atkins because I always thought \\"I couldn't do that\\".  All along the low carb approach was exactly what I needed.  I am very addicted to carbs.  Once I tried a low carb diet, not only did I lose weight, I feel so much better and best of all I'm not a slave to constant hunger!  So many people could be helped by a low carb lifestyle.  This book is full of great information with science to back it up, also great ideas for recipes.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love the ease of this app.  everyone should use it!<br />the numbers are a wonderful size because I have lupus and fingers don't bend so well.
B003L77GG0|2.0|I'm on the second disk now, and the third episode does not play on my xbox 360, on my TV's DVD player it skips constantly, however, it does play on my PS3. Not really sure why, it is not the blue ray version so there is really no excuse for the dvd to only play on certain devices.
B008JGSM6G|1.0|An entire column is cut off on my HTC sensation in every game. Could have been fun, but they dropped the ball
0385737955|4.0|the book was good, a good start to the other books. Being left in the dark about what is going on helped move the story along and keep the suspense up.
B00514HDNW|4.0|I had seen three movie versions of this book, the one with Vincent Price (my favourite), the one with Charlton Heston and the one with Will Smith, before reading the story and none of them come close to what the book is actually about.  The story starts with our hero hunting and killing vampires and ends up being the story of perception.  At times I felt the story was quite slow moving, but I believe that is part of the telling, because there are no other humans to help this man make the time pass.  I read several of the 1 and 2 starred reviews and I feel most of them were unjust because they were expecting the book version of the Will Smith movie.  Readers should know this book was written in 1954 and has the feel of the same era.  It is not a slash bang smash em up.  It is a commentary.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game. It isn't a game where its free and you can only play one EASY game then to play anything else you have to pay,its not like that. Its a fun game. If you are looking for a free 5 star rated game that ROCKS this is your game!!!!!! Trust me,it is a great puzzle.
0060090367|1.0|I love Maeve Binchy and was looking for recommendations of similar writers/stories -- this is NOT it.  Other than having \\"family in Ireland\\", that is where the similarities ended.  There was no depth to any of the characters, just a lot of surface generalizations, i.e., Mom can't cook, Anna is a \\"flower child\\", Dad is a pushover, Helen is spoiled.  I wasn't even able to muster up much empathy for the main character (really?  you're 29 years old and you run home to your overly accommodating parents to wallow in self-pity for over a month?) I spent so much time skimming over the imaginary conversations this character kept having in her head and kept wishing there was more meat to the story.  Perhaps if I wasn't expecting so much, I wouldn't have been so disappointed.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I started reading this book because I wanted to see what the hype was all about. I quickly fell in love with the characters and the story. You can't help but feel the same way about Christian that Ana does. I read all three books in a short time period and would suggest to anyone who wants a real love story, with the baggage that comes along with any relationship.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is my favorite book in the series!  It is not an \\"in between\\" book but is a strong thrilling book on its own.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Useful, handy, simple uncluttered interface; easy to use, good visibility and nice big keys. This is an app worth having.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|The app would be great if the radar was dependable. Sometimes it loads but lately, more often than not, I get a blank screen. It's strange because all the other functions work just fine.<br /><br />UPDATE! The radar [map] has been fixed and this works great now! I updated from 2 to 5 star, 5/19/13.

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Tight and snug fit with a solid feel to it without adding bulk or heft.  Saved the kindle in the first week of having it. Will highly recommend this to anyone with a kindle fire.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Love the game very addictive. Easy for my kids to play also we love the movies too. You have to try for yourself. and the best. part its free!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|This is a great game that I would recemend to all ages for younger ages turn on the safty feature in the options area
6305428522|2.0|Worthwhile and thoughtful, but extremely slow-moving. . .<br /><br />The subject is important but the movie is stretched out to make a full-length movie. It should be reduced to half its present length.

B004QL7K6G|2.0|\\"Wanderlust\\" functions less as a film than it does as a series of comedy sketches stitched together. Starring two attractive and funny leads (Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston) and featuring even more likable and funny actors in supporting roles (Justin Theroux, Lauren Ambrose, Malin Akerman, Alan Alda, etc.); there is no shortage of talent here to mine. What's lacking is a consistent, cohesive storyline and believable character development.<br /><br />Comedy Sketch 1: The film starts with couple George (Rudd) and Linda (Aniston) in New York, where their lives are falling apart. They've just spent a fortune on a tiny, overpriced studio apartment (or \\"microloft\\" as the real estate agent insists on calling it) when George loses his job, while Linda is unable to pitch her documentary (a labor of love about penguin testicular cancer) to HBO. This section of the film plays like a perfunctory parody of New York life, where hurried, exhausted people work in demanding, soul-crushing jobs just to be able to afford tiny apartments. This is territory that has been explored many, many times in much more clever films.<br /><br />Comedy Sketch 2: Desperate, George and Linda pack up and move to Atlanta, where George can work for his brother. Driving through northern Georgia and looking for a place to spend the night, the couple happens upon the \\"Elysium\\" community, a hippie commune full of all sorts of wacky, countercultural characters. George and Linda have a blast spending the night partying with the welcoming and free-spirited people, before continuing onto Atlanta.<br /><br />Comedy Sketch 3: George and Linda arrive at George's obnoxious, tactless brother's garish McMansion, in order to work for his Port-a-Potty business. The whole place reeks of misery, with George a rage-aholic, his wife heavily medicated, and his son an awful brat. So George and Linda quickly decide to go back to Comedy Sketch 2, to try living full time in Elysium.<br /><br />The film might have worked if it had just completely abandoned any conventional storytelling and just embraced being completely absurd (like \\"Wet Hot American Summer\\", the classic that director David Wain wrote). Unfortunately, \\"Wanderlust\\" tries to convince the audience that its main characters have somehow learned something throughout all their wacky adventures, and emerged a stronger couple, and its in this way that the film falls flat. George and Linda seem to just flail about the film, going from one phony epiphany to another, before finally falling into a flat, contrived \\"happy ending.\\"ad just completely abandoned any conventional storytelling and just embraced being completely absurd (like \\"Wet Hot American Summer\\", the classic that director David Wain wrote).

B0058UXHHK|4.0|[[ASIN:B0058UXHHK Twenty-Eight and a Half Wishes (Rose Gardner Mystery #1)]]I got this book free on Kindle. This is one of the murder mystery authors I've never heard of before. I am reading this book on Kindle now and am halfway through the book and liking it. It did make me wonder if there was a series. I do enjoy authors who continue writing about the same characters.<br /><br />I publish my own stories online with some of the same characters I made up. Their names are McCarey and Cline. You can visit my page at fictionpress dot com under the name of FonzFan82 to read up on those characters. I am mostly a fan of fiction books than I am of nonfiction. Still, the book goes fast just like the others you read. Let's hope the other books she writes will be fast reading.
