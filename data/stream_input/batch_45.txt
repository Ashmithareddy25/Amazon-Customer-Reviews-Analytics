B004NFXA7I|5|Buy these in bulk because you'll want to apply the treatment to all your vehicles and glass surfaces.  Works great as a more permanent water repellant and works awesome on GoPro lenses as well!
B000HBGL14|5|Product arrived in a timely manner and was as described
B00DEPIRXA|5|Great roof and delivered faster than promised - wonderful!!
B001CQWM8E|5|great buy
B00EO4Q1OM|5|This worked perfect and was easy to install. Also we received this faster than expected.
B001V8PRAS|5|This is my second BAL X-chock. Can't beat them. Easy to install and very secure.
B00861J8BW|5|My Z28 flies again!  Great price too.
B00027H04A|5|Perfect fit on my 1984 Evinrude 70.  Brought that dead cylinder back to life.  Easy install.
B001Q8IXPY|1|Does not absorb moisture,  Useless for washing windows.
B000JK2D06|5|Best wax I have ever used. Goes on easily and comes off even easier. Great shine on my silver 135i.
B00LHK6W18|4|Good Product. Installed quite easily on a 1999 Cavalier. The directions are short and easy to follow, with reference pictures. 3 different settings for the retention ring. And didn't seem brittle at all. I immediately took the car out on the interstate after install, did about 80MPH for 10 miles. They were all still perfectly in place when I got home. And, they look pretty good on the car. They are silver as described, so don't let the picture fool you into thinking they are chrome, because they are not. Satisfied customer.
B00HG2UEBA|5|How Neat
B0045V8CKU|5|Fast shipping. Installed with no problem.
B00D6YO7IS|5|Fits perfectly in my 2015 Forester, rugged, and is a great design.  Love it.
B000XQ54IO|2|Looks real nice, but Would Not Stick to Car!
B00CCSD6CW|3|I'm sure this stuff might work well however, I ran into two problems.  #1) The stuff scratches up very easily.  If you do not apply it gently, you will have scuff marks all over the film.  #2) You better be very experienced with vinyl/plastic wraps or have even, square or round headlights.  We attempted to do this to an 08' accord sedan.  Could not get the film on correctly with the headlights OR tail lights.  They had too many curves, rounded spots, etc...  Good luck!
B003SS8AMQ|5|Exactly what I ordered and expected.
B00KTIF652|5|no problems the directions were cut and dry and haven`t had any trouble with them
B005N53CBQ|5|Love it!!
B00BUROANA|5|Product arrived quickly and replaced the old element to bring my fridg back to life!!!  Works like a champ for now!!
B0006O2PBW|5|great smell, good price
B007TZXW04|1|Extremely poor quality, looked like it was cut out by hand. Took it off my rig 2 minutes after I put it on.
B007JEJQP0|4|it is a little wider than my 2013 CRV chasis for me to install the 4 botls.
B00ODFO83I|5|Excellent for covering up my Farmers Market goods and keeping everything secure.
B00KTHZJ1O|1|DO NOT BUY THIS KEY! Amazon says this item is verified to work, however, $316. And 3 hours later at the Chrysler dealership i now had to buy a key from them just to get my car working again. This key i purchased came in and i was stoked as my old key was cracked and battery holder inside key was broke. I called Chrysler and to get the key, program and cut it was gonna be $250. I decided to go this option since i seen it was compatible (supposedly). It came in, i was excited to be able to use the remote functions again. I did not have 2 working keys so per the instructions i took it to dealership to be programmed and cut. After nearly 2 hours they had tried the key twice and during second attempt the key having pin issues with dealerconnect the cars key system reset itself and now none of my keys would work.... Chrysler said basically if you dont have another key then youll have to tow the vehicle elsewhere but are still required to pay for the programming. Towing and having no car was not an option. So i had to transfer funds (thank god i had it atleast for an emergency such as this) and have them cut one of their own keys and program it to be able to even drive my car. So after the $250 and $65 for the original key i am out $365 and have an useless key that i bought on here which has caused me nothing but issue. I tried to contact World Wide Remotes to ask what could be done however i recieved no answer and no return call so next call was to Amazon. Thankfully Amazon listened to my issue and immediately was trying to resolve my problem. As of now theres no resolution but ill update this when/if there is. So buyer beware you may be trying to save money however in the end you may be out much more then you bargained for....
B000EVWDAK|1|Was working great, then the thing just died.  Thought it was the battery.  Nope, literally dead.
B00V2XHQ4W|5|Absolutely awesome. Super bright. Would buy again
B010RUBYDO|5|Best sunglasses ever.  Fit great, lets you enjoy a beautiful day and takes away glare.  All my other sunglasses made a nice day appear dark.  These are well worth the price, amazing clarity.
B0012DRW2I|5|Works great and fits perfectly
B001FAI9NO|5|Fit great. Matched front and rear bumpers perfectly.
B00FENG0K2|5|Spent a week camping and was able to keep my camper battery charged...this seems to work as promised.  But, I need a longer cord to capture the sun....so keep that in mind if you like shady camping areas.  I ended up pulling the battery to charge it...The Go Power is easy to use and packs up in a great portable case.
B0002SRF4O|5|used this to repair the head on the car worked perfect'
B00KTDYCCK|5|It worked great for me at half the cost in the store.
B002UC2XD8|4|Exact replacement of the original
B00T5DK2SS|2|These covers are not the same color as the picture. They are actually hot pink.
B00BDVOAQU|5|Works perfectly
B00OI6B6XW|5|much improved handling with fewer rattles
B000OCF8NI|2|If your serious about cleaning wheels then this is an awful brush.<br />The handle is far too long for cleaning wheels meaning that you get no leverage.  You have to hold the handle about half way down in order to be able to use it.  It really needs about 6 inches cut off it.<br />Furthermore, the bristles are far too soft so instead of getting into the corners, the brush bristles simply bend without cleaning.<br />The head is also too large in my estimation and isn't able to twist in those tight corners.<br /><br />Why is it so hard to make a proper wheel cleaning brush?  If all you ant to do is clean the tire, then it's OK I suppose.<br />I'm going to cut the handle down so that at least I can use it in the open areas.
B000LNU41Q|5|Works great.
B0012BL8LG|5|A must addition to the cool container.
B00KF9180W|5|VERY GOOD QUALITY !!
B005STE0L8|3|Didn't fit well but ok product
B00LXKMPR2|5|Seems to be the exact part. Good price
B00IACGFOA|5|Good value for the money
B003ANRYH6|3|This brush was just okay!  It did not go into the small inserts that I would have wished, which was mainly to remove the remaining wax.  It cleaned up some what, but it was too large to get into where I needed.
B000C5HHO0|1|This part did not fit my 2002 sport trac.
B005R57J34|4|Good value
B0009SS6GS|5|Good product fast shipping
B00SOG8XTC|5|Love this top got so many compliments on it!!! I'm a DD and very small a large fit just perfect
B0035UDHZ2|5|Works great for putting in moose bibs
B0000CBJE7|2|Only had this since the first of May.  The display is starting to fail.  Blinking : is gone, as is the lower half of the numerals on the right.<br />I will not buy this again.
B00NX4BRKM|1|Two hundred miles on this and it tore apart...
B0085OLNP4|5|Very cute well made
B00E1JO822|5|My Vulcan 1700 looks awesome!!!
B004RNR9QY|5|I liked it
B001TJ70ZE|5|Love them!!!
B00AMA16GU|5|well made,packaged correctly sprayed with oil and wrapped, exact fit
B005NLQAHS|5|This things works great . Very low price . I've had it for about a week now with no problems
B00JGC7TCK|5|excellent product, highly recommend
B001DRPA0Y|5|Looks to be very well- made; installed it just the other day.  Too early to tell anything beyond that.
B010TWOQGW|5|Excellent workmanship, fast shipping, great packaging protection and most importantly, they work great.  Couldn't be happier!
B00K3XWC7S|4|ABOVE AVERAGE
B00M5DGZ04|4|Easy to install and much cheaper than at a dealership
B00E5OUOCQ|4|2015 Hyundai Genesis Coup, fit is pretty spot on.  Time will tell how the material will hold up, but so far all is well.  Packaging did not include a &#34;how to re-fold product&#34; instructional guide.  Trying to refold the sun shade to fit in the provided sleeve holder is too time consuming to me.  Overall a good product.
B0002MBKAA|5|Love the grip and real easy to put on
B0017KMLCM|1|They dont fit and I can not return them!
B001LA4IY2|5|Just what I wanted!!!
B0094BM6AI|5|Works great
B001AIZ5HY|2|Needed all sorts of other things to use the product which were not described in the write-up.
B00CPGQ2DG|5|Durable, light weight. Does the job perfectly.
B00XWBT9Z6|3|I got it more as a trash bag than anything, so for that purpose it works Ok.  It is much bigger than I expected though, so it is rather bulky and it gets in the way.  The space for the tissue holder is rather oddly shaped and closes with a think Velcro strap that does not look very secure.  Considering the price and the use I got it for, 3 stars is about right.
B0009IQZPW|5|Outstanding Product.
B0016KA9PY|5|I have a 1998 Ford F150 with a 5.4L V8.  I purchased the Tekonsha 3035-S Brake Control Wiring Adapter and this unit worked great.  I used this unit to stop my 5500 lbs travel trailer.  This unit might not be as fancy as some, and it is a time delay and not a proportional unit, but it does the job.  Took a few minutes to set the output and to get used to it.  But it is definietly worth the price.  I will probably only use this ten times a year so it will be perfect for me.  Good deal, worked well, and with the adapter easy to install. Adapter Link: [[ASIN:B00QRWQR48 Tekonsha 3035-S Brake Control Wiring Adapter for Ford]]
B000EFOZEI|1|It looks good out of the box but when I tried to put it on my car the peace of wier came of
B005CLMYOW|5|15 minutes to install. Perfect fit. (dealership wanted $175.00 installed) I paid less than $10.00 total.
B001NZKPS8|5|exact fit for my avalanche, very easy to install.
B00262BBZ8|5|Exactly what the doctor ordered!!!
B00NX8EYFI|5|Daughter loves it
B006RYX0QY|5|It's Red and it's sticky, kinda slippery also.
B00LNOK4E4|5|These led lights looks awesome on my Platinum Sequoia. They are superwhite and gives my car a really clean look. As for road brightness i would prefer a higher light out put. But my new 6th gen headlight bulbs makes up for it. These are only good for fog lights even though they will fit headlights.  Next on my list is the turn signals and interior lighting which i will purchase from JDM Astar.  Fast shipping too.
B010Y5RKCQ|5|It covers the tires and the material feels like it's of decent quality.  They fit and go on easily.  Hope they last in the southern Arizona climate.
B001NAP2D6|5|Great replacement for the OEM and easier to change with the bolt end.
B00WDSVEE8|5|I got these for my daughter for driving because prescription sunglasses are too expensive. So far she likes them, the flip up feature is what sold me.
B006TWUD7S|5|Priced right, fast shipment, easy to install and comfortable.
B001LHVOVK|4|Works like it's supposed to. Saved me a ton of money already. Most shops charge $75 just to scan your codes. Done suto parts store donut for free. But for the price you can get this and just keep in car. It does not clear airbag lights but will tell you if there's anything that needs to be looked at. I've found bad Ford COP's with this as well as crankshaft position sensor faults. Very easy to use.
B00JXW0S76|5|A+
B00K8VQE7Y|3|The corners seem to curl in and it gets hot to handle when you have been using it and now need to put it away. I wish it had one thing in the middle to keep it closed rather than two elastic straps at the end.
B00B5QIIXY|1|cost over $200 and although it did come with 2 fittings, neither was the one I needed for my first job with it.  Had to drive to town and spend half a day just looking for fittings so I could use it.
B00069CN2I|4|Great fit! Took a bit to get use to but overall they are a good product at a good price.
B010158IYI|1|This does not fit a 1997 GMC 1500 pick up .Not like the Photo just the grill.
B002KCWWFC|4|It's grease. It does what grease is supposed to do. One of the packages was leaking when it got to me. Maybe they should be sealed a little better for shipping? the container fits in my grease gun perfectly.
B00KM7NWGA|4|Great product..Great seller..fast shipping..and arrived as advertised.. A±±±
B00CRQSYY4|5|looks like it will be a great kit
B0067NHRPU|5|sticks out great on the back of the car, and looks awesome
B00ZGHU7RI|2|A real rip off here for the cost of this hat it should be a sturdy well made cap and it's not. Attractive but flimsy and its price is at least twice its value
B000CLMOQK|1|Perfect for my CJ.
B00N3UGY40|4|A good product. Fairly priced!
B00RSIIKP4|1|Horrible product because the sound is &#34;tinny&#34; with all treble and no bass.  I have NEVER had to turn my volume up all the way, but I had to with this item just to hear the bass-less music.  Tried multiple advanced trouble shooting techniques, but to no avail.  Dealerships couldn't even explain the problem or why the aux cord delivers such horrible quality.
B003VXN794|5|Thoroughly impressed with this cover.  It is rare these days to find an item, any kind of item, with the high quality produced by Undercover.  The delivery was set up, very easily, and shipment arrived within the three-hour window I had arranged.  The Packaging was simply heavy cardboard, with the Cover packed in a very large plastic sleeve, and further protected with foam pads attached to key points as well as around the hardware, which was also carefully wrapped and taped.  The Installation was done in less than 30 minutes, including reading the instructions (customized to my specific truck model - 2012 Ram 1500 5.7 Hemi).  I installed the cover myself, however it would have certainly been easier with a helper to assist in lifting the cover onto the bed, but no sweat, it was more awkward due to the size, than the actual weight.  Installation was a snap and the instructions were clear, detailed, and included pictures.  I have yet to find ay flaws with this purchase: the Made in USA quality is outstanding, the fit is perfect, including the locking mechanism.  The overall build is within very close tolerances, fitting like a glove.  The price may seem high, but given the quality of the Cover, I have no regrets as I know this will be the last Cover I'll ever need for my truck.
B000GQA8DC|5|excellent
B008D6YGE4|1|Garbage. Cheap metal pieces that don't fit and scratch your car. I returned immediately.
B00RW7X1QE|2|I installed these wipers in August and they did a pretty good job, although they did leave a little streaking thru middle of windshield. Now having driven in heavy snow and slush twice I find the wipers to not be good at all.  Snow sticks to the blade and turns to ice and I'm out knocking the ice off the blades. No fun. That lasts about 2 minutes and ice builds up again. At this point these wipers are dangerous cause you can't see. Back to auto parts store for the ones these replaced. They lasted 2 years and only changed cause they were getting a bit noisy.
B0081HPGBW|5|as described.  easy to install
B009J3L4RM|1|Junk. They work for maybe two weeks then flicker and random leds go out. Not worth the money. They replaced them and the new ones do the same thing. Just a crap product.
B004ZF3Y40|5|Completely satisfied these are since if the best hid it there
B007II3B6M|5|Starter works great, cranks every time. Would buy from this company again.
B000E9QF0Q|5|Mothers products are great.
B00YNNAXKM|5|Look and fit great.  You have to drill one hole but I have an angle dill so it was not a problem.  The fender well edge is not very wide on the front like the back, so you have to be more careful as to where you drill your hole compared to the back.  Other than that, it was also Easy Peezy!
B005NLQAHS|5|This product did everything I expected it to do within the capabilities of my vehicles.  The important thing was that it allowed me to monitor the idle, throttle body valve, and oxygen sensors while my wife drove.  I'm having issues with idle when I come to a full stop and I was able to eliminate a few items from the possible problem list.  I still haven't figured out the issue, and neither have the dealership mechanics, but I don't think it's a mechanical issue in the engine.  This tool was great in helping me eliminate possible causes.<br />This unit does what it says it will do as long as the systems in your vehicle are capable of communicating and tracking all the systems.
B00BCRMAAS|5|As described
B00EMK0T4Q|5|thanks
B00JLJTEUI|2|Doesn't work for a 2004 Kia Rio. The knock sensor reading came off for about 3 hours then came back on after driving it some 50+ miles.
B00ABZBS7S|5|My gf loved them.
B00D7N8HRK|1|It was bad out of the box didn't work at all
B00A7KVEAS|5|Bought these for my boys!!! They loved them!!!
B00EDQPBL0|5|This was a perfect fit!
B0049481YA|1|this part caused my air conditioner compressor to run continuously.  I would be very careful before I purchase this product as a replacement for a 2009 Chevy Tahoe LT with flex-fuel (replacement for part# 25928676).  It caused a problem that led to months of diagnosis (since I assumed the new was working)...
B00KY08J68|5|EXCELLENT
B00MPAJ4CS|3|They were not the heavy-duty type original to our Odyssey but were adequate for the price.  We are concerned how long they will last.
B00029KA7C|4|very pleased with this purchase
B00D9C2CDO|5|This is one of the best products I have ever bought<br />Easy to use, cheap and it protected our bags in the rain ,sun for a 15 hr trip.
B00L40ESW6|5|Enjoyable.
B002ZBWKAU|3|Small, takes a long time to inflate a car tire. Does okay on bike tires.
B000MD4YNY|3|After using the product on a couple chores, differential services mostly, it leaks from the pull handle and the gasket at the hose end of the body leaks as well. I've since upgraded to a pneumatic unit and this one has been tossed aside.
B008VPV8WU|4|Did the job.
B00RV46YBC|5|Gives my truck a complete different look. At night is where everything really standout.
B00EECM5FI|5|I have a 07 G35 and bought these to replace the stock Phillips D2S in my projectors which were fading over time. Value wise you can't beat these bulbs. They look amazing and cost a fraction of what an OEM bulb does. I also have an Kensun HID kit which hasn't failed me yet in 2 years so I expect these will probably last also. Delivery was fast and it's a super easy install.
B010N7RW2S|5|I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest.  Luckily I don't have the chance to use it to jump start my car yet. It came with alligator clips, one Micro-USB cable, one wall charger and one 12v socket charger to recharge in car.  A few pictures have been uploaded here and I will update again later.  -- Aug 27, 2015 --  Sorry it took me a few more days to complete the review as   1. exterior The soft black plastic feels comfortable to hold and it is  NOT as heavy as it looks! The carrying case is a very nice bonus for organizing cables/chargers and the unit itself. There is a small back-lit orange display shows its remaining capacity in percentage. It arrived with 95%.  The jumper wires are *short*, strong, high quality cables. I managed to see that they are rated at 10 AWG, which means it will be enough to carry large current with no problem. Also DC current does not like to travel over long distance, therefore the shorter the wires, the better (more efficient, less loss)!  Overall quality does not feel cheap at all and well made.  2. Functions are pretty straight forward: Slide the power button to turn on the unite; holding the round button to turn on flashlight plug in USB cable to charge my iDevices; connect the alligator clips to jump!!  -- I still couldn't find an opportunity to use this main feature. You know I don't look forward to it.  However this product is a cheap insurance that brings a peace of mind, knowing that I have it ready in my car.  I can also help others. Just like I always brings a portable pump mounted on my bicycle, used it three times this year by others on the bike trail but I never actually used it on mine.  I do have AAA membership, but hey, why trust their slow response, not Anker? I had a bad experience with AAA but they are still a good cheap insurance to have.  Everybody should have this kind of product for emergency in case of a dead 12v battery. Also considering it is a flashlight, a large enough power bank to give a full charge to my iPad Air!!!
B001KS2PXQ|5|Yup.
B007TY1TJQ|4|Good Job!
B0085I1DL4|5|Road cross country and back with this back rest. Works very well, is comfortable releases/inserts easily. Great affordable product
B003VASC7O|1|Beware, unlike the pictures posted, this is just the jam nut that is UNDER the chromed cap.  The price is highway robbery for just the nut but I was thinking it came with what was in the picture.  Buyer beware.
B00LE0CDCS|5|Ran along side of roofline on motorhome and added gutter extensions. RV's should all come from the factory this way. Looks good and works good.<br />Will be hoping it lasts a long time. Treated it with 303 protectant for the sun.
B00843V6KI|4|Came on time and worked great for my Motorcycle Safety Course
B007TD1WIK|1|didn't last long
B0063U45K2|5|fit as expected
B000QJMZ58|5|Item was as described and shipped on time!
B0006IX87S|1|Horrible product. When used, it would output half the amount of water pressure and minutes later slow down to a trickle.
B00EA0ZB7I|5|very bright, used on jku rear bumper under neath
B00ASY23HQ|4|I would have given higher.  However I know it's a &#34;replacement&#34; however it doesn't fit perfectly for a honda pilot...  all the way up to the back bumper then nothing to secure it to. Had to make shift it
B000C9GYOA|5|Great
B004VRO19Y|5|love these
B00V2VF5GU|5|Arrived on time as said.. Awesome light for the $$ will order more
B004A2BBOI|5|As promised
B002N5W8Q4|1|Terrible. DO NOT PURCHASE. I bought one a year ago and it worked just fine, but getting the batteries in or out required brute strength and a crowbar. Then, all of a sudden, it stopped working for no apparent reason. I tried brand new batteries, checked the connections, the contacts, but didn't see anything wrong with it. I ordered a replacement last week. Well, It didn't work from the get-go, right out of the package. Trying to insert and remove the batteries seemed even more difficult than with the previous one. Once batteries were re-installed, I tried everything again, checking every possible reason why the damn thing wouldn't work. I'm done with this poorly designed fan. I will never buy this product again. Amazon gave me a full refund and I then purchased a &#34;CAMCO Fridge Airator&#34; instead. Worked fine out of the box and battery insertion/removal is a breeze. Only thing is that it doesn't have an &#34;ON/OFF&#34; switch. Fine, I can live with that. Valterra needs to re-design or just discontinue this badly designed/constructed simple fan.
B013PNRNPS|5|This decal is super cute and came way earlier than the expected ship date. I'm so excited to give it to my friend for her new car!
B0108EYWU6|5|Perfect, colorful, easy to put on and keeps the wheel from burning your hands.
B0049MX8N6|4|Solid and good fit. Instructions were complete.
B005C57M4A|5|Love it!
B00MQD99LU|3|I ordered the lights they come a day earlier and I check them out they looked good but the wires was not really solder on them well I had to take off the solder and put them back on with more solder. Overall they look good at night but during the day time I can not really see the light. You get what you pay for.. and I'll give this a 3 out of 5.
B001UFXHQI|5|great price!
B00BVPOC20|5|Cheap oem replacement
B00NE1G8C6|1|This product fits  on my 98 blazer but has different connector
B000PUG0JK|5|As advertised. No issues
B00ANZHG4U|3|bought based on other reviews, but I find these are thinner and flimsier than what's sold for cheaper at Costco.  Won't purchase again.
B00IRWFQUW|5|I love them
B00GXRG4L8|5|just try them you want buy from rags from any where else
B0028JLO3I|1|It arrived broken
B002VR5LLI|4|Very good quality build on this alarm disc lock. Alarm is a bit sensitive but I guess that is a good thing.
B0002M9PC0|5|Great product at a low price and fast shipping.
B000CFQIIQ|5|Item As Described, Well Packaged, Fast Shipping, Thanks.
B00GYI1YCK|4|The trunk matt fits perfect and works well. the other matts are nice, but the front ones are a little small for my Chrysler 200 width wise. I'm not sure why they are so small.
B00FPR1SXG|5|Love this stuff, great price too!
B000CMDCUQ|5|Worked perfect bolt on for any any Chevy 2500 hd in the years and sounds amazing!
B00KTIQLXI|5|This key was exactly what I needed.  It was easy to have cut and easy to program with the instructions enclosed.
B00JK327VS|5|I purchased this set of jumper cables to replace an old set of mine whose inner copper wire became exposed. I was looking for a longer set, because too much stretching on the old set is what ripped the line in the first place. These are a good length and allow for some wiggle room to be had between cars. This set definitely seems more sturdy too.<br /><br />The clamps grip easily onto the ports, and best of all, these cables come with its own carrying case so they don't flop around and tangle in my trunk. I appreciate that nice touch.
B000PWX4IS|5|excellent item excellent price
B0016KH254|1|Did not fit!
B000VU7M4Q|5|Makes getting in the back of the truck very easy no pain to my knees
B000WMHGIA|5|Solid, functions well with no leaks, easy to install, and small enough to fit unobtrusively on my MTD dash.
B004BTAJ2A|5|This fits perfectly on my 2007 Honda Accord. I read where some people had a hard time putting it on. It took me 30 seconds to realize that you cannot stretch the piece to fit it. The key is to start at the top, pressing it in place, then continuing to press down a small section, inch by inch. It took less than three minutes to put this on.
B000FW4LLW|3|good
B00BYG72Y6|5|This is a very well designed sun shell.  I chose it over the other heavy duty options because I liked the extra support bearing this incorporates.  Still going strong.  Pulled a 5000 car/trailer for about 800 miles.  no problems
B007LICL56|3|These do not fit on either my  2010 dodge ram or my 2012 camaro !! Waste of money !!! Most vehicles dont have bolts attatched with there plates it just screws in !!
B00C8YOPE8|1|Did not fit, wrong size listed. Had to file down one of the prongs to make it fit. Not very bright and poor light distribution.
B00KL51IK0|5|Good price. Fast shipping. Had to change my connectors but it works well and was WAY cheaper than other Mercedes alternators.
B00YF513ZC|4|Nice price, great service .
B00BFWJQTS|2|This suit is not SCTA legal<br />&#34;Those perforations are not allowed, except in an area of about 3&#34; x 4&#34; in each armpit.<br />You may sew leather on the inside of the suit to cover the areas outside the 3&#34; x 4&#34; area.<br />That would be the easiest way to fix them.<br />The leather patches must be sewn on, not glued on.&#34;<br /><br />For the cost savings over a custom set I can afford to have a local guy cover up the perforations, but its irritating when they are sold as being legal.
B004AIIVUO|3|Good replacement, but door handle connection had to be modified it kept coming out.
B000FQ1P8A|5|Well done. Package complete. Shipped quickly.<br />I am satisfied.
B0002JMF98|5|I have a professional R-12 vacuum pump and needed to pull a vacuum in my R134a vehicle. I didn't want to buy a new vacuum pump just for this as I sometimes need the capability to vacuum different applications. This adapter makes it possible for me to use my modern manifold set with the older professional vacuum pump. The shipping and packaging was very good and reasonably priced. This was a great value since there was not anyone locally that even had this kind of fitting.
B00GDLZ1HW|5|nice item
B00PAQJWB2|5|VERY GOOD LIGHTS MADE VERY; GOOD QUALITY ..<br />ONLY THING I CHANGED TO MAKE IT TO MY STANDARDS<br />I CHANGE THE SIDE MOUNTS BOLTS FROM STEEL TO STAINLESS STEEL.
B000C2OAXY|4|they turn clockwise. would not fit my 95 f150 with a 5.0. must be for a 5.8L.
B0088ARGH4|5|This has an awesome look and great sound!  The tips come off, so that is even better when I go off road!
B009MP9DJI|5|fits good
B0051NNPTO|4|So far, so good.  It is a bit difficult to fold up, and I question it's durability, bit it has been great so far.  Easy to install, 90% water tight.
B00CQIUJ4G|3|Not a high quality finish
B00120KDC2|3|Didn't fit as well as I thought they would. Gap around the driver's side mat next to the door which lets debris fall in.
B00RNK7Z6W|5|Great full finger summer mountain biking gloves. Great fit and have held up to a lot of riding this summer.
B009NOZ5C2|5|The Philips automotive LEDs are top notch as far as their overall production quality goes. Only time will tell how long will they actually last. I installed the Philips X-treme Vision 30mm Festoon 4000K LEDs for the dome lights, and also the Philips X-treme Vision W5W (T10) 4000K LEDs (127994000KX2 = 2-pack, unavailable on Amazon-US, but available on Amazon-DE: http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00OYT11RE ) for the map lights, all in my 2001 LX470. If you're not too crazy about the latest 6000K bright-white trend, the Philips 4000K LEDs provide a warmer white light, yet whiter than the incandescent bulbs.
B0082365AQ|5|Product is perfect for my use, It hold the canoe and allows me to move it around.
B011ANN5NE|2|I have a 97 Wrangler TJ -<br />Front seat covers fits - Looks and feels cheap (Explains the price)<br />Back seat covers is not recommended for my jeep - I don't have the seat with head rest, covers are loose and unless you want the elastic straps showing in the back, do yourself a favor and get something else.  My wife hated it and so did I.<br /><br />The only reason I am giving a 2 stars is because of the mats, they look like good quality, however, they do not fit my jeep.  on the map it shows that I should cut it, however I would have to cut a piece from the side as well.  I kept it in the car with the front covers, but am not happy.<br />Might just come back and post pictures.
B007V1R7UM|5|Took me 10 minutes to replace it myself. Perfect fit.
B00MLIKZH2|5|Attaches well after carefully reading directions.
B006R5QI4Y|5|My sunroof really made some bad noises, but after i used this grease it's like new!
B00GHT8NM0|5|Item replaced existing great
B00W47NSYM|1|Just so so wouldn't buy again.
B00199DPWQ|4|Good stuff. Looks stock if you remove the flame sticker. Made in China in case you were wondering.
B004JBQ44W|5|Good deal good service
B0002SPCBC|4|Excellent product. Works as promised.
B004TULFHE|3|Easy to install. Worked very well as a replacement to my mirror that was broken by a passing car.
B004A0IPAI|4|works fine so far.
B00KWRMHVG|1|Light stays on even when the switch isn't turned to 'on' position. It can potentially drain your battery. Not a recommended OEM part.
B008BR6UKI|5|Factory quality, could not be more pleased with it.
B00U868BN4|4|4 stars cuz I have nothing to compare it to.  Seems to work, blue light comes on. I plug it in every time i get in the car.  Works great for getting rid of vapor, smoke smells.
B006B7Z736|5|Awesome, sounds very good
B007ISGOPC|5|Works and fits perfect on my 36&#34; scag walk behind.  Has a Kawasaki 14.5 motor, just pulled it off to clean it for the first time &#34;20hrs&#34; seems pretty dirty so I might check it a little sooner next time!
B005K01GSA|5|Great idea and good quality
B003UVCY00|5|This is the second one we purchased works great
B000QJJ4KW|5|Has a great sound...not too loud, but definitely not too soft. Its a good balance if you want to make your truck sound like a truck without it being obnoxious.
B0007VSHGQ|5|Terrific products in a very nice carrying case, but let's face it, who needs a case.  Plus the rear clip on the clear cover broke the very FIRST time I opened it.
B00K5BDT8O|4|Looks great and works as it should. But on my 2000 f250 I had to grind down the head of the center pin to fit in my factory hole. It held the springs up 1/4 inch or so. Maybe some have a deeper hole but I wish I would have known before I got it together. But it's good now!
B00BUARVM4|1|Not  what I wanted
B000G76OMA|1|this product is a piece of crap....<br />don't buy
B000CGFXB8|5|bought a cheaper pump that didn't work right out the box and returned it for this one and it worked and now I can drive my car... you get what you pay for in hind sight I still saved 100$ since auto zone charges 240$ for a Delphi fuel pump
B000BZI34Y|5|Just what the doctor ordered.
B00DR156K8|3|Fit not perfect, especially a gap at the rear which causes wind leakage and noise. also, extreme noise from roof flapping with windows even partially opened, so must close windows and use A/C.
B001G7GQUY|5|Perfect fit easy to install!
B005G21JP2|5|Great
B0002SA1Z4|3|Product quality appeared good - did not fit my '94 Tracker. Evidently the method of attaching the top changed in '94? My Tracker requires snaps along the front of the top and the product sent has some sort of clips. The rear windows had a different fastening system as well. Be careful if you have a '94 model Tracker.
B00HS0HP6W|4|It was OK,just that rear does not fit
B00OPVYHZ4|3|Works but I would not call heavy duty.  Has aluminum wire and is kind of thin gauge wire inside.  I planned to cut ends off and make it back up start in my derby car but not sure if that will work now.  The service and time to get the product was spot on and nothing to complain there but this product just not what I was looking for.
B000KKLLFS|5|good
B009GLDSTO|5|Both fit perfectlyand shipping was faster than expected
B001EOV492|5|This was purchased as a gift. My son uses it to haul his large boat. It has been a good product for us. Would order again.
B000KPU8F2|5|I always wanted this battery jumper for the long cables and air capability.  It's solid and every part of it functions well.  The only improvement I would recommend on this is to change the battery status gauge to a light bar or digital read out instead of the needle bar display.<br /><br />The key I saw in this unit is the fact that this is heavy and jumpers should stay on the ground and extend the cables to connect to your battery for safer jumping starting.  I had shorter cables on my older jumpers and had to place the jumper on top of the engine.  One time, the jumper almost fell from the initial engine rattle upon starting.<br /><br />Key features:<br />LONG Cables<br />AIR Compressor Capability<br />1700-AMP<br />QUALITY<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B007UTPU1I|3|Beware- this is not fully adjustable.<br />The quality of the product itself is nice.  However, there is a 5&#34; window that the ball will not adjust to.  For example, on my Expedition with the bar pointed downward the top of the ball will reach a height of 20&#34;.  If I then flip the bar 180 degrees so it is facing upward the top of ball height is then 25&#34;.  A difference of 5&#34;!  My boat trailer requires a level height of 22&#34;. I spoke with someone at Trimax and was told to split the difference.  Either run the height at 20&#34; or 25&#34;.  They recommended running it lower.  However, I didn't buy a $160 adjustable hitch to run my trailer 2&#34; off level.<br />You can see in my pictures the disparity in ride height.<br />It is a shame because it is a nice hitch overall except for this flaw.
B00KVMQIPS|5|The dealership wanted to charge us $191 for the same key. It programmed just fine and has been working without any issues for the past two weeks.
B00DSD5MQS|5|It has been on our car for a few months and has not come off.
B00T9BSYM2|3|not as bright as i thought. they were just as bright as the cheap led lights i used for my gauges and also contact problems but they did fit perfect
B0000AY2Z6|2|Bought one for use in horse trailer gooseneck, - moved a lot of air, but much more noise than expected. I normally sleep with a fan on, so usual fan noise doesn't bother me, but this fan had the kind of grating/grinding sound typical of cheap, brush-type DC motors Returned it immediately without issues (5 stars for Amazon customer service)
B005CDNCQO|5|fixed my service engine light
B00GSAUHB8|2|Broke the first time we used it: wire poked through the edge.
B005N766KI|1|Again, the mediums fit like petite/extra small
B004UIUIGO|2|Not bright, by any meams... Can't see the leds in day time, at all. Of your looking for something to simulate running lights, at night, this is the way to go... But don't expect any practical use and once your headlights are on, they won't even be noticeable....
B0009N0W60|4|These are plastic, but the compliment my License Plate Frame Perfectly.
B0002NIL38|5|exactly as advertised
B000K03RDC|5|Walker has always been the Cadillac of exhaust brand's and this muffler is no different. I did not change any of the pipe's on the truck and the muffler fit on the pipe's with no problems. The front hanger was A slight problem as I needed to shorten the hanger rod on the muffler to align with the hanger. If I had A hanger available I would have replaced the old hanger and relocated the new one but the old one was rusty and I didn't want to destroy it by trying to remove it as I am selling this truck and just wanted to replace the rusted out muffler.
B00VWYKJAE|4|Good key for the price , as listed .
B0033WDFWM|3|Installed perfectly on a 2010 F250 FX4. The quality of the receiver is excellent.  I really wanted to give it 5-stars.  The problem was the hardware provided was incorrect.  In the middle of the project I had to go to HomeDepot and get an additional 5/8 nut and lock-washer.  The one provided was to small to fit on the bolts supplied.  Do yourself a favor before you start and put each nut, washer and bolt together to ensure they are all correct.  Its easier to resolve the incorrect hardware before you get it apart on a lift.<br /><br />This video was very helpful:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNPdno9-dV8
B002P8OUBA|3|The mirror looks great and went on easy. However, there is a definite distortion to the image like others have said. Returning it and trying another.
B006359T6M|5|It is an excellent product and meets protection on your keys.
B00JTN5CL6|4|Caps didn't fit, but frame is great
B000CQOIR8|5|It's exactly what I wanted.
B005FKN278|5|You want stopping power, these brakes are it! I took the car in after I replaced the brakes to get tires aligned and my mechanic even commented on how well my Avalon stopped! This was the best price I found on the internet too!!
B00HG2UEBA|4|Product is good and holds the weight. Just a litte shaky but nothing to worry about it stays in place.
B0012INT98|1|Took a trip from New Jersey to Myrtle Beach. Its a 10 hour drive. Product started tearing in certain areas. This started on the first 10 hour drive. It made it back but I highly doubt I would risk it on another road trip.
B00669PCN4|1|The face plate is plastic not medal!
B00NMRTC1G|5|They work great.
B00SVXS3A2|5|Great product for a very fair price.
B00NI7FV06|4|Good
B000IYBE76|5|Plug & play which can't be beat!
B002P8CMK6|5|It as described, fast delivery
B00HF18QUI|2|Magnet separated from base on first use. No instructions. Case is obviously not meant for this tool. Its a glorified level attached to a magnet.<br /><br />What these clowns dont tell you is that its adjustable so you can set/calibrate the level to ZERO so you can use the tool on not level ground.<br /><br />You also need a long buuble level to calibrate the tool to ZERO or a surface you are 100% sure is level to calibrate with.<br /><br />This thing should cost $15.
B0009IQZPW|5|Just as described.
B00LNIPAIU|3|They looked really good and fit my Kia Soul really nice but after a couple months the driver side one started ripping from getting In and out of the car.
B00K5SUHN2|5|I bought this to mount a Cobb Accessport on my WRX.  Works perfectly and tucks the Accessport neatly in the left side of the windshield.  Works way better than the crappy mount that comes with the unit.
B00REXL1DQ|5|Great product
B00SIOMO7W|5|Exactly what I expected and is so bright I like it
B00W5MG8XY|4|It is much easier to check tire pressure with this device than with a mechanical gauge.  The reading stays visible after the gauge is removed from the tire stem, and you are less likely to allow excess air leakage around the gauge.
B0041WSN52|5|Exactly what I was looking for...
B0002Q80GS|4|I installed this handy little adapter on my truck with no problems.  Although at the price you can't really complain it would be nicer to have a stiffer bracket for it to mount on.  It's holding up just fine after 6 months of use.
B00BTLC1YM|5|Exactly as described.
B006GWVBQ8|5|Awesome
B002UC8NAK|5|just what i needed .......matched what i already had
9539752353|5|thank you!
B0000AQQX3|5|Looks good & works great! Very simple to install and makes my 5x8 motorcycle trailer a breeze to move around. Much more professional and easier on the back muscles.
B0081SCR1S|3|Honestly, I'm not completely sure this isn't just expensive Vaseline with a few additives (no ingredients listed). But it did help to revitalize the vinyl on the outside of an old trumpet case and keep it that way for a long time. It has also seemed to help on some very inexpensive leather products but I would never use it on quality leather. For that, get a product like Leatherique.
B00JQ6HUAM|5|I am pleased with the product, met my expectations.
B00UF622E6|5|Perfect
B00QEDJFKS|5|So cute.  Looks great on the back of the car!
B00Y9XX1A0|5|These lights are super bright and very reliable
B005LQIT5Q|2|The windshield was nice but the hardware was not very good made out of plastic
B00CIVI51K|3|I gave it 3 stars because it's probably a good product for the vehicle it matches. I have a 2007 Nissan Titan. The website says this product matches my truck. It doesn't!!! My truck needs a resistor with 4 fins. This product only has 1. It will burn up in no time if installed on an '07 Nissan Titan.
B00IFMOVE6|1|Horrid. Stinks up my car, fshing line construction pokes legs, does not stay in place, and leaves wood dust and pieces all over my truck seats. Total junk. Do not buy!
B002PXEHT0|5|Does what it should
B00XPL88NC|5|After purchasing this item and Joe's Racing model 32307, I've found that I prefer this one. Readings on Joe's and the TireTek are within about 1/2 lb of each other, so I have to assume that each is relatively accurate. I prefer the TireTek because the hose swivels on both ends (while Joe's only swivels on the chuck end), which makes it much easier to get a reading no matter where the valve is located on each tire; also, despite another reviewer's feeling that the dial on the TireTek is &#34;upside-down,&#34; having the gauge face oriented so that the hose exits the gauge away from the user makes a lot more sense to me. Assuming you're right-handed, you naturally use your right hand to place the chuck onto the tire valve, while holding the gauge itself in the palm of your left hand. The reset/bleeder button is permanently oriented so that it can be easily operated with your left thumb while holding the gauge in this manner. If you're left-handed, the button can be operated with your right index finger while holding the gauge in your right hand. It's not quite as natural, but definitely not difficult. Another benefit is that, unlike Joe's, on the TireTek the reading is held after removing the chuck from the tire valve until the button is pressed. The only slight negative I can come up with is that the gauge reading seems to start just a little high (about 1/2 lb or less), coming down to a more stable reading after a couple seconds. However, this doesn't seem like it would be much of an issue unless you're using it in a pit stop at a racetrack (which seems to be the main design goal of Joe's). The angle chuck on Joe's may be slightly easier to use than the ball chuck on the TireTek, but Joe's chuck tends to let more air out of the tire upon removal, where the TireTek releases essentially none. Overall excellent product.
B000S2UGWC|5|I have a 2007 GMC Yukon, on which the original button came out recently. I watched a YouTube video on how to replace it, and decided to give it a try. I purchased this replacement, and had it in for the old one within 10 minutes. This button seems better quality than the original, and works perfectly!
B00AN2L0TU|5|easy install on my 2014 xv crosstrek.
B00EUICJNE|5|Great quality, looks nice!

B003IOITIK|5|So useful in so many situations this has been a big save.
B00V4049K2|5|Definitely eliminated the smell of pizza. Air definitely seems fresher.
B001AVSIOI|5|Perfect lock for my cart rack.
B000I04Z7Q|5|Super Dope!!! I Love the many options this thing gives you and the colors are bright and life bringing to your vehicle!!!! super easy install too!!!
B00QIHC0G6|5|The perfect gift! She loved it!!
B00GUYGM5M|4|Gaskets fit perfectly except you do not need all  the gaskets provided just to remove the intake manifold for a spark plug change.<br />.
B007XUIPZC|5|Just like the original at the best price ! :D
B00JC7MEXS|1|This pen tipped paints are no good. I bought it, used it. No good. First, once you start using this, it dries up really fast. I mean, really fast. Will leave pen marks on the surface. Now i know. Will try the spray. So, for all of you wanting a touch up, use spray not this pen tipped ones.
B0002LWEWY|5|Arrived on-time and fit as described...
B001O07VI4|5|Great
B005UQG922|5|Fit perfect on my 2014 trx 450
B00YIE987K|5|very good like the picture
B00MSSEUBC|1|Warning do not purchase, made of very cheap materials . fall apart after unboxing
B00GSZQ8NE|5|Look really good, time will tell about durability but they installed easily and are a definite upgrade over oem.
B00CZEZNGU|2|It was easy to install and gives plenty of light but the light is mottled with very noticeable yellow spots which makes it unsuitable for reading.<br />The light is now 13 months old (but only used 3 months in my RV) and one bulb has most of the LEDs burned out.
B00FADJ06C|5|Fit perfectly. Glides smoothly across the rear glass, no chattering.
B000COBLOI|5|expression is very good
B0028JQYSS|1|Broke lifting my second front tire.<br />Mind to say this was its very first use and my car weighs only 3000 lbs
B00NRPL45A|3|A little cheap, but so was the price. I got what I paid for and I have no regrets.
B006OQ35GU|4|Very nice gadget as it lets you see that your tank is completely cleared of fecal debris. No guessing!!!  Thanks.
B0054YJ26K|1|Was very disappointed, would not stick to window!
B00QU73LBC|5|Man..l truly loved everything. Thanks Harvey
B00B77NP3Y|5|Great
B003KP48N2|3|These mats fit okay, but they are not as wide as the original Cadillac mats.  (see pics)  They are also harder to clean and not really as rugged as original mats because they are made from household-quality carper material rather then automotive-quality carper material.  There are a couple of spots on the front mat that I can't get out no matter what I clean it with,  The spots were from a spilled disposable coke cup from a restaurant.  For the price, I was expecting mats that were identical to the original Cadillac mats, but the carpet material is not as good a quality.  Also, the backing is not the same as original Cadillac mats and they tend to slide around a LOT more than the original mats.  If you look at the pictures you can see that the corners of the mats tend to turn upward, which is because the backing material is not heavy enough to keep them down.  Overall, 3 out of 5 stars.  My wife wanted these for her new caddy and she was pleased with their looks.  They look great.  Just not as rugged.  The packaging was very good and they arrived earlier than we were told to expect them, which is why they got 3 stars rather than two stars.
B000X20CHQ|4|Good.
B00F9IYI2Y|5|I got exactly what I needed.<br />Thank you
B003CK969Q|2|The rings that were there were perfect and luckily they were the ones I needed but not all the ones in the picture were included with the kit.<br /><br />But Amazon customer service made it right!! Kudos to them.
B0009XDITS|4|Hangs a little lower than I would like.  About 2&#34; below my bumper.  That affects my departure angle quite a bit.  I rarely go off road so I can live with it.  Easy enough to install.  I was lucky in that my frame already had a 1/2&#34; hole on each side in the right place for the middle bolts.  I only had to drill 4 more.  The hitch came well packaged and with all needed hardware and instructions.  I'll be using this mostly to support a motorcycle carrier so I went with the class IV receiver.
B00NJYIWR2|5|good stuff
B00CNDYYJA|5|Excelent i receive the &iacute;tem at time.
B006SMIL4Q|5|good

B00B1I19U0|5|Can't argue the quality is not there because that would be lying! Wonderfully fit in my 2015 Mazda 6. The real question does it insulate, yes it does its job pretty dam good. When you use it don't forget to place visors down to hold it in place. Any questions just ask! I'll post a picture sometime soon
B00B5WH7NK|5|After hours of digging i finally found the perfect match for my 2011 r6! Arrived within a week as well.
B00KTHV5SK|5|Saved me a ton of money switching the parts out!
B00XN37CYI|5|I freaking love these mirrors. I installed them on my 1999 F250. I added the wires for Heat, blinker, and running lights due my truck didn't have them. Good quality. I ordered and set from Ebay just like these ones and they were crap. Mirror was like looking into a funhouse mirror. Anyways
B00U9WLVD4|5|fit great and looked good.
B008M4R5NG|5|EXCELLENT
B000GV9FIQ|5|Just what I needed
B008G35TB8|5|Item was received must faster than advertised. They fit perfectly and was very easy to install. I'm a woman without a lot of mechanical abilities but between my grand daughter and I, we got them installed in no time. And what a difference they make. I can actually see at night now.
B001GG29QK|5|Looks great!
B0047M5232|5|Ordered this because my rear driver's side window wouldn't go up (2005 honda civic) and I had already replaced the regulator (thinking it was that...but it wasn't.. so I basically wasted $55 there!) Anyways, long story short -- I ordered this master switch, it arrived very quickly (even though I don't think it was eligible for Prime...)  we installed it, and now my windows are all back to normal again! Very happy with the product quality & price!
B00HEB2XEO|5|Works well. Rather easy to install.
B008KZKJ9O|5|Great purcahse to protect your SUV cargo area....

B00C5Q3RZC|3|Soft aluminum can strip, &#34;anodized finish&#34; chips/scratches with first installation. Have gone through 4 because of 2 being slightly over-torqued and the other 2 catching a small burr on the stud and having the threads ground to nothing.
B008BT33CY|5|Nice! Easy to apply and seems durable.
B008G2KXII|5|great buy
B00K007R6U|1|4 of them in 300 sq ft of space and can't smell it.
B00CTLGSZO|4|Great item. Was fairly easy to install. Only problem was that to put the screen where it should be (in middle of console) I didn't have enough cord (have an F-150 supercrew).  I really wanted it for the weekend so I didn't want to wait for an extension to be sent so I had to put the screen to the left of steering wheel but it has worked. In use it has worked great.
B00TQ07IOQ|3|The price on these is great when you really need some sort of protection for your floorboards, but though they say they are made for your model car, they did not cover the full space of ours.  There is ample space unprotected.  They cover the majority of the areas, but could have been better.
B004SFKJIQ|5|Dude it's a portable toilet ? As long as it works que no? This is a great deal for the $
B0090DXBEK|5|I had this cut at the local hardware store. They said they charge $70 for the same key. I programmed it myself following the instructions from a review of this product and it works like a champ! It even has the Toyota logo just like in the picture.<br /><br />I bought this key and a remote off of amazon, I think I spent $30 total. Dealer wanted $350 for a spare set!

B00171NO5E|3|Ordered this on the 29th of June 2015 received it promptly. Put it on my truck in July it is now Aug 23 it is already showing rust where the two pieces bolt together. I will remove it and cover it with Rhino liner or the equivalent, but with a name like go Rhino you wouldn't think that you would have to. Disappointed in the purchase of this product and wouldn't recommend it to a friend unless you were going to paint it anyhow.
B00074Q2A6|5|this is easy to set up and take down, the directions were excellent,  very sturdy construction.  using this with our 5th wheel camper eliminated the movement when in the bedroom area over the 5th wheel.
B00WO4ZYI8|2|Too long for my Toyota Tacoma day running lights
B00NFYQTX0|1|Started to rust after a few months.
B000C5A11G|2|Grease cap tore in half after about 6 months.
B0023VIVCS|5|Fit perfectly and looks great. Great price, fast delivery, and good quality.
B000AME4VE|5|It's ok
B004A34G94|5|Good!!!
B000JZZPT2|3|not a direct replacement for factory exhaust. oem pipe is 2&#34; od these are 1 7/8 ID.  i had to sawzall the inlet down to like an inch left then go to parts store and get 2 - 1 7/8 od to 2 id adapters and mig weld them into the mufflers. you will need to shorten the inlet to clear the opening and rear hangers.  they fit over factory pipe then. outlets worked fine with factory aluminum tips though. other than that it works on my 2001 grand prix gt
B001447VB2|5|Outstanding metal polish for fine knife blades.
B006ZBPHFQ|5|GREAT PURCHASE FOR ME.. ITEM EXATLY AS DESCRIBED !! GREAT PRICE &#62;&#62;&#62;
B00IWQH64M|5|All the parts were well made, fit great and at a good price.
B004C6Q46M|5|Works great and the instructions were spot on
B003YMC06S|1|Very light weight not at all strong enough
B003Y323NC|5|So far so good. Bought this for my 04 F150 triton for a little more performance and monitoring. It works huge difference in stock mode vs extreme mode. Im very satisfied and would recommend to anyone.
B006PAGJXQ|4|Works just as expected.
B0049GE9TE|5|Worked great. Very good!
B00MHZIVHA|5|Great product
B00KUUAEZG|5|Item was shipped promptly and was identical to photograph.  Was a nice addition to a black car for a Star Wars fan.  Amazingly there is few license plates, and this was one of the more subtle ones than those that our available.
B00D1CQVIY|5|Great
B00GD4HIPC|5|Easy replacement, fits great!
B00KUUABHM|5|Great quality, not plastic.
B000X46M14|5|Good product
B001GMX9XQ|5|Super easy installation.  Works perfectly!!
B001KM9C4C|5|Always  great product.
B00VMYV6K6|5|Great product.  Look great and not too hard to install.
B003JOB594|5|You need this and the UV dye if you want to save yourself the trouble of looking for a/c leaks. Saves u alot of time in identifying location of a leak. Did what it claims to do. Nothing else more to say really just that it did work.
B003BZZCEU|2|Didnt even fit in my car at all. The build quality looked pretty good though.
B00J9WVA0O|5|Guys if it says 556 on your 223 bullet. It's the same exact thing
B004A32AD8|5|Great price, fast delivery, worked perfectly.
B003YM8YMM|4|Quick and easy install, glasses compartment tight for curved lenses
B005NLQAHS|5|As advertised and as expected. I would buy again :)
B00APY5WTA|5|It is even better than it looks.  Assembly is simple and easy, attaches to 2 in receiver and the light kit works very well
B001G7HFDQ|5|Installed works perfectly
B000AM8BF4|4|Received it on time.  Product was as described.  Will update review after I've had a chance to use it
B004QQ8N4E|3|Well it did work initially, but it didn't stop any leaks and my car's AC wasn't working just a few weeks later.
B00065ZIJ2|5|I bought this for my sister because her car does not have an alarm. It's easy to use and it fits snugly and securely.
B000J3FOOU|5|Worked great
B00Y3GZB5G|4|Great price and seems very well built. Haven't had the chance to use it yet but it looks like it will do the job well.
B00FGF7MJG|5|Good product they went right on
B00IIOFXVQ|5|My boyfriend loved this jacket matched his KTM bike.
B00A9MO2XK|4|My actuator went out AGAIN!!  So instead of paying ridiculous prices at the Garage to fix this, I found a great deal on Amazon (as usual) and fixed this myself. It wasn't fun to do, but I could do it in about a half hour/hour and my car door lock now works. This cost me a fraction of the price that I would have paid to have someone do this for me.<br />I purchased two of these in case this goes out again. It was such a great price, that I couldn't resist.
B00310T1KG|5|Excellent
B00E3M82XI|5|Fit perfectly - 2008 C300 - Easy install
B00HJ6O4A0|5|Perfect to keep in the trunk for outings.  Have used this at many picnics with my kids.  Have even had a few friends buy it since they love how easy it folds up and cleans!
B00E1SMF8M|5|excellent fit. solved my problems
B00ZG7XYU0|2|No problem with the fit on my 2001 Ford Excurison
B009VTGX2A|2|I installed a set of Bilstein 5100 series on my 2004 Dodge Ram 2500 4X4 Diesel about two years ago.  They have lasted very well but they ride rougher then stock.  I am about to go back to the factory shocks.
B00435RU5Q|5|Perfect.
B00JBJ3J4U|4|Nice addition to my truck
B0080B4FV6|5|I purchased this after looking under the hood of my car and realizing the air filter was disgusting. This can affect gas mileage and a number of other internal systems so obviously I wanted to correct it as quickly as possible. However, after calling around Chicago I was shocked at the price some of the local shops were charging to replace the filter. After watching a YouTube video of how to install the filter, I ordered this and went out into the driveway to embark on home car repair. Traditionally this is the space of the insane and the overly confident.<br /><br />This literally was the easiest thing I think I've ever done with a replacement part. If you can check the oil with the dipstick you can change this. You need a screwdriver and to be gentle removing the old filter. Entire thing took maybe 5 minutes, worked perfectly and was impossible to do incorrectly. Buy this, do it yourself and then endlessly discuss how you &#34;replaced your cars air filter&#34; to anyone who will listen to you.
B00WJI7DFQ|5|Great Buy! Easy to install! It adds a simple aggressive look to my 2015 Jeep. Looks even better at night with the headlights on!
B00J3NPOM4|1|ripped at seam going on
B00N2C0F1W|5|Outstanding Product. Looks just like OEM.
B008DE44L6|5|Tube fit in the tire and held air..
B003154J5I|4|It gets dirty fast and the fuzzy fabric is odd, I had a neoprene like fabric one before that I prefer. But it's easier to put on than those hard plastic rings that I keep finding at the auto stores. Protects my hands from a hot steering wheel and is washable, that's all I really need.
B003RQBKLC|5|Like that it has a long cord which allows you to plug the unit into the outlet and keep it near outlet or move it away if you need to. Also like that it has 2 outlets for 2 different devices like GPS, camera and 2 USB plugs which are clearly marked.
B0046VMT4Y|5|I bought this for my 74 VW Bug. Fits perfect, so far it works like it's supposed to, plugged right into my stock wiring harness. I'm happy with this purchase...
B00YJL8VZM|5|Perfect fit, super simple installation.
B013Q0AMDU|1|This guy is way over-priced. These sell for $38
B001RBCU90|5|Looks good on my vehicle!! Thank you!!
B00CLDXGNC|5|I've had it for a couple years now. It's showing no signs of falling apart. The beads allow air to flow through and keep you cool.
B00XYT5XBK|5|Good product.
B00WA4ARO8|5|Just purchased a new F-150 and wanted something to protect my floors.  These fit great and appear to be very durable.  Excellent coverage.  I also purchased the one for the back seat floor.  Same thing there.  They even extend under the back see so your floor is protected when the seat is up.
B0002SR2RY|5|Works perfectly I use it several times a  week chrysler is having a huge amount of oil pressure sending unit failures this socket is top notch
B00075XCJE|5|I love this.  My only regret is waiting so long to get one.  I have a light duty truck and have always used the rear bumper mount to tow trailers until I bought this.  It fits my Sonoma perfectly although it was kind of a pain to install. I would say the build quality is excellent with nice looking welds.  This thing is way heavier duty than my small truck could ever take advantage of.
B00080QHMM|1|don't waist your money batter repacement is not easy and it doesn't work when you do
B001AIZ5HY|5|Worked well. It took me 45 min.  Most drills are VSR, so it's easy to over speed.  I made a couple of small burns on the first one.  I used regular masking tape too.  I spent half the time on the second and it looks as good as the first.  I would consider my headlights as &#34;moderately&#34; scratched, yet I used only half the discs and finishing compound.  They say to use the rubbing compound, about the size of a dime...maybe if a dime were a sphere; I would say, &#34;apply liberally&#34;.<br />I had this done professionally last year; it cost about $100.  I intend to follow up with a protectant
B00J9PQDQM|5|Got the job done.  No CEL or codes thrown with a new downpipe.
B0006SU3QW|5|went on smooth, and gave my shiny accessory a nice matte finish
B000E3FF4E|2|Ordered these and front brake kit when installing 8&#34; lift on my 2000 F350.  What a mistake.  Poor fit.  Unlike the fronts, which were completely unusable, this rear kit did work, but did have poor fit, when mounting into factory bracket.  These appear to be generic stainless steel braided lines and not vehicle specific.  This is evident by the incorrect thread pitch at both ends of the brake line.  To remedy this, this kit comes supplied with two brass adapter fittings.  Save yourself the trouble and order a better kit, actually designed and made for your vehicle.  Precision metal fab kit costs the same amount and comes correctly threaded, in different colors, and made in the USA!  No adapters necessarily, it just works!!  If only I had known before ordering these.  No skyjacker products for me, ever again!!
B00PJPHEBO|5|Words great, inexpensive.
B007SCODN8|4|I got this for a 2011 Pathfinder SV. It fits well enough. There are a couple indentations that don't seem necessary but nothing that takes away from functionality. It seems this was made for multiple years and my car doesn't have whatever feature those areas were designed around. Overall, functionality is great. I put a couple velcro strips on the bottom to keep it from sliding. Very helpful.
B004QEJ6UQ|5|Well make and heavy duty product.  Worked great.
B009HD7OOG|4|Worked well.
B002JH3SPG|4|Does the job so far - seems a durable rubber compound that should stand up for years.
B00FBKWG60|5|They work great!
B00MOKM99E|3|need to buy screws because the kid that came with it doesnt fit. other then that the bars are good.
B003WE7BBC|5|very good product will buy it again
B0119CHQZE|1|dont fit properly ,very poor fit to factory mirror
B00EPDLB60|4|It is already fraying
B002BASW8Y|5|Let me start by saying that I WAS NOT PAID OR AWARDED, nor do I know anyone with a K&N Filter.<br /><br />This product saved my bike!!!  I have a 2014 Yamaha YZF R1 and I ride it A LOT!!!  I was having all kinds of issues; Lost Power, Stuttering Engine, Hard To Start, Poor Fuel Efficiency, etc.  I started with multiple fuel injector cleaners, oil change and new plugs.  Then I ordered my K&N Air Filter.....  WOW!!!  Feels like my bike rides better than when I first bought it!!!  And the best part is, I NEVER HAVE TO BUY ANOTHER ONE!!!
B00BITRC4Y|1|Cranks wheel knob broke off
B00IFF0G38|5|as expected!
B0094QJNLS|5|It was an exact fit for 2001 Wrangler Sport
B00WG2KD4S|5|great product. a grit guide by color would be helpful
B00RCEIQV2|5|Excellent product
B00M7SLLXI|5|good
B00SWTMZLI|5|Fantastic  levers perfect fit great feel can't beat the price and the came 2 weeks early
B004I0SW1W|1|i had ordered both the driver and passenger headlights in July of 2015. It's now Aug 2015, one month later to the date and the driver side head light show humidity inside the head light. I could only imagine the passenger headlight will be breached as well. Junk don't buy.
B00XUCWK3A|5|Thanks
B001XW20NY|1|missing part,
B00R97VMYA|1|junk Chaina !!
B000ZAR1XY|1|This is a cheap foam seat cover.go buy it for 12.00 at your local auto parts store
B00TIOJR4O|1|This starter seemed like a good deal - before I installed it. Total junk! Lasted two starts, then went South. Won't even make a good paper weight. Stay way from this one.
B0002JMU2U|5|It's very very good buy it
B00NV9UMK0|5|Great kit for the money.  Used  to paint a replacement side view mirror.  used 1 coat of primer, 3 coats paint and 2 coats clear coat and enough product left over to fix the next screw up my son makes while driving my car.
B00CMJB46G|5|I bought this X-Creen on the recommendation of a friend and am totally satisfied with it. The screen cuts wind noise and buffeting to very low levels and has completely changed my biking experience. The mounting system is elegant but setting it up is tricky because the photos in the instructions are too small. Having a friend who had mounted one on his bike to assist helped immensely. Once installed the click-indexed mounts make it easy to change the position and angle of the screen to optimise its effect.<br /><br />I was surprised to find that this screen, the so called &#34;sport style&#34;, was so effective because it's quite a bit smaller than the larger touring size. I bought this one because it came with a mounting kit that allows for both clamp-on and screwed-on attachments while the larger screen available through Amazon has only the screwed-on mount system. There is a clamp-on mount large X-Creen manufactured but I could not find it on Amazon.<br /><br />I used to wear ear plugs when touring even though I have replaced the useless stock windscreen on my Honda CB500X with a taller one. The tall screen reduced buffeting somewhat but as I am a tall rider, it didn't do a good enough job to allow me to ride without incurring the tedious chore of inserting earplugs. Yesterday I rode for a while at 60+ mph and the buffeting I've come to expect, and endure, was gone. I can ride comfortably with no ear protection, even with my face visor up.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B00GSAUHB8|5|So glad I finally bought this for my car. Made a big difference getting into my car this hot Cali summer!  At first tricky to fold up, but only took a couple of times to get the hang of it. Easy to use and durable enough to withstand the hot sun.
B0002KR88A|5|Worked perfect with my sound system switch. No problems
B00JINPJD8|5|Works fine.
B00SJTQTDQ|5|Put it on my 14 street glide brought it to life wow
B00WOY33EA|5|WORKED BEAUTIFULLY!!!
B000T7FKG8|5|sweet
B00V80P9AM|2|Cheaply made worked for a week and terminals broke
B007ZGKKMA|5|very bright best possible light, covered with smaller kc covers to be legal
B000ZN17LS|5|Great looking product.
B000JL52E4|1|This was the second one that I have purchased, when I opened the cardboard box the item was protected with a plastic cover, one side of the item was damaged with a deep dent, the hinge was bowed at the middle and welded only at both edges, the door key out of square. The outside of the mailing cardboard box was not damaged. I have contacted the manufacturer, still waiting for an answer. Will not purchase any more products from this manufacturer.
B00PCP7BBE|5|worked perfect good quality
B000VSOO9E|5|Great experience
B00VZOHVSE|5|great weather connectors
B00CW47YHE|4|Love them! Subtle and very functional
B00B4XBQPU|5|good price. promptly received..
B00RSOX5BC|5|We have a trip through some pretty rural country at night where we have to be very aware of large animals. We have a magnetic mounted spotlight that we have used in the past, however it was a pain in the rear because we had to unplug it from the cigarette lighter whenever we met another car. This Cigarette Lighter Adapter is the perfect solution! We plug the spotlight into this adapter and use the switch to turn it off when there is oncoming traffic. The added outlets are also handy and help to make sure everyone can charge their device.
B004QPCLC0|5|worked like a charm - exact replacement fit.
B0041PY0TW|4|I really like these boots. Well made and very comfortable. You can feel the protection They have and I appreciate that. Would defiantly recommend them. My only wish would be that they could be offered in a wide size, they aren't.
B001OBHB4C|5|The caliper is a solid rebuild. Everything seemed very well put together just holding it.<br /><br />The caliper itself is not like the picture displayed, but that is not a bad thing. The paint is silver and it is treated to prevent corrosion. If you wanted to paint your calipers a different color, the silver is better than black obviously. On it's own you can hardly notice it so that's not very important. The caliper also comes with all the bolts and mounting clips you will need. Seeing as I was putting this on a 24 year old car, it was nice to not have to reuse any of the rusted pieces.The banjo bolt inlet (the banjo bolt was not included, instead it was plugged with a plastic stopper) even comes with two new copper washers which is a very nice plus since these get very dirty from years of use.<br /><br />This caliper really helped me fix my rear brakes. My ebrake line is a lot more responsive when engaging and the car definitely locks into place much better. This was a perfect match for my 91 Miata and I would recommend to anyone replacing a caliper.
B000C9HAVG|1|Part came late.Sent it back.
B000CMH8UG|5|This is a blue transparent tint, which is FAR better to use the then purple blurry tint you buy at WM.<br />Applies fairly easy, just be sure you do all your measuring and cutting with a template you make first!
B00KTIQASY|4|Great quality product.
B00PTNQZTI|5|Excellent.
B009F0V5AK|5|fit correctly on 40 year old jeep and set screws hold it tight.
B002HI7QPA|5|These work very well.  You can put them in the snack baggies and poke holes in them. Or, if you want something larger - used a cylindrical cricket cage (Walmart), and place plastic screening around the inside - fill it and the beads to hold the screen in place. They also recharge easily.
B00J1BQJUY|5|Very nice fit and an excellent cover and protection for an aging dashboard!
B001GPX41K|5|Just like description. Fast service
B010MJ0B8Y|5|Got these for both my truck and my wife's van.  I have considered multiple items but the real selling point for my was the way these attach to the visor.  There are many products that offer the same functionality but you really only need these if you are in an accident and any other product is going to go flying around inside the vehicle during an accident but not these.  I haven't had to use them yet but am 100% confident that if I ever do I will have it within reach due to the strap that attaches the sheath to the visor.  Great product and I have already showed to a couple people and would recommend this for everyone.  For $12 it can't hurt to have it in your vehicle.
B00KPL5VDK|5|Perfect fit as described, easy to install -follow instructions, keeps the finger prints to a minimum in my P85D.<br /><br />Thanks for an excellent product.<br /><br />I think that any anti-glare protector for a 17&#34; screen will do the same job, but I like to support the guys that are thinking ahead with the Tesla and even though this product isn't a new idea, it certainly comes from a new company that deserves my support.
B00BUS5E4S|5|A must have.
B0000AY4YJ|4|Works well. and does a great job
B001V8U12M|4|Came quick and works great
B004JBI6C0|5|Exact match to the OEM part that came in my vehicle.
B000Q0TCX0|5|Worked great on my 2001 Honda Civic
B00HHGSY30|4|As described except the abs connector was different then my stock(2006). Had to switch out with old one. Would be 5 star.
B001SLHPQM|5|very good wheel cover
B000WJCUSE|1|Ordered a throttle sleeve for a 500xlr honda and got one for a smaller bike , good product just not right one.
B00W68A716|1|Extremely disappointed. Not at all what the picture not the description show. The wording if assign iron on and the blossoms look faded. I was so excited to find these and what a let down might as well be fire starter!!!
B001Q4XIHG|5|good product+++++
B00LV4T22Q|5|Happy with it
B00498QBAC|3|First of all, these are the same as the Goodyear Gatorback belts. In fact, Amazon sent me a Goodyear Gatorback belt with absolutely no mention of Continental on the package. Which is fine with me, I don't really care about the recent rebranding and it is made in the same factory.  I LOVE the gatorback belts, it got rid of the idler noise and vibration on my 2005 Toyota Corolla and it got rid of the squealing on my 2005 Subaru Outback. BUT on my 2006 Honda Civic Hybrid this belt actually CAUSES vibration and noise! I put the old space belt back on and instantly the noise went away. I have installed many belts and doubled checked for installation error, it wasn't that. :(  Length and width wise, it is the perfect fit for my 2006 Honda Civic Hybrid.   As with other V belts it can be hard to route it into the various pulleys when this is brand new and stiff. Take your time. In the case of my Civic I had to wrap it around the back pulley (crankshaft?) first, tie it off temporarily with a rubber band, and then route it through the starter/AC and then route it through the tensioner pulley. I tried a few different ways and it just kept sliding off, using the rubber band to keep it engaged on the crankshaft pulley was the only method that worked for me.
B002RSIK4G|5|After installing this, no leaks at all. Even after a summer of heavy rainfall.
B00UHD4HJA|1|Stickers were not the same as depicted in image. Very disappointed with the outcome, can't say I'd buy this again or suggest it to anyone else.
B0097SUGN2|5|good
B00EC2CCZ8|4|slow to rewind sometimes need to pull out try again
B00U6HYWNI|5|HOLDING UP GREAT!! 200 MILES ON SO FAR! EASY INSTALLATION TOO!!
B00UWZCQ7I|2|Images were low quality and blurry.
B006R34PB4|1|very cheaply designed, will not last long. Fire hazard too
B002P8IK0C|5|A very nice high quality  replacement light for my 1994 Ford Ranger .
B0087JQWWQ|4|The modifier is needed when redoing the Mustang taillights  if not they will move extremely fast and will not look right.
B000BZG4Z4|4|So far so good.  Good plugs, good price.
B002R0NP94|5|great value
B00CNEQYF6|5|great
B0007XU4EC|5|worked fine
B0140MVBM4|5|Absolutely superb! !! My kids play football and these babies keep all that mud and grass of of my new carpets. I highly recommend weathertech digital fit floor mats.
B00T0TYXGY|5|Perfect size for my car
B0092ZWDNG|4|Received this product fairly quickly and put it to use right away because this summer heat is a killer.  It didn't quite completely cover my 2014 Ford Escape front windshield.  There is still a tiny sliver of gap where the sunlight could get through.  I have read other reviews of the same product that over time, the middle of the shade will sag so to be proactive, I put my tissue box right under it to help support the giant shade.  It does keep the sun out but without using a thermometer to track the temperature, I couldn't tell if it lowered the temp or not after using it.  The only reason I gave it a 4 star is because after using it for 2 weeks, a small section of the seam on one side of the shade came off so quality seems a bit lacking. I am not one who abuse things and this shade is not cheap (price wise) by any means so I take good care of it while using it and roll it up with velcro in place when not in use.  I still recommend this product who owns the later year Ford Escape because of the giant windshield we have in the vehicle.  A regular size sunshade just won't be able to cover it completely.
B00QWZNAUE|5|Awsome product ... will repurchase.
B00U868BN4|4|I just used this device on a road trip with a friend of mine who smokes ... chain smokes. In the past, after the cigarette is put out and the window is left cracked for a few moments, there is still a lingering cigarette smell and I'm left feeling like I smoked a cigarette as well. With this device, it seemed like the smell did not linger and the car smelled fresher. I gave this 4 stars because I only used it the one time. I find it takes awhile of using something before being certain of its effectiveness. Perhaps I'll come back and write more later.
B00FB3GDXE|5|Love it.  I hate tailgaters.  Didnt want any profanity on my ride so this did the trick
B001P2CKVE|5|This was a replacement and works well so I can travel with pets in the pick up in hot or cold weather.
B000TYVXEE|5|Great product! Fit and worked perfectly!!!
B00W8H4KH2|5|I didnt had a chance to buy this, as the coupon was expired.
B00UK5FCO4|4|Cool lights easy to install
B004VRRCCW|5|just like i ordered fast deliver great part heavy duty
B00TZ8HT5M|4|Sticker was as expected.
B0012ATAZI|5|Great fit
B00NQD21AK|5|Works perfectly with my 2010 Chevy Silverado.
B00G3EAGFG|4|Works awesome for somewhat neglected paint. Used it to remove a ton of rail dist from an 07 GTI that was never washed. I probably could have used the heavy grit clay but this worked. I gave it a 4 star because the gray dye starts to release from the clay, gets all over your hands and makes it hard to see the paint while you're working. It also becomes extremely spongy like after using it on about half the car. I think they need to change the color of the pastic paper that it ships with, I keep forgetting about it and it gets kneeded into my piece of clay :/
B00D2I0IDG|5|I, and my friends, use this scanner often.  I wanted the ABS and SRS.  There is also currently a free Asian upgrade which I have installed and works well.  I use the live data recording often to monitor the systems in different types of driving and then review it with the PC program.  I do wish there was a way to download the live data information into a file so that I could load it into my own database for analysis (Hint, Hint Innova).
B003FWV13U|5|Excellent fit for my 2008 rabbit, and a much better alternative to a $125.00 set from the dealer.
B00ED7LJ3S|5|An excellent decal, good size and it went on easily.
B007AOS8K8|5|Decided to try these over W****T***- they fit like a glove!! Also, any company that posts the Pledge of Allegiance on their website gets my business anytime!!!
B001JQCCFK|3|My fault for not noticing but it's very generic in how it fits. It doesn't fit my cobalts floor boards well.
B001AZVRAQ|5|Go Bucks!!!
B000V2W0GE|5|I bought this for an inline filter in my water system for my camper and works great
B0027XAN78|5|Great product. Replaced my dinky extractor fan in the bathroom on my Heartland 5th wheel.  Its all plastic though (doesn't have the metal frame like my original fan) but pretty solid.  You will have to remove the old fan from the top which means unscrewing it, loosening the old putty, smoothing the remains, put your new sealer on and screwing the new top fan-housing in place.  Then fit the bottom shroud from the inside.  One issue though: on the Heartland the roof (roof + linings) is just a tad thicker than 4&#34; and the supplied bottom insert is about 1/4&#34; - 1/8 &#34; too short to fit into the top part.  They have a part which is longer which you should consider (can be trimmed to your liking).  Ultimately this is a great fan which moves a LOT of air.
B0057I3TVW|5|very reasonably priced, worked perfectly
B009A6XFPM|4|Good quality, I'm thinking they might be a bit higher kelvin/temp than the specifications, but they do work well.<br />Easier to see the road with these than Volvo OEM.
B00F9WKXXI|5|perfect
B0035DLJ2M|5|Works perfectly.
B00PGCD8WY|4|Fits good and looks great
B001V8U12M|5|I went through hell before I had this, because of my health issues I have. With this lucky number, makes it a lot better than what I gone through.
B000S34NG6|2|It worked good but only for two months.
B00XPL88NC|5|very happy with the quality, looking forward to getting it out on the trails and airing down the tires for some fun.
B0018ETWJ2|4|Great quality and fit. Haven't had to use them yet.
B008FYKUBC|4|Has been working great, especially with rain-x.
B009AJBRW2|5|Perfect fit for my 2006 Limited.
B000TYQB14|5|Works as good as OEM product.  Last time I bought it at the dealer, it was over $120.
B001FAM3OK|5|Fitment was perfect and all the mounting hardware made installation a breeze! They have held up for 6months so far and still look brand new!
B0002M9QJM|3|Perfect fit but not so bright
B001NZFCRW|5|Best windshield solution ever used.
B0085OMJ48|5|Excellent product
B000VKM534|1|Does not fit Europe models of wrx sti 2006 and 2007. Could not use it and I was pushed to reuse the old seal.
B0042Z0XWY|5|Excellent product
B000HBNX38|5|very pleased
B000TYJY72|5|Very nice little piece. Looks nice against my black frame and engine. Its a small piece so it doesn't stand out very much, but I really like it. very easy to install.
B0001EW4EU|5|Perfect fit !!
B00K1HPIXQ|5|Fit perfect just like OEM you almost would think it was OEM
B007J0V7MO|1|Fits my dad's pickup truck perfectly. Dad loves fishing and when reversing his truck with his old lights he could not see well if he's driving his trailer straight when putting his boat back up on the trailer. Works great with reverse lights.
B0125VG9MY|5|excelent product very fancy
B002UJVNFA|5|Work great
B001O25GA2|3|pretty small.  Dont plan on putting out much of a fire with this.
B00J7JX82C|4|Nice and good but a little bit small
B001OIRUKK|5|These were purchased and given as a gift to our Grandson.  He was thrilled with them; and we were delighted with the quality.  They fit perfectly.<br /><br />We/He couldn't be more pleased !
B00ETRSD5Y|4|Looks good but be aware letters are not raised as in real license plates.  Looks good.
B00AZTKP4C|5|Fits silverado crew cab perfectly
B011D67O6W|1|didn't fit and they want me to pay return shipping, wtf
B00N9LMXUC|3|First it is not jumbo - it is actually too small for my Ford Edge. Second it absorbs heat and gets very hot to the touch - and heating up the car after use.
B00DHYQFJQ|5|Product arrived in a timely manor, fit well on car. Too early to tell how well product will with stand the test of time but hopefully it'll handle the weather to come.
B00NFIOLL8|4|Good product at a reasonable price. Keeps odors to a minimum and lubes the release valve.
B005BZ87TK|5|Unique, and different from a regular chip. Would buy again
B007JSGR9Y|4|It helped me figure out what was wrong with my truck and easy to use.
B0049MM468|5|It is a great product my car now has air conditioning
B00CWFRFY0|5|Just what we needed (OEM Auto Parts) and it took care of a noise problem that has been hard to diagnose with this model of car.
B000S2QLUI|5|This fixed my AP problem with my 2008 GMC yukon.
B0031BIU16|5|Good product. Takes a little work to install but the results is great. Drops noise level about 4db.
B000WEKMVG|1|After only a week sometimes segments are missing, other times additional segments light making it impossible to read the correct time.
B007V2CB7K|5|Fits and works great.
B00VJUN5ZM|5|Fast Delivery! Great product!
B003VLBPJA|1|Way too small.  It will stretch to 15 inches, but not the size I needed.  The metal hooks scratch everything. I ordered another larger one from Revzilla that has plastic hooks and is the right size.  This is junk.
B00HFRQGZ4|5|I've been keeping it well lubricated with Maxima Lubricants brand Chain Wax and I've probably put 500 miles on it so far with no issues, and I haven't had to readjust the chain yet. Made in Taiwan and it's more of a zinc than a gold, but it works and I'm happy with the product so far.<br /><br />I will update if this changes.
B004HPSI6M|5|working well
B00VZOHVSE|5|Outstanding product, I have bought them in different pin number units and use them on motorcycles, and other vehicles including john deere riding equipment. Great product, you no longer have to fool with the open connectors with the flimsy pins you have to compress with a special tooll.
B008DQTQO4|5|Made camping easy and packing light.
B0027GLTY6|5|These deflector help with the wind. But, what I like most of all is the volume it adds to the fairing. Just makes look better.
B009D3NZBQ|5|Great Decal, easy to apply and looks great on our camper!
B000C40T7I|4|Shock is a bit spongier than I would of hoped in the application I used them in.  I think it is an example of a general shock being designed to work with a range of vehicles and while on some it would be over dampened on others it is under.  For the price they are a nice alternative to stock but if you are going to spend the time to do this yourself you might want to look into spending a few dollars more for something that has some adjustment so you can really dial in what you want your vehicle to ride like.  I wish I had.
B007JW8ROS|1|discoloring already.
B00GHSLHII|5|Its all good so far thanks for the right price for all the stuff i got from you all
B00PJTCG18|5|This is a really nice remote start. The fob's are really slim and look great. The install was a breeze on a 1998 Honda Accord EX. I used an idatalink ADS TB for immobilizer bypass and that integrated perfectly with this remote start using the data cable. I would highly recommend any Excalibur Remote start. So far i've done this remote start, an Excalibur RS260edp+ on a 2012 Subaru Legacy and both have been great! I also did an Avital 4103LX on a 2005 Honda Element and the range on the Avital sucks compared to the Excalibur's.
B00GNHPXWE|5|excellent product
B004U7O0R8|4|Works great
B00F2OL56W|5|Nice!
B0067UERWE|1|The bushing failed within about 6 months. Otherwise fit was okay, but if you're looking for a lasting replacement look elsewhere.
B00062ZZQQ|5|All my vehicles/motorcycles have K&N's.  Always got an additional 1 mpg from them.  Last forever....  Nuff said
B00IB4T0B2|5|These covers are a great accent for your vehicle's paint scheme. Not only looks good but, protects your lights from any elements that could damage your lights. Want to set your self apart from the others, get yourself a set of these.
B000EDSSDY|5|Large, simple and durable.  Toss it on the counter and take a quick look.  When done, toss it in the drawer.  Super convenient.
B00C4B1F7U|4|This was not the easiest installation of my life, but after much effort, we are in business!<br /><br />We needed to use some strong drop clothes on the group for sliding around under the car, and we also used my sons lifts to get the rear wheels off the ground a bit, creating more space under the rear of the car.  This job required effort, strength, and fortitude!
B007P73YSG|5|excellent replacement car
B0006O1ICY|5|Stuff works very well
B00E63TI32|4|I haven't had a problem with the lid. Seems Lifeline upped their game. I agree with everyone else the bottle holds stuff hot/cold a LONG time and build quality is top notch. Two reasons for lack of 5 stars and it's not really Lifeline's fault - it's lack of accessories. 1) I usually use this as a water bottle, not storage. The only easy-open/flip-top lid is $15. HALF the cost of the bottle. 2) I can't find a koozie to fit it. If it sits in the sun the exterior gets HOT. It's bare metal so not surprising, but it needs a cover. Rather than a DIY neoprene sleeve, I used a wool sock and some heavy duty rubber bands. Works like a champ and makes it easier to hold/pick up.
B00D5V961K|5|Worked perfectly
B00CRWMDT0|4|All ok
B00SDMJLQ6|5|fit great
B00APTQEF6|1|I LOVE Snoopy, but..... There is no way to use these - other than to jam them in and hope they stay. It comes w/ 2 suction cups each, but there is no way to attach them (I.e. Rings, hooks, etc...). I tried to reach seller dpdiscount regarding this multiple times, failing each time to get a response!!
B005VNQYVU|4|Genuine part and comes with everything you need.  Look on YouTube for some decent DIY people who have replaced this part. Relatively easy fix.
B00HFLCGJ0|5|Twice the filtering of a regular filter.
B0009IR0QK|5|Everything is great, thanks for the cooperation
B007DZJSDA|4|Easy install only problem is the directions arnt very clear... Great sound and well worth the cheap price tag!
B007ZXXP7A|5|Fast delivery great product
B00K7XNEE4|1|Didn't notice there were different sizes since I looked up the make and model and year of my jeep. The cover is huge and looks stupid on my spare.
B001C6OJ6M|1|This part needs the transmission requirements.  Amazons check to see if it fits menu needs this added.  This part DID NOT fit a 5 speed standard transmission and don't specify any transmission requirements.  I cannot return because I went past the return limit window ( didn't try to replace mount till this weekend ).  Buyer beware!
B009FUFD1C|4|Good for light cleaning but not for pick up lot of water.I will buy again
B0031BCLZ2|5|Great product and great customer service.<br />Charlie/Apopka, Fl
B001O25GA2|5|great transaction. Product as described
B00FCE0X5Q|2|the quality very bad,broken whit vibration
B00DSD5KEC|5|This decal is outrageous!
B005DMEKOW|5|I have a different brand which is more expensive in the front and the coverking covers fit much better. Most people don't even realize they are seat covers
B00HVHX2C8|5|Amazing amazing amazing!!! I love it it's so damn cute and fits perfectly!!!
B002HPFY9S|5|Worked well and then caused radio interference after a year or so
B00EP3PX2S|5|Perfect fit for 2007 Toyota Tundra double cab.
B002E5BW74|4|Youtube the directions and plan on at least an hour. Its a bummer getting the old one out but happy to get all the weird junk out of my vent.
B003SKDGEQ|5|Easy to install.  I didn't have to remove my wheels.  Just turn the wheel one way, then finish up with the wheel the other way.  Secure and fit great on my 2015 Ford F350 Platinum (with no extended fender flares).  I also put the rear set on - very easy as well.
B00DQLCBAM|1|I thought that the product would be better quality. Only use 1 time. Then took them off didn't feel safe with them on my car. First 2 I put on my car the threads stripped. 1/2 . Then the color was coming off. Put on and took product on and off by hand. And tightened with a socket and ratchet set up. for the original price of $89 I thought I would have better quality
B00MJVXBQI|5|Exactly what I was hoping for and expecting.
B004AQYXO4|5|oooooops...i ordered the wrong wrench but i'm keeping it around for my kicker engine. the quality appears as nice as any ive bought elsewhere and the price was right. i just need to read a little more carefully next time...lol
B0054RW1HE|5|saves time with door off bs
B00L9IP90S|4|The delivery was perfect, arrived the day before I started a 2k plus ride. Overall this was great. Two areas to be aware of, first, it raised me just enough for the top of my head to hit the airstream, ride an Ultra Limited. Second, it took about 1k to break in. Much more comfortable on the second half of the ride than the first.
B00FUGKUEA|4|Good quality
B000F3RYGA|4|heavy
B00U7XT1C8|4|Seems as advertised.  Wife loves it. Thanks
B00QQZHCUO|4|good price. nice looking decal. only down side is it took 2 weeks to arrive by mail.
B00NF1PT8O|5|Installation was straight forward, I am very happy with the results. I would highly recommend to anyone who likes to perform their own maintenance. I do not understand why there isn't a factory drain plug.
B00BJJZPG0|3|Difficult to snap front and back pieces together, after many tries finally snapped into place. Overall good product. Easy to install.
B00UB1GS18|5|Very Bright great quality the chrome on the inside makes the light very bright and nice looking
B00FSXK734|5|fast ship fit perfect A#
B00754T6TK|5|I bought this for my son's car.  Worked fine.
B00OVB7LGA|5|It is made from thick, quality material.  I hesitated for a couple of days before I got up the nerve to cut into it.  I laid it out in the sun for several hours to get it soft and pliable.  After measuring and marking it, my shears zipped through like butter!  AND--it fit my vehicle PERFECTLY as though a professional had sized it!  Right proud of the mat--and me! It stays in place and is easy to remove, dump debris and replace.  Simply a great product for the price.
B00D01N454|1|Do not buy ! The top corners of the visor do not stick to the window . It leaves a gap in the top corners Witch when you drive the air goes through lifting the visor . Does not sit flush . The corners need to be round not square to go with the shape of the window . Please keep reading the rest of the reviews you will see the same issue
B00G8E6KFG|5|Good price, just had it cut and it worked perfect in my 2005 R6
B000GBBP8O|5|Product as advertised.
B00KTIUG5C|5|I bought these to replace my old and breaking original Keyless Entry system, and it gave me a spare for my wife. Super easy to program, and worked the first time.
B00FGJIJR6|5|Works fine and received in record time
B000NVW1LM|5|Bought an old jeep for my kid.  Ran a bottle thru and a few of the leaks stopped and we had to actually fix one other.  It is great for the price it can save a bunch of unnecessary work.  Doesn't fix actually mechanical problems, it seems to rejuvenate dry seals.  I don't know for sure, but it was worth the cost.
B00029J3IO|5|Sounds perfect on my e30, quiet on the freeway and raspy when I step on it. Will buy again for the new e30 318ic. FYI Look into some Monza resonator tips, they make a bad ass combo
B003VSM3BC|5|Great!
B00IUV846I|5|I bought this battery to replace 2 autozone atv batteries I paid $70ea for, they are now totally dead and won't even charge after 5mo.  I slow charge them every night because my Boss radio would kill them..  I just have this battery and the radio still on and by the end of the day my voltage (display on the battery) stills reads 12.65 and I haven't even had to charge this 1 yet..
B004I0XIAW|5|great!
B002TXY5KM|5|the gasket will work on the oem stock stud. I suppose some are made 1 mm ticking then others idk. as long as u can get couple treads in u good. another way to do it is preheat it in the oven at 300 degrees just for few mins get it to where it's more flexible and soft then u can now install it np.
B007NVQ13E|5|Perfect!!!
B0068NDBUE|5|Cheaper than the dealership and made the seals work like new.
B0031I4HNE|4|These looked just like the ones that came on the truck and are probably just as good for my purpose.  There are a lot of much more expensive disks that claim to last longer and stop quicker and I can not verify their worth.  I used them on the rear and that is only about 30-40% of the stopping effort for the truck.  They will slide the tires and that is all I need.  At the price I can afford to replace them every time I change pads (100,000 miles) so I think I got my money's worth.
B000C5WD08|5|Same as OEM for 2003 Camry 4 cyl. Fit perfectly.
B00GXRFLY4|5|Excellent Microfiber Towels
B00KYJ23HA|5|A++
B00GYA2MDS|5|bien
B00DPYAGVG|5|Love the decal and received it quickly.
B0065J6D0G|5|Just like the broken one. Installed easily, by hubby who usually avoids such activities.
B00FOKONJ0|4|I was really pleased with this product after reading all the reviews. Was really easy to apply. The shade was a little off but i didn't mind. I must say though that i was a little disappointed that the dye did not last in the well worn areas (small cracks) of my couch. The dye in those areas lasted about 3 weeks then began to fade again. It certainly isn't a long term solution.  But if you love your couch and Hate to part with it this is a good fixer-up product.
B00N5UBQHS|1|Lithium iron phosphate batteries are not ready for prime time. The one I bought lasted 45 days before it died. Don't buy lithium phosphate anything until they perfect the product's dependability. You will get struck in the middle of nowhere like I did.<br />Big waste of money.
B00CT25NIQ|5|Great product if you have eye problems.  My eyes can stream constantly and when riding my bike with sunglasses it only got worse.  Finally came across this product that totally cuts the airflow and now my rides are tear free.  Woohoo!
B00KOQ01UE|5|Great product! Great Deal! Love the look! Highly Recommend!
B0118S90XU|2|Doesn't fit well
B001DUK484|5|here is how to install<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8j7KCWhbzs
B009XOTRBM|4|Great product
B001SR03SI|3|Required some changes to the plastic ducting on the car where the hose attaches - not an earth-shattering deal but it should fit as is. Has worked for 4 weeks without incident - so far so good.
B001GN6YLE|4|Exactly what I needed. I ordered these for my car hauler because I needed some extra anchor points. They are good quality and I think that will last for a long time. I welded them to my trailer for extra security. The only thing I did change was to bead blast and paint them because I've had other metal parts with the same coating that started to rust after a while, but it's to be expected when you're actually using them - very few coatings will last that long when metal parts rub on one another.
B007TD1WIK|2|It was not able to jump start a Toyota car
B011ICD2WQ|2|Does not do everything it says it will do. Had to call company to find out that it would not scan my vehicles air bags and that's what it was purchased for.
B000GTMUUI|5|Good little toggle.  I really like the safety cover.
B00LAQ5XKK|4|cheap, works well
B00JGX2H2Q|5|Works fantastic, great prepper item as well.
B00681BE2S|5|Works great and the price is awesome.
B000NKCIXE|5|The previous owner of my Scion XD have nearly 100k miles on his car, and he never changes the air filter.... Now that I replaced it with k&n the engine and acceleration definitely feels the difference, but on the flip side, the noises coming under the hood are also louder. Also I get a minimal boost on the average MPG compare to the previous average MPG I had as long as I don't step on the gas pedal hard. Overall it does what they claim to be, so 5 stars.
B00VAZ61F2|5|Good quality. Easy on and off. I would have bought two different sizes if base plates were the same size. But unfortunately each size box has a different base plate. It would have been nice to be able to mount two different size boxes to the same base plate.
B00GSAUHB8|4|Very compact when folded and covers the windshield well. So far, so good. Used for about 3 weeks.
B00KTIYXLU|2|Not sure how we'll rate the product as we haven't been able to activate the keyless remotes successfully yet. We'll try again. They arrived quickly though.
B00CTX2CUM|5|Perfect thank you
B00BFDJBJC|5|Perfect fit.
B00R6IKL2Q|4|one was bent
B008ZDYLC2|1|This scanner will not read ABS codes as advertised. I didn't have any ABS problems when I purchased the scanner just thought it would be nice to be able to read ABS in case I had a problem. Now 3 months after I purchased the scanner I have ABS lights show up on the dash. Can't return the scanner and can't figure out how to access the warranty to find out if there is anything I can do. It was not a cheap scanner. I'm really disappointed...
B00M50MGSC|4|This is probably the easiest portable car cover to put on, and I looked thoroughly. The typical ones you find are cheaper, both in price and quality. This is the only one where the back is attached inside the trunk, so you're not running back and forth as the car might slide up the back of the car. The outside is a shiny metallic; a previous reviewer stated after a rainstorm the drops just rolled off. Not true. My car did get a little wet and a sheet of water poured off as I was removing it. There were still droplets after I stuffed it in the truck. Don't even try rolling it, you'll waste ten minutes trying. I timed it and am got it down to 30 seconds. If you've got two people and a nice breeze helping to lift to cover, definitely less time. I would recommend folding in your rearview mirrors if possible, they don't catch the cover as easily. I would NOT recommend this for a car with a stick-up antenna. It would seem more hassle than its worth, and I'd be scared I'd rip the cover trying to get the antenna in the right spot.
B00HSO6NCA|5|Durable. Easy to clean! Love the color.
B00O4Z5XOA|1|Was told this size would fit a F 150 short bed, doesn't.
B001ONKMJ6|5|good deal
B00CWQ8QD8|3|Fell off quickly
B000BPLNPU|5|Excellent spark plug. Works great in my Tao Tao 250 atv.
B003EMGND4|5|bit loose on a 99 wrangler tj but for the price great
B008VJEF4E|5|Great value, perfect fit, no tool need, everything was done by hand.
B00D3OVXUG|5|good deal and quality construction
B00HNL5MV6|5|Very nice gave them as a gift
B00GD2HYQW|5|good
B004AVQILA|4|Fit great and built well...I love that I can still use my bed cover with this rack!  The only thing I don't love is that when I'm on a bumpy road, this thing sqeaks like crazy.
B00PU0MVNE|1|Might work for a mini car but not a standard size vehicle. It's not wide enough to keep pets from coming around the sides, even if one does try to stretch it.<br /><br />Head the words of the of the other review - DON'T DO IT.<br /><br />Unless perhaps you have a rambunctious pet you want to wrap up in it. Ok - just kidding.
B00HPR8WB0|5|Works great
B002Y0CLWE|5|Perfect fit for customers 2005 Scion TC at a great price.
B001EP0HPI|5|I can't say how impressed I was with this adapter.  It is basically a plug and play but you will need to attach the white ground wire to have all your lights work.  Directionals, running lights and stop lights will all function if that is done, (there is NO instructions with this , by the way).  I ordered the Curt 58000 bracket to use with this, hope it fits as well as the adapter.  For the electrically challenged, like me, this is the way to go!
B000GHZMTQ|4|very good
B00029X2N6|5|I got one at another place and it broke, found this one online here at Amazon and it works great. I have no problems with it, and hope to be able to keep it throughout the years so I can pass it down through my family.
B000M8IF1Q|5|great
B00X580PAY|5|Came earlier than expected. :) I'm super happy with my Star Trek sun shade!
B00WZWWTIM|5|My R3 is my first bike, so this is also the first time I installed anything like this. The paper instructions were fairly clear, and I would recommend that you read through the whole thing before starting and also keep the screws you took off in order. It took me about 1.5 hours - though I took my time and made sure everything was nicely tucked and properly installed. The only part I had some difficulty with is the washer stack for the oem lights. I blame my fat fingers.<br /><br />The bracket itself is very good quality; fit and finish is excellent as well. I would highly recommend this tail tidy!
B000FW63CC|1|Does not work with Wilmar W41044 transmission adapter. Had to return this item
B0101U6OVW|5|It's awesome!  Nice quality!
B000BUU5YU|5|Works as expected for an extension cord.
B010VUZDC8|5|Very nice license plate frame.  Shipping was very fast.

B005F2WGMS|5|Good replacement on a GMC van.Would buy again.
B00IOU1BPQ|5|2014 Silverado 5.3.. Easily installed, approx 45 minutes.. Basic tools.. Normal driving can't tell difference but when you hit the gas it comes alive.. Sounds great on hilly terrain when kicked in!
B000B8JUNY|5|Good price
B00AW3KF5U|5|I love this sticker. Anything I can do to support my daughter,I will.
B003G0KO6G|5|My husband loves this product for his 2014 4Runner,the fit is perfect and keeps dirt and moisture off his carpets. Looks custom or OEM
B00902BCCY|5|I recently bought an aluminum shift knob and it gets really hot in the summer, I was looking for something to put on top of it when it's out in the sun, this product fits the knob perfectly and it isn't ugly at all. I will update when I have more information on whether it actually reduces the heat.
B006K93EAS|3|Still have not programed to ny alarm system. the instructions do not tell me anything specific so I'm having a hard time?
B000NCOKZQ|5|Just as advertised.
B000C9FZMM|4|Right part this time.

B004RNR9QY|5|Price was right, served it's purpose. Filling water storage containers...jerry cans/barrels.
B001REYHP2|1|Read the review of person who gave 5 star rating.<br />It did not work for him. Neither did it work for me. So here is a review with right amount of stars.
B00192KYFO|4|The shower head was just what we needed for the camper. It's a little hard to push the button up or down. It will probably get easier with more use. I'm satisfied with the purchase.
B000W3TFTW|5|Haven't installed these magnetic plugs yet. But I can honestly say from holding them and looking at them, that they are of very high quality. But then most of the Skunk2 parts are so I had confidence in the purchase before hand.  If your on the fence about these then don't hesitate. I don't think you will find any out there built better than these? Plus these come as a set!  What more do you want!?
B004QNW09Q|4|Love the way it looks in my silverado, but the part where the a piller touches the windshield is not straight, little warped
B000N2XOYE|3|Received Pertronix Flame Thrower to mate with Pertronix Ignition in 1969 MGB. Product seems quality item, but performs no better or differently from GT40 coil, or indeed standard original spec coil.
B0011N1TDC|5|Dorman 555-104 Steel Cup Expansion Plug -...as advertised
B00VDHJLWW|3|Works well on the back seat of my Rav4. I will say that I was not aware that it hangs by elastic, so if you are putting water bottles or tools or anything in it, it will stretch down. I wish it was a little bit more sturdy material to hang it on. But it is convenient for putting small extra things up off the trunk floor.

B001JT1CEE|4|ok
B00AWTX42K|5|Easy to insert and folds up nicely.  Keeps the heat out which is important in Florida
B002B8MHAU|5|perfect, everythink okay
B001O12368|4|received on time.  great fit
B0014FNU20|5|Very pleased
B00O6EZ7YU|1|Flimsy, not heavy enough. Copy was bad, lead you to think it was heavier than it was.
B00PJAKJ4S|3|Returned these because the claim that they are &#34;vented&#34; is a bit misleading. They have one small, zippered vent on each side of the front of the pants that opens to another zippered vent on the opposite side of the pants. The problem is, there is no mesh on the inside liner of the pants to allow the air inside. The air simply vents between the outer shell and inner liner (which is made of super-unbreathable polyester) and out the back- without ever moving air on the inside of the liner. So heat and humidity build up in the pants despite the fact that it is &#34;vented.&#34;<br /><br />Never took these out for a ride, but otherwise, they seem OK. I could just tell that even with the insulated liner removed, the venting in these pants are worthless and would be way too hot for me. I guess I can't complain or be too surpised since these were only 40 bucks...
B000QJMZ4O|3|Its ok.  I put this on my 2010 V6 Mustang and it sounds just ok.  I liked the sound of it with no muffler better.
B00YVQD4A2|5|PERFECT! I need to order one for each vehicle.
B00BYH6C1E|5|Works just as advertised, and definitely keeps my iphone from falling between the seat and the center console - which, before the Drop Stop was a huge problem.<br /><br />Plus, it matched the black leather interior of my car perfectly, and the install required absolutely no brainpower whatsoever.
B00B11J2JC|5|High quality well made, for smaller dogs only though.
B00IPS3HHC|3|Installed quickly and easily.  Package came with multiple adaptors.  However the one for my vehicle was a sloppy fit.  Worried it will pop off easily with little effort.  So far it hasn't but I also don't want to force it!
B00DDYNUC0|2|Cheaply made, and in my case it didn't sit centered in the hole where I replaced the CD player.  Tabs are a pain to get to in order to remove it.  It has since been removed from my car and I just blocked off the hole with some ABS sheeting as it looks cleaner than this did when it was installed.  It shouldn't be hard to design a cubby to replace an OE part and make it look good.
B00NLLH3ZU|1|Ítem not complete.
B004QEF9WA|1|This does not fit a 2&quot;pipe on the hitch jack.  I should have read one of the other reviews but did not.
B007W9NXWY|5|I like it.
B00E5OUOCQ|1|This shield does not work, you should not waste money on it, we return it right away. You can easily get something better in target
B00M0TLQ66|5|Great stuff works extremely well, an non toxic to boot. I cleared up two wrenches which I use in a pool chlorinated via a salt system to adjust return ports (under water). They were heavily rusted, after a day in the solution they were both cleared of ALL rust. Love this stuff!
B00W67SXBS|5|very satisfied
B00UE2T5EG|3|The pants seem well made, and sort of fit me ok. I had to return them, though, because the leg fit in practical terms are for someone with a much longer inseam than me, and IMO, much longer than the documentation might suggest. The knee pads fit lower than the knees of the pants, and considerably lower than my knees; granted, I have a short inseam, but I'd expected them to be much closer. I wish they had fit, because they looked very well made and the rest of the pants fit me quite nicely.
B007S12MS2|5|Love ittt!!!
B00481LP74|4|It fits nice but the pockets where very high and hard for me too get my hands into. My shoulders fit nice but I wish the jacket was slightly longer.
B00IGZQT38|4|Great product.  Only 4 stars because the area by the fuel release can still get some stuff to fall through.  Looks sharp and heavy duty.
B000XECJES|5|use these for cleaning up everything!
B006VB8JTQ|5|Seriously fixes your headlights if you follow the directions
B00B0CPPC0|5|Worked great
B00K8XDJ98|5|Installs with no problems. I wrapped the tools with pieces of the foam the Splash Guards were covered with so the paint didn't get scratched. Push back the center of the grommets to remove them using a thin blade screwdriver. Looks nice on a Titanium Mazda3 Sedan.
B000WOB4YU|4|A little lighter in color than shown. Good grips
B00WRUJY7Q|1|I wished not to do this<br />But this thing is made of very cheap materials<br />And damaged quickly<br />about the packaging that the worst thing in the world of packaging<br />A waste of money
B00SVHPWZC|2|Used it on our couch...made it sticky and super noisy when changing it to the recline position.
B00ALH4BW0|1|Not the correct emblem for the &#34;Hood&#34; of an Mini S JCW Convertible.
B00832106K|4|Great jacket. Comfortable and very light.
B009DJQWX8|5|It fits my 98 Civic EX Sedan perfectly.  Very well packaged, no damage at all.  Flawless finish, thickness of part looks just like OEM.<br /><br />Thumbs up!
B004ME11FS|1|MAKE SHURE  YOU HAVE THE GASKET WHEN YOU GET THIS  HOSE.<br />I received  mine on the day I left  the go up north  for a camping  trip. Well after  my camper  was set up and turned  on the water. Well it turned  into a sprinkler  spraying  all over the 220 electrical box. After  shutting  it down and not getting  electrocuted I realized it didn't come with a gasket.
B002G71WIO|3|I didn't expect the hard plastic. No ties came with. Otherwise, they're what you would expect!
B000VBGZEI|5|Perfect in every way
B003O6VJVG|5|Looks good.  Fits good.
B002EACF0C|3|The quality of this item leaves a little to be desired.  It functions as expected, but was fairly ill fitting on my 2002 Suzuki Bandit and required quite a bit of trimming and fiddling to get it to fit decent (but not perfect).
B000HAEPAO|5|Good and sturdy.  I bolted them with stainless steel hardware to my trailer to use in tying down 5 kayaks.
B00IKSWC7I|5|great product easy to install quick service and delivery.
B00XPTJAB8|5|Good product. Nice service.
B000VMF426|5|feats perfect
B00GRHRTEU|2|Easy to install and work great except for the horrible whistling noise.  Any speed over @25mph there is a horribly annoying whistling sound from the air ripping through the open slit in the pivot knuckle area.  In my opinion its a poor design.
B000NCWP3K|5|American Speciality (UT-4) American Specialty...This works great for what I need it for.
B000BHQ5JC|4|Not overly powerful, but works as expected when no electric power is available for a more powerful hair dryer.
B00449HGUU|1|I received the wrong part.
B00917EP9K|5|Amazing couldn't have asked for anything better... The print looks amazing
B000CRO4IK|5|Exactly what I was looking for.  Holds about $13 worth of change and fits perfectly in my console cup holder.  The adhesive on the bottom would work nicely, but I don't want to keep the coin holder permanently in this holder area.  Coins are easy to dispense and refill.
B00I2ENZ3A|5|Great
B00S4HFNXK|4|We wound up using this on our dock instead of the boat. For the boat, we actually prefer the round bumpers, as they're easier to move around and give a bit more space when tying up either with other boats or dock. On the dock, however, these are fantastic for preventing the boat from bumping into the dock and getting all scratched up. They stay in place and give a little extra protection where needed.
B00HSFAR80|5|quality looks really good compared to what i had there before (i got previous from a lube service station that charged me a premium price and installed a really cheap filter.) Fairly easy to install.
B005F2WKB0|5|Nice fit on 2005 Endeavor and works great!
B005R6LOZM|5|Works great.
B005KDOAGC|1|Burned through two sets of these in less than a year.  UPDATE 1/6/16 - Burned through another set yesterday.  We took the car to Toyota for a warranty repair, asked them to examine the car to make sure the car is not burning these lights out, and the car is fine.  These bulbs are JUNK.
B008V1S0QG|4|Good price timely received.
B010SQ0I16|5|Great. Works perfectly!
B0016BRA3M|5|I have used this charger on my BMW K1200LT touring bike for about 5 months each year. There is current drain due to the CPU and it always starts the first time in the spring! I have an adapter plug that mates with the DIN female connector on the bike.
B007ZBB2VS|4|Comes exactly as shown with the all 6 panels, my only complaint is that some of the lights are chipped around the edges and the sticker on the control box had been put on crooked and then peeled halfway off, but that was somewhat fixed with superglue.
B002Q3R7UA|5|Thanks!
B00U5I1HBI|1|Don't waste your money. It doesn't work at all. Won't fit or cover the dashboard or any parts of the vehicle. I only gave it a 1 store since it won't let me move forward.
B002VFAOPI|4|Works just fine.
B00FBKWG60|5|Great product for the price, very easy to install. Had everything in my truck and working in 10 minutes or so. Adds a great look. Visibility with high beams could be better, but for the price I'm happy.
B003ZWZ7VM|5|Why didnt I get this sooner???  I live in Florida, constant sun beat'n on my JK.  Considerable difference in the cabin with this sunshade!!  IT IS A MUST HAVE!!!
B00OV7601G|5|Perfect fitting! Great quality!
B003U2J7AE|5|This was great thank you
B00G0OIQS8|1|Worked great on '98 Chrysler Sebring JXI.<br /><br />Update:<br />broke down in less than a month of use.
B004ZY181C|5|They fit great on my car and was easy to put on.
B00455L5WS|5|Nice shovel quality piece of work glad I bought it
B000EDUUIA|5|Fast delivery!!!  Works great
B006N960R4|5|oem quality. fit perfect.
B006GJYP5K|5|Best thing to clean vinyl! I use it on the vinyl on my boat that is mostly white and it makes it look brand new. Have tried all sorts of other things and this product is 'da bomb!
B006KX71JO|5|seems a lot of people have tried this lip on the accords so i went ahead and gave it a shot since it was a step above the ez lip. I was amazed with the fit! At first i was a bit skeptical but it came out perfect!! Love it and fast shipping!
B0066CP6I2|3|Way to loud for any long term use. Its got the power and can move the air, but way to loud
B0001EWQUM|5|The delivery was quick . The install was easy .
B007LIB46S|4|It was nice but had a loose fit on my 2008 Accord steering wheel.
B002XLF1HG|1|Terrible manufacturing quality control on this item. So bad I almost returned it. Thought it was used when it came out if the box. Big scratch/gouge across the top, scratches on the flat surface, chunks out of the edges.
B0017K69MA|4|The extreme windshield angles on modern cars make this or a product like it mandatory. This one got my glass cleaners than ever before (and I was using Invisible Glass cleaner already)<br /><br />Not a big fan of the packaging (awkward to open, unlikely to be useful for storing the product)
B008VLVDII|4|Does great with dog hair and scratches plus withstands babbies urp!!! It's a little big for a kia should but gets the job done!
B00LHZILNU|4|great for my range rover 2002 ! but again i just need to replace the buttons on my old key!
B000CBLWIG|5|Difficult to remove but easy to install
B00FEZ50S8|5|good size for my corner back window.  Great design.
B00L81T452|5|Awesome top, only thing that sucks is they put the knobs on top of the windshield header so it's damn near impossible getting the top off, i have to use a wrench to turn knobs because of the angles. Also, remove the spring latch on your door surrounds. Looks stupid on the top adding bumps you don't need.  Leak free, easy to turn into safari top if you don't wanna hassle with no top. Nothing but compliments on it now. Gives it a sporty look. Thanks smitty!
B00G247CZY|5|BOUGHT THEM FOR MY CROWN VIC LOVE THEM
B00378K6L0|5|Good product
B00VIB8C5U|5|It was what I spect. Well pack, part Number for future purchase in time etc.
B00N1YNEIW|5|Good product
B00AWPI5AU|5|Just what I needed
B00JKMHXCW|3|This was the 2nd purchase of the same product with a different color scheme. I originally purchased this same seat cover with the black and light grey scheme after installing it I decided I wanted the darker scheme. After returning it and receiving my new current color set I discovered that the seat has one less seat strap on the bottom that goes from side to side. I didn't give it much thought...at first. Now the seat cover will continuously ride up on the side upon entering/exiting the vehicle. The initial cover didn't do this. I appreciate the fact that these are made in America but it bothers me that it was more than likely a cost saving measure to eliminate this strap. Other than the strap issue the quality is there and you can see initials of the assemblers/ inspectors on the inside tags throughout.
B00OAC0O8C|3|Bags look good .All I can say is you get what you pay for. So if you want best buy better bags these are good for the money look ok hardware is not good bags are good for the money but wish I would of bought better bags and not try to save money
B003YJ8TVQ|5|AWESOME PRODUCT!!!
B009FUF6DM|5|I can't get enough of these towels... use for everything, including polishing guns, windows, glasses, mirrors, etc.
B00G9C3RSU|5|Good quality good price.
B00T1RNR58|5|Perfect cut for the windows and easy to apply.
B00A8MZ7IA|5|Love these towels, they have a nice black edging around the towel so when you wash it the ends don't curl up like some other ones I have. Good size nice and soft. Perfect for detailing my truck or just cleaning around the house.
B006RXPV4Y|5|as advertised
B00S7FZUR8|2|I was very disappointed after it rained. The back of my truck was full of water. I bought this cover so I  could keep my wheel chair in the back of my truck. It was installed exactly as by the installation.
B00784VYLA|5|A/C part was exactly as it was described.  Very happy!
B000C5GAQQ|5|works
B008BVNMPU|4|this product was good for my 08 chrysler town and country, its just the seat cover  were alittle loose but they still were great and looked good inside my van.. over all they were good and i like the fact that they even send a video on how to install them that was really nice of them
B00K9WUITW|5|Product as described.
B00BFE59LA|5|Good
B004TDNVFK|3|I had to shave off a little of the metal at the caliper to get it to fit, it also got in the way of the bleeder screw.
B00180JF7U|5|Good replacement part.  It even came with new nuts and installation instructions.
B00WID0OEE|5|Works great for automotive cleaning while wet sanding.  Very supple to follow an irregular surface, but sturdy enough that it can move a slurry.  It would work well on widows and tile too.  Comes with extra blades.
B000BKEBO0|5|I had a glass bottle get a spider crack on the bottom. I applied two layers of this to the outside of the bottle and let it sit upside down and dry for two days. I have had no problems with leaking, and it has held up even with washing. I'm so glad I was able to save the bottle!
B00O6T049I|5|Works great!  Lights no longer flicker and the battery stays charged.
B00JH1HI94|5|Great item and fast delivery.
B00IWL93C0|5|Great accent piece for my bike. It fits perfectly and it came with the the washer ring!
B00SP286RE|1|The paper got stuck and I could not peel it.
B00NH0XMPK|1|The plate looks good, however it started to peel the &#34;black mate&#34; coating 8 months after it was installed. Poor quality of product...it needs to have additional UV rated mate clear coat to prevent paint peeling. Not worth the $39...should get the OEM instead. I would give it 4 stars for the look, but 1 star the quality is very poor.
B004GNLGTQ|4|fit the rubber gas hose good but can't really say if lowers temp or not
B00DEJTGVI|5|Easy fast install, look great.
B00L40ESW6|5|So cute and perfect size-very small...cute cute cute
B009K9458A|1|Installed on my ATV and after first time on the trails noticed condensation on the INSIDE of the front lens. Since I'm out of warranty I'm stuck with a defective product.
B00LJ3BQUU|4|Worked fine
B00NACSDU4|5|Lloyds are always top-notch. Perfect fit
B005TR99LA|5|Put this on my 8.1 litre W-22 motorhome engine along with dyno tune flash upgrade to computer. Performed awesome. Between both upgrades I was able to pull the grapevine in California at 55 mph with a 36 foot motorhome. YAHOO !!
B00WDSVEE8|4|I have never used this type of flip up sunglass thingy before. At first I was concerned that it was so flimsy that it would not work. Although it doesn't fit my frame perfectly I was surprised how well it worked. My first trial was a five hour marathon soccer day in the bright sun up in the mountains. It was a squint free day and hey worked very well. I was surprised and grateful for this product
B000IYCT1Q|1|Not worth the effort. Buy something with a warranty. I changed both frt brgs on my Pontiac G6. Warranty= 12months. Worn out 13 months. 25000kms. I'll buy AC or Moog next time
B008IEFA0U|5|Does what its designed for.  Very economical.
B00KY0D6WK|2|i know for a fact that Amazon does not want to read bad revues about the products they sell but what can you say about a product that's defective right out of the box ? OK  I will lie I love it .
B00CI42LQC|5|Assembly and Installation was a breeze. I've had it on for a while now. No vibrating, No rubbing, One Hell of a Solid unit
B00AYJK9HG|5|Received the product in a timely manner and very easy to program!
B000E5IIN2|1|did not contain the O ring for the bolt that holds the cannister on and the O ring that seals the cannister to the filter block was the wrong size.  No wonder it was so cheap.  Never again.
B0009IQZH0|1|I had a really nice microfiber towel that I either misplaced or threw away last year.  Based on how everyone was saying this brand is amazing I bought these.  I couldn't tell how thick they were but ordered anyway.  They are paper thin.  But worse than that, when I went to dry the car, pieces of the towel started to flake off.  Definitely not what you want in a towel used to dry your car.  I thought maybe they just needed to be washed first.  They literally fell apart in the washer.  These are total garbage and I did end up throwing them away.  Amazon was nice enough to refund my money so A+ to them.  Years ago I bought a 50 pack of HDX brand microfiber towels from the local home center and they are worlds better than this junk.  Don't waste your time.
B00JBJ3QAW|5|The transformation was amazing!  I have a 2003 Mustang Pony Convertible.  It is in great shape, but the foggy headlights made it look blah.  These fit great and we did seal them as other reviewers had suggested, with no problems yet!
B00FWNRAKI|5|Works great
B00XOCWBKI|5|Matched my Pony emblems, nice heavy material, looks great!
B00HR26TOU|5|Great product! Perfect brightness and install was easy. Love it at night.
B00KTHZJ1O|5|Key works great,  I did have to take it to the dealer to program.... I only had one key and 2 are required for self programming.
B00P2D3VZG|2|Nice overpriced light.  However, not very bright.  You should keep some superglue handy to glue the lense tips back on.  Two of mine broke when I tried to reverse their polarity.
B00J5IOS9C|5|The exact replacement and much cheaper than Winnebago or other competitors.  Highly recommended !!
B00RZTD4H0|5|Worth every penny!  Fits the seat without slipping, stays put, easy to put on, take off, protects the seat from oils, sweat, odors and easy to wash.  Put it on cold, gentle and it (air) dries in no time.  I researched a lot of different styles and this one made the most sense.  It doesn't have a rubber backing that would disintegrate in the heat, and will stay put on upholstery OR leather. Also, will not interfere with side airbags.  Love this well-designed, quality product!!
B00K0SCNVG|1|the exhaust did not fit between the upper and lower seat so I have to send it back.  also, it just doesn't seem to move much air!
B00J6ZI8G8|2|Received incorrect hitch? Hitch received  was beat up and gouged. Hitch was stout with good welds!
B00FMZCPCE|4|With the money
B002P8L8XI|5|Perfect fit for original, just have to paint it.
B00WTPY8F2|4|Very, good response and sofa the product are working great.
B008AFUQMO|5|Work just fine
B0027Y8CDY|5|The quality of these sawy links seem to be much stronger than the previous pair I had installed on my car. I cannot be more happy with these links.
B0055PFY2Y|5|good deal...no issues
B008MQR35Y|4|For the price, this is a nice way to symbolize an important part of my life's work. the plate appears to be well crafted and the Chaplain Corps design is clean.
B000Q0S0S8|2|Springs came in a different color.<br />3 burgundy and 1 fire engine red.<br />I contacted amazon and they sent out replacements. When the replacement came 3 says later... The exact same thing happened. Thy sent 3 burgundy springs and 1 fire engine red spring.<br /><br />After installing the springs, my car creeks and grinds when I turn.<br />I thought it was my top hats, so I replaced those.<br />Nope, car still creeks.<br />I'm disappointed with these.
B0058SGFLM|4|Worked as described, good product
B000M8PYO2|5|Used working
B00DILTE1Y|5|Bosch SteelTech wipers are wonderful. They install easily, snapping on and off. I didn't have any trouble getting good contact. I have always just used wipers from a big box store. I can not believe how big a difference there is. These wipers are very nearly silent. There is not a squeaking or swooshing sound. These wipers clear the window completely. I was just amazed.<br /><br />We have no installed these on all our cars. We have 3 young drivers and more coming up. I want them to have the increased safety that clear windows provide.
B00Y08TOTQ|4|Was way harder then the video shows and the paper manual was even more vague was a nightmare...  If you have a leak or blow off the vlamps your car will die and its easy to do with this or any kit but just know this will not be a few hr isntall if your not a professional...
B000NVW1LM|5|I have to admit I was skeptical, but  the product does work as advertised. I took an older vehicle to the shop because it was dripping some fluid. The car had sat in a garage for a few years and a lot of the rubber had dry rotted. The leak wasn't bad, a few drops every time it was parked, but a leak never the less. Found out there were actually 3 small leaks. 1 from the power steering high pressure hose, 1 from the transmission and one was an oil leak from near the manifold. The oil and transmission leak involved seals and were very expensive to repair due to their locations. Put one bottle in the transmission, 4 Oz's into the oil (its based on the oil capacity) and a couple Oz's in the power steering reservoir. A few days later no drips on the driveway. Granted my leaks apparently were relatively small, so I don't know how it would work on a larger leak, and of course I knew I was dealing with leaking seals. I will update this post if the leaks return.
B000BPSW7C|4|My car is shining!
B001V8U12M|5|Makes leveling much easier.
B006R61RA8|5|perfect fit
B00KQ81M94|5|Very speedy delivery which I appreciated. Also, Tony the founder and owner personally followed up with me to be sure it met my needs, which it certainly did!  High quality Chamois! Doesn't streak and picks up the water beads in just one swipe. I really like that is has it own storage canister so I can easily keep it in my truck and keep it moist too. I highly recommend the Man Sham Chamois Cloth!
B007XE5LTG|5|Very amazing scan tool. i use it do a few cars told the right problem help with not having guess your problem and also great to reset and live feed to see what cause problem to your car. i use this one on 328i 98 bmw, 2009 Toyota camery that was my family member car who came in to town the car had gave her problems while she was here visiting and with this tool find out all she needed was to reset the system that was 4 months ago and still no problems. way better than being stuck anywhere. just make sure your car or cars have the usb plug under steering wheel 96 and newer. Over all great product tell pending code (like if somethings is going bad) to store code ( a problem that has happen and that need to be changed) also good if you do work on you car to delete the codes after to see if code is fix. only bad thing is that it don't use battery so you have plug it in before coming on but does hold data if you have check later.
B0009IK6UM|5|I use this to replace the rear wiper on my 2012 Chevrolet Equinox 2LT. The original (factory) blade seemed to last forever - especially down here in the Texas heat. When it finally went, I replaced it with this ANCO and it held up for about the same time. I use Rain-X blades on the front windshield and have thought about trying those on the rear windshield, however all of the websites about the Equinox say use ANCO or Bosch for some reason. The only negative I have to say about these blades is that they are somewhat &#34;streaky&#34; and once they start to go 'bad', they need to be replaced ASAP. It goes from perfectly working wiper blade to no wiper blade with incredible speed. Still though - for the price and for how long it lasts it's hard to beat.
B007KCXOCC|5|perfect!
B00K2UA41I|4|Fun sign my son loves Deloreans and collects old metal signs so I bought this sign I should've looked closer because it's plastic but he was still happy .
B00GLBGKVA|5|Excellent patch,  great material, nice size
B00G0PKJLY|5|The was great thank you
B00AALK5N6|5|Brighter than standard stock halogen bulb that came with the Harley dual Halogen headlight. Can see farther down the road and more area ditch to ditch.
B009S9RR1Y|5|Very fast ship. Item arrived exactly as pictured.
B002W0ZVRI|5|Good spray nozzle, excellent product at the right price.  Keeps the tires shining and looking good.
B0073MF7QA|5|Cooled my 71 z28  write down 220 to 185 with a zz4 crate mtr
B001V8RYTA|5|works well
B000BZG8ZU|5|fast service and great price
B007FHC2KW|5|I have used this to replace right rear wheel bearing on 2004 Lexus RX330. This is basically an OEM part, as the bearing I removed also was stamped NSK. The fit and finish were perfect. No issue with install. Sliding hammer made an easy job of removing old bearing. I remove rust<br />buildup on the knuckle/backing plate and use little of anti-seize to put it together.<br />In general this is a third Lexus RX I was working on, and each one had a bad rear wheel bearing.
B003YO25WU|1|Too much glue. I had to modify it to get it to fit.
B00NN22KO6|1|Worked perfect for about a year and first it stopped playing cd or dvd then the deck would just shut it's self off now it only comes on when it wants too and even then the screen only works hlf the time I'm trying to figure out how to get it replaced right now bit am having very little luck
B006YU7G8E|5|Its genuine fluid for a reasonable price. I ordered 5 of it for my honda civic 2001 model but it took only 3 to completely flush the system.
B00HEAMAFM|5|Worked Well.
B005NLQAHS|5|Awesome product! Works exactly like it is supposed to. Thank you BAFX Products and Amazon.
B00N2D206E|5|Love these magnets. My daughter was learning to drive a stick and before we had these, the other drivers were very impatient and flustered her. With the magnets on her car, the other drivers gave her time and space to learn. I am saving them for the next kid.
B00VUGUPHQ|4|These are pretty good for ultra-short stubby screwdrivers.  I just wish the concave detent on the back of the handle was a little deeper.
B010H0QV7S|3|It's OK because it works and came with the original box. But as soon as I took it out of the box, the display cover came out and fell.
B004BTAJ2A|5|Love how it looks nice grip
B00KRJJ618|4|Made of sturdy quality material. Looks great after installation.
B000JZY4KI|4|Good quality replacement parts for my F350. Installed easily with no issues.
B00P06Z7UC|5|Bad-Ass sound, throughout the powerband definitely power increase, awesome DTM Style!!!! I need another one ASAP
B005G21IQC|5|works wonderful
B004TCIUW0|1|This is perhaps the least effective, most disappointing car care product I have ever used.  I own several vehicles so I am waxing or detailing at least one of them every couple of weeks.  The product's claim to need &#34;no hazing&#34; should actually read &#34;do not let this haze or you will spend the rest of the weekend trying to remove it from your paint, which will look dull, dirty and streaky until you finally manage to remove this mess and apply real wax.&#34;  Having used everything from the old faithful white Turtle Wax to professional products costing 10 times as much, I know that different waxes have different performance and response to various applications, and it is important to recognize that anything making superlative claims about quick/easy is likely going to suffer a bit compared to a more labor intensive wax/sealer product.  Unfortunately, the Armor All Butter Wax functions less like a wax at all and more like a sticky, gelled detail spray.  After my first terrible experience with letting the product haze a bit and then being all but impossible to remove without a buffer, I tried applying it and immediately wiping it off as suggested on the bottle (Note: the bottle doesn't caution you against letting the product dry, which I think is a failure on the part of Armor All; while I still don't think applying it quickly gives you a good result, they should be much clearer about not letting the product haze rather than advertising it as if you just &#34;don't have to&#34; let it do so - once dry, this borders on the consistency of a heavy cleaner wax or cutting compound, which is not at all appropriate for something claiming to be a &#34;quick&#34; wax product).  While it was easy enough to remove when applied and wiped quickly, I found that under that approach it made no real visible/tactile improvement in the paint beyond what you get from a good wash; if anything, it still left a little sticky or rough residue behind.  If you are looking to save timeover a regular wax, I would recommend a true detail spray rather than this product.  I would note that I do still like and continue to use other Armor All products, but this stands out as one that I will never buy again, and is honestly the first time I have ever thrown a waxing/detailing product away without using most or all of it.
B00WAL9AEE|5|Great spark plugs and wires...cheaper than autozone!!  Highly recommended
B0061R32JC|5|Met all my expectations. Looks great on my 2014 Fatboy Lo...description says it won't fit, but it did and perfectly.
B003NS5NK8|1|Tools not complete. An extra screwdriver thing needed to do the job.
B005PZMLDY|1|Very cheeply made No stars
B00B9F1CCK|5|Bumper arrived in excellent shape.  A few small scratches that are to be expected IMO. Took paint very well mounted up very easily.<br /><br />A great replacement for OEM.
B010G371KC|5|Love my Starfleet Academy decal!!
B000JFES40|1|the description says it is 5.8 by 3 by 2 inches. it is not. it is 3 by 2 inches.  didn't work for me :(
B00407V43Q|5|Small but worked great
B001AWK5XE|4|Worked great and wasn't hard to use.
B000C2ECAA|5|High quality product that met my expectations. Did the job.
B013SAJ1FS|4|My husband is always tinkering on stuff. He has built and rebuilt this little scooter using regular tools. When I showed him these, we was excited to try using the right tools. They are an excellent fit. They arrived on time and came packaged exactly as shown in the pictures. The tool itself feels like great quality. The white labels on the handle are a little skewed, but still legible. I might run a coat of clear nail polish over the lettering so that it will not scratch off. (See images) Overall they function well. I was provided with these tools in exchange for an honest review. This has been my experience with them.
B000SL4A84|5|Everything you need an more.
B00UEABUKA|2|This is the same helmet sold as under the brand GLX. So whatever reviews you find on it should apply to this one as well. I suspect the actual manufacturer of these helmets to be some generic chinese company. I ordered a medium of the GLX and it's too tight on my head to properly review. I'm somewhere between medium, large, intermediate oval head I think. I can't even wear my glasses without them hurting and it's a struggle to put them on with the GLX. The GLX claimed to be bluetooth compatible but that seems to be incorrect or misleading as this ad doesn't even mention bluetooth...
B007KPVGCY|4|Real nice piece - good chrome, well made, and looks good on my Sportster with a nice contour to the fender.  But, as far as functionality I'm not sure that it is large enough to hold more than a small tank bag or package.  Also, it doesn't provide a whole lot of clearance between the rack and the fender so one must be careful attaching metal bungee hooks to ensure the fender is not scratched.
B00JBND8VK|5|I just installed this unit a few days ago as an inverter only, it does much more.<br /><br />It's still early to tell but it seems like a well built, well designed unit.<br /><br />The manual is written in a clear, explanatory manner with charts to show power output, cable sizes, ETC.<br /><br />No more playing around with cheap, under powered units that promise wattage they just can't deliver.<br /><br />A good value for the money i think.
B00FQ0ROZS|5|Great Looking Product “We will do business again”  “Thank You”
B00SXLJVA8|5|Product arrived on time and as expected.
B00T7DYJVM|1|The light did not work when hooked up, so I contacted them. They wanted me to send a picture of it. Just imagine looking at the switch with no lights...There you go! I bought a different switch elsewhere that works.
B00G5588YY|5|Not the most realistic carbon look ever, but then again, it's super cheap too. It performs the function of protecting the tank perfectly.
B000ARPVMU|5|Great OEM oil filter.  Nothing super exciting, but it works!
B00B1VBQRS|5|As good as advertise!
B004YP0RDC|5|Fits great!
B0031Y3Q6W|4|Product arrived quickly and was as described
B0000AY2Z6|5|I bought this as a birthday present for a homesteader friend who is enduring 100+ degree weather, and is off the grid. He has it plugged into a car battery that gets charged by a solar panel. He says it's great, the low setting is ample wind, never uses the high setting and he can run it night and day without running out of power.
B00BRNUCBG|5|worked great until i lost it. ive left it plugged for overnight n didnt drain my battery
B00NLMSDOE|4|Fits my car perfectly - however, did not come with the Antenna patches.  I contacted the company & they sent them to me, but then they did not stick on the cover, so I am going to have to stitch them on.
B00ABPRAN4|5|May the force be with you..
B004Z1LULS|4|Got new tires for my H3 315/75/16 BFGs fits these 35&#34; well. So now it says H2 on the back and H3 on the Hummer with 35&#34; So now added them up and you have a bad ass H5!!!!!
B001KO7170|3|This is Plastic Dipped Chrome. Makes it easy to install. I wish it was Metal, but my horn is only visible from the side of my bike. So I decided to just use it until I find a better replacement.
B007Y1H0D8|5|I bought this as a back up in case I ever broke my button master again, but I constantly use this thing, now whenever I see a door that requires me to awkwardly bend my tool I just pull this out and makes the job alot easier without risking damage to my button master its so simple but brilliant.
B003PVJYQW|5|nice quality
B000F5JMEA|4|Worked with some trial and error to hold fast the crank pulley (even though it did not fit perfectly) so I could remove the bolt on my Mitsubishi 3.0 liter engine. Worked well in a pinch.<br />That being said, the wrench is advertised as a tool for Honda's.
B000C2SBTS|5|Great seller. Prompt and merchandise as advertised.
B00S15PMK4|5|amazing, not loud as others state, they are loud because they have to adjust correctly
B008BBU10O|1|This hitch cover looks good  but fits so loosely in my receiver that it rattles which tells me the price exceeds the quality. I would not recommend to a friend.
B0051D3MP6|1|The product arrived in a timely manner with no problems from the seller however the product was DOA out of the box. It would not power up at all. I tried different outlets even the one the previous charger was using, but no-go. This has been the only product I ever purchased on Amazon that did not work at all from the box. I guess it happens sometime but I will purchase another brand but never another Black and Decker.
B00HUKDE9C|4|long shipping but good product
B000EPR3HE|5|must have for jeeps
B00SUTHIVM|5|Great product with a business that cares!!
B00BSESK18|3|IT could last a whole week if you're lucky!
B00RUE0ULI|5|I received these quickly and they work great on my 08 Road King. Great for the price.
B0002M9QJM|1|Warning to all buyers.  The product description for this item is wrong.  These do not comply with DOT/SAE standards.  If you live in the states, these are not street legal.  I installed these today and used them tonight on my drive home with 6000k HID bulbs.  9/10 cars flashed me.  Will be returning these immediately.
B00N4JBLF2|5|Fast delivery, perfect fit, easy installation.
B008TT0DG0|5|Perfect fit, fast shipping and a great price. Thank you!
B00IO32SW8|4|Product arrived in a timely manner and exactly as described and was installed on my car in mere seconds.
B00IALYPT8|2|These are replacements I picked up because of the ease in cleaning them.  I don't find them to cut as well as other pads I have used but if the paint is in good shape then this is great for bringing out a deep reflection.  Using them can be time consuming as they get gummed up pretty quick and require cleaning often if using just one pad.  The cool thin is the pad comes off the velcro backing plate and can be thrown in the wash.  To maintain quality and increase the life of the pad it is important to clean them, and then lay them flat face down to dry.  I have a screen that I lay them on and blow with a fan and they dry with in 45 minutes or less depending on the heat outside. Overall they are okay to keep in case of emergency but if you are looking to cut time in detailing a car these are not the ones to use.
B00BQS6W16|5|Installed works perfectly
B0002JMIEK|5|The best....been using it for 20 years now
B002P3LLR6|4|They fit well & are relatively comfortable.  My intended use will be in the desert in a very dusty environment.  Based on how they look, it appears that dust will easily get in thru vents that are intended to allow air movement to prevent fogging.  Time will tell how well the foam lasts before it either:<br />a)  Falls off<br />b)  Becomes clogged with fine Playa dust.<br /><br />  I'll update after nearly 2 weeks on the Playa starting in just 2 days
B00IIYPMOE|4|Great gloves and fantastic value. only reason I dont give these 5 stars is that I feel they should have better abrasion coverage on the side of the little finger.
B00HHR1UVM|3|These are NOT side-shining as advertised, but the typical forward shining variety.<br />Sadly, I didn't find this out until I had cut them to length.<br />That said, they are bright enough and look pretty good otherwise. How well they'd hold up remains to be seen.
B002I713CC|5|great set
B00GSAUHB8|5|This is a great product. In the few days I've used the sun shade, the difference in temperature when I get in my car after it's been sitting in the sun all day is quite noticeable. It's more than big enough to cover my entire windshield (Hyundai Elantra). Love it. Wish I'd gotten it sooner.
B0006SH4HS|4|Super strong and if mixed properly the gallon can last for a while. Currently I use this for serious stain removal (body fluids) or wheels and tires on everyday drivers.  This especially helpful with vehicles where owners have neglected the wheel or the vehicle is known to create a lot of brake dust. (ie BMW, Audi, Volvo) I spray, let sit for about 30 seconds to a minute and then use a soft wheel brush or sponge and the dirt comes right off.  When there are extreme amounts of gunk on the wheel using the degreaser straight helps; however in most cases 10:1 ratio is fine.
B0055UCRRY|3|not what was expected
B00AIYU148|5|When speed is needed or the correction needs to be aggressive this is what you need to have.  I dont use it a lot when I am detailing vehicles, however it is good to have it.  It works really well on hard paints like (Merz. Benz) or on freshly painted vehicles.  I got better results with a DA polisher than the guy using something else and a rotary polisher.  I told him what I used so he gave away his old product and started using M100. He said that he would never go back!
B00KPE7RS4|5|fast service and great price
B003GC74NK|4|They fit a little loose. They still make a sealed connection but be careful or they might fall out once the hose is removed.
B00FJUEO12|5|great use for rolling printer cart.  very sturdy
B000CIGGXA|1|Never recommend if you plan to hold this for more than 2 months .pls don't waste ur money
B003XGYDE2|4|It works fine as a small pump.
B005OZNZD0|5|Worked as advertised and saved me a lot of money.
B006969RQM|5|great product
B004KED77A|1|Bad design. The sockets are 3/8&#34; and the end of the extension is 1/2&#34; so you can't use the sockets on the extension. The sockets are medium deep so they whole setup doesn't fit well in narrow places. Needless to say it didn't work for me and I had already thrown out the packaging so I'm stuck with this POS. I guess it will work as a breaker bar so not a total loss.
B0072J9Q16|5|Good solder and best price I could find on the net
B000C16XCG|3|WORKED AS IT SHOULD
B006BARHFY|1|I don't feel it even deserve a half of a star. It programmed great, it worked exactly one day and haven't worked since...
B000UDL8AS|5|Always use new ones
B000C5DUN2|5|Perfect, easy, replacement for the cruise control switches on my old explorer.
B0049PLFGK|5|Very good
B00TUAYY08|5|I love it but I thought it would be bigger
B00BDOCWMQ|5|hard to beat this product
B0010GFH9W|5|This part solved my check engine light that was on for over a year, works great!
B001Q8DMA0|1|Started falling apart after first washing (per manufacturer's instructions). Have had towels from Griot's and Meguiar's look like new for years.
B00CWSK4UY|4|All good
B010XZRQCG|5|These work great and they are very bright. I'm really happy with this product.
B0027687PU|5|They are big enough to be seen from the road. Good for fire and police and friends to find my new house.
B00IX18JM4|4|Mine didn't have instructions included at all and I was missing one of the shorter bolts, but still a great product for the price! The assembly is so straightforward that instructions would really be a waste of paper...<br /><br />Go to a hardware store and get 8 of the 30mm M6 bolts to replace the included bolts for mounting to the CR-V rails. The included ones would probably work if you used a vice to compress the rubber gasket against the rails and pressed with all of your might to get the bolt threads to bite... But, it's easier to just buy the 30mm bolts and tighten them down as needed. Also, if you need to swap out the shorter bolts, they are 10mm M5 bolts.
B004EW7OEK|4|Unfortunately this doesn't protect the entire bumper.
B002ZTNWEK|5|Perfect fit . Makes cleaning much easier
B00J00X5YO|5|Good product
B001O7PNNM|2|Did not remove even the most minor of the scratches.
B00K2MYPVG|5|looks nice, easy to mount on the wall
B004VG6KI0|5|great stuff easy to install
B00FGVNUPA|5|The color matched ant it arrived quickly.
B0093DPLOK|5|GREAT PRODUCT
B004VRN9UG|5|Product as described
B00C306H0W|3|they should put price up,, and include the feaking springs,,, grrrrr
B002WLUSNO|5|Looks awesome on my Motorcycle
B0054T95ZS|5|My old ones were so loose and corroded that my battery wasn't getting charged.  These were easy to install and took care of my problem.
B0026PM1ZO|5|It was much bigger than I thought.
B00QVQ2UAK|5|Its great for the price.<br /><br />One point of info that can go either way for a consumer is that the terminals are soldered at the light fixture.  This makes things quite secure, there, against vibration.  But I would have been just as happy to have just screw terminals there--I would have pulled out the existing leads and fed mine in, in order to avoid one more splice.
B008JUL22I|5|Great value
B00GSAUHB8|5|It is so much easier to deploy compared the folded up cardboard or aluminum ones. Covers everything with no cracks!
B00YNNAZ00|5|They fit and look great.  You do have to drill one hole, but I have an angle drill and did not have to pull the tire.  Easy Peezy!
B00XN9LAHC|5|love it
