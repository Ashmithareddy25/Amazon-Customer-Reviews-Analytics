B002OHB3CG|4|I have reviewed this group before and nothing has changed, they are still a superior group of musicans and writers. They decided to do a live acoustice set,<br />similar to the old VH1 style. It's very good, reminds me of one of my favorite<br />70's bands Renaissance with Annie Haslam.<br />Would love to have been there, BUT I would love to see them anywhere !!! (in the USA)
B00CNQ7HAU|5|This book is very good.  Very well written.  I couldn't put it down. John Grisham did a suburb job. I'd read it again, it is so good.
B000FCKC4C|5|This was soul touching<br />This book has reminded me to listen to my heart more<br />I read this at the right time for me<br />Thank you Paulo
B000007WK4|5|NEVER RECEIVED THIS CD EITHER, SAME REASONS AS THE OTHER CD REVIEW. BUT ALL CHRIS REA CDS<br />DESERVE 10 STARS--NO OTHER ARTISTS OUT THERE EVEN COME CLOSE!<br /><br />BUT ZERO STARS TO AMAZON AND THIS 3RD PARTY VENDOR OF THEIRS!
B00DDZM0GQ|5|Awesome time killer!!
B0042X9L6A|5|I cannot believe how amazing my indoor photos look now.  I highly recommend anyone purchasing this if they are having trouble with dark indoor photos.
B00006LFGD|5|Have really enjoyed listening to this.
B009AMANH4|5|The film, overall, was a bit slow but this was partly due to the subject matter. I enjoyed it greatly an Daniel Day Lewis was very convincing as Lincoln, based on what I've read of the man.<br />A thoroughly enjoyable film
B007HACDLK|5|Vince Flynn is always a great story teller and I devour his books as soon as they come out. Mitch Rapp is a great character.
B00RNRDACS|4|Had me laughing, good for re-watching
B005ZOBNOI|4|I really did love this book but... I had finished the DIVERGENT Series and the main character in that book died too. And this book was a beautiful writing and an excellent read but one of the main characters dies. I mean Don't authors know that no one likes that?? But still the book was still one of the greats in my world. So if you're looking for a heart touching romantic teen read this would be the one to go.
B008JFUNJQ|4|I rate it as a 4/5 because of the technical excellence and spectacular special effects.<br /><br />I've read the book, and it (out of necessity) takes out a lot of detail and (not so necessary) adds others, so if you loved the book, don't look for a completely parallel experience.<br /><br />Still a great movie & story to watch.
1476709564|3|I just read the first chapter and I find it fascinating. I think the statements are clearly understandable and directions are easy to follow. The following chapters should be just as helpful and informative.
0446569895|5|I am not a reader not someone that has to have a book to read all the time in fact maybe once in a couple of years would I find something to read. However this book   \\"I AM OZZY\\" I could not put down,this book will have you lauaghing crying it is just crazy. I highly recomend this book to any one not just a Black Sabbath fan or an Ozzy fan any one because it is just great reading.
0316055433|5|The Goldfinch is a VERY special book.  It has been widely acknowledged as one of best pieces of literature in recent years - by authors, critics, academicians, and the general public.  In a recent (2014) Wall Street Journal article, it was cited as the book &#34;most often finished&#34; by readers. So, it is inexplicable that 37% of the nearly 13,000 Amazon reviews rate it 3 stars or less.  Perhaps those are the readers that went to public schools, or gave 50 Shades of Grey 5 stars.  My advice is to, by all means, read this wonderful book.
B00DJFIMW6|1|I loved this game and when I updated it, the game stopped working and slipped really bad which caused me to continuously die. Deleting now!
B001IBIHQ4|4|The superb HBO Miniseries \\"The Pacific\\" is another remarkable collaborative production effort by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks. It follows the US Marine Corps through the horrific World War II Pacific battles of Guadalcanal, Cape Gloucester, Peleliu, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa.  Short interludes in Melbourne, Australia; Paris Island; and some stateside hometowns provide a jarring counterpoint to the battle scenes.<br /><br />Comparisons with \\"Band of Brothers\\" are perhaps inevitable.  \\"Band of Brothers\\" had the advantage of following a single unit through the war, and was derived primarily from Stephen Ambrose's superb book of the same name.  The narrative thread of \\"The Pacific\\" is the experience of three individual Marines whose lives are reasonably well documented.  However, their stories overlap minimally, and the ensemble feel and continuity of \\"Band of Brothers\\" is lacking.  Perhaps in compensation, \\"The Pacific\\" is a gritty, violent, and painfully graphic presentation of what it was like to be a Marine in the Pacific war.<br /><br />The three Marines featured in the miniseries are meant to be broadly representative of the Corps.  John Basilone is a pre-war Marine who wins the Medal of Honor at Guadalcanal, and is sent home to sell war bonds.  He will fight to return to duty, first as a trainer of new Marines, then as a leader of troops at Iwo Jima.  Robert Leckie joined up after Pearl Harbor and survived the fighting on Guadalcanal before being sent home for wounds suffered at Peleliu.  Eugene Sledge joined up a little later, held out by a medical condition, and would serve \\"With the Old Breed\\" at Peleliu and Okinawa, as his autobiography puts it.  He carries the narrative to the end of the war, in the mud and carnage of an Okinawan battlefield populated by large numbers of civilians as well as combatants.  A final episode captures the efforts of the survivors to reintegrate back into civilian life.<br /><br />Each episode of \\"The Pacific\\" opens with a few remarks by surviving veterans and a voice-over narrative by Tom Hanks that connects the episodes.  Every effort appears to have been made to show authentic uniforms, weapons, and equipment.  The individual episodes run less than an hour, but they pack an emotional punch that should be plenty for all but the most hardened viewers.  \\"The Pacific\\" is highly recommended to those viewers who found \\"Band of Brothers\\" to be a worthwhile experience.ns and a voice-over narrative by Tom Hanks that connects the episodes.

0345803507|3|I felt there was too much S&M.  The love story itself was nice and could have been nicer with out all the S&M.
B00IIUATDM|2|This movie contained too much bad behaviour. This was totally unnecessary to convey the theme out the movie. I turned it off after it portraits too mix drugs, sex and profanity.
B003GYEGNO|4|Even though this was written 30 years ago, i still found it fascinating.  As a Brit, i was amazed and aghast at the portrayal of the diifferent strata of NY society.  i found the law process intriguing and the corruption, resentment, the 'favor' system, the deals, the violence, all interesting and valid.  The plot is secondary to the process , but i did enjoy the fall from grace that Kramer and the accused man suffered.  Of course, Bacon and the girl, the most corrupt 'won'  T'was ever thus.
B00J2PFPVI|3|So everyone told my wife and I that we had to see this movie. Ok, we did. Now I can say I have seen it. Do I think it was the best movie Disney ever made? No, but I'm 52 so I still love Bambi and 101 Dalmatians! I really didn't get the movie. Seemed like a silly plot that was never explained? How did she get those powers? There was no evil anybody trying to kill her and take her powers. It was just a story about how being powerful can be dangerous if you use your power without care.<br />Ok, if I ever get a magical power, I'll be careful not to zap my little sister with it.
B006U1LYP8|5|just as described and reasonable price....
B000XUBFE2|5|I really enjoyed this book. Great perceptions of the war from a child.<br />Well written and overall a great story.
B002DQLGHU|5|Great movie.
B0069UP2PI|5|I loved this movie! A cold and clinical look at the pursuit of a pandemic. Beautifully acted, beautifully written. Not scary or gory, but more effectively thrilling and inspiring than any horror or apocalypse movie. If infectious diseases are your calling, this is a movie for you.
B003L77GGU|5|WELL THIS IS THE ONE TV SERIES I NEVER GET BORED WHILE WATCHING IT AGAIN AND AGAIN MUST SAY U SHOULD OWN THIS AND THE SIX SEASON AN EPIC ONE
B0009R1T7M|5|This album builds on the best parts of Sufjan's earlier Michigan album as well as Seven Swans. It has the lyrics and the great storytelling that make him a standout from so many dime-a-dozen 'singer-songwriters' out there.  There is some intelligent social commentary packed in without being heavy handed or overtly political.<br /><br />The music itself is beautiful.  He somehow retains his folk feel but goes all out with the strings and female backup vocals in several songs.<br /><br />The song \\"John Wayne Gacy\\" is probably the ultimate juxtaposition: lyrics that cover incredibly dark subject matter set to beautiful instrumentation and light vocals.<br /><br />Definitely worth owning.  Fans of Wilco, Stephen Malkmus, the Shins, Damien Jurado, or Elliott Smith should give Sufjan a listen.
B00063EMJ6|5|No matter how many years.  Never get tired of Neil Young!
B00KW23WOC|1|This is a disgrace to the Jack Ryan franchise.  Makes Jack Ryan seem like some kind of superhero with super powers instead of the interesting intellectual from The hunt for red october and patriot games.

B00H8C4HZ2|1|Not what I thought the movie would be.Lots of big name stars, but overall, not a very &#34;satifiying&#34; experience. Disappointed in the movie.
B005XQLBU4|4|This game is simple and great. I could spend hours playing it especially on a long trip. its hard to stop once you start playing, you just want to see how far you can go.
B009UX2YAC|5|Love it best game ever better than temple run 1 and 2 totally recommended!  You should really get it good for all ages young and old
B001NLL93W|4|And so the story ends with  \\"City of Glass\\"<br /><br />Clare did not disappoint with her final installment of \\"The Mortal Instruments\\" books.  I thought...for about 5 chapters...that I was going to hate it. That I was going to finish this series being pissy and agitated and would have to make up my own ending just to satisfy my overactive head,  but FINALLY it turned around.<br /><br />The book was epic, in that 20 chapters of unadulterated fighting sorta way. I was introduced to even more demons, (One which had a weird resemblance to an old boss of mine.) I learned how to relieve people of those  pesky little problems called hands (with nothing but a whip), and the long awaited prodigal mother returned...only to get an ass chewing from her 16 year old daughter.<br /><br />I was surprised, pleasantly, by how the \\"Evil\\" Jonathan was introduced, and was saddened by his actions while his crazy-half demon-demented self stalked around Idris.  Clare fixed that little \\"oogie\\" problem that arose in \\"City of Bones\\" and despite my conscience telling me otherwise I actually started to like a pesky, flamboyant 600 year old Warlock.<br /><br />Overall... I enjoyed it.  It was long; which even my husband noticed considering I spent all day yesterday glued to my Kindle, but at least when it finally came to the end, I actually got a well thought out ending, complete with fireworks and nifty bright pink drinks.<br /><br />The Clave learned a lesson, The Downworlders and Shadowhunters learned tolerance, and a certain Vampire finally grew into his own shoes.<br /><br />Who knew I would walk away from these books having learned something.... the most important thing...If someone ever offers you an \\"Herbal Drink\\" while your pregnant...kindly decline...and then find the closest exit.<br /><br />Happy Demon Hunting.... now... what in the world do I read next?
B00JMI40WK|5|Funny movie. Aniston is hot as a brunet
B001675SOY|5|Good album
B00BD99JMW|2|I'm still feeling too raw from what I read but I'm going to try and review this.<br /><br />First of all, I have quite a few issues with the book that don't even involve..THAT. I felt that even though the writing was really good as always, the voice of both the main leads changed drastically.<br />I understand that circumstances led to that but it was very over the top in my opinion and not consistent with what we've known in the past 2 books about them.<br />Also, I felt that there was a bit of dragging in the beginning and a lot of repetition during the entire book that was basically trying to complicate a plot that in the end is really quite simple. And the fact that it is actually that simple doesn't do everything that happened the justice it should. It seemed to me that the entire mood and vibe and puprose of the last book changed and wasn't totally in keeping with the original, very promising, premise. Of course this is completely the author's prerogative, to do with her book whatever she wants with it, but that doesn't mean I have to like where the conclusion went.<br /><br />Now, for THAT part..Even though I never ever read books that have such endings, I might had been somewhat ok with it if I felt that what happened actually served a purpose. I didn't see that purpose at all, especially with the way it was done and the many things/plot development/characters' change that lead up to it (which I dont want to comment on cause I'm afraid of spoiling too much even though this is a spoiler-alert review!).
B00A8ECU24|5|I love love love this game!!I don't like how you have to get Rarity and Sweetybelle to finish the game and they both cost gems though. Other than that this game is great
B00HQLFCIG|5|Better than I thought.  Good acting. Showed how thes pirates operate.  Would watch it Again!0
B000000I0I|5|I first heard Ommadawn when I was in college, maybe age 19.  Now, 24 years later, I still find it one of the most affecting, soulful, beautiful and inspiring pieces of music I've ever heard (especially side 1).  It's the sort of thing I used to lie in my dorm room with my girlfriend of the time and listen to with the lights out.  How to describe it: a cosmic, atavistic, almost tribal hymn; a chorus to this world and every other, a play of the gods, a dance of angels...  I could go on, and maybe I would start to sound kind of silly or corny, but it's all true.  If you want to hear music that can really affect you, this is it.  It is timeless.
B005KELQEU|3|It looks good and is easily used.Fits in your hand well. I would buy this item for any one who has a kindle
B0063IH60K|5|It's very fun. Can play this for hours. It's just awesome. I recommend this to everyone who enjoys a good game of Solitaire.
B007XKEY6Q|5|Finally ive been waiting for this game i kept tyiping in draw with friends dont have it and now they do yay :)!!!!
B007J4T2G8|5|Interesting. Hoping for a happy ending, but left in Suspense. Romantic but  challenges feminism.  Have to read the second one...
B009K0P10K|5|Some people may not watch this show, because of the title.  I know that the title kept me from watching it for the first season; but there is so much more to the show than Revenge.  It is actually more about what Revenge Requires; the Attitudes Required, the Sacrifices Required, the LOSS Required.  It is about what you give up when you take Revenge as your one and singular goal (emotional [Love] attachments, peace of mind, the safety of your friends, family and your own personal safety).  It's this lesson that makes the show a Positive Force against Revenge.  The characters are all wrapped up in their own lives and struggles and everyone makes mistakes.  It teaches us that as well.  It teaches us Perspective and Forgiveness, but Most of All, it teaches us that life is just a lot Simpler, if we do not keep secrets from the ones we love and trust.
0783219733|4|So far, I've purchased at least two copies of this DVD, the last one purchased directly from Amazon on January 4, 2012, and there seems to be no subtitles, and the audio languages menu is greyed out on my computer's DVD player. On the description of the DVD on your website, it says there's supposed to be tracks in English, French, and Spanish. But all I have is an English track. Is there a way I can get a copy where someone has made sure all three language tracks I've described are available, along with subtitles and all the menus that are supposed to be there on the DVD?

B002VECM6I|5|First, let me lay a couple of cards on the table.  I don't usually like Sandra Bullock.  Also, I don't like football, and therefore I don't like football movies (with the exception of KNUTE ROCKNE: ALL AMERICAN).  In fact, there are just a handful of sports movies that I do like.    But THE BLIND SIDE is not a sports movie.  (Or if it is, then it's the kind that's not really about sports.)  It's a movie about family.  And it boldly states that your family is not necessarily the people you're biologically related to or share the same skin color with.  Your family is the people you live with and cannot live without.    Michael Ohr is the quintessential - gigantic but timid and gentle - hero that everyone would love to have by their side.  And so is his adopted mother, Leigh Anne (portrayed by Sandra Bullock in what is easily her best performance).  One of the more important lessons Leigh Anne teaches Michael is to protect your family and loved ones both on and off the field.  When one of his former acquaintances speaks disparagingly of Leigh Anne and her daughter and then threatens him he....Actually, I don't quite remember what he did - it all happened so fast.  But one guy was slammed into a wall, and I think one was thrown against another.  And it seemed like he nearly caved in a stairwell.  It was so fast, it made Jason Bourne look like The Nutcracker.    One of the many things I love about THE BLIND SIDE is that the family is a family of faith.  Sean and Leigh Anne are Christian parents and extend Christ-like love to Michael.    I cannot conclude this review without stating my favorite line from the movie.  Leigh Anne has been threatened by an inner city thug who also plans to harm Michael.  She rips him a new one even in front of his hoodlum buddies and says, \\"I'm in a Bible study with the D.A., and I'm a card-carrying member of the NRA!\\"    While this movie is very much about family, it is definitely not a family movie.  It earns its PG-13 rating quite well.  It's not for the younger kids.  But it has a better message than probably any other film you're likely to find.
B00ILHW6AG|5|Revival is a modern day Frankenstein. With a mass of electrified body parts, and the same tortuous emotion as delivered in King's masterpiece The Shining, Revival is a riveting and relished return to the writing style that made us fall on love with him in the first place.  Brilliant!
B000068TPN|3|With the cast, and hype of this film at the time of its release, I expected something more, something akin to \\"Saving Private Ryan\\".....but it wasn't to be.....although this DVD wouldn't be part of my collection if I didn't like it. Also, I hear the Blu-Ray version is excellent so that's tempting to buy.    \\"We Were Soldiers\\" had things I appreciated that are rare in today's action films: 1 - a pro-military film concerning a Viet Nam war battle; 2- fairly tame language. This is not pro-Viet Nam War.  Hollywood would never do that, but at least it shows the soldiers in a solid, valiant light. It's also refreshing to see good references to God and prayer.    It's  this film that I thought the violence was overdone, not \\"Saving Private Ryan.\\"  The action here doesn't start for 40 minutes, but when it does it loud, it's heavy and it's continuous over most of the next 95 minutes.Shorter periods of the violent scenes would have made this much better, maybe even an \\"excellent\\" film.    Madeline Stowe had a memorable scene delivering message of war deaths to their spouses. That was touching stuff. But, mostly, this is an action film and the battle scenes are gruesome at times, particularly near the end of the film.
B000P0J09M|1|Avoid the DVD version at all costs. This is a great movie but you deserve better. This is a low quality. Spend the extra dollars for the Blu Ray format. You deserve it.
B00DPM90C4|5|It is thrilling, suspenseful. No artificial machinations to make it come out right, just a good story line. I would wait for his next book.
B005ZOBNOI|4|Shows that true love is blind.  It doesn't see illness or ugliness.  Even in such young people.  Youth feels things so intensely without the years of experience that over time dulls our senses.  First love is sharp and intense.  We all remember our first love looking back on it through our life times.  Remembering our first kiss.  First time holding hands that are sweaty from nerves.  That feeling of breathlessness as we stand next to our first love.  Thinking that every minute away from our love feels like a year.
B00AW735QC|1|Didn't get this!
B0054JZC6E|4|its a great game set but the ads keep popping up after you finish one game. but overall its fun to waste time on
B00459GJUM|5|wished there was more
034580404X|5|I don't read. Like at all. Someone suggested these books to me. And I read them. I couldn't stop reading I read them all in less then a week. It wasn't even the dirty stuff I was into. It was just the fact it's so entertaining and exciting. I bought it for my kindle and I just had to have the books. All my friends hat have read these books love them too. If your into romance and don't mind a little sexual stuff (ok maybe a lot in this case) this is a good investment/ read for you.
B009POCG2C|5|I love this movie.  Love everything about the baseball games inserted and the way they showed the process a talent scout goes through to make the right decisions for his baseball team.<br /><br />Great interaction between Clint, Amy and Justin.  Made me a believer.
B0049D1TCM|4|Nice CD<br />Plesantly surprised...I like NM but I didnt think I would like her enough to buy her CD. My daughter told me I would like it and she was right!!
B00BWJ91XK|5|IF YOU HAVE READ THE HOBBIT DON'T WORRY THAT SHOULDN'T RUN YOUR FUN WITH THIS MOVIE.<br /><br />MAN AS SOON AS THE QUEST STARTED IT WAS ONE TRAVESTY AFTER THE OTHER. NOW I KNOW IT COULD BE TIRING AFTER AWHILE, BUT FOR NERDS AND GEEKS, WE LOVED IT!<br /><br />I RECOMMEND IF YOUR A SELF PROCLAIMED GEEK OR NERD WATCH THIS MOVIE.
B0001ZMWQO|3|After hearing \\"Take Me Out\\" on the radio, I bought this on vinyl and have given it a few spins.  I'm not disappointed but I'm not enthralled with it either.  This album definitely has its moments and shows a lot of promise.    The first single, \\"Take Me Out\\" is a fantastic piece of dance rock.  \\"This Fire\\" and \\"Darts of Pleasure\\" are also great songs.  Unfortunately, besides those three songs, there's not a whole lot that grabs me.  The album really isn't that bad, but it's not one that you'll look back on in five years and be saying \\"Now there's a gem!\\"  This record shows a lot of promise and I'll be looking forward to Franz Ferdinand's next album to see if they can improve on this record.
B00EMXBDMA|5|Very good read!
B007R12TNQ|5|My son loves this movie. Fun story, great music.
B0031RAOVY|5|I saw this movie on night on the Family Chanel .I never saw the start of the movie. But by the end I cried like it was my dog.<br />  well now I saw the start of the movie, I  was crying all  threw the whole movie. Great movie.<br />If you love pets you will love is movie.<br /> I love the way they uses the Japanese part in the being of the movie .Paying tribute to the org movie. Great touch.<br /><br />think I will pass it on to she my sister to she her loose it by the end of the movie.<br />:)
B005DJREJS|4|I think the writers have created a well crafted comedy.  If you are tired of the same old slap stick style comedy shows this show is a pleasant surprise albeit not necessarily suited for younger audiences.
B0063GORYU|5|Gotta luv it;*)
B007A6XLDU|3|It's OK, but there are better version out there.
0525478817|5|I first picked up this book on a whim. Having heard a lot of talk about how it has made everyone cry I thought I would give it a try. This is the first book I have EVER read that has made me cry. l could not put this book down, I finished it in two days. I highly recommend this book to everyone.
B004X6PRO6|1|I thought the novel was too contrived to have any validity.  It could have given a depiction of North Korean life that was more believable.
B008M721MS|1|This is the most frustrating app I have ever used.  I can video chat on average, 3-4 minutes before the call will drop.  Unfortunately, that is only about a 3 of 10 on the frustration level that this app is about to take me on.  After the call drops, I recall the person I was talking to only to get a black screen.  I can't end the call, I can't back out of it, I can only wait until the app decides it is not working correctly and gives me an error message with the option to wait or end the app.  Ending the app will take you back to the main page where you can either try and call the person back and repeat the black screen of Skype purgatory or exit the app completely.  So after surviving Skype purgatory and fully exciting the app, you think, okay let's try this again.  Maybe exiting the app has reset it and I can get another 3-4 minutes of video time.  You enter the app, everything looks good, you dial and find yourself immersed back into blackness and understand that you are not in Skype purgatory but in the depths of Skype hell where no calls are ever made and you are doomed to relive the same horrors again and again.  The only escape is to restart your system and stay far away from icy grips of Skype Lucifer.  Heed the warning and flee from this app as it only brings darkness and gnashing of teeth.

B00WSD2BGS|5|Such a sweet and visually appealing movie!  We thoroughly enjoyed it!  Great story and fun characters!
B005LAIGW8|5|A fascinating film.
B00992CF6W|4|How do you play realms and get the latest update they need to do something about that and I want villagers it would be so cool if you could build a town and spawn villagers but not happy with it
0783225733|5|Great movie of a historical event.  Love it.  I show this to my students every year.<br />Worthwhile.  Suspenseful.  Good example of problem solving skills.
B007W8S2MG|5|This game is incredibly fun, the story is just so entertaining because the game is very well written. The characters are so well done that I'm seriously attached to all of them. I have to admit that this is my first time playing a Persona game, but now I'm hooked and looking forward to Persona 5.<br /><br />I had always read that this game was really fun, but I never really gave it a chance; fast forward to a time that my gaming PC and my ps3 were being moved across the US and I had plenty of time to not only play this game, but thoroughly become engrossed by it.<br /><br />So do yourself a favor and buy this game, you will not regret it!
B003VDZK8K|5|What can I say about Avenged Sevenfold? I saw them at the Uproar Festival in Kansas City in 2011... lots of fire, special effects, and a giant demon head with fire blasting out of it too. At the time, I wasn't overly amused, it was hot when I got there and the temperature had dropped to about 40° and I was in shorts and a t-shirt! Just bad timing... the music grew on me after I bought the album. Good stuff (substitute real word)!
B00LFN0376|1|She is annoying.
B00FVZJYK6|5|Great Family movie! My 6 year old daughter loves the minions, and I love the minions! Its always a go to on movie night, never fails to make us laugh.

B00ADQPB50|5|My wife's  request
B007UXTG8M|1|I should've researched what this movie was about before I watched it. The theme was not appealing to me. I would not recommend this movie.
B002RXVOX0|5|I haven't watched this CD but did see the movie when it first came out.  I thought Frank Langella was the sexiest Dracula ever and I hate vampire movies especially the current ones which are disgusting.  Nothing sexy about the new ones!
B006LSZECO|4|I loved the story especially the twist! I just don't like that the characters are so unlikable. Neither of them can redeem themselves and at the end of the book I can say I wasn't rooting for either of them. Hated how the book ended. I wanted to throw my kindle at a wall but overall I really loved the story. Can't wait for the movie!!!
030746363X|5|This book changed my life with how I thought about diet and exercise.  I use to think that if I worked out enough, I'd look great.  It turns out that DIET is a HUGE part of looking great and excerise is a small percentage for that transformation.  Thanks Tim, for empowering me to take my self image into my own hands
B00JNQKR46|4|Interesting, easy to read, thought-provoking.
B003ZHR6RK|5|i like watching a true story and history because i learn any experiance a caracter in film to my life
B0055SWM08|5|This app is a favorite app of mine. I find this to be well made and more challenging with each level. I would recommend it to logic puzzle fans.
B0074D3CAQ|5|This is a beautifully written narrative about the ordinary and unspeakable facets of life. It covers a lifetime, rich with parallels for anyone.
1401216676|5|This book came when expected, although a little late it in the day. I already knew what the product was and had read it before, but wanted another copy. Very happy with the process. This is a great graphic novel, if you are into them.
B00MRHANNI|5|Love this CD. Delivery was quick. Much more convenient to have it mailed to avoid the holiday rush on foot.
B0069G5Z9K|5|My friend told me about this game and I like. I gave this game 5 stars because it is a cool game.
B000YRY8BG|5|I heartily agree with the high praises this production has accrued.  It is a masterful blend of an intelligent and throughly credible story-line, superb acting, a finely-tuned pitch of suspense, and thought-provoking relevance.  Highly recommended.
B00AEFYJZ8|5|All time favorite. love this movie. It touches many lives in real life, when in love you will defend that love.
0786962984|4|I played the original Dungeon! board game with my family and friends as a child. Now that I'm a father of an eight year old boy I was excited to find a remake of it available since most vintage games are incomplete and overpriced. This version is wonderfully done with beautiful artwork, clean design and quality workmanship. The only improvement I would suggest would be to include molded miniatures instead of card board stand ups. The D&D tie-in is a nice bonus. Bravo Wizards Of The Coast! Keep the remakes coming and keep the prices accessible for families that want to play and not just collect these games.
B0054JZC6E|3|fast and fun. easy game play. good for any age. I recommend buying extra points to speed up access to games. most are easy to play.
B00FAPF5U0|5|is really fun to play. is addicting in a fun way. when I get stuck on a level I will stop playing for a couple days then come back and then I can usually complete level.
B00B0A5XQU|5|I really enjoyed this book. The women characters all were from different backgrounds and faced different issues. They grew to be stronger women and close friends. I recommend this book.
B002M5E2DW|5|I really enjoyed the book.  Very positive and useful.  I believe it provides a lot of concepts that folks can use for real practical &#34;value add&#34; to one's life.  A lot of time we deal with a lot of external life &#34;noise&#34; that creates anxiety, consternation, despair and hopelessness.  Its hard to verbalize those issues to family and friends. (in regards to providing assistance, when sometimes, this approach compounds a bad situation, because you get bad input)  This book,  in my opinion, provides clear advice, and/ or direction on modifying your thoughts that enable you to address any issue, concern, or anxiety from an internal perspective.  I have added to my life &#34;tool box&#34;.  Total self reliance.  Great book!
B00BG08FKK|5|If you loved the movie, you will love the Motion Picture Soundtrack.  It brings all of the emotions of the movie into your home, car, or anywhere else you may be.  I would recommend this purchase for anyone that cannot get enough of Les Miserables.
B00457X7XQ|3|The plot was good and the author clearly knows the topic of IT security. But the characters lack depth and more importantly, there are a large number of long sections explaining the technology or exploit. Almost as if this was a textbook wrapped in a story to make more interesting. It's not quite that bad, but that gives the idea. I read it through to the end, but won't be reading any more in the series. If you're looking for something similar, but better, checkout Suarez's novels. Bottom line: O.K., but there are too many better books to spend time with. Not recommended.
B007TKT2SK|4|TODLERS ARE TOO YOUNG YET
B0000669JL|5|Bob Marley was long before my time, he died when I was one week old, but that really does not matter, his music is classic and timeless. This was the first Reggae CD I had ever bought and I think it will probably be the best one I ever get. Fourteen tracks total \\"Legend\\" has a nice mix of songs, love songs, songs about poltics and and oppression, and songs about empoyerment. \\"No Woman No Cry\\" really stands out for me as one of the nicest tracks on the album, a political song about oppression with a powerful chorus that makes you sing along, with a good message which is something along lines of never give up, keep your faith, keep your hope. \\"Three Little Birds\\" has a similar message, and is a melodic feel good song. \\"Buffalo Soldier\\" is a song about slavery and black men fighting for American Independence\\", Bob Marley is dropping some history knowledge on this one, songs got a really catchy sound. \\"Get Up Stand Up\\" uses a heavy bass groove, and is a fast paced track that is about fighting oppression. \\"Stir it up\\" is a relaxed slow love track, which has nice grooves and rhythm.\\"One Love\\" combines piano and guitar, and is a positive feel good song about loving the lord, loving each other. \\"I Shot the Sheriff\\" is a powerful song about oppression in Jamaica, first heard this song remixed by Warren G, like this  original alot more. \\"Redemption Song\\" is a sad and wonderful song, about fighting for freedom, Marley uses Acoustic Guitar, and though the song has a sad sound, its deep and moving. \\"Exodus\\" uses organ, continous guitar rifts, and horns, and is a fast paced track. \\"Jamming\\" is a great track to close off the album, a relaxed track with a laid back groovy sound too it. \\"Bob Marley's \\"Legend\\" is an excellent album, and if you are to buy just one Reggae album get this one.
B00BMT9SQA|5|Love Striesand, good movie had to have it for my collection. She is very good at comedy, besides being one of the worlds great singers.
B004ZG5EYC|5|I am a typical guy-movie guy. I love to see things blow up, bad kung-fu, random shots of cleavage, etc. And I would NEVER pick up a French movie on my own. NEVER. Somehow, this movie shows up on my list of Netflix recommendations. They knew that I cry during Disney movies and try to hide it from my wife and kids. This movie made me cry, but I was crying because I was so happy, and this movie is beautiful, just unbelievably beautiful. This movie is about creating joy in the life of others, as well as in your own life. But not the kind of joy that comes from instant gratification. Its the kind of joy that takes days, weeks, and months to develop. In fact, this movie is really about delayed gratification of a kind so profound that it happens as a complete surprize when it finally arrives. The direction is wonderful and quirky. The acting is superb, and the musical score is also unique and fitting. If you've ever wondered about how to make a difference in your life or the life of others without being a CEO or a Senator, this is your movie. ENJOY!
0380002930|5|A look through the many reviews of this book raises an interesting question:  Is this book really a classic (a la Dickens, Eliot, Hemingway etc.)?  I think my answer would be no.  However, I do think it is an excellent introduction to those wonderful authors and I'm happy to see it's being taught in our schools.<br />Watership Down is a very sophisticated form of popular fiction.  Don't think so?  Well, it provides at least three distinct social structures (the three main warrens), addresses the issues and complexities of leadership (Hazel isn't the obvious leader-type), and comments on differing psychologies (think of the denizens of the warren near the snare) all in the form of a complex allegory.  It has other depths as well, but the point I want to make is that these are wrapped up in a compelling adventure story written from the unique perspective of fantasy.  Add in the fact that it's gracefully written and you have a book that is appealing to young people but provided plenty of material for conversation and thought.<br />Is it on the level of, say, George Eliot or Joseph Conrad?  I don't think so.  It provides a heroic and happy ending that while exciting, isn't convincingly realistic.  In addition, though the characters are wonderfully drawn, they clearly &quot;wear&quot; white hats or dark ones when the real world tends to be gray.<br />That said, I remember struggling through &quot;Lord Jim&quot; in high school and feeling like I missed alot of what was being said.  Reading it 20 years later confirmed that opinion.  It isn't that I was stupid in high school--I simply lacked enough life experience to appreciate the subtleties of what Conrad was getting at. <br />I've always felt that teaching the great classics in high school is, at best, a questionable undertaking.  Far better to teach a book on the level of &quot;Watership Down&quot; (and there aren't many books in this middle region between popular and classic), so that young readers learn how to read critically, than to have them drown trying to understand a complicated classic.  After they learn critical reading skills, then move them on to a true classic.  <br />There are those who will say I'm condescending to kids suggesting this, but it's equally legitimate to suggest that it is arrogant to assume that ALL teenagers can understand the subtlety of books which adults write long tomes analyzing. <br />Lest this tome makes &quot;Watership Down&quot; sound like a textbook, let me say that when I first read it 20 years ago, I could not put the book down.  The last 150 pages carry the reader along like a tidal wave.  I've read it several times since and each time I happily sank into the wonderful world of Hazel, Bigwig and the others.  It's a book that both adults and kids can appreciate and it doesn't suffer with age.  So maybe it's a classic after all.
B00003CX5P|5|Despite constant debate about the subject of the prequels, once you lay all that aside and look at the movie itself, you realize that The Phantom Menace is indeed a very good movie. There were some very big shoes to fill when Phantom was released and for the most part, people felt like there was something missing. As this movie ages however, I feel that it will begin to grow into those shoes.<br />Set many years before the first trilogy, Phantom Menace introduces the viewer to many new characters along with introducing us to younger versions of some of the classics such as C-3P0 and Obi Wan. The story becomes very interesting once the viewer sees the movie for a second time, after the initial shock has set in and settled down. The movie does a nice job of setting the groundwork for the next two and begins to answer some of the questions about Darth Vader's past. There are dazzling special effects, a very intelligent storyline and great action sequences. The light saber battles are incredible and leave even the most disgruntled viewer feeling pleased.<br />Most people would rather complain about something instead of enjoy it, eventually people will forget about their petty quarrels with the movie and settle down to enjoy the movie as well as the other two prequels. This is a must see for any Star Wars fan young or old.
B00004TH7Z|5|Excellent purchase and service
B005CRQ4OW|4|My kid loved it! He really thought it was funny. We will never look at cheese the same again! Good book.
B007RI56NY|4|I have really been enjoying this album. It has some great songs on it.  So happy with Train's new work!!!
B0083B3KOQ|4|i wanted to convert my avi files to mp4 so i could watch them on my kindle,  but i didnt want to go through the hassle of using my desktop, so despite negative reviews i figured id try this.i just finished converting my first movie, and i was successful, but the process was SOOOO SLOW.it took two hours to convert a 66mb file. if you are impatient,  i wouldnt recommend this app. otherwise, it is free and does work,  just be prepared for a long wait!
B0000AQVCL|4|Just had to say, it's great to hear the Iggy Pop &quot;Lust For Life&quot; riff on &quot;Are You Going To Be My Girl&quot; on the radio.  (Did you know that Iggy's &quot;The Passenger&quot; is background for a kid's play station game now?)
B00A9X9TIW|4|I wasn't sure what to expect with this movie but the trailer looked good enough to give it a try.<br />I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised. The story was very interesting if a little unbelievable, and by that I mean why is it the criminals have access to the technology and not the military. Seemed very odd. Still it was enjoyable and I personally liked the ending, not quite what I expected. Well worth a watch.
B004YM6JLO|3|Third season is okay. I think sometimes in third season are too many blood and violence, but then it wouldnt be a vampire show. Its so much better than other vampire shows.
B00DPM7TIG|5|The author`s writing  in this book was like music. Amazing writing and beautiful descriptions along  with a gripping story made it hard to put down.
B0089EHWQE|5|I really enjoyed the book. I won't go into the story as there are enough out there to do that but I really thought the characters were real and believable which to me is critical in a good book. I was disappointed that we never heard from Will, it would have been nice to hear what his thinking was from his own perspective. Parts of the book are real tear-jerkers.
B00TU9UFTS|5|excellent movie watched it on instant video with amazon firestick,movie played flawlessly
B008EL25LE|5|Excellent
B000FC2L1E|5|This is a great book.  It is packed full of action.  I enjoy Gabaldon's books because of the historical nature of them, but she is also very good with dialogue.
B00A88FLI0|5|Exactly was my six year old son wanted! It's a ton of pieces and will keep him busy for hours!
B000AGTPUK|5|This will become a traditional Christmas classic or perhaps it already has!  Tom Hanks does a marvelous job playing the roles of four characters...actually five in the end.
B0028T6XXY|5|such a great concert.
B00D7Z4GQY|4|A little predictable but overall I enjoyed it and couldn't wait to see how it ended.  I liked the characters and could relate to their feelings.  I recommend this book.
B006BXT4TI|5|This is one the absolute best albums of the year. I love every song on it, and it's perfect to listen to in the car or even at work when you need a pick-me-up. It's so upbeat and fun. The standout songs to me are &#34;Little Black Submarines&#34; and &#34;Gold On The Ceiling,&#34; but they're all great. Buy this album!
B005ZOBNOI|5|If this isn't my favorite of all the books I've read, it is definitely #1 out of anything I have read recently. The characters in the book are well developed and realistic. I laughed, I cried and about a million other cliches. Seriously though, I really did bawl my eyes out while reading the last few chapters of the book. This book is worth your money. Buy it! Read it! You'll love it!
B00910Y1OQ|4|Good graphics and match three play but slow.  You have to pause for a second between matches - the technology may be slightly behind...  But it keeps me engaged with increasingly challenging layouts.
B00AKOB7CG|5|No secret I have three words, I LOVE IT!!<br />Greatest one of all & I workout a lot!!!<br />Is is a KEEPER! 😎Must have....
B00DQR26EC|5|What a gem.  Doom &amp; Destiny is a fun take on the &amp;#34;retro&amp;#34; rpg that has been all the rage lately (probably because they run on EVERYTHING). Good story, good dialog, surprisingly &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; humor and sound effects and music are tops too. Plenty lengthy for a mobile game too which is another nice surprise. Oh did I mention no IAP? All too rare nowadays. HeartBit deserves sales for that alone.
B00HDMMISA|5|The premise was a little contrived but the story was compelling with a few surprises.  A good look at domestic violence.
B00881VLCE|4|I absolutely love this app!  Between the daily puzzles &amp; the free puzzle packs, there is plenty to keep you busy without having to spend any money.  If you make the decision to buy packs, they are priced very reasonably.  I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because it crashes on occasion &amp; the inability to change the music (unlike on the apple version) .
B00BHNQ5XK|5|Let's begin with wow!  Wow was this movie scary!  Sinister takes the audience on a hair raising ride as you follow Ethan Hawke's character on a fact finding mission for his new book.  He is a true crime author and has unwittingly put himself and his family in danger.  This movie keeps you guessing and certainly keeps your imagination growing.  If you are thinking of watching this movie here is a checklist I feel you should complete ahead of time.  Fist off make sure you turn a light on if it is dark outside. If you are alone call a friend over to watch this with you because to watch Sinister alone is simply crazy!  Lastly next time you move to a new house and you go into your attic and there is a box of old films...DO NOT WATCH THEM!  Simply call your agent and get a refund..lol!
B001ANSSDC|5|It's one of those rare books that catches your attention from the get-go. I loved it from beginning to end.  I was touched and teary-eyed while reading some of the chapters.  It was that engrossing! Highly recommended!
B00QW8TYWO|5|Just like favorite game trigger but better with prizes and more characters
B000ICZD4I|5|It was a great movie! Loved the Acting! I don't like fried green tomatoes though. But the Movie was GREAT!
B00FAPF5U0|5|Yup, that's me. Addicted to this game. But  I know I'm not alone.  It's rreally a great game. Just downloaded  the app yesterday, but have been playing it on Facebook.
B002O2THRO|5|[[ASIN:B001K3EXTA The Great Gatsby (1974)]]<br /><br />While I really enjoyed the new film, the original still holds up.  The performances by Robert Redford, Mia Farrow and Sam Waterston were phenomenal!!!  I forgot how moving this movie was......<br />The whole build up was perfect up until the climax and the storytelling was intricate without being overtly blathering.<br />It is a classic story, a classic movie and an event in and of itself......
B00AIUUXHC|2|Ok so I was almost the great white shark and I needed 2000 more coins to unlock it and then the last time I got on it the totally reset the whole thing:( it made me so frusterated because I was so excited to get the great white and then it restarted the game.  this was a really fun game until that though and I ended up just deleting it from my kindle fire. If hungry shark didn't do whatever it just did I would've rated it 5 stars.
B00C7TAF3Y|5|This is the best game I have played in a very long time. I hope a new one comes out soon
0425252868|5|Wonderful book and finally a book about something positive done by a Luftwaffe airman.  Great story about comradely and respect for common warriors.
1595141979|5|I have never felt the need to write a review on any of the hundreds of books i've ordered on Amazon.com, but this one merited it.  I am an avid reader, and movie collector and have been a little annoyed lately that nothing suprises me anymore.  I can always see what's coming next.  But the ending of this book had me shouting out loud.  I was so loud the echo came back and scared me!  I laughed, i cried, i could almost feel my heart break.  What a fantastic book!  The entire series is great!  I of course won't give away anything, but just trust me you need to get this book.  I finished it and logged right on to pre-order the fourth book that comes out in August.  I love the original story line, the characters, however different, were very easy to relate to, and this series was so well written i was lost in the book and thought i was there!  I absolutely recommend this book to anyone.  But i would recommend reading the series in order.  Wow, great series, i can't wait for the fourth one, hurry up please!!!  :)
B00CNQ7HAU|1|the book was a throwaway for john grisham.  read it  through becsuse  thought it would get better<br /><br />it didn't. sorry.
B00P42WROG|5|I have loved Stephen King's  works  for two thrids of my life & that is a long time. I just hope he never retires. I will now anxiously awake the next book. This one was not what I expected but it was truly amazing. I still like King novels with more supernatural material in them the best but go writing & a great story makes this a great read.
B004T5K3OK|2|A nifty idea but it has a major issue--it has an image enhancement algorithm that often makes the image worse (i.e. less legible when dealing with text) than without the enhancement.  So far, I haven't found a way to disable the image enhancing and so it renders the whole app pretty useless.
B009C7ZQM4|5|use it a lot..simple easy program to use with you kindle. I will type more words for the review to allow me to finish.....
023076651X|5|Great!
B0032CVAQQ|5|Game changer
B0006GQMC8|4|The scenery is worth every penny.  The action is great also.  I would recommend this over almost all the action movies made today,
B005K17RU0|3|I'm not too sure about this app.  I keep trying to use it but I'm not sure I like the way it works....so the jury is still out on this one.
B0071XO8RA|5|I tend to be rather skeptical of post-apocalyptic science fiction. It's a trendy genre that's overwhelmingly full of negative, unrealistic, cookie cutter quasi-copies of other stories that invariably require anti-depressants to finish. A quick look through the genre on Amazon shows a collection of works that come across much like South Park and killing Kenny; an exercise in how many ways the  human race can die and leave a few survivors to stew in the aftermath amongst a climate of tween angst. If you're lucky, a vampire shows up in the end as a deus ex-machina and resolves all the plot holes. As such, my skeptical nature led me to put Wool off for months before trying it out. I regret having done that.<br /><br />As it turns out, Wool is the exception to the rule. The book is set in a believable moderately hard-sci scenario with an inventive plot that twists and turns and takes you into unknown territory throughout the story. The characters are relatable and interesting and there is no shortage of suspense throughout. The plot taps into deep vibes of what authority is, why social rules exist, and ultimately what happens when people feel they've been had by those memes. And then you're left pondering what happens when those memes are tossed out and something new must be started.<br /><br />Wool is a well-crafted book that delivers a page turner of a story. While it's not exactly the rosiest scenario for the future of humanity, it does bear a glimmer of hope for the future and suggests that something better could be. I give it an honest five stars, as it delivers well on all counts. I can't wait to move onto Hugh Howey's other work.
B00CKOYVG8|1|TOO SHORT...NOT INTERESTED IN PLAYING WITH OTHERS .. .. ONE PERSON ONLY! gET  A GRIP<br /><br />INJEK;{&#34;lp<br />&#34;<br />lT A GRIP AND AAAAAACCEPT
B008JFUNJQ|1|This is around as compelling as a bad after school tv movie. Boring, predictable and a waste of Harrison Ford. The teen cast is ludicrous. What a joke.
B00IMYSCR4|3|This was a nice adventure movie, but the way Sandra Bullocks character goes from escaping one crisis to another is a little far fetched.
B00VS8WIY4|5|“Cisco Bandits: A Gwynn Reznick Novel” is a new spy novel that I had not had the pleasure of reading, but I am glad that I found it since the main character is female in a male dominated genre. What I really enjoyed about Inge-Lise Goss’ novel is that she didn’t make Gwynn into some lovesick incompetent woman who couldn’t deal with having her boyfriend as her boss, but instead was able to power through the assignment given after learning more information while working at Prudell Energy Company.  Gwynn is a strong and very resourceful character who makes every situation work to whatever advantage she can find which is why I find her character to be so intriguing.  I enjoyed the little conversations that Rueben and Gwynn have together because although their work life is serious, they still find time to be fun and have some quick little laughs to keep the mood light.
B00I65ZGDC|3|The book is a good read overall, but i felt it was rushed and a lot of development was just left to the user's imagination. I have read the entire Percy Jackson series and Heroes of Olympus series, all of which were and still are excellent books. They had good character development and follow up, but this book in the series felt very rushed.<br /><br />SPOILERS!!!<br /><br />1. A lot of battles where like over in a page or three, it felt quite incomplete in the previous book the detailing was quite good and you just get sucked in and crave for more. After all the hype of Gaia being super powerful and being mother earth, after portraying so much and to get the battle over in like 3 pages with just one of the 7 who actually manages to do it all felt, i dunno empty.<br /><br />2. This book was all about Jason, Nico, Piper and Reyna, i am not against but hey! what happened to all the other a lot it was just let go of like loose ends for you to fill out.<br /><br />3. Even the battles with the giants was like to quick, Giants were supposed to be as strong or even stronger then the Titans, and after the troubled the Gods had with the Titans, for them to be able to defeat them in a matter of a page was quite disappointing.<br /><br />This book has just left a void on so many things. It's a good read mind you, but not excellent especially if compared to the previous books.It has just left a lot of things hanging, which i believe should have made the book the best in the series.

0142405809|5|I love this story, it's not my son's favorite but he does enjoy it. I'm sure as he gets older he will appreciate it a little more. It is a nice break from the typical child stories.
B000H30B2C|3|Peter Jackson's King Kong is a potentially great movie undone by excess.  Set design, special effects, acting, and overall 'atmosphere' are great.  There are scenes with real power like the one atop the Empire State Building and in Central Park.  But 'the whole' never quite clicked for me because it was too long and too much: too high a gross out quotient; too much improbability (and yes I know this is a movie about a giant ape and a lost island) such as the scene with the humans running amongst stampeding dinosaurs; and too much of a 'let's see if we can top the original movie' mindset like when Kong battling three T-Rexes (what's wrong with battling just one?).  After a while it all felt a little tedious despite the real positives mentioned above and particularly the standout performance by Andy Serkis as Kong.

B004GUSG4M|5|really was swoop put up by the story!  the plot was very intriguing as well as engaging.  I definitely recommend the book.
0792151712|4|I was very saddened when I started to rethink about such a historical tragedy.  Not to diminish any of the respect to the victims, I wish to note that this movie was worth seeing, maybe a little too realistic but  unfortunately this movie depicts  how life can be at times;sad.  But  through it all we meet Jack and Rose who prove that love stands stronger  than tragedy.
B001UV4XJ2|5|Thank you!
B00LU0P9L4|5|Fun game! Holds your interest and the story was good.
B005V1WVPA|4|When I heard the first single for this album, I was intrigued.  I like some dub-step, and I like some Korn, so I figured I'd probably like this.  Turns out I was right.  Some of the tracks I instantly liked, like Narcissistic Cannibal and Get Up, but some others I wasn't really digging.  But after a couple of replays, they started to grow on me.  Now I just keep listening to it over and over.  It's a huge departure for Korn, but it's not like their last few albums were that great anyway.  The fusion of Korn and dub-step works well and there are some really catchy tunes here.  If the thought of dub-step in your Korn makes you want to vomit, this album won't change your mind.  But if the concept has you interested, you should buy it.  You won't be disappointed.
B007CKNX28|5|Thought I'd give Jack White a try after viewing the film \\"It Might Get Loud!\\"  Glad I did....now this is good music!  I know I've heard of The White Stripes but never really heard anything they have done!  I will now seek out their CDs although I hear that this new CD is a little different and The White Stripes are more guitar driven songs!  Just what the doctor ordered I say!  Thanks Jack White...you beat the hell out of that Jack Black character!
B004SBS8LA|4|loving the new scenes...the monkeys...freeing the birds...can't wait to see what all this has in store for me as i pass different levels! the colors are bright and vivid!
0679722556|4|Perhaps that is too harsh, for Howard's End truly is a beautiful book.  It is sharp and cunning and written with craft and texture in unearthing the suppressed emotions of its characters.  Gorgeously written, simmering throughout with a subtle and witty prose, sometimes briefly alit with the whoosh of a roaring epiphiny.  The grace of the character study is a worthwhile experience . . .<br />But the story . . . So have ya heard this one before?  Some guy wants to get married but he's already married or he's engaged to another he's fallen out of love with.  The details just don't matter and the constant refrain of the character's endless longing is quiet acceptence complicated by questioning questioning guestioning.  The interactions are trivial and often uninteresting, propelled by the unspoken commentary, subdued by the spoken words amounting mostly to rejections.  This premise is at times intriguing, coaxed into narrative by the awareness of each of the speakers, but then dims out as they try to change the subject, leaving forever buried that one shimmering moment of light.<br />This is the refrain of this novel, for better or for worse--
0307341577|5|Just finished this book. It was yet again terrific. I thought I liked Gone Girl but this one was even better.
B0090SI4LU|3|For a sy fy  I sort of expected a little more.  But, in it's own was it was different.  I did like the fact the people at the end did learn that there is good in each other and can live among themselves in peace.
B002ZG976U|3|This film is mildly entertaining. Nothing special at all. I find Christina Aguilera could do so much better. Sadly, she lacks the pizzaz for that magic cabaret-style entertainer's character. Learn from Liza Minelli(Cabaret), Catherine-Zeta Jones(Chicago) and even the ice queen herself that is Nicole Kidman in Moulin Rouge! You got to really give your heart and soul and guts to be a stage entertainer Christina darling. Very shallow character.<br /><br />Cher is just there for the condiments. Stanley Tucci never changes his modus operandi since he is the same tired old gay man in practically every films that requires him to be a gay man. The songs are mediocre. it's entertaining but you feel cheated because you have seen many of the cliches happened in this film. It's not bad but it's not that great either. It would be better if these characters are given more depth and the songs are chosen very carefully. I am a big fan of Cher and Miss Aguilera, but this flick undermined<br />their talents. It could be better in my humble opinion.<br /><br />Rent first, that is my advice. If you like it, good for you. If you feel otherwise, well it doesn't hurt either. At least you know what's Burlesque is all about.
B005GY0Y8S|1|I thought maybe it was just me.  After reading the reviews I realize it wasn't.  What bothered me the most about this story was the characters.  It's hard to believe anyone could be that stupid.  The end is really bad.  How could anyone possibly forgive a person who committed extortion and was involved in kidnapping?  Unbelievable.
B00U7VDC7A|4|Fun engaging app. Tutorial is easy to follow. Would've given 5 stars but quest objects are really small and hard to find.
B0008ENHUI|5|One of the most haunting and interesting movies ever.  Have watched it more than 5 times. Great performances by both actors.
B00BEIYMZ6|5|Great movie. It's so funny.
B00H58VGIA|5|I love a book that pulls you in immediately and then has you turning pages as you are trying to stir the soup on the stove. I was so happy to have this book on a long trip.<br /><br />The story reminded me of a little known, out-of-print, book titled CHILDREN OF PRIDE. Children of Pride is directly taken from actual letters between a genteel slave owner and his family detailing the comings and goings of his slaves and his concern for them. He treated them well but his slaves were still slaves and deserted the family as soon as they could. THE INVENTION OF WINGS is historical fiction based on actual characters. Filled with cruelty, sadly it is still relevant today as slavery is still very much with us.As I read I was reminded of the suffering of modern day labor slaves and sex trafficked women.
B00DGMVJAO|4|The story line was simple to follow and flowed well.The special effects and detail in the giants looked very realistic. Overall a good movie
0545265355|5|Completely enjoyed the entire set.  Would recommend reading the books and watching the movies.  So good I could not put them down.
B008XKSW7M|5|Hilarious it has great perspectives and it amused me! I would reccomend it to anyone! Especially if you're having a baby!
B00A83075M|5|The storyline was deep and intelligent enough for adults to appreciate it, but not so much so that it was above a small child's head. The retro throwbacks-- adorable. And Fix it Felix and Vanelope and Calhoun were very much just Jack McBrayer and Sarah Silverman and Jane Lynch in animated form-- the personality shone completely through all three.<br />And, of course, how could you not love Ralph, the anti-hero of the story?  The old video game jokes were cute, but the fact that the \\"bad guys\\" went to \\"Bad anon\\" like alcoholic anonymous? That was hilarious. (Though, when he was clutching his cookie medal and saying the creedo? I CRIED...)<br />This hearkens back to the old Rankin Bass in that Misfits have a place too, but, it's more than that. It's about yes, everyone has their place, but YOU decide who YOU are. It was a beautiful movie and message. Loved it, loved it, and my kids have watched it eight times since getting it last Sunday (it's Friday)!<br />I think the part that choked me up the most was when he was talking about how if that one little girl loved him, he couldn't be SUCH a bad guy... and truly, Ralph WAS a hero. Cannot recommend this enough.

B00011F5DK|5|We bought Blockus for my 6 year old for Christmas & my entire family has enjoyed the game.  It was one of the 2 biggest hits for Christmas but one that is quick & easy to learn for all ages.  The adults are still trying to stratagize while my 6 year old is just happy to be able to play something with them.  I would highly recommend it to children of all ages from 5 up!  If I have the opportunity I may buy the travel blockus just so we can take it on the road.

B007M45PMU|4|I really like this album. The soulfulness of the lyrics combined with authentic musicianship of Schultz, Fraites and Pekarek make each of the songs special. I thought that Schultz voice on some of the songs reminded me of another recent artist named David Gray. I'd pay to see them.
B0079J28NW|5|Until I ordered this product, I had only seen bits and pieces of Yellow Submarine. Seeing the whole feature is a fantastic experience for anyone -- young, old, music fans, animation fans, fans of having fun, fans of pretty colors, and of course, Beatles fans. It is a visually spectacular tale filled with wonder, music and love. Viewing this now from an adult perspective, a few things are clear:<br /><br />  * This is truly a seminal work of animation. Even if not Beatles fans (why not?), this is a must-have for cinemaphiles and animation-philes. You can see how it influenced Terry Gilliam (Monty Python) among many others.<br />  * This is classic story-telling. A bit of Wizard of Oz, a dash of Tolkien, some quasi-vaudevillian comedy and FAB music.<br />  * The Beatles stay true to a couple of Beatle-y themes: 1) Self-reference - can you spot all the references to their songs in the script? 2) Love is all you need.<br />  * Apple really did put out some creative products before it destroyed the Beatles.<br />  * If you ever want to explain to someone what &#34;psychedelia&#34; means, have them watch Yellow Submarine.<br /><br />I read lots of reviews on here before buying this remastered product. I had no issues with the sound volume (loud, which is how I like it - and controllable by the listener anyway) or the visuals. Most colorful thing anyone will ever see. The accompanying booklet and cels are a nice bonus. Nothing not to like here.<br /><br />If you don't own this piece of history, you are a Nowhere Man. Or worse, maybe even a Blue Meanie.
B0086700CM|4|entertaining and annoying.  builds eye hand coordination. it does allow you to buy points for power ups but you can prevent RL money purchases with parent lock.
B005SFS4ZU|5|This is without doubt one of the finest Blu-ray discs I have purchased (and I own hundreds!).  I could not believe what I was viewing and hearing.  I have always loved the music but had never seen the musical and am very grateful that a friend recommended this Blu-ray to me because I am still in awe (just watched it last evening). Perfect example of why Broadway plays & musicals should be filmed for those of us that cannot get to New York to see them. A stunning production!!
B000002MIF|5|Hatful of Hollow is not a studio release by The Smiths, but it may as well be. This album is arguably just as popular and well-known as any of the four studio releases by the band and the album stands on it's own as a great album.     While many of the tracks have been released in previous forms (such as on singles and things of that nature), the tracks that appear here that don't appear on the four studio releases or Louder Than Bombs are What Difference Does It Make?, These Things Take Time, This Charming Man, Handsome Devil, Still Ill, You've Got Everything Now, Accept Yourself, Back to the Old House, and Reel Around the Fountain.    Every song on this album is pure-gold and, even if you own all the studio releases and [[ASIN:B000002LBH Louder Than Bombs]], this is an album that's definitely worth getting. The Smiths are my favorite band and before listening to this album I was already very familiar with all the tracks on here in their previous form, so many of the tracks on here don't sound quite as good as the versions I'm used to (These Things Take Time comes to mind instantly)...But many of them rival the other versions or at least are equal to them.    This album does feature \\"Handsome Devil\\" and \\"Accept Yourself,\\" the former a brilliantly cheeky song, the latter a criminally underrated Smiths classic with amazing lyrics.    While few things on here are technically \\"new,\\" this album is very much a classic example of The Smiths and if you're a fan of the band you'll find much to love here.    GRADE: A
B00FAPF5U0|5|Truth is I haven't played yet. My daughters love this game. They both talked me into getting it and said oh you are going to love it and play it all the time. So we shall see. They are usually spot on with me, so I will say I love it!

B00KCUY7CU|5|I rarely write reviews because I just don't have the time. However, I will make time to praise Sia, on this her sixth album and honestly, one of her best. I've been a fan of Sia's long before she went &#34;mainstream&#34;. She is absolutely one of the most underrated performers of my generation. Her voice is captivating, with raw emotion that is sometimes full of hope, pain, despair, love, longing and fear. The feelings that she envelopes the listener in are awe-inspiring in the sense that her music can make my heart swell, my eyes mist and my brain race with a plethora of ideas. I listened to her album a week ago on iTunes Radio and I was hooked. Afterwards, i listed to all of her albums (I own everything she has ever created and released) and compared her new album to those gems. I must say, her vocals on 1000 Forms of Fear just hit all of the right emotional notes, her lyrics conjure up events in one's own life and I must say, Sia deserves a standing ovation and a Grammy. It is rare that... Read more

B002JXK5VU|4|This is one of my favorite shows but I have had some trouble with the downloading of the show.  The last episode I watched to 3 hours to watch one episode.
B00005BCNC|4|This movie is a tour de force for Tom Hanks and has some very compelling moments.  In the beginning of the movie, he is shown as a FedEx employee who is obsessed with time schedules and spends copious amounts of time on his cell-phone and answering his beeper.  He is a slave to his job as evidenced by a Christmas Day departure for a business trip which forces him and his fiance, played by Helen Hunt, to open their gifts in the car before he leaves.  Helen Hunt is sadly underutilized in this part, by the way.  By far the best scenes in the movie occur during the circumstances which strand him on an uninhabited island and the time in which he lives on the island.  Needless to say, his priorities change drastically and he is kept going by a fading picture of his girlfriend and by accomplishments such as discovering water and creating fire.  The scenes before and after this segment are poorly written and unconvincing and if anyone but Tom Hanks was saying some of these lines, we'd never believe them.  The island scenes were well-done, but I was left with a vaguely unsatisfied feeling at the end.
B00E8KLWB4|5|Great game very addictive. I have so much fun playing it. It challenges me at every turn. I love it.
B00EEDJHXA|5|The premise of this game is so simple, yet poses great challenges. Cute sound effects, non-intrusive permissions, and the fact that you can play for just a few minutes at a time mean I simply love it!.
B000MQC9H4|4|good little movie for the romantics
B00A11AN6O|4|The cloud drive is way easy to use, it makes it a lot easier to store pictures and videos, and transferring them to one device or the other. It makes it so you don't use android or kindle fire storage.
B000VYX8PE|4|I read one of the reviews left by a critic of this book.  She complained she couldn't endorse this book because the children were not as admirable (among other things) as the children in Harry Potter.  I disagree with her.  Though I do like the Harry Potter series myself, if I had to recommend a book that I feel teaches children good values, I'd recommend this series over Harry Potter.  Harry Potter has some good values too, but all the magic and impossible things rather obscure them.<br /><br />What I like about this series is that it teaches several valuable things.  One, it teaches that life is not fair.  Two, it teaches that adults are not infallible.  They can be kind and have your best interests at heart, but sometimes they can be fooled.  This may not be something many adults want their kids to realize, but frankly--I think it is a good idea for them to learn it.  Inevitably, parents and other adult caretakers make mistakes...and if children don't realize that adults can make mistakes and have errors in judgment, they have no choice to believe that you did something on purpose.<br /><br />But the best thing about this book is that it shows the Baudelaire children managing to prevent the worst disasters and foil the bad buys with real life skills.  No, unlike Harry Potter, they can't wave their wand and get out of a situation.  They still get bounced around from one guardian to the next.  They still get pursued by the bad guy.  However, they manage to escape danger and ruin the bad guy's plans in every book.  And how do they do this?  Violet uses her ingenuity and mechanical skills to invent things out of objects around her.  Klaus, the bookworm, uses his extensive knowledge on various objects.  Even Sunny, who is a mere baby, is not a total dead weight.  She has sharp teeth, and she knows how to use them.  The greatest strength the Baudelaires have is their love for each other, and this is the one bright thing in their otherwise unfortunate life.<br /><br />This book teaches kids that even if they can't always alter their circumstances and are stuck in a situation, it doesn't mean they are helpless.  And they don't have to have magical powers either.  There are plenty of real life skills that can help them.
B007J4T2G8|5|I liked the story line and how descriptive it was. I recommend this book to anyone looking for light pleasure reading.
031606792X|4|If you are a sci fi fan you will not like this book. It wraps up too easily and everything works out for everyone. That said, if you are like me and read this series because you a romance reader , you will love this book.  I have been reading romance books for 30 years and this is why we read them. In reading all the comments you notice the common thread is they wanted more strife and did not want teenagers thinking life was this easy.  As an adult we all know that life is anything but. Thats why people read these types of books for the non reality of it. I dont really believe vampires and werewolves exist. The beauty of the book is in the love story and thats what she gave you. I have 2 teenage daughters and they would never read this and think , \\"oh life could be that perfect\\". No one in there right might would. This is a romantic fantasy it wasnt meant to be the \\"Bible\\". Give Ms. Meyer a break. I dont think it was ever her intent to become the moral compass for teenagers. If they really believe all of these tidy happy endings happen, then they are in for a shock in life.
B006BDHAX0|4|I finally decided to purchase the full game after playing the sample version for about a year.  I am a little disappointed with the full game as the different puzzles are not quite as challenging as the sample version.  But overall it is nice to have some different puzzles that I can challenge myself with to beat a previous time etc.
B00T3DNKIE|3|It was something like catching up with old friends you haven't seen in years:  good to see them, hear their voices again, and learn what they've been up to, but somewhat disconcerting to realize your idealized memories of them are not the reality of how they are and to learn some of the difficulties and disappointments they've experienced. I think the book could have used a bit of editing, for example to align the mention of the trial which was one of the main events of TKAM to fit with the outcome in the previous novel, in this one it says Atticus's client, the defendant, was acquitted. I'm glad it's been released but can understand the disappointment some people have expressed with it. I recommend that TKAM fans read it with an open mind, but I'm not sure I'd recommend it to someone who doesn't already love the characters, as if you are just meeting them they don't make such a good first impression.
0515153656|5|Every time i get a Lee Child book in my hands i wonder why this guy doesn't write a book every month! I start reading it and i know that when it's finished i'll have to wait at least for another six or eight months for the next to come!<br />You'll certainly think it's absurd, however this is the truth.<br />Child never fails you, you know what you're getting but still he manages to keep you guessing about the outcome till the last minute.<br />Awesome book, i think the best book he's ever written. And i've read them all!

B0064MGU98|5|Did not know what I had been missing.  Great show, great acting, great writers.
B00IMIJCII|4|The app is OK, but I am deducting a star because I feel the controls could have been done better or at least make them movable, and the time periods for 3 stars are too harsh.<br />What prompted me to write this review in the first place however has already been said, and I'd like to refer you to read MPG's review (sorry buddy if I got your name wrong). There are no *active* ads nor what you could reasonably call spyware in this app. People, do yourself a favour and acquaint yourself with some basic knowledge of Android, try out a few system info apps, and check out future apps yourself. There are enough charlatans around who write &#34;sensational&#34; reviews to massage their own egos, their reviews too often partial & contain inaccuracies. Learn & you will spot them.
B00835A8SS|5|This is a great episode of a great show!  If you have not seen the other episodes you will probably be lost and not know what is going on. I would recommend this action packed show to anyone who loves drama, mystery, love or suspense. In order to fully enjoy this episode you need to have watched all those that come before.
B00V4JHNZG|5|really enjoyed this movie
B0096PAA6E|5|Crazy guitar skills. Simply awesome.
B009IRVSVQ|5|Another excellent album from Bruno Mars, except that the tracks here are more upbeat, work out upbeat type. I particularly like Uptown Funk and Unorthodox Jukebox among his newest hits.

B003Y74KC0|3|This is a basic silicone case that's good for protecting against nicks and scratches on the iPhone's body. The screen is still unprotected, so if that's a concern you should pick up a screen protector too. Remember, this isn't a heavy duty case like an Otterbox -- dropping your phone on concrete will likely result in a crack even with this case on.    As a bonus, this case (like any other case) helps with the iPhone's attenuations problems (i.e. the grip of death). While the antenna problems aren't as pronounced due to Verizon's stronger network, they still happen. This case prevents that issue.    On the downside, the material picks up dust and pocket lint easily. It can be rinsed off with water easily, but you'll have to do that more often than you like.    For the price, this case offers very basic protection. Personally, I suggest either going \\"naked\\" with the phone or getting something heavy duty like an Otterbox.

B000067CPX|5|This is by far, the greatest album in the band's career. John Frusciante (guitarist) is the mastermind behind all of the incredible melodies this album has to offer. Give it a listen sometime and see how some bands actually do get better with age. I truly love this album, it is simply astonishing

0802798225|4|Fairfield, a suburb of Chicago, is really two worlds in essence. On the north-side, there are the wealthy, snobby white fold with their designed clothes, cars, and lives. On the south-side, gang life and poverty is common amongst the Latinos. These opposite sides of town don't mix, especially with their many prejudices against each other, so naturally, trouble brews when Brittany Ellis, a pretty and popular north-sider, and Alex Fuentes, a gang member from the south-side, are forced to be lab partners in their chemistry class. Yet, aside from the obvious differences, Brittany and Alex are the same, putting up a certain image to cover up the other disasters in their lives. And neither is prepared, amidst prejudices from all sides and the ever-present factor of Alex's gang involvement, for what they do find--love.    Reminiscent of the classics Romeo and Juliet and West Side Story, Perfect Chemistry is an oh-so-romantic tale of love between two opposing groups of people, but with a twist. Elkeles wonderfully portrays the surface differences between Brittany and Alex, especially family and everyday life, without making them into the stereotypical good-girl-bad-boy couple. I liked how Brittany and Alex each had their own unique identity and how they managed to overcome any prejudices they previously felt to be with each other. The attraction between these too is so intense that it's practically tangible, and readers will be rooting for them to be together. Perfect Chemistry includes a realistic view of the harshness of gang life and the danger that comes with that territory, as well as the trials and difficulties of living with family with special needs and others who may want what's best but don't necessarily know what that is. Perfect Chemistry is an unforgettable tale about forbidden romance and overcoming the odds.    Perfect Chemistry will be a hit among teens looking for a sweet and romantic story as well as fans of all variations of Romeo and Juliet, including Chasing Windmills by Catherine Ryan Hyde.

B00005Y6YB|5|This miniseries has a bit of everything - great action, beautiful scenery, romance, wonderful bonds of friendship.  It's quite a journey & very entertaining all the way through.  Robert Duvall is an amazing actor.  Gus was a great character - very funny & real.  Robert had such a gift of bringing him to life & I really enjoyed every scene he was in.  The whole cast worked great together.

B008AK8FHM|1|Proof of Heaven was interesting but written by someone who never saw Jesus Christ in Heaven.  He sets on a throne at the right hand of Our Heavenly father and guess what? Jesus was not in the book...... So I counted the book as a fairy tale.<br />Read: A Christian Rebuttal to Dr Eben Alexander's Proof of Heaven. If you want the truth...<br />So if you are looking for a good happy &#34;story&#34; read Proof of Heaven but not if you are looking for the truth.<br />A somewhat biased saint.....

B0038M2RL2|5|Hello & welcome to this & this is going to be continuing my reviews of The Karate Kid films I'm not going to review the remake as I don't have all you need to know is I enjoyed but it will never be as good as the 1st & sure ain't as good as part II. I am doing these reviews cause you have the 20th anniversary of The Next Karate Kid & I am going to do a review for my 20 years ago series. Now Karate Kid II often is put in the same group as Karate Kid III & The Next Karate Kid which I'm sorry this is a good sequel & I like it more than the 1st even & I am glad I'm not alone in that but there's people that feel part III that pos is better cause it brought the sas back or something like that. If you feel that way about Karate II that's fine but Karate Kid II for me it has this message that doesn't come off as pretentious great acting. It progresses the characters a lot better than part III did. I care about my characters you get to learn more about Miyagi. The movie was hit it made $115 million in The US I can't find the budget information the budget couldn't have been more $30 million. The movie was directed by John G Avildsen once again. Ralph Macchio & Pat Morita return but the newer cast includes Danny Kamedona as Sato, Yuji Okumoto as Chozen, Nobu McCarthy as Yukie Tamlyn Tomita as Kumiko. The story is starts right after Karate Kid you have John Kreese putting down his students mainly Johnny & grabs him starts choking him Miyagi steps in Kreese wants to fight him when Kreese goes for a punch Miyagi moves out of the way & his fist goes through windshield his knuckle is busted open. He goes for another punch but Miyagi moves out of the way his fist goes through the windshield & both knuckle's are busted open. Miyagi then uses a line on Kreese that Kreese said in the 1st movie about no mercy. Miiyagi then acts like he's going to go for a death blow but he grabs Kreese's nose & says \\"Honk!\\" Then it goes to 6 years later Daniel has found out that his Mom is getting a newjob with a company in Fresno & he will have to move with her. Miyagi allows Daniel to stay with him. Miyagi gets letter a little bit latter on to return to Okinawa that his Father is going to die. He tells Daniel why he left Okinawa he was in love with this girl named Yukie who was set up an arranged to Marry this guy named Sato who was Miyagi's Friend. Miyagi ended up announcing to the entire village that he loved Yukie. Sato then wanted to fight Miyagi in a fight to the death cause Sato had a sense of entitlement to Yukie. Daniel decides to go to Okinawa with him. When they arrive in Okinawa they're met by Chozen who turns out to Sato's Nephew right from the start he doesn't like Daniel.  They're taken to this warehouse where Sato is at he still holds a grudge against Miyagi. Basically Sato has iron fist rule over the town like he put the fishing business out cause he took over & the villagers rent their homes from him & he gets a percentage of their produce they grow. When Miyagi & Daniel get to the village Miyagi reconnects with Yukie he finds out she never Married. Daniel also takes an interest in Kumiko Yukie's Niece which I prefer Kumiko over Ali but that's just me. Sato keeps calling out Miyagi & he shows up to fight Miyagi 1 day but but Yukie stops them cause Miyagi's Father wants to see him. Sato says out of respect he will give Miyagi 3 days to mourn & then they must fight which made this villain a bit more interesting. Ralph Macchio is given a decent monologue when he tells Miyagi about when his Father died. Miyagi also tries to teach Daniel this new defense technique like he tries to block this hammer or spike which is The NES game The A V G N's review of that game was funny. Daniel helps the people in the village by uncovering how Chozen is cheating them out of there money. Chozen is humiliated he wants revenge he does a real good job coming off as a  narcissist plus it looks like that he feels like he's entitled to Kumiko. As Miyagi & Yukie have beenspending time together Daniel & Kumiko see Miyagi & Yukie have a Tea Ceremony meaning they're falling in love again. Miyagi goes off to town with Yukie to get a part for The Fridge while Daniel spends the day with Kumiko they go site seeing they go to these mountains where she shows him this Castle that was once used for The O Bon Dance the castle ruins are owned by Sato. You also have the song \\"Glory Of Love\\" by Peter Cetera. The Romance is done well not at all sappy. You have them go into town where Daniel is shown a dancing on TV Kumiko wants to be dancer but there's no schools in Okinawa you also have an appearance by BD Wong which is kind of funny considering he seems carefree in this bit role but he's a serious character on Law & Order S V U. Then they come across a Dojo that's ran by Sato Chozen is teaching a class & he makes Johnny look like a pantywuss. As well they have comes across some Service Men 1 of which is played by Clarence Gilyard they're trying to break these sheets of ice. It was kind of cool cause you had BD Wong & Clarence Gilyard in this movie cause they would be in really big Cop Shows. Anyway Chozen shows up forces Daniel into breaking 6<br /> sheets of ice Miyagi steps in but he makes Daniel do it & places a $600 on it which I liked Miyagi in this movie more than the 1st which I already thought he was a good character but I liked how he wanted Daniel to grow as a person in this movie unlike the 3rd. Chozen can't cover it but his rich Uncle Sato can. Daniel focuses & chops all 6 sheets of ice which I doubt Macchio did either way it's a movie I'm wanting to be entertained I don't want realism. Chozen says they don't honor cowards but Sato pays up & tells Chozen not to  embarrass him again. Chozen goes to The Village to get Miyagi for the fight he decides to destroys all the crops of the villager's Miyagi tries to talk some sense into Sato he is trying to chop a block of wood which is the same block of wood they found as kids. Which is beingdeep but doesn't come off as pretentious. Then at this dance which I guess Okinawa likes American Culture I don't know anyway Daniel & Kumiko are having fun until Chozen shows up with his goons they beat up Daniel Chozen takes Daniel wallet they fight back & they get out of there. Then Sato & Chozen go to Yukie's House Chozen wrecks The Dojo made by Miyagi's Ancestor's they damage property & break things. Miyagi steps in & takes out Chozen & his goons & he has Chozen where he could kill him but he doesn't Miyagi would never ever kill. Sato comes in with Bulldozer's & is going to tear down the village if Miyagi doesn't fight him Miyagi agreees to face him at Midnight. Daniel & Kumiko take part in Tea Ceremony a Typhoon hits the area & everyone seeks shelter except for Sato there's still people outside. I know people say this is over the top or unrealistic but people buy Kellen Lutz in Expendables 3 as an action star so I think this is just fine I buy into this drama hook, line & sinker. The Hut collapses that Sato is in Miyagi actually There's this girl stuck in The Bell Tower Daniel goes to save her Sato tells Chozen to help him but he doesn't cause he's a coward probably but mainly cause he feels he's entitled to everything in life & he's a narcissist he won't help Daniel for 5 minutes & help someone who had nothing to do with their problems. Sato goes outside & help guide them to the shelter. Sato pretty much is saying this hatred is over between us. Sato tells Chozen \\"Now to you I am dead!\\" The next day Sato shows up with equipment & trucks he's going to rebuild the village & the people in the village can own their houses & have deeds instead of renting for him. He asks Miyagi for forgiveness I buy it hook, line & sinker once again sue me it's not handled in a pretentious manner. Kumiko asks for The O Bon Dane to return & to be held in The Castle & Sato has no problem with returning it. Chozen crashes the party & grabs Kumiko holds her at knife point Sato tellshim don't do this but Sato tells him I am dead to you remember that. Miyagi told Chozen not to disgrace his Uncle Chozen won't listen to reason cause he's narcissist. It's up to Daniel to have the most important battle ever a lot of people say Mike Barns are you kidding me Sean Kannan from All My Children. LOL! Johnny in the 1st movie was a cool kid with a bad attitude. Chozen is a trained killer which I don't know Yuju Okumoto is a real martial artist but he looks like he know how to fight knows how whoop people. Miyagi says to Daniel \\"This not tournament this is for real!\\" This is the best fight in the series cause they look like they're striking each other for real The Crane Kick doesn't work this time Daniel is even cut open & you have all these people at The O Bon Ceremony take these hand drums they're backing Daniel he fights back with some real hard blows he has Chozen on his knees Daniel asks \\"LIVE OR DIE MAN!?\\" Chozen says die but Daniel doesn't want to be murder so he takes Daniel takes his nose & says \\"Honk!\\" Which is kind of cheesy but I don't care the point is now Daniel has learned to value human life he knows how to do a death blow if & only if it's necessary. He goes & hugs Kumiko she's alright & then you get \\"Glory Of Love\\" at the end credits. So this movie I enjoy more than the 1st I know people will think that's high praise but that's how much I love this movie. It sure blows Karate Kid III out of the water & Next Karate Kid as well. I liked how you find out more about Miyagi & the message of forgiveness & not to kill is handled well it's not pretentious you want to see a pretentious message about forgiveness go see Faster. Daniel has a better love interest they progress both Miyagi & Daniel. When Ralph Macchio & Pat Morita are on screen together they still click. Characters are likable great final fight at the end. John G Avildsen did a great job again. Ralph Macchio was great again. Pat Morita was great again. Danny Kamekona did a great job. Yuji Okumotot was great. Nobu McCarthy did a good jon. Tamlyn Tomita did a very good job. I mean if you've heard bad things about the sequels & have only seen the 1st I recommend part II it does it's own thing it progresses the characters handles the message well & has a great fight at the end. If you want to talk about a sequel to avoid though coming up is Karate Kid III oh I am going to have a fun little rant.
B002VWNIAY|5|One of my very favorite movies! I was very pleased with the quality of the dvd, and the price was great!
B0063IH60K|3|Wonderful mechanics are the lure.  It's fast, and easy...however:  between each game I had to<br />take time to tell an advertisement that I didn't want to participate in its service.  That slowed down<br />the &#34;fun&#34; of staying on to play another game.  I could probably handle the interruption once every five games.
B0034G4P94|5|Im a female college student home for the holidays and stopped by redbox to rent a movie last night to watch with my parents. This looked like the only semi-interesting one so I brought it home. I vaguely remembered seeing a glimpse of the trailer when it was in theaters but I don't remember talking to anyone who had seen it and I definitely hadn't so I had no preconceptions about it. As I was putting it in the DVD player, my mom & I were joking that thank goodness it only cost a dollar because there was no way we were going to like a movie about two guys beating each other up in a cage match. well, to sum up the movie, it was awesome. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. The character development is so good and it is nothing like I thought it'd be. I don't want to give anything away but I highly recommend it!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5|I did not expect to like this book and I absolutely loved it. The way it is written is similar to the divergent series. A must read.
B0000DJZA5|2|\\"Let it be... naked\\" is not for the casual fan, but more for the hard core Beatles fanatic.  This release was totted as a remixed back to basic \\"what it should have been the first place\\" release, but really doesn't sound that different than the \\"official\\" Phil Spector version, with few exceptions.  The most notable changes are the track order, track selection (no Maggie Mae or Dig it, but it has the added addition of Don't let me down).  Missing also are the in-between song chatter which actually makes the original album flow.  <br />The songs all sound very good and clean, but the noteworthy gems are \\"I've got a feeling\\" with great harmonies between John and Paul (I like this version better than the other album version), One after 909 which just sounds more together and cohesive, I Me Mine is now a lot more guitar driven without the overdubbed strings.  You hear the mastery of George Harrison and his superb guitar playing.  As well, \\"Don't let me down\\" is a great addition to the set list.  I'm pretty sure this is actually taken directly from the roof top concert itself.  \\"The Long and Winding Road\\", although not one of my favorite songs, also sounds quite different with out its string back drop.  The rest of the material sounds similar to the \\"Let It Be\\" album or the material of \\"Anthology 3\\".<br />I feel that it's important to note that long time Beatles producer George Martin had no input into this project.  In fact, both surviving Beatles had no input as well.  After the work was completed they were given a copy for their approval and that was it.<br />The most disappointing aspect of \\"Let It Be... naked\\" is that most Beatles fans know it could have been so much better.  This seems to be the aspect that haunts this new CD the most.  Perhaps they could have made a \\"let it be\\" box set that was more in the style of Anthology.  Along with these new reworked versions they could have had demos and alter versions of songs.  They could have included some of the vast unreleased material that was recorded during the intense month long recording period in 1969, some of which can be heard in tiny snippets on the 2nd \\"fly on the wall\\" CD.  What a tease!  Shame on them!  It's like holding a piece in front of a dog.  Who needs a fly on the wall CD anyway?  That's what the film is for!  They could have put something more meaning full of that disk!<br />Speaking of which, where's the DVD?  Where's the full roof top concert?  It seems only logical that they would coincide the release of the DVD with the album.<br />The truth of the matter is that no matter how many remixes or reworking they attempt \\"Let It Be\\" will always be the one that got away.  These sessions were undisciplined, unfocused, plagued with disagreements and unhappiness.  The whole band was out of sync with one another and no filter or setting in Pro Tools (the audio software used to do the remixing for this album) can fake or fix that.  <br />For all these reason, and many more, we'll never truly know what \\"Let It Be\\" could have been.
B00640UICA|2|This game is fun and challenging but it has deleted my game twice. I'm on the third to last area this time and for some reason it threw me back to the third area(from the beginning). Why! I started over from the beginning the first time now I think I'll just quit. Don't think I'll get any other games from this company
B00U7VDC7A|4|Fun but it takes to long to make food but overall I love this game :) Very fun I recommend for people of all ages
B00DPM7TIG|5|Love this book, in fact I am re-reading because I read it so fast the first time that I wanted to go back and make sure I didn't miss a word.  Really brought World War II history back to me.  I was born in 1938, the year the book story was started, and it was a very up close look into the Germans and French lives during the war.  I know it is a novel, but beautifully and historically relevant.  Just a wonderful read; have not read the author's other novels, but certainly will.  Of course, will have to finish my second reading first!!!  Mr. Doerr lives in Boise, as do I, and hopefully will meet him someday.
B0038NN3B4|4|I had an oooooold atkins book from my aunt and I bought this to compare. This is not as strict but the idea is the same 20 carbs a day. I always have faster weight loss on the Atkins 1972 version (25lbs). If you're serious about knocking of the pounds I'd start there then consider net carbs. I just personally don't believe knocking off carb counts using net carbs will help people, especially considering that the FDA allows companies to knock of calories and carb counts due to fiber before we total it.
B00L9B7IKE|5|It was a bit confusing at first but once it got going it was great.
B00JKGYSAI|5|great album!
B00FAXLCWW|5|LOVE THE ALBUM! It's so eccentric.
B004J4WLB4|5|it was the best book i have read in years.  if you like flowers and gardens this book is marvelous.
0761171703|5|I got my copy of dancers among us yesterday and I have to say Jordan has done his magic again. Fantastic photos, great quotes and I absolutely loved the stories behind the photos at the end! What a great book and an amazing project!
B001OQCV6K|5|this is already a great movie. so when i upgraded to the bluray format, it made it even better. if you havent made the upgrade yourself, you dont know what youre missing
B00L9B7IKE|1|It was so boring and could not keep my interest.  I read all of it waiting for something to happen.  I don't understand how it became popular.
0143127241|5|just as good as all cj box books
B00QW8TYWO|5|It is a very fun and exciting game.
B005HJU7HA|4|one of the gems of free books - hours of pleasure, waiting for my next holiday to be able to savour this
B000AWYOG4|5|this was a very good movie i would buy it any time plus it makes a great gift-the best!
140006922X|5|Excellent read if you wish to have a historical perspective on Jesus of Nazareth. Scholarly work but easy to read and retain.
0786177284|3|While the first four or five CDs are engaging and (as Feynman would say) very interesting, I found the second half somewhat tedious. His comments on physics decrease steadily throughout the book and the last half is taken up with his adventures in nightclubs and playing music in Brazil.    The voice talent is great -- he may not sound like Feynman but he reads the words like a highly intelligent 12-year-old boy, which captures Feynman perfectly.
B0055PSKE8|5|I would like to get this back  it was delete by mistake.
B001XUJNJ0|5|A few of Steven King themes are explored in this story.  One is the unjustly accused.  A man in prison for a crime he did not commit.  Another related theme is the person out of place, a character in a environment , at least on the surface, he is poorly equipped for.  Andy learns to adapt, in fits and starts, to prison life and is willing to take the long view of things.  Unexpected strengths are revealed slowly.  There are excellent characters sprinkled throughout.  This is a fine movie, one that has grown on me after several viewings.  I think it's one of Tim Robbins best performances
B0031RG846|5|So cute! My niece loves unicorns & now she has a new favorite!
B007SSDBBM|5|I love this movie.
0143119680|5|great ending to a great trilogy.
B004SD5GZ4|1|I was never able to get it to install on my Kindle and I'm not sure what is wrong. Every once in awhile there are some things that I want to watch and I can't because it says I need a flash player and then there are times I can watch some things I can watch without the notice coming up.
B008JGSM6G|5|My son downloaded this game and both my husband and I have found ourselves playing it.  It is fun and challenging. Keeps the mind sharp!
0399142851|2|After the disappointment of Hornet's Nest, I rushed out to buy UE. I enjoyed the beginning, but got more and more disappointed. Like other reviewers, I did not remember the villain.Was this a rush job? Also, PLEASE, Scarpetta, stop whining all the time! Scarpetta has changed a lot from the strong woman she was in early books - maybe she should get rid of Benton - he seems to bring out the worst in her. Please no more Italian recipes - if I want them, I will by an Italian cookery book. Still, I am most probably going to by the next Scarpetta novel, to see whether things (plots) are improving. Susanne
B0022Q8CSC|4|I have a new appreciation of Coppola.  He managed to successfully dissect this novel and pull everything great from it - putting everything on the screen necessary in moving the story forward.  All the secondary characters in the book don't significantly contribute to the story - and often distract from it.<br /><br />Having said all this, I'd still recommend the book.  An enjoyable read best enjoyed in conjunction with the movie(s).
0307719774|5|Its perfect, i look forward to writing in this journal everyday. I do not find it a problem that the book does not lay flat. Its till flexible enough that you can write in it without any problems.
B0000TB01Y|3|I expect I will, once I've played it, feel like giving the recording a 4-5 star rating, but at the moment I'm still trying to arrange the tracks in sequence, having just used the Amazon Cloud Player to download them to my computer (the physical CD is still on its way in the mail).<br /><br />For reasons I cannot imagine, the track numbers do not display in the Cloud Player, but it has clearly placed the Finale first (its title contains the word \\"Finale\\"), and plays it first when I ask it to play the album.  Since the titles alone, without track numbers, don't give me any clues, I had to search out the directory where the download landed to see if I could straighten this out.  (I could also have gone to the \\"sales\\" web page where the samples are listed in correct sequence.)<br /><br />I find that the whole album has downloaded WITH the correct track numbers on the file names, BUT EACH ONE has \\"01\\" appended in front of the actual track number; I gather the Cloud Player thus has no way to put them in order, it thinks they're all \\"01.\\"  So, you do get the download along with the physical CD, but prepare to have to deal with unpredictable Cloud Player track numbers.  With an album that has a storyline, not a good situation.
B00002Z88D|4|This CD is one of the best Metallica CDs ever.  Too bad they didn't have more old Metallica songs like Fade to Black or Ride the Lightning on there, I would have loved to see them.  Also, for One, the orchestra TOTALLY took  the dark foreboding feeling away from the song.  That feeling made the song  come alive, and the orchestra wrecked it.  However, for Enter Sandman and  Master of Puppets, the orchestra made the songs come alive!    Especially loved Battery right at the end...... that'll get your blood  moving
B00846REIS|5|Great book
0804161380|5|This is a very quality collection of these hardcover strategy guides. I already owned all of them except the Ocarina of Time 3d guide, so I don't mind not getting the other things that came with the originals. Also, I'm not sure why other reviews have complained about this, collector's editions are collector's editions for a reason. If you wanted the extras, you should buy the original version of the CE guide. The metal bookmark that comes with these guides looks beautiful though it had a couple very small blemishes on the surface of one side. Magnetic lid closes nicely. The only thing I could want more in this is if it made the sound from the games of obtaining an important item from a chest when you opened it. That would make this complete. Great product!
B00005JLEX|5|My favorite.
B001NLKXK2|5|If movie was as good then it was great
B00AX6KMGS|4|Good story. Young actors giving it their all. Concept is pretty interesting. Well done. Good entertainment. Well plotted and played.
B005OCFGTO|5|I loved the books and now am enjoying the movies for the second time!!
B0083Z614S|5|I read and read this book over and over as a kid. I was about 11 years old when I first read it. You could think of Mary Lennox as a little detective and Misselthwaite Manor as her mystery. Her cousin, Colin and her friend  Dickon help her discover what they call Magic in the garden . The final chapter seems to be Frances's motherly advice to all kids .  You will enjoy this book immensely!
B00O8OVX2S|5|Awesome
1422188612|5|Easy read and a great source of information
B004WGGQPQ|5|Fun
B007ZGO7EM|5|This is a simple calculator app for your needs. The buttons are large and easy to push with enough space in between them that you don't feel like you are pressing too many buttons at one time. Love the app.
B00008RWRH|5|Jochum and London Phil deliver the highest level of Haydn playing just like Colin Davis and Concertgebow do. I own both and tried to compare between two. <br /> <br />Jochum adds plenty of personal touches that decidedly grab your attention. You hear poignant romanticism or Beethoven-like roar in many places. Colin Davis, by comparison, lets the music flow naturally and makes it sound more balanced. In his set, you hear more of Concertgebow Orchestra than Colin Davis. I think it's the other way around in Jochum set. Concergebow's sound is more transparent and charmingly light-footed while London Phil sounds fuller and creamier without losing crispness. You get more agility and refinement from Davis set. You get more expressiveness and warmth from Jochum's. <br />Let me emphasize that all of the good qualities I attributed to either of the sets actually exist in both (they are inherently in Haydn's writing). It's just that some qualities are more apparent in one than the other. <br />As to the recording, Colin Davis set has more sparkle and vividness. It sounds more modern. Jochum's has a typical old-fashioned analogue sound in a very good way. It has plenty of natural ambience but doesn't sound muddy. <br />I recommend you buy both of these delightful and affordable sets.  I never regretted doing so :-) <br />
B00NWLIW0E|1|not worth your money
B00M856DSS|5|Other people have probably already said this, but this album speaks to my soul. I feel like Hozier has been following me around or something, his lyrics and music are so beautiful. His band is wonderful as well. The haunting quality he admires in other artists is something I enjoy as well. The characters in his songs remind me of the folktales my granja told me from his childhood in Ireland. I miss my granja very much, and he was very musical. I know he would have loved Hozier if he were alive today.
B00003CWTI|5|With the sprawling and ambitious Magnolia, writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson establishes himself as one of the most gifted film makers of his generation. Over three hours long, the movie will prove too much for some viewers, but I found this look at a day in the lives of some San Fernando Valley residents to be fascinating. Some of the characters' lives are interconnected to other characters, while others are connected in only coincidental ways. The movie spends a lot of time dealing with the differences between coincidence and fate. <br />Jim [John C. Reilly] is a cop who earnestly tries to do good. He is desperate to be loved, and when he meets Rose Gator [Melinda Dillon] during a domestic disturbance call, he is seemingly oblivious to her problems, which include drug addiction and a lot of mental conflicts. Rose hates her father Jimmy [Philip Baker Hall] with a passion bordering on the homicidal. Jimmy is the host of the longest running game show in TV history. He has recently been told he has two months to live and is trying to right some of the wrongs he has done to his wife and daughter. The show is called What Do Kids Know? and it pits three kids against three adults. The current child contestants are close to setting a money record, led by Stanley [Jeremy Blackman], an eleven year old who is miserable because he knows he is nothing but a freak to the audience and a meal ticket to his father. Across town, Donnie [William H. Macy], who was a champ on the show thirty years ago, is trying to make some sense of his life, which has gone downhill ever since his short experience with fame. The show's producer, Earl Partridge [Jason Robards], is also dying in his luxurious home, tended to by a wonderfully altruistic nurse, Phil [Philip Seymour Hoffman], who will do anything to grant the man's dying wish, which is to see his estranged son, Frank [Tom Cruise]. Frank long ago changed his name and has become wealthy by creating a very odd self-help program, which claims to give men control over women...  <br />Magnolia was passed over at the Oscars this year, though there are a number of award winning performances. Of particular note are those of Julianne Moore and Tom Cruise. I never thought I'd be saying this, by Cruise really should have won Best Supporting Actor.<br />Much has been made of the movie's startling and unconventional ending. I thought it was perfect, though many people disagree. I will note that there are clues all though the film that tell you that the event depicted will probably occur.
B00DJFIMW6|5|Fun game for all ages. Guaranteed to put a smile on your face everytime you play it. Enjoy the crashes almost as much as the game itself. Five stars all the way.
B009LDD54K|5|keeps you wanting more. well filmed and written with alot of twists. Some what acts as a history lesson in some cases, someone did thier homework

0061537969|5|There are so many reviews on this book, it almost seems I don't need to write one, but I loved it so much, I wanted to write my own review anyway.  I am a cat person and I hate car racing, but my sister introduced me to this book, showing me all the consistent high reviews, so I had to check it out. I am so glad I did. It is such an amazing book, when I found myself crying in the first chapter, I knew I was in for a good read!  The dog, telling the story, is more of a human then many people I have met, and I love that the author chose to tell a story through his eyes. It is a book that is one I will read over again. After racing through it the first time, wanting to see where life was leading this family, I feel like I should read it again, and savor the wonderful writing by Mr. Stein. Great book, great story, beautiful words.
B00QROI70S|5|Very fun and entertaining film. Sound track is wonderful!
B00IU0M85C|5|Fantastic show with blow your mind acting by Tatiana!
B00I8Q77Y0|5|so cool and so addictive and awesome I want all Colors though Wich I will get for these last fewwords wich is pretty cool
B00000F3TS|5|I must write a little on this most wonderful movie.  I saw this movie a few years ago for the first time and fell in love with the charaters who were all so memorable.  The underground treasure hunt through all manner of booby traps while been chased by a few low grade criminals was one of the best cinematic moments of my life.  Finding treasure is every kids and grownups dream and this film just catapulted all of that excitement into this action packed film. BUY IT! BUY IT! BUY IT! TRUST ME IT IS MORE THAN WORTH THE MONEY SPENT BECAUSE MANY OF THE FILMS YOU BUY FOR $20+ YOU CAN'T WATCH TEN TIMES RUNNING, I CAN'T GET TIRED YET.
1426308469|5|Fantastic book! I've ordered countless books and products off if Amazon, but never felt compelled to write a review until now. This book is perfect for my 4-year old. He got the book for his birthday. Tons of dinos are covered. The  pronunciations are helpful for me, the illustrations are engaging and each page has enough facts that we can read it  and have fun again and again and learn something new each time. The indexes mean the book will grow with him. I would order it again and recommend it to parents of dino lovers.
B0064W65SO|5|Frank Miller's retelling of the Batman origin instantly seats itself In your mind as THE origin. Essential reading for any Batman fan.
B00AZ7V0W0|5|Great actor/ movie
B00A9V2JSG|4|What a great series! Would highly recommend if you are a fan of Hunger Games or Divergent. The price makes these books a great value!
1604680547|5|I had been trying to design quilting motifs for my quilting projects.  When I found this book, I knew it would be perfect for use and inspiration!
B003L77GG0|5|Great my daughter is a fan and she loved it
6304711875|5|How i love this film, and the many films which it spawned. ( Scream2, Scream3, I Know What You Did Last Summer, and I Still Know What You Did Last Summer. plus others) This film is better than Screams2/3, and even they were pretty dang good!<br />This film has a cracker of a plot and a great cast. (Although i don't really know what all the fuss is about about Neve Campbell. She's not half as attractive as Jennifer Love-Hewitt) It is full of mystery, excitement, and, screams. <br />I love it. I love this genre. It may not be your high-class film full of social commentary and important messages hidden within the plot (although i'm sure some people would indeed argue that it is. and they would find no real argument here) but nonetheless it is an excellent film. I have never had such fun watching a film. When i go to the cinema, or rent/buy a video from the store, i am looking primarily for enjoyment. A film which will entertain me and keep me riveted and excited. As such, this film is fits the mold perfectly. There is little doubt that films such as this are just fun fun fun all the way. You just sit back, let it all wash over you, and enjoy the enthralling ride every twist of the way. <br />as well as being a hugely entertaing film, it is one which pays some kind of homage to all films in this genre which have gone before. At the same time, it lightly makes fun of itself, and is full of irony. It is just so enjoyable. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and is completely unpretentious (i HATE pretentious movies) <br />I can't get over how fun and enjoyable this movie is (you can probably tell, as i can't stop telling you) anyway, just rest assured that if you see this movie, cast aside all expectations of a clever and serious movie, and just enjoy!<br />The acting is great (especially Courtney Cox's sterling performance), and the plot is a stunner. It moves along at such a fast pace that you hardly have enough time to stop and think. It's chilling, creepy, disturbing, and fun, all at the same time!<br />And the ending, what a one! A perfect climax. Tense, shocking, full of twists. I could watch it again and again. The last frame is great as well. it caps the movie off perfectly. ANd im not evne going to start on the brilliant theme music at the credits.
B003TJR2HS|5|I bought this adapter because I have the Ipod Classic 160 GB and I couldn't dock it to my older Magnavox Stereo w/Ipod docking station.With this adapter I can finally dock to it and play or charge through it.
0316777722|5|This latest book by David Sedaris is a scream. One of the wittiest &amp; humorous writers of our time. A must read.
B00H71PBQ8|5|Great show!!
B0069G5Z9K|4|This game is a little hard to manuever for me but my 4 year old loves it. So does my 9 year old.
B002QRWJA4|5|Best performance by Gerard Butler I have ever seen... he should stay with this kind of film instead of the stupid movies he stars in such as The Ugly  Truth or The Bounty Hunter..he is fabulous in this movie .shows his talent
B00B1LN8WY|5|We have been waiting to the complete series of &#34;Friends&#34; to be at such a great price!
B00F87ZUYG|4|It was a roller coaster. Like wow, it sux that Lizzie had to die, but I kind of wish something happened before she killed her sister, although Carol knew Myka was like sophia and we all know what happened there.  Honestly I don't know what to feel, like I said this was a roller coaster of an episode, but worth watching.
B001C08RHA|5|I loved this movie. I found the movie funny with great special effects, and most of all I found it very refreshing to see a movie tastefully done without all the profanity that you see nowdays in movies.
B00IHMEAYA|2|I tried to read this, but it was like reading Shakespeare, trying to figure out where and what was happening.  I am an avid reader, but this was written in an unclear and sometime boring way.  I lost interest and found it not worth my difficulty trying to put 2 & 2 together.  I gave up after about 1/3 the way through.  I am always interested in reading historical fiction but this was not a typical read.
B003ZXNCPE|5|many people have played this hattrick and chose this film as not succeeding  to not deliver the goods well in pa,s introspection his vision had to meet certain standards before a script could even be approved yet it didn,t sombody,s standard well to that i only say bunk put out the backing then change it to suit you but i,m betting you really had other preconcieved notions beforehand whatever watch it a  secnd time otherwise don,t plan on any popularity contests as so many others did like it
B000EWBKM6|5|This completes my collection. I have been a fan of Will & Grace for a long time I am glad to get it at a great price.
B002VPE1WK|4|If you want to carry several lenses then only useful. i just bought 1 lens initially but now became fan of camera so planning to buy more lenses. I need not worry because i have this bag already ready.
B00FPGSPQU|4|gotta love the wolf pack, they will always deliver a laugh, sides with the government shutdown what else are you gonna do watch them screw us even more in the news....gogo chow defy the odds
B00FAX6XQC|3|I got an upgrade that had to be shipped it came and I pressed equip it and it did nothing and the equip it sign is still there even after I pushed it and it wont let me press any other button so I cant play game anymore. Any suggestions?
B008IJT0CE|5|I enjoy the voices option. I hope that they create more options like it. There are too many whale options though.
B0001MDP3G|5|man this movie is a breathtaking love story. it's for sure to be a classic. greatly written, and portrayed. the acting was excellent. i'm sure everyone was touched at one point or another with the story behind this film. it has war, hard times, and a love so deep it surpasses everything and anything. this is greatness. jude law, not much of a big fan, but the man did it for me in this one. no complaints. he was very good. believable, a prince charming. he fought with one thing in mind, his beautiful ada. he must do all that he can to get back to her, it's his will to love, that helps him live. and nicole kidman, love her, great actress. she really brought it here. a women in love, writing, hoping, and dreaming for her inman to return to her. hope is never lost, and her love is never gone. she goes from a woman of high society, to a woman who must do all she can to survive the long winter months. extrodinary performance, and the capacity to keep hope alive through all is great. as for renee zellweger, she was so good in this movie. i loved it. she's a loud mouth, off her rocker tomboy. a thumbs up for her collaboration in this film. she brought the sass, and the \\"i don't take no bull from nobody\\" attitude. just right for this film. this has it all. action, drama, love, and survival. when finally they do reunite, there is so much love and passion, you can't help but be happy for them both, finally they become one. although it was sad what happened to inman, it was sadder to see all he and she went through to be together, for the outcome to be this way, but i'm sure they would have preferred that one night together, than a lifetime without each other. and with their daughter it's proof that love conquers all.
B007J4T2G8|5|This book is amazing a piece of art itself the forbidden love the the air between them it brought tears to my eyes at the end!
B0017JKEL8|5|Do yourself a favor and catch an episode of this show (or just buy the discs on faith).  It's the best, smartest, most compelling character drama I have seen on TV in a long time.  The period setting puts a clever twist on what would be a compelling show even if set in the modern day.  HBO must be killing themselves for passing on this show.  Don't make the same mistake!
B0071MDA2U|5|Just as Lena is dealing with the loss of her beloved Alex she makes a new life in the wilds. Soon she meets someone else who she begins to love.
B003U53GK8|5|The final season of Lost was riveting! Superb acting and writing. The ending was just amazing. This series is a MUST SEE!
B0051QIGP4|5|Haven't listened to the album yet... I honestly don't care much about Lady Gaga's music.<br /><br />I bought the album to show support for reasonable digital file pricing.  Thanks Gaga, thanks Amazon, for making a statement on downloads, music prices, and the New Music Industry.  I wholeheartedly support this statement.<br /><br />I noticed that downloads were going slowly... and I did have to hit the \\"restart downloads\\" button to get all my files.<br /><br />So what?  How easy, how affordable this is.  Even with the download issues, I couldn't have driven to a store and back to buy the album before it got here... and I could start playing some songs within a couple minutes.<br /><br />Seriously, one-star reviews because they priced something so reasonably and made it so convenient that demand is out-stripping technology?<br /><br />Congratulations and thanks again to Lady Gaga and Amazon Music... from a devoted iTunes guy who doesn't listen to Lady Gaga.
B00D7Z4GQY|4|This book made me rethink a lot of things.  I really enjoyed reading it.  I recommend it to anyone. Enjoy!
B004UFEJW6|4|I would have given this movie a 5 ratings, but the first few chapters were too graphic with so much unnecessary excessive violence. Too gross to see. However, after the first few chapters the movie is outstanding. Kurt Russell didn't speak much, but his body movements, eyes - everything he did was truly awe inspiring.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5|Even those of us who have studied theology have something to learn from this book, which firmly places Jesus in his context and makes a pretty impressive argument for a less theological and more immediate and practical meaning of the Kingdom of God.
B002BX4VEK|5|Found the package ...
B0054JZC6E|5|I like this game because there are so many games.<br />And plus there are more GAMES!!!!!<br />allmost the funest game.
B007MNV5WU|5|I love this game!  It's just like the original, except how you have to account for gravity near objects, no gravity in space, multiple gravity fields, and even water on the 'planets'.  Great twist on the original!
B0053YGYO4|5|I really like Coldplay's music and they didn't disappoint with this album.  I love all the songs and the feel they have to them.
0765325950|1|I've been waiting years for the end and even purchased \\"By Grace and Banners Fallen: Prologue to A Memory of Light Jordan, Robert, Sanderson, Brandon\\" on October 6, 2012.  I was ecstatic that it was available on my Kindle and presumed the final version would also be made available on Kindle.  I was disappointed, sad, and felt like I was a victim of bait-n-switch. At the least the Prologue should have mentioned the final version was not going to be available in the same format!  I will NEVER buy another book by Brandon Sanderson.  I will however purchase this one if the Kindle version is made available, if not I will not purchase the paper version.  I'm sorry my review of this product is based on media rather than content, your choice publishers not mine.
B0092C2X7U|2|first you need to master the backflip then you need to master the nearly impossible location! way too hard at least add more lives otherwise its nearly impossible to beat.
B0039TD7PY|5|Best CD ever!!
B00BWBHIUG|5|this game is so cute ! and it downloads very fast. and I love the graphics, they are so real and beautiful.<br />I recommend this game for anyone who loves fish.
B001VEE5KK|3|While this movie had an interesting story line and relationships, it contained more graphic nudity than we had expected.  It would could have still been a good film without the graphic sex scenes.
B00371QQ2U|5|Having lived through the actual news report, it is still amazing that this insident did not kill the Moon Program. A must watch for anyone interested in what it took for the 'Right Stuff '.
B00KQFP5GS|1|sucks
0439023513|5|This was my second purchase and I can't say how great the experience was.  Not only did I get a fantastic book that was in perfect condition but had really great service.  Thank you for a great experience
B0017SWSCW|4|Reminded me of the count of montecristo...<br /><br />A good read
B00B7Y0206|5|This app is really good it runs smoothly
B000H305U0|5|This CD had to grow on me... don't get me wrong. I'm a huge Justin Fan!... <br />This Album is gutsy and different but, really HOT! I recommend it, highly
B0017M413M|5|Another excellent Stargate movie.
B005ETA5K2|5|Easy of installation, use and just beginning to operate it over here in afghanistan so hopefully it was worth the effort in its daily use over here.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5|I've been watching stampy long nose playing terraria for so long FANILLY it was free during christmas I got it I was so happy and addicting and awsome now im top 5 percent yay then a update started it was so cool graphics changed new biomes New enemies so cool then it started to crash I was so furrouiss and mad and the background started to glitch :( it's still playable at least still they haven't given amozon the new updates :( Why I could be even better than minecraft my friends had this problems I suggest play it on XBOX. still is a good plz update get rid of crashing add chat and multiplayer:) wicked rat over and out.
B000FC12L4|4|A satisfying read. Note that the story continues in the third book, Abhorsen, unlike the first book in the series Sabriel which is a stand-alone story. Nix is a great writer, and the main characters are interesting, sympathetic, and relate-able.
B00CATSONE|5|I thought this book was extremely interesting.  I only wonder how the world would be if it would have allowed Tesla to fulfill his dreams.  Great read.
B006LSZECO|3|I did not like the way the book ended. It left a person hanging and wondering. The story had a lot of twists and turns in it which was interesting.
B000001EAQ|4|Pop. The album the band and most of their fans have summarily disimissed.  What a shame.  Many of the tracks on this album are among the most interesting the band has ever produced.  In fact, it isn't until the latter half of the album that it starts to unravel a bit.  A couple of substitute tracks could've saved this album.    Had they just gotten rid of \\"miami,\\" and \\"playboy mansion\\" and substituted \\"hold me, thrill me, kiss me, kill me\\" and the b-side cover of \\"happiness is a warm gun,\\" this album may have been received very differently.  Admittedly \\"miami\\" and \\"playboy mansion\\" suck.  Then again there are missteps here and there on every U2 album, even on the so-called Classic albums.  On achtung baby there's \\"who's gonna ride your wild horses,\\" that song sucks, but no one dismisses achtung baby because of it.  So it should be with Pop.   \\"Discotheque\\" is a pulse-pounding, rocket-flying, let-loose track, in the style of \\"the fly,\\" \\"lemon\\" and \\"vertigo.\\" \\"Mofo,\\" \\"do you feel loved,\\" \\"If god will send his angels,\\" \\"staring at the sun,\\" \\"last night on earth,\\" and especially the live ROCKER \\"gone\\" are seven straight stand-out tracks. \\"velvet dress\\" is probably the only truly substantial track of the latter part of the album, but that's ok with me.  U2 have to screw around sonically to get where they're going next.  Without those missteps maybe the need to create an album like \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind,\\" never would have happened, and that album was CRITICAL to the band's survival.  So at least 8/12 tracks here are outstanding.  I usually buy an album as long as I like at least 5 tracks, so 8 is a definite must-buy.  Forget the nay-sayers, and pick up one of U2's most interesting works.
B006LSZECO|5|Amazing book!
B00ACP3OOM|5|Super long battery life!<br />Use it 5 days a week and will last over a month. Very easy to use. Helps on those long swims
B00910Y1OQ|5|it is just like the online version...i love it there &amp; the app did not disappoint!  give it a try.
B003EI2EH2|5|Following this diet has been good for me. I'm not hungry and it's easy to follow in most situations. The buit in cheat day is a gem!
B001AQMBJQ|5|This was my first LOST on blu-ray (I have the DVD sets) and I noticed the superior quality of the blu-ray to the DVD immediately.  Lots of extra features - many interactive.  A must for all LOST fans who want to re-watch.  The 1080p HD is amazing and so necessary for a show where fans look for such things as tiny weeny dots on the screen.
B002WY65UQ|5|Colin Firth is in this that's why I bought it and that's why he get the 4 stars, the story only get 1.
B000QRIGLC|5|A must read book. Totally amazed at training and fortitude of the Seals. Got very teary toward the end with the events at the family ranch
1451695195|5|Absolutely star studded captivating writing.<br /><br />I have reccommended this book to nearly everyone I know.  Even to people i didn't know.
B001DJLCPE|5|A classic every movie lover should see at LEAST once!
B008Y720JU|5|Excellent movie!
B00AFEX83C|5|Another Disney favorite!  We have enjoyed this movie in our home and even though we are empty nesters, we like to keep it around for the grandkids or just us when we are in the mood for a fun movie that makes us laugh!  It's also a sweet story that makes you remember friendship and caring.
B00JA9JE0Y|5|A heartwarming and heartbreaking story of what many of us face ascour parents age.
B005544V6A|5|Characters are witty, stories are interesting, and Harvy is awesome. Occasional swears if that bothers you. Definitely recommend. A series you can get hooked on.
0684874350|5|I started out reading Angela's Ashes this summer for my Senior Advanced Placement english class next year.  At first, I only had the intent of reading this book because it was assigned, but I ended up wanting to read it and I absolutely loved this book!  Frank McCourt tells the story of his &quot;miserable Irish Catholic childhood&quot; with humor, love, and forgiveness.  It is a story that won't be forgotten.  I loved this book and I strongly recommend it to anybody!
B002AT4K9G|5|I thought this was a great movie!! I liked this one better than the previous 3. Highly recommend this to watch. Paul Walker and Vin Diesel are great together. Lots of action and drama A++++++
B000RG1FMO|3|I completely agree with S. Gross \\"Chi-Town Southside's\\" review. I'm from Chicago & support everything from Chicago but the first 2 Kanye albums are much better. \\"Graduation\\" is still a good listen but not what I was expecting.
B00005LC1H|5|This item met my expectations. I love British comedy and want good quality so that it'll last for many years of enjoyment.
B003L77FYS|5|Great show, great chemistry between the cast. The main characters are all very likable. This season ends in a great cliffhanger way that really makes you want the 4th season right now...lucky for us, it is here now
B0079J28NC|5|This digitally-remastered version of the original movie is a treat for Beatles fans. Clear graphics and great sound. Took me back to the day it came out in theaters. Must have for die-hard fans and their kids alike.
B00ARAO0WM|5|Very different, quite a bit of tension with very minimal gunplay.  Some great bike stunts and interesting camera work.  I liked it a lot!
B00FATEJYE|5|The best game ever I had so much fun but kind of hard when you'd get to the hard levels but really fun play it every day
B00HXYKYIE|3|Did not enjoy book, not up to author's usual standards.
B002HK9IDQ|5|New, unopened dvd
0307744434|5|A wonderful tale a magicians and circus, family and a family of friends. Beautiful in its imagery and un put downable.
B009O2XY12|1|I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. Once again, where I aim and where the ball ends up are world apart. I don't like it.
B00785P2QC|5|Passes the time away. There was a Facebook game I played just like this, I like this one better because it's not based on how many friends you have that can help you. You can still progress without annoying your friends to play your game
B002CIY8EM|5|Very good read.  A friend recently suggested that I read this book and I was shocked at how good a read it was.  I half expected to be reading it as a piece of comedic fiction, but found myself agreeing with the majority of the questions Von Daniken poses.  While I don't believe in the theory, I love the idea that he challenges traditional thinking and provides options that are outside the norms.  If you have an open mind, give this a read.  You won't regret it!
B00IKZX1ZI|1|I am a huge frozen fan but the only thing is it is terrible graffics and just like candy crush and I don't like candy crush.Iwish they had other frozen games out there because this one isn't for me . Disney has become a big money hog they make you pay for the cool power ups too.I wish they were better than this.
B00I3H61AA|5|Love the soundtrack to this strange and weirdly beautiful movie. Tilda I'm in love with you.
B000069CIM|5|The music is rich in sound and makes you want to wear headphones at night with no distractions. I recently started playing all my older Plant CDs and then found this one at the store and was BLOWN AWAY. Yes it's mainly cover songs but the production values are well worth the listen, and he does justice to Dylan's One More Cup of Coffee from the Desire album (my fave Dylan album). Morning Dew is a sad but beautifully done song, and Plant's interpretation of Hey Joe is quite different from the one we're used to ala Hendrix but if listened to on its own merits it is still very good, relying more on Plant's voice to build it up with the music mainly keeping the beat and rhythm until the lengthy bridge section then it goes very Led Zeppelin. All in all an excellent CD well worth taking time away from everyone and dusting off that big old set of headphones you may have laying around somewhere.
B002BCNK1Q|5|Awesome one liners and a great story line. Clint Eastwood really builds a character that will be remembered after the credits are over.
B00E5Q1HJS|5|I like the cast and the whole movie.  The cast fit their roles very well and don't destroy the movies and cast that came before, yet they add their own spice to the characters they play in the storyline.
B004ZN9W5M|5|I have purchases the Wall in all its formats...sounds like the vinyl version but<br />better.......this is amazing.  Packaging is excellent...definitely worth it.
B000NU2CY4|4|EDIT: Paramount has released a new version of this disc with improved video quality.  I am upping my star rating but leave the original review below for historical reference.<br /><br />Just a note for those reading reviews for the Gladiator Blu-ray release.  Amazon's system mixes in all the reviews for previous Gladiator DVD releases, so there are numerous 4 and 5 star ratings showing for this product, but nearly all of those are for old releases on DVD from the past 9 years, which is why there are so many of them.<br /><br />If you want information on this release on Blu-ray, you'll have to read the 1 and 2 star section, which will give you information on this embarrassingly flawed release, which has so much digital processing on an old master from the days of the first DVD release in 2000 that it looks like an upscaled DVD.  And worse, they used dust and scratch removal on that old master that removed visible objects like arrows and spears from the image.  Don't vote for this poor quality product with your dollars: wait until the fix it or announce a replacement plan.
B00NWLIW0E|5|I've waited a long time to play this on Xbox one but the ios came out so I decided to download this and it's is FUN
B0002F6BRE|5|Item as described.  Love the Elf movie!
B00BX8653O|5|Beautiful artist, great album, I think is one of my favourite from Arnalds so far! I hope I will be able to go to a concert soon to listen to him live!
B0000DD7LB|1|i didn't buy her new cd but i've listened to it online because i don't want to waste money on a good for nothing cd. I really don't know what she is trying to express in her music. I really think it's ridiculous on how she got so big. Wow she got big on her first album because someone wrote her songs big deal. Now she has something to do with it now oh please. You know who's great and talented? people like Alicia keys. She has such a god given voice to match the talent that goes with the gift of playing the piano. Everytime I listen to Alicia keys' lyrics, I feel like she knows what i'm going through. So what if she ain't got no music to dance and jam to. At least she ain't fake. Britney is just another marketing idea for dumb teenage girls to be just like her. Besides what kind of girl sends her private jet miles and miles away for a stupid cup of coffee. She should really invested on more singing lessons, more acting lessons, and maybe some education. Hey maybe then she'll come up with good lyrics. Hey I've taken the time to listen to britney now brit fans gotta listen to alicia's lastest album.
B0010SKSTO|5|Insightful with good illustrations.  Learned a lot about paying attention to the many ways we communicate our true thoughts and feelings.  Highly recommend it.
B00BFUUMO8|3|Big fan of JPB, BUT...Wow, such high hopes and so disappointed.  Battle arena on kindle fire keeps freezing up and must be re started but then I can't use the dinos I was using during the freeze up unless I pay bucks to unlock them.  This happens about half the time I try to battle them.
1400032717|5|This has become one of my favourite books. I think the book is very well written and has an engaging plot. loved how the chapters only went by prime numbers! (:
B005HEFB6M|5|Best series ever. Wish this crew would make a film or two.
B00IFOKUB2|5|i watch these seasons over and over and over again. as well as the movie . I wish it would come back on.
B007FEFLTO|5|Could not put this down.
B00013RC8O|5|THANKS
B00000ADG2|5|Lauryn Hill speaks to, for, and of the people in her intense pattern of  lyrical resonance.  The truth of her words devour you, the intense beats  hypnotize you, and the message changes your perspective--or gives you  perspective if you'd lacked it before witnessing the harmonic therapy of  Lauryn Hill.  &quot;To Zion&quot; sounds like an African chant praising the  birth of a savior.  Hill defines birth and the feeling of motherhood as no  one else has.  The imagery of the lyrics leave me believing in the strength  of Mary and the life of her son, in the possibility of heaven, God,  liberation, love, and spirits.  Thank you Ms.Hill for reintroducing reality  to a society lost in the quest for &quot;Benjamins.&quot;
B000FL7CAK|5|The package arrived within the expected time span, and the product is of good quality.
B00DPM7TIG|4|I love stories that are set in WWII....This story was good..the characters were interesting...I got confused sometimes because it went back and forth from presenting day, to the passport and back again..but all in all a good read!!
B001GCUO5M|4|Relax. This review won't give away the ending which comes as somewhat of a surprise, although many will admit to guessing the overall situation pretty early on.<br /><br />If you like your mysteries drenched in atmospheric surroundings, look no further than SHUTTER ISLAND. Director Martin Scorsese starts out with murky skies and a foreboding of doom as two men (a sheriff and his partner) approach a rocky coastline on a ferry as an ominous looking island looms into view. The plot, although keeping the viewer in a sea of confusion as it unravels, only becomes clear toward the last thirty minutes--but until then, the less you know about the outcome, the more you will enjoy the satisfying ending.<br /><br />None of the exposition is direct. Instead, we see the story from the viewpoint of a man (LEONARDO DiCAPRIO) who is obviously very troubled about tragic incidents in his past and who only gradually begins to see things in a different light. His journey is compelling right from the start, thanks to the marvelous performances of DiCaprio and MARK RUFFALO who begin their investigation into happenings at the island housing the mentally insane--some of them very dangerous cases.<br /><br />Director Martin Scorsese has the benefit of an excellent cinematographer, ROBERT RICHARDSON, whose camera work makes every frame of the film captivating. All of the exterior scenes along the rocky coastline of Maine have a sinister look. The story is told in a leisurely way but there is always an air of mystery in the relationships between the main characters, including BEN KINGSLEY as the psychiatrist in charge of the institution and MAX VON SYDOW as a suspicious looking German doctor.<br /><br />It's best not to dwell on the final outcome--but let's just say it probably won't come as a complete surprise to everyone. Nevertheless, it's the sort of thinking man's psychological thriller that any mystery fan should be able to savor.
B002XLBC60|4|Good purchase, a lot of material on the dvd ! And the cd's are good as well The box could be better, it just has a few pictures...
B00B9RIAMI|5|I bought this album after a friend suggested it. I love doing homework to it as it puts a slight sense of urgency in my head.
0679847367|5|I have two of these, one for my five year old and one for my one year old. Every year their teacher/babysitter writes a little note and this will be their high school graduation present. So since it must stay in good condition for that long, I am very glad for the hard case the book is in.
B00000HYTW|5|Does ANYBODY HAVE THIS CD! Tell US THE EXTRA TRAX!!! PLEASEE
B00FRVH3V6|5|I have loved the hero's of of olympus series and this is a wonderful conclusion to the series. It only took me a few days to read!
0312330537|5|If there is one book to read in your life then this is it! Absolutely fantastic journey, the story has so much depth and character, I have never felt emotional attachment to a character before but in this you really get involved with several of the players. Such a great story and well written in such a fashion that readers of most ability will absorb it.<br /><br />Classic story.
B007IXWKUK|5|I loved this book, but Fifty Shades Freed is the best :D Can't wait to re-read that one as well!
B00003CXZ4|5|&quot;Memento&quot; is an absolute masterpiece of modern film. Christopher Nolan does a perfect job of capturing the emotion and despair of Leonard Shelby. See, the plot goes something like ths:<br />Shelby is happily married when someone breaks into his house and kills/rapes his wife, while in the process smashing his head against a mirror, damaging his brain and causing him to lose all short-term memory. Shelby then goes on a manhunt to avenge his wife's death. This is made much more difficult by the lack of police cooperation and his condition, which forces him to write himself endless notes, and, for the really important stuff, get tatoos made so he'll never forget.<br />This premise alone would be entertaining enough, but Nolan decided to do something a little different: He tells the story all backwards and out-of-order. At first this is quite confusing, as the viewer is forced to see things the way Leonard does - in 10-minute sections that reveal the developing plot, intercut with shorter sections that show scenes from Leonard's past. This is crucial to the meaning of the film.<br />So Leonard finds some assistance in Teddy (Joe Pantaliano - &quot;The Matrix) and Natalie (Carrie Anne-Moss &quot;The Matrix&quot;). The problem is, Leonard can never be sure if these &quot;friends&quot; are genuinely trying to help him, or taking advantage of him and his condition.<br />I can't really go into any more detail without giving away certain plot elements. Just do yourself a favor and rent, buy, borrow, steal, or bootleg this movie. &quot;Memento&quot; is one of the most exciting thrillers to come out in a loooong time, and will stand as a milestone in filmmaking for this century, and the next.
B00H71PHS0|5|The characters are living at a different moment in time, but their human nature connects them to the present day.  Humor, tragedy happen side-by-side.  I find the series brilliant!
B00VRYCGLO|4|Fun and challenging
B002BGFUPQ|4|Was kind of bad paul & diesel werent n ds one but i liked it after a few times. .now i like it alot!
B0035LMTZA|5|This is one of my favorite movies! Action, mini's, and a decent story... You can't go wrong! I even suggest it for parties.
B004EPYZPS|4|I keep seeing this compared to Goonies & ET. It's got it's similarities but it differs radically, and these differences may mean that it's not a good movie choice for kids. I'll explain below, plus here's the pros and cons of this movie:<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1. The acting is phenomenal. The kids are just amazing. Each of them was absolutely believable and brought depth to their characters. I could totally relate to several of the kids. The adults were good as well, but they really weren't featured and developed enough to make a huge difference.<br /><br />2. The production value was amazing. What else would you expect from a Speilberg movie! The action sequences were riveting.<br /><br />3. The 1979 setting was very authentic and fun. Since I was around in that time period, it was great to see.<br /><br />4. The relationships between the kids were so well developed, and the main kids individual characters were beautifully written for and developed. This was what made the movie worthwhile.<br /><br />5. As in Goonies and ET, the kids are the heroes in this movie. They're the ones who know the truth and act on it for good. They're pure of heart, resourceful, determined and put themselves at risk to act like heroes.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1. This had a horror movie feel. There was plenty of violence, and it was scary. This movie is not for young kids. Those who don't like horror should avoid this movie. Granted most of it wasn't explicitly gory, but there was some blood and plenty of people died violently. There are many moments designed to shock, startle and scare you. Though it's rated PG-13, I'd say it feels closer to an R rating to me.<br /><br />2. If you're looking for a feel good alien like in ET, it's not here. The audience is not given much of a chance to emotionally connect with the alien. It's ugly, scary, violent and mysterious. I don't want to give anything away, but this is not a feel good, cuddle the alien, cute movie similar to ET. You may still enjoy this flick, but go in with the right expectations.<br /><br />3. There are tons of holes in the movie. There are many questions that are never answered, and a couple featured characters that are never fully explained. I don't always mind holes in movie lines if the movie is entertaining, but in this movie it was hard to ignore.<br /><br />4. The story line just wasn't that original. Take a bunch of different movies, put them in a jug and shake them together and you get this movie. I don't always mind a repeated story line if it's entertaining or moving, but this was just okay for me.<br /><br />So I'd say that if you like horror, this movie may be for you, though you may be disappointed with the lack of explicit gore. If you like scifi, this movie may be somewhat satisfying, but it probably won't be in your top 20. If you like coming of age movies, you'll love the story lines around the kids. If you love special effects, there are some good ones here. This movie is definitely not for young kids or for anyone who shouldn't be viewing horror.<br /><br />I'd say this is a video to rent on DVD. Then if you love it, buy it..        3.

B001ECQ6E2|4|This movie is about early Christians and how they were persecuted by the Roman authorities.  It features<br />Peter Ustinov as the emperor Nero.  This was his first movie roll and it made him a star.

B005MYWZKM|5|Great Album!
B00AEBB8BU|5|3 Days of the Condor Blu ray: Let me start by saying that the Blu ray picture and sound quality is fantastic. I normally worry about Blu ray movies from 1970s and 80s as my experience tells me that sometimes production companies simply copy the standard DVD onto a Blu ray disc which results in poor picture quality (ok, so the pixels are 1290 to 1080 but this doesn't necessarily mean great picture quality). I was very pleased with 3 Days of the Condor picture and sound quality.<br /><br />The movie: I remember seeing this long time ago in my 20s but I was surprised to notice how similar the plot is to Bourne Identity. I am not kidding, this movie and Bourne Identity could have been put together in a double-feature disc. I am not sure which novel was written first but similarities are eerie. In both movies, there is a secret service agent being pursued by his own people and at the same time trying to figure out a mystery regarding his own organization. In both movies, he kidnaps a woman with whom he later develops a romantic connection. Probably the biggest difference is that Bourne begins with an amnesia not remembering his own identity. Aside from that, both movies are very similar. But they are both unique in their own way.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this movie to anybody who is interested in spy thrillers; this is one of the best examples of the genre. It doesn't have the same pace and action sequences as Bourne movies, but the story, the characters, they all hold up pretty well. I also enjoy seeing Robert Redford and Faye Dunaway in their best (Faye Dunaway also starred in Network, which is one of my favorite movies from that time, and Robert Redford in All President's Men, another great movie). Another interesting thing, I noticed, is all the shots of the world trade center. It is a great nostalgia and somehow sad at the same time to see the world trade center in the 70s
1401937268|5|Art work is fantastic, easy to use. Nice quality card stock and detailed book included.
B009IQ0TGM|5|This album is great. &#34;Lights&#34; is very mainstream, so it's hard to appear hip when you like it, but if you name drop the other songs I feel like you get instant credibility amongst people who judge.
B00BVMXBDO|5|Orphan Black is simply one of the best first seasons I can ever remember seeing from a tv show, especially on an unproven cable network like BBC America. Tatiana Maslany's performances pull together a great cast of characters and some excellent writing into a truly extraordinary experience. Definitely worth owning (and rewatching frequently) for any TV fan.<br /><br />My only complaint is the rather sparse extras. All but two of the interviews/featurettes included here were originally available from other sources either televised or online. I would have liked more exclusive content, and an episode commentary or two would have been fantastic. However, the overall quality of the show is so high I can't bring myself to take off a star for lack of additional features.
B005LAII80|5|Amazing buy it, watch 3d if possible, hugely underrated.
B007IXWKUK|5|Could not put it down and I'd highly recommend it.<br />Am now reading the third in the series and fully enjoying it.
B0040JBAMY|5|No problem here
B008ROG1QI|5|Great movie!
B00BAXFJ5M|5|Good read<br />Would recommend<br />Lot of intrigue<br />Will read more of his novels and will tell others about this book
B00CWY76CC|4|Was challenging enough but not too difficult so it was fun. Only giving 4 stars until they get more than ten levels...great free game!
B003MC5L9S|4|This book should be a must read for everybody. So inspiring... It is incredible to know how much effort is made just to make us diverge from our main purpose; the elevation of one's self. That's the only freedom, that's the only truth.
B0054JZC6E|5|The game must be played its so so fun to play so you must down load it to rate the best game ever in the entire world so do it.
B00AGOGOLE|1|love the kindle fire BUT  this APP makes NO SENSE.  there is no camera lense in the back of the KINDLE FIRE to take picture.  the lense face YOU.
B00BB8RKH6|5|was not bad at all , I was thinking worse , but I watch to the end with interest , I like Denzel Washington and how he performed in this movie , did not like the movie character , really creepy scenario .. HOWEVER ON THE OTHER SIDE , it was just right
B00B4804KS|4|It wasn't originally shot in 3D nor is it 1080p native, so there's only so much that you can do with the quality. Still a worthy purchase IMO.
B000E1MTY0|5|First off, it really doesn't matter how good a film looks and sounds if it sucks!  That being said, Batman Begins HD DVD delivers both the quality plot and the quality format.<br /><br />I'm sure you have heard about how great this movie is, so I won't spend much time on that.  It is by far the best of the Batman franchise.<br /><br />Why you are probably reading this review is to find out about the HD DVD format quality--is it all it is hyped to be?  If you have to go out and spend $1500 on a good HDTV and $1000 for a HD DVD player (or Blu-Ray for other titles), my answer is \\"no.\\"  In all other cases (you already have some of the pieces e.g. HDTV, Xbox 360 + HD DVD) then assuradely \\"yes!\\"<br /><br />There are several scenes that are just jaw-dropping, including my favorite scene in Gotham near the end (no spoilers here).  The quality is as good as others have hyped, both for the Title and for the format.<br /><br />When I first popped it in, I was somewhat disappointed in the quality--but then I realized that my wife had changed the TV settings to her brighter preferences for video games.  A couple of adjustments, and presto!  Be sure to double check your settings, too--they make a huge difference.
0385344228|1|The idea sounds great but when a book fails to excite me and get my interest in the first 30 pages, it lets me know I made a mistake getting it.  We're still dwelling on the neighbors, how he loves his wife, and how uninteresting the morning breakfast conversation is at this point.  I do so much appreciate Amazon's return policy. Good luck to those of you that can bear with this boring book.
B00A4YVHXQ|4|I like this game and so do my 7 and 9 year old girls.  The easy songs and some of the normal songs are good.  However, I have been playing piano since I was 9.  I am quite good, but this game is hard.  You must play 2 notes at a time, throughout some of the songs.  Maybe if I had an ipad with a bigger screen than my 7&#34; tablet, it wouldn't be so tough, but those keys are too small to hit 2 at a time accurately.  I haven't had the app for that long, so who knows what practice may bring.  This is just my initial impression.
B00004THAY|4|B.B.King is Still The Man.He is Ageless.Eric Clapton I Prefer His Older Material like 30 years back.but when Him&amp;Mr.King Throwdown it's tight.they have alot of CHemistry together.this Album Has Solid  Vocals,Production,Arrangements&amp;of COurse Musicianship.check it out.
B007IXWKUK|5|Wow after reading second book you are left with no words. Truthfully, even if you are left with no words...you crave for wanting to know more. If truly there could be more than being Fifty Shades of Grey.
0345457684|5|Outstanding first novel. Richard K. Morgan has just made a fan for life with this book, I hope we will see a series featuring this character.  <br />Filled with everything I love in a book, sex, violence, a little mystery and a little romance, and a [tough] character that takes no [guff].  <br />In a future where people are able to \\"download\\" themselves into different bodies (what they call sleeves), Tak Kovacs is a breed a part from the rest.  Being a former Envoy in which his mind is conditioned to exert itself and any \\"sleeve\\" he wears. <br />Great idea, however I have seen this played out before in a couple low rate movies.  Namely \\"The Sixth Day\\", in which you wonder if humans are only made up of the product of there memories.  I would like to have seen Morgan dig a little deeper into that realm.  <br />However you will enjoy this novel.
B000JMKNJ2|5|This is a fantastic series, if you're a fantasy fan at all, or even just a fan of a good story, start this series.  Every bit as good as Game of Thrones series, more readable in my opinion, and just as interesting.  Scott Lynch does a tremendous job on this series.  Buy it.
B000O179FO|5|This is a very good movie.  I love it.The quality is great.
B000FCK65W|5|This story is charming in following the life of a young Irish-American girl born into poverty. For those of us who had Depression-era parents, this tells the story about their hopes and fears. Just the luxury of staying in high school was not available to everyone in the 1930s. Francie, the main character, is extremely bright and intuitive about her family and life. I felt like I was learning about my mother who was kept from going to college because she was female while her brother was sent to college and he didn't want to go. The same happens in this story. The beauty of this story is not in plot twists and turns, but in the beautiful development of a young lady in understanding who she is and what she may become.
B000002KET|3|Black Sabbath / Sabbath bloody Sabbath:  The title track is reason enough to buy the album, and there are a couple of other good tracks here, but the rest is Sabbath in full-blown parody of itself.  Although I got a kick out of seeing them at the quasi-legendary `California Jam' concert, the SBS album was the last of theirs that I would found any interest in.  It deserves 3 1/2 stars, but I can't honestly give it 4.
B004LQGXPA|5|Review needed?  Just watch the first scene and tell me you don't want to go kill some taliban...  &#34;American's are fighters...&#34;
B00A6CCF0K|4|Enjoyed it, classic King, never a dull moment. Wasn't exactly what I would have envisioned as a follow up to the Shining, but well worth the read.
B000WQ9UA8|4|This CD is the most consistent that has come out this year.  Every track is good and at least half of them are slammin.  I have never bought a Britney CD before but after being sucked into several tracks online I realized this is not the Britney that I thought I knew.  The lyrics are real and about what she is going through mixed with some crazy beats.  My favorites are Break the Ice, Ooh Ooh Baby and We can do it.  Every song could be a radio hit.  I found a song online called Let Go which is Britney singing with a piano and slight galloping sound.  Her voice is untouched from the recording booth.  You can hear her turn the page as she sings.  If you doubt that she can sing, I dare you to find it and listen.  She is truly talented whether you like her or not.  I was suprised to hear what kind of range she had. Peace
B0053KWDES|4|I bought this to add a little more grunt to my iPOD to overcome engine and wind noise while riding my motorcylce.  It does that but I guess I was hoping for little more than it delivers.  On the other hand the sound is great and it is compact.  It is awkward to actuate with gloves on but then again so is the iPOD. Haven't had it for long so I cannot comment on long term reliability but in general I find it to be a good product.  I just wish the portable MP3 makers would build some extra boost capabilities into their products.
B001HNE3NO|5|Loved it!!
1416972242|5|This is a great follow-up. I've now read the whole series and as it the author's style, this book is fairly long and drawn out. I, for one, enjoy the build up, back stories, and great detail, but some may consider this book and thus the series a &#34;slow read.&#34; The action happens at the end and results in a cliff-hanger that gets resolved in the beginning of book three. While the book is long, it is an easy read. I am not a fast reader, but I finished this in three days just doing a little reading after work.<br /><br />Pros: Easy read.<br />Plethora of details make you feel connected to the story and characters.<br />Long book (and a long series) which allows for complex narratives to be drawn out<br />While book 1 introduced the characters, this book shows us the flaws in the characters and shows the forshadowing to how these character flaws will come into play later.<br />At least in the book I purchased, the first chapter to Book 3 was included.<br /><br />Cons: The books are predictable in that the you get hooked in the beginning with action that sets up the story, the middle 400 pages are story and leading up to something, the last pages are the climax and cliff-hanger whose resolution occurs in the beginning of the next book.
B009LDCZ7I|5|Great series.
B008JGSM6G|5|Fun and entertaining for all  ages.  It really challenges your brain.  It is addictive. Great challenging levels.<br />I highly recommend Flow Free.
B000002ADT|4|... but I loved this album.  For those who are not major jazz experts, but are interested in the music, I highly suggest picking this CD up.  I believe it's a great intro to this music and you can't beat Miles Davis and  this classic album.<br />On the whole, the music is soothing and mellow.  If  you want music to relax to, write, read, etc..., this is the CD to get.  I  would say it's not as experimental as some of John Coltrane's later works,  so keep that in mind if you're looking for some really &quot;crazy&quot;  jazz pieces.<br />If you've never bought a jazz album but always wondered  where to start, this is it.  Get it and you'll find yourself more  interested in jazz and other artists.  It's a great starting point and just  classic, relaxing music, period.
0812550706|5|I don't know about the movie...but I read this book in high school and loved it so much that a couple of years ago I finally picked up a copy of this with the rest of the books for the quartet...None of the rest of the books are as great as this one.

0552555592|5|First published in 2010, \\"I Shall Wear Midnight\\" is set on the Discworld and is Terry Pratchett's fourth book to feature Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men.     Tiffany, still only fifteen, had been brought up on a farm in an area on the Chalk and - after a lengthy training period - has now returned home as the area's witch. Tiffany was inspired to follow the path's she's on by her Granny Aching, who'd always said it was important to stand up for those who have no voice. However, the Chalk's a wide area to cover, and there are times she has to push herself beyond her limits. Still, she wields a mean frying pan, is very good with cheese and, very luckily, she has the Nac Mac Feegle on her side. (The Feegle are a Pictsie race who were thrown out of Fairyland for being drunk, disorderly and rebellious : an extremely fast and strong race, their main hobbies are fond of fighting, stealing and drinking).     The book opens at the Scouring, a three-day fair held at the end of the summer. Most of the Chalk are there, but Tiffany feels pretty much alone. Now that she's \\"fully qualified\\", Granny Weatherwax and Nanny Ogg are leaving her to it and people tend to avoid getting too familiar. (There's the respecct that comes with the position but, thanks to the fairytale image of malevolent old hags, there's a touch of fear too - an image that's dying, but hasn't fully gone yet). The isolation Tiffany feels is a little more pronounced, in that she's the Chalk's first \\"official\\" witch - although Granny Aching has fulfilled the role for the area, she'd never actually gone through the formal training and worn the hat. Things have even gotten frosty between Tiffany and Roland, the Baron's son. Roland is now engaged Letitia, an exceptionally wet, dreary streak of handwringing misery. It had been widely expected that Tiffany would have been Roland's intended - in fact, it was something the old Baron himself had wanted.     The old Baron has been on his last legs for some time, and Tiffany has been helping him deal with the pain - much to the annoyance if his nurse. Sadly, there's nothing she can do to prevent his death - though, tanks to her help, at least he dies happily. With Roland and his fiancee in Ankh-Morpork, Tiffany herself makes the journey to break the bad news. Having beaten the Elf Queen, danced with the Wintersmith and seen off an Hiver, Tiffany has now attracted the very unwanted attentions of the an evil spirit called Cunning Man - and she meets him, face-to-face, on the journey. He despises witches, and is bent on reiniting the fear, mistrust and hatred that once led to witches being burnt at the stake. If he succeeds in beating Tiffany, the temperature will once again rise.     Like everything else I've read by Pratchett, this is an excellent book. It's easily read, features plenty of likeable characters and there are plenty of laughs. On the down-side, I've never read a book by Pratchett that's felt so much like an ending - although Pratchett's personal circumstances mean there won't be too many more books, the thought of no more Feegle makes me a little sad. Absolutely recommended, naturally - though it's probably best to read \\"The Wee Free Men\\", \\"A Hat Full of Sky\\" and \\"Wintersmith\\" first.
B00AGJ4HC2|4|We recently tried this at our friends' monthly board game night.  We break off into groups to play some of the smaller games (this only accommodates four players tops).<br /><br />It helped that I'd watched the \\"Tabletop\\" episode (or at least the \\"Tabletop Day\\" episode from the live-streaming day).  It also helps that there are \\"quick reference\\" cards for each player to refer to.<br /><br />Simple set-up and initially we weren't sure, but a few rounds in we all got a feel for the strategy inherent in the game.  Plenty of replay value, too, and it's also small/portable so something that's easily brought to social gatherings.
0060930349|5|Sweeping story of America.  Love a book like this that gives you just enough meat/detail to make it interesting but not so much that you get lost in the detail.  Really a great book and enjoyed it a lot.  Gives you a real understanding of how the US shaped up to form what we have today.  I always had a lot of questions about how the country ended up the way it did and how historical events \\"fit\\".  This book gives you the picture of how it formed up including movement west, formation of states, our relationships to other countries, wars, migration of people, slavery, I think every President, etc.  Really a great book and I am going to go back and read it again.  Also, thinking of offering my young kids a prize if they read it and retain the info.
B007IXWKUK|4|I enjoyed this book , just as much as the first one.  The ending has quite a bit of a twist that I wasn't expecting so I'm excited to start the next book!
B007FKI9G0|5|This ensemble works seamlessly together, even though a lot of it is improv. Love the tunes and the premise. It really hits home if you're a musician.
B00003JRCQ|5|Another of Mary's favorites.
B002ZG981E|5|I had a dream where this movie was the key to changing my world,  so I bought it.
B000WQ9UA8|4|To me, better than In the Zone.  May have been rushed to market and ridiculously leaked, but still has some of Brit's best.<br /><br />These are the 5 best on the album.  Break the Ice being the best, followed by a tie for second with Gimme More & Ooh Ooh Baby -- third claimed by Radar, followed by Hot as Ice.<br /><br />1. Gimme More<br />3. Radar<br />4. Break The Ice<br />9. Hot As Ice<br />10. Ooh Ooh Baby<br /><br />Yes it's very produced, though not as much as some older albums; yes, she has been in the public eye for some not-so-great-things -- still the album is fun, a good listen, and if you've liked any Britney songs before, you will most likely enjoy this one.
B00GLX1MG6|5|I loved this but would not have thought a thing about letting a kid be in here watching it , thank god none were.. had no clue it was so descriptive and well adult. thought it was funny but def not a kids show or family show like i thought it was

B00BMKDTNC|4|The book was so good, I stayed up late reading just to get in as much time as I could. The ending left me wanting, at lease put in an prologue revealing how the world has changed and how everyone is doing to give closure but even lacking that it was still good.
B0000039QA|1|about this being the greatest double c.d. and all that other [stuff], \\"all eyez on me\\" was and still is the greatest double album and in fact album period. i only like \\"notorious thugs\\" in this whole album, westcoast for like man, 2pac is still ballin homies.

0792164903|4|Depp did a string of adaptations in the late 90's early 00's, 'Sleepy Hollow' and 'From Hell' to name a few.  I hadn't until the other night seen this film, but I had heard mixed reviews regardless.  It's by no means a wonderful film, but its stylish take on the classic tale is a bit intriguing.  Depp plays Crane, a detective sent to unravel the mystery behind recent beheadings in the small town of Sleepy Hollow.  The townsfolk all know it's the work of the headless horseman, but Crane isn't convinced.   <br /> <br />Depp plays his character as only Depp could, with that awkward feeling permeating every move that makes his characters appear more natural than rehearsed.  Christina Ricci, who plays Depp's mysterious love interest, does a decent job as well, carrying her weight in a Depp driven project, but its Burton who really steals the show.  Tim is one of our finest directors, and as was mentioned, he is over-the-top, but that's what makes him so enjoyable.  There's no subtlety, and like with most of Burton's masterpieces it is layered with humor which adds to the atmosphere only Burton can paint. <br /> <br />I didn't find this to be a scary film, not in the least, but it was an interesting film with enough entertaining value to keep the viewer watching time and time again.
B008CYDDWI|4|This was the beginning of the Living Dead. It is a must have for those who are into that stuff.
B00VWQ3LQG|4|2015R: Could've used less babbling by the evil genius a$$hole (Nathan) and more interaction between Ava and Caleb. (interesting names). A decent movie about just some of the dangers of 'creating' self-aware beings ...<br /><br />Reminded me why humans aren't fit to develop true AI in robotic form. While this god-like behavior would lead us to believe we were creating our slaves, we'd only be creating our masters. Enjoy MFJLabs 4x

B00005JM02|5|I remember the magic surrounding the first movie I was taken to see. I knew at the time it was something special. Even now, every time the lights dim, I feel that same magic. I wanted to create the same experience for my son's first cinema experience. I was choosy about the movie and am happy that we were not dissapointed by Finding Nemo. My 3 1/2 year old son enjoyed popcorn and High-C while taken to a far away place. We both enjoyed the feature and I'm glad there weren't any questionable moments in the movie. Watching him enjoy the big-boy experience of a fascinating movie in a theatre was a double treat for me. Thank you Pixar for letting G movies be for kids and parents and helping me create a little magic for my little boy.<br />Brenda
B0041KKYBA|5|I know my review is simply adding to the positive numbers, but it truly is a must see. From the great interviews, to the overal presentation. Plus it brings to light all the economic and housing issues that hurt us all so badly. Charles Furgeson is brilliant.

B000002IZM|4|Like other reviewers here, I love this CD but am slightly bummed that some  of the best cuts from the movie are absent. I have various bootleg CD's  that do contain all of the music that is missing from the official  soundtrack, but the audio quality is poor. Since this is my favorite all  time movie and soundtrack I suppose I will just have to create my own  bootleg CD from the DVD audio tracks!

B000002J20|5|A concept album from Yes' Golden Age, the Tales are a stunning tour de force that explore the more mystical side of the group.<br /><br />Although these lengthy tracks intimidated me at first, after repeated listenings I discovered tremendous depth and ingenuity. This is Yes in all its majestic glory, with everything you'd expect from them and a lot that may surprise you, especially if you are new to the group and its wandering ways.<br /><br />Although the first track, The Revealing Science of God, is probably the most famous (and utterly spellbinding in concert), I found the second, less-known track, The Remembering, to be my personal favorite. It's worth noting, however, that the over 80 minutes of music that comprise this double-disc album contain literally dozens of threads that must be followed from song to song to truly be appreciated.<br /><br />As with all Yes music, there is no limit to its richness and brilliance. This is music I will listen to again and again throughout the rest of my life (I've only been listening to Yes for about 15 years now), and it transcends generations: my teenage kids love this stuff (!!).<br /><br />Yet another modern classic from some of the best musical talent ever assembled in human history.
B0026P3G12|5|Very good quality and, of course, perfect pitch from Susan.  Enjoyed this cd immensely
B006VRDZ44|5|A very pleasant alternative to the &#34;tired&#34; dramas on network television.  Excellent story lines and acting. Weaving real life characters from long ago: Meyer Lansky, Arnold Rothstein, Lucky Luciano, Al Capano, etc, into the narratives was a great idea.  After watching a few seasons of Boardwalk Empire, people will find it difficult to believe that Nucky Thompson died of &#34;old age&#34; in the 60s!

B000002BFZ|4|&quot;No Code&quot; is my least favorite PJ album, but then again, this is Pearl Jam and all of their albums are great.  I strongly agree with the listener who said this was like &quot;Led Zeppelin III&quot;.  This album  has two great aspects about it, that it wasn't main-stream, and that there  are a variety of songs on it.  Hard hitting rock blowouts like &quot;Lukin  and Hail, Hail&quot; to softer songs such as &quot;Off He Goes&quot; which  is one of the best PJ songs.  I think &quot;No Code&quot; definitely was  underated by the masses, but true music lovers could see the briliance put  into this record.  Even the package design is great.  So, if you've heard  bad things about this album, give it a chance and see what you think.  I'm  sure you'll love it.  Like I said before, you can't go worng with a Pearl  Jam record.
B00FAPF5U0|4|I like it!!
B000MVN8GK|5|I love a good crime drama and this was a great mix of interesting crime detection and solution mixed with snappy dialog and a bit of subtle humor thrown into the mix. Thoroughly enjoyed the seasons even though season one was a bit better than the rest. Cannot say I was happy with the abrupt end of this series and lack of closure with the various characters.

B00IX9UTLU|5|I ordered this series several months ago, and I finally got around to read it. I was pleasantly surprised by the storyline. I assumed the books had sex scenes in them, but didn't think they'd be as vivid as they were (in a good way). The story between the sex will have you on an emotional roller coaster that is worth every moment.

0812550706|5|Ender's Game, the origin of Orson Scott Card's grand saga of Earth's future, is perhaps the best science fiction novel I have read.  It is getting on in years now, and many who have never read it may relegate it as a relic of those dusty, \\"Golden Age\\" science fiction stories where dry expositions on hypothetical technology supersede--and often completely nullify--the impact of the story. <br /> <br />Ender's Game is a novel of much higher caliber.  The characters are true and real, deeply human and agonizingly flawed.  Humanity, faced with extinction in a decades-long war with an alien race, has its back to the wall.  We cheer for our fellow humans, but not blindly.  We see their flaws and we feel their pain, and we shake our heads at the mistakes of the \\"grown-ups\\" when faced with children so brilliant as Ender and his contemporaries. <br /> <br />The impending doom of all humanity pushes the urgency of the story to a near fever-pitch.  This is one book that is easily readable in one sitting, simply for its rapid-fire pace and adrenaline injected plot. <br /> <br />While Ender's Game is chock-full of adventure and war, Card has also created a wealth of emotional, moral, and religious conflicts that cling to the reader long after he has set the book down.  It is here, where Ender grapples with his destiny, where the genius-children--victims of their society--fight among themselves and challenge their world, that Ender's Game truly hits home.  This book, and its lessons, questions, conflicts, and triumphs, is one to re-read over and over.   <br /> <br />I know I do, and I get something different and wonderful every time.
B00C1BTWV4|5|Ok Dino's...a story line that has possibilities.....and when this movie came out by far the best movie animation. Great actors...even the kids did a great job.....Worthy of owning as a classic In your DVD collection.

B008966SIU|5|Grizzly Bear have made a reputation for themselves as being a precise, meticulous and at times very uptight and stuffy rock band. I use the term 'rock band' very loosely as well. Go back and listen to Yellow House and Veckatimest and tell me with a straight face that those two albums are rock albums. Do it.  I dare you. Listen, I'm not putting down Grizzly Bear because the fact of the matter is that I love Grizzly Bear. They create mood, emotion(in a truncated way) and an atmosphere of grandiosity within their chamber pop songs. It's like the Brodsky Quartet scoring an Ingmar Bergman film. It's just that in the past the guys in Grizzly Bear, while making very emotional and powerful music, had a tendency to keep the listener at arms length. You felt that there was something more they wanted to say, but out of embarrassment or fear of sharing too much and scaring us away they cut their message short and clammed up just when they were getting to the point.<br /><br />Well, the overly shy and introverted Grizzly Bear is no more. With Shields, Grizzly Bear's fourth full-length, they have made their most open, loose and absolute best album to date.<br /><br />'Sleeping Ute' opens the album with a  wild, drunken sway. Folksy and musty, this song gives off the feel of history. It has the smell of old leather and the cold sea air. This song grooves and breathes like no other Grizzly Bear song up to this point. It reminds me of CSNY's 'Wooden Ships' but leaner and more direct. It's a song that looks at you eye-to-eye, never looking off to the side. 'A Simple Answer' is another track that you would've never heard on a Grizzly Bear album up to this point. A driving tom-filled beat, with Rossen singing \\"Those saints in Lockstead/Across the wasteland/Forever gone/They're home and walk along\\", you get a bit of story telling in this very pop-inflected song. It's such a carefree song that you almost forget who you're listening to.<br /><br />Rossen isn't the only one to undo the top button on his neatly pressed shirt and loosen his tie. Ed Droste sings us some great songs within this great album. 'Gun-Shy' is a breezy, head swaying pop song. It feels as if Droste has decided to not be so serious and enjoy the fact that he actually has a 'band' now. He needn't compose with the idea that these songs are being written for just his ears. He's taking full advantage of the fact that he's got an amazing band to fill out his quiet pop songs. 'Yet Again' has the emotional heft we've grown to love about a Grizzly Bear song, except with more of a heart-on-his-sleeve honesty in Droste's voice. Droste sounds like he's pulling these songs from his heart, not his head.<br /><br />Opening the windows and letting some fresh air and perspective within the Grizzly Bear band dynamic has opened them up to new possibilities. No longer do they sound meticulous and carefully planned. They sound relaxed and loose. They don't sound like an art rock project or an indie rock string quartet. They sound like a band that loves what they do. And we're the better for it.button on his neatly pressed shirt and loosen his tie. Ed Droste sings us some great songs within this great album.

B005721Y7Y|4|The following text is going to be a review of the film “American Beauty” which was published in 1999 and directed be Sam Mendes. It's about the differences of outward beauty and inner beauty.<br />The film starts with Lester, one of the main characters (played by Kevin Spacey) introducing the viewers to his neighbourhood and his family, his wife Carolyn (played by Annette Bening) and his daughter Jane (played by Thora Birch). The relationship between Lester and Carolyn is broken and his daughter is annoyed of him and thinks that he is to embarrassing to live. The other problem is his job, which does not make him happy any more and Lester just tries to find a way out of his boring life. As he sees Jane's best friend Angela at a basketball game cheer leading, he falls in love with her. Angela seems like a silver lining in Lester's life. Throughout the film, Lester changes completely. He starts smoking pot with the neighbours boy Ricky, who sees beauty in little thing and death and Lester starts working out to impress Angela. He changes his life style completely without realising that his family is falling more and more apart.<br />All of the characters have different personality’s, which are all kind of special and strange. The least strangest personality is probably Jane. In my opinion is she the most normal person in the film, even through she is a bit mean sometimes. The strangest personality in the film is probably Lester. Sometimes it's hard to follow his thoughts and also the fact that he has a crush on a girl that is the same age as his daughter is very strange.<br />The message of the film is actually a really good one. In the world is so much beauty, especially in the little things, which we don't pay attention to any more, because we're too much focused on other things. I think the director's intention is to show that outward beauty isn't always the prettiest thing in this world and that little things and the inner beauty can sometimes be way prettier.<br />The film is definitely different to other films. It is not a typical love film, because the age difference between Lester and Angela is way bigger than in normal love films. The film is also too dark for being a normal love film. The film does not show just the good and happy moments in an american daily life. It gives the viewer a realer view in a normal life, even when it sometimes gets really strange and dramatic.<br />The story definitely gains a lot attention because it is so different to other film stories. But I can imagine that the story is not for everyone. The soundtrack of the film fits perfect to the different scenes and support the feelings from the different characters. Also the camera work is good. Everything gets filmed out a good angle in which you can see the different reactions of the characters and the setting.<br />All in all you can say that the film is quite dramatic in many scenes, sometimes a bit too dramatic. But especially these scenes make you think the most. But also the things the characters say make you think, for example “There is so much beauty out there”.<br />So I would recommend the film to everyone on the fact that it got a great message. But I would not recommend it to someone who does not like drama films, because this film contains a lot of drama.
B004ZMWUCU|4|...and all the characters but at times, I found the conversations between some of the characters jibberjash and I just wanted the author to move on; hence, only the 4 stars.  If I could have rated 4 1/2 stars, I would have.<br /><br />I loved the main characters in the book and find myself still thinking about them even though the last page of the novel has been read...that's how I KNOW it was a very good book.<br /><br />I laughed out loud at some parts, cried at some parts and was moved by all of it.<br /><br />KUDOS to the author and my sincere appreciation for such a lovely, moving novel.

B000002L7J|4|This was the Smiths' 2nd album, and a very good one at that. I would still recommend &quot;The Queen Is Dead&quot; or &quot;The Smiths&quot; (debut) before this, but it's still a worthy one to add to one's collection.   &quot;Meat Is Murder&quot; shows Johnny Marr's maturity and mastery as one  of the 80's best guitarists. &quot;I Want The One I Can't Have&quot; and  &quot;Headmaster Ritual&quot;  absolutely rock. Flat-out stunners. And  &quot;Well I Wonder&quot; and &quot;That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore&quot;  show the Smiths at their more contemplative brooding mood. I think I'll go  listen to it right about now!

1586210912|5|Less than a year ago I was reading an article in Money Magazine. It was about a couple that was on their way to being millionaires. I remember the author saying that the couple had read this book by Robert Kiyosaki and \\"it changed their life.\\" For some reason it struck me as funny and I decided, \\" `changed their life' I guess it's worth a read.\\" So I read it and it changed my life. Both my wife and I have redirected our investments and the way we manage them. For the last 20 years I have diligently read books, general periodicals (Newsweek, Time, etc), Money magazine and the business section of the local paper to be a responsible head of household and steward of our money. This book brought clarity to my understanding of money. I realized that 90-95% of the materials I have read were essentially garbage. <BR>Now I have bought this book for all my family and recommend it to all my friends.<BR>One catch, RK writes his books as teasers to his other books (he knows how to make money). I have read many of them. This first one kills any previous misinformation you may have about money (probably the 90-95% stuff you think you know). The next two books (Cash Flow Quadrants and What the Rich Invest In) are more foundation and reinforcement. The rest are topic specific.

1595141715|5|Clay gets a mysterious package in the mail. It's a box containing old-fashioned cassette tapes. Hannah, a girl who recently committed suicide, recorded the tapes shortly before her death. On them she lists her reasons for killing herself, and Clay is one of her reasons. Clay listens with sadness, anger, and shock as Hannah recounts how thirteen people hurt her in some way, causing her to stop caring about her existence.<br /><br />The novel is suspenseful. As Clay plays each tape, I was waiting for the tape that would reveal his connection to Hannah's suicide. This book is sad and depressing, but in a good way. When a book, movie, or song touches me deeply it accesses emotions that I normally don't feel. And all this from a debut author! Asher is an amazing writer. Hats off to him.

B00M5J0XX8|3|First, I want to say The Bee Gees are part of my musical DNA. I grew up on them, defended them, always saw their talent above all else, was extremely happy to see them inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and terribly saddened along the way as Andy Gibb and Maurice Gibb died, and in May 2012, Robin, too. I can't imagine what it's like to be the eldest brother (Barry) and have lost all your brothers.<br /><br />I also want to say that as a kid, I was never aware of Robin's solo works. It wouldn't be until 1990's box set &#34;Tales From The Brothers Gibb&#34; that I became aware that both Robin and Barry released solo works in the 1980's. Still, finding Robin's solo works on cd over the years has been cost prohibitive and challenging. Even now, I see I can download his first three albums for a decent price, but his last two albums are nowhere to be found, unless you buy &#34;Magnet&#34; as an import cd, and unless you want to pay out the nose for &#34;Walls Have Eyes&#34;.<br /><br />With that in mind, I have never listened to a solo Robin Gibb album until now. While I appreciate the efforts of his family, at 17 tracks, my warning light went off. Unless all 17 tracks are superb there is going to be a lot of filler, and that, unfortunately, tends to be the case with &#34;50 St. Catherine's Drive&#34;.<br /><br />To me, the best tracks here are: &#34;Days Of Wine And Roses&#34;, &#34;Alan Freeman Days&#34;, &#34;Avalanche&#34;, &#34;One Way Love&#34;, &#34;Broken Wings&#34;, &#34;Sanctuary&#34;, &#34;Solid&#34; and &#34;All We Have Is Now&#34;, plus the demo of &#34;Sydney&#34; was decent as well. As much as I miss his voice, each brother, alone, is not equal to the whole collective, The Bee Gees. I always thought Andy Gibb should have been a part of The Bee Gees, by the way.<br /><br />So, yes, I need to buy up Robin's solo works and put &#34;50 St. Catherine's Drive&#34; in perspective, but for now, three stars--good, but not exactly memorable or classic.<br /><br />1970 Robin's Reign<br />1983 How Old Are You?<br />1984 Secret Agent<br />1985 Walls Have Eyes<br />2003 Magnet<br />2014 50 St. Catherine's Drive/><br />1970 Robin's Reign<br />1983 How Old Are You?<br />1984 Secret Agent<br />1985 Walls Have Eyes<br />2003 Magnet<br />2014 50 St. Catherine's Drive

B005IQZB14|5|Execellent hiking book.  A little agonizing at times.  She took on too much with the state of her mental health.
B00SNVHHW2|5|This album is not her best. But, I feel  she has made perhaps the best personal album ever with this release. In 2004, I saw Beth open for Pat Benatar. I knew nothing of her and thought what another ho hum opening act. From the first verse of song one, I was hooked. Halfway through her set , she told the audience she was nine months sober. Then she started to sing &#34; Leave The Light On&#34;. I was moved to tears. Needless to say within 24 hours, I purchased the first three albums and could not figure out , why she had not hit the big time. Actually, she just wasn't American Idol enough. Anyway, her pain she bore in her young life was quite evident in her bluesy voice and material. From that point her future albums alone and with Joe Bonnamassa were again pure gold. Then, this album of hope and self reflection comes along. Totally not Beth. Yet, happy endings in movies are my favorite. I sense from this material, Beth has found inner peace and as with all of her music has showed us her courage. It is an off pleasure to hear her happy. The songs are excellent and I feel Beth has overcome something to perform this. I will always love the blues toned Beth the most, but this album is special in a most personal way. Beth has found her &#34; field of clover&#34;. Simply magnificent!
B00DZ83IPS|1|Not too entertaining

B007TBZ63Y|5|Couldn't stop reading. Needless to say the housework didn't get done nor did the dogs get a walk for a couple days:) Loved the fast pace of the book but hated that it left you hanging and having to wait for the next installment. Still a good read. Highly recommend it.

B0001MDQ2G|5|The excellent composition of middle eastern and metal tune. This is excellent for Opeth, Dream Theater and Paradise Lost fans.<br /><br />Experience the blend of Symphony and Metal in the track \\"Mabool\\" or listen to the Opeth like vocals in \\"The Birth of Three\\", and embrace the beautiful voice and melody of \\"A'salk\\".<br /><br />This is a must get album, it's much more better than their previous album and the theme of the album is excellent...<br /><br />2 thumbs up for this.
B00R7FRTWI|5|Wonderful story that was way overdue to be told. Criminal how a man who saved our world as we know it was treated so terrible by all around him. A must see.
B005K17RU0|4|Great app for weather.
B000000WA4|5|To clear any confusion that one may feel when listening to clips of songs they've heard before on this page, such as myself, the clips are switched. What you hear on the first disc really should be the same number on the opposite disc, and vice versa. (I.e., If you were to click on Bullet with Butterfly wings, you wouldn't hear that song. It'd be the OTHER number six song.) If you figured that out already, then nevermind. This is just for people who CAN but DON'T think on a regular basis, like me. Oh, and, uh, Smashing Pumpkins rock... Sure....
B0093F3Q4K|4|It is a good performance, maybe not the best I think there was a need of more energy and power.
B005D51JQQ|1|Sting is one of my all time favorites. Everybody knows that he is not your average dumb musician. He's got money to pay for at  least several thousand airplane rides to and from the rainforest. 3 CDs and a VERY SHORT EDITED concert DVD for over $100??? Are you kidding me? Why not just charge $5,000 for it? Or maybe $49,000??? The Nirvana Box Set is $120 for 4 CDs and 1 FULL CONCERT DVD, and that is probably a bit overpriced, but at least it includes some rare material. The  U2 Achtung Baby Box Set has 6 CDs, and 4 DVDs for $130. It looks like U2 is the best priced among the 3 box sets by far. The material? All solo Sting stuff. Instead of remastering individual albums, just a few of his best tracks. B Sides like \\"Another Day\\" remain unreleased unless you count a live version on a live album. This is just way too expensive to justify purchase. If the used price goes to under $50, you can count me in. At $50.01, I am sad to admit I'm a Sting fan. It would seem he would understand the stupidity of releasing such a sad release for so much money during a global recession. This release deserves 5 stars for the music, but around negative 100 stars for the price. Come On Sting, you can't be this greedy can you? Or have you gone bonkers at age 60?

She dresses funny and is not one of the mainstream kids.  Jamie and Landon are an unlikely pair, but they are friends who grow to love and support one another in an extremely sensivite and well written love story.  A Walk to Remember promised to make me laugh and to cry.  I did both.   If you have not read it, it's a wonderful story.
B00AAQVSDW|5|... about how country music now is just 'pop' music with a cowboy hat on.  Maybe this is too.  But its got me hitting repeat.  I'm a displaced southern gal born in the heart of Nascar country, charlotte, NC.  but I mostly listen to pop and hip hop, I reckon its an '80's thing.  This album seems to satisfy all of my listening desires ... at least today.  fickle listener
B001GKJ2DY|5|Great product
B001FSDOZO|1|Not there best CD wish I hadn't bought it. My husband couldn't wait to hear it and now I don't think he'll listen to it again.

B00AQL8VU4|1|I bought an android tablet 2 years ago, had the amazon app store installed on it. I was recently trying to play some of my games that I had installed two years ago. They wouldn't work kept telling me to log in to the amazon app store. Ending up having to call tech support. Which after almost an hour on the phone (uninstall, reinstall). He informed me that this app is no longer compatible to my tablet. Not happy...
B007J4T2G8|5|Very well written and it hooks you from the first word.  Couldn't put it down.  I recommend it to anyone it is steamy but not too over the top.
B00CWY76CC|4|It is different from other games out there, so that makes it fun and entertaining especially for a free game!
B00ERIUO02|1|This album is awful! Same old Katy Perry.... I feel this is one of the weakest and worst albums out there. Katy Perry never does anything new. A real disappointment!
B000005ALP|5|This cd is definetly in my top 10 cd's of all time! I love this album. It has so much angst and depression but you can't help but love it! The eels send you on an emotional rollercoaster through this cd and leave you begging for more. It contains the hits Novacain for the Soul, Rags to Rags and my favourite Susans House! I can't recommend this cd enough. Even if you aren't an eels fan listen to this because trust me you will be a fan after you hear it!

B003XT8Y3K|5|This tenor is by far the best lyric artist in a century, he is able to carry a range of emotions through his voice right to you and carries you with him on a wonderful trip, the most touching artist that I have heard since Maria Callas.<br />M.F.M.
B000002INR|5|like Lynard Skynard ,  Pearl Jam, etc, , young and hungry the first album is the best  , end'd the 80's hard and fast and proper!<br />great album
B000W7JWUA|5|I enjoy strategy games, but before I played Settlers, the game's description sounded boring.  Once I played it twice, I loved it.  You need to play it a few times before you fully internalize the rules, but once you do, it is a lot of fun.  I bought Settlers as a Christmas gift for my family.  We have a great time playing it, and I would highly recommend Settlers for other families that enjoy playing strategy games like Risk or Axis and Allies or card games like Rook or Euchre together.<br /><br />Two things that you should know before you buy this game are that it takes a while to play and that you need competitive but relatively patient players.  Games of Settlers take our family at least 2 hours and usually about 3.  Your first few games as new players may take even more time.  However, games go considerably more quickly once all players have experience.<br /><br />Settlers of Catan is a terrific game; give it a shot!
B000024D4R|5|Along with The Piper and Wish You Were Here, I consider Animals to be Pink Floyd's artistic peak. Of course there are other PF albums with excellent music (for this band, 'excellent' is an understatement), but Animals is where Waters' views and sarcasm excellent words and the music are in total match. Instead of The Wall, where we find lots of songs and lot of nonsense preachery, here the few songs are all magnum opus in musical development and 'poetic' and direct lyrics. Never before (with the exception of Time and Money from DSOTM) Pink Floyd lyrics were so direct and down to earth, making the band not another far out / dreamy experience, but 'thinking man's music' (for PF, another understatement).  David Gilmour's guitar playing in Dogs is one of the best performances in rock history; Check also R Waters' bass in Pigs, unusual and funky; R Wright has also his showcase in all the songs, what would be of Floyd without its keyboards and sequencers?  Try to find the bootlegs from the In The Flesh 1977 tour, they are even better!
B002DJSBMA|5|one of the best ever

B002NXSRVG|5|This is a really good movie.  It seems to me that Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow steal the show.
B003LXSY60|1|I have never felt compelled to write a review on Amazon. After reading how critics love it, fans love it, everybody loves it I decided that I had provide another point of view. Simply put, this album sucks. That is an opinion of course, but what made me love the Black Keys is no longer present with the band. It started to fade with Attack and Release and has now completely disappeared. I really like Rubber Factory - it got me into the Black Keys -  but I think the simplicty of Magic Potion was the best. Big Come Up was great, Thickfreakness was great. Attack and Release had two really good songs. I bought Dan's album and wasn't impressed. It grew on me a little but I still think it lacks the Black Keys energy.    Anyways, if you liked Dan's solo album, you will love this. It is slow, steady, lifeless, and for the most part boring. If you on the other hand like raw, simple music full of energy, don't buy this.     To the BK's credit, they have been doing this for awhile. They don't want to keep playing the stripped down rock/blues forever. I had just hoped that when they matured their sound they wouldn't lose their raw energy. They did.
B00CNEVHMG|5|I saw YES at Madison Square Garden when this album was out, and I do have a player to take SACD so I could'nt resist this special release. The band was energized with Rick Wakeman back in the fold. It is a good record and I think one that has \\"aged\\" very well. Steve Howe in particular comes across very strong on this record- I have always felt this is among his best in studio guitar work with YES. There is the punchy opening title track featuring some ripping slide guitar from Howe- while some of their songs could seem a bit cerebral on the studio albums, the song \\"Going for the one\\" is among the harder rocking things YES recorded in the studio. Plus Chris Squire contributes one of the greatest tunes he ever wrote for YES with \\"Parallels\\", again Howe turns in some impressive lead guitar work. And \\"Awaken\\" proved to be a show stopper to stand alongside their other epics. The only tune I'm not crazy about is \\"Turn of the century\\", but it has its fans.<br />YES was a band that had it all. They were musical geniuses- maybe that's why they could never stay together long. Plus they could bring it onstage- even their more complex pieces were brought off by the amazing musicianship of every member, as well as theatrical considerations. The challenge of how to present a studio creation in concert, that aspect of performance in particular seems to be a lost art these days. YES really knew how to conceptualize their music on stage. Although \\"Going for the one\\" is recorded in studio, somehow this album manages to sound a little more like YES in concert than some of their other studio records.<br />As far as the sound quality- even the original album on LP always had a slight cardboard quality to it. That was one of the things I noticed about it listening to the album in 1977. Maybe that was down to the absence of their usual studio engineer Eddie Offord (who did some great work for YES, ELP and others). Subsequent issues on CD did'nt seem to offer anything special- and were sometimes made worse by making it sound brighter and harder.<br />This SACD remaster was taken on by Mr. Steve Hoffman and is a specialty \\"audiophile\\" disc. I am familiar with Mr. Hoffman from his forum and the magazine interviews I had read in the 90's, the DCC Lp/CD work he did (I first saw his name on a DCC Freddie King CD called \\"Getting Ready\\"), and more recently the remastering projects he has done under the Audio Fidelity moniker. He has a reputation for being painstaking about finding truly the best source- the genuine master tape, the exact reels mixed to two track in the studio at the time the record was made- he sends anything else back- sometimes holding out a year or more until he gets what he wants. Now he said on his forum this SACD is like the real thing. The disc is close to how the original master tape sounds he says.<br />I did not hear the master tape, but in listening to the stereo SACD layer of the disc, I feel this is the best \\"Going for the one\\" has sounded- and I include the old LP in that too- which is not to say it sounds as good as the earlier albums engineered by Eddie Offord. Steve Hoffman has managed to bring some low end heft without the usual bloat- now we can more fully appreciate the mind blowing bass of Chris squire. And Hoffman has the mid range as being nicely organic, while the treble is natural- neither dull nor bright. Vocals are full of life, and there is an ample sense of space to everything. On the albums centerpiece \\"Awaken\\", Mr. Hoffman does a good job of laying out the tracks sonic intricacies for the listener to savor- and with its spiritual nature, church organ and choral vocal parts at the climax- listening to this one almost makes you feel like you're in church.<br />5.1 is not a priority for me- but it surely will be to others so that is a factor. But keep in mind the tapes Hoffman used were mixed for stereo- the early incarnation of surround sound (called quadraphonic) had quickly come and gone by then. So maybe thisone is mainly for 2 channel audio listeners. Otherwise I highly recommend the SACD of this excellent Yes album, one that I think will be greatly appreciated in years to come.
B000000W9Z|5|I am David Bowies biggest fan ever... I know every lyric of every song he's ever even thought of releasing. Outside is by far my favorite Bowie album. It is amazing. It is dark, but fun. No two songs on it are remotley the same. Outside is the best album I've ever heard... I've worn out about 5 copies of it and have to keep stocking up on Outside CD's, because they go everywhere with me. Its one of those albums that you can listen to once, smile, then listen to it again... and again and again and again... A MUST HAVE!!!
B00ER23UYA|5|Wonderful artist. Very original.
B0083SBMBM|5|This is what a comicbook movie is suppose to be like. Sure, there were moments that defy logic but this is not a movie based on reality, it's a comicbook movie. For me, the Hulk stole the show (poor Loki)! Make sure you fast-forward during the credits because there are 2 after-credit buttons.
B00MNYTWMI|2|Started out good but too much minor details repeated and the ending was a big disappointment. A nine year old child could have been more imaginative. I would not recommend it for a thinking person who enjoys solving mysteries.

B007V65R54|4|This is not a textbook but rather a narrative with some simple math and statistics illustrations.<br /><br />Nate gives a clear description of bad vs. good analysis. It is clear that political pundits who know how to use good analysis have an advantage.<br /><br />This is essentially how Nate predicted the 2012 national election with such high accuracy. He has been tracking the opinions, based on polls, and determining which are the most predictive. He uses a broad range of polls and weights them based on their past history of accuracy in past elections.<br /><br />The book is intended for the lay person to understand that there is wide variation in the performance in the work of analysts. Part of the key differentiation between analysts that rely on discredited frequentist statistical methods, which are still being taught at our universities, and those that embrace Bayesian statistical methods, which are being used by actuaries, gamblers and anyone who has an an informed opinion potential future events.<br /><br />The frequentists are discredited because their methods do not predict events well, and are also discredited because much research that draws incorrect conclusions are based on these methods. The bayesian approach is becoming the preferred approach for predictive model building because it uses all informed opinions about the future and tests them. The models built in this manner improve over time as opinions that are proven right take on more weight in predictions, and opinions that prove incorrect are diminished and removed from the analysis.

B005FRF6PC|4|An honest and insightful account of a great athlete. Many a young athlete would derive a profit by reading and applying the lessons contained in it.
B000URDEB0|3|Even though it has the word Nightwish on the cover and on the CD, this is EPICA's music.    There is hardly any difference b/t this Nightwish CD and \\"The Divine Conspiracy\\" CD from EPICA.  They sound the same.    Sad to see Tarja leave the band.  Yeah, they got a good replacement, but to be honest, it sounds more like EPICA than it does Nightwish.    I would recommend to look into EPICA CDs if you want to find a songs that sound similar to this.  \\"The Phantom Agony\\" CD, \\"Consign to Oblivion\\" CD, and their new one \\"The Divine Conspiracy\\" CD.    \\"Dark Passion Play\\" is not Nightwish.  This is EPICA.    So, don't expect to see anything new or different on here that is not on any other EPICA CD.  Other than that, it is a very good CD, and it is definitely worth listening to, if you like EPICA's music that is.

006202406X|2|It was obvious early on the direction the author was going to take the story. I was hoping that I was wrong, but I was right and once it happened I closed my kindle and stopped reading. It was a total let down. I was totally into the series reading all of them in a few days, only to be left feeling deflated and a little ticked off to be honest. I don't even know if I'll watch the movie. Personally, it's not an ending that I want to see on the big screen.

B000EHSVQ4|4|The director's cut edition of Kingdom of Heaven gives this film its justice it so rightly deserved when it first came on the big screen.  Knowing little, but some of the crusades, this film is not only for entertainment, but used as education.  Not only did we learn about these true-life characters that shared our world around a thousand years ago, but we learned about humanity and frame of thought way back when.  Granted, this movie is not a completely accurate factual representation of characters and events, but it is factual in the sense that it tells us how we lived, how we loved, and what we believed in.  When I first saw Gladiator, I was amazed by the cinematography, design and costumes of the time.  Enriching characters that sucked you into the film.  A sign of a great movie is when you no longer think of Russell Crowe or Joaquin Phoenix as playing Maximus and Commodus respectfully, but when you think you are actually watching a Roman gladiator and actually watching a Roman Emperor duel it out for control of Rome.  These great depictions of these type of characters is what Ridley Scott brings to Kingdom of Heaven.  What was even better about the acting this time around is that not all the characters in this movie are as overhyped and well-known for that matter.  Case and point, King Baldwin IV.  I truly understood this man and his message and his role back in Jerusalem and took him for a king, nothing more.  Later I came to find out that the character of Baldwin was played by Ed Norton.  All these other images and thoughts of Norton in his other roles came into my head.  Never would I think he'd be capable of such a role.  But that's the magic of it all.  I don't want to go into great detail on all the characters, but it's the smaller characters of this movie that really sell this film as a great film.  Yes, the storyline had its flaws and there were some gaps, but just as in Troy and Gladiator, the acting of other characters and smaller roles makes the movie.  Were we not inspired by the great late Oliver Reed as Proximo??<br /><br />David Thewlis as the Hospitaller.  His claim to fame is his great acting in the Harry Potter films, yet these small scenes in which he was in, really make the viewer understand the film's message, his character's message.  The line \\"What god desires is here (points to Balian's head) and here (points to Balian's heart).  And what you decide to do every day will make you a good man...or not.\\" is powerful.  In a turbulent world of politics, religion, and greed, his character stands out in the film as having his morals and faith before going to battle, for \\"God\\".  And finally, Martin Csokas as Guy de Lusignan.  Is this not the greatest medieval villain you have ever seen?  Whether you hated his character as the leader of the Templars (which he really wasn't), you sort of wanted him to appear more and more throughout the movie.  He's the antagonist, the opposite to Balian, yet his character is powerful, royal, and evil.  \\"You sit at my table\\"  \\"Is it not the king's table?\\"  \\"Is it now?  I have not seen the king at it for quite some time.  In France, this would not inherit.\\"  While the writing was weak in some parts, mainly the ending of the film, the dialogue between the characters was superbly fitting for the time..

0316228532|3|When Barry Fairweather dies it opens up a casual vacancy on the city council.  A casual vacancy is defined as a situation in which an unexpected opening occurs on a political board, as in the case of a death or disqualification.  Mr. Fairweather's death throws the town of Pagford into turmoil to say the least.  The town has been divided for many years over the issue of \\"The Fields\\" and under which jurisdiction they should reside.  Do the residents of The Fields reside in Pagford and use their resources or do they belong to the neighboring, larger town of Yarvil?  Currently the populace of The Fields is made up of low income, government dependent residence so many in Pagford would like to see them sent to Yarvil, Barry Fairweather is a popular resident of Pagford and he came from The Fields and he has made many good argument about why the people of Pagford need to take care of the people of The Fields.  The death of Barry Fairweather heralds a change in the weather for the anti-Fields clan and they are eager to fill his seat with a candidate sympathetic to their cause.<br /><br />Initially, I had a problem with keeping all the characters straight and which side of the issue they fell.  Then, I realized it didn't really matter.  The book wasn't really about that.  The book was about all these people struggling to survive in this little town.  There was the married Indian doctor in love with another man and her bullied daughter.  The desperate housewife that finds sexual gratification in much younger men.  There are also the children of the town who do some really crazy things to escape the pressures of their parents.  Plus, all the other characters floundering in the wake of Barry Fairweather's death.<br /><br />I was somewhat disappointed in this book.  I don't know what I was really expecting, but this wasn't really it.  There were a few times when I felt like putting it down in favor of something more exciting, but I knew if I did I probably wouldn't pick it up again.  So I stuck it out and the ending did make up for the less than thrilling beginning and middle.  I know a lot of us were secretly hoping for a few flashes of the Harry Potter world and there are definitely NONE of those.  This was a very realistic book and it was dark and depressing...it was sad.  I can't take anything away from JK Rowling's writing talent though.  It was wonderfully written, despite the fact that I didn't particularly care for the story itself.

0345444051|3|Childhood's End is 1 of the earliest novels in the oeuvre of Arthur C. Clarke, & 1 of his best. 1 of the interesting things about reviewing very successful works long after their debut is how their very success can sometimes make the work seem less than it originally was. This is because the success of its themes, images, or narrative become so copied that they become clich&eacute;d. Such is the case with CE's opening. Giant spaceships arrive at earth, hover over the major cities of the world & issue ultimata. Is it the film Independence Day? Is it the tv miniseries V? No, but now you know where they got their openings....On a higher level there is the notion that what ACC propunds in this book is sharply contradicted by his own later stated beliefs- such as the tragedy he sees as being the hijacking of morality by organized religion. ACC seems to embrace psi phenomena, as well his repudiation of irrational religion. The original editions of this book featured a disclaimer from ACC stating he did not necessarily endorse the book's views- i.e.- that the irrational is a seductive force that will ultimately save (or doom?) mankind. Despite the seeming happy ending the destruction of homo sapiens, the fact that it was not allowed its natural evolution, simply to appease some super-powerful entity, is not what all would see as a positive. In a sense, the book can be seen as a Cold War fable (1st published in 1953)- a screed against Communism, which offered paradise on earth. The Overmind ends up destroying the planet, yet the reader never really gets a glimpse of what awaits. It could all be a hoax- the Overmind just a psychic predator feasting on the willingly gullible human spirit. Karellan states, `The stars are not for Man.' & by book's end we take it to mean that he meant mankind's disembodied descendants would reach the stars, not man. Yet, there is still the nagging feeling that humanity was flushed down a cosmic storm drain, & the more obvious meaning of Karellan's charge is the most apt.<br /><br />  Yet, ACC suggests that such skepticism is the result of our linear, physical minds- & that is the point of his tale. A final point is that the novel works as both a historical marker, & a still relevant treatise on human nature- whether you buy its premises & conclusions is another matter.rge is the most apt.

B0013WJGJ0|3|On Superman's first major appearance in the original 1979 movie with Christopher Reeve, the &#34;man of steel&#34; saves Lois Lane from plummeting down 900 stories from the top of one of Metropolis' skyscrapers and becoming a human pancake. Lane asks the inevitable question, &#34;Who are you?&#34; Superman's reply is simply &#34;a friend&#34;. That's what Superman would say. He probably would not call himself &#34;Superman&#34; lest to seem too aware of his own super magnificence, and thank god he didn't flex his arms like the ridiculous TV show of the 1950's. Fastforward 10 years. In the film &#34;Batman&#34;, a similar scene occurs at the opening with Batman apprehending some down-trodden baddies. The baddies ask the same question as Lois Lane, but the answer was &#34;I'm Batman&#34;. Almost any other response would have been superior such as &#34;I'm your worst nightmare.&#34;, &#34;You don't need to know my name.&#34;, even &#34;I'm Bozo the killer clown.&#34; But replying &#34;I'm Batman&#34; really was a tip-off that the script still needed serious work, a problem that continues to plague many films produced under the corporate Hollywood system. Having Batman say &#34;I'm Batman&#34; is sort of akin to Dracula saying &#34;I'm the Count!&#34; or worse &#34;I'm a Vampire!&#34; proceeded by a cruel Romanian laugh.<br /><br />The problem with this movie is that it couldn't quite decide if this was going to be Frank Miller's &#34;Dark Knight&#34;, which was more akin to the early 1940's strips by creator Bob Kane, or the campy 1960's show with Adam West climbing up buildings and meeting the likes of Jerry Lewis or Dean Martin on the way up. If it was trying to be like Miller and/or Kane, it wasn't mysterious enough. If it was going to be like West, it wasn't silly enough. Certainly Jack Nicholson as The Joker is the inevitable casting choice, and since Tim Burton was at the helm, it seemed like a movie that was aiming for the dark overtones of a Miller and/or Kane story. However, the mystery surrounding the Joker and Batman wasn't quite there.<br /><br />The main issue is that the movie lacks focus, as if the screenwriters had not quite thought the story through and realized what the themes should be. Miller's &#34;The Dark Returns&#34; may be the best Batman story since Bob Kane, and it certainly is a hard act to follow. Unfortunately, much of the movie is kind of a mess when you see it with a more critical eye. And I never quite felt for the characters in the way I did for the first two Superman movies.<br /><br />Still, if you have never seen this movie, it is definitely worth a viewing. There are definitely some great moments. Kim Basinger as Vicky Vale is outstanding, and her relationship with Batman (and the Joker) is worth the price of admission. (Ever notice how DC comics' leading ladies' names are often alliterations?) And of course, even with a mediocre script, Nicholson as the Joker is a performance not to be missed. He is one of a few actors on the planet that make a sub-par script seem better.story.

030758836X|4|Nick and Amy Dunne were both writers living in New York City, when the economy cost both of them their jobs, and then the couple moved back to Nick's hometown of North Carthage, Missouri, to help care for his dying mother. A born and bred New Yorker, she has to leave her parents, happily married psychologists who created a famous children's book series about Amy called Amazing Amy. The transition is tough for Amy, who doesn't find a job and finds it difficult to make friends, but she is supportive of Nick's buying a bar with his twin sister, Margo (aka \\"Go\\"). And even though their marriage hits occasional rough patches, they are making plans to celebrate their fifth anniversary.<br /><br />That afternoon, Amy disappears, and their home bears signs of a dangerous struggle. Nick cannot figure out what happened to his wife, although his interactions with the police and the media lead people to begin questioning his innocence. And Amy's diary paints an interesting picture of an increasingly difficult relationship. But as the clues mount and the surprises continue to be revealed, there is so much more to this relationship--and Amy's disappearance--than meets the eye. (And that's all I'll say for fear of revealing any crucial plot elements.)<br /><br />Gone Girl has been nearly universally hailed as a fantastic book, the one sure to launch Gillian Flynn's career into the stratosphere. (Her second novel, Sharp Objects was a best-seller.) I enjoyed this, but not nearly as much as others have. I flew through the first 200 pages and I had no idea what to expect, and then when the plot twists began to unfold, I found it more and more difficult to remain invested. It's a challenge to love a book in which many of the characters are so unsympathetic, but Flynn really is a terrific writer. (If you've never read her earlier books, Dark Places and Sharp Objects, they're both unmistakably creepy and well-written.)
B00003CXWV|3|This is a review of the DVD, not the film itself--which has its own set of problems in this fascinating true story delivered in a very inconsistent, flawed fashion. But I digress...on to the DVD. \\"A\\" for concept, \\"D\\" for execution. It's hard to believe that anyone actually reviewed and checked the results before this went into production.<br />Both Video and audio are quite good--a very clean, impressive job that truly makes watching this film enjoyable and worthwhile. <br />It's on the Infinifilm extras where this DVD comes up extremely weak. Though a few are terrific additions--the interview/comments with the real George Jung, for example--others appear to be slap-dash efforts at filling up the disk and giving the impression that there's real quality within. A good example is the so-called \\"Fact Track,\\" which is designed to play as subtitles in the Infinifilm version of the movie. \\"Fact Track?\\" Hah! Loads of typos/spelling errors (heroine instead of heroin in one passage, for example), factual errors (Woodstock Festival--\\"Three Days of Peace and Music\\" as it occurred in 1969--has an extra fourth day added here by the creators of the \\"Fact Track\\"), random \\"Facts\\" that come in places that often demonstrate little rhyme or reason for their location in the film and hop all over the map without any real sense of organization, bio subtitles about some of the cast but not others, a blatantly unbalanced anti War on Drugs message which is rendered so via tons of stats on (what I agree is) the huge waste of federal monies and effort in this regard WITHOUT ANY mention or statistics on the still ongoing devastation wreaked upon our country by cocaine and, by his involvement, George Jung.<br />The Documentary on the effects of cocaine on Colombia is pretty good and important given the lack of mention in the film itself, but at times the people speaking (in Spanish with English subtitles) talk so rapidly that in some spots it's nearly impossible to both follow the dialogue andthe picture without watching again. (Maybe that's the trick! \\"You'll watch it over and over again!\\")<br />The Production Diary--short video excerpts on various random days of the 63-day shoot--includes an excerpt from one day which consists entirely of an audio track that is normal like the rest but accompanied by video which consists entirely of the camera pointed down at the pavement. Intriguing.<br />Last but not least, the Infinifilm feature itself--think VH1's \\"Pop-up Videos\\"--is fabulous in concept but a failure too often in execution to really be worthwhile. Some extras (most deleted or alternate scenes, for example) appear exactly where logical, such as the alternate Intro. Others pop up in places that seem to be entirely random (Ted Demme's filmography, which pops up not with the opening credits, but instead somewhere deep within the film.) Some just don't fit where they are at all in a fashion that leaves one believing that the creators weren't even paying attention (or perhaps had just done some BLOW) when they inserted them (a jump to a spot about Otisville FCI pops up early in the film when George is sent to Danbury FCI instead of at the end when we see him in the Upstate New York slammer.)<br />The most useful and enjoyable part of Infinfilm (an overall concept which has the potential to be phenomenal!) is the ability to see alternate versions of scenes in direct A/B comparison to the ones that made the final cut.<br />Look, I don't HATE this DVD package and did enjoy the film and exploring the disk, but its features are WAY OVER-HYPED and fall short of the sell-job done on them. Unabashed fans of the film will probably love them all regardless of the \\"Facts.\\" Do other Infinifilms have similar problems? This is the first Infifinifilm I've seen.<br />One note about the film and its screenplay. Both contain an error early in the film (in the mid 1960's) when George, Tuna, and his other bud from Mass. are discussing the colleges back in Mass. where they can sell their weed. One school that they mention is Hampshire College, which didn't enroll its first class until 1970. FACT CHECKING, FACT CHECKING. Can't believe no one in production caught that, given the comparatively large number of Hampshire grads who work in the film industry. OK, OK, I'm done....
B00BAXFECK|2|SPOILERS<br />One of the many problems I have with Spielberg’s “Saving Private Ryan” is his assurance that the way to recreate chaos on the screen is to shake the camera a lot; it seems the most literal way of reproducing chaos and the most simplistic. Why not use filmmaking techniques to get across the fear and horror of the moment? Compare it for example with the assault on the grassy hill in Terrence Malick’s “The Thin Red Line” which I found infinitely more tense and horrific because he actually used the quiet of filmmaking to increase the horror. It’s not cartoonish like the Spielberg, the technique doesn’t push you away from the moment, it immerses you into it.<br /><br />I was thinking about this when trying to figure out what I wanted to write about Donna Tartt’s “The Goldfinch.” There’s a lot of admire in the book, but in specific places in the book – the early bombing scene, the long section in Las Vegas, the endless scene where Theo waits in Amsterdam after an act of violence, the long ending philosophical rant about life and love – she manages to create the tedium of these moments and this existence on the page by turning these sections into endless tedious passages. Like SPR, it felt like the most literal way of reproducing tedium, not by referencing it using skillful narrative techniques but by recreating it, forcing us to wade through it endless page after endless page. I’m reminded of Laurence Oliver’s likely apocryphal advice to Dustin Hoffman’s method acting stay up for days and get all filthy machinations in “The Marathon Man” – “Why don’t you just….you know…act?” Which would be my advice to Tartt and the editors she clearly never employed; why not instead of inducing the same tedium in the reader that the character is going through use your skills to represent that tedium on the page.<br /><br />All of which makes the book sound worse than it is; it’s true Tartt is in need of a good editor but it’s equally true she’s capable of amazing and truly lovely passages. And if I don’t exactly believe, for example, the whole central friendship in the book between Theo and Boris, I’m more than willing to go along with it because it’s mostly a fun ride. Still, by the time you’ve slogged through the last quarter of this book, a certain enraged entropy sets in, a sense of helplessness (I kept hearing The Simpson’s Apu’s voice saying “Why don’t you shut up, I can’t believe you won’t shut up.”) It’s not that she uses 10 lines where one tight, lovely one might do, it’s that she uses 20. Or 30. Or 50. Passages in this book go on for so long, lovely stretches with genuine intelligence (though much of the last part of the book seems committed to fleshing out a philosophy that doesn’t seem much beyond “life’s hard and then you die.”) but it doesn’t really matter because you as a reader start some of the despair the main character feels. Not so much an understanding of that despair but the actual feeling. So your main character is existentially doomed and in a funk, does Tartt have to induce the same feelings in the reader? Not awareness of those feelings or of that knowing understanding we get from a great book, but genuine despair of the “when will this thing end” variety?<br /><br />I can’t help but think that Tartt doesn’t fully understand what she’s created. When Theo at the end goes on an extended rant about life and death ad nauseum, I came to realize that I don’t want to hear that from this character. He hasn’t earned that right, which lead to the realization that in the end, I didn’t buy Theo. I enjoyed reading much of his life, but I never really believed him as a living human being or his story as that of a living human being navigating a living, breathing world. He’s all conceit and nods to outrageous plot turns and various human traits and foibles (he loses his mother in an act of terrorism, he steals a famous painting, his father is a drunken gambler and all around jerk, he loves the wrong woman, he snorts heroin, he lies and steals and cheats and even murders, he gets scared and down on himself and wants to do the right thing – good for you, little man, good for you), a mix of elements that never really comes together in a way that makes me care about this guy or his story. By that standard, the book is not only an utter failure, it’s a pernicious one at that.

1878424319|5|&quot;The Four Agreements&quot; by Don Miguel Ruiz is some of the best money I have ever spent.  For such a small book this one could certainly change many more lives that people I'll ever meet in mine.  It breaks  everything all down and lets your soul be your guide.  The four basic  agreements are:<br />1.  Be Impeccable With Your Words.<br />2.  Don't Take  Anything Personally.<br />3.  Don't Make Assumptions.<br />4.  Always Do Your  Best.  <br />You can't break it down much more than that.  These basic goals  and hopes are wonderfully helpful and a path to making ones life a bit  easier.  <br />While, I'm not one for a lot of self-awareness books,  self-help, etc....but, I certainly found this one helpful, honest and  forceful.  It made me take a good look at myself and make some changes in  how I plan to proceed from this day.  If nothing else, give yourself a  chance and read this book.  It might be helpful.

B00005JNJ7|5|Trey Parker and Matt Stone continue to be the funniest people in Hollywood. This movie was absolutely hilarious. Not only was the dialogue classic, but the soundtrack by Trey Parker was absolutely hysterical. I laughed for about 2 minutes straight after \\"America, F*ck yeah\\". The marionettes jerked and moved awkwardly, but I think Trey and Matt did this on purpose, and it made it that much funnier. They've mentioned many times that they loathed working with puppets, and you can tell they took the easy way out many times. I'm all for that, though, it makes it funnier. Someone was wondering why Pres. Bush wasn't in the movie at all. WAKE UP, MAN. They didn't need Bush. He was completely represented by Team America. Anyway, hilarious movie, hilarious soundtrack.  <br />

B00005JNEI|4|The most disturbing thing about this film is the reaction to it, especially by those who refuse to see it and only rely on their partisan support of President Bush as a means of judging it.  Having read extensively about most of the historical material, I really did not see much with which I was not familiar.  I was very grateful to Moore, however, for encapsulating this information into a 2 hour film and presenting it in a form which those unfamiliar with it could easily digest. I would have preferred that the entire film was an examination of the various connections between the Bush family, Arbusto/Harkin, Saudi Arabia, OBL, Halliburton, 9/11, etc.  If you are one of those for whom this information is completely unworthy of being seen because you will never believe there to be any connection (despite painstaking and extensive verification) then you should see the film and be pleasantly surprised that the whole film is NOT about these things.  On the other hand, if you are afraid that the very real words (on tape) of your own candidate will be used against him and his political allies, then do NOT see this film.  You will surely die of shame when you see what kind of unredeemedly inept, heartless and devious person it is that you so fervently support! Conversely, if you think that Iraq was equivalent to Afghanistan in the \\"War on Terror\\" then you will surely enjoy reliving the bombardment of Baghdad and be able to easily overlook the heartache caused to the families of those who have been lost in the war. In fact, you will find that \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" is as All-American as John Ashcroft singing \\"Let the Eagle Soar\\" at the Fourth of July picnic!  You should not be afraid of Michael Moore's documentary!  Any  discomfort or fear you have should actually spring from seeing the words and actions of your own president, as these are what this film is made of.

B00IXF8PLU|5|I've never understood how the German people could have allowed Hitler to rise to power and stay in power.  This movie was from the view of the common man.  I loved it!  Don't watch this movie if all you want is blood and guts.  This movie allows you to think and understand.  Bring your tissue.
B0063M22QO|5|Great way to pass the time when you cannot move around, engaging the mind and a challenge great fun.  Has good color and graphics.
0385537131|5|My husband loved this book. I loved it was a great price and the shipping was so fast!  I ordered several books at the same time and this was the one he read first. He is a John Grisham fan. He recommends this one!
B0016Q2D5M|5|great movie
B0091REZMW|4|I like hidden pictures I don't like them to be so easy that I am bored with game but on the other hand I don't want so hard that I get frustrated or have to use hint button so much that it is ridiculous. This game isjust right
B00E8KLWB4|4|This is one of the better hidden objects games out there. The difficulty works up from basic to quite difficult. There  are brain games like memory match and jewel quest that are included and provide a little break from the the hidden objects. Never redundant. However,it is virtually impossible to play without buying crystals or coins.
B007L96VCY|5|Great
B00JB3MVCW|1|Not what I had hoped it would be. The director took GREAT poetic license on this biblical story. Poorly done in my opinion.
B00FVVR2ZO|3|Takes too long to gain sufficient points to continue, lends towards purchasing hints and power to keep the game going.
B002VPE1WK|4|I purchased this backpack a little over a month ago for my Canon 7d and my 28-135mm lense. I read some reviews complaining about the materials. I think that for the price of $25 this is a very good bag. The only reason I returned it is because when I was about to go out of the country, I found myself having to take another bag for my computer and other items, so I decided to return it to buy the Lowepro Fastpack 250 Camera/Laptop backpack at $25 more in an Amazon flash sale. The Amazon backpack is light, has enough space for your camera and lenses and has straps for chest and waist. Like I said, I used it for a short time, so I cannot accurately talk about its durability, but the straps and the zippers seemed to work OK.
B007ZGO7EM|5|Good app. ;)
B000088E6D|5|Michael Buble is really in touch with his music. You can tell he weally worked out the delivery of these romantic songs. So smooth and refined. If I could sing like that I would ...
055380684X|5|Daniel Coyle does an excellent job of describing the mechanism of skill acquisition and continuous improvement.  How some people become exceptional in the field of their choice has remained a mystery. Daniel Coyle deals with facets of skill development by showing     How the brain responds to practice    What does it mean to find the sweet spot - that is just outside the   comfort zone but realistically reachable.    What ignites and sustains passion   How the effective coaches make a huge difference in the learning.     The implications of this work is far reaching. This is an invaluable guide to teachers and parents who are involved in educating the young ones. The description is so lucid that one can create an effective training regime for any field - may it be sports, arts or science.      Daniel explains the steps involved in skill development with such clarity that one can look back at one's life and interpret the successes and failures in the new light. Such introspection can lead to new insights on the situations in which one is effective.  Even a more profound consequence would be on the way one plans for future and the quality of experience there from.     Overall, the book adds a new dimension to one's worldview and equips one to effectively pursue continuous improvement in the field of choice.
B008NCSZQ8|3|it wasnt my favorite but it was cool. I normally like drama and this was all action.  a solid c
B009MF5BXK|5|i love it
B009ZZDNT6|1|I deleted it right away because it didn't work and was hard to set.
0062255657|3|Like most people into speculative fiction, I f--ing love Neil Gaiman. I was raised on his books and will pass them onto my kids when the time is right. American Gods and Neverwhere are always going to be on my top 20 list because I've comfort-read them since I was in middle school.<br /><br />Many respected reviewers fawned over Ocean and gave it incredible compliments. So insightful! So moving! Taps into your inner child! Such an important commentary on memory!  I was expecting this original work of mind-blowing genius that would hit me like an arrow to the heart (you know, in a good way). Plus, it's been so many years since Gaiman wrote a novel--oh yeah, I was gunning for this. When I saw my dad reading pre-ordered copy, I had to restrain myself from ripping it out of his hands.<br /><br />Well, it fell a little short. As many have noted, it's shockingly slim. It's a short story, ffs. A good one. An entertaining one. But it is not something to eagerly await and then pay $24.99 for. I still f--ing love Neil Gaiman, but come on. After I finished it (in about 4 hours), I felt like I had been taken advantage of by someone I really admire.<br /><br />Gaiman suggested that Oceans began short story for his wife. (Actually, I recommend reading his thoughts about the origin of Oceans because it helped mediate some of my disappointment.) As he wrote, the story got longer and was eventually over 50K words, so he had to call it a novel. I disagree. A novel is more than just a large number of words. When he hit the 50K mark, it just became an awkwardly long short story. A novel, at least one for people over 13, needs at least one secondary plot. I think this is why people have argued that it's really YA fiction. It's much too simple and lacks the layered plot of an adult novel.<br /><br />And no, there is nothing in it too twisted for young adults. People need to give kids a little credit for being able to respond to scary, disturbing stuff as -fiction- without mistaking it for reality. In fact, compared to other YA stuff I've read recently, the subject matter is pretty tame, and none of it will be new to kids. (Unless you -really- believe that they don't realize that grown ups can be cruel or unfaithful or lose control.) I suspect that most of the readers whose undies were in a knot because it's too mature haven't read much YA lately.<br /><br />As usual, Gaiman nails the monsters and supernatural parts. I marveled at his imagination and savored each description. Oceans really is a strong story, and in spite of my complaining, it is absolutely worth reading. Just be aware that it may not live up to your very high expectations.r reality.

B004KA9VGA|5|Really enjoyed these books their really well researched bringing every detail to life. If you love the world of witches and vampires you will love this book.
B008GJV4F2|3|Fun!
B0089LOG02|4|I HAD HEARD ABOUT THE ORPHAN TRAIN BUT NEVER KNEW ANY OF THE DETAILS.<br />THIS BOOK GAVE GREAT INSIGHT INTO THE MANY DIFFERENT SITUATIONS THESE<br /> CHILDREN WERE PUT IN.  iT SHOWED THE MANY FACES OF HUMANITY FROM THE KIND<br />TO THE CRUEL AND THE INNATE COURAGE OF THESE CHILDREN TO SURVIVE.
B00KK0PICK|3|Quirky and useful
B00L9B7IKE|5|Great read! Page turner with a unique perspective!
B00FVVR2ZO|5|This game is so much fun! Every one should try this game. If you are patient you don't have to purchase anything in the game, you win things as the game goes on.
B00957T6X6|5|Great books at a great price.
B00PEVD59I|4|Love this game!!!!
0061703257|3|I enjoyed this book and wanted to read it before I saw the movie.  The book was ok but I had figured out the ending about halfway through. The plot and set up were pretty good.
B007IXWL2C|5|Great book it keeps you on your toes with the suspense and what woman doesn't like the sex scenes. I would definitely recommend that you read the whole series.
B00EOARZ4G|5|I've read most of Clancy's books and in my opinion, this is revealing, riveting, thought provoking and one of those you simply do not want to put down.  Uncanny glimpse of what is going on today in the world with Russia.  His insight is amazing!
B000XUBFE2|5|The writer did a wonderful job bringing the characters to life. I couldn't put this book down! I highly recommend this book.
B00007KWHG|1|After buying several  of the Frankie Valli CD's to get the songs I wanted I found this one... Great songs and just what I have been looking for.. Thank You...MJ  5 stars
B00HHJPUFM|4|Daughter loves this movie
B008NF45S2|1|Could not get to work even though it recognized my printer.
B00F1BFRA6|4|We enjoyed this DVD
B00009MGQL|4|Great record. Improvement over his last effort (&quot;You Had It Coming&quot;) and features several really nice tunes. Will take one star off for the stupid vocal track that appears from time to time...but then, I guess it's silly to complain about vocals when all I listen to on Jeff Beck albums is the guitar anyway.
B00992CF6W|5|This is a great game for kids but found that most grownups (my mom, dad, and aunt) find it gives them really bad headaches if they play for to long.
B000SZK41M|4|Great Series!
B00003CXTF|3|Historically, this may be better than Titanic, but not by much.  While I am pleased to see some of the stories of some of the things about World War II get introduced to a new couple of generations, I know that most of the things involving the lead characters is falsely portrayed and Hollywoodesque.  I did give my students a recommendation to see the movie so that I could use what they saw as a guideline, but I found myself often wishing that I hadn't due to the misperceptions and inaccuracies I saw historically.<br />As entertainment, it may be, but I could not divorce myself from my feelings of annoyance knowing what I saw was not always the true story.
B000KKPN5C|5|Even though this is a smaller flash, the pictures taken with it are great. I have the Nikon SB600, a larger flash. For most situation the result from this flash and the SB600 is the same.  This flash is lighter and more portable so I will be using this more often then the SB600. This flash is so light that I leave the flash on the camera. So I get great pictures more often with this smaller unit than the bigger SB600. I learned that a flash that you can use more often is more important than the size/power of the flash. The best thing about this flash is the bounce feature. You can use flip the flash head 60 to 90 degree. This give you a nice picture with natural light instead of the bright flash. This feature is going to make your picture much nicer than without an external flash. You can never get this kind of picture with the built in flash.
B00II5YUIW|3|Great graphics and a wonderful story but it is way to short for $4.99! 4 hours of game play. If it was $1.99 then that seems fair. I feel gipped :(
B00CWY76CC|5|Great game! Love the suspense of &quot;what comes next&quot;.  Great App! Thanks One of the best apps I've came across lately!
B000BJS4SU|3|I like tracks 2, 4, and 5, the rest I don't care for. Raw honkytonk/blues/jazz/whatever is not what I want to hear from John Mayer. It seems like this is just a self-indulgent thing thrown together for kicks, which I guess is what live albums are supposed to be, but since they're mostly new songs I expected something more. It's been suggested that his last two albums weren't where his passion was, but if he really had this music in him the whole time I can't believe he would have held it back for so long. I guess it's possible that this is an artistic evolution he's been working towards, but I expect and hope that \\"raw blues guy\\" will prove to be just a character he plays on weekends, a minor diversion from his true calling, as a master craftsman of harmonic, melodic, catchy pop songs.  <br />
B003GQM52Q|3|good cast well acted and produce.  A bit too long and left you hanging what he did in final years
B007IXWKUK|5|great reading
B004Y1WCDE|5|Love it! very easy to use and loads of great features. :)
B0011UBDTK|1|Most of the episodes in the seasons 3, 4, and 6 did not play because of damaged CDs. I like the series but disappointed with the shipment.
B00BMT9C84|2|Slow paced plot..some funny lines
B00BSBU4EC|5|I loved it! it was so cute, and a good movie for anyone to watch and enjoy! :) diffidently one i wouldn't mind watching again sometime. :)
B000IEPFCG|5|Ive had this watch two full years now. It keeps great time. Plus or minus about a second a day. It still looks great and makes me feel like a million bucks wearing it. I wear it every day. Not the most expensive. Not for extreme conditions. Though I did go mountain climbing with it once. Simple, light weight, elegant, and a great time keeper. Cheers!<br /><br />Update:  10-20-2015<br />Still love this watch.  Wear it three seasons.  I've got the Seiko Model#: SKX173 200m Divers for swimming weather.  The watch is still accurate to within a second or so a day.  Usually gains time.  No big.  Brought me endless joy and faithful service.  Great little beater.  Get one!
B00005JLT5|5|The Pianist is one of those movies you can watch over and over again with the same feelings each time. It is a movie where everything is interesting because there is a sense of despair and you don't know what will happen.<br />The Pianist basically centers around a man escaping a ghetto. This man, a pianist, travels from house to house in search of a place to hide. The movie has a great pace to it. Just when you start getting bored of a house, a new interesting scene takes place. I've seen this movie several times and it never fails to be breath-taking. <br />The one thing going through my mind is, &quot;Why didn't any of the Jews fight back?&quot; Well, this movie will likely have you wondering what you would do in the pianist's situation. <br />To receive 4 stars from critics a movie has to be either the best picture of the year or extremely good. Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, and The Two Towers both received 3 stars. Terminator 2 recieved 3 stars. I am not surprised to see that The Pianist receieved 4 stars as it is probably one of the best movies of all time.
0988262592|5|Definitely a book any IT Mananger/Project Manager should read. Learning and exploring where the bottlenecks are in the IT department and how to manage to their strengths will help the overall throughput of the team. The story walks through several examples and solutions that could happen to any given IT manager (and definitely to me as a technical project manager).<br />I really couldn't put this down..which is rare.
B00CWY76CC|5|Love the game, but ten floors isn't nearly enough.Give me a skyscraper full and I'll STILL want more( and more)
B000SINT52|1|If this is a documentary on the events of 9/11/2001, then Mickey Mouse is a documentary on mice.  It shows no talent for unbiased truth.  Michael Moore hasn't the talent for objectivity.  This is a movie about politics and Michael Moore, nothing more.  The difference between genius and ego is that ego thinks it's genius, and genius is not egotistical.
0399157565|5|Patricia Cornwell knows what she is writing about.  She does get a bit graphic but I believe it has to be that way in order for the author to keep as authentic as possible.  The Bone Bed was a good read and held my interest throughout.
B00LGT224G|4|Love this for saving recipes
B001I45UFC|4|This story was about four children Peter,Susan,Edmund and lucy.They had to leave their counrty because of air-raids.<br /><br />  This new home was quit grand but they didbt find anything inturesting untill they found then self playing hide and seek Lucy (The mysterouis little girl that she is) whent into a wardrobe and found her self out in the snow.(When theres not many wardrobes with snow in them) she goes back out and shows her siblings at first they didnt believe her,then they really did find out it was true.Narnia had been waiting for them for so long they where or as Narnia called them kings and queens. It may sound greatful and happy intill they bump into someone not so sweet,the witch we cant forget about her.<br /><br /> She cntrolled Narnia well for now and even had some trees and animals on her side,she was very powerful abd cruel but she could never beat the mighty lion.You might ask tho why hasnt he killed her yet?well the lion also needed help with the king,queen,prince and princess this isbt your ordinary book of fairy tales buut I guess you could consider that I never said it is but you have to see for your self<br /><br />Do it for Narnia &#60;(*_*&#60;)
B009SJ3GUK|4|This show sometimes hurts you to watch because of the subject matter.  It's scarry, but more than that it's disturbing and sometimes uncomfortable to set through it, until the next episode comes out.
B003BKF696|3|I know it is already trendy to call this the album of the year, most reviews are stellar, but so far I am slightly dissapointed. I think it is just easy at this point to rave about The National and I am a big fan. There is no question it is a beautifully crafted album, many layers, excellent production, and the lyrics and tone are impressive, but there is also no question that it is mostly boring.     I have no problem with slow songs but they still have to grab you. There is no Soho Riots or Start a War on this album. Those songs have an amazing underlying emotion but also sound great. High Violet has many slow, depressing, songs that just don't pull you in.     It's not enough just to write lyrics and about dark subjects we can all relate to. That is better for poetry. This is music and this album is just a bear to get through.    Vanderlye is entirely overproduced and supposed to create some sort of epic ending but it fails. They tried too hard on that one. Check out Amsterdam by Coldplay(when they were good) on Rush of Blood, for the perfect balance on an epic closer.     Bloodbuzz is one of the best songs of the year, Terrible Love is a great opener, and LemonWorld has some nice hooks but overall this is just too down without anything to hold onto. Where would you ever play this album? By yourself in a dark room if you are contemplating suicide I guess.     I could not play this for any new people to try to convert them and I don't think this will win them any new fans. Then again, that is not the point. National is happy where they are.     I just expected more. I give it tons of credit for craftmanship, musicianship, and effort, no doubt, and I hope it grows on me, but right now there are only a few keepers to me.
B00007LTIA|5|Fantastic, Sounds Great, Booklet contains words to songs. Nice packaging.
B0029O08WA|5|This album is fantastic. I think it is perfect for the book/movie. The songs are slow and sad but that fits, because that is what the book is about, If you are a twilight fan I would buy this album.
B00IMYVCA8|1|Very happy with item and will be enjoyed. Fast delivery too!!!
B00HWWUR1Q|5|great buy
B0063IH60K|5|I really enjoy this game. its very addicting. its hard for me to put it down.  I also like being able to design the background. I play this game a lot.
B0074D3CAQ|5|Every word is like music. There is a pice of every human being in this lovely story. Everyone should read this. Especially those who love to walk, and those who never do.
B0027MJU00|5|I read Gone Girl and loved it. This was the second book I read from her. Wow. Great read. I enjoyed figuring it out. It kept me interested the entire time. The book is a tragedy written right. Her style is both engrossing and entertaining. I recommend her and this book to anyone who wants to read an intelligently written story.
B000TGCR38|5|I have a movie library of over 500 titles and this is among the top 10. This is one of the few movies I don't mind reading subtitles. Easy to follow and read subtitles. DVD quality was superb. Strongly recommend this.
B004ZMWUCU|5|Beautifully written story that has wonderfully developed characters. Full of Irish charm, wit, and emotions. It was a pleasure to read something that was not inundated with graphic sex scenes. My mother grew up in Belfast and some of the expressions bring back long-lost memories for me. I highly recommend this book.
B00KK0PICK|5|It hasn't exactly changed my life, but I have made some drastic changes because of this book. I started with clothes and gave away 100 pounds! I'm still working my way through my clutter, but the method is proving very beneficial even though I'm not following it exactly.
6300216748|5|This movie is very very good. It has a very interesting premise. Redford is a CIA analyst who reads. He reads everything in print looking for codes or messages. He unwittingly uncovers and becomes a part of a conspiracy that he has to try to decipher while trying to stay alive. GREAT FLICK! Faye Dunaway, Cliff Robertson, and Max von Sydow are great!
B0065GC0BA|4|Enjoyed the book , last 100 pages so sensitively wrote
B0032CVAQQ|5|I was recommended this book by a couple married 30 years.  It opens your eyes to what is important not to you but your partner.  After all there is a reason why your together.
B00FAPF5U0|5|Love it!!!
B006M4RN3U|5|Every track is a winner. It's uplifting and fun and great music to drive to! This is band is new to the scene (this is their first album) and I look forward to more music from them!
B0058UXHHK|4|I really enjoyed Twenty eight and a half Wishes. It was just plain fun, although I did have some issues with it. It was mostly a light and hilarious read, so when the emotional bits came, I was surprised at the power of it. I loved the heroine, Rose, and her growth throughout the book. She had no trouble saying what she thought, and I was so proud of her I wanted to clap.<br /><br />&#34;Rose, are you alright?&#34; His voice softened.<br />It made me cry even harder.<br />&#34;No.&#34;<br /><br />Can't express how awesome this was. I can't tell you how many times the heroine says &#34;I'm fine&#34;, &#34;I'll be ok&#34; when they're usually not. This was refreshing to read.<br /><br />I loved Joe, except when he gets friggin mood swings. It gets explained why he does this later on, but the way he completely shuts off Rose sometimes frustrated me. He also can't seem to find the right words when they have a fight and says &#34;Let me explain&#34;, but he never does while they fight, he's too slow and keeps letting Rose get away. -_-<br />- However, Rose isn't afraid to back down or hesitate to give her own sweet revenge, so this did not bother me much. And for the first time, her dating another guy at some point in the book (which usually sends me the indecisive/fickle heroine signals) made me so happy!<br /><br />Since book 3 has scared me*, I will probably only read stand alone books from this author, if she has any, because I really love how she paced the romantic development. This one was such a solid read, and best of all, it was free. I recommend it to anyone looking for a light-hearted read, with mystery and romance thrown in the mix :)<br /><br />-----<br /><br />* I have read a book 3 spoiler which made me really sad and decide not to emotionally invest myself further in the series
B00LDNE3FG|5|Once you pick this up you will play for hours on end So addicting great game I Defiantly recommend this game to anyone.
B00IG2DOKM|4|I love this game but it is not working it won't load
B003SHYVO8|5|entertaining and funny with awesome dancing. Take it at face value, but great for a night at the movies! Watch it!
B009ZQC7MY|5|My brother told me about the show. So I watched all 3 seasons in 4 days. I was hooked after the first show! Love the show.  Thanks Kelly
B00CNQ7HAU|3|Not as exciting as &#34;vintage&#34; Grisham novels.  A little predictable and lacking the plot twists and/or challenges that make Grisham novels a page-turner.
B002DOSBMK|5|Amazing book Salvatore is a Genious and will instantly grasp your attention and love when you read this book all you will want to do is continue with the series. Highly recommended!
B00TJ67YUK|5|Good song
B002QE3CTY|5|Very depressing concept. But at the same time, with so little background there isn't much of a world to be sad about missing. Story is well told and quite enjoyable.
B002ONV5E6|5|Great ending to the Bourne series with Matt Damon.  You will enjoy this movie if you enjoyed the first two movies.
B0011Z5CV0|4|Fun product with very nice musical sounds. Being musical, I enjoy playing songs for my little one on the elephants nose. However, I wish it would sit up on it's own better as advertised. Hope my child can play with it more on his own once he's older. For now he loves to listen to the songs and stare at the brightly colored fabric and big eyes.
B000LXHK2C|3|Somewhere in the South of France, in a time not too distant from the present (in this film based on a book by Peter Mayle), an orphaned English lad (spiritedly portrayed by Freddie Highmore)and his wine-growing Uncle Henry(Albert Finney)share a special time at Henry's rustic cottage. It is here where young Max Skinner is given life lessons from  his Uncle, and he thrives in this environment.   Years later, we see a grown-up Max(Russell Crowe), a cold and ruthless stock market trader with an aggressive employee(Rafe Spall) trying to take his place, an elegantly comical secretary of Indian extraction named Gemma(Archie Panjabi), and a James-Bond-like wittiness and sophistication.    On the day Max Skinner becomes the toast of the London Stock Exchange, he receives word of Henry's death.    We are given glimpses of Max's life when he dines at a local restaurant--the women he's scored with, and the friend and advisor Charlie Willis(Tom Hollander) who wonders why he is less contemplative of Henry's loss, and more focused on his stock market victory.   Soon, he is off to France to return to the estate, La Siroque, for the first time since childhood with the intention of selling the property and hurrying back to London. But fate will soon intervene in unexpected ways.   Throughout the film, there are flashbacks of Max's time with his uncle, which will provide insight about the man Max is to become.   He proves to be a rather tempestuous guest in someone else's country, taunting the Tour de France trainees by whom he drives past by hollering Lance Armstrong's name as he gives them an obscene gesture.   He finds the property to be dilapidated, and the wine undrinkable, but schemes with Charlie to make the property appear marketable.   There are amusing scenes of Gemma paging her boss on his blackberry to his annoyance, and Crowe shows a little talent for physical comedy when a local waitress with the apt name of Fanny Chenal(Marion Cotillard), settles a score with him after he runs her off the road while she is on her bicycle.   But there is nothing in this alleged comedy that makes one laugh out loud. The puns are merely eyebrow cocking and smirk provoking, and I felt there was something about Max's being zapped in the pool scene that was a bit too contrived.   There are scenes of Max trying on his uncle's clothes, leading at one point to the obligatory cinematographic exploitation of the power and beauty of Crowe's glowing and fabulously rippling biceps.   The resident vigneron, Francis Duflot(Didion Bourdon), whom Max has known since childhood, is dismayed by Max's decision to sell La Siroque, and has periodic hostile confrontations with him. Duflot's sunny, effervescent wife, Ludivine (Isabelle Candelier) serves as housekeeper, cook, and scorpion exterminator, and cannot hide her enthusiasm in seeing Max again. One moment I found particularly intriguing was the scene of her dancing to Henry's vinyl record featuring the song, \\"Wedding Samba\\" because my mother has played this tune frequently on the piano. The inclusion of this song in the film has been a pleasant surprise.   Amid the lovliness of the French countryside, a new issue arises. A young Californian woman named Christie Roberts (Abbie Cornish) arrives at the estate claiming to be the out-of-wedlock daughter Henry never met.   The spitefully competitive Max tries to find a legal way to discredit Christie and her claim to the estate, and even ruins a lovely evening dinner at the Duflots with his inebriated announcement of his suspicions.But a poignant scene emerges when Max expresses regret over never telling Henry he had loved him. The dewy look flooding Crowe's aquamarine eyes at that moment says it all.   Back in London, suspension over illegal trading prolongs Max's time away from his job, and makes it a little easier for him to make some crucial life-altering decisions as he pursues Fanny.   The plot line is fairly predictable, featuring the fulfillment of Max's desirefor a tumble in the sack with Fanny, and the scene of his meeting with his boss, Sir Nigel (Kenneth Crahan), and the flashback of Max's childhood encounter with young Fanny(an already stunningly exotic Marine Casto, in a moment that ultimately proves the adage, \\"A man chases a girl until she catches him\\")help tie the story together. Max finds evidence to corroborate Christie's claim, and he pursues the things and people that he has learned to value most after nearly losing them. While Charlie Willis predicts Max's eventually becoming bored with life at the estate, the Provence sun shines favorably on our hero as we bid him au revoir.
B000007R0S|5|If you have not heard the DTS encoded CD - Hell Freezes Over - by the Eagles, then you need to treat yourself to this acoustic gem.  The DTS encoded soundtracks \\"pop\\" with realism.   The voices and instrumentation are beautifully balanced throughout the 5.1 speaker system.  Once you have listened to this DTS CD, you will not want to listen to the \\"regular\\" CD anymore.  A treat, a gem, a wonderful acoustic experience.  You will not regret this purchase.
B000YA9R3C|5|Keep in mind dear readers, that this is ENTERTAINMENT! If you go into a film expecting some life-altering experience everytime you are bound to be disappointed. By viewing \\"There Will Be Blood\\" for what it is, a brilliant and wildly entertaining piece of filmmaking anchored by 3 masterful performances, you can come away satisfied that you got your money's worth and with a new admiration and respect for the director. That's it. Daniel Day-Lewis is so great and has been for so long that we almost take him for granted now. The man is a genius. Paul Dano perfectly balances lust, innocence and evil in his role as Eli Sunday and provides the film with it's most humorous moments. The final scene in the bowling alley had a decidedly \\"Kubrick-ian\\" feel to it and is an ideal summation of all this films ideas and ideals, not to mention the terrific way it (literally) bludgeons home the meaning of the title! Don't miss it.
B003XF1XOQ|2|I had such great expectations for the final book of the Hunger Games series.  After being greatly satisfied with Hunger Games and Catching Fire, I was really excited to read a grand conclusion to this trilogy.  I was sadly disappointed.  It seemed rushed as if the author was just interested in getting it over with as soon as possible.  The ending was terrible!  What happened to Gale?  There was a huge disconnect between how Katniss' feelings changed so drastically, and so fast for Peeta.  Ugh!  I would have appreciated if the author would have expounded on how Katniss makes her decision so we could follow rather than being forced to accept something that didn't seem natural.  The only hope left is if some of these misses are corrected in the film version.
B000QK7YQ2|4|On Any Sunday still holds true after coming out over forty years ago. This is the only documentary that covers all forms of off-road motorcycle riding in one film.  The bikes are classic, the riders are the best the sport had to offer in the early seventies, including one famous guy named Steve McQueen.  As a modern day motocross rider, I am a bit envious that i wasn't around during that time period in Southern California.  With virtually no regulations and tens of thousands of acres of available open space, this was truly the prime time to be a motocross or off road rider.  On Any Sunday does an excellent job highlighting the racers and the skill required in each unique event.  The stars of the movie are Mert Lawill, Malcolm Smith, and Steve McQueen.  Malcolm Smith was the top rider in a variety of different riding disciplines and the movie makes you jealous of his amazing skill.  Steve McQueen was one of the best amateur racers of his time when he wasn't starring in his own movies.  You could be lining up to your local race in San Diego on a Sunday in 1970 and Steve McQueen could be the guy right next to you in the gate.  Mert Lawill owned the dirt track championships of the late 60's and into the 70's.<br /><br />If your a fan of off road motorcycles this is a must see movie.<br /><br />The only downside is that the streaming quality is far from the HD we are all use to, but its hardly distracting once you get into the film.
B000O8OTNC|5|Great gadget for sharpening your pocket knife out in the field. Can't go wrong with this simple design. It works great!
B00AESN8XY|5|Skeptical at first, but this is the best game I've ever downloaded, hours and hours of fun, recommending it to all my friends.

B0089LOG02|5|Orphaned and unwanted children put on trains and given to anyone who would take them for whatever purpose.  Right here in America!  This in the time before Social Services when children (and women) were chattels.  This insightful story is about much more than the horrors of such a system and is totally engrossing and entertaining.  Enjoy.
B002ZG975Q|4|Fun modern day rendition of a classic tale.
B005IQZB14|4|Pulls you in from the very first lines. Read it at a time in my life when I was going through my own quest to vanquish trauma and fear, and found her journey inspirational. Thoroughly fun read.
B005K17RU0|5|always right on the weather for my area.
B000W91RUG|1|The humor in this show is that of two and 1/2 man ; yet again another huge show with corny everybody loves raymond lines. I am shocked on why people think this is good. Horrible actors and cheesy lines the entire show. Im sure when I'm 48 and dont go outside i'll like this show but im not! Please save your money and time if your a How I met your mother fan because this show falls extreme short of good.
0345451325|5|This is one of the best books I've read in a long time (if not the best) and I usually dont like to read. The Fall of Reach has a great storyline leading up to the game and it couldnt have been done any better. This book is a must for everyone who owns the game to learn how everything came into place, or is great for anyone that likes science fiction/action. Halo's story is definitly the best I've ever seen in a game and this book makes it allot clearer and better.
B00DPM7TIG|4|Excellent  writing.  The story was difficult to read just because it is so well written.  You feel like these were real people.
B003A4IFDW|3|but she needs a band. She doesn't have one on this album. Hopefully she'll do another with a better band.
B00N1HONIO|5|This game was very fun I love Scott's work on this game! The only thing that made me mad was on the 3rd night Bonnie and Chica were still there peering through the window and door. They made me lose all my power! But luckily I beat it on the second try. They HARDLY even moved. Foxy is my FAVORITE he is so quick when he runs down the hall! I sometimes forget to check on him. Chica I at first I didn't know her name so I called her Moky idk I thought it might've looked like that. Bonnie's jumpscare glitches up on me it didn't even show him. Chica was on stage Foxy wasn't even looking out of his curtain and plus it was night 2. I think my game crashed to Scott if you read this is it a glitch? By the way AWESOME game keep up the good work! Can't wait for FNAF3!!
B002XZNHG4|3|Hey, it's a funny, witty accurate portrayal of human behavior, and for the very same reason, extremely depressing.
B0072OFM28|5|GREAT SELLER, INCREDIBLE PRODUCT, SUPER QUALITY.
B00BAXFAOW|3|The book had some thought provoking aspects, but wasn't nearly as strong as Blink or The Tipping Point.  Would recommend reading those first/instead.
B000065V3H|5|This is a good product and just as described. It is very good quality and I would recommend you to all.
B002UZCJ8Y|5|Giving it 5 starts, to balance all the negative ratings.  I thought this was a very entertaining movie, with some awesome special effects and stunts.  Had a good story/polt.  Yeah, it is all science fiction, and hard to believe, but it is a Movie!  For entertainment.  Highly recommend for a good evening os escapement and wanting of a good action flick.
B00BMTX2HG|5|I'm a really huge fan of Finnish rock and metal, and these band is for sure one of the best acts nowadays fron Europe, the album and the way it is presented here are just too cool.
B005ZOBNOI|5|It is an amazing book. I loved it!!!!! The story was amazing and the writing was really good!! Such a great book!!!!
0679720200|5|This book opend my eyes to other peoples ways of showing emotions and their troubles in life. The main character is a Arab named Monisuer Mersault. He does not show his emtions with his face or actions he keeps them inside. At the begging his maman dies. Later as the book evolves he finds a girlfriend and on a weekend trip with her he murders another Arab. He had been getting in with the wrong group of people. When he murderd the person he was feeling threatend by a group of Arabs with knifes. Mersault felt like it was the only thing he could do to save his life. While on jail trial they used the fact that he does not feel emtions and did not mourn at his mothers funeral against him. He was proven guilty and to find out his punishment you have to read the book!
B001VIMCW4|3|The reason I titled this review Quantum of Sleepiness is that even though I watched it 2 weeks ago I am having trouble remembering much about it.  No, I'm not suffering from dementia or consciousness altering substance use.  Its just that in the normal topography of life, this movie did not make much of an impact... I'll tell you what is bleeding trough my memory, though, slowly... On general James Bondness I'll give it a 4.5-it did satisfy the general urge to have a wounded, arrogant, cute, smokin' hot insanely sneaky-capable badass good guy fix- that much I can tell you.. And there were a few choice scenes with Dame Judy Dench as M.... And there was this bad guy who had a great sinister creepy vibe about him, in a French way... Oh yeah, that's right there was a modicum of emotional release/possibly forgiveness/letting go at the denouement that briefly garnered my interest.. Beyond that, not too much impact.  Oh wait, there was a naked woman covered in oil, it's flashing back on me now. There you have it- if you need a no brainer JB film that won't tax you too much on any front but will give some wan degree of nostalgic comfort via images of our favorite british action figure, see it!
B003ZSJ212|2|Star Wars was the first movie I ever saw in the theater, mind you I am only 21 so it was the re-release version and it was great. I absolutely love the original trilogy, and I love the other three as well but in a laughable kind of way. I have not purchased this blue-ray set do to the good reviews so many have posted. It's upsetting to take the laughable sensation of the prequels and add it to the amazing films that we all really enjoy. When I saw episode 3 I witnessed people crying at the end when Anakin becomes Darth Vader and Padme dies...As I'm laughing my a** off because of \\"NOOOOOOOOOOO!\\" And if they truly added that to RotJ...this series has fallen to the DARKSIDE!
B004EBZX6W|1|This app appears like it is providing useful information, however does not provide actual live connection information. Try turning your router off, this app continues to give the connected info even varies a bit ti make you think its reading, reporting actual data.
B00FB13Y74|4|my boys think this is a fun game! It's kind of confusing how you run out of power or other items, aside from that it's a great game
B0044C3RB4|5|Thoroughly enjoyable.  Well worth my Prime membership.  Looking forward to season 4 next.<br />Special effects are well done and virtually flawless.
B000FZETIO|5|Great classic John Hughes film.  Loved the memories of the day and my kids enjoyed it too. Well worth the money
B0072OFM28|2|The first season and the prequel were great. Vengeance was weak.  The character of Spartacus was poorly cast, and it didn't help having the storyline they wrote for him.  The guy's all of a sudden changed to a politician, giving speeches every episode to a disorganized horde to stop them from destroying each other, followed by, \\"Yeeeaaaahhhh!!!\\"  Lots of times the story gets goofy and unbelievable.  The new Naevia isn't good either.<br /><br />The thing that made Spartacus work before was Batiatus.  Without him, and combined with the loss of Andy Whitfield, it's just over.  I understand that if the story were to continue any further, the story of the ludus and the arena needed to end.  But the current cast of characters, without a great lead actor or two, and the lack of good writing to make up for it has ruined the show.  And with the people who were killed off at the end of Vengeance, it makes the next and final season seem like there's absolutely no hope for an ending worth watching.
B004XJRQUQ|3|first was fascinating a great idea kept you on the edge. Secound was interesting and not as expected but the third was boring like any trilogy writer struggles and over do the story and forget the message or the purpose of the whole story .Still one starts reading book one and wants to keep on reading and then struggles to forget it. Not a great read but okay.
B003VANOFY|1|This headset is amazing, good surround sound, programmable buttons, good microphone, good quality build, and blocks out sound very well.<br /><br />But it won't stay connected to the USB receiver, the headset communicates on one of the most common wireless frequencies to date, and gets easily disconnected when you have so much as your phone, router, or even garage door opener on. And if it doesn't disconnect, the audio gets crackly, and you can't understand anything coming from them.<br /><br />This headset is cool, but the fact you can't connect reliably with a computer 100% of the the because they built it that way means it's not worth the money.<br /><br />Don't bother with this headset, Logitech has contacted me twice in the past two weeks and they haven't given me solutions to this massive flaw, and just keep sending me troubleshoot 101.
B00F9A903O|5|Having fun with this game, however if you don't pay it will take you longer. I'm fine with the time it will take to gather what's needed and besides the money spent (I did once) goes faster than it should, so don't waste it!  :)
B0007Z4S4C|5|Stuck in the past? Don't bother. This is an album by Robert Plant and the Strange Sensation. There are 6 talented musicians involved and it is a good thing. I bought my first Zep album in 1970, but I have since tossed the lavalite and damned if I can find my mood ring.<br /><br />This album is absolutely brilliant. Great work guys, thank you for it. I'll see you 7/15. You'll know me , I'll be the fat middle aged guy with graying hair wearing the Stewie 'you suck' t-shirt. Hmmm, upon further consideration good luck picking me out.
B00K7C17QW|5|I LOVE this game. The scenes are so much fun and the murders are so realistic. Not like graphic, but like they all could happen in real life. I would give this app 7 stars. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys mysteries.
B004Y5AV4M|5|If you don't know Georgette Heyer, you are missing an incredible author. Superb character development, conversations and Regency detail.
B00007ELEL|5|Great movie which already has some world-famous quotes in it! \\"Where's ze money Lebowski\\", \\"Give us the money or we will cut off your Johnsson\\", \\"That's right man, nobody f.x with the Jesus\\". Great acting by Jeff Bridges and John Torturro. Had to see the movie several times to get all(?) the funny little details. Many fan-sites were erected over this movie!
B00IG2DOKM|5|Very fun and entertaining adventure.  Love sharing it with my granddaughter.  Presents one with as great a challenge as you desire.  Hours of fun.
B007HO392S|5|I bought this album for my parents. They love Carrie Underwood since her days on American Idol. I've listen to the album and it is really good. I recommend this to anyone.
1451648537|5|I didn't want to like this book, because I reject needlessly abrasive management styles. But the first computer I ever programmed on (in good old Basic language) was a brand new black & green-screen Apple IIe in about 1983.  I immensely enjoyed learning the backstory to the long series of products that have touched the lives of so many of us.  Some highlights: details surrounding the iPod and iPhone, building the Next Computer (a very gorgeous machine that I played on once for about 3 hours), the Mac and Toy Story.<br /><br />There is a lot to learn from Jobs and a lot of it is here. I just hope we have not spawned a whole generation of tyrannical jerks who think they are mini-Steves.  He was able to succeed with huge reserves of talent, energy and luck - he won in spite of his flaws, not because of them.
B000005JA8|5|What can I say?  It's Captain Beefheart at his Beefheartiest.  It's important to own this album, even if you never listen to it.<br /><br />The 5 star rating system is irrelevant -- how can it be applied to something from another dimension?
1594633665|5|I loved this book!
B007REV4T8|4|hope Craig keeps making Bond movies I think he is perfect..I need to get into Bond movies more i was little confused what bond came first I bought it so i can watch it again and again..I'm BIG Omega fan...
B00BD99JMW|5|One of the best series I have read! I could not put these books down! I was a little disappointed with the ending but that is life. If you like The Hunger Games this is a must read!!!
B00FAPF5U0|3|Too restricted for a &#34;free&#34; app. Few minutes of play, then blocked.  Makes me apprehensive about paying for games. New to games and can't get a good &#34;feel&#34; about them like this.
B0054JZC6E|5|I what was a great game it is a super fun hard game I liked it a lot you would too
B00005OM4N|5|&quot;All you people look at me like am a little girl.&quot; is what the reigning Queen of Pop sings in the beginning of the smash I'm a Slave 4 U. This song Written by the NEPTUNES shows Britney at her best. She went from the little girl in the school outfit to the club loving girl. This CD  is the best out of them all. Yes I'm a HUGE Britney Fan.  These songs at first listen are a little weird but after the 2nd time they ROCK. The stand out tracks on the album are: Slave, Overprotected,Not A Girl(from her movie CROSSROADS which looks amazing), Boys, Cinderella, That's where you take me.<br />Give Britney A Chance, even if U think she dresses not the greatest doesn't give u  the right to think Brit can sing. She can and she'll be still having Number ones when the others are trying to get other labels to release them.<br />BRITNEY: A++++++++- BEST CD OF 2001!!!!!<br />like that!
B000MRAAJM|5|This series is one the best series ever made, especially in full HD 1080p/24Hz. The picture quality is amazing. Only one drawback: the making of documentaries are missing from this release.
B00O3UBB1U|5|Got this around Christmas and haven't stopped playing it yet. It's not as good as Back In Black or Highway To Hell but it's much better than Black Ice. I wish I was seeing them in concert this summer!
B00BUCXVPI|4|Worth watching. Cruise does a good job of being smart, tough but gentle, Jack Reacher. I enjoyed it. And Jai Courtney is an easy on the eyes vicious villian.
0920236251|5|SPOILER ALERT!<br /><br />I have to admit that I bought 6 copies of this, even though I already owned two.  I love this story!  It is sweet and the opposite of what a &#34;fairytale&#34; would normally be.  The Princess is the heroine and gives the kids fits of giggles.  That leads to the other reason I love the book.  I have daughters under the age of 10 who love this book just because of the story.  I also have teenagers who have had a love life go down in flames due to men like Ronald.  If any of my teen daughters have a friend going through heartbreak, I usually con them into reading this story to my little girls.  On the last page I write a note.  &#34;I hope you never meet another Prince Ronald.&#34;  Then I order a few more copies.  This particular edition is small and can be slipped in a jeans pocket.  It has fun pictures and it's VERY portable!.  I give a copy to any of the teens who need a good laugh.
B009XIXVU6|5|love his ability to tell a story and make you feel that you are a part of it.  The descripyion of life In Afghanistan made me feel like I was there.
B000P0J0AG|3|DVD picture quality is horrible when compared to other movies of that decade. I found it difficult to follow the plot.
B008JFUPK8|5|I'm surprised any movie could live up to the hype this one had, but in my view, if not 43% of the critics, Man of Steel did it. Critics are complaining for the exact reason I love it. Unlike lighter toned, past films, this story was pretty serious almost from beginning to end, realistically reacting to grave dangers on both Krypton and Earth. It also takes a more realistic (PG13) approach to the death and destruction caused when opposing, massively powered Kryptonians wage war among us puny humans. Mankind is completely powerless in the epic scale of this threat and only Superman stands between us and annihilation. I'm guessing about 45 minutes of the movie was filled with action and apparently that was too much for some critics. Considering the quality of the origin story and the lead up, it felt appropriate to me. $250 million buys some of the best special effects I've seen, a perfect cast, and the best soundtrack (Hans Zimmer) I've heard in decades, but the story and directing always come first. Well, Zack Snyder finally made a great movie, setting a new bar for a more serious genera of superhero movies which I don't see being topped anytime soon. 10 out of 10, movie of the year and my new favorite superhero movie of all time.
630469654X|5|This movie shows the meaning of true love that was meant to be. They would have waited the rest of their lives just to see eachother one more time.
B00BAXFECK|4|Beautifully written, but sometimes too much of a good thing leads to the Law of Diminishing Returns.
B003PGNBO8|4|I learned 3/4 into the season that ABC was not going to renew Flash Forward for a second season. After eventually calming myself, I came to terms with it. I would buy the solo season, and think of it as a 22 hour mini series. However, I finally watched it in its entirety. I expected closer, since it was ending. Wrong-o. It ends as there is going to be another season. Not one question was answered, you have no idea what happens with the characters. Maybe if someone would write a fake ending for me I would be okay. Like JK Rowling did for Harry Potter. However, the show itself was AMAZING.
B0030V0PEW|3|It seems to me that the use of checklists has been going on in business for quite a long while, along with the idea of team work and total quality management. I think that the primary interest in this book would come from the medical community, but for someone who is used to these theories of management, it's nothing new.
1416911049|5|I loved this book! I couldn't put it down for the life of me.  This book is about a girl name Tally. She has been an ugly all her life but her 16 birthday is coming up. You see, at 16 uglies forgo a plastic surgery that makes them into pretties. But Tally decides she doesn't want to be pretty and runs away to The Smoke. Here she gets entangled in a conspiracy to keep people like Tally quiet about wrongs that are being committed.  All in all this is the greatest scifi book I've ever read.  If your a Lois Lowry fan, this book is for you.
B005HSL626|3|Overall I like this game. It's very well done with excellent graphics. For me, it does get boring after about 20 minutes, but it's still fun again after you take a break. The only reason I give this three stars is because but the fruit does not contrast with the background enough for this game to be playable in direct sunlight. Also, a friend of mine whose colorblind has issues seeing the coconuts at all. They need to have a white background option for sunny conditions and the colorblind. If they would implement a white background for these reasons, I'd give it 4 stars. Overall good game.
B00B0LPYXG|5|Denzel is one of my favorite actors.  The most captivating scene took place in the hospital stairwell. The plot of the movie was emotional and had a pleasant ending.
B001UV4XJ2|1|We do most, if not all, of our movie watching through our AppleTV.  When I do buy a BluRay, it has to come with the Digital Download option or we're just not interested.  When I preordered Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part Two, I'd never heard of \\"Ultraviolet\\".  I made the mistake of assuming it worked the way, well, every other Digital Copy of a movie had ever worked for me; pop the disk in the drive, enter the code and download your movie into iTunes.  Nope.  Ultraviolet requires you to download a program from Flickster (and Adobe Air if you don't have it installed) AND create an account on the site.  Only once you've done this can you download your movie -- into their special application.  Want to open that download in iTunes and play it on your AppleTV?  Nope.  Sorry.  Not happening.  What you CAN do is submit a help request at Ultraviolet's web-site.  Give them the Redemption Code from your case and they will send you a code to download the movie from iTunes.  For me this took about ten minutes and while the customer service is good, it's completely unnecessary.  Until I learn Warner Bros. has changed how they're dealing with digital copies, I'm just going to buy directly through iTunes.  I suggest you do the same.
B004J4WL50|4|I was genuinely interested in the Tom's story and this book does a great job of telling it from the inside out.<br /><br />I found it to be an inspiring and well-written narrative of how the company went from idea, to start-up to iconic shoe company.<br /><br />It did not come off as preachy and was very practical in terms of characterizing the type of entrepenurial (sp?) spirit and tenacity necessary to stay motivated, and more importantly, motivate staff.<br /><br />Only thing that left me wanting more was the description of other &#34;One-for-One&#34; success stories -- but hey -- thats what Google is for.
B007SGM084|4|This is a great trilogy.  I could not put it down until I was done. You will love this set of books.
B000065U1N|5|Ridley Scott's Graphic War Film Black Hawk Down is a masterpiece on every level of film making. It intorduces its charcters well even theo we don't know much about them. We feel what they half to go through in the film. What I liked most about the film is that it shows the level of cauos that war is. When something goes wrong these charcters act like real people would they act scared,afride,and nervous. You mite not know these charcters well enough. But you no them enough to feel for them when they get hurt or killed. This movie is based on true events. A word of Warning the violence in this movie is extremely graphic and prolonged and is not for the faint at heart. In one prolonged scene a soilder is wouded and the other soilders must operate on him or he will die. The camara lingers on the wound as blood gushes out of the wound we as a movie audience must witness this for awhile it last saverel minutes and that is just one scene. this is by far one of the best war film's I have seen It is a masterpiece. But again this is not a movie for people with weak stomic's.
B002ZCY7PU|5|Love Chuck. One of the most underrated tv shows that was continually saved by fan support. Slowly but surely buying the whole show.
0393057658|5|To anyone who has wondered why Oakland GM Billy Beane seems to perform miracles, or more importantly, anyone who truly values statistics and logic over Sportscenter highlights, this book is for you.  To anyone who thinks the regular season shows true talent, while the playoffs are a crapshoot, this book is for you.<br />This book chronicles the Oakland A's in three aspects -  Billy Beane's own personal history and style, his scientific and more accurate view on recruiting and trading, and the lives of a few A's players themselves.   He also delves into the history and explanation of Sabrmatrics, the relatively new and better way of looking at baseball statistics.<br />Billy Beane's philosophy is based on high base percentage, good pitching statistics, and disregards speed, power, arm-strength, or any other characteristic that the typical recruits look for.  While other teams only concentrates on potential and tools, Billy exploits this inefficiency and year after years constructs a great baseball team.  Instead of game, he approaches it as if it was market, and reacts accordingly.  Lewis does a great job expanding on this and paints Billy Beane as a man who can think outside the box.<br />The most intriguing part is when Lewis chronicles the A's draft.   He follows them through this ordeal, and details the strategy of drafting and signing those players.<br />After reading this quick book, I can now say I'm Billy Beane fan.  I  cannot help but respect Billy Beane and the other statisticians that have revolutionized baseball.  With all the insight and thought presented, it has helped me appreciate baseball as truly the greatest sport of them all.

B00794ML3Y|5|Looking forward to Season Two. Great writing and acting.
1407115561|5|My toddler loves this book and so do I. It's wonderful for so many reasons: The colorful, beautiful illustrations, the original and engaging story line and an inspiring but subtle message about breaking out of traditional gender roles (the princess wants to be a doctor, not prance around in a frilly dress). It's also written in rhyming verse, so it's fun to read aloud and pleasing to listen to.
B004SIP7AS|5|You can't go wrong with the combination of a Jane Austen favourite and Gwyneth Paltrow as Emma.
0394826817|5|I bought this book for my Granddaughter whom does not have it yet. I did read it and it has excellent ways to teach children.
B0017XD3OY|3|Post-apocalyptic option. One o many. Will Smith is ok. Just don't ask him about plot holes. Mike Patton makes great monster noises (with the help of effects devices of course).
B003VVFGWC|5|LOVE THIS SHOW! I am late to the party with this show, now I'm binge watching on Amazon Prime. What an awesome show!
B00B78AIV0|5|An excellent, heartfelt story written with such detail one actually feels and sees all she writes!  I would reccommend  this to everyone.who enjoys good reading!
B00G6S8P5C|1|This is version 1.1, while the Google Play store has the current version 2.3.1. How lame is that? Amazon app store has become the wasteland of outdated and unsupported apps
0783228457|2|Confusing, silly and boring at times. Not that good.
B0088ZSKOC|5|It really put me in a calm mode, so that I can relax and fall asleep. Andrew Johnson has great soothing voice and this is not the first time I purchased or receive a free app from his corporation.
B00L9B7IKE|5|A great plot, fast read and a surprise ending.
B00A8MGIZG|5|The ideas:<br />First - we are all connected with each other - not only in our present time,<br />but ever since the long, long ago past times and centuries, as well as in<br />coming future times.<br />Second - already during the long ago past, we created the pathways for our<br />present lives and the surroundings/circumstances we are living in, and we<br />keep creating the parameters for our future to come.<br />Third - Death is but a transition from one incarnation to the next.<br /><br />These are the basic ideas which keep unfolding through the lives of six<br />protagonists who live in different times. Different people, different ways<br />of live - but still they are connected with each other through their acts<br />and decisions, by which they keep influencing not only their very own life<br />and people in it, but also the lives of others still to come in future centuries.<br />Decisions, several people made in the 19th century, for instance, and how<br />these decisions kept influencing future lives 300 years later and even<br />further on to future individuals.<br /><br />In a time, where the last natural ressources of our planet are being<br />exploited for greed of profit; in a time, where the wealthy industrial<br />nations are making even more profit on the backs of the poor Third-<br />World-Countries' populations, up to such highly perverted stockmarket-poker<br />with shares on basic foods -<br />in such times as these, isn't it high time to ask ourselves, whether we<br />might have a responsibility in what is happening here?<br />Are we really thinking that we will get away with it when we die, and<br />leave this \\"legacy\\" that we created to our future generations to clean up?<br />What if these `future generations' will be nobody else than us - in a new<br />body though, even possibly holding a different sex or ethnic background -<br />but the problems, the circumstances, we will be facing then, we did create<br />ourselves centuries ago already - the small-scale ones as well as the<br />big-scale ones.<br /><br />Fourth idea: Change thinking. Trespass boundaries and dare act against<br />conventions - even then, when it's uncomfortable; when the majority or the<br />holders of power don't like it.<br /><br />Five stars are not remotely enough to rate this phantastic, wonderful movie.<br />What an awesome gift..!

B000002UC5|5|Great expectations killed this album.  I was a teenager when this album was first released in 1970 and can tell you that people wanted a major Beatle-type production from him at that time.  Obviously, there was no way he could have lived up to the publics' expectation.  However, 'McCartney' is a great album and was not appreciated like it should have been at the time.  I like every song on the album, and after recently listening to it again a few times, I find Paul is still very much a &quot;Beatle&quot; on both 'McCartney' AND 'Ram'.  While the tracks sound a bit raw and have Linda on background vocals, both 'McCartney&quot; AND 'Ram' have a Beatle feel to them.  Very different than his Wings' sound. I find both Albums interesting for their Beatle-istic sound alone.  Basically, if you like the Beatles, you'll like 'McCartney' and 'Ram'.  They both sound great!  P.S.  I'm not a McCartney fanatic.  I believe he began his downslide with his 'Wings at the Speed of Sound' album.  With the exceptions of of a few tracks on that album, he really hasn't been the same since.
B00DUGCLY4|4|This game sure makes you think. It can be easy and difficult and catches you sometimes. Fun and relaxing. Great for all ages.
B00FAPF5U0|5|Wow!  Never thought I'd ever find a game that is as fun and addicting as Tetris was for me when I was a kid.  But then I found this!!!
B004IV5AKM|5|A movie to be watched over and over again. Martin Landau is the best and his scene stealing makes the movie all that much better.

B00VJ04TH0|1|Ill change my review when we get the original 4 5 and 6
1612930425|5|One friend asked me why the book, Pride and Prejudice, became one of the most famous classics of all time. She knew it exemplified a great English writing style, but after reading the book, it only gave her the impression of an early 19th century \\"chick-flick\\", targeted for fans of romance novels. The book, however, offered me not only a witty, romantic comedy but also educational and historical values through the realistic depictions of an early 19th century English society.<br /> Throughout the whole book, the main characters constantly reminded me of the famous maxim: Don't judge a book by its cover. When the heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, meets the male character, Darcy, she finds him handsome, young and rich; the type of men that any women during her time period would consider to be the perfect husband. But his proud arrogance and aloofness prick her pride, causing her to stubbornly decide to dislike Darcy. This fire of hatred is further fueled along when Wickham, a handsome soldier, wins Liz's heart through his seemingly agreeable personality. Providing her with spiteful lies about Darcy, Wickham helps Liz's prejudice to grow. When the truth is reveled, however, Liz realizes that she had made the wrong impressions about both Darcy and Wickham based upon their exterior behaviors and appearances. In fact, Wickham turns out to be a scandalous liar whose addiction for gambling has broke him poor and Darcy turns out to be a truly noble person who knows how to care for and love those dear to him.<br /> In the end, Liz learns to correct her mistake of making misimpression and eventually marries Darcy who loves her for who she really is. This unrealistically happy ending, however, caused me to be aware of the real matrimony system in the early 19th century. The main characters ended happily; a girl from a poor family married the perfect man from a wealthy background due to their true, inseparable love. But other characters showed otherwise. For example, Liz's friend, Charlotte Lucas, agreed to marry Mr. Collins despite the fact that her friend had rejected him a few days ago. No love existed in this marriage obviously, but Charlotte could not have been happier as the marriage had much benefit for her: it saved her from her poor financial status and even from the shame of remaining unmarried at her old age. Just like Charlotte, many lower class women settled to be content with marriages, if they brought them or their families a little benefit.<br /> On the other hand, Ms. Bingley and Lady Catherine show how the upper class of the early 19th century married. Ignoring love mostly, both compared Darcy's social class, financial status, and family background to judge if marrying herself (Ms. Bingley's case) or her daughter (Lady Catherine's case) would be the most advantageous combination. In both cases, the source of wealth and power could be traced as the men, whom the women had to depend on and negotiate with to marry as best as they could. Both classes considered greatly the effects on the future and the family that the marriage would bring and the way how these female character perceived marriages proved how the real women during the early 19th century actually married.<br /> In conclusion, Pride and Prejudice should not be only read for observing Jane Austen's talent in writing or for mere enjoyment of romantic comedy, but also for development in mature perception and the cultural history that the book offered. Pride and Prejudice is an educational novel that clearly depicts the difficulty in forming perspective about other people and the dangers that could arise when our impressions or senses are trusted too much. It does not only offer an insight into how women of the early 19th century really lived but shows their lifestyle, way of thinking and the harsh reality of the matrimony system.
B00EE3FVSU|5|Excellent drama with sympathetic characters
B000FC2ROU|5|I thoroughly enjoyed reading Kafka on the Shore and it was a great book club selection. The most unique book I've read in a long time!

B004XJRQUQ|5|Loved the Books.  cant say it enough.  cant wait for the rest of the movies to come out, id love to watch them too
0452289963|5|An absolutely life changing read.  Totally changed the way I think.
B00881VLCE|5|I downloaded this app for my new Kindle fire 6.  It has an excellent variety of free puzzles with more to download. It also has a wide variety of number of pieces to choose from allowing both kids and adults to play. I highly recommend this free app.
0345446798|5|Tricia has done it in a whole new style.  This book took the information of solid training books and put it into an easy read with wonderful insights that sterile training books miss.  <br />This would be a great book for getting started before getting the dog and a must read for anyone who already has a dog. It was packed full of training help with great stories that helped explain it to the newbies who haven't seen it all.  For those who have seen it all this book brings it home again with delightful stories and a humour rarely seen in dog training books.
B00001OH7N|5|Nowadays it's interesting to listen to music from the &quot;classic rock&quot; period and see just what stands the test of time.  Bowie, who was always on the cutting edge of new trends, wrote music that is still very relevant today.  The great thing about CDs like this one is the combination of an alternative sound with superior musicianship.  I always listen first for the drive of the rhythm section, and this one in &quot;Man who sold the world&quot; is top of the line.  When you add the superior song writing and overall edge you end up with great songs like &quot;All the Madmen,&quot; &quot;Savior Machine,&quot; and the title track.  Of course I am partial to everything Bowie wrote up through &quot;Lodger.&quot;  There are amazing contrasts in every CD.  I am a bit irritated, though, about the reissuing of the CDs on Virgin.  Amazing how we've lost the bonus tracks and still end up paying more. Oh well, that's capitalism.
B004H4XDBI|3|I was happy to hear a follow-up of If I Stay, and I loved the way it ended, but this book was pretty boring. It was basically an extensive summary of what happened next... I would still recommend reading it though if you want to know what happens to Mia & Adam
B00005A46T|5|OK. I´ve been sitting here for 15 minuetes trying write this review, but I got to say it´s really hard. I´m a Slipknot fan(maggot)and I want to put down what I got to say about Slipknot.<BR>But sometimes things like that can be hard, and by hard I meen telling what I feel about things inside. But I´m going to try to put down my feelings about Iowa, let´s just hope this isn´t going to be too lame...<br />There are alot of bands out there who start really good with one ore two song. Limp Bizkit had Nookie,Break Stuff,Faith and My Generation. KoRn had ADIDAS,Blind,Falling Away From Me and Faget. It´s the same with Marilyn Manson, Mudvayne and Slayer. But after they became famous things started to get sour, the bands stopped making any efford on the their next albums. <br />But where they failed Slipknot succeded, their first album was in my opinion great. It was really complexed and Slipknot were trying alot of things and really making something different, that was what I liked about it, it was complex and unique.<BR>I had my doubts when Iowa came out but they soon dissapeared. Iowa is completely different and much more focused album than the first one, and thats a good thing. Alot of bands are stuck in the same old sound but Slipknot try to make their sound different. <br />I´m not going to write my opinion on each song, that´s simply too hard. Plus I think each and everyone should have their own opinion on the songs, and what they mean. But I think their all great and you just set the CDplayer to RANDOM and enjoy the music.<br />Slipknot also wear boiler suits and masks that adds to the whole sicness thing, it looks really cool but my opinion is. To hell with the coverups and the masks. I care about the music!!!  <BR>But to make it short, Iowa is a REALLY good album. And in the future Slipknot will be remebered...<br />(Sorry about my spelling)
B000002HAF|5|Rarely does an album come along that makes you want to play music yourself.In the case of the Pixies, that is exactly what happens.If you dont play music,you'll decide to; and if you already do you'll be inspired to play more.From the blistering &quot;bone machine&quot; to the euphoric &quot;river euphrates,&quot;this album has a unique and special feel that hardly ever comes around.The songs have a purity to them that stops them from sounding overproduced or thought about too much. It's like they just played and this great sound came out.(Part of this is due to Steve Albini who produced it).So,to keep this short, if you're looking for musical oblivion I suggest you get this album -and plenty of batteries for your walkman- because you won't stop listening to it.
B00DV2D0JC|5|Got this for free. Its a great game,full version even. Its a five star game for sure..can't wait for more games
B009NFHF0Q|5|A wonderful story, period.  Think on what you have read in the last year or two. How many good stories have you been told?  This is a story you will want to carry about with you and share with friends. Quit dithering and read it.
B00L9B7IKE|5|Shocking. A great book. Twisting and turning the entire time. Loved it! Def a great book to recommend to others.
031261246X|5|I write technology and network security books, articles, newsletters and white papers for a living. Reading for fun is one of my guilty pleasures. But lately I've been disappointed in the deteriorating quality of the fiction books that I read. Even many of my long-time favorite novelists seem to have gotten sloppy, and most of the new books are badly written from a technical point of view, fail to bring anything fresh to overused plotlines, and/or aren't able to keep the story moving, make me care about the characters or wrap up the plot elements into a coherent whole.<br /><br />There are, however, a few folks who can still tell a story. The two books I read immediately preceding Zero Day were by Neal Stephenson and Orson Scott Card, old standbys who never let me down. Those guys are tough acts to follow, and as I opened up Mark's book (in the Kindle app on my Galaxy Tab, if anyone cares), I felt a mixture of eager anticipation and a smidgen of worry.  Mostly, I was excited to embark on reading a novel written by someone I actually knew personally; that doesn't happen every day.<br /><br />If you don't know who Mark Russinovich is, check out his bio on Wikipedia. Pretty impressive technical creds, huh? I knew that Mark really knows his stuff when it comes to computers, so I was looking forward to (finally!) reading a novel about technology that wouldn't have me stopping every few pages to shake my head and say \\"no, no, no - it doesn't work that way.\\" (Dan Brown's Digital Fortress is just one example of a technothriller that, despite the author's storytelling skills, I couldn't enjoy because I wasn't able to get past the technical mistakes).<br /><br />The worry? I knew it was a first novel, and I know very well that being very, very smart doesn't necessarily ensure that a person can write in a compelling way. Writing fiction is very different from writing technical papers. And in fact, some of the smartest people I know write some of the most boring material. And I also knew, from my own efforts, that writing a novel is hard work. Writing a novel well is even harder. Would he be able to pull it off?<br /><br />I'm going to be brutally honest here: The opening scene didn't exactly impress me and make me want to read more.  Oh, I know starting things off with some gratuitous sex is supposed to be a sure-fire technique for grabbing readers' attention and it probably works just fine with the young male geeks who are likely to make up a large part of this book's audience. But if you aren't a member of that group and you don't really particularly like that sort of thing, hang in there. It's all over in a page and a half and once we get that out of the way, the story starts to take off into the wild blue yonder. Literally. Of course, John Nance is one of my favorite novelists and aviation is one of my special interests so I'm always a sucker for a good barely-averted-air-disaster scene. Scene 2, played out in the cockpit of British Airways Flight 188, had me hooked by the third paragraph. And from there on out, it was a wild and wooly ride.<br /><br />As I made my way through the book, it only got better and better. Many years ago, I devoured all the popular novels written by Arthur Hailey, whose Airport and Runway Zero-Eight were my favorites (aviation buff, remember).  His other titles, such as Hotel (about the hospitality industry), Wheels (about the automobile industry), The Moneychangers (about the banking industry), and Strong Medicine (about the pharmaceutical industry) also kept me up late for many nights in the 70s and 80s. Zero Day is written in the same format as Hailey's books, shuffling the scene back and forth between many different localities and characters, with one strong protagonist tying it all together.  Great literature? No - but highly entertaining and also informative, thanks to all the research that went into them. Is it a formulaic style? Maybe so, but it's an effective one. It can also be a maddening one ifit's not handled just right - I've read more than one book written in this style that fell apart completely because the author couldn't seem to juggle the plethora of subplots or keep all those characters' personalities consistent. I'm happy to report that Mark did a great job of managing this shifting landscape.<br /><br />The plot is built around a rapidly evolving set of incidents involving computer system failures that result in serious situations, some of which are only costly in monetary terms, but many of which are life-threatening. Our emergent hero is Jeff Aiken, mild-mannered computer expert who left the frustrations and bureaucratic red tape of his government job (in the CIA, no less) for the private sector, where he makes lots of money doing damage control and clean-up after corporate security breaches, somewhat akin to the way Red Adair sweeps into town to put things right after an oilwell fire. Jeff and his former government colleague, Dr. Daryl Haugen (the somewhat stereotypical beautiful blonde computer genius who wants to be admired for her brains instead of her body) come to realize that the incidents - ranging from the decimation of a law firm's network to the failure of a 787 jetliner's computerized systems to a \\"glitch\\" in a hospital's records system that causes several patient deaths from improper medication - are all related and part of a cyberterrorist attack.  The race to track down the bad guys and prevent the worst from happening is on.<br /><br />The story is deadly serious, and it will keep you awake, turning the pages late into the night, as you worry over what's going to happen in the book (and may also keep you awake nights after you've finished it, worrying about just how close we are to a real-life version of these events). There are also moments of comic relief. As the male chauvinist DHS bureaucrat - who's involved in some clandestine activities of his own - watches  Daryl walk away, he ruminates over how \\"these computer types were always getting worked up over nothing\\" - and how \\"the few attractive women among them were the worst.\\"  As a woman in the male-dominated computer security field, I can't help grinning and thinking I've met this guy before - a few times over.<br /><br />When I read a novel, especially a first novel, and more especially a first novel about computer-related matters written by a computer expert, I can't help wondering how much of himself the author put into his main character.  Jeff taught at Carnegie-Mellon; Mark got his Ph.D. from the same university. Jeff is an entrepreneur who has built a successful business tracking down malware; Mark co-founded Winternals Software. They say every first novel is autobiographical to some extent, so it's hard not to see Jeff as a fictionalized version of Mark. But that only adds to the mystique.<br /><br />All in all, it's a great read. If you want to get nit-picky, there are enough typos to be annoying - as is the case with almost every novel I read these days, including those by big name authors such as Stephen King and John Grisham.  These are little things, such as \\"then\\" when it should have been \\"than\\" or missing punctuation.  Some are the types of mistakes that get introduced in the editing process. Darn, how I wish these publishers would let me proofread these books before they go to print (hint, hint).<br /><br />I noticed that one reviewer complained about getting bogged down in the technical details. Maybe it's because I'm in the tech industry and already have an understanding of these things, but I thought the technical issues were explained very well, translating the techno jargon to mainstream terms and using analogies that should be easy for anyone, tech savvy or not, to understand. If you're an IT pro, you'll get into it on several different levels - but don't be afraid to recommend it to your friends and relatives who aren't computer professionals (Do, however, be prepared to answer their concerned questions aboutwhether all this could really happen when they find themselves scared to death by what takes place in the novel).<br /><br />At $14.08 for the hardcover or $11.99 for the electronic edition (on Amazon), this book is a bargain, for both its entertainment and its educational value. Don't just buy one; buy a second one for a friend.\\"the few attractive women among them were the worst.\\"  As a woman in the male-dominated computer security field, I can't help grinning and thinking I've met this guy before - a few times over.

B008K7WCJM|5|I was initially underwhelmed by this album, which made all the critics' best-of lists for 2012, but eventually I realized what everyone was raving about.  The thing is, though, THE SEER is not equally superb throughout.  The second disc is just amazing, so don't be too hasty to form your opinion after only hearing Disc One.  The opening track (Lunacy) is fairly light, and there is a clear minimalist influence.  Then Disc Two shoots us screaming into space on a dark, psychedelic voyage!<br /><br />Michael Gira's reformed Swans are more powerful than ever.  The more recent TO BE KIND (2014) is more consistent than THE SEER -- it's stronger throughout -- but it does not reach the same heights.<br /><br />The music of Michael Gira and Swans is raw, visionary and uncompromising.  His vocals remind of both Lou Reed and Iggy Pop, but the music is sui generis.  Listening is like plugging your mind directly into the black hole at the heart of the galaxy.
B007JM4CWY|5|This game is so amazing and challenging. I can never tell what picture its going to make but with some math skills I can figure them out. These are so addicting I think Ive skipped eating a few meals. lol. But seriously... I never leave feedback but this one I had too!!! I really do see the graph when I'm trying to sleep. Better then sodoku!
B00002Z88D|5|From the first time I heard this album just after it was released, to the time I saw the whole concert on DVD, to right f'n now, I've never been able to put my feelings to words.  While combining rock and roll music with a symphony orchestra isn't exactly a break through in music, Metallica doing it is.  The band has long been known as possibly the best Hard Rock/Metal band ever (not to take anything away from Led Zepplin or Black Sabbath) and this adds a totally new dimension to their music.  From old classics like For Whom The Bell Tolls and One, to new hits like Hero of the Day and Outlaw Torn, this CD moves, mesmorizes and gives goosebumps to me every time.<br />Even though I would have liked to see Sanitarium or Fade to Black in place of songs like Devil's Dance, this CD is well worth the 20 bucks for both CDs.  And if you have a DVD player, get the live concert.  Just as worth it
B000UR366S|5|It's a joy to see Joni Mitchell back.  On her new album Shine; she touches every facet of our post 9/11 Society.  From our self-absorption with technology to being unconscious in the now.  It cuts to the core of who we are today and what we \\"as a people\\" are allowing to occur politically, enviornmentally, and economically.      Thank you Miss Mitchell.  Shine.

B004XJRQUQ|5|I had heard that this story was great,but never took an interest. I actually thought I had \\"missed the boat\\" on being so late to read even one of the books.<br />So, I was looking thru my Kindle,hunting for something very different for me to read, and I do love to read multiple stories by one author. The fact that it was the trilogy caught my eye and I entered into \\"The Hunger Games. I could not put it down until I had read all three books. Then I went and saw it in the movies.<br />What an adventure, sad and happy at the same time. Having children killing each other was hard to take, but it was a good story. I feel that I would recommend this futuristic drama to all adults and older children,given to the fact that they could understand the story. I really loved it and it held my interest in being something I might have never read, even thou I loved all of Harry Potter and the Twilight Saga.Its just not for kids.<br />Happy Reading,<br />Kathleen Tillotson
B006HL9G10|5|I was just looking for a simple timer with a nice bell. This one blows your socks off! Multiple bells, multiple options, ability to save meditation routines, journal entries, session history and landmarks, and tracking of sessions... PLUS connections to online communities of varied meditation/contemplation interest in  which you are not required to participate. This program even made my lunch for me while I was meditating!!!.... OK..... not....but close.<br /><br />The ONLY thing that might possibly be missing is a selection for a mindfulness bell that would ring randomly via some algorithm. Even that can be worked around in establishing a session routine with scheduling different bells at different volumes and intervals.
B001T6PXFG|3|The way movies were. Entertaining, educational with limited violence. No foul language.  No nudity. This became a battle of wits between Gregory Peck an Irish Priest and Christopher Plummer the Nazi officer.  Excellent ending.

It was completely mind blowing in it's time, but like most fusion music, it hasn't stood the test of time all that well. When you listen to this album today, some of it sounds very dated, just pointless riffing and speed runs punctuated by disjointed ensemble parts, with very little substance in the writing.  In particular, \\"Medieval Overture\\", \\"Majestic Dance\\" and \\"The Musician\\" suffer the most from this.<br /><br />On the other hand, there's some really great stuff here.  Lenny White's \\"The Sorceress\\" sounds amazingly fresh to me, probably because it is more flowing, has such nice funky grooves and less frenetic soloing.  To me, Lenny was by far the most underrated member of this supergroup, for his writing skills as well as his incredible drumming.  The acoustic title cut \\"Romantic Warrior\\" is absolutely beautiful.  The closer, \\"The Duel of the Jester and the Tyrant\\", pretty much stands as the pinnacle of the 70s jazz-rock movement, with amazing soloing and instrumental interplay.<br /><br />To me, fusion never got much better than this.  Of course, there's still Mahavishnu, Weather Report, Brand X, etc.!  But even more importantly, almost every one of these fusion albums has a \\"Tribute to John\\" or a \\"Miles Beyond\\" on it.  These fusion bands wore their influences on their sleeves, and as a result, jazz rock became the bridge for us rock'n'roll guys to explore the world of classic jazz.
B00280LYIM|5|I loved the series all the books I loved and this one kept me guessing and even shocked. read it again and again
B007FG9LIE|5|I've tried a few other Blake Crouch books, and never quite sunk myself into them.  He has a great writing style and imagination; the obvious comparison is Stephen King.  But with Stephen King sort of sliding into a boring zone lately, I'm looking to branch out.<br /><br />Have to admit I was sold by the fact that Fox is apparently prepping a series based on the Wayward Pines books.  Made them worth a look for me.<br /><br />I think the author's note at the end sets the stage best: these books are a nod to the old Twin Peaks series.  Small town, perfect on the surface, but something odd going on just beneath the surface.<br /><br />The pacing is really perfect - good action, maddeningly slow to reveal small hints of what's going on.  Small inconsistencies that leave you thinking that perhaps the author made errors - then a riproaring ending that ties it together and sets up the next book in the series.<br /><br />Immediately downloaded the next one.  My only fear is that the first one sets a high bar, and the main reveal is so major that I'm not sure what could be more engrossing.<br /><br />But I'm sure gonna find out!
1423113454|4|This was a very interesting and captivating book, and I would definitely recommend it to any reader 12 or older who likes action and suspense. This book is about two siblings Sadie and Carter who are nothing alike. Sadie is very cautious and responsible, while Carter is the adventurous one who always finds his way into trouble. Sadie and Carters father, Dr. Julius Kane, is a brilliant Egyptologist. Their adventure starts when their father takes them on a trip to the British museum. While visiting the museum, their father blows up the Rosetta stone and releases 5 Egyptian gods: Isis, Osiris, Horus, Set, and Nephthys. The evil god, Set, traps Dr. Kane in a tomb and then disappears. Terrified, Sadie and Carter turn to their uncle Amos, who informs them that their father is an Egyptian magician and that they are as well. Suddenly, the kids and uncle Amos are attacked by Set and Uncle Amos disappears just like their father. The kids escape and are rescued by a fellow Egyptian magician named Zia. Zia brings the kids to the House of Life and tells them that they are in danger of being ambushed by Set and the other evil gods. The children are given a place to sleep at the House of life and spend their first night at the House of Life. The next morning, the kids are terrified when they realize that the previous day's events were no dream. They sit on the balcony and have breakfast with Zia, but they have yet another terrifying encounter with Set, this time he captures Zia, the kids escape yet again but now they are all alone.<br />  If you want to hear the end of this story you must read the book, and trust me it is worth reading.
B003XF1XOQ|5|I read the Hunger Games trilogy and recommend it for adults as well as teens.  I was reluctant to read the books as the premise of children being pitted against one another to the death for the enjoyment of a dysfunctional society was not appealing to me.  BUT read I did and from the very first book felt there was a strong underlying message about buildinmg character, integrity and determining what is right and what is wrong.  By the end of the third book  the author conveys a strong anti-war message reinforcing war is inhumane and never the way to settle differences.
B00BS4PAXO|5|With one click I had the album right on my amazon cloud,  LOVE IT!!  Best Darlene Zschech album ever!!!!!<br /> When my children have asked to repeat the whole album just to praise and worship, and dance then I know they too feel his presence :)
B008K9SG9K|5|Saw this band live and they were amazing.  This is a great cd!
B00KA87GCW|5|This game is truly amazing. I would recommend this game for children.
B00N2EFKV0|4|Very enjoyable, better than the movie.
B00AREIAI8|5|Daughter had this on the desktop & now also on the kindle. Likes to play on cold rainy days when she cant be out with the real horses.
0990773698|5|I started following Grace's blog \\"Texan in Tokyo\\" a few months ago and have been a regular reader ever since. Her first book was great so I knew this one wouldn't disappoint! It's a quick and easy read, but since the comics are rounded out with some fascinating facts on various topics about Japan, you walk away not only entertained, but having learned something.    I really enjoy her down to earth writing style -- you never get the feeling that she's trying to be an authority on Japan, you're just seeing things through her eyes as a foreigner who's lived in the country for a bit but still discovering some of the intricacies of daily life there. The fact that Grace, her husband Ryosuke, and the imaginary but adorable Marvin are so likable just make it that much more enjoyable to read. Since the book is self-published, it may not be as polished or structured as it might be if it were released by a publishing house, but I actually think the style suits the book well and you can really tell it was a labor of love for the author. Highly recommend for anyone interested in Japan or just looking for a fun read!
B0086700CM|5|this game is solo much fun! its super fun and addicting. the goals make it worth the time you spend playing it.
B00FEMJF6O|1|Won't let me play until updates.  Brings me to the App store but  no update option on my Kindle Fire.
B008XG1X18|5|This is an awesome sight where you can find anything you are looking for whether it be recipes, home, travel and many more.  Would highly recommend.
B00452VF4O|4|Good read just not sure how to read some of the Welch names. Good drama concerning the relationship between the major players.
B007PFD90G|3|Some typically sharp insights about life love and risk sprinkled in a very thick chronology of events great and small and names dropped...a major subtext seems to be the author's missed opportunities for income due to his unfortunate situation.
B008FYZIVY|5|I love Downton Abbey!!  This popular series is wonderful! Series one starts in 1912, with the sinking of the Titanic, Series Two continues into World War One.  The story line, acting and costumes are all superb. The series has a beautiful setting in an English house.  It is great!
B004UNX1LS|1|I downloaded this but it wouldn't come up on my apps so I went to appstore and downloaded it again because it didn't say open.then it says Vevo is already on your device so I finally got to download it again and it didn't show up so I had to go to the Amazon appstore to click open.
B00IJJUIMY|5|Excellent - what we expect from Michael Connelly
B007HJ9NBE|3|Wishing the language had been a bit more PG.  The original was great and did not have this language.  Watch the original instead of this one.
B003Q6D2BE|5|We love this film. An intelligent, funny, sad at times, action flick for adults. It was wonderful to see this amazing cast in a smart story  that shows that a little gray (or bald) doesn't mean senile or stupid .Helen Mirren is one of the most gifted actors of our time and  her  love story is so sweet and yet not a bit sappy  And can't everyone over forty  relate to John Malkovich's &#34;old man my ass&#34;? Please buy your own copy and enjoy it.
B00OY0G2LI|5|Just what I was looking for.
B00005QZWI|4|I give Howard Shore Five Hundred stars for the work he has done with this trilogy.  A very well earned Oscar indeed!  <br />However, I was a little disappointed with the soundtrack for the first film.  There were several musical cues that were altogether missing - mainly the three note cue which you hear as the Fellowship is approaching the entrance to the Mines of Moria.  Also, the opening melody from the film is not in the beginning of this disc - in fact, much of the music from the prologue is not at the beginning of this disc.  I'm not even sure where they got the music for the first track.  <br />I like to put on Albums Two and Three and hear that opening theme - the Ring theme - because it makes me feel like I am watching the movie!  I was highly disappointed that it was missing from this disc.<br />However, what IS there is still top-notch, and you can hear on every track why Shore got the Oscar.  Beautiful, haunting, suspenseful, melcholic - I don't think anyone can hear the Hobbit Pastoral Theme without getting a little teary-eyed.  The music for Rivendale and the Elves is gorgeous!  But my favorite moment on the soundtrack is probably also one of my favorite moments in the film - it occurs on Track 7 (Knife in the Dark) and corresponds to the one-minute camera move which tracks through Isengard, up the tower to Gandalf, and back down again into the pits of the orcs.  It is the industrial Uruk theme - I love it! <br />Despite my misgivings, this is still a great disc, and you must buy it!
B003O86FMW|5|Everything about this part of the series is so unexpected!  Keep reading, I refuse to spoil anything with a review.
B00J2VSS0C|4|I enjoy playing this game immensely. It gives me great enjoyment and is very relaxing. I especially like to play in the evenings when my husband is watching his shows.
B00AMBH70S|4|A good movie overall. What you'd expect from this series, action suspense etc.  The ending did leave a bit to be desired, however I suppose they're leaving it open for another movie.
B005544TRQ|5|Excelent series.
B00005JPAO|4|The Bottom Line:    An interesting drama that doesn't follow a biopic formula and is all the better for it, The Queen shows the events surrounding Princess Diana's 1997 death through the eyes of Queen Elizabeth II; with fine performances by Mirren, Sheen, and Cromwell, it's a successful and interesting piece of filmmaking.
B004L3AR0K|5|I certainly didn't expect this movie to be as powerful as it turned out to be. It really is a great show. Not for the little viewers because of all the skin, but it's a well written show!
B002N5N5QQ|5|Love this show
B0058YPG1G|5|If you haven't seen this series you need to, it doesn't disappoint!
B00AREIAI8|5|One of the more fun free apps out there. I just wish the stuff in game wasn't so expensive! But no matter since I can see myself becoming addicted!
B009361C5O|5|great antivirus
B004SBS8LA|5|love the improved graphics and music, a nice upgrade from the original. I am looking forward to the new levels coming out each month, keeping the game fresh.
B00L9B7IKE|3|I read the first couple hundred pages then skipped to the end, the story was good just way more info on her riding on the train and getting drunk that became repetitive.
B005LAIHSG|4|This movie is a fun, new look at the Snow White literature.  A perfectly modern storyline, set in a very cool and imaginative world.  The last quarter of the movie might be a bit predictable but definitely worth watching and owning.
1936891026|4|Very insightful
0393317552|5|I do not have a degree in history but have always been interested in discovering the past.  Many \\"scholarly\\" books speak at a level that makes reading them more a chore than pleasure.  Guns, Germs, and Steel sets a standard for intelligent, well composed historical prose that hits all the high points.  I never felt left behind by the author and was intrigued by the expanding case for environment as the driving cause of conquest and the make up of our modern world.<br />A joy to read, it is enlightening and well laid out.  The only caveat would be Diamond's tendency to restate his case and prove already acceptable theories.  The entire work is logical and I can't find an argument to dispute his conclusions.
B00DHHWXYY|5|Gatsby is glam and baz  with jay-z help has taken you to the era using the music of the this era to get you there. What might seem distracting is a deep layering of experience and memory senses juxtaposing the 2 eras as one in the same. The book ,the Redford movie all out the door enjoy each as there own unique journey. This is a feast for eyes and ears so eat it up!
B000001GQP|5|I know I'm new to Carmina Burana and have only recently started listening to this lively, rhythmic cantata. However, after comparing different interpretations by borrowing CDs from the library, I think this is still the most satisfying, gutsy and punchy recording of the work currently available.    In my comments I don't think I can add much to the laudatory reviews already posted. It would still be a marvellous rendition even if Orff didn't authorise it. But perhaps it's due to the crisp, rhythmic and gutsy singing and playing from all levels. Jochum presides over a gutsy, incisive performance and the orchestra and chorus give their all when they perform the piece. I think he is a good judge of tempi in this piece, brisk but not rushed like an F1 Ferrari.    He has a superb trio of soloists at his disposal. I think that Fischer-Dieskau acquits himself admirably in his many solos. He sounds rough and coarse during his two solos in th In Taberna section, and sounds suitably gruff in the Abbot's song. Elsewhere he is his old lieder-singing self in his solos, in Omnia Sol temperat and also in Circa mea pectora. Gerhart Stolze gives one of the best renditions of the Roasted Swan song. It sounds effortless and suitably mock-tragic, and his falsetto makes it just right. Janowitz also does superbly in her solos, most notably in In trutina. Elsewhere the chorus handles the varying moods of the piece and performs their parts with aplomb.    It's remarkable that this version has held up well since it was first released. And I think the current DG Originals remaster makes it sound better than ever, even better than the previous DG Galleria CD. However, I would confess that I own the Japanese Universal SHM-CD (Super High Material CD) issue of this recording, and the SHM-CD does more justice to the recording. I think it makes the instruments and voices sound clearer and more defined than this regular CD. But then that issue would cost the earth if you were to try and find it onHMV Japan.    In short, I think this Carmina Burana recording is a rather unbeatable version that has held up well in spite of the competition. I think it caters to the varying moods of this lively cantata and I think it's one of the best-balanced versions. No doubt there are other excellent recordings available but I think this is one of the most enduring recordings currently available.
B00683JK9K|5|aagain, magic puzzles has provided a great variety of scenes that are detailed and very beautiful. each picture is unique and there are many to choose from. I really enjoy the scenery pictures as opposed to pictures of specific animals or phenomenon
B00VRYCGLO|4|Still playing no comment right now
B008AK8FHM|5|WONDERFUL!!! A little dragging on but wonderful
B0053TMP24|5|This is another strong addition to the series.  Frank seemed as much like the main hero throughout the book as Percy just like I felt Leo was as much the main hero as Jason from book 1 (Lost Hero)  Similar formula from book one and two and that's not a bad thing. Another Riordan book that makes me not want it to end. Good thing I have the next book in the series.
B002MQYOFW|5|The best book I can think of in the world ever. And, it was filled with action, despair, drama and adventure.
B00A4A59B6|5|I love three doors down. They sing about life.
B0063M22QO|5|Love how easy it is to see the depth of the tiles. Extremely easy to understand instructions, love the hint &amp; shuffle buttons.
B0041KKYEW|1|I had to check - three times now - that I did not accidentally receive a DVD disc, because the quality of the blu-ray is UNACCEPTABLE.  The picture quality is horrendous - there is so much noise and the entire film lacks the crispness I expect from a blu-ray disc.  For a film that has a lot of dark, heavily shadowed scenes, these flaws really jump out.  I would almost recommend just buying the DVD, but I shudder to think how the quality is on that if the blu-ray looks like this!
B00005R1N3|5|I saw this film for the first time when I was a child, late at night, with the lights off and was scared and awestruck by this truly terrifying and groundbreaking film. Never before or since has there been a killer in a horror film so insane. The script, acting, and humor are top notch. The suspense is almost unbearable because of what's not seen or known to the viewer. Your imagination is what this film uses to frighten you, not blood and gore galore. It has the most original ending (not done since, that I know of) I've ever seen in a film of this genre. I think last years &quot;Limbo&quot; was the first to repeat such an ending, 25 years later! I'm stunned this film wasn't a huge hit when originally released in 1975. I've owned a copy of it on VHS for the last 5 years and the tagline on the cover truly prepares you for viewing the film: &quot;If this movie doesn't make your skin crawl, it's on too tight.&quot; Every person I've shown the film to has thoroughly enjoyed and been totally creeped out by it, and they'd never heard of it! What a shame. Hopefully now that it's being released on DVD, it will be rediscovered by the public and be placed on critic's list's as one of the best horror/suspense films EVER. Warning: This film should NOT be viewed alone.
B000YHG72E|5|Holiday classic!!
B001NLL93W|5|I remember the so-called young adult books I read back in the day were so incredibly immature. These stories are wonderfully complex and mature. I highly recommend reading the series.
B0052RDHTM|5|Unfortunately I read the 3rd book first and found it so interesting, I was forced to go to this one next. Very easy to follow the characters and as soon as I finished this one, I started on the second.  It was ok to read the 3rd book first as it could stand alone but I found it so interesting, I went for the first and second.
B0054JZC6E|5|this is pretty cool. lots of games. my son and daughter love to posy games. there are plenty they can play.
0440217563|5|Great book with great plot. Love the whole series!
1558908455|5|The CD is great, I wish I had purchased it sooner.  Would recommend this CD to anyone who likes scary vampire movies.
B003O86FMW|5|This is the third time I have read the book. I love it as much now as I did when it first came out.
B00E8KLWB4|4|I love these games all the extras a little confusing though
B00DOPEGAS|5|My girl got this, and she just loves this.  Many loom bands, colors, and the board is tough.  Great set!
B001QE1BDY|1|Cannot play on player...Believe it to be a foreign format and should have been advertised that way...If possible, would like credit for this item..Can also return if possible
B0000DZTIL|5|I have seen this this movie when i still was under 13 years of age. Since I have a DVD Player I was looking for this movie on a DVD. The movie is funny, good sound and a lot of good jokes.
B000P12LWY|3|This series is fun IF you forget it's supposed to be about Henry VIII and his court.  (I can't believe one reviewer called this series \\"90% accurate\\"!)  It's more like a historical fantasy only without magic.  The costuming is so Not Tudor -- it's RenFaire Retro.  Others have mentioned some of the more egregious errors, so I'll just list my favorites of what I've dubbed \\"Tudor Moments\\" here (spoiler alert):  Everyone riding in carriages -- carriages with large glass windows.  Cardinal Wolsey committing suicide -- and by slitting his own throat, yet!  No one ages a day although apparently years have gone by.  My absolute favorite:  the portrait of Richard III hanging on the wall in one of Henry's rooms!! That alone makes it worth 3 stars!
B00DV2D0JC|5|So much fun and greatly made. Got it for free thinking it would be enough to keep me entertained and it did.
B008MG1E4A|5|No Easy Day provides great insight into the UBL mission and the recent history of US special forces. Well done.
B002MQYOFW|5|love this book
B00CNQ7HAU|5|Great follow up to Jake Brigance and the Haley trial...a page turner
B00ABGEFWC|5|Every time I log on it says that there's an update available but it won't let me update it but other than that it's a grate game but I hate hate hate hate blyth so so so much I liked that the pet's ruled now there really pet's :/ :( :)
B00E6Z0THE|1|Awful, frustrating, even the hints make no sense..<br />End game not even worth playing...
0399255370|5|I first bought this book for my nearly 5 year old stepson. He loves the book, and it has very quickly become a family favorite. I have since bought this book for others, as I think it is creative, teaches problem solving and negotiation skills, and is just plain cute. Great book for kids of all ages, both genders. Highly recommend!
B00I8Q77Y0|5|I love this game so much. It is just principally bird but for the kindle. I also like the tubes and how they change color!
B004FRX0MY|5|I would definitely recommend this app. I love having music on my Kindle and it was easy to download my music library. I take my kindle everywhere, now that I can listen to my music, too.
B001TCHDPS|5|Rodriguez story is amazing. I love his style and his thoughts. What a find. So glad I saw the movie
B009329Y30|3|story okay, zac seems a little young for part,not good chemistry between stars.  not as good as the Notebook movie.
B00006LI4S|5|I bought this DVD just yesterday, and I have already watched through it twice. Whether you are a long time Pink Floyd fan, or a newbie, this will definitely satisfy both appetites. Gilmour is a master of the guitar, and his acoustic renditions of Pink Floyd classics prove it. Even though they aren't his own, Je Crois Entendre Encore and Hushabye Mountain are absolutely beautiful. He may be getting old, but David proves that his voice and guitar playing are still as strong as ever; with room to grow. I can't urge you enough to pick up this DVD. May you enjoy every second of this solo project, and, like me, hope that The Division Bell will NOT be the Pink Floyd's last effort as a group.
B00DJFIMW6|5|This game is absolutely amazing. There are no flaws the game never freezes or crashes. This game is very addictive but super fun!
080701429X|5|If your looking for an alternative theory to Freudians, this books is great!
B000W8HC8I|1|If you asked 10 different people in your department or business what is it that you do, how many different answers would you get?  If yours is like most organizations, you would probably get 10 different answers.  Jordan Belfort, his life, his decisions, his actions and his health represent one possible outcome to this question about how he viewed the financial services business.<br /><br />Like many who find their way to Wall Street, they become enthralled with the excitement of a trading room floor.  But Mr. Belfort clearly was more about &#34;sales&#34;, and he just happened to find himself within the financial services business.  His view of sales is an aggressive one, one that perhaps works part of the time for some people as we see in his story.  He generated lots of sales and money through what he built, but since what he built was based on intimidation and hype, it didn't last.  And because it was built on intimidation and hype, his body and self-control and self-respect imploded.  No person can carry such burdens without imploding, and that is exactly the story of Mr. Belfort.<br /><br />So why do you do what you do?  By contrast, consider some of the teachings of Simon Sinek (just google him) as he makes a case for focusing first on the why, then the how and then the what.  His thesis is that the more clear you are on this first, everything else falls in line.  I raise this comparison because it is in stark contrast to the story of Mr. Belfort.  His business and his life was not sustainable because Mr. Belfort's &#34;why&#34; was based on personal greed and ego.  The lesson in this perhaps is that long term success is not sustainable when one makes it all about him or herself, rather than others to which they serve.<br /><br />I did not like this book for how it represented the very worst side of people and our society.  But in contrast with other good bodies of work, such as Simon Sinek and Michael Lewis, we also see that when people are focused on doing good, their health, happiness and personal success is just as great.good, their health, happiness and personal success is just as great.
B00DHRLK84|3|Ok  movie.  Ending was a downer! I wasnt  expecting it to be like the book, but I thought it would  follow the storyline a little bit better.
B004EPYZQ2|4|This was a movie wonderfully directed and produced. The storyline was filled with nostalgia and excitement from an unexpected plot twist.
B007ZGO7EM|5|With the large numbers and function keys, this calculator beats the smaller versions hands down!  I won't be using any other version now that I have this app.
B006GLLREU|5|Love it!

B006DJ2JSI|5|I am a big reader and not too pround to look up the definition of a word. Always good to have no matter where I am..
B0084IG8TM|2|Update:<br /><br />Well it seems that no-one really cares about the poor quality control of the PRODUCT itself ([[ASIN:B0084IG8TM The Hunger Games [2-Disc DVD + Ultra-Violet Digital Copy]]) even though this seems to be a significant issue, with many copies being returned for replacement. I'll probably end up removing this review as it is so \\"unhelpful\\" ... ho, hum.<br /><br />Original Review:<br /><br />Firstly I am not reviewing the movie itself but the DVD as supplied by Amazon. It is noteworthy that many reviews were written many months before this DVD was even made available, which is interesting...<br /><br />So to the DVD. This was released on the 18th August and my daughter received her pre-ordered copy that very same day. So 5/5 to Amazon for speed of delivery, as usual.  However, when we went to play the DVD today it froze at about scene 12/13 and would not move on. Re-inserting the DVD made no difference, and cleaning had no effect.<br /><br />So, we are returning this to Amazon for a replacement, and my main comment is \\"Disappointing, poor quality control\\".<br /><br />And before you mark this as \\"unhelpful\\", dear reader, please consider that this at least is a review of the ACTUAL supplied DVD and the fact that it did not work for us, not some hastily composed text by a reviewer so desperate to be read that they actually wrote a review 4-5 months before the DVD actually existed!
B008Y1YJZY|5|I love this purchase and I would recommend it to any one to purchase this item for their fun and excitement!
B008K8VDPU|5|When I first got this game, I thought it was going to be a run of the mill piano game, but that is not the case. In this game you can look up practically every song in the world and then it shows you how to play it! Plus, you can play other instruments too
B00000K2SC|3|The matrix has a unique ( for a movie) storyline, but it is very poorly thought out. The concept has gaping loopholes in it ( why did the robotic intelligence bother with the VR if brain-dead bodies produce as much  electricity as normal ones?). Like stated below, the dialogue is simplistic  at best. I understand that most of the viewers are in for the eye-candy and  not the lingo, and I am not opting for the level of lingual sophistication  of the Murder on the Millennium Falcon ( a book, not film), but the  characters could have easily used just a tad bit more plain intelligence...  Another topic: the unecessary violence - just consider this:&quot; We are  going to save the humanity from a virtual prison - and now let's gun down  the twelve hundred guards that stand between us and that door!&quot; I  would have honestly liked the movie a great much better if the plot was  more styled toward th thrill and the mystery rather than the special  effects (all of which have been fully blown in the commercials - technicly,  if you've seen the commercials, you've seen the movie). Classic Hollywood  mindlessness.
