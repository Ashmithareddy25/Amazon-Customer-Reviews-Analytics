0920668372|5.0|The first time I read this to my little grandchildren they couldn't understand why I cried when I got to the last part.  They will someday.  I bought this book because it expresses just how a mother feels about her children.  (they will  always be cradled in her heart) This story is about a boy who grows to adulthood and his mother still cradles him until she reaches the stage in her life when she is sick and going to die.  He then cradles her in his arms.  I hope I don't have to wait till I'm ready to die before I see the later part of this story in my own life.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a great game and I love horses but cant have them due to living situation. this game brings out my love for them. love this game.
B00BMVTS1S|1.0|Instant Video kept stopping and would not recover<br /><br />The movie did look fantastic. until it stopped.............probably would have better off just downloading it.
B004ZN9YNC|1.0|Let me first say that I love Pink Floyd... But I have tried and tried and tried to listen to this album and I can never make it all the way through. Every song sounds like sorry half baked discards off of the Wall. There is no cohesive melody in any of the songs, Final Cut just meanders along in drowning waters. At this point it almost sounds like Floyd parodying themselves with Floydian gimmicks and lyrics. There is very little of the usual musical inventiveness going on here. This album is in pure cookie cutter mode.
B0076DELIG|4.0|The Harry Bosch series by Michael Connelly continues to be interesting, fast-paced, and the characters well developed and worth reading about as they age and evolve.
B009CF7GRY|4.0|This is a good remake of the original movie. would have given it a five but the picture quality during the dancing  wasn't top notch, but I enjoyed watching the movie. Would watch it again.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It's easy. a little boring, but keeps me busy during those &#34;what to do now&#34; moments. Go for it, you have nothing to lose except time.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|My book club and I thoroughly liked this book.. It was very different from the normal expectations of a Stephen King novel which was a nice surprise.
B00C0OOV5O|5.0|\\"This sorrowful life\\" is an emotional episode in which we can observe character development in a few people. During some scenes tear were streaming down my face specially at the end. I couldn't help crying as a baby because I felt as if it was my brother the one who turned into a zombie. It was just amazing!
0525953728|5.0|An interesting book of the first hand experience of the raid when they invaded the compound where Bin Ladan lived.
B003Z0D4S2|5.0|C'est tr&egrave;s diff&eacute;rent de tout ce que j'avais pu lire auparavant.  C'est d'une cr&eacute;ativit&eacute; incroyable.  Il nous faudrait plus d'auteurs de cette trempe.
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|Ian rankin is one of my favourite crime writers.  you can feel the cold Scottish weather ,the dark grimy streets,the horror of finding the body, and all the twists and turns along the way<br /><br />if you like crime novels ,this will be up there with the best
B007J4T2G8|4.0|.  C'est bien raconté et ce n'est pas vulgaire .  C'est probablement plus près de la réalité de bien des personnes quoi qu'on en pense.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|This one of the best twitter app!!  there is nothing wrong with the app!!!  Really fast too!!  I wish I could give the twitter app a 10 star ratting!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Never really got this title but I've heard great things. I returned this title and never got the chance to read it
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Watched 3 seasons in 10 days.  Can't wait for the next one, but will miss Matthew.  I highly recommend this show.
B005PZ85SO|3.0|I don't often get to see this show when it airs,  I also forget to DVR.  So I sometimes buy an episode.  Good inexpensive way to catch up.  Qaulity is good.  Price is right.
B009K0P10K|4.0|This is one of the best I have seen, great story line and the cast is one that keeps you comming back to watch again & again..!!
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|This is another fun, addictive free-to-play game, but with the added bonus of having great graphics and an attractive aesthetic.
B00BHNQ5XK|2.0|This move had its scary points, but overall I thought it was a huge disappointment. The plot was interesting, but throughout the movie it was very predictable. The fact that Ethan Hawke's character seemed clueless to obvious situations, and that he would never turn on a light in the house when he was freaking out made no sense. Worth a watch if you enjoy scary movies, but doubtfully going to be a favorite.
B007Z8ZKS2|5.0|I read this reluctantly and solely because of its 7-week lofty position on the NY Times bestseller list.<br /><br />I am not a fan of 'young adult', but John Boyne's 'The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas' changed my views. Around the time it came out and the ensuing hullabaloo, I resisted reading, but had to when I was asked to give a talk on Writing and 'The Boy...' in a local school. I was blown away by the story and never before or since have I come across such a powerful ending.<br /><br />'The Fault in our Stars' is the story of a doomed love affair between two teenagers who have terminal cancer. It encompasses all the awkward newness of first love, is beautifully written, heartbreaking and elevating at the same time.<br /><br />I believe I am hooked on 'Young Adult' fiction which has the power to cross into mainstream!
B00APJLFEG|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It had a great plot with a witty sense on humor. Adam Sandler and his normal crew of friends that are always included in his movies were funny and relevant. Overall I highly recommend this movie!
B00AP9RQE4|5.0|First, I am a confirmed and avid fan of the Vorkosigan saga.  Even though Miles barely appears in this episode, Ivan's adventure is fast paced and fascinating.  We see the satisfying end of a woman chasing career in a gradual realization of being in love with a woman he's already married.  The characters are so well developed you can almost forget that it's a work of fiction placed in the far future and far away from Earth.  If this is your first acquaintance with the Saga, it won't be your last!
B00BF11STU|4.0|This is an awesome movie! It was incredably interesting to see what all went in to finding Binladin. A must watch!
B00AHGSVKS|4.0|It had been years since I read Clarke's classic sf alien encounter novel.  It was as good as I remember.<br /><br />The one problem with the Kindle version that has been converted from the print version is a lack of extra spacing showing a change of topic/scene within a chapter.  Just an extra line of spacing would cue the reader that a new section of a chapter is starting.
B0049J0CTM|5.0|This movie is an instant classic! Its hillarious and fun! My kids love it and it is one of the movies that I dont mind if it's watched over and over.
B0074VA2T2|5.0|My son loves the book and can now play the game! Terrific design and great, intuitive approach to teaching little ones how to count.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Great movie! It was awesome to see a part of history that I knew little about. Very well directed and acted! It will keep you on the edge of your seat! I highly recommend it!
0988936402|5.0|The First Pillar (Everville, #1) by Roy Huff is a great blend of fantasy and teenage adventure with non-stop action. It will keep your nose in the book from the beginning until the last period.<br /><br />The storyline is well developed and easy to follow. The author did a great job of developing each new twist and building the excitement as you move through the story. The action was realistic and believable.<br /><br />I really like the character development. Roy Huff did an excellent job in developing the background of each of the characters which made them easy to relate to and follow. This was an easy story to put yourself into as an unseen supporting character.<br /><br />I really enjoyed reading The First Pillar (Everville, #1) by Roy Huff and I highly recommend this book to all readers.<br /><br />[Please note: I was given a free copy of this book in exchange for my honest review.]
B00BYOEMTQ|5.0|This movie did not dissapoint! It had the same look and feel as the Lord of the Rings. I was suprised that they are making it into three movies, but I look forward to seeing them as soon as they come out! A must watch if you are a LOTR fan or if you are new to the series. Great movie
1475972350|4.0|I was hooked on Time Killer from the first page to the last! It's a great quick read. Wicked, Gory, and Chilling. What more can you ask for!!
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|I was very leery about watching a movie with a talking teddy bear, but this movie was one of the funniest I've seen in a long time. It was done so well you actually believe Ted could be real! Not for the kids, but highly recommended for the all adults who want a good laugh!
B00BI5J9BC|5.0|My daughter told me I would cry. I don't cry at movies... but I did.  Fabulous.  So glad I purchased it so I can watch it again!
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Thought I knew how to play Bingo but the scoring was weird and very confusing. Could not see what my balance (cash) was and I was probably doing something wrong but didn't care for it at all.
B00B5HQL50|5.0|...and HOWEVER , this issa GREAT BOND FLICK for the franchise recognizing AGE of BOND , sort of :o) the vuluptuous geriatric ,M , judy dench character is kilt off ; so sad as she carried beauty , age and command well . the weenie character that replaces her is a \\"nay sayer\\" against bond that turns to full support . BOND becomes a \\"has-been\\" that redeems his character ; a good struggle . i think judy dench character did better with brosnan , however , that relationship is CLEARLY and carefully maintained to then end . craig works his best as i have seen .<br />  now the new younger \\"Q\\" is well explained to carry on . he actually improves on john cleese character and well carries on desmond lewelyn style . i was pulling for CLEESE humor , myself . still , the \\"kid\\" does very well and in fact grows well . all in all , a masterful work that for me , overall is the best of the lot.<br />  AH !! the new \\"moneypenny\\" and LOVELY skinny chick and strong character . even as an older fart having watched many bond movies , not all , but many , i am well pleased and look forward to more .<br />  many changes fitted well together . oh , the villain ?? freaky and believable . i'll leave him for YOU to discover ... oh yeah , he'll \\"weird you out\\" .
B00AGKH7K0|5.0|A friend of mine who managed a record store in Sydney and who had been a guitar tech and an A&R man in earlier careers once told me that Eric Burdon could sing the White Pages and make it sound great and was \\"serious rock n'roll\\". This is a whole lot better than the White Pages! Lots of standout tracks but absolutely love Memorial Day. Oh, and by the way, my friend was 100% right about this man's still stunning vocal capabilities. Last saw him live with The New Animals in Wollongong, Australia about 10 years ago and hope to get to see him live again sometime soon.Just buy it!
0783231202|5.0|Great depiction of the history of slavery in America.  Americans don't realize that there were many anti slave activists over 200 years ago.  This movie shows how slow we were to come of age since the Brit's had abolished it long before us! We still have to stomp out ignorance in particular regions of this country.
B00BVZB0FM|5.0|This show really takes off in it's second season. the borgias were a interesting group and this show does them justice. The scheming for both good and bad are here and the Borgias did stand up for the poor and it's shown here. For all of the popes phlllandering the papacy could have done a lot worse than him at the time.  This season  is even better than the first one and frankly as much as I like the other show 'borgia' this one is much better and less about rumours and more about the a solid story of the middle ages. I watched this on intant video and therefore had it streamed to me. SO I can't comment on the dvd or blu ray. In had this show looks great streaming though. The actors really have fallen into character too. Jeremy Irons has become the controversial pope so well that it's hard to imagine anyone else doing it better. I do like the Borgia cast though. Although in season one they killed off Juan and borgias is smart enough not to go that route. (this show also does not have cesare kill him off etc).  There isn't a dull moment watching this cast eat up the scenery as the borgias. And he Borgias were a great subject to pick for a series to be sure.
B0004Z33EG|4.0|Entertaining but commercial.  It does depict the small town ignorance that existed then and still does exist.  Just leave the man alone!
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|I thought this was an excellent movie. It covers a span of ten years so it take a two and half hours to tell the tale. And what a story it is. This movie is not for those who are expecting an action movie with lots of explosions and gunfights. Although there is action for the most part it's the riveting story of the work done by the CIA in tracking down UBL. For those who found it boring it's better that they stick to movies like G.I. Joe.
B00785P2QC|4.0|It's. Fairly enjoyable for a free game. Of course people will complain about the purchasing of content to help advance the game but it honestly isn't necessary to buy anything to play this game. Not nearly as bad as farmville or anything stupid like that
1451648537|5.0|The book gave an excellent view of a brilliant, difficult, unusual man who changed the way we live.  I now understand the meaning of genius.
B009KEN87O|5.0|retro style graphics, retro style game play...fun game!  It reminds me of Galiga, Space invaders, and Asteroids, with hints of Star Wars<br />. Play it!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I can only imagine how funny the movie is after reading this book. Pat is a character you can't help but like and feel for...makes the story what it is. Great work, Mr. Quick.
0783225903|4.0|That's about the only way to describe this movie.  By the end of it, you feel like you've just witnessed the main character descending into a psychotic break.
B0018AM1YY|5.0|How do you not give Neil Young five stars, he is one of the best and all for less than $3.  Thanks Amazon,
B00A89ITZG|5.0|A must have for any endurance athlete. There is so much knowledge cramped together into one little book. This one combined with the upcoming Subtle Leopard from Brian's friend Kelly Starett and you will avoid so much physical pain in your life it's ridiculous!
B00BF123WG|5.0|I was hesitant to watch this movie because of the subject matter. Once the movie started I was able to overlook some of the rough scenes that I was dreading. In spite of this, I was riveted. Each scene was more apprehensive than the last creating an atmosphere of anxiety which kept you glued to the screen.The director, the story, the score and most importantly: the actors made this a fantastic watch. Do watch it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the greatest game i have ever played in my life. It is a great game. You should play it right NOW!!!!!!!
B00B99KJR0|4.0|It just needs a summary before each leg of the world to explain what it is you need to accomplish and what the symbols mean.
B002JODPSO|5.0|I loved the plot and the story that was played out. It was exciting. I always receive my product on time and in the shape I expect.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Details the dilemma for parents when their love for their child conflicts with the reality of the child's actions. A tragedy.
B0013WJGJ0|5.0|Micheal Keaton was the best Batman of all and Jack Nicolson as the Joker made to movie as close as you can get to the original comic charaters.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|Haven't maxed out my great white yet but I can't everything...jelly fish, nothing.<br />Other than that, it's pretty much a fun game.
B001FVD65O|5.0|Having Samual L Jackson added made this one of the better ones in the series of sequels. Recommended for anyone.
B00AIUUXHC|2.0|loved this game, almost had the great white unlocked, but then the game reset itself. now it resets all the time so I can never advance. very disappointing and frustrating. if it wasn't for the glitches I would give it 5 stars.
B0074MZSPO|5.0|I recently purchased this album on vinyl and have not stopped playing it for several weeks now!  The guitar work is very rich and well recorded and mixed, and her vocals are incredible.  The band sounds a lot like the Black Keys and then add in Brittany's soulful voice and it is magical!  Can not recommend this album enough.  Every song is good, and on vinyl, the sound quality is amazing.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|One of the best movies of the decade.  It kept us on the edge of our seats.  I  highly recommend it.
B0049VZ222|5.0|what can we say??? this is where it all begins...if you dare to watch this one you'll get hooked on the suspense and adventures of the characters and have to own them all! Trust! once you get started you'll enjoy the actors. great cast and each character will have you wanting more... Don't want to spoil the suspense for anyone! Great adult thrilling entertainment and the FX are superb! supper splatterville!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Ths was an amazing move.  Denzel Washington portrayed accurately an alcohol/addict.  Hard to watch at times but very powerful. Great movie.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really enjoyed these books!  Not just because of explicit sexual  parts but for the well rounded main characters, Christian and Ana.  Some times it was easy to predict what was going to happen next and it felt like book two and three were the same book.  But overall I loved this trilogy.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|A game that can keep you busy til you have to recharge your Kindle. Young and old will love this. Colorful and exciting to get the extra coin and the gifts and it,s free.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|love the choices of sounds and the night timer!  I cant stand to sleep ehennits quiet!!!  Thunderstorms and rain soothe and lull me to sleep!

B008K8VDPU|5.0|Well since it is required to write it here, I repeat Iove it!!! it is so much fun, even though
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My grandboys love this one. I left them pick this and download. They download alot of the games. I should let them write a review. I'm sure they would say they love, love this one.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Was a great book. Hot sex sences. Great characters. Eva's father is very cool. I like that the it kinda warped up at the story but kept it open for next book.
0810993139|5.0|Awesome Book series for my 8 yr old.  He loves reading these books., and it incourages him to read.  They are cute story lines for this age group, and i often catch him smiling and laughing as he reads thru this cute book!
0821210920|4.0|Great book with many ideas to use, also we like the pictures taken by Mr. Adams. Plus looks nice on coffee table
B003SI3URQ|4.0|I like the idea of instant watch, but honestly this movie was extremely pixilated when I tried to project it onto my tv. It was really hard to enjoy it when all I could see was stretched pixels.
B0084B5TK8|4.0|The book was a captivating read right from the beginning. It was so full of detail that I almost felt like I was there with them.
B0095XPZBC|4.0|I love this series and have been a fan for a while. However when they transferred this into blu-ray format they did not completely make this into 1080p format. Some scenes are very clear while others are snowy like. I think it was for a quick buck from the the fans who love this show. The majority of the transfer is in 1080p but you will definitely notice the scenes that weren't. All in all I was still happy with my purchase and can't wait for season 3 to come down in price.
B005PK56TA|4.0|Love this show. Me and a friend started watching this at work one night and went thru 7 episodes in a row! I am hooked. Highly recomend, but inly if u are Not scared easily hahaha
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|Kept me on the edge of my seat, especially the last 45 minutes. I'm not surprised that it won as many awards as it did.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Some of these reviewers on here are so damn sensitive good grief!!! Enjoy it for what its worth, it is a great story with plenty great acting, humor and violence which in my book is a recipe for excellence! Quentin is a genius!! I will definitely be buying this on blu ray!
B00BI73CVI|3.0|The quality of the movie was poor some of the time. In others, it was quite decent. I would expect more quality for rental movie for 5 bucks.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Jeff Kinney put a lot of effort into this book I hope you make movie for it and please continue to make the diary of a wimpy kid series. I love the diary of a wimpy kid series <3
B001U7B4T8|1.0|I will read reviews in the future, this dvd is not close to the complete concert I remember seeing on pbs 20 years ago. I dont believe the producers were allowed to even sell this! Poor quality pic and sound....
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|I like this game because it is a strategy game, it's really hard at some points but it's also easy at some points so it's a good game.I really like it and I hope you do to. Please $ this game,you or your children will love it. P.s., it's not a good game for ages 4 and under.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great free calculator with many functions.  I never have problems with it.  Nice and large display makes it easy to operate.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesomeness and can be used to make a KINDLE FIRE the most played advice in the world try this game out TODAY NOT TOMORROW MORNING OF TOMORROW NIGHT
B0052AC8C6|4.0|What a unique take on a several movie types-- as our green chameleon moves from an introvert wanting greater things but afraid to reach out-- to discovering the hero in all of us. The standard characters in the western; this will also remind you of the famous movie with Jack, China town. The characters make the story-- you know the plot-- you know who is good and who is bad.But it is the acting and characterizations that make this a very enjoyable movie.
B008I34ZQG|5.0|I only got to see Frank Zappa once and it was around the time<br />this (ALBUM) come out and loved it and still have it.Well that was<br />before CD'S and i loved this one and saw it on CD and had to get.<br />  I had a couple cd's of ZAPPA and thought i would try this one out<br />and happy i got it because it sounds great on cd and for you that<br />like Frank Zappa you can't go wrong with this one.
B00973DDN2|3.0|When the Killers were apart for two years or more, I was hoping when they returned their album would be like Hot Fuss. Something strong. The reason people like the Killers is for songs like \\"Somebody Told Me\\" and \\"Mr. Brightside\\". It's the energy in their sound. To evolve away from the sound that people love is not going to sell songs. Battleborn is too different. At their recent shows people wait to hear the above songs and cheer. The newer songs are ok.I love the Killers but I know I speak for many die hard Killer fans.
B009DT98RK|5.0|I have been a Frampton fan all my life and he was the first person i saw in<br />concert,more than 35 years ago,just before the Frampton Comes Alive and<br />have seen him many times since than.He puts on great shows and love to<br />hear all his songs both old and new.<br />  I had just found out about this FCA 35 TOUR: EVENING WITH PETER<br />FRAMPTON [BLUE RAY] and had to get it.With this you get around 2 hours<br />45 minutes of the complete FRAMPTON COMES ALIVE,then some of his<br />new songs.I am very happy i got it because it is a great show,like he has been<br />doing all these years,with great sound+picture and well worth it.<br />  I have both the Frampton Comes Alive II and the concert in Detroit DVD,<br />but i must say this is the best one of them.Its great to have it in BLUE RAY<br />and if you are a old fan of his,or anyone who is new with him,you cant go<br />wrong with this one.<br /><br />  PS: The last time i saw Frampton in concert was in 2009 and didn't think.<br />With the help of this BLUE RAY show i found out about Bob Mayo (RIP)<br />  I didn't know he had past away and we all lost a great keyboard,guitar+<br />vocalist.We all miss YOU and will never forget YOU.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|Just too boring for words... Poor story line... Ends abruptly with no real climax or captivating hook to make you want more... Waste of $3.99...
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love the game because I like to slegshot the birds.  the fun part is the birds go CRAZY that's why I love the game and I like to slegshot them far.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is one of the best shows currently on TV and the price to watch the past episodes at less than $2 per episode is well worth it.  The ease of bringing up the shows each time is great.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Wow just wow. I watched this video Saturday and promptly purchased both of his albums. What a depth of meaning that shows a man poured his heart and soul into his music. I am just awed by the lyrics and how they are delivered by Rodriguez. I feel that something was held from my youth by not being exposed to his music like people in Europe and Australia were. There is nothing but emptiness thinking of what could have been for the most humble musician that had an amazing skill that should have have been kept from generations of Americans. Thank you to those that pursued this and eventually created this video for us to watch.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The action in this book is incredible, and was an easy read. Great job in writing this book. If you are considering this book, read it!
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Among the precedents that George Washington set was the orderly transition of power from one president to the next.  As he handed over the presidency, Washington also became the first former president.  He and John Adams became the only two members of an exclusive club--those who know what it means to have the power, privileges, and burdens of an American president.  This book is the history of this club and its members.  Using examples from the near and distant past, Gibbs and Duffy illustrate three key aspects of the Presidents Club.  They are personal relationships, protecting the office of the presidency, and supporting the actions of the current president.<br /><br />The club is about relationships between the current president and those who have gone before.  Serving presidents have the counsel and comfort of others who know where the buck stops and how it feels to shoulder this burden.  Former presidents have the opportunity to remain relevant and influence national affairs.  Most have accepted a behind-the-scenes role, avoiding the dangers of upstaging the current president.  Jimmy Carter could be an exception.  Richard Nixon advised a succession of presidents in an admitted campaign to redeem himself from the national embarrassment of Watergate.<br /><br />The club also protects the office of the presidency.  Most former presidents avoid criticizing the current president, exercise restraint in their friendships with foreign leaders, and generally remain in the background.  Most presidents have responded by respecting former presidents' decisions and concern for their place in history.  \\"However much presidents may disagree with their predecessors on the value of an ally or the danger of an enemy, they are acutely conscious of being the custodians of American credibility.\\"  Gerald Ford was doing more than protecting one man when he pardoned Richard Nixon.  Less well known is the candid advice he gave Bill Clinton about the Monica Lewinsky scandal.  He did both for the same reason.<br /><br />Former presidents serve directly by undertaking senior diplomatic missions and performing other leadership and ceremonial roles.  Hoover's experience leading our country during the Great Depression made him the ideal choice to organize post-WWII relief efforts in Europe.  Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter have undertaken a number of humanitarian missions together, turning a mutual animosity into friendship in the process.  The club's history contains many such examples of post-presidential service.<br /><br />This book documents a range post-presidential behavior.  Some of it is dark.  \\"Over five years, across three continents, through two presidential campaigns, Richard Nixon and Lyndon Johnson played one of the great political chess matches of all time; great because the stakes were so high, the moves so complex-- and because both sides cheated.\\"  And both concealed a great deal from the public.  The relationship between George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton was more positive and more public.  \\"Through the ages, the Presidents Club has seen its share of rivalries, alliances, even some true friendships. But no relationship is quite like the bond between George H. W. Bush and the man who defeated him in 1992. The connection surprised both men, and astonished many of their longtime aides. Bush would go so far as to suggest more than once that he might be the father that Clinton had always lacked-- a notion that the younger man did not dispute.\\"<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone seeking greater understanding of American presidents.  Readers can learn much from members of one of our hidden institutions.  Satisfied readers may also enjoy Rubenzer and Raschingbauer's [[ASIN:B005CWHLDA Personality, Character, and Leadership In The White House: Psychologists Assess the Presidents]].th for the same reason.<br /><br />Former presidents serve directly by undertaking senior diplomatic missions and performing other leadership and ceremonial roles.

But no relationship is quite like the bond between George H. W. Bush and the man who defeated him in 1992. The connection surprised both men, and astonished many of their longtime aides. Bush would go so far as to suggest more than once that he might be the father that Clinton had always lacked-- a notion that the younger man did not dispute.\\"<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone seeking greater understanding of American presidents.  Readers can learn much from members of one of our hidden institutions.  Satisfied readers may also enjoy Rubenzer and Raschingbauer's [[ASIN:B005CWHLDA Personality, Character, and Leadership In The White House: Psychologists Assess the Presidents]].
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|Movies are supposed to help forget about your troubles and either inspire or entertain you. This movie got progressively worse by the minute and went beyond crass with children dropping and being subjected to F bombs galore. Not sure if it was intended to be a comedy or drama but it was not funny more mean spirited than anything and left me feeling horrible about raising children and being married. I usually love Paul Rudd and think he's witty but this movie was just awful.
B004Q3SGNK|4.0|I had to turn away at the cutting, but the if anyone had a chance to survive, fate picked the perfect guy. He was in his home away from home. If it was you or me, forget about it.
B001FVV2X2|4.0|I enjoy Science Fiction, and I love smart aleck characters. This series combines both. Some characters just grow on you.<br /><br />Unfortunately the playback on Amazon Instant Video was very unreliable. Sometimes it worked well, then sometimes not at all. It would get choppy, restart itself, or just refuse to play. Annoying,
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|I was practically falling asleep. The villian had a legit gripe, M or W or what ever her name is, hung him up. This isn't anything like wanting to take over the world. Plus M or W or what ever her name is, had way to much screen time. Where are the bond girls? The old ones are so much more fun, more campy, more sexy, more clever lines, writing, and witty glances. But as I said, perhaps I just wasn't in the right mood.
B00BI73CVI|1.0|I love musicals, but this one was so boring. Just stop singing already! I've never been so happy to see characters die.
B006INDGFE|1.0|and missed the  surprise and &#34;just the right amount of whackiness&#34; in the original. I'm no prude, but there were a few parts I just didn't need to see.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Love all the temple runs and this is just as good.  Graphics are awesome. The grandkids love playing it too.
B008M721MS|1.0|doesn't work on my Kindle Fire.  Of course it was free to try, but a waste of time.  Maybe next time.
B00270WH3Y|5.0|I have this downloaded to my mp3 player and enjoy listening to the music as I go around the track.
B002M87V0A|5.0|My husband really wanted to share this movie with our kids. The kids were not so sure, preferring more modern kid oriented movies, but they have not stopped singing the songs since we watched it. It was a lot of fun.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I didn't believe how much this app had in store. The graphics are good, the jobs are realistic and fun, and you get this and more for FREE!!! 5 stars. Get it!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game it is hard but fun. I recemend this game to people that like tire games. bye........  I love this game
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is a really fun game. I love that I can tip and turn the cube any which way! But, I can be addicting!
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|I rented this title just because I like the actor and had some time to kill. It was an OK movie, but one I would not buy. I would watch it again if I had the time and it was free.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|so cool highly recommend this app love love love. it but when energy runs out its hard to get some more unless u have a lot of money
B006RJTEIC|5.0|I saw this as a prime member of Amazon instant..instant view ..quality great..story is great..thanks Amazon.I will view more instant videos ..it is great
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|When I started with the first book of the Hunger Games I was so<br />disappointed that it was a trilogy.  But I could not put any of the<br />books down.  I was caught up with all the characters. Although<br />I could not put the Kindle down I am glad that it finally did end.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Everyone told me this movie was incredible, so much so that I thought I was bound to be disappointed. I was not. It was amazing! The visuals are truly stunning. This is definitely a movie you want to get in 3D if that's an option for you. Very, very, very beautiful!
B0053TMP24|5.0|recommended by a friend.  really enjoyed the series.  own them all.  looking forward to RR next book about Hades and the Underworld
B000001FFJ|5.0|I don't have a lot of Tom Waits albums (not yet anyway) but Rain Dogs is the one that I listen to most often and I love it from start to finish. It is a tour de force both lyrically and musically and everything works. It's also strong enough to listen to in one setting and you won't skip any tracks. To the uninitiated, the most well known song would be \\"Downtown Train\\" which Rod Stewart would later have a big hit with in a fine version. Everything is great, whether it's a tearful ballad like \\"Hang Down Your Head\\" or \\"Time\\", a swinging jazz tune like \\"Big Black Mariah\\" or the instrumental \\"Midtown\\", or just something oft-kilter (\\"Cemetery Polka\\", \\"Singapore\\", \\"Gun Street Girl\\" among others). A lot of different instruments here too, it's certainly not the piano in the bar sound of Closing Time or Small Change (also great albums). When you're a restless music lover, eventually you turn to Tom Waits. When you do, this is the first one to pick up.
B005POK858|5.0|This is a nice, retro turn-based RPG for those of us who are nostalgic for the Super NES era.  There are a couple of levels of difficulty to choose from and I was able to complete in 12 hrs without too much grinding. Gameplay can continue after you beat it if you want to go back and get all the treasure.<br /><br />Worth the price,  though I'm pretty sure I got it for $3.99 awhile back.
B0023AO5JC|5.0|Old but very clever movie.A young Peter Lorre was masterful as the child killer.They should re-make this movie.I truly enjoyed this movie.
B003DBOS7Y|5.0|My daughter had told me repeatedly to watch this movie. She knew I would love it. She was correct; wonderful movie.
B002ZG976U|5.0|Awsome movie made me laugh kept me entertained from the beginning till the end. I would recomend it to everyone I know.
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|Too much bad language and the ending was really weird. The film could have been much better but unfortunately it was not.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|The best thing about it is that the trilogy is in one nice piece, great quality. A must have for this movie fans
B007REV4T8|4.0|Very exciting movie. Daniel Craig is the best James Bond yet. Too bad M met her demise in this piece.
B00ANVX6DY|4.0|My daughter loves this movie!! Her name is Sofia also, which makes her feel so identified with this movie. For all the ones asking for the tiara, it is inside the activity book that came with the dvd. You actually have to make it and I love this because we worked together. Great buy. Also in so many languages. For us spanish and english. Highly recommended.
B00AZNEW5G|4.0|If you liked the movie you'll like this. Jessica Chastain is solid as the CIA operative and keeps the whole thing going. Probably how it all went down.
B000002UBU|5.0|Earthy, and deep music. Don Mclean's lyrics are colorful and paint a picture in your mind like a good book.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|After hearing so many people chatting about this show, I decided to purchase the first season on DVD to see what all the excitement was about.  The very first episode opens up on the day of the Titanic sinking.  Unfortunately the heir to Downton Abbey was on the ship.  You start out being drawn into the story of what will happen next and who is the next closest heir that the family has never met.  After one episode, I went ahead and bought the 2nd and 3rd seasons.  Every episode lasts approximately 50 minutes.  You are exhausted after each show as there is so much going on with all the characters.  You get so involved in their relationships and the history around them that you forget it is only a 50 minute show.  Each one could easily be a two hour movie.  Each show seems to end on a cliffhanger, so I'm glad that I have the whole season and can immediately watch the next one.  I would highly recommend this series to anyone who loves British television, early 1900s history, and Regency romance.
B004CEUEWE|5.0|I found the childhood friends as second generation armed robbers angle one that had not really been explored on film before.  It also comes across naturally that the kingpin might be a low-key small business owner and that the most talented robber might gradually fall in love with a former hostage (partly because he's looking for an excuse to take a pile of cash and sneak out of Boston forever as the feds are hot on their trail.)  The final heist is one of the more creative on film.
B001OSIV62|3.0|What I liked about this movie is that it's based on a true story. This guy new what he wanted.
B00AE2J5HI|3.0|Since this is a true story, I would have liked a little more background detail on the 3 bootlegging brothers, mob villains, and especially the mixed loyalties of the local lawmen.  What we end up with are somewhat cliched stereotypes of macho southern tough guy posturing and an inhumanly brutal mob.  Neither elicits much sympathy as money seems to be their only motive.  On the plus side, the sets, locations, costumes, and music are superb enough to make it worth watching once.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I hope they make a number 2 of it. You unlock more species when you open up more land. I would get this game it is soooo fun
B00BESM14U|4.0|Being from this generation, many of these characters rang true (although the Rocky Horror crowd were and are too freaky for me.)  There are always kids who hate the confinement and rules of cliques that end up friends by default.  My only complaint is the perspective should have focused less on peripheral characters and much deeper on the shy freshman bookworm, as his story is seldom if ever told.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Loved the second installment of this series. I can't wait to continue with the next to see where the story takes me.
0978545095|5.0|A must have. This is one of the most amazing stories, and the woman's talent is huge. Just hit add to cart.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is awesome but there is no redstone or endermen plus it doesn't have the nether but this is a awesome game to play
B00BHU9DUK|1.0|I could only make it through the first 30 minutes before I turned it off.  It was done in a very odd way.  It was shot as a movie but done in play form, so it was really hard to get into it either as a play or a movie.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I appreciate learning what the next life would be like and Dr. Alexander does a great job describing the general feeling of over-whelming sence of love, which he experienced.  His being a nerosurgeon made his experience even more believable because a lot of what he experienced ran contrary to what he was taught as a doctor.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|After reading lots of negative reviews, I expected to be let down. But instead I thought it was very well done and look forward to the other two films. I would think that Hobbit and LOTR fans would be very pleased.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Old school fun, feels like I'm back at the arcade with a pocket full of quarters about to embark on an alien hunt!
B003UESJF6|5.0|Shipped fast, it was on time, the movie wasn't scratched and the movie worked perfectly! What more could you ask for!!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I had read the book some years back and enjoyed it.  The movie was fabulous.  I watched it three time.
B004G600A4|5.0|Shipped fast, it was on time, the movie wasn't scratched and the movie worked perfectly! What more could you ask for!!
B0090EHVMC|5.0|Ordered this for my granddaughter, age 5, to watch.  She really enjoyed it and watched it three times.  She planned to tell her classmates about it for show and tell the next day.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|Shipped fast, it was on time, the movie wasn't scratched and the movie worked perfectly! What more could you ask for!!
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|dug it! spooky, very aptly titled, ethan hawke was great! the score was also excellent, lending itself perfectly to the tone of the movie
B006MW3V6U|5.0|this is my favorite show.  I watched the 2 seasons in 1 week before the third started but now I miss it.
B009IQ1HBI|4.0|I sampled one of the cuts from this album before it came out and enjoyed it so much, I checked out the rest of the album. Love her sound.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|its better than temple run!  you should totally get it. and its free!!! don't think about getting it, just get it!!!
B00BEPVAV8|1.0|what is the coad???? please tell me? ??? how do you do it!????????? then I will change the rating than.
1933952806|4.0|This covers it all, and a lot better than the manual that Nikon sends with the camera. He breaks it all down and has recommendations based on his experience.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I live in Alaska and I couldn't find this combo pack for less than $50. Thoroughly hooked on this brilliant program and the blu-ray makes it even better
0525478817|5.0|Awesome book.  Just finished and want to read again (for those who have read the book, how ironic is that).  Tragic and funny at the same time.  Witty, deep, poignant and insightful about facing cancer.  Very character driven with fun, smart banter as well as honest dialogue about how they feel dealing with cancer.<br /><br />Must read.  Clear you calendar to read and while reading have a large box of Kleenex at your side.
B00992CF6W|5.0|i have it on my iphone but i used instaullous to purchase it but its too much money :( why!!!!!!
B005HSL626|4.0|this game is a great way to waste time if you have it to waste.  It keeps you engaged in a mindless activity while you're waiting for important stuff.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Liked the lack of pandering to the to the viewer and the fact it just told a realistic story about interesting people.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Awesome! Eric Blehm does an outstanding job sharing with us the story of a larger than life warrior, Adam Brown. From his toubled youth to qualifying for DEVGRU, this excellent account of \\"fear to faith\\" is a must read. As a fellow warrior I salute Eric's efforts. You won't be able to put this one down, highly recommended.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|great product!!!<br />why cant we we we we we we we leave a short response??? why? why? why? why why ?
1451695195|2.0|I was so looking forward to reading this book. I'm not a neurosurgeon so all of the medical jargon mumbo-jumbo really distracted me. Personally, I think Dr. Alexander just wanted to put all the big words he knows into a book. Very disappointing.
B00006LFGD|5.0|Very good CD.  I am really enjoying all of the duets that Barbra sings...especially those with Judy Garland --- very classy!
B0028KF4ME|4.0|The show seemed to be failing itself last season, but a much better performance. Not quite back up to full swing but plenty of time to get there...
B00973902K|5.0|Very good song!  This song caught my attention over the Summer and just fewll in love with it! It rocks!
B0034G4P80|5.0|This is a great action movie. A little romance, lots of smashing of things which keeps my husband awake. Just a fun movie
1449410243|5.0|Verrrrry funny!  And so true about some aspects of cat behaviour! But not our wee cat's conduct. He is not to plotting kill us....probably! But he is going to the vet tomorrow so that could all change.
B005IZLPKQ|4.0|Watching this movie helped make the Avengers make more sense. It was a fun action movie that I could watch with grand kids. I appreciate a movie with action but not gore, no terrible language and no explicit sex.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|The phones connected right to our mixer board and the sound of the music was absolutely great. The sound man was very pleased. Great product.
0307588343|5.0|We sleepwalk, skim-reading the complexities of life, transfixed by our own micro-bubbles of the everyday. Just once, in a fleeting existence, a book comes along which grabs you by the lapels and offers a lightning strike of insight into an otherwise murky world. Larry McDonald's insider record of the collapse of Lehman Brothers (written with Patrick Robinson) does just that! An uncomfortable yet fascinating factual thriller, McDonald and Robinson take us on a darkly comedic,surreal and often shocking drive through the realities of the recent economic calamity. From mortgage mania, insane housing bubble and leveraged buyouts to daisy chains of credit default swaps disappearing up the backside of the global economic system, McDonald's expose is compelling. The book is a must read for any economics student who gambled their future on some limp-structured, self-serving, ideal academic model, or anyone interested at all in how our financial world - read 'our world' - is actually organised and operated
B008B0UIVW|5.0|Like every other one of Lauren Weisberger's books it was a total page turner and I could not put it down!  It was fantastic!
B007MCTTHY|5.0|Love this game. It really tests you logic and problem solving skills. My only complaint is that there weren't enough &#34;books&#34;. I solved everything in a couple of days and was left wanting more.
B001KT6JPA|4.0|I don't write much, can I just say its an okay continuance of the Hannibal L. story. To say more overqualifies my abilities.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|This is simply photographic poetry in motion. Beautiful film that is not for everyone but everyone can relate to the emotions of the characters. Words really cannot describe how extraordinary this film is and so i will no long try, but leave you with this. Watch it now!
B006LSZECO|3.0|It was a good book but not among my top list.  Hard to understand how it could be on the best seller list so long.  In my opinion it was just ok not a blockbuster.
B004KRQFI0|5.0|This is how you drop bass! This is some of the best EDM music ever. This kid is a musical master. A must own for any fan of EDM music or just music in general.
B005IA9JZO|5.0|Kids movie with adult overtones, enjoyable to sit and watch a couple of times.  Dustin Hoffman plays a good part as the evil Capt'n Hook.
B000VZUM5C|5.0|I owned this when it came out on vinyl.  Now that I can listen at will, its GREAT.  I would recommend this cd to any and anyone.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|3-25-13 -- Flow Free involves making connections, a process common in life and in brains, which may account for the fascination of this game.  If you like organizing things and solving problems, I think you will enjoy this colorful app.  It looks simple at first, but the levels become more challenging so it never gets boring.
B00A9X9ORI|1.0|Don't waste your time, this movie was boring.  I wish someone had told me not to waste my time.  It has a boring plot and took too long for any action.  Ending was ridiculous, even for this type of movie.
B0088P2A7A|4.0|3-25-13 -- I use Wikipedia frequently online.  For looking up words it is faster than a dictionary or thesaurus.  I highly recommend it for anything you want to know, and I find it well worth contributing a few dollars to Wikipedia when they have a fundraising drive to support the volunteers who run it.<br />UPDATE:  I just noticed they have started using BCE and CE instead of BC and AD for historical dates.  I find this totally idiotic, so I took off one star.  If Wikipedia intends to make it a \\"policy\\" (rather than the occasional dim author), regretfully I may not donate again, because the change makes no sense.  An online poll shows that 67% prefer BC and AD, meaning Before Christ and After Death.  I do not find this offensively religious; it simply denotes a historical fact.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Seriously, buy this. Great old school gaming at it's best. Good level variety. The only downside is waiting for more content once you have beaten the game.
B005J7K964|3.0|The original Metropolis is a 5 star classic for sure.<br />This version released by Kino, is shortened, added a new score and new music by popular artists at the time of its 1984 release, and used colour tinting.<br />This idea worked, as it got younger folks interested in the film.<br />The restoration of this version on the blu-ray is darn good, and the disco/rock soundtrack sounds superb.<br />Also included is rare documentary called \\"The Fading Image\\", a trailer, a gallery, and personal message from Girgio Moroder (printed on the insert)<br />Overall, I enjoyed this updated (at the time) version well enough, but can't hold a candle to the classic original[[ASIN:B0040QYROK The Complete Metropolis [Blu-ray]]], also availble from Kino.
B00005JMJ4|3.0|Movie was different than expected - it wasn't great and it wasn't horrible so rated it okay! Bill Murray was in more serious role and that was odd for me.
B005X5XIL0|5.0|I bought this concert for my girl friend's mother. She is in an assisted living facility. She loved it and has watched it many times.Can't put a value on that.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love it I wanted to play it for a while later getting it on my new laptop but the only issue is the wifi for multiplayer don't work maybe fix it and let it be like the real game C:
B000TU16GS|4.0|This is a great book for kids of around ten.  The hero is 14, and he is truly heroic -- brave, smart, technology savvy.  The bad guys are truly bad, and there are some hair-raising escape scenes.  The plot moves so fast that the coincidences and improbabilities fly right by a young reader eager to suspend disbelief. Adults will prefer Horowitz's House of Silk, Horowitz's Sherlock Holmes mystery.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app runs and looks great on my Kindle Fire.  You can make in app purchases but it is not necessary to play the game so far.
B006ID6NDQ|4.0|This was different than most Holocaust books.  This one has a unique twist and shows this woman's struggle to survive despite deplorable and inhumane circumstances.
B005K17RU0|1.0|I got this app because of the high ranking and after reading some of the great reviews replacing a different weather app that was less User friendly. I did like this one until a resent update by the developers (3-23-2013) and was considering purchasing the &quot;Pro &quot; version. Well that thought went down the tubes with this NEW VERSION.... IT 'S TERRIBLE! Why did you people feel the need to mess with a good thing when you have it going? I will be finding another Wx app and sending this one to the junk pile... So sad....
B004CLYKLI|5.0|Though this is not the way I raised my family, I admired<br />Amy Chua's explanations and her style of writing.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved it!  I usually read 500 pages a week and ended up reading all three volumes in a single weekend.  I didn't want it to end.
B004X0XA82|2.0|I feel like you have to be in a certain frame of mind to listen to this album unlike the Fleet Foxes self-titled album that demanded attention at first listen especially for the first four songs then gradually faded. I have had this album downloaded for more than 2 months and have started  to listen to it on multiple occasions but I have yet to get close to finishing it before switching to something else. Disappointing for the amount of hype the album got and I like most of their stuff.
B00005R87Q|5.0|This movie is made up a great 1 liners and stupid hooked up cars.  Pure entertainment your ashamed to enjoy.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|I deserve a prize for watching this entire movie.<br />If you have high task commitment and can not easily stop a movie before the end, don't start this one.<br />I was tricked by reading it was like \\"Knocked Up II\\" and \\"hilarious,\\" but it is NOT like Knocked Up and it is NOT hilarious or even funny one time. I wish movie sell blurbs had to be 1% true.<br /><br />People have said the story is depressing, but it is very much the storytelling that is depressing. Attempts at making the main characters quirky fails. Characters are supposed to feel lost or make you feel depressed about their midlife-esque marital crisis, but it is pointless, disjunct, aimless and story-less. If it were any other product, I would ask for a refund.<br /><br />I've learned my lesson about watching movies before reading reviews.

B005LAIIQC|5.0|I would encourage anyone to upgrade their older VHS or DVD movies to at least Bluray 2D quality (3D for those who have 3D grade TV’s) as the quality of the picture is 100% better then VHS tapes and nearly 50% better then DVD's. The sound quality has been improved and upgraded as well. Most Blu-ray’s have many more features that can be viewed as well which make for a much fuller movie experience too!

B001MTENOC|1.0|Take every movie, TV show and book about the afterlife and that is what you get in this collection of sessions.  The corporate organization of Heaven presented here makes the reader want to do as many implants as possible to stay alive. The ideas have been around for a long time and people are presenting them under hypnosis.  if it would that easy to get to heaven, everyone would be in hypnotherapy.  Sorry, this book doesn't pass the smell test. I have no doubt that his clients said all those things, it is just the fact that there is nothing new in any of the cases. The hypnotherapist is leading the questions making it little more than a the clients regurgitating ideas that have been around for a long time and the hypnotherapist as a thrilled listener building his own ideas of the afterlife..
B008M34INW|5.0|I loved it. However, I wish it would have been available in a Blu-ray version so the color and clarity would have been better.
B007SGM084|5.0|The story is beautiful and wonderful and well as thrilling and exciting. The scenes make you excited and take your breath away. Falling in Christian and Ana and getting lost in their love,  I missed the their story after I was done. Hoping the author continues on the more of Christian and Ana. Would tell everyone to ready the amazing story!

(A collecting tip: always go for playsets with lots of tiny pieces because those are the ones kids lose and will be looking for in 20 years). It's bright and fun with all the little details you expect from a Monster High toy.<br /><br />For those of you who enjoyed the film that showed on Nick this cafe cart featured heavily in it as Rochelle and Frankie tried to find Garrott. It's sort of a way point for the characters and there's a funny moment with Toralei getting mad at the barista for serving her an espresso.<br /><br />Something to note if you're a collector... the bench is not put together but don't panic. The other half is kind of tucked back in behind the cart itself. If you're not displaying it out of the box and want to keep it unopened you don't need to worry, it's all there, just packed for store display.
B001M3WPY8|5.0|Awesome movie even by today's standards. Has the longest sword duel climax in filmdom. Using broadswords no less! Plot closely resembles the true legend. Recommended for kids of all ages.
B00B2PHSIY|4.0|For scuba diving photos, this filter is a necessity.  It fits perfectly on the GoPro 3, and the resulting photos are much better than without it.  The only issue I have is the cost.  It is a small molded piece of plastic, and although it does what it is supposed to do, $30 seems a bit steep.  However, if you are scuba diving and going below 10 or 15 feet, you need this.  If you are only snorkeling, at least on a sunny day, you can probably do without it.
B004X75RK4|5.0|This is a usual romantic comedy with some fresh twists. Love Sandra Bullock's comic timing, and Ryan Reynolds puts in a great performance as well. There is chemistry between the two and lots of comedy.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I've been looking for another good series since the Hunger Games and I've found it! I can't wait to read the rest of the series.
B0001RVP88|1.0|I love this movie, that is why I ordered it, However I wasn't aware that it was only playable under European specs. Therefore I CAN NOT watch it. I wanted to return it but was told that I can't. Now I have a movie in my collection that I can't watch!<br />#SooooDisappointed
B00BI73CVI|5.0|I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good musical.  Very emotional.  The actors were really good. I loved it.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|I just have to play this game every night before I go to bed or I don't sleep well. It's my &#34;unwind&#34; tool everyday.
B00BLGXL3U|3.0|Hoffman is amazing, but when is he not?  Phoenix inhabits a character that is unique, memorable, disturbed, and undeniably watchable.  I just felt 'meh' about the story itself, though, even as it went artfully and shamelessly and with raw intensity into the lives of the characters.<br />I guess I found the movie almost too intense, without much of a payoff for all the wattage on-screen.  'The Master' will, I suspect, live on as a polarizing example of a very good movie that some people want to really like, but just don't.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|I love this movie and I am not even a baseball enthusiast. It's the message in the movie, about being the change you want to see, despite the fact that most people don't like to change their thinking, get out of the comfort zone, take risks. Brad Pitt does a great job as Billy Bean. I highly recommend this movie for the message it delivers.
B005WUHAX8|2.0|I wish that I would of sent this back to amazon. Nobody could hear me while I had the case on & I also found it harder to text as fast as I normally do with the bubbles in between the case and phone... Was not happy about it. Wish it would of worked better
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app! It allows me to do my Bible study anywhere. I find the studies enriching and user friendly.
0545403359|5.0|War Horse is a fantastic novel all about a horse named Joey! Joey is a red horse, with a black mane and tail, a white cross on his forehead, and four white socks. Joey lives during World War I. He starts his adventure by being sold at an auction and separated from his mother. He is bought by a mean man who bought Joey so his neighbor could not have Joey. When the man leads Joey to his stables, Joey meets a old horse named Zoey and a sweet boy named Albert. He lives and works here for 2 years. Eventually, Joey is sold to the army by the man who needs money to pay for his farm. This leaves Albert heartbroken, but Albert swears that one day he will find Joey. Would you like to know what happens next? Then read the book and find out!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Very quick read, I finished it between 2 short plane rides. Far better than the movie, in my opinion, definitely worth your time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Had lots of action and romance. One of the best  books I`'ve  ever read and want to read the second book.

B0063IH60K|3.0|The computer shuffle does not give good starts.  You loose more than you win unless you tell it to deal a winning hand. Would still recommend if you like solitaire.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|What more can we say about this excellent concert! Thanks so much for the pre-sale order! I was enjoying this concert when everyone else was waiting in lineat the store!  Well worth the buy at any price!
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|. It passes the time away. Hoping to get better as I use it more.  I'm still a beginner and need more practice.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Had fun playing this. I love these types of games. I will be buying more of them very soon. Great game.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Right at my finger tips. I find it very easy to read.  and gives me my area at a quick glance.
B007THA4FI|3.0|The book keeps my interest, but I am having trouble keeping the many characters straight~ Probably will not recommend this book!
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Supernatural season 7 was just amazing! Highly recommend for anyone to buy. Its so interesting its hard to stop watching.
B004LWZWBU|4.0|Fun movie about world- class birding.  Not as good as the book was. Worthwhile to watch, especially if you enjoy birds.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Very much liked this story. Was slightly disappointed with the ending and there were a couple of times I struggled with the settings, but the overall story line was different than your usual sci-fi and definitely held my attention.
B0007GAERG|4.0|I really give this album 3 1/2 out of 5. Lot's of fillers. Not her worst but not her best either. Would recommend E=MC2 over this but if you want all of her albums this is one of the better ones.
0385528752|5.0|For those of you who are looking for practical application, this book is it!  I'm using it in various areas of my life, especially work.
B00004RHZU|5.0|Her most ignored album (which is this) is her very best album. All the songs are great and I wish she would release another R&B album.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I love &#34;Firefly&#34; and have watched the episodes many times. It's unique and highly entertaining. I recommend it wholeheartedly but it's not for children.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The game my horse is so much fun because somebody who loves horses it is a great game it helps you interact with a horse
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this game it can really challenge you. My grandson also loves it and he's five. He even beats me sometimes.
B00005N6KG|3.0|I have purchased many sets of these headphones. I seem to have small ear canals and earbuds pop out of my ears when jogging so I need headphones that stay on and don't get gross and sweaty. Sound quality isn't a big deal to me since I only use headphones when running, I purchase these, 3 at a time, annually, since I seem to misplace them so frequently or my kids borrow them and don't return them.<br /><br />This year's trio seems to have quality problems. I'm returning two of the sets because they shock my ear, even when the volume isn't that loud. Rather painful to be shocked inside your ear!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love love love it. Amazing game and it is a game that everyone will like. As you travel through the area it will speed up but don't worry about that you will get better as you go.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Great alarm system on my Kindle Fire - so easy to program, editting the times is simple & easy to use!
B002RI9X8S|3.0|i read this book for the book club .it has a high profile so i was intrigued about . i found the philosophy of the family admirable and the challenges they had to face very moving .however i believe that it was the matriach of the family who held them all together and was the reason they survived like they did .it was an example of the money makers taking over the little people and ignoring the reason that they were there for ie to work the land. }i was disappointed to leave them with an unsatisfactory ending ,to my way of thinking they deserved better,nevertheless as a family they perservered and to a degree conquered.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I like this game alot... does anyone know how to delete a game though. that is the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because there is no delete button that I can find.  plz respond!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is amazing. I love it, I play it when ever I get bored because I can literally play this game for hours!
B002KGEORM|5.0|I really like this series  and intend to follow it as it continues, would recommend to all who enjoy mafia related shows.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Who cares if this movie has the N word 100 times it is relevant for the time period. Anyway excellent movie that I will add to my Quentin Tarantino collection. Jamie Foxx is excellent in this western/ blaxploitation movie! I enjoyed it thoroughly and so did my family. I won't spoil it so just go and watch it for yourself.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|LOVE this show, one of the best ever done for TV and can not wait for season 4 to begin.
B004YXE438|5.0|i have really enjoyed this puzzle app.  players have choices for number of pieces and levels of difficulty.  the pictures used for the puzzles are great.  really enjoy
B0034G4OYK|5.0|My children love to watch this movie!  The adults enjoyed it as well which is not always the case with children's movies.  The older kids (11, 8 and 7) love to quote this movie.
B00985E3UG|4.0|Michael Moss has done the consuming public a great service by revealing the gargantuan lengths that the processed food industry goes to get you hooked on their products.  They are as big and powerful as Big Tobacco (in fact, they are the same in some instances), manipulate the FDA and other governmental regulatory bodies to get their way, and essentially game the system to ensure that you -- unconsciously -- continue to demand more fat, more sugar, and more salt in your completely inert \\"goldfish\\" and other entirely man-made garbage consumables.<br /><br />The interviews and data assembled here are impressive and a must-read.<br /><br />I did find, however, that the material could have been better organized and with a greater narrative flow.<br /><br />That said, this is still an impressive achievement.  You will never look at an Oreo cookie in the same way again.
B005BCE7FQ|5.0|This is a wonderful, family movie!  My children ask to watch it over and over.  The colors and picture in 3D are amazing!  It is the favorite movie of my 4 year old.  My 11 year old would like to visit Rio based on this movie alone.
B00BHMEALA|5.0|The movie moved quite well, there were no what I call drap spots when you get a little bored. I remember the news when they came home and the reports about how Canada had brought them out of hiding so this was very interesting to me to see the behind the scenes. The Canadians put themselves in a lot of danger for our people back then just keeping them for the six weeks or so before we got our act together and got them out. I was glad to see that theyand their house keeper were able to escape also.
B0094M2S5A|5.0|Best movie of all time. I can listen to it with my eyes closed and picture exactly what is on the screen. No movie has better music.
B005K17RU0|1.0|As of 3-2013, formatting of this app for Kindle Fire is bad.  App is now slow and will occasionally freeze, requiring a hard reboot of the Kindle Fire.
B009KEN87O|5.0|this game is really quite excellent. Sure it has retro voxel graphics but the animations are really good. I love the way the enemies sort of pop when you destroy them. Definitely worth paying.
B00BHU2A7I|3.0|Even if I had not read the book on which Hitchcock was based, I would have had an easy time spotting all of the problems with this movie. A LOT of liberties were taken in the movie, and all of the embellished story parts (Alma's attempted affair, the last-minute &#34;saving&#34; of Psycho in editing, etc.) were far less interesting than the actual story! I think this failure boils down to a weak director and a too-tight budget.
B004YXE438|5.0|got this app several days ago and love that i get to choose how difficult or how eady i want my puzzle to be.  and the pictures are beautiful.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Director Sam Mendes managed to do the impossible and make James Bond a relevant pop culture franchise again. It was the perfect 50th birthday present for both Bond and this reviewer.
B007UXSPK2|4.0|It was amazing I really liked the movie and all the effects the movie has..... I recommend it if you want to see a good movie
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|Not bad but it has too many hidden object puzzles And not enough variety so it gets a bit boring. Passes the time though.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|This game is a lot of fun to play. It's match-three done in a way that keeps me coming back for more. It's set in a fantasy RPG environment with weapon, armor, shield, and potion upgrades, and the goal is to make 10,000,000 pts to free the protagonist. Nice mobile game from a one man studio in a genre that's hard to innovate.
0425221806|1.0|The only difference between this book and a bad crime novel is that it involves two experimental animals that escape from a lab.<br /><br />You are saying, \\"Yeah, but experimental creatures sound cool.\\"<br /><br />They're not. One is a friendly dog that is there for comedy relief. The other is a mutant baboon that an NSA agent and sheriff (who are good buddies) mosey around California after as it kills people. Again, if you think that sound exciting, it's not.<br /><br />The mutant baboon is the only interesting character in the book, but pages devoted to him are few and far between. While you are trying to get to the mutant baboon you are treated to 1) a bad crime novel and 2) a bad romance novel.<br /><br />\\"Gee whiz, Lem? Why do you reckon that creature of you NSA folk left a head on a plate?\\"<br /><br />\\"Don't know, sheriff. When it lived in the lab it sure was aggressive though.\\"<br /><br />Etc.
B00BHNQ5XK|3.0|The movie had its moments and I'm glad I rented it.  The subject was interesting and the acting was ok.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|One of my newest fav movies, certainly in my top 5 list.  Funny, full of great songs, and very talented performers.  My hubby even likes this movie!  Great film :)
B004H4XL7E|5.0|I would recommend this book to all sales professionals. It will, if followed make selling more fun. It is also, a must read for the new sales rep as they will build more confidence quicker.
B007N6NGYG|4.0|Pretty addictive game with awesome graphics! Have to admit I was pretty skeptically at first, but its pretty hard to put down once you start.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love the game, graphics, and everything. Just wish the creators would quit messing with it! Leave the game alone! Please!
0439023513|4.0|If you read the first two volumes of Collins' trilogy, how could you not read the third?  And the books and story have permeated the general consciousness to the point that this (or any?) review is dust in the wind.  I think Mockingjay is the weakest link in the trilogy, but it has the kinetic force that marked the first two books, and brings to resolution some of the personal, relational, plot and cultural matters that fueled Collins' tour de force.  She couldn't please everyone in concluding a story that compels such attention and engagement. It's a good book, and I've re-read the trilogy and have seen the first Hunger Games movie several times.  That's more to the point than any number of stars or any number of quibbles or puffs.
0307269981|4.0|I picked up this sequel in a 2nd hand stall and still haven't read [[ASIN:0307949486 Dragon Tattoo]], but on the strength of this I might go back.<br /><br />Larsson somehow manages to keep you turning the pages when there are surprisingly large passages devoid of action, focusing more on how investigators pursue their theories (theories that the reader might already know are false). And places where you can see why Larsson would have comfortably created such an Aspergers-style lead character: not many other authors would include (or get away with) the minutia of detail of the precise furniture, or shopping, or computer specs (or whatever) of Salander's environment - maybe it addresses annoyances he had in reading other books which might refer to someone using their mobile (\\"Which mobile? What model? Did it have a decent touch screen?\\").<br /><br />There's an interesting mix of the conventional with the individual here. While Salander is a departure from many standard heroes/heroines (most particularly socially: there's no hint of Bridget Jones everywoman relatability here), the popularity of this book still hinges on that daydream revenge story: Larsson sets up baddies for supergirl to take down. I'd like to think there could be an argument to say this deserves a place alongside `novels' given the depth of its characters, and I could almost be convinced of the authenticity of Salandar's version of the world: a war zone, where survival depends on identifying your enemies and neutralising them. Her `condition' in one way disables her, isolating her from the pleasure and security of everyday community; in another it frees her, enabling her to see straight past social disguises to the often ugly heart. But... no ... this is overwhelmingly an implausible thriller: Salander is Jason Bourne, badass superagent; she's almost James Bond in her emotionless sexuality; she's that daydream fulfilment - what if I could do something about that jerk who cut me off in traffic today - how cool would it be to have a list, like Lisbeth, of people I could tick off as I invisibly got even with them.<br /><br />Hey, I'm not saying there's anything wrong with a decent thriller - and this is a decent thriller. The baddies are bad, and measured out capably, leading to a deft climax (if massively conventional - how many showdowns in isolated country houses could you name?). The vengeance feels apposite, with the pleasure of tables turned. Salander is this angel walking unrecognised amongst us: safe if we're good, but terrible if crossed. Like Clint Eastwood or whoever, you want to pray that she's around when it goes down. And her gimmick isn't wit or a dog or OCD or a dead wife - it's lack of social warmth or interest.<br /><br />But I am saying you really want to be careful about, say, seeing this as some sort of feminist statement. Salander doesn't challenge masculine paradigms, she simply becomes a bigger man. She beats them up, or shoots them, or humiliates them. She doesn't hesitate to use torture (a disturbingly popular trend amongst heroes). In Larssen's world (as in most thriller worlds), people are either bad or good, there is no grey. Forgiveness, for anyone, is not even a vague speculation: justice in terms of retribution is the only option. And, unlike life, it's not messy or complex, there is no shared culpability, and no sense that getting someone back will often exacerbate the problem, and perhaps leave you with a greater burden. Which is just fine in thriller-world.<br /><br />Spoilers.<br /><br />The book plays effectively on sentimentalities: Larssen creates likeable people to be on her side. There are a few lapses in plausibility within its own terms of reference (smart people would not spend all this time floundering about for a motive when the victim had just told a whole bunch of immoral and powerful people with close criminal links that he was going to destroy their careers - with seemingly not the slightest awareness that this might cause some sort of reaction; an uber-baddie who has never been able to feel pain might work for an incident, but not a life: not getting feedback about protecting himself from damage, or from further damage, would actually greatly weaken him; uberbaddie lets himself get tied up like a lamb when once Blomkvist got within arms reach he could drop him with a shrug; the mobile phone out of charge - oh, and no cable? Nice that Larssen bothered trying to justify the fun of the heroic rescue, but, c'mon), but generally once we accept that Salander has the skills she's supposed to, there aren't too many `ziffs'.ght cause some sort of reaction; an uber-baddie who has never been able to feel pain might work for an incident, but not a life: not getting feedback about protecting himself from damage, or from further damage, would actually greatly weaken him; uberbaddie lets himself get tied up like a lamb when once Blomkvist got within arms reach he could drop him with a shrug; the mobile phone out of charge - oh, and no cable?

B00BF11STU|5.0|I would highly recommend this movie. It was very interesting and held my attention for the entire running time. A must see!
B0060MYM7O|2.0|Similar to the first season, production values remain very high (why I give two stars), but I couldn't recommend this to anyone who has actually read The Clash of Kings. I recognize the almost impossible task of trying to fit the contents of a 900+ page novel into ten episodes, so why then choose to invent scenes and characters, or rewrite them in unsatisfactory or unnecessary ways to extend the narrative in a manner totally incongruous with the book? I realize the convenience of collapsing characters, but why have them doing or saying things that never happen in the novel? What purpose is served by spending what appears to be precious time (ten episodes!) playing out long scenes that never achieve the intended pathos because they never resolve themselves in the intended manner?<br /><br />I've noticed several reviews on Amazon in which five stars are given by reviewers who proudly state they've never read the books, and are very happy with the narrative qualities of this season. I wonder what they think they actually know, considering the bulk of the story never made it to the screen, and what did is so garbled and confused, or just vague and unfulfilled, that no one who hadn't read the book could otherwise know what is going on? Ignorance is bliss, but it's still ignorance.
B00BB8SKPW|1.0|After the 1st 20 minutes it became very disappointing. Was a waste of time and money. And I am a huge Denzel fan.
B006R8GK2Q|3.0|I like the game, but to much dialogue.<br />I will play a little bit longer and see if I can score it higher.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I loved this book because it was amazing how the author wrote such a true to life context of a person with alzheimers.  A great job and a great reading book. I would recommend this book to anyone.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is the best app ever I play It all the time the  you can even visit your friends and see their horses
0425263908|5.0|Loved, loved , loved this book.  I think I may have liked it more than Fifty Shades.  I read this book in two days and couldn't wait to get the next book in my hands.  You just never knew what was going to happen next. It was suspenseful at times, but always leaves you wanting more.  Love the characters and Sylvia doesn't give away too much about them in the beginning, so you are wondering why the act like they do, but then it all just falls into place.  The second novel (Reflected in You) is even better than Bare to You,  you will not be able to put it down!  Eagerly anticipating Entwined With You!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Its been sooo long since I have seen a series this great. The costume, scenery, actors, screenplay, is all espectacular.  Once started couldn't stop watching.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|This book is pornographic violence.  It was revolting.  The only reason I finished it was because it was a book club read.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I've re-read the series 3 times. I know that the series doesn't absolutely follow the books faithfully, but it doesn't detract from a great story. I am waiting breathlessly for the next book in the series. I will HAVE TO obtain ALL of the HBO series.
0307887960|1.0|My niece who lives in France told me about this diet book.  My doctor checked it out and gave it a thumbs down.  Not healthy.  I have since lost 50 pounds eating a balanced diet and increased exercise.
B00B4VI8MQ|1.0|it was a fast paced game. kept your interest.  would recommend this to a friend.it took a while to down load.  wish I didn't have to pay to play the whole thing.<br /> interest.
B0046ECFRM|5.0|Great characters! Etienne was soooo perfect for Anna! The ending was just right, and horrible Ellie ended up out of the picture, leaving the pair of starstruck lovers to themselves. Best romance book ever!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book covered so many different viewpoints of a potential zombie war from the different battle techniques to the effect on whales. A very detailed account.
B0091REZMW|5.0|love it!!!! best hidden object game ever. I just wish the energy would move a lot faster. I would like my weapons to match the bad guys.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|One of the thing I really like about this app is that if I am not sure how to spell it all I have to do is say it and I receive the meaning and the correct spelling.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|Why only half the story?? Very disappointing.What was there of the story was good.Maybe I will just read the book again,it never disappoints.
B009POCFTG|5.0|If you like dark comedies, this is a must for your collection.  Matthew McConaughey brought his A-game to his portrayal of a cop/assassin.  The supporting cast came in on the short bus straight from Jerry Springer.  Great lines and a few sight gags keep the movie rolling.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Best, most user friendly search engine that I have! I have used meta crawler, which is ok, but not in the same league.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|this is a great season... u just can never tell where this story is going... it just keeps u guessing
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really like this app! I like that the horses look real and you can compete with your horse.I would like it if you could earn gems easier. I would also like it if you could have a horse hoof cleaning game really like this app
B00ADIT8U2|2.0|I was enjoying this game until I hit the puzzle on the General store door.  In order to open it, you had to follow the lights as they lit up.  When the green light lit you had to hit it but when the red lights lit you had to hit the one that didn't light up.  The problem with that was all of the red lights lit up so you couldn't hit any button.  What gives with that?  I tried for a half hour and finally got so frustrated that I deleted the game from my kindle fire. Not worth the frustration.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|i thought the beginning was very poorly written.  The story was strange, I got bored with it and fed up with the characters.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|want something that can handle just about everything you could throw at it, there is no bigger bang-for-the-buck deal than this model<br />delivery service was correct and I am satisfied with everything.
B004H6G0TI|5.0|tis game is amazing the graphics are amazing really fun get it while it is still the free app of the day's
B00BMUYLSE|5.0|I have really enjoyed this album. It is at once reminiscent of Bowie's Berlin Trilogy and completely new as well. I particularly like the two singles &#34;Where are we now&#34; and &#34;The stars (are out tonight)&#34; as well as &#34;Dancing out in space&#34; and &#34;How does the grass grow&#34;. All in all a great album.
B0018OIK0E|5.0|The British have done it again: Taken a taboo topic and turned it on its head, literally. The writer has outdone himself in noticing that some people tend to walk similar to zombies, when we first awake. Also, some people who are wide awake also tend to walk similar to zombies. Although it does have a tendency to get too gory (a couple of scenes of zombies becoming impaled on a steel pole would make people with a delicate composition a bit too squeamish), the director doesn't shy away from making a fictional story seem incredibly real. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch a funny movie on Halloween or any non-Halloween night. Prepare to be laugh your head off, literally.
1616550414|4.0|Its an amazing collection piece for all Zelda fans.<br />I'm a designer and for me it is important to have reference material for sketching, drawings and how professionals present their work. This book helped me in that way (not mentioning than im a real zelda lover)<br /><br />The only reasing im not giving the book 5 stars its because most of the artwork its focus on Skyward Sword and not in all the games equally.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|I had heard all great things about this book. I do like Tina, but I think I like her better in the spoken word vs written.  There were funny parts, but I guess I wa expecting to laugh out loud. I did not. This was just an ok read for me.
B005LAII80|5.0|1000x better than that crappy version with Stallone!  Highly underrated.  I really liked the movie and so did the wife, however, she didn't care for how violent the movie was.
0785163174|5.0|This book really is a fight book. The Avengers want to stop the Phoniex from going into hope and destroying another world and the X-Men want to save Hope because this can help the mutant race. It has friend against friend and family against family. The Phonniex does go into 5 of the X-Men and it gives them ultimate power. Does the power corrupt them or can they control it? This story changes everything in the X-Men and Avengers lives and turns things upside down. After this both series got rebooted. It was a good read. So people found it kind of boring.
B008220D7S|3.0|It definitely wasn't a terrible movie, but I was expecting it to be a bit funnier than what it was.  Probably should have just rented it vs buying it.
B0083DJWGO|5.0|This author will leave you begging for more on each page. Absolutely brilliant analysis (and so timely for our current macro-economic situation).<br /><br />The author's writing style transforms potentially boring statistical and risk analysis into a fresh new perspective on data and applies this new &#34;anti-fragile&#34; concept to every facet of life.<br /><br />A truly mind-changing book!
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Great movie for an economy novice. highly recommend. It is frightening how those that are in charge are so greedy.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like this game would be better if they refilled fasted but it a good hidden objects game!! I love playing it definitely when sitting bored at the doctors office.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Was expecting very little but was pleasantly surprised. Very funny, would recommend. Fun to watch for guys or for girls.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|its worth every penny. full of fun for all ages and a good time killer!! so incredibly fun! I absolutely love it!
B001N44BVQ|5.0|I wanted to add this movie to my collection of DiCaprio dramas. He is really a good actor in just about everything I have seen. This  movie reminds us there are always people working for the good of our country.We have no idea what is going on foreign soil that concerns us all.Many lives lost and many sacrfices are made for freedom in every country!Treachery and deceitfulness runs amuck with Russell Crowe calling the shots. Good Movie! Iliked the suspense.
142311339X|5.0|Do you know who the Great Prophecy is about?  I read The Lost Hero by Rick Riordan.  It is the first book in The Heroes of Olympus series.  This book is a fiction novel that is packed with action.  I recommend  this book for ages 9 and up.<br /> This book is about three kids named Jason, Piper, and Leo.  They are demigods, and after a short time at Camp Half Blood they realize that they must unite to save Hera, and the world.  Together they  embark on a journey that will bring them more obstacles and dangers than they ever imagined. This book follows these three kids wherever their journey leads them.  The theme of this novel is... things are never what they seem.<br /> My favorite part of this book is when the forge and the dove broke the cage. As much as I love this book, I do wish that the book talked a little more about the gods and their separation from the demigods.<br /> Rick Riordan has written many other great books.  Some examples are: The Lightning Thief,  The Sea of Monsters, The Titan's Curse, The Battle of the Labyrinth, and The Last Olympian.  These books tell the story of what happened before this tale of the the seven.  There is also The Son of Neptune, and The Mark of Athena which are sequels to this book.<br /> This is an amazing novel!  It has adventure, heroes, and mysteries.  It is action packed and has a great mix of reality and mythology.  Once you read the book you will know three of the  seven in the Great Prophecy, and then beg to know more.
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|Perks is by far one of my favorite stories of all time. I fell in love with the book about two years ago and had been waiting desperately for the movie to come out and it didn't disappoint at all.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Overall I love Downton Abbey Series 3 but must death be so prevalent?  I loved the mix of the main characters upstairs and downstairs but now they are leaving one by one.  It was good to see that they dealt with &#34;taboo&#34; subjects realistically for today's times but with the rules of the day in the 1920s.  I love the costumes and scenery.  It will be interesting to see if Series 4 includes the Great Depression and the growing of the next generation of Sybil (granddaughter) and George, and that Edith finally find lasting love and if Mary shows more of her independent nature again.  I hope that there will be many more series with the Crawley family and the changing times of the aristocracy.
B009DQQDEO|5.0|Such a powerful album! I could (and do) listen to this over and over and over again.<br /><br />Especially the first track Mladic... what a trip!
B002CYRROY|5.0|had a new computer case with lots of areas for fans but without enough clearance for standard depth fans. went to a local computer store and was told this size doesn't exist. after I bought the fans I took them to the store and gave them all the inside information. these saved the day and are keeping my system cool. These came with all the standard power adapters you would need to fit any application.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|this book was easy reading and couldn't put it down at the end. But I was a little disappointed because it reminded me so much of Sleeping with the enemy.  Not my favorite Nicholas Sparks book.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Great combination of smart and funny.  There is never a dull moment with Sheldon and the gang.  One of the est
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This Book Was the most fun reading. I read it with my mom. I think the author should write a sequel to the book
B004MC8CA2|5.0|ok whoever said this app was not good then your pretty much just saying you don't like the Bible....and when you say that it....makes me cry to see all the people that only give 1 stars. is that what you give Jesus? You have to give Jesus all your stars because he is our king and he died for us and you sitting here said its not for you if your still reading this and you give this app 1 star that you need to get on the floor and pray to God tell he to help you and ask he to forgive you I know what your thinking your like oh this is just a app. well its not.pray to Jesus and say Jesus Im sorry and you need to get with a friend and tell them about Jesus! well I have said to much I'm sorry that's what you need to do by the way I'm only 11 and I love Jesus! :) do you?
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Wreck it Ralph was a great movie to watch for the whole family. My kids loved it, it was great...
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Very entertaining story. Look forward to the next exciting adventure of Pendergast and Vincent and other characters from past books .
B000FC2PKG|4.0|This is a spine chilling mystery. Keeps you turning the pages. Can't wait to read more books by Ms Gardner
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Was a great movie and a awesome story!...Should have won an award. This was definitely a movie to watch. It was interesting and heart felt at times. Watch It!
B00BYOEZTI|5.0|I was almost releaved when I watched this and all the original characters were in this one.<br />Nice touch of continuity.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|Kate and Jessica Oh man....great action from both and Colin eeehhh....guess he was alright. But all in all the movie was awesome!
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|Mark Wahlberg could do better.  I am always surprised by his choice of movies. And the idea of a perverted, crude and foul mouthed teddy bear is somewhat disturbing.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|I liked this movie alot....Its pretty crazy how,....don't want to give the movie away you just have to watch it...lol...its a very good movie to watch.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|The movie itself was great.  I know that any movie that Denzel Washington is in is worth it<br />The plot was (finally...thank you Hollywood) original but the problems that his character had to deal with are everyday. He played the part wonderfully and believably.<br />I was not, however, impressed with Amazon's HD version.  I was such a poor quality image that my husband and I had to double check to make sure I had purchased the HD version.  Very fuzzy and lots of pixelation on solid colors.<br />Shame on Amazon.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|Johnny is always good at what he does...this movie is fantastic. Johnny is a unique actor and he does it so well when he plays these kinds of characters. Loved it! Watch it!
B00BEZTMWW|1.0|I question if I got a copy of the orginal.  The 3D disc did not work but the 2D did.
B0041KBWM0|4.0|A good story with great characters,loved the scenery and the acting..really enjoyed the season.looking<br />Forward to more.wish there were more series like this.
B007885IJU|5.0|I listened to this album and immediately loved it. Every song from start to finish is strong and one you'll instantly fall in love with. Sounds great on vinyl too, definitely get this album!
B003VXMMTK|4.0|So enjoyed this series.thought the acting and choice of characters were excellent.loved how the drama continued<br />And moved through such lovely landscapes.if one enjoys period movies this is one should watch.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Absolutely amazing book! I had heard so much about it and decided it was time for me to form my own opinion! Onto the next!!!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This game works perfectly. It downloaded smoothly and I was able to login to my facebook. There are no problems in the game.
B0095P3ULC|5.0|Love it! Definitely something to see. Gotta see the 2 movies before it though to get it all. :) :)
B008X9Z37A|2.0|Just a basic case. I didn't like the way the Kindle fit in it. The strips of leather going across the corners was distracting.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Fantastic program, after season two broadcast on HBO, I purchased and read all five books of the Song of Ice and Fire by George RR Martin, the inspiration for Game of Thrones on HBO.<br />So far the program is following the first two books.  Love the character development and the setting used throught the series, vivid, and they bring the locations in the books to life.  Don't know if there will be any new surprises in the program since I've finished reading the five books published to date.<br />I am also anticipating George R.R. Martin's publication of books six and seven, hope they will be coming soon.
B008DM4OTA|2.0|Have this for Android and while my daughter enjoys it, I find it a bit eyerolling. It says &#34;realistic medical procedures&#34; but nothing could be further from the truth, and it's silly to try and sell this as educational anyway. Kids would never learn how to practice medicine from an app...it's okay for something to just be fun for fun's sake.
B005LAJ1H2|4.0|Can't wait for the new season of Boardwalk.<br />We love the characters and the deveopments in Atlantic City over the years of the early 1920's.
B00A3CVFMM|5.0|Love this movie and soundtrack every bit as much as I did the LotR movies and soundtracks! Same great quality and composing!
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|Great app to record thoughts or ideas &#34;on the spot&#34; when you don't have a pen or paper with you.  Not something I use consistently but occasionally.
B004IFD9HE|4.0|Got this to watch when my niece (8) and nephew (10) were staying over, and it was a great choice.  We all laughed; fun movie for all ages.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game is the closest thing you can get to a console shooter. The graphics are excellent and the online is very good also.
1455519650|5.0|Best Crime Writer<br />Michael Connelly is a great writer. I have read everyone of his books. Harry Bosch is a great character. I highly recommend Michael Connelly.
B00280LYIM|5.0|The series is amazing. I know it is supposed to be a kid book but I can't stop reading them. I wish they kept going.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|I love having this sonic screwdriver, my only complaint is, it is not loud enough as compared to the 11th Doctor's sonic screwdriver. Still cool to have if you are a Whovian.
0345529057|5.0|I love the setting in which this story takes place. It's original and unique in its own way. Love it
B009H5IS1W|5.0|Criminal Minds on Amazon Digital Video with the Season Tv Pass is the Best! I love that I can watch from my laptop and my Android phone!
075666733X|5.0|I'm a biologist. I wanted to find an exceptional book to teach my kids about the human body, and this book is IT. The book gives a very visual understanding of what's inside us, in a lot of detail but not in so much detail that the big picture is missed either. I got tired of thin kids' books about the human body that offered little information beyond the fact that we have a body and it does a bunch of things we all know that it does. At least some kids want and can handle more. My 3-year-old son LOVES this book! While I got this book for my kids, it's perfect for adults as well. Adults could spend a very long time mastering everything in this book. It's an absolutely fabulous in-depth introduction to the human body. And it's truly beautifully put together, with tons of beautiful color illustrations. For anyone who wants to know about human anatomy and to a lesser extent some basic physiology & disease biology, this is your book. BUY IT TODAY!!! (And no, I'm not selling it. :) DO NOT HESITATE!!! I've never seen a better book about the human body.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Very well written beginning to end.  I look forward to reading the second book in this trilogy.  When is the third book to be released?
B00985E3UG|5.0|This book should be required reading for every high school and college student.  If we don't heed the warnings we are doomed as a society.
B0006AAS5G|2.0|The watch is very nice looking and comfortable but it was losing about 2 minutes a week, which is very bothersome to me considering a watch should keep accurate time. This is the second Invicta watch that I have sent back for the reason of not keeping accurate time. (I compare it to my cell phone.) Again, I have to go back to wearing my Timex Expedition watch.
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|I was surprised they did not include the Desolation of Smaug. I read the book the Hobbit and thought I was buying the entire book not just the first half. This was a disappointment.
B00BSBXZDY|5.0|Watch it!  It's super cute!  Fun for the entire family to enjoy a family night!  Cute humor as well.  Santas little elves were ADORABLE and made me laugh lots!
B007NWCZR4|5.0|FORMAT is amazing.  I'm so glad they finally decided to officially release all the B sides on a CD.  Many of these songs are some of my favorites.  The remastered versions of these songs quality is awesome. I highly recommend adding this CD to your collection to replace all the previous versions of the B-side collection. You will not be disappointed.<br />Max
B005LAIHY0|4.0|Not a bad story line and semi-connection with the other Alien movies but did not care for Noomi Rapace's role and the generally undisciplined crew that trillions of dollars were being spent on.  I really expected a lot more from Ridley Scott
B0011UGLK6|5.0|Lahiri has a senstive understanding of families, whether they are immigrant families or Indian families, or neither.<br />Her writing is superb.
B009EANE3M|3.0|This album is okay, but I still think their first release was a lot better. There are probably two to three songs that I really like on this one.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|The book was a very interesting depiction of early onset Alzheimer's with the narrator being the role of the patient. From desiring to remain relevant, alongside of maintaining a sense of dignity with her health, the author describes some of the struggles for a person &#34;losing her mind&#34;, whose mind was the most note-worthy in her field. Certainly a book that made me want to take full advantage of life, seeing as I may not know what parts of it may be taken from me and how.
B000HKYBXA|5.0|Any imperfections could be marked as deliberate choices that I disagree with or limitations placed on superb actors by small parts.  Almost perfect.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Great game. Ice.age village is a great game. It fun to play and it is very very very very interesting
B0063IH60K|5.0|always enjoy playing this game to kill time and keep my mind from getting to dull. recommend it to anyone wanting something to occupy their time.
B004LLDN3A|5.0|this is a great quality production of a classic film. my daughters love to watch this film over and over
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|What a game.  Love the challenge and the different levels and vehicles.  Hooked on the game, do it while watching tv
B00BSBY38A|4.0|Life of Pi is an incredible story of an incredible experience.  I've heard debate about the truthfulness of the story and that doesn't matter at all.  There are countless lessons to be learned in this story and Ang Lee has presented them in such a beautiful way, that the authenticity doesn't matter at all.  This is just a gorgeous movie and can be enjoyed on countless levels.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|This was my introduction to Leonard Cohen's music when I thought I did not know it.  This is an amazing performance by Leonard, his singers and band.  Well worth the purchase and time to listen, the DVD is a must!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love the format but it does come with ads. I bought another version for $.99 but this one is better so I'll put up with the ads.
B004JQN4WM|5.0|My sons each got these dinosaurs for Christmas. They are a hit. They play with them everyday. The detail on these is outstanding and we like that they are each a specific type of dinosaur. My son knows the names and for this one talks about the spikes on his back and his club tail.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game makes me feel like I own a real horse.I can really see what it would be like to own a real horse.All in all,it is a great app for everyone,so you should really get it!!!!!
1582701709|5.0|GREAT BOOK, GREAT PRICE! I SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN MORE COPIES! I MIGHT ORDER MORE FOR XMAS, MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS COULD USE THIS BOOK.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|Watch out for costly acorns. The charges add up very quickly, otherwise it is a fun game for all ages.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I loved this book.  The author has a way of describing the characters so that you really get into the story. A real page turner which has a lesson to convey. Highly recommended.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Great action packed James Bond flick!  Also enjoyed the locations and the clothing.  Would recommend it to family and friends.
B00BF123WG|5.0|I loved it! I couldn't believe how well the main character was portrayed. It is a must-see for all the adults who have questions about how much covert activity should be brought to light.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This one is free and is better than the other hungry shark games. Which cost money so I reccomend this one than the others.So why waste money on something that is  not as good one that is free and better? Get this one.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|I am expanding my collection of classic books and this book helps round out this collection.  It is well written and a must read.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|There is something about this series that I really like, yet I always feel left wanting.  I think maybe the next book will answer the questions and then I end up with even more questions.  All in all I like the book and will see the series through hoping that I won't be let down in the end.
B008476HBM|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is my latest addition to my collection of classic books.  It is well written, interesting and a great read.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Read it in less than a day. Very good page turner. Hoover is a great writer. I've enjoyed her books and look forward to her new novels.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is an entertaining game, it holds my attention for hours. It's a great stress<br /><br />reliever. Thank you for offering a free series.<br /><br />I enjoyed many hours of this game and found it as a great stress reliever. Thank you for offering a nice variety of games.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is better than the first.  My favorite part is probe the bright green gems and the daily &amp; weekly challenges!
B005DOKIYG|2.0|It does not have a safe place to put the kindle when using it, or storage for the stylus.<br />it cost to much to return.
B000QI2ZWW|5.0|A really good movie for kids mine kids loved really loved the singing parts of the movie wanted to watch it over and over again
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game spunky, fun, imaginative. Temple run?, You tried it before, got tired of it. That's from last year. But if you want your game life upgraded, Here's the right game for you.<br /><br />-MadiBugg
B008JFUTT0|2.0|First of all, the music is so laughably bad that it makes this film seem more like a mockumentary.  This is only partially Rodriguez's fault, since judging from the tracks included, those first two albums were horribly produced, taking a semi-interesting folk singer/acoustic guitarist and larding up his music with sappy strings and other ill-chosen instrumentation (think of the worst of Nick Drake, but even that is much better).  As a film, it's so-so, hitting very familiar notes.  Mostly this just made me lose whatever respect I might have had for South African musical tastes. It's a Bizarro world to be sure.  There's a reason why Rodriguez didn't sell in the U.S.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|Book kept he reader looking for hat was going to happen next.  I loved this book and Richard Castle. Melissa
1423113381|5.0|The best book ever. It keeps you wanting to read more. I did not like to read but now I do because of this book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I was breathless when I got it I had read reviews and the game is over the top!! try it it wont be a waste of your time!!!  :)
B00881VLCE|5.0|wish they had more interesting free puzzles available. but I'm addicted so far......I would like to see more flags or animals with people
9056912445|5.0|I like to study endgames for both practical reasons (you score more points) and aesthetics (they're interesting!). The problem has been that too many resources are bland references (Muller's Fundamental Chess Endings, Fine's Basic Chess Endings), too dryly written, or don't cover enough of the essentials. De la Villa's book is exactly what I was looking for:<br /><br />* The author, a strong GM, is a cheerful and patient writer whose prose is fun to read.<br />* He excels at explaining the subtle concepts in a practical and helpful way. He identifies the key rules of thumb you must remember and backs them up with just enough analysis, rather than proffering arcane rules that are hard to retain. For example, in the white queen versus black h-pawn ending, he points to g3 and e2 as critical squares for the white king--because if it reaches one of them, white can deliver checkmate after the h-pawn promotes. This is so much easier to remember than the \\"winning zone\\" approach other books take.<br />* The structure of the book facilitates learning. He starts with some general principles (what needs to be memorized and what can be calculated, for example), then provides two sets of lessons (10 basic and 90 more advanced) and tests (with 25 and 40 positions, respectively) in order to help the reader acquire the essential knowledge.<br /><br />The new edition has several improvements over the previous edition (for which almost all the other Amazon reviews were written):<br /><br />* The tests include several examples from very recent play. For example, de la Villa offers 2 rook endgames from the Anand v. Gelfand world championship match which were critical in the outcome. In the second one, Gelfand failed to prevent Anand from reaching the Vancura position, which allowed Anand to save the half-point and the championship.<br />* The author has corrected a few analysis errors that reviews of the previous edition had noted.<br />* I had no problem determining who was to move bya glance at the diagrams (it's always white unless otherwise noted immediately beneath the diagram).<br /><br />As a strong club player rated approximately 1950 on the Free Internet Chess Server, I wondered if I would really learn much from a book that seemed dedicated to endgame fundamentals. When I took the book's first (basic) test of 25 positions, I was able to recognize whether white could win, draw or lose about 80% of the time. Unfortunately, I could not remember (or calculate) the variations I would have needed in a real game all too often, reducing my score to 60%. So yes, I need to work through these 100 endgames!<br /><br />I only found one minor flaw: de la Villa does not discuss the opposition enough, and distant opposition hardly at all. This flaw is easily remedied by consulting the fine (and free) wikipedia article on the opposition, which you might consider as lesson #101.<br /><br />The third edition has the right scope and detail for intermediate to strong club players; I would recommend it for everyone rated 1200 to 2000, and up to 2200 for experts who want a good review that will shore up any holes in knowledge. Beginners up to 1200 would benefit more from a book with narrower scope, such as the early chapters of Silman's fine endgame work.<br /><br />The publisher provided a review copy of this book to me in exchange for my honest review. My ratings of the publisher's books have ranged from 3 stars to 5 stars.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|This movie has english subtitles.  I first saw it at the movie theater this past summer 7/12.  After I purchased my ticket I was informed it was in subtitles.  I wanted to return my tickets for a refund as I didnt' want to read a movie.  After listening to the Usher of the theater rave how good it was I decided to give a chance.  It has now become one of my favorite movies!!!  I NEVER purchase movies ONLY if I absolutely love it.  Give it a try I think everyone will be surprised that ready subtitles for this movie was not bad.  Based on a true story too.

B007KOMTUI|4.0|didn't like madmen at first, a little dark and retro and a very masogenistic attitude towards women, as were the times in the 60s.<br />with each episode and season, the characters grow on you, especially the very strong willed, independent women, that rose above the negative attitudes surrounding them.  you realize how human these characters are, some trying to be better people, others just continue on in selfish ambition and lack of loyalty.  the characters and thematic content craws you in.  can't wait for season 6 starting 4/7.<br />some of the amazon videos glitched and wouldn't play, so i just had to exit completely and go back into my library profile and hit &#34;resume&#34;.  a little grainy in quality also, only onel audio was out of sync w/ video, all in all, fine, but should be a little cheaper, considering only a 40 min show  of note, season 1-4 are all available on netlix &#34;watch instantly&#34;.
B0060D2QR6|5.0|i loved this movie  great  story line, great work by miliey and liam ,one of my favorite movies , great job
B00BGIC4I6|4.0|The arguments between the adults and the oldest teen screaming at her parents can be frightening at times - because it is so plausible.  But, the laughs definitely outweigh the grimaces.  Definitely recommend.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I bought this book right before the long drive to Florida for vacation. It was so good i read the whole book on the drive. I couldn't put it down. This is a must read for people who enjoy military stories and anyone who enjoys a good read.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I'm not sure how far I am into this book because Kindle doesn't show page numbers (as far as I can tell), but so far this is an excellent book. I can't stop reading it.<br /><br />[EDIT]Ok, I've finished this book and it is great. I literally spend all my free time reading this. Books like this are few and far between. I would put the quality of this book up with Brandon Sanderson, Brent Weeks and Patrick Rothfuss (the style is different, but the story is just as engaging and well thought out). This book is highly recommended.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|This is just a cheap minecraft rip off. I'm surprised Montana hasn't sued you guys by know. You are just pathetic people looking to get money the worst way possible. DO NOT GET THIS
0374533571|4.0|The out of sync, foggy, and irrational mind of the main character proves to be an interesting view point for the reader. However, it's the best view to see all the changes he makes through the book. The storyline is intriguing, compelling, suspenseful, and real. While it may not end the way the main character originally thinks it should, he does find his real silver lining.<br /><br />The character development is outstanding in this book! It refreshing to read such a real, relatable, human story! While this book is definitely not suited for children, I think it speaks to all ages of adults in a way that we can relate to.
B009GX69RK|5.0|My mom introduced me to the show and surprisingly, I agree with her for once. It's a funny show and it's not an over-dramatic, self absorbed celebrity reality show like almost everything else on the air.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Awesome well-written book filled with tons of suspense and twists. Didn't want to put it down! You won't be disappointed!
B004J64QSI|5.0|This item was a gift for someone who already had seen the show and loved it.  They really loved it.

B002ZBZNPO|5.0|I really like Evanescence this album proves why. I bought it only really knowing one song, so I considered this purchase a risk. Turns out, I love it.
B008ZVNC2O|1.0|As a huge fan of Mick Hucknall, I am sorely disappointed in this album. A waste of talent with this material.  I don't recommend this one at all.

B000FC1MOQ|5.0|Found the book in a condo we were renting in Puerto Morelos Mexico, was worried abut finishing it by the time we left a week later, couldnt put it down....finished it in a few days learned after about the oprah stuff, but didnt matter, great book, great story
0345803493|5.0|I loved all three of the books!! I loved how detailed they were and I'm sooo happy with how it ended. I just hope they come out with more books like that and I'm excited about the movie
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|its not working for some reason now that it tried to update. love the game but serioisly this really isn't cool.I'm not a happy camper. I miss my game!
B00BBW16HW|5.0|I watched this film with my family. We all equally enjoyed the humor and heart to this film. Intouchables covers a serious topic, the relationship between a paraplegic man and his caregiver, without becoming sappy or boring. The film treads the delicate line between sentimentality and comedy and does it with style and finesse.
B00BGIC4I6|2.0|I love Paul Rudd and I just don't know what happened.  The movie had minimal funny bits, but it was mostly painful marital angst in a relationship that made me cringe with how awful they were to each other.
B008ASGP3U|5.0|Ian Rankin's Rebus a quintessential Scot. As craggy as the Castle in Edinburgh ! Rankin tells of the real city, a counterpoint to the smart set of McCall's New Town. Keeps up on political scene too. Rebus should be retired by now but please no !
B00BHMETKC|3.0|Argo is an okay movie for political buffs - a well made move -- but nothing earth shattering. 3 stars.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|The magnificent voice of Bocelli and the arrangements and tempo of Foster adds up to a delightful and sensous album of music.<br />Highly recommend it.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I used this music to help me study. It was great. Josh Groban's voice is great to listen to at anytime.

B00AMBLDEE|4.0|Video stopped 3x,' unable to continue'.  Had to start over either from the beginning or resume. I have cable w/router and ordered HD.<br />This happened once before , but interruption was intermittent.  Other video sources come in very good. perhaps I should order regular, not HD?  I will continue to use Amazon for their good service, ect. Just wanted to let you know.  Thank you for the refund on the first movie I ordered. Girard

B00B935SUY|5.0|I have visited several historic recording venues around the country over the past few years, and can say without doubt, that these rather arcane facilities are considered hallowed ground for musicians. Dave Grohl has brought this experience to the screen in a very tasteful, respectful way. The history of the facility is a fascinating tale; a story of shoe-string operations always in jeopardy of closing its doors, spiced with vignettes from several who recorded there. With just a wee bit of technical jargon, this 30 year old story is about the 'room', the console, the people and the magic made at Sound City. I particularly enjoyed learning that Sound City's legendary Neve console now sits in Grohl's own facility! Grohl also shows the link between live recording (on tape!) and musical creation through the musicians' interactions when jamming; something not seen much today. And although the practice of recording on two-inch tape may seem archaic and inefficient, the message is clear that for purists, it is the only way to go.  The live recording sessions near the movie's end make for a sweet bonus.  This movie is not for everyone, but for anyone who has made, or makes music, it's a great story.
030759565X|5.0|This is a beautiful book that can be displayed anywhere with many yummy ideas.  I am sure it will be enjoyed for many years.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I really enjoy the game itself. It has good graphics and story. Easy to play but keeps me busy. I would recommend it highly.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I would never have dreamed that I would read a story narrated by Death.  I have to admit that I laughed and cried and felt very sad at times.  Any book that can do that is a winner.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Ben's doing pretty well in the director's seat so far. I thought this was well written and interesting the whole way through.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Good battery app. It's nice to see what is going on with your battery. This is much easier to access than the settings menu on the kindle fire and gives more information.
0345803485|5.0|The sex was they big hype in this series of books and yes , it was awesome but, this is also one of the greatest love stories ever written so much so that I read them 2 times.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This is a must have game for anyone who would love to own a horse, but don't have the room for a real one.
0312430000|5.0|Perfect for anyone in health care. I viewed it to gain more understanding about culture change in hospitals and to prevent malpractice claiming.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I've been wanting to see the movie since it came to the theaters, but I've heard from others that the book is so much better. So glad I read it first, couldn't put it down!!!! Now off the the theater.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|I didn't expect to enjoy ANOTHER Bond movie - just accommodating 'my man'.  But, after the initial ENDLESS chase scene, this was the classiest, in-depth portrait of James Bond brought to the screen to date.  Having Judi Dench play a major role also enhanced the characterizations even though we have now lost her from this series.  The cinematography matched the fantastic scenery which could be a reason all by itself to watch this movie.  If Sean Connery had been given these lines and this direction could he have lived up to Daniel Craig's performance??  This is the stuff of which fantasies are made so rent it or buy it but definitely watch it and have a wonderful time.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|ABSOLUTELY AWESOME VIDEO.  KEEPS YOU ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT.  I SUGGEST EVERYONE WHO HASN'T ALREADY SEEN THE MOVIE OR PURCHAED IT, BUY ONE.  YOU WILL FOR SURE WANT TO WATCH IT MORE THAN ONCE.
B00364K6YW|5.0|This is a wonderful version of Jane Austin's story complete with Colin Firth's plunge into the pond which is only added eye candy.  There is also another terrific version produced by BBC in the mid 80s which is great to watch too for the varying use of Ms. Austin's words in the scripts.  Sadly, no plunge in the pond in that one but this will always be a great love story.  It really takes six episodes to tell this story in all its glorious detail and always fun to see varying interpretations of the more outrageous characters.  This story is also my 10 year old granddaughter's favorite among all which she has been watching since she was 6.  Last week she went online and found a script for this version which she now carries around with her to practice the parts.  Over Christmas she read the book with her Grandpa.  None of us ever tire of it.  Wonderful!
B004P68T30|5.0|I often use my Kindle to entertain friends' children. I was excited to be able to get Fox In Sox, one of my favorites, for them to read. I love the fact that it has several options: read it yourself, or have it read to you. It is nice to be able to give them headphones (or not, if I want to listen in) and let the little ones hear the words as well as try to read them by themselves. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who loves it in print and would like it on their Kindle.
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|We were all a bit disappointed with it in this house. I should have rented it instead of buying it. We enjoyed it, but it was far less than we expected. The good vs evil element and message is there, but the story is not as deep, intriguing or powerful as the LOTR Trilogy. I'll rent the next two before deciding whether it's worth buying.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|I could hardly wait for the release date on this and I wasn't disappointed.  It is mellow, sexy, easy, wonderful.  I listen to it some nights when I am going to sleep.
B0034GK7DM|3.0|Some of the songs as with any CD are good but some are just so so... Doubt if will buy anymore of his CD's.
B00B2TUKI0|5.0|If you are new to Madeleine, this is a good album to start with.  Her sexy, fun, jazzy voice will keep you coming back for more.
B000X418UO|5.0|I love this movie. I've watched it dozens of time. Seeing it on Blu-ray was like seeing it for the first time. Crystal clear. So glad I finally got this. I would highly recommend gettin this.
B0060AY6FO|5.0|How delightful to find a book that continues on after Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy marry. Just loved it.  Their lives at Pemberley are true pleasure.  That stinker of a man, Mr. Wickham continues to cause trouble, but the main characters Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy find true happiness.  If you loved Pride and Prejudice, you'll love Death Comes to Pemberley.
B008ASGP3U|4.0|i was glad to see Rebus was granted  another act post- retirement.  I hope there are more of these.  there's so much more trouble he and Cafferty can get into now that he's off the job
0374275637|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, and it has a lot of insight into the biases of our instincts.  A must-read for business types.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|This CD is probably the best of all Susan Boyle's CD's.  I have purchased all 4 through Amazon and am so thrilled to get them at such a good price.  Susan sings many styles, her producers are presenting her with amazing backgrounds, and have given her the opportunity to sing many venues. I play these CD's over and over again. Susan Boyle is one of the best performer/singers I have ever heard.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this game is awesome. the ponies are so cute. my little girl loves it. shes only 2 and she has a kindle fire and she begged me .
1616550414|5.0|Best book I have ever read. If you are a true Zelda fan you need to get this book it will keep you reading and looking at all the amazing illustations for hours
B00BF123WG|3.0|Felt that the story was somewhat fragmented, a character development was mostly non-existantant with the exception of a couple of main characters.
B00BT0ZDF2|5.0|A deep and wonderful movie that gives you back more then the 2hrs you put into it.  Wonderful music and themes give it poise and help the viewer feel that there is more then what is on the surface.
0525457585|5.0|I saw the movie with my kids years ago. Bought this book on a whim. Loved it. Great book to share with the grandkids. Great read at any age.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Just started playing these type games and really enjoying them! Have Birds, Rio, and Star Wars and they are addicting!
B000W93CHC|4.0|I loved Follett's Pillars of the Earth and was thrilled when my husband found it has a sequel --of sorts. AWWE is also set in the fictional English town of Kingsbridge, about 150 years later in AD 1327. Several of the main characters are descendants of our heroes from Pillars.    Fourteenth Century Europe was a lively place historically speaking, but a deathly place for those that lived during that time. It was a time of the Black Death that ravaged Europe killing about half the population. It was also the beginning of the Hundred Years War between England and France. Like Pillars, this fictional story is threaded through historical events and beaded with factual details creating an utterly compelling tapestry that is at once lovely and horribly ugly. I was left with a feeling for what life was like for the people who lived (survived?) during those times. For the first time, I'm truly thankful to be alive in our modern world (medicine, judicial system, equality, welfare, economy) even with its many flaws.    Synopsis:  Four pre-adolescent children, Gwenda, Merthin, Ralph and Caris witness a knight being ambushed by two men-at-arms in the forest near Kingsbridge village. With Ralph's help the knight, Sir Thomas Langley, defeats the two men.  Merthin helps the knight bury what turns out to be the historical Fieschi Letter. The children's fate remain intertwined from that day forward.    The beauty of this book lies in the depth of the historical research. Through each of the main characters we learn different aspects of daily life, social structures and economy. The many dozens of minor characters fill out all 1181 pages beautifully.    Through Merthin's eyes we see the wonders of medieval architecture and Europe. He and Caris develop a maddening and sometimes just annoying romance that lasts the duration of the story.    Through Caris, who is the daughter of a prosperous wool merchant we learn about the economy and hierarchy of craftsmen of medieval England. Such ashow the craft guilds operated (and from Merthin as well) and how apprentices were used. We also see how weavers and dyers worked and how their lives and their work are one. It is no wonder they were named for their livelihood, Caris Wooler, Merthin Builder, Dick Brewer, they are very much what they do.    Also through Caris we learn about the operation and hierarchy of the church and the medicine they practiced. The prevalent use of animal dung in poultices for \\"bringing forth the pus\\" and how patients were diagnosed with evil humours which were treated by bleeding pint after pint of their life's blood. It was common for someone to be treated for a broken arm, then later die of some unknowable infection. Innovation in medicine was heavily discouraged and anyone who tried risked being charged with witchcraft or blasphemy. A priory hospital was a truly terrifying place.    Through Gwenda's eyes we see what life is like for the daughter of a landless laborer. Summers of backbreaking labor in someone else's fields and winters of picking pockets and enduring starvation. It is baby brothers and sisters dying because your mother didn't have enough to eat to maintain her milk supply. After Gwenda marries we see life for a serf of a nobleman. How they could only grow what the lords declared, how they paid their taxes and were required to labor on their lord's fields as well as their own. They essentially belonged to him and were treated as such. For the first time I understand why people flocked to the wilderness of the Americas simply for the promise of owning their own land.    Through Ralph's eyes, we see the inner working of the nobility class and how one rises through the ranks. We also see the horror of King Edward III's Battle of Crécy and Battle of Blanchetaque to reclaim Gascony. Ralph rises from squire to Earl of Shiring through equal parts dumb luck and ruthlessness.    By the story's end in the year 1361, the bad guys are dead, the good guys are happy-ish and the buried letter is revealed, in a somewhat anticlimactic fashion.    Grrrrripes    A first I felt the characters were obvious derivatives of the Pillars characters. Merthin is clearly Jack, for whom I suspect the author has a particular affection. Caris is Aliena, Ralph is a cross between Richard and William... So much so, that I referred to Merthin as Jack in my mind to keep the names straight as I got to know the characters. However, by the end of the story, they succeeded in forming their own identity in my imagination.    He and I share a tendency to be overly verbose. However at least I am aware of it. He wastes page after page recapping past events. I DESPISE THAT! It feels condescending. He also takes an extraordinarily long time to get around to making a point; then he takes it and lays it on the sidewalk for you to step in over and over again. Dammit! I already stepped in that pile twice already! One particularly wet pile was hearing how Caris wouldn't marry Merthin for fear of spending her life as a slave to him and their future children. I think stating that once is plenty, and perhaps it could go unsaid and just revealed in dialogue or her actions. This is a technique called \\"show don't tell\\" from which he could benefit using. As a wife and mother myself, I would have been able to sympathize with those feelings, if I wasn't so tired of wiping my shoes in the grass.    He occasionally uses modern idioms in dialogue and in his narration. In one case, he wrote of Ralph's reluctance to invite his parents to live in with him at Tench Hall because they would \\"cramp his style\\". (Another opportunity for use of the show-don't-tell axiom.) A petty thing for sure, but my illusion of living alongside the people of medieval England shattered and suddenly here I was, in the 21st century reading a book. Guess I better go start a load of laundry.    Missed Opportunities for Redemption  I was disappointed when the two primary villains Godwyn and Ralph died. Their deathswere punitively gruesome, however I was hoping for some kind of growth or redemption. We spend a lot of time in each of their point of view's and both while both did vile acts, I was still hoping for something meaningful to come out of their lives.    Godwyn, the Prior of Kingsbridge was not an evil man, but he was arrogant and prideful. I was hoping he would be stripped of those attributes through some sort of suffering or some first hand exposure to what people sacrifice for those they love. Then he'd live out his life in a very humble subservient way or perhaps he could have saved the day somehow to someone else's glory.    Ralph, I'm afraid had to go. However, I was hoping there would be some meaning to it. Throughout the story he is self-centered, self-serving and utterly without conscience. Once he discovers Gwenda's son Sam is his own, there are flickers of something almost like love. I was hoping Follett would fan that into a flame inspiring Ralph to perhaps fall in love with Gwenda (true love, not ruthless-take-what-I-want love) and die in some altercation in which he sacrifices himself for Gwenda or Sam or both. He still dies, but we would see that man he could have been if something more than his killing instinct had been nurtured and praised.    At one point while ranting about some aspect of this book, Charley said, \\"I'm sorry you're not liking this book.\\"    \\"What? No, I'm loving it!\\"    At times I was passionately angry with characters, his writing, the way the plot was going, because I was all in! I couldn't (willingly) put this book down. I would almost subconsciously make excuses to get a moment to read. \\"Took Gabs a little while longer to fall asleep tonight.\\" \\"Girls I'm a bit tired, I'm going to rest for a few moments and read a bit.\\" Those thousand pages were gone in a flash. The historic detail, the lifelike characters, the engaging story made the words come off the page and swirl into full color life, complete with fresh breezes lilting through trees full of the scent of grass and blossoms, stifling rooms reeking of s*** and death, and the wonder of living in a time long past that is part of our composition today.
0345803485|5.0|Had bought this already with all 3 books and read them all in less than a week. Have her other 2 now to read. Thanks !!!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|When I first started reading this, I was a bit confused, but the writer tied things up very well. The writer led you on a journey that was very believable.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|Ken Follett at his absolute best with an amazing interlinked tale of people struggling through life round WWII. Follet has an amazing eye for detail, painting personalities to make them come alive in your mind and inserting characters naturally in historic events. Perhaps the best piece of fiction I´ve ever read ...
B002YCVX5S|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie, BUY IT NOW! Quentin Taritino is one hell of a director and will go down as one of the best of our generation. Loved this film, love seeing Brad Pitt in roles like these. Awesome movie and good comic relief for how rough it can be at times.
B00AK0X5VQ|1.0|There were no real instructionson how to play and it was not worth the time trying to figure which cells to touch
B001VTTRC6|4.0|Good movie. Sean Penn is a really good actor. He's come a long way from his role as Spicoli in Fast Times. Good twist at the end. Tim Robbins just can't catch a break lol. If you haven't seen it, it's worth a watch.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|Can't download to my Kindle Fire. Directions for download are difficult or incorrect for me....perhaps if you don't have Kindle Fire HD you can't download.
B00AOQ8KCU|5.0|One of the all time greats. Johnny Utah is the man!!! If you haven't seen this movie, definitely worth the price for rent. I went as far as purchasing the movie.  \\"people died, you gotta go down\\" - Keanu Reeves voice hahaha
B0060MYM7O|5.0|For me, is the series of science fiction medieval shocking and unsurpassed production and execution.<br />It's something you do not forget very easily.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Kept me on the edge of my seat! We watched all 3 seasons in a couple weeks. Every episode the series gets better.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|I enjoyed this recording very much and have been listening to it often.  It is traditional Bocelli. Great melodies, vocalizations and arrangements.
B0024FAR5W|5.0|Love my biker movies, excellent  series 1-2-3-4-5. If you like bikers like I do you'll like this series , get it you'll love it.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|Paid the 0.99 for the add free version, and it was fine for awhile, but guess what?  Now there are still ads.  Shame on you Rovio.  I even paid 0.99 for the worthless eagle.<br /><br />Your game is getting seriously boring and the invasion of privacy is the last straw.  Goodbye Rovio products - oh and thanks for ruining \\"Rio\\" with your last update.  My \\"Ad-free\\" version now crashes constantly.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|great game, It's playability on a touch screen is superb!<br />I play it on my Galaxy S3, but I recently ordered a Nexus 7. I can't wait to play it on the Nexus.
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|In-game ads are one thing - pushing the ads while the game is inactive is something else - you don't have my permission to do that!  Your product is no longer cool, and this pushes me over the top.  I've made three stars on every level and am over it, your ads on paid versions and your game is now passé.  Deleted.
B007SRLEFS|5.0|This album is fantastic.  If you like soulful acoustic driven music then this is for you. The only downside is that you will be searching for anything else he has done...Come on Glen, lets get a new one out!
1455869910|5.0|I gave this book to a friend as a gift. I read it on my Kindle and enjoyed it so much that I wanted to spread the love. Green's writing is nothing short of amazing. I could not put my copy down and finished it within 48 hours of it being sent to my kindle. I highly recommend this novel to anyone of any age.
B005LAIHPE|3.0|I had such high hopes for this film based only on its trailer, forgetting that there might be some type of filler to contend with before and after the good stuff.<br />I've since come to appreciate that there's filler and then there's pure dreck.  In the case of this movie, the first half hour is a slow torturous trek involving a silly bar scene, a case of breaking and entering, instant advancement in the Navy (apparently they will take anyone), a soccer game, occasional announcements to remind us that this is indeed a Sci-Fi flick (wait for it..........), plus a little pomp without the circumstances.  There was also an abbreviated romance tossed in for good measure, involving an idiot (Taylor Kitsch) who (as movie clich&eacute;s would have it) likes to talk to himself in the mirror.  I clocked the amount of wasted time at 36 minutes before there was any sign of the pesky aliens.  At that point I was beginning to despair, was this a Lifetime movie about unrequited love?  I paid good money for aliens and battle scenes!<br />I will admit, once the action finally started, it rarely let up and was almost worth the long wait.  The F/X was snazzy, the battles were frenetic, and the aliens fascinating (once unmasked).  But.  There was that extraordinarily long wait.  And for some strange reason, I thought this was Liam Neeson's film.  He was rarely to be seen and given precious little to do.  Instead, the apparent star of this feature was an unusually bland actor (Taylor Kitsch) who must think a perpetual scowl is the best form of emoting in any and all situations.  His lack of personality is astounding.<br /><br />At this point, I'm still debating whether to keep this for future viewings.  After all, there is the matter of storage.............
B0054SMIH6|5.0|I could not watch this movie and will not be able to watch future movies because it stops every few minutes.  I disabled my screen saver but it  continued to do this.  I saw the movie before and was looking forward to watching it again.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I use this app every night before bed to check in an see what's going on in the world of Facebook. It is very simple to use and I highly recommend it. I use this on my Kindle Fire HD.
B005OHSD3A|1.0|I downloaded this book on my Kindle but don't like using it on the Kindle.  It's difficult to go back to look for something when you don't know exactly where in the book you saw it.
1419705849|5.0|As with the other books in this series, it was enjoyable read.  The kids did not put it down until they were done.
B005HEJ2DK|5.0|I consider this iteration of the STAR TREK franchise as good or better than any of the other series. Give it a look, or second look. I LOVE it!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I had been meaning to read the trilogy forever the first book took me a couple weeks.  For the second book it took me 2 days I just couldn't put it down
B0000844M8|5.0|as a person who loves all animals, this is an amazing story for both young and old. love is everywhere in this film for the characters and the animals. it just goes to show you that persistance pays off and love knows no bounds. elsa, the big cat in the story, is fun, loving, and super smart. she shows us all that not all wild animals are dangerous. this film is for those who love animals and loves to dream big.
B0089LOKHG|3.0|I loved this series and was so excited to read this book. I spent an entire day reading and loving this book. That is until I got to the ending if you can call it that. It would be a fine ending if there was going to be another book, however it just left way to many loose ends. I felt very unsatisfied and let down by this supposed ending. You were just left wondering about pretty much everything. Not my kind of *ending*. If the author wasn't ready to let go of this book they shouldn't have. I'm pretty sure noone would have minded another book after this one just to satisfy our need for an actual ending. I have read several books like this and it always ruins the series for me. I really hope some of my other favorites don't ruin their series for me by doing this as well.
B0002MB7QW|4.0|the story here is that even through hard times people can manage to work together as a team to get through lifes hardships. this is a great movie with a few great actors. it makes a person think about the what ifs in life with an amazing outcome. if you like movies with the survival of the fittest punch lines then this one is for you!
B001S31MTQ|4.0|awesome book.  one of my favorite writers of all time.  even though i have not started reading it, i know it will be a great book.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is a great cap to the hunger games book .you will definitely not be disappointed. I kinda wish there was one more book.
B003BV8I3Q|4.0|amazing movie.  i got it just to watch such an incredible life of a &#34;martyr&#34; that changed the powerful nation, U.S.A.
0345803485|1.0|I am on chapter 13 of book one, and I'm getting more and more exasperated with every page, to the point that I HAD to put this in writing.<br /><br />It sent me over the edge when the main character said she didn't have a computer. She's graduating from college and she doesn't have a computer. She doesn't have an email. Now, I graduated a few years ago, and it is impossible to get through college without a computer and an email. What world does the writer live in? Why does she have to include such absurd and infuriatingly stupid passages? What is it supposed to tell us? Is she not aware that college students are constantly online on facebook and email and whatnot on their cellphones?<br /><br />So that's what the whole book is like: absurd and badly written.<br /><br />The vocabulary is poor. The main character is constantly saying \\"oh my\\", \\"holy crap\\", and something about her \\"inner goddess doing back flips or waving her hands\\". She's a 21 years old English literature graduate with the vocabulary of a 12 year old. This character has no personality whatsoever. We never get to see WHY the guy likes her. There's nothing interesting about her. She's blank. She's not funny, she's got no spunk, nothing. The only remarkable feature about her is that she's supposed to be clumsy (she's tripped once so far, but for some reason we're constantly told how clumsy she is).<br /><br />Now, the guy... I thought this was about an \\"older\\" guy, but apparently he's 27 and a self-made BILLIONAIRE. Yes, billionaire. And he's \\"soo hot\\" (we're reminded about it every other paragraph). Soo hot and dark and brooding and interesting and, quote, complicated.  Looks like something a 13 year old might have come up with. Oh and he has long fingers. Very long fingers. And he's hot.<br /><br />Then, the sex. That's also something that belongs to the fantasy world of a 13 year old. It's unrealistic - the girl orgasms like 6 times during her first time - it's ridiculously written, it's not hot, it just laughable and after a while gets annoying. Oh and there's no BDSM - at least not as far as I have read, which is Chapter 13, which tells you just about how BDSM this book it. The most dominant thing the guy has done so far is hold her wrists above her head.<br /><br />The guy is constantly saying \\"breathe, Anastasia\\" - and no, not in the BDSM bedroom context, but when they're walking on the street or talking in a bar. Is it some weird local expression from wherever the author is? I don't get it.<br /><br />The girl is constantly biting her lip, and the guy finds it sooo sexy, and he's constantly saying \\"stop biting that lip, it's too sexy, or I'll have my way with you right here and now\\".<br /><br />(The enigmatic, sophisticated billionare dom is so turned on by some plain clumsy college student biting her lip? That just about sums up how realistic and multi-dimensional the characters are.)<br /><br />And when I say 'constantly', I mean literally every other paragraph. The writing is extremely repetitive, from adjectives to whole sentences; in every paragraph, the characters are biting their lips, cocking their heads, or pursing lips into a thin line. That's all the range of gestures the author has come up with.<br /><br />I really don't understand what all the hype is about, and it's a shame that people will read this book and not other more deserving novels. This one is badly written, the author did zero research, the sex passages are ridiculous, the characters are painfully stereotypical.<br /><br />On the whole, it feels like it was written by a horny 13 year old with a vivid imagination and a longing for dark, troubled romantic heroes, who, unfortunately, has no clue about real life or creative writing.
B0098460O4|5.0|WE JUST LOVE JONATHAN & CHARLOTTE.  VIDEO WAS WELL DONE AND A PLEASURE TO LISTEN TOO.<br />ANYONE WOULD ENJOY IT.  WE PICKED IT UP AFTER SEEING THEM ON THE COMPUTER. PLEASE<br /> KEEP THE GOOD  &#34;CD&#34; COMING.
B00BEPVAV8|3.0|The game is not bad.  Its kind of hard to control for me and my 7 year old.  He was very frustrated with it because he wanted to control it by tapping the sides of the screen and it just wouldn't respond.  It was set right but it just wasn't working.  Overall, when it controls the way you set it to, it's a good game.
B007VUCAVO|4.0|This is a good app for tracking battery life.  It would be even better if it could prolong battery life.  LOL
B007EECSFA|5.0|Super great surprise ending,  A real twisting throughout the book which really kept your interest.  Another great Kate Morton books.  I'm looking forward to the next one.
B008NMT684|1.0|My daughter got bored with this really easily...and she is ONE. Not much to interact with. I have Tozzles and it has tons of puzzles and definitely worth the money.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|We enjoyed watching this as much as any movie we have seen in a while. Well directed and so authentic. Just a great story.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app!!!!! Though you need to get the nether, the End, and more mobs in there. I've done all i can with what I have right now.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book confused me at times, but I thought it was very good. Its must read if you read the other two books. The ending was so amazing!
B009KEN87O|5.0|I love how you guys added blockbreaker and tetris in there. Though the green brain at the end of easy is really hard.
B00BF2RTO2|5.0|Back in 88 I seen two concerts that changed my life, Pink floyd and the mighty IRON MAIDEN! If anyone remembers that awesome show in mountain veiw CA with guns and roses then you know why maiden fans will get this and why this DVD is number 1 best-selling concert on amazon. The IRON MAIDEN WILL GET U TOO. NUFF SAID!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I liked this book. Some of it was too many names but at the end she ended up with the right guy.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Loaded with incredibly good messages, many characters in the movie that we could identify with. So it almost became personal,loved it.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|A gem! Makes you think about the time you are given and to enjoy what time you have. Enjoy the moment!
B007ZXK08C|3.0|This book is a missing persons drama intertwined with a commentary on the marriage of the main characters.<br />The introduction outlines the characters well, and sets the scene for the missing person. As the book progressed, I found it difficult to like the characters and therefore lost interest. I finished the book, but was left pondering the amount of narcissism and selfishness of the characters. I felt the the tightly constructed writing lost its way at a bit past the halfway point. Interesting, but three stars only for me.
1616550414|5.0|It's just perfect for any fan of Zelda. You can just stop looking to all the pages. GO! and buy at least two
B0000X61VE|5.0|Three terrific workouts, two 40 minute and one 10 minute. Cindy cuts straight to the chase, the workouts flow quickly without stopping forever to explain every detail about each exercise.Just hit it, music to keep ya going, get it done and move on with your day. These workouts build strength, flexibility, and endurance. Stick with it and your body will change; I saw results in a week and dramatic results in a month. I've bought many other workouts for variety, but ALWAYS come back to this one. After using my VHS for about 15 years, I just purchased the DVD so I can travel with it. I love these workouts!
B0094K20FK|5.0|Still probably the best of the originals!  Has some of the all time lines in it.<br />Must watch for Trek fans.
B0058YPG2K|5.0|Since the turn of the aughts, television bloggers and critics have been on the prowl for the Greatest Show Ever, and Breaking Bad, alongside Mad Men, but just short of The Wire, seems to be the series title that is most frequently bestowed the honor. I don't know if this kind of talk is anything more than a lot of hyperventilating and knee-bouncing, but it's tough to deny that Breaking Bad, to paraphrase a line from an earlier season, has made a lot of hay from what initially seemed like a short-fuse premise. As it turns out, the balancing act at the center of it all—Walter's willingness to do whatever it takes (up to and including homicide) to protect his family, offset by his character deficiencies and extraordinary ordinariness—is the story gift that keeps giving, and powers most of the episodes, up to and including the fourth-season finale.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|This dictionary is very useful. I am a senior in high school and it does great for vocabulary words and helping to expand my vocabulary in writing assignments.
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|I would have liked to see some additional materials about the making of the film, but I certainly respect Spielberg's feeling that any home video release of Schindler's List should focus on the subject matter, not on him. It's another reason why I like him: While some directors might feel the need to talk about themselves on a home video release, he prefers to stay in the background as much as possible and let the subject matter speak for him.
B002AF4Y9G|1.0|For Oliver Stone to defend this film as \\"A Social Satire\\" is absolute nonsense. The movie portrays graphic violence for the sake of portraying graphic violence and nothing else. Any profit derived from this folly should be given to the families of victims of violent crimes. Shame on you, Mr. Stone!
B00BGIBVRG|2.0|This movie was terrible.  I was really looking forward to seeing it because I loved Knocked Up and I really like Paul Rudd.  HOWEVER, this movie was NOT FUNNY AT ALL and it was a never-ending complaining/whining session from the main characters.  I kept hoping it would lighten up and there would be some humor in there but it didn't and there wasn't.  I would definitely not recommend this movie.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Chews up and spits out everything I throw at it thus far. I mainly game on my computer and this processor is barely even phased by most of the games I have thrown at it (BF3, ARMA, Tomb Raider, Most new titles). At this point I haven't even bothered to overclock it yet because it just doesn't seem to be necessary until perhaps the next generation of titles start coming. At this point I also still have the stock cooler. I have yet to see the temps rise above 65 F. This would lead me to believe that an after market cooler is not needed unless you are overclocking, at which point I would absolutely recommend going with at least a HYPER 212.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I have only used this a couple of times. Read the reveiw and since I do not always have my kindle plugged in, was concerned that it might drain the battery. I haven't noticed that being a problem. It might be useful to know though, that if you have something else playing, it will just play over it or with it. I found this out this morning when I woke early but just wanted to rest so I put on whale sounds and suddenly heard a mans voice (I had it set to a song) in with the whales. I was half asleep and thankfully this is not my main alarm! But other than that, I really do like this. It has a feature where it slowly increases in sound and not being someone who likes to be jolted from sleep, this is perfect.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Always trying to top my highest score.  Fast paced; recommend everyone give it a try.  Would love to see top ten scores posted, something to reach for.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|what a great cd!  i love justin timberlake's music and was happy to finally get this much anticipated cd from him.
B00BSBT8M6|2.0|Thought the movie was overrated and dull much too long.  It dragged the scenes in the ocean were much too long and became dull and much too long.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|I'm have a real issue with this app. It works fine to download music (witch is just about all I use it for) but it create these peaky files that show up in my gallery. It appers to be downloading the hole video when all I want is the song help!
B00BSBY38A|5.0|My wife and I really enjoyed this movie. Great story very well done. We didn't know anything about it other than it won at the Oscar's.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|If we had not watched the previous Seasons we would have had a hard time understanding and liking it.  We did not like the ending of Season 3.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My husband and I are in grave danger of becoming full-fledged Anglophiles after watching both Season 1 and 2 of Downton Abby on Amazon Prime. And now we've finished Season 3, which we recorded on our TV computer, and can't wait for Season 4!<br />Highly recommend for anyone looking for well written drama with characters that make you really care about them.
B00BHMF578|3.0|Starts off slow but gets better about 2/3 thru. Okay film for a lazy evening.  For me, once is enough.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This was a good read.  The pace of the book is fast and the plot is believeable this is the second book or Lee Child that I've read and it left me wanting to read more of this authors work
B005EVVESM|2.0|this cd was the same way as the other.  took a week to get here and was all cracked on the outside even though it said I bought a new cd and was poorly packed in the box.  Nothing was around the cds to protect them or anything on the box to say to handle gently since it would be easy to crack  them
B00B49L7JY|5.0|Try not to read too much about it before you watch. It does justice to the artist and the music and tells a great story.
B00846WWVM|3.0|I think this would be great for my 7 year old niece.  For me, it's a little simplistic, and there were NO instructions or hints.  You just have to figure it out.  Which is ok, and doesn't take long, but I'm an instruction sort of gal.  Like to know what I'm getting into.<br /><br />Like some others, I also ran into some trouble on getting the nozzle to go the direction I was trying to tell it to.  I think there's a little bit of a bug there that could be worked out still.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|Its a really good game once you<br /> start to play it you wouldn't want to stop playing it.<br />I really and truly enjoy this game
B009L7MD44|4.0|A very good way of adding capacity to any IOS or android device.  The interface could be better but is not difficult to master.  The App is not an improvement over the safari browser and if anything does not work as well.  Specifically,i it did not play my saved TV programs while the browser interface did.  When you consider that I now have a TB off additional storage to draw on, I would rate this product a buy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My kids love this game.  They really really are good at it, even my 5 year old can do this game.
B000JMKNV0|5.0|Barely remembered the movie, so the story was still &#34;fresh&#34; to me, in that I knew I was trying to look for something, but still couldn't figure out what that thing was.  Just a testament to how great of a novel it is.
0783240236|4.0|A great movie, state of the art effects,  seeing birds lined up on the telephone lines, won't give you the same feeling after watching this classic Hitchcock film.  Long before Jaws, and not wanting to go near the water, Hitchcock, gave us birds ... from which there was truly no escape .... maybe &#34;stay indoors?&#34;  I saw this film at my high school, during the summer of 1965 (inexpensive screenings at the school, to keep kids out of trouble.)  Beyond some sleepless nights, it instilled in me the art of film making
B00ANA27IU|5.0|This is the first Arthur C Clarke book I've ever read, and it will certainly not be my last.  Now I understand why he is considered an all time great of the genre.  2001: A Space Odyssey is one of the best pieces of science fiction ever written.
B00A9T1HUO|4.0|As a Josh fan it is hard for me to be objective.  However, this is much better than his last CD and I have purchased it for several people.  There are a couple of songs I'm not crazy about but, in all, it is another good Josh CD.  Love him since he was on Ally McBeal.  He was a little kind but I was thinking &#34;this kid has got to be going somewhere they didn't just pluck him off the street&#34;.... boy was I right.  I recommend this CD - well worth the money.
0345803485|1.0|Nothing really happened. No suspense, no twists in the story...nothing. On the positive side, this book was a diamond in the rough. It had the potential to be amazing if it were better written and edited. There were grammar and punctuation errors and severe over usages of the words murmur, whisper, inner goddess, flushing etc.  I experienced deja'vu reading this book, because the writing style reminded me of the \\"Sweet Valley High\\" books that I read in middle school.<br /><br />The characters could not have been more UNREALISTIC. Christian was portrayed as a gorgeous self made billionaire in his late twenties. He's also a concert pianist and skilled pilot. We see guys like that everyday, right?.......LOL The Christian character should have been a gorgeous millionaire in his late forties (a 'la Robert Downey Jr. or George Clooney). A gorgeous guy with \\"copper\\" colored hair???  Ewwww!  You can keep your carrot top dude, Anastasia.  I rolled my eyes at the stupidity of the submissive contract that Christian wanted Anastasia to sign.<br /><br />The cheezy immature teenager expressions was the downfall to the Anastasia character. The sex in this book is more comical than erotic. You will literally laugh out loud when Anastasia describes her buttocks as her \\"bottom\\" and vagina as her \\"sex\\" or \\"down there.\\" No wonder Mila Kunis refused the part of Anastasia Steele in the upcoming movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|at first i thought i wouldn't like it but no i am addicted but now my kindle stopped working so i have to wait.
B005IFWXWU|5.0|Being from New Orleans, we really enjoy and appreciate what Hugh Laurie has done on this ablum.  we saw the performance on pbs.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|A funny well done cartoon with a pretty good plot and excellent animation.  Kids will like it.  Adults will too.  Recommend purchase or renting it.
B00846WWVM|5.0|Fun to play and yet challenging. Takes a while to get the hang of it but is worth the effort.
B004LROMWU|5.0|This is a good series as far as SF TV goes.  1st Season starts after the successful invasion with remnants of the military and civilians trying to cope.with, basically, the loss of civilization as we know it.  Good story line.  Good visual effects.  If you like SF then this series is one you should like.  2nd Season is complete and the 3rd Season would be the new one.
B00BRR66SA|4.0|I give 4 star .I wish would have put more song on the Cd only target add two more songs but it's a nice road trip cd take from me iam a truck driver
B005LAIHSG|4.0|A good romp in the woods, hills, and dales.  Fun movie with plenty of action.  A good movie to have with beer.  I enjoyed it.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|anything by this author is great.  I really can't wait for the next two books to come out.  This author writes to slow
0817439390|5.0|This is an outstanding book -- clear, well organized and a valuable addition to my library.  Recommended for anyone new to digital photography, or anyone needing a refresher.
B005LAIIFS|5.0|This movie is one of the best movies ever. I enjoyed the story, the characters and the fight scenes. I laughed, cried and had fun while watching this movie with my fiance and her family. A movie any family should  really see.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I have played a few of these games that give you the game for free but to really play the game well; you need more things.  It is possible to play this game and not spend money and it is interesting if you have the time and patience to play.  Nice game.
B008476HBM|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It is well written and there are characters that are up-to-date. So it makes easy to relate to this book. I recommend this book to everybody who appreciates good language and richness of content
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it I like the part when u get hit. bye the train and the dude hits the screen lmafo.
B005CRQ3NY|1.0|It was very bad. No good parts .if you hate this book then you know what I am talking about
B00782O7IY|5.0|I like to watch a good movie without all the violence and unnecessary sex in a story.  Three more words.
B000K4WPCC|5.0|I love this movie. Absolutely one of the Hottest Covenants, EVER!!! Taylor Kitsch, Sexy as ever. Along with the rest of the cast.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I have read Bared to You so this was a continued story to almost finish the story until Intertwined book is released,
B008ODZUN2|2.0|I thought the lead actress was a fool for making this movie. It was beneath her ability and a waste of a HD disk
B00846REIS|5.0|I have read 50 Shades of Grey, where were these authors when  I was growing up.  I would have like to try sex toys.
B006ZS4SXQ|5.0|My ten year old grandson, an experienced Lego guy, spent considerable concentrated time, but was successful. It ran as planned. Maybe not for everyone, but great if person capable.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I find that I like to read the book first before the movie.  But I didn't this time.  I need more than one way of understand the plot
B00787IR2Q|5.0|Kids loved it -- kept waiting for the the tag line &#34; Honey I shrunk the kids&#34;..They loved it and the VOD feature is so cool...
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I am glad Mark Owen ( I assume is not his real name) told us the truth about the mission of killing Osama  in the raid
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I have not had a chance to see the highly rated movie yet and after reading the book, do not feel the need!  Nicholas Sparks had me on the edge of my seat along with feeling the emotional ups and downs of each character.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I have not read this book yet.  But I will read it and hope the movie is still playing at a theater
B001O1O71C|5.0|This book is cleverly written, engaging, and has an unexpected ending.  The story makes one wonder about why humans behave the way they do. I like the unique viewpoint  from a child's eye: It is very naive yet  haunting.
1451673442|4.0|I like to look at things with a good attitude.  I am not a negative person they totally drain me.
B00005Q4CS|1.0|The DVD arrived in a thin paper package taped loosely in packaging tape. When I opened it the DVD case smelled horrible and was very sweaty. Then when I attempted to play the DVD I found that nothing I put it in, (my laptop, DVD player, etc.) would read it, even after thoroughly cleaning the disc. So All In All this was horribly sent. Though the shipping was very quick. NOTE- I did buy a used version, but it said that the DVD was \\"like new\\" so I am still very disappointed in this product...  As for the content on the disc I can't say but I've heard it's an amazing movie.
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|I am leaving August 30 to Cote Azur so I thought it would be interesting .  Maybe I will see some of the sights from the book
B00003CXDD|5.0|Movie was delivered promptly and functions perfectly! Thank-you :-) Willow is a must-see! Shame on anyone who hasn't taken time to see this fantasy classic. Don't think Val Kilmer ever played a better role. And everyone loves the brownies, they are funny! Watch it!
B0087JTAKW|4.0|I like Mitch Albom.  His books always make you think.  Time is very importand and it is interesting how it can get away from you.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great game, starts off easy then gets a bit harder and so on, your on a roll then u get stuck.... really makes you think. Great fun.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I would recommend this app for all who enjoy and want to learn the spiritual journey. Plans that will help you read  the Bible in a year or any plan that fits your need.<br /><br />Different versions for your convience. Just a great App. and free!
006107327X|5.0|Timm and the others in this project spun TV animated shows on their heads. Everything since this show has felt the influence. This was handled so well, not just campy, &#34;churn something out every week,&#34; they tried to make mini movies. But they also made sure to have fun with it. You can take yourself far too serious with Batman, but they treated it so fair. no wonder Batman has endured so well.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|It was very enjoyable to watch these to performers interact with each other.<br />This will be a Christmas present to family members next year.
B0053O8AQE|5.0|I love this show. It is hilarious. There isn't an episode where I don't end up laughing like crazy. It's witty, well thought out and a fun show to watch. The story line is also pretty good, but the comedy is the best part of it.
B000FA675C|5.0|Dan Brown's eponymous best seller doesn't need my two cents worth of praise, but for those who have not read it, go find it and enjoy.  One of the best religious thrillers ever printed.
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|Wonderful special effects following the tale of Bilbo. A prequel to The Lord of the Rings trilogy that follows the novel to a tee. Really great tie-ins to the LOR series and looking forward to seeing the follow up. Worth the rent in HD!
B00992CF6W|5.0|great one of the best apps I have ever got totally recommend this to people with a good imagination if you love to build and craft
B00B2EWBMI|5.0|Excellent film with a classic Kung Fu plot. Great special effects and wonderful martial arts fight scenes. All done to one hell of a soundtrack. You can definitely see Tarrantino's style in this. Great characters and written by RZA. No complaints!
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|I bought this combo just for the Blu-ray, specifically for the visual effects with an added bonus for special features.
B000BKHL1K|5.0|Very easy to install, fast shipping<br /><br />wife loved it, would recommend to friends or family.<br /><br />highlight of the room it is in.!
B00BHMETKC|3.0|good story, good acting, good photography . . . but, nothing exceptional. its a typical 3 star movie. it was worth the rental.
B0020M99LC|4.0|I have seen &#34;Casino Royale&#34; a few times now, and I have enjoyed it every time.  There is not as much subtlety as other Bond movies, but it serves as a nice transition into this new era of Bond.  Well worth at least one watch.
B005GSY23M|4.0|I was watching the movie for like the 4th time and decided I needed the soundtrack. The three main songs I heard in the movie are the first three tracks. They are my favorite. Number 4 is from the movie, but I usually skip through it. The rest of the tracks are just the scores from the movie. No lyrics. My girlfriend says they sound like video game music and she dislikes them. But I say, if you loved the movie, you'll love the soundtrack. Of course if you only like the first three songs, you can save some money by downloading them individually.
B009ERK1T0|3.0|I love Deftones but i can t tell u that this is their best work..... .Its not bad at all though. BUT I expected much more from my favorite band to be honest....
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Fast pace and well done mystery.  As usual Grisham does it again. How can a white guy write in the voice of a black man so convincingly.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a nice game!  Oh, wait.  I mean that its an Awesome!!! Game.  The 5&middot;5 and possibly 6&middot;6 levels can be for young kids, while the harder  levels are for older kids and adults!  Did I mention its free?!?!  Cool, huh?  Its addicting and fun! I played it for hours on end! Great time passer.
B0047SF41G|2.0|i have a fast comp but this kept stopping and going very many times good movie bad connection thank you
B0043WHRWA|5.0|I am avid fan of the Castle series, and would recommmend everyone that likes mystery, comedy, romance and drama to watch all the five seasons.
B00004VW35|5.0|As a kid, this was my first Neil Young album.  Someone gave it to me on vinyl and I listened to it a lot for several months.  I really enjoyed it - especially Get Back to the Country, with the very catchy jaw harp. When I stopped playing vinyl records many years ago, I forgot about this album - until it popped up on my recommended music on Amazon.  I purchased it at a ridiculously low price and it immediately brought me back to my 12 yr old self dancing around my room to this country music.  I like it even more now than I did back then; maybe because I've gotten more into country music in general. And because I've become a huge Neil Young since first spinning this record way back then. To be clear, even though this was MY first Neil Young album, I'm not necessarily recommending this as the best first Neil Young album for someone new to his music.  But if you are a long time Neil Young fan, and especially if you also love country music, you should absolutely add this to your collection.
B003TH2LYY|5.0|I am avid fan of the Castle series, and would recommmend everyone that likes mystery, comedy, romance and drama to watch all the five seasons.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Nice game for those times when you only have a few minutes to spend on<br />Something that Isn't stressful, just fun.
B005GG0MIS|3.0|I'm not quite done with the book yet, but I'm about 80% through it. This is well written, but focuses too much on major historical events of which any reader would (or should) be aware.  There could have been a bit more revelations about the personal relationships between presidents outside of major foreign affairs issues when they would obviously collaborate. Not a bad read and there are several interesting scenarios that are not common knowledge.
B001UV4XHY|4.0|This completes my set and I love all the movies. I can pass them down if family likes them the way I do
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Absolutely incredible.  II love the series, the actors and the storyline.  Great show!!  A show to put on your &#34;must watch&#34; list.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|I loved this story because it drew me in by first introducing the adult Pi and then allowing me to identify with the child Pi, his curiosity, his need to believe in God, then showed the strength of his human spirit when faced with an impossible situation.  Made me watch, just to see what happened, how he survives physically, emotionally and spiritually.  Great story!!
B004J64QSI|5.0|This was a live performance filmed in London in 2010. The entire cast did an excellent job and members of the original cast come out at the end to sing a few numbers as well. It must have been incredible to be there in person when this was filmed because watching it at home a treat in itself.
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|What troubles me is how good 'The 20/20 Experience' is. Every song is like 8 minutes long. It's like Pink Floyd decided to have sex with late 70's Michael Jackson and have a baby. You'd think that baby would come out ugly. But it came out beautiful
1449410243|4.0|I got this book on a whim at the local library.  I left it on my desk for a week so I could read it on breaks.  Every person who walked past my desk would pick up this book, flip to a random page, and then start laughing.  By the end of the week people were making excuses to come to my cube just to read more of the book.  If Amazon had a spike of sales this week on this book they can thank me.<br /><br />Not every comic is hilarious but the ones that are are so funny that I would be literally crying in the break room while convulsing with laughter.  I will be purchasing this book for my coffee table collection and I eagerly await the release of \\"My Dog The Paradox.\\"
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game improves over and over one game to the next. First temple run I was amazed. Temple run brave improved upon the first but by far this one is my favorite. The graphics are amazing. Just plain old AMAZING.
B008AUGEFC|4.0|The book arrived earlier than expected and it had a cool bookmarker included! I'm enjoying the reading very much, a great book
B005RJ6DUK|5.0|My family and I love this movie. It is about an Italian family. Robert DeNiro is the dad, and he is trying to raise his son best he can and instill good, moral values in him as he grows up. But when his son witnesses a killing by a mob boss and doesn't snitch, the mob boss takes him under his wing and instills his own street smarts into the kid as he grows up. So the boy sort of gets the best of both worlds even though his dad and the mob boss do not approve of one another's teachings. The boy also falls for a young lady who is of a different race than he is, and conflict arises because of his culture. But you have to watch this in order to see how it all fares out, and you will be surprised at the end.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|new to facebook as of january and love the different sites that I have liked and send me awesome photos of places I might have never seen.  It's great!  Found friends and connected with old friends.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I loved this book. I had a hard time putting it down. You get involved with her struggles both physically and mentally. I was tired, hungry and scared right along with her. It made me want to go walk the trail, but she tells about the reality of it. I wanted to know more about her and her life in the end. That is a sign of a good book for me. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes reality based books.
0385535147|5.0|My first Grisham novel in a while, and I liked it. The plot was a surprise - that is difficult to accomplish now with so many mysteries written every year.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really love this game &quot;My Horse &quot;. I love it because you groom, clean the paddock, feed, train the horse, and more.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|Nuff said this movie is amazing, i cannot wait for the extended release and the Desolation of Smaug although i was disappointed that the only special features were the youtube Blog Peter Jackson had before the movie was released.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I love the look of it! I recomend his app. I loe that you can change the covers of the books on your shelves. Sometimes you dont want everything lumped together. Try it!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This was a great experience; suspenseful, exciting, heartwarming. I couldn't read it fast enough- I was greedy, hungry for every word. I highly recommend this book!
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|love the game. hints available if needed. games is simple yet challenging but not frustrating. love The game. I wish more of these mystery games were like this!
B004VSTP4Y|5.0|I love Maggie Stiefvater's writing. Though the first two books in this series were, in my humble opinion, better. However, she was able to end the series with Forever wonderfully, with a little room for maybe a follow up? :D Love her books!
B0026PA05M|5.0|I first heard about Halestorm through a facebook post. First song I heard was &#34;Familiar Taste of Poison&#34; & I loved it! There aren't many songs by this band that I dislike.
B004I744AS|4.0|Not only do you find the word you research, but you have elements history, word games, and trivia. Entertaining and enlightening and at a great price!!!
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|I first heard about Halestorm through a facebook post. First song I heard was &#34;Familiar Taste of Poison&#34; & I loved it! There aren't many songs by this band that I dislike.  One of my favorite songs from this album is &#34;Rock Show&#34;
0618918248|5.0|This book says what so many are afraid to say.  It does it in a perfect way.  Some maybe offended by this book, but so what? So many are offended by religion.
B003ES61EE|5.0|Very practical cleaning system. I use it a lot. It looks good, its usefull and dont take much space. I recommend it.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Great game. Very addictive. Wish it was longer as I feel it ended fast. Not a game for kids, but great hidden objects games.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Looks like a lot of people love this app, but on my kindle fire hd it glitches all the time! Rarely loads weather and stalls. Not worth it :/
B009EANE3M|5.0|Every song on this album is good, don't have to hit the skip button :) This is their best album!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I could not stop reading this book. When I wasn't reading it, I was thinking about it. Wonderful page turner u didn't want to end.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This story drew me in and pulled me swiftly along.  The life lesson was like a flower, naturally and subtly present until it bloomed at the end.  This was a quick read, but the ideas in it will stick with me for a long time.
B001KDQ4KQ|1.0|I usually like Jodi Picoult but this was very poorly written and unconvincing. The characters seemed recycled and the reasoning was absurd. I didn't finish the book.
0679805273|5.0|Great!
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|watched this together with my husband and 16 yr. old daughter and her friend.  One of the rare movies that we all enjoyed.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I loved this game so much. Ever sense I got it i have not been able to but it down. Everday after school I will run to get my kindle and play this game.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Though still a soap opera in format and continual crisis, It's well written and well shot and very well acted!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Can't say enough about the characters or writing style of this series. I enjoyed every minute of reading these books.
B009MF56GC|5.0|Action does NOT come more badass than this, the expendables is a proper old school movie for fan boys who grew up with these classic movie icons of the 70s 80s and 90s, this movie is packed with all the regulars from the original plus a handful of new comers all doing what they do best looking macho and kicking butt, the addition of a bigger role for Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger only makes it more fun and they must have used every classic cheesy one liner ever from their popular movies of the past. Jean-Claude Van Damme was an awesome villain and its good to see him on the big screen again, the action is bigger and better than before with plenty of bloody carnage to sink your teeth into, if you loved the original this wont let you down its a chunky, bloody macho fan boy wet dream of an action movie, this series is a one of a kind guilty pleasure, check it out!
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|this game is really fun for me (12yrs) and my little sis (5yrs). I would recommend it for anyone who luvs a good race against time :)
B00A2H9LK6|4.0|The original silent hill was a brilliant and near faithful conversion into a movie with a great story and a very freaky and nightmarish visual concept that a lot of horror movies lack these days making it a rather original and very enjoyable romp, revelation is part two of the story set several years later with several characters returning, the story I thought is a good direction to go and it carries on the nightmare very well with a quality budget of spooky dark visuals like the original had and some cool new monsters as well as some of the classic ones from the original,silent hill has some unfinished business to take care of, if your a fan of the original you should really enjoy this for what it is, it has had some very negative reviews which are undeserving, its not a masterpiece but its by far not the worse film this year! Great fun check it out!!!
B008RXYOKY|2.0|When ordering this Apple Thunderbolt to FireWire Adapter, you should be aware what you're getting.<br /><br />This is for connecting Firewire drives to the Thunderbolt port on your computer.  It does NOT work if you're trying to connect a Thunderbolt drive to a computer that does not have Thunderbolt.<br /><br />Also, as you can read from some of the other reviews, it doesn't work with some bus powered drives or when daisy chaining.<br /><br />So, if you want to hook up your old Firewire, externally powered drives to you new Thunderbolt computer, this is the connector you need.  For other workflows however, you're SOL.
B005LAII3U|2.0|This remake is very different to the original in practically every way, except for the character names and a few plot similarities it really is a completely different movie, for me it didnt work, the original Schwarzenegger version is a cult classic and cannot be matched, the new remake had a much more dull plot and by the end you dont really care what happens, there is not any stand out scene in the movie unlike the original, this was a wasted opportunity to make a very cool sci-fi but unfortunately its all been done before, Colin Farrell was ok but not a convincing Doug Quaid, the thing that was good about it was Kate Bekinsale and Jessica Biel they were great in their roles, the effects were pretty decent and the futuristic look was cool even if it was stolen from Blade Runner and the Fifth Element, overall its worth a watch, newcomers will like it more but fans of the original will get nothing but the feeling to watch the original again which is still the far more superior Total Recall.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|The game was very interactive and probably the best graphics I have seen.  Even my 7 year old was able to enjoy the game.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Fantastically entertaining movie from start to finish, this is absolutely Tarantino's best work since pulp fiction, if you thought inglorious bastards was good this is better, the story was great, I have never seen any original so am not comparing it to anything but purely the style Tarantino brings to every genre he tackles. The cast is amazing, every actor is top of their game in this and the character development between Foxx and Waltz is great to watch, Jackson is brilliant as always and fits right in probably giving one of his best performance in a while, the movie will obviously offend people due to its theme and racist language etc but on a whole it's a strong movie with a good pace and don't feel like nearly 3hrs, there is a level of humour to the movie which was brilliant, you cant really help laugh and there is plenty of violence, Tarantino has gone all out with the blood in some awesome shootouts, this is great stuff top filmmaking a must see!!!
B00BI73CVI|1.0|Hugo's Les Miserable is one of the greatest stories ever written. Webber's musical left out a lot of the great parts and emphasized a lot of the raunchy stuff, but has two great musical numbers to compensate. I recommend seeing the Liam Neeson/Geoffrey Rush/Uma Thurman/Claire Danes version of the story and just listening to music that you like on Spotify. I disliked this portrayel so much because I love the story and the 1998 movie version and the broadway revolving stage musical. This is not a family friendly movie. A wasted great opportunity.
B0090SI42Y|5.0|Great movie, very entertaining from the stylish and bloody open sequence to the bloody finale, great story jam packed with classic martial arts scenes and styles from different types of movies from over the years, the cast was great, RZA does an awesome job at directing and starring as the man with the iron fists, Russell Crow was a big surprise he is very good, Lucy Liu is great to watch as always, and the rest of the cast was great too, its jam packed with gory fights and death scenes and the cool brass body assassin, this movie is very original and so much fun, if you love films like kill bill and wild over the top martial arts movies this is a must see, great soundtrack too and great features and good picture quality.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Wow- such an incredible book! Buy it now! You will be thrilled! The best book to use as a total escape from reality.
B009MO5960|5.0|Yet again another awesome sequel in the brilliant resident evil series, this is a must for fans as these movies are mainly aimed at their major fan base now, the story continues really well with lots more cool twists and turns and the return of very many familiar faces from the past, the effects are top notch as usual and the movie soundtrack is awesome too, Milla jovovich is amazing to watch and her character Alice always gets better, the ending to this one is even more mind blowing than the last so roll on part 6. The 3D is top notch and works well too. Check it out.
B005LAIHZY|4.0|My grandson and I went to see this while on vacation last summer.  We thought it was a very good movie.  I wanted to give it to him for his collection.
B007Z0TL1W|5.0|Yet again the French pull off another amazing horror movie, probably the best horror of 2012, a fantastic new take on the vampire genre from the same directors as the gore fest Inside, The story is great and has so many original elements and fantastic set pieces and a great cast, there are plenty of scare moments and creepy atmospheric music to accompany the scenes, as you expect there is plenty for gore hounds as the movie is a bloodbath near the end with some awesome gore effects and some cool creepy ghostly effects too, this is an awesome horror and must be seen, the bluray picture quality is very good and the disc does have some features too making it a great purchase, gem of a film.
0446547646|4.0|I think I gave this review to the Bend in the Road.  However, I enjoyed it also as it had unexpected turns.
B00B04NJLW|5.0|This is a great collection of mini movies all to do with death in some way, 26 horror directors from around the world were given a letter A-Z and asked to make a short for this feature, most are filmed and a couple are animated but they all are unique and disturbing in some way, many people will not enjoy this purely because some of the content is very controversial and morbid, for horror fans this is a must, some of them are not great but most are brilliant fun and its an enjoyable couple of hours thinking WTF is going on here sometimes, its certainly unique and could spawn many sequels potentially, if you liked V.H.S then check it out.
B005S9EK1S|4.0|I had read the book and wanted to see the movie.  This is another of Sparks best work.  I felt they stayed fairly true to the book.  I felt that we had seen Zack Efron as the man he has grown to be.
B00BN3DPQ4|5.0|Arnie is back!!! And he has still got it, this is an awesome comeback for the king of action movies, he maybe getting old but he's still very entertaining, this movie has a simple yet cool story about an escaped prisoner who picks the wrong town to go through while plotting his escape, there is plenty of bloody violence in this movie which is surprising for its 15 cert! The rest of the cast is good, Johnny Knoxville is funny and entertaining as usual, the movie has its comedy side which works well, overall it's a great start for Arnie and a must for fans, he will be standing a lot longer yet.
B008KUE4BS|4.0|I always like to read the book, if I know there's a movie made from the book.  This was one of Sparks' best.
B005LAII80|5.0|Forget about the original judge Dredd movie with Stallone because this is miles better!! This is brilliant comic book filmmaking, the whole feel of the movie was very like the comics, the story is good and feels like a first chapter for many possible sequels, for a small movie the effects are spot on and look great, the cast is cool Karl Urban is perfect as Dredd and has all the right expressions, the fact he never takes his mask off is very cool too, Lena Headey is an unusual choice for a villain but is very good and pulls it off well, there is plenty of over the top bloody gory violence too which you expect and some cool slow motion scenes, the 3D is also used very well and works perfect, any fan will love this finally Judge Dredd gets some justice on film.
B003YBUSMW|4.0|I haven't had the chance to use it much but what I've played so far it works pretty well.  I know if I had more time to play with it I could fine tune the steering better as it has a bit of understeer right now. The pedals work pretty well but the chair (recliner) I sit in makes it a bit uncomfortable to use.  I found that the paddle shifting worked very well and I would prefer using that to the included shifter.  Overall I think most people would enjoy this wheel but can see advantages to having it mounted on a table versus on the lap.  I've actually gotten pretty good at using the original controller for steering but now that I've bought this I will use it at times.  Maybe when my grand kids come over and we race head to head.
B005LAIHCW|5.0|I was almost put off watching this after such negative feedback but was very glad I did as it was a very good film, the story was great, right from the start it pulls you in and keeps you interested and wondering as to just what is going on, the overall feel of the film was very 80s in its style and title and the way the story played out with a few twists that are actually quite good, I had a lot of fun watching it and would certainly watch it again, Jennifer has done many roles and this is certainly one of her best she looks fantastic and helps the film along well with good character interaction, the films not that gory or anything it's a sweet and simple horror/thriller with good story and twists and some creepy vibes and scares, good entertainment well worth a watch!!! The bluray picture is very good.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great product that I'm using constantly to check how much battery is being used. The added bonus of letting me know how long each separate process will operate is also very useful. Thanks for a great product.
B0088749CW|5.0|Brilliant movie, very entertaining from the beginning up until the end, lots of twists and turns, the movie essentially starts out as some kind of horror/thriller then a quarter of the way through your thrown right off with a big twist and think what's happening here? The story then unfolds cleverly into a completely different type of movie with a deep yet satisfying conclusion; Jessica Biel is amazing to watch and gives a convincing performance and carries out the story and the twists nicely, Jodelle ferland is also amazing in this too. Certainly worth a watch, brilliant thriller that's original and clever, shame there are hardly any features but the picture is good on the bluray.
B00BR476TG|5.0|Had to cut the preview short it showed so much I thought it would be too much. I really want to see the movie.
B005LAII9O|5.0|This is certainly one of Stones best movies in a long time, a very cool story based on a novel by the same name, this feels very much like a Tarantino style movie the way it plays out with great fun and interesting characters that get themselves into some sticky situations as they mingle with the wrong people, the movie centres around the three main characters Chon and Ben and their girl O whom they share, they grow and sell the best weed in town and get mixed up with a rival Mexican drug cartel who kidnaps O and then everything goes wrong as the two boys turn to violence to get her back, it's a well paced movie that keeps you going with strong performances from a quality cast Salma Hayek, John Travolta and Benicio Del Toro are all great supporting cast, this is well worth checking out, the extended bluray cut is around 10 minutes longer making it around a 2hr 20min film.
B004SCN2F6|5.0|The developers make this game interesting to play by allowing us to unlock new items and specialties. I love how they also continuously update the game with new and/or better features. This is one game I won't be deleting from my Kindle.
B009POCFTG|5.0|This is an amazing film from the director of the exorcist, it shows he still has some real talent after all these years and especially with choosing his cast, every actor in this movie was amazing!! McConaughey was brilliant (I never thought I would say that) the best thing he has ever starred in and Juno Temple is amazing, such young talent and the supporting cast was great too with Gina Gershon and Thomas haden church both great, great story with powerful and memorable performances and a cocktail of nudity and strong bloody violence, a true modern classic that must be seen, gem of a film!
0307950689|3.0|I was hoping this book would measure up to the Da Vinci Code and spare the reader of the blasphemy.  I guess I should be happy with one out of two.  Washington DC isn't Rome, and the plot is pretty weak.  Looking forward to Inferno.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|It's a frank book about a complex man. Very few have had as great of influence on our daily lives as he has. I only hope we can can strive to live up to the high standard of quality and purity in design in our work.
B006S08RLU|5.0|It's cute.  It's funny.  It's thought-provoking.  It will make you feel good about life and love.  It's a great movie to watch with a group of friends.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Very nice and sad movie.  I recommend people to watch this movie because if full of adventure, nice picture and unexpecting ending.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Fine, accurate, helpful. Plenty of informations about the battery and its duration in reading, gaming, messaging and so on. Let your friends know it.
B00785P2QC|4.0|It's a fun game! But some cons, I don't like having to integrate it into my social media stuff. Good game for a time waister!
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|You must read through about 45% untill it starts to get interesting.<br />Very good book though. Yet, there is some foul language involved.
B000ICXQXI|4.0|I have  only seen bits of this classic and since the tv program started I wanted to see it fully.  It wasn't what I thought but I'm happy to have finally seen all the way thru.  If I had not already known how it ended, I would have been surprised
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Modern Combat 4 is an excellent fps for touch devices. The graphics are insane! The environments are crisp and clean, and great detail goes into the characters. The controls are very easy to use.<br /><br />Campaign: Campaign is a continuation from the previous Modern Combats. The story goes into great depth, and there are many twists and turns. I am enjoying it!<br /><br />Multiplayer: Multiplayer has taken a tole for the better! Online is extremely fun and a great pastime. You can create your own classes, customize your weapons, and use kill streaks. There are lots of online players, especially during the weekends. There are many fun game modes such as team death match, VIP, death match, ect.<br /><br />You have the option to turn of blood and gore, but there is some strong language so younger players beware.<br /><br />I love this app and recommend it to players 13+
B008YKGQR4|4.0|Than the regular app for Kindle. The only thing is when you click on a link, it sometimes gets hung up. You can actually sort.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|One of those books that after struggling through the 1st half, tried reading the last chapter, this just made me persevere and return to where i was before I went to last chapter. Unsure whether I made the right choice, despite the twists at the end.
B00846REIS|5.0|Although the plot is very much like 50 shades it wasn't like reading the same thing.  The moved smoothly holding your attention page after page.  I would recommend reading this book even if you have read 50 shades.  I enjoyed both  books for different reasons.
0345803507|5.0|The trilogy was great from book one, then two and you couldn't stop until you read three. I have already passed the books on to a friend and have another waiting to read it! Bravo!!
B003UBTX6S|4.0|This was just as good as the first and I want read the next one to see how it works out for everyone.
1883010039|4.0|I'm a new weaver and needed a comprehensive book of instructions for my loom. This book fits the bill. The directions are simple and clear. There are exercises designed to teach technique and solutions to problems. Highly recommended
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|when i saw this game here in the appstore i was so surprised. the only reason i dont have it is because there is no money on my device yet. if you do GET THE GAME! you will thank me later
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like subway surfers because it takes you on lots of adventures and journeys it also helps me do all the things I want to .
B000FA675C|4.0|Solid book other reviews will better serve you.  Picked up for free on kindle. Great deal for free!  Looking forward to his next book.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Just try putting this one down!  Holds your interest, sometimes edge of the seat, lots of twists and turns. Enjoy!
B006LSZECO|4.0|At first the book starts off slow but then I couldn't put it down. It is long, over 400 pages but well written. I was kind of disappointed in the ending but I guess there was no where else to go with the story line.
B0064MGU98|3.0|Hilarious! More last minute courtroom saves than Parry Mason! All brought to you by the beautiful and outrageously underpaid Investigator, Kalinda Sharma. This show is pretty mediocre. Predictable plots and hackneyed political correctness.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|This movie had it all. Great special affects, humor, touching plot and a wonderful love story.<br />I was very impressed with all it had to offer.
B000RPCK1U|5.0|do enjoy watching 007 movies, would recommend people to watch a great show. start from the beginning of the 007 movies and enjoy the technology how it improves with every show.
0062014536|2.0|I loved this book! But the ending was extremely abrupt and gave no clue as to what happens after the story ends. I had hoped for a much better ending than that.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My little sister was addicted to the adorable game the moment she started playing it. When she showed it to me I was easily hooked aswell!
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|So i got to be honest, I wasnt a bruno mars fan, well not a fan big enough to purchase his album. But I have a loved one who is incarserated that asked me to purchase it. I did and I CANT GET ENOUGH! I love love love this album! It has such a great blend of new with old sounds. Its sexy, sweet, angry, passionate and fun all in one!
B00AZRBLHO|2.0|Maybe its because I'm a tech writer, but this could've been done in a lot less pages *and* more clearly. It spends so much time getting to the &#34;ah-ha!&#34; moment that its actually more cumbersome and confusing rather than explanatory. Plus I'm normally a very fast reader, and I found myself delayed time & again by the prose.
0618164413|5.0|Great to have all the Curious George stories all together!  This little monkey never gets old. I have a little monkey at home who, like George, is very curious and often getting into trouble.
B001RIY4WE|4.0|I would have given it 5 stars but, I don't like the whole main menu of this Blu-ray...You should just be able to watch all the special features without wi-fi!!! But as far as the movie goes its special effects in the movie were way superior for its time and still are awesome today by director James Cameron!!!
0811879542|5.0|This is a wonderfully ingenious book that involves kids by getting them to participate in a variety of ways.  They press the dots and things happen to the dots - they change color, grow, etc.  The kids follow directions and watch things happen.  My niece loves it!
B006H5120E|5.0|I have had a lot of fun watching this movie on 3D because there are a lot of people moving around and much going on too. A MUST GET!!! Good old James Cameron! Classic!!!
B001GM28HO|5.0|what i was looking for friend is a big fan told other friends and it made the perfect gift for a certain someone
0553385461|5.0|I enjoyed this book a lot, however It's more or less just a quick read to me so I can just read it to &#34;avoid&#34; reading &#34;A Brief History of Time&#34; again or read to get started in Stephen Hawking's books and &#34;world.&#34;<br />If you have trouble reading the &#34;A Brief History in Time.&#34; In any way or read it to get into the subject!
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|bad ass game I really enjoy it!!!!! its soooo like Cod!!!! Great work and effort on this game!!!! Multiplayer was made amazingly well!! Great work!!! Damnable good game!!!
B005IQZB14|4.0|First, this is not a book about backpacking.  It is a book about a woman that has spiraled to a very low point and uses the time on the trail to forgive herself and let certain things go.  It was very entertaining to read, but I wouldn't try this at home kids. As a backpacker myself, she made a huge amount of boneheaded 'trail' mistakes that she could of easily figured out if she would of went on a few 'pre-hikes'.  I mean really, why would you pack a huge roll of condoms for a 1,000+ mile hike.  What would you be planning to discover on this trail??  However, as I mentioned, it's not realy about the trail, but of her self discovery while on this trail.  She had some grit though, I'm not sure I woulda lasted with such issues, but is what her burdeon to bear and bear she did!  It's a good read, however don't use it as a how to guide on hiking the PCT.
B00AZKCU7G|4.0|Steven Spielberg's \\"Lincoln\\" is both a sprawling character study and a behind-the-scenes story of how the United States came to abolish slavery. Rated PG-13, the film contains really just three scenes that are too graphic for younger children:  the opening Civil War battle sequence, which is extremely violent; a scene mid-point where Robert Lincoln refuses to go inside a hospital with his father, but witnesses something far worse than wounded soldiers outside; and a scene near the end when Lincoln rides a horse through a battlefield filled with dead soldiers.<br /><br />If you shield young ones from those scenes, and maybe plug their ears for the punch line of a story involving a picture of George Washington hanging in a bathroom, they'd be able to watch \\"Lincoln\\"--though I can't imagine any of them lasting very long. \\"Lincoln\\" will be too slow-moving and, at 150 minutes, too long for most children. The film is driven by dialogue, and the scenes of backdoor politicking that appeal to adults may seem confusing to children. Daniel Day-Lewis is amazing, Spielberg's attention to detail is phenomenal, and \\"Lincoln\\" is a great movie. But it's not a great pick for family movie night.<br /><br />James Plath<br />Family Home Theater
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I heard about this book just after my Mom died.  Reading it brought great comfort as I could sense the truth in Eben's experience, a truth my heart already knows. And it's great to have affirmation.  I highly recommend this book.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Although there were some blairing omissions in the logic of this tragedy, the book was well written and a page turner. If you like a marriage mystery that turns tragic, this book is for you. It would be four stars except for all they hype surrounding it, I expected more.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This is such a great book to read. I honestly couldn't wait to get it, very difficult to put it down.  I love this novel!

8876250441|1.0|Stephanie Meyer writes vampire fiction as many teenage girls do -- overblown writing, sexy cold vampires, and a vacuously attractive heroine who serves as the readers' stand-in. WARNING: spoilers.<br /><br />But as fluffy and shameless as Meyer's past work has been, she dips far below her past nadirs in the ghastly, sluggish \\"Breaking Dawn.\\" There's a grotesque twist toward the book's spluttering end, and it becomes painfully obvious that Meyer was determined to give everyone an utterly happy ending. And she'll sacrifice whatever plot or characterization it takes to get that happy ending.<br /><br />Resident \\"Mary Sue\\" Bella is getting the royal treatment from her fiance Edward in the days before they marry. The wedding goes off with only one hitch -- her ex-love-interest Jacob's anger at her impending transformation into a vampire. But newlywed bliss doesn't make for a terribly interesting grand finale, so we get the expected twist -- Bella's pregnant with a half-vampire baby.<br /><br />Jacob becomes even more upset when he witnesses the violent birth of Bella's magical super-special baby Renesmee (nickname: Nessie) -- only to have something unexpected (and very icky) occur between himself and the newborn. But turning into a vampire won't solve Bella's problems, because it turns out that other vampires are gathering in preparation to attack... and it's due to the birth of Renesmee. Oh, the suspense!<br /><br />Authors often create all sorts of endings for popular series -- sad ones, happy ones, bittersweet ones, and occasionally ones that make absolutely no sense in relation to the series. Unfortunately in \\"Breaking Dawn,\\" Meyer has opted for the last type of ending -- and that finale starts the moment Bella gets pregnant, and becomes more absurd and inane as the story drags on. It ends up being rather difficult to care what happens to any of the characters, because the readers are being assaulted by a string of absurd plot twists.<br /><br />Not that there's much of a plot to twist -- Meyer desperately pads out the flimsy storyline with a lot of florid prose and endless melodrama. The first part of the book is pretty much consumed by wedding drivel and subsequent soft-focus sex, but after Bella becomes pregnant everything spirals down the drain. All this drama culminates in a ghastly birth scene that may turn some readers off ever having kids. Vampire teeth are involved.<br /><br />Having exhausted what little plot can be wrung from a Edward-Bella marriage and subsequent pregnancy, Meyer struggles to somehow fix this by introducing a Big Bad Threat to the new family's happiness. Unfortunately, it has all the climactic impact of a soggy firecracker. As the final indignity, Meyer crashes down a vaguely pedophilic plot twist for Jacob, so he won't be too lonely. You can almost hear the thin plot cracking in a thousand places, as Meyers strains to give a Happily-Ever-After for everybody.<br /><br />Bella remains one of the most vacuous heroines in modern literature -- she has the passion and intellect of a wet mop, but once she becomes a vampire she is also shockingly graceful, beautiful, powerful and self-controlled. In case you haven't noticed, she's just amazing in every way -- and it's difficult to control one's gag reflex when reading about a glaring self-insert made so utterly perfect.<br /><br />Not that the supporting characters help much -- Edward has yet to develop an actual personality beyond adoring Bella and being an insensitive controlling jerk, and poor Jacob is turned into a pedophile. And the Ultra-Super-Special Vampire Baby is almost as nauseating -- and even more featureless a personality -- as the mother who spawned her.<br /><br />\\"Breaking Dawn\\" would better have been called \\"Breaking Down.\\" Stephanie Meyer had a good thing going with the vacuous vampire soap opera, but here she rips it apart and turns it inside out.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|Really an amazing book.  For those of you who want to spice up your love lifes, this is the book for you.  Don't judge the critics without reading it yourself.  You will be very impressed and leaves you wanting to read more.
B008220D7S|2.0|\\"This is 40\\" isn't a terrible movie by any means, but it's not very good either.  Paul Rudd and Leslie (Mrs. Judd Apatow) Mann, play Pete and Debbie, a married couple who happen to have their 40th birthdays days apart from each other.  Like most married couples, Peter and Debbie have all sorts of problems.  Paul gives money to his moocher father (Albert Brooks) that the family can't afford.  Debbie has a thief (Megan Fox or Charlene Yi) working at her boutique.  Paul's indie record company is on the verge of collapse.  Debbie is mortified over turning 40.  The older daughter watches too many episodes of \\"Lost\\" and so on.<br /><br />There are some laughs in \\"This is 40\\" but not enough to carry justify a 135 minute running time.  Whatever happened to comedies such as \\"Blazing Saddles\\" or \\"Animal House\\" which told good stories, provided lots of laughs, and were finished in about an hour and a half?  The movie could have been better if Apatow hired an editor to remove unnecessary scenes, such as one in which his teen daughter has a tantrum over wanting new clothes.  This adds nothing to the over all story.  That's not the only scene featuring the girls which don't serve the storyline at all.  Speaking of which...<br /><br />The Apatow family is very attractive.  The wife is hot and the little girls are cute as bugs.  Unfortunately, they aren't great actresses.  Leslie Mann had a bit role in \\"The 40-Year-Old-Virgin\\" and a larger, but still supporting roll in \\"Knocked-Up\\", however, she really can't carry a movie as a lead actress.  The two girls, especially the older one, also aren't the strongest actresses in world. This has got to be the worst case of cinematic nepotism since \\"The Godfather Part III\\".<br /><br />\\"This is 40\\" is worth a rental but not worth the purchase.<br /><br />Peace.
B000B5XOQQ|5.0|No matter how many versions of King Kong are made, this one with Fay Wray will always be my favorite.  It just cannot be beaten.
B00BF11STU|3.0|Much of the movie was hard to understand for me because I didn't know all the details of the events and terrorists names. The last 15 minutes were good though.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Great season, love the actors and the writting.  Great show looking forward to watching season 4 and season 5 soon.

0446547573|4.0|I wanted to read this book before catching it at the movies.  Something happens at the end that I totally didn't predict.  I liked this book!
B00BGIBVRG|3.0|The movie started out funny and the storyline was building well at the beginning, so at first I thought I was going to really enjoy the movie. However, as the movie progressed the character development was lacking, the storyline fizzled, and the plot really didn't go anywhere. If you like crude humor, which I do, there were funny laughable parts throughout the movie that I enjoyed, but if you are looking for a good story or satisfactory ending you won't find one in this movie. I did not feel sorry for or fall in love with any of the characters or their issues throughout the movie. Therefore, overall I think this movie is just OK. Something I would not choose to watch again.
B005K17RU0|1.0|Not much to say about this one. I still use the Weather Channel because AccWeather didnot download at all. sorry

B00BHHIWQO|5.0|good. fast paced game. need more free credits at a time though. needs to increase in challenge level to abbey really competitive.
B004ZRV3AU|3.0|This product arrived very fast.  The company ships out quickly.  Arrived as advertised.  It's a little harder to use than shown.  Half of the bottles I score still crack un-smooth.  I am practicing to get better.  This product would benefit from having a holder to lay the glass bottles in.
B00884GR0W|3.0|This game is amazing.  I absolutely love it.  The problem I have  with it is that it force closes all the time.  This game is fun, challenging and honestly beautiful.
B001ECQ75A|5.0|The DVD arrived on time.  The kids are enjoying it.  Everything has come about as expected.  It's not my cup of tea, but the kiddos (and hubby) sure enjoy it:)
B000006YCU|5.0|I personally like this album very much. I really like DT, I mean, it's one of my favourite bands. You can here in this album great pieces of music indeed. To be honest, I think this is one of the best debut albums ever!
B00BETX5PS|4.0|Very good flick.  The movie streaming quality was excellent on the Amazon download app on my Roku device.  Easy to get and operate.
B000AYQJ3I|1.0|This product was sent from overseas and I wasn't able to watch it on my DVD here in the states.  I wasn't aware that the<br />DVDs aren't the syncronized the same.  Therefore, when I contacted the seller, my money was refunded and was told<br />to keep the product.  Needless to say, it was useless to me.
B00BCZU8WM|3.0|I've listened to this album non-stop since I got it hoping that the songs would grow on me but sadly that's not the case.  \\"Mirrors\\" and \\"Suit and Tie\\" are the best songs on the album and I'd say they are marginally good in comparison to the work he's put out before. The length of the songs don't bother me!If a song is really great, who wants it to end? But you do want it to end if its not that good. I mean some of the songs are boring! (can't believe I said that but its true)I get that he loves his \\"new love\\" but the message gets a little old after a while. We all know who this album/songs is dediciated to and I think it's the best wedding gift ever! I guess he wanted to keep the theme consistent. I am disappointed in the drug,spaceships and bubblegum love metaphors, they have been OVERDONE. It's really corny. I personally think this album should have been the follow up to Justified. Futuresex/Lovesound musically was on another level, I mean he and Timberland really brought it with that album. The 1st song knocked me off my feet.. I digress..This album just feels like they were playing around in the studio and decided to hit the record button. The whole rat-pack getup feels a little gimmicy and again OVERDONE in the music industrys image dept, but I do love his pompadour. Regardless, I am glad he's back musically. I am a fan of Justin's music..have been since the first NSYNC album. Let's hope the 2nd album of this experience is an improvement because this by far this was a let down.

B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Witty tale of a determined & feisty young Scottish girl in medieval times seeking independence and wanting to exert individuality.  It is far from the standard.tale of pretty young thing meeting heroic prince, marrying and living happily ever after.  Watched it with 3 of my grandchildren (ages 4, 7 and 9).  Just the youngest was a bit perturbed at the mom to bear transition.  Had to laugh at the idea of a Scotland swarming with bears, however.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is as good as it gets.  Had to go buy Season 3.  Can't wait for 4.  Loved that the first two seasons were free with my Prime membership.  Watched on iPad.  Perfect!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is a game...loved it..adventure, not too long or too short..really hated for it to end..look forward to playing more
B00B2H28SM|5.0|I stumbled across Tegan and Sara while nursing a seriously broken heart... at the time I'm pretty sure that \\"Wake Up Exhausted\\" and \\"Where Does the Good Go\\" saved my life. Anyway, skip ahead to my discovery of their new album, \\"Heartthrob\\". I caught the lyric video for \\"Closer\\" several months ago, and then weeks later kind of randomly stumbled upon track 6, \\"How Come You Don't Want Me\\". After hearing the song once I purchased the mp3 format of the deluxe edition of \\"Heartthrob\\". I've had the album for four days and can't stop listening to it. Seriously, I think I have a problem. Tegan and Sara are like a reinvented Cyndi Lauper... perfect writing, impeccable musicality, and just the right fusion of pop/indie rock. I'm addicted and I can't get enough.
B002W5UVSM|3.0|Well written but very different from what I am used to reading. May have to try another book like it
B0090SI3ZW|3.0|First off, let me begin by saying that Rza did an ok job with what he had.  For a guy who had not directed a decent budget film, this was alright.  Now to break it down.<br /><br />The basis of the story was there.  We had the feud between clans, the emperors gold that they were after, and your quiet hero (the blacksmith).  He developed the relationship between the blacksmith and the prostitute fairly well but there was nothing about how they met.  How could a blacksmith win the heart of the prostitute with a heart of gold when she is kept in the brothel all the time?  ALso, what is the origin of the bronze man?  We have no idea why he had Marvel hero like powers where his body can change to bronze when attacked.  In addition, Rza's narration was, most of the time, too low to hear and when we could hear, it was difficult to understand him at times.  Even during the film, his lines were muffled almost beyond recognition.  I had to rewind it to try to understand what he was saying.  Next time, get someone who has a background in narration that can portray your sentiment as the central character.<br /><br />One small gripe I had is that it seemed like the times were not consistent.  At some points it looked as if this movie was set in the 1800s in the midst of slavery and some times it seemed like it could have been in the early 1900s (wardrobe, weapons, etc.)  I was confused at some points.<br /><br />Continuing on, there was too much filler in this movie.  At some points there were just meaningless scenes that felt like music videos.  For example, there was about a 1-2 minute scene of the women in the brothel bathing themselves with no dialogue or anything.  It wasn't a segway, it was just a meaningless waste of film that had no bearing on the rest of the film.<br /><br />In addition, the gore was way overdone.  You should not hear the sounds of the blood packs squirting out as the character removes the knife from your neck.  It seemed cheesy and just overly dramatic.  A continuation of this, make your effects consistent.  If you use CGI for your gore and blood spatter, use that throughout the film. Don't use blood packs for some fight scenes and CGI blood splatter for another, it makes for choppy non-uniform production.  At least Tarantino uses blood like substances throughout and keeps his films consistent.<br /><br />So while my review is all over the place, I will sum up quickly.  While this film is not bad, it is not great either.  It sits quietly in the middle with its perks and its shortcomings.  I would like to see Rza refine his craft and give it another go, but the film just needs to be more comfortable with itself and not trying to live up to the name of its producer.  Rza has a nice vision of film and his story was there, but it just didn't develop completely for me.
B005VPRGB0|5.0|This product is awesome and well worth the money!!!  It was pretty hard to put together, but worth it in the end!

B006BAEQB2|5.0|Knowing what happens to the narrator of this installment, I did not expect to be drawn into her point of view.  Surprisingly different take from Philippa Gregory's other narrators which pulled me despite myself.  The White Queen, The Red Queen, and The Lady of the Rivers certainly don't have to be read first to enjoy this book.
B000I9X668|5.0|One of the best movies ever made. I can't tell you how many times I have bought this movie and lost it.

B009CF7GRY|1.0|A remake is rarely as good as the oringinal and that is especially true in this case. On top of that, the acting leaves much room for improvement.
B005FRF6PC|5.0|Amazing book! I loved every second of it! I was actually reading this for a school product but i found it to be completely interesting and a very good book! 5 stars!

B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Great movie - quality stream.  I like how easy it is to rent a movie if we do not find anything worth watching on TV.  Does not cost much over the cost of a store rental (about the same if you figure gas).
B002XTBEDI|5.0|I am a big fan of British series and this one fills the bill perfectly. Drama, comedy and love all rolled into one
B0049VZ222|5.0|Well the show itself is fantastic!  We watched most of them on TV but missed a few so purchasing the whole season was not necessary, but enjoyed watching then ones we had already seen again.
B0068PHS5Q|3.0|The language was nice but a little over done.  The female lead was a bit contrived and annoying and the plot twist was fairly transparent.  It istill held my interest but only just once I got over the first few chapters.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|This was a good movie and streaming was good.  I would recommend to anyone that likes this type of movie.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is a fantastic show.  We missed a couple so bought the season to catch up before it came on TV again.  A must watch!
B00BF11STU|4.0|First off, I never rate movies based on 100% historical accuracy.  That just doesn't happen in Hollywood movies; PERIOD!  Some may come close, but Hollywood dramatization ALWAYS inevitably overrides facts, so I rate movies based on entertainment value ALONE and NOTHING else.<br /><br />Secondly, I hate it when people leave 1-star ratings based on Amazon viewing problems in place of an actual review of the movie.  Those ratings are an unfair representation of the movie, as opposed to an indicator of how good or bad the movie may actually be, and can deter potential viewers from watching.  There IS a &#34;feedback&#34; feature that you can correspond with Amazon through in regards to such people, and they are very good about refunding your money when problems are incurred!<br /><br />Now for the movie review.  This was not the greatest movie, but it was not a bad movie, and I ended up liking it.  Based on some of the reviews, I thought the torture scenes would be extremely disturbing to watch, but I actually found the scenes depicting such to be rather brief and, although uncomfortable at the worst, very mild compared to many, many, much, much worse depictions (refer to the TV series &#34;24&#34;); these were a cake-walk.  I don't get how many reviewers believe this movie takes the stance that &#34;torture&#34; is an effective tool either.  I've never been a member of the military, nor CIA, so I have no idea what or even IF any such method IS effective or not, and we certainly can't count on either of them to tell us if it actually is ISN'T.  Even if the director was &#34;taking a stance&#34;, I could care less, but she only hinted at both sides of the issue; barely and very briefly mentioned from the viewpoint of the interrogators as opposed to Obama's stance.  On that basis, I can't buy that this movie was simply a &#34;propaganda&#34; ploy against &#34;torture&#34; based on such either.  It's just a MOVIE, and this one is simply about the very strong convictions ofONE WOMAN who was determined to find the MOST WANTED MAN IN THE WORLD!!!  I have read a few articles that claim the character &#34;Maya&#34; is based on a real-life female CIA agent who was integral to this mission.  However, who really knows if that's true or not or just how integral she was?  I highly doubt that any government agency will EVER confirm such.  There were some details in the movie with parts that contained actual audio, recordings, and new's coverage clips from around 9/11, and in subsequent years, some of which were heart-breakingly sad, and others which were enlightening, therefore interesting to me; as I'd not seen or heard about them previously. I thought the movie did a good job of depicting how utterly and painstakingly tedious it had to be to gather reliable data, as well as how integral every person involved was in gathering any and all of that data and following every lead to attain possible &#34;targets&#34; for interrogation in gaining any useful knowledge necessary to finding UBL; which was in no way, shape, or form because of the work of one woman here; surely it took thousands just to intercept & decipher the sheer volume of &#34;white noise&#34; between other agencies, countries, &/or Al-Qaeda communications, and to sift through all tips received for years after 9/11; despite Chastain being presented as THE driving force and ultimate &#34;hero&#34;.  If she is based on a real person, however, I wish I had been her.  I mean hey....leave it to a woman to search to the ends of the earth and never stop until she's found the man who's really pissed her off or hurt one of her babies, and I know I would've done the same were I in her shoes.  However, I found Chastain's (who I'd never seen nor even heard of before but who's acting ability is undeniably good) character &#34;Maya&#34; to be somewhat too serious to the point of being bland, and reserved or guarded thus less stoic than I'd expect, therefore not all too believable as a heroic CIAagent, for about the the first hour or more.  Then her much feistier, absolutely determined, side finally erupted and Chastain was in her element.  My favorite line from her was &#34;I'm the MF who found the place&#34; in response to Gandolfini's character; then later &#34;One hundred percent in that building; ok...95% sure, cuz I know 100% freaks you guys out.&#34;  The movie did drag on a great deal in that previous hour or more though (actually kept checking to see how much time was left in the movie - and it's a long one - wondering if it was EVER going to get more promising or end with an explosive climax or not).  Then finally, sadly after the loss of a colleague, things started to become more intense, which is when Chastain's character really took on a whole new life. The story was a very good one, though, and AGAIN if even anywhere near factual, probably a historically important movie for everyone to see; although a &#34;factual&#34; documentary would suffice for that purpose, and you could just let this be a good movie to watch as it was entertaining enough for me to bear with and end up enjoying!  This was the 2nd of all the movies nominated for Oscars that I've viewed.  &#34;Argo&#34; was the first, and I still stand behind my opinion that Ben Affleck and his co-producers deserved the Oscar for it.  It was much better paced, and even if not 100% historically accurate (which many reviewers of it found fault with too; nag, nag, nag), it was a great story &#34;based on real events&#34; most of which WAS factually accurate (despite an &#34;unrealistic&#34; scene at the end which I personally thought was very entertaining and added to the suspense despite knowing what the outcome was going to be, contained great humor, was well acted by all, and very intense throughout.  I, sadly, did not feel that same intensity throughout this movie as I expected to, so that was somewhat of a let-down.  Overall, though, I recommend watching this movie if you don't go into thinking it's gonna be 100% historically accurate, action-packed from start to finish, or very intense throughout; as well as if you're not an amateur critic who feels compelled to over-analyze and tear down every aspect of a movie with descriptions that make you sound like a 2nd or 3rd year drama school student and in terms that I honestly don't even understand or care about, or if your political views run so deeply you can't actually enjoy a simple movie ;)

B00BEZTMWW|5.0|As a major fan of this book, I was eagerly anticipating this 3d blu ray release as I had not had the chance to see this in the movie theaters.<br /><br />For the movie itself, I was not anticipating the additions Peter Jackson and his team placed into the prequel story line that were not in the Hobbit book.  Yet, these additions were a very nice surprise.  In the end, this is one of my favorite books and a lot of love went into making this script and movie.  I must say, I will be a fan of watching this movie multiple times.<br /><br />I want to hit most on 3d for this movie as I have not seen many customer reviews specific to 3d.  In general, the wide screen format 16 X 9 2.40 aspect ratio is not preferred in my opinion for 3d.  I have a 55 inch TV and still would rather see the entire screen in 3d glory as Avatar and Avengers recently did.<br /><br />That is my only gripe and it's a small one.  Let me start by saying this may be my favorite 3d movie made to date.  I say this because there is such a focus on depth in this 3d experience and it adds an experience you could not get with 2d viewing.  There are several scenes that really pop in my mind when thinking about this.<br /><br />There is one scene where Gollum is chasing Bilbo and he is about 50 feet away creeping behind a rock to find him.  The depth of the cavernous hallway and Gollum's eerie eyes on Bilbo was fantastic and I don't believe you could have achieved this type of visual without the 3d capability.<br /><br />Next, the chase scene of the goblins in the Misty Mountains was incredible.  I do believe that the visual effects achieved in Peter Jackson’s King Kong movie were put to good work in the Hobbit and 3d again provided depth and perspective you could not achieve otherwise.<br /><br />The crisp details of this 3d experience were top notch and certainly deserve to sit with the best of your 3d library.  I did not see one episode of ghosting and I was looking for it.<br /><br />In short, this movieexceeded my expectations in every way, was an amazing start to what is likely to be a phenomenal trilogy and provides a must see 3d experience.<br /><br />I eagerly anticipate the next movie.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is pretty basic, but it's easy to get caught up in! If you like puzzle games, you will likely enjoy this game.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|the legend of seeker is a great show that got cancled what! It has the seeker fit guy with  a powerful sword he can kill dozen of bad guys at a time the girl in white confessor who can make man her slaves oh s***! And tall wizard zed who can shoot fire what the! And they face a whole huge empire and huge army led by evil dictator darken raul. All good actors and character and story better then game of thrones so why did it get cancled? Bad advertising maybe.    Ps.the second season is even better i saw it on tv on the cw a couple of years ago love the morth sith cara.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Really love the stories. The HBO series is pretty faithful. Considering the scope of the books it would be impossible to create a tv series that would cover all the little details. HBO has done a fine job casting and telling the tale.
B008CLI4N4|3.0|Game of thornes is an all right fantasy show that shows kingdom famillies fighting over power in a fantasy land. Show's really violent and sexual girls are hot.Lucky dwarf!the show is all right but not great it is not a must see and legend of the seeker is better.
0142412147|5.0|i like how there were three authors and they were able to write stories that were linked to each other.

B003IKMR0U|5.0|Zombie dice is a quick and easy game to play for anyone and some how still manages to be fun.  A game won't really last you longer than 15 minutes so it is a nice game to play if you don't want to spend an hour or more playing a table top game.
1926778537|5.0|It's a shame that THQ (game publisher) is in financial troubles.... This game is great and the design of creatures by Madureira is the best. Please buy this.
B00797MB0O|2.0|I usually don't try & wait for a plot to build, or character development. I have a short attention span with movies. I really tried to do both with this movie, and was terrible disappointed. I couldn't even finish the movie. So it's possible the last 15 minutes were fantastic.
1781164266|5.0|Dead space is not only a great horror/action videogame franchise  (perhaps the best in this generation of consoles) but has a great design for creatures and ambients. This is a great books, similar in content and beauty to the Art Of Mass Effect or The Art of Assassin Creed 3
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Very easy to download/watch instantly. The quality of the documentary itself was fantastic. I loved the material it covered, how informative it was and how honest it was. This is a definate keeper! Loved it!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm a 64 y.o. male.  Just got a Kindle for my birthday.  Read the WSJ last week and read the article on Wool and was fascinated w/ an artist's drawing of the silo.

B006GWO5NE|1.0|The Kindle does not connect as a storage device without asking for a program to be loaded into the desktop.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Personally, I like The Dark Knight better because the Joker character is so disturbing. Bane and company are scary, but they are on a mission to save the world in the only way they think they can. The Joker is s psychopath and will definitely induce nightmares. Anyway, this movie is very movie and a great end to a wonderful Batman series!

1591843162|5.0|Hey Seth,<br /> I just wanted to thank you for the impact your book has had on my life and tell you about my journey through this revelation. A Month ago I had stumbles across the audiobook for Linchpin. I didn't really quite get the book but for some reason the part about resistance and how essential it is for a person's growth, really stood out and I had buried it in my subconscious. I am a truck driver at a Pepsi distributor in Newburgh, NY. Eleven years ago the company was at the top of their game. They were named bottlers of the year by the Beverage Industry and was grossing over $300 Million dollars in sales. We did this by mainly focusing on customer service and teamwork. As the economy took a turn and went down, the focus slowly shifted from customer service to only focusing on the \\"numbers\\" and cutting costs. It had gotten so unbearable to work there, Especially when they made you feel like you more of a machine than a human being. With this being said, this brings me to Last friday, 2 weeks after I had listened to the audiobook for Linchpin, I woke up with a strong feeling that I had to talk to the Vice President of the Franchise. My gut feeling was fear and to not do it, but my intuition was stronger. I went through with it and told him why I felt the company had taken such a fall and suggestions to what can be done to make it better. Surprisingly, he had thanked me, said I was wise beyond my years and to thank my parents for doing such a good job raising me. With everything that had happened, I decided to listen to your audiobook for a second time and this time I was completely blown away!! Everything that I said in the conversation with the Vice President of the franchise was in your book. It was a complete epiphany for me and I see life so clearly now. I believe Linchpin is the secret to life. I realized that I love to serve people and that is my purpose in life. Last year I had started a business, not knowing what the purpose was and just did it by following my intuition. I now believe I understand the whole concept and purpose. I truly cant thank you enough, you have changed my life forever and I believe that your words will keep pushing me to become a successful and better person.<br /><br /> Thank you so much again for everything,<br />  Sean Rysdyke
B000QCTNIW|5.0|My wife recommended this book, and I have to say it changes the way I think about staying alert and active as I grow older. I almost want to make an entry into my living will to have my family read this book in the event something catastrophic happens. Never give up. Never, never, never give up. The brain is a amazing piece of work.
B007VYAJAE|5.0|Before watching this movie, I only knew of the popular songs of Bob Marley. I only decided to watch the movie because I was curious about the story behind the legend and how this documentary got a flawless 5 star rating. Truly well deserved, this movie depicted the intricate details on how he processed his music, how he developed it, and became such a highly regarded person throughout the world.
B0034G4OYK|5.0|Didn't think I would like this but did.  Nicely developed characters and a very well done scripted, paced and presented storyline!<br /><br />My big turn-off to getting this was Adam Sandler...his voice over was OK, others could have done a much better job of it.<br /><br />But bottom line - definitely worth adding to your DVD/BluRay animation collection.
B008ODZNLG|5.0|From the biography of Chef Jiro, the emergence of successful business, and the future of his legacy, the movie well depicted Jiro's dream come true of making mouths happy with his life long earned skill.

B005NS0VNU|5.0|call it an intro to the band. for me, as a newcomer, i didnt know what to expect, but i was curious all the same. when the voice of reason emerges from chaos, you stop and listen to what is being said. maybe a trip down memory lane for the initiated, but for me, it was a mixture of familiarity as well as a type of sound that was brand new. be prepared to keep an open mind as you enjoy how their sound has changed and evolved over time, to bring them to where they are at today. just a sign of more greatness to come... im staying tuned.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|You gotta love the British!  This is such a good show...I'm so glad someone recommended it to me!  I'm a fan!
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|life isnt much without an imagination... and there's plenty of that here. listen... and keep an open mind. lose yourself in the lyrics and try to keep up with the beats. the material is challenging and doesnt settle. every mood is intensified and played out to an extreme... its like wearing each one and stretching it out to see how far it can go... and having fun in the process. there is darkness and melancholy... with a hopeful outlook in the end as the music makes its way into the light. in other words, it is about the process of transformation and how vulnerable we are while we are in it and hoping to make it through.
B0097HSS4M|4.0|This is a good basic photo editor for my Kindle Fire HD, it was well worth the 99 cents is cost.
B000B5UL7G|5.0|when you are self- aware, nothing impresses you very much. until you listen to this album and realize everything you thought you knew, was wrong... just wasnt true. a new take on society and how we shape and form ourselves in it. call it social commentary, you will find yourself open to every taboo that is broken down and put into verse. if you laugh, cry or feel any emotion at all, know you have allowed the music to do what it is supposed to. its is healing in its own way... serious but without condeming... funny, without being cynical... a balance of all that we keep hidden and hope will be forgotten, into plain view for all to see.

B0014BEDBG|5.0|no one talks about how much goes into putting on a successful performance on stage. we demand and expect so much from stars, that we forget to thank them for all their hard work, when they do meet our impossible criteria. showing footage behind the senes helpled show the human side of everyone on stage. you enjoy watching the show more because you go beyond the visuals and straight to the heart of the matter.

B005723JSQ|5.0|Read it in one day. Love Sophie 's style and characters. A unique story, stoked with lots of humor and basic relate-ability
B007GE2H3G|4.0|The Adventures of Tintin's characters are amazing!  The emotion that comes through the CGI is nothing short of groundbreaking.  The voice acting is all top notch and the attention to detail of the surrounding environment is extensive. The story, on the other hand, could have used a little work.  There are moments where the CGI is so lifelike that it is hard to suspend disbelief on some of the physics required to carry out the action.  Other than that, a great family movie; not for little kids though. This is definitely a movie that you want to pre-screen for kids up to about 10 years old.  Snowy rocks!
0307948560|2.0|Honestly, I'm a working mom who has fantacy about chucking my job, moving to the country and spending more time with my daughter.  But- I don't want to.  While I found moments relatable, I realized she is so trapped into her personal choice to be a working mom that she's going to get wrapped up in the business she's bought and neglect her third child, if she has one.
B009AP2G26|5.0|Highly recommend it to everyone! i love every episode can't wait for another season. i need six more words ok.
B003YTPS7O|5.0|This is my go-to when I want to watch a romantic comedy. Russel Crowe sheds his macho, hero image to show his sensitive side. Marion Cotillard is a breath of fresh air, beautiful, sexy, a perfect foil to Crowe's driven, self-centered, win at all cost, financier persona. The scenery is terrific, direction spot-on. I'll watch this anytime it's on.

B004H1V5RU|5.0|My six year-old son and his 5 yr-old brother received the twist and epic perplexuses about three weeks ago.  My six-year-old has solved them both!  We LOVE this product.  He and his little brother (just turned 5- 4 when he solved the others) received the rookie and original at Christmas from their uncle.  Both solved them and wanted another challenge.  I thank the developer of these wonderful mazes.  We love these A-MAZING products.  Please continue to make more!!
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|The people who say this sucks are mad because they can't make a game as awesome well I for one love love this game
B0055V6EZE|5.0|I bought this for a very dear friend that was having some difficult times in her life. She has enjoyed this so much.
B004H6G0TI|5.0|I love this game so much! It's so addicting that I can't put my kindle down. I finished every level except the last one and got half the planes in one day.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I have used Smith's sharpening for many years. This is one of the simplest and best sharpening systems available. If you really want to get a blade sharp it initally takes some time. The angle needs to be changed by just sharpening the knife. Afterwards all that needs to be done is maintenance. For the price you really can't go wrong. Only issue was that the sharpener didn't want to sit flat.
B002N44XSG|4.0|I think the books are great so this just adds on to there greatness. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes or loves the Percy Jackson series.
B00A9T1HUO|3.0|I was expecting more, this cd to me was not so good. I think Josh has a great voice, but needs better songs.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think it is the best game ever my son played it and he said this is the best game ever. I also think it is the best game ever too because I played it several times it is the best game ever that's my opinion.
B009QW7HMC|5.0|Wow!!!! What can be said about the walking dead?  The best show on tv ever!!!!!!  If their ever really is a zombie apocalypse I hope this show survives and I think it will. Woo-hooooo!!!!
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|This was a great movie! It is a little dark, so I wouldn't recommend it for children under 5. But, that is just my opinion.
B005K17RU0|2.0|This latest update was terrible. Please change it back to the old format. Plus it now crashes all the time.
B00AYB0TOW|2.0|I didn't like it. I wish that it had followed the original Judge Dredd. Of course, everyone has different tastes in movies.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|A very readable book that has you wishing for a silver lining for the main characters. The book centers on Pat Peoples as he tries to find his place back in the world after a mental breakdown. The story unfolds  as more and more details of Pat's life, before and during his stay in a &#34;neural health facility&#34;, come to light.  He strives to find the silver linings in his situation and you can't help rooting for him. I really enjoyed the book & read it twice.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|This was a cute movie! It's great to watch a movie the whole family can enjoy together! You should see it!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|wonderful that's all I can say, just try it and you will understand. clear version of the bible. you will understand and have a better relationship with God
B00B2DSK06|5.0|My kids loved this movie! The only complaint they had is that they felt it wasn't long enough. Worth watching!
B000JMKQX0|3.0|So now after having finished this book I can understand why so many people just couldn't get into it. Some of the stories are interesting but there is no cohesion of the stories. It just goes from one bit of information to another. It was interesting to see the procession of time from the outbreak until the end but felt lacking as there was no main character to bond with throughout  the story. It was just ok for me.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I thought the story started a little slow but picked up pace as you read on. The story kept your interest and was exciting. I would recommend this story to everyone! Very enjoyable.
0345803493|5.0|The second installment picks up with the same excitement the first book left off with. Their love story gets more and more interesting.
B00BYOEZTI|4.0|The drawn out Dwarf party in Bag End made me cringe at times.  The strongest points in the movies are drawing in the ancillary topcis, like Radagast, Witch of Angmar etc.  All action scenes are turned up to 11 which while visually impressive makes the tale an even taller tale than the original.  There were a few tease glimpses of Smaug that for what was shown weren't overly impressive but I should withhold judgement until the full beast can be seen on screen in the sequels.  Overall an enjoyable romp and worth seeing, but it didn't leave me with the same level of WOW as seeing each of the lord of the rings episodes.
0345803485|5.0|I neglected many of my responsibilities because I could not stop reading this book! The mystery that is Christian is an ongoing discovery.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I am aan editor for books and magazines, and this has always been my trusted and reliable source for word usage. I use it every day.
B00BN2CY7G|5.0|How can you go wrong with Bon Jovi! Saw this on TV and downloaded it right away. Highly recommend this.

B000J2BRQU|5.0|We enjoyed this movie. We are watching the whole series gearing up for the new one that is coming out
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I rely on this product almost daily in my work and for personal matters, too. This is a trusted and valuable tool.
B00AAQHP66|5.0|Saw this in the theater and loved it so that I purchased the DVD.Everyone that has seen it has loved it as much as I do.Filmed<br />on location in Santa Cruz,CA it provides some beautiful actual footage of the surf.It is the true story of the life of Jay Moriarity,a<br />local surfer.He wants to surf the big waves even as a young boy.He is mentored by his neighbor Frosty, a surfer,who teaches him<br />to surf the right way.There is a lot of backstory about both their lives and how they become very close.The scenery is so beautiful<br />and the story is so touching.It is a must see for all ages.
B002BU0DPE|2.0|After having two of these headsets I'm done with turtle beach. The sound quality is good, and I love being able to mix my game and voice volume however I want. I bought a second pair after the first one broke after 4 months of regular use and being well taken care of. I bought it again because I liked the sound quality and was hoping it was a fluke. I was wrong, after a little more than a month of use the new pair began cracking and the plastic just broke apart. I kept them going for another couple of months using glue and tape, but they finally just cut out. If I had gotten these for 20 bucks from wal-mart I could understand, but for a reputable brand and higher pricetag I expected more. Don't waste your money on turtle beach, or any of the mid-range gaming headsets for that matter, take time, save up, and get something that will last.
0374533571|5.0|This was a awesome book, very easy to read and follow. Funny and sad too. I cant wait to see the movie now!!!
1400069807|4.0|Salt Sugar Fat is a commendably captivating and detailed book that is a testament to its author's journalistic brilliance, but there are some glaring omissions I will discuss below along with disagreements on some of his fundamental conclusions.<br /><br />Let me get this straight: we cannot afford healthy, tasty convenience foods, yet we CAN afford cardiac bypass surgery, gastric bypass surgery, endless doctor visits and pricey prescription drugs for diabetes, hypertension, cancer, arthritis, and the many other diseases and conditions that often result from crummy diets. DOES. NOT. COMPUTE.<br /><br />I can't help but wonder if the food giants didn't pull the wool over the eyes of Michael Moss when they fed him versions of their products with less sugar, salt, or fat to illustrate their supposed need. He found them  noxiously unpalatable, calling them \\"metallic\\" and \\"bitter,\\" not just bland, so repulsive it caused him to gag (page 350). That's difficult to swallow because I've made countless healthy-but-yummy treats that weren't the slightest bit metallic, bitter, or devoid of flavor. Thus I wonder: did those food companies trick him using the method nutritionist Adelle Davis used to convince her kids that soft drinks taste terrible? She surreptitiously dumped out the factory soda and filled bottles with nasty-tasting ingredients. Did the food giants give Moss special versions not just lacking their usual levels of sugar, salt, and fat, but also with something yucky, too?<br /><br />I'm tempted to say no, thinking they couldn't possibly be that unethical, but they want us to believe they must use high levels of sugar, salt, and fat to make products that can compete with other junky foods. They must have realized that Moss was targeting sugar, salt, and fat, so they had an obvious motive to persuade him they need toxic amounts of those things to stay in business and make a profit, which is their #1 goal.<br /><br />Hmm, if the food giants were so ethical, consider this: Their executives typically shun their products, but they're good enough for you and your family? This is more than a class issue, as Moss suggests in the book; it is unconscionable and premeditated.<br /><br />Moss seems to too readily accept the fact that our craving for such junk legitimizes its sale. I agree to some extend on grounds of freedom, but an essential element of fairness is lacking: informed consent. Most people don't realize how they are decimating their health, appearance, and mood by consuming such products filled with ingredients not fully disclosed and often deliberately camouflaged by giving them deceptively innocuous or even healthy-sounding names.<br /><br />I've called manufacturers to specifically inquire about ingredients and found that even they don't always know what is in their products, and even if they did, they wouldn't reveal it, citing paranoid fears that I might be a potential competitor. Ridiculous. Any company rich enough to internationally manufacture and distribute food can afford to reverse engineer competitive products to duplicate or even surpass them.<br /><br />Years ago in one of my books (it is no longer available so I posted the relevant excerpt online), I detailed my conversation with Quaker Oats when I called to inquire if one of their flavored oatmeal products contained a spice that caused a life-threatening reaction in a patient. Their rep and her supervisor said they wouldn't tell me and couldn't tell me because even they didn't know every ingredient in their products!<br /><br />Their taste came from a secret concoction purchased from a food flavoring company -- that's one of the dirty little secrets of the food industry that Moss omitted: secretive food flavoring companies fill our bodies with unknown chemicals that likely haven't been tested and approved as safe by the FDA (as if their blessing is sufficient reassurance). Those chemicals help send our appetites into overdrive. I can make goodies loaded withsugar, salt, and fat and stop eating them, but some commercial products are so addictive that resistance is futile.<br /><br />Don't you have a right to know what you're putting in your body? And your children's bodies? The happy packaging of those products doesn't accurately represent the reality of what's often inside: quasi-food that can prematurely age you inside and out, sully your mood, and put you in the grave years or even decades too soon. And, of course, make it almost impossible to stop eating. Hence the mushrooming prevalence of obesity.<br /><br />Moss did not adequately dispute the conclusions of supposed experts who opine that junk food isn't addictive. We routinely ingest junk we'd never give our pets. When intelligent, informed, and concerned people (such as Dr. David Kessler, former FDA Commissioner) cannot resist food that damages their health, lives, and even our national economy, I'd call that an addiction.<br /><br />Moss painted a damning picture of the processed food industry, for which he deserves another Pulitzer Prize, but his indictment of our food would have been more complete by also targeting restaurant food that is frequently so brimming with salt, sugar, fat (including dangerously reheated oils) and chemicals galore that it makes most processed food seem downright healthy. The modus operandi of the restaurant industry is similar to that of processed food manufacturers: combining cheap and unhealthy ingredients to make stuff you can't resist. Collectively, their Big Lie is that viable alternatives are not available. Utter hogwash. Without any dressing, I can make a salad bursting with flavor and nutrition, with no added sugar, salt, fat, or chemicals. I've never seen anything like it in any restaurant.<br /><br />Restaurants and processed food companies are tinkering with our food but evidently care more about their profits than their customers because their soup of chemicals, along with loads of sugar, salt, and fat, are adversely affecting our bodies and minds. They get away with this because most people haven't connected their diet to how they feel, sleep, perform, and appear.<br /><br />I'm more attuned to this than many others, but it took me years to make the connection. Why? I was eating processed food every day, so I didn't see enough day-to-day variation to quickly realize how that stuff (little of which was obvious junk) was seriously disrupting my sleep and hence mood. Contrast my writings from that period (still posted online) to what I write today, and there's a world of difference, as if they came from different people -- and they did, because going without restful sleep for years on end is bound to negatively affect behavior. I later serendipitously discovered some natural, healthy ways to boost mood and creativity into the stratosphere, along with empathy. That's quite a change from my Mr. Scrooge years.<br /><br />Many folks are too tolerant, thinking of things as toxic only if they result in immediate and obvious harm or death. Processed food companies and restaurants have exploited this leniency to feed us junk that undoubtedly is toxic and even deadly. For example, the Center for Science in the Public Interest published \\"Salt: The Forgotten Killer ... and FDA's Failure to Protect the Public's Health\\" which said that \\"reducing sodium consumption by half would save an estimated 150,000 lives per year [and ...] reduce medical care and other costs by roughly $1.5 trillion over 20 years.\\" Think about it: sodium is killing as many people per week as terrorists did on 9-11. The United States spent more than it can afford fighting terrorism (see Time magazine's \\"The $5 Trillion War on Terror\\"), yet we look the other way when processed food companies and restaurants rack up a death toll that makes terrorists seem like amateurs?<br /><br />However, there is a glimmer of hope. As Moss repeatedly mentioned, some Big Food executives eventually realized that what they did was wrong and tried to make their products less harmful, but consumers voting with their taste buds and wallets generally vetoed those changes. So with folks virtually addicted to yummy food, the billion-dollar question is: Can it be tasty, healthy, and affordable?<br /><br />The answer is yes, but how to achieve that isn't immediately obvious to the processed food companies. They are obsessed with market share and profits but are overlooking the best way to achieve their objectives while doing the right thing for their customers.

B00BMVTS1S|3.0|I am a long time LOTR fan (over 40 years). The Hobbitt had too much of a Disney feel...especially Radagast and his &#34;Thumper&#34; sled. Maybe part II will improve the overall feel.<br />Additionally, my download from Amazon is inferior, with poor visual quality, poor streaming and sound quality. I WILL NOT BUY ANOTHER amazon movie.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The DVD was in fantastic working condition picture and audio<br />came through clearly. This was a Christmas present for my Dad<br />and now he is just a big a fan as the rest of us!!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Great graphics and easy enough for my young kids to play. They love playing it and I catch my husband playing it too. Great game!
B0031RS2HC|3.0|There is some early tentativeness about this first Jack Reacher novel, as Lee Child finds his feet. All the elements are there though, the novel plot twist, brutal action, sharp reasoning, and inexorable grinding down of adversaries.<br /><br />The love scenes are awkward and minimally treated, but this is not what Reacher fans look for anyway. A good read.
B00B22IJXK|5.0|Get this app now. $.99 is totally worth it. Dont listen to the bad reviews. This is an amazing app. It has amazing color and it is very easy to use. I love the change photo function on it. I will never get rid of this app. EVER!!!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I absolutely love this movie! I have watched it numerous times and I love it just as much as the first time.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is very cool i love it!! It is awesome because you get to go on a mission! You should download it NOW!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is the best game if u love horses I do I try is teaching u how to care for them
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was great reading material.  It kept you in suspense where you wanted to keep reading.  I really like his book.
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|It's an amazing game gorgeous environments smooth gameplay but it kicks me off of the game when I try multiplayer what's going on dang it
B000JMKNZQ|5.0|A quick, insightful and impactful read. The type of inspirational book I will return to again and again. Thank you Paulo.
B000L53D4O|4.0|I purchased this for my out-of-state grandson's first birthday. He began playing with the simple activity center immediately. Since he is still &#34;cruising&#34; and more comfortable traveling sideways around furniture rather than walking straight ahead, he wasn't ready to grab the handle and push it--yet. It came assembled and just collapsed and folded into a box for shipping so setting it up was simple. Many of the toys he has seem to flash and make noise. One of the reasons I chose this one is that it doesn't. It is simply child powered. It is lightweight and I imagine he will probably take a tumble or two before he masters it, but I trust that improving balance and a little more time will make it a toy he can play with for a long time.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I enjoyed the game. it has a good story to it. I beat it in just a few hours so I wish it was longer but not a bad game for 99¢.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Just easy to read. Not sure if I want to see the movie. Didn't like the killing of the children.
B009GED3HS|2.0|Unbelievable this is not the last season. Let it finish already. It's getting absurd how they are trying to extend the story lines. Most should have been wrapped up 3 seasons ago when the actors still cared about the show. The ones that have made a name for themselves seem to be on autopilot now.<br />Two stars only because it was interesting when you thought this was the end but after hearing about a new season I don't think it's even worth finishing.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I am having so much fun with Downton Abbey.  It is such great escapism.  I love all the characters and the performers are splendid.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|The only problem is they couldn't email me some popcorn!!!;)  The HD quality was good, although the action was not of 007 standards.
B005K17RU0|1.0|Why was the latest update released?  The new screen format is all but unusable.  The old format provided more information on a single screen.  Time to uninstall this software.
B00122PIMA|2.0|This CD has a lot of big Names playing on it and although I respect all the Players this just isn't my cup of tea when it comes to music.  It remind me of when Paul McCartney goes off on a big band tangent.  Yes good music, just not what I like.
B00BEZTMWW|4.0|Unlike most people who review this movie, I have not seen it in the theaters so I have no expectations.  First the good, the 48fps that some people complain about is amazing when mixed in with the 3d.  The movie is stunning, if you want to showcase your 3d tv use this film.  Now as for the movie itself it comes on two discs, the first builds the story and characters and is really a snoozefest.  The second is where the action is and that is where the 3d effects shine.  Overall it's a good movie, just starts very slow.  In typical Peter Jackson directing, he broke up the movie in to a trilogy and it shows.  The movie drags painfully, until finally showing it's potential in the second disc.  Overall it's a solid movie with an amazing picture.
B009NL38II|4.0|Yes, a good CD and really clean and clear cuts.  I especially like it when Jim goes off on his poetry and the rest of the band plays on then they hook up again and finish it.  I really like this Live album/CD.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|The movie was very well done-the acting and directing was very good,  The movie was intense and dramatic, and kept me engaged.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|This is a great entry level manipulative game for those of us who haven't grown up in a generation when being \\"all thumbs\\" was a GOOD thing!!  I find it very easy to get the hang of, and has a good \\"driving feel.\\"
B005K17RU0|5.0|The latest update is GREAT!  The look is so much better and the widgets are awesome.  If I have a problem, its when I try to animate the maps.  Sometimes it looses connectivity (and at the worst time).  But overall, it a great program.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is so much better than the other hungry sharks. It has kept me entertained for hours at a time. Definitely get it. I &lt;3 the fact that it's free!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun and interesting. I like this more than temple run and temple run 2!! Luv it!!!!
B004Z7AHZC|5.0|fast shipping, just as described.  My son loves this movie.  The only problem is that he watches it over and over and laughs just as hard each time!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love this game its so fun I want the great white shark but that will take soooo long right now I have the reef shark ;(
B00AKL1XPU|2.0|This was a fun game but I can't bring myself to play anymore when I can't move the roads or decorations after I placed them. When roads automatically appear around an animal enclosure and I can't move them, it tends to be irritating if the roads doubled up. Also, after reading other reviews, I'm cautious about getting far and then having the game reset on me.<br />Get if you like minimal customization, having to buy stuff to progress, and games resetting on you.
B0054U58AS|5.0|I`m starting to read again. Is incredible how Israel can deal with enemies around and still find place to reserch and development. The world should follow this attitude.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|What more can be said about this book?  The plot is so unusual you can't help but keep reading and buying the next book in the series!
0307352153|5.0|Quiet:  The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking by Susan Cain<br />I got this book free for agreeing to review it on my blog from Waterbrook Maltnomah Publishing's Blogging for Books.<br />There are introverts all around us and though I couldn't really ever fall into that category, they are in my family and I really want to make my organization (Friendship International-classes for international ladies in Austin) more introvert friendly.  So I picked this book up.<br />I felt the introduction was quite anti-extrovert so I was put off but I was glad I continued, as Cain, in the rest of the book, talks about the benefits and contributions of both, while saying those of introverts are not as valued or talked about as much in our culture.<br />There are great stories of inspirational introverts throughout and the history of how America got to the Extrovert Ideals is outlined.  Cain discusses nature versus nature including sensitivity which taught me a lot about my daughters.  Different cultures are examined. The book ends with how introverts can be their best in our society and how family members, bosses and teachers can help introverts to do the same.<br />This is a great pep talk for an introvert who needs one to be happy with themselves and find places/situations that work for them, as well as, knowing when to stretch.  There are great ideas to make places where introverts are required to be (families, schools, jobs) workable for all.  Great research, great stories, great pointers.  This is a book I am discussing with lots of people and I highly recommend it no matter where you fall on the E-I scale!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Loved this book...Extremely detailed and thoughtfully written.  Lots of interesting information that was informative as well as thought provoking!  Loved the character!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This is not a boring story about war but a story of humanity.  They were the Greatest Generation indeed. Must read.
B00BYOEMTQ|5.0|I love this movie minus this weird creature<br />That appealed my little sister but other wise I like it.<br />Now I really want to watch The Lord of the rings,,.!!!!!
6305910189|5.0|This movie is number 2 of 4 of the Khan story. The first is not Movie #1, it is episode 22 from season 1 (1967) titled Space Seed. The remainder are movies 3 (The Search for Spock) and 4 (The Voyage Home). While this is the best of the 4, you should have all 4 in your collection.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I love The Wizard of Oz. I've never played or heard of Temple Run until this game, but I just think it's amazing. The graphics are phenomenal, the touch works incredibly well, and it's very addicting. Anyone who has a big heart for The Wizard of Oz and/or Temple Run<br />will just adore this. Great for the whole family too. Played on Kindle Fire HD.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|the classics are a must to own<br /> well boxed, all pieces are surprising flat lays very nice<br />Awesome game and got started on the acquiring of expansions
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love this. It's great and totally free. I find myself pulling out my Kindle HD just to play this one. Loads of fun, and they even found a way to make it quite humorous. It's great for all ages, and you'll get hours of playtime. I can only imagine how well this app does around Shark Week!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's like the game. It's annoying that the adds interrupt the timed mini games. But other then that it's fun. It's nice that I can put it down for a while and wait for the power bar to recharge and there are other things to do while you wait if you want.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Another great love story by Nicholas Sparks. He just keeps writing great stories for the heart. Can't wait for the next one.
B005NPBT5M|5.0|I never tire of listening to this music. This was the Album to have back in 1979. Excellent music from one of my favorite bands.
B00028HBKM|5.0|This movie depicted the horrific battle that Jesus Christ suffered for all humanity.  This picture saying to all that I am giving my life because I LOVE YOU THIS MUCH.  THERE IS NO GREATER LOVE THAN THIS THAT A MAN/WOMAN LAY DOWN THEIR LIFE FOR A FRIEND.  Many didn't know the pain, suffering, humiliation, etc that he went thru to bring us back in true relationship with God the Sovereign Father of all creation.  Yet, the only way to the Father is thru Jesus Christ's death burial, and resurrection by faith.  Believing in your heart that Jesus died on the cross for all mankind sin, was buried, on the third day, God raised Jesus from the dead.  Believing in your heart confess with your mouth that God raised Jesus from the dead and you are saved.  I believe many that saw this movie gave their life got Jesus Christ.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I have all 3 seasons now and have been totally hooked since the first season.  Masterpiece on PBS is the best series. I will continue to watch as long as Julian Fellowes keeps writing.
B0024FAR5W|5.0|a very well written series and very enjoyable. the bray arrived quickly and in good shape. the series is still in production with new episodes coming next fall to look forward to.
1476733953|4.0|Sheriff Colston is climbing out to clean the lens. He will not return. He makes the trip knowing full well that outside he will encounter toxic gases that will kill him, in spite of his \\"protective suit.\\" Still, he goes, as others have gone before him, some willingly, some not. Howey wastes no time in immersing the reader in a bizarre fictional world. He doesn't dazzle us with weather reports, indeed, there is no weather to describe. The inhabitants live in an underground silo that extends over 100 levels below ground. The inhabitants are, through their own labor, provided with food, shelter, and instructions on their history (no deviations allowed). Early on there are hints of past uprisings in the silo, but let us desist from further plot revelations; why spoil the reader's fun?<br />And it is fun. Howey presents a thriller in every sense of the word, fast paced, heroes and heroines in inescapable situations, and lurking underneath the question of how this all came to be in the first place (hint, one silo dweller declares \\"We are all seeds.\\")<br />The scope of the narrative broadens in the end providing ample opportunities for sequels. I look forward to reading more.<br />Highly recommended.
1452101248|5.0|A huge fan of Ottolenghi's cooking, recipes and approach to the fresh ingredients, flavors, colours and tastes. The food almost pops out of the pages and or the TV screen. Every mouthful is delicious. We now have all three cook books which are used often and the so far all dishes have been a huge success with family and friends.
B0068THAGY|4.0|its was surprising and suspenseful with a cute little love story. great movie to watch with a group of friends and what not..
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is an addicting great game!  I have found no glitches. . . yet. I definitely recommend. great for any age.
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|Great game, the graphics are very crisp and clear even when you zoom in. The story line is good and the game progresses nicely. I have played this game numerous times and each is as enjoyable as the first. I would recommend this game.
B0089OBLDO|3.0|usb port does not fit securely otherwise I would rate it higher. Easy to use and does what was advertised
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I was reticent to watch this movie.  Remakes for classic movies and tv shows are often a dismal failure, but this is not the case.  A friend of mine let me borrow this movie and I liked it so much I immediately purchased it - watching it 3 times in the same week.  Get past your pre-conceived ideas and not wanting to tarnish the image we have of the original Star Trek crew but this movie keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B009KEN87O|5.0|It's a great mix of Space Invaders and Galaga, mixing in the vibration feedback just puts this app over the top.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|It was ok, I guess. Not as good as the others were. And not very much to read, but whatever.
B005P4PAVK|5.0|This show is so funny!!!  I just love watching this show. It truly makes me laugh out loud and having it available to me ‘on the cloud’ is great!  Whenever I need a good laugh, I can just pop this show on on any of my mobile devices.
B005OCHOZS|3.0|Interesting quick read.  Good insights into what an ultrarunner goes through.  Even made me want to eat a little better.

B003BV8I3Q|5.0|Denzel Washington gave a stellar performance in his role as Malcolm X.  He was superb in showing the transformation of a man from a thug to a man who cared about humanity.

B000USU9BC|5.0|An extremely emotionally riveting movie that kept you on the edge of you seat until the very end.  A very good translation of the book by Diehl.
B005SAJJHM|5.0|This show is so funny!!!  I just love watching this show. It truly makes me laugh out loud and having it available to me ‘on the cloud’ is great!  Whenever I need a good laugh, I can just pop this show on on any of my mobile devices.
B00005JKMQ|5.0|Will Smith was excellent in his portrayal of one of the greatest fighters of all time.  The movie did a wonderful job of showing the struggles and the racism that Muhammed Ali had to endure.  It also revealed his personal integrity as a black man in a racist society.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|CGI are believable- hence why I am was hooked from the first episode. Excellent script, kudos to the writers! not to mention the actors. Keep up the good work !!!
B00125WAWS|5.0|A great movie that shows the love and determination of a teacher to help his students realize their true capabilities.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|If you love bejeweled, you will like this twist on it.  The game is very addicting. It progressively gives you more challenging levels.
B00026ZG10|1.0|The movie itself is awesome, but this particular DVD is no better than a VHS tape.<br />Wait for the Blu-Ray.
B00B7IJBUY|4.0|If I weren't a fan of Bon Jovi I wouldn't be writing this. I have been listening to them, in working memory, since I was 2 or 3 years old (the late 80s are but a figment of my imagination now) and only in the past few years have I really begun to appreciate what their music really is. They started as the hard core, heavy rock and roll with some hint of metal in their music and as the years have progressed they mellowed out with an occasional \\"heavy rock\\" song every now and then. I see that this mellowing out has disappointed a fair number of people. I am not amongst them. I like this new album. Not every song is a favorite, but I have yet to listen to a Bon Jovi song (Jon by himself or with the band) that I utterly despise. I'd listen to any of them over and over again. Like The Circle, this album revolves around not giving up in a world that has had its share of atrocities and hardships. We need music like this to keep people's spirits up. Plus, I enjoy how they use phrases from their older songs and insert them in their newer songs. \\"Roll the dice\\" is one such example. It feels like they are connecting their origins with new material, fresh but still original.<br /><br />The heavy set rock that they began playing in the 80s seems to no longer be the desired stream of music. This change in music reminds me of the song \\"Last Man Standing\\" from Have a Nice Day. I would not be against a song with that \\"heaviness\\" but it seems that style is not a big scene with the general public. Add that to the fact that the band members are \\"Just getting Older.\\" Obviously they have to tailor to the vocal instrument if they want to keep singing so the heavier shouting (I never saw them as screamers like Linkin' Park) has to be mellowed out a bit. Personally, I think it shows that even though they originated as a heavy rock band, they can change the music genre from rock n' roll to arena rock to soft rock to country rock and back again but still maintain the essence that I know as BonJovi.<br /><br />I give it 4.5 stars out of 5 or a 9 out of 10, whichever suits your fancy.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|I AM ONE OF THE BIGGEST FANS OS LEGEND OF THE SEEKER, AND ONCE I FOUND THAT I COULD GET THE COMPLETE FIST AND SECOND SERSON, I WAS IN SEVENTH HEAVER, AS MY LATE MOTHER WOULD SAY, I HAVEN'T PURCHASED THE SECOND SEASON BECAUSE OF FINANCES BUT IT'S COMING, I LIKE THE FACT THAT GOOD FIGHTS AGAINST EVAL AND GOOD ALWAYS WINDS.
B007SGM084|5.0|These 3 books were awesome.  Not to mention that my husband actually enjoyed me reading these books.  I was only sad when I finished with them.  I can't wait for the movie.
1616614609|5.0|Only 2 player and kind of a steep learning curve. Once you get it and have someone good to play against though it really starts to shine!
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I owed a Otterbox Defender case before this case.  I switched due to the bulkness of the Otterbox.  I love my Life Proof case and will not go back to any other case.
B00BYOEMTQ|4.0|It was a good movie. I love the lord of the rings movies, it just did not stand up to them. hope in the next two it seems like they are getting some where.
B004GUSG4M|3.0|After downloading the sample I was excited about reading the rest of this story! Unfortunately, as I was reading I found I was pushing myself to the next page instead of putting the book down. It seemed as all I read about was that Christine woke up every morning not know who she was and little else. The book is a little over 500 pages and I feel would have been have as long it if weren't for the constant repetition. Also, it felt as if all engines went into overdrive to finish out the story once you were 90% done with the book. The ending seemed rushed and a bit over the top, it was not very believable. How is it that over the last 20 years she had achieved little progress in her recuperation, then all of a sudden a few weeks of writing everything down, something she had attempted before, started working magic on her. Overall, I could have better enjoyed my weekend than than to have read this book. =(
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Don't let the deliberate pace of the opening chapters deter you.  This is a great story of two human beings caught up in the gritty realities of war and how they handled the stress of combat.  The middle chapters dealing with the confrontation of these two pilots is compelling reading.  And concluding chapters on their lives is moving.  More than a book on war, this a morality tale that anyone should read.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Loved it<br /><br />If you're a fan of \\"hero's journey\\" and swordsman type books you're going to be hard pressed to find better
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We are thoroughly enjoying the PBS Downton Abbey series.<br />The historical aspect as well as the definite class distinction gives this<br />series a AAA rating.<br />We are becoming saddening it will come to an end after Season 3 & hope<br />Season 4 will begin in no time.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a very fun and challenging game.  You will enjoy the increasingly difficult levels and feel good as you are able to conquer them.
B00AJLHULW|2.0|I am a huge Robben Ford Fan - This CD was a dissappointment.  I realize everyone has different tastes but I can play anything by him and it makes me happy.  this CD unfortunately did not.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|American Horror Story is a must see tv show if you like scary shows. The story takes many twists and turns and you just never know where it's going to go.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Fun to play but can be hard in some of the country's.  there are lots of items in each country to complete before going on to the next place.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I enjoyed the surprise ending of the book, but am not a fan of stories that jump from the present to the future and back. The story had a lot of moral questions and gives you a lot to think about. What would you do if it were your child in trouble? Food for thought.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|This was a great season.  I would say the best so far.  I wasn't crazy about the first few episodes in the first season, but once I started to get into it, it was well worth my time.  However, I can honestly say that this season has alot of surprises and was well worth my time.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Safe Haven kept my interest to the point I will try another of Nicholas Sparks' books.  The movie is out so I am interested in seeing how the producer and director image the characters.
B00AGKHALQ|5.0|I already had Lichtspielhaus, the previous Rammstein music video collection, but it ended at the Mutter era. It also lacked &#34;Making Of&#34; documentaries for most of the videos. This set has all of their current videos, and a documentary for each one. Unlike Lichtspielhaus, it contains no other features, just the music videos and documentaries, no live performances or promos spots.<br /><br />Also, don't be alarmed if one of the DVDs fell out of the holder during shipping, it shouldn't be scratched, if it is, return it and hope for the best.
B0058YPL66|5.0|I just started watching this show last week. I didn't catch it on TV, because I had just had a baby and wasn't able to focus on a lot at once (due to no sleep, other parents I'm sure you can relate!!!). I decided to watch it, because I keep hearing so much positive feedback from it. I am at a loss for words...but WHY DID I WAIT SO LONG TO WATCH THIS SHOW?!<br /><br />I must admit, I'm a fan girl when it comes to fairy tales, Princesses ( I was going to be one..of course...lol)and far away lands. This show has all of that and SO. MUCH. MORE. Seriously, you think that you know your fairy tales, well, you're wrong. Not only does this show bring in all your favorites, but gives you back stories on how everything came to be. Why would the Queen hate Snow White so much that she throws all of the fairy tale characters to our world and to have everything they loved ripped away from them? Will they ever be able to go home or get stop the curse?<br /><br />This is one of the best TV shows that I've seen in a long time. I would recommend it, if you haven't watched it yet. Besides, what are you waiting for?
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoyed the third book as much as the other two but was left wanting more. It had a good story line and moved from the second book right to the third without skipping a beat.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Excellent reading, could not put it down!!! I would highly recommend this for a by the fire book during a winter snow storm!!
B0044DEAUA|4.0|Excellent price. Great value. Audio quality is fair and could use improvement. Charge lasts a good long time and the car adapter is very helpful on long trips.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|Sanderson creates incredible worlds, types of magic that are totally unique and his story is on a scale greater in scope than most epic fantasies, this story (quasi-spoiler) spans the very creation of the universe and the evolution of it's creators.  Its not a religious book and I am not a overly religious person, certainly not mormon, but you can see where his mormon faith influenced his world building and the overall story of this trilogy.  Incredible work, its a perspective on the classic fantasy realm that you won't get from other writers.<br /><br />If you read fantasy you HAVE to read this series, it really is a must.
1885167776|5.0|I pre-ordered months ago and got my copy from Amazon last Wednesday. I feel a little silly saying this, but I was literally tingling as I finished the last sentence of this powerful book. As a pragmatist, and someone who values efficiency so much so that I appear to have a great deal of discipline, this book was like water to man dying of thirst. I don't want to go too deep into the topics of the book, because you really need to read them in context (as soon as possible) but the LIES section opened my eyes and set me free from some of the long-held-onto notions that sometimes made me feel guilty about having to shut the door and focus on one thing because I am so easily distracted. Turns out my defense mechanism was correct - backed up by the vast amount of research Gary Keller, Jay Papasan and their team dug into to write this book. The emphasis on Extraordinary Results (Live with Purpose; Live by Priority; Live for Productivity)was so powerful yet concise, it is still rocking my world as I process through the concepts... Talk about efficiency and being pragmatic... this book nails it.<br />I read a lot of business books and leadership books - this book transcends the categories... If you are interested in growing your business, growing your leadership skills, or just growing yourself to achieve more and more powerful results, this book is a must. It's 3 PM for me as I write this and I have gotten more done today then most people do in a very full day - thanks to the ideas in this truth-telling, passionate book on focus. Everyone you know needs to read this too. I bought e-books for both of my daughters. I just gifted it to them so next time they open their kindle, it will be there. They don't know it yet but this is probably the most valuable gift I could give them. Oh - I just thought of someone else I am going to send the book to. Gotta go!
B000UZQI0Q|5.0|If you read fantasy you have to read this.  Sanderson brings a very unique and totally original perspective on the epic fantasy story, the protagonist and the world of magic that other authors simply don't do.  Most authors use the same rote ideas on magic and how it works, not sanderson.<br /><br />This story is incredible, I am reviewing the whole series more than this book because you cannot just read this book, you have to read them all but its well worth it.  I plowed through these in about 2 weeks without hesitation.  Its incredible.<br /><br />You must read this book.
B006CDCWDM|4.0|The reason for picking up this book is to know little bit more about a person who fights for each and every game point, set point as if it's his last match, how he came back from a carrier threatening injury and won 10 grand slams after that..<br /><br />It starts of with a brilliant description of wimbledon 2008 final which is regarded as one of the greatest matches till date and taking that as a backdrop the author narrates the events that took place in nadal's life.. how he chooses tennis over football..how he was trained by his uncle and the support shown by his family..<br /><br />Overall I like the author's narration.The book is not complete yet... I still feel, the way he came back winning IndianWells-2013 title after pulling out from two GS last year is one of the important aspects in his life which will be missed out in this book<br /><br />This book is for all the tennis fans who are interested in knowing the backstage preparations for a major game.. how tennis is more of a mind game when it comes to a match between two equals
B002LC8HF0|5.0|One of the very best fantasy series out there by the best fantasy author out there.<br /><br />I also recommend &#34;The way of kings&#34; which is hands down the best fantasy book I have ever read, but that series isn't complete so read this whole series first so that your mind is not totally blown by &#34;kings&#34;.<br /><br />No one creates as original and unique a world as Sanderson.  Gorgeous writing style, lots of action, incredibly engaging story and characters complete with twists that you will never anticipate.<br /><br />Must read.  Truly must.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I liked the book a lot and it was very interesting. This is one of the first book I read on my new kindle
B0091REZMW|5.0|this game is addicting.  Energy is exhausted very quickly but you don't need to spend your money to buy more.  just be patient and continue once energy is restored. Gaining friends helps increase energy and coins. I cannot stay away from this game.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I bought to begin with. I wish I had bought it to begin with instead of trying to save money
B009E3EY4M|3.0|I have not bought it because of the reviews I read here. I rented it instead. Image quality is superb, as is the sound.<br /><br />I totally agree with the other reviewers about the edition, wich could certainly be much much better. Too many cuts and close-ups. You want to see the band perform, but you can't see much of it: they shoot to Page, but before you can see him play a chord the camera cuts to Plant, but before he opens his mouth to sing, camera cuts somwhere else. And so on.<br /><br />What's even more confusing it's that in between the high-res shots there are cuts to shots from a low-resolution camera, I think a handheld one, shot from the audience. Maybe the editor thought this would help the viewer to feel the mood from the audience. I'd say it fails to do that. Why? Why would I want to see a handheld low-resolution shot, when they had like 25 Full HD cameras on stage?<br /><br />Same happens to the shots to the stage screens. Why? I want to see the band playing, not the screens.<br /><br />Band is great. Sound is great. Image quality is great too - except for the giant screen and handheld shots. Edition sucks.<br /><br />Personally, the constant cuts end up being distracting and I felt terribly frustrated because I wanted to enjoy the band perform and it felt like someone had set against this. They could've gone with the solution used in the Bluray of Iron Maiden playing live in Chile: split screens. It's not the best, some would say, but it's better than the choice finally made by the editor.<br /><br />Three stars for that, and final advice: don't waste money buying a BR you're probably not going to enjoy. Go for the CDs instead.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love, love, love this show!!!  I'm very happy that I bought the series because I can watch them again and again.
B00BHMF578|5.0|My wife and I really enjoyed this movie. Action-packed and tense throughout.<br /><br />Also, it was first experience using Amazon Video and Roku. Highly recommended
B0045HCJ9E|5.0|No doubt about it - this flick is one classic that everyone who loves a good thriller, one without a lot of blood and gore - Hey! Hitchcok didn't need that stuff! Even in Psycho in that  famous shower scene - he never shows the knife actually cutting - what director these days can say that?<br /><br />But this one - this one is mucho Hitch - with an innocent guy suddenly being pursued by - well you will have to see this for yourself - as I said - it is one classic that the less you know, the more you'll enjoy it.
B009KEN87O|5.0|This game is a masterpiece in simplicity... a must buy for all gamers of all categories!!! It's wonderful on multiple levels...
0062014536|5.0|I'm taking my time with this one because I will be sad when it's over. Lauren Oliver is such a great writer. Most YA is poorly written in my opinion but she is so creatively descriptive. Plus, who doesn't love a dystopian present?!
B0067AC5KA|5.0|Finally ordered this trilogy after many recs and my only regret was waiting so long to take a vacation to get a chance to read it!!
0385349947|5.0|As a 22 year old female in medical school, I've long been a reader of feminist works--\\"The Feminine Mystique\\", \\"The Feminine Mistake\\", even the more-blunt \\"Get to Work\\"--but \\"Lean In\\", Sheryl Sandberg's honest account of her experiences climbing up the corporate ladder, really struck me.<br /><br />This book is phenomenal.  It's not about women just getting a job, it's about women getting the job.  Not just a paycheck, but an equal paycheck to what a man in her position would be earning. This book feels current, real, and strikingly honest. As I was reading it, I couldn't help but completely feel like Sheryl Sandberg completely gets me (and, I am sure, many other women in many different industries).<br /><br />A few things that she mentioned really resonated with me.  In the chapter, \\"Sit at the Table\\", she recalls women at a conference entering the conference room and sitting at the chairs in the sidelines, instead of sitting at the table with all the other executives.  Not because anyone told them they didn't deserve to be there, but because some internal feeling was holding them back.  I totally had an \\"aha moment\\" reading this, as I remembered one month when I was on Internal Medicine and the physicians would hold \\"grand rounds\\", where everyone sits at a big round table and discusses cases.  The physicians and then the residents would sit down.  Then the male medical students would confidently grab seats at the table, usually near the head of the table, but I would usually sit at one of the extra chairs in the corner if there wasn't enough space at the table.  It took one of the residents to gesture me to sit at the table, for me to pull up one of the extra chairs and make room for myself at the table.<br /><br />In another chapter, she talks about how females are conditioned in childhood to raise their hands instead of speaking up, and not be too eager to answer questions so as not to seem like a know-it-all.  I noticed that all throughout college and medical school, the male students would always call out the answers to questions, even if they didn't know the answer and it was incorrect, whereas the female students would often be reluctant to speak up--even if they knew the correct answer. It really surprised me to think that something so seemingly trivial that we learn in childhood sticks with us even way into adulthood.<br /><br />Sandberg seems at times more of a social scientist than COO of one of the most powerful companies in the world, but her years of keen observation is what makes this book really hit the nail on the head.  I don't want to give too much more away, but I think this book will be on the best-seller list for a long time.  It is a must-read for anyone, but especially important for women starting their careers.chool, the male students would always call out the answers to questions, even if they didn't know the answer and it was incorrect, whereas the female students would often be reluctant to speak up--even if they knew the correct answer.

B000FC1HBY|5.0|A great continuation of the series. I highly recommend this to anyone into the fantasy sword and sorcery genre. If you are watching the show and not reading the books you are doing yourself a disservice because, while the show is closely following the events of the books, the book helps explain some things that are left slightly ambiguous.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Got this remote for nearly half the price than retail stores. It works great, a little bit of dirt on it when i received it but i dont mind cleaning it off, as long as it works
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game it so cool on creative you can do what ever you want on survivle you cant do any thing you want.<br />  :)<br />  :)THANK YOU FOR READING(:
B007N5YIUS|4.0|This is a very enjoyable game. Some are hard but I still like it. Even my husband will play and try his best to score three stars.
B00BGIBVP8|3.0|If you are already invested in these characters or you want an open and honest look at marriage that doesn't have neat and tidy endings or clear lines then this is your movie. Don't expect Knocked Up, the movie that introduced this world and these characters. This tends to just delve into the same issues the couple had before, they do love each other but they are slightly mismatched and disenchanted with their lives which they both seem to blame the other for before realizing they are in this together. There are some really funny moments but they are spaced throughout the film and it just kinda goes on and on. This couple worked as a great B story line in the first movie serving for a cautionary tale for the main characters, now you tend to miss the main characters from the first film and wonder why they are not in the second film even as a minor part.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't put this book down, as could I not with the first book. Can't wait to read the final book to see how it all ends.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This is one of those &#34;aha!&#34; Books that comes around every now and then that you will never forget, and which will likely cause you to make some major changes in your life.  The book is well written, well researched, and well presented. I am going to make it a must read for all of my diabetic patients as well as anyone over a body mass index of 27.<br /><br />I have even bought a few of these books for patients of mine that could not afford it, because I believe that it will make more of an impact than hours of counseling, medications and a whole plethora of visits to nutritionists.  It is a same that Nutritionists are largely unaware of the facts in is book.  Hopefully the world of the nutritionists will become more sophisticated and will get with the times.<br /><br />All in all, this book is a 10/10 and should be on the required reading list for Highschool students instead of Macbeth.....
B007C7UZIG|4.0|works very nice... no problems. very stable and steam is updated pretty frequently so thats nice.<br /><br />thumbs up on this app.
B0001CNRB6|4.0|I saw this movie when it came out and have thought about it over the years. While I was writing a chapter in a 'how-to' book I'm writing I decided to buy it to test my menory about what it contained. I enjoyed it as much this time as when I first saw it.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|if is a little bit better then the first. there is cooler things in the game.hard to see where you are going and when to turn.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Fun and challenging game of strategy. Lots of levels to go through and I like the music, it's very relaxing.
0062082353|5.0|An example of what is required to be true warrior.  Probably completely opposite of the temperament of most of Amazons customers, (who just wouldn't understand).
B004LROUNG|3.0|I was rather bored with the book.  It seemed to lack much action and that's what I enjoy.  I usually look forward to John Grisham books!
B0083D9MXM|5.0|Man what a box set outstanding recording, all disk were never played  this is Audiophile  recordings very good sound Plus Awesome Service Thanks,
B005LAIGYQ|4.0|Good movie.  Seems real not hollywootized.  The end seems real and not anything like a movie protrayel.  I reccommend these movie to action lovers, documatary lovers, and all who live free by the sacrifices these type men make.  Thank you all military personnel for serving. God Bless.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|This is an awesome interpretation of the musical.  They do a wonderful job combining the music with real emotion and acting.  It's not as crips or \\"professionally\\" voiced as the live stage show, but it brings real depth to the characters and offers some details and nuances you just can't get on stage.  Definitely worth having in the colection if your're a fan of the story Les Miserables.
B002N7CTKM|1.0|These show could have been something funny with good writting.  Its seems more like documentary than comedy.  The characters are a little to real, perfect for a documentary.
B00AEFY552|5.0|This is the good remastered version. It has all the items listed in other reviews that indicate it is the new remaster.<br />Some indicators:<br />It seems the only definitive way to tell if you have the new version is to look at the innermost rings on the underside of Disc One itself. Hold it up to the light, and at the end of a string of letters and numbers, you should see &#34;B1R2.<br />This version has that code.<br /> In addition a review I read somewhere said you can tell by the title screen at the beginning. I can't find that review now, but I did a comparison at the time and this &#34;Gladiator [Blu-ray] (2013)&#34; had the title as described.<br />Looks very good.
B005JR3Y5W|3.0|3 guys living with girl whom they treat like their little sister even though she is full grown woman and educator of children.  They act a gang of teenagers
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was impossible to put down. The story itself is just simply a master piece. Sparks is an amazing author with the ability to hold you by the seat of your pants while still having a year in your eye. I would recommend this to anyone. Loved it.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|This show is very well written.  It can go 14 seasons with cast members getting married and having children.  Sheldon's putdowns towards Leonerd could carryon to his child putting down Lenord's son.  An idea.<br /><br />The show brings a cast of intelligent educated adults with graduate degrees and a farm girl college community dropout, Penny, trying to make it in California as an actress stuck in the middle.  The ongoing differences between Sheldon an intellectual physicist by definition and Penny make the show what it is.  Putting an analitcal, intellegent, &#34;evolved&#34; (as he calls himself, person whom doest not crave human innate desires such as human contact and without a doubt intimacy, in the same room with a free spirit aspiring actress true to her innate desires, is the recipe for humor.<br /><br />Amy Farafauller (Bialik), an intellegent neuerolgist, whom essentially is Sheldon's female equivalent,  high school's desires of befriending the pretty girl in school comes to a reality when meeting Penny.  Dialoges between her and Penny also make for good humor.<br /><br />The friendship between adults (Sheldon, Amy and Penny), whom where complete opposite of another in high school respectively, creates an amusing, humerus dynamic.<br /><br />The only thing bad thing about season six is Wolowitz leaving behind his bacholors days and hanging with Kutropoli, which brought the show's humer down a notch.  Wolowitz is personality as bachelor made humerus contributions to the show no longer seen now as a husband.  on the upside Kutropoli now speaks without the use of Wolowitz, since they no loger are hang out arm to arm.  Its good to see him speak out.<br /><br />Chuck Lore is a genius bringing us unconvetional shows like the Big Bang and Two and Half Man.
B004AW64CM|5.0|I love this movie very much, and I had really wanted to watch it again, so I got it on Amazon. Great quality.
B0063GORYU|4.0|It's a fun game to play. It is challenging and fun and I like to keep at it to see how well I can do.
B0097PW7H8|5.0|I love this app. I was always worried that I was overcharging or charging my Kindle Fire too frequently. Upon the first use of this app I immediately was grateful that now I won't have to calculate and remember to unplug the Kindle, the time is in the notifications header and there is also a screensaver you can use  which I did more often than not. The tips on maintaining the health of you battery is also great, like turning off the Wi-Fi when you are not using.<br /><br />Wonderful app, I have suggested it to my boyfriend and he is also very impressed.<br /><br />Definitely worth getting.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I first read the &#34;competition's&#34; book, and then this one. I have to say I am thou roughly impressed with both, probably more so this one tho. Great advice and food for thought. If nothing else, it will give you a lot to think about before attempting to self-publish. Definitely recommend it!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Fun game for free. Would be nice to link it and play via Pc, but I've been a JP Fanboy since the first movie so any chance to play a JP game I take it.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Little slow at first but not too bad once you get going. The only thing I don't like is trying to play the  Code Red part. I can't see all the carnivores on my screen at the same time to play without losing.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love this game so much. I'm addicted! I play it every day and get my daily coins. My favorite shark is the hammerhead. I especially like eating gemfish and blob fish. tip: to get more of the high point fish go through the underwater caves
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Fruit Ninja is completely Awsome because it's fun & can be educational at the same time.  It's educational, because it teaches you how to pay attention to detail.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I am so addicted to hidden object adventure games.  This one does not disappoint.  Good graphics and story line. Keep them coming.
B00BYOEMTQ|3.0|First, let me say that unlike some people, I did not have particularly high expectations for this movie, so this isn't simply a case of having unreasonably high expectations. The reason I only gave it 3 stars is that they seemed to add material simply for the sake of adding material. It doesn't really add anything to the story, in fact it often distracts from the main plot. The CGI is very well done, the actors are well chosen, and the script is well written. They just didn't need to make the Hobbit into 3, 2.7 hr long movies.
0785162348|4.0|The Art Of The Avengers is a beautifully designed coffee table companion book that compliments the 2012 Avengers movie. There are carefully presented photos taken during production and depicting the individual actors and actresses, i.e. Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man; Chris Evans as Captain America; Mark Ruffalo as The Hulk; Scarlett Johanssen as Black Widow; Liam Hemsworth as Thor,Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye, et al. The commentary is thoughtfully written and the entire volume is in a protective slipcover. Certainly, for those aficianados of the film and devotees of the Marvel series on which the film is based, this book provides a handsome companion piece and it is priced reasonably and appropriately in light of the excellent contents. Of particular interest are the designs and photos of the Iron Man armor and the costumes of the various members of the team. A great deal of care was taken by Joss Whedon, the film's director, in the preparation of the various components of the film, and that dedication translated into the commercial and the critical success of The avengers. I strongly recommend the book and I believe that fans of the film will enjoy and appreciate it.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|My daughter and her Girl Scout group all received a copy of Annie for Christmas and we are absolutely loving it!  It's so nice to see how timeless the story is for all ages.  Those songs will be relevant forever...
B005C9YZIM|5.0|Best all around viewing to understand the incredible views about earths's nature. The comprehensiveness will thrill every age group. No doubt!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|There were many applications that I found most useful when I tried ES File Explorer. This is very efficient for me....
B003JTHXOK|2.0|The story line was almost identical to the movie &#34;Sleeping with the Enemy&#34; with Juila Roberts.  Made it tough to read since you knew what was coming.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is a great novel and love story. If you loved the movie, you are sure to enjoy the book even more  thoroughly.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|i liked it  but it has been upgraded and i can no longer get it on my tablet i have tried to get it but it will not let me download it again because it says i already own it what can be done about that
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book will definitely fall in with my favorite books. It is full of adventure and courage. This heartwarming story will always have a special place in my memory and heart. I love the life of pi
B00A757EFW|3.0|hard to control the  pac man on my tablet. need something more to move them around on the tablet. it is too hard to control
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love the 'tragedies' in this book. And the love between Katniss and Peeta made me fall in love with this book.!!!!!! (:
B0050LJIRK|3.0|It's not his best record, but as I fan I like it. You need to love the band to buy it.
B00BESLHEA|1.0|SPOILERS...  Well, the movie starts off rotten, so not much to spoil.<br /><br />There was a point during the movie where I paused it to go the bathroom.  When I returned I simply could not bring myself to continue sitting through this excrement.  I'd gotten all the way through the part where the man with the iron fists becomes the man with the iron fists.<br /><br />This movie is an insult to Kung Fu films, and to audiences everywhere.  It was made as the personal fantasy of Rza.  Russell Crow appears in it because he and Rza are buddies, from what I understand.<br /><br />The dialog is awkward and flat.  The actions of the characters make little sense as they never come from any clear motives.  None of the characters reactions were natural for human beings.  Even the main character was a ridiculous contradiction.  Rather than achieving the \\"flawed hero\\" with the blacksmith character, you end up watching the confused idiot: I was a slave on a slave ship, but the ship wrecked and I was discovered by Shaolin monks (what?).  They made me sweep their monastery until I decided I wanted to learn Kung Fu (what?).  When I was ready, I went out to a small Chinese town to become a blacksmith and sell extremely well-made weapons to any who would pay for them (what?)  Then I fell for the hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold (right) and decided later she was the reason I was making all those weapons (right).<br /><br />The action is bad, jumpy, overly brutal, and apparently no matter how you cut a person, they're filled with cranberry preserves.<br /><br />Lucy Liu was always smiling inappropriately, in every scene, and I know she has better instincts than that.  One can only assume she was directed to show that \\"Oh, you\\" grin when the bad guys were, between belches, boasting of how they were going to kill and torture people.<br /><br />Surprisingly, even the music was awful and jarring during the fight scenes.  The assault on the ears and the sensibilities of anyone who likes Kung Fu films forced me to mute the movie after the first two or three fights.  This from the same guy who did such a fantastic job with the musical queues and clips for Kill Bill.<br /><br />This wasn't even ironically or campy-bad.  It was just bad.  The Man With the Iron Fists is what you get when someone who shouldn't be allowed to make a movie gets to make a movie.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham always delivers! This was a great suspense novel. I was on the edge of my seat waiting to find out how all of the pieces connected. If you like suspense and legal maneuvering, then you will love this book.
B00A3VLJCE|2.0|At first, I was completely blown away by this app, it was just what I was looking for. Then I tried to open something. Big mistake. Unless you use Adobe's own cloud storage, you will not have access to your images. It turned a great app into a passing curiosity and a wasted opportunity.
B0074VA2T2|5.0|My son plays this everyday. It seems to keep him calm and you hear him counting with the game. If your child loves the book, this will be a hit.
B002VHI8J0|5.0|Enjoyed every word, dot, coma and dash. It's one of those books you will always remember reading and will want to read again. Written with great humour and pathos, the stories linked seamlessly. I would recommend Cloud Atlas very highly.
B001BR5NN0|4.0|This is a good movie about people, and how, while we are all different, we are all the same.  I thought it was boring when I was younger and it first came out.  Now, I get it.  Even more interesting from the perspective of being a parent.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Loved every bit of it. Well written. Funny. Exciting. Unput downable. A must read. I just loved Pi as a character. Highly recommended.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This was a fun movie.  More sexual innuendos than I would prefer, but not terrible.  I loved the music.  I recommend.
B008NCSZQ8|1.0|It seemed that this movie was streaming via dial up, because it kept going to a &#34;Loading&#34; screen.  Who wants that in any movie?!  Dont know if I will order any more digital downloaded movies from here again.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I enjoyed the suspense and characters. Did not guess the end plot, there was a hint but that was not in the way of the flow of the story. This book kept me engrossed and had me emphasizing with the main character as well as the girl. Did not find any mistakes in the story line, I knew he had something up his sleeve for the climax though still enjoyable. This one got me interested in his books again.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I like all the different choices for the sound to<br />wake up to! I have seven more word so yeah.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|and this is better than season 1 (in my humble opinion). Nealty packaged with blu ray, dvd and a digital download code. Well worth the money paid, great show and great season.
B009NPM5Y2|3.0|My wife and adult daughter both agree, it was good entertainment.  We're glad we didn't spend the big $$ to see it on the big screen, but it was well worth the rental fee.... at least once.  :-)
B004GJ1XU2|5.0|It's a great film, especially if you're in your late 20s to late 30s I think.  Somehow really captures what those weekends are like.
B004CEUEWE|4.0|We (adults) all enjoyed this one.  Good drama... good action.  Even a very plausible movie!  I will probably rent this again to see what I missed the first time around.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Clancy's books are always great.  I wish he could write one every week.  Seven morfe words are required.  Two more.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Absolutely love this book. Heck, this series! I have read it multiple times and I think that it will always give me goosebumps! ;)
1594202842|1.0|I was interested when I read that her daughter was so good that she won a competition - international no less - and subsequently had her \\"Carnegie Hall debut\\". In the English version, she concedes it was actually Weill Hall. In the Chinese version, she doesn't bother to mention it is the small hall.<br /><br />In addition, the competition - Bradshaw & Buono International Piano Competition - which is competition created by a music store, has multiple first place winners - there were at least 50 winners in some categories. You submit a recording - no one hears you in person. You send in a CD with your $150. Everyone wins or gets \\"second prize\\". Your prize? You get to say you had a Carnegie hall debut. No money. Not even your money back - that's how they pay for the hall.<br /><br />Essentially, there was no \\"Carnegie Hall Debut\\". It was a student recital where kids paid $150 to rent the hall.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|My son suggested this site and I like it very much. It is pretty complete and comprehensive, and I will rely on it.
B00969GFFU|5.0|Franzen's talent is writ large in this great novel. Structurally, it calls to mind works of the last century--expect solid, good storytelling. My wife was particularly impressed with his subtle portrayal of women (I'll take her word for it!). I was impressed with his portrait of parent-child relationships.
1580084621|5.0|I've spent a fair amount of time in Thailand, and eating is one of the great delights there.  David Thompson's book offers a wealth of information on how to prepare everything I've run across and then some.  A lot of books I've looked at have omitted ingredients that are difficult to find in the U.S., but without them, the food is missing the essence of what one gets in a true Thai meal.  Thompson provides what I believe are the recipes one might actually enjoy without toning down the flavors or limiting the ingredients to the mundane.<br /><br />The one criticism I have for the book is it's hard to find recipes sometimes as he only provides an English translation of the names in most cases.  For instance, if you look for something that sounds like \\"pla sam lot\\", you won't find it.  You have to look under \\"fish\\" and find \\"in three flavored sauce\\".  Pla sam lot I believe, translates to \\"fish in five flavored sauce\\", but what I made with his recipe was wonderful none the less, and similar to what I have eaten in Thailand.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who has a serious interest in Thai cooking and eating, who is not interested in a lot of pretty pictures, and who won't be overwhelmed by the size of the volume.  If you're just getting started or don't know what to expect a dish to look like without a picture, it might be a bit daunting.
B002QW7AJY|5.0|The ending was completely unexpected, as was most of the story!<br /><br />Alien meets 2001: A Space Odyssey sprinkled with a little old Star Trek, Night of the Living Dead and Momento!<br /><br />Grippingly claustrophobic!<br /><br />OMG! THERE'S Norman Reedus!
1455519006|5.0|\\"The Innocent\\" by David Baldacci will delight the reader in this fast paced novel.  The well created lead character, Will Robie is the good assassin that is employed by an unknown federal agency.  The exciting action will keep you glued to the book.  Julie Getty, a 14 year old, is another interesting character, her keen survival skills becomes an interesting part of the story.<br /><br />A great plot, well written.
B009KEN87O|5.0|This is a blast from the past, I remember the good o'le days. Really fun. The controls and the wepons are awesome.
B0084670FU|4.0|In the early parts of this movie it was unclear how it would all tie together.  However, each part of the movie was interesting enough to keep watching and as all the parts tied together it made for a good movie overall.  I thought the acting was good overall, but nothing outstanding.
B001676320|5.0|Chicago and Earth, Wind and Fire are two of my all time favorite Bands. This Blu-Ray of them performing together live at the Greek Theatre is visually a treat and has one of the best surround sound audio tracks I have ever heard on a music video. This DVD is a joy on every level!
B0007MWZEK|4.0|Love it for fast clean ups.  Love it for picking up those pesty Asian Beetles and Boxelder bugs that find their way into your home and porches in the fall.  Does better than a broom and dustpan.  :)
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Without a doubt one of the best books I've ever read, and I've read a bunch. Marcus, Mike, Danny, and Axe have all become my heroes. Their courage and will to keep fighting have become the stuff of legend. If I ever have a tough day, I think about this book and what they went through and then just tell myself to quit belly aching and get on with it. A must read for any patriot. We owe these men and all our vets a huge debt of gratitude.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|I just got the Kindle Fire HD and had this app on my phone. I was disappointed when it wouldn't work and kept force closing. I looked again at the permissions and realized I needed to change some settings. Since this game still wants to connect to Feint you have to turn on 'Allow Installations From Unknown Sources' under the Device setting. It also wants location services on; so you will have to turn that on as well. Once I did both of these, the game worked perfectly. Hope this helps others get the game going on their Kindle Fire. I turn these settings back off after I finish playing.
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|This is a true history movie and the actors and the director are great, and for seen it in black and white makes you fell much real but nothing like they suffer in real life those people

B008D19WBQ|5.0|What can I say about this six people....the are great and funny and I love them, I grew seen them and some history's of the series I had live them on my own
B009KEN87O|5.0|Like some of the other reviewers, I was ready to be underwhelmed, but I am glad the 42 reviews it had at the time convinced me to give it a try.<br /><br />I think the simplicity and gameplay jumped out at me because I just uninstalled a fun game (Yumby Smash) that was forcing me to make in-app purchases to have a hope of winning. This is just good old fun.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|Very funny movie and the characters are great, I love it since the first time. Thank you It's a great movie

B005LAIH9K|5.0|Funny movie from the beginning to the end I love it like the other three American Pie movies they are very funny!!
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|I have the Blu-ray combo pack I bought using gift cards.  I had not seen this in the theater and just pre-ordered it with some gift cards I had received during Christmas.  I loved the LOTR and have the extended version on Blu-ray as well but had purchased that after the UV copy was no longer available, so this was my first UV experience.  I'll comment on that separately.  I also watched some extra's that were included prior to receiving the actual movie -  I think it was called \\"The Hobbit, the journey begins\\" or something similar which peaked my interest but only so much.<br /><br />Blu-Ray Movie:  first, just don't expect the epic that LOTR was.  The Hobbit is a prelude to the LOTR and explains how Bilbo found the Ring.  The books had the Hobbit as a lot more light-hearted than the LOTR trilogy.  So you don't have these massive armies attacking each other or even a sense of urgency in this adventure.  The start lays out the background of Lonely Mountain and how the dwarves were driven from it by Smaug - who you don't get to see a lot of in this film.  The dwarves themselves are a bit comical except for Thorin who is dead serious.  There are a few foes that have more development than the LOTR movies had - for instance trolls discussing how to cook & eat dwarves, orcs chasing the dwarves for revenge, goblins who have some dialect in the movie.<br />  That said there are some things that are being introduced as \\"lead ins\\" for LOTR (of course the movie starts with Bilbo's going away party and him talking to Frodo, so you can say this is him telling his story - i.e. what he was writing in his book).  The problem is of course the LOTR has already been released and most likely if you are wanting to see the Hobbit it is because you saw LOTR.  The reason that is a problem is because LOTR is about the \\"dark\\" times and the war that is being waged.  The Hobbit is a \\"lighter\\" time and the war has not started yet.  It is also going to be hard to judge from the first movie (I amsurprised it's taking 3 to tell the story as I thought 2 would suffice).  I think a lot went into explaining the background in this first movie.  They haven't even made it to Mirkwood yet.<br />  I can't imagine how they could have extended versions also planned but I guess there is a lot of material to work with so they'll have something to squeeze in there to help squeeze your wallet :)<br />  Bottom line is I enjoyed the movie and knew I wanted to get the series to add to my LOTR Blu-ray set.  I just think I'm going to keep each one as it comes out and not bother with the extended version this time.  You really have to decide if you want it now or if renting (or borrowing from a friend) would suffice until the \\"set\\" or extended version(s) are all available.<br /><br />UV: This was an issue for me. As stated previously I had not used UV copies prior to this.  I went to the website as directed and started entering information.  I saw you could use your google account so I tried that.  Everything worked for Flixster (you apparently need flixster to watch the UV copy) and then I had to setup and link the UV account.  That's when things started to go wrong.  Somehow two accounts were generated with my gmail/google account.  I eventually got it worked out and then things seemed to work fine until I tried to watch my movie.  I kept getting prompted to enter a password for flixster because (according to the site) it was safer instead of just using my google account.  Problem was it wouldn't take any password I tried to assign it.  I gave up and canceled the account and setup a new one using a different email address instead of the gmail account.  Now it finally works.  The movie is in SD and not HD at this time.  I also cannot download it to my mobile phone because flixster doesn't support it for HTC phones (I have the flixster app on my phone).<br /><br />Extra Features on Blu-ray: I finally had time to sit and watch the extra features.  The Hobbit: The journey beginsI had actually already downloaded and watch as part of the \\"package\\" and it is about 30 minutes or so.  There are also video blogs which were interesting to watch.  They included all of the trailers but those got a bit repetitive with just the last part changing.  And there was also game trailers.  There was a code to watch the 3/24 Q&A with Jackson and although I missed the time I was still able to access the content and watch it this last Friday (3/29).  I was a bit let down as I didn't get a sneak peek at Smaug so I guess I have to wait.<br /><br />So it probably would have been better if it had been released prior to the LOTR but as long as you can keep in mind this is prior to the war and a \\"happier\\" time, then you can perhaps enjoy the movie.  Also this first movie spends a lot of time setting up the history - it can be argued it spent too much time and perhaps all the material being added is being done so to justify making three movies.  Of course if you felt like you couldn't get enough of Middle Earth then the \\"extra\\" intro will perhaps satisfy some of your need.  It also would have been better (for me) if I could download the movie to my mobile device instead of streaming, but I guess it's in the cloud so as long as I can access WiFi I guess I can \\"watch\\" it but really prefer the download to avoid \\"buffering\\" and waiting...<br /><br />Edit - added Extra Features info.

B0002VFXFE|5.0|Cheap way to get your CPU cool, change heat sink twice and have used same thermal paste. This stuff does the trick!
B007DIQC90|5.0|I adore Of Monsters and Men. They have soul and their songs make you nod your head back and forth, your feet stomp, your hands clap and your whole body move. They are great
