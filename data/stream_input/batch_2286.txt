B00BF11STU|3.0|My girlfriend and I have a running joke - Zero Dark Thirty released so fast they must have been filming the movie, and simply tacked on the ending after Bin Laden was actually killed.<br /><br />It quite honestly seems this way; the last 45 minutes of the movie are filled with humor and action, and seem entirely different from the rest of the slowly paced, confusing at times narrative.<br /><br />I would say my biggest issue with the movie: it does very little to question the circumstances surrounding Bin Laden, instead presenting America as the 'good guy' in a righteous-kill style story.
B004H6G0TI|5.0|Takes a long time to get through a level, not sure if that's good or bad. The graphics and game play are aces (play on words), but really it's a good game. The music is cute. Unsure if it's worth the full price but for faotd I'll keep it. Will update this review if my opinion changes. It's sad people get hyped on Apple ported apps, android stands its own ground.

B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I really enjoy these games  but I just bought a samsung tablet thinking I could keep all of my books and games from my kindle fire. Well only my books transfered over not my games. Amazon please makes all the diner dash games compatible with my android tablet because I enjoy both the android market as well as the amazon market.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I am avid reader of books of this nature.  I loved it a true account of an american hero. I have been in the Marine Corps for 17 years and i can relate to him!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I bought these books separately as they came out and loved them.  When the collection came out, I bought that and retread the series.  I gained more insights the second time and appreciated the authors talents more.  If you like SyFy, it is a must read

B004JN1D2I|5.0|I love great book series and this is one of my favorites. After finishing these in my Kindle, I immediately purchased the fifth book.  It will be interesting to see what HBO includes in their second season, as there is so much intrigue, action and character development that it would be hard to pick what to include.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! my whole family plays it and most of my friends do too. I personally love it more than most of the games I have
B004H6G0TI|4.0|This game is playing great so far. What I appreciate are that the controls are nice, and you get that 3D aspect where it feels like you are flying. That is one of the best parts for me, as it is amazingly fun, and I can see a lot of people gravitating towards this game for that particular reason. The music used in the game is beautiful and very soothing as you try to blast other planes out of the sky. The game itself is very easy to play, but going for all planes can be quite frustrating at times. It is worth the price and a fun time killer.

And then as if that’s not enough he lets you go with him on the biggest adventure of your life.<br /><br />I gave it a four instead of a five only because I want to rate The Lion and The Lion’s Game higher, if you can imagine that.<br /><br />Darl Brant
032147404X|5.0|Kelby's books are all excellent. You don't get a lot of deep reading, or a bunch of math mumbo-jumbo about the magnification of the diffraction is equal to the square length of the focal length divided by pi. What you get is something like &#34;If you want your subject to be in sharp focus and the background to be all soft and blurry, here's what to do.&#34;<br />Sections are organized so if you want to learn how to do wonderful landscapes but could not care less about studio lighting, you can zero in on landscapes!<br />There is some duplication among the different volumes (I have three, I think there's one more) but not so much that you feel taken advantage of.<br />Veteran professionals won't need these books but the rest of us can benefit greatly!

B006DX4PXQ|5.0|This movie was so great.  It can show you what could happen with a pandemic outbreak.  The movie Outbreak was good, but it could not compare with the movie Contagion.  I have watched this movie over and over again.  It is awesome.  The first thing you hear in the movie is a cough.  This movie gives the insight of what could really happen it there was an outbreak of a deadly virus.

B005LAIIPS|5.0|As far fetch as it seems, this movie shows us how things might be or are with the government.  Who knows, this stuff might go on.  I wouldn't be surprised.  I loved this movie and all the other Bourne movies.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I really loved this book, and it brought back all the excitement and sense of wonder and adventure I felt as a teenager, when I first started to read science fiction and--aged twelve or thirteen--I was reading Rex Gordon's just out 1957 book, \\"First On Mars,\\" about an astronaut marooned on what the author envisioned as a Mars that was much more full of life than the essentially lifeless Mars depicted in \\"The Martian.\\"<br /><br />The indomitable, wise-cracking Watney, his grit, refusal to give in to despair or self-pity, his knowledge, skill, and inventiveness, cool, unflappable attitude, and moxie where the keys to him surviving his perilous situation, and the science behind and the descriptions of the many improvisations and workarounds he had to devise--which could have been deadly dull--were, instead, a seamlessly integrated part of the plot that kept me wanting to find out what was going to happen next, and how Watney was going to surmount whatever potentially deadly problem came along.<br /><br />The author has a very deft touch, and I look forward to reading more of his work in the future.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Denzel Washington does it again.  This man is a superb actor.  He made the movie.  The movie did not make him.  His protrail of an acholic pilot brought it true to life.  The movie was great.

B0070Y46UY|3.0|I heard this book was philosophical or spiritual, but never felt that the writer was either.  While he did a good job of keeping the story compelling and descriptive, I felt that he lacked the ability to tie reflection to the description. Like any good, but not great, artwork can have meaning to the viewer that was never intended by the artist, I think readers make meaning of this work apart from the writers intent.<br /><br />It felt like a lot of description to get to the punch line of the tiger representing his aggression. What he feared most was his aggression toward himself and others. Not bad, but no Steinbeck.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I enjoyed this book because it kept you guessing right to very end. Will Robie was a great character. Would love to read more books with him as the main character. A Jack Reacher of sorts.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|I bought this for my husband and he cannot stop listening to it.  He says it is the BEST Jimi Hendrix album he's ever heard.  Kudos to the family for finally getting this one out of the court system, away from the attorneys and onto a CD.<br /><br />This was a tragic time-frame in our musical history with so many of our talented singers taken from us by drug overdoses.  It's hard to imagine how much more these talented singers could have added to our music history if they had lived longer!

I've always enjoyed Southern Rock, Outlaw Country and the Blues to varying degrees. No one album or song is better than the other but they all have different levels of those styles coming together to make some of the best music I've heard. Can't stop listening.

B000SEGUDE|2.0|It takes two abilities to compose a good novel. One is the development of the overall concept itself. The author's idea of portraying the reincarnation process across a number of generations and differing social structures was commendable. The second, of course, is the ability to portray this concept into a fluid and understandable manner to his/her readers. In this the author failed. His generational swings lacked cohesion and continuity. To explain my review further:<br /><br />1. Reincarnation- Because this concept is not fully accepted in Western culture, the author took a commendable chance with this being the major thrust of the novel. Unfortunately while the concept of the birthmark pointed directly to this spiritual ideal, little else was done to further define it. There was no striving by the characters to become better and better persons, there was no personal growth from one generation to the next and, lastly, there was little, if any, community discussion about these beliefs. To the author reincarnation seems to be similar to a merry-go-round insomuch that we spin in continual circles always arriving back at the original starting point.<br /><br />2. Time- While numerous reviewers adamantly were displeased with how the author moved ahead and then backwards in the natural time sequence, I actually felt it was a commendable idea. Time, away from 3D space, is literally non-existent in the manner in which we view it. It is fluid and, being so, traveling forward, backward and even sideways is a natural occuring process.<br /><br />3. Religion- While fairly absent from the more modern lifetimes, when mentioned it was highly structural and contained beliefs that were based on fantasies and folk tales. Is the author telling us that this how all religion should be viewed today?<br /><br />4.Characterizations- Except for the one single character which existed in today's timeframe, the characters were a pathetic and non-inspiring a group of fictional beings that you will encounter. But, the sad thing about them is that each one thought themselves to be special, unique and had a great deal to give society. But, on the other hand, is this not the definition we have of all other people that we see around us? Don't we solely define ourselves as being the only person of value and worth?<br /><br />5.Dystopic World- While the fantasy world of tomorrow that was created by the author was imaginative and unique it did not appear to have been able to flow from the previous generation's technology. The concept of `womb tanks' does seem to be able to evolve from energy technology of the previous reading. He may have had the world destroy itself at that point instead of evolving into a sphere of automatons.<br /><br />6. Reverse foreshadowing- I did, however, think it quite clever of the author, at the end of the book, to give a foreshadowing of how the world, in this novel, would turn out. Unfortunately because we were reading in reverse time at that point the foreshadowing was more of a conclusion than an arrow pointing forward.<br /><br />In sum, this book is, at best, a task to read. The writing is not fluid, the names and dates between characters becomes quite complex, the author seems to drone on and on in many instances that could have been shortened or eliminate and, lastly, for those who desired a formative text about the single reincarnation of a soul throughout time, a major disappointment is at hand. Sorry..............u will encounter. But, the sad thing about them is that each one thought themselves to be special, unique and had a great deal to give society.

B00BESIKWM|1.0|Then this is what you need to watch.<br />Not only do they throw the original, perfectly reasonable premise of a corrupt religious cult and the relativity of right and wrong, but they also decided \\"continuity\\" is not really something they needed to worry about.<br /><br />Everything that was right with the first movie, was destroyed, redone incorrectly, and then the carcass was used to cloak this piece of cinema as something remotely related to the original, very enjoyable film.
B00AA7V2Z0|5.0|Good breakout hit with B actors and interesting plot, albeit somewhat predictable sometimes... the season closer was a let-down, but season is where it's at as far as cable network writing and cutting-edge production work goes. Very easy to tell when a different DP was used per some episodes as camerawork from left-field will appear in later episodes never to be seen in another episode again.<br />FX has such high quality stuff coming out nowadays, especially Archer and The League.

B00BB8RKH6|3.0|I agree with the reviewers who said \\"the movie crashed after the plane did\\".<br /><br />The idea of (SPOILER ALERT) a drunk pilot who makes a heroic landing is a fascinating premise.  Hero or villain?  Would the accident have happened if he'd been sober?  For that matter, would he have been able to pull off the death-defying maneuvers that saved most of the passengers if he was straight and terrified like his co-pilot?<br /><br />Unfortunately, the movie never really explores any of these themes.  Instead we spend 90 minutes watching a drunk and a liar basically circling the drain.<br /><br />His epiphany, when it comes, is hard to believe.  Crucial evidence about the plane's condition is saved until the end, even though this would have been known by everyone involved much earlier on in the piece.  And the Hollywood Happy Ending is forced so hard it hurts.<br /><br />Denzel Washington is, as usual, terrific.  And he makes as much out of this role as anyone could.  But at the end of the day not even he can salvage a great idea that was left hanging in the air.

B006OV7RQ4|3.0|Elizabeth Olsen plays a young woman who has just run away from an abusive cult after witnessing something that should not be disclosed here. Going back and forth in time (a narrative device that I think has been overused these days), \\"Martha Marcy May Marlene\\" follows the story of the titular heroine struggling to shake off her past.<br /><br />The film attempts to focus the psychological aspect of Martha spiraling into paranoia. It's a worthy attempt told in a unique way, blurring the boundaries between the past and the present, and bolstered by the strong acting of Elizabeth Olsen. Much of the film's emotional power rests on the shoulders of Elizabeth Olsen, whose talent has been much talked about.<br /><br />However, despite her subtle and nuanced performance as traumatized Martha, as well as John Hawkes's fine portrayal of the cult leader (don't miss his singing Jackson C. Frank song \\"Marcy's Song\\"), the film's story doesn't really convince partly because of the plotline that, if told in linear timeline, sounds pretty implausible (will the cult group let her go so easily?), and partly because of the cardboard supporting characters that surround Martha: Martha's sister Lucy (Sarah Paulson), who should be much worried especially when her sister had been missing for two years; and Lucy's husband Ted (Hugh Dancy), whose rather clichéd portrayal of rich and unconcerned husband only disappoints.<br /><br />First time feature writer/director Sean Durkin knows what he is doing. This is the story of Martha, who finds it hard to run away from her memories that keep haunting - or maybe not just from the memories, as some of the clues strongly suggest. As a psychological drama \\"Martha Marcy May Marlene\\" is certainly fascinating as long as you keep watching the character of Martha or Marcy May. I wish that Mr. Durkin had more effort into fleshing out other characters.

After that no surprises no real depth. Exceptional photography however. Oversaturation made the color imagery really pop in an interesting way.
0762777931|3.0|I have many mixed feelings about this book.  Clearly the author is a bright person who has done a lot of research.  I enjoyed many of the references.  I even learned something that until now no doctor has been able to diagnose in myself (pain in the sternum is from low Vitamin D levels).  That said, I also found several inaccuracies, and claims that were stated as facts rather than hypotheses.  But the real reason I gave this book an \\"average\\" rating is that I did not care for the author's trash-talking style.  It was extremely tiresome.  I felt like I was getting text messages from an overgrown 14-year old who is trying desperately to sound cool, and whatever the intended result, for me it dumbed down the book. Admittedly, that could be a cultural/generational thing, but unfortunately it made reading this book unpleasant in the extreme.

B005WTR4ZI|5.0|This book is about jobs (lack of) and information technology (more and more of it) the main claim is strong and one that should be read by every student as they plan their future. The second part (about the potential) cover in short (too short) the potential.

Together with the nature of Digital products -- the books of economy needs to be re-written.

B003VS0CX8|5.0|This is a genuine American classic movie regarding a musical Austrian family who eventually settled in America. Theirs is one of the glorious truly happy endings in moviedom. The DVD and Blu-ray were both included and knocked my socks off with the picture and sound quality. I have never seen the opening scene with the mountain lake water so clear, not even in the theater. Truly, the DVD is just slightly inferior to the Blu-ray, but the Blu-ray was just plain awesome and really showed off my monitor. Add in the glorious and visually dazzling story, with the classical outdoors beauty and romance, intrigue and yes, Nazis, closing in on the good guys.  This truly is a touchstone movie in so many ways and it is not an understatement to say that they not only don't make them like this anymore, but seldom did. Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer and all the rest of the cast were really in top form. A must see for families- I have had this movie in Betamax ((what's a betamax), VHS, DVD and now in Blu Ray and the colors, shadings and cinematography are stunning and lifelike. Watch this movie and see if you don't find yourself humming some of the many hit songs from it in the next several days- Edelweiss, These are a few of my favorite things, I am sixteen, going on seventeen, and the glorious &#34;Sound of music.&#34; Uplifting and upbeat really resonate in a depressing and sad world. Yes, it was based on a true story, and the Von Trapps still own the ski lodge they opened in Vermont. The last big collaboration of Rogers and Hammerstein is a classic that will endure as long as we can watch movies. It is very difficult to imagine this movie being made today, the mid 1960s were a very different time. In all a glorious movie, that happens to be a truly happy true story.

0062238868|4.0|\\"American Sniper\\" is the story of Chris Kyle (RIP), his philosophy on \\"doing his job\\", and the impact on his family life. The writing style is not outstanding, but it does flow well enough to keep anyone interested in the subject matter. As might be expected, due to nature of Chris's job as a special forces sniper, there is a lot of bravado and graphic details associated with describing the missions he relates to the reader. We also get to the see the disassociation required from family ties and the somewhat disturbing dehumanization of the targets he had to take out.<br /><br />His job was important to the soldiers he protected during \\"overwatch\\" missions and he undoubtedly saved many American and \\"allied\\" forces lives by taking out threatening insurgents from a distance before they could get in range of patrols and convoys. Taking the politics out of it and looking at a from the viewpoint of a man that was clearly a patriot and believed he was saving lives by what he did in the field.<br /><br />Ironically the book ends with him leaving the service, starting a company that trains shooters, and sought to help returning veterans, one of which shot and killed both Steve and another man that was trying to help him out.<br /><br />This was a good and engaging read for those with an interest in the subject.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

B000OJFV4C|3.0|The acting is excellent, as are script, the costumes and scenery. What troubles me is that after watching the episode about Margaret Tudor's marriage to the King of Belgium, I researched her to see if it is believed she really did murder her husband. The facts are that Margaret married the King of Scots. Her sister Mary Tudor married the King of France, not Belgium. From there, Mary's circumstances are similar to the character Margaret's; and I understand Mary's name was changed in the series to Margaret so a not to confuse her with Henry's daughter Mary. This alteration of the facts makes me realize that I can't rely on &#34;The Tudors&#34; for historical accuracy, and downgrades my enjoyment of the series from five stars to three. I don't know yet if I will watch Season 2. Maybe.

076535618X|4.0|I actually read the companion novel Zoe's Tale, which is to The Last Colony as Ender's Shadow is to Ender's Game, before I read The Last Colony. It makes little difference which one reads first. Both are very welcome continuations of the story Scalzi began in Old Man's War. I read both books in hasty gulps, and then went back to savor the details I'd hardly had time to absorb. I always appreciate the emotional depth Scalzi brings to his science fiction.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was an amazing book. Could not put it down. The end completely took me by surprise. A must read
B00B5P37IG|1.0|Mostly religious channels and some off brand news channels. Waste of $!!!.  There are no ABC, CBS, NBC, fox, bravo, CNN, history or any other known channels you would expect from a TV app.  Plus there is no preview of channels until you buy it.
B0089LOKHG|3.0|So they just wander around in the woods for a few hundred pages with no real resolution at the end. Was interesting to read from Hana's point of view but in the end don't think it really added anything to the story. Should have been a 4 book series, did not feel like the end of a trilogy.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|A very enjoyable book. My interest was kept by many unexpected plot twists that made what was coming next a surprise at many turns. The effort that must have gone into researching the details presented here is evident and made it a much more captivating work. In an interview, Mr Brown<br />mentioned the he wanted this work to \\"hit it out of the park\\" and I believe he has done this and himself proud.

B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|Medifast stopped working with 10 pounds to go.  I just cut out the diet supplements 2 days a week on this plan.  Fast day is actually easier than other days.  I don't watch the clock waiting for the next time to eat. I'm not looking for the sugar free jello or &#34;what can I eat now&#34;. I'm actually only cutting out 500 calories each day on the fast but it's good for retraining the mind, that I don't have to be eating all the time.  60 pounds total gone.

B00A9X9TIW|5.0|You've got to pay attention to this movie, or you'll easily get lost.  And yes it tends to go against the grain of time travel theory of whether or not time is linear, or parallel.
B000SGGUWS|2.0|The book was good. I've been watching the show on TV and that's why I started reading the books. I already knew what was going to happen so that's why I wasn't really intrigued by the book.

B007HC3LHS|5.0|This was the best thriller  I have ever read. It kept me on the edge, and had it read in two days. It gave a person some insight into OCD.
B000XT1P3E|4.0|You can't go wrong with a double feature which has Julia Roberts, particularly if one of the films is Erin Brockovich. Personally, I haven't seen Notting Hill, so can't comment on it, however the price point of this offer was great and my wife was very happy with this small gift. So...a win-win in my book.
B009KEN87O|4.0|The game is very fun and reminds it me of galaga, still just as challenging with a new twist and somewhat upgraded graphics.
B007MCTTHY|4.0|Good mind bender for all ages. Would recommend as a problem solving puzzle for kids especially.<br />The help is not very readable, especially for mixing colors as the levels move up - only a minor negative though.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|Fantastic reading with many twists and turns.  Loved the characters. I would definitely look at reading many more of her books

B000IMUYJM|3.0|I liked it. Not as Much as I Liked The Remake. It Was Descent Enough To Own It.  Ending Could Have Been Better.

B0050DIWFC|4.0|I have not finished the book yet, However I know I am going to, that is one of the indicators  I know it is a good book.  If a storyline goes stale, boring or or predictable midway through a book, I will not finish . This one will be completed - Good Read!!
B004S3MB2U|5.0|Great Calculator.  Hope to learn more of its more advanced financial functions when I get time. But does everything I and my kids need.
B00009R86L|5.0|Wow!  Why didn't I buy this sooner?  I've had a [[ASIN:B00009R881 Domke F-2 Original Bag (Black)]] for years, and I've been carrying it around with the default strap.  What an idiot I've been!  Shoulder bags are extremely convenient for photojounalists like me; they allow for much easier access to lenses, cameras, and small accessories than backpacks do, but this comes at the expensive of increased apparent weight.  With this pad on, my Domke feels like it's half the weight of before.  It's not a big deal if I'm only walking around for an hour, but a whole day?  This thing is a relief.  In fact, I've bought more just to add my other (non camera) shoulder bags as well, and this works great there as well!<br /><br />The only real con I can think of is that it can sometimes shift to an awkward spot on the bag strap, requiring me to readjust its positioning, but that's a common disadvantage of all adjustable pads.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I am almost half way through this book and right from the beginning it held my interest.  I hope it will the rest of the way through. It is interesting how he describes what might of happened to him and how he feels while he is in the coma.

B0013TTLDE|5.0|Very well told story, flashing back to past just enough. Well formed characters with interesting personalities.  Looking forward to more from this author.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|It's not as challenging as I expected. The levels completed were good I look forward to an increase in difficulty as it advances.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun, addicting, and creative. They have alot of cool stuff and yea, the only down part I can say about it is that is really batterie killing.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Great movie.. beautiful made by Ben Affleck. Since it is based on a true story makes it all the more interesting. Kept the pace start to end. So deserved the Oscar!
B005LAII9O|4.0|Product arrived in good condition and the movie is an overall enjoyment - for adults viewing.  It's a story of young &#34;entrepreneurs&#34; in the drug trade, a look into the partner sharing of a single woman and finding a formula refining the purity of a 'drug' is a target of other dealers (ie: doesn't this resemble the business enterprise world..?).<br />The success of this movie is due to the strong supporting cast of John Travolta, Salma Hayek and Benicio Del Toro.  These 3 veteran actors played their roles well.  The location settings are terrific, including the lab.<br />The sexual scenes after 10 minutes into the movie is, in my opinion, unnecessary.  It could have been done in other methods to illustrate the woman-sharing partnership of the 2 leading male characters.  The female character holds no value in the movie although it is used as the primary reason for the turmoil and violence in the movie.  It would have been a better script - for example, no girl but 3 best buddies - Dennis (Travolta), Chon (Kitch) and Ben (Taylor) looking out for each other.<br />As for the 2 lead characters played by Kitch and Taylor, they did not give me a true-buddy feeling.  I guess they can learn a lot from the 3 professional actors supporting them.<br />The graphic-brutality of the drug-dealers may hold some truth in it but it seems decapitation is such a commonly use effect to extort and exert force.  I think the real drug lords should think of a better and creative way of enticing dedicated followers - instead of cutting them to pieces.<br />Overall, its because of Travolta, Hayek and Del Toro + the scenic environment that gives it a 4.
B000I2J6K0|5.0|This is a great workout, especially for women who did more strenuous workouts before pregnancy. I used to do P90X and Insanity workouts before I was pregnant and found that this workout brings a good amount of intensity, while still using movements that are safe for pregnant women.  I've also read several pregnancy books and noticed that Erin incorporates a lot of the exercises that are recommened for preparation of labor, which is great.  It does seem like a fairly low-budget production, as some other reviewers have mentioned, but the workout is a good one, so I don't mind. There are a couple times she seems to spazz out a little bit, but I think it's kind of funny... She reminds me of Cheri Oteri from Saturday Night Live in the late 90s. Overall, I would definitely recommend this video to anyone trying to stay in shape while pregnant.
B00A6N8F4Y|3.0|This movie would have been a 5 star film with better acting and directing. It lacked experienced camera operators or production. Still worth seeing just for the story alone.
B008JFLWLE|5.0|It is border line amazing & magical. I recommend to anyone needing quick calculations.  It will leave you in wonder of it's capabilities.

B005UBNL0A|5.0|Custom build for gaming pc for my son.  I purchased this with plans to upgrade the processor tho the 8 core amd.  But no need, this is plenty of power for sons needs.
B009EEFTMC|3.0|I suppose I would like this game better if the cubes were more responsive. Sometimes you can tap on one and nothing happens. So you tap again. And again. And again. And nothing happens. Again. This wastes time and the clock is ticking away. So the game experience is frustrating and annoying. I would love to see the problem fixed because, otherwise, I find Cubistry exciting and challenging. You compete against your own best score, hoping to beat it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love to read and have been purchasing my books from Amazon for as long as they been in business. Since most of my devices are android it only right that  I download this apps.  This allow me to experience the best reading possible on my device especially when they sync across different platform.  I don't know what I would do without

B00BEZTMFY|2.0|So Peter Jackson is back in the director's chair to put the classic whimsical Tolkien novel The Hobbit on screen.  What you get here is part 1 of a 3 part trilogy of a 290 page book.  Yeah, seriously.  This film is riddled with poor dialogue, violence at every corner, Jackson and company treat the audience like a bunch of morons with their script, unnecessary changes made to the book, and deviates from what is important in the novel, which is Bilbo Baggins' craftiness!  What should have been maybe two shorter films or one long film of whimsical fun has/will be turned into 9 hours of paycheck for Jackson.<br /><br />Now I don't want to be completely unfair, let's start with the good things in the movie.<br />THE GOOD---<br />The dialogue.  But wait, didn't I say the dialogue was bad?  Yes, the dialogue is terrible, but there are moments when the dialogue is brilliant, and the only time those times happen is when they actually USE THE DIALOGUE TOLKIEN WROTE.  The scene where Gandalf meets Bilbo and exchange good mornings, that was perfection and that is what this movie should have been.  Riddles in the Dark is relatively good because they use TOLKIEN'S dialogue.  Tolkien was a master with words and the dialogue is almost 100% written for this book.  Whenever the dialogue from Tolkien's pen is used, it works great.<br /><br />Bilbo spares Gollum.  The scene where Bilbo spares Gollum's life is a fantastic scene.  It was moving.  It worked.  We finally get to see what should be the main character BILBO be the centerpiece of something moving.<br /><br />Gandalf and some of the opening.  I actually really enjoyed the opening scene where they show the Kingdom Under the Mountain Erebor.  It was great.  Gandalf was well done as well.<br /><br />THE BAD----<br />Most of the opening.  The opening should have been introducing Erebor and cut straight to Bilbo outside of his house being visited by Gandalf.  No, we get an unnecessary cameo from Frodo Baggins and Ian Holm.  Come on.This is where it starts for the second worse thing in the film and that is....<br /><br />LOOK, REMEMBER THIS FROM LORD OF THE RINGS???  Ok Peter Jackson, we get it, Frodo was in LOTR.  Yeah we know, look its Elrond, Sarumon, and Galadriel from LOTR.  Holy crap its Rivendell, remember that from Lord of the Rings?  Remember this?  Remember that?  What the heck is Jackson thinking about?  This film should be focused on Bilbo and finding the magic ring, but what we get is a slew of \\"Look audience, remember this?!?!?!\\"  Did the script writers seriously sit there and decide, hey we should show this to remind the audience that it was in Lord of the Rings!  This is garbage writing.  More on the writing soon.<br /><br />Aragor....I mean Thorin.  Jackson and company have ruined Thorin.  He doesn't even match the description in the book.  Read the book.  Thorin is a glorified dwarf with a long flowing grey beard (which stood for strength) and was tough.  What we get here is Thorin, the douche-bag bro from Jersey Shore.  Thorin is terrible.  Jackson has said frequently that the films he makes should be Tolkien's film.  Hey Peter, read the book kid.  So since we established that Peter and the other script writers either can't read or just used the pages from the Hobbit for toilet paper for the crew....<br /><br />Violence, some plot, violence, walk, violence.  How is there not a universal consensus that this film is just more typical Jackson violence.  The book's first bit of violence is when Gandalf and Thorin find swords in the Troll's cave and then they are the only two that wield weapons.  The Dwarves didn't even set out from Hobbiton armed.  What we get though are 13 dwarves prepared to cut down anything in their path.  Since we armed the Dwarves, Jackson might as well insert as many battle scenes as possible.  This is insulting to Tolkien who wrote his novels as a sort of \\"war is the last option,\\" but it makes me battle fatigued.  Its just one thing after another.  Fight fight fight fight.  It isn't even good.  The scene in the Goblin Cave is just ridiculous.  It treats violence like breathing.  Just happens, nothing special here, just move on!  With that said....<br /><br />Liberty with scenes/inserted scenes.  The scene with the three trolls.  Read the book.  Each Dwarf gets snatched up in secret.  Let's cut into Jackson's script writing session:<br />Peter Jackson: So in the next chapter of the book, the trolls secretly capture all the dwarves and Bilbo uses cunning to get them out.  Hmmmm....there is no violence or a fight.  Ok, scratch that, Tolkien doesn't know what he is doing, I got this.  They will fight and fight some more.<br />This is all over.  Jackson inserts so many stupid useless scenes.  Let's just ignore the stupid cameos from Galadriel, Sarumon and Radagast.  More garbage.  This film should be focused on BILBO.  Not all this other useless garbage.<br /><br />Wrong central theme.  Instead of Bilbo being the main character, we get the story focused on #1, Thorin.  #2, Look here is how this will connect with Lord of the Rings (Radagast, Sarumon, ect.), and then #3.  Jackson finally said, oh yeah, Bilbo is in this story too, better put him in somewhere.  Garbage.<br /><br />Lastly and my favorite stupid thing from this movie, the dialogue and treating the audience like morons as written by Peter Jackson.  Let's start with the blatant foreshadowing from Peter Jackson.  Early in the film Gandalf clearly tells Bilbo it is important to make a good decision on whether or not to kill someone, to show pity.  Here is exact quote \\" True courage is about knowing not when to take a life, but when to spare one.\\"  GEE, THANKS PETER.  I'm glad you think your audience is far too stupid to realize that something might happen later.  This is all over the film.  Peter Jackson thinks so highly of himself and so little of his audience he resorts to that garbage plot writing and instead of using Tolkien's witty and beautiful dialogue, he replaces it with fight scenes, CGI and very poor written dialogue.<br /><br />Oh my god, the dialogue.....it is TERRIBLE.  You can tell which pieces of speech are written by Tolkien in the book and which pieces of dialogue are written by our genius writers in Peter Jackson, his wife and Fran Walsh.  If the dialogue sounds like an after-school cartoon special \\"When there is sickness, bad things happen,\\" (that is actually in the film) you KNOW Jackson was in on it.  Or the last scenes when Thorin talks to Bilbo, just terrible.  I cannot believe how bad the dialogue is.  \\"Do you smell it?  The scent of fear.\\"  Oh god....am I watching Lifetime?<br /><br />This movie is absolute garbage.  Hollywood, CGI, garbage of a literary masterpiece crafted by a master writer.  There is a reason Christopher Tolkien calls his father's work on the Hobbit being \\"eviscerated\\" by Peter Jackson.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Surprised to find this another great bond movie, I'm more of a Sean Connery follower myself, but Daniel Craig is coming along!
B00A81MV3U|5.0|This movie was a treat. For months I kept telling myself I want to see this and I finally did(weeks after the Oscars). I have become a HUGE Jennifer Lawrence fan mainly because of her performance in this movie(though I have been pleased with some of her other work too). Her and Bradley Cooper played their roles with amazing realism. One can almost believe these two really do step out of a psychiatric unit. The chemistry between these two characters was also amazing. Some stars have it, some stars don't. These two have it. I highly recommend this movie for any movie lover who likes a good story rather then all the bells and whistles of special effects and exploding cars.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Another  excellent  story by one of my favorite authors. Hope to see more of this hero and his odd family.
B008JFUN8C|1.0|After reading all the other reviews for Oz The Great and Powerful, I question if we actually saw the same movie? Personally I found that this film was extremely disappointing. Without going into what the movie was about and who played whom, I am going to review what I found extremely disappointing in this film. Of course this is in no way a judgement, just my own observation. #1 the casting was poorly done. I am an avid lover of the original film and to place James Franco in the earlier role of Frank Morgan was just completely poor judgement. Then Mila Kunis as Margaret Hamilton? Granted, I do like the story line of how The Wicked Witch of the West came into fruitation but Mila Kunis? Really? Lets not get me going on Michelle Williams as the younger version of Bubbly and cheerful Billie Burke. The casting was all wrong for this film. #2 the costumes was another HUGE disappointment to me. Part of the magical allure of the original were there fun costumes. It was sad to see Disney couldn't be bothered to mask those costumes. The quick scene with the few munchkins looking poor and shabby was pathetic not to mention that the people of Emerald City looked like they were wearing every day clothing that weren't even green and lets not even mention the horse of a thousand colors that looked like they were wearing a blanket with multiple colors on it. #3 Mila Kunis costume as the Wicked Witch of the West looked more like the broadway musical \\"Wicked\\" costume rather then the one that Margaret Hamilton wore. and Michelle Williams Costume or crown didn't resemble Glinda's costume at all. Looked like a gown one would wear on the red carpet. Granted some may argue that Disney was trying to modernize the movie but in my opinion, if you are going to make a prequel then you pay attention to details. We have become a sad society whose interests focus on \\"Special Effects\\" rather then \\"Art\\". Just goes to prove that todays generations can not touch \\"Old Hollywood\\" Talents(both on the screen and behind the scenes). For those who have not seen this film, my opinion is, save your money, it was HIGHLY disappointing to one who thoroughly enjoys and prefers \\"Grade A\\" movies to trash.

B00BBW16HW|5.0|Who would have thought the story of a quadrapalegic man could be amusing, romantic and somewhat adventuous? This very well-acted movie completely engages and draws the viewer into the story. Many movies that get the rave reviews this one did turn out to be a little disappointing. Not this one!
B003UBTX6S|4.0|I gave it four stars because I feel like they take too long to get to the point sometimes. It took me about half through the book to really get interested and not want to put it down. I recommend it more for teenagers instead of young adults. I will be finishing the series though.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|This game was really easy. You got the item you need right before  you needed it, so you really only have a max of 3 items in your inventory at any given time. Not really worth the money I spent for this game, but it was still fun
B001H9MYPW|5.0|After I was blown away by season one, I waited over a year, and finally got around to watching season 2. It has seven discs, and by the end of disc 2, I thought to myself, this is very good again, but its not really as good as season 1. But then it started to build up. I just finished the last two discs, and I am blown away all over again! I blame the acting, the directing, and of course, the writing. Absolutely first-rate!<br /><br />If a show about 5 different people going to see a therapist sounds intriguing, give In Treatment a serious attempt. Each character or patient takes a while to get to the meat of their story. None of them really know what to expect in therapy, and they aren't able to trust the therapist. So as he slowly wins them over, and as they share their incredible stories- This show REALLY starts to materialize.<br /><br />Did I mention it is intense? If I weren't such a big macho-type-of-guy, I might have almost choked back a tear or two here! Alright- They actually got me once. Don't tell anyone! What can I say? By the end of the season, I found myself deeply identifying with every single character. Even the ones I didn't like for a while! But, the one that really got me was the 23 year-old girl who was coping with her diagnosis of cancer. Her acting and the plight of her character just really had me wanting to help her. This show is Masterpiece Theater, evolved.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I doubt In Treatment will ever be as popular as it deserves to be. I can't really recommend this to my friends. I don't think they would \\"get\\" it. I can picture them just looking at me like I was a nerd, but I've studied psychology in college and I've used therapy to get through some of my own tough times. I've been fascinated by the profession for a long time. I've seen how well it can help untie the knots in your thoughts, like a massage can handle the knots in your muscles. This show has made me appreciate therapy on a much higher level, with one exceptional episode after the next. Pure art!episode after the next. Pure art!
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I grew up on Harry Potter, and these movies captured the essence of what Harry Potter was all about.  Putting the last movie into 2 movies was the best idea.
B0013FSL0C|5.0|After I was blown away by season one, I waited over a year, and finally got around to watching season 2. It has seven discs, and by the end of disc 2, I thought to myself, this is very good again, but its not really as good as season 1. But then it started to build up. I just finished the last two discs, and I am blown away all over again! I blame the acting, the directing, and of course, the writing. Absolutely first-rate!<br /><br />If a show about 5 different people going to see a therapist sounds intriguing, give In Treatment a serious attempt. Each character or patient takes a while to get to the meat of their story. None of them really know what to expect in therapy, and they aren't able to trust the therapist. So as he slowly wins them over, and as they share their incredible stories- This show REALLY starts to materialize.<br /><br />Did I mention it is intense? If I weren't such a big macho-type-of-guy, I might have almost choked back a tear or two here! Alright- They actually got me once. Don't tell anyone! What can I say? By the end of the season 2, I found myself deeply identifying with every single character. Even the ones I didn't like for a while! But, the one that really got me in this recent season, was the 23 year-old girl who was coping with her diagnosis of cancer. Her acting and the plight of her character just really had me wanting to help her. This show is Masterpiece Theater, evolved.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I doubt In Treatment will ever be as popular as it deserves to be. I can't really recommend this to my friends.

B00356CO1E|5.0|Get this DVD, get it, get it now! I can't say enough about this DVD. Jillian suggests doing each of the 3 levels for 10 days each to get shredded in 30 days. I wanted to complete the program before I put in my two cents. So let me start by saying, I followed the program, 10 days on each level, 30 days with no rest days.<br /><br />I am also on Weight Watchers and I follow the program closely, this DVD (no DVD) will help if you don't couple it with a healthy, light diet. I lost 9 pounds during the month I did it, I would have lost more I think, but I'm breastfeeding, so I'm careful not to lost more than 2 pounds a week.<br /><br />There's a lot of leg work in this DVD, lots of lunges, squats and jumping, so if you have knee troubles be careful. Don't be completely discouraged however, I have some knee trouble too, but I was careful to do the moves properly as Jillian explained and when I needed to I did them slowly to keep the right form. I made it through the entire program without any serious knee pain.<br /><br />That said, I was sore, many times, I felt muscles I didn't know about, but it was the good I-worked-out-hard-today kind of sore. There were times I wanted to quit doing lunges, but I would look down and see how defined my thighs were becoming. When I wanted to get the hell out of plank position I would notice how ripped my arms were becoming and I would keep going.<br /><br />This DVD is challenging and effective. It's 25 minutes a day, it's $7.99 or less if you do the instant DVD (which I did) and it works. Just buy it and do the workout. If you eat right and do the DVD, you will get results.
B003UBTX72|5.0|I loved reading about Keith.  I've been a huge fan forever but didn't know the history, only the music.  Great reading for any Rolling Stones fan and/or any Rock & Roll fan.
B009SQOGZ2|5.0|I was quite impressed with &#34;ParaNorman.&#34; The voice acting is great and the music is beautiful. Visually, the film is stunning. There is some serious stylization going on in the character design that looks really weird in still images, but when the characters are in motion, it doesn't matter. There's a pretty cool sequence at the end that's a smooth marriage of stop-motion and CGI. It looks amazing!<br /><br />The story follows a little boy named Norman who has the strange ability to see ghosts and speak to them. Apparently, people have heard and he's teased for it, even his own father wanting him to just be normal.<br /><br />Norman is befriended by another social outcast, a young kid named Neil who's fat. Norman doesn't really want a friend, but Neil doesn't mind Norman's oddball gift and even wants to see if Norman can help him play with his recently deceased dog. (&#34;He was hit by an animal rescue vehicle. Tragic and ironic.&#34;)<br /><br />However, Norman's uncle pops up on the scene. Something bad is about to happen and Norman needs to be told: the dead are coming! It's tied to the Witch's Curse of Blithe Hollow, Massachusetts: a witch was being tried and cursed her accusers to death and to rise again.<br /><br />To keep her curse at bay, someone with the gift of seeing and speaking with the dead (like Norman, his uncle, and as we can later see, the witch herself: the gift is subtly noted in character design with hexagon-shaped pupils and irises) must read from a book at her grave before sundown once a year. Norman's uncle was doing this, but dies before he can tell Norman what to do, but when he tells him posthumously, he doesn't give him enough details.<br /><br />As Norman tries to read the book at the old graveyard, he's too late as the seven accusers of the witch rise from the dead.<br /><br />With zombies invading the town of Blithe Hollow, it's up to Norman, Neil, Norman's sister Courtney, Neil's brother Mitch, and school bully Alvin to put the witch's curse at bay again: for now and always.<br /><br />&#34;ParaNorman&#34; is a wildly fun, mildly creepy movie with a great message about being non-discriminatory. It's a great film for getting you in the mood for Halloween.<br /><br />I picked up the Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack, and was impressed that the DVD and Blu-Ray contained the same special features on both discs. The included DVD disc is the same as the standalone DVD, and there's a code you can use to redeem for the Ultraviolet and Digital Copy versions, one of which can be redeemed for an Amazon Instant Video version.
B001VIMCW4|1.0|Amazon suggests that it takes 15 minutes for a purchase to show up on Tivo. It is an hour and a half later and no movie. Evening is ruined, family is angry. Wanted to avoid streaming to avoid freezes. Won't purchase again.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Love this series!  Hating the wait between seasons!  Wish the season's were longer! .... .... .... .... .... ..... ....
B00B23O96A|5.0|At 53, I've realized that if I compare my experiences today with when I was 25, I'm going to be constantly disappointed. At 25, the years didn't seem to be rolling over quite as fast as they are today.<br /><br />So I forget about the past and focus only on the future and what purpose and enjoyment can be had today.<br /><br />That said, I don't have a choice when it comes to new music from fossils like Clapton (or Bob Dylan, the Stones, Plant/Page, - you know, musicians etc.)  I just buy it and resign myself to potentially being disappointed.<br /><br />But as old Mick still says, \\"I'm no school boy but I know what I like\\", and on first listen of this album, I thought to myself, not a single dud.  On second listen I thought - WOW.<br /><br />I absolutely love the fact that Eric does not give a toss about commercial success any more.  Nor does he need to, he's probably figured out that his bank account will most likely support his lifestyle for about 300 years, freeing him to indulge in creative freedom.....lucky son of a gun.<br /><br />Buy this album and persevere with it.  You will love it.
B001UGB1X8|5.0|Loved to happen on this one. We listen to Dave robichaugh novels and tommy lee jones is the perfect choice.
B00AYHKIZ6|1.0|I heard the single \\"Where are we now\\"  several weeks prior to getting the album and was quite optimistic of a creative and musical masterpiece along the lines of Diamond Dogs or Young Americans.<br /><br />I've actually tried really hard to like this album, but lets face it folks.........this is crap.<br /><br />By contrast I'm listening to Eric Clapton's new album, \\"Old Sock\\" for only the second time as I write this, and I am feeling joyous and uplifted by this lovely music.<br /><br />My absolute favorite album at the mo is the soundtrack to the Movie \\"Lawless\\".  What a cracker.  Stand out tracks are the up tempo version of White Light/White Heat (coincidently performed by Bowie on his Serious Moonlight Tour, Cosmonaut, and the spine tingling Fire In The Blood/Snake Song (don't be put off by the intro, which I love anyway, but wait till the lady sings.........WOW)<br /><br />Anyway my advice to David Bowie.......go back to sleep.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|Just had fun watching this one. Sort of weird for tom, but it seemed to work in the end. The music is fantastic.
B0051SDM5Q|5.0|These writers provide an excellent approach to any kind of negotiation.  They point out what is problematic about the way we usually &#34;negotiate&#34; and provide an alternate route, one that is fair, more objective, and opens the possibility for all parties to &#34;win.&#34;
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Kept my attention. Laugh, cry, jump, didn't like some scenes of survival on the animal parts, but overall a good experience.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The writer's style of first person narrative is certainly revealing, but at times being welcolmed into her inner voices is a bit excessive.  Anastasia is living in her own inner world, and not much is shared about what is going on in the real world.  Christopher is so involved in his sexual needs that we do not know how he keeps his balance with his business pursuits.  He seems to be living on a tightrope.<br /><br />Apart from the &#34;sexing&#34;, the lack of seeing their relationship as an expression of love and compassion, especially by Christopher, is uncomfortable.  Without this needed depth in a human relationship, we are left seeking its emergence much too long.
0307593525|5.0|We watched the movie and loved it.  My son is a kitchen magician.  This was a gift for him, and he has made very good use of it.  Warning.  Diet how-to books will soon be needed.
B005LAIGRS|5.0|Amazing movie and excellent acting by both Denzel and Ryan!  Great movie to watch if you are into CIA action packed movies and this movie does not disappoint.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|I chanced upon Kate Morton's Forgotten Garden some years ago and was delighted to finally find an author who could weave such a wonderful narrative rich in understanding of lives lived in the hope of 'coming home' to the peace of first understanding and then accepting the past. I bought an iPad last year because bookstores are fast disappearing or turning into stationery and toy stores. The acquisition of an iPad and the Kindle has proved to be a treasurehouse allowing me to read books not commonly available in book stores in India anyway. I have just finished The Secret Keeper and think it is by far the best of Kate Morton's books so far. Her writing makes you feel deeply for the main characters. It would be an injustice to future readers to reveal anything about the storyline. People reading this review have no reason to trust my opinion but I only hope I have made them curious enough to read this wonderful novel.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|Great movie and I love the fact that real navy seals took the time to act in this movie.  I truly appreciate all that our armed forces do for this country!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is my favorite game ever.it is like temple run but subway surfer is way better.I love subway surfer it is the best.
B00BYOEMTQ|5.0|Was not sure what to expect after seeing the other 3 movies in this series, but I fully enjoyed this movie.  I now have a better perspective on the rest of the Lord of the Ring series.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Wonderful t his game is fun and easy to play it most amazing for girls or guys tut h a t love horse.
B005OK721G|5.0|Wow I liked this movie the first time I saw it so I ended up buying it and loved it the second time around as well!! Zoe Saldana is a very talented and beautiful actress and this is a must see movie!!
B00BHU9BV6|3.0|I've recently read the book and watched the PBS version. This latest iteration lacks gravitas, perhaps because both Anna and Vronsky were miscast. V looked about sixteen. Big mistake. The conceit of having a play within a play added nothing. Stream the PBS version for free if you want to watch it. You can get the Kindle version for free!
B000H4TX9I|5.0|I saw the movie Serenity when it came out, and after that I stumbled across a single of episode of Firefly somewhere. For whatever reason, I'm just now getting around to watching the whole series. I've watched about half of them, and I've enjoyed every episode. It's a great concept well-executed!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Love this app. With all these games I dislike having to buy lives and such, but this app really is free. Go for it.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Long wait times and items look like they aren't cheap so not sure I like it yet...Will come back later after playing game more for a better review.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Keeps us connected and updated. Pictures and video capabilities makes it more entertaining!  Makes it able to find many long lost friends and family.
B007SY3CEW|5.0|my piano broke and ive been wanting to play piano really badly.... Then i found dis xDDD sooo yeah you should get it :) btw good for kindle fire users OuO
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This was a cute movie for kids and adults alike.  Many adults will be able relate to some of the older games their kids have no clue even existed.
042524489X|5.0|I've read this book six times already and going to read it again and again!<br />I loved Lucas in first book but Hawke got my attention the second he appeared. Is it surprising?! White golden hair like his wolf's pelt and pale blue gorgeous eyes.Surprising? So NOT! I loved Sienna right away too 'cause she made Hawke crazy easily and every single time! I knew that there's something going on between them, we only need to wait a little cause no matter what horror she went through or how awful life Sienna had,seventeen is just too young. BUT! The waiting was SO worth it! I'm in love with this book! The sensuality in it confirmed why i waited for this book that much. They both start to feel frustrated from every problem that appears in oh so wrong time, but finally Hawke understands that kipping Sienna away is like I love to say-mission impossible! Sienna is not an easy prey and puts Hawke in the right place when he tries to intimidate her because of his dominance, no matter how badly she wants to surrender herself to man that hunts her since the day their eyes met, another reminder to me why I love her character so much. The action scenes here are breathtaking and heartbreaking the same time. They made me want to kill those bastards who were responsible to this violence by myself! We have another love story here and I'm really pleased that Nalini wrote it,both deserve it.So yes,I'm a very obsessed fan of this couple from the very beginning, totally pleased with this book and really can't way to have a lot of glimpses into their life in following books.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great book! Better than the first one! Awesome twist at the end, I really couldn't see the twist that developed at the end coming! Must buy! Can't wait for the next book!!!!
0316228532|1.0|I waited in great anticipation for the release of this novel.  I ran, the first chance I got, and bought this novel for myself, as a birthday gift.  I was so excited to read it that I dove into it the very first day.  Now, normally I can read a book this size in a day or so...it took me over a month to make way through this book.  It was a slow read, because it was absolutely painful to read.  I had to build myself up every time I picked it up, because it was terrible.  It is a story without a climax, and no antagonist.  It was like watching a weeks worth of the British version of Days of Our Lives, only worse.  I would find more pleasure in amputating my own leg with a rusty spoon than reading this novel.  It appears that the publisher accepted this novel based solely on JK Rowlings name being on it.  I will be much more hesitant to purchase any novel by her in the future, especially if it is another adult novel.  The worst part is, I am American and every single one of my most favorite novels were written by a British person...in the 1800's...and I still couldn't stand this book.  JK Rowling wrote the seedy side of people very well, she is an excellent writer...however, it appears she pushed this book out as not to be known as a 'one hit wonder' as it were due to Harry Potter's fame...however, she really diminished herself with this book.  Sorely disappointed.  I cannot stress enough how hard it is to make it through this story, because it is painfully dull.  Be warned, I believe a lot of people forced themselves to like this book because of its author not on its merit. TERRIBLE BOOK and not worth the money....trust me...if you 'must' have it for a personal collection wait for it to go on clearance...and even then $5 is still too steep a price to pay for it.
B00005JLIU|1.0|This has got to be one of the top contenders for worst film ever made. Phoned-in acting from everyone, even the inimitable Bea Lillie. (And one has to go a long way to make her look bad) There is basically no script, no arc, no character development - it is simply a morose series of very tired gags that consistently fall flat. One can't even look at this as a spoof because spoofs by their very nature must be intelligent and clever comments on the real. What an obscene waste of money and talent. If you enjoy this film, you must either have an IQ of less than 30 or be dead.
0802473156|5.0|I would highly recommend this book to anyone whether or not you are having marital issues,it is so helpful in everyday life. others were reading it when i was and they loved it too.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|It's a little short, I beat it across a week playing for an hour or so at a time.  I wish there was more replay value other than reset the entire cache.  But still one of the best $1.99 I have spent on a game.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|If you love the series this is a must have!! I love Dean and Sam in all their adventures it is awesome.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|I went into this game not knowing what to expect and I was blown away! The story for 999 is absolutely fantastic and made never want to put the game down. Characters are well-fleshed out and are interesting too. However, due to the fact that you have to replay levels constantly, it does get a bit repetitive. I will recommend this game to everyone who loves a good story in their games.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|a game very much like candy crush, would have hoped to have a little more variation as the days go forward to 80
B006LSZECO|5.0|Since the story has been well covered by other reviewers, I won't rehash it here.  Why I liked this book so much is the twists and turns.  Not only in the story itself, but also in the minds of the two main players Nick and Amy.  The reader gets into the heads of both of them and this reveals how many psychological issues they both have, Amy more so than Nick.  The multiple monickers Amy gives herself is a nice touch....Amazing Amy, Diary Amy, Ozark Amy and so on.  Can you say schizophrenia?<br /><br />The complaints about the ending being a let down are unjustified IMO.  While there is no complete conclusion where a bad guy gets his or her due, it was enough to make me draw a conclusion and still leave enough open that if there is a sequel, it will be worth reading.  Loved this book.
B000HF6XV8|5.0|prompt delivery, perfect condition, beautiful edition.  Am using this to inspire a group of children to build their own garden.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This may get challenging but this is a awesome game for kids and up...I agree cause my kids play this and they love it.
B00683JK9K|4.0|Love this.  It has different ways the puzzle can be divided.  Three differnt number of pieces allowed and one option is to turn the piece so that they are not in the right order.  I just wish they had more puzzles.  The good thing is you can do the puzzles more than once by changing the number of pieces you want to work with.  Because I liked this, I looked for more free apss for jigsaw puzzles.
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|Really entertaining story.  Completely unique twist on traditional characters and good enough parents can watch without getting bored. Highly endorse this movie
B00BG08FKK|5.0|I love this CD colllection even thought mine apparentaly has two blips in it.  Not sure if it is the CD or the player causing the dip.  After seeing the movie, I just had to have this.  Delivery was on time with great packaging.  Definitely worth the price.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Love the game it's very addictive, would be happier if it quit freezing in friend village and quit erasing all my friends, besides that problem I love the game.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Love this because it has lots of puzzle options.  Again love than you can choose how many pieces to work with.  However, I do find the ones with really dark pieces are difficult to see.  Those puzzles would be better if the background was lighter.  I got this because of another Magic Puzzle app I have.  I also have a problem when I try to open it.  It goes to a blank page and I have to hit the return button so I can choose the puzzle and number of pieces.
B0039HR5QS|4.0|I can only imagine what a present-day version of this movie would be like after a few more decades of the banal & morally corrupt world machinations of the so-called Intelligence communities.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|I  watched this movie with  my  son and he really enjoyed it. I  Also  enjoyed it though as it  was a classic from my  childhood aswell.<br />The acting , the story  are all great.<br /> I  could honestly watch  this movie many  more times and that's a rare quality for movies.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This is great book series and this book just answered a lot if questions and gears you up for the next and final book.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It takes some skill to play this.  It is addictive and fun for the entire family.  Many, many levels for all to enjoy.
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|Celine Dion is probably the best entertainer Vegas has ever showcased, and that includes Elvis!  I don't know of anyone who can match her.
B00881VLCE|3.0|I think this is a game that young children would enjoy playing.  It is simple enough for even a very young child.
B003ASLJS6|5.0|My husband and I LOVE THIS MOVIE and have watched it at least ten times.  Can't get enough of Clint and his classic lines.  This is Eastwood at his best!!
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Great story, a must see film to judge for yourself. watch it! well made film must see story ok?. k
B0018QOIXU|5.0|Best new singer to come along in years!  I bought this because I'd never heard of Adele but kept hearing from others how good she was.  Then I heard one of her songs one day over loud speakers while shopping and understood why everyone said she's really good.  I loved her music, and having her sing the theme song for Skyfall couldn't have been a better choice!
B00B7FWWNA|5.0|this was a great piece of work by Helen Hunt. on a personal level she showed great bravery in doing this film. the film itself was very sensitive sympathetic and empathic. on a personal level I was very moved by this<br />movie. this movie should stir everyone's humanity and selflessness. Helen it was simply wonderful!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Best setting, best writing, best story-line, best acting, best everything!!  I like this entire series so much  - all 3 seasons - that I bought two more sets for my sisters!
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|I'm not a big gamer but I have a new Android and when I saw this game featured as a free app I thought I'd try it.  Unlike another free game I have this one has clear instructions on how to play and is very intuitive, so you can start playing immediately and don't have a big learning curve.  At the same time Osmos provides an increasing challenge as you move up the levels.  Its lots of fun to play, too, and the graphics are kind of fabulous. Osmos HD is a nice way to pass a few minutes if you're waiting in line or sitting in a waiting room...the minutes disappear while you feed your little Osmos and help it become the biggest sphere in the universe.  Finally something that can eat and get bigger without having to worry about obesity and dieting! A fat Osmos is a strong Osmos.
B009KY0TE4|5.0|This music takes you into another realm.  Cheers to 50 years of James Bond and to the best theme song of any of the Bond movies!
B007L5GDGW|3.0|I can't complain about this game because 1) it has a lot of nice visual and sound features, and 2) I downloaded it for free.  However I took a while to figure out how to play it.  There may be instructions somewhere but I don't know where they are, or perhaps they aren't on the free version.  I think you need to tilt your phone or tablet to move the marble....tapping the screen sure doesn't work. I still haven't managed to keep the marple on the highway in space, but at least it makes a nice fireworks display when it falls off.  Sorry marble!  Good thing it doesn't yell when it goes flying off into space, or I'd have a ulcer by now.  If you're more of a techie than me this game may present a nice challenge right from the first, but not being a big gamer myself I get a little frustrated with it because success, so far, seems unattainable.
B000J5XS3C|5.0|I just got back into DJ gigs, starting from scratch. When setting up my base system I found this mixer. So far I have been impressed. I am using it in conjunction with [[ASIN:B00BFJ3PM0 MUSYSIC 2 Channel 2000 Watts Professional Power DJ Amplifier With USB Slot 2U Rack Mount Amp Stereo]]... and they have been worth the buy!
B000SEGTI0|5.0|A great read. Hard to put down. Loved Bladerunner and I am equally pleased with this story. Along with the core of the story You can find many of the themes from Bladerunner in this, but you also get so many more layers and PKD's maniac view of the future is captivating.
B009KEN87O|5.0|As an old school Space Invaders and Asteroids gamer I have to say this rocks and improves on these game experiences! I got it as the free app of the day but would have paid for this one. Definitely worth it!
B007REV4T8|5.0|My husband loves this newest James Bond film! It certainly lives up to all the action and excitement of previous movies in the franchise!
B008Q00I2Q|5.0|It was a great movie for me. Itkept me in the movie wanting to know what was going to happenihg next.. PG13
B005ZHBA9I|5.0|love it, beautiful just like the rest.  people can say what they want about the movies, but the music is phenomenal
1932735410|4.0|Easy to read, clear explanations and in some parts it is even interesting! However, this book could be at least 10 pages shorter if you take away the annoying phrases like \\"if you do not have real-world experience with the topic such and this... you might be in trouble because you have a serous gaps in your knowledge\\". This book is really full of them. I personally think they should not be there. Yes, I do not have real-world experience in using many tools described in the book. But who would need a book if he had real-world experience in every aspect of the project management described in PMBOK?
B0067TQQI8|5.0|Very happy with my purchase. Charges ipad and iPhone simultaneously and keeps on going without a recharge! Better than I had hoped.
B0018RC7QE|1.0|Because of the actors, I mistakenly thought this movie had potential. What a waste of 1 hour and 46 minutes. I kept thinking it would get better, trust me, it doesn't.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Excellent because of the upgrade to cyberwarfare, including many of its intricacies. Threat Vector not only keeps up but outdistances all comers!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|fun and enjoyable! makes time fly. i grew up playing mario on good ole nintendo.this game is similar fun! try it!
B000000XBC|5.0|This cd with the Chronicle Vol. 1 and I have all the CCR I need. Makes me thinks about the good days.
B0000844I8|5.0|Fun Classic, the story is sorta interesting but quite comical to ridiculous. Certainly as believable as a lot of the stuff on Star Wars. I think the who leaping across the galaxy thing a little lame but it still has its moments. Anyway if you want a fun classic scifi fantasy show this is OK. If you want something really horrendous to watch go find reruns of Say Yes to the Dress. The 'guy' that hosts that will make Aman Ra look like Stallone.
B000000XB9|5.0|This cd and the Chronicle vol 2 I have all the CCR I need to remind me of a great time
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|The Hobbit, What Did I Think, You Gotta Be kidding me. The was a great movie, highly entertaining. I was quite concerned because it could have very easily been a big let down. The cast was great, the special affects top shelf. There were however a couple of moments that were a let down. The stone giants... and nobody gets killed or even injured, come on! Then the scene when Galdalf is explaining to Bilbo who he was, was really awkward. There was a very brief moment that to me made me want to cheer. It's when the little old dwarf was putting it on the Goblins, FANTASTIC. Made me want to jump in the battle and help him. So get this movie and enjoy.
B0037DGH4A|5.0|Classic Santana - you can feel it. Smooth is the best. All of it great! Do I need say more?  .bwj...
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I had a friend who kept asking my to play the angry birds on her phone but I did not see it well enough so when I got my kindle I found out how addicting the game is trying to pass all levels with the most stars!!
B00A81MV3U|5.0|Update: I got the dvd and I loved all the deleted scenes, there were at least 20 of them . There's also a documentary sort of thing which is like 29 minutes long and was a nice insider view to the thoughts of the director, the book writer and the cast.<br /><br />I saw the film first, it was brilliant and I absolutely loved it so I figured I should read the book. I'll say this right now,  the book and movie are really different.  Many details and bigger plot points are changed. All that being said, the film was better.<br /><br />Jennifer Lawrence did an outstanding job as Tiffany Maxwell she STOLE every scene. At the same time, Bradley Cooper was amazing (I'm not even a Cooper fan, his movies are OK)  and he was also a scene Stealer. When they were in scenes together? Yes you can bet it was great chemistry.  Jacki Weaver ad Robert DeNiro had a great dynamic,  Chris Tucker added some very good comedic relief.  This film speaks on love and truth, and working hard, staying positive so that one day you might reach your silver lining.
B0086700CM|1.0|my husband actually downloaded this game to my kindle but did not like it.  He did not realize the type of game it was and unfortunately deleted it
B00785P2QC|5.0|Thud game gave me an experience to have my very own city. This is a very very very very very very very very foolproof game
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this app play all the time. Never have any problems. If you like plain solidarity this is for you.
B004R2HGT0|5.0|If you are a fan of 80s thrash metal then this is an easy choice for you.. The New Order is a masterpiece..This is their best album.. Testament helped create the thrash metal scene in the mid 80s... They never received the glory and fame that Metallica, and Anthrax got but they are every bit as good, and some may argue that they are better..I've had the cd for 22 years and just bought the 180 gram vinyl version.. I highly recommend the vinyl (remastered) version..
B005K17RU0|5.0|Really like this app. The satellite maps are great for all my locations I'm following. Nice extended forecast. Works great on kindle fire he.
B0085FF55W|5.0|I heard Hero on KROQ a few months ago and have been hooked ever since. The entire album is amazing. These guys are so talented I feel as if I'm listening to the next great band.  My favorites on Stairs, Hero, St Croix and Diversity.
B005LAIHR2|4.0|Rock of Ages is a fantastic musical.  Well... admittedly it was pretty rough viewing material for the first hour- nothing really memorable occurs other than the music being performed of course.  But from a storyline point of view the first hour is pretty lackluster.<br /><br />The truth is however, if you love 80's rock -especially the hair metal movement- you will unquestionably admire what Rock of Ages presents.  A few flaws appear occasionally such as everything Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand do together- horrendous writing that I don't even need to comment on, haha.  I like how the women -especially Julianne Hough and Catherine Zeta-Jones- are INCREDIBLY attractive!<br /><br />Perhaps a little heavy on the Foreigner material, though the trading back and forth of \\"Juke Box Hero\\" and Joan Jets \\"I Love Rock 'n Roll\\" is a nice addition.  As is \\"I Want to Know What Love Is\\" starring Tom Cruise resembling Alice Cooper both personality and appearance-wise.  I imagine that's completely unintentional but I could be wrong.  A lot of the stuff in between all the singing and dancing is total fluff however, especially during the first hour.  It's not really a consistently compelling musical which separates it from, say, Grease.  Yes I know- Grease was released in the 70's and features an entirely different type of rock, but the singing and dancing is why I'm mainly comparing the two here.<br /><br />Catherine Zeta-Jones plays the role of a leader protesting a movement against all the negatives associated with rock music.  This is a highlight.  However there's a couple lows that make me drag the overall rating down 1 star.  First, the boy band segment later on.  One of the rock stars (played by Diego Boneta) eventually sells out and joins a rock band.  This stuff has no real reason to be included in a movie that should most certainly be centered around rock and roll.  And the presence of a pet baboon is awkward and unnecessary.<br /><br />Besides Foreigner, if you like Poison, Def Leppard, Guns 'n Roses, Journey, Pat Benatar and REO Speedwagon in particular, you can expect these bands to dominate the majority of hair metal acts featured in Rock of Ages.  Somewhat limited with just these selections I believe since the 80's presented a LOT more depth than this, but there you have it.  Also, I was inclined to think Rock of Ages would focus more on the heavier metal acts judging by the commercials, but not so much.<br /><br />A good musica, some creative singing and dancing with a few songs (Pat Benatar's \\"Shadows of the Night\\" and \\"Hit Me With Your Best Shot\\" being highlights from a creative perspective) but expect the stuff in between the singing and dancing to feel tacky and sometimes boring.
B0043VDIAG|3.0|Another great Nicholas Sparks read. This book didn't have the tear jerking big ending that most of his books have.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|I found it a bit difficult to find the hidden objects without zooming in and sometimes it was hard to figure out what to do next but all in all this is a great game.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|At times crude but its an Apatow movie so that's to be expected. Manages to pull it all together into a funny/ sweet/ awkward/ frustrations of life/aging package. Surprised by all of the haters on here.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|The acting was superb...better than I was expecting!  I have always loved the story and music of Les Mis but this rendition,especially Ann Hathaways performance, was very moving!
B004DTLK62|5.0|SUPERB FILM..with HD AUDIO...The main lead, Robert Downey Jr was amazing with his performance and truly lived the character. This is a gem of a movie to be cherished among the Blu ray collection... :)
B007R0WHMK|4.0|Somehow I knew the main character, Grenouille, would be different in the movie than I imagined while reading the book.  In my mind I envisioned someone more hideous in appearance.  However, that would have made him blend in with society even less.  The nugget of truth that I personally gleaned from the story itself, is how in the perfect world a person with olfactory genius like Grenouille would be able to rise to the top as a perfumer.  But, as in real life, some genius is used for evil instead of good due to poor choice, mental illness or other circumstances.  The story was something different!
B003IDMUWC|4.0|This book is a must read for Grisham fans like myself. Works as expected on kindle app on iPad. Cheers
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Mind bender.....or sleep inducer???! Either way this game is addictive! The haunting music lulls me to sleep......but I can't resist playing JUST ONE MORE GAME!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i really like this game but its not the same ad the first one but thts ok because its easier to get to a mllion my name is Steven2nd
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Wonderful tv. Engaging characters and stories set in 1890s when times were changing from primarily agriculture to industry and rights for women were emerging.
B008Y73940|5.0|wonderful movie with Matthew McConaughey!<br />if you like him in his other movies you will love this one, much better than The Paperboy, that was lousy!
B009EHDU7U|4.0|As a person in his senior years, I have to applause the author for his 'guts' in writing some of this book. Yes, us older folk want to take part in life, but also be allowed time to think of 'the good old days'.<br />Be careful that the acceptance of older people does not always extend to mirth as we too care of what others think of us.<br />In general, this book did not go too far and kept within the realms of respect for the old man.<br />Yes, I enjoyed the read, but it did drag on a bit in the final parts.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Fun for passing time.  As with any game, as the levels get higher you have to pay more attention as to how you solve the puzzel.  Makes your mind work.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Wonderful movie all my sons have one now. They were very happy with the movie also. Very touching movie for my family.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great app, can change locations easily.  Acurate, easy to use.  Graphics are good.  Nice to take this with me when we are traveling or when expecting changeable weather.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Own all of them out right now. Our favorite show. Waiting for Season 5 to come out  plan to purchase it also !
B00BWJARHO|4.0|The black lines to make the wide screen effect where so big it turned my 50&#34; into a 30&#34;. If I knew those where going to be there I would not of rented it. It is a good movie though.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I have read several near death experience accounts. This one was fascinating given the author's scientific, medical background and his therefore very methodical, detailed approach to describing heaven and our heavenly Father. I didn't care for some of his descriptions such as Core, but such terms gave a clear understanding that his experience was absolutely indescribable in earthly terms...making it all that more credible to me.
B006LSZECO|3.0|really thought this novel was going to be better than it turned out to be. Easy to figure out his wife was framing him and very disappointed in the ending.
B0051UH6W4|1.0|Appallingly written, so many unnecessary &#34;tricks&#34; with language.  Gave up after a third way through.  A waste of several good trees! Cannot fathom why it ever won any prize at all!
B009KEN87O|5.0|Good variety in the levels and fun options. Plenty of opponents and challenges. A good free app of the day
B00985E3UG|4.0|Seems to back up all it's claims, and the truth is pretty self evident in our society. His claims have opened my eyes even more about how we are manipulated about so many things. Must read for those concerned about health, for themselves and society as a whole.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Loved this book as a young girl. And it has been such a delight to read it again as an adult. It reminds us of how life should be lived!
B0079XPUOW|5.0|This is the first novel I have read by John Scalzi, and I can say that I will be reading more of his work. This was not simply a wildly entertaining parody of Lost In Space, as the title suggests, (okay, maybe not that particular show), but it was also a very well written and original story with plenty of twists to keep you interested, and yes, I realize this is one really long run-on sentence! You will not be disappointed with this book.  Buy it. Love it. Ignore your friends at Starbucks while you read it on your tablet pretending to be interested in what they're saying. And no, I am not on John Scalzi's payroll! LOL
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Such a relief from the violence and thrill chasing dramas. An entertaining look at an earlier day. We save each episode for an end of our day treat.
B009KEN87O|5.0|I usually don't rate apps but this one deserves a 5 star rating. Fun and challenging with good graphics and effects
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This was such a great book I read it in one day could not put it down hope movie is just as good
B006PERRMY|4.0|In Time<br />Very entertaining and interesting storyline.  I would recommend it, but don't expect a heavy plot or great visuals.
B0097EWK3A|3.0|This isn't one of the best HOG's I've played but certainly not the worst.  It seems like a pretty good game, though I've only been through the one hour trial.  You see, though it is sold as free here, it appears you have to unlock it to continue playing it after an hour or so, and the price is $2.99, which isn't bad.  But, I've already purchased the game for my PC - why would I want to purchase it twice?  I'd give it 4 stars as a game, and subtract a star for making it falsely appear that it is free.  I would say it is worth the $2.99 they're asking for it though.  Have fun gaming!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Mr. Martel, if you should  read this ... I cannot thank you enough for writing such an incredibly inspiring novel. Truly I will never forget it.<br />I Thank God for your genius and talent. I thank You for using these gifts.<br />Most sincerely,<br /> Madeline Julia Serrano<br />North Carolina USA
B000003CMB|5.0|Worth the price of the CD just to listen to Duane on &#34;Whipping Post&#34;.  Having heard the later versions without Duane, I realized he was irreplaceable. Other versions of the song are good.  This version left me in awe.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Amazing show!  I love watching the characters develop!  My favorite characters are Daryl and Carol!  The Rick and Governor show down is going to be explosive!
B0056BMK6K|3.0|After reading and using Deb Shenkle's &#34;How To Self-Publish A Kindle Book, A Step-By-Step Guide&#34; (Highly recommended!) to publish my first book, I decided I needed more help with marketing. Shenkle's book is a great step-by-step guide for novices in creating their ebook. I read several books to help me learn to market my ebooks, and found John Locke's to be ok, but not the leader of the pack. I am sure he knows what he is doing to help himself sell lots of books, but I felt there was an absence of concrete, pragmatic steps for the novice ebook writer/promotor. I got the feeling that Mr. Locke was holding back the particulars of some of his own strategies while cleverly marketing himself and his book. Just my opinion...<br /><br />Maurice
B005I6EU7U|5.0|This cover is great. It is very soft leather and feels great when you hold it. The cover was a little tight at first but after using it for a month it fits great.  I love how the cover looks like a antique book!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like playing this game.  It is very interactive.  It is worth buying.  Great game to occupy your time during commute.
B00B19DMUE|4.0|The Possession is a true story about a box that when open takes over the life of the person that opens it, and jeopardizes the lives of others around that person when the evil acts are released upon them a true horror flick.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|it requires some thought and concentration but it is simple and easy to play.  Great game to occupy your time during commute.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|Supper fun and very affordable to!!!  So many new things to do and get every time, I think that this game everyone should get.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I am a huge fan of horse's and I honestly love this app! It's so life like! Best of all it's free. The horses are cute, I just love this game! I would recommend this app for horse lover's.
B003OCFJ7U|5.0|With 119 reviews about this movie already written, I'm not going to describe the plot since I'm sure it's been covered.  I will say that I don't mind the heavy metal soundtrack at all.  Nothing wrong with Goblin, but I also like Iron Maiden.  If you like Bruce Dickinson/Iron Maiden, you'll do fine.  Ignore the complaints about the soundtrack.  I just wish the high-end wasn't rolled-off on the English soundtrack. It sounds clearer on the Italian soundtrack.<br /><br />I am comparing this with the first Anchor Bay release being sold for $39 on here now (Egads!)  The video quality on this Blu-Ray is much improved over the old non-anamorphic Anchor Bay version.  HOWEVER, the Blu-Ray dropped the 5.1 surround sound, and we are only left with stereo.  More importantly, the Blu-Ray also dropped the commentary track!!  This was a major disappointment for me, and means that now I must hold onto my DVD (which is apparently getting rare now, anyway).  It also drops the 3 music videos, which I didn't care that much about but were nice to have.  IT ALSO drops the Dario Argento interview on the Joe Franklin show!  Even if that interview wasn't anything spectacular, it's still Dario Argento being interviewed on an American television show, and therefore a piece of history worth keeping.  Most Americans still don't know who Dario Argento is.  There's so much room on Blu-Ray I'm sure they could have fit compressed versions of the other extras on this.<br /><br />The 5 stars is for the movie itself, and for being able to watch a young Jennifer Connelly in a movie that most people who aren't fans of the genre will never even have heard of.  Kudos to Jennifer and Donald Pleasence for taking on these roles!<br /><br />To the reviewer who complained that Jennifer's name in the movie is \\"Jennifer\\"... are you mad?!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|So many times when you're &#34;almost there&#34; you want to stay with it just for the promise of a coin cascade.  Can see why it's a popular arcade game.
B002N44XSG|5.0|It was a great inside look of anything you need t o know. It helped explain a lot of loose ends. Even so this was my third time reading this book. The mini stories are a fun read. I also love the graphics I n the book. Gives you a inside look of what everything should look like.
B00498YZH8|4.0|This was a great movie, every touching. The young actress did a great job. In fact the entire cast was wonderful. Desired the awards it go
B0054SMIH6|4.0|There's a good cast and it is worth watching if you have time on your hands and are lookjing for a good story..

B0053TMP24|5.0|READ READ READ READ! READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!! THE BEST BOOK IN THE WORLD!!!!!! I HATE the 13 word thingy p p p
B003LQ3YXU|3.0|Probably plays better in the UK.  More words, more words, more words, more words more words, more words, more words.
B000GCFO08|5.0|Great movie .... although its not very scary but I had enjoyed the movie as it is. I like the scenery , the back ground , the actors and acting, the music theme and sound effects and the mystery in this movie. In fact I like every thing about this movie! Right now I got my Silent Hill collections in bluray and dvd. In my opinion I think this movie is worth buying and I would watch this movie again and again if there aren't any thing good on t.v to watch haha.
B0067R0APK|5.0|No install or use problems on Kindle Fire. As accurate as AW web site.<br />Recommended to keep up to date anywhere.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My husband and I didn't start watching this series until after Season 3 started. It was great to be able to watch 1-2 shows an evening to catch up. Highly recommend watching this.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|COMPELING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! COULD NOT STOP WATCHING IT.  BEST SERIES ON TV,  CAN'T WAIT FOR NEXT SEASON.  THE CHARACTERS BECOME PART OF YOU.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is a good game to fill time while waiting for appts, or in line. Not too hard to play.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I LOVED THE CHARACTERS. I LOVED THE STORYLINE. I COULD WATCH IT DAILY IF IT WERE POSSIBLE.  IT WAS BRILLIANTLY ACTED..............................
B00B99KJR0|3.0|This is a nice game. However, it does not have the flexability of Atlantis in that you can not choose as many options such as switching tokens choosing when to take more time.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|The wife and I love Big Bang Theory, it's a funny show. We're techie kind of folks and can relate to a lot of the 'fish out of water' situations they get themselves into.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|You are never bored reading this book. The two lives that are written about are always in turmoil. It gives an excellent perspective on OCD and abusive relationships.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|My wife and I love to watch Castle! It's a great show with both enough comedy and drama to keep you coming back for more.
B006IYG5HE|3.0|This is my first Harry Hole book.  Not bad once you understand the format. Keeping the story threads straight was a challenge for awhile but I enjoyed the twists and turns. So I will read another in the series before passing judgement.
B005H1SDQU|5.0|To my ear Steve Hackett is amongst the most talented guitarists/sonwriters of all-time. His catalogue is diverse and he touches on many different genres of music in it. On this release Steve combines his abilities and delivers a mostly progressive rock recording which is stellar throughout. There is a great deal of music contained and it is all incredible.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The book was great! And so was the option to use it on kindle. Reading it on the go was the best.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I love this movie! Fun and videogame freaks like me love cameo appearances from all star game characters. This movie is called sugar rush in the Japan version.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This is a great movie that both kids and parents can enjoy together!  My husband and I were cracking up and so was our son!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I loved the style of writing. A great autobiography. I've read a lot of  books in this genre but haven't seen such participation from the spouse in the book. I enjoyed Taya's writing and feel like her contributions brought a great element. A good book from a true Patriot.
B002RVCD6O|4.0|Standard Harry Potter fare, but it you like the genre, you'll enjoy the movie.  Overall an enjoyable escape and fairly true to the book.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|It was a great story, educational, suspenseful, enjoyed it very much, will have to rent it again when my grandchild come over so they can watch it. Thank you
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Really enjoyed this book!  Read the review for this book in the Sunday paper and thought I would give it a try.  Am I glad I did!  Totally outside my usual type of book, but a true review of the conflicts of nature and nurture and how you are perceived.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|i try to follow all of his writings, as i am from the same regions that he sometimes writes about.  did not like Calico Joe, though.
B002XSP16A|5.0|Yes, you need seven words for a review when there are not more words that come up for me why
B0074VA2T2|5.0|Much better than I expected. Too young for my son, but I got it anyway because I love Eric Carle and wanted to check it out. I like the different levels to choose from and recommend this to anyone with a preschool-K child.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|What do you need seven words to do a review. It was fine. Why do you need seven more words?
B0032SQCQI|1.0|Just watch it for yourself... indescribable how bad this movie is. Interesting story line taken the most idiotic direction. I could produce a better movie.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|Interesting reading material.  I even learned some new things about the country India and the people who live there.  A vocabulary list of words at the end of the book.
B000Z27HLS|5.0|Love to watch all Jane Austin movies JJ Feild did a good job and just enjoy that period of time
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Such an easy read.  Loved the relationships and the surprised revelations that bond them together.  I will recommend this book to others.
B007UWBQEU|5.0|One of her best in a long time but I love listening to her no matter what she sings but that's only my opinion.
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|Oh, here is a remarkable presentation of sexuality without &#34;being sexy&#34; about it.  Mark O'Brien (from a true story played by John Hawkes) leaks that lovely honesty that allows self-awareness to flower.  I don't know how I dare admit it, but I shared this movie with a friend the other night, and then watched it again the very next night--having already seen it at least 4 times!  I guess I'm one of the &#34;beautiful women&#34; who succumbed to the outright beauty of the man himself (women who show up at his funeral at movie's end).  The Mark John Hawkes gave us is simultaneously chld-like, masterfully self-aware right from the get-go--(no doubt from the journaling and poetry he'd mastered, even from an iron lung)--easily self-mocking, easily able to seek the friendship of a priest who will sanction his pursuit of a very, very difficult goal.  Mark, &#34;a Polio,&#34; has the opportunity to seek the services of a &#34;Sexual Surrogate.&#34;  So, though he &#34;appears&#34; a simple man, John Hawkes' appropriation of him shows a complexity that continues to draw me back and back. And adding to that, the excellent presence in this story of three caretakers brings us especially Rod and Vera, who were also shown with stellar ability to be in the present and simply accepting of Mark's dependencies, while wholly aware of his &#34;personhood,&#34;  These all just puff this movie bigger and bigger.  Vera--who's initial appearance is shown as being reservedly assessing---just grows and grows into an inveterate side-kick--a beautifully sound compadre to &#34;have one's back.&#34;<br /><br />As much as I've watched this movie now, the more critical I become of the sex therapist, Cheryl, whom Helen Hunt actually quite superbly renders. It is not at all clear why she became so wrapped up in him (but she does).  I wish they'd had time to show her in therapeutic relation with anybody else--to put in perspective the fact that she was a pro in this business.  That is to say, she exposed herself to the risks of sexual bonding in a clinical fashion over and over again.  I know this is a separate issue beyond what the movie could take on, but even one scene with her with one other client, coming or going, or going to bed with hubby following some other day with a client--or for that matter, having to shift hats and enter into real sexuality with her husband--whom I read as a really nice guy--and appropriately adult and real!), would have helped us see what in Mark undid her so.<br /><br />But this is a movie not only to see, but to own.  You are, after all, going to want to drink it in multiple times.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I can always count on some quirky fun with this show.  I think it has gotten better with age and look forward to upcoming seasons.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|The story line of Brave is so rich and deep in meaning.  I love the Celtic setting and the fact that a woman is in a non-traditional light - she is her own person seeking out her own personal story.  A great story for every woman and young girl to watch to find their &#34;inner brave.&#34;
B006Z9SP3E|4.0|Need I say more? The story continues, and we read how the war affected all those involved. Left on a cliff hangar, thankfully the third book came out two days after I finished this one.

B008WCP2PG|5.0|Definitely more serious than I thought but a good insight to the dark side of male entertainment. Well acted and good looking cast.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I am still reading it but so far it is a very good read. Interesting story about an astronaut mistakenly left behind on Mars by his crew.
B004YXE438|4.0|Since I like to do jigsaw puzzles, I thought that this game would be fun. I was right. Even though the shapes are only square, it is still a challenge to do.
B003NRYMZQ|1.0|This is a sorry excuse for science fiction. Its subtle political agenda is really sad. Send this back to Britain.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is one awesome game I love it I posy it all day long it is the best game ever
B00BHMETKC|1.0|This movie is not worth watching. It takes a tragic event in our history and tries to call it entertainment.
B000FCKPHG|5.0|I liked this book.  The main idea is that the process of work/creating is more important to our development than the finished product.  The author explained this theory very well.  I wish I had read it while I was still teaching, as it would have given me another way to help my students.  Now I want to apply this idea to my interactions with my grandchildren - and myself!
B00BMUYLSE|3.0|Despite the hype, I think this is another treadwater outing for Bowie.  Great production, but not much innovation.  Lackluster song writing.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|If you have read the first instalment ~ Continue ~ Its better on kindle as the book is huge ~ 6*
B0088P2A7A|4.0|I always love having the Wikipedia app handy. Really makes finding information about something easy when I just happen to see something I don't know a lot about.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I bought this for my wife, who read the first four books and loves this one. It's the right combination of fantasy, plausible historical setting, conflict and character development. Probably not something to keep on the shelf for future reference, so a good choice for Kindle.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This is a crazy addictive game that just keeps pulling me in. It's simple enough to learn, but there is enough depth to keep you interested. One of the best tablet games I've ever played.
B007N6NGYG|4.0|A fun little game,  really a visual puzzle solving game,  reminds me of angry birds,  but you have to get your trains to the correct station.
B008M87GJK|5.0|I love having quick and easy access to the BBC news with this app. Makes it very easy for me to keep informed about worldly events.
B00890JFMW|4.0|I like to listen soft music especially in the morning. This one is one of them. It contains very soft and very nice music and I recommend you to buy.
B0097PW7H8|5.0|This is a really useful app. Great for letting you know exactly how long your battery life has left and lets you easily shut things down to extend life.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love love love this game,  very fun, entertaining and keeps you going back for more.  The price was free.
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|This album exceeds expectations. JT is back. This album is full of soul, much like the music of the 70's. Timberlake brings a history of music to a new generation.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I saw Zero Dark Thirty and all it did was leave wanting to know more about the Seals. The movie was ok but missed a huge opportunity to cover the Seals.<br />This book filled that gap. Your halfway through this book on the Seals before it shifts focus on the UBL compound raid - perfect. Well written and fast moving, a very credible no BS firsthand account from an American asset and patriot.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|A little mystery tied in with some suspense and love. Nicholas Sparks has done it again! This is a  great story!
B0090P98Z4|5.0|Great dungeon crawler having a good time playing it so far. Im glad i downloaded whooo hooo great graphics and sound
B00280LYIC|5.0|This was a out standing book and I can't wait to read the sea of monsters. I love this book❤
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I just started watching this again...and I love it even better this time...great director...keeps you intrigued the whole time! yep!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Great DVD, Season 3 was great, I think, it's rerun time...My family loves this sereis.Can't wait for the 4th season to start.
B0014DC0AK|5.0|Welcome me fellow metalheads. I now listen to Death Metal. This is my first time ever listening to Death. As a fan of thrash, and all forms of heavy metal, I can't get enough of these guys. Symbolic is the first death metal album I've ever purchased and I know I'm not a seasoned fan of death metal (yet) but I will state the obvious in this classic. Chuck Schuldiner is an animal on the guitar. His technical ability can hardly be compared to anyone else. Maybe Jeff Waters and a few others but this guy is in great company. His vocal performance is pretty brutal, and when compared with the melodic riffs it creates a different and unique listening experience. Gene Hoglan, one of the most underrated metal drummers. The guy has played with the likes of Dark Angel and Testament as of recently and is always doing some sort of different project. The bass is audible only on \\"Empty Words\\"(for the longest duration of time) and a few other spots on the album. I honestly believe this band combines the best attributes of metal in their whole career. From the brutality and gore of the first two albums that any horror movie fan like myself would love, to the technicality and progressive elements this band had going for them, Death is a band worthy of your music collection.<br /><br />I would recommend this album to anyone that has never listened to death metal, but has always been curious about a band to listen to. Death is that band. Symbolic isn't as brutal as I thought, its progressive, technical, and even melodic (check the end of Perrenial Quest) its crazy. Even though I am a newer fan of death metal I am getting Individual Thought Patterns soon as well as Sound Of Perseverance and I recomend you to do the same!
B008602KQI|5.0|Read the series, saw the Hunger Games in the theater, and thought the movie followed the book pretty well. Loved seeing it again. Can't wait for the 2nd movie in the series.
B000063COX|4.0|Iron Maiden's \\"Iron Maiden\\" is my personal favorite from the guys. Yes I like Killers, Powerslave, Piece Of Mind, and my second favorite, Somewhere In Time. This was the first Maiden album I bought along with Killers, I was hooked. Production is crisp, and pretty good for a debut. We start with \\"Prowler\\" (fans of catchy riffs this one is for you!) the lyrics are humerous to a degree and the drumming is pretty simple but keeps pace with the whole song. I've always liked Paul Di'Anno's vocals as much as Dickenson's. \\"Sanctuary\\" Catchy main riff and the chorus will have you hooked the first time you hear it. \\"Remember Tomorrow\\" Starts off slowly and then becomes a good fast paced track. One of the highlights of the album. \\"Running Free\\" Clive Burr (R.I.P) at his best on the album. Gets you hooked with the drum intro, guitars pull you in, and once Di Anno starts his performance, you can't skip the track. The backing vocals are higher pitched than his, which sort of off sets the song in a way, but they pull it off. \\"Phantom Of The Opera\\" One of the better known Maiden songs from this debut. Catchy and fast paced for this band. Personally, the vocals drag this track out longer than it should. Paul is inconsistent on this song with his changes in melody. But it is still a good track. \\"Transylvania\\" CATCHY!! One of my favorite instrumentals in all of music. There is power behind this track. \\"Strange World\\" reminds me of the previous track in its beginning (Remember Tomorrow) the solo at the beginning is a nice addition. And although it is never mentioned, the bass work is nicely composed as well. \\"Charlotte The Harlot\\" Upbeat, fun, and catchy. Paul's vocals are spot on great here. But the last track and the title track are the best on the album. \\"Iron Maiden\\" The riff is catchy like Prowler and Transylvania. The lyrics are dark and sadistic but the way the guys play this song makes it upbeat, and catchy. And once again, the bass is noticable and has a great part in the song. It is the best way to end this classic.<br /><br />I ranked this at four star, and although it is my personal favorite, production is better on Killers and other albums have the more famous or better known material. Compared to other albums this doesn't necessarily stack up to their better known classics but I'm going to defend and root for my personal favorite. If you like different genres of music other than metal and rock, give Maiden a chance. I have a bunch of \\"Die Hard\\" friends that listen to rap and other stuff but love Iron Maiden. Their melody, catchy riffs, and powerful front man should have you wanting more. If thats the case...make the transition to Killers..

B00992CF6W|2.0|I love the game of minecraft and I was ecstatic to see that it was available on the kindle fire. however, after I purchased it, it was not able to be installed. I am curious to know if anyone else had this problem with installing minecraft.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|What I love: a) lets me monitor multiple locations.  b) gives all the weather info in concise terms with helpful graphics.  c) always works...never crashed or had probe in 4 weeks of use.  Awesome app...highly recommend!
B007THA4FI|3.0|The book started out rough with a complicated character list but once you got to know them it got interesting.
0385349947|4.0|This was a fun, interesting and very quick read for me. This may be a bit of a long review, but I wanted to note all the positive and negative points that I found throughout my reading:<br /><br />The good:<br />I really like Sheryl (in that \\"I don't know this 'celebrity', but I feel like I like her anyways\\" kind of way). She seems personable, and exactly the kind of boss I'd love to work with - someone who wants and values VERY hardworking employees who are striving to build successful careers, but who also appreciates that people have lives outside of the office.<br /><br />Her writing flows nicely, the pages turn quickly and you don't get bored reading this book.<br /><br />The books was very thought-provoking for me. I felt totally inspired reading it....and yet I broke down in tears when I finished, as I also felt like I had a very tough road ahead, trying to 'balance' my personal and professional life. I recently passed up a huge career opportunity because I didn't think I could balance the new position with my family obligations, even though my spouse was so supportive. I've felt at peace with my decision, but reading this book made me wonder whether I hadn't made the wrong decision after all. That stung!<br /><br />I like so many of the anecdotes that Sandberg employs throughout the book. They bring her ideas to life. I especially appreciated the portion of the book where she discussed mentorship. She really helped me learn what a real mentor/apprentice relationship should look like. After reading her book, I realize that I had unrealistic and unproductive ideas about how to land a great mentor and how to maximize the benefits of the relationships for both of us. What a great lesson to learn!<br /><br />Lastly, I want to touch upon some of the criticism this book has been receiving. Many have noted that Sandberg is 'out of touch' with so many working women, who are too busy trying to make ends meet to really worry about some of the loftier goals she discusses in the book. I think that's a very unfair criticism. While it's true that many women would not find Sandberg's material relevant to their careers, there are hundreds of thousands of others who are in the same boat as Sandberg and who could benefit hugely from her advice. You can't please everyone when you're giving business advice. One book can't be used to advise the back room stock boy and the CEO at the same time. Just because lower-income, blue collar employees may not see themselves in the examples, doesn't mean the book is worthless. There are so many people who live the life she describes. What's wrong with having a book for us?!<br /><br />The 'bad':<br />Ok, there's nothing really terrible about this book. I should probably call this section \\"the somewhat disappointing\\". If you're a Sandberg fan, as I am, you've likely watched many of her speeches on YouTube. If so, you'll find many (if not most) of the stories, ideas and examples have been taken directly from these speeches (sometimes word for word) and put in the book. If you haven't seen the videos of the speeches, then this won't be a problem for you, as it'll all be new stuff. But for many readers, I imagine they'll be a bit of a let down by how much of it is repetitive.<br /><br />Am I glad I read this books? Yes. Was it as superb as I expected? No, unfortunately not. Would I recommend it? Yes, I would. In fact, I will likely read it again, as I've set up my own one-time book club with other professional women n my community who want to read and discuss the book. I think Sandberg's book will be an amazing platform from which to launch interesting discussions about how to improve our lives and careers. I look forward to reading the book again, drawing out interesting statistics and ideas, and discussing them with women like myself!
B004Z2TUGE|1.0|The movie was to dark. All the action scences happened at night which made it difficult to follow when the aliens were getting their butts kicked.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|I REALLY LIKE THIS GAME. especialy the lizzerd battle<br />.PLEEZE TRY THIS GAME its anazeing try it out you'll like it<br />also I give this game a 20
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. Denzel kept you guessing throughout the movie what he was going to do next. The plane crash scene was amazingly realistic.
B00498YZH8|5.0|I felt like I'd just entered the life of this girl and her family.  Her performance is spectacular and the scenes are real.  This year  I watched &#34;Beast of the Southern Wild&#34; and thought that most of the people I know  probably  think it's fantasy and nobody lives like that.  The same can be said of this film.<br /><br />My children and grandchildren have no idea that worlds and lives like this exist.  I know it's very real and haven't been far from it at times in my life.  Really fine film... I highly recommend it.
B00B7G3Y4U|1.0|i love horror movies and this soo not a horror movie.There's only a tiny bit of creepy in the kid Robbie he's the only reason I watched after a while.Please for the sake of horror movie fans around the world DO NOT MAKE ANYMORE!!!!!!
1451629184|4.0|I found her whole story amazing.  To be confined all those years and not even try to let someone know who she was, was very interesting.  A very good read.
B00571F26Y|2.0|The book was difficult to get into and left me w more questions than answers. It was totally unsatisfactory and unhelpful.
B000W91RUG|5.0|Easy purchase!! got here fast. Works well. :) Have no issues. They aren't a collectors set but a great cheaper way to go!!!
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|This is such a great series.  I can't wait for further episodes to the series.  The actors make their characters come alive and very believeable!
B003L77G6A|5.0|Easy purchase!! got here fast. Works well. :) Have no issues. They aren't a collectors set but a great cheaper way to go!!!
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|I found a glitches that knocks you of the track. The glitches made the game hardcore. Its very cool at first. Ubisoft Entertainment fix the glitch. I only made it to looney loops the first levle was hardcore no vouches in it. I found the glich in metal mayhem. And I rated five stars because I love this game.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Easy purchase!! got here fast. Works well. :) Have no issues. They aren't a collectors set but a great cheaper way to go!!!
B005C8ENI0|4.0|It was a great challenge to figure out how the case could be solved before all was revealed..<br />Very entertaining, liked it very much.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Easy purchase!! got here fast. Works well. :) Have no issues. They aren't a collectors set but a great cheaper way to go!!!
B0088W6IMQ|4.0|The characters are being developed well and evolve through the story, which itself is intriguing and involves a range of fascinating existential, ethical, and (pseudo) scientific questions, much like SG1 did. The mechanism of the Wraith feeding is the greatest hole which is likely to be quite difficult to fill: seriously, a life energy sucking creature? That seems to belong more in Buffy Vampire Slayer than in a futuristic SciFi show. There a couple cliche plot lines characteristic of this genre, including incorporation of an alien in the team, etc., but they did not seem as unnatural as in other shows, e.g. SG Universe, another Stargate spinoff.  Despite all that, I enjoyed the show. It had very few silly filler episodes about nothing, and even those offered clues or bits of info useful for the unfolding of the story that follows. As I remember SG1's 1st, and especially 2nd, seasons had painfully boring and pointless filler episodes, and Atlantis seems to avoid that practice as much as a show of this nature can. 4 stars, I'll keep watching...
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Easy purchase!! got here fast. Works well. :) Have no issues. They aren't a collectors set but a great cheaper way to go!!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|If you have been wondering why everyone is talking about this series, just watch one episode and you'll be hooked.  I was able to &#34;catch up&#34; in a short time by viewing this using Amazon prime.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Awesome continue action of a epic show. I would watch over again. Great characters and good story lines keep up the good work
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Kevin Bacon is awesome, as usual. The story is original, the acting solid, and I am gripped by suspense from the very beginning to very end.
B004KKYX9K|5.0|I loved the story, love the way Jodi writes, an excellent read, highly recommend it to anyone.<br />Sad, passionate, rivetting.
B008YU0AOE|4.0|Surprised kindle fire didn't come with a calculator.<br />This calculator works well and supports most used modes.<br />Good free calculator.
B0054SMIH6|3.0|This movie was decently entertaining - it reminded me of a typical John Grisham movie.  Matthew McConaughey played the same character he plays in many other movies.  It's a good 'don't want to think too hard movie'.
B007N5YIUS|3.0|Must watch 10 seconds of ads between levels, very annoying.<br />Other than the ads, the app is fun to burn some free time.
B007IK44CK|4.0|Good movie!  I love the action scenes and the stunts.  To me, Tom Cruise can get a bit campy in some of his movies so I was very happy that he didn't take his character too seriously and the one time he does get corny he makes fun of himself.
B000DN5W4I|5.0|I really enjoy watching Joe Bonamassa as well as listening to him. He is a great performer. Anyone who plays guitar can see how much time he spends rehearsing & practicing!
B006MPKAOI|5.0|This book gave an insight into OCD and being trapped in a controlling relationship....a really well written story, that I could not put down.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|A big Star Wars fan.  We purchased this app 10 minutes ago and my six year old has already opened all the levels he can without having to pay more.  What a let down!!!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|A little different than I thought it would be, but it an entertaining quick read that I enjoyed over all.
B001XUPGLY|5.0|Great movie. Enjoyed the time travel and conservation theme with whales. Love the humor, and revisiting what life was like back into the 1980's.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game rcks it gves so mny games. i cnt stop playing it is so addictive and it is free yes i said free!!!
B00BHMF578|5.0|My husband and I loved this movie!  Well done!  Affleck was robbed of the director Oscar nomination!  Casting was superb!
B00992CF6W|1.0|I play REAL minecraft primium on the PC and it is SO much better than this crap! I mean this game (that I call Minecrap) only has a small fraction of the stuff on the real version.
B003M70O5O|5.0|Sons of anarchy is perhaps one of the best tv shows ever.  You will be drawn into the story by the amazingly strong cast.  You won't be disappointed.
0345529057|5.0|Books received in Perfect condition, in sleeve. Will start reading as soon as possible. George Martin is and excellent author.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|This combo DVD was really very good. The best of all these movies are the subtitles for the Hearing impaired. Friends who have problem with their hearing have decided to stay home and just ordered the DVD. The special features and interviews are most interesting.
B006LSZECO|5.0|An absolutely strange yet enticing story about a married couple and their not so normal lifestyle. I would definitely recommend this book for adults!
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|The product arrived on time and the DVD was of  high quality. Packaging was very good and safe so it got home with no problem.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris is no Shakespeare. You won't find accounts of battles full of prose and symbolism. What you will find is the account of a man who was a selfless hero. Some men were put on this earth to be warriors. Chris Kyle was one of them.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book is so different!  The sex is a little over-the-top for me, but I couldn't help reading it anyway.  Thinking of reading the sequel.
B001S86J0I|5.0|This movie is one of my favorite movies of all time, and it never stops being funny!  It's funny even if you don't know about Trekkie culture, and funnier still if you do!  It's comedy gold, and I crack up laughing at every viewing, so of course I had to buy the DVD!
B00BSBXZDY|3.0|The movie was entertaining but the Easter Bunny was scary and Santa was a little mean. Do not really know what type of  audience the writers had in mind.
B006RXQ2CY|5.0|wow...........helen mirren IS the queen.  the story is interesting as told, but i think a large part of the appeal of this film is just the feeling that one is seeing inside the REAL palace and visiting the REAL queen.  such a fine performance.
B002M87V0A|5.0|I first saw this with my father when i was small,  and I have loved it ever since!  Have owned it since we got our first VCR.....Now replacing with blue ray!  If you love musicals you will love this colorful, happy, wonderful movie!  It just makes you feel good...its funny and happy, and love fixes all!  As a treat, Ron Howard is in it as a little boy with a lisp!  Wonderful!!  and you cant beat Robert Preston as the Music Man!  A must see!!!
B008XG1X18|4.0|Interesting app , nice to be able to view ideas while on lunch at work . Even better when in a store, looking for inspiration !
B007JNR518|5.0|One of the greatest horse movies ever have seen before Robert Redford is a great actor one of his best films ever in my opinion hope y'all enjoy it as much as I did it blu ray is just better than plain ol DVD
B0052SF6CM|5.0|This CD is really great.  Didn't know what I was missing until I received it.  Price competed and was really good
B005PK56TA|4.0|Great show, cannot wait until next season.  It started off really scary and tappers off a little, but over all it very entertaining.
B0070YDOT8|2.0|Boring.  Please get some more popular Facebook games on like Candy Crush, Best Casino, Luck Slots,  etc. Thank you !
1610390938|5.0|Scholarly book - little on the deep side - but I knew that when I bought it.  A lot of research went into the book, well substantiated, a must read for those wanting the latest thoughts on world poverty and ways to attack it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game has a lot more colors than temple run. A lot better one of the best game ever. It's okay for any age. I recommend it to anyone. It's also AWESOME because it's FREE!!!!!
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Hi,when using this dictionary I think you should be able to type the word because when scrolling you might go too far or way back. Thank you.
B001U0HBPG|4.0|The DVD itself was in great condition, but the cover was a little less than desired. The movie cover was tapen on barely. But for the price I have no complaints, no scratchs or skips on the DVD
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like subway surfers a lot because it is a fun game and I always look forward to where they are going to go on the world tour next! :) since it is around Easter, the egg hunt is great too!
B000JMKNV0|2.0|I don't know how to explain my feelings for this book. One minute I hated it, the next I was caught up in it. The story seemed to wander aimlessly, looking for direction and never finding it. Far too many flashbacks and daydreams of life with his dead wife.<br />The last few chapters picked up and made the story worthwhile although I'm still not sure of the conclusion. To me it left you guessing.
B00BAHKQW4|5.0|This game is amazing, but i dont know if you can get the spellbook as a human, can someone help me with that? OTHERWISE, THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is actually the 2nd time I've read this book because it is an AWESOME book! This series is perfect for 6th/7th graders that don't like reading. It relates to your middle-schooler life and has sone jokes here and there. Enjoy!
B005DI66N4|4.0|Wonderful story, told by a person escaping with his fellow survivors from Russia camps...well told with courage of man's soul and his instinct's to see another day.....many interesting experiences on their journey to freedom!
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I love the character of Rick Castle, he is a lot of fun. I also like the interaction between the four main characters. I like how they always have each others back.
B00BF123WG|2.0|This was surprisingly bad as a movie -- no character development, lack of dramatic tension and a confusing climax. The first half-hour is repetitive and ultimately of no consequence. The main character has no back story, no present story and remains an enigma at the end -- Claire Danes' role on &#34;Homeland&#34; was superior in every way (writing and acting). The movie is not tight enough to be a good drama, nor detailed enough to be a good procedural. The long ending scene is a mess -- a confused jumble of images. The killing of OBL is buried in that jumble and it's not very clear when it's actually happened. Poor scripting, directing and editing.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|Well It would become much better if you added boss rush already I have android and ios and boss rush already came out for ios
B00BP4WAZS|4.0|Reasonably good Disney movie.  Funny, with appropriate humor for both children and adults.  Not Academy Award material, but worth a rental...
B005C8ENI0|3.0|I wonder if McConaughey would have preferred Hollywood's bean counters to have backed off this film, that his effort to star would have given way to his ability to act? The film was a missed opportunity warped by the wolves in the box office.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Awesome.  Amazing story grounded in believable ideas.  Great Martian adventure with excellent and relatable people.  Can't wait for Andy's next book.
B0094K1MH2|5.0|Tin Tin is a wonderful movie that one could watch multiple times and still find it fun and interesting!  The CGI of the film is truly amazing...only a few giveaways and you might think you're watching real characters.  Great movie for the entire family!!!  I recommend the Blue Ray version if you're buying, as the HD is amazing on Blue Ray...!!!!
B009KEN87O|5.0|Addictive just like the old arcade style games. Starts off deceptively simple but later levels prove it`s worth. A very worthwhile visit down retro lane. Got it as free app of the day. A little pricey at just under three dollars. Easily worth a buck and I would consider a good value at $1.99
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Excellent acting by the three main characters; Dr. Walter Bishop, Peter Bishop, and Agent Olivia Dunam. The stories are unbelievable and weird, sometimes gruesome but keeps you coming back for more.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|The beautiful visual effects and great story were compromised somewhat by the questions raised at the end. Definitely worth watching.
0736083863|5.0|This is an excellent book for Pilates exercises. Especially if you are doing this on your own - a good reference to show you the correct muscle groups affected by the exercises. And the exercises can be done at your own pace.
B006ISJQ1W|4.0|While parts where confusing, and a little too graphic for my personal taste, husband loved it, and was very true to the book. Johnny Depp is amazing as always, as are most of the cast.
B001QJUX24|4.0|Wanted to see this movie after reading Empire of the Summer Moon, the story of Quanah Parker and his mother who was kidnapped at an early age and was raised as a Comanche. The movie was loosely based on this event. The movie  was good considering the year it was made, but the acting does not equal the acting of today. Still a good story and a good movie.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|i loved it, my wife loved it...everyone who listens to it (friends, colleagues, etc...)<br />no your ordinary radio hits but you'll be blown away....
B00BHMETKC|3.0|I did enjoy it but nothing really exciting.  If it was true to actual events, I would give it a &#34;way to go&#34;.  It does however, pointedly show the dangers of our political system when politicians think more of their &#34;look&#34; then of lives.  It certainly undermines an loyalty factor.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I had a hard time putting this book down. I liked how the story was written through the eyes of the child.  I would like to find out what happens next. Would love another story.
B00464F19Q|5.0|This is more a review for Amazon Instant Video than it is for Seven. I watched the movie the other night and experienced a handful of interruptions in the connection. I had to stop the movie half an hour from the end when it would not reload or refresh. I was able to finish it later and it didn't really bother me, it was just inconvenient. I just received an e-mail from Amazon saying that they had noticed there were a number of interruptions/problems with my viewing experience and they refunded me the $2.99! So, thanks, Amazon! I wasn't expecting such great customer service attention especially when I hadn't prompted them to refund me in any way!
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|Beautiful scenery, greatly told story, seamlessly put together. A beautiful story of growing up, coming of age, courage and love.  The refusal to accept defeat and the horror and bad in people and instead view the world from a more positive perspective.  A movie I will watch over and over and will probably take a different perspective from each time.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Not only is it the perfect place to store my headset, but the added feature of being a charger is a definite plus.
B005P1YCNK|5.0|This is a great breakdown of how to set exciting goals - AND how to incrementally achieve them. I've read mulitple books on goals, but this book is different in that it says to make simple changes that compound and will ultimately cause big results. It's written in a friendly, easy style that made it super easy to get through. The corresponding worksheets are helpful and make you really think about how you've been running your life. I'm what I consider a big goal-setter but I was looking for something to help me break down my goals and create an action plan. This book really helped with that - I highly recommend it!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|i can not stop playing this game.  i have a co worker hooked as well.  trying to get three stars is what makes this game so chalenging.  i love it.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Although I prefer the suave and debonair Bond, this is a great movie.  Action scenes are excellent and the storyline was very good.  I would not call it the best bond movie but it does rank among the best.
B007N5YIUS|1.0|The space game says free when you go to play it you have to pay for it If it says free it should be free I was very disappointed at the ad.Also the angery bird of the seasons is the same.H<br />hgkeller@shentel.net
B00BSBY38A|5.0|The story is a lovely one and makes one think about their relationships. Didn't read the book, so can't speak to how true the movie follows.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is the best app ever invented. You can get anything from a dinner idea to a redecorating your bathroom idea.  I am TOTALLY addicted to Pinterest! Thank you
B000HL0EEE|4.0|Enjoy this latest spin off from original Star Trek. It is a pre-quel and incorporates stories from other series well while unique on it own.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I was introduced to the books by the lady who does my hair and I bought all five and read them when I should have been doing other things. Of course I bought the HBO DVD series when it became available. The HBO series does not disappoint and ranks right up there with my other favourite Hollywood releases including &#34;Lord Of The Rings&#34;. I always recommend the series, both the books and the HBO series to my friends, but I suggest reading the books first before viewing the HBO series. The surprises in the story are best experienced first from the books. Having read the books makes viewing the screen version a more satisfying experience. Buy the books, then get the DVD sets.
B009FZFONO|5.0|One of the best dramas on TV. Sometimes the gore goes to far......but other than that we enjoy each episode.
B002BI6SMI|4.0|This is not the version I bought. I bought the extended single disc. I read about the movie recently and was interested in the subject matter. White slavery, as it is called, kidnapping young women and selling them for sex, is a rapid growth industry these days. Most Americans are not aware it exists. I bought the movie as a curiosity. This thing is not a documentary. It is an action popcorn feature flick with lots of gunfights, car chases and big explosions, but the core of the plot is dead on. Teenage girls go to Europe and are kidnapped by thugs and sold for prostitution. I have watched this DVD several times since it arrived and have not tired of it yet.
0743297334|5.0|Hemingway is by far one of the greatest writers who ever lived.  His prose is simple, short and to the point.  \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" is NO exception.  Although his first novel, it is a precocious example of good things to come for this sad, troubled writer.  For the younger generation, if you've ever seen the film \\"Dazed and Confused\\", this book will not disappoint.  The characters jump right out of the book, and we've all had friends like these..shallow yet lost, fun but unloving, troubled but dependable.  Could not put it down for a second.  Can't wait to read \\"For whom the bell Tolls.\\"  Now, I'm going to get me a bottle of good absinthe...so I can dance the night away...Van Halen style.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|This is a fantastic movie, one of my favourites. I watch the DVD often. I liked the John Carter books as a kid and was delighted when this movie came out. As a fan of the books, I was concerned as how the movie would be handled but, this time, Hollywood did not disappoint. I understand this movie tanked at the box office and that is a shame. It's a wonderful film.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I had tried 3 different cables with my Kindle, but could not download an update. You can purchase cheaper USB cables, but this one not only supports faster speed, accelerated charging, it is made to last.
0385344333|2.0|I love Lee Child, but \\"A Wanted Man\\" is by far his weakest Reacher thriller.  I kept reading, but wasn't so engrossed that I didn't notice the serious flaws as I read.  One of the central twists in the book comes in the middle, and is too predictable.  And although we never expect verisimilitude in a Reacher novel, the plot is preposterous, and the characters are wooden.  There's a huge FBI complex to protect/incarcerate witnesses, and FBI agents didn't know it existed.  And on being admitted to this complex, the officials don't think to search either Reacher or an undercover FBI agent.  There's another huge complex run by the bad guys, and somehow the existence of this gigantic building (coated with camouflage paint on the edge of a town) has escaped the notice of authorities.<br /><br />One of the book's serious weaknesses is that experienced FBI agents constantly look to an unemployed and homeless civilian, Reacher, for advice on how to proceed.  If Child thinks that having these meek agents be women makes it more plausible, he's insulting women.  One female agent even asks Reacher about the structure of the CIA, and what responsibilities the holder of a particular CIA office would have.<br /><br />As usual, Reacher acts with impunity, but here - after assaulting FBI agents and killing countless people - the fact that he can be assisted by the authorities in disappearing before being questioned is wholly unbelievable.<br /><br />I haven't given up on Lee Child and Reacher.  I'm hoping that this was just a low point, and that this great series will be resuscitated in the next installment.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|Rarely does a sung-through musical capture the human emotion and beauty as well as this work of art by Tom Hooper. A MUST see, but be prepared to cry at least once...
B00A77II0U|5.0|I was on the edge of the chair when I played this!!!  I never knew what was going to come at me next!! This is a keeper,  for SURE!!!
B00340ESIS|4.0|I liked it. Full of insightful little snippets of advice. However, I see this book as a complement to, rather than a replacement of, Syd Fields Screenplay.
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|Really boring. Not funny. Terrible script; no plot...not even a decent story about being 40. Don't rent this if you are with friends and want a laugh, or by yourself for that matter. No laughing...just yawning and frowning. This movie actually drained the life out of me. Pick something else. I promise you won't regret it if you never ever see this movie.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Wanted to read the book before I saw the movie.  The psychology of the abuser is interesting.  Seeing twisted religion and comforting belief were good in the same novel.  Not the most enjoyable read but intrigueing.  Finally saw some residue of her past life's effects that I was glad to see as would be too much for it not to be a apart of her.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|Really boring. Not funny. Terrible script; no plot...not even a decent story about being 40. Don't rent this if you are with friends and want a laugh, or by yourself for that matter. No laughing...just yawning and frowning. This movie actually drained the life out of me. Pick something else. I promise you won't regret it if you never ever see this movie.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|If you liked the Lord of the Rings trilogy then you will like this as well. I read a lot of negative reviews on this movie that said it was to long or it was boring and that there were things in the movie not in the book. I just watched it and I was never bored once it was just as good in my opinion as any of the other LOTR movies. My family liked the movie also. The picture and sound quality on the Blu-ray were both excellent. I honestly could not find one bad thing to say about the movie and have already watched it twice. I am excited to see the next 2 movies in the trilogy. I would reccomend this as a must have movie for anyones bluray collection.
B00A6PD9I4|1.0|The movie was superb; I could not view it as it downloaded at the lowest quality level and thus was almost impossible to watch. I stopped the film after a short period of time and watched at high definition level on another pay service. I was very disappointed as the viewer is unable to determine the film quality before paying for the service and has no recourse if Amazon can not deliver it at a viewable level.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I am late to the game on the British tv shows. I still haven't watched Downton Abby, but that is next on my to-watch list. This show is one of those shows that you fall in love with the characters and want to know what is going to happen next with them. From talking to my friends and relatives, Downton Abby is MUCH more entertaining, so I imagine I will be entralled with it, because I am really enjoying Lark Rise to Candleford and can't wait to watch each episode in every season.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This is the best of the hobbit movies yet released.  Some small parts left out in movie, but they do not effect the story.  True to story, and wonderful scenery and special effects.  The only disappointment was that it was not the complete story; can't wait until next part comes out.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game with amazing graphics. I recommend it and give it five stars. Works great on the kindle fire hd!
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|The characters are so well cast and the action never stops.  the main character gets himself into so many jams, you actually start stressing out for him while watching.  You will either love this show or hate it, but you won't be bored and if you love it, you will really love it.
B0079KGAOY|5.0|The movies showed up on time and in good condition as promised. The price was good and I reccomend this purchase to others.
B00785P2QC|4.0|very enjoyable and addictive. closest thing for free to simcity I have found so far. Only thing is having to buy feet's to expand your city.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book was recommended to me and I recommend it to everyone!!  Not a book on religion, but the Author's journey from his near death experience.  It showed me so much more than I expected and didn't know and confirmed what I thought I always knew and had experienced myself.
B008VVT51U|5.0|A feel-good movie that rejuvenates the spirit.  The cast is perfect.  More movies should be made with the kind of all-star collaboration this one had.  Looking forward to the sequel!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Didn't let me down. Grabbed me right from the very beginning and couldn't put it down. Mitch Rapp and Hurley together awesome.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Great movie, the whole family loved it.  The characters were fun, and the themes were very much appreaciated. Good movie!
B000JMKRKC|5.0|This was an interesting book, with some surprising twists. The book was well written, I couldn't put it down. I enjoyed it a great deal.
B001HN6918|5.0|This second movie did not dissapoint.  The whole family loved it and we can't wait for the 3rd installent to be made.
B009AP2G26|2.0|It's become very unrealistic and annoying. It used to make me happy and feel good about myself. Now it's just reminding me of the petty drama I went through in high school. I just don't feel like it has that spark anymore... Plus the actors for Jake and Rider are HORRIBLE...But the one little improvement is that the love story between Rachel and Finn isn't as annoying anymore.. Overall I just don't like it :(
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Everything looks amazing, this is a great time passer. I can easily give this amazing app the five stars it deserves. If you love horses, this is the game for you!
B007V65R54|4.0|The baseball chapter is very boring and dos not add to the purpose. But the other chapters are really insightful.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|i'm not going to really comment on gameplay and graphics as many others have already done that.  i just want to say what i feel about this game.  i had given up on jrpgs.  they seemed to linear and the characters all seemed more like charicatures.  but with a lack of decent vita games out there and based on reviews i decided to give this one a try.  all i know is that this game has got me interested in the genre again.  the story itself may be linear, but how you get there and the personal connections you make are all your own choice.  i find myself thinking about this game when i'm not playing it, and i can't wait to find out what's going to happen next.  the characters are all flawed human beings like us, and it makes you feel close to them as you play through the game.  yes, it takes awhile for the game to really get going, but real life is like that as well as we form relationships and get to know people.  this truly one of those games i'll be sad over when i've completed it.
B00BETX5PS|3.0|Too expensive to rent for 48 hours, even with amazon prime (barely cheaper than seeing it in a theater).  Staff turnover  to a new generation in MI-6 is promising.  Fabulous explosion, chase scenes, exotic settings.  I'm liking M's sociopathy and lack of apology or remorse.
B009XY97VC|5.0|Two Steps From Hell has never disappointed me before (in their previous two albums) and &#34;Skyworld&#34; makes good on their reputation. It's an intense ride all the way through, with some very good touches of dubstep, pop, and some actual vocals (that aren't simply for ambience). The music really feels like it tells a story. Great album!
B0095P29EG|5.0|We love this type of action movie. Not a great deal of blood and gore. Put this one with Captain American, Iron Man and the Avengers in your collection.
B007MU85D0|4.0|I heard &#34;Little Talks&#34; and decided to buy the album based on that song and I don't regret it. The first half of the album is that same melancholy-but-upbeat sound that &#34;Little Talks&#34; has. Unfortunately, the second half of the album slows down and carries a more ballad-like sound. It's not bad, but I really like the earlier songs on the album like &#34;Dirty Paws,&#34; &#34;King and Lionheart,&#34; and &#34;Mountain Sound&#34; and didn't really want the tracks to settle down. But overall, every heartfelt and quality album.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|A good movie.  Every year we get several of these types of movies that compete people against each other for whatever reason.  Nothing new here - just a new twist.  I was hoping for a funnier movie.  Not sure it was worth the ticket.
B00BBW16HW|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie, especially watching the development of the friendship between two very different personalities with two very different  backgrounds. They were able to teach each other lessons and expand each other's world. Loved watching Driss dance!
B00BWJARHO|2.0|WOW!!! This movie put me to sleep and no matter how many times I hit rewind- it was still boring.  Lackluster to say the least.  I should have waited until it arrived on Netflix.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|i like the way the characters talk with each other.  It displays real emotions in a work place.  Can't wait for the next season.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|Chilling from the start.  Just when you think the family is safe- here comes the real evil. Next time your significant other wants to buy a home on the cheap- ask questions...lot's of questions.  Questions like- has anyone died  in and or around the house and is the house fricken haunted?  If you get vague answers keep asking them or you'll end up like this family.
B009Z8FUB2|5.0|We saw the movie and the music was beautiful.  We purchased the<br />CD as a gift to a friend who saw the movie.
0670024813|5.0|The World Until Yesterday is must-reading for anyone who wants deeper insight into how the modern world got this way.  The history and insights are terrific and has helped broaden my sense of understanding of how the world operates and why.  The chapter on religion is worth the price of the book on its own.  This is a very good and informative book.
0525478817|5.0|I fell in love with this book from the very beginning and never wanted to put it down. I was both laughing and crying my way through Augustus and Hazel's adventure, not at all what I was expecting from a cancer story. I've often found myself thinking back to the characters and the story days after I've finished the book, and that's the mark of something truly special.
B00AJLHUAS|5.0|I loved this album.  It is filled with energetic music set to what appears to be the authentic style of the 1920's and 1930's.  One does not need much imagination to see Mickey and Minnie romping around to some of the tunes presented here.  This is good stuff and I use it to set the tempo for my aerobic workouts.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|Absolutely love this series. Only complaint is main character died in real life and the replacement just doesn't quite fill the role as he did. The remaining characters did as good or better than last season. Looking forward to next season.
B007C4CJNS|5.0|Excellent funny, funny writer.........Easy read.. easy to follow story line.  HILARIOUS in details of subject matter...
B001223BLU|5.0|So easy to download and listen to. The best of the Four Seasons. LOVE it. All my favorite songs. I have lots of songs on records, but no player. Now I have all the songs on my MP3 player and can listen to whenever I want!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that this app is worth it and all my peeps should buy it. Subway Surfers is so cool especially because it lets you upgrade to new places to start new records. New York,  Rio, and now Rome. I can't wait to see what's next!!!!!!
B00B99KJR0|4.0|This is a match 3 game. The boards get harder as you go along. Some blocks are frozen, some locked, some double locked.. some all of the above. It gets quite aggravating at times. It is challenging and fun, but doubt I'd download another one. Maybe I'm just not the ' match game' type.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It is cool, but it is really slow it needs to be faster but otherwise it is interesting it is much better than the first temple run.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|If you haven't seen Argo -- it's a must see.  I was on the edge of my seat even though I knew the ending.  It's an amazing true story that boggles the mind a bit!  I highly recommend it!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|One of the best things about a roller coaster is all the sudden and unexpected twists and turns. This show is the &#34;roller coaster&#34; of tv horror.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|great fun game. Not too challenging.  Fun time killer. I will play it again..Some of these games get hard but this one was sort of easy!
B002JVWRAE|5.0|Gave to daughter-in-law as gift.  I have never seen one of these shows so it is hard to come up with enough words. She loves it.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I love this series!!!! I also have the books, and they rate 5 stars as well!!! Package also arrived when it was supposed to in perfect condition.
B003L77GHE|5.0|Gave to daughter-in-law as gift. I have never seen one of these shows so it is hard to come up with enough words. She loves it.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I love this trilogy and can't wait for the third book to come out. I've read both books several times and at first, I wasn't that drawn in, but then I went back for a second read and the characters started to really, really grab me. I've been to England several times, but not to Oxford, however now it's on my must-see places to go next so I can have a visual of it and Woodstock.
B00AJLHTT0|5.0|If you are a bad seeds fan or not, buy this record.  It's so good. Even though he name drops miley cyrus it is still a great record.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a fun game. I enjoy playing it. The mini games are fun but I wish there were more.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|It's a fun and entertaining game, but it counts down too fast when it hits 20 seconds, plus when the game is over, it's still calling out  the numbers.  I've been locked out do to error messages and have lost some of my B points.  Gets very discouraging.  Need to improve the game.  It has too many glitches.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I watched all five seasons then started over.  Season One is fantastic.  The characters developed quickly and so did the plop.  Terrific series
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|This book is good b out t not as good as cabin fever well still worth it you should. Get it<br /><br />  :)  <3
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I am having a hard time staying interested in this book. Just not my cup of tea. Too predictable for me.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|It is mindless, challenging and addictive.<br />I was blowing through books on the Kindle as I haven't done in years...until I included this as a choice.<br />However for a long trip, it makes the time go by quick.
B007ZGBZHE|2.0|I have read every Pendergast novel and this one is quite bad. It has too many meaningless characters, bizzare sub plots, and an extremely predictable end. Best avoided..
B007N6NGYG|5.0|good graphics. fun idea. kids love it. upper levels are challenging for adults. fun on the original kindle fire. choo choo
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Hammer geil :)<br />Du also ist der Hammer gute Grafik mit allem drum und dran sieht wurscht aus mit dem Pferd superapp
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|its awesome and cool, and I think there should be a free roam option. overall, its one of the coolest games ive ever played
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|Even though not factually correct, it is a great watch.  History Channel has become my favorite series producers, actually I just finished watching The Men Who Built America on Blu-ray. Viking looks like another good one. Hopefully the rest of the season will live up to the hype.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I really love this game, a game you can play day after day,  it could use some different things to do, the competitions get boring and you don't really get to do much on your own.
B00BA5H3TU|5.0|This album definitely carries forward the progressive vision of the band. Some wonderful piano and instrumental sections with haunting melodies and vocals.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game was way better than I thought it would be. It has great graphics and unexpected obstacles at every corner. It is nothing less than amazing and I hope the come out with a Temple Run 3.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|I'm so tired of kids movies with evil creatures. This movie doesn't have them. Yes, there's a bad guy and a bad bird to create conflict, but they aren't too bad. We love the music, the story, the art. It's awesome.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|Awesome movie! I'm not disappointed with it at all, except for the fact is has approximately 30 one star rating at the time of rating it. If you read those rating, don't let them discourage you from buying the movie! There's is only reason why I think someone could rate this movie only one star: it is slow moving.<br /><br />Yes, it is in the beginning. But after about 10 minutes, if you don't whine about how boring the movie is, you will get very interested into the movie! To all the one raters:<br />This isn't CoD! This is an attempt to show what the hunt for Osama was really like. If you want to see some 'shoot 'em up\\" movie, go watch a movie like Black Hawk Down or Saving Private Ryan (which are very good movies too, I'm not down talking those movies). This is a movie about what espionage in the modern day is like, and how much sacrifice was involved the greatest man hunt of all time. You can whine all you want, but it won't change the fact that this is an amazing movie that shows how lucky we are to have heroes such as the CIA!<br /><br />To all you who one gave it a one star rating, shame on you for not recognizing the sacrifice of these American heroes.<br /><br />Anyways, to those who haven't bought, buy it! I haven't heard one negative review from the numerous vets who have watched this I have talked to, and you will love it, unless you expect this to be a 'shoot 'em up\\" movie. In the end scene when Maya gets on the plane, then you will realize the work and sacrifice these men and women make to keep this country safe.
B00AH8FTT2|5.0|This is another Jeffrey Archer &#34;can't put it down&#34; book.  I'm only about half way through & I'm already in the usual dilemma I get into with his books:  I can't wait to finish it, but I'm going to be really disappointed when there's no more to read
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is extremely fun. In my opinion, this game could use a couple more factories but it's still a really great game.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I never write book reviews but this book deserves one. When I chose this book I had no idea what to expect and it exceeded way more than I ever expected. Great book!
067144901X|3.0|Cute book, but I bought it for 3 year olds  and it was a little smaller than I thought. They liked it, though!!
B009KEN87O|5.0|A very cool game with flashback to the 80's love it as I play it several times a day or when I have any down time.
B00117W1K8|5.0|If you like stories like this one, where two brothers with different but enjoyable personalities are fighting evil in our world, then you'll love the series &#34;Supernatural.&#34;  Dean, the older of the two brothers, is cocky, but has such endearing qualities.  Sam, the younger brother is the quieter of the two, but also committed to fighting evil, even though he gets off track a few times.  The relationship between the brothers is one that you begin to care about, as well as their quest to fight all evil in the world.  After accidentally finding this show and watching it I've been watching it ever since and it has become a favorite that I don't ever miss.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Great movie for the whole family with a surprising ending. Made me go out and buy a lion and eat a zebra.
B0063IH60K|3.0|the game is okay. I cannot stand the advertisements between each game. i would enjoy the game more, if the ads disappeared.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|&#34;Darkness&#34; is very apt for this book. However, it was well written. I started this series because of my 11 year old daughter and I am glad I did. You won't be disappointed.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Clear concise presentation of definition, synonyms and usage.  Just what I wanted. This is much more convenient than going to the bookshelf to consult a conventional bound dictionary.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Like the updates and the weather alerts. the 15 day weather outlook is very handy. Have reccomended to my friends
B00633W614|5.0|The characters in this novel get deep into your imagination, and it's difficult to put the book down.  I highly recommend that you read the Clifton Chronicles.
B00457WZEI|5.0|Book keeps you very interested!  Loved having the view be from &#34;Joey&#34; the horse.  I can not wait to see the movie now.
B00003CXA2|5.0|I was very surprised to receive this in the condition it was in - completely wrapped in the original plastic wrapping, and it was actually a two-disk collector's addition! The title now says that it is, but I'm pretty sure it didn't mention that before when I purchased it! (a few months ago) Very pleased, this is one of my favorite movies!
B002LC8HF0|5.0|This is a great book need to read I must say must read, I hope there will be more but I feel this may be the end
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Finding this app has been a treasure. PERFECT to fall asleep to every night! Love it! Rain +windchimes is such a relaxing combination.
0307719774|5.0|I bought this in December 2011 and started it 1/1/12.  Some of the questions were a little bland to start, but after starting year two, I'm finding it more fun.  It's kinda fun to recall answers from last year and things that were going on at the time.  The following years will be even better, I'm sure.  :)
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Since starting to watch last year I have become a huge fan!!! I have watched from the 9th, 10th and 11th Doctor.
B006HL9G10|5.0|Love this app.  I use it for more than meditation, I'll admit.  It's become my kitchen timer when I need to check on things at regular intervals.  I do use it for mediation and yoga, as well.  Very easy to use and nice, non-startling reminder tones.
B008XG1X18|1.0|I would love to get a chance to review this app but for some reason it reads page not available or page has moved?
B00B7G3Y4U|3.0|PA1 rocked, PA2 was even better, but beyond that the 3 & 4 have been less than impressive. I just don'tget the whole cult aspect and it makes me wonder where the series is going. There have been creepy parts in the last two, but I  think the series either needs a makeover or just call it quits. If PA5 sucks I will stop watching them at all.
B009EANE3M|4.0|This album contains many currently popular songs, done in the Script's unique sound. A great addition to a pop collection and a must-have for any Script fan.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Great game to play, when passing time. My grand-son enjoyed the game also. I would get the app, it was free.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love it!!!<br />Stays exciting and keeps you wanting more!!! Can't wait to read the rest of the books:-) hot hot hot
B009KEN87O|5.0|Enjoy the game, I would tell everyone to get this game. Once you start playing, you will never put the game down.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|My family couldn't wait until this movie came out. We watched it right away. Scenery is beautiful and is gorgeous on Blu-Ray.
B00A757EFW|4.0|Like most apps it does take a long time to load and when it does it runs slow. Has way too much advertising trying to get you to buy the deluxe versions.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Game of thrones is the best series on tv. Great acting and action and it follows the books well. Can't wait for season 3
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Love this cd, and all of Rodriguez's music. Having gone through my teens into adulthood with &#34;Cold Fact&#34; it really surprised me just how unknown Rodriquez is in the USA. He is a brilliant artist and there is much reality in the music he has written.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This  could be a little better I  graphics by  perfect to play with a  3 year old  I love it to its not a bad game.
B008OHV5QO|4.0|An enjoyable movie that is based on Neil Young's life and the places he played his music at. Pleasant to listen to the songs.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I've been well pleased with the last few games I've gotten from G5, and this one was no exception. Nice blend of hidden object and mini games, and good game length. Definitely would recommend.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Both the story and the special effects were amazing in this movie.  I truly enjoyed this one.  It's not often that I can watch a movie over and over ... but this one I could.  Highly recommend it!  AMAZING.
B009RWRIKM|5.0|I've watched this film 4 times now and I continue to learn, be inspired, amazed, and touched deeply every time. We lost a true artist that helped to create a company of artists that will continue to touch the world
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great series, I loved every book. The first book in particular. I recommend it to everyone who loves to read.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This movie was one of the best that I have seen in a while. Amazing cinematography along with a different but interesting plot make this a must see! The movie follows the book (also amazing) very closely and does a wonderful job of putting the authors words into vision. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone.
0345803485|5.0|At the time I purchased this book it was hard to find, I enjoyed it, and the price was cheap.
B000V63C4Y|5.0|Like that girl from Ipanema. Smooth. Graceful. Golden. Mesmerizing. What beauty.<br /><br />Buy this album. It will soothe your soul. You won't regret it.
0345803507|5.0|At the time I purchased this book it was hard to find, I enjoyed it, and the price was cheap.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|The whole family enjoyed this movie very much.  We are big Denzel fans and have seem most everything he does.  He never disappoints.  Since we started using Amazon to view movies, we find that we have more good movies at our disposal than we have had with our &#34;On Demand&#34; service.  Keep up the good work.
0345803493|5.0|At the time I purchased this book it was hard to find, I enjoyed it, and the price was cheap.
B000HEVALC|5.0|Since I am a huge Elvis Presley fan, I thouroughly enjoyed this collection.  I recently saw the Million Dollar Quartet preformance at a live show.
B002M9WW30|1.0|Do not purchase these discs they do not play. I thought something was wrong with my blu ray player so I purchased another one, and by the time it arrived and I proved that it was in fact the discs and no my player it was too late to return the discs.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|I like the story, I do. But it's hard for me to get over the ridiculously obnoxious and immature writing. It was to the point that I literally threw the book down because I was so sick reading about her stupid inner goddess. It literally reads like it was written by a 12 year old. And the sex scenes are very blah....
B00BQUUH7E|5.0|The gameplay is great, the graphics are awesome and the addictivness level is out of the charts! I literally played this until my knuckles hurt (from holding the kindle) and my thumb was in pain. It is awesome. Totally worth the $.99. The multiplayer is awesome, one person complained they couldn't find the multiplayer, it's right there in the menu!
B005COO1X6|2.0|Short stories are enjoyable when the author has something to offer...this was sophomoric and provided little more than a thin, disconnected story line which framed a predictable ending
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I've played both the original Perplexus and the epic.  In one day of playing the original, I made it though 75% of the puzzle.  With the epic, I've had it for two months now and have only made it through 70% of the puzzle.  What I'm trying to say is that this is a very challenging (and sometimes frustrating) puzzle which will allow you to spend many hours trying to improve your record.<br /><br />I bought this for my office (at a consulting firm) to play with.  We use this thing frequently as a de-stresser and a &#34;brain game.&#34;  It's a fun time-waster, and almost all of my colleagues love having a go at beating their (and my) record.<br /><br />Since this thing has lived in my office, I'm not sure how it would do with younger children.  There are many more moving internal pieces on this one compared to original, which means you need be slightly more gentle with it.  Also, this thing can be quite frustrating at times.  Overall, this is a great product though.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have read all his books. They continue to be page turners. Awesome book can't wait until the next one
B000EZ7ZYA|5.0|We are very satisfied due to getting it in a reasonable fast time!!!! Disk and disk cover in good shape!!!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Fifty shades freed is a roller coaster ride, you know it is a hell of a ride, but you can't resist it. You start and you don't want to stop, you want it all, with all the  excitement, fear, rush, adventure. At some points you feel that it is too sweet, with all the I love yous and understanding and acceptance. The &#34; who is in control &#34; games the heroes play are also annoying and sweetly frustrating and monotonous. But when you get an intense moment, a peak or any problem with or between the heroes, you find it too much, you understand that you as reader can't handle it for too long and that the tension must end immediately, because you are already on the verge. Exciting, interesting and fascinating characters. No regrets whatsoever for getting this book. I am glad I didn't listen to all the negative reviews. They should learn how to differentiate between a cleverly plotted work of fiction and between real life. I started with the last book in the trilogy and now I am going to go to the beginning...
B001CC7PKS|5.0|We are very satisfied due to getting it in a reasonable fast time!!!! Disk and disk cover in good shape!!!!
B00785P2QC|4.0|This is a fun game with enough goals to keep you entertained and interested.  I chose this game because it was free unlike some of the other city building games and I have not been disappointed.
B001GCUNYO|5.0|We are very satisfied due to getting it in a reasonable fast time!!!! Disk and disk cover in good shape!!!!
B004I8WD6E|4.0|I've already dropped my 4S more times than I can count, and so far (knock on wood), no cracked screen or other damage! The case has edges that are a bit on the sharp side, but it does seem effective.
B000VDDWE2|5.0|We are very satisfied due to getting it in a reasonable fast time!!!! Disk and disk cover in good shape!!!!
1594201927|5.0|This book is a fascinating history of finance. I learned a lot that I didn't know before, and felt that It not only gives a good overview on the markets but a good insight into why we have the system we have, how it got this way, and where we're headed in the future.<br /><br />Definitely recommend to anyone interested in finance especially our current situation in the United States.
1419701533|5.0|I bought this set for my granddaughter for Christmas and she loved it!  The stories are good and entertaining.  She has read them all at least twice now.
B000SGSU58|4.0|I very much enjoyed this Michael Connelly novel.  But, I must admit I like everything I've read by him.  You never know whats coming next and for me the suspense is what I like.  Trying to find the villian among the various characters is always part of the thrill.  The Harry Bosch series of mysteries are always entertaining.
1250027624|5.0|This book is so worth the price!  Beautiful pictures and in depth details on each character. I have even had non Downton fans enjoy looking through and learning the lifestyle of that era.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|We are both in our 60's and went to see the movie in the theater.  We giggled along with the kids.  If anyone has not seen this great movie,  then they are missing a great treat.
B00BEZTMQ8|3.0|Maybe I misunderstand but it sounds like it is a 3 part movie which it should not be. If I am wrong I apologize. If not,shame on you!,<br />Though I have to see it.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|Seldom has humankind produced such a spectacular display of glorious mayhem. No character development is attempted, and none is needed; what this movie lacks in depth, it makes up for in wildly intense action. The fight scenes are amply entertaining. Jason Statham (as always) is a boss. This movie is everything that anybody could ever ask for in an action movie. It is flawless.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I am obsessed with the tv show! I could not put this book down! You should so read-! So good!
B001MBK3T4|5.0|Black Sabbath is Tony Iommi. That being said, when a new singer, Ronnie James Dio, entered the band, it was brought to a new level. Respect for Ozzie, but these two albums are my favorite of Black Sabbath.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|This book helped me deal with my mom's ALS and death from the disease! I started recommending it as Doon as I started reading it!
B001MCYZJC|5.0|Black Sabbath is Tony Iommi. That being said, when a new singer, Ronnie James Dio, entered the band, it was brought to a new level. Respect for Ozzie, but these two albums are my favorite of Black Sabbath.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This must be my favorite series of all time (though Harry Potter is a close second). The things that Katniss does, the things she has been through, are absolutely amazing. My favorite book of the trilogy is The Hunger Games, then Mockingjay, and then Catching Fire. I recommend this book to anyone who loves action, adventure, and, yes, a bit of romance. Thank you Suzanne Collins, for making such an amazing and inspiring series for all to enjoy.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book is soo great and inspiring, it has opened my eyes to new possibilities in religion and has taught me how to love and conquer things. And to never give up! Also it teaches you how to survive with a dangerous animal.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is awesome. Because well you av to run away from a big monster. Because you still a idol. And that is why I think temple run 2 is awesome.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this season and Downton Abbey in general. As usual, lots of twists and turns in the plot. Would recommend!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|this little guys works awesome for being so cheap. fits in my BOB and doesnt take up any space or weight to much. it can handles knives from swiss army knifes to my full sized K-Bar. best little sharpener for the money
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This is the first in a series of Jack Reacher written by Lee Childs. Reacher is a exmilitary man with exceptional skills in war fare. The book is written about a town in Georgia that is 100% perfect as things look but he is arrested within 39 minutes of arrival in town for a murder that he did not commit. This is a great book and the series is also. If you like murder mysteries you will enjoy this book. I give this book 5 star.
B008B8DY2O|5.0|Could not put it down. Brilliantly written and an excellent story. Definately worth a read. You will not be disappointed.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|People fall all over the scale on whether they like, love, hate, or are indifferent about his show.  I happen to enjoy it very much.  This season we see some progress in the personal growth of the characters, but the funny sarcastic banter and geeky mishaps and miscommunications continue.  If you have enjoyed past seasons, you should enjoy this one.
B00395ZYVS|4.0|This book was a great read.  It starts out great and does not lose its momentum. Very touching.  Would definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a quick but awesome and interesting book to get into.
B000003S0D|4.0|This album represents a more jazz-like feel, and incorporates more woodwinds and piano than other King Crimson works before or since. I like the variance in compositions and sounds, as this showcases another aspect of the creative side of Robert Fripp.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Very addicting, enjoyed learning about  the lifestyle  of the different  \\"classes \\" in Victorian  England. Even though  this was fiction, probably  many aspects of the lives of the people on the house were  pretty accurate. Very entertaining.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Bought this for my son's Kindle Fire in hopes it would help him use his imagination. Although at first he thought it was a blast to be able to break anything he wanted, he's now seeing that he can use this to design anything he can think of. I bought Pocket Edition for my tablet also and we've had a great time adventuring together. There are a few things I wish they'd bring to P.E. from the full edition (Redstone mining, TNT, etc), but overall this is an awesome mobile version of the game that will keep you busy for hours, if not days and weeks.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I LOVE mcpe it is awesome because my pc version is being dumb. I love it ps herobrine shall return hahahahahahahah!
B00B99KJR0|5.0|This game is a great time killer. Some of the levels are a little confusing. Since you have a time limit, it might take a couple of times to get through it. but over all it fun and very addictive!
B004478AS4|5.0|Thank you for showing how our people were tricked into this cultural hell we now occupy.  Refreshing to know we once loved each other before.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Good book<br />Will get sequels when I can<br />I really want the capital to suffer and lose their hold on everyone.
B009UNH0EM|5.0|This cable is very hard to find in a generic, and I like the ability to have an extra cable in case of loss or breakage.
B008OOYALE|4.0|I don't usually play online games but this one is a lot of fun. It keeps you coming back and wanting to reach the next milestone to see what's next. I just wish it had more details available on the finer points of the game instead of trying to ask other players and hoping/waiting for an answer.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I absolutely  loved the book and couldn't put it down, until the truth came out - then it became too unrealistic and I wanted to see the guilty party get nailed right up until the end - I was left feeling very disappointed that that didn't happen.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|No problems on Kindle Fire HD. Wish it showed when battery was charging along with the percentage charged but can't complain, for a free app it's great!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|One of most entertainingly witty dramas I have ever seen. Great character development and storyline. Make sure you start watching from Season 1, Episode 1.
0345803485|5.0|It was delivered in a timely manner and in great condition. It was a great book, I've finished it and the following two, as well.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Best idea ever. Free download and easy to understand. Makes sense to download and use it. Great idea. Should be available for all electronic devices that portable. Five stars all the time.
B002ROKQKG|5.0|My Husband a truck Driver and is able to read this on his kindle while waiting for his truck to be loaded or unloaded.<br />he loves his kindle and he is a made New Zealand Rugby Union supporter and said this is a great book and he highly recommends others read it too.
B00BGIBVP8|3.0|There is some humor in this movie. It drags and quite a few parts appear to be not well thought out.
B00BF123WG|4.0|Entertaining and suspenseful movie.  It held your attention and did not seem nearly as long as two and a half hours.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is an awesome app. It really takes away the trouble of flipping pages. I use this app during church and its really good. KEEP IT UP !!!!!!!!!
B000QCS9NM|5.0|The best part of the book in my opinion is all of the self conflict. Him coping with his sex addiction, him coping with the fact that he's a med school dropout, him coping with lying on a daily basis.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|I loved this book. It is such a beautiful story and I was transported into Cinder's world! The descriptions totally took me there.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book has taught me so much about life. There are so many lessons I would like to take from it and apply to my own life. Although this book is fictional it restores my faith in everything that I have once doubted in this world. I would recommend this book to anyone who comes across it. Thank you do much Garth Stein for bringing this masterpiece of a book to this world.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Beach Buggy\<br />I think its a fun game ,I like the music and all the realistic animals along with the  bridges and everything.
B000SEI230|5.0|I was sad because of how short it was, but it was so beautiful. I felt Landon's pain and desperation of losing the love of his life. Made me cry.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|This is so mellow so soothing  i have never slept so sound. I love the ocean,  better then therapy  keep up the great work. Thank You.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Work very well ,no problems at all. My hold family loves this game . One of the number one games on my kindle fire.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is another advantage of having Amazon Prime.  I can watch the 2nd season FREE.  I would strongly recommend  Amazon<br />Prime.  I never bother to look for books at Costco or Sams Club as it is easier to order from you and have deliveried to my<br />front door.  It is cheaper too, I am saving on gas as well as buying non essentials at places like book stores, Costco and<br />Sam's Club.  Glad my daughter talked me into Amazon Prime.
B009KEN87O|5.0|This game is reminiscent of Galaga and I really like it. It's a great way to waste a few minutes.
B00BHU9BV6|4.0|Look, any fan of Anna Karenina is going to have some complaints; you could never top, or even do justice to a book like AK in a two hour movie.  However I think this adaptation is beautiful and well-thought out.  I like that the entire film was set in an empty theater; so much of the characters' actions is determined by their percieved audience and so much of their fate depends, like actors hitting their marks, on everyone being in a certain place at a certain time (for instance, Kitty and Levin's happiness depends on Anna meeting Vronsky and taking him away from Kitty).  I'm sure there are several other ways that setting AK as a play comments on the book, and it's definitely something I'm going to think about for a while.<br /><br />I'm not sold on Kiera Knightly as Anna, but this may be a personal preference as, objectively, I think she does a good job.  I like that she isn't an overly sympathetic character, as that is how I believe Tolstoy wrote her.  Levin, Stephan, and Kitty are all good.  Jude Law is unrecoginzable as Karenin and does a very good job.  Vronsky is kind of doofy, but that's exactly how he should be.<br /><br />If you see this movie with realistic expectations, I think you'll enjoy it.
0061743526|5.0|A true masterpiece in every possible way. I think this is an example of the power of storytelling that quietly leads the readers into the dynamic discussions about conflicting ideologies, prejudices, sins and redemption as a collective society as well as individuals.  This book uses the form of literature so beautifully and effectively--the characters, sympbols, plots and the persopectives from the young girl's first person narration--that it engages the readers in the deep meditation and soul searching for the topic of hate, to quote, as a lack of imagination, as expressed in this book, as the inability \\"to finally see\\" people. The characters raise important and still controversial questions,-- questions from the wisdom and common sense of untainted children about the establishment of hate in the name of tradition and cultural propriety. It is beautifully written, and its language is so simple and clear, I can't say enough about this book.
B00BWJ91XK|5.0|ton's of action after a slow start...story line in sync with Lord of the Rings trilogy...if you liked LOP you will enjoy this one too...great to watch in HD with the great scenery.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is one of the best kindle games ever. My copy sometimes gets corruppted and on 0.6.1 you can only break doors on the bottom and it gives you two doors when it does get broken
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|This item was shipped very quickly, The price was great and of course excellent quality of blue ray discs.<br />A series I will keep.
B003Y5SWE4|5.0|We always enjoy hearing Elvis Presley singing those old songs and a few new one's very entertaining to watch ya
B00321GTJU|1.0|They don't tell you that you can't watch your purchased items internationally. I bought this to watch on an international vacation and was unable to. Would have purchased the series elsewhere if I had known.
1612191290|5.0|I enjoyed this book because it is charming a strangely poetic. It chronicles debt in ways that most people do not even consider, historical views of debt and how the modern debt cycle was produced. It was an education and interesting read.
B00BMCLCG6|4.0|It's Bon Jovi 2013 which is not all that bad.  It hard to compare to Bon Jovi in the 80's. so I like it for what it is.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|This app is the worst app I have ever downloaded. It is slow and it takes forever to do anything. The graphics are horrible and it is so stupid. It was a waste of my time.
B000002J0B|5.0|I am replacing my albums that were lifted years ago and worn out CDs and so naturally Houses Of The Holy and to be there.  IMHO this is the greatest rock n roll band in the world!!!!
B00846REIS|4.0|If you like the 50 shades trilogy, this will be a great read for you.  Very well written with an interesting plot that keeps you engaged. I plan to continue reading the rest of the books in the trilogy.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|This is like finding buried treasure...a real gem!<br />A great record!  Can't wait to see him live!<br />Checkout the film Searching For Sugarman as well!
B004L07KWQ|1.0|I put it on my Kindle Fire and I thought this would be great for great-grandkids. BUT I couldn't get out of it......it kept asking me if I wanted to erase the picture, I'd say Yes but couldn't get back to Home.......just kept going back and forth......so I had to go on the Amazon and delete it.  Any ideas?
B005SAJJHM|5.0|This show just works in every way!  There's nothing left to say.  Except, &#34;Don't you think if were wrong, I'd know it?&#34;
B008VBYN80|5.0|such a good game. works on kindle fire. playxall of you people.sloop funn<br />allow need to now noww now yeah
B002NVTSGQ|4.0|I am a late comer to Modern Family, but I wanted to see what all the hype was about.  I was rolling on the sofa laughing.  I only gave it four stars because I think it will develop and get even funnier as I move into season two and three.  It is also very sweet, which I was not expecting.  Cam is hysterical!!
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Interesting idea, got too contorted, &#34;12 Monkeys&#34; was better...can't wait for the next &#34;Die Hard&#34; release, that is Bruce's real vehicle!!
B002P79KAC|5.0|Genius, pure genius!  I can't even have a conversation without employing a BBT quote.  I am ruined for life.  I'm also happy I found the web-site where I can read the writer's &#34;Notecards&#34; that flash at the end of each episode.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Had to own this one, I have seen it in bits and pieces on various channels, at various times.....now I can watch any part of it, any time I want to....do you have a favorite scene?
B005C8ENI0|4.0|A bit quirky, but fast moving to hold interest. McConaughey is one of my favorites so my rating could be a little biased
B000HC2LI0|5.0|what a great show, i don't believe i actually turned this down when it was on TV. i've spent the last couple months watching it on Netflix in dialysis every day and have fallen in love with it.<br /><br />Aaron Sorkin is masterful in the Dramady category as he proved with his first show, Sports Night. i HIGHLY recommend that one if you haven't seen it. for some reason it only lasted two seasons.<br /><br />the show is about the senior white house staff and how the help the president. this show actually makes me want to run for president, or have Martin Sheene run at the very least. very well done
B004JZBGWI|5.0|You can have as many post-its as you want with as many titles as needed for your busy life style. I am a list person, grocery list, to do list, Memory list, Don't forget list, Etc. My devices are sometimes my backup brains.
B004QX07G4|3.0|i love ellen...she is hysterical...and there are parts of this book that make me laugh...other parts made me yawn....i haven't even finished it yet, due to lack of interest....
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This show is amazing.  Amazon streaming however, sucks.  You guys need to get your quality up ASAP. Buffering and that stupid circle would sometimes just keep spinning throughout the entire show.
B0063M22QO|3.0|I like to play the game and like being timed. But I don't like it because after playing the game it asks you if you want to go to Mahjong II.  Kindle Fire is new to me and I am not familiar with all the apps out there so I have nothing to compare it to.
B000IZ8SD8|5.0|This is my favorite Star Trek movie because it gives history of how we got from where we are today to the future, where Star Trek mostly takes place.  While it doesn't have the latest and greatest high tech graphics, its still engaging enough to not be distracting, like the cheesy graphics of the Next Generation TV show.  I recommend this movie whole-heartedly!
B003QSLW0K|4.0|It's been years since I've seen Lilo and Stitch. Had my 3 yr old niece, Carissa, watch it for the first. She was captivated through-out the whole movie. She even started to cry at one point of the movie. But in the end, she danced and became over joyed with the conclusion. Still a good movie and should be shown to younger audiences to know the meaning of being a family.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|This book is very well written. It is intense to say the least. If you like history and a suspenseful  plot, you will enjoy this book. More than that you will be forced to think about the world we live in and the types of people that exist in our world.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Gone girl is an imaginative thrill seeker with ideas that capture the mind and make you think twice about what happens when relationships fizzle out.
B009KKLQKO|3.0|For starters, the music seems to have no sense of urgency. It sounds like an above average band playing at a VFW. They should have just used ALL of Brian's touring band (The Wondermints) and it would've rocked! The vocals are still stellar but they seem somewhat reserved; basically like there's no soul behind them.<br /><br />The other thing that really bugged me was that it use to be bad enough watching Mike Love singing songs doing his patented \\"sign language\\" interpretations of each number--but, now I'll be damned, if all the rest of the guys (Bruce, Brian, and Al) don't do it too! Very annoying (and corny). While it was good to see the Beach Boys up on stage it was sad to see them \\"act their age\\" up there.<br /><br />After 50 years of performing in front of crowds they should have enough stage presence that it shouldn't look like a bunch of old guys singing and dancing for their grandchildren. \\"I get bugged driving up and down the same ol strip...(Bruce mimes an imaginary steering wheel)...\\"I gotta find a place where the kids are hip (then he points to--his hip!).<br /><br />One last thing...somebody should have trimmed Brian's nose hairs! I'm not sure if I can watch the video a second time because the High definition makes them stand out and it really bugs me.<br /><br />However, with all that being said it's still the Beach Boys and I will take the good with the bad. They're not going to be with us for much longer and I'll take every drop of them I can get! It's not the worst performance they've ever put down on tape, but it's nowhere near their best either. I just think I would have enjoyed it more if they didn't seem so damn hokey and they came across more as living legends and less like a bunch of old guys playing in a wedding band.
B0043VDIAG|5.0|couldnt put the book down, I read safe heaven every moment I had a chance. The story was well thought out and left you in suspense the whole time switching from Katie's point of view to her husbands. A must read!
B004OZZ624|2.0|Too long, boring, too many details that were totally unnecessary.<br />Major problems with this movie:<br />-The argument in the restaurant between the wife & the sister-in-law.  Completely unrealistic.  Is that how the director actually sees women?<br />-Laim Neeson's 15/35 minute rule for locking down a city.  RIGHT.  And just a little note for screen-writers/directors/etc, DHS does not have any authority to direct states or municipalities to do anything.<br />-The wife's \\"confession\\" was stupid.  Was she trying to push him away to be free or punish him because she was angry at him for being \\"so perfect?\\"  I can't remember ever getting mad at someone because they were totally supportive.  Just dumb either way.<br />-Who the hell would ask drug dealers where to get forged passports?  What was the point of the deaf guy's motorcycle buddy?<br />-Every cop is portrayed as a complete moron & jerk.<br />-The cops are calling the FBI in the end?  For what?  The FBI doesn't hunt down fugitives, the US Marshals do.<br />It's called homework.  Do it next time.  Stop being lazy & writing cliched crap.  This junk was an insult to my intelligence.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This free app from Amazon is easy to install and easy to use. It has a lot of information regarding available time remaining for various activities. Time remaining till full charge would be useful. It might show that but I haven't found it yet.

B0027MJU00|5.0|Enjoyed this book, read it after my first pic,<br />&#34; gone girl &#34;. Will definitely select more by this author
0061537969|5.0|This book captivated me from the very beginning just as the thought of hearing a dog's thoughts and heart have never occurred to me, a dog lover!  Although the story is fiction, the author had a way of telling what every dog owner must know.  It was comical and sad and never boring.  A dog's perspective of a human's life, as well as his own, made the book very hard to put down.  It was entertaining from page 1 until the end.<br /><br />The author did an incredible job writing and gave you an instant love for Enzo, which quiet honestly, I didn't expect.  What a great approach to writing.  A Must read!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The game is easy to play. I like ridding my horse Beauty. Competing in the competitions  is awesome! The game is fun.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Great, except Nexus 7 needs a little work on the graphics to make it more crisp. Otherwise, a very enjoyable game.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|The game runs well and the graphics are amazing on my Kindle fire hd. But I need neighbors! Add me on gl my username is romanticist.
B00BWJ91XK|1.0|The movie was awesome. HOWEVER, amazon instant video is the worst. The hd is high definition. At all. And there are no options to change the aspect ratio. I will never use amazon instant video again.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It is impressive how this game it's so simple and addictive at the same time. I have been playing it for hours and never got tired of trying new levels.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I am really enjoying your game I like all the unlockable items and the settings can't wait to unlock the character spike.
B00865P3AS|5.0|I love the modern/classic rock music reconstructed and filtered through the classical formats.  My wife and i like the music on this CD very much.  We have attended concert symphony versions of music from Queen, Led Zeppelin, Billy Joel, etc.
B002ZJCQT2|5.0|Great book.  Explains very difficult concepts in a clear and concise manner.<br />All major quantum issues covered (tunneling, uncertainty, wave function, wave-particle duality etc etc etc).
B009KEN87O|5.0|A perfect remake of our old favorite. Addictive and fun for kids and adults. Everyone in my household now plays this easy to learn hard to quit game :)
B00BSBVLF8|3.0|The movie Worlds Away incorporated a number of Cirque's top performances and acrobatic acts. It did not have any lines, character interactions or dialogue so I would say this is not for children. It was somewhat entertaining if you have never seen a Cirque Du Soleil show. I'm sure if you watched this in the movies on 3D IMAX it would've been more captivating. Skip it!
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|The wife and I saw this at the show and to be honest we both felt the picture looked fuzzy, and blurry during the action scenes. So we bought the 3D blu ray hoping our home experience would be better, and it was phenomenal!!!!!! The picture was super sharp and the 3D was amazing!!!!!!!! The sound rocks!!!!!! This is one movie to showcase your 3D home theater with.
B00BESLHEA|3.0|It was not what we thought, it was very corny I would consider it a B-rater. When we saw the trailer we thought it was going to be like a Mortal Kombat in a way, where all these klans come together and fight for the gold. But of course it was nothing like that the narration in it was terrible and the Blacksmith had corny lines and was a terrible actor, but other than that it was an ok movie, just a one time see rent only movie.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Amazon MP3 down load makes it easy to find the music, easy to buy either the album or just a single song and they make it easy to down load the music to my phone or pc.
B0095P3ULC|5.0|Transformers was a very interesting movie.  I love how they mixed the history of the space program to the plot of the movie.  Victoria Secret model Candi looks great in the this movie.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Reads as good as the first book in this series.  New to the review thing, bit the end was my favorite.
B001TM14VC|4.0|Top Gun is a really good movie.  I wish I had a really good subwoofer to enjoy it more.  I will definately watch again.
B006T3RM08|3.0|The tray is great and works really well but the down side are the material and the look.<br />The picture has you believe that it is either an aluminum tray or that it is brushed in color/finish. Its close...<br />Plastic Tray that is white.
B00BHMF578|4.0|A unique script, seemed very true for history.  It was fun, but i don't know if it is 'best picture' fun.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This was an amazing romance novel, very comparable to Fifty Shades of Grey. I can't wait for the final book to be released.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|wasn't great.  not really a fan .  Couldn't tell if it was a spoof or if it was for real.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|This book, along with &#34;Turning Pro&#34; is a true gift to anyone who wants to move to the &#34;next level&#34;. Extraordinary in that there is absolutely no fluff, no filler, just real relevant information that provides insight and clarity.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|very good.  Not quite 'toy story' level, but it is good.  I think my mom would like it too. a+
B008220D7S|1.0|I actually love Apatow's movies but this one was so bad (disconnected plot lines; shallow characters that weren't developed well; and overall questionable premise) that my daughter and I walked out of the theater along with two couples who we didn't know.  It was about 2/3 of the way through the movie when we were waiting for something exciting to happen in the movie and it just kept never happening--the movie and its characters and the humor just didn't mesh at all--so we and others walked out.  Wanted to waste as very little of my day on this movie as I could.  Believe me, its that bad, in the opinion of me and my daughter.
B009HV2JT8|1.0|I stopped about 40 minutes in.  Just terrible.  I guess the premise is bad enough, but there is just no pacing or anything and i didn't care about anyone in it.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|A great author, luv her style of writing captivating maintains your interest throughout the book have purchased three more of her books not disappointed yet.

B0031YJFCQ|4.0|Now that my journey through Larsson's mammoth trilogy, I must say that the novels progressed rapidly and enjoyably. This third installment is certainly rougher than the first (perhaps it's tied with the second), but it picks up right were &#34;Fire&#34; left off without losing its pacing. It's almost as if Larsson wrote this book and its predecessor all in one sitting and simply cut it at a climactic point in the middle. Several years went by between reading the first and second books, but it was a much shorter window between the second and third as Larsson left the reader at the edge of his seat.<br /><br />In this book, the questions are answered, the murderers are caught, the criminals are punished, and scandal abounds. I found myself getting sucked in to the hundreds of pages of mystery. As bittersweet as it is to be done with Millennium, Larsson has done a nice job making it worth the journey.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Different type of sci-fi, I enjoyed it, looking forward to #6.  Interesting concept of living inside silo, good story line, keeps your interest.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|dragged a bit.  could have been shorter.  by the time the &#34;explanation&#34; was provided near the end of the movie, my mind was wondering and it was hard to focus on what Pi was saying.
0385349947|1.0|There is only one way to say it nicely--this book is a Brobdingnagian bore.  Its one theme--leaning in, of course--despite its fairly complete defense, is unoriginal, uninteresting, and unnecessary.  Ms. Sandberg must have received a lot of encouragement to write so extensively about something that is so obvious and simplistic (even her psychological analysis is painfully prosaic and pedestrian). Neither men nor women need to read this book. It is 30 years too late (in fact, it would have been just as boring in 1983) and 30000 words too long<br /><br />I read the bulk of it in a single afternoon while drinking coffee at Barnes and Noble.  I left the book for those who want to pretend that they have read something meaningful.  And I bought, instead, the \\"Letters of Saul Bellow.\\"  Now I have a book with serious ideas--and these are only some of his letters.<br /><br />Sheryl--you are attempting to transfer your corporate power to a larger political environment.  This is a typical move from a studious power-seeker and as uninspiring a strategic direction as your book is an uninspiring read.  You seem to be a good executive, however, based on what I have read about you. So--be an executive and inspire young women and men. Be anything you want.  But, please--don't write any more books like this one.
B0056A9WF8|2.0|Too contrived for my taste.The premise is not particularly persuasive and the characters are poorly drawn.It is all a bit pat really
B0000A5A0T|5.0|This CD is better than the reviews. From opening note to closing song, it is amazing how it gets better with age. Trane before the heroine took him down. I would equate this to Miles's \\"Kind of Blue\\". I hope I helped, but it certainly is a cannot miss. It still sounds like it was made yesterday. Out of all his fellow peers, I also think that this CD with Cannonball Adderley compliments Miles even better than Freddie Hubbard or John Coltrane. I know that is a stretch, and maybe personal opinion, but Adderley new Miles was a prodigy, and/or just could make the adjustments to is ego, to let Mr. Davis \\"Chase that Voodoo Down\\"
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I love it......it was filled with romance, betrayal, and intimacy all in a perfect mix to make you never want to stop reading it.
1592407889|5.0|Before I read 'Lucky Me: My Life With--and Without--My Mom, Shirley MacLaine, I never had a definitive opinion of this actress. And I refer to her as an actress, not only because it is Ms. MacLaine's chosen profession, but because the moniker's 'mother', 'grandmother' and 'decent human being', seemed to be 'professions' she wanted no part of.<br /><br />Sachi Parker, the author and only child of Oscar winning actress, Shirley MacLaine, tells a very familiar, yet disturbing tale of her life. Familiar, because there are bookstores and libraries, littered with books from the children of celebrities, that have truly horrifying stories of abuse to share with the general public.<br /><br />But Ms. Parker's story is not quite horrifying, as it is pathetic. Her father, a man named Steve Parker was nothing short of a con artist. And I'm sorry, because I know this is a terrible thing to say, much less type, but Shirley MacLaine, came across first and foremost as a total flake! There is a reveal in this book that is too ridiculous to be believed and yet it is heartbreakingly true. The reader would wonder how a woman like Ms. MacLaine was able to reach the pinnacle of success, being that stupid. And her 'stupidity' in this situation, is the direct reason Sachi's childhood was the mess that it was.<br /><br />There is something else in this book, that stands out and is mentioned time and time again. Ms. MacLaine, is ridiculously cheap and tightfisted with a buck. One might think that she just doesn't want to spoil the daughter she barely raised. Additionally, MacLaine voiced her belief that Sachi should attempt to make it in the acting world on her own--since MacLaine herself did.<br /><br />BUT, I will never understand, rich people that come from impoverished backgrounds, that have children that they do raise in splendor, turning around and expecting their children to 'start at the bottom like they did'. I think it's unrealistic. And I don't believe for two seconds that any actress in Hollywood, gets to the top on her own. Either nepotism or a casting couch is involved and Ms. MacLaine's beginnning was probably no different, despite what she wanted Sachi to believe.<br /><br />I gave this book five stars for two reasons: one, it deserved it. But second, Sachi Parker does not come across as a woman who is writing a tell all book about her mother, to be mean or vindictive. I believe writing this book was therapy for her. My sincere hope is that she can actually let Shirley's crap go and not let it infest her own beautiful family.
B001NHNG64|3.0|I was looking for a new author to suppliment my list . Loved ' Killing Floor ' . 'Die Trying ' rated solid , but just not on a level with his first . I hope # 3 is better ....
B009VSW15Y|3.0|Purchased the camera app in Feb. 2013.<br /><br />My phone camera and regular camera do just as well, but sometimes not at my finger tips.<br /><br />My Kindle Fire HD is usually right at hand so I will use it first as the moments don't last long when needing to take a picture.<br />If that moment is missed its gone forever!!<br /><br />Just have to remember not to look at it when taking the pic, which is not something hard to do.<br /><br /> Its fun at the moment!!
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Although this book started off slow, it grew to be a great read. Absolutely great that it gave you the perspective from his wife. Chris Kyle not only a hero, but a role model. Displayed courage, confidence and drive. A definite read.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I app'd it because tof the grandkids.<br /><br />They now have their own Kindles so this has fallen by the wayside.<br /><br />But if we would go traveling to shop and they  would come along with a friend, then they both could do it.
B008035H16|5.0|This is an entertaining \\"fly on the wall\\" account of the authors journey from his first failed and successful businesses up to the sale of Zappos to Amazon.com for ~us$1bn. As an entreprenuer I had previously been inspired by many aspects of Zappos' culture and this book gives more of the background to that. I think the biggest takeaway is to learn just how close (and how often) Zappos' was to failure as it grew to finally turn a profit, around five years after it was started.<br /><br />Based on the headlines, it had seemed to me that the author had led a charmed life, turning his midas touch from one business to another. Turns out the truth is very different and author is just as human as the rest of us with the main difference that he has made some very big bets in his life, bets which very nearly went bad. Personally I found this very inspiring.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved the book! Bit slow starting but from the middle to the end was excellent! Suspensful! Had to keep reading!
B009GEAPYW|5.0|--Minor Spoilers in this Review--<br />It's almost a line for line adaption of the graphic novel using Miller's art as a storyboard. Fans of the original will, however, immediately notice the absence of monologue or voice over. Lines like: \\"Four men die... leaving the world no poorer.\\" \\"There are seven working defenses...\\" are all missing, replaced by either dialogue spoken aloud, extra camera shots, or simple implication. For example, the camera lingers on empty drinking glasses to show a drinking problem. Sweat beads reveal fear. For me, such changes feel welcome: Show us fear, don't tell us. However, it does reduce Batman's bad ass appeal a little.<br /><br />The action scenes are brutal. Miller did an excellent job but seeing a smooth flowing one on one fight in thigh deep mud (the fight moves look amazing -- reminding me of UFC but with more fast contact and less caution) is something else. I actually cringed during one brutal fight scene. When it comes to violence, the book implies a lot; the film shows everything.<br /><br />Once you get into the film, you'll forget the somewhat choppy frame rate and the lack of voice over and you'll feel all the things you felt reading the book for the first time. In fact, you'll probably feel something more. There were frames in the book that I didn't fully understand (how did they get into that position? How did Robin get Batman into the Bat Mobile?) that the film explains better. And certain bits of emotion, especially around Carrie Kelly, feel more emotional in the film than they did in the book.<br /><br />Oh and the commissioner doesn't smoke... he chews nicotine gum. What a cop out!
B00BBW16HW|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It was down to earth and real the message was so strong that it overpowered the subtitles.
0399157565|3.0|It seems that Patricia Cornwell is untouchable from an editorial point of view.<br /><br />Apart from giving an excuse for the title the element relating to the dead paleontologist is redundant, offering nothing worthwhile to the plot.<br /><br />This book could have been appreciably shorter and would have been the better for it. It's superior to the awful \\"Port Mortuary\\" but nowhere near the standard she established early in her career.<br /><br />There's a danger that Patricia is coasting on her reputation rather than seeking to sustain or augment it... and please stop turning Pete Marino into a cartoon character.<br /><br />Now lagging well behind Karin Slaughter.
B0037NVM2C|4.0|The movie was, of course, still excellent after all these years.  I'm still not real happy with Amazon Instant Video, though.  4 times during the movie my screen froze to buffer, and once it froze for 20 seconds while the audio continued to play.  I also don't like how you can add movies to your wishlist that aren't &#34;free&#34;, but then can't rent them from that screen on your iPad.  It's just not a very user friendly interface yet.  It makes me miss Netflix, especially now that they're starting to get good movies again.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|What can one say about LES MISERABLES that hasn't already been said?  It is a magnificent film, the best movie musical in years.<br />Director Tom Hooper deserves acclaim for taking the huge riskj of having the singing performed live instead of later dubbing---something never done before.<br />The use of actors who sing rather than singers who can't act gives the music a raw, unfettered quality that is often emotional and frequently overwhelming.  Hugh Jackman is superb as the tragic Jean Valjean, making it hard to believe he's the same actor who plays Wolverine.  Oscar winning Anne Hathaway is devastating as Fatine.  With only 15 minutes of total screen time, Anne's I DREAMED A DREAM is simply awesome!  The most powerful moment, however comes from newcomer Samantha Barks whose ON MY OWN is show-stopping perfection.  Colm Wilkinson's Bishop and Eddie Redmayne's Marius are likewise excellent.  The child actors are incredible, especially David Huttlestone (sp).  Let's remake OLIVER and have him star!  Sasha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter provide great comedic relief.<br />I'm not a fan of Russell Crowe but his Javert does have an impact in spite of his merely passable singing.<br />Amanda Seyfried makes a lovely Cosette but she pales in comparison to Barks and Hathaway.<br />Every technical detail from costuming to production is flawless.<br />LES MISERABLES is a rewarding movie experience and one I highly recommend!
B00BI5IXL4|4.0|If you haven't seen this movie you need to!! It makes me cry every time!! The two things I don't like about it are:<br />1. I don't love Russell Crow's singing voice<br />2. Don't love Anne Hathaway as an actress<br /><br />It is super easy to get past those things though and LOVE everything else!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This extremely well-written book provides so much more than just the facts of Lincoln's life.  You almost feel like you are standing in the background watching his life unfold.  You understand just how perceptive a man Lincoln really was and how and why he commanded so much respect from virtually all who came in contact with him.  I can't think of too many other 900 page history books that I have had difficulty putting down.  A truly inspiring book about an amazing man as told by those around him.  The author has taken thousands of facts and woven them into an interest-sustaining story that the consummate story teller, Lincoln, would have found marvelous!  I STRONGLY recommend this book to anyone, but if you have any interest in history and have't read this book, by all means read it!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downdon Abbey<br /><br />I love the old time English stories.  All my friends would love this.  I saw Season 1 and had to see the rest.  The only bad things are the video and audio are not clear.
B005G5PPGS|2.0|I found the stories about actual players and coaches held my interest.  However, the descriptions of the strategies and the philosophy of drafting went on and on and I found myself flipping pages forward.  I did complete the book but it was work.
B00A3NQNUU|2.0|A very sad revelation I had to make was that I realized you could no longer gain gems from logging out and back in. This was was the only thing I could ever do to get anything done in the game, and now it's gone. Why did this happen? Dragonvale has now lost existential amounts of my interest and overall become severely less fun. All this stuff, rare limited time dragons are just scams to get you to waste money on a fun game, and without this gem gaining login, it seems like you &quot;wizards&quot; are simply scammers getting kids to waste their money unknowingly. My little brother stole my dad's credit card and spend 700$ worth of gems because of the fact that he wanted to get some silly dragon. All I can say is, I hope you get what you wanted Backflip Studios. And honestly, it would've been a smarter idea to keep the link than to off it if you'd thought for two minutes about it.
B00B2YH7BS|5.0|All the other reviews have pretty much covered what this film is about so I am just going to say this is probably the best documentary on music (or any other topic)that I have ever watched. Great job to Dave Grohl on his directorial debut and hope to see more from him. Buy this now!
B0084U0IEG|5.0|This is just a really fun read. A clever story that's written exceedingly well. Fairly upbeat relative to what I hear of some of his other books.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Lots of fun and entertaining.  Challenging and exciting.  Great scenes and I love all of the updates. Good clean fun.
0385349947|4.0|I'm a man, and I picked up this book to see what successful women are doing to see if I might learn something.<br /><br />Why not pick up a pointer or two from somebody who's gone much further in her career--and with many more obstacles--than I have in mine?<br /><br />The list of things Sheryl Sandberg has done that I haven't is lengthy. Too many times I've not spoken up when I've had things to say. At work gathering after work gathering I've failed to sit at the table with key decision makers. Time and time again I downplay myself for fear I'll be seen as a self-promoter.<br /><br />The book reminded me of something I have done, however. I've moved cross country twice on account of my wife's career. Acknowledging that my wife's profession had more upside than my own wasn't easy, and I feel fortunate that none of my family and friends criticized me for supporting her.<br /><br />Sandberg's book taught me that other men are not so lucky. I knew of the challenges that women face if they choose to assert themselves in traditionally male dominated careers, but I never appreciated the gender based scrutiny and criticism men face when they choose to support them. Husbands and wives shouldn't have to consider gender related stereotypes when deciding who works outside the home and who works in it. Simply pick the best person for the jobs.<br /><br />I give the book 4 stars instead of 5 because I think it spends too much time telling men and women to remove gender from their decisions and not enough telling them specifically how.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|I'm not a big Tom Cruise fan, but he does play a good action hero. This was an enjoyable way to spend a snowy Saturday evening. I wouldn't watch it a second time, but I know my husband did. :o)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like the game ive never taken care of a horse before and this lets me do it. I would recommend it
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Lots of character details.. great acting.<br /><br />No CSI magic.<br /><br />It always take me a little bit to get into these shows because there are no fancy camera effects / sound effects at every corner, CGI between every scene, or pop music between every scene.<br /><br />This is how it should be.
034580404X|5.0|this book will keep your interest and keep you turning the pages from the first page of volume one to  the last page on volume 3 - intense, wonderful read
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Any self-respecting nerd will get all of the 'smart' references. The actors must laugh their way through the script every week
B004H6G0TI|5.0|When I saw this game as the FAOTD I wasn't too impressed at first sight. Some of the 1 stars reviews didn't help either. I thought why not give it a chance since its free today. Found out this game is much better then the screen shots would lead one to believe. I thought this would be one of those side scrolling games like an old school nes game. The plane you control flies in all directions,  and rolls to an upright position on its own. The controls looked very small in the screen shots, but expand when you use them making the control circle bigger while using. The flight control and fire control were both very smooth and very responsive. This game is just plain fun. No pun intended. I've already earned a few of the 50 planes that are available. Going to wrap up this review so I go back to playing this game. If you can get it as FAOTD, you have no reason at all not to get this game. I would pay a few bucks for this game, cause it is definitely worth it. The soundtrack is classical musical, which really classed up the game in my opinion.  Nice little touch. Very nice indeed. (Of course the music can be turn off, and your own music played in background if classical isn't something you care for)<br /><br />Played on Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1
B0049J3QF4|5.0|Simply put, I really enjoy this movie. My kids both like it, a boy and a girl, and I used about 15 minutes of it recently in my high school US history class to demonstrate the changing nature of the US in the 1950's with the building of the freeways and the growing car culture. Really fun with heart.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This has got to be one of the best games on Amazon that I have ever played. The game just looks great, and has a very interesting soundtrack that speeds up or slows down in a very trippy way as you play.<br /><br />You play as an microbe in a eat or be eaten world. You can only eat other microbes that are smaller then you, and of course larger microbes can eat you. You move around by expelling your inner fluid outward pushing you in the direction you want to go. You can't do this too much since expelling fluid makes you shrink in size and therefore easier to be eaten by larger microbes. The game uses a simple color system for size. Objects smaller then you are blue, which means you can eat then. Objects that are larger then you are red, and can therefore they eat you. Pretty easy to understand.  But there's more to this game that makes it different.<br /><br />You can also speed up or slow down the passage of time in the game, and the music will speed up or slow down to match the speed of time. Very nice touch that really gives this eat or be eaten game a different kind of dynamic you don't see in too many games. The soundtrack is very soft and peaceful.  The game recommends headphones, and I would agree unless you have a tablet with good front facing speakers. I'm playing on my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1, so its two front facing speakers sound great while playing this game as well as looking great on its large screen. This is a must have game for Android tablet owners in my opinion.
B006HL9G10|5.0|This is a very nice meditation timer. It has many presets and  nice sounds with useful timer options.  I find the interval bell to be specially useful. The sounds are not jarring. Before this app, I used a regular timer with a custom bell which was good. Now, I use this all the time.

B00BEZTMFY|1.0|There are bits and pieces of this movie that held my attention, but overall this film is a huge disappointment. The characters aren't especially interesting, and the story does not pick you up and carry you along the way Lord of the Rings did.<br /><br />In one way it confirms something we already knew about Hollywood: it is very easy for an acclaimed filmmaker to forget what it is that made his earlier films beloved. But to go from cinematic greatness to cinematic tedium, as Jackson has done with The Hobbit, is a bridge too far.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|I have read Fall of Giants, also by Ken Follett, and now Winter of the World and have thoroughly enjoyed them both. I like reading about history but I find the more traditional 'Documentary/textbook' style books quite boring, but the way the author enfuses the facts within a frictional tale makes it a lot more fun to read and learn about history.

B007HJ96NO|5.0|The original version of this movie is the more dramatically effective one. The three-hour version adds a full hour to the story about the hero's attempt to recapture the lost love of his youth in middle age, but it detracts from the integrity of the story. Thus, this review is of the original two-hour movie.<br /><br />Cinema Paraidso is about a boy who grows up without a father in Sicily during the 1940s and 1950s and turns into a successful movie director in Rome by leaving behind everyone he loves as a young man. As a boy, he falls in love with movies and is befriended by the childless movie projectionist in his town, who teaches him how to operate the equipment in the local theater. After losing his socially upscale girlfriend while serving in the Italian Army, he returns home to find someone else in the projectionist booth as well. His father surrogate advises him to leave the town for Rome and not look back, ever - to make a clean break with his provincial life. He does just that and succeeds professionally, but without the love of family. He neither marries nor stays in touch with his mother, sister and friends back in Sicily for 30 years. The cost of living only for the work he loves is to live without love in his personal life. As his mother tells him: \\"Whenever I call you, I always talk with another woman, but I can tell in their voices that they don't really love you.\\"<br /><br />An openly sentimental story handled with subtlety, the movie recaptures the communal spirit that centers on the small movie theater called \\"Cinema Paradiso\\" in the town. Quite simply, this is a wonderful tale of love and loss, with a splendid coda at the end that will make you weep.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Wonderful, creative story with such vivid imagery.  This is one of those movies you want to have on your shelf, not just rent, but to own.
B00BMVTTJ4|5.0|For all the \\"experts\\" mediocure reviews, I could find no real flaw with the first part of this new trilogy. It was true to the written story in many ways and had a dash of youthful flavor that the author originalky intended when he wrote the Hobbit as a children's novel. Watch and enjoy!

B0090P98Z4|5.0|The game is really fun to play. Even though it's free, you have unlimited play time, so you don't have to wait for any points to recharge or anything. Of course if you are willing to pay, you can get better equipment right away, but you can also grind as much as you want. The combat system is really fun, and powering up your skills let's them continue to be relevant and enjoyable. Overall a fantastic game, especially as a free one.

0307887448|4.0|The world in 2044 is not a place many enjoy living in, that's why many escape into Oasis. Oasis is an online life simulation. You can be anyone and do anything (almost) and it's probably better than your real life. When the Oasis creator dies, he leaves his vast fortune up for grabs. All someone has to do to win it, is play one last game. They have to find three keys and open three gates then they will find an egg and they will gain control of the company and the money that comes with it. Wade comes from a poor family and since his parents died he's been living with his aunt. Oasis is the perfect escape and this game, the perfect excuse to stay in Oasis nearly permanently. He joins millions of other's in the quest for the egg. But competition is tough and Wade may find out that some people are willing to do anything to win. He's going to have to pull out some tricks of his own if he's going to be the winner and stay alive.<br /><br />This was such a great read. Wade was just a magnificent character. I could read books through him all the time. It's not that there was anything in particular about him, he was just so real and plain. The 80s references made my day when I got them and showed me lots of new things when I had to look them up. Definitely made me miss my Atari. ;)<br /><br />This would be a great pick for boys who play video games and don't read much (really this is a great read for everyone). The novel flows very nicely, so you don't get stuck in any slow parts.<br /><br />There's a light touch of romance thrown in (maybe unnecessarily) but it's not overwhelming and it fits Wade's character. I don't want to say too much and spoil the novel for anyone, but if you're looking for something fun to read grab this. Ready Player One was engaging and just a complete joy to read.<br /><br />First Line:<br />\\"Everyone my age remembers where they were and what they were doing when they first heard about the contest.\\"<br /><br />Favorite Line:<br />\\"For a bunch of hairless apes, we've actually managed to invent some pretty incredible things.\\"rless apes, we've actually managed to invent some pretty incredible things.\\"

B009AMAGQM|1.0|So much wasted potential on this. There were little things that weren't included that bugged me and there were huge things in this movie that bugged me. All in all this movie was just below average. The following rant may be a bit spoiler filled, so proceed at your own risk.<br /><br />Why did Lena and Ethan not conversate inside their heads? Why!? I feel like the relationship was so insubstantial in the movie and it made things just seem silly. It didn't make sense that Ethan knew that Lena was good and light and wouldn't go dark.<br /><br />Why didn't Ridley eat a single damn lollipop? Where were Link's drumsticks? Why was Amma so young? Those were some little things that bugged me. It was almost like when Hunger Games DIDN'T PUT MADGE IN! Why not? It would take like one minute and it would make a world of difference.<br /><br />Pretty much this was a movie based on bare bones of the novel. It seemed like more of a magical romance that didn't really make sense, instead of a Southern gothic tale. It was just very disappointing how much was lacking in this film. I'm sure if I had read the book more recently, I would have been even more disappointed. It very much reminded me of the Twilight movie. What a terrible movie, with only the smallest hint of relation to the book.<br /><br />So go, see this if you must, but I really can't recommend it.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|It is a very information DVD. I am surprised how food corporations<br />go to great lengths to make money without regard for<br />safety of human life.
0525478817|5.0|Yeah sure, this is a cancer book, but, it's not about cancer. It's about strength and fun and books. It's about how a novel can transform you and sometimes amazing books are written by terrible people (looking at you OSC). It's about a girl named Hazel and a boy named Augustus and all the people that care about them. It's about blind and one-legged teens egging a car. It's about finding happiness where you can. It's about moving on. It's about making this day your best day.<br /><br />\\"My thoughts are stars I can't fathom into constellations.\\" That's a pretty good review for this book right there...<br /><br />Seriously though, this was such a great book. So many lines that just kick you right in the gut. It's surprising  because this book is really funny too. So you'll be reading along, chuckling at the banter between the characters and then all of a sudden BAM! This s*** just got serious. It totally works though, because that's how lots of people deal with hard things. They wrap it up into something funny and more manageable.<br /><br />Hazel was a great character. She just felt so real and honest. I loved how she was addicted to a novel. I've never been that obsessed with one novel before (yet) and it just seems amazing and wonderful. The only problem is this novel is fictional and now I want to read it and I can't. Fairly disappointing  but I guess less disappointing than if I read it and it was awful. Back to Hazel though, it was great having her be our main eyes and ears and brain for this story. She was a really honest narrator and she picked some pretty great people to hang around with. She acted real with her parents too. Not all \\"I hate you!\\" or \\"We're BFFs for LIFE!\\" but a nice mix in-between. It was easy to like Hazel, because she was nice person all around.<br /><br />I feel like this review needs to mention how amazing Isaac is. The Fault in Our Stars is always talked about HAZELANDAUGUSTUS!!!! which is fine, but ISAAC too. He lost his eyes to cancer and he was worried about his love life. He was just a really great character too and I wished he was in the novel a bit more. He really changed the outlook of the novel. He was so spirited that it didn't make his situation seem utterly depressing. I mean it still completely sucks having eye cancer I imagine, but he made himself into a person that could get past that and live life. Although, I have no idea what was going on with him internally this whole time, maybe he was miserable...secretly.<br /><br />Now Augustus. For how much charm he seemed to exuded, he also seemed incredibly awkward. He definitely tried way too hard a lot of the time. I have to agree with Hazel, that when he let all that slide away he was a much more awesome person. He was much more love-able without all that stuffy charm.<br /><br />The last few sentences of this novel were a bit flat. I felt like there should have been something more EPIC. But, life is a bit flat I guess.<br /><br />The last third of this book had me flailing my arms around much like a giant squid of anger. Life is so unfair. I know nobody ever said it was fair and it's childish(hopeful) to think that it is, but still. I mean WHY!? It just so awful that good people have to suffer while there are terrible, terrible people out there who get to live happy lives doing all their terrible things. They should be the one-eyed, one-legged, oxygen bearers of this world, not teens who are good people.<br />\\"It's not fair,\\" I said. \\"It's just so goddamned unfair.\\"<br />\\"The world,\\" he said, \\"is not a wish granting factory,\\"<br /><br />So yes, please read this book. When you get to the end throw this book. Smash this book, tear the pages from this book to wipe your face with. Afterwards buy a new book and place it on your shelf for next time.<br /><br />First Line:<br />\\"Late in the winter of my seventeenth year, my mother decided I was depressed, presumably because I rarely left the house and spent quite a lot of time in bed, read thesame book over and over, ate infrequently, and devoted quite a bit of my abundant free time to thinking about death.\\"<br /><br />Favorite Lines:<br />\\"His every syllable flirted.\\"<br /><br />\\"In the end, we both lost. So it goes.\\"<br /><br />\\"Augustus and I were together in the Improbably Creatures Club: us and the duck-billed platypuses.\\"<br /><br />\\"It seemed like forever ago, like we'd had this brief but still infinite forever.\\"<br /><br />\\"I owed a debt to the universe that only my attention could repay, and also that I owed a debt to everybody who didn't get to be a person anymore and everyone who hadn't gotten to be a person yet.\\"ee time to thinking about death.\\"    Favorite Lines:  \\"His every syllable flirted.\\"    \\"In the end, we both lost.

B009HV2JT8|2.0|So you often find that the movie is not nearly as good as the book. For one reason or another it just doesn't meet expectations. Things get dropped and the can make the movie just plain not as good. What strikes me funny about how bad this movie was is the fact that the author of the novel wrote the screenplay for this. Despite this fact the movie seemed like a loosely based version of the novel. I suppose the movie was more entertaining, the book would probably be more closely similar to a documentary than a blockbuster. It seemed like too many things were changed and dropped though.<br /><br />Another point that bugged me was Abe's superhuman strength and the disregard for the laws of physics. So many scenes in this movies suspended belief. Why did Abe have to have superpowers in the movie? He didn't in the novel and it was perfect, it made sense. Then to watch the movie it just seemed crazy. Why couldn't Abe have just built up his strength? Why the magical?<br /><br />I was very disappointed in this movie. Maybe I would have enjoyed it slightly more if I hadn't read the book? Still the physics and superhuman strength bugged me quite a bit. Watch it if you dare.
B0011UJMK2|2.0|I have tried repeatedly to read this book and it is a &#34; no go&#34;.  I guess I read to gain pleasure or to be educated, this book does not fit either category , and depression is not part of what I want in a book.  This one will go unread on my Kindle and that a rare thing for me.

B0018J2QB8|4.0|A friend told me about this series, so I decided to give it a shot on her recommendation.<br />I initially thought &#34;how could anyone like a show about a serial killer&#34;.<br />Then I watched it and it was interesting and funny. It isn't as basic as I thought, it's not 100% about Dexter being a serial killer. It's about him struggling to appear normal in his life with work and family, while feeding his &#34;dark passenger&#34;.<br /><br />It's very well made.

B00BM1AJIO|5.0|Worked very well on Kindle Fire, no problems at all. The game did end a little too soon, I wanted more! Know that there will be paintings left over and those other worlds just aren't for us. *sad face* Engaging story line, our heroine goes to different worlds in the paintings, helping those on the way to finding her son who was stolen by the evil dude. Only one evil dude which was nice for a change. No creepy clowns or dolls! Yay! When I say 'not too easy', I mean it took some time (of course I would have liked more levels!) but when I play, it's usually at E.O.D. when I don't want to think all that much and relax. This game is perfect for that and plain old fun. G5 is like a G6. :) I very much recommend this game.

0062082353|3.0|Completely a matter of personal opinion. I thought the book would be more about the tactics and logistics of snipers. Very personal account.  I've only been able to get thru half the book so far. For me I hold a deep respect for our soldiers who give so much and sacrifice sometimes their lives. What I struggled with from this author is the absolute joy he gets from killing.  A little disquieting for me.

B008220C56|1.0|I had heard that this version of Tolstoy's masterpiece was a visual feast and that was the key reason I bought it.  The fabulous visual background of Anna Karenina is crucial to any movie version of the novel, which deals with the magnificent settings inhabited by Imperial Russia's version of the &#34;one percent.&#34;  Instead, this movie is presented as a stage play with one cheap stage set after another. I lasted 20 minutes, as there was no visual entertainment.  For a movie, this dvd which comes in two forms, was fairly expensive, and if I hadn't actually watched part of it, I would have returned it for my money.

I was a bit reluctant to read these, especially since the commercials for the movie looked ridiculous but my nephew convinced me it wasn't a typical story. He's right! It's a fast read, grabbed me from the start, good character build and a fantastic dystopian setting that had me reading the first 2 books in one evening!
B008220DGE|3.0|Anderson takes on big subjects and only Scorsese has taken on a similar big subject, more a biography of Howard Hughes,The Aviator.He often tackles the father-son relationship(Boogie Nights,There Will Be Blood,Hard Eight).The Master has been shot on 65mm film,this gives an epic technique for what proves a chamber piece. We get clarity and detail of a post-war America and the 50s with brilliant production design in clothes,department stores,music, cars, ships.Joaquin Phoenix plays Freddie Quell,a man with PTSD/alcoholism,drifting aimlessly and at odds with a family-friendly reality.He mixes up hooch from torpedo oil or paint thinner.He stows away on the boat (that happens to belong to Lancaster Dodd,The Master) that brings him into The Cause.Phoenix's acting is frenetic, twitchy,driven like Montgomery Clift out of Neil Cassidy.He is obsessed with sex and sees it everywhere.Dodd(Hoffman) is inspired by LRon Hubbard of Scientology fame,with a dash of Wellesian conman charm.He brings Freddie through processing sessions which are very well done with flash backs to Freddie's own Rosebud moments and buried traumas to excavate the past lives.Dodd is a patriarchal bon vivant with room in an extended family for Quell.One can't understand how these two men are drawn together,but when both are thrown in adjoining cells(for Dodds practising medicine without a license) they squabble like lovers.Dodds also is partial to Freddie's alcoholic mixtures and takes him on as a fighter in The Cause and as a photographer.Dodd while fund-raising in the Dowager set shows himself to be a song-and-dance man,razzle-dazzling his way through a roomful of pliant females,like a satyr in a visualization of naked women,from Freddie's or his wife Peggie's(Adams)POV.Peggy masturbating Dodd shows her proprietary claims to her `roving' partner.<br /><br />Dodd doesn't take too kindly to being questioned about his beliefs,losing his temper with a hostile interlocutor at a cocktail party in New York,or when questioned about the change of a simple word from `recall' to `imagine' by a gushing sponsor,Helen Sullivan(Dern).His large appetite for life has its limits.Phoenix gives an extraordinary,twisted,contorted,Method-like,performance, Hoffman is charismatic,beguiling.The edgy,propulsive score byJohnny Greenwood is effective.Beneath these two riveting performances there is a lack of substance to the film as if it retreated from subversion and pared back its ambitions.We are moved away from the cult's serious operations and corrupting forces,towards its central figures as characters not strictly defined by it.Quell's disinterest in the religion he embraces is the film's own detachment from it.We are all at sea like our surrogate, who(not Dodds) is at the centre of the drama.There is no content of belief only rhetoric, Dodd's has the power not the sermon, manipulating like all cult leaders, for whom we have no backstory.The film remains impenetrable,the characters's motivations remain vague even while richly endowed and believable,what really draws them together(friendship or suppressed romance,who knows?).The psychological robustness of the characters is not integrated into the operational substance of the cult,using one to dig into the other. These lead to moments when the film is treading the water of inaction and repetition, and the ending is like the air has been let out of a big galleon balloon riding over the landscape.Hollywood it seems remains kind to Scientology.

B004LWZWGK|2.0|Without going into the actual details of the movie, because you should see it for yourself to judge. I will just talk about one huge disappointment of the movie and that is the criminal. The criminal in this movie was a hard-core Marxist who basically sought to reverse the rules of society to work for the poor and criminals. This plot was not original at all and seriously lacked imagination, considering that this has especially already been tried in the real world, i.e. Communism. No, this movie sucked, okay the action was alright, but that is not what makes a movie, it is it's plot instead. However, it is not that this criminal is a Marxist that makes this movie bad, it is the fact that he is just like everyone else in society and he really does not want to change the system, but only to change who the benefits of the system are applied to, i.e., steal from the rich and give to the poor, this is classic Marxism, not original at all, Mr. Nolan. Also, Bane's Marxism was not the real reason it sucked, because in the end, he was planning to blow up the city, presumably with him dying as well. Besides the movie being slow to really start and the huge plot gaps, the real reason this movie sucked was because Bane himself (by this I mean everyone who worked for him as well) had to do all of the work. This is just another, \\"good guy, bad guy\\" film, there is no psychology whatsoever in the film, it is pretty clear, cut and dry who the bad guy is. However, if you remember The Dark Knight, the Joker was the complete opposite of Bane, the Marxist. The Joker was an anarchist, do you remember when he burnt his money after the bank robbery? The Joker did not live for money, but for chaos. Bane did what he did for money, but the Joker did what he did because, well just because, and it is that that makes The Dark Knight so psychological. In The Dark Knight, Batman said that all criminals want something, you just have to figure it out, but not the Joker, he wanted nothing material, only chaos. Bane, however, was a Marxist who released criminals from prison, because he had claimed that they were kept in there \\"UNJUSTLY\\", but according to the Joker, there is no such thing as \\"justice\\", only rules that keep people in order, rich or poor. Do you not remember the part in The Dark Knight, when the Joker declared that \\"Gotham deserves better criminals than the current ones\\"? What he meant by this is that all of the current criminals are all in the business for money, but what Gotham needed was a class of criminals who did what they did just for the sake of it, just to upset the \\"system\\", to up set \\"order\\". Finally, this brings me to the worst part of the movie. In The Dark Knight Rises, Bane must kill the people himself . Now, even though he tries to do this with an atomic bomb, we should not be awed by this, because remember that it is not the \\"what and how\\" (this is only action), but rather the \\"why\\" (this is the psychology). The Joker's main goal in The Dark Knight was to show that deep down inside, people were all evil and that the only thing holding them back was the system or rules, but once you take that away, the real chaotic nature of people is shown. More importantly, the Joker tried to show this, by using the people themselves, he wanted the people to initiate the chaos, not himself. Do you see the psychology? A perfect example of this, is towards the end of the movie when he gives the people on the two ferries the option of either life or death, by choosing the life or death of the other people on the second ferry. See, so the point is, that the Joker was trying to create the scenario where the people could not blame the so-called \\"villain\\" anymore, because they themselves were all the villains now. They would all be just as responsible as the Joker would be, if not more, because all the Joker would have done, was merely load the gun, but the people themselves would have pulled the trigger. None of this psychology was in The Dark Knight Rises, Bane is clearly the enemy and no one else. It is clear that he must be stopped and there is no other option. Furthermore, it appears that the whole thing that was motivating Bane in being a villain was the fact that he was now in charge of the League of Assassins who seek a world of perfect balance, which would just be creating another system, no matter what kind of system it would be. This is the very thing that the Joker despises and seeks to destroy; \\"RULES\\", \\"ORDER\\", \\"AUTHORITY\\", and especially \\"STRUCTURE\\" that keeps all of the former in place. In all, most enemies in comic books, including Bane would be easy to defeat in the real world, but if the Joker ever accomplished his goal, the world would be lit aflame with self-inflicted chaos and we all would be cast back into that treacherous \\"State of Nature\\", in which Thomas Hobbes described it as being: \\"In such condition, there is no place for industry; because the fruit thereof is uncertain: and consequently NO CULTURE of the earth; no navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by sea; no commodious building; no instruments of moving, and removing, such things as require much force; no knowledge of the face of the earth; no account of time; no arts; no letters; NO SOCIETY; and which is worst of all, continual FEAR, and DANGER of VIOLENT DEATH; and the life of man, SOLITARY, POOR, NASTY, BRUTISH, and SHORT.\\"

B009LGO88E|5.0|I bought this exclusively to use on the US version of the 3DS XL, just in time for Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate. It is clearly the best thing that has ever happened to the 3DS. I can now properly hold it in my hands without having any fatigue. The second pad works flawlessly and you don't have to worry about doing odd things to control a camera.<br /><br />Sadly it makes the XL huge. Much bigger than it was before. This thing is just shy of being as big as a WiiU gamepad. It makes carrying it around with the XL a chore, not that I wouldn't bring it around with me still.<br /><br />Find a carrier or get some big pockets as this thing is definitely worth taking over the plain setup any day.

1402270275|4.0|Honoria Todd knew she couldn't lie low in the Whitechapel district forever - but she had hoped. Honoria and her family - a prickly younger sister called Lena, and sickly little brother named Charlie - had already been through so much since their father's murder. She had hoped that they could hide away somewhere, nurse Charlie back to some semblance of health and quietly hunt for the cure their father was working on, before it got him killed.<br /><br />But now Honoria has attracted the interest of district master, Blade. He is ruthless and blood-thirsty (literally) and nothing goes on in his rookeries that he doesn't know about - least of all a prim-looking dove like Ms Todd who is clearly on the run from someone.<br /><br />When Blade and Honoria finally cross paths, it's downright combustible. She has fierce secrets to keep, and he's curious to pry them out of her . . . any way that he can. But Blade predicts Honoria would be sweeter to catch with honey than vinegar, and so strikes a bargain that she'll coach him in elocution lessons, in exchange for his protection.<br /><br />But when Blade discovers the identity of the man who killed Honoria's father now hunts her family, he will come to realize all that is at stake for the Todd's, and in fact, the whole of Whitechapel.<br /><br />`Kiss of Steel' is the first book in a new steampunk paranormal romance series called `London Steampunk' by Bec McMaster.<br /><br />I haven't really been terribly tempted by steampunk romances. I tried Meljean Brook, but it wasn't for me. And there have been a few others that I've sampled pages of, but rejected because I just wasn't interested. . . the only steampunk I've loyally stuck with was Gail Carriger's `Parasol Protectorate' because the trending sub-genre seemed suited to Carriger's ludicrousness, extravagance and wry humour. But, I decided to give steampunk 'steamies' another whirl with Bec McMaster's hot new series.<br /><br />First off, I loved the Whitechapel setting. It's already an iconic, gory destination for Jack the Ripper - but in McMaster's steampunk world the streets of Whitechapel are overrun with monsters. We're talking vampires and werewolves, and a few nasties that are all new and horrifying creations of McMaster's `London Steampunk'. Honoria Todd and her little family certainly stick out in the gloomy Whitechapel district - she's an educated lady, barely scraping by with elocution lessons since their father's death left them in hiding and near-penniless. So it's no wonder the biggest Whitechapel monster of them all, Master Blade, makes it a point to pull Honoria aside one night and try to deduce the reason this lady would be hiding out in his rookery. . .<br /><br />From there `Kiss of Steel' becomes quite the cloak-and-dagger story; there's the murder of Honoria's father, the secret `cure' he was killed for, and how it links back to her sickly brother, Charlie . . . and the powerful echelons beyond Whitechapel who are responsible for the Todd family's tragedy and currently being in hiding.<br /><br />And the currents running beneath all these stories are Honoria and Blade's attraction. They really are two complete opposites; she, an educated woman on the run, and he a riff-raff blood-drinker with a cockney accent. But they work incredibly well together. There's this constant push-and-pull with them that makes their scenes together very interesting - she's hiding big secrets, and he knows she's running from someone but increasingly, he wants her to run to him for safety. Sure, it's a storyline that's been done again and again and again, but McMaster has written two very charismatic and conflicting characters in Honoria and Blade, and it's just downright fun to read them clash on the page.<br /><br />If I have any complaints about this new series it's the questionable `steampunk' label . . . I think this is actually pretty firmly in the `paranormal romance' genre, since there was more of a concentration on supernatural than steampunk. And while there was an alternate history explored, it just seemed like this book was lacking the Victorian-era industrialisation and mechanics that mark most steampunks. Regardless of the fact that the word `steampunk' is in the series title - there just wasn't enough here to convince me of its steampunkiness, if you will. That's not to say this wasn't a darn good paranormal romance - I just think maybe the `steampunk' label was an attempt at trending.<br /><br />This is a new series, so throughout `Kiss of Steel' McMaster is laying the foundations for future books. Next up is `Heart of Iron', featuring Honoria's sister Lena and Blade's right-hand-man, the loupe-infected Will Carver (who's already terribly interesting for hints of bisexuality touched upon in this first book). I actually went into `London Steampunk' thinking that the next two instalments were already available. Alas, I have to wait until May and October to get my hands on more McMaster books . . .  but my impatience is probably a very good indicator of how much I enjoyed this new series, and intend to stick with it.an steampunk.

076115728X|5.0|This is a BEAUTIFUL book - and would make a great gift for someone of really any age.  While my 2.5 year old loves it for all the colors and interactivity, I feel like a child who is about to graduate (from first grade, elementary school, middle school, high school, or even college) would love it for both its creativity and for its message that mistakes happen, but they can end up bringing more beauty to our lives if we can look at them the right way.  This is so wrong, but it would be a funny gift for a very close friend (with a good/sick sense of humor) having a baby shower for a \\"surprise\\" baby... as both she and the baby would love it (for different reasons)...hahahaha :)  It is really so cool how the author has taken \\"mistakes\\" (ripped paper, spilled ink, etc.) and turned them into such creative, evolving masterpieces.  I think it's something worth buying rather than taking out of the library, because you will read it in different ways throughout life and it's really quite inspirational.  And cute!

B0060MYM3S|5.0|While the second season of Game of Thrones wasn't nearly as addicting as the first season, it was still fantastic. It's entertaining, throught-provoking, and downright cool. This item shipped fast and arrived before I expected it; the corners of the case were just a tiny little bit scuffed, probably from shipping.

B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Liked how they portrayed the future and time travel.<br />The story takes a turn that you may or may not like but it does make sense and complete the big picture of the movie. Even if it takes a little while to think about it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think the game is awesome because of all of the creapers and zombies and iindermen and indersheep and mostly slunderman!!!!!!!!!!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show.  Not only is it entertaining but I have picked up a few apocolyptic survival tips. I sure hope there is going to be a season 4, this show is the only reason I got cable.  ;0)

B0036EH3XE|3.0|It took a long time to get there but I'm glad I saw the final season.<br />Overall, LOST was a good show. Lots of twists & turns. Now that I've seen the last season, and looking back, the whole thing took-too-long.<br /><br />  Its disappointing that more wasn't said about The Dharma Project. We do find out what the Black Smoke on the Island is. I'm thinking that probably 2 seasons-worth of the whole series coulda been left out. Maybe its just me, but I wish more shows would have just 3 or 4 really GOOD seasons - and then the writers should create/invent a NEW show. Rather than droning on, meandering, and making a good show become boring by stretching it out for too long. In my opinion, that was what happened with LOST.<br />  I have a couple other seasons of LOST, too- but wish even more questions woulda been answered and tied-up at the end.<br /><br />  Imagine writers making THREE different TV shows that are 3, maybe 4 seasons long, but that have excellent plots and scenarios and move at a faster, always-something-happening, dont-wanna-miss-it pace...(rather than anything 6 or 7 seasons that just plain takes waaayyy too long to \\"get there\\").  I'd much rather have that!<br /><br />A classic example to prove my point is: remember \\"The X-Files\\"?? I doubt too many people stuck with it all the way through. And why? Far too much of a carrot-on-a-stick...i.e...the answers you want, next week....only to be suckered yet again. Yeah right.Probably only a few die-hard viewers bothered to watch all of it. It just took to long to go anywhere.  Example 2: the show: FRINGE. Another  good show. John Noble is great in his acting. But at least one season (the one with too many \\"Creature\\" episodes) coulda been skipped entirely and it'd still be a good series.  Faster pace. Better answers at the end! (see all my reviews). Then create NEW shows. Too many meandering story-arcs and SUB-plots. This applies to ssoooo much TV these days.pinion. It CAN be done.
B00A9T1HUO|4.0|Always enjoy hearing Josh sing but felt the accomping music overpowered him at times.  Inspite of that, I would still recommend it.
B003PGNBO8|4.0|What if the whole world blacked out for several seconds?<br />That's the starting-point of this show. But what caused it? Who is behind it? And why? I give this show Kudos for good creativity. The ending coulda been somewhat better, but a good show. Fast-paced, not too drawn out and good suspense. (see all my reviews). Held my interest. Nice job.
B002HFP0QU|5.0|Been hearing their songs for years never had a tape. This one encompasses all their hits!Play it every day Love it!!
B006O2QNOU|4.0|The film described well the reality in the financial market. The valuation of the financial product is sometimes illusion. It was also interesting to see how they managed and controlled their mind.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book kept me locked in, every turn a surprise. Kept me coming back for more, what next. Mr Landay is a master with  pen and paper weaving a tale of intrigue and emotion capturing the thoughts and feelings of the characters so that you feel like you know them personally.
B00BF8OYJO|3.0|ok. at times a little long winded . Plot ok ,a bit  too many 'red herrings' otherwise enjoyable.I will continue to read more of her books in the hope that they will hold my interest a little more.
B00BHMF578|2.0|Wanted to watch it, eagerly did so when it was finally available to rent rather than buy.  Made it about halfway through and then fell asleep.  If you've seen Tosh's review of this movie, it's dead on.
B004Q1FDHO|5.0|Needs more weapons. This game even be good. At first u can buy the battle ship. More and more weapons in the game.
B004HY9NKI|5.0|Just a good flick.  Got a bit of everything.  Action, fun, funny violence, mythology.  I really enjoyed this.  A lot.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|It was a interesting read. I didn't like how the story wasn't really showing, it was more telling, and I wasn't really dragged Into it. Other than that, amazing!
B009SJ3H8Q|4.0|This was my TV destination in January.  I did like season 1 better, but this story was still very enjoyable.  I like seeing the cast playing different parts (acting).  The story had a nice payoff.  I think maybe season 1 was better because it was more focused on just one horror story genre/event....season 2 perhaps tried to take too much on.  (trying to avoid spoilers)
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Nice execution. Good graphics. Complicated while simple enough to learn. A little slow to progress but worth doing. Awesome for a free download.
B00BHU9BV6|4.0|It got bad reviews so I was skeptical but I was pleasantly surprised. Great acting by all, very artistic, great costumes and sets. You will experience the full range of human emotions
B0074V3712|4.0|Wilson does it again, synthesizing recent scientific research to plumb its meaning for our view of human evolution.  In this book he goes further, venturing conclusions about human nature itself that have their underpinnings in that research.  Middle chapters in which he describes the research in some detail and argues against the simpler kinship explanation for the appearance of altruism in human nature bog down a bit.  But it's a must read for anyone interested in keeping up with current thinking about evolutionary psychology.
B005C8ENI0|4.0|I thought the way the Lawyer tricked the defendant was pretty smart.  I always enjoy trying to get ahead of the story and think like the writer!  It was a great movie!
B009IH0ICG|5.0|I usually don't need to light 5 pounds of charcoal, which is what the regular size charcoal chimney holds (12 inches tall and 7.5 inch diameter).  This one is 8 inches tall with 5.75 inch diameter and will hold a bit over a pound of lump charcoal.  So it is much easier to start the small amount appropriate for cooking indirect on a Weber CharQ or for a low and slow fire in a ceramic cooker.
B009KEN87O|5.0|There are so many different levels and different things you have to do, I could not stop playing!! I wish there was more because I already beat the game
B00499NHLC|4.0|I vacillated between a three- and four-star rating.  I've always been a great fan of Sherlock Holmes since reading all of the original Conan Doyle stories some fifty years ago.  Generally, I've liked movies that have stayed close to the original plots.  I detest the Robert Downey, Jr. fims that, while staying in the Victorian era, turn Holmes into a kung-fu fighter.  This series moves Holmes and Watson into the 21st century and &#34;modernize&#34; the stories -- adding smart phones, internet searches, and updating stories and villians to suit today's social trends.  This is often intellectually interesting, causing one to reflect on how many of the original plots often depended on the time it took for information to be communicated.  In many cases, even an old-fashioned telephone call could have averted a desperate carriage ride at break-neck speed. While the personalities of Holmes and Watson remain basically intact, I find Benedict Cumberbatch to be among the more annoying portrayals of Holmes I've seen (barring Downey, of course).
0547884591|5.0|Buy this book.  Even if you already know how to cook, the recipes are killer, and you get great insight into all things learning quickly.
B0081336FO|4.0|See my review of Season 1.  My feelings remain the same, though I am obviously interested still interested enough to be watching Season 2.  This season adds the additional intrigue of seeing how some of the most famous Holmes stories (A Scandal in Bohemia, Hound of the Baskervilles, The Final Problem) are transformed and interpreted.<br /><br />For serious Holmes fans, I highly recommend the recent book &#34;The House of Silk&#34;, purportedly written by Watson but put under seal for 100 years because of the sensitivity of the events.  While the crime has timely modern aspects, the style is wonderfully indistinguishable from the writing of Conan Doyle himself.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I liked it- good writing and interesting plot. Katniss is a strong character. Peeta's devotion is commendable. It's very good
0307887898|5.0|As this book makes clear, a startup is not just any entrepreneurial venture. If you're buying an existing business or franchise, or starting a business in an established field, there are many sources of information and guidance on how to proceed. This isn't one of them.<br /><br />Ries defines a startup as &#34;a human institution designed to create a new product or service under conditions of extreme uncertainty.&#34; This book is aimed at guiding entrepreneurs through the process of reducing the uncertainty and finding a match between the founders vision and the wants and needs of the marketplace. The earlier in the process you read this book, the better.
B00BQBNK04|5.0|I love this soundtrack. Listening to it is like watching the movie in my head!! If you like the movie, you will certainly enjoy the soundtrack.
0984999302|4.0|The author indicates in his introduction that this book isn't intended to be read straight through, like a novel. Nevertheless, the structure is somewhat confusing. The step-by-step process he lays out in the initial chapters makes sense, and the tasks and things to consider during each step are valuable, but it's easy to lose track of which step in the process he is discussing.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|What can I say?  It's Bruno Mars.  He's inventive, talented, hyper and sexy.  What a great CD. Highly recommend it.

B004SOR4H6|3.0|I avoided joining the Twitter universe for a long time. I finally gave in when my department at work joined Twitter. I thought I should follow my own department. I've added a few people to follow since then, but I've deleted more than I've added because some people just tweet way too much. Sorry, folks, your lives just aren't as interesting as you think they are. I find that the few celebs I follow use Twitter mostly to sell their books or movies or whatever. Jim Irsay is a hoot - you can tell when he's bored as he tweets non-stop. (For non-Indianapolis Colts fans, he's their owner). I don't check it every day (nor do I check Facebook every day - I work two jobs and I do have a life outside work) and I'm not sure how valuable this service really is. I don't know how others can follow several hundred people on Twitter. But to each his/her own. At least I know what it's all about now!

B008MF3OEY|4.0|This is a great cover for your Kindle Fire. It fits snugly around the Kindle and is a hard cover. There is no padding, but the outside is quite sturdy. The design isn't flashy, but is still quite attractive. The best part is the spine of the cover, which resembles the spine of an antique book. It's a great addition, and the more paranoid Kindle owners could stash their device on a bookshelf and no one would be the wiser.
B00BHMF578|4.0|Good Movie! An honest and straight forward dramatization of the event that occurred towards the end of the Carter administration.
B0042J6VUS|2.0|If you don't use a case for your phone this might work.<br />But taking apart an Otter case to tripod the phone is too much trouble when, if it opened only a 3/4&#34; more, it would be a breeze.
B00063F8B2|3.0|Not my type of music, however, I am sure other music lovers might enjoy this CD.  The Polar Express was such a great movie that I just wanted to own the CD.
B0032KLAKE|1.0|Again.  I don't like your service that keeps cutting me off in the middle of a movie I am watching and then tells me I can't resume.
B009KEN87O|5.0|This game would have been right at home in 1987! Fun, easy to control, and entertaining! Give this one a try!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|.....and they did. Well thought out clean design with everything you need.<br />If you are going to get a battery app, get this one.
B000SEIKIW|4.0|Most of the the book was written a way that made understanding the more basic theories easy and entertaining. However the more complex theories were harder to wrap my head around, even through basic example. Overall, the book was great and informative, and a must read for everyone who wants to know the why and how of the complex world we live in
8866134627|5.0|Great moleskine. Love it. Perfect for my new job. Great book to ave at meetings and such. One two three

B00BSBY38A|5.0|Excellent movie.  Everyone should see this visual tour de force by Ang Lee.  He is at his greatest here.  Enjoy!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I enjoy playing this game when I am relaxing.  It  has a good degree of difficulty an the tiles are well defined and easy to read.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I have watched this over and over.  I have other versions of this movie and this is by far my favorite.  The acting is excellent.

B000JMKNV0|5.0|I saw the movie shortly after reading the book.  The book is much better, more cohesive.  Extremely well written, it holds you in almost breathless anticipation of the next page.  Highly recommend!!
B004H6G0TI|5.0|Normally, I don't write reviews. I only do so for games that are really good in my opinion that don't have many reviews at the time. So here is my opinion on the game so far.<br /><br />Graphics: 10/10: Everything looks smooth and colorful, and the sprite animations are nicely done.<br /><br />Music: 9/10: The music is mostly classical, but it somehow fits the frantic mood of the game.<br /><br />Customization: 9/10: (Kind of a weird category, I know) From what I've seen, there are about fifty different planes you can choose from once they're all unlocked, and each plane has it's own stats. However, I haven't seen a designer, which isn't a huge deal, but it'd be cool to make a custom plane.<br /><br />Controls: 10/10: The game controls very well. You get a large on-screen joystick on the bottom left of the screen, and a single fire button on the bottom-right. The joystick responds well to your movements, and you pretty much just have to keep your thumb on the fire button, as I haven't seen any reason to let off it.<br /><br />Gameplay: 10/10: Amazing gameplay. basically, the aforementioned joystick controls all movement. If you want to fly in any direction, move the joystick in that direction. To fire, obviously, you tap the fire button. to keep firing, hold down on it. In each level, you get a certain number of waves of enemies, and you have to destroy them all before they destroy you. If you DO get destroyed, worry not! You have three lives, and extra ones are available as pickups in the levels! (although, later ones, I'm not sure of.) If you fly too low, you get a &quot;Low altitude&quot; warning. fly too high, and your plane stalls. Hit the ground, you die. get shot too many times by enemy planes, you die.<br /><br />Other notes: I haven't gotten to experience multiplayer yet, but I can imagine it would be awesome, especially with a lot of friends playing at once.<br /><br />Also, I got the game on March 24th, 2013 when it was the FAOTD, but would definitely payfor it.<br /><br />Verdict: Get it, whether it's still the FAOTD or not. It's awesome!<br /><br />-Nashew-
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My son had this game on his i-pod, so as soon as I got my kindle I started looking for it! I love taking care of my horse and the competitions. I recommend this game to all ages!
B007Y612KA|5.0|The movie's look and feel is very early 1900's. It is awesome! They did a really great job of making the effects not look modern. I love that the robots in the movie were obvious fake looking things, like as if the movie was made in the early 1900's. Great story
B001J1PT82|5.0|This wonderful early Polanski masterpiece exudes quality along multiple dimensions: comedy, music, plot, and character development. The plot keeps moving forward, and so does your satisfaction level.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love buying books on my kindle. So easy. If you like fifty shades of gray, you will like this book
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|wife and I are in our 40s, have 4 kids and have enjoyed most of Apatows work. so this should have been right up or alley and very relateable, instead, this movie was brutally awful. I actually like my wife and these two hate each other. I don't think we laughed more then a few times in the two plus hours and found next to none of it to relate to us at all.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|it is fun game you will like it a lot<br />it is a good you will all will like it a lot
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this App! Digital Bibles have come a long way since my first Franklin in the 90's. Having access to so many versions is great. However you do need Wi-Fi for most of them, unless you download some of them, and only a few are available for download. Fortunately, I have Wi-Fi at home and at church and can easily switch between all versions for comparison or to follow along if a preacher or teacher at church is using a different version. The only drawback is that depending on the version the formatting of the Bible text is different and although you can change the font or text size some versions are better laid out then others. For instance I am currently reading through the Bible in a year using the Amplified version, which has been great to read in that version, but the formatting is less than desirable and packs the text all together tightly without enough breaks making it hard to follow, and I often lose my place. In contrast the ESV is very nicely laid out with headings, subheadings and nice breaks in the text for sections and paragraphs.  I really like the option on the yearly reading plans to update your progress so when you miss some days reading it catches up the readings to the current date so you don't miss any of the bible, if you fall behind.<br />EDIT: I previously complained the app store had an older version but am happy to report that Amazon finally updated to the newest version. Good job Amazon!<br />Amazon, please continue to update your apps more frequently.
B000S1M9LY|3.0|It was dense and difficult to read - definitely not the type of book you cannot put down.  I actually read three other books while reading this book as my interest would wane after a couple hundred pages.  Still not quite sure what I make of it.
B007I8S1TY|5.0|This is a fairly advanced book that is absolutely loaded with information.  The writing is very good and the examples are excellent.
0930289234|5.0|Interesting twist on the superhero story with fantastic visual representations.  You won't be able to put it down once you pick it up!
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Sparks is a good writer. I mainly like his development of characters and his exploration of difficult issues, in this case--physical abuse of women.  I found the ending overdone,  but maybe that's because I don't like thrillers.
B004NEY9EW|3.0|Better if watched immediately after Casino Royale.  Otherwise, it is in the bottom half of Bond films.  Not as bad as Die Another Day, though.
B004SDSSFY|1.0|I believe I wasted 15.00 on this product.  It didn't allow me to do anything differently than I could before I bought it.
0307887448|4.0|This was a fun book to read. Was the story predictable? absolutely. Was there too many specific references to video games, 80's TV and entertainment? Yes, but does that make it a bad book? Not on your life. If you like action and adventure and 80's arcade games you will enjoy this one. I'm not giving the story 5 stars because the villain of the story kind of just fizzled out at the end. This could actually be made into a pretty cool movie if they can recreate the OASIS on film. With special effects these days it should be possible and would be great escapism for the movie goer. I also, liked the message of the story at the end. If you're looking for something fun to ready pick this one up.
B004EPYZSK|4.0|\\"Cowboys and Aliens\\" is one of those movies you simply have to check out just because of the title. Even more so when you find out it stars Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford.<br /><br />Well, it isn't quite the awesomefest that the title would lead you to believe, but it is an entertaining Western-with-a-sci-fi-twist with some unexpected twists and a cast of magnificently talented actors. The aliens' reason for being on Earth is kind of flimsy, but if you can ignore that, then enjoy some energy-blasting action, creepy aliens and strong performances from ALMOST everybody.<br /><br />A man (Daniel Craig) wakes up in the desert with no memory of who he is or how he got there. The only clues are a mysterious wound in his side, and a metal bracelet on his arm. After kicking bandit butt, he rides into the nearby town of Absolution and quickly gets arrested, since it turns out he's a wanted outlaw named Jake Lonergan, who's stolen gold and is suspected of murdering a prostitute.<br /><br />But his imprisonment is interrupted twice -- first by the dictatorial ex-soldier, Colonel Dolarhyde (Ford), and then by alien ships swooping in and kidnapping several people. Jake also discovers that his metal bracelet can fire blasts of energy that destroy one of the alien ships.<br /><br />So the remaining townsfolk (plus a dog) all set out to pursue the alien ships, and get their loved ones back. But a mysterious woman (Olivia Wilde) eventually reveals that she has special knowledge of these aliens -- and the key to defeating them may lie in Lonergan's blocked memories. Can a bunch of cowboys and Indians take down a spaceship of roaring green aliens?<br /><br />I was expecting \\"Cowboys and Aliens\\" to be a tongue-in-cheek romp like the original graphic novel (which has nothing in common with the movie except... well, cowboys and aliens) or a fast-paced sci-fi flick. Well, it's actually neither -- director Jon Favreau instead makes it a Western that happens to be about cowboys vs. extraterrestrial monsters.<br /><br />This is paced and filmed as a Western movie, with lots of dusty rides through the desert that Favreau uses to flesh the characters out. But he keeps things from getting dull by plopping in a bunch of alien attacks -- a particularly nice one is a dank, rainy battle in an upside-down riverboat -- before the story suddenly switches gears in the last reel, turning into a solidly explosive sci-fi finale.<br /><br />The one big problem? The reason the aliens came to Earth is weak and contrived, and it doesn't explain why they keep going out of their way to kidnap humans. I guess it's... because they're evil?<br /><br />But the acting is mostly pretty awesome. Daniel Craig is effectively playing an outlaw James Bond, who is almost superhumanly cool, capable and badass even with his bare hands. He's so awesome that he can beat up whiny rich brats with a single move, without even bothering to look at them. Yeah, it's not much of an acting stretch, but Craig pulls it off well.<br /><br />Ford seems to be relishing getting to play a cranky, vicious old buzzard who constantly threatens and berates everyone around him, but learns a little something about the value of forgiveness. Clancy Brown is solid as a kindly preacher who serves as the film's moral center, and Sam Rockwell gives a simply magnificent, understated performance as Doc, a bartender whose wife has been kidnapped. You really feel that this guy's life is crumbling to dust, and that he's lost faith in everything.<br /><br />The one true acting dud? Noah Ringer. Please, stop letting this kid act -- he's effectively a blank wall for Ford to bounce character development off of. And since Adam Beach is also in this movie to develop Ford, he's also useless.<br /><br />\\"Cowboys and Aliens\\" has some flaws, but overall it's an entertaining Western that happens to have lots of murderous aliens and excellent performances. Yee-haw!restrial monsters.<br /><br />This is paced and filmed as a Western movie, with lots of dusty rides through the desert that Favreau uses to flesh the characters out.

B007FY9ZWI|4.0|It has more options for music playback.  It has a Video tab in the library, so it might be more than just a music player, but I haven't tried watching any videos with this player yet.
B009KUANWG|5.0|It would be difficult for me to find something that I DON'T love about the latest Bond movie, \\"Skyfall.\\" But one of the things I loved best about it was Adele's theme song, also called \\"Skyfall.\\" I'm not surprised that this song ended up winning an Academy Award for \\"Best Original Song\\" -- it's a majestic, soaring song that is tied tightly into the plot of the movie, but can also be appreciated on its own, as a love song.<br /><br />It begins with a blare of brass and a gentle ripple of piano. \\"This is the end/Hold your breath and count to ten/Feel the earth move and then/Hear my heart burst again,\\" Adele croons softly, sounding resigned whatever is happening. But strings begin to creep into the song, and by the chorus we're in full orchestral mode laced with that hard-edged Bond sound.<br /><br />Actually, it sounds less like a Bond song, and more like a sort of apocalyptic hymn as she sings, \\"Let the sky fall, when it crumbles/We will stand tall/And face it all together!\\" The song uncoils after that like a sonic rose, unfolding new layers of dark horns, violins and a soaring winged finale that leaves your heart pounding.<br /><br />\\"Skyfall\\" is a song that is both simple and complex -- it's got a seventy-seven person orchestra playing under J. A. C. Redford, and it has countless layers and harmonies sweeping together. The James Bond theme is woven in as well, but it feels natural and not like it was prodded in to make it more recognizably a Bond song -- it has its own sound and rhythm.<br /><br />Instead of a pop song, it's a deep, rich ballad that starts off on a funereal, almost defeated note, only to blossom into fiery, powerful determination by the end. And the lyrics are tightly tied to the actual plot of the movie \\"Skyfall\\" -- just look at lines like \\"Skyfall is where we start,\\" \\"I've drowned and dreamt this moment\\" and \\"we will stand tall/and face it all together/at Skyfall.\\"<br /><br />But the lyrics and imagery are also vague enough that it can be appreciated as a powerful love ballad in its own right, about triumphing over the odds with the help of one who loves you (\\"I know I'd never be me without the security/Are your loving arms keeping me from harm/Put your hand in my hand and we'll stand\\"). And Adele is... well, Adele. Her voice is rich, soulful and full of soaring emotion, and she sounds like she put all her heart and soul into this song.<br /><br />\\"Skyfall\\" is a fitting song for the brilliant new Bond movie, in just about every way -- it's a bittersweet, rich, haunting experience that demands to be heard again and again. And it just made a new fan of Adele.ated as a powerful love ballad in its own right, about triumphing over the odds with the help of one who loves you (\\"I know I'd never be me without the security/Are your loving arms keeping me from harm/Put your hand in my hand and we'll stand\\").

B002LAM7PI|5.0|I love this movie. It's only vaugely related to the book it'sbased on, but the changes really help adapt the story to film and provide much needed exposition.  The detail and smoothness of movement of characters and objects is astounding (especially compared to the claymation stop motion of the '80's, remember the California raisins?).<br /><br />I've given this movie to my nieces and nephews, ages 2-10.  There are some scary moments, but the even the littlest ones aren't so scared we have to stop the movie.<br /><br />3D gives me headaches, so I don't know how well it works.  I bought the version with a blu-ray and DVD because i dont have blu-ray in every room.  I would really like to have the digital copy as well, to play on tablets or phones, but the digital copy that comes with the box expired long ago.<br /><br />I can watch Cocaine over and over.  Even my cat will stare at the screen for the first twenty minutes; she loves the little sounds!
B0067AC5KA|5.0|Even having seen both movie versions, the books captivate this reader. One cannot put the book down and turns pages into the early morning hours.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|my new favorite game-very addicting.  Just plain fun to play and works every time.  Easy to play so far but just tried 1 level to date
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I really really enjoyed this book and I actually bought a copy for a friend of mine who loved it too (he's a chemical engineer and I was sure he'd like all the references to all little science projects described in the book). The book has a great story and routinely had be laugh loud. It also managed to never bore me. Anyways, IMHO you cannot go wrong buying this book.<br />More of these please!
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|The action scenes are always there but this movie falls way short when it comes to storyline.  I was actually bored watching the last hour of this movie.  The villain is unbelievable as a bad guy and the acting was stiff and uninspired across the board.  Glad that the female \\"M\\" is now gone though - never liked her.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is awesome.  I am so addicted I Play ever chance I get.  This is a home-run in my play book!  Works great on my K-fire.  I recommend this game to everyone..
B000N2HBSO|4.0|This book gives insight into the problem slavery caused our nation and what lead up to the civil war.  Also into the kind of person Lincoln was.
B00012QM8G|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie you should! It is really sad but life changing in that it makes you see WWII like you can't from books. The acting is fantastic. The love and hate shown by people in this story is both shocking and touching.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Berry very very  Very very addictive. Get this game even if you don't have enough money. Very very good game
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|I enjoyed Ted. There where a lot of funny scenes, now the story line wasnt that good but for an unrated movie it was kinda cute. Now there was a lot of f bombs and sexual scenes but overall t was good. The only bad thing was the storyline. If i was you i would rent it not by it, but it was good. 8.5 out of 10
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Very addicting. I START playing then I  CAN'T PUT IT DOWN.<br />YOU SHOULD GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!! GET IT I TELL YOU GET IT!
B00000K3D4|5.0|I love this movie! From the storyline to all the songs, I love it all. It just brings back some great memories. And the fact that David Bowie is the main star just tops it off.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|Javier Bardem is awesome, but the ending is really anti climactic in my opinion<br /><br />Otherwise this is a must see for bond fans. Much better than quantum of solace.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Purchased this for my daughter for Christmas.  Seriously, who doesn't love Sons of Anarchy?  She absolutely love it and so did I.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Muy buena edición, presentación de lujo y sobre todo incluye entre otros idiomas el castellano que es de agradecer. Muy recomendable.

B00BSBU4EC|4.0|This was a very enjoyable movie. Usually I half watch the kid shows while my daughters watches. This one I couldn't take my eyes off.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|The historical background of today's current diets and the presentation of evidence to support the carbohydrate hypothesis is thorough and convincing. I enjoyed the book from a personal perspective and a educational prospective as a future nutritionist.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|We love it! I got it for my daughter's 12 th birthday . She has watched it at least6 times and knows every single song. All girls and boys very talented.

B008C20TDG|5.0|Very informative. Cleared up some confusion of how the body and food works. Also gives you several recipes to choose from.
B0096CDG0O|4.0|Addicting!  Nice and fast, can play almost like you're playing in person.  Much better on my Android smartphone than my Kindle fire.  I think amazon has some updating to their apps that need attention.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fast download. Great series. Fuels the fantasies for all women. Smart and can t wait for the movie. I m two books in.
B0053O89XI|5.0|the season has complete hilarious episodes. Keeps you glued on the screen as you roll from one to the other. Nice Show!
B0009HLDFU|1.0|yeah the one star reviews make me NOT want to buy this album. why? well. I don't use the CD, but i prefer a quality rip to my ipod. i don't want to spend money on something that won't let a legitimate fan buy the music and use it as i see fit.<br /><br />so . . .<br /><br />not going to buy this album. sorry foo fighters. until i can get a quality rip from this and have a backup of the actual CD in full glorious 44.1 16bit. not interested.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I really like the way this game has been created for the kindle tablet.The graphics are terrific and bright, and float on the screen. T he game plays very well and responds easily and accurately by touch. I like it better on the kindle than I did on the pc. Great job!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like it. Graphics are great and really realistic. The game covered everything. Health, beauty, competition and jobs. Really is a great game.
B0034G4P94|5.0|I don't give too many movies 5 stars, but this is a 5-star sports drama.  It has a great compelling story involving two estranged brothers who through fate find themselves in the same MMA tournament, one fighting for his financial survival and the other out of the bottomless depth of deep bitter anger.  The story is captivating, the acting is first-rate; the fighting scenes are completely realistic, and the direction is crisp and clean.  There are no wasted scenes here; the director has a great scrip, great acting, and he knows what to do with both.  What results is a film that will engage your heart and emotions to such a degree that when the final climactic scenes arrive, you will literally be on the edge of your seat in anticipation.  It is that good.<br /><br />The casting for this film is a true knockout.  Nick Nolte is superb as the delinquent, alcoholic father of the warriors who is trying to pull together what is left of his life and make peace with his sons.  High praise for both Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy who carry the film on their muscular shoulders and big hearts.  Their fight scenes are as realistic as have ever been seen on film; it is  truly as though one is watching on pay per view.  Kurt Angle, the Olympic Gold Medal Wrestler, makes an appearance as the unbeatable Koba, the Russian  MMA fighter.  His menacing presence lends much excitement to the film.<br /><br />I certainly do not want to give the impression that this film is just about MMA fighting.  There are multiple layers of dramatic themes that are explored in depth.  If this were just a fight film, it would still be quite good, but the added drama drawn from the compelling story is what makes this film one you will remember and ponder.  I guarantee you will recommend this film to friends.<br /><br />I've seen a lot of sports movies in my life, but this is certainly in my top-10.  It is truly a gem of a film. It is most likely considered a \\"guy\\" film, but I believe the ladies will enjoy it as well.  Don't miss this one.<br /><br />koneas well.  Don't miss this one.<br /><br />kone
B000XUBFE2|5.0|We recently read this book for book club and everyone loved it.  The story is compelling and the narration from the perspective of Death added an interesting dimension.  May be one of the best books I've ever read.  I highly recommend this book!
B00B4VI8MQ|1.0|First it takes forever to download.  Second its not really free.  Waste of time.  Don't even bother with this crap!
B007QDNKQA|5.0|This movie has it's cheesy moments (like driving from Virginia to Montana overnight), but overall it is a great movie!  Special effects are great, and the plot is engaging.  I would highly recommend watching this movie if you are looking for an action/adventure flick!
B008C20TDG|5.0|I found this book to be very helpful in trying to change my eating habits.  Reading food labels is key!!  I feel great.  This book is a great resource.  Everyone should try to do the 30 day challenge, it's so worth it.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|Loved this series! I wish there was more. Still wondering what becomes of Thomas-Brenda....in this new world that they have entered.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|This DVD has some extra material on it with behind-the-scenes info. Personally, I don't need to hear all of the stars praising each other, but the show itself is wonderfully filmed so that you can see all kinds of detail in the set and costumes of the stage production that yo might otherwise miss in a live production.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Fast pace game with nice graphics. Highly recommended.<br />The game play is smooth. A very nice combination of match 3 with a story line and good variations on tha game board.
B001UW58WW|5.0|We originally discovered David Garrett on YouTube when trying to find a version of the theme music of &#34;Pirates of the Caribbean&#34;. He is an incredibly talented violinist with a fresh modern style that can appeal to very young listeners. His arrangements of modern music, incl. Michael Jackson, are amazing and a thrill to listen to.

B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Very fun game.  There were several different puzzles to make it very interesting.  The story line was good, the puzzles were challenging, and it's definitely a replayable game.
B00AIUUXHC|2.0|This game started out fun....untill you turn it off and all my progress along with the 25 bucks spent on gem and coin packages dissapered!!! As I said...starting out it IS a fun game_my kids think its the funnest thing ever but not if its going to rip you off....fix this problem and RETURN my money and I would be glad to give it a five star review!!
B001AVCFJM|5.0|This movie really helped to relaunch the Star Trek franchise that has been growing stale in fits and starts over the decades. It has everything one hoped a Star Trek film would have, minus the taking itself too seriously that has hampered other Trek films.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the story is just too similar to story and plot lines that Star Trek has recycled over and over again through the years.<br /><br />Let's hope the second film in this series has something a bit more original to the story.<br /><br />Recommended, though I wish I had waited until I owned a BluRay player to purchase this movie. This was one of my last DVD purchases, and it's a film that really benefits from HDTV viewing.
B00B2064IY|5.0|I love it  Each of the 12 tracks on this funked-up, energised, rhythm-heavy exercise in stripped-back post-psychedelia gets the rump shaking in the most emphatic way    Read more: [...]
B00BHU9DUK|2.0|Costumes were amazing.  But other than this I thought this movie was a very strange production.  The director's vision was not to my taste at all.  My thought... when this movie ended.... hmmm... I want 2 hours of my life back!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Good acting, plot moves along, not able to guess the next step in plot.  Much better than a staged :&#34;reality&#34; show
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|this movie sucked, never seemed to go anywhere , I would not recommend it to anyone..a waste of time and money
B00632HWOG|5.0|This is one of Yahoo's best apps.  You don't even need a computer to check your e-mail anymore with this handy app.  Gives you full functionality of your account.  It's better than the resident e-mail app on tablets and cell phones.  Haven't had any issues with the app.  Very reliable.  All your e-mail is retained in your main account so you don't have to worry about losing any e-mails.  I use it all the time and am not disappointed.
B00A5IYXY6|4.0|veryfilm very good movie, held my interest throughout, if only we Americans had more of this type of film, and less shot up bang um dead sensationalizing
B009MCRHH6|5.0|As far as games go, this one is good.  Unique in its idea, the game makes the user build paths for the &#34;goo&#34; to go to finish each level.  Complexity increases as one completes the levels and the challenge to develop each path is fun.  Great for kids 5 and up and even for adults.  Offers hours of mind-challenging fun.
B00BRR66SA|5.0|A great start to the 2 album set. An overall great listen from start to finish with a good flow. Questionable at times with the slow tempos, but a great album.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Great app if you want to watch or download videos to your phone or tablet.  Great for downloading videos ahead of time and watching them later or when no internet is available.  Fast and easy to use.  Definitely worth having if you are a big fan of You Tube.  Reliable app.
B00BEJL3IY|4.0|I liked this film and together with my 12 years old daughter we spend a nice moment watching it. It is however definitely not recommended to little children, like 10 and younger. This rfeview contains limited SPOILERS.<br /><br />This retelling of old tale of Jack and the Beanstalk is pretty well done, with many key ingredients of fairy tales well in place. There is a brave and ultimately quite clever farm boy (Jack), a cute and quite likeable damsel in distress, a noble king, his brave knights, a vilainous treacherous scoundrel, powerful magic items, a really REALLY BAD giant alpha (and beta) and a whole batallion of other giants, almost as dangerous as their two-headed leader.<br /><br />Past the first 10 minutes, the film is rather quick paced and visually it is very pleasant: the sky domain of giants, the giant beanstalks and the mighty royal fortress are really impressive. The desperate fight of royal army against the giants besieging the great royal castle is a particularly well done thing - I certainly appreciated that both humans and giants fight in a rather logical way and human army is definitely not a push-over...<br /><br />The best character in the film and a scene stealer is Elmont, a sarcastic noble knight commanding royal guard, played very VERY convincingly by Ewan McGregor who seizes this occasion to remind the public, that he once played Obi-wan Kenobi and that after all he killed Darth Maul and General Grievous and defeated and mutilated Darth Vader... Frankly, I almost expected Elmont to finally use his light-saber and I was very surprised when he didn't...<br /><br />Stanley Tucci who plays the main villain Roderick is another scene stealer, with his quasi Monty Pythonesque style - it is clear he had tons of fun playing in this film. Ewan Bremer, who plays his slightly deranged murderous sidekick Wicke, is another delight to watch.<br /><br />Compared to those three characters and to all the gallery of giants, both Jack and the Princess seem a little pale - this is the reason I give this film only four stars instead of five.<br /><br />Children younger than 11 can find this film TOO SCARY, as there are numerous scenes when giants EAT PEOPLE - and even if there is no gore and everything happens fast and is shown in some distance, the scenes are explicit enough to leave no doubt that a character had just his head and shoulders ripped of the rest of his body and swallowed by a enormous, ugly, very strong, very fast and very agressive monster.<br /><br />But bottom line, I liked this film and I spend a good moment watching it - and I think we will buy the DVD when it is available. Although not a masterpiece, this is a nice, easy, visually very impressive film.little pale - this is the reason I give this film only four stars instead of five.<br /><br />Children younger than 11 can find this film TOO SCARY, as there are numerous scenes when giants EAT PEOPLE - and even if there is no gore and everything happens fast and is shown in some distance, the scenes are explicit enough to leave no doubt that a character had just his head and shoulders ripped of the rest of his body and swallowed by a enormous, ugly, very strong, very fast and very agressive monster.<br /><br />But bottom line, I liked this film and I spend a good moment watching it - and I think we will buy the DVD when it is available.

B007MB5OCE|4.0|I had a lot of fun reading this book. It was well written, the sentences flowed smoothly, and the characters were wonderful to meet. The only part I didn't like was the interview with the Prosecutor, it dragged on, and so I skimmed over it.<br />I particularly enjoyed the flashbacks in Allan's life, they reminded me of Forrest Gump.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|big size works fine. ads are small and it would be great if the ads where at the top. all in all it does the job.
6305265666|5.0|Love and Endearing Faith between a little girl and her father's teachings before his sudden death.  Being raised by his new wife and her daughters, the overwhelmed young lady is definitely harrassed and succumbed with her new family's distasteful way of ruling her upbringing until the meeting of the Prince who takes her away from this madness.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I like this temple run but its not better than the first. the should make it more like the first one.
B0063IH60K|5.0|it works so I guess that's all that really matters. kinda hate the ad thing tho but that's ok later
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I  really how manyenjoyed this movie the second time around.  I was surprised to learn the stars participating in the movie.
B0009UC810|5.0|great memories!<br />i missed the opportunity to view this classic on the big screen.<br />thankfully i purchased this DVD and i am very happy to have and enjoy the Widescreen 25th Anniversary edition.<br />do the same and ENJOY!<br />john j wedrall
B005LAIIFS|4.0|This movie covers fantasy characters we hardly hear about like the tooth fairy, sand man, jack frost and easter bunny, etc.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|the game is awsome, excellent fun and addicting. i love playing jewels star. it is a wonderful game. ilove it a lot
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Great fun for the whole family! Good graphics and story line. The KIDS EVEN have my mom playing! We need more games like this.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I'm at level 116, without having to spend diamonds I have not earned through the game, reviews saying you have to constantly buy items are wrong, there are several ways to progress through the game. I am not on facebook and have over 150 friends through the game, no connection or account through facebook is required. If the approach you are using is not working then try something different. I love this game
B000002KHY|5.0|James Taylor is one of my favorites, so yes...this is a great CD for anyone who likes him as a performer.
B00BEPVAV8|1.0|I have a five year old who was anxiously waiting to play this game but it doesn't work on our Kindle Fire.
B007712XAU|5.0|This needs no rating other than &#34;great&#34;. It's something you can watch over and over. Love Downton, can't wait until the next<br />new episode. This could go on forever!
B008645YH6|5.0|this album is so catchy and marinas voice is super unique to me, it's one of my favorite albums and the reason for that is i have way too favorite songs from this, it's quite hard to pick your favorite because every one is uniquely different and marinas voice makes it much better. maybe a bit better than TFJ??<br /><br />bubblegum bitch (7/10)<br />i like this song, especially the chorus but it's not one of my favorites but gives off a rock and roll kind of vibe i like it. this song had to grow on me.<br /><br />primadonna (8/10)<br />one of her singles and i'd say one of her most popular?? (maybe not???) this song is super poppy once the chorus passes and it's catchy. i didn't see why this one wouldn't be a hit ~anyways~<br /><br />lies (6/10)<br />i haven't really gave this song a really good listen so i can't really give it a good rating but seems catchy????<br /><br />homewrecker (9/10)<br />one of my favorite songs, the beginning is so calm and i absolutely love this lyrics and the beat. especially the line &#34;i break a million hearts just for fun&#34; and &#34;instead love and trust and laughter what you get is happy never after&#34; it seems when i listen to this album i always go to this song first.<br /><br />starring role (5/10)<br />i haven't listened to this song that many times, but one of those songs that i wouldn't listen to a lot so i can't judge with a big score, i guess this one has to grow on me but it's not bad.<br /><br />power and control (10/10)<br />this is one of my favorite marina songs that i literally once discovered it i couldn't stop listening to it. the chorus is super catchy and i just love everything about it. it didn't even have to grow on me either, this song is one of the best on here.<br /><br />living dead (8/10)<br />i kind of get an 80's vibe from this song, i love marinas voice in this song.<br /><br />teen idle (7/10)<br />not one of my favorite songs but i really like the lyrics in this one.<br /><br />valley of the dolls(10/10)<br />besides the creepy title which actually put me off on this song, when i first listened to this i didn't like it at all but it started to grow on me and it's one of my favorites, i totally thought this song was going to be really creepy but the melody in the song is really calm.<br /><br />how to be a heartbreaker (8/10)<br />another one of marinas singles which i think is cute when she says &#34;at least i think i do&#34;<br />i love this song and the beat but i wouldn't say would be one of my favorites but is close to it.<br /><br />radioactive (10/10)<br />this song is kind of unique to me and i absolutely love her voice here!<br /><br />not quite good at reviewing, there are other songs i didn't mention like fear and loathing and the state of dreaming but i'm going to give those a listen. if you haven't bought this you totally should.
B001O1O71C|5.0|Love this book it took me two days to read it. Although the ending is sad I love the book
B007THA4FI|4.0|Of course I read all of her \\"Harry Potter\\" books, so when I started this one it felt strange at first.  It's about perfectly normal people (for the most part) who have funny, scandalous secrets.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I love to play Solitaire and this is a great way to pass the time when traveling or at lunch to take a break from the hectic pace at work.

B0063IH60K|4.0|Love to play solitaire so this is another way to play when traveling or eating lunch at work.  It helps with the hectic pace.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I have read this entire series and each book is new and exciting! I have never been disappointed with one of them! The characters have so much personality and energy, you feel like you're in there with them! It's impossible to put down so make sure you have time to read from start to finish! Highly highly recommended!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Love to play with the kids to see how many we can get the perfect stars on.  We play together and it is great!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have read this entire series and each book is new and exciting! I have never been disappointed with one of them!

B009HQ9UHC|3.0|It's ok.  Alot like the other versions but you have to have a creative mind to build the vehicles to get to the end.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|MAN THESE HEADPHONES ARE THE BEST<br />WE GOT SOME HATERS OUT THERE TOO<br />Y'ALL NEED TO DO YOUR RESEARCH<br />THERE NOT LYING WHEN THEY SAY CELEBRITY'S USE THESE<br />I'VE SEEN ADELE WHERE THEM AND HOWARD STERN.

B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This is very entertaining and fun.  Lots of my sons friends play and they love it.  I would highly recommend.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|I bought this to add to my collection at home but didn't want to pay the price of a brand new set. Everything came looking like brand new still so I saved a lot of money and came out on top! The shipping was incredibly fast. Thanks!
B004SBS8LA|4.0|If you like the Angry birds you will like this just as much.  I enjoy setting the little birdies free!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It was good I like it it is a good book it was an amazing experience I think I will use it
B00AREIAI8|4.0|it feels like you have your own horse and tgere is really good graphics. it is addicting! the jumping and competitions are especially fun.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Fantastic show,scenery is perfect,clothing fits time and the acting is memorizing.You just want more.Can't wait till Easter Sunday for season3.
B000VOC90Y|4.0|Provides enough storage my son's 17&#34; laptop and school supplies, with plenty of protection.  The bag also looks cool and has multiple compartments.  The only isssue is with its size and storage adds a lot of weight and cumbersome for a ten year old boy, although he plays hockey and lugs around all his hockey equipment this is on the border of being to heavy for a full school day.
B007XHWROK|5.0|I am a 65 year old woman but I love his music.I still think he's a gay boy?What do you think?
140053271X|4.0|The advantage of the nook over a kindle is simplicity when you aren't buying a book (ie, when you're obtaining a digital backup of a physical book you own, library digital checkouts, or you're pirating one.)  All the books I buy are from Amazon, and so with the nook it won't sync those which is unfortunate.  But where it shines is when I refuse to buy a book because the publishers are being greedy (eg, Dance with Dragons by George RR Martin, game of thrones series...  The ebook costs more than a physical copy.  It even costs more than a physical copy translated into another language!  Give me a break!)  So anyway, when it comes down to piracy to keep the publishers in check - the nook is great.  You plug it into USB, it shows up as a drive on the computer.  You type in the name of a book into google and add \\"epub download\\" to the end, and somewhere on the first page of results is a working download (at least with every book I've had to try so far.)  Download that straight to the nook's drive letter and you're done.<br /><br />The main reason I wanted it originally, before I found out how incredibly easy the above was, was because of the shape and feel.  I love the shape and feel over the kindle.  But other than that and the simplicity I'd probably go with a kindle for legit purchases (also I'm pretty sure the nook has been officially abandoned by B&N, which will of course make any syncing that may have existed even more problematic in the future.)
B007MB5OCE|5.0|An extremely entertaining pass through history with a modern day tale of murder, elephants, and vodka, Allan lived many adventures in his 100 years. Without political or religious views to speak of (other than  a complete disdain for both) the protagonist manages to find himself at the center of many significant world shaping events of the last century. In some ways Allan reminds one of Forrest Gump in his ability to directly shape history but he does so in a most different way and with a different modern day story. The book was an enjoyable and entertaining read.
B00BSBVLF8|4.0|I looked forward to seeing this and then half way through I had second thoughts for four good reasons.<br />One...Can't tell the men from the woman.<br />Two....No face to relate to or a star to draw you in or pull for.<br />Three....Poorly edited and skips all around in two second looks, so you never get to really see anything.<br />Four.....Music was bizarre and could have been used so much better.<br /><br />Now...half way through the movie changes, and most of this is fixed. They even play Beetles songs some of us know. The talent level from start to finish is remarkable to say the least. The settings and costume, lighting and make-up are simply excellent. Good for the whole family to watch if you can get the kids to sit down that long.<br />The last half saved the film or I'd have given it 2 stars is all, but ended up liking it.
B000JMKNVK|5.0|Great read for a rainy day!  The villain is real and the story line is full of new developments to expand the characters!
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|Whether you or someone you know is ready to give up.....they need to see this movie.  Seems unbelievable...but we know it is true.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I needed a basic alarm, didn't need a lot of extras and this is what I found. The ads don't bother me as I'm not looking at it very much, I use it as a tool to wake me up. I wake up to a buzzer so I wouldn't use music or other sounds anyway. Great utility.
B001B3MCQK|5.0|Listened to this album in my youth, and enjoying listening to it now just as much!!  It's amazing!!!  Everyone needs to hear this album!
