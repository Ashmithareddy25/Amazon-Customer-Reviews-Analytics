1468161660|3.0|I liked it. But I struggled a little with it. I like a romance novel to uplift me. I don't like anything to do with death or serious health problems.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The ending is not what I expected. It's kind of a let down ending. I don't want to say why. Read it for yourself and find out why the ending to this good story sucks. But all in all its a good read. The book is always better than the movie. Happy Reading :)

B0054JZC6E|4.0|This variety of selected games is somewhat ok. In a way, it can be considered a game within a game. If you are getting this for your children, it would be a good game for them.
B0091REZMW|4.0|A few flaws are that the game force closes often when I visit other players. The special weekend code never works. the rooms should not take your energy so quickly.

B004K6LJ3W|4.0|Season 1 - Very inventive series, which morphs somewhat along the way during it's first 6 episode season.<br />A vampire. a werewolf and a ghost all share a small house in England. They desperately want to simply fit<br />in, be accepted and not hurt anyone. It's got a lot of dry wit and some real emotions as well, with strong<br />performances throughout. Someone remarked it's like `Seinfeld' with undead characters, and that is part<br />of the appeal early on, seeing these characters more in human, often humorous ways than in scary supernatural<br />ones. But over the course of the season, the supernatural and darker tones become more and more prominent.<br />This leads to some confusion in tone at times, along with some messiness as to just what the rules of the game<br />are for these creatures. There's also a few hard to take leaps of faith (e.g. a human character who hardly seems<br />fazed when he leans the true identity of our three leads.). When it first turned from `dramedy' to drama, and<br />the supernatural elements began to grow stronger I was very disappointed, as it seemed like the show was losing<br />what made it unique, but then it regained it's balance by amping up the emotions along with the other-worldly,<br />and making the characters' pain at being trapped between worlds, and their love for each other moving and real,<br />while avoiding (mostly) clich&eacute;s or the familiar. I'll be very curious to see where it goes from here.<br /><br />Season 2 - While still uneven at times, with it's goofy moments of humor not always meshing smoothly with it's darker<br />and more emotional sides, the series has grown a bit in it's 2nd season. While still not (for me) up with the all time great<br />series like The Wire or Mad Men or Breaking Bad, at it's best, it's an amazingly potent mix of heartrending drama, dark,<br />off-beat humor and some effective horror as well. But this is horror with all the rules reversed, with the `monsters' being<br />the human race, and the heroes our vampire werewolf and ghost who simply want to live like other people. At times, in<br />an odd way it reminded me of \\"Dexter\\", the outsider with scary possibilities, who wants to fit in. But whereas Dexter<br />is all about emotions repressed, here the emotions are on the sleeve (occasionally a bit too much, and there are a few<br />soapy moments).<br /><br />Much like the first season this starts strong, seems to lose its way a bit in the middle, with some forced humor, and<br />repetitive moments but finishes with such a kick that its easy to forgive any lapses. The acting is on a very high level,<br />the writing is witty and human, and the direction and camerawork can be very effective at creating mood and scares<br />on a TV budget. Not perfect perhaps, but it's a rare TV show that can make me think, laugh, cry, and send a shiver<br />down my spine all in one episode. Some great use of rock tunes to set the mood tops it off.<br /><br />Season 3 - I seem to be in the minority, but for me season 3 represented a bit of frustrating fall off from the preceding years,<br />although it still has it's share of strong moments, and the last 2 episodes are very powerful. But some of the earlier weaknesses<br />have gotten more prevalent; twists that seem a bit arbitrary, rules of its world that seem to shift to fit story convenience, story<br />lines that get dropped, character choices and complex morality that aren't really explored or are over-simplified, episodes that<br />seem a bit disconnected from the others.<br /><br />And some of the strengths are less played too; fewer ironic or emotional uses of rock music, fewer visually inventive scenes,<br />and most importantly, less genuine emotion, and more slightly histrionic soapy-ness. (Suddenly the characters seem to<br />cry in every episode, which starts to make those powerful moments lose their impact). And the questions of 'what are good<br />and evil in a complex world' seem to beless deeply explored than before.  (There's tremendous room to explore 'what is guilt'<br />'what is mercy' and 'what is evil' in this particular season, and in the end the answers given seem a bit too neat.)<br /><br />There are also episodes in the middle that feel a bit dull, as if treading water. Perhaps this season would have been stronger<br />as 5 or 6 episodes.<br /><br />Certainly good television, and worth watching, but for the first time I found myself less emotionally moved, and more apt to<br />find my mind wandering. The climax (which in some ways feels like a natural ending to the series) certainly makes up for a<br />lot of that, but not all of it.eeply explored than before.

B00328R21C|5.0|I put this together with my two young daughters who are even more excited about star wars than I am.  They have liked Legos and mega blocks since they could talk, and this is the first set we have put together.  The instructions were great, and this did not take that long to finish.  I will be getting more as a fun project to do with my kids.

0525953728|3.0|The book was written much like No Lone Survivor, but was not as readable.  In fact, I didn't finish it.
B004LK5CEE|5.0|Great rock movie! Love the soundtrack, love the actors/actresses (Kate Hudson). I am sure there was a better actor out there for the lead character, but he did well enough. The rest of the cast was spectacular. The ending is such a bittersweet ending. It is cathartic experience if you are a fan of rock n roll and the lifestyle that is associated with it. I really, really liked how there was not too much drug use, there was drug use, but not the type that caused unrepairable damage like suicide or some rock n roll cliche that turns characters against each other.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|Drop my phone from multiple angles and sides.  Still clicking and looking brand new.  Have not used the screen protector as of yet, but with my Zagg taking a beating.  It will be a new upgrade soon.  Actually, bought two of these cases.

0439023521|3.0|This review is from the thoughts of a pre-teen.  I read the book as a school assignment because I thought I might like it because of the action.  It was really hard to follow in the beginning when they talked about why they have hunger games.  When the action began it got better, but I guess it is not the same as seeing in a movie or on TV.  The theme of the book was a little dark, because I am a boy I like force, but this was scary.<br /><br />Children fighting until the last one standing really were what stood out in this book.  I think the author trying to make it look like the two main characters were good guys was not good, they did kill.  The coaches who were there to help them figure out how to win were okay.  Then for some reason there is this attempt at adding romance to the book, it did not seem to fit.  I guess I did not like the book, I do not like fantasy, and it is too farfetched, just like this book.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Excellent search application. Use it all the time for all my searches. Highly recommended for Kindle Fire I received as gift.
B008DL466C|2.0|Wiz Khalifa's latest album is nothing more than a huge dissapointment. With NUMEROUS pushbacks in the late 2012 you would think it was to make the product much better. But that didn't seem to be the case here. It's not anything but the lyrics that seems to be the problem here. If you wanna know how much money Wiz has and how much weed he smokes, just listen to this album. He makes more than an obvious point here in about 90% of the songs. I called [[ASIN:B004TP6O8O Rolling Papers [Explicit]]] a dissapointment because of the obvious attempts at mainstream pop status, but still a worthwile listen. His colab with Snoop Dogg on [[ASIN:B005PV1THC Mac & Devin Go to High School]] was a slight step in the right direction. O.N.I.F.C. (Only N**** In First Class/One Night In First Class) is the worst of all. And one would expect this to be good after the mixtape Taylor Allerdice, which was good as well.<br /><br />Production heren is good. You can tell that Wiz picked the beats that have the nice long vibing sounds, which is heard all over this album. The best songs on here are the ones he colabs with other artists. \\"Let It Go\\" has Akon singing the chorus around Wiz' braggadocious lyrics. \\"The Bluff\\" has Cam'ron spitting a good verse. Even 2 Chainz sounds refreshing on \\"Its Nothin\\". And his Taylor Gang crew members sound better than him on \\"The Plan\\" and \\"Medicated\\". The single \\"Remember You\\" with The Weeknd sounds good, but having Abel lead off the song and sing the chorus and has Wiz rhyme about something totally different makes the song almost a waste. There are a small number of solo songs that Wiz has that he can hold his own, but don't expect much from those.<br /><br />O.N.I.F.C. had the potential to be a good album. I for one is very dissapointed after all the pushbacks and delays, this is the best we as fans can get. I think I am done with buying Wiz Khalifa's materal, unless its Taylor Gang or any colaboration albums (*hint, hint* \\"How Fly 2\\"). Anything else will be downloaded. Peacedownloaded. Peace
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Great and sexy romance book. It had me reading a few lines ahead throughout the entire book because I just couldn't wait.

B005VTS4EY|5.0|Facinating game! Different concept. Each level challenges your problem solving skills and sequencing ability. The game is addicting and I look forward to each new challenge. They use angles momentum and timing which adds an unpredictability to solving the levels.n
0756655307|5.0|I got this book for my boyfriend for Christmas and he can't put it down. He loves it and I'm very glad I got it for him ! And I can't help steal it from him every now and then to check out the Spider-Man pages. Super awesome book! It has every character you know and many you don't. Full biographies for all of them. Really helps you learn all about the marvel world! Great buy.

B008QE9XD2|5.0|This film is pretty much of a underrated surprise from Tim Burton that it's a horror comedy that just did ok at the box office due to an unnecessary $150 million budget when the film looked more as an eighty million adapation of the original tv series that starred the late Jonathon Frid as the original Barnabas Collins who makes a cameo in the now big screen movie adaptation directed by Tim Burton, produced by Richard D. Zanuck in his final film before his death and starting Johnny Depp as Barnabas with his veterans from other Tim Burton films, Michelle Pfeiffer, Helena Bonham Carter and Christopher Lee. Barnabas had a life until he rejected a witch that cursed him into a vampire and now he awakes in 1972 with his family name somewhat needs to be restored and the witch Angelique wants to try to get rid of him and his family. Funny Stuff and watch for the funniest and craziest sex scene in recent memory with Angelique and Barnabas!

B00A9X9TIW|5.0|A mature and well written film. Direction, casting and CGI came together perfectly. Bruce Willis for once was not the all perfect hero is usually is made out to be.
0525952926|5.0|The book is in absolutely excellent condition, which I am happy about since it is a gift for my son who will be arriving home for a visit from where he works in Japan in a few weeks.  He is a great Ken Follett fame and it is hard to find books were he lives.  I had gotten him a Kindle but there are few places where he is able to download books.  He loves books so I am happy I can give him the next book in Follett's series that he is anxious to read.
B000SGSU58|5.0|I enjoy the Harry Bosch novel's so much. Following this detectives life book by book always has me on the edge of my seat. I truly enjoy coming across the other familiar characters along the way as well. Even if you read a couple novel's out of order, Connelly thoroughly explains the people and events so well along the way- it's like you haven't missed a beat anywhere.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I just started reading this book the other day, and I finished it the same day. I was reading it for over half of the day, only setting it down for lunch and supper! I can't WAIT for the next book, as The Mark of Athena exceeded my expectations.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I couldn't put this book down, it was so good. Then I got to the last page, turned it, and was shocked to see that was it. I don't know when I was last so disappointed in a book<br /> conclusion. I guess the rest of the story was too much to live up to.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book has a good plot. The beginning started off very slow but after a few chapters it became very interesting. I'm a sucker for a good love story
B002MQYOFW|4.0|ENCORE!  ENCORE!  Fast,enthralling read.  Have not seen the movie and probably won't  until I fully digest this satisfying banquet.  BRAVO!

0385341008|5.0|The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is a warm, witty, sometimes bittersweet novel that tells the story of the German occupation of Guernsey Island during World War II while creating a vivid picture of the island a year after its liberation, with a little of post-war London thrown in as well.  As a history buff interested in WWII, I found the story fascinating, but what really grabbed me were the characters.  The story is told entirely in letters (for you fellow English majors, it's an &#34;epistolary novel&#34;), and the authors skillfully create a unique voice for each letter writer, including a couple of sourpusses who are inadvertantly hilarious.  (Yes, I know they're fictional characters, but they're so well depicted that they seem real.)  The authors are equally deft at weaving the plot through the letters.  Many reviewers compare this novel to 84 Charing Cross Road, and it does have many of that book's strengths, but it reminded me even more of Up the Down Staircase in its tone, humor, skillful incorporation of the plot into apparently random letters, and occasional heartbreaking moments.  As you probably can tell, I highly recommend The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society to anyone who likes WWII-era fiction.

B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Gripping thriller based on cyber warfare. Can only hope that what goes on in this story isn't really going on. Unfortunately, it probably is and that's what makes it so scary. The story is a real page turner that is hard to put down.

B007THA4FI|3.0|I loved Harry Potter books, I really did, but the last thing I expected from this book is to be anything like Harry Potter. I expected the book for adults which has nothing to do with magic and everything to do with reality of our existance. I expected something along the line of Dikkens, along the line of my beloved Russian classics of 19 century. Based on the reviews I expected something maybe not as well written, but with similar subject matter like Dostoevsky.<br /><br />I am writing all of this to stress that the reason I disliked this book so much has nothing to do with me expecting something fun, light and entertaining. I did not. I also want to stress that it is all me, it is not the book's fault.<br /><br />Yes, the people in this book have to deal with terrible things. You name it it is there - abuse, poverty, drug use, more abuse, just plain out marriages that not working. It is all there, so in that sense it reminded me of Dostoevsky a little. Do you know what's different? I hated them all. It is so true that the person that had something worthy in him as a person leaves the book within first few pages.<br /><br />I did not expect the perfect people in this book, heck I would have been fine with wrecks of human existance, grey, almost dark characters. But I did not feel that one of them has a spark, something redeemable in him? Gogol, Dickens, Dostoevsky wrote a lot about horrible, miserable people, but they managed to make me feel for their characters, made me pity them. Those humans? I would not mind if they all would drop dead now. I pretty much could not stand most of them.<br /><br />For some reason when I read this book, I was also thinking of american TV show The Wire. Those who watched it may confirm that this show dealt with some of the darkest horrors of human nature and looked at those horrors very unflinchingly. But guess what? The worst criminal sometimes showed that they still had a little tiny something in them to remind us that they are humans. Not so much in this book as far as I am concerned.<br /><br />I deeply respect that this is the book JKR wanted to write and I think for what she wanted to convey, she wrote it remarkably well (thus three stars and not one out of respect for writing), but boy I despised her subjects and if this is the story she would continue telling in her next books, I do not care to continue reading them.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow!! Is what I have to say and a Big long SIGH..... Holder and Sky have quite a story, one I won't forget for a while. Sky (adopted as the story goes) has been home schooled her whole life, is not allowed to watch tv,internet, have a cell phone, E-reader, or anything that involves technology. Several of those are deal breakers for me, especially the e-reader.LOL She has been sheltered, except for her bestfreind Six, who has secretly given her a little taste of technolgy. Sky is high school age as well as Six. They eat ice cream and watching movies at Six's house. Six loves boys, but Sky feels nothing for any of them until Dean Holder steps back into life and sees Holder at the grocery store. While Six is away for 6 months, Sky and Holder meet and connect. Neither one of them is prepared for what life has to offer them. (neither was I)They form ties that make me shiver as they become closer, and realize that they knew one another 13 years ago. A riveting story and difficult to read as well at some points in the book. It teaches you about the many facets of love and how far you are willing to go for someone you do love, and how to forgive when you are not sure how or if you can.<br /><br />BTW love Amazon and my Kindle!!
B007FRHZ4A|5.0|Although I purchased another Angry Birds game that was not that great, this one can actually be realistically played with.

B00881VLCE|4.0|MORE FREE PICS! Nicer wilderness pics. Under water is great with the coral. more colors on the blan ones would be cool.
0393327655|1.0|I bought this book following seeing some excellent Sam Harris videos on YouTube and just from picking up he was part of the modern Atheist movement. The books starts really well but when you get to around chapter 4 or 5, Sam's views on Israel and the current interventions of America come out. Sam appears totally pro-war, his views on Israel are shocking, one line about how 'no neighbours could be as tolerant as the Israeli's have been about Palestinians' I found totally bemusing. He denounces Chomsky for stating America operates like a terrorist state and then goes on to detail a range of atrocities commited by Americans. This book feels like an argument for war with any under developed nation.<br /><br />I have read Dawkins & Hitchens and Sam should not be put in the same category at all. I would go as far as to say I hate this book and feel totally embarrassed for endorsing Sam Harris as a rational thinker. This book is for Atheists who watch Fox News - avoid at all costs!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is by far my favorite right now. Usually I don't like Nicolas Sparks's books but this one was amazing. I felt so connected to Katie. Like she was a real person. It was my safe haven from this boring world..
B005IQZB14|4.0|Definitely a woman who was the driver of her own life! I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for an interesting book.
B005K17RU0|5.0|The general layout is great and enjoy the extras such as the outdoor activities of health allergies etc. Great app!!! Safe to allow automatic update as well.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The book was so good that it smelled like poop that is mixed with the perfect throw-up<br /><br />Sincerely Dee Shanklin
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Reading them all right now... Can't praise them enough! I'm obsessed with them and look forward to the time every day when I am able to read the next chapter... And then next, and the next...
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie was very funny. Rebel Wilson is hilarious!!  My partner usually hates movies with singing and dancing but she even loved this movie and thought it was funny.  Well worth renting.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|I really enjoyed this game much more than Magic Academy.  The first game was much more of a hidden object type game which could be a bit tedious, while Magic Academy 2 had many more games and puzzles to figure out.  It wasn't too easy or too hard.  I have never given out 5 stars, but this one deserved it.  Great job Nevosoft!!!  I hope there are many more games like it.
B00AB0AR2U|2.0|more of an action movie than anything. not what i expected very disapointed. although seeing some of the original characters back was great the premise of the movie is way out there, one can have a suspension of disbelief but this one goes too far. Alice has cared about others which is what makes her character likeable, but giving her a daughter now? bad plot device.
0345803485|5.0|I loved the triology so much that now I'm reading them again.  This is the fourth time I've read them!!
0345803507|5.0|I liked it so much I've read it 3 times!!!  Too bad I don't know a Christian Grey!!  There needs to be more books about Christian Grey!!
0345803493|5.0|Fifty Shades Darker is great, I really enjoyed this book, so much I've read it 3 times!!!!  Can't wait for more books about Christian Grey.  I'm so glad that a friend got me to reading these books.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|The game is great but where's the new update? This is getting ridiculous. The update has been out for the free version in google play for almost a month. I paid for mine and I keep checking for an update but its not there. Come on Amazon get it together.
B003L77TZI|5.0|Its exactly what you expect it to be. Case was chipped and broken in the package but thank goodness the cd was unharmed so not to big a deal but not great either.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|The jungle Book was one of my favorites growing up and now that I am a mother of a 3 year old little girl I was so glad to be able to purchase this classic on DVD.  The songs are wonderful and are up beat and our little one was off the couch in a shot to dance along with the music.  What I like about this as an adult is the story of how creatures band together to protect a child very different from themselves.  It doesnt matter where you live, look like or believe.  All that does matter is knowing the differences in us all should not stand in the way of protecting another being, in this case Mowgli, a little boy.<br />I cannot stand modern cartoons and I will not watch them. The Disney classics are enjoyable even over and over again.  As far as feedback for the seller, package arrived very prompt and even though the case was damaged the discs work fine.  Thank you.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is great you can unlock games just by using points from other games and they give you 250,000 points for giving it a review but that is not the only reason that this review is a good one
B00A23MVHA|5.0|Very funny movie will watch over and over again!!!!! Will recommend a older audience though with all of the adult content and swearing!!
B007KOLNXC|5.0|Mad Men season 5 does not disappoint. Fat Betty is hysterical. Don Draper is as gorgeous as usual. Joan and all the other main characters are terrific this year as well.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I've only watched the 1st and 3rd of the Trilogy movies so far, but both were exceptional.  Video and audio excellent.
1451695195|5.0|I've read 2/3 so far.  It is very well-written and inspiring!  I keep looking forward to reading some each night before bed.  I am glad Dr. Alexander decided to share his amazing story!
B007MDB6L0|5.0|4 year old loves Tink and this movie was a great treat from Santa!  Story line holds her interest, as well as mommy's!
B000V7H7HG|5.0|Our 3 year old grand daughter loves the Schleich animals and was improvising fences before we gave this to her. Like the snap together feature of the fence.
B00AMBLDEE|2.0|The plot was pretty thin and didn't have nearly the character development that the first three movies had.  The drug-driven plot was not very interesting and was almost entirely inconsistent with the first three movies.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Wow. This story was absolutely incredible. Reading the nearly unanimous positive reviews, I knew it would be good, but I still held some trepidation that it would be truly excellent. I was wrong. The story was captivating, with just the right amount of detail. The size and grandeur of it constantly rose in a crescendo that exploded in the possibilities that could follow.<br /><br />I will definitely be eagerly awaiting the sequel.
B005HSL626|5.0|I am so glad we downloaded this for the kids!  The kids love it!  They have played it non stop!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Loved this book can't wait to read the last one , very well written , I couldn't put the book down
B00AMBM9MO|2.0|If you like family guy type humor, you might like this one.....otherwise you will think it was a terrible movie like I did
B009HEJXFS|5.0|This one was a great surprise. Part one was great, part 2 was good, but part 3 really did a nice job. I sure hope there will be parts 4 and maybe more in the future...
B004J4WKTW|2.0|I wanted to love the whimsical and detailed characters so richly presented but was lost in the tangle of chapters of misdirection of first person or third or what ever was being used.  The books' plot was well thought out and  I was anxiously wanting to see how the next chapter would continue and then it would take several  chapters to even get back to the original characters scene, disappointing.  I think if it would have been edited and the characters explored more in-depth the book could be a comparable serial.
B007N8RULO|5.0|Great game. Comparable to the one on Windows. Every once in a while freezes but it's smooth, fun and addictive.
B0086700CM|5.0|I recommend it for everybody. I have this on my phone and kindle fire. I love it better than my peeps
B009VLX8FS|4.0|I haven't gotten through the whole thing yet, but its good so far.  I like the cover and the songs.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|My aunt said you have to get this game I thought it didn't sound like to much fun so I was reluctant. Once I loaded it my husband and myself can't. put it down. Very fun game enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!
B00APUQH0W|5.0|The movie was good, a great feel good story. Clint Eastwood can still create movies worth watching more than once.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|John Scalzi triumphs in a spectacular portrayal of humanity in the context of space warfare and colonial defense.  The universe that Scalzi creates is woven expertly with elements of science fiction that brilliantly are made plausible in the context of this story.  Thoroughly enjoyed this book!
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|this book was awesome!i loved it so so much. the rest of the series is gonna be really awesome. cool
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|This movie was funny as hell that is why I rated it with 4 stars and because it had nudity in it of course!!
B0086700CM|4.0|I think you should give me this game because I need more hams on here so can I get this please. for my sister baby
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Another excellent Jack Reacher story.  He is not as much of a loner in this one, but there is still plenty of the usual.
B008220C38|5.0|Tom Stoppard returns to his Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead roots in this great adaptation of Anna Karenina.<br /><br />For those reviewers who do not understand why this movie mixes stage and realism, note that the \\"staged\\" scenes happen when people are in \\"society\\" having to pose and act according to societal rules. People are themselves when off the stage. This is why love scenes outside the public eye happen in a field or on a farm, etc.<br /><br />What I most love about this film version is that Stoppard rightly gives fair play to the Real love story, that between Kitty and Konstantin.<br /><br />The entire movie is a contrast between self-indulgent love and selfless love, and how each couple violates societal rules with their love.<br /><br />Anna and Count Alexai engage in a self-indulgent love, violating societal rules, wanting society to change and accept their love so they can still be a part of society. (To be fair, this is more what Anna wants than Count Alexei.)<br /><br />Kitty and Konstantin (with Kitty's help) on the other hand break societal rules for truly selfless reasons, and do not care a whit when society expects them to suppress selfless love. They love truly, whereas Anna and the Count do not (even though theirs is an emotionally compelled love. Because it is self-indulgement and because Anna still cares about society, she is driven to her end because she cannot selfishly have both.)<br /><br />Endless academics and politically correct interpreters of Tolstoy would have you believe that through Anna Tolstoy is making a commentary on the suppression of females by society. But that is not what Tolstoy is doing.<br /><br />He is contrasting types of love in the context of society. The quality of that love determines the personal and societal experience. Stoppard rightly highlights the contrasts.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|Ian McEwan knows his craft well. History, mystery, romance in a great page-turner. I couldn't put it down. Highly recommended.
B007FEFLTO|2.0|Very disappointed in this book.  First book was better, but not by much.<br />Simplistic, no in depth characterizations.  Jumps from one well known historical event to another.<br />Will not read the third book.
B00AHQNHSY|2.0|It is okay but I seem to have better luck using MX player with the content I view. YMMV depending on your content.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Have you ever eaten something and after the first bite you are amazed by the excellence of your choice. Wool is like that experience. I read and read, savoring every twist and turn and upon completion sated, but anxious for more if it comes to fruition. Read Wool you will not regret a moment of it.
B00AE2I4WK|3.0|I've seen all the Step Up movies. I'm a fan of dance, and I have watched a lot the So You Think You Can Dance seasons, so I've seen many of the dancers in this movie before. I don't go into these expecting Oscar performances. The acting was pretty bad in this one, worse than the previous 3. The script might have been the real problem, I'm not sure acting could have overcome it. That said the dancing was good, but not great. It's been better in previous Step Up movies. This is just another one. Straight to DVD wouldn't have been an insult for this movie.<br /><br />Also, the lead male character couldn't dance well enough to keep up with the dancers in the cast. They hid his dancing throughout the moving, just as they did in the previous 2 step up movies.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|I downloaded this on my I-pad and now the kids spend so much time playing that I have trouble getting my I-pad back! Still it's worth seeing all the smiles.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|The movie is great. Good way to end a trilogy. I'll leave the movie review for others. The Blue-Ray is good, but at first I thought something was wrong with it because it kept switching aspect ratios. But that is to accomodate some the IMAX content, as google taught me later. I'm a noob to Blu-ray so I don't know if this is common or not. The sound effects overpowered some dialog just often enough to be a little annoying, but I know that's common.
1449417051|4.0|It's The Oatmeal in a book.  Cats, pandas, bears, and even a poster. If you're a fan this will save you starting your computer to explain, if you're not a fan this may need some explaining!
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|I was expecting to be rolling on the floor laughing based on reviews, but this really was just okay. I guess I shouldn't have expected more out of a comedy about a talking teddy bear.
B006ZNRD06|2.0|for about a week, i was watching movies on my kindle fire hd and it worked great... no problems. now its freezing my kindle and apparently this is only a demo version that youll have to pay for if you want it to keep working.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I had to read this book as a read for my monthly book club... Was not really looking forward to it but I could not have been more wrong!  This was an inspiring and surprising book! Great till the last page!
B001HBYH9Q|2.0|Just saw Notting Hill for the first time - I didn't buy the plot for one minute! I love Julia Roberts but her character Anna is a bitch in it, cheating on her boyfriend and just using Will when it's convenient. It took a lot of will power for Will to tell Anna he wasn't going to let her prance back into his life and break his heart again. Then he goes back to her anyway, and they're in love forever. BS. If the author wants the viewer to believe any of this he should have emphasized that the painting Anna gave Will is an original and she brought it from the US with intentions of giving it to him and making amends (when she sees a print of it at his house earlier in the movie she could have said she has it at home!) then again, it's her last day of filming so when was she intending to give it to him anyway? And why wait until she's filming in Britain again, when it's convenient, why not make a special trip? But alas, instead of emphasizing the paintings significance, the author emphasizes Anna's line \\"I'm just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her\\" which screams problems and baggage!! She just wants to be loved by a boy, she's not in love with Will!
1439153663|5.0|I am NOT going to go through all of this just to tell you why I liked a particular book!! It should be enough for you to know that I rated it to my personal tastes or not!!
B009GEBBNQ|3.0|Just another ok movie in the superhero genre, not bad, not great. If you're looking for basic entertainment (or it is on sale) go for it, otherwise there are so many other better choices.
B002RKSZWG|5.0|Love, love, love it! Never boring, didn't want to put it down! I highly recommend everyone read this, it's a quick read.
B009HSVHV2|5.0|Was a bit surprised at how well Kiss sounded when I preveiwed the audio clips. As a former Kiss follwer from the begining, yes I was a teenager the first album came out. I quit following Kiss in the mid to late 80's. I just have gotten back into regaining intrest in them. I still prefer old Kiss, but I find this album to be a good mix of old and new. At least thats how I feel about it.
B002VHI8J0|4.0|One of the greatest difficulties with reading a novel where structure has become so inverted is to get past that inversion and still appreciate the story. David Mitchell has constructed his novel Cloud Atlas from six novellas which are broken up in Russian-doll style with the first half of the first story coming first and the last half of the first story being last so that the stories sandwich each other.<br /><br />It's a humbling experience and one that makes Cloud Atlas thoroughly enjoyable.
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|...you'll probably like Ted. It was highly entertaining and kept me laughing the entire time. The only negative was the length; it's a real commitment for a comedy at ~2 hours long.
B005QUQP76|5.0|Pros: Great build, nice feel, and and good look!<br /><br />Cons: Scroll wheel is a little different than most mice, but I got used to it (very minor)<br /><br />I would recommend this mouse to everyone!
B0037VNX44|1.0|After reading all the reviews, I had really built the movie up for my husband and I to watch.<br /><br />We watched almost the whole thing and I doubt when we shut it off (to watch a rerun of Law & Order SVU) the movie was going to change dramatically.  It's a little weird and maybe I'm not artsy enough to appreciate it.  Also, there really isn't much of a plot.  That's my opinion.<br /><br />I actually didn't like the movie one iota.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|This case is great!  Works well and rarely needs charging!  I would recommend this to anyone who owned the bluetooth & hasn't bought one yet.
B003TSEEDY|2.0|I wasn't a fan of this book.  I felt like some of the situations that were portrayed in the book were a little bit unbelievable... and it felt like the ending was a cop-out.  I know this is the latest &#34;IT&#34; book, but in my opinion, save your money!
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|Highly recommend.  This film is a masterpiece of graphic novel to silver screen.  Story LIne - Character Development - and - acting all is first rate.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really enjoyed this book! Not your average thriller.  Just when you think the story is going to be predictable and cliche, it turns out to be ANYTHING but.  Will keep you glued to the edge of your seat, and you won't want to put the book down until you're done!
B008RV5K5E|5.0|Differs from the movie - but - simply wonderful none-the-less.  If you are a batman fan - this will not disappoint.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved it!!!!!!!  Will recommend to All my friends and family!!!!!!  Now on to the second part!!!!!!!  I am hitting at the bit to read #2!
B002Q9VPFM|5.0|Highly recommend.  This film is a masterpiece of graphic novel to silver screen.  Story LIne - Character Development - and - acting all is first rate.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|the game has good graphics and music but is too short for the price. it could have more levels to make it worthwhile
075669812X|5.0|The kids loved this book. They got so excited about the rare piece included. This book has a lot of information.
B00000JR29|5.0|Love this CD...one of my favs from the 80s..nothing beats it...would highly recommend it for any audio enthusiast.  Love those Tears for Fears
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I think it could have had a better ending, but other than that I loved the book. It's one of those books you can't stop reading
B007G92QGO|4.0|Good storyline, well written with snippets from the courtroom. Couldn't put the book down, and then when you get to the twist at the end, its like &#34;what??&#34; and you want to read all over again!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love it was my favorite game in the day now so modern love love love love love love love love love it.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|since when did it become funny to be vulgar?<br />are we at a point in our limited history of becoming so<br />  loud and vulgar that we think that it's funny to be that way.
B009GESJH2|5.0|This is a great cd if you're Kid Rock fan. I got this for a Christmas gift and was very pleased.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I loved this movie and the stories that will come from it.  The extras that came with it show how much fun the actors had making the movie.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|This is one of the most original shows to come around in a long time! Jessica Lange is incredible! I believe she won an Emmy for her performance.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|A book mostly for teenagers, I liked it but it was a bit too much of a love story for me, I prefer books with adventures or suspense.
B005NJU8PA|4.0|It has dramatically helped my cooking and how I approach the task. Never thought the concepts could be interchangeable currently.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Great movie, get it!  Best wrap up to an amazing trilogy!  Must have for any action movie addict! Awesome soundtrack too.
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|Only good thing in this movie is Tom Hardy's voice acting (yes voice acting, seems it was recorded in an entirely separate dimension from every other actor on screen.) Even then, it's nowhere near as memorable as Heath Ledger's joker. And I mean, nowhere near as close.<br /><br />Other than Bane's voice, the movie is plagued by bad acting (or at best, forgettable.) The plot is full of holes, clichés, and extreme predictability.<br /><br />From Batman taking 8 years off to do nothing with his life, to a rookie cop knowing he was batman just because he can read people's minds or some bull about \\"fake smiles\\" to the constant hammering about the stupid auto-pilot being broken that you just knoooooow will be secretly fixed... bargh... I want my Batman back!!! Not this garbage...
B000SEGUDE|5.0|I have still not seen the movie, cannot wait. This book is simply awesome. Mitchell is my go to for authors now. I hope he writes quickly, I am getting everything he has written.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book is one of the most interesting books I read in my life even though I'm 11 ;) I think it should historical fiction because It refers to so many Greek gods; Zeus, Poseidon, Hades etc. The book is about boy half god half human taking on  a quest to return items stolen from Olympus. But along the way he gets accused  of something he didn't do. He takes a quest to return the stolen items, get back what was stolen from him, and stay alive while doing it. This story is about friendship, bravery, courage, and staying a team. Annenberg, Grovner, and Percy stick together to take what was stolen. If you haven't read this book I suggest to clicking the buy button and start reading because this book will have you guessing at every turn and asking your self what's going to happen next. Click the buy button now and I wish you'll have fun reading this book!!!! (Actually I know you will) :D
B0076DELIG|3.0|As a huge Michael Connelly fan and reader of almost everything he has written, I eagerly awaited the latest Harry Bosch installment. I was disappointed.  The story seemed contrived and without the vivid descriptions about LA and the surrounding areas.  What was with the IA detective rescuing Bosch from the barn?  If Connelly would have explained her presence (Bosch asked her but she was evasive) the situation may have been somewhat believable.  I would have even gone for his partner, Chu, showing up unannounced.  Bosch suspected he was being followed, but in totally un-Bosch-like manner, he did not check it out.  Also the friction with the new OU Lieutenant seemed very contrived.  I mean really, his travel account?  Also, I got the impression that he was going to break it off with Hanna because of all her baggage, i.e. the son in prison for rape.  The title even seemed contrived.  I know I have used the word &#34;contrived&#34; a lot in this short review, but it fits.<br />With every other Connelly novel, I could not put the book down until I was finished.  With this one, I found myself leaving it for long periods of time, even reading something else in between.  The story was just not that good.<br /><br />Also, whatever happened to Mickey Haller running for District Attorney?  I would love to see the pairing of DA Haller and Detective Bosch on a (good) case.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like this game so far. It is easy enough not to get frustrated,but challenging enlighten not to get bored.
B0063IH60K|1.0|When I tried to play this game last night, an add for a singles site popped up and I had to press the home button to get out of it.I am going to remove the app!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|While reading-- voraciously I might add-- I found myself fully in Amy's court and other times I was firmly rooting for Nick. This novel is just like that; you are never quite sure where anyone stands. Very good, very fast read :-)
B009JBWOU0|5.0|It came in original packaging with all the codes a little booklet and everything. It was even more than i expected and all three movies work fine.
159420411X|5.0|I bought this book for my husband for Christmas and he was pleasantly surprised by the book, he is anticipating that this will be a good read and hopefully will come up with some of his own statistics to win the lottery,lol.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|The book kept you guessing as to what was going to happen next and the ending of the book was a real shocker.  Couldn't put it down.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|We have this DVD from before but decided to purchase this for my sister and her husband for Christmas. They loved it!!!, It is truly a wonderful and heartfelt movie. Also it was only $4.99 brand new, you can't beat it, given other stores like the big box store and the one with the bullseye had the same DVD for between $11.00-$14.99. I love saving money!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|5 out of 5,I couldn't stop reading this book for days and I loved it so much!I can't wait to read the next book!
1401322786|5.0|My Husband wanted this book for Christmas and so I bought it, He has started reading and says he enjoys the plot of the story from the Author.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|Its an okay game! You've got to figure out the awkward puzzle of how to knock down different contraptions and squash the green pigs. Some can be pretty tough to score high!
B001UV4XHY|5.0|As per above review (for Part 2), it was in excellent condition and the whole family enjoyed watching this filem
1595141715|5.0|I was forced to read this for a class but it is an amazing book well put together and interesting
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I chose this for my niece, at her request, and she loved it.  The copy was in great condition, and the whole family enjoyed watching it.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|the best series of movies i have ever had really enjoying it nothing like popcorn and an Alien night wonderful
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|I've read several of the other reviews, and I agree 100% with the general consensus that this recording falls short as  a &#34;Highlights.&#34; album.  In the Broadway show -- as well as in the movie -- Do You Hear The People Sing&#34; is a critical moment in the story,and it's unthinkable that it was left out of a highlights album except for the partial version with the different lyrics that's part of the epilogue.  Also, conspicuously missing is &#34;A Little Fall Of Rain.&#34;  Samantha Banks has only one song on this album, and she deserves more.  Especially considering that she has the most professional vocals in the large cast.<br /><br />Still, having seen the movie on its U.S. opening day, it's nice to have this as sort of a memento of the simply incredible film.
B0093X805W|5.0|I've been reading this book with my four year old for the past weeks and he has gotten caught up in the descriptions and language of the book. He's now asking to read everything Dahl has written. High praise, I'd say.
B00005Y23E|5.0|YES, I ENJOY THIS C.D. MY WIFE LOVES BOB MARLEY AND HIS SOUNDS, I ALSO HEARD A FEW SOUNDS I DON'T KNOW HE WAS THE SINGER
B007KAJG3K|4.0|good sequel to first movie. a lot of action and twists.  I also like having a digital copy as a plus.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This is an excellent and fun video for all ages. Visually spectactular.  Intriguing storyline.<br />It was very entertaining. My granddaughter age 3 watched everyday.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|I loved this movie. I enjoy the play between comedy, video game references, and action sequences.  watch this movie multiple times.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|Even at age 35, I look back fondly at my days singing in high school and college, so I looked forward to this movie. While the plot is pretty predictable, the music is fun and the story is cute. Even my husband liked it!
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|This movie was great. lots of surprises, suspense, and an all around good mystery movie. i will be waiting for the sequels that will follow.
B003ASLJO0|5.0|Clint Eastwood proves why he is stil la force in Hollywood. He's a hardnose, racist that finally finds himself that he is not only human, but learns that his fellow men are the same, regardless of race, color, creed. I highly recommend this movie.
B004D9FLJE|4.0|I think the series brings back talent to the screen that we don't see much of any more. What a delight to see sucha variety of music covered in modern themes. Unfortunately the third disc won't play so I won't be able to watch those episodes. But the order and delivery where painless and quick. It will be a treasure to have for years.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|A good read from the first page.  I had a hard time putting in down when I read it for the first time.  I reread it when the second book (The Shadow of Night) was released and I'm glad I did.  There are lots of distinctive characters with colorful lives.  It is very easy to lose yourself in this book.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Couldn't put this book down. The attention to the details and story line pulls you into Ana and Christians world making you never want to stop reading it wondering what's going to happen next. Can't wait to read the other two books in the series...
1451629184|5.0|This was such a good book.  Jaycee tells her story with such honesty and heart, you leave feeling all the emotion.  What a brave girl and now a brave and free woman.
B009NPA3Y6|5.0|Excellent recording of my favorite Stones' hits. What could be better! Who can resist the emotion and drive of the best in rock and roll.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|Scalzi is IMO the best current American SF writer, and this book is a good example of why I think so. Starts out humorous but by the end makes you think about life in the way good literature should. I highly recommend it.
B0076DELIG|5.0|l love the way Michael has developed Harry and the other cast of Charectors. Alway engaging and suspensful. A grea read, but then he always is.
B000MV8XPG|5.0|Bought 2 of these for our twin boys 3rd birthday.  They loved it and was a big hit at their construction site birthday party.  Easy to put together and made very well.
B001RP1G0U|5.0|Such a great movie and family approved for all to watch together. Love the dogs in this movie, and the humor.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to play, taught my 8 yo grand daughter n 20 min. Now we play together! Which is even more fun.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Sucks you in from the beginning. Wonderfully written. Wish it was longer. I wasn't ready for the book to end.
B000ID37RM|5.0|Nothing better! The acting is superb and it has a great story with morals and values which is rare these days. A must see.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|Good game. I like that it gets progressively hard and the scenes change at every level. It keeps me going back for more.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gillian Flynn had a great approach to this story. The plot had some great twists & turns that were very unexpected. I couldn't put it down which is rare these days. Enjoy.
B003SI9WYG|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever made, in my opinion.  There have been many copycats but this is the only one with heart.  I love most of the characters and they all have such distinct personalities that it's difficult not to feel for them.  Jack, of course, could be just about any one of us with out dissatisfaction amidst luxury.  Sally is what I admire in a woman:  strong, clever, protective, and secure.  She doesn't shy away from sewing and cooking and looking pretty but she is really the star of the show because she encompasses all that makes a woman separate-but-equal to a man.  She is what feminists should be promoting to girls but, alas, they choose different role models who need a sword to get what she wants.  The message is unmistakeable and even fairly young children will get it.  Adults will see much of themselves in the characters and there are quite a few jokes that will go over the heads of the kids that are very funny for the adults.  This movie does a great job of satisfying the young ones while those of us who have lived for a few decades are able to see what we wish we had done with out lives and are still able to do in our future.  This is a must see for everyone, really.
B005IS565S|5.0|Believe it or not I bought this album for my 14 year old son and thought to myself &#34;kids now days listen to the damnedest things&#34;. He said mom just listen to the words. So I did and I can say I am a fan for Life of FFDP. This band reaches a person thoughts and soul through their music in ways that many bands are not able to. The song &#34;Remember Everything&#34; is one of the best songs I have ever heard in my life. SO for the oldies out their who just think that this band is just Punk, really listen to the words and it is unbelievable how the art behind these words are in touch with the way many people think and feel but  are unable to express it. I strongly urge people of many ages to listen to the words and understand that FFDP gives a excellent interpretation to frustrations that many deal with.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|This movie is pretty good.  It's problem is that it doesn't quite know what it wants to be.  There are plenty of gross out jokes for the young teenagers that will seem idiotic and out of place to anyone over the age of 16 but there is also quite a bit that is very much NOT for children.  Firstly, we have a disgusting few minutes at the opening with a young woman in an extremely sexy outfit is in a ridiculous scene (c'mon, is he really going to get visitors, considering who he turns out to be?).  Totally out of place and inappropriate for the targeted audience (heck, if they wanted to put a half naked woman in it, they could at least have put some thought into it and had it make sense).  Then the ending has way too much feeling in it to match the tone of the rest of the movie.  It felt like it belonged to a separate movie and was just tacked on.  The first two are much better but if you are a true fan, you will like it.  I, personally, wouldn't allow my children to see it if they were under 14 or so.
B0053O89IS|5.0|Loved it. It kept with Bones' personality and I was very pleased with each episode. The plots for each episode were very good and there was additional plots that make the series more than just a bunch of episodes. Very happy.
B005MYEPXC|5.0|This is an excellent movie - the feel of the movie for Paris in the 20's is incomparable.  The actors are excellent and another great Woody Allen movie.
B003ICWTR4|5.0|60 yrs old and still gives the most energized performance of anyone. I play this everyday when I workout. If he can do this for over 3 hrs. What an Inspiration.
B005723JSQ|5.0|I really enjoy Sophie Kinsella and have read each one of her books.  This one is no different!  As a gift to myself over the Christmas break, I chose this book (Kindle edition) because it sounded like such a fun read.  It definitely was!  It was an easy read and the footnotes were very cute.  I loved it and finished it in two days.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|This is a &#34;feel good&#34; movie that is worth you time watching if you need a movie that does not make you think and has a nice ending.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Starts off great, lots of turns and twists.  Very unexpected ending, you will be very surprised.  Decent vacation read. Not book club material.
B008476HBM|5.0|Most importantly it was FREE; glad it was available on the &#34;free&#34; list as it was required for Book Club reading; It made a great addition to my kindle library;
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Enjoy all of Lee Child's books.  Learn lots about evidence, weapons, bullets, etc .  You won't be disappointed. All of his book rights have been sold for film.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A few of my kids have read this book and I finally have got to also. Wow great book easy quick read right from start. I love to read but if a book doesn't catch me in the first few pages I don't continue.
B004LWZWGK|3.0|i wasn't impressed with this movie.  Somehow this move was so predictable to me.  Maybe the next one will be better.
0345529057|5.0|I'm really not even into fantasy books, but the series is so well written and enticing that it anyone can lose themselves in these books. I recommend A Song of Ice and Fire to everyone I know. It's just one of those books that you have to put the book down for a moment and think \\"Holy crap that seriously just happened\\" because it's just so damn brilliant.
B00AKEMHCA|1.0|do not buy. waste of time and money. kindle fire processes too slow to run this app. works great on ipad. try bloon tower defence 4. it works awesome on kindle.
B00421IR5I|5.0|It is the perfect video to show an advanced French class, after they have read and discussed several of the short stories. The movie is adorable and my students really enjoyed watching it.
B008RTE09S|4.0|Bought this as a gift for my husband. It was not a great film but fun to watch, especially if you are a Beatles fan.
B005LAIHQS|2.0|This movie was terrible. I loved the first Men In Black but this one was just not as funny. The humor was forced and not natural.
B00005RDRO|5.0|We saw this movie when it came out and being a mystery buff laughed all the way through it.  So happy it finally came out on DVD.
B0058VW36U|4.0|This little game is really nice. I had it on my phone and now it's on my kindle. It won't take up to much time. I play with it on the bus.
6304712936|5.0|Americans love child prodigies, and 8 Academy Awards to boot! This story has a hero, a villain, sex & music. How could you go wrong!
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|The Album The World From The Side Of The Moon of Phillip Phillips is one the best albums I ever Heard, with one of the songs I have most liked in my life, the Song Man on the Moon
B0009XNUK0|5.0|Great song selection! My daughter loved Michael Jackson's songs as a child of 10, and she still enjoys his music at the age of 33.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|I thought this film was the bees knees. Violence, great story, superb villain, and Tom Hardy's beastly performance as an invincible brother. Even Cricket has a place in my heart. Very well done, bravo.
0307949486|5.0|This book really keeps you on your toes!  Different than most books I have read in the same vein.  I'd recommend it!
B004JMSIRC|5.0|No complaints,great entertainment,exciting. received it on time, plays fine.I would highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in this kind of movie.
B008WCP2PG|4.0|The movie was a fun watch.  The dancing was amazing.  I wasn't really in it for the plot which got a little silly/sad.
B003YHSE7W|5.0|no complaints,it was as i expected,on time plays well what else can I say. A great movie most entertaining.<br /><br /> BYE
030726999X|5.0|The finale of the trilogy and definitely worth the read!  You must complete the series!  You will be disappointed if you don't!  I would be at least!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|The World of Goo is a fun game to play. The graphics and sounds are great. It keeps you on your toes and sometimes I feel like its really alive. Its quickly become my favorite app. Its relaxing after a hectic day.&#34;Good Job!&#34; to the makers of this game. Easy to play but never gets boring. It makes me smile.
0684857820|5.0|One of my favorite authors of all time but this book is very honest and on a very touchy emotional subject.  Worth the read though!
B002MYUEWQ|5.0|The movie that introduced the world to one of the most (if not the most) listened to Christmas songs of all time - White Christmas. But the music doesn't stop with that song. With great songs for every holiday, the voice of Bing Crosby and the dancing  of Fred Astaire, and the singing and dancing of Marjorie Reynolds, this movie should be on everybody's must see list for the holiday season every year. It's a movie that couldn't be made in today's overly \\"politically correct\\" world, so everybody who enjoys a real story with substance - as opposed to the flash and bling of today's movies and computer graphics - should take the time to watch it. Consider it an investment of your time - one that will bring happy returns year after year. My only disappointment was when renting the HD version (which shows the colorful faces of Bing, Fred and Marjorie on the \\"cover\\"), the movie itself streamed to me in black and white, and in a 4:3 ratio instead of the widescreen version one would expect when getting an HD version. Aside from that - awesome.
0307269981|5.0|I read this following The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.  Good book and next The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest!  I recommend reading on!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am still trying to figure it out.  I have enjoyed browsing thru the multitude of info on Pinterest,  It is fun and informative.
B00APUQJLO|3.0|It was a very different type of role for Robert Pattinson to play as I have followed since Harry Potter, Twilight, Remember Me. I thought the movie was OK, just not my fave material. But, worth watching.
0143113100|5.0|I haven't finished the book yet but it has been a very interesting and informative read so far on the intricacies of what the brain is capable of doing to heal the body.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|Charlise scared me as the Evil Queen. WOW. Intense! I also think Kristen Stewart did a great job as Snow White in a very different light than we have seen before. I loved the visual elements of this movie, the dark forest, creatures, etc. Then the light that she brought with her pureness and love. Can't wait for the sequel!
B00AHSINKO|2.0|Depressing, boring and slow. Not sure why it was advertised as a &#34;romantic comedy&#34;.<br />Just Tommy Lee Jones playing every character Tommy Lee Jones ever plays...
B009VB97EY|2.0|Movie was not very good. I mean, seriously I didn't believe for one moment the female character. She didn't seem to fit. The only reason I watched is Matt Bomer who wasn't in the movie enough for me.
1577311523|5.0|This book is wonderful.  It is clear, straightforward and a good read. I loved it and recommend it very highly.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|One of the few sequels to be better than the original. Josh Brolin is excellent as young K, and Will Smith excellent as ever.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Ads are not annoying because they only pop up once in awhile unlike other games where they pop up after each round played.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|I couldn't put this down.... it was gripping and could hardly T<br />Put it down. I loved my sister's keeper and this book was also amazing. Great read and surprisingly  unpredictable
B006LSZECO|3.0|At first I was sympathetic with the main characters but it was not long into the book I became angry with Nick.  He was a to non-chill ant and cocky about his wife's disappearance.  Which made him look pretty guilty to others.  Then Amy's REAL character comes into light and I really got mad at both of them.  They really weren't the people you first thought they were they became selfish, untrustworthy, crude and very rough around the edges.  Their personalities were more than questionable.  At times language and personalities were just plain raunchy.<br /><br />This book shows us how easy it is to come to incorrect conclusions when a crime occurs and how the media and written word can influence your opinion.<br /><br />The characters seem to deserve each other by the end of the book
B00003CY6M|5.0|I bought this few years ago, still watch occasionally, by myself or with friends. Had no problems with the quality.
B003YCI1O8|4.0|This is one of those movies I can sit back and watch over and over whenever I don't need a mental challenge. This movie is nothing but a little fun with some corn thrown in. I've seen it a dozen times and it always delivers the entertainment. Other than a little bad acting on Reba's part, its watchable. For some unknown reason everyone yells every line in the movie, but its still a fun ride. It would be a great movie to watch with the kids, but the language is a little rough in spots. Keep the mute button handy.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|One of a kind storytelling. Howey paints quite the picture in this post apocalypse (post humanity? post society?) series of novellas. Would recommend the read to anyone.
B004C3DLJS|5.0|I have never seen a Pixar movie I didn't enjoy.  Can't miss.  Entertaining for children and adults alike.  I recommend.
B000FCKC4C|4.0|I read this book at the insistence of many friends who claimed to have read it twice yearly since they picked it up. I was not disappointed at the recommendation and I can see why people love this book so much. Based on &#34;The Alchemist&#34;, I feel that Coelho is a wonderful storyteller that creates vivid imagery and delves in some profound spiritual and philosophical topics while using very simple language. I really appreciated that aspect of the writing. Overall, the story helps you put your life in perspective in regards to the choices you make, finding your true calling, and pursuing the things in life that you are truly passionate about. Definitely a good read when you think you could use a fresh look at your life and goals and what you are doing to progress.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Works well if you use a city and not a suburb.  Good value.  Especially like the projected forecast for area.
0811877485|5.0|I was a little worried about how these were going to work out but I am very pleased. They are a good size and quality and I can't wait to put them up in our nursery!<br /><br /> Update 2/28/13<br />I have been having trouble with all of the pieces coming off the wall....I ended up buying a spray adhesive (a temporary) and it seems to be working on the small pieces. The biggest problem has been with the caterpillar because of the fold.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Suzanne Collins continues the Hunger Games adventure with a story line that is a page turner. Don't be surprised if you read this book in a day!
B005PK57NU|5.0|I've enjoyed watching the Good Wife- the characters are interesting, the story line captures your attention, the pace is great, and there are many depths to consider- courtroom, corporate intrigue, loyalties, trust, betrayal, prejudice, honor... some of the performances are very believable (Alicia) while others less so, but overall, this is like a great vacation novel, in many chapters.<br /><br />In addition, the streaming has been nearly flawless.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|Great price, I love the color, Inside is soft felt so it wont scratch my screen and it is sturdy enough that im not worried about dropping it!
B0080K3G4O|4.0|I am part way through it but it is really good.  It gives a good perspective with informative history of psychology theories and religion.
B007XIC1GI|4.0|This bio was easy to read and gave Manson an almost human-like appearance. He doesn't hold back when speaking about his drug use but he only eludes to his on stage antics we know him for. I personally do not like him, not because of what he represents, but because he preaches independence, self worth, and knowledge but criticizes others for the choices they make in their own lives.
B002BJGYU8|5.0|I love all the episodes, and she and her daughter have such a good rapport.  I loved the series on tv but gotten more<br />out of it this way
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|It was funny but not witty comedy, more like goofy comedy.  Not my favorite but somewhat entertaining.  No awards know this one.
B004P12SSW|1.0|Why did I waste my money....what a drag of a movie. Watching paint dry would of been more exciting.Don't buy it.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Beautifully done, challenging and very relaxing music.  Graphics are lovely. Not a typical puzzle game, lots of fun!  Very addicting!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|great little sharpener. really really light and efficient. I get great edges on all of my knives every time .
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I liked that the book was in a letter format, and that we don't know to who the friend is.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|My kiddos love the movie.  Dr. Seuss, who wouldn't love it.  We enjoy the bright colors and animation and the story.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|It was not my favorite of the three books. It tied up the loose ends though. I did enjoy the last few pages which gave us the Christian's point of view...that was well done.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My kiddos loved the movie.  Great Dr. Seuss story.  They loved the colors and the animation and the whole story line.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|It was like nothing I had read before so of course I was hooked. Graphic and raunchy but Anatasia got on my nerves after awhile. Had to read the second book just to see what was going to happen!
B000U0F7RG|4.0|I bought this product used.  The case was in nearly perfect condition and I have yet to have any playback issues when using a DVD player.  However, every other DVD does not play in my DVD drive on my laptop.  I also noticed that on some of the DVDs there are question marks after the season number, and I wonder why this is.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I LOVED all three books. Well written, suspenseful and an amazing story. Although there was so much sadness and the third book nearly broke my heart, I highly recommend the trilogy.
B00866JL96|5.0|A typical Sparks story, but easy to &#34;get into&#34; and imagine real lives...well filmed on location...beautiful country.  A good buy.
B00338QENI|4.0|It was recommended by my Mom who loved it but I struggled to finish it. The concept is so different but it is an interesting read with well developed characters. It took me awhile to finish the book but would recommend.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I purchased the previous Jewels Star game and loved it. The new game is also lots of fun and very addictive. I can't concentrate on anything else - this game calls my name. While traveling as a passenger in a vehicle or airplane this game makes the time fly by.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|All three books were great!  Mockingjay pulled everything together.  I was sad when I was done.  Looking forward to reading more books from this author.
B006LQQ1GE|3.0|Slowly warming to some of the other tunes.  I mainly purchased for the main &#34;hit&#34; but the other tunes are coming around.
B000002IWH|5.0|I already adore this movie, and I love the music. I got this CD for my significant other, and he loves it. I love it as well and we listen to it all the time. It has a great mix of songs from the film. If you are a Crow fan, you should own this CD.
B005H3MRL0|5.0|I have the standard CD and love the tunes, when the opportunity arose to get the &#34;Promo Copy&#34; Gold SBM CD at a very reasonable price I ordered it.  The SBM Gold CD does sound a bit more &#34;fleshed out&#34; than the standard one.  You can hear further into the recording and everything is better!
B005HSL626|5.0|It Wes cool I unlock all the blades<br />And I don't know what to do now I think I'm should wait for something
1881273156|5.0|Many of my thoughts have been validated by reading this book. I haven't quite finished it yet, but when I find a thought provoking idea it enables me to spark a conversation with my husband when I might otherwise have not.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book actually turned out to be better then i thought. It was a little bit too detailed at first but reading on i could see why look forward to the second book.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|adorable  very clever.  not your typical HO game but a neat twist on the genre.  glad i found the game and encourage others to play.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|It has 2  restart at the beginning a couple X`s and won't let me visit my allies :(  but anyway it's FUN and COOL :D just please fix them things then you are good...please y is the expansion Sooo expensive like REALLY? Unnessicary is
B009329Y30|5.0|I have watched other Nicholas Sparks movies and this is one of my new favorites. It is a good chick flick.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|So good- read it in a day I didn't think I would like the letter style of the book but u think I  made  it better. I would definitely recommend this book!
B0090EJR1K|2.0|It had a couple of big laughs but that's about it. The plot is very thin and the actors seemed liked they were fresh out of acting school.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book I could not put down<br />I cried n laughed smiled<br />I felt so connected reading this book<br />The author really brought this story to life<br />The way this story end really brings home how people can really truely love someone can concore there past.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|I enjoyed seeing Phillip perform as a contestant on the 2012 season of American Idol.  Can't believe he was so outstanding all-the-while being so ill with kidney problems which he couldn't fully resolve until the season was completed.  Hooray that Phillip a<br />was that season's winner and thst he produced such a wonderful album.  Can't wait to watch his career unfold and to see where he goes.  Phillip Phillips is such a unique and extraordinary talent.  Buy this CD.  You'll be rewarded.
B00APUQT7I|4.0|Funny movie that kept the whole family interested including teenagers.  We appreciated the wide variety of humor that was aimed at multiple ages.  The movie also moved quickly so no one got bored...
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wowee, this book is amazing! A definite must read!<br />Couldn't put it down until I finished it! Do yourself a favour and read it!
B003VANOFY|5.0|So for the last year I've really wanted to finally upgrade from wired headphones but I was worried about the sound quality, fit and battery life.  After a lot of research I finally decided on the G930.  Part of the reason is that I wanted to 7.1 surround sound to help me get that little extra edge when it comes to FPS games.  Planetside 2, Battlefield 3 etc . . .<br /><br />Well after a week I love these headphones.  Music sounds great, the range is about 30 feet, the battery last for my long gaming sessions (6 hours) and no more tripping on my headphone cord.<br /><br />In game I can hear much more clearly which way a shot came from, where enemies are and how far away they are.  It's just that little edge that the competitive gamer will really enjoy.<br /><br />Fit wise they have a great weight that makes them feel solid on my head as well as snug.<br /><br />The mic works great with Skype and Teamspeak (even though it has not native support).  I found overall that the quality for voice chat went up a lot with these headphones when in game.<br /><br />Anyway, after a week, I am very happy with my purchase and I look forward posting more thoughts as the year goes by.
B004EKCNMA|4.0|I grew up with It's a Wonderful Life. This is one of my favorite Christmas movies of all time. This brings back many childhood memories. Disney's A Christmas Carol is relatively new in the respect I have only seen it once. However, It was nicely done and a great movie for the younger generation.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|I sat back and enjoyed watching this movie.  Watched it twice actually taking notice of the gear they were using.  Realistic from the operator perspective, but I hope the next &#34;Bourne&#34; movie shows the evil govt entity using other techniques besides pulling data from cameras positioned everywhere.  I would recommend this movie to others.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I totally love this book!<br /><br />I chose this book because I really wanted to read it<br />I rated this book because I want reader's to make good choices on their books.<br />Thanks for writing this book!
B0060ZJ74O|5.0|If you like baseball, try this flick.  I really enjoyed it as it reminds me of cheap management with the Padres.  You need to spend money, time, and good farm teams to make the Pro Game consistently better.  Thats why you go to AAA or AA or A baseball games!  They are fun if you don't expect consistent results!  Just sit back, relax, enjoy the peanuts and hot dogs and Nachos, and patronize your home team; because it's fun!  That's why we attend Spring Training Games!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|The storyline was great, but the diary-like writing style can be a little outputting. I still suggest the book, but don't let the writing get in the way of enjoying the story!
B004ZGI2A0|3.0|It's a high budget film with a lot of inconsistent script for the MOVIE!  Read the book as a fairy tale!!!!  But, if your family wants to see it, warn them about some sex and and a lot of Middle Ages Good Ol'Violence.  Knights fighting and killing the peasants in the name of God....  OK actors, lousy writing, good film making, and 3 stars for special effects!
B0083Z614S|5.0|A very good clean book, showing the importance of flowers and fresh air and activity, also shows that a person can change.
B005OP2928|5.0|One of the best comedies I've seen in years.  Great cast, terrific story lines.  Highly recommended for those who need a good laugh.
B0052GACNM|5.0|This man has a voice and timing that at his age are simply amazing. The people accompanying him are good too. Appeal for all ages.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|Clever, technically well done.  The turning point is when a couple of creeps kidnap Ted, and he dies and then comes back to life because the girlfriend wishes it.  Not convincing, and not something I could really relate to either.
B00AMBM9MO|1.0|Awful they should have paid us to see it. A total bust unless you like mindless rude things and that is that
030758836X|3.0|I was so excited to read this book; but it was a true letdown. About 200 pages could have been eliminated. I felt it kept dragging and dragging and then you would get some moments of suspense and intrigue. It is a unique plot, no doubt. I felt Ms. Flynn just didn't know how to end it; or I just didn't get her ending message.
B00APUQRPC|3.0|Clint should hang it up.  He is no longer believable, except when speaking directly to a chair, ad hoc. The others were just okay.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I couldnt stop watching this show- breezed through series 1 and moved on to 2.  Bought this for my parents for Christmas.
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|Great gift for a young girl in love with boy bands.  Worked out well for Xmas.  Would do again for sure.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love playing a quick game or two at the end of the day or while waiting for an appointment. I'd give it 5 stars if I could watch w/o ads.
B009RH973I|4.0|Excellent protection with a stylish pretty pink color. A bit awkward when plugged in charging but overall very pleased with durability
B009T3AE1Y|1.0|Pretentious. Self-important. Boring. Visually lackluster. Claustrophobic. Did I mention boring?<br /><br />Most of the movie takes place in a rich kid's limo. A lot of pontificating - mostly about wealth - so we're subject to a whole lotta philosophizing. I guess Cronenberg never heard of Goldwyn's statement that if he wanted to send a message he'd use Western Union.<br /><br />This movie moves along at the glacial pacing of a snail on Quaaludes. Lots of scenes of people talking AT each other... endlessly, boringly (did I mention that?), and repeatedly. It reminds me of the \\"experimental theater\\" exercises we used to practice when I was studying drama in college. If you like college-level theatrics, you might enjoy this flick.<br /><br />I guess I'd better get ready for the usual fanboy attack. Here they come!

B008476HBM|4.0|I had read it before but enjoyed reading it again. It had been along time since I read it last.
B005LAIHYU|4.0|Interesting movie.  Fun to watch.  A movie that will surprise and amuse you.  Not the best movie ever but entertaining.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|The movie was amazing and at a great price.  This was a Christmas present for my husband and it really made his day.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Looking for a movie to just entertain you?  This is one of those quirky movies with lots of texture and great characters.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|I was very pleased with not only the movie but the price.  I love the movie and I know it will become one of the classics.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|It was okay; I finished it which means it was interesting enough- I felt the writing was a bit shallow and the main characters' relationship developed too fast. Good beach read but too sappy for me any other time.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|Love it, perfect.  I still have to write more words just to send a review.  You shouldn't have words limits on here.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I've never been interested in video games and downloaded this for my kids to play. Yeah. I tried it to see what it was like and now I'm hooked! The kids haven't even gotten a chance to play it =)
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is amazing and once it snatches your curiosity, it is impossible to put it down. I definitely recommend it!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Once again a great story told by the master of military / intelligence genre. You won't be disappointed.  Loved it. I think I will tape over my webcam...just in case...
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have been on edge for this entire trilogy! This book will keep you on your toes! No need for predictions because you'll be shocked with every event! Must read!
B006LSZECO|5.0|The author did a good job with her research, and being in law enforcement I saw it. The book kept me on the edge of my seat, and I was sold as soon as I read the first paragraph of the second section! Do yourself a favor and get this book.
B003O86MY8|3.0|He is definitely talented but its not exactly what I was looking for.  The sound of the violin is not as pleasing as the cello.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is a fun way to pass time. I can not decide which game I like the best. at home.
B004XWMXW4|4.0|I like this CD.  Its relaxing.  I don't love it only because it is not exactly what I was looking for.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|I didn't know what to expect from Ted. I like Seth McFarlane and I watch his TV shows but this movie feels as if he was restrained. I suppose he may not wanted to have drawn too many comparisons with Family Guy or maybe he was trying to broaden his scope but either way, Ted feels half finished. Wahlberg acted his part well and the scenes with the bear are frequently funny but as a whole, I think either more time creating the story, or less time rewriting the story would have made for a much better movie.
0425263908|5.0|I am a BIG fan of FSOG and this series is very similar and will not disappoint!  Cannot wait for book 3!
B00APUQRPC|4.0|The story isn't anything terribly original. The acting is well done by everyone on screen and the cinematography is done well without being becoming overdone. Overall, this is a simple, feel good movie that doesn't try and tackle all the ills of the whole world, just the world of a small family.
0425263916|5.0|This a great series, I cannot wait for book 3!  Hoping she even continues beyond just a &#34;trilogy&#34; with the series.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|that's about all I really need for an alarm.  also helpful for people like me who keep snoozing their alarm
B0086700CM|5.0|This app is great!! Its challenging and VERY FUN! Its a great time consumer. works great on kindle. plus its FREE!!!:-)
B004YM6JLO|5.0|Love the show and love the DVD extras! I own every season. The bloopers are my favorite, but I like the unaired scenes as well.
B000N6U0E2|3.0|more of a chick flick. my wife enjoyed it, I thought it was ok bla bla bla bla and so on
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|The book was very well written and well, I loved it! It's like nothing I've ever read before. From the beginning, I was hooked onto the book. Amazing is all I can say.
B000H225MW|5.0|This is my all time favorite child's book. It is very relatable and has  a lifelong message of  more than one side to every story.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Enjoyed it much more than the 1st. I agree with others saying the writing is bad but I enjoyed the story.
B006WAIV6M|2.0|First up- save your money.<br /><br />Bad writing, second rate research, and full of christian rubbish.<br /><br />Buy something by Christopher Hitchens instead.<br /><br />Reads like a bad newspaper article.<br /><br />Disappointing.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This movie is great and only made better with the 3D. We thoroughly enjoyed watching this on our new 3D television!
B009VSW15Y|4.0|their are so many camera apps didnt know what to chose but so far its ok.. probably will buy more
B003H9MSPG|3.0|Nerf has always made good products, but sometimes, something just falls short of everyone's expectations. The Longstrike is a good example of this. Although it looks cool, and the assembly is simple enough, it is plagued by a few issues. The major issue is the firing mechanism.<br />Due to an issue with the spring, this gun does not fire as far as advertised. The box says the gun fires up to 35 feet, but you'll be lucky to get 10 feet out of a good shot.<br />That said, this does make for an excellent prop for those who do not wish to have all-out Nerf wars, the former being the primary reason I purchased this gun in the first place.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who wants to have a Nerf war with their friends, because you will be stuck trying to get in close to shoot, despite the weapon being designed as a sniper rifle-type gun.
B008S4YZCO|4.0|its fun. I can play and then come back when I'm ready. its fun for a lazy day at the house.
B008K6DU4Y|1.0|It plays my files perfectly for about 20 seconds, then returns to the main menu because of a pop-up ad at the bottom of the screen. This even happens while I'm in the settings menu. This only happens on my Kindle Fire HD, and not on either of my Samsung android phones.
B00A7ZWUJC|2.0|Overall, there's great production value to this album. However, there's no standout, radio worthy, pop-catchy tracks. That may be praise or critique. If you're one who doesn't care for what it blasted over the airwaves, then this album may be more for you. If you are fans of Rihanna's pop hits such as Umbrella or Rude Boy I find such anthems void on this album. That's not to say there's not the sometimes crass, often repetitive verses aren't here. They definitely are. They just aren't as catchy (or perhaps, not as annoying). If you're a Rihanna fan, you'll probably enjoy. If you're not, I doubt this will change your mind. It isn't her strongest offering to date.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Good read as long as you have read the other Pendergast stories.  Nice twists as usual that keep your attention
B009IQ0TGM|4.0|I really wanted to like Lights, Goulding's previous offering. And there were nice parts. But Halcyon delivers in all I had hoped its predecessor was. More of a continuous, ethereal, what I call &#34;3am music&#34; which isn't quite dancehall techno in the clubs and not transcendental new age. It's a unique sound that I find fits that time of day. It's agreeable at any time one wants to zone out. I don't see it as a mainstream offering in the sense of catching on with radio Top 40, but it is well produced, well mixed, just a well put together body of work. The only caveat is Ellie herself; her voice is so unique that it is difficult to find the right accompaniment for it. This was a big problem with Lights (along with songwriting) but is less noticeable on Halcyon. It's not a bad voice, just too unique at times. I want to believe the songstress and producers worked hard to meld music and voice this time around. For me, they succeeded.
B0015AARJI|5.0|It looks great and plays great. Based on other reviews that I read, I was afraid this might be a counterfeit controller but the one i received is legit.
B0092MKFIY|3.0|I first heard the Imagine Dragons during the opening of an Apple Inc event. Suffice to say, if you're not a fan of the music from Apple's ipod advertisements you won't take to this. I initially liked it, finding it upbeat enough not to depress me on the dark morning commutes to work but not hard enough to be unlistenable to at those same times. But on repeat listens, I don't feel it holds up. It's not bad. There's just an undercurrent of blandness. Still, the only discernible song for me is It's Time (the one chosen and used by Apple).<br /><br />It's worth a listen and for the sale price I got it at it was definitely worth it.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|Fun game. It is personal because you do draw your own character. Touch screen controls are always a little hinky, but this game does not require lightning reflexes.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I purchased my LifeProof case in June 2012 and it worked fine for a few months. I was happy with the camera and the sound. I worked around only being able to use \\"official\\" connectors and chargers. I did have a small problem with the front of the case getting a scratch extremely easily; however, for the waterproof protection, I was willing to trade off a scratch on the case.<br /><br />However, in November, I accidentally dropped the case in the sink and found that water was able to leak in. Luckily, it was a small amount of water and there was no damage to my iphone.<br /><br />On November 11, I sent the initial email to LifeProof concerning warranty issues. After a week and a half with no response, I sent another email. I finally received a response on November 30 in the afternoon. I wasn't able to reply right away and by about 6 pm on December 1, I received an email stating that if they didn't receive a response to their \\"final attempt\\" my \\"case\\" would be closed out.<br /><br />After responding to this email, I was advised that I should have taken a quiz on the website in order to register my case. I did this promptly. Emails told me to watch the setup and care videos, when I had already confirmed that I had, and asked for the serial number for the case without telling me that there actually TWO serial numbers, which further delayed the issue.<br /><br />Eventually, I did receive authorization to return the case for a replacement. It was mailed and says it was out for delivery to LifeProof on December 12.<br /><br />It is now January 2, 9 days short of 2 months after I sent the first email, and I have still not received a replacement case. I sent an inquiry today and was told that a replacement case has not been authorized, yet, and I was asked for my tracking number. I paid $57.50 for this case and literally have nothing to show for it. Meanwhile, I have been walking around with a completely unprotected iphone for nearly 2 months.<br /><br />I do want to clarifythat the case was offered through a different seller when I purchased it on Amazon. I have not had contact with the seller of my case or with the current seller. All of my experience has been directly with LifeProof.
B00A77II0U|3.0|I finished this game on &quot;difficult&quot; mode in about 45 min.<br />Game design was great,  good plot, no glitches but there ask asking too much money for what it is. I'd be willing to pay $1.00 but would  not recommend purchasing at the current price of $2.99.
B004ZJZQ5G|5.0|This movie is the most romantic thing I have ever watched. It's romance from a different time period where there isn't any cheesy pick up lines or one night stands .It's just love at its purest form.  Now a days it is hard to imagine a romantic movie without any form of affection but some it was done. I am in love with this movie and am extremely excited to have it in my possession. To anyone who is a hopeless romantic I suggest this movie.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|Product is great. Thank you very much for the beautiful product.  Can't say enough about it. Amazing product. Just wonderful.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Such a great book for dog lovers! This book offers a different insight from the eyes of our treasured furry friends.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It was free and it was challenging gave me something to do when you only have a few minutes of free time.
0593070720|5.0|My 18 year old daughter loved this book. She loved everything about it. Being able to interact on her ipad with the book cover was amazing. A fun read for the teenage girl who loves teen rock.
B0044RFT8S|4.0|Great movie for kids and parents alike. Our 3 year old absolutely loves animals, so this movie is tops for her!<br /><br />Highly recommended to anyone looking for a good movie for young ones.
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|We use this in our candle making company...Robin's Song Candle Company...to turn wine and beer bottles into candles. With just a couple of adjustments to the directions we get approximately 60% usable bottles with this.
B004159Y98|4.0|I've loved Damien for years. Fantastic songwriting and heart-felt vocals make for a wonderful listening for me. This is great album!
0394800184|5.0|it is adorable!!<br />great story. got it for the niece, she'll be three years old next month & i LOVE to read. & i really like this book.<br />so, a totally selfish & emotional purchase & gift, but my niece's mama says that her kids love to read too.<br />so it's an excellent gift!
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|Not for kids at all<br />It's very funny and has a lot of good meanings<br />Don't expect too much and you will enjoy it
B00634GHJA|1.0|bought this app today on amazon<br />with plans to transfer photos from my iphone to my new fire HD. didnt know i would have to buy the app for my idevices and android devices separately.dont think this is worth another 2.99 to buy from itunes. oh well...lesson learned.
0307591549|5.0|Having seen this author on PBS, it was challenging to learn more. The book is no slouch as it extends and repeats the simpler functions to make a change or to improve your life....leading to happier times since that was the goal. What most of us do not have is a format that can work for anyone.<br /><br />Learning the simple format of &#34;45 seconds of plan&#34; to the following &#34;21 days&#34; of implementation makes you changed. But not for a short term and then down to something that was stressful.  You also want to share what you learn and help your family, other friends and thus...share the happiness.  Not as some silly and temporary things but lasting.
B009E3EYMY|5.0|Priced right and what a concert, the old men still have what it takes to put on a great show
B002VWNID6|1.0|I received this dvd twice.  The movie on both the original and the replacement stopped playing part way through the disk.  Apparently, Amazon received a faulty supply of this movie.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|Love this app.  Very easy to follow.  Songs are a one time payment very reasonable and once purchased can be played on my other devices. Awesome.
B0053O89YM|5.0|Loved series 3. The story lines were great and  I particularly enjoyed being able to view it without the interruption of  commercials..
B000HAB4KS|5.0|Even though you may have seen this film before, it takes on a whole new fascination on Blu Ray. I highly recommend checking it out ~ the detail is gorgeous and you may not remember the story as well as  you think!
B005FISBTO|5.0|I do not have showtime, so waiting for the new seasons on dvd is the hard part. The good news is they never disappoint.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This a very enjoyable game. Easy to play, and yet each level provides an increasing challenge, make continued game play satisfying and fun.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|I wish I would have read the book before watching the movie.  This book is a good book, and a quick read,  but I would recommend seeing the movie after you read the book.  It got a little dry in places, because I knew what was happening.
B00447G2PM|4.0|I bought both this movie and Under the Sea 3D by IMAX to add to my 3D collection. I was disappointed this movie didn't get into real deep sea creatures with the lumincent bodies and wicked teeth but it does have a good variety. Kate and Depp where a nicer combination to listen to than Jim Carrey but I felt the 3D footage was better for Under the Sea and would choose it over the two. If you are going to get one nature sea video I would recommend Under the Sea but both are good and give that relaxing atmosphere to wonder into in the life of fish.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|This comes with two discs, I haven't taken the time to figure out why.  The movie is  awesome!  Great deal!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Excellent read. The most beautiful first kiss, love story that will melt your heart. And finding out the real meaning of the word Hopeless will make you fall in love with Holton.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|I picked up Ceremonials, the Deluxe edition, earlier this year, but it was seeing a couple of live performances of songs from Lungs that made me check out this band. Florence has an unbelievable voice, and the band has a driving, powerful sound that isn't hard rock, but at times suggests the intensity of hard rock. You can clearly hear the band progress in style and sophistication from Lungs to Ceremonials, but this is a great start from a band that will probably be around as long as they want to be.
630469654X|5.0|Arrived as advertised. Good playing condition. We enjoyed the horses in the movie. Older story, effects are so so, but it 's a nice enough movie. Would do business with seller again.
B0034G4P94|5.0|If you are interested in a multifaceted story, you'll enjoy this action filled, emotionally motivated movie about two brothers and their father reuniting.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|This application does what it is intended to be used for, social media and keeping up with the news and other interesting stories.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this game is lots of fun if you like to play solitare. would highly recommend it to anyone who likes this game.
B0026SCMNM|4.0|Interesting historical and romantic journey of a female Irish immigrant to America. Her struggles moving between the two cultures are highlighted. It's an interesting read. Toibin writes in an easy style with much attention to detail. I enjoyed it!
B00A757EFW|5.0|I have always been a big fan of Pac-Man! This is still a fun game to play and have to admit I am totally rusty, but now can play whenever since I downloaded it on my Kindle Fire for FREE!!
B00005RDRO|4.0|This was pretty good!  I enjoyed it!  I do tend to enjoy British drama more, but as this was recommended for me, I bought it, and it was worth the money.
B0011EU0NG|5.0|My girlfriend never saw this movie and I could not believe it. She loves it now. It is still the best classic and general all around movie ever made!!!!
1409136612|5.0|I have loved every book that Maeve Binchy has written, and this is no exception!  A very short book--it can be read in a day--but very satisfying nonetheless!
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|don't like that you can't earn gems other than at Colosseum. should be better ways to get than have to buy them with real $$!!! how ridiculous!
B00AAX68HG|4.0|This game is wonderful it's way better than cut the rope I recommend this game for any it's super easy to learn and anyone can play it
B004BRQYJ4|5.0|Cher still going strong.  This was a great movie, with great music.  Cher has still got it.  This music is also some great music to add to your exercise song list.  It makes you want to get up and move.<br />Eileen
B00081U7HC|5.0|Fantastic Movie. Very funny and romantic. Classic Julia Roberts. My daughter and I really like it a lot. Thank you.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This is a great game and who would actually complain after all it is free!!!  I am really enjoying this and I'm not the only one in my house.
0345803485|1.0|Honestly, it sounds like Arnold Schwarzenegger could be a potential cast for Christian Grey. Throughout the entire novel, Grey continuously, and breathlessly utters the word \\"baby\\" during every sex scene - which is a lot and becomes increasingly comical with each use. All I can picture is Arnold saying \\"Hasta la vista, baby\\". Seriously, if they make this book into a movie, I hope Christian Grey doesn't get any speaking parts. His character throughout the book is so two-dimensional and underdeveloped it just makes him come off as superficial and definitely NOT intelligent. With lines like, \\"Do you like cheese, Ana?\\" and \\"he pushes his nose into her pubic hair and inhales\\" is so god-awful hilarious. How can anyone take this book seriously??
B000L53D4O|2.0|My nephew likes it but it gets boring quickly... the activities it has are not really to exciting so he gets bored quickly.
B003QWRA3Y|3.0|This movie wasn't to bad, however it should have been free. It was okay if your into a little fun!
143911000X|5.0|Well written and hilarious! Hours and hours of great reading- and you might learn something. It is LEGEND.....wait for it....DARY!
B009X01FJS|5.0|Case is paded enough to protect my Kindle if I drop it.  It is also convenient that it revolves. I'm really glad I choose this one.
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|I have been a fan forever. Although it isn't as &#34;hard&#34; as their earlier stuff, my tastes have evolved just like their sound. I see them live every time they come through Chicago. LP is far and away my favorite band. Living Things will not disappoint.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|The movie had funny moments but defiantly not worth the price in theaters. It's barely worth the sale price of $1.99, I'm sorry I didn't wait for it to be free online.
B005ZOCF5E|4.0|Only a third of the way in so far but this book is shaping up to be of equal quality to Reynolds other works which I have enjoyed very much.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Very entertaining. What a twisted, tortured ride. Your left feeling sorry, sad, scared and angry at Amy all at the same time.....
1419705849|5.0|The part that Greg goes in the playing tubes to rescue Manny and a child throws up in a corner Greg got stucked with Manny and a worker had to rescue Manny and Greg!<br /><br />I have all the diary of a wimpy kid movies and books except this one but now i have it for kindle and soon for real live.<br /><br />I live in peru and i leaarn english in Markham college.<br /><br />I am nearly nine years old so i have eight and a half.
030746363X|5.0|This book helped me lose 40lbs in 3 months, and has changed my life. I purchased this book aprox 3 months after it was first available due to<br />reccomendations from my boss and his wife and I personally feel it is one of the best books I've ever purchased, and one of the few life changing things I've ever owned at the age of 42. I had been doing circuit training, still do and love it, for almost 3 years now about 2-3 hours a week and this book was what helped md the most to lose the weight. 5 other coworkers lost more than myself due to the book and everyone I reccomend the book to thanks me after seeing equal or better results. The book is great, can't say enough about it.
B00AA0TJO8|2.0|fantastic idea! But it's really hard to control and you die easily. I had to play the second level like 8 times. And it's kind of hard, hard to figure out what your supposed to do.
B006LSZECO|2.0|GONE GIRL:  By the end of this novel, I found myself quite irritated with both of the protagonists and did not care about either one of them.  The ending is weak and unsatisfying.  The novel did draw the reader in at the point at which Amy &#34;goes missing.&#34;  I would not recommend this book.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|It was very cute and kids were glued to it the whole time. Would watch it again. It was awesome.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|This is a different twist on the it's me or him story.  The jokes were funny and I'm pretty sure most teenage boys would find it hilarious.  I like a lot of that humor so I was pleased with the video.  I didn't give it 5 stars because it wasn't spectacular, but few movies are.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Patricia Cornwell is one of my favorite authors.  Each year, I eagerly await her new creation.  It would be wonderful to have two or three new books each year!<br /><br />I just love Scarpetta!
B0026P3G12|5.0|She has a great voice! Very relaxing to listen to when driving long distances. Loud music makes one anxious; this is soothing!
B0061PEAUY|5.0|Kathy Reichs is one of my favorite authors.  Each year, I eagerly await her new creation.  It would be wonderful to have two or three new books each year!<br /><br />The books about Temperance Brennan are definitely better than the TV version.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|I thought the book maze runner was very  heartfelt and a pleasure to read. I cannot wait to read the next novel
B007THA4FI|2.0|I loved the Harry Potter books, I read all of them from July 22 to Oct. 23 an number of years ago. ( work full time as well as all my other obligationa)<br />I read the entire book  and just did not enjoy it
B005LAIHQS|5.0|I liked all three of them but MIB3 was definitely the best of the trilogy. I really liked how this movie tied in small details from the previous 2 movies and the time travel detailing was really cool.
B008IGP8QE|5.0|Got this for my little sister but I got obsessed with it too! Great CD with all of Austin's familiar songs he sings on the show. Great songs that are perfect for the car, during a workout, or any time of the day! :)
B005UDD1R6|1.0|works sometimes on Amz Kindle.<br />But I have little tolerance for inconsistency. Often I have to do a full shut down and reboot to get it to work again.
B004AKCME8|5.0|Great kids family movie! My daughter had read the books and loves owls so thought, &#34;why not?&#34;. Turned out to be a movie the whole family loved.
B005EY2XFC|5.0|This has turned out to be my favorite movie of all times.  At first glance it seems to be a movie about revenge and violence.  It actually turns out to be a love story showing that love transends through time; that real love lasts forever.  Brandon Lee IS the Crow, he can never be replaced and he will always be remembered.  Rest in Peace Brandon.
0920668372|5.0|In my opinion, a must have for every child's library. A sweet story I've read over and over with very cute illustrations.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|The plot end the ending leave you breathless. All you want is to know how it all ends . I loved it. It kept you regarding until the very end. AMAZING!!!!!!
B005CMSDKA|3.0|Here I sit shifting back and forth between \\"I don't like it, or \\"it's okay,\\" or \\"I like it,\\" because each description was true for long portions of the film. I mean, originally I recorded it but then I was so impressed with the first quarter hour or so that I bought it and couldn't wait for it to come. That'll teach me caution! For the moment I'm landing on the three-star option because I DID really like WATCHING most of it just because it is visually sumpuous, as are the three leading actors, all of whom are also gifted and captivating. At the same time, though, I'm close to agreeing with a one-star reviews that advised viewers to turn off the TV when Hanna flips the switch to let her whereabouts be known to the Wicked Witch. The only reason I'm not in full agreement is that the Witch is played by Blanchett and I enjoyed every scene that she is in. I also agree with a one-star review that scolds the movie, or the heroine, for wasting time and energy beating up her merely mortal father, Eric Bana, when there are actual villains out there. Coming-of-age film or not, this spoiled brat should have learned to control her temper by now! More seriously, the film should have made up its mind whether it is a thriller with a teenage girl as assassin, which would had my vote, or science fiction with a mystery element, or a coming-of-age saga with a heroine who has does have some unusual issues to deal with, or a fairy tale. I confess to a bias against modern fairy tales because they lack the bite and complexity of the originals, but certainly I've found exceptions. This is not one, and every time a Disney element intrudes here -- and Disney bullplop dominates the last third of the film -- my husband and I groaned aloud. Ultimately there was far too much groaning.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I gave this app one less star cause it does not turn night and there are no mobs so I hope they fix that
0785163174|5.0|Well done crossover event, seeing as it's been built up to since House of M. It's a great read and well worth the price here.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|God as a gift for someone who loves Star Wars and they loved it.  Even made me watch a marathon of them all.
B00770KR7W|4.0|I bought this for my 7 year old son for Christmas.  He loved it.  I even liked it because of all the detail on it. Now my younger son wants one in a different color.  So I will be shopping again soon
B0090O07S2|5.0|My fiance had an extensive Christmas list, and this was one of them. I was able to get them well before Christmas, and he realy loves it!  :)
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Wonderful kid game!  I love how it was free and the fact that you don't have to use real money to play. ALthough on a down side when trying to get neighbors they don't show up and you cant visit them half the time, this is why I give it 4 stars and not 5.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|This is the last one I purchased for Christmas. Everything was shipped on time, and some of them very hard to find, so my fiancee was very pleased with his presents!  :)
B0081SPK0I|5.0|This game is very fun and easy to use! An easy game with lots of course options. A great way to kill time.
B0056TYT66|5.0|Both the USB and SATA connections work well on my i7 Win7 computer.  It is nice that there are two power connectors (you can use either, don't need to connect both).<br /><br />The Speed of the SATA seems to be slower than the SATA connector on my mother board (transfer rate to SSD is slower), but not by much.<br /><br />You need to download drivers from the web,  and the driver version depends on the Serial number of the board,  So write the SN down before installing the card (or copy it from the box).<br /><br />Came with SATA cable, and both tall and short brackets.
1590171993|5.0|Williams' Stoner is a classic, a novel in which nothing much happens, yet everything happens.  The title character gets me where I live.  Highly recommend.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I loved the game I wish it was longer and had more hidden objects puzzles ...I also wish they would let you know when there was more important objects in a scene so you don't go in circles and use the hint so much .
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love the book & the price was much cheaper than most book stores.  Shopping online is so convenient for me too!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book.  The never ending twists and turns.  The adventure and action.  This is one book that everyone should read!
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|The product listed above is a great product.  It shines in HD cinematic glory.  So, if you are interested in seeing this movie, Amazon Instant Video is a great way to go.<br /><br />The reason for the Title is: It's a nearly 3 hour movie, with 33 minutes of Batman in it (SPOILER. most of it is him getting his butt kicked.).  It does not directly follow the Dark Knight movie.  (at the ending of Dark Knight we are told that Batman must be chased because he is the hero we need right now.) This would lead us to believe the next movie would pick up with the police chasing Batman.  SPOILER ALERT!!!  It picks up 8 years later.)  It's filled with plot holes.)<br /><br />Lastly, the dialogue is brilliant if....You have suntitles, which amazon Instant video does nopt yet provide.  You will only understand 2/3rds of wehat Bane says.  I just saw this yesterday with subtitles and found out he has the best lines.  So if you are going to purchase this, get it on Blu-Ray.
B008476HBM|5.0|One of the best books, or maybe the best book I've ever read! I loved it!!!! I am excited to watch the movie, then I will read this book again and again!
B00846REIS|3.0|Definitely a spin off of Fifty shades series. Not nearly as well written. Still an interesting story a little smuttier
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I have been watching NCIS for many years and have never been disappointed especially since they added Miss Ziva David. She and Abby seem to bring out the best acting of all the stars and Ducky is unbelivable! I watched him in The Man from U.N.C.L.E. and cannot believe he is his age. He is a great actor and makes it look too easy, wonderful wonderful show. When it stops airing I will be very sad.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this game, staying up too late playing it!<br />Fun &amp; easy to learn strategies.. you also get do over in order to learn.
B009ANP4F4|1.0|The dvd was broken when we received it, not happy. We will be sending this back ASAP. The DVD had to have been broken in route or before it was even sent either way I didn't get what I purchased.
B000JMKQX0|1.0|I am a avid reader. I will finish a book even if it is bad, simply because I have to know the ending.<br /><br />For the first time, I don't freakin care.<br /><br />I usually get pissed when they make movies out of books and change things, but I hope like hell the movie is nothing like the book.<br /><br />I don't understand how it got some many 5 star reviews..Are they being paid??!! LOL
B007BT0RKG|1.0|This app is useless, I guess you have to upgrade to the paid version to get any use. Google maps is much better.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I was genuinely pleased with the demo offered, it was a no-brainer that I'd pick up the full game unlock. Highly recommended for anyone just looking to pass time with something full of simply elegant challenges.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|this is truly an amazing book. Read it. It's a tad bit depressing, but endure through to the end and it will do you good.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|this is a good game to play when I gave my daughter this game to play she made my battery die
034580404X|5.0|I know that some people have commented that these books are nothing but sex, but I found the story very interesting. I loved the trilogy. From the very first I was hooked into the story and just had to know what was going to happen next. I would, and have, recommended this trilogy to all romance lovers.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Great for a family movie day. Young and old, popcorn and a fire. Love the voice work. Even my teenaged boys and their friends have watched this. Will become a classic.
B000KJU1HI|5.0|dylan just does it for me - since i was 11-12 - and he was just a kid too - now i'm 60 and he's 70 - got to see him in victoria a couple of years ago - watched don't look back with my sis and my 80 year old mom on new years eve - we all loved it - my mom because hey she remembers woody too and we all remember bob seeger - so the timelessness of it all - if you think at all - i love the way bob dylan says what he means and feels - at least that's my take -
B008NEMN0K|5.0|If you havent't seen this movie then you are definitely missing out. Great action packed film and it has Will Smith. Very good in 3D as well
B005COO1X6|2.0|Ok...Stephen King is amazing, I Love ALL his work...but the ending here was a bit much. I was reminded of the conclusion to \\"Under the Dome\\", face-palm and all. Started strong and ended with a °pop° instead of a **BANG!!**.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|fun to play. wish it was longer. worth the extra 3 dollars to play the full game. I could not stop playing once I started.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|I'm a fan of hidden object games, and this one isn't bad at all. pinch/zoom works, but it seems to count as a 'hit', which can count against you and cause a  time penalty. Also, the hit detection is a bit fussy - I touched the correct object the times and it just didn't register. My only real problem has been the flashlight level - you need to guide the light to see the object, but your finger is right in the way, and using pinch/zoom with the flashlight was utterly miserable.  Still, a decent game. I find it very playable on my Samsung 3g.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I like the look of clock. I find the blue very soothing. Also the sounds that can be chosen from to wake up to are really good. I picked Good Morning,but I also liked the sound of the old fashioned alarm clock. I think it's cute that they included that as an option. Very pleased with this app.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|THIS IS AN EASY READ, INTERESTING CONCEPT, FAIRLY FAST PACED.  It was absorbing enough that I look forward to the next book.
030758836X|5.0|Gone Girl was a gift. The reaction was ecstatic. If she is pleased, then I am pleased<br />Must wait until book is actually read for overall rating. But I suspect no less than 5 stars.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Clint Eastwood gives a powerful and emotional performance.  Very enjoyable movie!  Highly recommended although there is some cursing, but mild compared to other movies and TV shows.
B0091LS07E|5.0|As an Alicia Keys fan, I found Girl On Fire to be just that. Alicia Keys does not let her fans<br />down. Again she proves to be mainstream and typical Alicia. Very pleased with CD.
B007KQI1NA|3.0|I bought this GPS receiver to complement my serial Garmin GPS 18x LVC receiver (to which I will compare the BU-353-S4) as having a USB-based receiver like the BU-353-S4 is more convenient in certain situations -- the 18x requires both a serial port (or serial-to-USB adapter) and (in my configuration) a USB port for 5V power while the BU-353-S4 requires only a single USB port.<br /><br />Caveat: the Garmin 18x LVC is a \\"bare wire\\" unit designed for Original Equipment Manufacturers or advanced users who are comfortable fabricating their own end-of-cable connectors -- it does not come with any sort of connectors like a serial or USB connector. The 18x line of receivers also has a version with a serial connector and a 12V car power cord and a USB version that only communicates using the Garmin binary data format instead of standard NMEA-0183 sentences.<br /><br />The BU-353-S4 is designed for ordinary users who want a simple plug-and-play USB-based GPS receiver that speaks NMEA-0183 out of the box (this is nearly everyone). In that regard, it's quite good but with a few quirks.<br /><br />**********<br /><br />General Overview<br />The unit is compact and easy to use. The magnetic base and waterproof construction make it suitable for use on a vehicle roof and it is sensitive enough to receive signals through most car windshields (though ones with heat-rejecting metal films may block the signal). Simply plug it into a computer with the appropriate drivers (see below), place it where it can see the sky, and it works exactly as expected and delivers standard NMEA-0183 formatted sentences to compatible software (essentially all GPS-related computer software) over a virtual serial port (again, nearly all GPS-related software expects to connect to the receiver using a serial connection, so this is great).<br /><br />**********<br /><br />Pros<br />- Easy installation.<br />- Only one USB port needed.<br />- Quick acquisition of satellites when presented with a clear view of the sky.<br />- Shows up as a serial device, and so works great with nearly all GPS software.<br />- I've verified that it works with Windows 7 32 and 64-bit as well as Ubuntu 12.10 and Linux Mint 14 using gpsd.<br />- Satellite information is retained when unplugged for a few days so it can reacquire signal very quickly after being powered down for a bit so long as it hasn't moved much.<br />- Rubber ring on the bottom prevents scratching whatever surface it's attached to, such as the roof of a car.<br />- A small LED indicates if the device has power and, if flashing, has locked onto satellites and calculated a position. This is useful, particularly for troubleshooting.<br /><br />Cons<br />- No success with SBAS augmentation at this point in time. I'll update this if it becomes available.<br />- Available \\"GPSinfo\\" software from the Globalsat website is terrible, and the documentation/manual available from them is very basic.<br />- By default, GPRMC, GPGSA, and GPGGA sentences are emitted every second while GPGSV sentences are emitted every 5 seconds. Most comparable receivers emit all four sentences every second. This is weird but not a major issue: it just means that information about the satellites (such as their position in the sky overhead as well as the measured signal strength from them) is only updated every 5 seconds instead of every second.<br />- My navigation software is reporting that the GPGSV sentences are malformed in some way, even with default settings. I'm still looking into this.<br />- In order to make any configuration changes (such as what and how often sentences are transmitted) you need to use the SiRFDemo software which is not included. While Amazon won't let me link directly to it, you can find it in topic ID# 3562.0 on the user forum on the USGlobalsat website. This is a major hassle for ordinary users.<br />- Useful information for navigation, such as the estimated uncertainty in horizontal position, vertical position, and velocity isonly available in SiRFDemo while using the SiRF binary protocol. This information is not available in the NMEA-0183 output.<br />- Configuration information is not saved to non-volatile memory. The device has a supercapacitor to power the internal volatile memory (which contains the configuration changes) but this will discharge over time. The discharge time is not specified in the manual, so if the device is idle for some time it will reset back to the default configuration. The Garmin 18x stores this data in non-volatile NVRAM and so can retain settings indefinitely without power.<br />- Magnet in base is not as strong as the Garmin 18x. It hasn't been a problem for regular driving up to around 60mph but may be an issue at very high speeds. (Potential issue: The puck, when viewed from the side, has an interesting shape: it's curved on top, wide in the middle, and tapers towards the base. This looks like it could have moving air apply upward force, potentially lifting the receiver off the roof at very high speeds. I haven't actually observed this to happen, but it's something to note.)<br />- The only mounting option is the magnet. The Garmin 18x has a screw receptacle on the bottom that allows for a more permanent mounting but the BU-353-S4 does not.<br /><br />**********<br /><br />Technical Details<br />The BU-353-S4 \\"puck receiver\\" is slightly smaller than the 18x and has a diameter of roughly 5.4cm (not including the USB cable, which emerges from the side of the unit). It has a single USB cable which serves to supply power and transmit/receive data.<br /><br />The receiver includes a built-in serial-to-USB adapter and uses the Prolific PL2303 chipset for this purpose. Drivers are available on the US Globalsat website and from Prolific's site. Windows 7 32-bit offers a completely automatic, plug-and-play installation of the drivers from Windows Update. Windows 7 64-bit requires that you manually download the drivers and conveniently directs you to the exact page on the Prolific site where you can download them. After the drivers are installed, the receiver appears as a standard COM port to which most GPS-related software can connect.<br /><br />I don't have a Mac or Windows 8 system but other reviews indicate it works well.<br /><br />The device is completely plug-and-play with Ubuntu Linux 12.10 and Linux Mint 14 using gpsd: no additional drivers are needed. Simply plug in the device, configure gpsd to connect to it on /dev/ttyUSB0 (the exact device may vary, but that's the default one) and it works perfectly.<br /><br />The device claims that it is WAAS/EGNOS-capable (WAAS and EGNOS are, respectively, the North American and European systems for augmenting GPS to provide additional accuracy and integrity checking). In general, such systems are called \\"Satellite Based Augmentation Systems\\" or \\"SBAS\\". Standard GPS provides an accuracy of around 10 meters while SBAS-augmented position fixes can be as accurate as 2 meters.<br /><br />While the BU-353-S4 works perfectly with standard GPS signals, I have not been able to get this receiver to work correctly with EGNOS even though it appears to have the SBAS feature enabled: it has a clear view to the EGNOS satellites and strong signals (SNR is in the 35-45 range) but neither locks onto them nor uses them in the navigation solution even after more than 24 hours of continuous operation. Sometimes it will track one EGNOS satellite for hours but never lock on, while other times it will hop between different EGNOS satellites. As a comparison, my Garmin 18x LVC will get EGNOS signal within about a minute or so. It is unclear if this is an issue with this product line in general or only with the specific unit I received. I have been in contact with Globalsat and will post and relevant updates below.<br /><br />SBAS augmentation is useful for more accurate position fixes but isn't terribly important when used for road navigation as most software will \\"lock\\" the car to the nearest roadeven if the computed position is slightly off the road. For most vehicular uses, even off-road ones, there's no real advantage to having 2m position fixes compared to 10m position fixes.<br /><br />With a SiRFstarIV GPS chipset, the receiver works very well under a clear sky (such as when positioned on a car roof). It acquires and locks onto satellites very quickly. It's able to recover from momentary loss of signal (e.g. driving through a tunnel which blocks the signals) within a second or so. It is essentially equal in sensitivity to the Garmin 18x and works great with a clear sky view, though it seems to lose lock more easily in marginal conditions (such as inside my apartment window) than the 18x even when both are reporting similar signal levels.<br /><br />With a good sky view and a suitable number of satellites, the accuracy of the fix seems to be comparable to the Garmin 18x.<br /><br />The SiRFDemo application, which is not provided but can be acquired as described above, allows for a lot of useful options and technical information, but its usefulness is limited because the data is only available in the SIRF binary data format, not as NMEA-0183 standard sentences.<br /><br />**********<br /><br />Bottom line: for the (current at the time of this post) price of less than $36 you get a simple little GPS receiver that's perfectly suitable for most vehicle navigation. For that purpose, I recommend it.<br /><br />If it weren't for the SBAS issues it'd get a solid four stars. The 5-second default for GPGSV sentences is weird but not a big deal, though combined with the atrocious GPSinfo software, limited documentation, and lack of more configuration options prevent me from giving it that fifth star.<br /><br />That said, I prefer the Garmin GPS 18x series (particularly the LVC model due to its pulse-per-second output being useful for timekeeping) because it has a better lock in marginal signal conditions, working SBAS support, includes the option for more permanent screw mounting, better configuration software and documentation, sensible defaults, and a stronger magnetic base.<br /><br />The BU-353-S4 has the advantage over the Garmin 18x USB in that the Garmin 18x USB model outputs data only in the proprietary Garmin data format and requires software on the computer to convert the data to NMEA standard sentences to work with common navigation software (this limitation only applies to the Garmin 18x USB model; the serial and LVC models can output data in either NMEA or Garmin binary). The BU-353-S4 outputs data by default in the standard NMEA format, and so is a bit more \\"plug and play\\" than the 18x USB.<br /><br />My uses and expectations may vary somewhat from the average user, so please bear that in mind.<br /><br />Still, if you're in the market for an inexpensive, simple, USB-based GPS receiver for a computer in your vehicle, the BU-353-S4 will likely be quite satisfactory.<br /><br />**********<br /><br />Update 2013-01-09: After some communication with USGlobalsat, they confirm that this model has a firmware bug in the SiRF receiver chipset that prevents it from using WAAS/EGNOS signals. Evidently SiRF is investigating the problem. It's not clear if SiRF/USGlobalsat will release a firmware update that will fix the issue nor if only a subset of the receivers have the bug. More as I get it. According to USGlobalsat, if one needs WAAS/EGNOS support and is not concerned with Windows 8 compatibility then one should consider the BU-353 (the non-S4 version) as that has the slightly older SiRFstarIII chipset and is not affected by the bug affecting the SiRFstarIV chip.
B005RUUUAI|4.0|In fact. I am probably cancelling netflix for good this month because of it.<br /><br />Cannot beat amazon's deal and netflix is just redundant to me.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I love to play mounting its a real challenge it keeps your brain sharp. it can be frustrating but it is a good challenge game. and it's a good price.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I thought that the final book of the hunger games was a good book because (don't read this part if you haven't read the book yet) she doesn't kill Snow, he dies himself, she (Katniss) didn't die, and she fell in love with Peeta and had two kids with him.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I'M GLAD I WAITED FOR THE COMBO SET TO COME OUT RATHER THAN BUYING EACH INDIVIDUALLY. WHAT I PAID FOR THE SET WAS JUST A LITTLE MORE THAN WHAT I WOULD HAVE PAID FOR ONE BLUE RAY ON RELEASE.
B001DHXT2U|5.0|Like order I will order again if needed. It was a gift for my sister it's great purchase thank you.
B007FG9LIE|2.0|Predictable. Story Iine done too many times. I love monsters but not when they can't make you believe they could be real.

0671449028|4.0|Colorful illustrations, cute story, easy to read and understand for 2-yr old (read by a 7-yr old). I think well-worth purchase.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was so much more than I ever expected. I absolutely loved it. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great read.
B009MF56GC|4.0|Just more crazy in your face nonstop action and violence that you come to expect from this franchis and I loved every monute of it. It is a guys guy movie so ladies sorry you might want to sit this one out. Turn your brain off and just enjoy the cray ride with all your favorite action stars as they destroy everything in their paths.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Awesome story, I could not put it down. Must read!!! I may name my first born child Holder, great character.
B00993FEUK|4.0|Yes it looks at feels sorta like Coraline but I think that movie was better than this one but this is still a very good movie to purchase and watch. It's about a weird little boy that likes horror stuff and you come to find out that he can see ghosts and stuff and he has to save his town from a group of zombies and an evil spirit. Very nice stop motion too. I fully recommend it.
B007T9UIMA|5.0|This live One Direction tour DVD is the best, and is an awesome gift for any One Direction fan in the world. This DVD lets 1D fans watch the concert at home without paying the large amount of money for tickets to the live show. I hope your 1D fans enjoy this awesome, jam packed, One Direction Live tour DVD, filled with music, music videos, and interviews with the lads. Enjoy.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Funny enjoyable movie. I've seen it two times now and I'll probably watch it again and I never rewatch movies.
B0095J0AL6|5.0|One Direction has out done themselves with this awesome yearbook limited edition of the new album &#34;Take Me Home&#34;, this album contains 17 new songs including the hit singles &#34;Little Things&#34;, and &#34;Live While Were young&#34;. In my opinion the best songs on the album are &#34;Rock Me&#34;, and &#34;Kiss You&#34;. This album is a must buy for any One Direction fan in the world. Since this is a yearbook edition of the album, the CD comes inside of a picture book that has a bunch of photos of the band and photos of the biggest One Direction fans in the world.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Awesome read as always.  Loved it from start to finish. Can't wait until fall to find out how they make out.
B008XNZMOU|3.0|Taylor Swift's new album called RED has finally been released, This album contains 16 new songs feat: her top songs &#34;I Knew You Were Trouble&#34;, and &#34;We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together&#34;. Which are the only good songs on the whole album except her other song &#34;22&#34; which is very catchy. This album was lame in my opinion but I can see it being a huge hit with die hard Taylor Swift Fans. I recommend it to Taylor Swift fans, but to non Taylor Swift fans I recommend you save your money or just buy Justin Bieber's new album &#34;Believe&#34; Instead because it is way better.
B007PVHMCG|1.0|When I saw the price of this Lego set, I was a little leary, but thought \\"Hey, it comes with over four hundred pieces.\\"  My son LOVES minecraft, so I bought this for him for Christmas.  I was unpleasantly surprised at the small size of the box when it arrived, but again, gave it the benefit of the doubt.  There's a lot of pieces in that small box. I was even more unpleasantly surprised when he opened it.  All of them are the TINY square lego's.  ALL of them.  I can't believe I paid 60 bucks for this thing.
0062213423|5.0|This autobiography is written by One Direction themselves, It goes through each band member and they tell you about themselves and how they became One Direction.<br /><br />This book is a must buy for all One Direction fan's.
B00004YRQA|5.0|item came, and it worked. what else can i say about a memory card? i would buy again. recommended if you have a game you want to save your progress.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Wow. Wow wow wow. THIS BOOK IS AWESOME! This is most certainly my favorite book of all. My intellectual interests were caught immediately by this highly sophisticated novel. Collins has made this novel a very suspenseful, creative, lurking book. I am having nightmares about it. That's how good it is. Especially with the Sciurus Americanus, or, the killer monkeys. Anyways I believe that that is the scientific name for it. This is my third favorite book. Thank you Collins. (In high pitched voice) Bye bye, y'all. Yuck, yuck, yuck, that's a knee slapper.
630382790X|5.0|if you do not have this in your library then i suggest you buy it for sure! keeps you on the edge of your seat. very action packed. i give 5 star

B000BTC5LW|5.0|if you do not own this i suggest you buy it. this is great for any library. that concert itself is amazing and the sound is great. the show is just amazing its a must buy.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was the first novel I read written by Nicholas sparks and I can say I'll keep reading his  novels. The one thing I liked most about this book is ,for me , the surprising end . Sparks knows how to catch your interest and feelings.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Connelly books never fail to impress.  His characters are multi-dimensional and interesting. Purchase this book for a thrilling ride and a satisfying read
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was amazing and I  couldn't get my eyes off the pages. It was my favorite from all the books I read
B0091REZMW|4.0|good game but could use better help options. I've just started playing the game, so if I'm wrong about the help options I'll come back and change my review!
B009X012XM|3.0|I think, for the price, this case is cheaply made.  Very disappointed in the quality. Would not buy again. Live and learn.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|Streamed it live for my 5 and 6 year old. They loved it !! Animation is good. Streaming service worked great. Watching the credits indicated that it was done by the Disney India studio. Quick way to kill 90 minutes.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|love the story, great tale! Great Mother-daughter Movie!  the entire family enjoyed it and my children are 17 and 22!
B00AA7O22U|3.0|What happens when you put every major name together in a single movie? Nothing !! The story line is obviously designed to develop a bullets per minute mentality. The flying scenes are un-realistic. The sniper shooting is pretty incredible in a couple of scenes. Overall, a mindless 2 hours with lots of action. Storyline is not very good.
B006OOHYIC|3.0|Played it for a while. Got bored of it after a couple of hours. No desire to complete the rest of the levels.
B000JMLDCS|5.0|Chesterton is witty and thoughtful. He clearly expresses his journey in spirituality and practicality in the nature of belief, religion, and compares different thought systems of his day against Orthodox Christianity. I believe a seeker would do well to read this book by one who honestly reports his search.
B002WV5A9G|3.0|It is nice to see old faces again.  The effects are very good, but the story line is not well written, captain Kirk is depicted as a violent person
B006CQLGXG|5.0|True to the original. Love the illustrations which look like what would have been in the original. Easy to read font and so far no glaring mis-hyphenations (which bug me no end). I read A Christmas Carol every year and having such a convenient &#34;copy&#34; is really handy as I shop and read while I eat my lunch.
159562015X|5.0|This is around the 30th copy of this book that I have bought.  This is a very good inexpensive tool to help team members Idenitrify and learn to leverage their strengths.
B000VHMF0A|5.0|Excellent Marley music for anyone.  The Extended cut is fantastic for those that want more of what Bob sounded like.<br />The 1st CD is worth it by itself.
B008GXHOFW|3.0|I am looking for help to download and install this app. Since purchasing in Sep 2012, I haven't been able to do either because \\"You do not have enough available space on your memory card to install the game.\\" I have deleted ALL applications in an effort to have enough space on my kindle fire, and now all that remain are the pre-installed apps. Still, it says I need about 400MB of more space!! Not sure if I will ever get to enjoy [[ASIN:B008GXHOFW The Amazing Spider-Man (Kindle Tablet Edition)]]. Please help.
B009NXV2RK|3.0|Just so so. I reckon about 20% Tom Clancy and 80% Mark Greaney. The characters lacked depth and the plot was clumsy. Also this feels like part of a series  and relies to some extent on the reader's familiarity with the characters from previous books. You get the feeling that the author is getting a little lazy and is riding on the success of previous best-sellers.<br />Final verdict:  Okay, but could do much better, and will need to or risk losing readers.
B000GCFY0I|2.0|Unfortunately, this book was poorly written. So poorly written I could only read a couple of pages at a time before putting it down and coming back to it another day. Sure, I initially picked up the book understanding it is a young adult novel - probably not a literary novel - I can give it some forgiveness. But the writting was so immensely juvenile I felt I was reading a book meant for 8 year old children. My forgiveness can only extend so far. I am curious why this book is so popular. Sure, I can give it 2 stars for originality.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|game works great on phone and I enjoy the make your own hero and friend. can't wait for more games by hitcents.
B004UJAOLM|1.0|I usually stay away from classics since most likely I won't like it at all, but since I like romance and heard that Wuthering Heights is a great classic story, I decided to give it try.<br /><br />I just don't see how can this be a great classic romance story. There was hardly any romance. The characters aren't likeable that I just wanted them to just die basically. The whole story was just so boring and had this dark depressing feeling to it, which basically is the main point of the story.<br /><br />This will be the first and last time that I will read Wuthering Heights. Good thing I downloaded the book for free and didn't spend a penny on it.
B0026P3G12|4.0|Fell in love with her Voice on the TV and just had to get this one, very pleased with the CD............DE

B005LAIH4A|4.0|our kids are 4 and 5 1/2 and we also just got it for our 3 year old niece.  Very cute movie.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Reading Sci-Fi? Sometimes. The last I remember is King's 'Tommyknockers.' Three things influenced me in getting this one. The title, price and quality of writing. Discovering that wool is used in cleaning outside the silo has got to be the greatest title ever. As for the price? I'll take five hundred pages for six bucks any day. Last but not least is the writing. This one is solid all the way through. My only knock is that the last two books began to feel tired and my interest waned. I scanned the last thirty pages to see how it would come out. Was the author tired at this point? The ending felt kind of bland and what about the children in the abandoned silo? It seemed more of a distraction than anything else. I also think that the reader is a little bit cheated with the manner of evil IT guy's ending. What, no showdown with the girl that he cast out? The scene was okay but not great. Not that I didn't enjoy the read. I couldn't put the first three books down. Yeah it's Sci-Fi but believable for the most part. That's what appeals to me the most.
0525952926|2.0|I do not like hardback books.  Hardback books are too heavy to carry around and/or read in bed.  Therefore,  I tear out the pages to read.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Confusing at times but really good read-loved it a lot. Sparks is one of my favorite authors so it wasn't hard to pick this book.
1469220652|2.0|I did not expect an audio cassette.  I do not have anything to listen to it on, therefore, I was looking for a soft back book.
B009VB998I|4.0|Filled with Disney magic. We loved the artistry, and the story about the sisters and their love for eah other and wanting to stay together. Some of the fairies images were on the edge of being in appropriate for young viewers as opposed to being just pretty...not the best message for little girls. Otherwise, we loved it.
B004WR125O|3.0|It worked beautifully for 3 weeks, now it doesn't respond. I first noticed it when the ipad and iphone remotes stopped working.<br />It will not pick up wifi at all.<br />I haven't finished diagnoses yet, may need to correct review after that is done.

B0053O89RY|5.0|Favorite show and a hit for the whole family. We watched over the holidays with grandparents, aunts, uncles, in-laws and everyone was laughing. :)
B0076DELIG|5.0|Michael Connelly's character, Harry Bosch continues to excite readers in his latest book &#34;The Black Box.&#34;  Just when you think Bosch has the deck stacked against him and evil will overcome good, Connelly's creating writing genius kicks into high gear.  Connelly has developed this character over time (and a number of books) that you think has seen and done it all only to be surprised again every time you turn the page in his newest thriller.
B0071T4BVC|4.0|A jazzy take on some very old songs that is surprisingly delightful. Nice music for relaxing. Add to your collection.
B002YCVX5S|5.0|From cast to dialog, from storyline to direction, and from cinematography to action sequences, Tarentino has outdone himself. Another masterpiece.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Sweet. Gets a little annoying with all of the Eagles stuff, but still pretty good. Obviously predictable when he gets letters from Nikki. It is what it is.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Thorough storytelling to end the trilogy.  More about Bruce Wayne than Batman which fans of the Nolan series are looking for.  Might be too dark and deep for younger children to appreciate.  They will see less of Batman too.<br /><br />Watched this movie via Amazon Video on the PS3.  A+ experience with the HD streaming service.
B0054XOMX4|5.0|My kids are crazy over these things, and this bey has won every battle they had, it has gotten so bad, I had to order another one because my youngest would not use any other bey, so of course his brother refused to play with him.  Once the second one comes in, they can go toe to toe with the same bey.
B009439HEY|3.0|As a lover of the pre-80's Genesis and owner of Revisited 1, I was happy to see this effort emerge.  Upon my first listen though I found myself yearning for the voice of Phil Collins on some of the tracks.  I realize that is not what Mr. Hackett was going for here, but how amazing it would have been for the present day Mr. Collins to sing &#34;Supper's Ready&#34; or any of the other songs he did so well in their original or &#34;Seconds Out&#34; form.  And while Mr. Hackett's new interpretations on older songs were for the most part well done, I think what he did to the ending of &#34;Silent Sorrow&#34; was almost criminal.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I love it!!! So much fun!!!! I can't stop playing it!! So glad they created another game like cut the rope!!
0425263908|4.0|Hated Fifty Shades of Crap. It was so repetitive and awful. Bared to You has been compared to Fifty Shades of Stank and I am super glad to say that NO, they are not the same. At. All. Thank God. Sylvia has written a guilty pleasure book that's a quick, very hot and enjoyable read with two very likeable and intense characters. I understood where both of them were coming from and yes, sexually abused people have many of the mannerisms this romantic duo exhibited. I enjoyed the entire book because they characters were fully fleshed out and interacted in a way that was both immediate and realistic and also freakin' hot as hell. Lot's of chemistry between these two, both good and bad. So glad I ignored the comparisons to Fifty Shades of CaCa and read this book. I will definitely be reading the 2nd book of the series! Hooray for guilty pleasures!
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I would not recommend it but its a dictionary kind of figured  i would dislike it but this is my opinion
B0029QRA1U|1.0|I purchased the ION Profile LP Vinyl-to-MP3 Turntable for my husband as a birthday gift. He recently took it out of the box and we have listened to about 5 albums over the past month. Over the weekend, the sound started speeding up and slowing down. We tried different power outlets and it would improve, and then worsen. After reading online, this is a common problem with this player and we were advised to contact the manufacturer. They told us this is a frequent issue, however the warranty had expired so they were unwilling to do anything about it. We used this product for almost no time before it started malfunctioning. It is a poorly made product and the company is not willing to accept responsiblity. I would not purchase from this company again
B002BWP49C|5.0|Being a &#34;Twihard&#34; I had to purchase the second last movie in the series. Although I think Kristen Stewart looks so scary in this movie digitally, it's a great movie and I watch it over and over.
030759565X|5.0|this was a gift for my sister-in-law and she was thrilled, I am always pleased when I can surprise her
B005LAIHSG|4.0|I saw this movie in the theatres when it first came out. I enjoyed it and thought Charlize Theron did a great job in her character. I thought it was worth the DVD purchase as I like to watch movies over and over again and felt this may be one I would like in my library.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This was fun...actually my son spent quite a while on it he throughly enjoyed the game and it was a challanged to him
B006DHAT5K|5.0|I love the actors in this movie, it's filmed in Boston where I used to live and I actually read the book that this movie is based so of course I would love this movie. I found it to be funny and cute and just my kind of movie.
B0027MJU00|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. If you've read and enjoyed Gone Girl, I recommend Dark Places. The writing style is similar. It flips back and forth between 2 &#34;stories&#34; - present day, where the main character trying to put the pieces together and figure out who murdered her family, and 20 years ago when the murders actually occurred. The story is also told from several different perspectives. My only complaint is that (similar to other novels by Gillian Flynn) the ending is a little anti-climatic. The story is great, and it was hard for me to put the book down....but the ending is a little &#34;blah&#34;.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I had rented this movie on Netflix with low expectations. I love cartoon-type movies but the main villain had a scary nose and figured this would be a scary movie for children. However, after watching it there were cute adult humor jokes and the minions are adorable. I can't wait until the sequel comes out.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|This is a much more complicated game than any previous Birds game. One must have at least a passing knowledge of physics.  I'm not that good at math oriented stuff but I do enjoy the challenge!
B004EPZ070|4.0|This is a cute movie. I like Ginnifer Goodwin so I figured I would like this movie. I had read the books so definitely wanted to see how this movie would follow the book. It's cute even if the subject is tricky
B003O86FMW|5.0|A wonderful continuation of the story of Katniss.  She is a reluctant, believable heroine.  I could not wait until the last installment, which was not as gripping, but overall a good ending to the series.
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|I love the actors in this movie. I also thought it was creative and hilarious. I love this movie and watch it all of the time.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I am a devoted fan of the Pendergast novels, and for me, this one did not disappoint. Couldn't put it down!
B005HV6Y84|5.0|I love this soundtrack. Had lots of bands I had never heard of and found lots of fun songs to play again and again.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It's a amazing book!! I think that everyone should read it! And<br />watch the movie.<br />The books about America after another War, there's districts and every year one boy and one girl from each districts fight to the death in The Hunger Games.
B004EPZ084|5.0|I love this movie. All of the actors in this movie are hilarious. I thought the story line was very interesting and even though I am glad this isn't something people really do in reality, it was funny to watch. It did hurt my feelings when my staff used to say this was their favorite movie. What are they trying to say??
B009186E3O|5.0|Great footage and such an intimate look at the Greatest Rock and Roll band. The box set is beautifully designed.
B009FB3XTA|4.0|I bought this soundtrack because 1) I enjoy soundtracks more than any other type of music because it provides variety. 2) because I am obsessed with Twilight and have all of the other soundtracks created for this series. Although I like most of the artists on the CD and the music is good, I think this one is my least favorite. Most of the other CDs gave me some of my favorite songs and encouraged me to place the music in the various parts of the movie. In this soundtrack, I just wasn't that interested because the CD is so so. Maybe it's just me though.
B00A3ATW4M|5.0|I really love the selection of songs and really love the music. I just wish there were more of it!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|One word to describe this movie: masterpiece!!but I have to add more words to make this review possible so again this movie is a masterpiece  and if you can see it in 3d even better.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I love Lady Gaga and love almost every song on this CD. My cockatiel especially loves Edge of Glory. She dances her little heart out everytime the song is on! (Seriously!)
B0049VVE7Y|5.0|I'll talk about the show in a minute, but since this is an Amazon Instant Video purchase, I need to talk about that part first...<br /><br />This was our first Amazon Instant Video purcahse, and I will tell you I was very skeptical. I am very happy with how smoothly everything went, from activating it on the app for my Samsung TV, to the purchase online through that app.  We have good bandwith and got a great HD picture, even though the TV is connected by WiFi.  The operation of the app was simple and intuitive.<br /><br />As far as the show - If you buy this, you will end up buying season 2.  This show hooks you quickly and keeps you going.  Not having watched it until we got this at a friends suggestion, I can imagine the agony at the end of each episode based on the continual cliff-hangers at the end.  We are now fans, and yes - we bought all of season 2.
076115678X|4.0|great book and it even comes with a DVD. Helps you determine your curl pattern and gives you stop by step tutorials on how to use the Deva products.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I get it, why the author ended it the way she did. However, I hate it, the ending is awful. It's justice in a way, but not really. I've had some pretty awful relationships, one with a mega psycho, no one was murdered, but it was almost as devastating. I've moved on and found a truly amazing person whom I've been with for 3 years, and I would never go back. The ex, can live in their own personal hell, and I don't have to.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This game is an easy puzzle/hidden object. Could have been a lot more challenging and the voice acting was stilted.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Loved this movie however it is really a chic-flick. Great innocent story of a dad and his girl!  Perfect for a short trip on your kindle!

B007N8RULO|4.0|I downloaded this game just to try it out and haven't been able to put it down. It definitely keeps the mind active. Just am not fond of all the ad's.
B005S9EJ14|4.0|I laughed, I cried, then I laughed again.<br />Really good movie, enjoyable and I was able to share with my friends, as well.<br />I had rented from RedBox, and felt it deserved a spot on my shelf, where I could watch it again....and again.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is my 2 time reading the hunger games!!! I have to admit I am obsessed with it.It's an action ,drama ,romance, Science fiction, All in 1!!!!! I absolutely LOVE the  \\" The Hunger Games\\"!
B000035Z1Z|4.0|...Love Meg Ryan, too!<br />What better way to have both together!<br />Have this on VHS, figured it was time to move up to DVD.<br />Also bought it for a friend, to make her laugh while out on disability.
B009YG2ND8|4.0|The game is good but I have to say that you can get the same game for a cheaper price at gamestop for the ds version. If you don't have a ds don't get this but if you do have one get the ds version. It is a really fun game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is my addiction... i love it and can't stop playing. I have gotten all my friends to download this game
0316069434|3.0|I have followed Harry Bosch from the Black Echo debut and was anxiously waiting for the Black Box to be released. I have to say it was quite a disappointment. The hard charging, action packed and thoughtfully written novels I usually associate with Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch was just not there. I actually felt a bit sad as the character seems to have aged significantly and at one point I thought perhaps the SPOILER ALERT the backstory of his daughter wanting to be a cop was a setup for her to be the next character series and that Bosch would die in the barn at the end of this one. Harry had a heck of a run but I think Connelly is ready to put him out to pasture, I can't imagine what he could do with the character after this last book.
B00A23MYCC|5.0|It is an awesome movie, Seth McFralane was hilarious plus anything with Mark Wahlberg is good. I wish I had a Ted.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Really like how the writer is able to say things that a lot of us would like to say but are shy about it.
B009K45Y62|5.0|What can i say. its one of the best Batman movies ever and it comes in an awesome package! I have it on display in my house and everyone who comes over comments on how awesome it looks!

B007IXWL2C|5.0|Well it was  a different book that I choose to read.  Though I like how she was able to put forth some of the intimate things that humans struggle with.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|That is all that needs to be said!  AMAZING!!  As always Colleen Hoover has a winner!  She could write a instructional manual and I would read it!  BUY THIS BOOK NOW!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|again it is not a book that I would read but was a great change up to the emotional side of intimacy of the human spirit.
B002LB8U8K|3.0|TANGO & CASH, originally entitled \\"The Set-Up,\\" had more that its share of production problems, including running $20 million over budget.<br /><br />A star dropped out early on and his role had to to be recast. Russian-born theater and film director Andrey Konchalovskiy was replaced by Albert Magnoli very near completion because of artistic differences with producer Jon Peters. Andrey, who previously directed [[ASIN:0792838424 RUNAWAY TRAIN]] (1985), [[ASIN:6301966708 DUET FOR ONE [VHS]]] (1986) and [[ASIN:6301071395 SHY PEOPLE [VHS]]] (1987), wanted a \\"dark\\" film.<br /><br />Director of photography Barry Sonnenfeld got sacked for not lighting Sly Stallone to the actor's satisfaction. Stuart Baird was called on for re-cuts when Warner's was displeased with the finished movie. For all these adjustments, \\"Tango & Cash\\" is still a buddy cop comedy of only middling quality.<br /><br />Here, Stallone's sophisticated Raymond Tango competes with grungy Gabriel Cash (Russell) for drug busts and news copy. Baddie Palance (in his best \\"Believe It Or Not\\" persona) finds a way to get both cops thrown into the jail from perdition, but not before Kurt goes \\"drag,\\" and Sly frets neurotically over falling stock values and some rising heat between his sister (Hatcher) and Lt. Cash. Pollard is the nerd who supplies T&C with an armed-to-the-roof tank-skinned monster SUV.<br /><br />Some tepid humor arises from Tango's confusion over Cash's sexuality and with their running gag of macho \\"I'm a better cop than you\\" banter.<br /><br />Originally slated for Kurt Russell's role, Patrick Swayze got his chance to wear high heels in [[ASIN:B0000714BP TO WONG FOO THANKS FOR EVERYTHING, JULIE NEWMAR]] (1995). Patti Davis, Ron and Nancy Reagan's daughter, cameos here as a reporter. Ron Howard's kid brother Clint plays an obnoxious cellmate who quickly gets squelched.<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(6.1) Tango & Cash (1989) - Sylvester Stallone/Kurt Russell/Teri Hatcher/Jack Palance/Brion James/James Hong/Michael J.

B008ILRW0E|4.0|HOW TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE was the first-ever Cinemascope/stereo sound comedy, and the first such extravaganza on broadcast TV. In 1961, \\"Milionaire\\" was the premiere film on NBC's brand new \\"Saturday Night at the Movies\\" series.<br /><br />In this amalgam of two Broadway shows, \\"[[ASIN:B000R9COGM The Greeks Had a Word For Them]]\\" and \\"Loco,\\" the trio of Bacall, Grable and Monroe portray golddigging gals who aggressively target wealthy men. At the end, they all wed guys as poor as they are, or so it seems.<br /><br />It's frothy '50s stuff that's hampered at times by the censorship of that era. Example: Monroe must say \\"Men aren't attentive to girls who wear glasses\\" instead of \\"don't make passes at.\\" There's still room for some zingers, such as Bacall's old age barb aimed right at husband Humphrey Bogart: \\"Look at Roosevelt, look at Churchill, look at old fella whats-his-name in [[ASIN:B002TOL4QO THE AFRICAN QUEEN]].<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(6.9) How to Marry a Millionaire (1953) - Lauren Bacall/Betty Grable/Marilyn Monroe/David Wayne/Rory Calhoun/Cameron Mitchell/Fred Clark/Wiliam Powell (uncredited: Merry Anders/Percy Helton/Philip Van Zandt)

B003H06SEC|5.0|Director Martin Scorsese's CASINO is a superb crime drama that concerns successful football handicapper Ace Rothstein (DeNiro). Ace is put in charge of a Vegas gambling resort by the syndicate that owns it. He makes the mistake of marrying a hustler (Stone) and trusting her. To feed her drug habit she hustles him for a bundle of cash and jewelry, then splits. Ace's best friend (Pesci) is a psychotic mob leg-breaker who goes too far, too often.<br /><br />The film is adapted by Nicholas Pileggi from his own book. Pileggi also wrote the book and screenplay for [[ASIN:B000P0J09M GOODFELLAS]] (1990) and [[ASIN:B00000JGHL CITY HALL]] (1996).<br /><br />CASINO's main character is loosely based on Chicago-born sports handicapper Frank 'Lefty' Rosenthal, a frequenter of Miami racetracks. With Florida authorities breathing down his neck for bookmaking activities, Lefty relocated to Las Vegas in 1968. In '76, it was discovered that Rosenthal was running four Vegas casinos without a license. He was consequently denied one due to organized crime &aacute;ssociations. In Nov. '82, Lefty's drug-addicted ex-wife O.D.ed on booze, Valium and coke in a motel room. A month before this, he was almost killed in a car bombing.<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(8.2) Casino (USA/France-1995) - Robert DeNiro/Sharon Stone/Joe Pesci/James Woods/Frank Vincent/Kevin Pollak/Don Rickles/Alan King/Dick Smothers/Steve Allen/Jayne Meadows/Frankie Avalon/Jerry Vale

B0098TNDZI|5.0|For the sixth and final film of his legendary boxing series, writer/director Sly Stallone brings back characters only seen some 30 years earlier.<br /><br />Spider Rico (Lovell), the opponent defeated by Rocky Balboa at the start of the first story, is now punch drunk and a recipient of the ex-champ's affectionate protection. Little Marie (Hughes), the teen who insulted Rocky when he suggested she clean up her act, is this final picture's leading lady. Sly's kid brother Frank, who had singing cameos in the first three movies, appears briefly in a restaurant scene.<br /><br />Archive footage vividly depicts several ghosts from Rocky's past: his beloved wife Adrian, manager and best friend Mickey Goldmill, and ring opponents Ivan Drago and Clubber Lang. Conspicuously missing is Apollo Creed, although Rock reminisces about their epic first bout.<br /><br />SYNOPSIS--<br />In this emotionally moving last chapter, Adrian's dead, Rocky lives only for the past. At 55, he has bouts of melancholy over her loss. Paulie (Young), Spider Rico (Lovell) and trainer Tony (Burton) are all that remain of the old days. Even the ice rink where Adrian and Rocky had their first date is rubble.<br /><br />A computer simulation of Rocky fighting current champ Mason 'the Line' Dixon (light heavyweight champ Tarver) revives interest in the old slugger. Somehow, undefeated Dixon convinces Rocky to meet him in Las Vegas for an exhibition match. In doing so, Rocky is able to put to rest forever all the old memories that have been troubling him.<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(7.2) Rocky Balboa (2006) - Sylvester Stallone/Burt Young/Antonio Tarver/Geraldine Hughes/Milo Ventimiglia/Tony Burton/Mike Tyson/Pedro Lovell/Jim Lampley.Larry Merchant/Max Kellerman/LeRoy Neiman/Bert Sugar/Frank Stallone
B004UB9SKS|5.0|well worth the money but only provides basic translations - and none really specifically suited to a particular culture/ country.  $10 for multi-language support it was worth it.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Very good movie!  The story and drama of the relationship between Amy and of course Clint!  I want to watch it again.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved it! It is one of the few books that actually had a very good theme and an original plot. I highly recommed it
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Love it.......Tons of fun....I can play this game for hours and hours....I have even got my husband involved...and he luvs it 2....
B007RRFUHM|4.0|I am always in search of amazing female artists. Right now Kimbra is one of a few at the top of my playlist. I wish I had discovered \\"Vows\\" sooner. Kimbra's vocals are versatile, emotional, and spot on! I always love when it when I can listen to a CD and all the songs sound different. She's not stuck in a genre rut. The influences of various styles of music are evident. I can hear everything from pop, jazz, alternative, and soul. I'm also very impressed with the fact that Kimbra writes and co-produces a majority of her tracks. I would love to see more of artists like Kimbra in mainstream media. She's a solid, non-hoochie artist. I'm a new fan.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|A great love story with no lack of twists and turns to keep you guessing.  Such a fast read that I almost want to read it again!  Relax and enjoy this great book...
B000FCKC4C|4.0|I enjoyed this book quite a bit, even if I didn't always understand the exact meaning that the author was trying to convey. It read very fast.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I know I am behind the trend of reading this series but now that I have started I am hooked.  Love that I can instantly get the book when I am ready for it.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Growing up a hardcore tomboy, I was the little girl that defied the sterotype and honestly never did dream of being a princess. If Brave had come out when I was kid though...it would have been a different story.<br /><br />Great story. Awesome characters. The most fantastically wild red hair *ever*! A refreshing dose of realizm about what being a princess was really like. A happy ending *without* a Prince Charming. Loved the value of family that was emphasised - in the midst of laughing at how rediculous and complicated family can be.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|This book kept me on the edge until the very end - and then I was completely surprised - usually I am able to figure things out, but not this time.  Keep them coming David Baldacci!!
B0098VYCCE|3.0|Cool idea. Pretty good story. Of the three main characters - snow white, the queen, and the huntsman, snow white was the only character that never got developed. You rooted for her, but you were never really sure who she was.

B000KRNCYY|5.0|I really appreciate A New Journey from Celtic Woman, for whatever reason it always encourages me into a time of self-reflection, whether originally intended, or not.  The music is relaxing and is part of my home therapy to help lower my stress levels.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|The second book develops the character of each element giving better understanding....one sees where the characters thoughts, needs and habits come from along with better character development.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I really appreciate this music genre from Celtic Woman.  When I need a moment or three for meditation and self-reflection, I always turn to Celtic Woman or Yanni's Dare to Dream or Native American flutes.  Celtic Woman is relaxing and is part of my audio therapy to help lower my stress levels for natural blood pressure control.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The whole set spells out the dreams and fantacies of lovers...real or percieved.  It opens the mind of male and female to thoughts and subjects often difficult to consider let alone act on....
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I couldn't put it down. Now, just sad that it is over! There is a renewed faith that comes from reading this...in both myself as a mom and in moms everywhere. If you have ever doubted yourself, take an afternoon to regain your strength between the pages of this book.

B00AJRQLTI|4.0|It is very good, I like the music. My only little tiny complaint is that the sound quality is not very strong. I turn it up all the way and it's still kind of low. Otherwise, it's wonderful!!! I loved the Movie and the music.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Love is wanting to tolerate the pain it causes<br /><br />Eleven more words required<br />Seven more words required<br />Three more words
B005OCFGTO|5.0|GREAT FOR THE MONEY!!!!!!! LOVE HARRY POTTER!!!! I couldn't believe I got all of the movies for this price and it is in a nice size box so that it doesn't take up to much room on my shelves.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|I had heard this movie was hilarious. I finally had to rent it. I was not disappointed. Ted sounds exactly like Peter Griffin (who I also find funny) and there are some perv moments and overall pretty darn good.
0810983915|5.0|My daughter hates to read, but she LOVES the Wimpy kid books. It's the only thing she enjoys. Great book for young readers.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This is a modern story about two young people that meet in Vegas. The book has many trials for the newlywed strangers to face as they get to know one another. It is an easy read that will capture your attention
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|As always awesome!! Don't see the movie as Tom Cruise is an absurd choice for Jack Reacher!!<br />Hugh Jackman<br />Better!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great story! Hope they make the 2nd and 3rd sequels of it. Not just for teens. The writing was descriptive and not long winded.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is the first book of his I have read and I tell you I will continue to read all if his books. This book had shown me a lot about a lot of things (I don't want to spoil it) but this story made it seem like I was the character. This is a must read.
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|The drawing pad is pretty cool! I love all the different backgrouds you can choose and the \\"stickers\\" are my 4 year olds favorite part!I wish it had a lock feature so that she couldn't exit the program. But other than that I am happy with it and will keep it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is the easiest way to keep up with the random information in your life. I need to know my air filter size I enter it on the comp and it follows me to the store. If I could master shareable lists shopping lists and wish lists would be a snap to share and easy to update!

B008602KQI|5.0|the hunger games is the number one movie of 2012. jennifer lawerence has out done herself this time, but i don't believe this movie is so much about the cast as the script. Of course the book is more figuretive and (I found) more captivating, still the sets were breathtakingly realistic! A 5 star rating goes out to all! i love love love!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Another realistic novel,stories within stories. Another Clancy classic with many twists & turns and keeps you hooked to the very last page. Keep them coming.
0765356139|4.0|What's left to tell after the villain is defeated, and the prince and the heroine are reunited? Plenty, as it turns out. This book has a very different tone from the first volume, which should come as no surprise. It is the second act of a three-act story, so it is naturally a bit darker than the caper at the heart of the first book.<br /><br />If you go into the book with that expectation in mind, I think you will enjoy it. But if you go in looking for more of the same as in the first volume, you may be disappointed,as several reviewers were. I enjoyed the ride, and I'll climb aboard for the third act of this fascinating fantasy trilogy.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is very easy to read; the narration style is very close to how one would actually speak.<br /><br />The story had me so close to tears at so many different points that I felt like Charlie. I absolutely adored him as a character and could relate to him easily.<br /><br />Parts of this book will stick with you long after you read it. I highly recommend it to anyone who writes, and especially anyone who classifies themselves as a wallflower. :)

B009UX2YAC|5.0|The family likes to compete with each other.  The app isn't sluggish and the graphics are fun.  A family fun game.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|This is the most disgusting and vulgar movie I've seen yet....I was truly disappointed ...never thought I would see Mark Wahlberg in such a low class movie as this....so sad....
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book. The ending was great. It's definitely a tear jerk er. Nicholas Sparks is great. We out.
B004V5QWU2|3.0|I have a glitch in the sounds. It's a slight hesitation that I start listening for and that, obviously defeats the purpose of falling asleep.
B0083SBMBM|4.0|I am very happy with the purchase of my movie for my son He have watch the movie over and over again.I would purchase any other movie he want
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This book is excellent.  i had a hard time putting it down.  It was written so that you thought you were there with him.  You could see everything just like you were there.  A excellent read.
B001O1O71C|5.0|It was really good and very descriptive but it got really sad closer to the end but still a good book
B008R9QAY6|5.0|Well worth adding to your collection if you enjoy lively baroque opera with opulent, lavish orchestration and superb singing by a truly outstanding cast.  Definitely a sumptuous feast for the ears.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Made me laugh out loud and evoked emotion that was real. Such a great story. Many great quotes for life.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love the game don't get me wrong but there is a setting where you aboslutly know you are gjoing to win and it makes the game no fun because then you don't want to try as hard cause you already know you are going to win.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I wanted to read this book because of the movie. I know it sounds pretty stupid, but the movie was great. So, when I read this book it gave me a totally different outlook on life. The book was so well written. I could feel every emotion. The characters had a depth to them they were more than just people in a book,they were different stories combined to share the story of Charlie's life. I highly recommend this book to anyone. It reaches out to everyone who reads it. I was, and still am, hooked on to this book. This is definitely my new favorite book,but then again,I am just like Charlie. I know for sure though, that I will NEVER forget this book.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love playing the game! Now it's available on my mobile device. Was easy enough to load to my mobile device.

B0053JJLLC|4.0|I believe good authors should not be allowed to die.  It seems that Michael is trying to break the death barrier, this is book can be said to be mostly Crichton.  Fast paced and twists everywhere.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|It is easy and fun to play.  I caught very quickly which doesn't happen often.  Pudding monsters is the bomb!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This story provides mental exercise for the reader. It is a clever story of human motives and self-justification - a modern morality tale.
B009POHHRG|5.0|This was a really good read. Not your standard Batman story. Dark and pretty violent. Do yourself a favor and read it.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|Beautiful scenery in a few parts, great special effects (but frankly CGI is getting pretty boring), but my enjoyment of the movie was greatly lessened by a weak and incoherent story and sloppy details like scientists immediately jumping off their space ship onto a new planet without taking the necessary precautions to ensure they don't cause contamination or put themselves in danger. In this movie &#34;Scott&#34; doesn't rhyme with plot.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|this book was hard to put down and very surprising in the end.  i had this book read in on a few short days
B000HBK3MM|5.0|Her voice is gifted and every song on this CD is great.  It was truly a great addition to my collection.  I had purchased Adele previosly and listen to her CD too, but not as much as I listen to this one!  GREAT BUY
B0028RXXFC|5.0|It was just what I expected and the delievery service was fast & accurate. Would definitely reccomend this purchase. Thanks
B002KVE1LQ|3.0|A good album, I have it on vinyl,but not the best Stones album but better than many of them. I bought it because I wanted it in digital format and Amazon had marked the price way down for the MP3 download. Get it, but get it when it is marked way down.
1400049628|5.0|I cannot tell you how much I love this book! Very fascinating and a little humorous! 4/5 of this book are filled with survival tips and guides to finding the perfect gear for the job at hand! This is definitely in my survival kit I am making! Recommend this ten times over! YOU WILL LOVE IT!
B009VSW15Y|4.0|This app makes use of the on-board camera on Kindle Fire HD by allowing you to take pictures and video, but the images are very low quality.  If it was the app making the pics grainy, I would have rated it only 1 star, but since the camera that was only really intended to be used for Skype, I have to assume the low quality is more a function of the camera and not the app.  But this is a good app for making use of the camera in other ways.<br /><br />Finding the images is a little confusing because the app doesn't link directly back to the images to let you delete/edit them.  When the images are captured they are dumped into the images and video storage on the Kindle.  You have to go into those storage locations to find/edit/delete photos and videos.
B0011UBDTK|1.0|I purchased this, set, thinking it was a good deal... Over half of the disks do not work in my brand new iMac or my laptop.  I now see other people have had this problem... you are better off getting the individual seasons if you are purchasing this to watch the show... yes the fuzzy cover is nice and it is compact, but if you want to watch the shows don't buy this.  Also the disks are stored in cardboard in the book... the pages looked worn when I got the product, like the disks had been rubbing against the images.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|I downloaded this game as a Free App of the Day, because I've always liked bubble popper games and I figured it was worth a try. However, despite the name \\"Bubbles Touch\\", it's not really like bubbles touching... It's more like stone balls EXPLODING in your face. Which isn't a bad thing; it's definitely a good thing! I just can't understand why the developers are selling it as a classic bubble popper when it's so much more. The mechanics are like a bubble popper, sure, and the object is to clear the screen. However, the balls roll and clink together more like solid stone balls than bubbles (which is awesome) and they don't pop, so much as they literally explode (which is even awesomer). The bonuses don't come from exploding the balls that hold the bonuses... they come from exploding the ball chains ABOVE the bonus balls, so they will fall down (intact!) into your reservoir. Took me a few levels to really catch on to the way that plays out, but I find it much more challenging and a great addition to this game! So I nabbed this game, figuring it would be a typical bubble popping game - and got something far more interesting! Definitely worth the $1 price the game usually goes for.
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|For all you Fuji camera owners where xd is required, this is the way to go! I searched all over my local area for it.
B004V5A7K8|5.0|I got this app when it was a freebie for the day, which is a good thing, because I might've missed out on it if I hadn't! Block breaking games aren't really something I seek out, but this one has totally won me over. It's a great app, with wonderful graphics, sounds and responsiveness. I love how the \\"blocks\\" are less like blocks and more like square bubbles. They make such a nice \\"pop!\\" sound when the ball hits them. It's so much more fun than the sounds games like this usually have. Also, the colors and backgrounds in this game are so varied, it's like a rainbow in every level! The ball even changes color to match whatever block it last busted. It's all the little details like that that make this game so delightful! I think it's definitely worth the $1 price tag. This game is totally a keeper.
B008XDSUNU|5.0|I love my XM Radio because it always brings me something different - including Wild Nothing. I listened to a few samples and decided it was well worth the $8.99. Its soothing, interesting music. Love it and would recommend giving Wild Nothing a try!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I've always enjoyed the coin drop/push games at the arcade, but I didn't really think it would translate well to a tablet experience. Then I saw the reviews this app was getting and figured I'd give it a try. I mean, it's free - so no harm done if I don't like it, right?<br /><br />When I dropped the first few coins, I was already thinking I would uninstall it. Well, uninstall it after, you know, I drop a few more coins. Then maybe after I get that teddy bear there to fall. Oh, wait. I got some kind of coin shower. Man, look at that stuff move. Well, I gotta drop a few more now. Sweet! I got a car. Bonus coins! An umbrella! GIANT COINS! Woo! Okay, right. I was gonna uninstall, wasn't I? Oh, yeah. Right after I drop a few more- WHAT DO YOU MEAN I'M OUT OF COINS? Well, I'll just wait a few seconds and get one more, just to see what happens. I know I can win some more...<br /><br />Okay, yeah. So I'm not uninstalling at all. I'm hooked. Just like everybody else said.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|my grandson loves this game! he cannot wait to get home from school to play it! I have never seen him this excited.
0345802934|5.0|One of the masterpieces of modern literature. Murakami is an incredible storyteller, and his character descriptions bring even the secondary characters to life. Exceptional translation from the Japanese as well.
B0085Z8F4A|3.0|THERE ARE NO SPOILERS WITHIN!<br /><br />I liked \\"Prometheus\\" a lot, but there are just a couple of really important things I found wrong with it.  I found I wanted to give it two scores, which of course is not possible under the auspices of  Amazon.  I decided, therefore, to treat the film as if it were allowed to get those scores, then average them.  Hence, the three points.<br /><br />THE GOOD:<br /><br />It is stunning from the opening shot: a sweeping, panoramic vista lies ahead, one in which nature is seen in its forbidding glory.  It is the Earth in its formative days, and as the camera swooshes along, the viewer soon finds himself at the top of a waterfall where a Prometheus, indeed, stands in all his glory: a huge, silvery proto-man who drinks a liquid under the shadowy form of an nearby spacecraft.  It can only be his species' ship, and we watch the liquid take effect his body granulates, crumbling into the water and washing over the falls, apparently on its way to seed the planet with his DNA.<br /><br />Several million years later we find ourselves in the near future, and we are now part of an archeological team that has made an apparently stunning discovery in Scotland.  It is one more piece of a puzzle they have assembled, culminating in a plan to discover our birthplace in the stars.<br /><br />It's a glorious and stirring opening, very much like Spielberg might have done it.  It is done with little dialogue, little formal exposition, but the objective is clear to all (though at the end of the movie there may be more questions than answers). It's an excellent start worthy of a promising movie concept.<br /><br />This kind of epic, iconic storytelling is director/producer Ridley Scott's forte, and it is one for which so many have been on tenterhooks: the prequel to the equally iconic [[ASIN:B004RE29T0 Alien [Blu-ray]]] made in 1979.  It's a daunting task, as over thirty years have passed since the original.  Pleasing everyone will be an impossibility.  But does he come close?<br /><br />\\"Prometheus\\" is lush and breathtaking throughout.  Whether you are traveling along with them in their spaceship, or on the planet where the clues to our ancestors may rest, the movie is beautifully rendered and/or photographed.  The setting, therefore, is one of the GOOD points.<br /><br />I can say the same thing about the special effects, which are awesome without being overpowering...I really dislike movies whose makers have decided that good CGI is abundant CGI, and therefore every shot has thousands of soldiers or ridiculously sized monsters or packed cityscapes full of so many clever gimmicks and gadgets that the scene is impossible to comprehend.<br /><br />Thankfully, Ridley gives us sumptuous shots and amazing FX without these drawbacks, and the ultimate effect is positive: grand planetary vistas, frighteningly forbidding chambers, and monsters that can hide in a drop of black fluid.  Again, done very well.<br /><br />So...the beauty, pageantry, and special effects win \\"Prometheus\\" a 5.<br /><br />And then we get to the story.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br /><br />It's not so much the WHOLE story...just parts of it.<br /><br />I get it that this crew has been selected to travel across the universe.  I get it that a millionaire--hell, billionaire--is funding this expedition, and he's not only hand-picked the crew, but also hired one kickass captain to command the mission.<br /><br />BUT: If these are the very best scientists in their field, there is a pretty sad dearth of scientists around.  First of all, the team has no PLAN.  They never work on a way to approach the site.  They land and immediately rush out of the ship.  When they find a site where interesting specimens might be there is never any caution...they simply go right after it.  And not only do two of them miss their transport back to the ship right before a hellacious storm, but they find REAL LIVING ALIEN BEINGS and get all gootchy-gooey with them...saying, \\"Come on, little feller.  Come on...ooh, you're so cute. Come on over here...\\"<br /><br />AND YOU'D NEVER GUESS WHAT HAPPENS.<br /><br />Honestly, this REALLY detracted from the movie.  It was so beyond STUPID, even IMBECILIC, that I felt as if the movie were insulting me.  And a lot of the later behavior seemed similarly ridiculous.<br /><br />This bothered me for more than the obvious reason...I felt that it really hurt a good movie.  I know there are a lot of people who feel the movie was faulted because it didn't answer all their questions about \\"Alien,\\" but that didn't bother me.  (I'd heard that there was one more film coming, PLUS the film itself pretty much says so.)  And as to the other main complaint of many fans: I simply don't hate films that leave me with questions.  Why can't they?  Isn't life like that?<br /><br />But those DAMN scientists, and the whole crappy team of idiots on that ship...they really did, and still do bother me.  It spoke to such a lack of credibility.<br /><br />That aside, I really loved how beautiful \\"Prometheus\\" looked, and I loved the overarching story.  In fact, in almost ALL other ways, I loved the movie.  So a 1 for the plot line, and a 5 for the technical beauty of the movie.<br /><br />Make up your mind: if you want to see a really beautiful, gorgeous movie that ALMOST answers your questions about [[ASIN:B004RE29T0 Alien [Blu-ray]]] rent (or buy) \\"Prometheus.\\" But when those damned scientists get to work, close your eyes..., little feller.

B001M0HGR2|4.0|I ordered the download in HD. Unfortunately we were never able to see the movie due to the constant stopping and restarting for the movie download. It was certainly a waste of money and a very frustrating experience. I think in a case like this the 24 hour rental is an issue. It was my first movie purchase from Amazon and I do not think I will be doing any more. First time I have ever been disappointed with Amazon.<br /><br />UPDATE, Amazon gave me a refund on this and sent me instructions on improving the performance on the viewing device. Thanks Amazon!!!
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|I've used these A-T powered lav mics for years. I've owned (and still own) VHF and UHF wireless mics, but a wired mic with a little bit of bias (the battery power) never has interference problems at the IT conferences where I do most of my interviews, while all wireless rigs except the most expensive UHF ones pick up static or popping sooner or later.<br /><br />SO:<br /><br />My basic \\"interview rig\\" is a venerable Panasonic hand-held HDC-TM300 camcorder that has the same lens and video processing circuitry as some of their larger prosumer cams, plus a cheap (light weight) tripod and two of these little A-T lav mics.<br /><br />Why two? One for me, one for my interview victim.... err... subject. I use a cheap (from B&H) one X stereo male, two X mono female \\"Y\\" adapter at my camcorder mic input so I have one voice on each channel that I can mix/balance in post using Sony Vegas -- or, really, any video editing software.<br /><br />Simple. Trouble-free. Good sound. I do interviews with techies, for techies, so nobody cares if they see a mic and wire. I used to run them inside shirts. Now I rarely do. Why bother? :)<br /><br />Batteries? Put fresh ones in every month. That's overkill, but easy to remember with help from Google calendar or iCal or whatever. If you're real paranoid, a new battery for every recording session. Batteries are cheap.<br /><br />Get spare foam windscreens. They *will* fall off and get lost. Ditto lapel clips. They're cheap. A couple of these vital parts and a battery or two in your shoulder bag or whatever you use to carry your video stuff can be life savers.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is probably John Grisham's finest work. Looks like he finally listened to his fans and worked on better endings. I had stopped reading Grisham on account of his crappy endings. I decided to give him another chance with his newest book, and I'm happy to report that I was pleasantly surprised. It's a great book; like I said, his best work yet.
B0086700CM|4.0|I love it but it freezes a little on the kindle fire if you play it for like fifteen rounds but other than that I love it!
B003CH9PTU|5.0|It keeps you on the edge of your seat from the first show.  It's also has a sense of humor considering all the bad things that are happening.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I have played many Mahjong games but this one is riveting. I love the vibrant colors and the different configurations.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Really like the graphics and game play. Heard about it on other platforms but only played it on android. Fun fun fun.
B005HSL626|4.0|It is very user-friendly, easy to play and scores are simple to understand by little people!  My two grandsons, ages 4 and 6, absolutely love it! Furthermore, the game is educational in that it promotes visual attention and eye-hand coordinaton as well as math skills by keeping score.
1451695195|4.0|Definitely got me thinking but yes, a lot of medical terminology that a normal person would not understand.  great reading though.
B004RJMUJO|1.0|I bought this to see if it was different from the free version but it was exactly the same. Waste of my time
B001JIFYSA|3.0|Not as great as previous reviews make it out to be - some stories were weaker than others but still a fun rental to watch with significant other
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|\\" I'm not going to wish for a perfect life. The things that knock you down in life are tests, forcing you to make a choice between giving in and remaining on the ground or wiping the dirt off and standing up even taller than you did before you were knocked down. I'm choosing to stand up taller. I'll probably get knocked down a few more times before this life is through with me, but I can guarantee you I'll never stay on the ground. \\"<br /><br />This book is stop well written, doesn't miss a beat, no cliffhangers Absolutely fell in love with HOPELESS!! And Hope & Sky & Holder & Les. Everyone needs a selfless person like Karen in their lives, someone to be strong and see what others can't.<br /><br />Sky is the limit!!!<br /><br />College Hoover, you are # 1 for a reason.<br />Thank you Nicole Williams for gifting me this book.
B009G78EE2|5.0|I love Macklemore and this is just amazing! I love his new album and I hope he keeps coming out with more, great songs that make sense, not just random singing, it actually has meaning behind the music.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I was immediately sucked into this book. The writing is incredible, detailed and imaginative. The story takes many twists and turns, through emotions you almost didn't know you had (if you're not psycho). The ending was shocking and almost anti-climactic but perfectly fitting. Gillian Flynn has, yet again, done a wonderful job.
0307744434|4.0|A very written novel with a dynamic timeline. The plot is complex with unique twists and details. I didn't want the book to end and my only dissapointment was that it didnt continue on longer. Readers should be ready to grasp intangible ideas and allow their minds to draw the details for you. Fully recommend this book.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Last minute gift that arrived with a few other gifts that I had ordered through Amazon. Great movie for the whole family!
B00ADS90EQ|5.0|Loved this movie! It was funny, had amazing singing. I will watch this again and again. Five stars for sure!
B001GMH8RO|5.0|Movie is as good as I remember and the picture is even better in blu-ray! Worth the price!! Buy it.
B00571F26Y|5.0|The book was very informative, and losing the weight (after wheat), is WORKING!  13 months ago I just knocked off the toast, sandwiches, and rolls at dinner, and I've lost 23#.  And my arthristis doesn't bother me anymore.  My trigicirites and cholestrol has gone down emormasly.  The book was as the seller said.  Brand new.  It will be passed around from friend to friend now.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|It was a nice easy read. Enjoyable and exciting waiting fir both to realize they were in love with each other.
B007P6VM04|5.0|Love the music!  I ordered it because I love the TV show and knew I wanted to hear the music.
B003WWZ1R0|4.0|Great selection, varied and interesting but not so much so as to be jarring.  Nice for meditating at the end of a long day.
B009LK6JS2|4.0|This is a fun, challenging game that provides multiple variations (3 different aircraft and various runway types) to keep you engaged.  The only down-side to this game is the user interface on my Kindle Fire HD.  It could be a software glitch with either the Kindle or the game, but I often have issues with the game orientation being upside down.  The other interface issue is the location of the flaps control when trying to land.  With the Kindle Fire HD there's a pull menu on the right side of the screen which interferes with the control for the flaps.  The software engineers for this game should consider moving the controls so they play well with all tablets.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|If you need hope for a troubled marriage or just want to laugh outloud, you must see this film!  Meryl Streep at her best.  I highly recommend it for everyone.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Enjoyed it . Kept me on the edge of my seat every time I picked it up and read it.
B001VW9SH2|5.0|Even if you are not a fan of this band (how could you not be) I think you would enjoy this track. The words are a tad disturbing but the melody takes you to another place, mesmerising.
B008J2GAKU|5.0|Scott wrote Batman like he created him. Top notch and Greg`s art made it all come alive. Haven't been this excited about comic books in years. A+
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Really fun to play with good graphics , was really surprised it was free. I would recommend it to any pony fan!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|What can I say that hasn't been said?  Get the game, it is a lot of fun and well done.
1400069289|3.0|If you know nothing about the science of habit forming (which you might learn from a marketing class or a psychology class or addiction recovery) then this book is a good introduction.  If you already know that a habit is a learned response to a cue or trigger that reliably produces a reward then you probably won't get much out of this book but a few fun (and well-told) anecdotes.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I picked up this ebook at the recommendation of a friend... and I have to say I'm blown away. The writing style of Ms. Hoover is addicting, as a reader I felt drawn into the character of Sky. Yes - the subject matter is horrific, but the author's writing gripped me from the first page. I couldn't put this book down. With the best firsts of any romance and twists and turns, the reader is left with wanting more. Ms. Hoover is extremely talented and I can't wait to read more of her books.<br /><br />--Melissa Huie, Author of The Broken Road Series.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is a must read for people that are diary of a wimpy kid fans! Must buy this book!
B003XVYLDU|5.0|Classic of Memory, desire and coping with the unimaginable. Zzz zzzz zzzz zz zz zz zz zz zz zz zz
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love it! Its a great time filler when waiting somewhere or for someone. I love their other games too.
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|I actually like this movie because of the point it makes. There are lots of kids movies that are made for our kids that's total mindless, meaningless babble and this isn't one of them. It actually teaches kids something that they can take with them throughout their lives...
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|I bought this for my nephew's 11th birthday and it was a hit.  It's not as easy as it may look, and if there is a cheat sheet out there for how to build the pictures, I would love to have it!
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|The app does allow viewing of pdf files.  However, it would be more helpful if it were bundled with an Adobe flash player app.
B004CURZFC|5.0|Beautiful visuals, very personable characters, dramatic action, a bit of light comedy at just the right proportion and heroism!<br /><br />I watched on line before the actual DVD arrives, and hope there are extras because that's the only way I would have enjoyed this movie more.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I have watched this movie three times and had to buy it to have it in my collection.  The acting is fabulous and the story line uplifting.
B002RI97IY|5.0|this book gave me a different outlook on everything in my life. it would be amazing if we could all think like this
B0011UJMK2|4.0|Great portrayal of the horror and terror of Stalin<br />And the all knowing State. The joint growth of honesty<br />And love between Leo and Raisa was a great subtext.
B0063IH60K|4.0|it does what it says.....no bells and whistles........easy to play ..... good free game.....everyone. should. get this app why not its free
B009X00E18|4.0|The Marware Lightweight cover for the 8.9\\" Fire is a decent product for light wear and tear. Just as the name says though this is lightweight so don't think you can just toss it down the stairs with the case on.  For basic body and screen protection it is just fine.  The Fire just clicks right in.<br /><br />You can fold the cover back to set your device up and it is fairly stable.  It is sleek black and looks good and there is an elastic band you can use to help hold it closed.<br /><br />Overall I'd recommend it.  It's sleek and does it's job and doesn't add a lot of bulk or weight to your device.  If you want super tough though you'd need to look elsewhere but this is as advertised.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|These guys are a must have if you like groups like Civil Twilight, Ashes Divide, Sick Puppies, and my first love of alternative rock, 30 Seconds to Mars.  Demons is AMAZING!
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|This was one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  While the explicit, graphic drug use might make it unsuitable for some viewers, those who can get past that should be in for some out loud laughs and lots of them.  Much of the humor is way over the top and outrageous, but if you appreciate Seth Macfarlane's humor in &#34;Family Guy,&#34; you will get it.  While I appreciate that animated series, I don't watch it regularly.  This movie may get me to begin doing so.<br />The acting is surprisingly high quality and the story holds together well.  Patrick Stewart as the narrator makes the movie have an almost Monty Python air of high British satire.
B00005RHGK|5.0|This I received in the mail, unharmed and in great condition.  It arrived promptly ..I have yet to watch it as it was a gift for my boyfriend but all in all I loved the fact I could get it for him!
B007K3UVNQ|5.0|For Christmas I was given a handful of gift cards to Amazon, and wanted some 'new' music so began to surf the site following the &#34;customers who also bought&#34; links, and came across Overkill.  This album is my first of theirs, and will not be their last - it is phenomenal.  I'd attempt to describe their sound, but I would fail, it is definitely metal, but with a hint of a kind of classic hard rock vocal styling - good stuff.  If you haven't yet checked out this bad (and this album) - Do so now.
B008JGSM6G|1.0|This ap doesnt have the dots but expects you to connect the dots, how exactly are you supposed to do that??
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This game keeps your mind sharp. The only drawback is the colors on the tiles but other than that it is a fun game to play because you do not have to rely on others to play.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I really enjoy this item.  I find it both relaxing and addictive.  There are now several other family members who are hooked on it also.
B006N9KFPC|5.0|This is the most amazing album I have ever purchased. Adam Lambert is a genius!!! All of his songs have such very deep meanings and his vocals are out of this world!!!! I would recommend that everyone run, don't walk, to order this amazing album. The deluxe version is simply the best !! The three bonus tracks are well worth the extra money. Running, Take Back and Nirvanna are the icing on the cake of the most delicious album you would ever want to own!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004LWZWGA|5.0|I liked this Batman movie a lot  the acting was amazing and the plot was solid even if they did completely change Bane as in the comics he is a Mexican wrestler that uses a serum to become super strong.
B008G12ERC|3.0|It's 2.5 stars!<br /><br />First of all, I am a HUGE Muse fan, seen them three times live and will see them everytime they come to SoCal.  I have all their albums and live cd's and a few rare tracks too, and they are in heavy rotation on the ipod.  My 7-year old can pick out a Muse song in 5 seconds, because he's heard them so much.  When The Resistance came out, it took a little while to grow on me, so I'm not giving up on The 2nd Law yet, however I have listened to it a few times so far and am a little disappointed.  Where's my guitar-shredding rock, that stuff that makes you pogo and head bang?  Don't get me wrong, I love the orchestral and even some electronic elements they always pepper in, but Muse is a ROCK band at heart.  Aren't they?<br /><br />Maybe this album takes some time to digest, which has been the case with most of their music for me.  Even the early stuff, I liked it at first but the love grew over time.  Maybe this one will too.  But for now, my opinion is that it's (gasp!) good but not great.<br /><br />By the way if you have never heard MUSE, I reccomend you start with-<br />Origin of Symetry- if you just love to rock;<br />Black Holes and Revelations- if you're anti;<br />Absolution- if you're an optimist.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Awesome game. Couldn't put it down. The different levels are fun to figure out and when you are stuck, the developers give you tips/hints on FB.
B006JD48NM|5.0|I consider myself somewhat of a driving purist, this documentary has Senna's insane driving abilities and a great insight to how great of a man Senna was both on and off the track. Even though he's not around anymore R.I.P., I still consider him the greatest driver of all time. He will never be beaten or forgotten
0099549069|5.0|I read all Murakami's books, including 1Q84.  This one did not disappoint. He is one of Japan preeminent writers today.
0345803493|4.0|Simple, I liked the book. Everyone is Fifty Shades of Grey; we all have some issues. I know I was not reading a literary masterpiece and I have read worse. I thought the characters were on the same the level. He was so inexperienced because he was abused and did not get it. And she was just plain inexperienced. The one problem I had with Ana was she dates the hot billionare and mad cause he spends a 1000 bucks for a laptop on her, really? Yet she lived off her friend's fortune with no problem. I wanted to scream shut up and take the car. LOL. And those that claimed they hated the story and read all 3............. (It was no Oliver and Jenny \\"Love Story\\")
B003O86FMW|1.0|The second book in the hunger games series was a big letdown. It seemed forced,and pretty unbelievable even for futuristic fiction. I don't think I'll waste my time on the third book<br />.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I don't understand the bad reviews for this little book.  1 - It was free.  2 - It was Harlequin.  3 - It's Jump the Shark romance.  Love it for what it is and you get your money's worth.
0060873175|4.0|When I first heard that Richard Preston was finishing one of Michael Crichton's books, I was excited to say the least. I am a huge fan of both authors. When I started the book, I was quickly sucked in and I enjoyed this book a great deal. The only reason why I'm giving it a 4 star rating is because I was a little disappointed with the whole futuristic shrink machine. Other than that, this book turned out to be well worth every penny I spent on it. I will give a warning to anyone planning to read it: It has some graphic scenes. I will also point out there was some language. Other than this, this is a book I would highly recommend to my friends and family.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome book loved it. From how it read to me the movie was almost spot on. Great stuff!!! A must read for all ages.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|not as funny as I would have liked. Too much of a story line, it would have been a little better as a complete joke of a movie. I think they tried to make it a real movie and killed it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great book for the fifty shades darker book by e l james and can't wait to read the next book
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Relaci&oacute;n Costo - Beneficio, actualmente lo tengo en una PC de ultra gama y con el puedo correr Battlefield 3 en Ultra
B00APUQT7I|5.0|The kids enjoyed this movie and have watched it more than once now. I am happy that I bought this movie.
0307887448|5.0|a must read for any gamer, but anyone would enjoy the great plot and well developed characters, that had me hook, line and sinker.
B009KYXEY6|4.0|I found her music in a Nescafe commercial, tracked her down and am now her biggest fan. Lana's videos are also awsome. I am so glad I bought this CD.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I wanted to read this book for such a long but never got the time to. I'm so glad I finally read it!! It's a very easy read (I finished it in 3 days) and very different from most books. Definitely recommend this to anyone!!
B008KEQMDC|1.0|unfortunately for me this DVD did not work in Australia even though I took particular care in ordering for my region.  I have repurchased here recently when it become available
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This is the first and only online Bible I've tried, so I don't really have anything to compare it against.  At any rate, it does what I need it to do and I'm satisfied with that.
B0099114WO|1.0|unfortunately for me this DVD did not work in Australia even though I took particular care in ordering for my region.  I have repurchased here recently when it become available
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is a lot fun.. though can be difficult at times. though it will keep you coming back for more. very good graphics. one of the better free apps games.
B005LAII12|1.0|unfortunately for me this DVD did not work in Australia even though I took particular care in ordering for my region.  I have repurchased here recently when it become available
B00447G29S|5.0|This is a great family movie and the 3-D effect is one of the best that I have seen in a movie. I would recommend this highly.
B0038M61I2|5.0|If you're looking at this review you should own this music.  I don't know where this ranks in the jazz pantheon, but I would put it way up there.  Rollins was probably the best saxophonist in the world when this was recorded.  Shelley Manne and Ray Brown were worthy peers.  They recorded this in a few early morning hours and half a century later no one has done the trio better (except maybe Rollins at the Village Vanguard).  The extra tracks are as good as the originals.  Accessible, beautiful, humorous, funky.
B00701897I|4.0|The movie was very good but the 3-D effects were not as good as some other movies I have seen.
1419705849|4.0|My youngest daughter loves this book series (age 9).  Her two older sisters (13 and 15) enjoy it a lot too.  There is some really funny stuff in the series.
B0053KWDES|4.0|I bought this portable amp recently to combine with my iPod classic. When I plugged in my Shure Se530 IEM with LO jack and I found an obvious improvement. The sound came clearly and powerful. I can hear more detail without raise the volume. But when I tried to raise the volume(not as a extremely high volume, just raised a little more than normal listening), I found the sound became loose control. Treble became a shrill taste, didn't sound good anymore. It seems like all improvements are due to using LO instead of weakness PO jack, not the amp. Maybe this product would work better on over ear headphone. If you have some good IEMs I wouldn't highly recommend you this amp.<br /><br />But I still like it cause its size is like born with iPod classic, the using experiment is great. You can use the LO jack on iPc without too much cost(Before that I use the transportation dock--onkyo NDs-1 and an desktop DAC, Onix dac1, they sound good but those cost me over $1000, and it can't move easily).I think it's the best amp considering only 60 dollars cost.
B009M588K8|5.0|This book is fantastic.  It is a very cool read.  Anyone interested in the Bin Laden kill and hearing the background will thoroughly enjoy this book.
B007MC8YLQ|4.0|I have always enjoyed playing freecell on my computer. This is one step better cause I get the same great game that I can take with me anywhere.
B009MF56GC|1.0|the dvd would not play ...another dud from amazon...very dissapointing,that is another dvd that has failed to work,will not be buying anymore
B009YP9L7U|5.0|So cute... this book was definitely one that makes you wonder what's going to happen next.<br />Recommend for someone who likes a love story
B0085YNML2|3.0|Its good in the begining but sometimes tapers off, and seems like you cant get back where you need to be.
B00A757EFW|4.0|Loved this game! The music brings back the memories! It was easy to play to!! Best of all my 9yr old and 6yr old love to play it.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|was fun but needed more levels. finished too soon.  done in just a few hours.  might try another g5. would get another for sure.
B001706I5I|5.0|This is something great to watch with the family. My LOs read the book at school and loved being able to see the movie version.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|It was a delightful book that made me laugh and cry during the up and down courses of this unconventional marriage. I hope that she has more books for us romance enthusiasts to read in the future.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|I was expecting this to be a lot funnier than it was. I was disappointed that there weren't more funny parts. The acting was ok. The quality of the movie was good.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I like being able to check my Facebook account even when i am not at home.  That way I can keep in touch with my Facebook friends.
B002YK8OKC|5.0|A great classic Christmas movie that a must see during the holidays season.  There are too many great one liners in this movie.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I like playing this game but would like to know how to customize the game to make it a little more challanging.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I must confess I feel guilty playing this game as the object is to kill as many people and to inflict as much death on the world before they find a cure. It's like Simcity meets weapons of mass destruction. :-D
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Couldn't put the book down.  What an ending.  Sparks sweeps you away with more characters to miss after putting the book down.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Wife and I are leaving the country, and this will help meet our zombie killin needs.  It also came ahead of schedule.  Thank you.
B007STBUIW|5.0|My son is a movie collector and really wanted this film on blue ray.It is a welcome addition to his collection.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Any Batman fan needs to get this right away! It's the perfect series to just sit back and enjoy it with a bunch of friends.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This box set of Harry Potter fit the expectations of which the advertised media suggested. The disc came in a reputable, clean quality and the box itself is quite sturdy and stable. I would recommend this to a friend. However, if you are looking for the collectors edition of the discs this is not for you. I only say this because of some of the replies I had read when purchasing this product. All in all it is a good buy for a present.
B001JIES4Q|5.0|This is my favorite Christmas movie of all time. I've seen it countless times. I finally decided to buy it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was so heartfelt and deep I just couldn't put it down. I just loved how Sky and Holder were always a dominant force in each other's lives.
B001TH16DI|5.0|This is a must have for all you Trekkies out there!  The packaging is very attractive and of course it arrived in good condition.  Star Trek is sooo much better in this format.

B009HQ9UHC|1.0|Bad Piggies HD. Cannot figure out how you are supposed to play it. Wish it had some kind of instructions. Probably my bad.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|As with most concert versions of musicals, this production features stellar production values in the voice and instrumental departments while only \\"suggesting\\" the stage action instead of having the performers enact the show in full.<br /><br />This should not put you off. I myself had never seen Les Miz in any other format and found this performance easy to follow and entirely enjoyable.<br /><br />As others have suggested, only Nick Jonas is a bit out of place amongst the rest of the singers, since his pop-music voice lacks a certain depth and cannot sustain a vocal line. Nonetheless he does a charming job and certainly looks the part of Marius. His acting is quite good too.<br /><br />Special mention must be given to the encore event that follows the main performance. It goes on for about a half-hour and is not to be missed -- whatever you do, do not stop watching after the final chorus of the show! I won't spoil it for anyone, but there is one delightful surprise after another. The result was quite moving even for someone like me, who has not been a lifelong fan of this show.<br /><br />Highly recommended to anyone who has an interest in musical theater.

B00A8Z6KN8|5.0|If you've heard the soundtracks from the Lord of the Rings movies, then you have a pretty good idea of what to expect from this. There is also, however, the inclusion of the dwarves' songs, which provide another layer of depth.<br /><br />If I had to criticize this, I would say that by preserving the idée fixe of the LOTR it doesn't differentiate itself as much as I would have liked. But it does breathe new life into the music we know and love, and for that I salute Howard Shore once again.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Great book it keeps you involved all the way through! I loved it. Can't wait to read the next one.

B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I read the Vince Flynn books and loved the character Mitch Rapp.  I wanted to find another character to believe in.  I have just read this first book but I might have found what I was looking for in Jack Reacher.  He is far from perfect but I love that I never know what to expect from him except that he will figure out what is right.  Can't wait to read the next book!

The author does a wonderful job at describing Pat's bipolarity without stigmatizing him. I'm sure there are many other reviews with more details. My 2cts. are about how much I enjoyed the story. This is a book I can see myself reading again.

B000EUDAWG|1.0|The remote control has a battery door that is held down by a recessed philips head screw.  That screw will not turn to open the battery case.  I and others have tried every philips head attachment that I have (about ten) and none will get that screw<br /> to turn.  The hole that the screw is recessed in is too small to allow some philip head attachments to entire.  Worse stillis that the screw is made of soft white metal and if one tries too many times there will be no screw head left.  Evidential I had to drill tthe screw out and replace it.<br />Now there is also a battery door on the bottom of the spider.  This door is held down by an even small screw.  Luckily I had an eye glasses screw driver, otherwise I have no idea how one would get this door open.<br />The small plastic wheels and small plastic gear that drives the spider jam and will not turn after about 20 seconds of motion.  Even when in motion the wheel drive gears do not work well. I can manually unjam them, but the jam back up shotly there after.<br />The gears are not a perfect fit and when your running on 2 AAA batteries there isn't much power to force them to move.<br />The remote contoller is only effective over a very short distance and if an object comes in between, the sider stops.

B007MDB548|4.0|If you're considering buying Secret of the Wings, there's a good chance you have already seen the first three Tinkerbell movies. This one is a very good entry and fits right in with the others in terms of quality (the second movie, Lost Treasure, is the only dud in the series). The film features fun new characters and big revelations. Megan Hilty (of Broadway and \\"Smash\\") has replaced Kristen Chenoweth (of \\"Pushing Daisies\\" and general awesomeness) as Rosetta, which is not very noticeable even if it is a step down. Angelica Houston as Queen Clarion is more featured in this entry, which is nice.<br /><br />I have the DVD/Blu Ray combo pack. The TV special \\"Pixie Hollow Games\\" is included on both my DVD and Blu-Ray disc special features, so I'd assume you'd get it if you bought just the DVD edition. Pixie Hollow Games is 22 minutes and features Rosetta, though Tinkerbell also has a small role. I don't have a 3D player and don't know if it's on the 3D disc.

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Thank you for writing this book for everyone to enjoy it . The books that you write are amazing .
B009AMAM9S|3.0|There are 5 Stories running side-by-side here, so it's very long. They give you just enough of each story to keep you guessing, but not enough to give you answers. Think of LOST (the TV show). It's like that. If you were to take any one of the stories, and just watch that alone, then it would be a lot of nothing that happens, and then stops. But they didn't do that. They cut 5 stories that that have nothing by themselves to offer, but as a whole, are interesting. What carries the movie, is trying to figure out who is what Character, in what time line.<br />If you like the idea of splicing pieces (not all) of Moby Dick, Shine, Jackie Brown, One Flew Over the CucKoo's Nest, and Minority Report together, then you'll like this film.<br />It's a good film....... to watch once.<br />Problem is, when you start asking questions, you realize they set up lots of questions but answered none. This is why It's like LOST. There are also a lot of little things that the people of LOST can play with. \\"Did you see the logo on the side of <object>? It had the same numbers as Story B...\\" etc.<br />There is also the underlining themes of Racism, then Sexism, then Age-ism, then Humanism, followed by Tribalism, to try to say \\"We all are one people\\".<br />LOST was very popular, but when you think about it, it really was a show about nothing.<br />The same can be said about Cloud Atlas... or someone can create a \\"discussing Cloud Atlas\\" course in Collage somewhere, and make money.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Absolutely fantastic writing! The twists and turns are endless, the character development is brilliant. It's nearly impossible to put these books down, and at such a low price, how can you say no?
B008R14YBK|5.0|This album is really amazing. When I first heard all of the songs, I was like this is an okay album and some songs I just completely dismissed without completely giving them a chance. Then once I bought the album, I was able to listen to the songs more and pay more attention to the musical quality and the lyrics. Bridgit has delivered a solid, stellar album. People you have to listen to the songs more than once before you say you don't like them. It was like that for me with a couple of the songs such as Hurricane, Love Will Tell Us Where To Go, and 5:15. These songs are actually not bad at all. In fact, Hurricane has become my new favorite. The only song I don't really care for that much is The Fall Song. Buy this album. You won't regret it. I hope this isn't the last we hear from Bridgit. I hope she gets more fans! She's great and I love her character Teddy on Good Luck Charlie.
B004LW8C0I|5.0|Product came in a timely fashion and was exactly what I expected.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Great experience for me.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|I'm one of those Pixar fans that is willing to put money down on any film Pixar produces -- before I even know what it is.  I have such faith in the company that I know I'll enjoy the film regardless of what it's about.<br /><br />While I very much enjoyed Brave, I have to admit that it is possibly the worst Pixar film yet.  In terms of technical quality, it rocks!  Fantastic animation, color grading, effects, and sound.  Brilliant!!  The story, however, is a bit tired and predictable -- and that's where my only disappointment comes in.  There isn't much new under the sun... but Pixar has found ways, in previous films, to bring something new to the screen in every scene.  So, even if you know &#34;the good guy is going to win and get the girl in the end&#34; they still find ways to make the whole ride a 'new' experience.  But I didn't get that experience with this film.  In fact, I could almost see every scene coming before it arrived on the screen -- it was that predictable.  There were some original moments in the film, but just not enough to keep me interested.<br /><br />Ultimately, I was a happy customer watching this film... but for the first time with a Pixar film I can honestly say that I don't need to watch it a second time (keep in mind that I have not seen Cars 2 yet -- which my wife says she doesn't care to watch a second time -- so maybe there will be two Pixar films that I don't find &#34;above average&#34;).
B005LAIGN2|5.0|This is a great movie.  It's moving, humorous, historical, uplifting and the acting is incredible.  This is a movie all Americans should see.  George Lucas really did something special with this one.
B000YHG72E|4.0|Soon to be a cult classic.  Will Ferrell, you either love him or you hate him.  Great movie for the holidays.
B00ADS98FC|4.0|A little risque at times, but overall a fun film with light romantic comedy and great young voices singing acapella.
B00AEFVRB2|2.0|I don't know why movies are all headed this way.  My opinion, this is just bad television.  This movie may appeal to some, but its definitely not something for the entire family.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I bought this book based on the reviews from readers. When I first started reading it, I thought I had made a mistake in purchasing it because of the age of the characters. After reading the first chapter I was hooked! This book made me happy, sad, angry, aroused (even though there really are no graphic sex scenes in the book) and even had me laughing out loud. This is one of the best books I've read in a long time!

B005VPRDAY|5.0|There is so much outrage and uproar that lego dared to make gender specific versions of this iconic toy.  Playgroup is in an uproar!!!  Moms are swearing they will only buy the &#34;regular&#34; legos for their daughter.  Outrage and gasps of horror all around.<br /><br />Well, our daughter adores the little pink and purple legos.  Yes, she plays with &#34;regular&#34; legos too when she is at her friends homes.  She really does prefer the &#34;girly&#34; legos.  This is her first set of her very own legos and it has been hours of fun.  Just like &#34;regular&#34; legos there are suggested things you can build.  This set has the parts to make a little cottage, a purple & pink car, trees, a dog and a picnic scene.  I made the car for her, she made the cottage and then she played with this toy for several hours.  Methodically putting together new &#34;creations&#34; and taking them apart.  Making the dog talk to the girl mini figure, then turning the dog into a &#34;sea horse&#34;.  I guess I will be crucified when everyone sees the *gasp* PINK legos but she loves them.

B009JBZH54|5.0|There's plenty of great reviews for the actual films so im skipping that. The pros are too many to list but these are my minor issues id like to share. Batman Begins and Dark Knight both lack main menus but do have a pop up menu. I prefer a full menu but thats just me. Dark Knight and Dark Knight Rises both have awesome IMAX shots, however the audio during those sequences is suddenly and noticeably lower. Which is odd because most of these scenes are action packed. Lastly, IMAX scenes have a different aspect ratio than the rest of the film so youre bound to notice the sudden black bars. My review may sound negative but these are minor issues that conflict with my preferences. Otherwise a must buy bundle for Batman and Nolan fans alike.

B008R9QAY6|5.0|This recording of Leonardo Vinci's \\"Artaserse\\" will likely be considered the benchmark for casting counter-tenors in opera recordings, or, at least, it definitely should be.  Despite being a fan of both Jaroussky and Cencic, I was a little afraid that having a cast full of countertenors would have a sterile, monochrome feeling (much like the 1986 recording of Hasse's \\"Cleofide\\" with Emma Kirkby, Derek Lee Ragin, Dominique Visse, & co).  An opera like \\"Artaserse\\" must have virtuosic singers capable of both technical prowess and a varied palette of vocal colors, and countertenors sometimes have a tendency to sound like hooty, English choir boys (like Paolo Lopez in the recent recording of Vivaldi's \\"Teuzzone\\").  So, my one hope was that this varied cast of characters would avoid the dreaded sopranist clich&eacute;s and offer a rich portrayal for Vinci's drama.<br /><br />I was not to be disappointed!  I'd say that that Jaroussky and Cencic are talents of proven quality, but it is the agile and flamboyant Franco Fagioli who ultimately steels the show.  Vinci's Artaserse has mainly lyric passages that suit, quite well, the ethereal nature of Jaroussky's high voice.  Beautiful though the voice is, Jaroussky is possessed of a somewhat narrow range; however, his music is a perfect fit for his instrument and reflects the noble character of his timbre.  But, narrow vocal range aside, Jaroussky brings Artaserse's heroism alive in arias like \\"Nuvoletta opposta al sole.\\"  Similarly, high-flying Valer Barna-Sabadus, singing Semira, recently broke onto the scene with some gorgeous, legato singing in his \\"Hasse: Reloaded\\" album.  His, too, is a voice that is comfortable sitting high on the staff, and the beautiful, earthy tone is a good contrast to Jaroussky's clear, bell-like sound.  The fuller sound is quite passably feminine, and Barna-Sabadus plays the wilting damsel with full conviction born of a secure technique (see aria: \\"Per quell'affetto\\" for a particularly notable example of characterization and tasteful ornamentation).<br /><br />Yuriy Minenko and Daniel Behle (as a tenor, Mr. Behle has the lowest voice in the group) play the bad guy types to the hilt! Minenko's snarling Megabise brings a bright, dangerous edge to his singing as evidenced by his opening aria \\"Sogna il guerrier le schiere,\\" where, horns blazing, he displays a dazzling technical mastery of bravura singing.  It's a shame that Minenko doesn't have more to do, but I can definitely envision him perfecting baroque villains in the coming future (can anyone else picture his nasty Tolomeo?).  Additionally, Behle seems to be one of the go-to tenors for baroque recordings these days.  Steady technique makes up for a less individualistic voice, but the characterization is, indeed, vivid.  The sustained \\"Amalo\\" in the latter part of the aria \\"Amalo e se al tuo aguardo\\" gives me chills each time I listen to it.  I'd say that Behle's abilities have improved/solidified since recording \\"Farnace\\" in 2011.<br /><br />Cencic's Mandane is a complex creature: full of fire and sadness.  Mandane's opening aria illustrates Cencic's prowess in martial arias, and there is no doubt that one would not want to get on the wrong side of this princess, but it is the softer sentiments that really capture Cencic in his element.  The small phrase `ingrata Semira\\" in Mandane's last aria, \\"Mi credi spietata,\\" breaks my heart each time I hear it.  Out of the entirety of the role, those two words stick with me because of the extraordinary anguish and color with which Cencic imbues his portrayal.  Bravo!<br /><br />And, that leaves the gentleman of the hour: Franco Fagioli.  I was mildly impressed with Fagioli's album of Mozart and Handel arias, and more intrigued by his Demetrio in Alan Curtis' \\"Berenice.\\"  But, it is his portrayal as Arbace that really brings Fagioli's abilities to light: security of voice, impeccable coloratura, trills, agility, etc.  I'd run out of superlatives discussing Fagioli's work here, but one only need listen to his aria \\"Vo solcando un mar crudel\\" to get the full picture.  I'd hope that EMI continues to put his talents to good use, because Fagioli has an amazing instrument when given the right material.  The duet between Mandane and Artabane is gorgeous, and it is a perfect melding of Cencic and Fagioli's different timbres.<br /><br />The Concerto K&ouml;ln is most ably conducted by the passionate Diego Fasolis.  I'd be interested to know why Fasolis' own orchestra, I Barocchisti, wasn't employed for the recording, but I won't complain with the result here.  The orchestra's verve and color bring out every nuance of Vinci's music, and both Fasolis and the players are to be commended.  EMI's mastering is top notch.re, but one only need listen to his aria \\"Vo solcando un mar crudel\\" to get the full picture.

B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|My package arrived early and everything was in one piece. The CDs all work. Couldn't be happier. It's a great show too.
B000Q67876|5.0|This is a great movie and when I saw the day after thanksgiving deal I had to get it, it is a must have for me.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Fun little app. Easy load, simple game play. My daughter loves to watch the drawing come to life, I love seeing her little drawing when I'm at work.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|The movie pauses continually throughout. It's really frustrating and I need to return it. Disappointed in the quality of it.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|This movie introduced me to the the Final Fantasy franchise, and has been my absolute favorite film ever since. The story is terrific, and the Blu-Ray added scenes that really filled in the few gaps in the story. This movie is a must-have for any CGI or FF fan. (Wonderful character development too!)
B003L77G10|5.0|This series follows a wonderful story arc.  And the acting couldn't be better.  Diane Baranski should win more Emmy awards.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|If you enjoy historically based fiction then this book is for you. The characters are well developed against the backdrop of the absolute evil of fascism. I really found this book interesting.
B00A6N8F4Y|3.0|movie was okay. Benecio del Toro was great in it.  And I always love seeing Blake Lively.  But overall plot was average
B0091REZMW|3.0|this game is very interesting. its not really what I thought that it would be but its okay. I don't know why its a search and find game tjough
1607066017|5.0|this book is a fresh breath of literary air. imaginative and fun.alien yet all too human . I recomend it to any one
B00AMBH70S|2.0|Plot was terrible and the ending was even worse. It was a problem that it had not much to do with the first 3 originals - it was just plain bad.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I've read the Percy Jackson series, the Kane Chronicles, and the other two books in The Heroes of Olympus. But this by far is the most hilarious,suspenseful,action-packed book of all. I would write more but it would take me days to explain why this book is worth your while. Rick Riordan covers everything with immensely detail: drama, action, romance, humor, and smart thinking. From the most delicate words of passion and love to laughing to death jokes and sarcasm thinks has it. But the only thing I hate is that I was left at a cliffhanger. The Mark of  Athena was so delicious it left me hungry for more. Love this book from the bottom of my heart.
1423124111|5.0|I received this book for Christmas and am so very surprised!  As a collector of my favorite attraction posters, this book is such a great addition.  I may not be able to hang these on the wall, but to have them all in one place is fantastic.  I also love seeing the original artwork and the current artwork for the same attractions.  If you're an avid Disney fan I highly recommend this book.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Could not put my Kindle down until I finished it! The mini games were (mostly) challenging and the plot moved along and made sense.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|My friend, Allison, recommended this book (via Facebook) through a status update revealing her top 20 favorite books of 2012. Hopeless was listed first, so I decided to make a purchase. I loved it so much I finished the entire book in two short days. It is a great read that keeps you emotionally invested throughout, with many unsuspected plot twists. Looking forward to reading more books by Colleen Hoover :)
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I like this  game, easy to play.  Good for any age. Good game to start with on the Kindle Fire
B00992CF6W|4.0|its okay I'm not sure about it because I thought it would have monsters but it doesn't and you can die just dig straight down but I still like it
B007SGLZP8|3.0|While it was overall a good read with a pretty much predictable outcome. I was highly surprised that a seasoned, best-selling author like Mr. Grisham doesn't know the difference between \\"staunch\\" and \\"stanch.\\"  There were some typos that were somewhat distracting, but the misuse of \\"staunch\\" made me less than anxious to finish the book. I expected more of you, Mr. Grisham.  It's like you're just cranking them out now just for the sake of having a book out there.
B006ZPJWBM|5.0|This is just a great DVD. For his birthday, Tony selects a variety of artists to collaborate with and the end results are magical. So fun to watch the younger, hip artists from a variety of musical genres as they meet and perform with a musical icon. Tony's musical selections are &#34;spot on&#34; and highlight the strengths of his duet partners, giving them a chance to shine. This is fun for everyone, from young to old.
B00340ESIS|5.0|This book delivered on it's promise.  Great tool for writers of fiction, not just screen writers.  Engaging and informative. If this guy ever offers a class, I'd love to take it.
B00AMBLDEE|2.0|this was the worst of the bourne series. couldnt figure out were this one belonged. story started out nowhere and went nowhere. very dissapointing.
B0015DWJX2|4.0|Loved the book, both the letter writing technique - which enables the reader to learn about the various characters in small parcels, growing through the book.  The descriptions of Guernsey made be want to visit.
B000YJ85BI|3.0|Well-written, still expanding the Old Man's world, but not as action-packed as before. The mysteries were explained in the first two books, this still wraps up some (but not all) loose ends around why the whole universe are so decided the humans must die. OK read if you loved the first in the series.
B005NKGEP2|1.0|I read this book as a book club book.  That was the only reason I didn't stop after the first couple of chapters.  Nothing about the book rang true for me.  We live abroad, and this certainly didn't reflect any sort of reality as far as living in Europe.  And, if she is a CIA operative, how was she so duped by her husband's so called work in Luxembourg?<br />Just a waste of reading time.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|After reading a streak of terrible sci-fi/tech thrillers, this made Yule holiday a joy!<br />A short story, three novellettes and one novella packed in one dirt cheap bundle. And well-written. Very much so. Character building, suspense building, mysteries found and solved (and not always in that order), well-meaning villains, flawed heroes, a believable dystopic world, sadness, despair, love, loss, death. Yes.<br />My best fiction read of 2012, hands down.<br /><br />My Kindle is already loaded with unread books, so I may still manage to wait until Silo books 6-8 comes along bundled. But don't bet on it. Must-read!
1423140605|4.0|Okay, at first I was a little concerned about the whole four different narratives thing.  Sure Riordan pulled off three in the other two books, but four seemed to be pushing it, however, I found myself needlessly concerned and actually really enjoyed it.  This book is really fun and rather ambitious.  With so many main players and factions it could have easily dissolved into chaos, but Riordan managed to keep all of the threads together weaving a fast paced, but introspective story, while not losing me.  My hat off to him and his obvious skills.<br /><br />I tore through this book with an unexpected speed and high degree of excitement.  It greatly builds upon Annabeth's character and gives a lot more insight into her.  As always Leo made me laugh, adding a lighthearted note to drama, though the explanation of why Leo looked like Hazel's friend Sammy was kind of disturbing.  I found something wanting in Frank's character for this book and missed how much understanding of him I received while reading The Son of Neptune.  I loved watching the dynamic between the alphas (Jason and Percy), the kind of love triangle (Frank, Hazel and Leo) Annabeth, as the conflicted and burdened leader and Piper trying to find her place in the crowd.  I relished the dramatic ending and the unexpected turn of events when everything seemed okay.  There is no real sense of satisfaction to the end of this book unlike The Lost Hero and The Son of Neptune.  And now I find next Fall is just too long to wait for, The House of Hades!<br /><br />For the full review and others visit whymsylikesbooks dot blogspot dot com
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Amazing quality on this DVD. I highly recommend it. Great having all types of DVDs in one pack. Love it.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|That was a great book. I just don't know why Greg freak out that much when he sees the &#34;chicken pock&#34; on Abigail chin, which really was a pimple. I think could of got the girl if he didn't scream all crazy like that. But over all, I think that was the best Diary Of The Wimpy Kid yet!!!!!! I can't wait til thae next one comes out.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved it it was the best book that my book club ever read you should read it loved it
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|The CD is great, I liked this young man from the start of the Idol show..keep up the great work..
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is one of the best that I have played. There is lots to d  so you don't get bored, and it is from one of my favorite movies!
1612183956|5.0|Found the summary intriguing, so bout it on a lark. Turned out to be a very interesting, engaging read of pleasant length, that leaves you with something to think about. I intend to look at other books by this author.
B001P06GX4|5.0|It's a great family game.  It's easy enough for young players and challenging enough for the smartest players.<br />Our mom had so much fun, she had us order her a game of her own.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Michael Connelly still knows how to slightly extend a story beyond its natural length and still make it worth reading.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|So far it's good.  Hasn't asked me to purchase yet. Good challenges.  Cute short puzzles. Hope this is the full version as it is quite enjoyable.
B000SEGUDE|3.0|INtersting premise with uneven chaptures-a must read though it you're going to watch the movie, which is less understandable than the book
B005LAIIPS|3.0|Sequels always invite comparisons especially when they change main characters. Also the only thing \\"Bourne\\" about this film is the legacy part. Bourne's out of the picture (sorry), and is replaced by his legacy, Aaron Cross (played by Jeremy Renner). Actors from past Bourne movies include Joan Allen, David Strathairn, and Albert Finney. Ed Norton, Stacy Keach and Rachel Weisz are added to the credits.<br /><br />This is a movie you have to watch very closely. One bathroom break or trip to the refrigerator and you're done. You will not figure this out if you fast for a month and seek the answer in a vision. I finally pick up an idea of what the movie is about with Ed Norton's character who is trying to contain a Tread stone-like descendant operation, Operation Outcome that he is afraid will get out of control with scandalous outcomes. (Sorry again). The only way to do that is to kill the next generation of agents who are chemically engineered to perform significant feats of prowess and bravery. Rachel Weisz, stunning as ever, is Doctor Marta Shearing, or Doctor Death, as I like to call her. She administers dose and drug to the agents, and almost becomes a victim of the program when one scientist targets other scientists, killing everyone but her. The CIA sends another team pretending to be concerned caregivers to help her kill herself.<br /><br />Enter Aaron Cross who comes out of nowhere and we see the first real hand-to-hand combat action that is even more awesome as they increase camera speed until you can't even follow the blows and blocks anymore. Cross and Shearing join forces to discover why they have been targeted for elimination. The trail takes them to Manila with the Police and an assassin rounding out a great chase scene that begins on foot and ends up in motorcycles.<br /><br />The beginning of the movie is slow before going bipolar with a pace and script that is hard to follow. Flashbacks to previous Bourne movies and characters try to tie in the past (Bourne) to what's going on today (his legacy). If you haven't seen previous Bourne adventures, it can obfuscate as easily as clarify.  The best part for me was the mortal combat, the wolves, the sound during chases, and the part in Alaska. The worse part for was the plot, the story, the script, the pace, and the part in Alaska.<br /><br />You may have to watch this twice before you understand it, and three times before you like it.<br /><br />For me, this was Operation Gall Stone.Bourne) to what's going on today (his legacy). If you haven't seen previous Bourne adventures, it can obfuscate as easily as clarify.  The best part for me was the mortal combat, the wolves, the sound during chases, and the part in Alaska. The worse part for was the plot, the story, the script, the pace, and the part in Alaska.<br /><br />You may have to watch this twice before you understand it, and three times before you like it.<br /><br />For me, this was Operation Gall Stone.
B007SY3CEW|4.0|Fun game. I need better sound on my kindle fire, though. Wish my fingers were smaller so that I wouldn't hit two keys at once!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is really fun.  it is kind of challenging but it makes you think.  this is fantastic for my little brothers and me.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|Good story, but sometimes it felt like someone else wrote it. I have enjoyed most of Patricia Cornwell's work over the years.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|An intense story, difficult to follow at first as there are so many characters. But as the story grows and you learn each of the characters and their storylines (and how they all fit together) you become drawn in. I couldn't put it down! Can not wait to read the next book!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't put it down, every time you think you've figured it all out, the story flips and you find yourself in the dark again, I highly recommend this book! You won't be disappointed!
B007THA4FI|5.0|It was hard to read this at the start of the story, because all I could think of was 'When will the magic start?'.<br />Once you push past the fact that this is not in anyway Harry Potter (Which was hard as I am a HUGE Harry Potter Fan) it is an incredible story. So many sad tales crashing into one another to become one dramatic story.<br />I was devastated by the ending. Lets just say that there were many tears.<br />Very different but well done all the same.<br />I'll be honest, if it wasn't written by JK Rowling I probably would have glanced at the blurb and never read the story. But I am glad I did.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I decided that I had to get out of the 60's for my music choices.  I really enjoyed this album.  It kind of reminded my of Meatloaf. :-)
B008O9V4C2|5.0|I have followed Donald Fagen work since Can't Buy A Thrill - He never disappoints me - Sunken Condos is another fine release -I would recommend this CD.
B0080YGZ20|4.0|I love Kimbra's style. Her lyrics are clever, her songwriting is inventive and original, and her singing is captivating and unique. This album is good from beginning to end, and goes from good to great on several tracks. Unlike most pop albums, this release has more good tracks than disappointing ones. For that alone it deserves praise. But she goes far beyond &#34;not sucking&#34; and takes this album to the level of greatness.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I enjoyed the whole series. This book has a lot of twists and turns  such as Katniss being pregnant and the whole time there was a plan for a revolt plus the part about there is no District 12..
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|Nothing too imaginative going on here beyond the initial concept. I was hoping for more. Pretty bland stuff rying to survive on shock value.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This was a gift for our son and he was really excited to get it. He had been wanted it and this was a great gift. Thanks
0553381407|3.0|Of course my parents are toxic, and it is their fault, and it damaged me. From the reviews I have readIt took her the, I think most agree on that. I would like a better understanding of the psychology and a toxic parent-child relationship. It took her the whole book to explain that it wasn't my fault. I know. Now, I would like a more thorough strategic plan that actually empowers me to be mentally delivered from my damage. I will do that rest of the work on my own because I have no ther choice, but if another another toxic parent book comes out that actually offers an effective srategy then my hands are on it.
0062082353|5.0|The book was great and hubby was excited to get it. He loves to read about the navy and this book will be just perfect.Thanks
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Fault in Our Stars is an interesting and touching story.  One of those books that's difficult  to put down.  John Green's thoughts are deep, clever, and well expressed as the story revolves around life, death, and love. Teenagers dying of cancer. You may shed a few tears.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|We love this show. the quality of the show on Amazon is also amazing. I gave up cable and do not regret it one bit! this show keeps you wondering what could possibly happen next!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Ive always loved comic books and I equally enjoy all the new super hero movies. Avengers is definitely going in my dvd collection.  I loved it. I also am a fan of Robert Downey J. as Iron man.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app allows you to go far beyond the regular 1 game. This app truly gives you every sort of game.
B0085157B8|3.0|Gary Bussey reaches his acting zenith in this dog when he is eaten by ferocious fish in the first five minutes.  Christopher Lloyd's humiliation runs throughout the flick, and David Hasselhof, well, what's to say about DH...  His most lucid moment occurs in the film when he asks himself, &#34;Can you say 'Rock Bottom?'&#34;<br /><br />Unless someone pays you to watch this, you've paid too much money.<br /><br />That said, I actually appreciated Hasselhof's obvious ability to laugh at himself.  OK, OK...  If you can see it for free, it might be a good deal.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was amazing!!!! I loved every page of it! My best friend read the book and told me to read it, because of how amazing it is. I'm glad she got me to read this book. I now want to see the movie as well.
B002JVWR4A|4.0|I love this series and I very much enjoyed this season's story line - pregnancy, new baby, fugitive.  Why were there only 13 shows?  I must have missed the memo.
B00280LYIC|4.0|This was an easy pace, fun and light reading. Good entertaining read. Glad and ready for next book in series.
B0030MM68O|5.0|They invented the phrase \\"Edge of your seat\\" for this movie.  Intense from the beginning.  Powerful acting, and not just from Jeremey Renner, but the supporting cast as well.  Worthy of the praise.
B003TSEEDY|2.0|This book is not like any other.<br />It shows the \\"real life problems\\" that everyone  has. It shows great every family has their own problem, their own ups and downs, their own fights, an  their own make ups. This book would be good for someone who is trying to get over a very tough situation or just needs another perspective on life itself.
B008PE9GSA|5.0|If ZZ Top were ever out of form? Anyway, this is a new serious album from the little ol' band from Texas which makes me think of their early works of the forst album and Rio Grande Mud. I saw them live this Summer and one must admire these guys who still love to give their fans the full value. Hats off!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Good easy read …………… goes really fast easy to understand and relate to the hard live story of true strength and will power
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|it was ok but was not the best game and it was not very entertaining I didn't get it and it was very unimusing to everyone that I showed it to
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Really like the game,wish u could earn more acorns though.I do like the scratch game. It's very entertaining and fun.
1416594795|5.0|This is quite simply the finest and easiest to read book I have ever read on the subject. No opinions, no suppositions, just the scientific facts and evidence. It speaks for itself. To read this and still say you don't 'believe' in evolution would show such a lack of intelligence as to render one an imbecile. There is nothing to 'believe' in. Just evidence of the facts which combine to proivide an understanding that without Richard's astute mind and ability to explain may have escaped me forever. I am grateful for his intelligence and ability to explain things such that we can fully understand and appreciate evolution as a fact. Richard calls it 'the fact of evolution'; that is his message and he proves the case beyond scientific question. More than that, I admire Richard's courage to stand up and be counted regarding such things, as he did in his TV series on Darwin. With Richard, science is fun, and his latest book a fantastic journey. What a ride! Brilliant work by a brilliant man. I have continued to quote Richard in my own books as his words are so powerful.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was great and had everything a good book needs romance, action, amazing characters, and a great plot. This book was great and I can't wait to read the next one
B0094BB4TW|3.0|like seeing everybody's pic and family connected with it - even over miles.. from Alaska to new jersey to Florida..we finally come together..thank you..
B009CPJHY4|4.0|I had heard about the movie and read reviews and--since I'm the age group that is focused on in the movie, I wanted to see it. I think it was a great movie with interesting characters and an intriging setting.<br /><br />I particularly liked that it was totally engaging and delightful without any violence or foul language. Great to find this in a movie today.
B0063IH60K|3.0|like that I can do card game by myself and don't have to keep score..it does it automatically. no gambling just a simply game..don't get to play too often..but like it.thanks..
B0076DELIG|5.0|I have read every Connelly novel.  He never fails to meet expectations.  I feel like I know Harry Bosch.  The Black Box is well written and hard to put down.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|like that is easy to use and handy..helps with the bills and simple math..hoping to use it more for staying on a budget..thanks
0553386794|1.0|I don't understand why this is so popular.  Three quarters of the way through, I was screaming &#34;An Editor, my kingdom for an editor!&#34;  The reason the book is so long is that GRRM never met an adjective he couldn't and wouldn't use.  If you want books about court intrigue and politics read Hillary Mantel's series on Cromwell or Dorothy Dunnett's Lymond Chronicles.  If you want fantasy, read someone who has clearly thought through a fantasy world with natural laws that are particular to that world.  GRRM doesn't do that.  There's a 700 foot wall of ice with tunnels through it and on the other side the grass is green and the wall doesn't obscure the sun?  A wolf that was newborn (and suckling) is eating a whole chicken a week later?  A nine year old child who's grown up in Northern climes knows how to swim?  Really?  Couldn't we have one explanatory sentence on that?  Winter lasts for 7 years and everyone knows it's a-coming and now we're going to war?  I'm sure there's enough sex and bloodshed in this to make for great television.  But this is not great writing.
B003I55BIA|5.0|Really enjoyed this book.  The points of view were very well written and the characters were a delight to get to know.
B0061QD82E|5.0|who wouldn't love this endearing family favorite.  appeals to all ages, and generations.  It brings me back to my childhood.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My grandchildren play this game a lot on my Kindle and they love it.  Works on eye-hand coordination and reflex time.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book is well written and you become engrossed in the story of one crazy couple addicted to each others good and bad... Yikes... a real emotional ride....
B001NLKT60|4.0|This book is actually more than 4 star, but not quite 5. I read it while traveling across Kansas and Colorado. I shoudl have found an audio version. Having now read all three of the trilogy, I moarn the loss of this writer. He produced great stuff.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|When I first heard Fitzpleasure on the radio I had no idea what language I was listening to, but I wanted to hear more. Certainly, one of the initial attractions of An Awesome Wave was novelty. However, this album has staying power tool. Alt-J has clearly borrowed musical traditions from other cultures and combined them with some electronic sensibilities. The final product has a mellow quality yet avoids feeling disengaged.
B000SEI230|5.0|I chose theratong because fhis book is probably by far the BEST book ive ever read.<br />This book was very good!
B006WQLH7G|2.0|Its become very clear that the AVAST app was ported from the google PLAY store without a thorough code review.  An example is trying to link the device to your Avast account online provides a message that the Avast app on the device cannot communicate with google Play.  Well, obviously, since its being hosted through Amazons Kindle Store one would reasonably expect it to communicate there, not via google Play.<br /><br />Also, the application is very \\"generic\\" in the sense it is a Android OS application - it has no awareness whether its being installed on a phone, Nexus tablet, Kindle, etc.  As such, features it may have or recommend may not be entirely relevant.<br /><br />While the application is very comprehensive, the setup process is somewhat cryptic for the average user.  A more user friendly gui that walks you through the setup process (and provides guidance in terms of setup order and features) would be a vast improvement.<br /><br />If AVAST makes these improvements to the relevancy of the platform its being utilized, and an easier setup process, I'm sure this would easily rate 5 stars.  Until then, I'm keeping it to 2, maybe 3.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|*SPOILER* Why kill Bane like that? It didn't make much sense. How does a large motor cycle just sneak up on Bane? Also, how do those Bat Mobiles have so little fire power? But no film is perfect I guess, my only real gripe is why Bane had to go out like a chump. I really loved that character.
B007HACDLK|3.0|Good novel, about the US involvement in the Pakistan-Afghanistan region, that of Al Qaeda, it is about the tricks and games played between the Spy Agencies of the US FBI-CIA between them and those of Pakistan, where personal ambitions of the upper echelons interfere with country relationships and give shape to further developments<br />Has some twist and turns that do not go out of the ordinary considering what you expect in a novel of this kind and profile of the author. I would have expected a better character development of Flynn superhero Mitch Rapp, and a little bit more of background research about the stage where everything develops<br />Has some good dialogues, overall a fast paced read to enjoy on the beach
B0063IH60K|5.0|I am new to the game and have enjoyed it.  I don't know how I managed to avoid learning how to play for sixty years-but it has been very entertaining. I especially like that you can't cheat!
0385535147|3.0|The first half of the book reminded me of the top notch early Grisham production where he grabs the reader by the lapels and never let him go, by way of a skillfull storytelling, but on the second half of the book, Grisham spoils the plot with a far fetched concoted story with more fantasy content that a legal thriller would allow.
B000AP04OM|5.0|I received my copy to The Sound Of Music quickly and in great shape.  Love that movie, love that music, and Amazon has made me happy!
160774273X|5.0|As a constant tinkerer in the kitchen I have LONGED for a way to make decent bread at home...you know,  the great tasting loafs that you pick up in the bakery section of your local grocery store or, if you are fortunate enough to live near one, actual bread bakery.  Kens book does it...and so much more...its not about a recipe its about a process.<br /><br />Process:  unlike most standard cookbooks,  you'll need to spend a little time reading about the process.  The first several chapters of this book are about Kens experiences in opening a bakery (which i found facinating) and the details behind the different steps involved in making a great loaf.  It may seem intimidating to think about all the steps but i made my first loaf last weekend and its really very simple..just important to do correctly.  Elements like time and temperature really need to be paid attention too.<br /><br />Equipment:  some of the negative reviews have discussed the need for equipment.  It is true that there are several unique items which this book suggests you buy to aid in the process.  That being said,  odds are you can make do with items around your kitchen.  Here's the only \\"special\\" items you'll really need:  dutch oven,  kitchen scale,  food thermometer.  Otherwise i used random bowls around our kitchen for the mixing, folding, shaping, etc.<br /><br />If you are interested in making good bread and learning about the process and science of it...this book is for you.
B002TLSSXO|5.0|Durable, dish-washer friendly, and larger in size/weight.... unlikely that these will need to be replaced in the next 5 years.
B005QI4TP8|5.0|Just like she wants her titles to be, this album, along with Lungs, is magical and very powerful. Highly recommended.
B00005MP58|5.0|Not to take anything away from Keira Knightley because I think she's great in anything she does. But this combined group of actors will never be bested in the efforts that they put into this work.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is thrilling and suspenseful. It was violent, but not gruesome. Like all of the Hunger Games books, it was action-packed. At the end of reading it, you can't wait to read the next. I don't recommend it for children, but for teens and young adults, it is the ultimate read!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I purchased this book and love it! The author's style of writing, the characters, everything about it. I didn't know the characters were high school when I bought it and was disapointed. But when I started to read that soon disappeared when I got into it. I would recommend this to anyone at any age.
0525953728|5.0|Well written book of a real life mission even though it came very late in history.  Too bad there could not be a summary of events narrated by actual personnel taking part in the mission.
B00633W614|5.0|Jeffery Archer is an excellent writer, and everyone can enjoy his books without the baggage of dirty language and over-the-top violence.

B008NB0SQO|5.0|Instant Classic. This is an interesting twist on Dickenson's Story; I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys Christmas. &#34;Light the lamp, not the rat!&#34;
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game caught my attention right away. It has just the right amount of scare and makes you think how you need to proceed.
B003Y8YXGC|5.0|Good example of Lennon's post Beatle work. About 75% of the material is top=notch. Not bd considering the uneven-ness of a lot of all of the other former band members solo work.
B001N1DPDE|4.0|Pros: The Ka-Bar Becker BK-2 is a serious hunk of quarter-inch thick carbon steel.  Overall the quality of construction is very good.  It has a full tang making it virtually indestructible.  The handle is ergonomic and feels good in your hand.  The sheath bottom half is nice in that the knife fits securely in its holster with a confidence-inspiring click.  The blade sharpens nicely with little effort on a sharpening stone and leather strop.<br /><br />Cons:  The BK-2 alone weighs in at a beefy one pound.  Make sure you really want to be carrying something that heavy before ordering this beast.  The sheer heft of this knife may discourage me from taking it on long hikes where weight is an issue.  The knife is finished in an odd textured black paint that feels like automotive undercoating.  Sharpness out of the box is mediocre. The top half of the sheath is disappointing because it is constructed from a single flimsy loop of nylon.  When I wear it on my belt, the knife flops around too much for my liking.<br /><br />Closing thoughts: I got my BK-2 about a week ago.  I like this knife. The poor sheath belt loop makes me stop short of giving this knife a full five stars.  But that alone should not discourage you from purchasing this knife.  I am confident my new Becker will take any abuse I can dish out.  If you are looking for a heavy duty and inexpensive survival knife, the Becker BK-2 should be on your list.  If you want something a bit smaller and lighter, you may want to consider the Becker BK-16 or the Gerber LMF II.
B000Y179KO|2.0|The Eagles certainly have put out some wonderful hits through the years, but there's like one song that I truly liked on Long Road.  And hey, maybe it's just me, but the songs just didn't strike a chord with me.

B005UBNKZG|4.0|Hasn't given me any trouble. Works well with my new Asus EVO R2.0 motherboard. Withstood multiple motherboard pulls to install various heatsinks. Motherboard was able to OC it up to 3950MHz, but it wasn't stable. I run it untroubled at stock 3100 Mhz.

B000MRAAJM|5.0|The pictures are beautiful, and I got it on sale around Christmas for a wonderful price ($19.99). I am very pleased with this Blu-ray!
B000055Y0X|5.0|It is more smart humor and political satire rather than slap stick comedy. I am 15 years old and i think it is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen. But it smart funny so look at the little things and you will laugh really hard!
B0056BMK6K|2.0|I assumed there would be more nuts and bolts information rather than continued self promotion.  There are some hints and tips, but nothing you can't pick up from the first page of Google for the web search &#34;Book marketing&#34;.
B0098VYKSA|1.0|I purchased in HD from a Roku, which said it had an excellent signal strength and the quality sucked, standard definition at best
B008HK3XKO|1.0|I logged in though amazon for the kindle fire for the cover, after reading comments, I order this one. Did not catch that Amazon had added the phrase fits Kindle fire HD only, so ordered it. I received the Kindle fire as a gift. so, after I opened it I found out it would not fit. So, since it was opened & I ordered wrong, Amazon will not refund for it. BEWARE AMAZON SEARCHING FOR FIRE COVERS.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved every second of this book. There were times where I couldn't put it down! Patiently waiting for the next book :)
B009HEJXFS|4.0|Few movies work as hard to ruin franchise goodwill as MIB III does in its first thirty minutes.  Your boredom quickly turns to hostility once you realize that no matter how unimpressed you are with the tepid dialogue, forced jokes, and glacial pacing, Tommy Lee Jones is even more unimpressed than you.  By a wide margin.  It's as if the man could scarcely stay awake to deliver his lines.  Will Smith, on the other hand, vamps for audience with as much enthusiasm as he can muster, although he seems to realize that he's becoming an old dog with tricks of a similar vintage.  When he and Jones share a scene together in a car early on, you feel as if you are watching two old boxers, both on the take, just waiting for a few more rounds to pass so they can call it a day.<br /><br />And then...<br /><br />The movie jumps back to 1969, trades Jones for the living miracle that is Josh Brolin, and for the next hour and a half becomes the best summer action movie you have ever seen.  The pretense for having Agent J (Smith) go back in time is to prevent an alien named Boris the Animal from killing Agent K (Jones) later in 1969--something J realizes Boris has accomplished one night when K and all evidence of his existence after 1969 go missing.  Why J can remember K post-1969 when no one else can is never satisfactorily explained, but you will stop caring once J meets 29-year old K, played by 42-year old Josh Brolin.  That Brolin could not and does not pass for a 29-year old is almost immediately irrelevant, because Josh Brolin plays Tommy Lee Jones better than Tommy Lee Jones ever has.  After you have seen Brolin's spot-on impersonation and realized that it not only matches but in many ways exceeds the original model, you will wish that other Tommy Lee Jones movies would be re-filmed with Brolin standing in.  He's just that good, and his performance elevates Smith, who finds in Brolin all the chemistry he used to have with Jones.<br /><br />The plot adds a few degrees of complexity to the \\"save K\\" framework.  First, J isn't allowed to tell K that Boris kills him because of the time-space continuum or some such nonsense.  Second, K's untimely death in 1969 kept the \\"Arc Net\\" from being deployed.  What is the Arc Net?  A plot device mostly, but also a giant shield that serves to protect the earth from an invasion by the evil race of aliens to which Boris the Animal belongs.  So, if K dies in 1969, then earth ends in 2012.<br /><br />Smith and Brolin go traipsing through 1969, and obligatory (and obvious) references to the free-love era abound.  As with most jokes predictable, these fall flat, and they take up too much time (an extended scene with an MIB agent posing as Andy Warhol is about as clever as it sounds).  So what works?  Brolin.  No matter what he is doing, it is hilarious.  And Smith, as long as he is in 1969 (the race-based interactions are particularly funny).  And, oddly enough, technology jokes (it's 1969, so all the gadgets are...bigger).  And the action sequences, especially the clever climactic battle at the Cape Canaveral launch pad which is smarter than it is loud--a rare thing in the big-budget crowd.<br /><br />But the script and director Barry Sonnenfeld truly shine with the tender elements, and not just the whopper at the end (which you will not see coming).  The smallest things--interactions between the younger K and a female agent he is sweet on, a moving vision of a baseball game that has yet to take place--are presented with none of the rush or camp that you normally find in summer tent poles.  The resulting undercurrent is somber enough to leave room for one of the most heartbreaking finales you will ever see in any movie, regardless of genre.  Agent K's steely demeanor has always belied a tragic past, a frustration at having to do the wrong thing for the right reason for far too long.  The big reveal does not disappoint, and you can feel every inch of Agent K's despair as he is presented with an awful choice, andthen something worse.  The scene is piercing, and it will linger in your memory more than any other in the series.<br /><br />It is impossible to overstate the difference between the first quarter of this film and the rest.  Had there been some tighter editing at the outset, this would be a five star movie.  As it stands, the two dissimilar parts add up to a solid, four star whole.  Enjoy.
B0053FP1PQ|5.0|cool production in songs like sabeteur and how'd you like that, mean you should give the album a few listens, preferably while on drugs, definetly a modern day masterpiece.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I started looking at this site because I'm always in need of craft ideas for work.  It's unbelievable!  Basically people are kind enough to share their ideas, much of the ideas I look at involves materials you can easily come by, and many of the crafts come from Moms or teachers.  It's a great resource.
1452110581|5.0|The book is very short, maybe a twenty minute read tops, but anyone who has ever spent time with a cat will love it.  The poems are cute and a couple made me laugh out loud, not just smile.  I got it for a few cat lovers on my list and as a stocking stuffer it delighted them as well.
B000LGZHDS|5.0|I bought this for my daughter who is a huge fan of SpongeBob. This is the cutest toy! It is a good size, well made and just plain adorable. My daughter absolutely loves it. Great gift for any fan of SpongeBob & Gary.
B008I43DYU|5.0|Nice app for the Kindle Fire. Actually makes me feel like the Kindle Fire is good for more than just Words with Friends with my daughter.
B0063GORYU|5.0|on the whole the app is very smooth. i have this on my phone and it has more options for the deal. still fun to play on the fire.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is better than Farmville. I love the movie and the family love the game too. I hope they give some free money or coins in the game to open the world up.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is really fun to play and create. My daughter plays it all the time with her friends. They can build skyscrapers to farms! This game is great for all ages and it works really well on my kindle fire HD. I think its worth the $7.00.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It's what a very good book but crazy at the same time. If you liked the hunger games your probably going to like this one too!

B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved it. Such a great book. Didn't want to stop reading. You will feel as if you know these characters.
B004HX4RT6|5.0|No bells and whistles, this is a simple straight forward chess game.<br /><br />For someone like me, who wanted to learn this awesome game, there is no better app available.<br /><br />you can make slight alterations to the game to make it more challenging or easier and the infinite undo option is good if you want to go back to review your game.<br /><br />All in all, a good app.<br /><br />Shyam
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I loved it because it was thrilling romantic dangerous and kept me on the edge of my seat I loved it

B008HK3XKO|4.0|I'm quite happy with this case.  It protects my Kindle Fire when it's in my backpack or gym bag and I use the stand all the time for watching movies - on the plane, etc.  The stand feature really is an excellent innovation.<br /><br />There are 3 drawbacks to the case that I've found.  None of them are deal breakers for me, but you might want to be aware of them:<br />1) You'll have to mount the Kindle so that it's \\"upside down\\" when you use the stand feature, OR you have to charge the Kindle with the case open. because there is no access point for the charging cable if you mount the Kindle so that the camera is at the top when using the stand feature.<br />2) It won't provide much protection from drops, it's more of a protection-in-your-backpack case<br />3) The case doesn't work well set on the \\"magazine reading rack\\" of gym equipment in my experience - treadmills, ellyptical machines, stationary bikes.  I often just take the Kindle out of the case.  Books don't work especially well with gym equipment either, so I blame the problem on the gym equipment not being designed for what I use it for.
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|Very funny movie at times, but not uproariously hilarious.  Was enjoyable to watch, but I doubt I would watch it again.  Just a fun movie to enjoy with friends, but not a classic you'd want to watch over and over.  Also, maybe it was just me, but the voice of Ted was too much like Peter Griffin (there's even a joke about this in the movie) so when I looked away or closed my eyes, it was just weird.  Even more weird since Mila Kunis is in the movie (she voices Meg) and the two characters often converse.
B003D87PPY|5.0|Simply one of the very best books out there on the rules and mechanisms of language evolution. Mr Deutscher's exploration of languages is entertaining, never facile and always enlightening.
B00A9X9VAI|5.0|Surprisingly great sc-fi thriller.  I didn't remember much this movie, but we loved JGL, so gave it a try.  We were on the edge of our seats trying to figure what happens next!
B005LAIHQS|5.0|This is the most clever of the MIB movies.  Quick paced, funny, familiar and new, all at the same time.  Very well written, true to the franchise yet delicious and new.  They expanded the world we already love.  Josh Brolin's performance as the young agent K is flawless.  You really believe it's K, just earlier in his life.  Great, great story and casting.  Definitely worth having, watching, and re watching.  We have the bluray edition with the extras.  Highly recommend.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|It is true, this movie belongs in the Alien Universe of movies but don't expect a lot of the facehuggers or Aliens you're used to seeing. This is really a prequel that is years before Alien and it gives you the backstory behind the origins of the Alien race.<br /><br />If you're expecting a space thriller/horror or action film don't you'll be very displeased. This is more of a Sci-fi movie with slight thriller elements. Sci-fi lovers will appreciate this film and the rebuilding of a new universe.<br /><br />The script and story is entertaining and believable although some of the characters are forgettable and thriller fodder, the rest of the cast makes up for the cliche moments.<br /><br />The 3D presentation of this movie is one of the best of 2012 in my opinion. If you have a 3D hometheater setup, this is certainly one of the movies you'll want to have in your collection. This is NOT an &#34;in-your-face&#34; 3D movie where everything pops out at you, the 3D adds a subtle depth to the story and immerses the audience in the environments and world, very much like the movie Hugo.
B000UX6THK|5.0|It may be streaming on Netflix, but the extras make this well worth the price for any fan who plans to watch it over and over.
0385535147|5.0|It was a very enjoyable book.  You never knew was was going to happen.  I finished it in two days.  For John Grisham -  Keep the good work up.
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|Same old, same old.  Nothing new...even the special effects where things we've seen before.  They need to put some more effort into creating original content.
B009HELT3C|5.0|My family loved this movie. It had all the same characters which is important for second and thirds of movie series. It was clean for family viewing, but intense enough to keep mama and daddy watching. ;) We love it!
