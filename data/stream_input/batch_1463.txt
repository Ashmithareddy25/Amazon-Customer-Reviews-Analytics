B007J4T2G8|1.0|Sorry I spent the 10 bucks but I succumbed to the hype.  Book clubs were talking about this one.  Turns out it is nothing more than a poorly written trashy romance novel against a modern back drop.  The pornographic characters have sex every three pages and it gets repetitive.  While it szzles and then sizzles out, the constant is the abusive relationship.  Ugg.

B0063GORYU|3.0|Challenging enough of a game but hints are frustrating. The game's hint feature shows sometimes up to four moves and I need to play the hint a few times just to see the individual moves; and I may still do something else. Worth the price. :-)
B00005YT8U|5.0|The Chieftain's went over the top with this compilation of great songs.  They created new arrangements that exceed expectations of what can be done with known songs.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I will have to say that I was highly skeptical about all of the hype that these books had been getting, and after I read the reviews (both good and bad), I decided to enter the magical world of \\"Fifty Shades.\\" I am so glad I did! I literally could not put any of the books down--I lost a lot of sleep because I did not want to leave Seattle and the adventures Ana and Christian were embarking on! When I was not reading, I felt like something was amiss and rushed back to my Kindle and get right back into the story. I spent every waking moment being a visitor into Ana and Christian's world. To see the love and lust between these two is something that is hard to find in most books and when you do find it, it is a rarity. Even though there wasn't a lot of character development, I could see the growth from the first book until the last word of the third book that Ana and Christian endured as a couple throughout the trilogy. The steamy sex scenes were very tasteful and are in no way reminiscent of erotica novels--I have read erotica and the tact and content that E L James is able to convey was refreshing.<br /><br />I have been and will continue recommending this trilogy to anyone that I know that wants a good romantic story full of ups and downs that are included in any whirlwind romance.

B00722ZIBA|5.0|I love the vocalist mix for this project.  Mo, Vanessa, and Natalie bring a fresh sound to the familiar horn and rhythm sections that Incognito fans have grown to love.  Maysa doesn't disappoint especially on Capricorn sun. The vocal ensemble on \\"The Way You Love\\" is incredible.  Vanessa's gut buster \\"Ain't It Time\\" is classic Incognito dance music.  Like a previous reviewer, it took me a second play to fall in love with the project and after a closer listen, I must say this among Bluey's best work.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|It's hard to know what to say about this book.  I gagged at some of the comments made by other readers about abuse and abusers.  Life is what it is and unfortunately abuse and abusers are reality.  I don't really see how they made the connection because Travis wasn't abusive, he was just misguided and emotionally stuck.  Abby was a very believable character as was America.  Parts of the storyline repeated but I didn't mind.  The tension between the leads was unbelievable.  I don't think I've read better.  I read it in 24 hours if that says anything.  Some of it may have been out there but I still couldn't put it down.
B00004HYLF|5.0|Despite mentioning the word \\"amazing\\" in the subject title, I actually think Romantic Warrior ends up as like, my fifth or sixth favorite Return To Forever album overall.  I really believe everything the band released before this one is better (and in the case of Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy and Where Have I Known You Before, maybe even a *lot* better).<br /><br />However where Romantic Warrior shines exceptionally bright is the fact it sounds amazingly modern and ahead of its time.  Nothing like any other mid 70's jazz album that's for sure.  An influence on todays modern jazz movement if there ever was one (along with the Weather Report's Heavy Weather of course).  For that fact alone I can totally understand the popularity Romantic Warrior has received over the years.  So Romantic Warrior is not really an overrated album because well, let's be honest- most older albums just aren't being mentioned frequently anymore, however it's also not at all underrated (what with over 70 reviews here on amazon) whereas the two albums I mention above as my favorites *are*.<br /><br />The highlight for me is easily \\"The Duel of the Jester & the Tyrant (Parts 1 & 2)\\".  When \\"Part 2\\" is actually supposed to come in I haven't a clue.  Al Di Meola steals the spotlight and makes the song absolutely *insanely* good.  What might seem like a Carlos Santana impression upon initially being exposed to his style eventually changes into something even greater.  Hey I love Santana as much as the next guy, but what Al Di Meola laid down here is breathtaking on so many levels.  One minute he's playing in an emotional kind of way and the next he's just flooring you with extremely heavy soloing skills.  The man gave it his all here and it shows (well, Elegant Gypsy deserves to be noted for its top notch performance as well).  The keyboard jam is really cool as well, and the Medieval themes that are carefully and complexly linked together near the end give this song a fascinating and bizarre touch overall.<br /><br />The title song is based around a modern jazzy piano riff but what *surrounds* that riff is the songs main appeal.  Spanish (or acoustic) guitar playing, violins and acoustic bass dominate the entire song.  Everything plays in JUST the right way.  Just the right amount of time to showcase each portion of the instrumental playing to keep your attention span in check, and just the right length overall (over 10 minutes total) to allow each theme to reach its full potential.  What a spectacular track, seriously.  That piano riff though... every time it comes around, it proves to me just how original this album is.<br /><br />The main reason to hear \\"Sorceress\\" is for the keyboard jam.  The funky rhythm is decent but I've heard the same thing on many other 70's albums such as Herbie Hancock and even Funkadelic's mid 70's stuff.  The guitar solo near the beginning doesn't last long enough to make a solid impression.  That keyboard solo... yeah that's unquestionably the biggest reason to play this song.  \\"Majestic Dance\\" sounds like what would happen if Frank Zappa's Studio Tan ever crossed Jeff Beck's Wired.  It's a fast-paced rocker with a surfing-like atmosphere and even Emerson, Lake & Palmer or Queen's more proggish, tempo-change galore moments can occasionally be heard as well.  An experimental -but highly enjoyable- track.<br /><br />The first time you hear \\"Magician\\" I imagine your impression is that it sounds SEVERELY awkward and disjointed.  It takes elements of circus music and combines it with a few different styles of electric guitar rock (such as mellow and atmospheric in the beginning and more grand and epic near the end).  There's also a distinct approach at reaching out to children in the playful way certain parts of the melody is written.  VERY odd song overall.  \\"Medieval Overture\\" lives up to its name and it's *just* as strange as \\"Magician\\" with the weird synths creating unusual otherworldly experimental sounds.  What IS this?  What kind of drugs were they taking?  Haha!  It's actually rather fascinating.  I love weird music!  The progressive rock way this song uh *progresses* is rather unique.<br /><br />Overall, well the shorter songs are admittedly rather strange and the lengthier songs are fine examples of modern jazz.  It's a strange album but a classic.  Return To Forever is just fantastic no matter WHAT album you buy!  I say buy the five Return To Forever albums released before this one and *then* give Romantic Warrior a chance.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|After all the hype, I read the book, and the next two. It's basically a hot love story. It's a little on the kinky side but both people make compromises to make the relationship work. A fun read.
B005KELS6Q|3.0|I got this, not for my Kindle, but for my new Samsung Galaxy 5 MP3 media device. It is perfect fit to protect it from scratches. Interestingly though, I have a Kindle and out of curiousity, I slipped it into this nicely padded piece and found that it was too tight a fit. Very odd, in my opinion that it is meant for the Kindle.
B007N31YFW|5.0|Now, this is the sort of film that you think, once it has ended, 'how did they come up with this idea and script?!?'. It is a very funny movie but not in that 'i say a joke...did you get it?' typical way (like most comedy movies are). Don't get me wrong. I also love 'what about Mary' and the likes. But this is something else...  it's so different and just makes you laugh at the absurdities and off the wall ideas it confronts you with. And yet, it all seems credible and like it could actually happen. It is just so very well done and with attention to every little detail. Imagine a group of musical 'terrorist' who are fed up with the town's (and possibly the world's) mediocrity in today's music status quo (including classical music). The film shows each of these character's last episode with their former employer (be it a rock, lounge or pit combo/orchestra) and why they are called to form the ultimate music group to show what music really is all about. Then there is the tone deaf policeman  (from a respected classical music family) who starts to piece together the real intentions of the group after discovering clues in each one of their musical 'attacks'. It sounds pretty ridiculous trying to put it into words. But believe me it is VERY funny and original. Rent it or go see it. You will have a blast.

B001F6TXME|5.0|Photography is one of my favorite hobbies, and getting the right shot sometimes requires multiple shots especially with nature photography.  I purchased this remote release and immediately started using it while trying to capture various birds flying in and near the subject of my shot.

In fact, next time I think I'll bring a lawn chair and just click away!  See my very first shot here as an example: [...] . It was a great purchase and a very reliable item.

B004LROMX4|4.0|This enjoyable variation on \\"War of the Worlds\\" from executive producer Steven Spielberg finds a group of survivors struggling to maintain their existence in a post-alien invasion Boston. Noah Wylie stars as one of the de facto leaders of a resistance movement intended to stop the aliens, who mostly leave the deserted suburban areas of Massachusetts alone outside of occasional patrols, but who also abduct younger humans for their own - as of yet unknown - reasons. Wylie often clashes with military veteran Will Patton over balancing the group's safety with trying to make a dent against the extraterrestrials, all the while taking care of his family, including three young sons.<br /><br />Though familiar, \\"Falling Skies\\" is entertaining stuff, mainly because the quality production values are matched with a strong human component. Wylie, so good for many years as John Carter on \\"ER,\\" makes for a perfect everyman - a professor reluctantly thrust into battle, who often finds himself reflecting on the group's predicament in the context of history - and he's matched by a fine supporting cast including Patton, Moon Bloodgood  and Sarah Carter. Fine special effects and a satisfying mix of sci-fi action and human drama make \\"Falling Skies\\" well worth checking out.<br /><br />Warner's Blu-Ray edition of \\"Falling Skies\\" looks terrific with 1080p transfers and DTS MA soundtracks. A good selection of extras include commentaries, a San Diego Comic-Con featurette, behind the scenes featurettes, a sneak peak at Season 2 and a BD exclusive look at the Dark Horse comic book.<br /><br />In some ways \\"Falling Skies\\" comes off feeling like Spielberg's second stab at \\"War of the Worlds,\\" but the series ultimately works better thanks to better fleshed out, and more likeable, characters. Before Season 2 hits the TNT airwaves this summer, newcomers would do well to check out Warner's Blu-Ray Season 1 release when it streets on June 5th.
B005LAIIS0|5.0|I, for one, thoroughly enjoyed this film, and I'm no stranger to cinema. Blue Velvet, HEAT, Taxi Driver, The Deer Hunter, The Big Lebowski, Once Upon A Time In The West- all classics in my book. So when I heard some generally negative reviews about The Grey, I couldn't understand why, considering how much I loved it ( I would periodically think about it days after seeing it in the theatre) I attest this to my love of 'manly man' survival movies such as The Edge, Deliverance, 127 Hours, and Alive- all of which have elements in The Grey. The horrified expressions of the men when they realize that nature has no pity, no feelings is reminiscent of  John Boorman's Deliverance, and the event depicted in Alive is referenced in the movie jokingly.<br />  The Grey, however, succeeds in creating it's own unique vibe. One of Life and Death, and 'the grey' area in-between, when friends can die in an instant, memento mori at it's purest. This movie is introspective, as the viewer experiences this man, who somehow finds the will to live after losing so much, truly sees what is important, can be reflected on ourselves and our lives. Although there is a certain machismo among the other men early on, this gives way to surprisingly effective personal viewpoints givin in bits as the men rest between wolf assaults. This changes The Grey from a gritty realistic survival film, to a film that functions on a mythical level to explore the meaning of life, the existence of God and the introspective nature of humanity. Liam Neeson is perfectly cast as the alpha-male leader of the group,standing against the viciousness of nature. He really is the pure, distilled essence of man, and still a complete badass considering he just turned 60!<br />  As for the ambiguous ending, those that didn't like the film's poetic conclusion missed the true, introspective intent of the film entirely. I don't want to ruin anything, but when when a movie centered on living and dying, the significance of life to us,wouldn't it be fit to leave it to the individual to decide Ottoway's fate? Not everything in Hollywood has to be literal.
B005I4JG80|3.0|Too long, imo.  The first half of the book was pretty insightful and interesting, but it seemed to drag on.  I didn't end up finishing it.
B0057UA4FY|5.0|If you're looking for a review which tells you about how the DVD looks visually, go ahead and click on another one.  You're seeing Star Wars through the eyes of someone who's been blind since birth.  How's that grab ya?  I will tell you that the show takes place between episodes II and III.  I'll tell you that it is, in my opinion, one of the best things on TV these days.  And if you want to know more then you'll just have to read on.<br /><br />  I've been watching this show since it first heired, and it just keeps getting better and better each season.  And I just love this season boxset.  You know the drill.  It's a complete season set so you get all 22 episodes.  And some 64 page booklet which I haven't had anyone go over with me yet.  Blind guy + concept art = no fun unless you have someone who really knows how to describe the stuff in vivid detail.  But I'm sure it's a treat.  Buy the set and see for yourself.  Don't take my word for it concerning the booklet.<br /><br />  Many people I grew up with detest the prequels and therefor, skip this series.  But I grew up with episodes 1-3 so I see nothing wrong with them.  And I see nothing wrong with this hit series either.  You like lightsaber duels?  Ok, there are plenty.  Space battles?  Um, it's Star Wars so of course there are a tun of those.<br /><br />  I enjoy the ground battles.  Clones versus droids seems a bit more in your face when they're doing it on foot.  But yes, I still enjoy the space battles. They're very epic and not to be missed.  I only wish that this series had one of those separate audio tracks for the blind.  Not that I use those all that much.  I think the narration is a bit distracting at times.  I'd probably watch the show without them first, then go back and turn on Mr. Disembodied Voice to get a better feel for whatever episode I was interested in.  They should get Tom Kane to do it!  He voices Yoda in the series as well as the narrator at the beginning of each episode.<br /><br />  IfI had to pick a few favorite episodes from season 1, I'd go with Ambush. It spotlights Yoda and a few clones.  For one thing, I've always loved Yoda.  He's just so wise, but at the same time he can own you with a lightsaber.  And all the clones are important to him.  To this little guy, everyone has a face and a name.  Then I'd have to choose the Ryloth trilogy.  It's loaded with action and we get to see a bit more of one of the Separatist higher-ups then we did in episode II.  And last of all but certainly not least, there's Rookies.  Enough said.  Just buy the set and see for yourself if you're unfamiliar with the series.<br /><br />  I only wish these episodes heired in chronological order.  You can watch any of these arcs in whatever order you like and not get lost, but I've always been a sucker for watching things from beginning to end.  OCD?  Well, maybe just a little.  I'm hoping Dave Filoni will release an episode by episode timeline before all is said and done so I don't have to keep consulting wookieepedia to see whatnot appeared in flashbacks in such and such an episode-- EG battles etc.  But Filoni, director of the series, is very passionate about the Star Wars universe as a whole.  So I can see him doing this eventually.<br /><br />  That's about all I can think of for now.  I could rant about how much of a blast I have watching this series, but that would fill up page after page.  Just buy season 1 and give the show a chance.  See if you don't get hooked.

B003CN4R74|4.0|I have to admit I was disappointed at first with this album, but it quickly grew on me. The first single, What You Want, is simply not a good song, and the only one on the CD I truly cannot listen to. It's hard to believe it's Amy Lee and Ev who produced such mediocrity. In fact, even most of their early unreleased material - the stuff they were doing way back when Lee was in her teens and early 20s - is more interesting than What You Want. Upon my first listen or two, the whole album seemed disappointing. I tried to be fair, though, and not compel Lee and Ev to do a redux of Origin, Fallen, or Open Door, and eventually most of the songs grew on me. Now, after many listens, I can say that this is a very good album, for the most part, and I put it in now as often as their earlier stuff. I think most Ev fans will be pleased if they give it a chance, even though it certainly is not on par with their last two CDs.<br /><br />Some specifics: My Heart Is Broken is wonderful, soaring and sad; The Other Side is hard driving rock, and classic Ev; Erase This is another classic Ev-sounding tune, hard driving and soulful, with strings and arena rock guitar; Oceans and Lost in Paradise are lesser songs, but not bad, and certainly better than What You Want. Swimming home is the most unusual sounding song on the CD, very different from any Ev you've previously heard, mostly because of the electronica component, which is pretty cool stuff.<br /><br />BTW, I strongly recommend getting the Deluxe version, which has four bonus songs. Say You Will and Disappear are fairly weak, but New Way to Bleed and Secret Door are on par with the best Ev - really great stuff which should have gotten full release as part of the regular CD. Lee's harp on Secret Door is simply heart rending. Any Ev fan who still tears up when they listen to Hello will likely feel something similar when listening to Secret Door - truly classic Amy Lee emotions all the way.<br /><br />[Slight revision: Lost In Paradise has now grown on me too. I do think it's a bit maudlin - and overall I don't find the lyrics on this album as interesting as on previous Ev releases. Still, Lost In Paradise is such am emotive song, and knowing that Amy Lee is very sincere in her lyrics makes me willing to cut her some slack. I want to suggest, too, that you listen to the acoustic version of Lost In Paradise, which you can find on U Tube. It's just Lee and her piano in a large stadium. She sings with such emotion, that hearing the acoustic version is actually what made the CD version of the song grow on me.]has now grown on me too.

B005IQZB14|4.0|An introspective read about dealing with overwhelming grief and loss resulting from the death of the author's mother.  The journey this young woman chooses to find her way back is chock full of brutal honesty.  And, as so often the case, nature has a way of helping us find peace with ourselves.  The narrative style is wrought with humor, self deprecation and just a touch of narcissism.  Thoroughly enjoyed!

1440503257|4.0|I really enjoyed just reading this book and I cannot wait to share it with my daughter.  Right now she is a bit young for Harry Potter, but once she is old enough I am already planning some great \\"cook along\\" nights.  The recipes in this book vary in difficulty, but most are relatively simple.  There are a variety of options so that even the most inexperienced or unadventurous cook can participate.<br /><br />Each recipe contains interesting factoids as well as references from the books, so that you know where they showed up in the story.  For the most part, these are not snacks and treats, they are for meals, so keep that in mind if you want to plan a reading party around the recipes.  Many of the foods are unfamiliar to most Americans (though they are common across the pond), so it is a good opportunity to expand your child's (and perhaps your own) palate outside your usual comfort zone.<br /><br />I do wish there had been photos with the recipes, as this is often the most tantalizing part of a cookbook.  I often find myself inspired to make something because of a delicious looking picture, plus it lets me know if my rendition is a success or an abysmal failure.  There is also no recipe for butterbeer, though that is easily remedied with a quick search on the internet.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|As an avid reader, there is no way I can give this book a positive review.  I usually engross myself in a novel a week, with this book I had a horrible time motivating myself to continue reading it. I kept waiting for it to grab me, I'm still waiting.  I downloaded this on my Kindel and I am so upset that I wasted my money.  It was a horrible read and in no way compares to any of the books I have read in the past. I have read numerous erotica novels including Zane, Lorelei James & several BDSM books, now those are some great reads.  Its an erotic romance the characters need to produce more chemistry, I usually do not buy books based on the hype, but this time I guess the hype was so strong, my curiosity got the better of me. Unfortunately it ended up being a huge disappointment and it leaves me baffled that it actually made it as a best seller.  I suggest a rewrite.

I don't want to write a review on every single song. I want to write a simple review saying what an overall fantastic cd this is.<br /><br />Its one of those cd's you pop in your car and just allow your inner Kelly to shine(even though you might not be nearly as good!). If you love great pop music and amazing vocals this cd is for you. If you have been through a crappy break up, this cd is for you. If you just want a cd you can sing along to, this cd is for you.  I love cd's where you dont have to skip over tracks. It doesnt happen in the music world much these days. This is one of those cd's where every song is catchy.<br /><br />Buy it. Listen to it.

B003Y5H5EW|5.0|I absolutely love the underworld trilogy movies. They are rated very high in my book. Kate B plays Selene and makes one hell of a vampire. This movie i'm sure will be just as good as the others. I cannot get enough... Couldn't wait for it to finally come on to DVD.
B0043D2L9S|5.0|here are both good product it is good for people to take the lens and camera outside. it is easy to use and make you feel comfortable.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I had no idea what to expect but I came away saying \\"Wow!\\" And we watched it again.  It is the most entertaining 45 minutes (approx) I have ever seen.  There is so much going on that it took a few times to catch most of it.  I came away with a great appreciation of everyone involved in this production.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|I like the hidden objects games. it would be really great if there was more of a selection of these games and more levels in each game. I start playing and drain my kindle fire battery cause I play it so long.
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|Everyone is ohhing and awwwing over 50 Shades of Gray but that was before this book came out. It is better written, more interesting, and not as frustrating. Can't wait to read book 2 and see where the story goes. I hope it doesn't let me down like book 2 in the 50 Shades series.
B00003CXBH|4.0|I don't know a whole lot about the history of European missionaries in South American or the anthropology of South American indigenous peoples (except for reading Levi-Strauss's Tristes Tropiques), so I cannot comment on the authenticity of the movie's depiction of the De Niro or Irons characters. Cross cultural mis-readings is a given and, since this is a movie from and of \\"the West,\\" the redemption of a nasty guy of privilege at the expense of \\"the Other\\" is also a given. No problem -- it's a movie.<br /><br />But...what a movie! This pretty straightforward story of redemption is placed in a mystical, if not mythical, visual and auditory (including its music) landscape that is really the movie's centerpiece. In a similar way, Malick's \\"Days of Heaven\\" transported the viewer through its sights and sounds -- with character's stories kind of drifting in and out of a fully cinematic experience.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|great game to pass the time. few glitches with neighboors villages but really cute. would hv given 4 stars if it wasn't for that
B007SYWFRM|5.0|the kids I babysit love this game. they are 3 and 4 and can easily navigate it and love to watch the animals walk around!
B007V5CF5K|5.0|Hidden object games are my favorite.  This one works well on Kindle Fire and I find it to be challenging and varied. I would recommend it.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|this game is the best  you will loge it it sounds awesome. it is one of the best game ever.
B006ZDU7QI|5.0|I'm usually not into this type of music, but when I was broadening my horizons I came across this album. This album provides great varieties of sounds and samples, creating a type of sound that I'm not too familiar with, which is intriguing
B004J4WKTW|1.0|Read this book if you want to be bored and just hear about a stupid circus that no one cares about and lame magicians who are ghost and fall in a stupid love story.  This was a very bad book.  I only read it because of the lame book club I'm in.  WORST BOOK EVER!  I wanted to kill myself by cutting my throat with the book pages but I couldn't because I read it on a kindle.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is amazing. John Green has absolutely outdone himself. He has once again created characters that are so realistic, you'll have the urge to reach inside the book and hug them. AMAZING book.
B001TAJGO6|5.0|\\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\" isn't a movie that is gonna be for everyone. It's a little weird with a few quirks thrown in for good measure. It's basically a love story though so if you are into that, then there is a lot here for you to grab onto. Jim Carrey ultimately meets Kate Winslet, who is the most confusing, multifaceted free-spirited woman that Jim's character has never met (until now). They meet on a train and she weirdly introduces herself to him as he acts a bit coy and somewhat defensive. The movie more or less centers around these two's story with side characters getting their small roles sewed in also. I don't wanna spoil anything major for you but the last 15 or so minutes of the movie had me in immense tears for the sheer intensity (this is a love story, after all!).<br /><br />I would recommend anyone who still hasn't seen this wonderful 2004 hit to watch it if you still believe in love! It has a story with plenty of interesting twists and a plot that keeps you on edge in places. I thoroughly enjoyed it and it is now up there with some of my favorite movies of all-time such as \\"American Beauty\\" and \\"The Lion King\\".<br /><br />Two thumbs way the hell up!<br /><br />5 full stars.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I do not know why this book is so popular. It is just awful. I wanted to stop reading it after the first chapter but my friends kept telling me \\"just keep going, it gets better!\\"  It doesn't. Anastasia is a weak, boring character. Grey does not appeal to me at all. I'm so disappointed that I paid for this book.  I cannot even believe there are 2 more books after this! Oh the horror!!
B006ZDU7QI|4.0|I recently purchased \\"Making Mirrors\\" by Gotye and I love the album as much as I love the hit single from that album.<br />Using Amazon.com is so user friendly as long as you are careful not to click the instant purchase until you are absolutely sure. You can buy something you really might not be ready to buy.<br />I love the single \\"Someone That I Used To Know\\" it really hits home for me and my daughter.<br />Anyone who likes a little techno type music you will like some other songs on the album as well. I would rate the album an easy 9.25 and Amazon gets a good 8.50 as there are some improvements that could improve the site to be even more user friendly.
B005LAIHGI|4.0|This movie was absolutely dirty, offensive, hilarious, racist, and crazy over-the-top moments. It's about the same style as  Sacha Baron Cohen's previous movies, but it's done much better. Cohen plays a silly ruthless dictator named Admiral General Aladeen. He is very anti-semitic and plans on creating nuclear weapons. He hates the very idea of democracy. While on his way to the United Nations, he's betrayed and shaven so no one would recognize him. He's taken in by Zoey, a vegan hippie, and gives him a job at her store. Will Aladeen make it to the U.N. to stop democracy from coming to his country, or will Zoey change his heart? I would definitely recommend THE DICTATOR!!!
B005HSG3VK|1.0|This product is very cheaply made of plastic and cloth that doesn't stand up right. Very disappointed that Amazon would sell an item like this thats very cheap constructed and looks just as bad.
B000002UAR|5.0|Strange as it may seem to those who weren't there, 1966 was the year when Britain was overtaken by a sort of Beatles ennui. Having exploded into the British collective consciousness in 1963, by 1966 it appeared that The Beatles had done it all. Hit singles: the band had never failed to reach #1 since 'Please Please Me'. Albums: Six, all spending lengthy periods at #1. Movies: 'A Hard Day's Night' and 'Help', both huge successes. TV, radio, tours, awards, personal appearances.... too many to count. They'd conquered America, as well as the rest of the world. There was no way for them to become more successful.<br /><br />Things changed during 1966. There was no movie. The radio shows and personal appearances dried up. They did their last tour. The magic of the four moptops had faded as their fresh young faces had matured. Britain turned to other interests- the soccer World Cup was held in England that year and England won! Suddenly The Beatles weren't front and center in the media any more. The Spring single, 'Paperback Writer', only spent two weeks at #1 and its sublime B-side, 'Rain', was hardly noticed. 'Revolver' was issued and yes, it was (another) great album by The Beatles, but we all expected that, didn't we? Incredibly, Britain yawned. By early 1967, the single that many people, including me, would rate as the greatest single ever issued, not only by The Beatles but by anybody- 'Penny Lane/Strawberry Fields Forever'- only reached #2 on the charts, held out of #1 by Engelbert Humperdinck's 'Release Me'.<br /><br />In hindsight, it's hard to believe that we (yes, I was among the guilty parties) didn't appreciate the extent of the musical development that was taking place within the band. Instead of being just another Beatles album, 'Revolver' introduced an entire new genre of music- experimental, diverse, sometimes uncomfortable. Without our even noticing it, popular music had become art. From then on, nothing was off-limits and music became a vehicle for artistic expression. The link between pop and other art forms was forged in the tracks of 'Revolver'.<br /><br />It's not my favorite Beatles album. Too many of the tracks are rather hard-edged and downbeat for my taste, reflecting The Beatles own dissatisfaction with their lifestyle as idols. George's 'Taxman' is bitter, John's 'I'm Only Sleeping' expresses his extreme lethargy and even Paul's 'For No-One' and 'Eleanor Rigby' are poignant laments from the most upbeat of performers. Of course, there are lighter moments, such as Ringo's rollicking delivery of the children's song 'Yellow Submarine' and Paul's cheery 'Good Day Sunshine' (impossible to keep him down for long), but overall the mood is negative, culminating in the thunderous and prophetic anthem from John, 'Tomorrow Never Knows'.<br /><br />Some, like me, prefer the more comfortable 'Rubber Soul' or the amazing production of 'Abbey Road'. 'Revolver' isn't the most feel-good album in The Beatles repetoire. However, no-one with any understanding of music as art can deny its relevance and its sheer brilliance.
B004R13U6Y|1.0|I was prompted to download this app while looking through e-book titles. Thought I needed to have this app to read books on my Kindle Fire.  Turns out I didn't and now I have this EZ pdf reader app and cannot find a single use for it. Any ideas?????
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game. I don't know why everyone keeps leaving reviews about not being able to close it. there are so many that tell you how. go to the stuff menu and hit options. the bar pops up and you ca. hit the home button. my only problem is visiting friends. I keep restarting it for the update but it never works. hopefully they can fix it!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie is probably our most requested at our home.  We all love the stories and my sons especially love seeing the shoot-out scenes and say they want to be policemen.  It's very inspirational and we really appreciated the good gospel message in the movie as well.  This movie is very high-quality and even non-believing family have really enjoyed watching it.  We have all the Sherwood films and they just keep getting better, although my favorite gospel presentation was in Fireproof.  It was the best explained in my opinion.
B007JRU2UK|3.0|I was expecting a lot more.  Am a Clooney fan but do not think this was his best performance, nor the best performance of 2011.  The entire script seemed contorted and contrived.  I agree with others' comments that the daughter's performance was brilliant.
0345803485|1.0|When my book club picked this book I was hopeful and looking forward to an easy read that would be somewhat fun.  Unfortunately, it was a letdown.  The book was pretty awful.  Lousy writing...more like a cheap drug store romance novel.  I am  embarrassed to say that I ever read it.  Don't waste your time or money.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Absolutely the worst book I have ever read.  The book is not well written, the story is poor and pathetic.  I would say that the writer is more concerned with shocking you than with the story.  This is pronography trying to hide itself as some kind of literature.  Don't waste your money on this trash!  There are better books out there!
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I absolutely couldn't put it down. I'm sad that Rothfuss hasn't written many books yet, because I don't know how I'm going to manage to wait until his next one comes out.
B002N57W9M|1.0|This recording was not given the respect it deserves for the 2009 remaster.  Go to 3:21 of the first track.  Just after \\"Rox you like a baby\\" where the music kicks back in, you'll find some obvious distortion.  You won't find the same distortion on the original 1991 release of the album, nor on the 2003 remaster of the single version found on both The Pop Hits and The Rox Box.  It's a shame, the sonic equivalent of brightening up a picture in Photoshop to the point of blowing out the highlight details.  I'm happy I went to see them in Taipei this year and that I bought only the tour program instead of the remastered CDs.
1451648537|5.0|This is an amazing and the most intriguing autobiography I have ever read.  I could not put it down.  Excellent.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I gotta say this app seems a little high for 2 bucks but after I got it, it wasn't regretted. If you don't like checking your battery on your settings, or want more information buy this app!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|it is fun. but it is kinds weird when people talk to you. it is fun because I get to play with my mom.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Literally just walked into my job, just opened the box. Great buy!!!!!!!! Quick shipping time, too!! No, it DOES NOT include the USB cable, but then again, who the heck does not have a mini USB cable at home? Amazon sells them for less than $5, way less than than the $30 difference in buying one with the cable.<br /><br />Never needed to contact the seller for anything. Made the order, the next day it shipped, the next day it was here. End of story!<br /><br />Thank you!!!!<br /><br />Updated: 8/20/12<br /><br />So, a few weeks ago, I ended up having issues with the controller. The seller was prompt in his feedback, and best of all, fast and efficient! Contacted them in the morning, got a response and shipped it out the same afternoon. Two days later I had a brand new controller. This is how you do good business! Highly recommended!<br /><br />Thanks!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I came across this while waiting in a drs office. not sure what i searched but im glad i found it. i can appreciate all the emotion and character flaws. I read it in a day. Ill be looking into her other books.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It is amazing what this lady  has written. The Fifty Shades trilogy is absolutely a must read for anyone. The story line, the characters, the sex, the action-everything contributes to a fantastic read. AT times it can be shocking, from the mental health aspects to the sexual action, but reading the books can change a lot of things in your life.
B005EWDA9M|3.0|Book 1 is a bit slow to start but the reader's patience pays off, Book 2 is more intriguing and hard to put down!
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I love this app although I used all 10 of my bombs on accented!!!! they should really have a system where it asks are you sure you wanna use one? instead of just BOOM! IT REALLY ANNOYS ME! :( maybe wok on that? thanks.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|After the first book, I had to buy the second. Couldn't put my kindle down. By the time I got to Book 2, I was reading on my lunch breaks and even sneaking a chapter at work when I could.
0345803485|1.0|I'm having a very hard time staying calm enough to write this because, frankly, \\"Fifty Shades\\" is so offensive. So I will just be brief: E.L. James' take on kink, power exchange, and BDSM belongs in an outdated psychology handbook. Her ideas and her characters promote a stereotype that is often ugly and sometimes downright hateful. Please, don't buy these books, don't borrow them, don't even discuss them. Thank you.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Book one was captivating enough for me to read in about 3 days. I hadn't read anything decent in awhile and this book was far different from my usual story lines (mystery and thrillers) so for me to have loved this book like I did was highly unexpected. Got me to try different genres. I really felt like I knew the characters and they were part of my life. I almost felt like I was cheating on my husband with Christian! My heart actually felt like it broke for poor Anastasia at the end of this one....I literally finished this book and went directly to the kindle store to download book 2! Well done E.L. James!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use this App almost every day. I really enjoy the listening option. I can listen as I read.  It is a great App to use at Church as well. I love being able to take notes with this App. I would recommend this App for the Kindle Fire, I pad,  or android/ I phone.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great ending to an amazing story! Read the whole trilogy in a matter of 8 days. Highly recommended! Great plot line, and believable characters. A series I will actually read again.
B007YJ8ZRK|1.0|While intellectually I understand the rationale and realism provided by a single camera replicating an individual, in most movies it only detracts from the creation of a complete mental picture.  The details that are not provided by the director are what is typically filled in by the viewer's brain, allowing them to lose themselves in the movie.  The story took time to progress anywhere, the whole time leaving the poor viewer to only fixate on why the camera was on the ground, out of focus, or the constant topic of dialogue.<br /><br />While an interesting viewpoint, the artifice for introducing the camera was apparent.  In addition, the omnipresence of the camera in any individuals life was baffling.  The concept for a good story was destroyed through the lack of perspective.
B007R12TNQ|5.0|I love the Alvin and Chipmunks.  It was good viewing quality and easy to purchase right from my tv.  No complaints from me.<br /><br />Le Le
B00773YOB4|5.0|Bonnie Raitt Can still bring it big time!  She has proven that she hasn't lost a step.  I can't wait to see her live!
0345803485|1.0|This book made me physically ill, and I am not exaggerating. I really don't know what else to say. It stuns me that otherwise psychologically healthy women are reading/praising this misogynistic, abusive drivel.<br /><br />Christian, far from being the sexy, suave gentleman we are promised, is actually a creepy, perverted psycho with some serious abandonment issues.<br /><br />Anastasia might as well be a flower pot for all the sense we get out of her.<br /><br />I just ... I can't. I'm sure anything else I have to say has already been said, and much better, by other reviewers.<br /><br />One last thought: If you suffer the misfortune of buying and reading this book, then I'm sorry. I am. I'm really, really sorry. Let me just warn you once: What is read can never be unread. Think about that -- really think about it -- before you pick up this book.
0345803485|2.0|First of all, there are far superior books on BDSM erotica out there and if that's what you're seeking, the Sleeping Beauty Trilogy by Anne Rice (A.N. Roquelaure) comes immediately to mind.<br />I found 'Fifty Shades' almost painful to read; NOT because of the sex scenes (which were relatively mild by BDSM standards) but due to the sophomoric writing.  She constantly bites her lip and rolls her eyes.  He cocks his head and his palm twitches.  Amazing how she went from total innocent to sex and wine expert in a matter of days!<br />I realize this is total fantasy so the vapid characters are forgiving but I can't get back the time I wasted (and $9.99) reading book one.<br />The only reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 is because I am now motivated to re-read the previously mentioned Roquelaure Trilogy.
0345803485|2.0|I am not one to \\"jump on any bandwagon\\" however, I made an exception for this book....needless to say I should have saved my money. As many people have stated the writing is repetitive and there is NO character development. I thought I was going to throw my kindle across the room if I read about someones face turning \\"crimson\\" one more time. Or the image of Ana biting her bottom lip....ITS NOT A TURN ON! As for those who think it is too racy- grow up because the sex scenes are soooo vanilla. I hated the character of Ana- about half way through I was just hoping she would agree to the terms so he could beat the crap out of her- something different. This story had promise, but was destroyed by amature writing and amature imagination. Not often can I say that I was GLAD that the book ended....wont even bother with the other books.
038572179X|5.0|I LOVED this book. I've never had such a strong emotional reaction to  book but the one made me scream in anger and sadness at the end. I don't want to give any more away. Just read it. it's beautifully written it makes you just feel like you know the people in it.
0440241901|1.0|The book is stereotype and cliche. Very boring to read. It's like watching a mediocre Hollywood comedy when you can basically predict how the story goes.
B0030ZOYJ0|5.0|This was waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay bettern the series and I liked the series despite the confusing and disapointing finish to that series. Own it, Collect it........ -Jult Warfell
0525423281|4.0|Lola is a 17-year-old free spirit who thinks costumes are meant to be worn every day, not just on special occasions; she creates interesting and out-there clothing in her bedroom.  She spends as much time as possible with her rocker boyfriend, Max but her two dads don't approve of the five-year age difference between the two.  When former neighbors return to the house next door, Lola sees both the twins--Calliope, a nationally-ranked figure skater, and Cricket, the boy Lola loved in their earlier years.  The pull of the past romance is excruciating for both Lola and Cricket.  The book works well as a stand-alone although Anna and St. Clair from Perkins' Anna and the French Kiss are minor players in this title.  Recommended for grades 9+ due to references to drug use and sexual activity plus language.  Thanks to Puget Sound Council for the review copy.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|I owned all of the available seasons and this is a very well written series to watch, collect and own. Watch it.... you wont be disappointed.........-Jult Warfell
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I was browsing through my Kindle, saw this was on top of the best seller list, bought it, read maybe 40% of it, and requested a refund for it.  This is not a book.  This is porn in words.  Hate me and bash me all you want (spite from bored housewives don't really affect me, anyhow) but I will be blunt and just say that if you liked it then you're a horny moron.  It's basically an R-rated Twilight except the guy has money and a big penis instead of fangs and immortality.<br /><br />Am I wrong?<br /><br />I'm sorry.  Did I miss some deep, hidden meaning in between all the sex?<br /><br />Face facts, people.  This is a continuation of fanfiction.  It is not literary genius and never will be.  When will an actual good book be on top of a best seller list?<br /><br />I can't help but laugh out loud when I imagine people with 3 kids and a husband reading this and salivating. Have fun.
B004EC5IV6|5.0|Buy this movie series. I cant wait till 'Q' 3.33 is releasesed. My anticipation builds. I have no clue how thier going to top 2.22's climax. -Jult Warfell
B007M6OIF8|4.0|The only thing that hooked me to want to watch a third season was the hooded guy in the woods with the bald, armless walkers on ropes like pets.  Very creepy and original.  As decent as the writing has been I'm tired of the \\"hard ass\\" role being passed around and over acted.  Shane was driving me nuts and now the hard ass bull headed alpha male is Rick; this doesn't serve the need for a new direction, in fact, makes me want to stop watching.  When you stop liking most of the characters, and start to grow weary of the re hashed drama (not to mention having seen enough zombies get a knife in their eye) well...But, that said I have been hooked enough to pay for Amazons mediocre HD picture and I have to admit, for the most part it has been very good with high production values.  Most series pieces lose me when I can hear the writers thinking \\"where do we go next\\" however, I do get the sense that there might be a new angle in store beyond the borderline tedious \\"drama.\\" What I hope for now is the story widening to include a much larger scope of what the rest of the world is up to and perhaps solutions might begin to unfold.  Unlike the other reviews, I don't want this to go more than a 3rd season, however, a two hour season première and a 2 hour final would be more satisfying than the short finals they have been giving us.  Who is that hooded dude who saved the hottest chick on the show?...that's what I will tune in for...and yes, I have been addicted in spite of my criticisms.
B000TGJ80S|4.0|There have been so many productions of Dracula over the years it's difficult to find any that are even remotely in keeping with Bram Stoker's original.<br /><br />Nosferatu, in black and white was potentially close.<br /><br />This particular edition was for me perhaps the best, by far, of an often mediocre group.<br /><br />This movie rises from the crowd in so many areas, the young and rising stars, the storyboard that tracks reasonably well [with allowances for Hollywood] and sets that are far more accurate and believable than most.<br /><br />The effects, the musical score, the lighting and the projections of the actors are all presented as with a fine artists brush, well done, with many layers and multiple nuances.<br /><br />The extras are also worth watching, nicely packaged and enjoyable.<br /><br />A good addition to any coillection that was delivered quickly and in excellent condition.

B00003CXA6|4.0|Gettysburg.<br /><br />Bought for the husband, thoroughly enjoyed by myself as well.<br /><br />The acting, sets, costumes and dialogue were all superb. Makeup was almost flawless.<br /><br />The battle was a turning point in American History, it really came down, as depicted in the movie, to a personal decision by one Union officer on the run up to battle. I learned a great many things by watching this movie, things I later learned were accurate [for the most part] but were never taught in school.<br /><br />Although largely a documentary of the battle and it's immediate background/aftermath it's not filmed documentary style, but perhaps done in that best fashion where it tells a very important story as a movie but still leaves the individuals recreated in it as a vivid memory for the viewer. They become again the real people that we can relate to and understand that they may well have been in life.<br />All tribute to the screenwriters, producers and directors for carrying off this very difficult task so well.<br /><br />I personally found it to be a long movie, but did it in two sittings, and still found I may re-watch it to get a better insight to these events.<br /><br />It would be an ideal film to sit and watch with any kids who are working through this period of American History in school.<br /><br />Quickly delivered and no issues with either quality, packaging or playability.
1451627289|4.0|I haven't read King in a long time, but as a Texan I was compelled. His characters were good, good tension and fast pace--if you skimmed some. Editors must just send it along, because some goofy mistakes were evident. He misspelled Killeen, TX. Over and over. He referred to Caroline Kennedy as Carolyn. Easily good have been written in half the pages. But not bad at all.

B003HE2BKS|1.0|I love rihanna but this cd sucks. Horrible. so boring every thing sounds the same. I would like my money back. I am being totally serious.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I read this book in one day, staying up into the wee hours of the morning to finish it. Then I read it again the next day. I have it stuck in my head now, so there's not much need to read it AGAIN, but I would, just because I love it that much.<br />I get sucked into books pretty easily, especially when theres some witty humor and a good romance. This was no exception. But rarely do I find myself so drawn in, that when the book ends, I feel sad that its over. At first I was glad that I was finally reading a book that wasn't part of a series, because I'm getting tired of waiting months/years for a story to finish. But when the ending hit, even though its wrapped up nicely, I didn't want it to end. You end up loving the characters so much that you want to stay with them for a bit longer. I would love, love, LOVE a sequel.<br />This author is fantastic and she has an exceptional gift for writing. I won't go into details about the book; I only wanted to gush about how wonderful, amazing, and lovely this story is. Read it. You won't be disappointed.
0345803485|2.0|I guess this book is not for me. I was surprised because it is getting so much attention but, I am not into S&M related themes and this was all that. Disappointed because I was looking for a good book to read.
B0073Q0DZG|4.0|My wife and I were pleasantly surprised at this movie. We hadn't heard of it before, but like all 3 actors. It opened up a whole new world of the bird watchers,and their idiosyncrasies. It's not laugh out loud funny, but you will be amused and smiling throughout the movie.

1401235417|5.0|I have only recently (at least timewise) forayed into comics, but I have a sound understanding of what has been happening in the DC Universe. My favorite heroes being Dick Grayson, Bruce Wayne, and Tim Drake (in that order), I've stuck to the Batbooks so far and this collection provides evidence as to why. This is an excellent jumping point for those wanting to get into the Batman series, as it has reset the continuity and only a basic knowledge of the goings on will get you very far.<br /><br />That said, I've been a Batman fan all my life, in numerous media forms, but never have I encountered a story quite like this. This story will draw you in with its talons (pun intended) and not let you go. This story sees Batman facing one of his greatest challenges ever and they break him in a way no other villain has been able to before. This is as close a genuine look as you're going to get into the psyche of what makes and breaks the Dark Knight. As you know, typically, Batman always seems to have a plan and always seems ready for the challenge of any scenario; this collection makes you feel the fear which Batman experiences when he is wholly unprepared and it manifests into something that is truly haunting. All that and it left me with my mouth watering in anticipation of the upcoming crossover event, Night of the Owls. That is all I will say so as not to reveal any more.<br /><br />The art was excellent, though in certain situations, it seemed out of place. But the justice which it does to the story far outweighs the few awkwardly drawn scenes. This is the kind of art that escalates the story into something truly worthwhile. There do seem to be some departures is how characters are drawn by comparison to what most people are used to (particularly, Riddler, in my case,) but Snyder and Capullo have made such an excellent reading experience here that they are easily forgiven.<br /><br />As for the collection itself, I love hardcovers, so I have very little complaints. Owning the Grant Morrison Batman and Robin collections, there's a shortage of extra art here, though I'm grateful for the alternative covers. As always, DC provides top notch hardcovers in terms of material.<br /><br />This is definitely one of my top five Batman stories from what I've read so far. This has encouraged me to take a step towards more of Snyder's work, particularly his run on Detective Comics pre-new 52 and American Vampire.
0345803485|1.0|How did this book become so popular? It is certainly not the most erotic book I have ever read--not even close. FYI: I am not giving it a bad review because it has racy sex scenes--I am giving it a bad review because it is horrible. The \\"heroine\\" is immature and foolish. She says, \\"jeez\\" \\"holy crap\\" and \\"holy cow\\" so many times it gets distracting and annoying. The author, E.L. James must have an amazing publicist because this book just does not deserve the attention it is getting. It rips off the Twilight Series characters and story line--and NOT for the better (Clumsy girl, re-married mom who is miles away, dad/stepdad who is kind but clueless, over-protective near stalker like hero, platonic male friend who wants to be more than friends,etc) The \\"hero\\" even buys the \\"heroine\\" a car to replace the crappy one she drives so he won't worry for her safety . . . HELLO? This is a cheap Edward and Bella knock off with a little weird S & M thrown in. Honestly, think bad B rated campy movie with bondage. YET, for all the buzz, there isn't even sex until page 115 or so! This book is beyond awful and so unfair to all the really good erotic authors out there who are much, much better.  I will NOT buy the next two in the series.  I am sorry I bought this one and contributed to the sales of an overrated, poorly written, semi-copy cat book that should probably not have even been published in the first place. PLEASE, borrow it from a friend if you have to appease your curiosity but DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. It just irks me beyond reason that ANYONE is making money on this thing.
B003MC5N28|2.0|I'm a little disappointed with the author. I feel like she came up with an incredible story, but just didn't take it where it needed to be taken. This story had the potential to be an amazing story about the triumphs and tragedies of human existence. It could have taken you to the graphic and horrible lows, and then right back up. But it fell flat. I understand that the book was for young adults, but I feel the memories were hurriedly described and could have been so much more poignant.<br /><br />One of the most poignant moments in the book is when Jonas sees his friends playing \\"war\\" immediately after experiencing a memory of real war and he is shocked and appalled. But even this scene doesn't make sense! They live in a community where you're not even allowed to say unkind things to people, and yet they let the children run around and pretend to shoot each other?<br /><br />To make matters worse, the ending made very little sense. There's a fine line between leaving it up to the reader's imagination and just not giving enough explanation, and I felt that the ending in The Giver fell on the wrong side of that line. It also seemed to have very little to do with the actual plot and moral of the story.<br /><br />I just feel like the author squandered the amazing gift that this story could have been. I wish she would rewrite it for adults and put a little more effort into it.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I may be a teen, but when I was a toddler I remember always playing Super Mario Brothers on my parent's old Nintendo from 1985. I still remember the pattern of each of the levels, where the pipes that shoot you down are, where the extra lives are. This game is exactly like SMB, except of course the Irish theme. The layout is the same, but I am slightly disappointed that the invisible extra lives and the secret pipes that would warp you from world to world aren't there. If they were, this game would have straight 5 stars from a lot more people.<br /><br />I also like the improvement in lives- in the original SMB, if you lost all of your lives you went back to World 1. On here you go back to the first level of the world you were on. If you think that's frustrating, try playing the original SMB.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I am reviewing this book, \\"Bigger, Leaner, Stronger'\\" from the view point of a 69 year old, off and on weight lifter, mostly off. I have lost count of the \\"Bodybuilding\\" books and magazines I have read over the years so I can write with some experience here. I was inpressed with the straight forward approach Mike takes in his writing. A lot of sound information on diet, techniques, staying with it, lifting plans, tips, supplements (which he has a very limited view). He also brings a lot in with bulking or gaining weight and muscle for those who need that and getting lean while still holding on to the muscle mass you all ready have. It's a fine line here and Mike guides you along the path with a complete year long program that encludes; the exercises, how much, when, etc. for each body part. His writing is straight forward so that anyone can understand the science here with either boring you and going over your head.  I found enough information here to re-enforce my own knowledge I have gained over the years but at the same time give me a fresh new direction. The diet details in themself are worth the price of this book because Mike has done the backround for you. I can adapt what he writes about to my own use. Such as developing my own program to work with lower back problems, old football knees and a three days a week lifting program for the recovery necessary for someone 69 years old. I would recommend this book highly for those wanting to gain weight in the form of muscle and for those who want to lose fat and retain the muscles you have worked so hard for.
006197806X|3.0|I don't think I could ever love this book more than Delirium and I'm ok with that. Having it take place in the wilds was interesting, I would've been bored if the setting was the same as the first one, so that was a plus. I was upset that she so easily fell in love with someone else. To me, if it's LOVE, even if you think that person is dead, you don't just go start falling in love with someone else so quickly, no matter how much you connect with them. The ending was INSANE though. Lauren Oliver knew that was going to drive people insane and everyone that read it was going to read the next one to see who she picks. I applaud her for that, it was a very smart move.

B004VMVTNU|5.0|I used to set two or three alarms and they wouldn't wake me up. I learned to tune them out. With the random music feature, not only does it wake me, it wakes me gently. Thank you for this app. I love it.
B005IXIAWE|5.0|I was not really familiar with Wilkie Collins' work, but I had come across references to 'The Woman', so I downloaded it. An absolutely spellbinding mystery work: vivid descriptions and a plot that twists and turns at an extraordinary pace, making it almost impossible to put the 'book' (well, it is an e-book) down. And, unlike many of that time and genre, it is not overtly moralistic. Delivered well by Kindle. So impressed that I ended up downloading others by Collins.
0007447868|2.0|Reading this series is like being in a bad relationship. You keep hoping things will get better, it was perfect in the beginning after all.  When the spark begins to disappear you just remember all the great moments so you stick it out. And it just drags on and on.  This book was a huge disappointment, and not just because it's the weakest book of the series so far. What makes it such a let down is the fact he took such a long time writing half a book, and spent another six years writing the second half which was supposedly already finished. Imagine waiting a decade to find out nothing happens in the next book. Nothing about this book justifies its length. Yes, things happen and sometimes it's rather enjoyable but the negatives definitely outweigh the positives by far. He obviously thinks he's such a brilliant genius author that his books don't need editing and we'll just enjoy reading every idea he's ever had in his life.  I was reading the book with great patience when it dawned on me that I wasn't rooting for anyone anymore, there was no one left that I wanted to do well, and worse, no one left I hated and wanted revenge for. SPOILER: I hated it when he killed Robb. But I read on believing he must have a plan other than killing the best characters he created. Apparently he does not. Nothing can fill the gaping hole that Robb left because we wanted to see him avenge his father and brothers. Now there isn't anyone left we want revenge on. And there definitely isn't anyone to root for. So what's the point of reading these novels? Well I'm too sucked in now but save yourself if you can...end your relationship with Martin.
B0001US62I|4.0|A dark film noir tale of a New York City gumshoe (a young Mickey Rourke) who is sent down to the New Orleans area to track down a a big band crooner named Johnny Favorite but in doing so he gets involved in bigger things which includes meeting the supernatural (so film noir meets horror). His investigation eventually takes him to New Orleans where he encounters seedy night clubs, mysterious musicians, an angry patriarch with hired goons and the sensual Epiphany Proudfoot (played by Lisa Bonet), who is the daughter of a former lover of Johnny Favorite. You will have to watch this picture closely or maybe even more than once to pick up on all the details of the clue trail. Some will say they figured out the ending all along yet I suspect that number is lower than expected so some of said people are lying. Heh.<br /><br />This film was adapted from the novel Falling Angel by William Hjortsberg. Some very interesting minor characters are included in this film, unlike many others. I really liked the couple on the beach near Coney Island, especially the husband. Lisa Bonet's controversial sex scene led to her dismissal from the oh so popular family comedy TV show, \\"The Cosby Show\\" or so some say. In her day she was a young clean sex symbol and people weren't happy when she did this picture. The interracial sex scenes may have been an issue as well back in the conservative 80s. The budget for this film was $17M but it only made a tad over that number at the Box Office (IMDB).<br /><br />CINEMATOGRAPHY: B to B plus; STORY/PLOTTING: B; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B to B plus; CLUE TRAIL: B to B plus; FILM NOIR ELEMENTS: B to B plus; WHEN WATCHED: April 2012; OVERALL GRADE: B to B plus.

0062124293|3.0|\\"How to Be a Woman\\" by Caitlin Moran had its ups and downs for me. It started out as a winner in my mind but seemed to get stuck on certain topics for much to long. Other topics didn't really hold much of an interest for me either.<br /><br />Now, to be fair, I think I'm older than the target audience. While reading it I often thought of how I would have enjoyed the book more when I was younger. Some of the issues that must be very pressing to young women today just made me shake my head as I began to reminisce about the good old days when shaving our legs and arm pits was good enough for the men in our lives. No wonder so many younger women aren't happier. They are spending all of their free time worrying about body hair and all of their free time getting rid of it.<br /><br />Marriage, kids, work, inter-office romance....I've seen it all. A case of the middle aged been there done that. But, it's all new to the younger women. They need to know these things and need to think about them.<br /><br />I do like Caitlin's definition of what it takes to decide if you are a feminist or not. It made a lot of sense and was so much easier to understand than the speeches we had to listen to and Phil Donahue Shows we had to watch in the 70's. Back when we were first trying to figure out what a feminist was, could we be one, and if we were could we still keep our boyfriends. The younger women will love this book. The post menopausal space age boomers probably won't.
B007SGM084|5.0|I read the whole Trilogy in four days and loved it so much I re-read it.  I rushed it through the first time as I couldn't wait to know what was happening and then took my time to read every word the second time around.  I absolutely adored Christian, he was so damaged and tortured by his early upbringing and I think Ana was the perfect girl for him.  She was intelligent and wise beyond her years.
B003Y74AXO|3.0|I wanted to see how long it would last before I reviewed this product.  I also wanted to see how annoying it was, how often I had to adjust it, whether it interfered with using the screen etc.  The end result is that it lasted about three months. I didn't have to un-bubble it too often but after some usage the edges started attracting dirt and failed to stick making it look rather ugly.  It didn't interfere with using the iPad at all so it wasn't annoying to use.  Does it do a better job than nothing at all?  Not really.  I removed the protector a couple of weeks ago and have had no real desire to spend money on a new one.  I think a screen protector with anti-glare ability makes more sense than this one.
B001UV4XHY|1.0|By the time  Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2009) came along, I was bored with the series. Harry Potter, this all powerful wizard was about a powerful was a wet bag at a sand castle competition. So I did not hold out much hope for this film. The film did not let me down. The film is about running and little else. The must frustrating part was the Hermione Granger assault. Hermione Granger, consistently the most powerful, came over as an absolute wimp and just let the assault happen complete with Bonnie Langford's Violet Elizabeth Bott \\"\\"I'll thcream and thcream 'till I'm thick\\"\\"  The only sad part is the death of Dobby.<br />It did not bode well for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 which was marginally better than part 1!!!!
1439127700|5.0|I consider myself quite knowledgeable on post-FDR American presidents, but I can honestly say that 90% of this book's material was new to me.<br /><br />Not only are the contents of the book hugely interesting, but the book's sequence is excellent, concentrating on one pair of presidents at the time, yet unfolding the story in a seamless and natural manner.<br /><br />A great additional read for \\"experts\\" and, due to its tidbitty nature, a great introduction for those who want to start learning how American presidencies all fit together.
B0034G4P7Q|5.0|Facebook is still a very in-the-now thing, which made this movie seem so brave.  However, when you realize how dramatic the Facebook story really is, the story will drop your jaw.<br /><br />The movie is so smooth.  The story telling is well paced, and it keeps less tech-inclined viewers from feeling excluded.  The story is a character drama, between Facebook founders Mark Zuckerberg and Eduardo Saverin.<br /><br />This movie is great.  The Blu-Ray is gorgeous.  There is no reason this shouldn't be on your shelf.

0307951529|5.0|Wanted to echo many of the other reviewers; The $100 Startup is a great book with easy-to-understand, actionable steps that you can take to build your own microbusiness.<br /><br />This book does not guarantee that every microbusiness will be successful.  In the first two chapters, for example, Chris specifically states that a successful microbusiness needs to provide something people both want and need (and, as a bonus, eliminate something that they do not want).  If your microbusiness idea fulfills those criteria, The $100 Startup can be very useful as you build your business!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I'd heard great things about this trilogy and honestly, I couldn't wait to finish the set and be done with this!  The sexual content was interesting at first and then became tiresome.  Poorly written with very little story line.  One word:  disappointing.

B0000AQS0F|4.0|The firefly series is fantastic and my 2 sons have loved watching a borrowed series. So much so that they decided to purchase their own copy on Amazon. However the cover arrived broken, and the DVD doesnt play on our player in Australia so they were pretty disappointed. I have bought DVDs from Amazon before and there wasnt any description about which regions it would or wouldnt play in.
B001I189MQ|4.0|I love this show.  Everything about it is fantastic.  It's the delivery that gives it one less star.  Here's what I mean:<br /><br />I own Rokus for the TVs in my house.  My whole goal is to make it so that my family and I (kids are still very young--although I understand that The Dark Knight is not really for them, it's the principle) are not ruining my DVD and Bluray collection by using the disks, leaving them out to be stepped on and played with, etc.  I also want to be able to watch them on the iPad for family vacations, long bike rides where they are in the trailer in the back. So, I'm getting all of my movies put onto my network attached storage so that I can stream them to any TV in the house without having to pull out the disks every time.  For a while now Amazon has had a downloader where, once you buy the movie, you can download it and add it to your local collection.  I learned, however, that you can only download the videos you purchase if you have a PC.  No Mac's allowed.  The downloader won't even work if you're on iOS.  So, although the show is great, I still can't get this to my iPad without some serious work-arounds.  Weak. Sauce.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Awesome. this game is fun and addictive . hard to pull myself away. building a community of animals is an interesting challenge.)But It requires a lot of time and too much space and i had to stop playing.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|kids seem to like it. some of the games seem impossible to pass, others are way too easy. but not bad for a free game.
B000VZFYDC|5.0|With Teeth has a different sound to it. After making The Fragile which is very complex, diverse and unique. With Teeth is less complex and structured, less heavy also and a more accessible album. They changed their genre a bit for a a more modern and up to date sound. It's still a five start album though, even if it's not as good as the last couple NIN albums. It was worth the 6 year wait for it and the production's great. It has some really great songs like Only, The Hand That Feeds, All The Love In The World, The Collector, You Know What You Are and my personal favorite Sunspots.
B008133JZG|5.0|If you like \\"Law & Order:  Criminal Intent,\\" you'll love this series.  Most crime dramas are pretty predictable.  This one isn't.  And the directing makes you appreciate directing.  For example, instead of narration to tell you Sherlock's thought process, text is superimposed on the screen to show you what he sees and deduces.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|So much fun. Absolutely love it. Well worth the money. Enjoying every moment! Give this game a chance, you won't be sorry.

B0059XTTW8|4.0|I still remember the 1979 BBC adaptation of John Le Carr&eacute;'s 1974 espionage novel \\"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\\" with admiration, so I wondered if a new theatrical adaptation would be worth the trouble. And I questioned the wisdom of condensing a five-hour miniseries into a two-hour film. I must say that screenwriters Bridget O'Conner and Peter Straughan have done an impressive job of condensing the material. Nothing significant is lost in terms of plot or themes, though don't get to know the characters as well, so Sir Alec Guinness' superb turn as George Smiley is unchallenged.<br /><br />During the Cold War, the head of the British foreign intelligence service (John Hurt) and his deputy George Smiley (Gary Oldman) are forced into retirement when an operation to uncover the identity of a Soviet double agent goes wrong. But Undersecretary Oliver Lacon (Simon McBurney) thinks the mole is real and asks Smiley to find the leak. Smiley recruits Peter Guillam (Benedict Cumberbatch) to help investigate British intelligence's inner circle: Percy Alleline (Toby Jones), Roy Bland (Ciaran Hinds), Toby Esterhase (David Dencik), and Bill Hayden (Colin Firth), a group of officers running the super-secret Operation Witchcraft, a goldmine of intelligence from inside the KGB.<br /><br />One challenge in condensing this material is keeping it coherent. There have been complaints that this film is incomprehensible to those who haven't read the book. Well, it's been 30 years since I read the book, and I understood the film perfectly, but you do have to think to follow the connections between some scenes. To alleviate this, the characters sometimes articulate what they are thinking, which I found awkward. There have been other complaints that the chronology is difficult to discern. Usually the audience can identify a flashback by what precedes it, but there is some deliberate ambiguity about sequence that isn't worked out until near the end.<br /><br />Perhaps \\"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\\" is a little bit of work to watch. I just didn't find any fault there. But every set is self-consciously shabby. There are teetering stacks of papers in every room, on every surface. Everyone seems to live like a mentally ill person, in a pig sty. Likewise, every wall is papered with a ghastly print. The wallpaper in the SIS conference room is an optical illusion that is reflected in the flawless, polished table. The color scheme is drab. It's a vision of the apocalypse, not of government bureaucracy in the 1970s. It's distracting and comical. Director Tomas Alfredson is to blame. And the ending is weak. Just the last couple of scenes are poor, unfortunately.<br /><br />But the intent is to comment on the world today, not the world as it was 40 years ago. George Smiley seems not to think much of British intelligence or its ideals. SIS' inner circle are presented as an insular community of deluded, immoral, old men chasing their tails. They seem conscious of the futility of their schemes but resigned to pursuing them. Everybody loses. There was a certain amount of that in the book and the 1979 adaptation, but the new version lays it on thick. This is not a Cold War view of the intelligence community. It is a post-9/11 view. In this way it reminds me of the excellent 2010 French film \\"Farewell\\" - the Cold War re-envisioned as a vehicle for 21st century political dilemmas.Spy\\" is a little bit of work to watch.

1567310540|5.0|This is my favorite James Bond novel. Ian Fleming created a character with a gargantuan appetite for the more worldly pleasures. For a setting that could supply our hero with such an appetite Fleming chose his beloved Jamaica. The melding of the story with the setting is Fleming at his best. Jamaica is a land of beauty, mystery and intrigue. Fleming captured this so well and gave us a remarkable villain to reflect that esoteric quality of the island.
0240815807|4.0|I have done home recording since the 1970s, so I have learned a lot recording, variously, on 4-track reel-to-reel, 4-track cassette, computers, and lately on digital recording devices. This book provides some insights into the secrets of recording including microphone placement, recording and mixing different instruments, and recording volume and balances. The author also touches on some \\"secrets\\" such as gating, pre-amping, EQ tips, and the use of compression while live mixing as well as final mix-down. Not much new under the sun for me, but this book would likely be a great starter book for someone just beginning their home recording career as a hobbyist.
0061120073|3.0|I really loved this book until it got to the point where Francie left school and started working. From that point on the novel seemed like a Disney story. Factory work is fun? You can easily skip high school? I felt like the author ruined all the good she had put into the earlier part of the book. I loved, in the first 2/3 of the novel, seeing the characters overcome their hardships, the frank treatment of sexuality, the hipocrisy of the neighbors with the pregnant teenage girl, the way the family deals with attempted rape, handling difficult issues like alcoholism and the way the author honestly described peoples' flaws. Then it seemed like the author thought that the story was too sad and had to create a forced happy ending. The part where McShane \\"proposes\\" marriage to Katie was laughable. Here is a woman that would never accept charity but then she automatically jumps into marriage with the rich guy. I didn't believe that Francie would become such a snob too and state that she would never return to her old neighborhood. I just really hated the ending.

0316069884|3.0|I like and recommend this book, and yet I am torn because I deeply dislike the author. More on that later.<br /><br />So, to the book before the author.  In the genre (if I may call it that) of works on ethical eating and factory farming, Eating Animals is an important, if flawed, work.  Anyone interested in the subject should include it on their reading list. Foer raises questions we all should be asking of ourselves.<br /><br />While this is no manifesto for veganism, it is written by a man --a vegetarian -- who is trying to prove something he already holds to be true.  Some may see that as an indication he is biased and therefore untrustworthy, but this isn't a work of investigative journalism. Eating Animals is more of a conversation.  Foer lets ranchers, farmers and slaughterers speak for themselves, even if they are presented in a context that tweaks the meaning.  He is extremely blunt about the horrors of factory farming and large-scale fishing and fish farming, while he verges on excessively sentimental (and often makes incorrect assumptions) when writing about traditional farming.  What another reviewer called the book \\"disorganized,\\" the rambling style is typical of Foer. You like or hate it.<br /><br />I am a vegetarian and was already fully informed about --and vehemently against --  factory farming when I read this book.  Someone new to the subject may find the information shocking and disturbing.  Read it anyway.<br /><br />Now, about the author and why he raises my hackles.  It's more than just one thing, but a scene from the book may explain my feelings best. Foer has just completed a tour of a small, independent slaughter facility and smokehouse, where animals are dispatched one at a time,with as much care for their welfare as can be afforded.  The owner has been gracious, open, and generous.  A woman from the office comes out with a plate of ham and offers it to the author.  Foer writes of his conflicted feelings at that moment, of the importance of \\"breaking bread\\" with friends and honoring hospitality.  So what does this vegetarian do?  He says to his kind hosts, \\"I'm kosher.\\" He lies.  And he lies in a way that puts the onus on the wrong side of that plate of ham and insults his own heritage. That is the act of a coward, a hypocrite, and an egoist.<br /><br />On a side note, I kept wondering what Foer feeds his dog every day.f \\"breaking bread\\" with friends and honoring hospitality.

B0076NAWWA|4.0|Flying Colors is a \\"supergroup\\" featuring Steve Morse, Neal Morse, Dave LaRue, Mike Portnoy and singer-songwriter Casey McPherson (the only member of the band I wasn't previously familiar with). Given the musicians involved, you might expect an album full of extended progressive rock tracks with long instrumental sections along the lines of Transatlantic. Instead what we have is an album full of shorter, cohesive songs that still display the ability of the musicians involved without ever losing focus on the actual song. I wouldn't really classify the album as progressive rock; it's more in the pop-rock/AOR territory for the most part, with the possible exception of the final song. In fact, for most of the album I'd never have guessed that Neal Morse was involved if I didn't know better - it's more of a guitar-driven album.<br /><br />The songs are pretty good for the most part, although there are no real stand-outs and there are a couple of clunkers (Shoulda Coulda Woulda is a bit bland in my opinion). Most of the songs have catchy hooks and choruses while still retaining some originality. Apparently the entire album was written and recorded in 9 days, with an agreement among the band members not to use anything they'd previously written independently; I can't help but think if they'd been able to spend more time they could've come up with a true masterpiece.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|This album is absolutely FANTASTIC!!  From the title track of Trespassing to the beautiful ballad Nirvana I can't stop listening to it!  The bonus track Runnin is beyond heavenly!  Adams vocals are strong on every song but they truly SOAR on runnin.  It's a bounus track included on the deluxe CD so please go for the gold and get the Trespassing CD Deluxe.  It's sooo worth it!!!!!

Yes, there is a lot of repetitive stuff but VERY easy to over look by the story line.
B005LAIIS0|4.0|I'm truly surprised to see so many bad reviews of this here. I for one was surprised by how solid it was, specifically because of Neeson's typically excellent performance. In fact, it's one of his best roles. Add that to a great score and tight direction and this is a chilling tale in every way.<br /><br />It's tough not to give spoilers for this one, so, short and sweet: it's occasionally very violent but it's always real violence, mostly wolf on man, and I'll take that any day over the numbing one hero shoots a hundred bad guys crap we usually get. This is much scarier, as it's believable. And it felt all too real at many moments, and that ever-present threat of (all-natural!) carnage adds a lot of suspense.<br /><br />The Grey has two classic scenes to boot: one of the best/worst plane crashes on film, and a truly fine death scene that transcends almost all other cinematic deaths. Perhaps it's those two scenes that turned folks off: they make us face a couple of very common fears, but not in an exploitative, fake way. That makes them all the more real and edgy.<br /><br />Neeson makes them work, as he does the whole film. The guy can act, and never does he feel like he's in a film. He carries it all, and this is one of the best acting jobs I've ever seen in a film like this. It starts out as man vs. man, then man vs nature, and finally it's man vs. himself. That's all of the dramatic basics wrapped up in one, and it works.<br /><br />The blu-ray is a good transfer, but features only deleted scenes, all rightfully so, and a commentary. BUT...the commentary features the director and two editors drinking scotch throughout, and as they get sauced they start getting more honest, which you almost never hear on these. Carnahan even goes so far as to say that he thinks the film didn't deserve to have been a box office number one, which is a wild thing to say about your own film. But the commentary is well worth checking out for just such moments; it's one of a kind. (I sure would love to have heard Hitchcock or Kurosawa discussing their films while knocking back a few!)<br /><br />All in all, if you like a good raw survival film, then this is your meat. So to speak...ure would love to have heard Hitchcock or Kurosawa discussing their films while knocking back a few!)<br /><br />All in all, if you like a good raw survival film, then this is your meat.

B0059XTUB8|4.0|\\"My Week with Marilyn\\" offers a compelling glimpse into the life of Marilyn Monroe. Michelle Williams plays off-screen Marilyn as a lost little girl; Williams' performance as on-screen Marilyn also seems spot on. It's easy to see where her Oscar nomination came from! The other actors are also great: Kenneth Branagh is fabulous, as usual, as Laurence Olivier--and Judi Dench, Emma Watson, Dougray Scott, and Julia Ormond also turn in great performances. Eddie Redmayne did a fine job as Colin Clark, the film assistant whose relationship with Marilyn is the basis for the film; however, the character of Colin wasn't very likable (which is odd, considering the film is based on Clark's memoirs), and that diminished my enjoyment of the film.<br /><br />The special features are rather lean--a commentary track and a 19-minute \\"making of\\" documentary. However, the documentary is definitely worth watching, as it includes interviews with the actors and director and gives a behind-the-scenes look at the production.

B003NS1JHY|5.0|Wild Wild west is great it has lots of great special F/X that actually if you think about it back in that time they really did nt have. Will Smith playing Jim West he was great. It had a great cast of supporting actors including Salma Hayek and Kevin Kline overall a great remake of an old TV series. To anybody whos a fan of Will Smith i highly reccomend this movie as an addition to their collection.

B007YJ8ZRK|3.0|I thought this was an okay movie.  The movie didn't live up to my expectations.  I just thought the story was lacking and the ending seemed rather short.  However, I think the actors did good job playing high schoolers, they even helped bring back memories of my high school days.  I would recommend watching this movie because I did enjoy most of it.  Its just hard to get into.
B005LAIGLO|2.0|Weak acting, weak script, weak plot, seen it all before, and done far far better.<br /><br />Plus, the mindless killing of all those guys during the heist kind of makes the celebration at the end rather sick. So it's fine if dozens of people die so a few crooks can get rich? Nice. Marky Mark needs to stick with his fawning talentless entourage and leave the dime store philosophy to someone who actually cares about more than just WINNING! Charlie Sheen would have fit in well here, actually.<br /><br />Not worth your time. Well, mine at least.
0547366205|5.0|This book has everything you want for an early childhood reader.  Predictable text for encouraging reading, easy rhythm, intriguing pictures, and charm.  The final section of the book makes it easy for parents and children to connect.  My three year old loves it and now describes her doll babies using the text (wrapped in an eiderdown, suffers from fevers and chills), and my 9 month old loves the expressive baby pictures.  This has become a favorite in our house and a gift we always give for baby showers.

I read all sorts of books, all the time, never romance novels, but I really don't know where this fits in.  Very few books that I just can't read, this is not even titillating, just silly.  Oh, and the emails, really?  Do not waste your money or time on this book

B005HJWWW8|1.0|After reading the other reviews I was pretty exited to buy this amp. But after charging the amp and putting it to use, it didn't last more than 20 seconds before shutting off. I then decided to charge it for a longer period of time hoping it would make a difference and it was just a glitch or something... The second time it lasted a little longer than 20 seconds after charging for a few hours. I wouldn't of cared if it would of been a 4 or 5 dollar purchase, but all I can say is that this product was definitely a waste of my money.

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Children killing children in imaginative ways. The very idea of putting this on the shelves is abhorant. To top it all a very shallow story with no plot or characters developed and the three books so repetitive one battles not to skip pages. If you are determined to read it I suggest skipping the middle book to lessen the agony.  World News has enough senseless cruelty and is normally better written.

B004I8WD6E|4.0|This is a nice case for the price, especially with the included screen protector.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Good protection for the iPhone. I like that its not stiff like plastic and can absorb some level of impact.<br />2. I like the clear non-cloudy look, which is rare for TPU. I wish I had such an option made of TPU for my other phones.<br />3. Good fit and precise cut-outs<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Stiffer than other TPU cases I've had - not the easiest case to remove. It also tends to nudge a newly applied screen protector out of place.<br />2. Its a little thicker than I'd like, but that's a personal preference, since it affects the protection offered<br />3. The circles on the back are nice, but they are etched on the inside, so they also add to the thickness<br />4. The edges are sharp. I like rounded edges better, but that's again a personal preference. Sharper edges also mean that the phone edges have a thicker layer of protection<br />5. Its my personal experience that one try with a screen protector is never really enough to get the right bubble-free fit. I ended up buying another 3-pack. They are so cheap that Amazon could have included one more.<br /><br />Overall: worth it!

B00006LLNU|5.0|I would rate this as possibly Sigur Ros' best album, maybe even surpassing their beloved 2005 release Takk. The album is composed of two sections. The first half is pretty accessible post rock, with some great tunes on Untitled 1-4. The second half is mostly ambience, not as listenable or accessible as the first half but still serving as a nice outro for the album. Particularly Untitled 7, and 11 minute long epic. This is often used by the band to close their live shows due to its build and intensity. Here, too, it serves as a nice closer, slowly drifting into Untitled 8 and ending the album. Better than any other Ros release besides Takk, and, depending on the day, their best. A worthwhile purchase.
0393088774|5.0|Keynesian economics vs Machiavellian politics<br /><br />Before my retirement I had for more than thirty years developed econometric models for business and government, many of them macroeconometric models.  I find nothing in my empirical models that contradicts Krugman's book, and found much to support it.  But I have found a naïvet&eacute; in his book with respect to the contemporary Congressional politics during the present liquidity trap.<br /><br />John Boehner, Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, has repeatedly claimed that the Obama stimulus has been a failure.  I believe that this is \\"Boehner-bunk\\", because I cannot believe that he is so ignorant of macroeconomics.  I believe that he is quite cynical.<br /><br />Long before there was Keynes, when America waged a war financed by much deficit spending, there was a great wartime boom; and conversely when there was a postwar return to balanced budgets, there was a postwar recession - a stimulus in reverse.  As Krugman has written, Keynesianism is stimulus without a war, and economic depression with its liquidity trap is good reason for very large Federal deficits.<br /><br />It appears, however, that Krugman naïvely believes that Boehner-bunk is just doctrinaire and wrong-headed economics.  But Boehner is not a scribbling academician; he is a scheming politician.<br /><br />While Boehner issues his Orwellian newspeak about prosperity, jobs and economic growth, he shrewdly calculates that obstructing an expansionary fiscal policy of increased deficit spending during Obama's re-election year will protract the current economic stagnation long enough to cost Obama a second term.  This is not to say that if both Obama and Boehner keep their roles for another term, that Boehner will not continue to be obstructionist as Speaker of the House to influence the next mid-term elections.<br /><br />But Boehner must be given credit for the remarkable achievement of having panicked Obama, our Chicken-Little President, into advocating deficit reduction to prevent the sky from falling (see Krugman, p. 28).  Today the gross federal debt is at 100% of the gross domestic product, but in 1946 it was 122%, and the sky did not fall. I conclude that Obama, Chicago's \\"community organizer\\", lacks the street smarts to be America's economic manager.<br /><br />All this is contemporary Machiavellian realpolitik: stab the American economy (the 99%) in the back, in order to cut Obama's throat politically.  But the cynicism seems to have escaped Krugman's notice.<br /><br />If Obama, the Republicans' dupe, is re-elected, it will only be due to the unlikely ineptitude of his Republican opponent - or due to Republican voters, who forgot: \\"Before you get what you want, insure you want what you get\\", namely Federal fiscal austerity yielding protracted economic depression.<br /><br />Thomas J.

I saw nothing that I felt was as desirable as this cover made for the Kindle Touch (At Amazon, except maybe something that cost more than I wanted to spend on this item).<br /><br />As to the product itself, it has a nice feel, and I like the suede inside.

B0071XO8RA|4.0|I was introduced to Wool from a website with a brief review recommnding it.  Originally, having being burned by a few other poor SF cheapies, I was worried that this could be another one.  I was very wrong.  The Wool omnibus edition was one of the few books that made me want to read it im a single day and I did!<br /><br />It is not perfect though.  I believe another review may have already said it but some of the individual books don't stand up well as singular stories.  They flow nicely as a whole though which is why I'm glad I purchased the omnibus edition and not seperately.  The story may also be a bit too cliched for those of you who have read alot of post-apocalyptic fiction.<br /><br />In the end, it was a good read and I'm looking forward to any sequels.

Others have described this well.<br /><br />But that's not the point. The point is to make all the religious folks cringe, to put them aback (not that they'd watch anyways). This film is simply amazing. Read the other reviews for details, but...DO watch this beautiful film if you can bear it. You'll be a better person in the long run...The ending is not as hopeless as some may have indicated, if you really think about it...And you will. It will marinate in your mind for days, maybe weeks. This is not a \\"watch and forget\\" movie.<br /><br />Unforgettable. You cannot dismiss this film. Simply amazing.
1583334386|5.0|I am doctor that focuses on preventive medicine. Since the medical literature lacks effective strategies to help patients change, I read self-help books in search of realistic methods to help motivate patients for healthy change. Most of these books only tell me what I already knew- People know what to do (eat right, exercise more, go to bed earlier, etc) but lack the consistent motivation to do it. This book takes a different approach. It explains through science and real world examples, why people act against their long term interest. Then it goes to the next level and provides many different strategies to overcome the most common willpower challenges.<br /><br />Probably the most surprising thing that came from reading the book was I immediately became more sympathetic to the failure of my patients to meet their healthcare goals. Next, I was able to provide them practical advice on what they could do increase their chances of success. While it it too early to tell the long term effects on the patients' in my medical practice, I have already noticed improvements in my own Willpower challenges (Procrastination).

Oh what a grand lie that is.  By the time you're done reading this review, you'll know that the Matrix is NOT original, intelligent, thought-provoking, or even that entertaining.<br /><br />PLOT<br /><br />The plot is that in a not-too-distant future, a software technician by day and computer hacker by night named Tom Anderson (day identity)/Neo (night identity) (Keanu Reeves) is tracked down by two mysterious people named Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) and Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne) and soon finds himself learning that the world he's known is all a lie and he's the one \\"destined to free the human race.\\"<br /><br />CHARACTERS<br /><br />The characters in this movie are pretty dull.  Aside from all the people still \\"plugged\\" into the Matrix, even the people that are \\"freed\\" don't seem to have much emotion or personality.  Because of this, it's pretty hard to care what happens to them.<br /><br />LACK OF ORIGINALITY<br /><br />Again, I don't mind a lack of originality as long as the final product is well-done and has enough unique nuances to have it stand up on its own.  Much like how the horrendous Dark City is an extremely uninspired cocktail of elements taken from Akira, Total Recall, Metropolis, and The Addams Family, The Matrix is an extremely uninspired cocktail of elements taken from Ghost in the Shell, Total Recall, and various Hong Kong action films.  In other words, it's like the Wachowski brothers just ripped off a bunch of other peoples' works so they didn't have to create anything on their own.<br /><br />Examples of this intense derivative nature is that with Ghost in the Shell, it's like the style of opening credits animations were lifted right out of GITS, and even towards the end of the film, there's a shoot-out between Neo and one of the Agents by an bunch of Asian-styled street-side markets that's very reminiscent to the one in GITS.<br /><br />When Tom/Neo goes through all the trouble to evade the Matrix Agents in his workplace, it feels way too much like Doug Quaid's escape from Cohaagan's henchmen near the beginning of Total Recall (Dark City would be another movie to rip off this TR element).<br /><br />I can keep going on here, but I think you get the picture.<br /><br />HOKEY ACTING<br /><br />The only actors I though were putting any effort in his roles or were at least entertaining were Lawrence Fishburne and Joe Pantoliano.  It seems like everyone else either acted stiffly or was over-acting.  Reeves is the most guilty of this, because so much of the time he's on the screen without any charisma or worse, when he's trying to be more dramatic, he comes off like William Shatner.  Joe Pantoliano as Cypher at least had some eagerness on screen and cracked the only somewhat amusing line in the whole movie, which was \\"Better strap in, Dorothy, because Kansas, is going bye-bye!!\\"  Carrie-Anne Moss felt really flat when she was on screen, and most of the others are guilty of this.<br /><br />LACK OF INTELLIGENT CONTENT<br /><br />Despite all the movie's attempts at coming off as an intelligent movie that will leave you thinking long after the movie is over, they're more like window dressings to cover up the fact that there isn't much beneath the surface of overstaged fights and tacky \\"bullet time\\" gun fights.  First, there's the rather silly choice to give the protagonists names like Neo, Trinity, Morpheus, Cypher, and the naming of Morpheus's ship the Nebuchadnezzar.  To me, they come off as loose references to ancient Greek mythology and Biblical locations that add up to nothing else other than for the sake of having them in order to make the movie look \\"culturally-developed.\\"  Second, the references to Alice in Wonderland and Baudrillard's Simulacra and Simulation don't add up to anything that will make you think when the movie is over.  It seemslike the movie uses exposition about everything that happens and with any \\"spiritual\\" mumbo jumbo so that you don't have to mentally work for the film.  Overall, given how hokey-feeling and convoluted the movie feels, it's nearly impossible to take seriously.<br /><br />SOUNDTRACK<br /><br />Don Davis's score for the Matrix is okay, nothing terrible, but nothing special.  However, I must deeply scorn the Wachowski brothers's choice to add in such banal 90's music from the likes of Marilyn Manson, Rammstein, the Deftones, Rob Zombie, and Rage Against the Machine.  They should have been much more adventurous and tried to get to use music from underground bands like Godflesh and Front Line Assembly (these bands create far more daunting music that's far more appropriate for cyberpunk media).<br /><br />BORING ACTION SCENES<br /><br />Now you're probably asking \\"Can you at least acknowledge that the action scenes are cool?\\"  Well, I'd like to be merciful in this area, but not even the action scenes make this movie entertaining.  The \\"bullet time\\" effects have been heavily-lauded and imitated since the Matrix's release, but despite the fact that I know why this effect exists in the Matrix, it just looks too silly and just feels more like a way for the special effects teams to show off their skills than to create any riveting visuals.  Also, despite the fact that some protagonists face some grave, believable danger in the film, I honestly didn't feel much tension during these scenes because of how bland the characters are.<br /><br />FINAL WORD<br /><br />The Matrix is merely a jejune, bloodless sci-fi/action film that fails at both being thought-provoking or entertaining.  If you want sci-fi and sci-fi/action films that are either thought-provoking or entertaining (both with some), check out these much superior films.<br /><br />Alien<br />Aliens<br />Blade Runner<br />Akira<br />Ghost in the Shell<br />The Terminator<br />Robocop<br />Total Recall<br />Paprika<br />Predator<br />Solaris (1972 Tarkovski film, not the 2002 remake with George Clooney)<br />Stalker<br />2001:  A Space Odyssey<br />THX-1138<br /><br />Leave this derivative, poisonous pap on the store shelves.like the movie uses exposition about everything that happens and with any \\"spiritual\\" mumbo jumbo so that you don't have to mentally work for the film.

B00633W614|3.0|Jeffrey Archer is one of those master storytellers whose books were a source of cerebral delight. Indeed sad to see him on a downward spiral. Creativity depleted?<br /><br />While Sins Of The Father (SOTF) is disappointing, atleast it is not as big a letdown as its prequel, Only Time Will Tell (OTWT). Both novels adopt the refreshing style of narrating the story from multiple points of view. However OTWT had fallen into the trap of narrating the same events from the different points of view rather than adding to the story and this had made the book repetitive and tiring. Archer has overcome this drawback in this novel (SOTF) and the novel is fairly gripping.<br /><br />SOTF's biggest disappointment is the Emma-Harry relationship. Archer has not capitalized even a iota of the explosive dramatic potential - Harry is suspected to be the half brother of Emma with whom he is in love and has a child. Yet Archer's approach is so logical, almost clinical - falls flat and fails to make the reader care<br /><br />Next, the ending. Understandable- Archer's intention in giving us a cliff hanger is to provide a hook for the third book. If done well, ambiguous endings that keep the reader guessing/ free to own interpretation are not only refreshing but also cerberally stimulating. However here it does not work - lengthy expositions in the climax indicate the story is ready for denouement, especially since most of the plot complications have been resolved by then. Witholding just the outcome of the denouement is a cheap trick - reminiscent of those TV soap operas - and runs the risk of losing readers rather than kindling their interest<br /><br />While Emma's scenes in New York - the salvos and one upmanship moves - are reminiscent of Not a Penny More Not Penny Less, they somehow lack punch. Reason? They come off more as Tell than Show - a faux pas that some newbie writers are supposedly guilty of - does not befit an author of the caliber of Archer!<br /><br />Finally there were a few minor point of view issues within the sections - again a faux pas associated with newbie writers.<br /><br />How I yearn for the master story teller of yore - think Kane & Abel/ Prodigal Daughter - fine example where stories overlapped while point of view differed - yet Archer's mastery over structure and narration piqued our interest rather smother it!few minor point of view issues within the sections - again a faux pas associated with newbie writers.<br /><br />How I yearn for the master story teller of yore - think Kane & Abel/ Prodigal Daughter - fine example where stories overlapped while point of view differed - yet Archer's mastery over structure and narration piqued our interest rather smother it!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is one of the worst books Ive ever read! The same phrases are used over and over again. When you think you cant take it any more they use them more. Both characters have so many mood swings. I know this is a work of fiction but even fantasy/sci-fi is more believable. Ana is a weaker version of Bella from Twilight. She compromises all that she believes because Christan is good looking. He is a spoiled, kinky child. Both weak characters that need to seek out professional help. To sum it up if you Loved Twilight you might like this book. If by the third chapter of Twilight you wanted one of the vampires to suck Bella dry to stop the misery you were feeling youll hate this book.
B002PNZIDE|5.0|75uk  Lola Mont&egrave;s by Max Oph&uuml;ls (1955, 115')<br /><br />Maximillian Oppenheimer (1902 Saarbr&uuml;cken-1957 Hamburg,) -- known as Max Oph&uuml;ls -- was an influential German-born, first theatre (Berlin, before 1931), then film director who worked in Germany (1931-33), France (1933-40), the United States (1947-50), and France again (1950-57). He made nearly 30 films altogether, those from the last period being especially noted: La Ronde (1950), Le Plaisir (1952), (The Earrings of) Madame de... (1953) and Lola Mont&egrave;s (1955).<br /><br />With Martine Carol in the lead, Lola Mont&egrave;s would be the last film directed by Oph&uuml;ls before his death of a heart attack in 1957. As originally shown in France in 1955, the audience sees the events of Lola Mont&egrave;s (1821-1861) life through the use of flashbacks. Male leads are Will Quadflieg as Franz Liszt, Oskar Werner as a revolutionary student in the Munich of 1848, and Anton Walbrook as Ludwig I, King of Bavaria, whose courtesan and mistress she was and who in real life made her Countess of Landsfeld.<br /><br />Considered one of the most beautiful women in film, Martine Carol (1920-1967) (Les amants de V&eacute;rone (1949), Beauties of the Night (1952), Lucr&egrave;ce Borgia (1953), Nana (1955) and many others) was frequently cast as an elegant blonde seductress. During the late 1940s and early 1950s, she was the leading sex symbol and a top box office draw of French cinema, even seen as the French Marilyn Monroe. One of her most famous roles was exactly as title character in Lola Mont&egrave;s, a role which necessitated dark hair. By the late 1950s, roles for Carol had become fewer, partly due to newcomer Brigitte Bardot.<br /><br />Lola Mont&egrave;s tells her life story as Irish actress and dancer, which also took her to Australia, in flashbacks in a circus in the United States, where befriended ringmaster Peter Ustinov masterfully leads her through her life. The use of the technique was criticized upon its release and the movie did poorly at the box office. In response, the producers re-cut the film and shortened it in favor of a more chronological storyline, against the director's wishes. Eventually, two progressively restored versions again closer to the original were presented at the New York Film Festivals in 1963 and 1968.<br /><br />There was initial criticism of packing too much beauty and too little brains in the lead, but it seems once more that Oph&uuml;ls knew how to balance it with Peter Ustinov's commenting role and Georges Auric's music. Oph&uuml;ls, over Renoir to Melville to Demy, has always had his admirers among literally all film top maker camps, perhaps not least because his females act rather than talk their roles. Oph&uuml;ls' artistic touch never seems to leave him, hence the universal admiration for the talents of a man between times and places. Great!<br /><br />75us - 17/5/2012ce.

B000I3PERS|1.0|I don't usually write reviews, but I couldn't let this pass.  I knew going in it would be a dissappointment, but the story of Scotland's wars for independence is so important to European and American history that I figured I had to watch it.  Setting aside the historical innaccuracies, the assassination of Wallace's character is worse the barbaric execution that Edward I put him through.  History reports Wallace as a knight, a brilliant tactician, and more importantly, a gentleman.  Nothing like Gibson's adulterous schizophrenic savage.  The story of Wallace would be extremely compelling without embellishment.  To substitute this garbage is a crime against history and the civilized world.
0553801473|1.0|I really liked books 1-3 of this series.  Book four was alright, but not as good as the first 3.  I highly recommend not purchasing or reading \\"A Dance with Dragons\\".  While it does...eventually...move the story along, there is absolutely no climax and George R.R. Martin seems to kill of characters at random to make up for the fact that the climax is missing.  This reminds me of the tv show \\"Lost\\".
B003MOHX8S|5.0|I bought this album based on some of the other reviews, and I haven't been disappointed. I find Two Steps from Hell to be one of my favorite \\"trailer\\" companies, right up there with Immediate and some of the Epic recordings. This album in particular has some of my favorite pieces in it - Heart of Courage (used in one of the Halo game trailers, I think) is one of my all time favorites, actually, along with Enigmatic Soul. I've practically memorized all of the songs, now, and I can still listen to those two all day. But that's just me. I highly recommend buying this album. The whole thing. You'll be hooked if you're a newbie on the trailer music scene, and you'll have a great addition to your collection if you've already got one going.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This novel should never have been on the best seller list--it is a rip off, simply meant to sell the other two noeels in the series. Makes me sad to be an author. Marlys Rold

0385474547|4.0|I read this book because I wanted to become familiar with African literature, as all the books that I have read so far were written by European or Latin-American writers. I have also seen this book in many of the 100 Best books lists.<br />The book is well written and the customs of the people of Nigeria in the 1800's are described with very good detail especially those related to the food and respect to traditions.<br />However what I think is the main value of this book is the sad ending of the main character, Okwonko, who seemed to rule his life with the only purpose of not being like his father by keeping always what he believed was a \\"manly\\" demeanor.  Sadly, I did not see any change in his attitude throughout the book as many decisive events happen in the course of his life.<br />As a Mexican I cannot keep from finding very parallelisms with the coming of the missionaries to Nigeria that is described in this book, with the destroy of the Aztec empire by the Spanish conquerors

B000002JOH|4.0|The \\"remaster\\" seems to be nothing more than a tiny bit of compression and extra bass. Sounds better than the CFH remaster... but nothing drastic ala the Megadeth remasters. I sort of wish they would have gone that route, but oh well, the record always sounded good. The liner notes are neat with band members talking about the album, similar to what they did with the CFH remaster. The DVD is \\"meh\\". Only 5 live songs? This performance doesn't capture the impact of the band, being that it was not a \\"Pantera\\" concert, (Pantera were openers, and the crowd response was perhaps the lamest ever with people just standing around) Highlight of the show was \\"this love\\" which was perhaps the best performance of this song in their career. The DVD must be 10% filled up.... add some other vulgar display shows! I hope Pantera releases more and longer shows for the far beyond driven rerelease.... but again, can't really complain for $15.

B005GSZZ1A|5.0|An unbelievable story of a Gulag prisoner born in a concentration camp in North Korea.  The problem with most fact filled books is that the authors generally are not very good writers. This fact filled book is an exception. I'm a lazy reader reaching for the book one day, putting it down the next.  This book was so interesting and well written that I completed the book in less than 24 hours on a weekend.
0345803485|1.0|I got sucked into all the hype of this book, but in my defense, I got sucked in because I heard how bad it was and then had to see for myself exactly how bad it was.  I made it as far as page 108 before my \\"inner goddess\\" begged me to have mercy on her and stop reading this.<br /><br />This book is not a novel.  It is an angry, festering boil on the backside of the literary world.  It's an oozing sore that emits an odor so foul, the stench leaves an aftertaste in the back of your throat.  No anti-biotic can make the stink go away and no amount of Listerine can get that rank and sour taste out of your mouth.  It's the literary equivalent of gonorrhea, syphilis, and herpes at the same time, burning, itching and irritating your crotch, making you very sorry you were ever even thinking about reading it.<br /><br />This is the worst book I've ever read.  And I've read a lot of books in my lifetime.<br /><br />This book marks the first time that I ever skimmed over the sex scenes in a story.  The sex is written horribly.  It's not sexy.  It's not erotic.  And it's not racy.  I am by no means an expert in BDSM, but it's obvious that the author isn't either.  The best sex scenes employ the \\"less is more philosophy\\" to allow the readers to fill in the blanks themselves.<br /><br />I have dabbled in fan fiction in the past.  It is glaringly obvious to me that this started out as fan fiction.  I've moved on from my fan fiction past into writing my own material.  This book exhibits all of the classic amateur author mistakes.  E.L. James abuses adverbs.  I don't know what the lowly adverb has ever done to E.L. James, but I don't think it's bad enough to warrant the treatment she gives them.  Maybe in her fan fiction community, confusing premise with a plot is okay, but in the real world, it doesn't fly.  No reader should find themselves wondering when the plot is going to make an appearance by the time they reach page 74.<br /><br />I have the same gripes about this book as everyone else does:  atrocious writing, weak and unlikable characters, and misusing and overusing words and phrases.  However, there are some that others haven't mentioned that stood out to me.<br /><br />1.  Ana describes her roommate as \\"looking gamine\\" and then having \\"the constitution of an ox.\\"  These two phrases are completely opposite of one another.  We all know that an ox is a type of livestock that is large, heavy and sort of just plods along.  A gamine is either a street urchin or a girl of slight build who is also pert, impudent or mischievous.  James used the ox comparison to illustrate the roommate Kate's alcohol tolerance.  Because it's common knowledge how well oxen can hold their liquor.<br /><br />2. When Ana is getting ready for her date with Christian, she informs us that her \\"legs and underarms are shaved to perfection\\" per her roommate Kate's \\"intrusive instruction\\".<br />Excuse me?  You've made it to 21 and you still need instruction on how to shave your legs and pits???  Have you never shaved before??  And what about your lady garden?  You're going on a sex date with a control freak into BDSM and you're not trimming the hedges?<br />Wait.  It gets better.<br />\\"My inner goddess glares at me...\\"<br />What the what????<br />When I hear the phrase \\"inner goddess\\", I immediately think of lady razors, menstruation products, or New Age feminist types with really bad hygiene and who sell handcrafted vaginas on Etsy.<br />Maybe her inner goddess is one of those New Age feminist types with hairy pits and the glare is for \\"shaving them to perfection\\".<br /><br />3.  Christian Grey is a sociopath.  He is repulsive, controlling, and psychologically abusive.  He stalks and pursues Ana like a serial killer choosing his next victim and he has chosen her because she is insecure and easy to manipulate.  Some people have said that Ana is a strong character.  No, she is a one dimensional cardboard cut-out of something that resembles a person.  She is insecure to the point of being very unlikable.  I have serious trouble understanding why women find Christian Grey so hot.  Are these women who find him so sexy really filled with that much self-loathing?  He sends Ana a gift of the first editions of Thomas Hardy novels, including \\"Tess of the d'Urbervilles\\" which was the subject of her thesis. Tess of the d'Urbervilles was raped in this book. A card bearing a cryptic quote from the novel itself accompanies this gift.  The quote is what Tess said to her mother after her rape. \\"Why didn't you tell me there was danger? Why didn't you warn me?  Ladies know what to guard against because they read novels that tell them of these tricks.\\"  This is creepy, not romantic.<br /><br />Bottom line.  Don't waste your time and your money on this.  It's not even good enough for lining a bird cage.  Bird crap deserves a higher quality landing spot than the pages of this book.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I bought this book late last night on my Kindle.  As a mom of 5, I didnt intend to stay up the entire night until I finished it, but I could NOT go to sleep, and could NOT put it down!!! Most books nowadays I just cant get \\"into\\".  THIS ONE, I adored the VERY real, heartfelt characters, the fast moving plot.  The author captured what a teen girl goes through, what she FEELS, and even the mistakes you make in youth. What I absolutely LOVED most, was how the author transported me back to the memories of what it was like to fall in love for the first time.  How it takes over your thoughts, and consumes you, and how your entire happiness is based on time you spend together, however fleeting, its unshakable. I loved how she made the characters innately GOOD people, how refreshing! I loved how the author really brought in family being IMPORTANT. I love how the main character was so mature for her age, and would always put her brother first, and how she respected her mom and noticed things about her.  Being a mom of 5 sons, it was soo nice to read about a daughter who helped soo much and didnt resent it or complain. I loved the main characters best friend too!  I also like how the author brings up paying attention to your instincts about people...especially if you feel uncomfortable...pay attention!!!  PLEASE read this book!  Dont pass over it, youll regret it.  Im going to buy several copies for some loved ones.  I was soo moved, and cried throughout the entire book, as soon as I finish this, Im going to buy the second one, and I PRAY this author does a whole series with these characters, I CANNOT get enough of them!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I started reading this book with the only intention of finding out what the big hype was. I didn't think it would hold my interest, but I was so wrong. I couldn't put it down. I was so interested in Christian's mind, I couldn't put it down and immediately flew through the other too books also. I would highly recommend this!!

B002BWP49C|1.0|I cringed throughout most of this movie.  Ok, I cringed through most of all the twilight movies.  Eclipse and New Moon were so boring that they were forgettable (I don't really remember if they were about anything).  This installment at least has a lot of weird and memorable things happening.  Again, cringe inducing, and some of it, just outright laughable and campy.  There *is* an element in the Twilight movies that is titillating, I'll admit that (it's one of the reasons why I feel like checking them out).  But they're also amazingly petty and immature.<br /><br />The one thing I would've LOVED (and still HOPE for) from this installment is a commentary track by Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart.  I would love to hear them bickering and making cracks about all the bizarre scenes.
B006GG1KOC|3.0|it's a good game. I wish it tallies scores and measures response time. thanks very much.<br />adults or not it's. pretty hard.
B00785P2QC|4.0|it takes too much time to click to upgrade everything. plus I wish monuments were cheaper cause its pretty cool to have. it needs different entertainment like maybe an amusement park or something. but its free and all in all its a good game. I play it all the time and some say that u cant get anywhere without credits well just play it consequitively.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this app is super cool and very addictive.  great for kids to improve drawing skills. and you can always play with random players
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|Best series I've watched in a long time. I was hooked from the first episode and had to order HBO so I could continue watching it. Action and stunned disbelief in every episode. You won't be able to walk away.
B0058VW36U|4.0|I love I love I love I love this game. I did not give it a 5. because some levels are toatly stupid
1402786360|2.0|When ever a blogger comes out with a cookbook, you can bet more than half of the content is from recipes already posted on his/her website, which is unfortunately the case with Sprinkle Bakes. If anything, I would recommend checking out her website first, and then if you're still interested in looking at the book, take it out from the library. This is not worth spending money on.
B000JJ4PDK|5.0|Released in 1994 New york rapper notorious big put all of his struggles and thoughts into this album and made it into a masterpiece. when this album was released it had quickly redefined hip-hop from just simple lyricsm into a more hardcore advanced hip-hop. when i first got this when i was a teenager i thought to myself this was the most excellent album i have ever heard. but when i brought the remastered version it was even better because  it came with bonus new tracks. my final thought is 'if you are a hip-hop fan this album must be in your collection NOW!!!!!!!!!.<br /><br />Overall<br />10/10<br /><br />Key songs<br />1. ready to die<br />2. gimmie the loot<br />3. me and my bitch<br />4. the what<br />5. big poppa<br />6. one more chance
B006M9NJFG|5.0|When I first ordered this canteen, my first thought was it is nothing more that a re-styled military canteen for kids. Well, I was wrong. This new canteen, introduced by Bear Grylls, is one of the best canteens I have ever owned. It is constructed of a tough plastic and holds more water than the standard military canteen. It easily goes in and out of it's nylon pouch, which is made of a quick drying material and is easy to carry on your belt. The canteen cup is colored orange, which I suspect is to make it easier to see in the jungle or woods and to be used as a signal device, in a survival situation. All in all this is a well thought out product and I highly recommend it to not only campers but for kids who are into scouting.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|This album has blown me away! Dancing like a crazy happy dervish to the first half and getting crazy happy emotional to the exquisite 2nd half. Only felt this way before with some Michael Jackson, Prince and early funky blues albums. For me - at the moment anyway - the best tracks are Shady, Trespassing, Kickin In, Runnin' and Underneath.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|IT IS A VERY INTERESTING BOOK, ALLOWS YOU TO LEARN A LOT ABOUT HOW ONES OWN MIND WORKS, AND HOW HARD IT IS TO CHANGE YOUR HABITS,AND TEND TO REPEAT ACTS AGAIN MAKING THE SAME MISTAKES,BUT IT ALSO ENLIGHTNS YOU, AS YOUR POSSIBILITIES TO CHANGE. VERY RECOMMENDABLE
B003MC5N28|5.0|Incredible imaginative story that challenged my notions about how far one can go with political correctness. Indeed, if the world was made up of people who looked the same, personalities would be easier to manage; but certainly, as you dig deeper there is so much that makes us unique. And one must question who are the deciders of who difference is ok to a conformist society. A great read on many levels. Highly recommend.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Game is good enough at first...even sorta fun. Then things can get a little glitchy.  Suddenly you may discover that the game closes suddenly...and when you restart it all of your energy is gone! Plus there is a weeks worth of hours added to your building making it much longer and harder to collect. HINT- If this happens to you, allow twisters, floods and fires to damage your buildings and animals so that when you fix them they will reset. I reloaded this game after level 50 because of glitching...yet same glitches happen again. What I HATE about this game is that it never stops running! A very loud bleep will sound every time you open up your kindle, some times a few times. Even with sound off! Always the reminder to play the game.  If all this doesn't discourage you then when you do play...use your cash to buy the silver axe immediately! Its the most useful thing to acquire and it will save you twice the energy chopping.  The beepers just went off again twice. The game alarm interrupts every thing you do...even reading or surfing the net.  If this were fixed and it didn't runconstantly Id add another star.  Late in the game it gets a bit boring when you have everything.  Hope this helps!
B005DOL0R0|5.0|Shortly after New Year's, I managed to find the old Kindle Keyboard WiFi for $79.  It was in the back room of a Staples (it pays to ask).  I am very happy with it.  It needed protecting.  I discovered Kindle Keyboard is the same size as Kindle Fire.  The covers on the rack that were big enough were exorbitant.  Pigs were going to sprout wings and fly before I paid almost as much (or even half as much) for the COVER as I'd paid for the reader itself, especially when the ones that fit seemed to be made with functional overkill!  Then I came across this little gem and I've been extremely satisfied.  It's simple, soft, stylish, sturdy, (excuse the alliteration) and serves the purpose for which it was needed...that is, to protect my Kindle from my purse.  It's simple enough in that it adds very little bulk to the Kindle and has no extraneous doodads or pockets to catch on things as I slip it in and out of my purse.  Mine is very well made and made of quality materials and I am very satisfied.  I got the Graphite color.<br /><br />BTW, it has no smell, bad or otherwise and the snug leather strap is nice to just stick your fingers into for relaxed but secure holding.  The only thing I would wish different is the lime green interior.  Not my favorite color, but I've gotten used to it and I don't see it much. :]
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I love how the Ebooks can change brightness, font size, and colour it makes reading fun and convenient plus its perfect for passing the time.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|This book is an excellent read.  A true Nicholas Sparks book.  It caught me right from the beginning to the end.
1400049628|3.0|I like the idea of it. but i thought this book would be a story. instead its a guide. I think they needed to make this book into a story. but maybe i didnt get that far yet.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I bought the first book wanting to know what all the fuss was about. I liked it but I am just not into the SMBV thing. I liked the story behind it. Book 2 was even better. It had more plot behind it and gave a more in depth view of the characters.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was my favorite book of the series.  It was very well written, and the plot was exciting from start to finish.
B005PTYOTE|5.0|Everyone has their opinion about the movies, but this is about the set. It was under $20 for all three movies. They all came in their own case and can be displayed inside or out of the box. That is what I liked best. I have purchased other gift sets with multiple movies all in one case. I like the individual cases myself. Great product.
B000I0XLYO|4.0|Truly a funny movie, my wife and daughter loved it. ben stiller is funny soon to be a classic movie.
B007LNJ3YS|5.0|Upon first listen, Bloom does not have the instantly memorable hooks and intimate/tender ballads which gave Teen Dream its universal appeal and acclaim. Teen Dream had more daytime moments whereas Bloom, evident on its iconic black cover, has more nocturnal moments. However, the band has crafted a rarity for today: a true album, a song cycle structured into 4 distinct sections, meant to be listened to as a single entity.<br /><br />Bloom is best appreciated in its original format--on vinyl.<br /><br />The artwork seems to mirror each of the 4 suites in subtle ways.<br /><br />The first suite features a picture of cars driving on a highway during twilight.<br /><br />&quot;Myth&quot; opens the gates of the album with a twinkling keyboard melody and pulsing beat, watching the stars rise on a spring/summer night and wondering about our origins.<br />&quot;You see the road you're on.&quot;<br />&quot;What comes after this momentary bliss?&quot;<br />&quot;Materialize or let the ashes fly.&quot;<br /><br />Out of the ashes of &quot;Myth&quot;, what sounds like the vapor trails of an airplane passing by in the evening air, emerges &quot;Wild&quot; with a buzzing, faintly sinister drone fading into static percussion and sleek keyboards/guitar glimmering like the neon lights of cars at night.<br />&quot;That's when the car pulls up/Its hood is black and gleaming.&quot;<br />&quot;The earth is wild/We've got no time.&quot;<br />&quot;Can I believe in how the past is what will catch you?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Lazuli&quot; begins with a video-game sounding synth line before blooming into<br />Celtic-tinged New Age wordless choral vocals. The song lifts off into the night sky by the end, driven by the keyboard arpeggios and percolating percussion.<br />&quot;In the blue of this life/Where it ends in the night...&quot;<br />&quot;Make us suffer like no other.&quot;<br />&quot;Like no other you can't be replaced.&quot;<br /><br />The second suite features a picture of a silhouetted face in a bedroom (maybe Victoria's?)<br /><br />Birds electronically altered beyond recognition fly above the introduction of<br />&quot;Other People&quot;. Victoria sings a refrain concerning the missed connections and failed communication of the modern age, a clear-eyed observation of the generation of online dating, Facebook, and the numbness we manufacture in our digital personalities.<br />&quot;It's your world. Why would you fake it?&quot;<br />&quot;Other people want to keep in touch/Something happens and it's not enough.&quot;<br />&quot;Was it ever quite enough?&quot;<br /><br />The birds are clearly heard at the end of &quot;Other People&quot; as it fades out into the mysterious whispering and sudden start of &quot;The Hours&quot;, the slide guitar of Alex insistent beneath the fuzzy guitar/bass beat. This suite is more introspective than the first as Victoria's lyrics reveal the dark side of the album's title and relive the bittersweet taste of unrequited love.<br />&quot;Violence in the flowers where they found you.&quot;<br />&quot;Frightened eyes looking back at me/Change your mind/Don't care about me.&quot;<br />&quot;You say it isn't real.&quot;<br />&quot;It's deeper than you and me/It's farther than we could be.&quot;<br /><br />A brooding organ begins &quot;Troublemaker&quot; as the figure sitting in the shadows of the lonely bedroom opens the window and calls to the ghosts of her dreams.<br />&quot;Like a hand you reached out to me/Thunder rolls in with the dark....&quot;<br />&quot;The walls are shaking from within.&quot;<br />&quot;Watch it unravel you pulling everything apart.&quot;<br />&quot;Do you cry out in your sleep?&quot;<br />&quot;Pull me under.&quot;<br /><br />The third suite features a picture of trees slowly illuminated by the sunrise.<br /><br />Summer cicadas whir as airy, melancholy choral vocals herald the dawn of the<br />&quot;New Year&quot;. The morning (mourning?) lyrics feel lost in time as another year passes by andthe bloom of youthful promises has long faded away. Yet the melody is hopeful and yearning.<br />&quot;I keep these promises.&quot;<br />&quot;All you ever wanted/Is it getting away?&quot;<br />&quot;Write it in a letter/On the page/It's your own way.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Wishes&quot; is a childlike confession--a delicate and gentle keyboard melody over which Victoria sings of the lingering sadness and lost innocence of one's first love which never seems to come back after the jaded experience of break-ups and breakdowns.<br />&quot;One in your life/It happens once and rarely twice.&quot;<br /><br />The fourth and final suite features a picture of heavenly clouds which also undulate like the turbulent waves of the ocean.<br /><br />&quot;On The Sea&quot; is the most powerful track on the entire album (that is, next to closer &quot;Irene&quot;) and I'd humbly nominate it as my favorite track Victoria &amp; Alex have yet composed. It's so spacious--the most epic and cinematic song the two have ever created. A melancholy piano ballad (as was the penultimate track &quot;Real Love&quot; on Teen Dream) which slowly surges into a swooning and haunting bliss-out with Alex's otherworldly guitar textures, Victoria's carnival organ, and the guest viola of Joe Cueto sounding like a miniature orchestra conducting a waltz for the end of the world. The song gradually fades into the ebb and flow of the tides.<br />&quot;Wouldn't you like to know/How far you've got left to go?&quot;<br />&quot;Heart is full and now it's spilling/Barreling down the steps/Only a moment left.&quot;<br />&quot;The world becomes and swallows me.&quot;<br /><br />With your head reeling, ears spangled, and heart swelling, the band soar into the stratosphere on closer &quot;Irene&quot;, with Victoria Legrand's hypnotic organ/piano setting the near-death experience atmosphere. Alex Scally's cloudburst guitar and Daniel Franz's drums hammer out an ascending rhythm which blossoms at last into an ethereal lift off into an angelic afterlife.<br />&quot;It's a strange paradise.&quot;<br /><br />Bloom is Beach House at their poetic peak and it is the Album of the Year.the bloom of youthful promises has long faded away. Yet the melody is hopeful and yearning.<br />&quot;I keep these promises.&quot;<br />&quot;All you ever wanted/Is it getting away?&quot;<br />&quot;Write it in a letter/On the page/It's your own way.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Wishes&quot; is a childlike confession--a delicate and gentle keyboard melody over which Victoria sings of the lingering sadness and lost innocence of one's first love which never seems to come back after the jaded experience of break-ups and breakdowns.<br />&quot;One in your life/It happens once and rarely twice.&quot;<br /><br />The fourth and final suite features a picture of heavenly clouds which also undulate like the turbulent waves of the ocean.<br /><br />&quot;On The Sea&quot; is the most powerful track on the entire album (that is, next to closer &quot;Irene&quot;) and I'd humbly nominate it as my favorite track Victoria &amp; Alex have yet composed.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|I bought this book to read after seeing all the stories on the the news about it.  From the news, I thought it would be really racy.  I haven't bought paperback fiction in literally years, probably since Bridget Jones (was that over a decade ago?).  Holy cow has the quality of the book itself gotten terrible.  It is floppy and you can almost see through the pages.<br /><br />To me, the content in the book did not live up to the reputation it has gained in the media.  Sure, there are a lot of sex scenes, but they aren't really that much more exciting than the \\"bodice rippers\\" I was checking out at the library 15-20 years ago.  There are just more of them.  The characters don't do anything particularly groundbreaking in the nookie department.<br /><br />Considering how much the f-bomb was dropped, I found it weirdly conservative when referring to the man- and lady-parts.  Not once were even the actual names of the organs used, or any of the myriad common slang terms.  Instead, terms like \\"my sex\\" and \\"down there\\".  Seriously, does a grown woman in this day and age refer in her head to that area as \\"down there\\"??  Even the derriere is referred to as behind or rear but never ass.  Come on!<br /><br />Couple more things (I know its fiction and I should suspend disbelief):<br /><br />What is the deal with Audi and Converse - did they sponsor it or something?  What worldly man walks around in Converse shoes all the time in 2011?<br /><br />Ana is supposed to be poor, but she books a flight from Portland to Georgia like 2 days in advance.  That ticket costs an absolute fortune!  Even months in advance it is ridiculously expensive.<br /><br />How many \\"beautiful\\" college seniors are there who don't have a particular principle that kept them from having sex who never hooked up?<br /><br />Oh for a man who just wants you to lay there while he makes sure all your needs are fulfilled - no wonder the book is so popular.  ;)<br /><br />All that said, it was a quick fun read, but Idon't really understand the extreme popularity.
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|I heard the entire album on Serious-XM radio before it was released. All the songs are great! Absolutely worth a listen.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a real reading application. It would be even better if it supported offline reading plans... But otherwise fantastic.
0385338082|4.0|Good book...kind of a silly story but I found it difficult to put down...just a really easy read & kept me interested until the end.  My first time reading Sophie Kinsella - will read another book from her soon. I would say this is a good summer book.  I did enjoy it.
1584282584|5.0|I don't know where you got your 'flash education' from, but mine was a bit haphazard because flash pictures didn't play a big role in the kind of pictures I took.<br />You can probably see where this is going with not the right and enough information and the right equipment it's a recipe for frustration.And when you find yourself with a flashes that also have off-camera capabilities it just compounds the 'problem'. Then I ran across Joe McNally's books , inspirational text and style of writing but still,to my mind, a bit haphazard.<br /><br />Recently I got hold of Neil's books and it was like the sun started to shine through the fog.Everything fell into place and started to make sense.Intelligent talk at the right level ,like he was standing next to you. Ideally you should start with this book first and then move on to his 'Off-camera flash' book. Best money I ever spent on flash equipment. If you have a love-hate relationship with your hot-shoe flash and you are done with all the frustrations, get these books. Admittedly he uses professional Canon and Nikon flashes but you cannot fail to walk away from his books and see the sun shine.
B0033B5XCS|4.0|The quality of these movies is ambiguous, but the quality of the discs themselves is good.<br />\\"A Nightmare On Elm Street\\" - Being the original movie, it's pretty good. Heather Langenkamp as Nancy does a great job, and Robert Englund's Freddy is at his creepiest. Easily the most scary of all the movies, with some of the scariest death scenes!<br />\\"Freddy's Revenge\\" - I know most people hate this movie, and Jesse Walsh isn't the best protagonist around, easily the most boring in the series, even if he is gay. Lisa Webber, the girl across the road, isn't great either. But I give the movie kudos for playing with some unusual ideas, and the pool party massacre was pretty funny.<br />\\"Dream Warriors\\" - One of the best. Kristen Parker isn't my favourite heroine, but it was nice to have Nancy back, and the kids' fear of sleeping was emphasized brilliantly. Also notable for being around the time Freddy became a wise-cracking joker, with the infamous line \\"Welcome to prime time, bitch!\\" Poor Jennifer.<br />\\"The Dream Master\\" Lisa Wilcox does a great job as Alice Johnson, easily the best heroine since Nancy. It's interesting to see her take on the powers of each character who dies (Quotes Kristen \\"We have matching luggage\\" and smokes, quotes Sheila's motto \\"Mind over matter\\", uses Rick's weapons, etc). Underrated.<br />\\"Dream Child\\" - Easily the worst in the series, but kudos for the death scenes, even though the body count is much lower than in the last film. Dan and Greta's deaths - painful. I still feel sick every time I watch Greta. And Mark's death is appropriately funny.<br />\\"Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare\\" - Just the background earns some points. Maggie Burroughs is a pretty good character to take on Freddy, and appropriate - his daughter being the one to kill him.<br />\\"Wes Craven's New Nightmare\\" - An interesting idea. I like it that they have Heather Langenkamp (Nancy), Wes Craven, Robert Englund (Freddy), John Saxon (Lt Thompson), and even Tuesday Knight (Kristen Parker) and Nick Corri (Rod Lane).<br />I haven't looked at the documentary, but I can assure you that this disc set is worth buying.
0345803485|2.0|This whole book could have been in 100 pages! The hero is a wealthy young business man who is a control freak with a dark past. Mentally messed up people do not get over their issues that fast. He has some ground rules that he never breaks like just sleeping in bed, having a girlfriend, making love, having vannilla sex, staying over, etc. And yet there is no internal conflict to make him fight these urges. He just automatically changes himself for her and act like OH SNAP these are so many firsts for me. LITERALLY he would wake up the next day and was like wow never done that before! REALLY?!You're just gonna do all these intimate (aside from sex) and caring things that you've never shown or done to anyone else so fast and so effortlessly? The female is a 21 year old virgin who cries and is so unhappy with the relationship yet relents. She's like wow you're too hardcore I don't know about this and then says OKAY I'LL AGREE TO BE UR SUBMISSIVE S E X SLAVE. Then cries when he spanks her and has to run away cause it's too intense. But then comes back and takes it some more. I can't stand wishy washy people like THEM! The ending of the book is not satisfying at all!!! The whole book was so damn slow and the ending should have been 1/3 of the book. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because there is something that keeps me reading. I don't know what but I kept on hoping it would get better.
B008011XQQ|5.0|I grew up listening to Santana.....my brother was a fan of his since day one....which is more than 40 years that I have been listening to him as well! I have every album/cd he has ever released, and I have to say this one, Shape Shifter, is definitely in my top three (if not my absolute favorite)! Of course I bought it immediately, and love every song!  I can honestly tell you I rarely like an entire cd, but this one is awesome! Some of the songs are classic Santana, but ALL are so perfectly blended! Carlos never ceases to amaze me with his musical genius, but this time, I have to say he has reached above and beyond in creating a masterpiece! This is absolute perfection.....Carlos at his best! I highly encourage anyone considering purchasing this to not hesitate..it is worth it!
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|Perfect funktastic glitter drenched urban love fantasy, mixture of thumping fat club bass and fantastic ballads, all song with Adam\\"s searing vocal missile of a voice.  This is exactly what I wanted from him...he sounds like no one else, yet is very accessible.....he never looses his renegade edge, but does not shy from populist pleasing songs.  A tour de force from an immensely talented young man.  Great fun, and surprising emotional depth make this a must have album for 2012.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I have an ipod and a kindle fire this version rocks but Pol say the other version sucks. on kindle fire u can send messages also it rocks I loveeee it :)<br /><br />:)
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|Don't waste your time or money on this unrelentingly violent and depressing movie. There is no letup in the carnage depicted, only death and hopelessness. No happy ending!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Have always enjoyed this game and this one runs smoothly. Love it!<br />Can only recall one ad that is @ start of each game but easy to click away and it's gone!
B005UBNL0A|1.0|I order two of these and neither of them worked. I also brought both of them to a computer shop along with all the rest of my PC to double check and i ended up getting a refund on both with no problem at all. I may update because i am actually building a PC for a friend so i may try this out
B0083GPDBO|2.0|The premis was there. Very Akira-esque in its potential direction. This movie could have been something great, but instead we were treated with horrible camera work and a story that didn't know where to go.  Is it worth renting? That all depends on whether you're up for something good, or desperate for something to watch. Aim to be on the latter side and you may find this movie tolerable.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book really builds on the first one, you will not regret getting this book one minute, one of my favorite books in a while.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|Good looking and works great with my Apple TV. It does not work though unless you can switch your source to PCM audio. My LG HDTV optical outputs only the source format wihich is Dolby for over the air broadcasts.
B007R12TNQ|5.0|This was a cute movie full of bright colors , music and a story line a 4 year old could follow.  Made overnight at Grandma's so much more fun!
B00571F26Y|4.0|I heard about the book from a friend I purchased it and went off wheat as im reading .I have lost 8-10 lbbs in the last 2 weeks. I have to take some blood work this week so I will see if there are any other changes.
B007R12TNQ|3.0|First of all I am a senior citizen. I have been an Alvin follower since Alvin and the Chipmonks came out. My son happened to get a record player that Christmas and he would play Alvin over and over again. Nearly drove me nuts. So you see the Chipmonks have a special place in my heart. This sequel was just okay. My favorite is Theodore. I am an old softie.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is a fun game for any member of the family. My kids all enjoy playing. You progress pretty quickly to new levels so it doesnt get boring.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game.  it was really really really reallly fun.  I really enjoy it.  it is sk fun. I love it
1401235417|5.0|This is a great graphic novel to pick up if you've never read a Batman comic or if you've been reading for 25 years (like myself!)  This is one of the all time best Batman stories I've ever read, full of strong character development while putting a new spin on the Batman mythos.  This truly puts Batman up against a new level of villains which is pretty impressive when you think about Batman's already highly developed and quite impressive rogues gallery.  This is a great story one I would highly recommend to anyone who is a fan of amazing storytelling, incredible art and of course, Batman!!
B007BLCGNU|4.0|The name J.Edgar Hoover has been around for quite a while. I knew his name but nothing much about his life. I thought this movie was well done. It is a biography of the man and the acting was excellent. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a great trilogy. It draws you into their world of hunger and poverty. I think of it as more of a love story. It is a good story for all ages.
0345803507|5.0|The Fifty Shades Trilogy is fantastic. Great love story. Can't wait to read them all again! I am passing them around now and am suggesting everyone one to get a copy.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|Arrived in short time and well packaged. CD was like new as promised. I love the series and was great to view it in its entirity. Great price
B00785P2QC|3.0|It was good I enjoyed it I don't like the goals wish it had a sand box option I recommend it
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Okay, I give. I confess I succumbed to temptation and bought Fifty Shades of Grey and for the first couple of chapters wondered what all the fuss was. The next few chapters, whoa nelly I pulled out my fan, hot flashes here. Hadn't read a book this steamy in quite a few years, or so I thought.<br /><br />Then the breaks went on. Bummer, I hit just about the three quarter mark and repetition set in. I found myself skimming. Some reviewers have been critical of the author for simplistic writing. If the criteria, for writing a best seller was complicated prose, they would be few and far between. The writing is simple and nothing fancy so that appeals to the masses, with that I have no problem.<br /><br />However, there are parts of the story that lack believability and not the BDSM. I had trouble with the MC. She lacked it for me.<br />Plus, I know this is part one of a trilogy but I hate cliff hangers. Sorry, if that ruins the book for others but be warned. Although I may be in the minority<br />I can only give this book 3 stars. It was hot in places, fun to read but not worth $9.99! JMHO
B005VU9LVI|5.0|[[ASIN:B005VU9LVI Traffic (The Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray]]]<br />The movie is great but watching it on the criterion bluray version makes it so much better.  Highly advised!
B005NKGEP2|3.0|This book was a good debut by Chris Pavone. That being said I don't think it completely lives up to all the hype surrounding it. It wasn't the best thriller that I have read but it was still quite interesting. The main mystery in this book was pretty easy to solve early on in the book but there were other twists thrown in the book that I didn't seem coming which kept me interested in the story. Overall it was a good book and I look forward to reading more of Pavone's work.
B00004Y6OA|4.0|Van Halen<br /><br />Women and Children First<br /><br />This is a very good album from 1980.  Although it falls short of being a classic, I can't imagine anyone regretting the purchase of this Rocking album.  This one has the hit \\"And the cradle will rock\\".  A solid Four Star release.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This Bible is very good I encourage to take it and spend time reading Gods word with and device you have.
B005LAIGPA|3.0|good teen age movie for the dumb and young, does have some kind of geniues but now days why make movies like it a art or painting ,it's entertainent good entertainment not create some corn ball stuff.
B000IZ6URY|5.0|My personal top 10, so I was very happy to find it on Amazon Prime.  If you don't like this movie, you've probably always voted and/or never smoked pot (exceptions, of course).  Among many other things, they do a great job of making fun of every American action blockbuster (hence the poor script and excessive explosions).  Trey and Matt sweat the details.<br /><br />Best enjoyed by the people who see the far right and far left as equally ridiculous and hilarious.  Just different brands of crazy, silly, BS.
B005LAIIS0|4.0|\\"Once more into the fray... into the last good fight I'll ever know. Live and die on this day... live and die on this day.\\"<br /><br />That poem comes from THE GREY, the new adventure film starring Liam Neeson and reteaming him with his A-Team director Joe Carnahan, and in it's this statement of glory and sacrifice that lies the secret to why this movie works so well. Not told as a violent potboiler, as we have so often come to expect, that I dare say we accept, this is a story driven by characters with personalities and back stories, all driven in their quest to survive and helping their fellow survivors. This isn't just an action spectacle, it is an adventure and as such, it is a movie to cherish.<br /><br />The film, as you probably already know, takes place in Alaska and follows the plight of 8 men who survive an airplane crash. Armed with little more than the clothes on their backs, they must rely on one another as they seek refuge. Coming at them are not just the elements that could easily kill a man, but also a pack of angry wolves, who feel that their habitat has been violated and their for, they must destroy the invaders.<br /><br />Carnahan is a good director, with the exception of his underrated 2002 film [[ASIN:B00008YJDK Narc]], he hasn't up to this point shown himself to be much more than a technician, however. On THE GREY, he finally delivers on the promise of his earlier film, working from a script co-written by Carnahan and Ian Mackenzie Jeffers, based on Jeffer's story, this is riveting storytelling of the first order. Enhanced thanks to expert cinematography from Masanobu Takayanagi. Neeson is at his best in years, finally stepping away from the generic action pics that have started to define him. Also their is fine supporting work from Dallas Roberts and Dermot Mulrooney, among others. This is one thrill ride that delivers the goods, you don't want to miss this one.
B0079IEPHA|5.0|I rarely write reviews on here, so when I do, it means I love whatever it is. I bought the season last week and I finished it just now.  Let me just say that I cannot WAIT for the season 2.  A must watch show for sure! If you are questioning it, just get it. It's worth every penny!

B001E57SH8|4.0|Wanted a nice butane torch lighter and this is definitely it. Works well if you read the instructions on holding the button down for 2 seconds before you light it. A little difficult to refill but not too bad with the little fuel level window.
B007CBEO20|4.0|BEFORE I BEGIN, I ASK YOU TO FORGET &quot;THAT SONG&quot; AND ANY OTHER PRECONCIEVED NOTIONS YOU MAY HAVE ABOUT THIS BAND, AND READ WITH AN OPEN MIND. Since their reunion in 2004, Europe have produced 3 very different, but very uneven albums, the last, 2009's 'Last Look at Eden' was the strongest of the 3 but still didn't fully achieve the sound they clearly were trying to achieve. Of course, the band's first 2 albums the self titled debut 'Europe', and the far more developed 'Wings of Tomorrow' showed signs of the hard, classic, blues based band they could be. Then came 'The Final Countdown' and the title song which is probably playing on at least 483 radio stations as you read this and is now playing in your head. (Sorry, I had to, it's too easy.) While incredibly dated, the album was, and still is, a classic 80's album. Bombastic, produced to a mirrored finish, with well written, hook filled songs performed by great musicians. At this point Guitarist John Norum left the band, and for me, the next 2 albums suffered from it. Norum rejoined for the 2004 reunion, and as mentioned, the resulting 3 albums were hit and miss.<br /><br />Last year I began reading about the progressions of this album and watching the online clips the band shared about the making of the album. As a longtime fan, I liked a lot of what I heard, and loved in interviews the band all said they wanted to make an album that was a return to the original sound of the early albums. Reviews started appearing online, all hailing 'Bag of Bones' as the band's best ever. In fact I had yet to read a negative review before FINALLY recieving my import copy 2 days ago. I had heard the lead single and it only heightened my expectations. So many albums disappointed me in recent years, so when I popped the CD for the first time I really had high hopes. So did &quot;Bag of Bones&quot; live up to expectations? No..it exceeded them! This album is all it was hyped to be and more! 11 songs (12 on the Japanese import version. &quot;Beautiful Disaster&quot;, the extra track on the import is KILLER!) that are all killer, no frills, straight up, Classic, blues based PURE ROCK tracks. The Songwriting is brilliant as there's not a bad song among them. Make no mistake, this is still Europe, just an older more mature version. Joey Tempest can still wail, and he sounds better than ever. One of rock's greatest singers showing he's only getting better with age. Mic Michaeli's keyboards are more previlant here than on the last 3 but they compliment the songs perfectly without overpowering them. John Leven is steady as always and Ian Haugland, forever one of rock's underappreciated drummers finally gets his due here. But 'Bag of Bones' is truly John Norum's album. The riffs are instantly memorable and his solos are mindblowing. I have a lot of his solo work and all the Europe CD's, and without question this is the best he's ever been. If you're a guitar fan, check out his solo on the opener 'Riches to Rags'. Truly amazing, as is all his work on this album. Besides Norum and Tempest, the songs are the true stars here. All of them featuring the hooks that have been mostly absent since the reunion, while maintaining a more classic rock vibe. Highlights are the first single, 'Not supposed to sing the Blues' with it's memorable riff, strong vocals, and very lyrically strong, 'Firebox' which has an almost &quot;Kashmir&quot; vibe and a great hook, The title track with the best chorus on the CD and a tremendous vocal performance by Tempest, 'Doghouse' is a straight up catchy rocker, and the closer, 'Bring it all Home' a ballad not about love or a failed relationship, but an introspective look back on life. A truly beautiful, timeless song that is my favourite song on the CD.<br /><br /> All the directions Europe's tried the past 3 albums comes to fruition on 'Bag of Bones&quot;. The blues influence is so evident and well executed here, while still allowing them to maintain thier sound. The mix isalso great, so put the Headphones on and crank it up. The band is in fine, tight form here, most of the songs done as live takes, which, despite the crystal clear production, stll gives some of the songs like 'Drink and a smile' and 'My Woman, my friend' a chance to still have a raw feeling. If you're expecting 'The Final Countdown' you'll be disappointed at first. But if you want a straight up, no frills, blues rock album, this is it. Please, Please, buy this album and listen to it without bias, and you'll find an album that's easily a contender for best album of 2012. You will NOT be disppointed, it's the absolute best work from a talented, mature band that has too long been unfairly judged by one song, and this may be one of the best purchases you'll ever make. It's THAT good. Yeah, I kinda can't believe it either.also great, so put the Headphones on and crank it up.

B001230JXC|5.0|I absolutely LOVE it! His voice and the music couldn't be more perfect. I had only heard Personal Jesus on the radio recently before buying this. I hate I've missed out ( I'm 54). You won't be disappointed.
1439102732|1.0|Having read several of her books, and heard her speak on more than one occasion, I know Picoult is an accomplished writer and well-educated woman.  I think the problem with Sing You Home, is that she lost her ability to project as unbiased.  She has a gay son and gay best friend, and it seems she set out to write a story that would honor them.  She chose her best friend to write a song to accompany the book and tour with her.  Being so close to the topic, and having no doubt witnessed their troubles first hand, clouds Picoult's perspective and presents a flat, one dimensional side.  As a Catholic and Christian, I just don't think she portrays Christians fairly and accurately.  I was just so disappointed in the book.
B007URCTOG|2.0|I love romances but this was sooo boring I could not wait till it ended, normally I watch the movie rental a few times before my time is up not this one, once was painful enough. Both of these actors are great but the spark was just not there and the script was just bad.
0345803485|5.0|I heard a lot about this book so I decided to see what the big fuss was about and I must say I just loved it. It kept me wondering what would happen and amazed. How the attraction between two people could be so intense. I ordered all 3 : ) when I finished fifty shades of grey I was rushing to start fifty shades darker!!! For some people this book is not what they expected and disapprove. I simply loved it and at every turn of the page I kept wanting more ah Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele..... My #1 on my list ; )
0307949486|4.0|This is a great story.  From the moment that a mysterious flower arrives, and its recipient tries to find out who sent it, we are drawn into his quest to find the killer of his niece.  He hires a disgraced reported to do the leg work, with assistance from a Goth type of character named Lisbeth who is diabolically brilliant.  She knows how to hack into computers and find information few could handle.  There are some gripping descriptions or her abuse, but she triumps in torturing and getting back at at least one of her abusers, by tying him down and tatooing \\"I am a rapist\\" on his chest.  There's a lot of edge to writing but it makes it very enjoyable.

I never stopped until I was finished.It`s a book in parenting!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have found Evernote to be a solid \\"cloud based\\" electronic note product.  For this review, I am using the \\"free\\" version.  I use if for keeping often used information and sensitive/confidential information on my computer and cell phone.  To do that I use the encryption feature and it works well and is easy to implement.  The encryption feature is only for text phrases and/or complete text documents, but that works well for me.  I would highly recommend this product.....
B003KGBIRK|5.0|What can one say about David Croneneberg´s Videodrome?<br />Just that it´s one of his most interesting films. Cronenberg´s filmography is truely unique and strange. I recomend watching this masterpiece of the 80s, and especially the Criterion Collection edition. See for yourself....
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Catan is a wonderful strategic game. We play every week twice a week (all adults). Everyone that we have introduced the game to has loved it and become instantly addicted.<br /><br />Please note that in the beginning the rules for play seem overwhelming and complicated but once you wrap your head around it - it becomes very easy to play. I encourage you to stick with it and apply yourself! It is well worth it.<br /><br />Also, 3-4 players is really the max you want to do if you are taking the game seriously. Playing with the expansion pack in larger groups can be a lot of fun but it really messes with your ability to play out any real strategy. In that setting, you have to \\"shoot from the hip\\".
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could not put it down. It is such a good book. Finished it within 3 days. I recommend it to everyone
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|This is justbto inconsistent on the Kindle Fire. One can not be certain that any shot will be the same. There is also the issue that the screen is not the same as the phone version. It is less helpful.
B007CKNX28|5.0|Awesome disc.  Listened to \\"Sixteen Saltines\\" and \\"Shakin\\" about 200 times - can't get enough. Lots of variety and really witty lyrics.  Other favs are \\"Missing Pieces\\" and \\"On and On and On\\".  \\"Hip (Eponymous) Poor Boy\\" is hilarious.
0307592731|5.0|This book is a wonderful read! I was hooked from the first page and enjoyed each page thereafter. It is not a hiking book even though she is hiking the Pacific Crest Trail. It is a story about her journey of recovery and discovery, and I made that journey with her. The writing is compelling, and the story is addictive. I hated for the book to come to an end. Cheers for Cheryl Strayed!
0439023491|5.0|I saw the movie first then bought the book and read it on a 5 1/2 flight and had to have books two and three.  Each book ended with wanting more; the three volumes get five stars from me!!
0345803485|2.0|I'm a little over half way through and am moving on to another book. The content is not offensive to me but the way in which Grey has become a dominant is... Mrs. Robinson, anyone? I don't mind a man w issues, but this is a little much for me. PLUS, the story was a tad too far fetched and repetitive. Blah. Blah. Blah.
B004LROUNG|4.0|It is a typical Grisham lawyer tale. I have read every Grisham book and this one ranks just below his best work, but it is a good book to read. Qman 7.
B005ZUR724|5.0|great graphics.  easy to learn. hours of fun. cheap cheap price covers several months of play. gameloft keep the hits coming.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I loved everything about Slammed. I was so intrigued by the Slam Poetry, it was beautiful and moving and such a unique way to learn about the characters in the book. Slammed is a story about the true meaning of family, growing up and a wonderful love story! I can't wait to read the sequel!
B005M2A4D4|5.0|The Complete Sixth Series of Dr. Who is a fun romp in Sci-Fi. I loved every minute. Wonderful gift for any one who loves Dr. Who.
0793518326|4.0|Obviously the book is great and the transcriptions are excellent and almost too comprehensive (tab for Revolution #9?  Really? lol)  Worth money for the attention paid to the vocal harmonies alone.  But since a large percentage of Beatles fans are, to put it kindly, \\"of a certain age\\" then I think this needs to be addressed.<br /><br />An electronic version of this book which could be zoomed solves every problem and eliminates the high cost pf printing such a big volume.  It would also be great if you could isolate particular parts.<br /><br />So c'mon, publisher, some of us want to buy this book AGAIN, in electronic format.  You're leaving money on the table!
B002JODPSO|5.0|DVD arrived early, in new condition. This was a great addition to the Die Hard series; an essential one if you're a fan.
076115678X|2.0|I have tightly curled/4a/african descent hair. There was a very small section on fractal curls. I find it interesting that Massey is supposed to be a curl expert yet had someone else talk about fractal curl care. Did she not take the time to learn about this type of hair? She doesn't have every type of curly hair herself yet is able to talk about other curl types. It was also disappointing that they used one model/hair type to talk about fractal curls and the very fact that they condensed the many types of afro hair into one section. The model they use has curls on the looser end of the spectrum. I tried the method shown on the dvd but I wouldn't recommend it if your curls are already tight. Scrunching made my hair shrink even more and tangle. I think the cover of the book is very telling. It is not for people who have tight curls like people of african descent. Also, although there are people from other cultures with loose curly hair the photos of everyday people lack diversity.
0345803485|1.0|The worst written book to be on the Best Seller list in forever. Don't get me wrong. I am always interested in a good erotic read, but this one is so poorly written that I had to dump it in the trash. I am not kidding - I just dumped it so no one else can be subjected to the cliched crap. Frogs and princes, elevator sex? Come on. Pathetic. James must be laughing all the way to the bank.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|All I can say is that I love this series. The story is wonderful and I totally recommend it. I just finished the second book and I can't wait to start the third. Hot, sexy, forbidden, turmulous, erotic, sad, agonizing OMG it is just wonderful.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Not a HUGE reader.  Read more now with my Kindle.  A book has to catch me pretty quickly in order to keep reading.  I didn't want to stop reading!  Ordered the 2nd book as soon as I finished this one!
B006ZDU7QI|4.0|Great music from a great artist! Original and dynamic! Every song is unique and fun!<br />Go Goyte! He will be around for a long time!
B007SSDS24|1.0|don't really know what to say about this other than the fact that this thing was horrible. Started of like a cheesy teen love movie and ended like, wellin not to sure because i fell asleep.
0061438294|5.0|Excellent book if your goal is to learn more about non-verbal communications in general. I would not recommend it if your main objective is to learn all about deception in particular though. The style is very pleasant and the chapters are well completed by lots of pictures and entertaining real-life examples, and practical tips that you can use in your daily interactions with others. It also gives the reader great insights about the origins of certain humans behaviors. I enjoyed it very much.
0307951529|5.0|I have been a Chris Guillebeau fan for several years. I'm a follower of his website, and I loved his first book, \\"The Art of Non-Conformity\\", and was looking forward to his second. As someone who has practiced what he has preached and lived a life outside of what most would consider the norm, I trust his opinion on running an unconventional business.<br /><br />For me, reading The $100 Startup was inspirational. As a cube-dweller for almost two decades, the idea of breaking out into self-employment is certainly appealing. The numerous examples that Chris provides show how you can turn many different passions into viable business opportunities. While reading The $100 Startup, I came up with an idea for a business that I now spend several hours a week on.  The book was worth the price just for shaking that idea out of my head.<br /><br />This isn't a step-by-step  how to start a business book, and that was the most appealing part. This book is an idea starter, one to get you thinking about finding the sweet spot between what you love and what people will pay you to do. As the title suggests, you don't necessarily need a lot of money to start a business. It depends on what you are trying to do, of course, but the majority of small business owners Chris speaks of started with very little money.<br /><br />This is a book that I am going to read again, as my business idea get closer to complete. It is full of great tips and examples, with stories of people who really have succeeded with their $100 startups. IMO, another excellent work by Chris Guillebeau.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Excellent Book!  A great study with clinical and statistical information to support conclusions.  The book covers many stories about personal habits and business habits that make or break a culture.  It is an empowering book.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great puzzle game. Low stress and relaxing, yet deep. Sound and graphics mesh in a way few games do. Definitely worth a try for puzzle fans.
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|After reading the 50 Shades trilogy I was looking for a similar novel and discovered Bared to You.  I loved this book as much, if not more than 50 Shades.  Looking forward to the next book in October!
B0052VUNHC|2.0|As I read this book, I just kept picturing myself at 19 (the age of the main character, Abby Abernathy), and I realized that yes, my 19 year-old self could have had the exact romantic fantasy detailed in Beautiful Disaster.  Travis Maddoxx is a supreme fantasy, indeed: a gorgeous bad boy with tattoos lining his strong arms, sexy yet intelligent, hard but a soft spot for that one special girl.... and, lest we forget, a guy who sleeps around yet secretly harbors morals and integrity.  And the romance between Abernathy and Maddoxx is all fire and ice, hot and cold, on and off.  True love?  Sure, if drama constitutes undying affection.  After awhile, I just got tired of it all.  I'm not 19 anymore.  Constant drama is not interesting, and is not romantic - neither is overwhelming jealousy and possessiveness.  Love does not mean wanting to punch everyone who talks to your object of affection.  Love is not torturing one another.  To me, this was more disaster than beautiful, and I'm thankful I've moved beyond what my 19 year-old self would have considered love.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|I can't say enough about this headset. First off the sound is simply fantastic. I use this headset with shooters, adventure games, and sports games. It works perfectly with all. The only negative thing I would have to say about this headset (which isn't really that big of a deal) is that it's not rechargeable. It takes 2 AAA batteries. I just bought rechargeable ones and haven't missed a beat. Love these things. Recommend to any one who is interested in a better gaming experience.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I enjoy reading Nicholas Sparks' novels every now and then.  The Lucky One didn't disappoint.  While the storyline was mostly predictable, the characters were well developed and had me feeling like a fly on the wall watching them walk their various paths.  Getting into the story provided a very pleasant interlude from start to finish.
B00005JMYI|5.0|Anchorman is the most far-out movie that blockbuster and cineworld has had on it's reviews and billboards. Will Ferrel is one of the \\"Top 8 Comedy King's\\" and makes Ron Burgundy look like Number 1. Champ Kind is the San Diego sex superstar and Brian Fantana the ultra, ultra, ultra Lady Killer of San Diego and most of all the best known comedy man Brick Tambland the geeky Jester. Christina Applegate the babelicous actress of Hollywood gives Veronica Corny-stone satisfation and together Will Ferrel and Christina Applegate make the perfect pair.<br /><br />The movie is great and i love it along with my dad and mum and sister and the cousins from everywhere and even my grandparents.<br /><br />IF THERE'S AN ANCHORMAN 2 THE MOVIE WOULD BE SOLD OUT IN LESS THAN WEEKS. I'm Ron Burgundy \\"YOU STAY CLASSY SAN DIEGO\\"

B004XN3FHA|5.0|i have many different flashlights for work that i use on a daily basis and this by far is the best one i have ever owned waterproof lightweight durable excellent battery life.the brightest light setting is as bright as my 2 million candlepower 12v plug in spotlight i use. a bit overkill if u ask me the 3rd setting is more than enough for night use for the money you cant beat this a little pricey but WELL worth the investment i average about 14-18 hrs of use with my rechargeable batteries using the 2nd brightest setting with occasional turbo mode use.

B004UID2LC|1.0|I downloaded a video and it took a longtime to load and then it wouldent let me watchit! I would give this zero if I could.
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|I must confess that I bought the book 11 years ago, but it sat on my shelf or packed in a box for the whole time; that is, until I watched this version.  It may be 500+ pages, but I highly recommend taking the time to read it!<br /><br />(If you're interested in a semi-biographical summary of Charlotte and her family's life, you might want check out the BBC docu-drama \\"In Search of the Brontës\\" - starring Victoria Hamilton as Charlotte.)<br />_______<br /><br />  First off, contrary to this movies preview trailers, there really is no added \\"preternatural\\" elements at least in the movie itself (which truth be told, was what put me off from watching it right away).  Although, 2 of the deleted scenes have it (specifically the extended scene when Jane is leaving Thornfield Manor, and her lengthened wandering on the moors).<br />...If that's what you're looking for, you'll be sure to find it in \\"Wuthering Heights\\" by Emily Brontë.<br /><br />**Semi-Spoiler**: The movie starts off at chapter 28 in the book.  Which may be a bit confusing to those unfamiliar with the story.  (To reiterate what another reviewer stated, the script writer's (Moira Buffini) interpretation of why she chose to write the story the way she did-- was so the viewer could be pulled into Jane's story right away.)<br />____<br /><br />Ideally, it would have been nice if they gave at least 20+ minutes more time to showcase the deeper conversations that Rochester & Jane had, and to prove that it was more than a sudden infatuation that spurred the proceeding relationship (despite their 20 year age difference).<br />..I'm really hoping for a \\"directors cut\\" to be released in the future!  (In the meantime, I'm really tempted to try my hand at video editing, and insert a few of the significant deleted scenes, and re-burn it to disc.)<br /><br />As noted earlier, the novel is some 500/600+ pages, so really only a miniseries could do it proper justice.<br /><br />However, as a stand alone (2 hour) m-o-v-i-e, all that could be condensed into that time frame without seeming too disjointed, or confusing- was.  In my opinion, it captured the essence of the story quite well!<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed the scenery, costumes, cinematography, musical score.  And last but not least, the cast- especially the leads: Michael Fassbender, & Mia Wasikowska, whose portrayals resonated with me more than most (if not all) of the previous I've seen.  Dame Judi Dench is my favorite Mrs. Fairfax to date!<br />_____<br />Just a quick mention... There's a lot of interesting interviews on YT with the director, and cast.  I just finished watching one called \\"Q&A with Director Cary Fukunaga and Actress Mia Wasikowska Interview Part 1\\" filmed March 1, 2011 in front of a live audience (pt. 2 being a Q&A with the audience themselves).  If you fast-forward to 5:10 you'll hear his take on how he approached the film.<br />_____<br /><br />Because of the time constraint, here are some of the more notable omissions/changes  (**SPOILER ALERT**):<br /><br />- Grace Poole (Bertha's nurse).  She was given about 1 minute screen time. In the book she was mentioned, and seen by Jane (as well has had a conversation with) before the whole revelation.<br />- Various extended conversations between Rochester & Jane (namely the proposal, before Jane's leaving Thornfield, and their reunion at the end).<br />- They should have kept one or two of the \\"deleted scenes\\" (included on the disc).  Specifically the (Jane/Rochester) \\"Badminton in the Garden\\" conversation; and if not the whole veil ripping scene, at least the part where Jane's recounts it to Rochester, and his response.<br />- The Rochester \\"Gypsy\\" scene was missing (Rochester's attempt at ascertaining Jane's true feelings towards him).<br />I realize this is probably a difficult scene-- likely one that would require multiple re-takes because I can imagine it would be hard for the leads to keep a straight face during it.<br />Both Michael Jayston ('73),and Timothy Dalton ('83) managed to pull it off, but it would have been interesting to see another attempt (even if it ended up as a bonus \\"deleted scene\\").<br />- Also, it could have been made clear as to who the Rivers siblings were in relation to  Jane (cousins); which was what ultimately prompted her to divide her 20,000 pound (equal to 1.7 million pounds, or $14.0 million USD in today's value) inheritance equally between herself and the 3 of them.<br />- The tweaked ending (Mrs. Fairfax moved away after the fire; book ending location: Ferndean manor -neither of which are major issues, but worth a mention.

On the downside it's pretty flawed in it's interpretation: lines \\"dumbed down\\", and certain events unfaithfully re-written.

(Haddon Hall is used in both this version and the '11 as \\"Thornfield Manor\\").<br /><br />- '97 (A&E) movie:  WARNING:  Don't be fooled by its title, this production is far removed from the book (so if you've never read it, and are seeking an authentic adaptation-- look elsewhere)! The only things that the two have in common are the names of its characters, and a few sequence of events!<br />95% of the dialogue has been re-written (and I don't mean simplified either- totally changed conversations which greatly change the characters), and some events added!  \\"Rochester\\" is an insufferable, maniacal, beast of a man!<br />How \\"Jane\\" could have felt anything beyond oppression and disdain is beyond me! Jane's character is even altered; she's borderline bratty, somewhat mouthy, and unreservedly opinionated!<br />Beyond any and all comprehension she actually loves Rochester (despite his blatant mistreatment of her- especially when she's about to leave)!!<br />If you dare watch this insufferable abomination, you had better have a pair of \\"frownies\\" on hand; Rochester's scowl is that infectious!<br />..Thankfully it was only 108 minutes long-- anything beyond that would have been torture!<br /><br />-  This adaptations screen writer is Sandy Welsh, who has written 2 of my favorite  miniseries: \\"North & South\\" '04 (the Elizabeth Gaskell novel)- a 1st place tie between \\"P & P\\" '95, as being my most favorite period drama to date!<br />And (Jane Austen's) \\"Emma\\" '09.  So for me,  she's set the bar quite high in her productions.<br /><br />Sadly, this miniseries pales in comparison to the faithfulness of the previous two BBC miniseries: 1973 & 1983.<br /><br />While the events are substantially in order, the dialogue is modernized (aka  \\"dumbed down\\").<br /><br />The chemistry (overt portrayal of physical attraction) is believable enough-- but I guess that's because it's pushed in the viewers face every few minutes, which is not that way in the book (since both Rochester& Jane are both described as less than attractive, so the attraction lies in their intellectual connection & personalities).<br /><br />I felt this \\"Rochester\\" (Toby Stephens) lacked the complexity of the books character.  His \\"brooding\\" lasts about 5-10 minutes, then he turns into a ridiculous lovesick whelp (but to be fair, part of the blame could lie in script, and direction).  In the book, \\"Rochester\\" is very careful at concealing his true feelings until the proposal scene; not so with this.<br />Ruth Wilson's portrayal of \\"Jane\\" was a fair bit better (likely in my top 3); although her appearance is much prettier than her book counterpart.<br /><br />The major things I didn't care for are (**SPOILER ALERT**):<br /><br />- Miss Temple was missing from Jane's Lowood experience (something the other 2 mini's included); who was very much a guiding force, and savior for Jane!<br />In fact, it was after Miss Temple married and left, that Jane decided to leave herself.<br /><br />- Instead of the game of charades in the book, they replaced it with the Victorian version of Ouija (which I didn't watch).<br />The charades scene was important, because one of them happened to depict Rochester & Miss Ingram being married (thus stirring a pang of emotion in Jane).<br /><br />- An actual Gypsy woman was hired by Rochester, instead of him dressing up and pretending to be one.  A major cop-out if you ask me, being the other 2 miniseries faithfully portrayed this important scene.<br />It's Rochester's rather unconventional (and somewhat comical) attempt at ascertaining her inner feelings towards him.<br /><br />- Rochester's plea for Jane to stay after the Bertha revelation, was much altered from the book, and sadly cheapened by spicing it up.<br />That whole bed scene simply did not happen in the book; in it Jane shunned Rochester's displays of affection at this point!<br />Again, refer to the '73 & '83 adaptations, if you want an accurate depiction!<br />(I also think 2011 movie captured this crucial scene much better, despite it being shortened.)<br /><br />- The glimpse of Bertha's licentious behavior after her marrying Rochester was utterly gratuitous, again, another ridiculous attempt at spicing the story up; a simple verbal explanation would have sufficed!<br /><br />In conclusion, I feel this miniseries had the potential to be so much better than it was.  If you really desire an accurate depiction, look elsewhere ('73 or '83 miniseries, or the condensed 2011 movie).<br />On the other hand, if you don't mind a modernized soaped up version of \\"Jane Eyre\\", then look no further!

Elliott's sense of melody and harmony were so rich, and his voice was so soft yet extremely \\"heavy\\". He understood...<br />Basically the Beatles in one guy, what else can I say?
B0068MNO4S|5.0|This inevitable feature film is based on a longtime claim held by a tiny minority of Shakespeare enthusiasts that Shakespeare himself could not possibly have written his plays, since their enormous vocabulary and mastery of the language was simply beyond the capabilities of a man of humble birth to an illiterate commoner from the countryside and who may or may not have received even a rudimentary grammar school education (a 1989 Frontline documentary, \\"The Shakespeare Mystery,\\" has previously covered the issue). The most plausible candidate who might have written the plays but for political reasons had to keep his identity secret is Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford (the Christopher Marlowe claim deserves separate treatment).<br /><br />The voices of the Oxford supporters or \\"Oxfordians\\" have grown more clamorous over the years, and the maxim that something repeated loud and long enough becomes the truth seems to be working in their favor. But in fact this supposedly solid argument of theirs is actually their weakest. No matter how elaborate an education you have received, you cannot write effective plays (poetry, maybe) if you are an earl, a duke, a nobleman or aristocrat lolling around in luxury and cut off from the rest of society. All the great playwrights of any country or era became playwrights because they were extensively involved in the life of the theater. The daily grind of memorizing hundreds and hundreds of lines in concurrently running plays and spending half of the day moving around the stage in rehearsals and performance before thousands of spectators would effect a unique and extraordinary mental transformation, whereby all this language would combine and recombine into one's own, enabling the more linguistically gifted of these actors to write plays even superior to those they were already performing. ONLY a dramatist and actor in the intense hothouse environment of the Elizabethan theater could have written these plays. The Oxfordians also haveto contend with other inconvenient evidence documenting Shakespeare's life, which they must suppress in order to spin a coherent counter-narrative (e.g., the references in Shakespeare's plays to flora and fauna species only existing in his West Country rural vicinity). Those interested in learning more about the facts we do have about Shakespeare and which are too many to go into here can peruse such fine studies as James Shapiro's [[ASIN:1416541632 Contested Will: Who Wrote Shakespeare?]] and [[ASIN:0060088745 A Year in the Life of William Shakespeare: 1599 (P.S.)]], Stephen Greenblatt's [[ASIN:039332737X Will in the World: How Shakespeare Became Shakespeare]], and Peter Ackroyd's [[ASIN:140007598X Shakespeare: The Biography]].<br /><br />That said, this is an extremely important movie. It's beautifully acted and filmed, with exquisite attention to period details and setting, including the most convincing and sustained mockups yet of the Globe and other theaters in which the plays were performed; there is even a scene in a bear-baiting arena (see my \\"A Shakespeare sex-and-violence starter kit\\" on my website linked to my Amazon profile page for more on the Bankside environs). This is an obvious commentary on the film's precursor, the brilliant [[ASIN:B00001U0E1 Shakespeare in Love (Miramax Collector's Series)]], which this film is clearly trying to upstage. Both films present snippets of performances from the plays - \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" in the earlier film; \\"Hamlet,\\" \\"Henry V\\", etc., in the current film - that, though all too brief, are as gripping as any of the greatest cinematic performances of the plays.<br /><br />Shakespeare lovers and scholars who are heaping invective on \\"Anonymous\\" as an outrage and who fear the film could have a negative impact on the younger generation by trivializing and distorting the facts about Shakespeare are missing the point. This film slices open the bloated underbelly of stodgy Shakespeare scholarship and dreary high school pedagogy, creating a lively debate where there was none before, educating and piquing a huge new audience about the historical context of Shakespeare. The creative retelling of the circle of intrigue around Elizabeth, the Cecils, Essex, Southampton, and Oxford throws fresh light as well on this history and the very writing of this history, despite the fictionalized liberties it takes (which \\"Shakespeare in Love\\" is also guilty of). On the contrary, this film could revolutionize the teaching of Shakespeare in schools by forcing debate and putting teachers' and professors' knowledge of the known facts on the stand, which have been too long taken for granted.

0765316994|5.0|You always wonder, what must the red shirts think. Thankfully, John Scalzi had some fun and wrote a book for us to let us know exactly what they think... They don't like the situation and set out to change it.<br /><br />This was clearly more a writing experiment than a complete novel, but that's OK. The characters are very much standard tropes, but again, that's on purpose. The situations are completely nuts, once more, by design. In short, Scalzi takes the concept that there are expendable crewman that constantly do something foolish only to die, early in a situation, then puts something approaching real people into the mix, and they start to wonder why.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the book. It's a good fun read, and then we get the coda's at the end to add to the whole thought experiment, so few of the characters, in this book anyway, are treated as red shirts. Instead, we get to see how John Scalzi works through building characters and trying out story lines and how a good writer can attack the same story from lots of points of view. In fact, as much as this was an entertaining read, it actually might server better as an instructional book to teach creative writing.<br /><br />Regardless of how you approach it, you'll have some fun and maybe, just maybe, think a little too. That's about all I need from a book.

B0035XVVDY|3.0|***1/2<br /><br />\\"Law Abiding Citizen\\" starts out like a modern-day version of \\"Death Wish,\\" spends a few moments aping the \\"Saw\\" franchise, then settles in as a cat-and-mouse crime drama centered around the theme that the American legal system seems designed as much to thwart justice as to enact it.<br /><br />The movie stands firmly in the long tradition of wish-fulfillment fantasies in which the victim of a broken legal system - functioning as a stand-in for an equally frustrated and helpless audience - finally says enough is enough and takes matters into his own hands, even going outside the limits of the law, if that's what it takes, to achieve justice.<br /><br />As with the Charles Bronson character in \\"Death Wish,\\" Gerard Butler's Clyde Shelton witnesses his wife and daughter being brutally raped and murdered by a couple of armed intruders. When the worst of the perpetrators cops a plea and is back out on the streets after a mere three years behind bars, Clyde is forced to take matters into his own hands. But he isn't content merely to bring down the killers themselves but to systematically go after everyone in the legal system - from strict-constructionist judges to hamstrung attorneys - who helped facilitate the injustice. That's where Nick Rice, well played by Jamie Foxx, comes in, the decent but by-the-book prosecutor who helped set up the deal and has now, along with everyone else involved with the case, become a prime target for Clyde's take-no-prisoners reign of terror and retribution.<br /><br />The one thing that distinguishes \\"Law Abiding Citizen\\" from similar films in the genre is that it's not afraid to have a deeply troubled, possibly even psychotic, character at its core. For Clyde does not fit the mold of the typically lovable antihero. The audience is, in the early stages at least, asked to root him on as a conventional Angel of Retribution dispensing the justice that the court system saw fit to deny him, but so much of what he winds up doing steps so far over the line that we eventually balk at his tactics. It's this moral ambiguity that helps to mitigate some of the implausibility of Kurt Wimmer's screenplay, which often goes for effect at the expense of credibility. Indeed the movie's insistence at making him a sort of omnipotent, omnipresent existential force of nature to be reckoned with takes the movie out of the realm of reality and cheapens some of what it is trying to do. And, in the process of reaching its climax, the movie takes a plot turn so ludicrous and credibility-defying that the whole thing pretty much crashes and burns at the end.<br /><br />That being said, Nick's interactions with Clyde are fun to watch and, thanks to taut direction by F. Gary Gray, there are some moments of genuine suspense scattered along the way. So if you can put your skepticism and critical-thinking skills on hold for the duration, you can have a pretty decent time with \\"Law Abiding Citizen.\\"g steps so far over the line that we eventually balk at his tactics.

I was completely hooked the second I started reading it. I actually had to buy the next two and ended up reading all three books of the series in three days. The characters are described so well and are so realistic that you really feel their pain. The almost impossible situations that they're put in and how they get out almost makes it seem like this is not fantasy but something that could really have happened some where.<br /><br />Get ready to laugh out loud and even shed a few tears while reading this book and the others! (because trust me, once you read this one you'll have to read the other two!)

1451627289|5.0|What if you could go back in time to one of the most horrific events in the last century and have an opportunity to stop it? Would you do it? 11/22/63 is the day John F. Kennedy was assassinated and in 11/22/63 Stephen King tells the story of Jake Epping, an English teacher from 2011 suddenly found himself in an era before smart phones, the civil rights movement, and the Vietnam War. With all the conspiracy theories around the assassination of Kennedy, how will Epping know what to do?<br /><br />Remember, Stephen King wrote this novel!  The Past is obdurate. It doesn't want to change and actively tries to thwart anyone attempting to change it. The more epic the change, the more the Past tries to stop the change. JFK's assassination was about as big of a change as you can imagine. Jake Epping experiences the wrath of the Past.<br /><br />In addition to being a great story, the book was a highly enjoyable trip down memory lane to a time before the turmoil of the 60's in the USA. King reminds us of the fashions, products, language, and even culture of the early 1960's. It may have been a simpler time, but with a 2012 perspective some elements of the time may not be as attractive as we think.<br /><br />I recommend that you read 11/22/63. Even though it has 849 pages it is enjoyable throughout and when you get to the end you will be more likely to be disappointed that is already over than glad you've finally finished it.
B004EPZ03O|5.0|As a child of the Muppets generation, I was quite pleased with the latest movie. It's not as good as Muppet Christmas Carol, Muppet Treasure Island or the original Muppet Movie, but it is still very, very good.  The Muppets dealing with their place in the modern world was fun to watch, thought I did on multiple times argue back that they never left.<br /><br />More Pepe for the next movie!  Best Muppet in the last 15 years.<br /><br />Amy Adams was revelation.  She was wonderful in this movie.<br /><br />Some of the other original songs didn't work as well for me, but The Rainbow Connection brought it home.<br /><br />Uncle Deadly - he scared the you know what out of me as a kid in The Phantom of the Muppet Theater, but he's wonderful in this one.<br /><br />Easy to recommend to any Muppet fan.

They are not as well known, but they are just as enjoyable.  \\"I Will Love For Love\\" is a hopeful tune.  This song gives me hope that I will find a special woman to love me.  \\"I Will Go With You\\" is a great song about loyalty and friendship.  \\"This Time I Know It's For Real\\" is a newer classic song. This song makes me happy.  The music of Donna Summer is timeless.

0345803493|2.0|Why, oh why, am I subjecting myself to this miserable series? It's poorly written, horribly repetitive and has become tiresome very quickly. If it wasn't for my pal, Mathu, I think I'd be trashing the last book in this trilogy. But she's egging me on, pushing my boundaries and ensuring we finish the damn series.<br /><br />It's such a crock! The sex scenes, to me, aren't very titillating. They're even somewhat boring. The descriptions certainly don't rank up there with some of the Black Lace books I've read, or even the Bad Boys series. And, for the love of Pete, if I have to hear about the inner goddess one more time I swear I'm going to commit hari-kari. (Or however you spell it... I'll be looking for a huge Samurai sword!) In this second book, we are introduced to (what one is to presume) a thriller aspect. Except....not only can this author not write romance, she can't do thriller either. Or suspense.<br /><br />Christian Grey is too needy. Way over the top. How many times can he beg her not to leave him? He's so very clingy. If I was in her shoes, I'd be running for the wind. Seriously, he's very much stalker material and that would scare the heck out of me.<br /><br />Anyway, the torture will only last through the final book. Then I can write another equally trashy review and be done with it. \\"Mommy porn\\" indeed. There's better stuff out there, ladies!

1451627289|5.0|There are a lot of good, detailed reviews on here.  Many make valid points,  which I will not repeat.  What I will say is that this is a book that readers who have not enjoyed King's work previously should tackle.  If you are thinking about reading this book,  know that it is not a horror book,  but rather, a  extremely well-researched and well-written book about the Kennedy assassination that will take you on a very interesting and thought provoking ride with some very likable characters.  I am a King fan and I loved the book, but I 've recommended it to at least 5 folks who are not fans of King and they all were blown away.  King is a master of character development, and here he shows that he's gotten even better with age.
B0079R8KXG|5.0|I bought a Kindle Fire for myself for Christmas and have been looking around around for a case/stand for it. I don't really have anything to compare it to, but it fits the Kindle really well. There are clips that hold it in place so nothing obstructs your view of the screen. They hold on tight so the Kindle doesn't slip and slide.<br /><br />It's a simple design, nothing too flashy. I'm not a big fan of the color red, but hey, nothing's perfect, right? It's about the size of a large pocket book, or journal (kind of reminds me of a journal actually), so really convenient for mobility and travel. It could fit in a large purse.<br /><br />I'm really happy with this product.

0345803507|3.0|After reading the first two books, which I must add were hard to put down! starting the 3rd I was expecting something fabulous especially for the last book, Sadly I was dissappointed.  It felt as if Mrs.James was in a bit of a rush to complete the last of the Fifty Shades, it was good, dont get me wrong, however it was choppy, bits and pieces of major events that took place in Christian & Anna's life, that I felt, worthy of a full plot only got sacattered with a memory here and there of the actual big events. Ahhh Well, Maybe she could re-write this one! Thank You any way E. for a facinating trilogy, cant wait to read your next work ;).
B004GYY714|5.0|I love this app. Its great for music and it works great. The only problem is that you need Wi-Fi to make it work.
1592220169|4.0|I really enjoyed this collection of interlocking short stories--and bear that it IS that genre.  It is NOT a novel.  Anyone expecting a story arc, closure, etc.,  will be disappointed.  This is a series of interlocking stories. THe main character, Tuf, is wonderful, and several of the stories are superlative, including the opener (which would make a fabulous movie even now).  The worst stories are still good reads.  Strongly recommended.

B007MC868M|3.0|Jo Nesbo's Phantom continues the adventures of rogue Norwegian policeman Harry Hole.<br /><br />Returning from Bangkok to Norway, Hole is intent on proving that Oleg, the son of his former girlfriend, Rakel, is not guilty of the murder with which he's being charged. As usual, the plot involves corrupt policemen, underworld Mr Bigs, and a twisty, turny plot that Nesbo uses to manipulate our sympathies.<br /><br />Translated from Norwegian by the author's usual translator, the prose has its typical clunky effect. The problem with translating - I speak from a little experience - is that when you come across a phrase in the original that, when translated into English, seems a little odd, it's often difficult to know whether that was the author's intention or not. So for example:<br /><br />  \\"But when he went back to the front door the boy had hopped it.\\"<br /><br />The phrase 'hopped it' reeks of the 1950s, and is given to us as representing the thought of a policeman in 2011. Does Nesbo want this slightly dated turn of phrase to represent this policeman? Or is it an attempt by the translator to be a bit casual and different, rather than using a simple expression like 'run off' or even 'legged it'? If nothing else, if I were Nesbo, I'd wonder whether my American readers would understand this very British usage ...<br /><br />As in most of his previous books, Nesbo's tactic in Phantom is to set several hares running and organize the plot so that they all arrive at the finishing line together. So here we follow Harry's story as he investigates the crime, but we are also given the first-person narration of the person who was murdered - Gusto, a young drug-dealer and junkie. Add to this a certain amount of the story told through the eyes of a bent cop, Truls Bernsten, and the narrative lines become complicated - especially as many of the other characters also add their own reported narrations into the mix.<br /><br />The effect of these multiple viewpoints, unfortunately, is to muddy the story rather than clarify it. Now in a crime story a certain amount of ambiguity is acceptable and even expected, as first one person then another becomes the focus of our attention as the suspected murderer/criminal. But in fact the information we're given from the different viewpoints seems to be there simply to 'surprise' us, not to be part of a slow revelation of clues that help us understand the underlying crime. For example, there's a scene where Harry leaves the apartment of someone he knows is guilty of a crime. When he leaves, the individual reaches for a rifle that Harry hadn't found when searching the place and aims at Harry's retreating back as he walks away ... end of chapter. New chapter: the guy takes a deep breath and puts down the rifle, having decided not to fire. Now this is uncalled for in context and isn't particularly dramatic, because we know Harry isn't going to be shot in the back when there are 60 pages still to go. The scene is there simply to act as a teaser, to force us to turn the page and start a new chapter.<br /><br />This is an obvious example, but there are others that are less obvious until you start to see them. For example, there is a set-up early in the book that an assassin has been put in place to kill 'a policeman'. It soon becomes clear that this is Harry. Nesbo shows us the assassin preparing himself and we even catch glimpses of him 'in the background' as we follow Harry working on the case. Without giving any of the plot away, the assassination attempt comes to light ... but the rationale for it is extremely thin. Essentially, the chief Bad Guy was aware that Harry would come to Oleg's defence and wanted to take him out of the picture. In fact this would require such foresight on the Bad Guy's behalf that it's fairly preposterous. But tactically, for Nesbo, it's a way of adding some tension into the first half of the story, while Harry is re-acclimatising himself to Norway and starting his investigation.Without this 'tension' the book wouldn't really contain any genre markers for 'thriller' and would be a fairly mundane police procedural, at least for its first half.<br /><br />So this is my main gripe about the book. Nesbo's focus seems split. As in the previous books, he develops Harry Hole's character as addictive, intelligent, even cunning, stubborn and in thrall to Rakel, the love of his life. He also spends a lot of page-time exploring the world of Gusto, the drug-addict/victim. There's a real intention to show us these characters as real people with depth, passion, flaws and hopes.<br /><br />On the other hand, he's writing for an audience that expects a certain number of 'thriller' buttons to be pushed. There has to be surprise, revelation, mysterious bad guys and violence. All of which he supplies, but in an almost mechanical fashion. The plot events whir like cogs and bring us to a resolution, but it's as if the two sides of the story don't quite fit together, the cogs don't mesh.<br /><br />And this is clear in the sense of 'Wha' happened?' that hits you at the end of the story. The resolution brings a lack of resolution. Is Mikael Bellman a bad guy or not? What part did the character Dubai play in the story? Why did we spend so much time with Tord Schulz at the beginning of the book when he disappears so rapidly afterwards? And the book ends with an even bigger mystery than it began with, that I can't mention because it would be the biggest spoiler of all ...<br /><br />Jo Nesbo is extremely popular and rightly so. His earlier books had prodigious bad guys, well-tooled plots and a character in Harry Hole who suffered physically and psychologically for our enjoyment. In Phantom, I'm afraid that the plotting tactics he's used before - concealing 'real' identities from the reader, revealing back-story bit-by-bit to explain the present narrative, using interesting killing tools, punishing his hero - have tipped over the edge into self-parody. He's certainly pushing the envelope of what he does as a writer, but this time it's at the expense of coherence and, in the end, enjoyment.<br /><br />(Taken from my blog at Crime Writing Confidential.)Without this 'tension' the book wouldn't really contain any genre markers for 'thriller' and would be a fairly mundane police procedural, at least for its first half.<br /><br />So this is my main gripe about the book.

Not only is there a ton of behind the scenes and special content in its pages but the pictures and sketches are great as well. There are also really neat removable prop reproductions that make the book totally worth buying.
B0071WQ7WU|5.0|It's been 4 years since Sound of Madness and it was well worth the wait.So far it's my CD of the year. After listening to Bully on the radio a few times, I grew tired of it quickly. But after reading several great reviews about the CD, I bought it and Bully is the worst song on the CD.
0345803507|3.0|While I love the story of Christian and Ana, this book bordered on over the top. So much unnecessary drama that detracted from the love story. This book seemed a tad unnecessary when compared to the other two. It was weaker structurally and didn't really grab your attention the way its predecessors did. It's a shame to end such a beautiful story with such a poorly constructed novel.<br /><br />The main concern was that it appeared that Christian failed to continue his forward progress in his emotional maturity. Controlling though he is, in the other books, it was clear that he was making giant strides in coping with his inability to rein in Ana's willful spirit. Additionally, in \\"Freed,\\" Ana suddenly became this wimpering, whiny creature, afraid to put the slightest toe out of line for fear of angering her husband. That's NOT the Ana we had come to know and love in \\"Fifty Shades\\" and \\"Darker.\\" It was distressing to see her mewl and whine internally, worrying over every little decision. The whole point of Ana was to have her independence and strength counteract what Christian had come to expect from his women in the past. But in this book, she really began to take on some of the characteristics of the submissive that Christian initially intended her to be.<br /><br />One thing that irritated me more than anything and detracted from the story was the incessent repetition of words and phrases: \\"once more,\\" \\"are you smirking at me?,\\" \\"Mr. Mercurial\\" and nearly a dozen others that consistently drove me to distraction! As a writer, one would think that Ms. James could think of a different way to phrase things.<br /><br />Overall, this book was a disappointment, as most books at the end of a series tend to be (Twilight, Harry Potter, etc.). It is painfully evident that Ms. James was desperately searching for some way to finalize the series and seemed to throw every last ounce of drama and challenge at her characters that did nothing to further the story (Ray's car accident, Mia's kidnapping). Not only that, but she leaves her audience hanging with regards to some of the critical characters - Kate and Elliot are at the top of my list.
B004EPZ0AC|5.0|Wow, what's with all the bad stars? This film was alot better than most sequels. The song 'Bridge of Light' Pink sang(written by Billy Mann) was absolutely touching and very inspiring. She sang this beautifully. RIP the original VA of Gloria, amazing, powerful voice that will be missed. Happy Feet's message is STILL here and not forgotten, to remind us that we are loosing God's creatures at an alarming pace and action needs to be done to CARE for what God blessed us with! This movie is just as great as it's first!

0307592731|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  The author is honest about her behavior and motivations to an almost embarrassing extent, and for me it made for a refreshing read.  She never seems to be interested in sugar-coating her actions, shifting responsibility for mistakes to someone else, or rationalizing to make herself look good.  It's sort of, \\"Here's me.  Good, bad, whatever.\\"  I also enjoyed learning more about the PCT (Pacific Crest Trail), especially since I live near Portland and am now motivated to hike part of it.  The book is an easy read, too.  I would've liked some photos (she said she took her camera), maybe a few more maps (there's just a small map near the beginning of the book), and an index to enable a reader to easily find pages related to an area of interest (e.g., a specific part of the PCT).
B000JRYOPG|5.0|This movie is great on so many levels. The first has got to be the music! It encompasses many types of Jamaican musics from tradition to a more hip-hop feel. For the movie itself, well all I got to say is it is raw. Lot of violence but it reveals a part of life that most people don't want to believe. The actors portray their roles very well. Just don't watch this movie and think you can be a top shotta, because it is what it is, a movie!

B007IXWL2C|1.0|These books absolutely do not live up to their fanfare. I could almost hear the cheesy xxx music playing in the background. The only saving character was Christian. He had demensionality that made him believable. Anastasia on the other hand read much like a teen drama reminiscent of 90210. Constant repeating phrases were nothing but distraction,to the point of being cring worthy. I wanted to love these books but sadly they left me wanting.

B002SF9YNO|5.0|This film has it all...drama, mystery AND fun.  I first saw this film on Netflix and after one viewing knew I wanted to own it.  I find one of the main problems with foreign films they are either to esoteric or drag on and on to make some cultural, political or social statement.  Not this film.  The plot is tight and the Director interweaves humor with the drama.  You learn something about Japanese culture without being beat over the head.  You can easily identify with the characters despite language and cultural differences because this film highlights our basic commonalities.  I think is is one of the reasons I so enjoyed it.  Excellent film about how a misunderstanding can change a persons life.  Highly recommend....

B00746O3X8|5.0|I too was skeptical before ordering. I had only concidered cotton carrier as the only logical choice when carrying two camera bodies and not having them swing in the wind while walking. I had this Optika MCH-25 adjusted perfectly in 5 minutes. I've got a Canon 5D Mark 11 with a 70-200L IS in front and a Canon 40D with 11-16mm on the side. What a joy! I have never written a review on camera gear before but, this was a steal! It has locking lugs that slide then lock into place once in holster. This thing is well made PERIOD!
0345803493|1.0|As foretold in my previous review for book one, my worst fear has been confirmed: Ana and Christian continue to have sex, chapter by chapter. The first book was interesting enough. I wanted to get to know Christian a little bit better; he was like a mystery, and I love mystery solving. However, the second installment is a huge disappointment. Absolutely no plot whatsoever. The book drags on forever just to get to a point. It seems like there are only two characters in here, and they are Christian and Ana. Everyone else is obsolete. In fact, they  barely have any roles in the \\"plot\\" except to serve as a break for the couple when they're not having sex. Yet, despite where they're at, they still manage to have sex. And Ana and Christian have only known each other about 3 weeks, and they've been having sex constantly. Get this: Ana was a virgin before she met Christian. I'm wondering how she's able to walk after all the sex she's been getting. I'm not even going to bother to read the third book. I wish I hadn't purchased the entire trilogy. I wish I had borrowed it from the library instead. Everything is redundant and boring. I never thought I would get bored reading about sex, but this book did it for me.
B007JRU4N0|2.0|This movie was sad the whole time. It had a bit of wit here and there but even the points they seemed they were trying to get across were not played off well. My dad fell asleep; I almost did. In the end I would say great acting, boring movie, with no point!

B005CGI4EG|4.0|Married with children is one of my all time favorite tv shows. When i saw this on Amazon for $40 i couldn't pass up on that offer! I bought it and after i received it i was surprised that the box that it came in was kind of small. After I opened it I noticed that there are two spindles on each side of the box and each spindle holds 16 discs (32 total). Since I take care of my collections and i did not want to have scratched discs I went to best buy and got myself a cd case for 32 discs. I'm not complaining about the packaging because for $40 it's an amazing deal, I just think that the whole thing could have been packaged a little better. Show: 5/5 stars and packaging 3/5 stars.

B007P6VM04|2.0|Did the person producing this album watch this first season of SMASH?<br />Amazing how many significant songs were left out.  One such number that should have been at the top of the list was SECOND HAND WHITE BABY GRAND by Megan Hilty.  Her performance was incredible and the words leave a lasting remembrance.  However it was fantastic that they included a longer version of BRIGHTER THEN THE SUN as there was much online chatter requesting a full version.<br /><br />This album seemed to completely miss the spirit of the show and it leaves one wondering if they pulled some of the best to then promote as singles and maybe generate more revenue.  All the work on SMASH is excellent but so few of the very top songs made it onto this album.  If you're going to deny us volume at least give us the best of the best.  The music has been completely produced so why can't they just burn an extra CD and charge us accordingly? However, this way we loose and they loose.  Think about next time making it a win win but at the very least hire a new CD producer.

B0058YPILY|5.0|I love this show. It's just something about it, which keeps me tuning in every Wednesday night for a brand new episode. Due to the subject at hand it's NOT the show for everybody, but if you are a fan of psychological thriller's this is the show for you.<br /><br />\\"Criminal Minds\\" will challenge your mind every episode. It shows what it is like to get into the mind of serial killers, and with every episode we get drama, mystery, and action. These cases are twisted and eerie, and most of the time what you think is going happen, doesn't. Every show literally has me on the edge of my seat.<br /><br />Pros: 1.The writing is superb<br />2. Every character is well defined<br />3. Great acting<br />4. Compelling cases<br /><br />Cons: 1.There is none really, unless you count the season ending cliffhanger.<br /><br />I won't be giving away any spoilers for those who haven't seen it, but \\"criminal minds\\" isn't like any other show on television. I highly recommend it, you will not be disappointed.
B0059XTV7Q|5.0|I stumbled across this movie because the music is great.  I was completely shocked when I read that Madonna had directed it.  The production documentary is on You Tube and I found it inspiring and it made me want to see the film.<br /><br />I wasn't disappointed.  The film is visually perfect and demands repeated viewings.  The story and acting is also very good, however the flashbacks showing the duke and duchess is where it gets a little thin.  It skirts video territory instead of film, but still - extremely well done.<br /><br />The blu ray is oustanding picture and sound.  This film probably got punched harder than it normally would have because Madonna directed it.  A real shame because the film is quite good and worth a viewing.
0345803485|1.0|The story, I must admit, did grab me, but as I read the numerous issues distracted from the tale, and then the tale itself became empty.<br /><br />E L James is obviously British based on the language and terms.  Recommendation, write what you know or learn about the place you intend to write about.  Also, twenty-somethings do not use such old language.  I know Ana is a literature fan, heck I am an English major and adore Shakespeare, but I use current slang and I am thirty-three.  Next, a Blackberry is so 2005, Grey would have bought Ana an IPhone or Android, the yet-unreleased model.<br /><br />Next, I have not had any direct experience with BDSM, but I am an avid reader and consider myself an untrained submissive.  The cliche that Grey must be damaged or a severely abused child to enjoy dominating another consenting adult is quite offensive.  As I was reading this, I thought, whoa, those actually in the scene must be fuming.  Such a blatant misrepresentation.  If Grey was a typical, realistic Dominant, he would have never kept Ana once he realized she was not a submissive.  It seems E L James wrote about her uneducated, media-fed perception of those in the BDSM lifestyle.<br /><br />Oh God, the next to worst.  In 2011, a twenty-one year old female virgin I can believe, but one that has never masturbated?  Really?  And this complete innocent, never touched by even her own hands, can orgasm during her deflowering and just a little nipple-play?  This book is more of a fantasy than Twilight.  Oh, but Ana can come pretty much at will. I laugh at this premise.  Based on this, Ana should have sat down and played a flawless rendition of Bach on Grey's piano without having ever touched ivory keys.<br /><br />The worst is the writing.  An abomination. Makes Stephanie Meyer look competent.  Like a previous reviewer, if I read another comment about Ana's inner goddess, I was gonna have an epileptic fit.  Also, who actually has an inner goddess and mentally imagines this figment's every move around a fantasy apartment?  I think Ana is more messed up than Grey. And if I read Ana mooning over how gorgeous Grey is...Grrr.  Yes, some men are that hot, but not so hot you would be willing to be flogged if that wasn't your scene. The biting lip thing, tired by Chapter 8. The whole pushing Ana to eat thing, tired by Chapter 9.  Inner Goddess, tired by the second mention.  Wow, I just realized this book really does suck.  No accounting for taste.<br /><br />Off to go read something highly recommended (by those who know, wink wink).  Sleeping Beauty series, here I come!
1416562605|4.0|What an utterly profound, insightful peak into contemporary India! The seriousness of the issues are not lost in the humorous narrative. As an Indian living in Delhi, and born and brought up in Dhanbad myself, I connected with each and every word of this novel. Not that the region/towns matter -- what Adiga describes is true across India, and we do indeed have 'Balram's' in most affluent homes. India has changed, but what was earlier a product of 'caste', and is now more a product of 'class', though the inequalities remain pretty much the same. The character of Balram is dark, and definitely not someone one would want to love, but given the realities of India, one cannot outright ignore the reasons behind such deviance. Two separate \\"India\\" exist today, and this novel has brilliantly captured that. Tremendous read.

B002M3SP28|4.0|It is a work of fiction, with perhaps many liberties taken to dramatise facts. But the build up to the historical event, the detail, and the description is amazing. Granted that Archer was not present at the time to have personal knowledge of most of what is narrated, and neither are there public records for many of them, but he has crafted a tale so gripping and magnificent that it makes you believe, absolutely, that it was Mallory who did it first! I am awed by this storytelling for this fact alone. Archer has written a novel that makes you believe what must have happened, and how. It may amount to romanticizing an idea, but how! Excellent read.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|works pretty well. freezes at times, but not a big deal. this game reminds me of playing Mario bros on nintendo.
0307454568|4.0|Rock on Lisabeth Salander! Hurt, wounded, shot in the head, yet living with her brain still 'clicking' faster than a comet. This third of the Millenium series is as good and gripping as the first two. Too lengthy, but I think Larsson did not believe in brevity and being succinct. I enjoyed it, overall!

0385535139|4.0|The Litigators by John Grisham seems to remind one of the initial novels that used to be his forte. This novel is fast paced, gripping, has twists and turns, ends on a fairly happy note (sort of good guy wins), yet has its basis in realism. Gets a little technical with US court procedures, but then that's acceptable in a legal thriller. Absolutely enjoyed it, and highly recommended.
B0000524E5|5.0|Love the music and story line. Shows with a little determination you can accomplish your dreams. Well worth the money!
B002RI9ZQ8|5.0|A very refreshing change from the typical thrillers one finds dime a dozen (not that they are bad!). This story does not have the usual dramatics that one would associate with a murder/crime thriller. It does have unnecessarily descriptive narratives at times, but that's compensated by the plot, the pace, and the twists. One is left to wonder whether the heroine is a super-human, but I will overlook that fact. It is a fiction and a thriller at that, and have seen many other protagonists created by other authors who are super, super human, so I can live with Lisabeth Salander being what she has been described to be. Could have been a little shorter in length, but as I mentioned, it still moves at a brisk pace and is very gripping to really not get bothered by the length. A highly recommended read.
B006G7Y7GY|5.0|I bought this as a birthday present for my son who has always been an Ozzy fan. He could not put it down from minute one and constantly called me, \\"Mama did you know...?\\" He said this has been the best addition to his collection so far and highly recommended it to others
0307949508|4.0|As good as the first one of the Millenium series. Gripping, full of twists and turns. The consistency in the narrative is top notch. Again, I still can't figure out the heroine properly -- she is frail and anorexic on one hand, suppressed and oppressed by the predicaments of her life, yet can beat aliens from Mars when it comes to being a computer hacker and a boxer! Nonetheless, a great read and highly recommended for a thriller.
B007SSEBCU|5.0|I liked the movie very much. It brought a, for me, new look at Margret Thatcher and her humble beginnings. Meryl Streep was at her absolute best!
B003DWC6IQ|4.0|Another masterpiece from Archer. This novel can make John Grisham sound ordinary. Excellent drama, with a touch of a high quality legal thriller. Highly recommended.

1455518999|3.0|Make no mistake, my star rating does not mean its a bad read. But, overall, I thought this read more like a script/screenplay for an average Hollywood movie (like the ones that I will not associate with A-grade movie star), rather than a good novel. A plain and a fast read, it is another one of those stories that revolve around an immortal superman kind of hero who cannot be killed, who can do anything he wants, and his physical abilities can make Hercules feel like a poodle. If you are into that kind of stuff, you will love it. If not, perhaps you should take it up if there is nothing else to read.
B004Q7CIFI|1.0|I read 300 pages to go nowhere pertaining to 11/22/63 historical event. I wanted to give Steven King a chance, hoping to read a historical narrative. NOT.
1250000971|4.0|Second of the Clifton chronicles series, I found this to be an easy, yet a masterful read. Perhaps it is my bias for Archer, but it carries the story forward from the first novel very smoothly, logically, and consistently. This is not a stand alone novel, so if you have not read 'Only Time will Tell', don't read this first. This installment end on a high, and I am looking forward to the next of the series. A recommended work from Archer.
B004BSAEQC|4.0|Hi! I downloaded Nicki Minaj's Pink Friday on iTunes for my iPhone a while back. I am just now getting around to writing a review about it. It is a really fun album.<br /><br />Recently I just noticed that she released another version of  [[ASIN:B004BSAEQC Pink Friday - Explicit]] called [[ASIN:B007NCSQFO Pink Friday ...

1582701709|5.0|The Secret is a life changing book ,an adrenaline rush for the soul an antidote to misery and despair.<br />Three years ago after years of having a successful business and living the high life my business went bust and I lost almost everything ,my business ,my friends ,my car ,even my credit cards were  taken off me . I really worried about how I could look after my wife and daughter and feared about losing my house. All I could think of was all the bad things that could happen to me .<br />Being  a naturally positive person I tried to focus on positives while cutting back on every cost possible. One day I saw the secret on a book shelf in a local shop .It was expensive a meal for 2 but as I flipped through the pages my spirit started to rise and I knew I had to buy this book. With no job and no income the book taught me to focus on what I wanted ,what my dreams were how I wanted my life to be not how it was. I pinned a make believe cheque on the wall payable to myself for 500,000 pounds sterling (800,000 usd) .I started to write down all the great experiences I had had and all the things I was really good at and started saying thank you a lot and thinking twice before uttering a negative word. My attitude to life changed , I started to believe that if I thought something could happen then it would ,but  not only that it gave me the inspiration to turn the could do into the I will do and this in turn created the I have . In other words I worked really hard while focusing on my goals and my positive attitude created positive things. That doesn't,mean that every problem suddenly disappeared it's just that I chose to focus on the positive ,what I wanted  to happen .Problems were like a dirty tissue that I'd blown my nose on and stuffed into my pocket ,I'd get rid of them later.<br />Around 18 months later in 2011 I received more than I had written on the make believe cheque,life had turned around again ,I was happy but humble . I tell everyone about this book the secret but they say my story is so amazing I should  write my own book ,what do you think.

I bought this to show my granddaughter and of course I actually enjoyed it more.  My granddaughter is 2 years old, so buying these Disney Classics is a good excuse for me to collect them all. I've also learned you have to get them when you can, or you'll miss out.
B003VWU2WA|5.0|Recently ditched my multimedia keyboard for a Das Keyboard Silent.  The keyboard is GREAT, but lets face it, after using a multimedia keyboard for years, things like lowering the volume, or skipping a song you take for granted.  This solves the volume issues.  Something to keep in mind if you are playing games that you cannot minimize to desktop during play to adjust the volume.
B005A1ER0I|5.0|\\"Illusions\\" gets my award for best album on the planet, and the first that I truly rank as a 10 from beginning to end. When listening to this music, I feel as though I am experiencing shimmering echos of the majestic heart of the Cosmos, as if the pure glory of the celestial heavens was channeled and forged into this soul-nourishing gift for humanity.<br /><br />This is a monumental achievement and a true masterpiece of power and beauty, one that humbles and melts my soul when contemplating how such stirring compositions can manifest from the hearts of humans.  This album should be launched into space so the universe - both present and future - is put on notice as to the heights that man can achieve in his various endeavors.  This is the soundtrack for mankind.  -- Christopher Pufall (May 17, 2012)

0871404133|5.0|What better person to explore the biological origins of the human condition than preeminent biologist Edward O. Wilson!<br /><br />This book is a fascinating read. I especially like Wilson's positive slant on what many see more negatively. Take, for example, the observation that human beings are both innately good and innately wicked. Wilson observes, \\"In a constantly changing world, we need the flexibility that only imperfection provides.\\" (p. 241)<br /><br />He clearly reiterates his conceptualization of evolution, which distinguishes between the evolution of genes (that has to do with individual selection and is responsible for what we call sin) and the evolution of culture (that has to do with group selection and is responsible for altruism). He summarizes: \\"...selfish individuals beat altruistic individuals, while groups of altruists beat groups of selfish individuals.\\" (p. 243) This conceptualization of evolution, while controversial, is an important contribution to understanding our human biological origins.<br /><br />Wilson underscores how interconnected human beings are and how much larger and discordant our modern social networks are becoming. He concludes that our increasing interconnectedness worldwide will inevitably \\"weaken confidence in creation myths ...\\" (p. 293) I disagree. Because the human mind needs stories to explain its meaning, I believe that our increasing interconnectedness will force a new interpretation of creation myths taking into account our intersubjectivity.<br /><br />Furthermore, I believe Wilson arrives as such an interpretation by the end of his book. I quote, \\"So, now I will confess my own blind faith. Earth, by the twenty-second century, can be turned, if we so wish, into a permanent paradise [read: Garden of Eden] for human beings, or at least the strong beginnings of one. We will do a lot more damage to ourselves and the rest of life along the way, but out of an ethic of simple decency to one another, the unrelenting application of reason, and acceptance of what we truly are, our dreams will finally come home to stay.\\" (p. 297)<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for all concerned with human existence and the future of our earth.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I bought this book after seeing a news story about it. How it was self published and how HOT it was. While there were some things about the authors style that got on my nerves here and there. Like I swear she had a Thesaurus on her desk next to her as she was writing, and used it more than she should have. And how she consistently used \\"filler\\" sentences throughout all three books.  It was and is HOT and SEXY.<br />I tore through all three books in just over a week on my Kindle. And my husband was a very, very happy man during that time. :)<br />While I dont see me suggesting this book to my mother, mother in law or sister or giving this book as a Christmas gift. Which I did with \\"Lamb\\" a few years ago. I did post on FB that it was a  ahem \\"good, fast read\\"<br />I also can't imagine sitting by the pool, unless it is your own pool in your back yard. Or on the beach, unless you have a private cabana and a cute cabana boy. And be reading this. It is that hot. I was squirming during certain pages.<br /><br />Overall. If you are a stickler for \\"proper\\" writing style. Pick up a Stephen King title. If you want something that will get your body humming. Pick up this trilogy.
0439023521|5.0|There are times when a book rises to the top not because of story or imagination, but purely based on the authors ability to grip you and keep you hooked.  Hunger Games falls into that category and Collins deserves high praise for producing a page turning epic.  The idea is not wholly original; the theme of struggle in an apocalyptic future having been presented in uncountable variations.  Yet readers will find themselves instantly engaged finding difficulty putting this book down as the pacing of the action throughout the whole book is outstanding.<br /><br />The story revolves around the idea of a distant and vague future where the vast bulk of the population is controlled by a central capital city.  Living in separate districts, the general population lives in squalor while forced to produce and serve the capital city.  To remind the districts who is in control, the capital city forces each district to produce two children for the Hunger Games, where they fight to the death for the entertainment of the Capital.<br /><br />The idea is unquestionably violent as it contains elements that will make most people shudder.  But one cannot help feel that Collins is delivering a message, perhaps aimed directly at those that would deliberately turn a blind eye toward the topic.  When you consider life in a first world nation where our biggest concerns often revolve around cars, clothes, and the newest smart phones and tech gadgets, while third world nations filled with people that live in squalor are invaded for oil or work for ridiculously low wages to export cheap products to the rest of us, you really have to wonder.  We have athletes that come from nations where potable water is often a luxury and we marvel at their athletic prowess and turn them into millionaires if they succeed, but send them packing back to their nations of poverty without a second thought if they fail.  What is Collins really saying here?  The Capital City may or may not represent anything, but you will look at your values a bit differently after finishing Hunger Games.  There is a lot to be said for packing in a message this powerful in a book about children.<br /><br />The result is a very sad and violent epic, wrought with conflict and wrapped around a complex love story.  While the story is good, the writing is unquestionably exquisite.  Collins has the ability to pull you in with nearly every page, resulting in a book that is not just hard to put down, but one you will race to get back to until you finish.will look at your values a bit differently after finishing Hunger Games.

0439023491|4.0|Picking up where Hunger Games left off, this version lays the ground work for a second wave of action.  Collins maintains the intrigue and page turning elements from the first book, the result of which is a very good sequel to the epic Hunger Games.  Added to that is an unexpected twist that provides even more punch to the story.<br /><br />It was necessary for Collins to give more back story into the other districts for the first half of this book to further develop the plot of the entire series.  Aa a consequence the opening is not as energized with the constant excitement found in Hunger Games.  Had the whole book maintained this pace, it would have been an unsuccessful sequel.  However, the second half of the book not only equals the excitement from the first, but perhaps surpasses it.  Once things began to happen, this book nearly explodes at its seams.  Added to this Collins provides a cliff hanger that even outdoes the original, thus you will nearly be forced to run to the bookstore to pick up Mockingjay, the third novel in this series.  If you enjoyed Hunger Games, there is no question that you will also enjoy Catching Fire.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Wish I had read the reviews.  This is soft porn and not particularly inspirational, informative or interesting. I don't get it.  I also hate books that are transparently set up to start the sequel money train by ending abruptly in an inappropriate part of the story line.  NOT A FAN
0439023513|5.0|The final book in the Hunger Games trilogy picks up right as Catching Fire left off and pulls you right into the action yet again.  Collins' writing style is so gripping that just like the first two books in the trilogy, you will have difficulty putting this one down.  The pace hastens much faster than the prior two books and powers you through right to the end of the book.  A key difference in Mockingjay relative to the prior two books is this one is a story more about war than competition or survival, but otherwise, all the same elements of conflict, emotional complexities, and love appear in Mockingjay.  Mockingjay provides a clear ending to the trilogy, one that is resolute yet may not be the most satisfying depending on your feelings for the characters.  Yet regardless of how it ends, the writing, story, and the book as a whole is a very solid conclusion to this epic series.
0345803493|2.0|I have to admit, at least there was more story this time even though the entire \\"story\\" could have been written in less than half the entire book if the sex was removed. That should give an indication as to how much sex there really is. Once again, they can't seem to walk from one room to another without pounding. I finally started to just skim past the sex to read the story. If the sex was good, it might be a different story, but really, it's not that great.
B005LAII0S|5.0|Good, not great but good.  A fun adaption with a darn good cast.  It misses on some marks, but it's hard to compare this to the storybook tale that Disney told.  Doesn't make it a bad movie, just must view it on it's own as a separate story.

There's no background knowledge assumed or exclusive demographics. The whole book builds on your intentions to provide something worthwhile and your desire to accomplish something independently.<br /><br />There is very action oriented guidance for all stages of starting your own business, from generating your ideas and setting up, to relationship building, marketing and scaling (or not!) your business operations. I particularly liked the case studies across a variety of industries. There are also worksheets (and additional resources provided online) to work through questions, business plans, product launches and on and on...<br /><br />Regardless of the stage of your small business, this book has insights waiting to be yours.

B004EPZ03Y|4.0|Let's face it, even an old cynical geezer like myself has to like The Muppets, even if they were never a daily staple.  Writer and star Jason Segel clearly puts the characters in an exalted place with this lovely reunion.  He plays Gary, from Smalltown, USA where he grew up along with his \\"brother,\\" a Muppet who doesn't know it, named Walter.  His longtime girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams, who perfected her song and dance role in 2007's \\"Enchanted\\") is eager to spend some alone-time with Gary but relents when he takes along Walter to a trip to The Muppet Studio.  When they get there, they find it in total disrepair and pledge to find Kermit in an effort to put the group back together again.<br /><br />The studio is about to be acquired by an evil investor named Tex Richman (Chris Cooper) unless the gang can raise $10 million.  The film is lightweight fare of course but there is no denying the affection for Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie, Gonzo and the rest.  There are enough jokes for the adults to appreciate and enough of a message to instill in the youngsters.  The film is laden with cameos including Zach Galifianakis, Jim Parsons, Dave Grohl (Foofighters), James Carville, Selena Gomez, Neil Patrick Harris, and many others.  Unfortunately the music isn't anything special but can be overlooked given the character's enthusiasm.  This is a beautifully constructed film, the whole family can enjoy.<br /><br />The Blu ray disc is presented in a 1.78:1 aspect ratio in 1080p.  The audio is DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1.  Both the video and audio are perfect.

B004WOS3P4|2.0|In order to have a successful song, you need two of the following three things: voice, melody, and lyrics, to be great. David has the voice; I don't think anyone would question that. In fact, he has one of the greatest voices there is, or ever has been. But when you lack original, creative melodies and lyrics, your voice becomes all but irrelevant. I loved David on Idol. Little Sparrow and Always Be My Baby still give me goosebumps. But that David seems to have disappeared, and it breaks my heart. I understand his desire to write his own songs, but maybe that just isn't one of his strengths. If you want to be successful, you have to play to your strengths. David's strengths, that I have seen, are his voice, his musicality, his stage presence, and his attitude. His best performances have been of existing songs for which he created new, fresh arrangements. None of the songs on this album feel original, with the exception of Fade Into You, which I like. Much of the other subject matter and lyrics are tired and cliche. None of the other melodies are special. I don't continue to think about or sing the songs when I am done listening to the album. It's actually quite an effort for me to listen to this album all the way through. I always thought I could listen to David \\"sing the phone book\\", as Randy was always fond of saying, but it turns out that isn't true.<br /><br />Those of you that are giving David 5 stars for mediocre work on This Loud Morning and David Cook (which was marginally the better piece of work), are not doing him any favors. Don't you wonder why the only song of his that ever gets played on the radio is Time of My Life? I never even hear Light On anymore. Meanwhile, Daughtry and Kelly Clarkson are churning out hit after hit, and their older songs still get plenty of airtime. Why? They have catchy, fresh melodies and/or lyrics. Sometimes both. And they aren't overproduced. I agree with that criticism as well. David has so much ability. I can't understandwhy songwriters aren't lining up for him to sing their songs. (Or maybe they are, and he just isn't making good choices.) Whatever the reason for this underwhelming collection, I hope David will take a good, honest look at every aspect of his work, including at his collaborators. I hope he will return to what made him so successful, and so beloved, on Idol. He is so much better than this!
B0001XPY1G|3.0|I culled my faves from this and gave it away. It's worth it though to get all my favorite childhood songs, including the Best Love Song Ever (about a RAT!!!) \\"Ben\\", when Micheal was still semi-normal. A haunting ballad by a pint-sized James Brown. Brilliant. But there is a lotta crap on here too. You have been warned.
0307593312|4.0|I'm a little late on this review. I pre-ordered this book, and I finished it within days of receiving it on its release date. Since it's such a long book, there's something to be said when it's read in under a week.<br /><br />Alright, so I'm a Murakami fan. This book felt familiar from the first page to the last. The first two parts of the book read quickly as we developed a sense of perspective for the two main characters and their world(s). The last part of the book was slower, but it wasn't a challenge to read. The story is almost whimsical and definitely otherwordly, but as usual, I gravitate to his writing style. I enjoyed the romance in this story even if sometimes it seemed more fantastical than the second moon.<br /><br />I liked the book, and I actively recommend it to friends.
B006MVJ2L4|4.0|American Idol® runner-up Adam Lambert follows up his 2010 `proper' debut [[ASIN:B002QEXN3O For Your Entertainment]] (excluding his independently released efforts) with 2012's sharper `proper' sophomore effort [[ASIN:B006MVJ2L4 Trespassing (Deluxe)]].  For Your Entertainment gave Lambert a gold-selling album, though the effort failed to evade controversy with risqu&eacute; single \\"For Your Entertainment,\\" which ultimately fizzled at radio.  It would be more traditional pop/rock single \\"Whattaya Want From Me,\\" co-written by P!nk that would ultimately propel Lambert's debut.  Trespassing is better conceived than its predecessor, being sharper in both focus and production and ultimately allows Lambert's rangy, dynamic voice to shine brighter.  Lambert enlists a slew of producers including Pharrell (of the Neptunes), Dr. Luke, Cirkut, and The Smeezingtons (aka Bruno Mars's writing team) among others to make Trespassing an inescapable pop force in 2012.<br /><br />Lambert snarls on opener \\"Trespassing,\\" accompanied by stomping drum programming and a fat bass line. Pharrell yields some of his best production in years, matching up exceptionally with the `over-the-top' singer.  Lambert sings more than convincingly on the refrain: \\"Well I was walkin' for sometime/when I came across this sign/saying who are u and where are u from/we don't like when visitors come...no trespassers, yeah my...wait `til you get a load of me...\\" The spirited vigor of \\"Trespassing\\" transfers into \\"Cuckoo,\\" a number that opens with a nice crescendoing synth at the onset.  Produced by Josh Abraham and Oligee, \\"Cuckoo\\" contrasts \\"Trespassing\\" but delivers and equally alluring cut.  Rich in synthetic texture as well as sass (\\"Oh walk that walk like u don't give a -), Lambert easily has another captivating hit on his hands.  Lamber sounds particularly top-notch on the bridge section.<br /><br />\\"Shady\\" (featuring Nile Rodgers & Sam Sparro) does not dare concede one iota of momentum, finding producer/co-songwriter Lester Mendez in the production chair.  The sound is `slinky,' musically representing the title of the track; clever. Lambert's vocals begin rather understated and controlled, but build up given their treatment - harmonized vocals on the pre-chorus and soaring, commanding vocals on the refrain. The best production highlight might be the funky, Prince-like guitar allusions.  \\"Never Close Our Eyes,\\" the second single from Trespassing follows. Produced by Dr. Luke, Cirkut, and The Smeezingtons (Bruno Mars is a co-writer), the track is as solid as anything else, if less standout than the previous three `heavy-hitters.' Regardless, Lambert sounds exceptional and the production is nothing short of fantastic, as to be expected.  \\"Kickin' In\\" is a stronger cut, opening with a nice odd-ball synth contributed by Pharrell.  After the synth lasts for about :30, the groove of the cut kicks in in stable form.  Again, Pharrell's production work is top-rate, the songwriting is manic yet clever, and Lambert's falsetto works well in tandem with his natural voice.<br /><br />\\"Naked Love\\" features production work by Josh Abraham and Oligee once more, and smartly allows for room for Lambert's voice to shine on the verses.  The refrain is `larger than life,' featuring standard techno-infused pop a la 2012.  \\"Naked Love\\" does not stand out as much as the earlier cuts, but it is both solid and effective. Similarly, \\"Pop That Lock\\" is not the album's most distinct number, but certainly well-produced (Robert Marvin & Josh Crosby) and enjoyable.  A slithering synth opens the cut with a predictable, yet grooving four-on-the-floor beat following to buttress the cut.  The most memorable line from Lambert comes from the second verse: \\"Work...you don't gotta stress this/got `em feeling restless/show `em how it's done...\\"<br /><br />Promo/buzz single \\"Better Than I Know Myself\\" slows the tempo of the album down slowly and reunites Lambert with master producers Dr. Luke, Cirkut, and addsAmmo to the mix.  The restraint that \\"Better Than Myself\\" initially exudes contrasts the manic, snarling nature of \\"Pop That Lock.\\" Of course by the chorus, Dr. Luke & Company's signature gargantuan, synth-driven sounds are in full glory and Lambert is `lovin' it' vocally.  \\"Broken English\\" opens with an interesting, edgy timbre, eventually delving into pulsating synths once the track settles in.  Another collaborative `match made in heaven,' Lester Mendez's production suits Lambert's extraordinary vocals perfectly.  \\"Underneath,\\" produced by Josh Crosby and Robert Marvin, possess a dark, minor key and is absent of percussive backdrop until the end of the cut.  Lambert sells this dark ballad with passion.<br /><br />\\"Chokehold\\" contrasts the slower tempo of \\"Underneath\\" in favor of a groovy, dark-driven dance cut.  As always, the refrain is catchy and both well-executed and well-written.  \\"Outlaws of Love\\" closes the standard edition rather restrained at first. By the second verse, a hip-hop/rock groove buttresses the cut.  The bridge may be most alluring, delivering a haunting, mysterious moment from the singer.  Three bonus cuts grace the deluxe edition  (\\"Runnin',\\" \\"Take Back,\\" and \\"Nirvana.\\"  None of the three stand out to the degree of the standard edition's best tracks, making perhaps the standard edition's package most advantageous for the `casual' fan.<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B006MVJ2L4 Trespassing (Deluxe)]] is a stronger effort than Lambert's debut by all means.  While Lambert may not have a huge assist by a single the likes of \\"Whattaya Want From Me,\\" he does have the assists of great producers, songwriters, and overall well written records.  Vocally, Lambert sounds better than ever and his vocal prowess translates better this time around.  Highly recommended.o the mix.

B002XTBE8I|5.0|He is the greatest lyricist of all-time, how can any of his albums be bad? Nobody can play with words the way this guy can.
B007BFZGAG|3.0|Tyga's first effort [[ASIN:B00195BMF2 No Introduction]] did very little to connect the MC to a mainstream audience.  Sure his song \\"Coconut Juice\\" was a minor hit, but not enough to captivate or allure a `hardcore' hip-hop audience.  On his Cash Money debut [[ASIN:B005TZFZ9W Careless World: Rise of the Last King]], Tyga elevates his profile to more lascivious heights. While Tyga's relatively `clean' image needed a more `adult' lift, at times on Careless World Tyga comes off as sounding desperate and `over-the-top.' Throughout the course of Careless World, despite some of it's overwrought sensual tone and overuse of profanity for profanity's sake, there are some enjoyable, solid moments that easily eclipse Tyga's previous work, no questions asked.<br /><br />\\"Careless World\\" opens the effort with Tyga quasi-singing/rapping throughout.  Tyga's rhymes are a `lift' from previous showings given the fact his rhymes are more aggressive and overt.  Around the 2:15 mark, the production takes an unexpected change-of-pace that catches the listener by surprise.  Following the quasi-intro cut \\"Careless World\\" is \\"Lil Homie,\\" produced and featuring Pharrell Williams.  The production is archetypical of Pharrell, featuring the producer's signature ear-bending harmonic scheme and futuristic drums.  The cut is not particularly revolutionary per say, but is overall very effective if nothing else.  The more overtly titled \\"Mutha***** Up\\" maybe the album's first truly great number.  The production is superb and the uncredited vocal sample (\\"crank this [bleep] up\\") anchors the entirety of the cut.  Nicki Minaj's guest spot is quite effective, finding the female MC as foul and liberated as Tyga himself.<br /><br />Following \\"Echoes Interlude,\\" a sound cut in \\"Do It All\\" appears.  The production by Jess Jackson is solid, solidified even more by elements of \\"Citoyen 120\\" being incorporated.  Tyga's rhymes are compelling, which is a strong point considering the five minute duration of the cut.  The highlight aside from production is definitely the hook: \\"Aw Awww, we've been through it all/I know I broke your heart once before/but I'm done/Aw, Aww, Aww, tell me what's wrong/I know I never listen, but just listen to this song...if they don't do it, we gon' do it all...\\" \\"I'm Gone,\\" featuring Big Sean is another lengthy cut that features production reminiscent of Drake's music and producer Noah '40' Shebib as opposed to producer Boi-1da.  Tyga's rhymes remain aggressive, despite the tame nature of the production.  \\"For the Fame\\" features yet another big-name collaborator via Chris Brown and also features up-and-coming singer Wynter Gordon.  The results are enjoyable, somewhat predictable and non-revolutionary.  The production work is enthusiastic (Jess Jackson) and Brown carries this enthusiasm through his vocals.<br /><br />Another interlude (\\"Birdman Interlude\\") interrupts one of the album's strongest showings \\"Potty Mouth,\\" which happens to lead a slew of valedictory cuts. \\"Potty Mouth,\\" which features Busta Rhymes, is true to title as Tyga keeps it `100' in the nastiest way possible with his lewd rhymes.  The hook is incredibly catchy and matches the epic, sound nature of the production: \\"I get money, I make money/I take money, them b-s want it from me cause I'm /I'm `bout whatever, I'm bout whatever/I'm with whatever, man I do it, do it better... and I got a potty mouth...\\" Busta Rhymes slays it when a change of pace within the production materializes around the 3:40.  The equally alluring and lewd \\"Faded\\" follows featuring Lil Wayne, finding Tyga delving and delivering every inappropriate sexual reference he can .  The hook is simplistic as is the overall production and scope of the song, but is catchy and effective. Lil Wayne is in good company with Tyga, delivering just as many overt lines.  \\"Rack City,\\" a mega hit given it's simplistic, slinky sounding production work, just adds to the momentum evaded by Tyga.  \\"Rack City\\" ultimately lacks substance, but the sound and `clubby' vibe bode well in its favor.<br /><br />\\"Black Crowns\\" caps off a capable cell of songs with sort of an old-school hip-hop sound that's been slightly updated.  The cut includes a built in `outro' at the 4:17 mark which makes it so long.  The hook is a selling point: \\"All I see is black crowns/king me `cause this is my time now/so all you other [bleep] bow down/`cause all I see is black crowns, black crowns...\\" \\"Celebration,\\" featuring T-Pain has more flashy, modern production work than \\"Black Crowns,\\" but the cut ultimately is one of the least memorable showings from Careless World. T-Pain comes over as `so last year' with his contributions.  Thankfully, Chris Richardson assisted \\"Far Away\\" not only puts the album back on the right track, but it also finds Tyga less explicit and more `credible.' The change of pace may alluded back to Tyga's \\"Coconut Juice\\" days, but that is not so bad with solid rhymes from the MC and a boost from American Idol alum Richardson.  Following yet another pointless interlude, \\"This Is Like\\" features soulful vocals from Robin Thicke.  The production is `chill' making \\"This Is Like\\" a sound, though not revolutionary listen.<br /><br />\\"Kings & Queens,\\" featuring Wale & Nas has promise at first, but grows a bit to sleepy and boring.  Thankfully J Cole's assist on \\"Let It Show,\\" which samples Gamble & Huff penned Billy Paul classic \\"Let's Make a Baby\\" redirects any dying momentum.  The hook is a selling point for sure: \\"While my emotion grows, I still won't let it show/I still won't let it show/even if I'm broke, I still won't let it show...\\" \\"Love Game\\" is a solid cut, with its biggest drawback being its length at nearly eight minutes.  The slower, grinding tempo is a selling point for sure. \\"Lay You Down,\\" featuring Lil Wayne is a `B' cut at best while the Marsha Ambrosius featured \\"Light Dreams\\" is a B- with very `little' to this cut.  \\"Still Got It\\" featuring Drake, a bonus cut isn't too shabby, but also not the greatest.  Of the two bonus cuts, \\"Make It Nasty\\" is arguably the best, in the vein of \\"Faded\\" or \\"Rack City.\\"<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B005TZFZ9W Careless World: Rise of the Last King]] is a decent album, though flawed.  The deluxe version at nearly ninety minutes is bloated, some of the cuts are too overt, and perhaps the ordering and arrangement of tracks on the album could be reworked.

1449382673|3.0|This book was very enjoyable to read. The format is great. Head First books are a wonderful concept. I love the silly pictures, the silly dialogue, etc. And I like how the book attempts to go through my own thought process, a beginner's thought process, in solving problems--and then shows you the right way to do it. Well, A right way, as there is more than one correct solution.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the first half of the book but found myself getting progressively more confused. By the time I was at the second half of the book, I was completely lost. I skimmed the second half of the book to see what I was missing out on and did not retain much. Obviously some background knowledge is needed for the second half of the book.<br /><br />First half: intro to Python, lists, modules of functions, dealing with errors, saving data to files, working with data, bundling code with data.<br />Second half: web development, small devices (like Android), managing data/input, hosting your app on the web, complexity, etc.<br /><br />There was only one example with lists at the beginning that didn't make sense to me. Beyond that, it was just clear I didn't have enough background. Overall, a great book, but it's extremely beginner for the first half and then jumps to intermediate at least for the second half, which is an odd combination. I wonder if they even knew that's what they were doing.

B005LAIIS0|4.0|The presence of Liam Neeson is main reason that I wanted to see The Grey. I've become an even bigger fan since I bought Taken and saw that he could even bring depth to a character in an action movie. Neeson seems authentic in just about any role, even if he's just providing the voice for an animated character.<br /><br />In The Grey, Neeson is clearly the main character. We see him contemplate suicide at the start of the movie, before deciding against it. The story involves a group of oil workers stationed in Alaska. Ottway (Neeson) is a marksman who keeps the workers safe from wolves when they are at work. He carries a rifle and is always watching for possible attacks. He has a low opinion of most of the workers and doesn't enjoy having to spend time with them.<br /><br />Ottway's world changes when he's involved in a plane crash. The oil workers encounter bad weather and turbulence, and the resulting crash leaves most of the group dead or dying. It's here that Ottway assumes a leadership role without being asked or voted in. Like the wolves he kills, his instincts cannot be denied. In the surviving group, it quickly becomes clear that he's the alpha. Ottway has a way of facing facts and helping others to accept the inevitable. This is perfectly illustrated when one of the crash victims dies in front of him. Ottway calms him and takes charge of the situation when the other men are incapable of deciding how to handle it.<br /><br />The movie partly reminded me of The Edge, starring Anthony Hopkins. Although this group of survivors is larger, and they are hunted by wolves instead of a bear, the terrain is similar. The Grey seems realistic and doesn't idealize the situation in any way. The men are in danger and fighting for their lives, and their actions are plausible. If you are facing a pack of wolves unarmed, your chances of survival are not good. The Grey doesn't shy away from that fact.<br /><br />Action scenes are infrequent, but have considerable impact. How would you try to survive if you had no food or shelter and had to make your way through freezing snow? Would it be best to try to make your own way back to civilization, or stay at the crash site and hope for rescue?<br /><br />The movie explores the characters of several of the crash survivors and we come to understand their individual choices. The setting is grim, so don't expect a heartwarming story. This is real.<br /><br />I didn't know what to expect from The Grey, but it left me somewhat surprised. The body count was definitely higher than expected, and I assumed that the group would generate more internal conflict than it did. That said, I did feel as though I was a part of the quest for survival and I was engaged at all times. Neeson carried the movie, but three or four supporting characters were important to the story.<br /><br />If you enjoy experiencing things that you are unlikely to witness in your real life, The Grey is a compelling story which transports you to an unfamiliar setting. If you are sensitive to watching characters get picked off one at a time, it might not be for you.<br /><br />The Blu-ray offers a pleasing presentation. The audio is just about perfect, and you'll feel involved in scenes such as the plane crash. The picture quality is also very good, but sometimes appears intentionally grainy to heighten the effect of being lost in a bleak, snowy wilderness.uld you try to survive if you had no food or shelter and had to make your way through freezing snow?

0307352145|4.0|This is a great read but I do think Susan has missed a topic to which an entire chapter could have been dedicated and that is the Age of Personality and its contribution to the GFC. And this is how it goes.<br />Prior to Dale Carnegie and the growth of the Age  of Personality peoples guidance in matters of personal finance were provided by the hallmarks of character. Humility, wisdom, restraint, consequence and fiscal responsibility. You know, all those old fashioned traits that we seem to have less of these days. And then along came Hollywood that from its California base began to question the ideals of the Age of Character with the ideals of the Age of Personality. Loudness, brashness, assertiveness but most of all the notion that appearance was more important than substance. And this is where the problems all began.<br />A whole generation began to believe that appearance had the ability to carry the day. That so long as you looked good, no matter the cost, you would overcome the downside which had been associated with a failure to conform to the disciplines of the Age of Character. These downside consequences included humiliation, personal financial loss, marriage breakup and so on. These were the very consequences that the tenants of the Age of Character had been designed to avoid.<br />So along comes the age of Personality and that coupled with the explosion in available credit saw this new generation now genuinely believe that it was more important to look successful than to be successful. That to be seen driving a brand new Mercedes even if it was bought on borrowed money, was more important than driving a Toyota that had been purchased with saved funds.<br />This new extroverted approach became the norm and in my view led millions of people, particularly less educated and disciplined souls to ramp up their appearance in all aspects of life, from car to home to boat to clothes to gadgets, irrespective of cost. And boring introverted conservatives such as myself just sat and watched waiting for the day that the chickens would come home to roost and the old laws of the Age of Character would return. And sure enough, look what happened. The great Age of Personality and together with it the great spike in bling all came crashing down. And the disciples of the introspective approach to life were finally able to say in their mild understated way'I told you so'. I would have liked to see Susans more indepth take on this observation.

B000A6T1JU|5.0|\\"The Warriors\\" (1979) is perhaps the definitive cult film -- a flick you always enjoy seeing again.<br /><br />The story involves a Coney Island gang that gets wrongly accused of murder and must make it back home from the Bronx, fighting enemy gangs and police all the way.<br /><br />The 'feel' of the movie is part surreal, part realistic and wholly captivating!<br /><br />\\"The Warriors\\" is just a great flick full of memorable scenes and lines. I really love the ending where the remaining Warriors walk down the Coney Island beach while the DJ offers them a tribute song -- \\"Survival In the City\\" by Walsh/Eagles.<br /><br />I also like the fact that the Warriors is a racially mixed gang -- a group of lost souls in the urban jungle, banded together perhaps for no other reason except for the obvious fact that they're from the same urban cesspool and have a need to belong.<br /><br />I stated that the movie is part realistic, but only in the sense that it never becomes campy; the creators and cast properly take it all quite serious. Other than that, the flick showcases a mesmerizing fantastical New York City, that could never be mistaken for reality.

B005723JSQ|5.0|This is the first Sophie Kinsella book Ive read and I look forward to reading<br />more of her books.  It was abit confusing at first, but when I got into the<br />book, I really liked it.
0446572993|5.0|The majority of the truly successful writers of thrillers, are consistent in style and voice.  In his latest, Baldacci molds his writing to the syncopated character of the assassin. Each page feels like a car chase as the author weaves one of his best all time stories.  In my opinion, any reviewer who felt that this novel was worth less than five stars may have just been angry that he or she stayed up too late at night finishing the book.<br /><br />Marvin McIntyre
B002Q1YDLI|4.0|This is the second Emily Giffen book I've read.  The first being \\"Something Borrowed.\\"  I loved that book so much.  Since I'm always a sucker for sequels, I had to read Something Blue.<br /><br />I'm giving it 4 stars because I think she wallowed in the results of the first book too much.  I'm sure part of that is necessary for a sequel when some may not have not read the first book.  It was downright depressing to read as her life unraveled.  However, all of that made the progression of the story that much better.<br /><br />The supporting characters were a little hard to follow at times.  Ethan seemed so much more agreeable than his opinionated version in the first book.  As a first person narrative I realize it is hard to cover the transitions of the other characters.<br /><br />However, the ending completely surprised me in a good way.  Even as it was clearly approaching, I was unable to put the book away.  I will definitely be reading another Emily Giffen novel.
B0000CABJ1|5.0|It is amazing how the world was shaken today with the very sad announcement that Donna Summer died at the too young age of 63 from cancer.  No matter what the musical preference of today's audience is - jazz, classical, blues, rock and roll, hip hop, new age - it is probable that many of us shared the magic of Donna Summer as she reigned as Queen of Disco in the 1970s.  hearing of her passing brings back memories of that wild decade, the end of the Vietnam war, the rise of disco dancing and partying through the night to forget the state of the state of a world gone insane.  She simply made us, if only for the duration of a song, forget the bad things and dance away to the good vibes.<br /><br />Though there are many collections of her music now available, this recording holds on to the many true golden hits she gave us: Last Dance, Hot Stuff, She Works Hard for the Money, Love to Love You Baby, On the Radio, Bad Girls, the great `No More Tears (Enough is Enough)', and no one will ever be able to erase the memories of her special disco version of MacArthur Park.  And there are more of her goodies here, but the ones mentioned seem synonymous with that aspect of the 70s and 80s that made becoming adults a bit easier.<br /><br />We are losing goddesses too frequently - Whitney Houston, Donna Summer et al. Will things ever be the same? Probably not, but Donna Summer left us with profoundly felt memories. Ave atque vale.  Grady Harp, May 12
B0054PSY2W|5.0|This story is built around the \\"Odyssey\\" by Homer, and although the following of it is very loose it does not take away from the fact that this is a great film. I would hope you have some idea of what the \\"Odyssey\\" was like, but if you don't this movie is about a man's journey to return to his home. It is filled with adventure and in the case of \\"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\\" lots of modern day comedy. I would say it doesn't offer too much for children, and does have some light violence (animal killing and guns) and some occasional swearing. This is why it is rated PG-13<br /><br />Overall the movie is very entertaining and I enjoyed it back when it was first released and I was 15-16, and the most recent time I watched it which was last night.
B0047T70VW|5.0|Bought this on a whim because I was looking for a new Sci-Fi author to read (having read all the ones I was already familiar with).  Wasn't expecting much because most of the unknowns I've tried on Amazon Kindle weren't very good, but Bacigalupi is great! In addition to Windup Girl, I've also read Ship Breakers and The Drowned Cities.  Windup Girl is not really part of the series, but it takes place in the same world, just different location and different characters.  I think it might have been his book in the drowned cities world. The other two are in series, though, with common characters. Looking forward to his next book.  Now if I could just pronounce his name...

I expect in 3D they are even better.<br /><br />The story however is pretty ordinary as is the acting. I am not that keen on Brendan Fraser.<br /><br />I would suggest if you are going to see it, see it with the kids.  They will like it. Make sure it is blue ray
0762777931|5.0|I love love love this book.  Kris Carr has an uplifting attitude which comes through in this book and is very empowering for her readers.  I am a dietetic student and I found most of the information in this book to be scientifically sound.  Not everything, but most.

0446572993|5.0|Once again David Baldacci has written a stunning good book. The lead character is<br />a man named Will Robie. He is a contract killer for the U.S. government. Robie di8sposes of people that the FBI,CIA and other agencies want out of the way. He kills an international drug lord and four of his bodyguards. He next disposes of a<br />Saudi Prince(named Prince Khalid bin Talal). In his ext assignment he is given the task of killing a mother with two children. Robie balks at this order. After dodging<br />several government assassins he decides to ride a bus to New York. Here he encounters 14 yearold Lisa Getty. He and Lisa escape a bomb on the bus. He then becomes her caretaker. He is cleared of ignoring the previous assignment. He then begins a vigorous investigation which links up Lisa Getty's parents up to an old army unit. This spreads into a full blown conspiracy. Robie has to stop an assination attempt. He also discovers that one of his targets was not really killed.<br />This is an action packed book that you will find hard to put down.

0345803485|3.0|If you wish to read about someone in an S&M type of relationship, a much more deftly written erotic novel is Elizabeth McNeil's \\"Nine and a Half Weeks\\" which was made into movie in the 1980s starring Mickey Rourke and Kim Basinger. McNeil's book is a memoir - but that's not why it's much more compelling. The reason that Nine and a Half Weeks is more gripping is because Ms. McNeil is a much more skillful writer than Ms. James.<br /><br />After all the buzz surrounding \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\", I borrowed it from a friend. I was surprised at how vastly over-rated it is. I think the reason it's getting so much attention is because this topic is not generally explored in mainstream fiction. It's an interesting premise, but the book is rather poorly written. Ana and businessman Christian Grey have about as much depth as a pair of paper dolls (yes, I'm dating myself - if you were born in the 1970s or later, you've probably never seen a paper doll).<br /><br />If you read the Chapter 1 excerpt on here, you'll notice that the women who work for Mr. Grey speak in an overly stiff and formal manner that sounds unnatural. I learned later that Ms. James is British. Once I knew that, it made much more sense as to why the characters' speech sounded odd. Experts say 'write what you know'; Ms. James should have set this book in the UK.<br /><br />Another point of contention - throughout the book, Ana is continually shocked by Grey's desire to inflict pain on her. Really??? After being smacked the first 10 times, she still thinks 'wow, he said that since I broke one of the rules on the list he gave me, he's going to take me to the Red Room where he keeps all his whips and canes and belts. Is he really going to do that?' Unless Ana is incapable of forming new memories, she couldn't possibly continue to be surprised by his behavior/desires.<br /><br />This book violates most of the basic rules of Fiction Writing 101 that I've studied in Creative Writing classes.<br />Ms. James uses cliches like they're going out of style (yes, I realize \\"going out of style\\" IS a cliche.) Other tips I learned from my Professors:  When writing dialogue, use the dialogue tag \\"said\\" 80% of the time. For example, instead of saying someone stammered something, SHOW it. I threw together 2 sample sentences to illustrate types of dialogue tags:<br /><br />USE \\"I g-gu-guess so,\\" said Sandy<br />NOT -- \\"I guess so\\", sputtered Sandy.<br /><br />Also, since this book is written in 1st Person, Ms. James could have easily allowed us to hear Ana's thoughts. Instead she employs a VERY corny technique: Ana has what she calls her \\"inner goddess\\", who does things like drop to her knees and clasp her hands as she implores Ana to give in to her urges to be submissive to Christian Grey. This reminded me of the old Bugs Bunny cartoons where Bugs has a \\"mini-me\\" Angel on one shoulder and a miniature devil-like Bugs on his other shoulder, each trying to convince Bugs to do what they want. I couldn't shake the image of a little Tinkerbell-like character fluttering around Ana gesturing at her. I began to wonder if there would be a big twist at the end that would possibly reveal that Ana either:<br />A) Suffers from Visual and/or Auditory Hallucinations<br />OR<br />B) Suffers from Multiple Personality Disorder<br />(an old term - I think the disorder is currently referred to as Disassociative Disorder.)<br /><br />Finally, to show how truly horrible the quality of writing is, here's a cleaned up version similar to a sentence used by the author: \\"he will probably want to beat seven shades of &#!+ (crap) out of me.\\"  When I read that, I laughed aloud. I re-read it because I couldn't believe that an editor let that one slide. The sentence sounded like something a 15-year-old boy who is a C student would write.<br /><br />The thin plot (I use the term VERY loosely) simply serves as a conduit to carry the reader from one sexual encounter to the next. I cannot imagine why this \\"story\\" needs to be dragged out over the course of 3 books. Apparently, the publishing company believes it will make more money if it's a trilogy. Must be some sort of \\"Twilight/Hunger Games\\" effect - everything is better in threes. In summary, there is ONE shade of Grey that gets rehashed in 50 slightly varying ways. Before long, any eroticism wears off because what was shocking in the first few chapters does not continue to shock the reader.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|First off, I want to point out that I loved the first book and enjoyed the second book nearly as much. But WHY, Collins, WHY did you do this to us on the final book? Like all the other one and two-star reviews explain , she develops (well, more like creates for all but Finnick) a bunch of characters and then spends the rest of the book killing them off with no feeling whatsoever - &#34; whoops , ___ happened to ___ and now ___ is dead.&#34; What's with that ? No explanation whatsoever, no feeling. (Of course, with most of the characters you wouldn't care anyway. )<br /><br />And the whole love triangle thing - very poorly developed. We all knew what was going to happen - Gale was going to leave and Katniss would love Peeta no matter what after realizing her true love. I just thought it would be a thought-out (although obvious) ending that kind of worked. But no (and after reading the rest of the book, I should have figured this out) - the book just ends in a hastily-written ending - just a few paragraphs summingit up very briefly.<br /><br />The characters that survive this whole deal, too - they've been completely destroyed. By the end of the book, I hated all the characters because they had no feeling - like vegetables. Even Katniss was like a vegetable. Even Peeta, the one character I actually cared a little about, was like a vegetable by the end.<br /><br />There are many other parts of this book I'm angry about, but they're covered in other reviews.<br /><br />On a scale from 1 to 5, 1 being disgusting and 5 being awesome, even though Book 1 is around 4.5, Mockingjay is hovering around the -1 mark. It'd be better if Collins killed off Katniss or, better yet, ended the series with CF. I realize that it's supposed to be horribe. I just think that Collins overdid it on this book.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Wow, I purchased the trilogy from Amazon Kindle after reading lots of female reviews.  Not what I usually read and I read 4-5 books a month but I decided to see what all the buzz was about.  After reading 5 screens on the Kindle I was hooked.  I felt as I was right there with her, hunting, talking and her thoughts.  This book was so well written I read book one in one day, I could not sleep, I needed to read what was going to happen next.  Book one is a master piece.  The other two books were good, but book one did it for me.
B00000IMTH|5.0|I'm beginning to think I have bad taste in music. How this band never absolutely blew up I'll never know. This may be the most under-rated band of all time. Love love love this band and this is their best recording (In my opinion). Most would say its Rising but I think they were more polished here, and more material to enjoy. Rising only has like 6 tunes. If you haven't discovered Rainbow, particulary RJD Rainbow, you're in for a treat. For the rest of you, buy all their recordings and relive the good days of music.
0553801473|1.0|Such promise in A Game of Thrones.  So much anticipation in A Clash of Kings.  The warning signals came for me in A Storm of Swords: the ratio of story versus \\"rich fabric\\" was reversed; and it was perpetuated in A Feast of Crows.  I was prepared to abandon the series right then, but didn't Martin promise to make it right in A Dance With Dragons?  Instead, Martin wrote as if he had no idea where his runaway project was going. Oh, and the HBO screenplay is still worse.

Once I got \\"into\\" it, I couldn't put it down!
0345803485|5.0|The book was really good. Now to. I respond to the negative comments. I understand that it is unrealistic for him to make 100,000 an hour. He does sound controlling. But this book is a fantasy. That's what I loved about it. Dont we all want a man that can provide security, now a days we have to split the bill (i dont) but i hear my friends say they do. He protects her, he is acting like her man. His issue with food is that he was neglected as a child and he feels the need to give that love to Ana. As women, dont tell me that not once in your life, you gave everything for your man. Just when he went to go see her at her mom's house, we all know deep inside we are thinking, AWWW MY BABY came to see me. I liked that it dealt with commitment issues. Ana constantly questioning every move. Dont we try to analyze our relationships all the time? Sometimes after being disappointed in love, life, or childhood issues, we have issues in our future. He created a contract. How many times our emotions take over and we lose control? Also the whole email thing vs. text. they change the subject title to make a point. They are flirting and trying to be cute. when they repeat phrases it is because thats their thing (biting lip, twitching palm, smart mouth, fifty, pouting). I say give it a try, it is like knowing the inside of a relationship. Things that we dont tell people about our relationship-because not one relationship is perfect.
B007549W62|2.0|Take a nuclear attack, add the scared residents of an apartment building. Lock them in a basement and add paranoia, sex and lots of violence and you have The Divide. I liked the idea of this film and thought it had a lot of promise. Unfortunately that is not the film we have here. There seems to be no point or reason to this film. Things seem to happen just to happen. Not to further the story. And there is not a likeable character in this film. I suggest skipping this film and watching something better like Take Shelter.

B007C4ZJ0S|1.0|I was very anxious to see this movie.  Less than 5 minutes into the movie, the excitement came to a screeching halt.  I tried to be optimistic by finding something worthwhile about the movie as it dragged on.  That effort was futile.<br /><br />Horrible movie for so many reasons.  Difficult to choose a place to start.  This movie is so bad it makes real B Movies look like Oscar winners.  The filming and the color indoors...yikes!!!  Almost all of the video shot in a room, had a strong yellow color cast.  That should have been color corrected during post production.  Bad photography all around.  I have personally seen better recorded video on smart phones!<br /><br />The actress is an MMA superstar?!?!?!  Really?!?!?!  Maybe she can prove that, if she is ever cast in another movie.  She got the stuffing knocked out of her in this flick.  Was not fun to watch.  She barely won the handful of fights she was in.<br /><br />And endings...this is one of those movies that has a very disappointing ending.<br /><br />This movie should have been titled: \\"Dumbest Spy Ever.\\"  That is what the main character was.  One stupid mistake after another.  She acted as if it was her first week as a spy.<br /><br />Please do not waste any of your hard earned money on this film.  If you watch it despite my warning, you will wish you had taken my advice.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|Nels Larso Estes PArk, Colorado. Wow, What a great movie. I really enjoyed watching this movie. The cinematography was fantastic and the plot moved along super fast it was over and done and never dragged on like some movies.
0380807343|5.0|Wow. This is one terrific, terrible book! Let me explain...<br /><br />Coraline is about a young girl who likes exploring and finds a hidden door to another world... so far a pretty common premise for a \\"children's book,\\" right? But what's behind the door is what makes Coraline so terrible: the \\"other mother\\" who unlike her real mother pays her lots of attention, cooks good food, and gives her what she wants. But also unlike her real mother, the other mother has buttons for eyes and wants to love Coraline to death.<br /><br />As an adult, I loved this book. I picked it up on a whim, and the story has haunted me for weeks with the clicking, scratching noise of the other mother's hand, and I'm well past the 8+ recommended reading age.  But for kids? It might be too terrible, in the old scary sense of the word.<br /><br />(Note: I wrote more on my blog about adults reading children's books, but I'll omit that here for brevity's sake!)

B001KVZ6HK|4.0|In the 1960s, Marvel Comics pioneered mature storylines for its super heroes, of whom many have been successfully adapted into blockbuster films (Spiderman).  The Avengers were a group with individual icons like Iron Man who had already established identities contrary to The Fantastic Four and X Men.  Marvel began to feature stand alone films that methodically built this core of characters, and several years later, it has culminated in The Avengers, a thoroughly entertaining adventure that never fails to engage and `marvel' its intended audience.  As orchestrated by versatile writer/director and comic book fan Joss Whedon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer), the results set a high standard in filmic super heroics; it's nirvana, a comic lover's dream come true.<br /><br />The Tesseract is a cube with unknown powers and coveted by the fiendish Loki, Thor's half brother.  Kept for study by SHIELD, the elite security agency, (and once possessed by The Red Skull in Captain America: The First Avenger), the cube can open a doorway to another dimension.  When Loki steals the cube to unleash a demon army and conquer the earth, the SHIELD agents are no match for his supernatural powers.  What to do?  Who ya gonna call?<br /><br />Well, there's nothing like `puttin' the band together' for the first time.  Assembled by SHIELD director Nick Fury (Samuel Jackson) and aided by Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg), the Avengers Initiative sought to collect special operatives in the event of an insurmountable threat that was beyond human response.  These Avengers comprise of six extraordinary individuals: an otherworldly warrior, Thor (Chris Hemsworth), a genetically enhanced superhuman from the past, Steve Rogers AKA Captain America (Chris Evans), a meek scientist, Dr. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) and his anger induced, gamma radiated monster, The Hulk; inventor Tony Stark, in super armor as Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), and two SHIELD agents, master archer Hawkeye, Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner), andtop assassin Black Widow, Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson).<br /><br />When Loki's legion of soldiers descend on Manhattan, it's `Avengers Assemble' time.  Drawn by remarkable circumstances and led by Captain America, it's teamwork at its finest as The Avengers battle these nasty hordes to save the earth.<br /><br />After initially bickering and fighting each other, it is fascinating to witness such disparate personalities coalesce into a fighting unit as they flow from self to selflessness.  This film can stand on its own for newbies not familiar with the previous films, but it certainly does not hurt to have seen Captain America: The First Avenger, Thor, Iron Man, and The Incredible Hulk.  Whedon and company neatly tie the threads of those films together with sufficient focus given to each hero's personal life.<br /><br />We learn some interesting background on Romanoff and Barton, who you think would be outmatched by their superhuman colleagues, but they more than hold their own and figure prominently in the explosive climax.  Rogers, the honorable, idyllic soldier, has to adjust to a world like a modern day Rip Van Winkle.  Dr. Banner keeps his anger at bay, but what will that mean for the Avengers if it can't be controlled?  Whedon also cleverly includes familiar supporting characters e.g. Stark's assistant, Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow), from other the films.<br /><br />All the stars perform ably including Tom Hiddleston who is appropriately devious as Loki.  Downey, who clearly improvised much of his dialogue, has a rousing, good time. Jackson embodies Fury as the manipulative leader who does whatever it takes to safeguard humanity.<br /><br />This is the third movie version of The Hulk, and while Ruffalo does a very good job as the sensitive and haunted Banner, his alter ego beast actually behaves so unpredictably that some of his actions become comedic and the results are a riot.  To say more would spoil some hilarious moments.  The filmmakers got this Hulkright.<br /><br />A couple things don't quite add up like how does The Hulk decide to be a do-gooder at a critical moment?  Who is the mysterious Council (resembling the Syndicate from The X Files) that SHIELD answers to, and what are their intentions?  There are, however, nice touches like the Stark building in the finale and what is left of its logo as an obvious tribute to the Avengers.  When the grand showdown is imminent, there is a marvelous circular shot of the Avengers that is iconic.<br /><br />When the evil army attacks, one is reminded of Ghostbusters and the apocalyptic scenes of Superman II and any Transformers film.  Whedon, though, never forgets to include intimate moments and details.  Although each Avenger gets a heroic moment to shine, the film never loses sight of personal loss amid the spectacle.  The film is also about self sacrifice, and people do perish in this film including a major character.<br /><br />Despite a 143 minute running time, the film is full of subplots and well-paced action, and every bit of the enormous, effects laden budget is on the big screen. The Avengers is perhaps not the best super hero film ever made, The Dark Knight being the apex, but it is the most complete, entertaining, multi-hero film to date.  The question now is what do you do for an encore, and how can anyone hope to top let alone match this achievement?  It would require the abilities of a James Cameron or Peter Jackson, or maybe studio executives can plead for Whedon's return.  Let's hope so. (Do stay for the end credits for a double dose treat.)

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome. There are some stories that stay with you forever. Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" was like that for me. This trilogy did the same. Although completely different in content, time or space, it painted such vivid pictures that it will stay with me forever. There are lots of sadness in this story, but also happy ones. I even found myself laughing out loud at some of the clever moments in here. And in the end good does triumph over evil, making it satisfying. But do yourself a favour and get all 3 in the trilogy before you start reading, because once you start, you won't be able to stop.<br /><br />I have to disagree with some readers who thought that Book 1 was better than 2, and 2 better than 3. I enjoyed them all, and I especially enjoyed the clever recurrence of some sort of game in all 3 novels. The playing field, the rules, the stakes and the allies simply changed with every book, and the heroine herself changed with it.
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|This is a great, simple to use product.  The only thing I would say is to watch some YouTube videos before trying it- because the instructions are not that great.  I found that once I watched a few videos, I was able to understand what I really needed during the process.  I broke 5 bottles before making my first one a clean cut.... the 5th one was done right after I went through YouTube.<br /><br />This is a good starter kit...  buy it!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was such a good read I didn't want to put it down.....sorry when it was over...it left me wanting more can't waith to read the next 2 books. It was very well written it captivated me from the start very emotionally charged and the author makes you love the characters.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|Fun for the whole family. Some times the energy won't refill if you are not on the game. Otherwise, it's a great time killer
0345803493|5.0|I know alot of people are saying that this book is pornographic. Not so!!<br />This/these books are about the relationship of an innocent woman and a 'dysfunctional' man.How many of us are not 'dysfunctional' at some times in our lives? And then someone comes along and shows us the error of our ways?<br />I love the fact that someone has had the 'grit' to finally write about this troubled time in one's life. Even if you don't go as far as Christian, there have been deep 'secrets' in all of our lives at one time or another.<br />It will 'enlighten' those who read these books as to some of what goes on behind closed doors. If you have never been to this side of life, it does exist. Perhaps those who say it's porn are those who never have been 'aware' that this kind of lifestyle does exist. Perhaps also, they have not 'experienced' enough of life to really understand 'dysfunctional'.<br />There are many layers to these books, not just what you read and how you percieve them. Be open~minded and enjoy the love story for what it is. Stop trying to say that you don't have secrets as 'bad' as the ones in the books.<br />You all know that if your secrets came out, they would be best~sellers too!<br />Give this story a chance to 'open' your mind and learn!

B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is awesome!  It teaches you how to study the Bible, how to memerise scripture, and how to meditate and pray! this is the best Bible app yet!!!!!
B006CS7UXO|5.0|This collection of b-sides from the past 15 years allows us to reacquaint ourselves with rare gems. Rare in the sense that fans may already have many (if not most of them) in cd singles, and so do not get to listen to them that often after their release. CD singles after all have a rather shorter lifespan than full albums. So this collection, just like Alternative did few years back allows us to revisit this body of work, and boy (pun intended) is this great!<br /><br />In comparison to Alternative though, which showcased the Boys during the commercial peak, I believe that this collection is much more valuable because it showcases a stunning collection of songs from their less commercial period. So, it allows us to revisit songs that were probably less heard than their Alternative counterparts, and the fact that they are all outstanding speaks volumes.<br /><br />CD 2 is probably the better of the two, signaling the Boys' return to their standard electronic sound (after the experiment that was Release). Songs like Blue on Blue, Transparent, Gin an Jag, Up and Down, Always, could all have been a-sides on their own right. And of course the rather well-known by now We're the Pet Shop Boys is simply stunning. The only thing left out is the material from the Christmas CD EP, which would have been a nice bonus for the people who do not already have it.<br /><br />With the outstanding early release of the song Invisible from their forthcoming Fall 2012 album the Boys show that they continue riding the wave of artistic (and to a certain extent commercial too) rejuvenation that was ushered in by Yes. Thanks for the music!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This series of books was an excellent read. I enjoyed the progression of the story through to an interesting end. I would highly encourage anyone who enjoyed the movie to read the entire series, you get a better insight into the characters and the author is great at describing a very bleak future if things do not change. I truly enjoyed this series.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|The fact that it was free made me not have very high hopes for this, but I was pleasantly surprised. Great Mario type game, good graphics, doesn't freeze. Its a great timekiller.

B00377V6J2|4.0|Awesome music and really a treat to see two legends of the blues guitar perfuming together.  The only drawback is that some of the music sounds like it was recorded in my garage.  I suppose that is because it was done in a TV studio and not a recording studio.  I do like the CD and I would recommend it as a piece of music history if nothing else.
B006VA57CY|5.0|My wife and I were hooked on the very first episode.  To find a program that we both like is unusual, but to find a series that totally captivates us both is unheard of!  Bravo!  We can't wait for Season Three.
0307887898|3.0|Eric Ries provides good material for those looking for the basics of staring a business.  If Mark Zuckenberg can score with Facebook, imagine what you might be able to do with a little guidance and luck!!<br /><br />The book covers the basics but offers contemporary content which is important so you are not reading material which is irrelevant in today's business climate.<br /><br />This is a good book to add to your library.  The only drawback is I wish there were more examples, although those presented are sufficient for most beginners.

B0076L9W9Q|4.0|I honestly don't know why so many people are shocked by this album.. I seen this coming a mile away. First off This Review is gunna be long. Halestorm continues what they have been doing before this album.<br /><br />They might do better next time but they will never live up to the hype around them as things stand in my opinnion...<br /><br />Also this album is highlited by the previously resleased [[ASIN:B0070R9494 Hello, It's Mz. Hyde [Explicit]]]<br />I Can see these songs being played live alot for along time With songs such as:<br /><br />Love Bites (So Do I) - This Song Matches her perfectly and is a great song I could see any Female listner loving since even i do.<br />This song is a great way to start off and brings out some of the best I have heard from them yet to date I am hoping for more songs like this only sad thing is for such a great song the solo should be longer then it is... I know it continues in the background but it should be more prominent then it is.<br /><br /> Rock Show - This is the Anthem song that they have been missing whether some people like it or not songs like this are needed for live events and \\"True Rock\\" fans. They will probably play it at every show from now on till the day they are no longer playing music especailly since it has some better guitar then it probably will be credited for...one of the best \\"guitar songs\\" halestorm has other then the EP Covers.<br /><br />Daughters Of Darkness- Another great song to play live and will probably continue to get alot of live rotation. This song shows the ability of the band yet again and hopefully they will create more songs like this in the next album but with longer solos in them.<br /><br />Here's To Us- A nice Ballad, I am a sucker for good ballads sadly considering I am a guy who loves Rock/heavy music the most. I think this is a better song then people give it credit for. A good ballad like this is meant to bring out the emotion of how you feel sometimes. And this song does whatit's intended to do.<br /><br />So if you bought the Ep Hello, It's Mz. Hyde then you should just listen to the samples of the songs Mz. Hyde, I Miss The Misery, Freak Like Me to see if you want them or not. Even though if you are a Halestorm fan then I think you will like them, so just buy them seperately.<br /><br />This Album IMO was not forced upon them as much as some people think for some odd reason... Not saying it wasn't but none of us at this point can prove it one way or the other.<br /><br />I personally like the stuff that has come out after the album[[ASIN:B0026PA05M Halestorm [Expanded]]] with the exception of the song-<br />Bad Romance (lady Gaga \\"Metal/Rock\\" Cover) from the [[ASIN:B004R99VZK ReAniMate: The CoVeRs EP]]<br />I think that everything has been pretty well designed so far and they will hopefully continue to expand the music further with the next album.<br /><br />IF YOU DO NOT WANT A ACTUAL OPINION THEN DON'T CONTINUE READING:<br />Now I want to state that If I Did Not Like This Band I Would Not Be Wasting My Time Writing This Review As I Don't Waste My Time On Bands I Don't Care About. Keep That In Mind Please?<br /><br />Now that's outta the way... my older sister plays the hell outta Halestorm and I honsetly don't mind at all since they aren't a bad band but have stated to her and plenty of others that I support Female acts that rock even as a guy but and here comes the big but...<br /><br />My only problem with this band is they are not as great as alot of people make them out to be...The biggest problem is when I hear about how \\"Lzzy Hale is an amzing guitar player...... Really? Singer ya ok but Guitar Player..? She is good I give her that but Great..? no....<br /><br />A \\"Great Female Guitarist would be Orianthi[[ASIN:B0043OUZW2 Believe (II)]] Or as I have told ppl since around 2008 listen to Damone especaily live... Does anybody listening to Lzzy know Damone..?<br /><br />As a band they were better sadly and they didn't make it further then they did even though Noelle LeBlanc rocks and sings good live along with her playing guitar and --> SOLOS <-- better in one song Especailly When they are LIVE then halestorm themself (not counting the Covers EP) even has put out so far...<br />but yet Orianthi and even more so then her Damone failed to get attention because she would not flaunt her body around and kiss the media and the fans butts enough....<br />which is what music and \\"Entertainment\\" in anything is now.<br /><br />It's fine to show love to fans and for her to be comfortable with her body but it's another to have people who don't care what they actually can perform live as long as she looks hot and the band looks good.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong cuz Lzzy could do alot worse then she does Like how Taylor Momsen of Pretty Wreckless does... I get that but she gets attention for her looks and how she dresses as much as the music it seems. Halestorm is a \\"good band\\" whom is using Lzzy Hale's looks as much as the \\"hard rock\\" style that they are portraying...<br />I will however credit Lzzy that she is getting better all the time and hopefully will be more of a guitarist and not worry about how sexy she can look and do more of a performance live.<br /><br />All it shows though as always is how sad the world is today, so I don't hold it against them or anybody doing music to use it to propel them further since it seems to work so well now.<br />I just wish people would wake up and actually care about how the Bands, Movies, Shows, Products work then how they look...<br />but that will probably never happen.. Continuing<br /><br />Hopefully Halestorm as a band grows to be the great band they have the pottential to be as Lzzy's brother Arejay Hale the Drummer for me is the highlight of them live Instrument wise.<br /><br />If Halestorm does not make it somehow which considering where they are at unless they blow it on the next Album awfully bad I dont see them going anywhere anytime soon.<br />BUTif they did break up or somthing then hopefully Arejay and Lzzy Hale still continue to write music as it would be a shame to lose someone with the talent they have again.<br /><br />Hopefully if you payed attention some of you will have learned a little bit more about music, if not atleast I let my opinion be heard.<br /><br />Thanks for reading if you made it this far.
B007IQX9ZW|2.0|We didn't like this movie.  Slow, boring, and depressing.  I hope this isn't rated well by others.  The chick in this movie is crazy!
B007V2UGPE|4.0|On a whim, I decided to download this game. I am pleased and would recommend ..there are no instructions (or atleast I did not see any)  but the game is straightforward and easy to pick -up. The graphics are pretty cool if you like cartoonish/cute images..sound effects are great and controls on the k.fire are good. There is strategy involved in selecting the right fighters and power-ups.  I downloaded yesterday and I am level 30 ...so it can be played for a while before real money has to be spent.  I would give it 5 stars but for the fact you can only get so far without spending money.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Have you read Twilight? Yes? There you've read Fifty Shades of Grey. It is the exact same thing for a way more mature audience. The way the main characters think, and the things they say reflect the characters by Meyer.<br /><br />Now...if you are all for mind games, abuse and loss of self-rights then go for it. I was not. I love my romance novels but this is no way is a romance novel. No. This is a sick combination of lust, stalking and ridiculous teenage obsession. Even if the characters are not teenagers they sure as heck think like them.<br /><br />The writing is poor, the descriptions explicit (again if you like that then you might enjoy this) and the characters have no depth. There is an attempt of giving the main male protagonist some sort of background story, but I am sorry to say it fails. As a reader I can't say I felt any connection to the characters and I even had to put the book down several times because I was disturbed, bored or annoyed. Perhaps a combination of three.<br /><br />No I don't recommend this book. Borrow it from someone if you want to see what all the fuss is about. I give it a star for bringing information and knowledge to the world of a hush hush sexual act.

0307887960|5.0|I'm a diet skeptic, but when a friend lost 53 pounds on this diet in 6 months, I had to give it a try, and I have already lost 20 pounds in 5 weeks.  I can't believe it, but this diet really works.  You have to follow it - no cheating, but it's not terribly difficult, and the results are wonderful.  Dr. Dukan explains plainly and clearly how it works, what you can and cannot eat and everything you need to do to be successful.  If you have struggled to lose weight in the past, give this a try.  I have another 30 pounds to go, but I feel absolutely confident I can and will succeed.
B00000255F|5.0|For those of us who are now sprout more gray hair than we can count, you can likely remember the first time you set the needle down on the turntable and heard Thunder Road start to unfold. That was 37 years ago, but in some respects it seems like time froze in its tracks.  If you were a fan of the first two albums, then you remember how long we waited for this release. Seemingly forever.  If this music does not touch you, that's fine.  To each their own. But for those of us it does, then we are truly the lucky ones.  Mick once said, \\"It's only rock-n-roll, but I like it.\\" Indeed we do.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I recommend this game for all ages. fun and relaxing. Love it. you'll fall in love with all the animals!
B006JSXYPA|5.0|First I want to say, do not buy the standard edition one if you want to get your moneys worth! Unless of course you don't care for bonus features. I waited for this edition to come out and this is the edition that provides the bonus features! I love bonus features after watching a movie. Now, I love the transformers series and most of all I love michael bay (the director). He just makes the best movies and brings them to life. I'm more than glad that he brought the transformers to life on film. The dark moon movie was at least my favorite of them. It really brings more depth, emotion, and story to this film compared to the others. Like for example: the second one was just all about the biggest baddest movie ever and trying to go from the biggest transformer to the smallest. I think Bay just got lost along the way with all that excitement lol. Transformers is a great movie and would recommend anyone who hasn't seen it yet.
B006PTZNSY|5.0|I love this cd, variety at it's finest. Rap, Dance, R&B, Mellow music. Everything, I really was surprised that I liked the cd, the only bad songs are Stupid Hoe and Sex in the lounge. Other than that everything else is a 10+.

1451627289|5.0|Stephen King touched on horror with 'It', tickled us with fantasy in 'Lisey's Story', emotionally stirred us with the apocalyptic 'The Stand', dealt with science fiction in 'Under the Dome' and now he challenges the great Harry Turtledove with this alternate history epic novel! Wow! Is there any author more versatile than Stephen King? Maybe his next project is a Broadway play or musical! This man can write and I'm a big fan. I could have read this 849 page novel in two or three days, but I wanted to savor it like a fine wine. Lastly, I would be remiss if I didn't mention that this novel also contains a little of H.G. Wells's 'The Time Machine' .<br /><br />Everybody my age remembers where they were when JFK was assassinated. I recollect being in the back of a pickup as a young Marine in Camp Lejeune returning from some minor detail when a sergeant came out of headquarters and to paraphrase, said \\" the President has been shot and we are all on alert \\". If you had the opportunity to go back in time to save JFK's life, would you? What would you have to sacrifice to accomplish this paradoxical feat? If you achieved your goal and returned to the present time, what would have changed? Did he win reelection and because of it change politics as we know it? Is the world safer, or in chaos? This is the premise of the story : what would happen if you prohibited or killed Lee Harvey Oswald before he had the chance to assassinate JFK? This time travel theory is better known as the Butterfly effect, where a minor change in the past can cause major changes in the future.<br /><br />The narrator of this novel is Jake Epping, a teacher from Lisbon Falls, Maine. How strange is it for a Stephen King book to be set in Maine? Just Kidding. Anyway, he is called to Al Templeton's Diner, Jake's favorite eatery. Having recently seen Al, Jake is stunned to find the cook older and sick with lung cancer. He learns that Al has a mysterious time travel portal in his pantry! The year is 2011, but he discovers that Al has been in the past as long as four years although only two minutes have gone by in current time. Al tells Jake that when you go through the time portal, you come out in 9/9/1958! Al had the idea to stay there till 11/22/63 and stop Lee Harvey Oswald from killing JFK, but he got cancer and had to return to the present time. Now Al wants Jake to take his mission and go back in time and find out if Oswald acted alone and if he did, eliminate him.<br /><br />As you would assume, Jake does go back to 9/9/1958 and starts a new life in the past. Jake finds new friends and surly enemies in his quest to track Oswald and his family. The characters he meets for the most part are lovable and memorable; such as, Deke Simmons, Ellen Dockerty, and the love of his life, Sadie Dunhill. Since he makes most of his money betting on sporting events that he already knows the results of, he meets menacing bookies and perilous New Orleans mobsters. The main problem he faces is the past itself. The past opposes Jake in his effort to stop Oswald because it is unfavorable for the future: the Butterfly effect in action. What happens as 11/22/63 approaches is stunning and sorrowful. Well done, Stephen King I didn't see this ending coming! This was a highly delectable novel with a felicitous conclusion! I highly recommend this alternate history epic.t he discovers that Al has been in the past as long as four years although only two minutes have gone by in current time.

B001KVZ6HK|4.0|I really like the other hero movies.  I think I've seen them all in the theater.  So I was really excited about seeing this one.  The movie was really good.  Full of action and humor.  It was 2 hours and something but when I and the person I was with were leaving, I commented on how it seemed like it was an hour long.  While it had a lot of action, for the first 45 minutes or so it seemed to go slow.  I was falling asleep.  Then it started to pick up.  I think this is one of those movies that will be even better when I am sitting at home watching it.  Something that I didn't really like was the pacing.  Once they realized what was going on, they just started fighting.  Seems they could have worked it up a bit and made it more dramatic.  I never felt bad for or worried about any of the people getting hurt or dying.  None of them really mattered to me.  I think because everything just started so fast.  I have seen the stories of how the heroes got started, but it didn't seem to connect with me when watching the movie.  I did like the movie.  I just kind of wish I had waited for it to come out on blu ray.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this one is great for kids and adults.  set up is a lot like super Mario bros. easy to play and figure out.
B002AFX52S|5.0|Definitely one of the best Kurosawa-fuedal-Japanese-samurai-type films ever made. The blu-ray looks fantastic (contrary to some of the reviews I have read) and the audio is very good. This is an incredible film. Only those who love film should see this one because it is nothing like the crapola that the mainstream crowd loves so much today....still others inexplicably whine about the score....mind boggling....  This is the real thing, however....Fantastical even....get it....
B000HSIEPI|5.0|this is intriguing and really enjoyed it, was wishing there were more in the series. I like this and recommend it if you like british wit with a twist

0307887898|5.0|I'm late to this party, so I'll try not to rehash the other ~200 reviews.<br /><br />Suffice it to say, this book offers a way to build startups in a cost-effective way. Experiments let you capture data to capture an accurate picture of your environment and your performance, make decisions about your product and strategy, repeat. Your product can be such an experiment.<br /><br />As the book claims, it's an application of the Toyota Production System to a different domain. I think it does a pretty good job explaining the ins and outs, and more importantly, getting you thinking on how to incorporate these lessons into your own business.<br /><br />What's perhaps most interesting to me is that this is the book on business that Colonel John Boyd (you can read about him in this book: [[ASIN:B000FA5UEG Boyd: The Fighter Pilot Who Changed the Art of War]] ) would have written, the one that Chet Richards iterated on in [[ASIN:1413453767 Certain to Win: The Strategy of John Boyd, Applied to Business]]. This is insight derived from the OODA loop applied to the warfare of business.<br /><br />Not a surprise given Ries and Steve Blank have both pointed to Boyd as a major influencer. Just nice to see.
B007P6VM04|1.0|This CD sucks.  The thing about Smash is that Bombshell is great -- and otherwise the show is mediocre to poor.  Megan Hilty is amazing -- much better than Katharine McPhee.  Unfortunately, much of the show is based on the concept that Karen (McPhee) is a very talented, charming neophyte.  But the reality is that Hilty has much more charisma and talent.  Also, much of the writing and dialogue is quite bad.  The covers are fine, but they're crappy compared to the Bombshell numbers.  The CD is missing many of the best Bombshell songs, including \\"The National Pastime\\" (probably the single best song from Season 1).  Very disappointing, just like the show.  (When the camera shifts focus from the amazing-musical-show-within-the-show-about-a-musical to the crappy-show-about-a-musical itself,  then, unfortunately, we're just watching a crappy show.)
B002L4QP0M|5.0|As a voracious reader seeking genuinely good writing without paying inflated e-book prices, I troll through Amazon's endless recommendations that increasingly emphasize first-time writers of unedited novels. I haven't had loads of luck doing this -- too many of these low-priced efforts are undeveloped and heavy-handed, but with Jeffrey Archer's \\"A Matter of Honor,\\" I found an author of great promise and a carefully, well-developed book with engaging, believable characters, an exciting plot, and genuinely skilful writing. Other reviewers have (correctly) noted that Archer unfortunately build in a few utterly unbelievable, clunky plot elements at the beginning, and for a few moments these absolutely ruin the sense of reality the book is trying to build, but the novel does drive ahead and recovers the reader's trust. (Any decent editor could have helped Mr. Archer avoid these obvious boners.) Soon enough, we are engaged with interesting and distinct characters that we care about. Settings and plot elements are genuinely interesting and believable, and the story is fast-paced and compelling. Archer has succeeded in bringing an exciting story to life. This is a better work than some of the recent productions of authors and teams with which it is being compared. I think this is a real find, and I'll be reading more Archer.
B007XWFZSA|5.0|This is exactly the piece of advise and guidance I was looking for. This book is best in articulating and present the way to crack consulting interviews. I feel this should be a taken as text book in Management education curriculum. Thanks Victor for make it accessible and giving pleasure to read your wonderful piece of writing.
B005LAIGNC|5.0|This movie is probably the best movie based on airplanes. Yes, it beats out Top Gun and Flight of the Intruder.  Firefox and Stealth can't hold a candle to it.  Yes, the movie has some typical cliche's but it's based on a true story.  Racism was real back in 1941.  The movie has some spectacular dogfights, excellent love story, and great acting.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Great Book, well written, but a lot of slow parts. Could have been condensed with more detail. The movie follow the book very good.
B006P96PAO|5.0|I wish this movie had been available for me when my kids were small many years ago.  It may have made a difference in how I related to them and for them.  I recommend it to everyone, but, in particular, young or prospective dads. I've recommended it to my sons and bought it as a gift to a new father recently.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This Kindle Fire is awesome!!! It was designed with people who are photo sensitive to the light. When reading chapter after chapter, it does not hurt your eyes.<br /><br />I waited about six weeks before, writing this review.  I wanted to know it performed.<br /><br />The screen is very easy on the eyes and its child friendly.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is a treat. I love the action and the romance. I think it deserves an A plus. This book is about a girl  named Katniss who volunteers herself for her sister to go to The Hunger Games. The Hunger Games is a competition to fight to the death. At the end there is an unexpeted twist. This book will keep you guessing till the very end.
B004A8ZWWO|5.0|This is a wonderful humor drama.  Since my dad needed a birthday present and he wanted to see this movie, but it was gone from the theaters by the time he had heard about it, I thought I'd take the movie to him.  He loved it and was glued to the screen during the gripping moments.  I was biting my freshly manicured nails during the very intense scenes of the film which began about 1/3 of the way into the film.  None of the actors in the film are my favorites, but I love them all in this movie.  It is fantastically stomach twisting and so funny!  I wish I had a copy myself because I'm crazy about it!
1423140591|5.0|This book is the second book in the Heroes Of Olympus series by Rick Riordian, the first book being The Lost Hero. (also a good book)<br />In the beginning of the book Percy is on the run from Medusa's sisters, the Gorgons when he stumbles into Camp Jupiter. Long story short he goes to alaska and recovers a golden eagle on a staff. Then he helps stops the invasion on Camp Juipter.<br />I REALLY liked this book because it is action packed and a complete pageturner that had me hooked.
1250008409|4.0|My son lived in Korea for five years and had communicated a number of Eastern beliefs and practices from his time there and I therefore had a fundamental awareness of the topic of mindfulness through meditation.<br /><br />The title of this book intrigued me because like many Westerners, I felt a void in certain areas and felt \\"head space\\" could be a positive.  The author, Andy Puddicombe, is a former Buddhist monk and is recognized as an important mindfulness meditation expert in the UK.<br /><br />The introduction seems a bit drawn out, but it actually dispels some myths about meditation and introduces the reader to the reasons behind the concepts in the book.  It addresses the values and principles of meditation, and the author's personal experiences.<br /><br />The book is in sections<br /><br />1.  'The Approach'<br />2.  The Practice'<br />3. 'The Integration',<br /><br />Each of these move the reader from background and general interest to preparing to meditate and then to incorporating the concept of mindfulness into your life.<br /><br />Along the way are a series of short exercises one can do while reading, which is really a good introduction.<br /><br />The book is manageable and easy to follow.  Personal examples and stories are blended throughout the book and make the topics easier to follow as he is describing them.<br /><br />He tries to balance the value of meditation between focus and relaxation, which makes the comments on mindfulness more understandable.  The focus of \\"Get Some Headspace\\" is a greater awareness and understanding of ourselves and those we interact with.  It focuses on finding our inner self, choosing how we see life and how we communicate and communicate with others<br /><br />Puddicombe declares that meditating just ten minutes a day increases productivity, clarity and focus, reduces stress and anxiety, and helps with weight loss, improves sleep and personal relationships.  He quotes research on increased blood flow and physical changes in the part of the brain  that helps to control emotions and behavior and that mindfulness training can effectively treat certain addictions and eating disorders.  There are claims of enhanced performance, in making sleep easier, and in a series of other improvements in cognitive skills and reducing the intensity of negative emotions, anxiety and harmful stress.<br /><br />In reading books that claim to be life changing, it is always a challenge to write a meaningful and early review until one gets to judge the lasting benefits. The author's website includes 10 free audio mediation sessions, which are supportive in trying to learn the how and why of the 10 minute habit.<br /><br />I rate a 4 Star, and feel that \\"Get Some Headspace\\" is a very good introduction for beginners those looking to find the value of \\"mindfulness.\\"<br /><br />Dr. John Hogan CHE CHA CMHS<br />HospitalityEducators<br />Hogan Hospitalityhanges in the part of the brain  that helps to control emotions and behavior and that mindfulness training can effectively treat certain addictions and eating disorders.

140053271X|4.0|I purchased 2 of these in November of 2011. We had a baby on the way and I anticipated lots of reading time. They were so inexpensive I got one for me & one for my wife.<br /><br />I find the reading experience with the Simple Touch great. The pearl e-ink display has great contrast, and pages turn pretty quickly. I keep the wifi off and battery life is really good. I don't think it's quite as good as BN claims (2 months reading time?) but I can go weeks without charging. I've only purchased a few books though the BN store, I mostly side-load them using Calibre, which works great.<br /><br />My wife doesn't read hers as much as I read mine, and the touchscreen on hers will go unresponsive. Holding down the \\"n\\" button on bottom-front while holding down the top back button forces it to rebook and come back to life. It hasn't been a major issue though.<br /><br />I purchased a [[ASIN:B004UKNY36 Verso Arc Light for Kindle, Nook, & Other eReaders - Black]] and it works well for reading in low-light situations. The Simple Touch with GlowLight wasn't an option when I bought mine.<br /><br />Overall it's a great, versatile, light small e-reader.
0060853972|5.0|So, an amusing take on the apocalypse. Sounds strange, right? I wasn't too sure what to make of the book when I first hear about it, but I decided I go for it and read it. And, I have to say, it turned out to be one of my favorites, if not my favorite book. I've read a little of both Pratchett and Gaiman, and I was expecting to like this book but not be too interesting in it.<br />One of my favorite parts of the book was the writing, and how the humor came naturally to it. I've read some books that are funny because of how the characters are portrayed, or how the characters see others, but this is one of the few books I've read where the humor is throughout all the writing, and enhances the whole book.<br />I also really liked the characters, all of whom are fleshed out, and while some characters are more so than others, each of them has something to contribute to the story, even if it is only a small part. Not overly long, with good pacing and characters, this is a good read for anyone wanting to just sit down with a book and enjoy.

0756405890|5.0|I really loved this book. I read this after reading most of the Wheel of Time series, and so wasn't too daunted by its length. In fact, I barely noticed the length of the book since I was too wrapped up in the story. I've heard other people complain about the fact that Kvothe is almost too good at everything, but I think that his genius is offset by the fact that he does make mistakes, and these mistakes do affect his life. Not only that, but I love the way Patrick Rothfuss tells the story, and the way he writes. For me, this is one of my favorite books, and probably always will be.
0345525558|5.0|This is a well-written, moving story, with an interesting, unusual dual focus: foster child life, and flowers. Having been involved in both these areas during my childhood and young adulthood - as a sibling of some 20 foster children, and as a floral designer - I can say that this book rings true on both counts. It may not be as compelling for readers who don't have the same experience with those two worlds, but for me, it was enthralling. Highly recommended.

B007SGM084|5.0|I finished reading \\" Fifty Shades of Grey\\" and I think I'll read it again!<br />These books were so well written that you could actually visualize the characters and what they were experiencing. The sex was great, but reading the day to day drama between Ana and Christian made you want for more. Seeing how Christian's life unfolded even for himself. Once his layers were peeled back, he was the most loving person I've read about. So for those who say he took advantage of a virgin.......she felt him deep in her groin when she fell in his doorway at his office. Ana wanted what he offered and what she didn't want, she said \\"no\\" and he respected that. So folks...read the book and realize the stories behind the characters and just as young folks do....they find any and every kind of way to F*%#*.

1451683405|1.0|As a rational humanist myself -- and continually re-evaluating my notion of self and will -- I figured this quick read by Sam Harris would make a great way to kill time on a flight. Never been so wrong about a book. In fact, \\"Free Will\\" is the first book where I feel I'm justified in sending a letter to the publisher and demanding a refund. It's a rambling mess of notes that doesn't qualify as the \\"essay\\" it claims to be, let along as a *book*. The assumptions are self-serving, and the logic is circular. Several false analogies, too. In fact, I'll bet all of the major logical fallacies are represented in this book at least once, some many times.  The only reasonably well-written parts of this are the quotes from (properly written and edited) works of opposing view. Nothing is compelling. This text should have stayed in files stashed away in a sub-sub-folder on Harris' hard drive.

1451627289|4.0|I am a fan of Stephen King, and I have been since I first picked up a paperback copy of 'IT' back in 1989. I have since read more than 20 of his novels and I can say, without hesitation, that '11/22/63' is among his very best! Having been fed a steady diet of horror from King for many years, it is a breath of fresh air to see his writing used in more of a sci-fi/historical vein.<br /><br />In short, '11/22/63' is the sotry of the life of Jake Epping, a simple high school english teacher who is introduced to a phenomenon that is beyond his comprehension. A dying friend shows Jake a secret he has hidden in the back of his restaurant, a wormhole that takes it's visitor to 1958. Upon the friends request, Jake is thrust into a mission to save John F. Kennedy from being assasinated by Lee Harvey Oswald in Dallas in 1963. During his mission, Jake (now known as George Amberson), encounters many obstacles and perils, as well as happiness and even love, as he embarks on his quest to save the ill-fated president as the book builds to a crescendo and a white-knuckle finale on the 6th floor of the Texas School Book Depository.<br /><br />This novel is the best offering from King in years and goes to show that there is still some of that magic left that made him the most popular fiction writer of his, or possibly any, generation.

I could not put the book down, and have already started book #3.  Don't put off reading these books because of the sex.  I feel most of it was needed to give a good perspective of Christian's life and upbringing.  There is a fantastic love story developing within the pages of the books and that is what I focused on.  Love, love, love it so far!!!

0345803507|5.0|I think I set a new record for myself reading these books.  I loved all of them so much I just could not put them down.  These books are not about sex although there is that.  It is a part of their relationship although probably more adventurous then the average couple would try.  I loved the relationship Ana and Christian developed within the pages of these books.  It is a fabulous love story!!!!  I was a little surprised by the kinky sex and I felt there was a little too much of it, but I also felt it was probably needed in order to fully understand Christian's demons.  If you like a wonderful love story, read them, you will be happy you did.  I am a senior citizen and I loved them!!!

B005LAIHE0|4.0|There is such a ramshackle charm to this 2012 romantic comedy that I think the term \\"Apatovian\\" seems appropriate to describe it since it most definitely feels like the same general creative team led by producer Judd Apatow that guided [[ASIN:B000YIBYBM Knocked Up]], [[ASIN:B002U5QCJ6 Funny People]], and [[ASIN:B00466HN7M Bridesmaids]]. All the ingredients of the successful Apatovian formula are here - likeable principal characters facing the unpredictability of life's events, the familiar challenges of maintaining relationships in a morass of doubt and temptation, the unexpected detours into graphic humor, the pool of scene-stealing comic actors, the slightly overlong running time (this one clocks in at 124 minutes). Directed by Nicholas Stoller ([[ASIN:B001L2IFVM Forgetting Sarah Marshall]]), this particular one focuses on a young couple a year into their relationship - Tom Solomon, a talented sous-chef at a trendy San Francisco restaurant, and Violet Barnes, a psychology graduate student hoping to win a postdoctoral fellowship at Berkeley.<br /><br />The movie opens with Tom popping the question on the bayside terrace of his restaurant and Violet responding affirmatively without hesitation. Thanks to the stars' easy charms, the characters are obviously quite compatible and in love. What happens from that point forward is less about formula and more about just life. Berkeley turns Violet down, but she eventually wins a fellowship in a two-year program at Michigan. Tom willingly gives up his much-sought-after job and moves cross-country with Violet to Ann Arbor. She thrives under the tutelage of the suspiciously charming Prof. Winton Childs amid her motley study group. Tom, on the other hand, flails mightily in trying to fit into his new surroundings, eventually landing a lowly job at a sandwich shop and turning into a grizzly-looking house-husband who takes up hobbies like deer hunting and sweater knitting.<br /><br />While their dilemma doesn't represent new material to the big screen, the treatment of the subject - as co-written by Stoller and star Jason Segel - is uncommonly well handled with plenty of room for awkward moments filled with both humor and honest emotion. If the film drags, as it occasionally does in the last third, it's because they focus a little too liberally on the principals' relationships with the incidental characters. As Tom, Segel has improved considerably as a leading man since his gangly turn in [[ASIN:B001L2IFVM Forgetting Sarah Marshall]], bringing acuity to his character's increasing struggle between devotion and resentment. Emily Blunt brings a welcome softness and open awkwardness to her heretofore crystalline screen persona, and the two actors achieve a natural rapport that brings a centered relatability to their evolving characters. They are surrounded by a crack company of comic actors.<br /><br />Chris Pratt ([[ASIN:B003L77GE2 Parks & Recreation]]) brings goofball energy to Tom's wildly inappropriate chef colleague-turned-brother-in-law Alex, while Alison Brie ([[ASIN:B0038M2AOG Mad Men]]) sports a convincing Brit accent and an off-kilter manner to her hilarious portrayal of Violet's impulsive sister Suzie. One of the film's funniest scenes involves Violet and Suzie having a tense discussion while speaking in the voices of Elmo and Cookie Monster in order to avoid alarming Suzie's daughter. As Childs, Rhys Ifans ([[ASIN:B000023VTP Notting Hill]]) brings the right level of smarminess to his erudite professor, while Mindy Kaling, Kevin Hart, and Randall Park play Violet's fellow PhD candidates with sharp jabs of humor. In a few memorably funny scenes, Brian Posehn plays the oddball sandwich shop owner and Chris Parnell is Tom's too-comfortable fellow house-husband. The movie wraps up on a somewhat pat note rather quickly, but it maintains its goodwill to the very last.rial to the big screen, the treatment of the subject - as co-written by Stoller and star Jason Segel - is uncommonly well handled with plenty of room for awkward moments filled with both humor and honest emotion.

0765316994|4.0|When I first began reading this book, I liked the concept.  As the novel progressed, the underlying concept seemed to drag along too long until the characters take charge of their lives.  There was a point where I really wanted to dislike this novel, but the ending, particularly with the three codas, made me like this novel.<br /><br />Andrew Dahl has been assigned to the Universal Union Capital Ship Intrepid, which is, of course, a starship by another name.  Author Scalzi quickly gets to the point as we learn that some very strange things happen on the Intrepid.  Perhaps the most obviously strange thing is that lots of people die on away missions.  Then we learn that the away missions have certain weird characteristics.  For example, once someone dies, usually no one else does - usually.  Then there is the Box.  You will have to learn about the Box for yourself.<br /><br />One of the givens of the original Star Trek television show is that the person in the red shirt is the one who dies.  It does not matter whether the deaths take place on a ship or on an away mission.  The people in the red shirts were the ones who most typically died.  There were certain other Star Trek clich&eacute;s, some of which are reflected in this novel.  Scalzi creates a few new clich&eacute;s that may have been inspired by the original Star Trek.  What happens when these scenarios are embodied in real life?  How could such a thing happen in real life?  Would the characters just stand by and die, or would they try to understand why these things seem to happen and fix them?  I dare not provide more explanations without giving away too much of the plot, so I have to stop here.<br /><br />Some portions of the novel were written tongue-in-cheek, which were wonderfully subtle so I do not think I ever laughed aloud.  I did roll my eyes a couple of times and smiled at other times.  The tongue-in-cheek portions were at the appropriate locations in the novel.  As the novel proceeds, the tenor of the book changes from wry humor and a loose parody to serious, which I think was a good direction for readers.  I was really caught up in the last third of the main novel as the characters take charge of their lives and move the story along briskly.<br /><br />The three codas were unnecessary, but they really did a nice job of tying up some loose ends and were an interesting way to end a novel.  I preferred the last two codas.  The first coda I thought went on a little long and belabored the point that Scalzi made early in the beginning of the coda.  The first coda could have been a short story, revealing the plot of \\"Redshirts\\" without getting into the details.  Regardless, I read the first coda just to say I had.  If I ever read \\"Redshirts\\" again, I will either pass over or skim the first coda.<br /><br />The second and third codas change the whole tenor of the novel a second time, the first time being from light humor to serious.  The second change is from serious to poignant.  Indeed, I loved the third coda, which I think was a perfect way to end this novel and made me decide that this novel was four stars rather than three.  Thinking back, any one of the three codas could have been the end of this novel.  Scalzi treated us all to a relatively rare experience, a novel with four endings.<br /><br />The whole point of science fiction is its flexibility.  In this case, Scalzi asks an interesting question:  Could our actions determine the actions of others displaced in space and time.  Though Scalzi provides some justification for the flexible physics of the Universal Union universe, the twists are far enough that this novel has many characteristics of fantasy rather than science fiction.<br /><br />This novel was interesting and I am glad I read it, but I am unable to provide a strong recommendation for it.  Fans of the original \\"Star Trek\\" will find the novel interesting.  Fans of the original \\"Star Trek\\" and John Scalzi have to read this novel.  For all others, itjust depends on your expectations for science fiction novels that push the limits of the definition of science fiction, if not actually breaking the definition of science fiction.<br /><br />Typically I wrap up my reviews with either \\"good luck,\\" if the item I reviewed has issues, or \\"enjoy\\" if I think the item is a winner.  In the case of this novel, I should provide both \\"good luck\\" and \\"enjoy,\\" because there are going to be people who will absolutely love this novel and there are going to be people who will wonder what the fuss is about, or even dislike it.  Rather than confusing everyone by having both \\"good luck\\" and \\"enjoy\\" at the end of my review, I am giving you this paragraph.

B002KSPKRS|4.0|I bought my X41 set in the summer of 2009 and its still my go-to headset for playing Xbox Live. I originally bought it as a way to play Left 4 Dead with my friends while my roommate, who wasn't a gamer, read, slept, etc that I didn't want to disturb with a bunch of video game sounds.<br /><br />Whats great about this headset is that it is your own private surround sound system that also allows you to chat with other players via the mic, which eliminates the chance of your speakers coming through while you talk to folks. The set is comfortable to wear but for extended hours of gameplay and usage, it can get a little uncomfortable on your head. (I'm talking about hours and hours of marathon gaming on a weekend.) I love that I'm able to hear a hunter in Left 4 Dead before my teammates and even pinpoint where its coming from due to these headphones.<br /><br />My only complaints after nearly 3 years of usage are the following: AAA batteries, keep them stocked up. I feel like this headset burns through them faster than what I'd like but its not too fast either. Also when the batteries run down and its about to die, the sound goes haywire and gives a deafening SCREEEEECH. (Not very fun if you don't catch it coming.) Lastly it seems to have issues occasionally with its signal and will make clicking sounds like its having trouble sending sound to the headset although this could be due to its wireless signal conflicting with my Xbox's wireless, or my laptop, or my ps3, or my wii, or my cell phone, etc.<br /><br />Overall I would recommend this product. Mine has served me well for nearly 3 years. Also hooking it up to my PS3 is an amazing sound experience when watching blu-rays.
B004XUMPFQ|5.0|It's hard to find an entertaining show on TV; reality shows seem to be the norm. I've found myself watching shows that others raved about years ago. I had heard that Firefly was a show to watch for its entertaining story lines and fabulous one-liners. I was admittedly doubtful.  I didn't know how the melding of space and western themes would work.  After watching all the episodes, I was so disappointed that it was canceled.  Talk about a show with great potential.  The writing was, as rumored, great.  The actors were perfectly chosen.  If you haven't watched Firefly, give it a go.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wow.<br /><br />I did not hear of The Hunger Games until the movie came out. I didn't even know it was a book until I heard some women talking about reading it together. One of them said, \\"There's an older lady in one of my classes - she's about 40 (~cough cough~ older? oh dear) - and she said she wasn't going to read it because it's a kid's book. But once she started reading it she said she couldn't put it down.\\" The statement made me curious so I checked Amazon. Sure enough, there was a Kindle copy, and it was pretty cheap. I had nothing to lose by purchasing it.<br /><br />I could NOT put this book down. It was well-written, the story unfolds easily, and I was in awe of the idea. To those people who think this is about children killing children, I assert that it is not. This is a story about the potentially horrendous and devastating power of government. The reader is sympathetic to the beautifully-constructed characters, the settings are well-described and easy to imagine, and there is triumph in the relationships the characters form with each other. The backstories and the easily-understood new words that Suzanne Collins creates help to make this book stand out among its many contemporaries.<br /><br />This was probably my favorite book of the trilogy, probably because it was the first one and it enraptured me so, and I am jealous of those readers who have not had a chance to dive in yet. I will read this set of books again, but there will never be another first time. ENJOY IT!

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I felt that this was the \\"oddball\\" of the trilogy, but not in a bad sense. This book was perhaps the most forlorn of the three, and the setting and the psychology of the characters was different than in the other tow, which took some getting used to. The story kept me guessing about the ending and about the characters - who is really the bad guy, how does this character's actions affect how this other character will turn out - which was both fun and maddening.<br /><br />Other reviewers did not like this book, some for the premise of the trilogy (stopping just short of calling for a ban) and some for the style of the book. I feel that \\"Mockingjay\\" is a fitting end to the series, and it finishes in a satisfying way. I wish that the tragic loss didn't occur (no spoiler!) since it left me feeling as though Katniss's entire ordeal was merely putting off the inevitable, but that loss nicely sets up Katniss's later responses to other situations and characters.<br /><br />This was not my favorite of the three books but it was certainly an exciting and engrossing read. I greedily sped through all three books in a couple of weeks, and wish there were more books coming! I'll be on the lookout for other Suzanne Collins fiction.
B006M4F67A|4.0|Works great on my Kindle Fire. A nice variety of games, from easy to rather difficult. Ease of use makes it difficult to stop playing.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|To get the free games you must earn them by playing other games. Nothing bad to say about the game, just seems like something a more avid gamer would like, whereas I'm a &quot;casual once a week&quot; type.
B004SCN2F6|5.0|I bought this game based on the reviews, and this is the one game that I am so glad I took a chance on. It is the most used app that I have on my phone. Somehow, I can't seem to put this game down. And I am not even one to pick up space genre games.<br /><br />There are many ways to play Star Traders. Play it safe and carefully explore and trade your way through the politics of the world, or go down the path of smugglers, pirates and zealots by firing torpedoes and pillaging other ships. Then of course there are the various difficulty levels that you can play it in. The rewards that I've unlocked so far make me eager to see what else I can accomplish. I've only played two factions to date (out of six), so there is also that potential to play through the game using a different faction each time.<br /><br />One thing I have to point out about this app is that there are no strange permissions lurking about. I am very picky about the apps I choose to add specifically because of these pesky permission. With Star Traders, the developers have given us a wonderful game without all those questionable permissions that abound in so many others. How refreshing! For that reason alone I would have supported the Trese Brothers. But now, knowing that they put out such a good product? I am definitely going to pick up their other games as well! Just as soon as I find the time in between exploring the galaxy.<br /><br />Great job, devs! This is one game I'm going to highly recommend to everyone. And if you ever need help, there is a nice community on the forums to support you. Well done! I can't wait for the new update on Amazon! I encourage everyone who loves gaming to choose apps like these that are made by gamers for gamers. The developer's love of gaming shines through. I can't wait to see what other apps they have up their sleeves.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love this app. I can read this same book on my kindle, kindle for pc, kindle cloud and now my phone. I never have to put a book down. It's great.
1423117166|3.0|I was excited to see that Disney put out a series of books that covers the different areas in the animation production pipeline. My problem with the few of these books that there are, are done by artists using their personal work, and usually not studio work, due to licensing problems, I imagine, or because they are not professional animation artists. Learning an ambiguous style is not helpful. Each studio tends to use a certain style and that's what they want to see. Plus, learning from an amateur who isn't in the industry isn't going to teach you what you need to know, unless you're a kid, and then, just drawing and practicing is important.<br /><br />That being said, this particular books is not like the other archive books. Animation means a group of drawings that create movement when they're used together. That is not what this book is. It is just a bunch of random drawings that have been used in animation. So, it doesn't really serve as any type of learning, which the other books in the series do. It really only serves as a collector book for those who want to look at different character drawings used in Disney animation throughout the years, but, I can't imagine ever picking up this book to look at it again. It is much more impressive to see the actual drawings in person. That is amazing. Seeing reproductions in a book...not that exciting. The only thing I could possibly see using this as an artistic reference is for Disney character design...but there are no head-turns, expressions, hand dynamics...so, it really wouldn't work as a character design book either, just more if you wanted a beginner's Disney character practice guide.<br /><br />It would have been much more interesting for them to show the Disney process of animation, which would be a first. This is just one of many collector books, and I would much rather have a full-color book from a specific film that details their whole process, if I wanted a collector book, than a book of character, pencil drawings.
B007Q476KU|3.0|For those of you with a sentimental bent, this is a lovely feel good about life, feel bad about war movie.  Unfortunately nothing in it is accurate about horses or how they learn.  Aside from the fact that the Germans come off like the Keystone Cops, my favorite \\"this is ridiculous\\" part is when one horse eyeballs another in order to \\"teach?\\" it to take the harness.  This movie anthropomorphizes horses, giving them human motivations and desires.  Emily Watson is brilliant, but has very little to work with.  Surely with the budget Spielberg can command he could have hired some specialists to tell him how horses behave and respond?  I read the novel first, and that was bad enough.  Are horses amazing?  Yes.  Do they act like the trained horses in this movie, when they're being themselves?  No.  I was hoping for a real movie about what it takes to train a horse to ignore its natural instincts and respond to the rider rather than to the fear.  Unfortunately, this is not that movie. (And should have been, Steve.)
0345803493|1.0|If you've read the first book, you already know the writing it quite lacking. If you're looking for a mindless read, you've definitely come to the right place. The same sex scenes, the same words, the predictable storyline, you'll be able to guess it all before you get halfway through the book. Sadly, I felt like I had to get closure with this book, and I read to the end. I honestly have no clue how this story ended up on the best sellers list. The sex scenes aren't shocking or described in detail at all. If you feel you need to read these books, borrow them or check them out of the library. I wish I could get my money back for these. They were a waste of money and my time.
B00127RAJY|3.0|Let me start by saying I'm only 16 years old. I've been active all my life, and played about every sport middle school and high school have offered. I like doing workout videos so I can workout on my own time and around my schedule. This workout is very effective. You notice results within a week. I'm only 120 pounds, so I didn't have weight to lose. I was just looking for something to tone me up fast before summer. This workout would be excellent if it wasn't so hard on the knees. The first night I did it it was hard to fall asleep because my knees hurt so bad. It has been a week and they are still hurting. I wouldn't recommend doing this dvd every single day. It's too hard on the joints.

B003EYVXV4|2.0|The movie it's OK. But the concept is only a copy of Battle Royale with details of Running Man. If you like that movies you can enjoy this one but don't expèct something original.

B003L77GH4|4.0|I got what I wanted in a quick manner. The item was noticeably used and worn but still in ok working order.
B00007J4SI|5.0|Some critics seem to sit on their ears: \\"Harsh unpolished sound\\" ... \\"UPRIGHT piano\\" ...? What a nonsense! Ponti plays Scriabin on a Bechstein Grand, well known for its open sound in the upper registers (Blüthner even added an additional string to this effect). Scriabin composed many of his works on a Bechstein - for good reasons. And Ponti performs excellent in most pieces and passages, masters perfect transitions from one mood to the next. He plays \\"insinuant\\" as insinuant, \\"fulgurant\\" as fulgurant, \\"lumineux\\" as lumineux, \\"étincelant\\" as sparkling and especialy \\"tourbillonment\\" as whirling etc.. Scriabin introduced, according my count, at least 70 expression marks you don't find easily in the work of other composers - and not in the playing of other performers than Ponti. To some ears the extreme differentiation of expression sounds simply as improvisational. But is exactly what Scriabin expected. Same applies to sound intensity as notated by the composer, which Ponti works out properly.<br />I don't see 'rivals' to Ponti (if this would make sense). Surely not Lettberg. Compare her 8th Sonata, bar 27-25, a central motive in the work: the fast intervals are drowned in pedal overuse, simply unrecognizabe. Pedal overuse ruines most Scriabin interpretations. Compare Ashkenazy's, Szidon's or Shukov's (too slow anyway) 5th Sonata to that of Ponti.<br />His edition is especially valuable since it includse the Egoroff Variations and Scriabin's two youth sonatas which are omitted by nearly all 'Complete Sonata' editions. Lettberg's \\"The Solo Piano Works\\" includes only compositions with opus numbers, i.e. skipps about 15 pieces you can find in Ponti's boxes.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|So I actually got the book before it was all the rave.  I pre-ordered all of three.  I had at least 100 pages left to read in the first one and couldn't read anymore.  I then proceeded to cancel the remaining two because there was no way I was going to put anymore money into this.<br /><br />I like reading Erotica, but I think I yawned more through the majority of this book forcing myself to read the next page without falling asleep.<br /><br />The writing is so simple.. too simple.  The characters have no depth to them.<br /><br />So disappointed.  The idea was a great one, and with the right writer the story could have been exceptional.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|When my daughter told me about this series I had no interest in reading it.  Have heard so many things about the series since.  Bought the sample and am \\"hooked\\".  Half way through the 3rd of the series and haven't been disappointed yet.
B0071MV540|5.0|Excellent acting by a broad cast of stars, combined with a light-hearted plot where the bad guy (Alan Alda - a Wall Street swindler who has stolen the retirement funds belonging to employees at his penhouse) gets what he richly deserves in the end. Yes, it's a bit simplistic, but still enjoyable.
B0055Q5F36|1.0|I don't know how other reviewer find the case to fit the AT&T Galaxy IIS. The one I got doesn't fit in many area. The power bottom position is wrong, the opening on top for the headphone jack is on the wrong side; the volume bottom position is also wrong. I'm returning mine.
B007MJ9LA2|4.0|I nice and enjoyable album, and thankfully not a repeat of the horrible guitar classics album.  When I saw him in Vegas last year he started his show with \\"Back In Black\\" -- Ghastly.<br /><br />The quality of the tracks is variable, with some strong (eg \\"Nomad\\") and others a bit light on originality and creativity.  I would not put this in my Santana top 10, but it's still iPod worthy.
B004JN1D2I|1.0|Why is the kindle version more expensive then the paper print. Bring the price down...it needs to be lower then the paper print.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I enjoyed the read. The story line through the trilogy centered heavily on hunger as the driver to behavior of the main characters. The novel did not drag holding my interest throughout and enticed me to read the two subsequent novels.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really like this game. it has good grafics and never freezez like some of my others games have done in the past

B0040QYROK|1.0|The Blu-ray I received would not play on my newer LG Blu-ray player, which I keep updated with its latest firmware. When it didn't work in that player, I switched to using a slightly older Samsung player which I hadn't updated for at least a year. My only reasoning was that it didn't work in one player so I figured it couldn't hurt trying it another player. That seemed to work, for about 20 minutes at which time the player froze up so hard that I eventually had to take it apart to get the disk out.<br /><br />To be clear, the problem here is likely the Samsung player which I've since discovered is notorious for corrupting firmware. And as much as I hate to admit it, it could easily be user error. BUT as there isn't an easy way to figure this out I would caution users to expel the disc at the first sign of playback trouble.<br /><br />As far as the contents, what little I saw and heard, I was thrilled, especially with the score. Highly recommend this version for fans of the movie. If you didn't like other versions of Metropolis (excluding Giorgio Moroder's reworking), then don't expect this version to magically transform your opinion into one of favoritism.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|great game but has its kinks like every game but still a great game even though people say its bad its great
B0070YDOT8|1.0|Downloaded this mainly to try the poker &amp; see if how it compared to Zynga. The answer is &quot;not well.&quot; Clunky interface, very hard to set bets quickly, messages showing achievements pop up in the middle of hands and obscure your view of the control buttons. The idea of multiple games in one app is nice, but poker is my main game &amp; Zynga does it waaaaay better. So forget it, uninstalling.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this is a great game.  the app is easy to use and I have had no problems. with it so far.  I would recommend. this app to anyone.

B001NIA27E|5.0|Great story, great cast. Pierce Brosnan and Linda Hamilton have great chemistry in this film. The special effects are well thought out and gives you the feeling that you could be in that situation. Keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B007P6VM04|3.0|The disappointment part first:  so many of the original songs written particularly for the series are missing.  Those originals provide such power in the storytelling on \\"Smash\\".  That's exactly what a classic musical does: the songs should reveal character and/or move the plot along.  Without all of the originals (and they are really good!), only part of the story has been told. Yet, the wonderful part is that here, at least, are a collection of a few that were sung by the stars during the run of the first season.  It's heavily weighted to McPhee, and frankly, Megan Hilty has the more interesting voice.  But if this is the best source for you to buy the songs, then do it.  Since it's so much better to hear the sound of CDs rather than downloads, this CD has to be an improvement over the scattered availability of songs from other sources.  Loved the TV series, wanted to love the soundtrack album, but it's incomplete.
1439152799|5.0|This book is well-written, well-thought out and the characters are interesting and really come to life in this book. I love the nuances of the various relationships and the parallel lives between mother and daughter. The story had me thinking about it long after I finished the book, which to me is a true test of a great read. I'd never read this author before but will definitely buy more.
0307951529|5.0|I've been following Chris' blog for awhile and was eagerly awaiting the release of this book.  It was a quick read, but was filled with info.  The purpose of the book was to walk you through building a small business around skills you have and something that you are interested in, which Chris refers to as a micro-business.<br /><br />Using case studies of successful business owners, the book teaches you how to get started on your path to freedom.  Everything from finding your target audience to marketing yourself and scaling up is covered.  Examples of entrepreneurs featured include mattress store owners, dress makers, language teachers, consultants, bloggers and software providers.<br /><br />This is a great read for anyone interested in this topic.  It serves as a great blueprint for those who are considering venturing out on their own.
B007C4ZJ0S|5.0|Wow! My wife and I both said after watching this. It took us totally by surprise how good it was!<br />Start the movie slowly in a diner and bish bam boom! The action starts! It's not typical action movie hijinks but more realistic fighting a la Bourne Identity. Then car chase.. THEN the story kicks in and what a doozy it is!<br /><br />There is a LOT of talking during this movie, which is perhaps why some people don't care for it. An incredible amount of dialogue to develop the story.  Me? I love a good action movie, but if there's no story to drive the action, it becomes very boring. If you don't care about the characters, it becomes \\"So What?\\" if and when a character gets hurt or dies. I love bad guys, but I want to know WHY they're bad guys. This movie tells it all but keeps you in suspense the whole time. And interspersed with all the drama is a whole lot of action: fighting, shooting, car chases, foot chases, sneaking around, spying, heisting..<br /><br />Great stuff. It's been a long time since we saw a movie that pleasantly surprised us this well.<br /><br />Walt D in LV

B007PT3QOQ|1.0|annoying. . . you can get the app for free but literally place it for 5 minutes until you have to use a paypal account to buy stuff to follow through with anything.  I usually don't give bad reviews but I am de-installing this app!!!!
0345803485|5.0|*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*<br />I've read all three books of the trilogy, and although i must admit that it was a bit repetitive, the story was that of the ultimate love story between an unbelievable man and a young strong headed woman.<br />Christian's character is THE alpha male, Ana that of an innocent and strong willed woman.<br />The book does not dote on BDSM, Christian sexual nature is that of the unusual kind, however seeing that he is totally in love with Ana, he gives her choices all the time.<br />I don't for one moment think this book degrades woman or condones that women be told what to do or portrays women as defenseless, it's not disturbing at all. It's because of Christian's childhood he is the way he is, but he does not impose this forcefully on Ana...he lets her choose. Ana being new to the sexual activities, also indulges Christian, if she doesn't like something she lets him know and he obliges her..<br />I've heard/read comments saying that after all that women have been through for their independence why would such a book be popular.Women, even if they don't want to admit it, would like their men to be like Christian, he takes charge, takes care of Ana, talks to her,sees to all her needs. It's because Ana is independent and she don't allow Christian to engulf her with his ways, and he listens, because her needs and wants, he cares about.<br />You get caught up in the love story between them, their love emanates through the book, you feel Christian's overwhelming love for Ana.<br />The last book, ended the story very well, i don't think there is another fifty shades coming, because of the way it was concluded.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I couldn't read this fast enough!! I was so into this book, for obvious reasons, and I was so sad at the end, not because it wasn't a great ending, but because there were no more books :( I would love to hear more about these two!!

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I can't say anything that hasn't already been said.  Very entertaining, naughty, romantic and exciting.  I want more, three books just aren't enought when you have such unique characters.  I'd continue to read about Christian and Ana and all their \\"adventures\\"!!
0743298039|5.0|This is a fabulous book for book-lovers and biography fans alike. The fictional biography of a fictional famous author is mysterious and touching. Twin sisters and loss are the prominent themes. Sorrow and regret are not as depressing as you think in this novel. The mystery of their lives draw you onward. Dysfunctional and disturbing families find comfort and release in writing and reading.<br /><br />One of my favorite quotes is when the protagonist, Margaret Lea, describes this feeling:<br />\\"All morning I struggled with the sensation of stray wisps of one world seeping through the cracks of another. Do you know the feeling when you start reading a new book before the membrane of the last one has had time to close behind you? You leave the previous book with ideas and themes - characters even- caught in the fibers in your clothes, and when you open the new book, they are still with you. Well, it was like that.\\"<br />I have experienced that many times with books, as well as with events and effects in 'real' life. She uses it beautifully in the context in which is is set.<br /><br />There is also the more referenced quote on the back of the book and inside, which moved me:<br />\\"My gripe is not with the lovers of truth but with truth herself. What succor, what consolation is there in truth, compared to a story? What good is truth at midnight, in the dark, when the wind is roaring like a bear in the chimney? What you need are the plump comforts of a story. The soothing, rocking safety of a lie.\\"<br /><br />I couldn't put it better. It is a wonderful description of what I find in books. I find truths in ordinary stories, and they are much easier to take in the form of a story. A novel. These truths are more inspiring in stories. I gain so much insight into myself and life.<br /><br />By all means, read this book. The only problem I have with it is that it is so good that it has been difficult to start another book. A book that does not compare.

B005LAIIRQ|1.0|After surviving a plane crash in a remote area of Alaska, a group of oil drillers face a pack of wolves that kill for the fun of it.<br /><br />CONS... Too many scenes were filmed in the pitch dark, with only a campfire to light the actor's faces. The camera jerked and panned this way and that, making it even more difficult to see what was happening. The wolves, which are less frightful than Cabbage Patch dolls, stayed away long enough for the group of men to have long and excruciating conversations that did little more than extend the length of this film. Even Liam Neeson couldn't save it. In an attempt to make the wolves look scarier, lots of night scenes were shot to capture their eyes glowing in the background. There's lots of soundtracks of many, many wolves howling in the background too. Oh, big scary moments there!<br /><br />Oddly, this movie has some entertainment value. It's loaded with hysterically stupid stuff. I laughed in many places I shouldn't have. One such scene involved the killing of a wolf. The starving group roasted the carcass, head and all, over a campfire for several hours, until it was cooked enough to eat. One member of the group decided to upset the remaining pack that howled in the darkness. He stabbed and chopped off the roasted wolf's head with his knife, while its blood dripped all over his head. Nice grisly effect, I suppose, except that the wolf was thoroughly cooked. There shouldn't have been a drop of blood left in it.<br /><br />Another scene found Neeson swept away in the rapidly flowing, brutally cold glacial waters. He managed to pull himself to shore, drenched to the skin. He sat down in a snowbank to rest a while. After cursing God, he gets up and continues his hike. In reality, he would have frozen to death seconds after getting out of the ice water.<br /><br />While out-running the wolves, the group suddenly stops short at the edge of a cliff. It's hundreds of feet straight down to the ground, and hundreds of feet across to the other side. They make a rope, tie one end to a tree and the other end to one of the oil drillers, who, after getting a running start, jumps across the expanse of the deep ravine. He lands in the trees and secures his end of the rope to a strong tree. The rope provided a \\"bridge\\" from the edge of the cliff to the other side of the mountain. And if that wasn't outrageous enough, the same pack of wolves immediately attacks them after they shimmy across the bridge to the other side. WTH? How did the wolves get over there?<br /><br />One oil driller, knowing the campfire was the only thing keeping the pack of wolves at bay, left the fire and wandered into the darkness to take a whiz. He never made it back to camp.<br /><br />There are tons of outrageous moments in The Grey. I couldn't even begin to list them all.<br /><br />The ending infuriated me. The wolves waited patiently on the sidelines while Neeson paid a finale tribute to the photographs, but I guess I should have seen that nonsense coming.<br /><br />PROS... None, unless you count my relief that I didn't spend ten bucks to see this movie in the theater.<br /><br />This is simply a bad, bad movie.o the other side.

B005ZUR724|1.0|I have been playing video games for over 30 years and this game has the worst development problems that I've seen in a game since E.T. for the Atari 2600. I'm not joking. If you are NOT an IOS user you get stuck with a lot of gliched quests/missions. I've counted TWELVE unplayable gliched quests so far and I'm only about half way through the game. Then there are the support problems. I like how the last update for Kindle Fire was called the 'May 15th update'. That's funny, is it still May 15th? Nope. It's May 17th. No update yet. I speak with Amazon support and they blame Gameloft. I go to Gameloft's website and they blame Amazon. Do your job. What a load of unprofessional garbage. I paid for this game and I shoud be able to play it whenever I want to.<br /><br />The worst part is I have to admit that I still want to play it. The game has the potential to be great but if the developers don't support it I won't either. One star.

B007X15GRQ|1.0|To put it simply, if you've seen Gone in 60 Seconds then just replace the cars with cash/drugs and you have Contraband. It's a ridiculous movie that, unlike Gone in 60, doesn't know when to have fun with itself but is unwilling to actually commit to being a more realistic movie either. What you get is Mark Walburg being the typical tough guy he loves to play in a movie so gutlessly predictable that you'll actually find yourself wishing you were watching Nicholas Cage or even Jason Statham instead. Towards the end of the movie they have a very real chance to get some emotion out of Walburg's character from the audience, even if the circumstances that lead there are frankly comedic, instead they turn what could have been a very real tragedy into a miracle the defies modern science.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|In true Stephen King form, this book takes you by the hand, then grabs you by the throat and runs with you through the rest of the story.  This was the first book I read on Kindle and it was perfect for the job.  I read the reviews about the book before I bought it and that piqued my interest.  Since I was in the sixth grade when JFK was assassinated, this was a must read for me.  I had always wondered, \\"what if\\", and Mr. King gave me exactly what I was looking for.  This should come as no surprise to all the King fans out there.  I've been reading Stephen King books since the first one came out and will be reading them until one of us is long gone.  Or maybe there will be a rabbit hole out there somewhere?
B007Q2N0HA|4.0|Bared to You<br />Reviewed by Francesca & posted at Under the Covers Book Blog<br /><br />First of all, I picked up this book because I like Sylvia Day and I thought the cover was hot.  I was intrigued to read an erotic story by her and quite frankly I barely skimmed through the blurb.  I loaded it on my tablet and then well, got sidetracked.  Then all of a sudden there's all this buzz about this book and I hear it's being compared to Fifty Shades of Grey.  And that got my attention again.  I enjoyed Fifty Shades for the most part even though I didn't necessarily found it erotic and the writing wasn't 100% to my liking.  So I started reading Bared to You with a certain preconception of what the story would be like and knowing that I would enjoy the writing better because I like this author!<br /><br />Now... what can I tell you about it after reading it?  This book is very Fifty Shades but better.  I almost wish Fifty wasn't there to outshine this story because of all the publicity.  We basically have a very rich and very tormented man, Gideon Cross.  He owns practically half of Manhattan and things always go his way.  He comes from an abusive past and hasn't done well in his relationships with women, as well as his family.  He's very possessive, domineering, stubborn and at times selfish and quite stalkerish.<br /><br />Then there's Eva Trammell.  She's young, recently moved to Manhattan from California and just got her first job in a building that happens to be owned by Mr. Cross.  She also comes from an abusive past and still deals with overprotective parents while trying to find her own way and live her life without fear.  Of course she is instantly mesmerized by Gideon.<br /><br />Even though I think Gideon is very sexy and they have great chemistry together, I found myself at times thinking he is just a bit too much.  Too overpowering, too crazy deluded, too...well... creepy.  And then there's the fact of the ex-fiance and the good friend and how he somehow thought she should be ok with him having such important female friends in his life while she just sat quietly next to him and \\"behaved\\".  So yeah I got a bit ticked off with Gideon Cross at times.<br /><br />I think they have a lot to go through and grow together and individually to make their relationship work in the long run and I think it'll be fun to read.<br /><br />Now onto the Fifty Shades issue.  Is it similar?  Yes.  Is it better? In my opinion, absolutely!  It's written perfectly, the characters, the scenes, everything flowed perfectly and caught my interest from the get-go.  And Sylvia Day can surely write some hot scenes!  A friend told me that this book was inspired by Sylvia's Seven Years to Sin story, and that she wanted to take that premise and write a contemporary story.  So I'll be checking out that book as well soon!<br /><br />I am looking forward to the second book in this series.  I do hope to see more character development and some emotional connection between Gideon and Eva.  I am also looking forward to reading more about Cary, Eva's roommate.  He was another interesting character.<br /><br />Favorite Quote:<br />\\"I'm going to possess you, Eva.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|One of the best books i have ever read! The series is amazing. I highly recommend this book to anyone. Yes there is a lot of sexual stuff in the book. But the story line goes beyond that.

B008133DO8|1.0|In the product description, it says originally broadcast on BBC America. Really? PBS aired the series in the US and BBC1 in the UK. So which version again is being offered for \\"instant\\" viewing?<br /><br />Reason for asking is, PBS has cut 8-9 minutes out of each of the two series from the BBC/UK originals, really important story and character stuff that only adds to the pleasure of watching this great series. If the \\"instant video\\" is the US version, save your \\"instant\\" money and just buy the DVDs as aired on BBC.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|The Presidents Club is a very interesting and enlightening read.  We all have a basic sense of the existence of \\"the club\\" from viewing from afar the interaction of current and former presidents, but this book goes behind the facade and lays bare both the frictions that exist between long-time adversaries and the mutual protection they afford each other as members of the \\"world's most exclusive club.\\"  Much can be learned about the true character of our former presidents by understanding how each reacts to his predecessors and his successors.  I was particularly struck by the Hoover-Truman friendship.  It is clear that Truman had a far more productive relationship with Herbert Hoover, every Democrats favorite Republican whipping-boy, than he did with FDR or even, in the end, with Eisenhower. Similarly, the portrayal of Richard Nixon and his continuing ambitions and efforts to return to political relevance is enlightening as to the personna of Richard Nixon.  Jimmy Carter's maverick antics are equally enlightening.  This is a fun and enlightening book which I recommend to all of those interested in current events and politics.
B0000DZ3HM|4.0|Almost as new, I think. No reproduction problems at all, perfect box, DVD disc with no scratches. What else can you ask for?
B000M341QE|5.0|My late night movie for last night was \\"The Departed\\" in which Jack Nicholson was one of the leading roles. A number of people have told me I look like Jack Nicholson so that made it a bit more interesting. His wrinkle lines are a little deeper and his hair is a little thinner than mine and he cuts his mustache/goatee a little differently. I'd judge him to be about 5 years older than me. No, I haven't looked it up. I have a few diagonal wrinkles on my forehead from being a side-sleeper. Jack doesn't, and probably sleeps mostly on his back. Anyway, that's beside the point and I should indicate that it was quite a good movie but seemed rather long and my attention span waxed and waned here and there, and the plot and characters were interwoven to the point that it didn't make for easy viewing. Yaawwwnnnn. I watched it late at night.<br /><br />Nicholson played a gangster and was quite ruthlessly convincing. The movie was centered about the police who were trying to infiltrate the gang via a few ultra-secret undercover agents but the gang had also infiltrated the police and even the FBI so everyone had to be extremely careful about what they said or who they said it to and it provided a tense environment in which to function. It was a violent movie with a lot of blood and gore. Bullets were flying and a lot of people bit the dust. I noticed that this was yet another one of those ultra-realistic movies where you can see the puff-spray of blood after a bullet strikes a body, or particularly the head. The language was course and crude and heavily into the F-speech dialog of American English to a point I think it distracted from the quality of the movie. The acting and directing was quite good and the story moved along at a comfortable speed. Romantic aspects of the story were trimmed down to the barest minimum. I'd judge it as an excellent film from a director well known for excellent films, but I don't think this is his best.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

B00000634J|5.0|This beautiful song reminds me of what is talked about in the book The Final Religion By Lee Black a united mankind helping each other today, instead of being divided and waiting for some unknown force to fix everything.

B001N1DPDE|5.0|This is a massive knife!  Heavy blade with excellent feel to the hand.  I bought this knife to remove bark from a very large live oak tree stump that I'm going to use in my shop as a chopping block.  Worked great for that and kept it's edge very well.  The heavy duty sheath fits great too - so far I'm satisfied and you can't beat the price on Amazon!

B00018D44U|5.0|This is by far my favorite Norah Jones CD and maybe my favorite CD ever.  These songs stay with you and I can listen to them over and over.  Her voice is amazing and I like the mix of upbeat and slow songs.  For me, it's the perfect combination.  I think this is Norah Jones at her best.  It's rare to find a compilation where you like every song on it, if you like her you definitely need to get this CD.
B003IWZ1D8|3.0|I was excited when the 50th anniversary edition in Blu-Ray arrived in the mail. Maybe it's just my disc, but there seemed to be a persistent, arched-vertical shadow on the right side of the picture. It was in every seen, and I haven't put my older DVD in the player yet to see I never noticed it before. Strange. I would have made it 5 stars, but knocked off two because of the shadow. Once I saw it, it was hard to ignore it.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Got the BluRay set when it's on sale and it looks great with full 1080p glory.  It includes extra bonus disc with extra contents and Animatrix.  Very nice!
B0000033P2|5.0|I recently attended a Greg Lake solo show.  Just Greg playing guitar (and a bit of bass) with recorded tracks...not the format I would've chosen but still an excellent show.  He did an outstanding version of \\"From The Beginning\\" then later in the show did a couple of verses of \\"Trilogy\\" with just acoustic guitar.  I have to admit, it took me back in a very good way.  Trilogy was one of the very first prog albums I ever bought and to this day remains one of my very favorites.  Starting with \\"The Endless Enigma\\", a kind of quirky mix of piano/synth that weaves in and out of different melodies (even a bit of bagpipes), then moving on to their version of Copland's \\"Hoedown\\" among others.  The title track, however, is to me the quintessential piece of ELP music (the Tarkus suite being a close second).  A beautiful melody with some of Keith's best piano work...building up to what can only be called a blast of loud, intricate prog rock that few other pieces of music rival.  Seeing GL inspired me to write the review, and I recommend checking out his show if he's close by.<br />If you're somehow new to ELP, or to the 70's prog sound, I'd probably recommend starting with \\"Brain Salad Surgery\\" then move your way to \\"Trilogy\\" if you like what you hear.  The composition and performance of the music is simply amazing...these are 3 of the most talented musicians you'll ever hear...and \\"Trilogy\\" is a perfect example.
B007V2UGPE|3.0|liked this game all the way up until i started it today and it lost all my saved data and made me start over. beware of making purchases.
B002CN2NCG|5.0|When Ernest Lehman and Alfred Hitchcock got stuck on the script for \\"The Wreck of the Mary Deare\\", Lehman said he really wanted to make \\"the Hitchcock film to end all Hitchcock films\\". The result was \\"North by Northwest\\". One might say \\"Silverado\\" is Lawrence Kasdan's attempt at \\"the Western to end all Westerns\\". Virtually every Western-movie clich&eacute; is -- uh -- trotted out for our inspection and amusement.<br /><br />During the first hour or so, before the story starts getting really black, Kasdan has fun with these clich&eacute;s. It works, because \\"Silverado\\" is an homage to classic Westerns, not a send-up. There's also some subtle borrowing. When Emmett leaves the cabin at the beginning, one can't help but think \\"John Ford\\". And Emmett's hobby seems to be whittling flutes (rather than napkin rings). (There are doubtless others I've missed.)<br /><br />The casting is just about perfect. Even the normally torpid Kevin Costner delivers an amusing performance as Emmett's younger, goofy brother. Kasdan's leisurely directorial pace not only makes the action sequences more exciting, but also allows the actors to //act//, to do the \\"little things\\" that aren't in the script, but help us better understand the characters.<br /><br />The image quality is excellent. I've seen \\"Silverado\\" several times, but the cinematography never impressed me so much. This is a film you //have// to see in high definition.<br /><br />Kasdan says \\"Silverado\\" is a \\"family\\" film, but it has an apt PG-13 rating. There's little blood, but some vicious brutality.<br /><br />I purchased my region-free Blu-ray from a British dealer. At the time I ordered (a little over a week ago -- it arrived muy pronto), their price was less than half their current price. (In the 45 minutes it took to write, edit, and post this review, several stores carrying this disk came and went, and the prices were all over the place.) A word to the wise...
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|I have been an Adam Lambert fan from the day he walked on to the stage of American Idol.  I pre-ordered this cd 6 months ago and it was well worth the wait.  Adam has out done himself this time.  There is not one song on this cd that I do not love. From the poppy dance tunes to the heart wrenching ballads Adam puts his heart and soul into every single note that he sings.  This has album of the year written all over it and no one deserves it more than Adam!!!
B003GYEGNO|5.0|I read this because someone said that today's events are hauntingly similar.  I found the plot to be fascinating and let other things go until I finished the book.
B0060D0Z0G|5.0|It was wonderful to be able to order and watch instantly this movie.  The clarity was wonderful and really enjoyed the movie
B007IXWL2C|5.0|A beautiful ending to a beautiful series. I picked it up and could not put it down. And now it is over, I feel like I need to read it again to catch all that I might have missed.<br /><br />I decided that I wanted to also experience this series as the audiobook.  At first I did not care for the narrator, she made Ana seem much younger than her 21 years, but after a while she grew on me.  This series is even more enjoyable and intense in the audio format.  I see myself reliving this series again and again in the future.  For those who have gotten caught up in the hype and have not tried it, you are missing a truly beautiful journey of love between two loveable people.

B000KKPN5C|5.0|I purchased this small flash five (5) years ago from my local camera shop.  At the time, I wasn't ready to make a huge purchase on a big speedlight and I found the SB-400 worked perfectly with my D40.  I used this flash exclusively for about two years until I purchased my big flash, the SB-600.  Since then, I've mainly used my SB-600 about 75% of the time and my SB-400 about 25%.  Personally, there were times when I needed a small amount of lighting and this small flash did a great job.<br /><br />I've recently found a great use for my SB-400.  I now use it on my D7000 when I have my 40mm micro lens attached.  This Spring, I've taken a lot of close up floral shots.  Using the SB-400 flash (along with my StoFen diffuser) enhances and brightens up the flowers considerably. The colors seem to pop out.<br /><br />I've been using two Sanyo Eneloop AA rechargeable batteries with this flash. BTW, great batteries to use in any flash!<br /><br />The SB-400 is a wonderful compact flash to use.  It's not a fancy flash and very simple to use.  It's light and portable when I don't feel like carrying around my heavy flash.<br /><br />I've used this flash both indoors and outdoors.  It works great as a fill-in flash to brighten dark areas or shadows.  I've been happy with the results.<br /><br />I guess the one thing that amazes me, it's not a harsh flash considering there are no buttons or settings to tweak.<br /><br />The price is so affordable I believe everyone should have this flash in their camera bag.<br /><br />**  Update 05/17/12  **<br /><br />I've uploaded three pictures (bumble bee, peony, and yellow azalea) in the gallery.  This shows how well this compact flash works with the 40mm micro lens.<br /><br />**  Update 05/27/12  **<br /><br />I recently purchased the Nikon Coolpix P7100.  I tried it out with my SB-400 flash and the end results were beautiful.  I've uploaded two pictures (blue hydrangea and white stewartia flower) to show the results of this winning combination.  I'm amazed how well this combination feels in my hand.

0810983915|5.0|This book is a really good book. The main setting takes place during summer time. In the beginning of the book it was just the start of summer, and Greg just wanted to stay inside and play video games all day. But his mom wanted him to go out and do stuff. So Greg went to his friend Rowley's club pool.They kept ordering lots of smoothies. They didn't realize they had to pay for everything they ordered so when Rowley's dad got the bill he was mad and made Rowley tell Greg he wasn't aloud to go over to there pool anymore. Also Rowley's dad made them pay for all the stuff, it was 83 dollars. But they didn't have any money. That was the problem, how were they going to get enough money? Then Greg came up with the idea to start a V.I.P. lawn care service. The service didn't work so well. So since Greg's birthday was coming up, he asked for money instead of anything else. Then everything turned out good.

B000002O4X|5.0|Certainly one of Barry's greatest cinematic scores rightfully deserving an Oscar .The music transports you to another time and<br />place,creating the right emotions as envisaged by the director as each scene unfolds.<br />Flight over Africa was certainly my favourite,it actually gives you that feeling of soaring over the great plains of africa, while giving you goose pimples !<br />There are many talented musicians who do compose great scores for movies, but there can be only one John Barry , god doesn't make musicians like him anymore!

0871404133|5.0|Another fine reading by the great evolutionary biologist. If you have not been a reader of Wilson's awesome research and wisdom over the years, you must begin now. A few recommended earlier books by the Pulitzer Prize winner: CONSILIENCE, THE DIVERSITY OF LIFE, THE FUTURE OF LIFE.  And an article from Atlantic magazine's NOV 2011 issue, \\"E.O. Wilson's Theory of Everything\\".  His concept of  'Eusocialism', a powerful new look into issues like genetics and sociobiology. At least a revolutionary theory of the understanding and education of his TOE.

After I finished I had to buy the other two! It's a good book, people need to stop looking at it the wrong way and just enjoy the book. If you dont like it then why did you buy it, okay that is my two sense.

B004FOA84A|4.0|Fire Maple put together a very entertaining game with this one. The only reason I am giving this 4 stars instead of five is because it is so short. It downloaded to my Kindle fire without any trouble.  This game has wonderful graphics, a very engaging puzzle, and kept my interest very well.  It was a good game and I hated to see it end.  I hope to see more from this company.
B007Z9QWVK|5.0|No matter what, there are always going to be people that expect to get the meaning of life out of every movie, cartoon and commercial.  W.E. is an excellent film.  I thought the idea of adding the parallel couple's story was great and the sporadic exchanges between the two Wallies was also great.  For the ones too young to remember the story when the story happened, you learn a lot about the Royals. Costumes and sets are stunning.  You will not be disappointed seeing this film.
B007BRJYF2|4.0|I downloaded this to my Kindle Fire and found it an enjoyable game.  I didn't give it five stars only because one of the puzzles wasn't explained so I didn't know what I was supposed to do, thus, I had to skip that one which was frustrating.  I also found it hard to see some of the items owing to the small screen.  However, the storyline was enjoyable (I'm an Alice fan!) and the puzzles and searches were varied enough to hold my attention.  It took me a couple days to work thorough it because I have very limited time to play, but I couldn't wait to get back to it when I had a moment. It also downloaded beautifully, no glitches at all.
B004VD3YIM|5.0|I use this app with with my nook and a Foscam and works flawlessly. No complaints. Probably better than the software the comes with the Foscam. I'm using the F18910W model camera.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This is the second Fire Maple game I purchased (Grisley Manor was the first).  I sincerely hope this company will design more soon.  This downloaded to my Kindle Fire perfectly and was a joy to play.  The graphics are very detailed and beautiful, the music is lovely, and the game kept my interest to the end. Although other reviews have said it was too simple and thus went too quickly, it took me several days (novice gamer) to complete.  The only disappointing thing was that it ended rather abruptly--I would have liked to see the city blossoming anew.  I'd recommend this to any hidden object fans.

B006MVJ2L4|5.0|Many of us were waiting with bated breath on how Adam's 2nd album would be -- but it was no need for worry -- the album is brilliant!  So many good songs -- and, like his last album, it's interesting how some people have some favorites and others have others.  Mine are (a) the bonus track \\"Runnin',\\" the track that contains Adam's highest high vocal -- AMAZING! -- and needs to be a single; (b) \\"Chokehold,\\" which has the hookiest hook I've heard in a long time \\"...bring it on back!  Bring it on back! Bring it on back!\\"; and (c) \\"Cuckoo,\\" which I was not so impressed with on the snippets that were released a month or so ago, but now that I've heard it on the finished album with all its bells and whistles, it's an awesome dance track.  Lovin' this album!
0307946711|2.0|So here's the thing, I only got a bit over 100 pages into this book and I had to quit.  David Nicholls has a knack, an incredible one, for painting a scene in a book that you can really see.  There are a few passages that just punch you in the face with their accuracy that you know you are seeing the exact thing the writer intended you to see.  Here's an example: \\"She had once studied fashion in London but these days ran a village antiques shop, selling expensive rugs and chandeliers to genteel Oxford with great success.  She still carried with her that aura of having been something-in-the-Sixties....but with no apparent sadness or regret she had given this up for a resolutely respectable, secure, comfortable family life.\\"  Perfect, I get the complexity of this character and why (her past) immediately.  Good writing!<br /><br />Here's the problem with Nicholls.  He thinks he's good, or at least he understands he has some knack for distilling, and delivering, and he LOVES to pat himself on the back.  And the way it comes off in the book is this self-congratulatory overdone yuck.  Worse, the characters (at least in the first third of the book) HATE themselves.  They are borderline suicidal, I tell you.  And that's where he fails.  I think he's trying to catch teenage angst that never gets resolved and so evolves into twenty-something treading in bottomlessness.  But it comes off as this true self-loathing, that's so hard to understand (at least for the female character: she was top of her class more or less, and I get her anti-capatilst penchant, it makes sense why she gives up on her activism, but why does that translate to enjoying the self-fulfilling prophecy of picking a terrible fast food job and using it as proof that her dreams were always worthless?  And even if a natural course of failure, why does she revel in punishing herself?)<br /><br />Ever seen an actor get big and then s/he keeps winking at him/herself in their great acting in the next piece you see them in?  That's this book!  And I promise, I'm not an embittered reader who wants the magic of some past book to repeat itself, because I've never read anything else from this author!<br /><br />Please, do not torture yourself!  I want my $10 back!<br /><br />ghem in?  That's this book!  And I promise, I'm not an embittered reader who wants the magic of some past book to repeat itself, because I've never read anything else from this author!<br /><br />Please, do not torture yourself!

B002G1YPH0|5.0|Anything better than this is bigger, more expensive and definitely past the point of diminishing returns.  Unless you are Johnny Super Overclocker looking for the Maximum Extreme Everthing, this is the one to get. Just used it on my new Ivy build and went into the new GA-z77x-d3h motherboard and set the multiplier to 45 and bang, the computer runs at 4.5ghz.  I'm happy, don't want to do any other tweaks because this thing is plenty fast for my needs.  Would another heat sink do just as well?  Probably, but I know this one does the job quietly and cheaply.
0345803485|1.0|There's already a plethora of reviews on this novel that have already articulated exactly how I feel - just take a look at all the one-star reviews!  I went into this novel with high hopes, only to find that I continued the novel to the very bitter end only out of curiosity at how bad this book could get.  One of the reviewers commented that it felt like a teenager had written this novel - and alas, that precisely sums it all up.  I'm all for overly simplistic writing styles when the plot needs to feel rushed (ie. \\"The Hunger Games\\"), but I quickly realized that the writing style was not simplistic by purpose, but amateurish on the author's part.  The whole novel felt slightly mocking, as though the book was really meant to be a joke and everyone mistakenly took it seriously.  Did I miss the punch line?  Besides the writing style issues, the characters were incredibly boring and flat, as others have already mentioned, and the plot was laughable.  I'm not usually so critical of erotica, since clearly the intent is for steamy scenes, but even those scenes were so short and lacked any semblance of detail that I was left cold.  I couldn't help but provide my own commentary to my boyfriend while reading this mess: \\"This is such a pathetic book\\", \\"My God, a 5 year old could write better than this\\" and \\"How the hell is this a bestseller?  If that's all it takes, I need to send off manuscripts to publishing houses PRONTO!\\"<br /><br />I wish I could provide some alternate options for you folks reading this, but unfortunately I've yet to come across any erotica in novel-format (not short stories) that I particularly cared for.  If I find some, I'll let you know.<br /><br />Bottom line: let's please get some quality novels (particularly erotica) on the bestseller lists.  Ladies, please stop buying this trash.
1569242739|1.0|Really disappointed in this cookbook. I made the red velvet and the so-called fluffy buttercream icing and it just didn't whip properly. I used a Kitchenaid hand mixer - not the stand mixer so maybe that would have made a difference - but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter.

B007SSEBCU|2.0|This movie is made up of a bunch of flashbacks, but they are not in chronological order.  It keeps jumping around to different parts of her life in a random order.  I am not a history buff, so it was difficult for me to follow and know what was going on in the movie.  My husband loves history and enjoyed the movie much more than I did because he could follow along, but since this is my opinion I only gave it two stars.  He probably would have given it four.

Finally, I disconnected the microphone to isolate the problem and hit record. The noise was still present. I missed the 30 day return due to travel and therefore this was just a bad purchase from China. I don't reccommend this product.

B000006SBY|5.0|Bryan Adams' musical career is so heavily linked to the mid 1980's that many people,including myself were totally unaware that it actually began at the start of the decade. Considering the popularity of Rush,Canada was beginning to have quite a foothold in the rock world. The music in general was in a very interesting place in 1980. There was a strange degree of open mindedness that existed where popular interest could kind of go a number of ways-either towards more danceable types of music,or poppy ballads or heavier guitar rock. The New Romantic sound and new wave were both kind of in early stages at this juncture and were intermingling with this too. So for a brief moment the pop music world was actually in the most open and available state to different styles of the music than maybe it ever has been. It wouldn't last very long. But it presented an opportunity for many an artist to begin their careers with a measure of variety. And Bryan Adams counts among them.<br /><br />  Nothing against bigger hits such as [[ASIN:B000002GGU Reckless]] but this is one of Bryan Adams' strongest albums in my opinion. One reason is it shows you how comfortable he is in a variety of musical settings. \\"Hidin' From Love\\",\\"Win Some,Lose Some\\",'Wait And See\\" and \\"State Of Mind\\" are sprightly,mainstream new wave inflected pop/rock of the type that would make him famous. The difference is how clean the production is,similar in style to the presentation of Rick Springfield around this time. \\"Give Me Your Love\\" is a more slick David Foster type R&B/pop type ballad (some would refer to it as soft rock) but provides an introduction to his ability to pitch woo. \\"Don't Ya Say It\\" and \\"Try To See It My Way\\" both provide him with more of a dance/rock element. Not exactly disco as it has a very obvious edge to it. But it's not something he ever really explored again in his music. Which is too bad because these are two of his strongest songs.<br /><br />  Unless your a Bryan Adams fan or hugely curious about musicians and their histories,this is probably not the sort of album you'd go right for. But if you are it's a big treat to know this is out there. It's got all the basic ingredients of what Adam's represented musically. At the same time they're presented in a way that many would not be used to hearing from him. Considering the unique,raspy voice manner he presented the dancier material here it's possible he might've been able to work that angle of his sound a bit more in the way that....Rod Stewart and far more successfully Steely Dan did. But Bryan Adams is his own guy basically. And he knew right off what style he felt most comfortable with and less so. It would'nt be long before the blonde,baby faced rock and roller would take the public by storm and actually come of as a very likeable figure. But even at this early stage,it's all there and you really don't have to look hard for it.urious about musicians and their histories,this is probably not the sort of album you'd go right for.

B0053VKP8S|2.0|I had this piece for a while and it suited my needs of sending audio from my new tv to my old dvd/surround sounds system.  It only pushed out 2.1 stereo, which I expected.  I went to turn it on one day and it just makes this awful clicking noise.  I tried a few things and it seems that it's just done working.

What started out as a good story soon took a turn south when all he did was more of the same for being in prison. What happened to the cops? Were they on a break all the time when DJ was ransaking the area? OMG! Entertaining yes, and the story had so much promise, it just didn't deliver in a good way.
0345803485|1.0|There is much better erotica out there people! This is a story of a sick relationship, not because of the S&M but because the motivation for her being involved is to please him.  That is nothing more than a poor story line to string a few weak sex scenes together.

B005LAIHGI|3.0|This is Sascha Baren Cohen's first try at an actual scripted movie instead of a faux-documentary, and it's nice that he's trying new approaches to his satirical style of comedy instead of going through the motions on his approach. However the jokes started to feel like they were going through the motions; don't get me wrong, I love politically incorrect humor, Borat and Bruno both had my sides sore in laughter, but a few of the jokes in this one fell flat for me because it seemed like it was being crude for the sake of being crude.<br /><br />For example, when Aladeen first learns how to masturbate it just wasn't really that funny to me, it didn't really push any envelopes and didn't add much to the story besides establishing that he's had the easy life before. Also when Anna Ferris and Aladeen hold hands inside a woman's vagina, it didn't really serve a purpose to the plot or the characters and just seemed like it was trying too hard. Also the crude racist FBI agent and the two Middle Easterners scaring Westerners on an air-craft felt very reminiscent of Harold & Kumar: Escape from Guantanamo Bay. Ben Kingsley's character felt underdeveloped as the main villain, and his character was rather forgettable, it's a shame Sascha B. Cohen couldn't write more jokes for his character.<br /><br />So that's what I didn't like about it, but there is still a lot to like in the Dictator. I said some of the crude stuff didn't work for me however when Aladeen was on a zipline and had to 'lose weight' that part I found pretty funny since it was just so silly. I liked Anna Ferris' character, her bleeding heart liberal character was a sharp contrast to, well, a Dictator. The torture scene had me laughing hard, Aladeen's decision-making in his country was all pretty funny stuff, and who could forget the Middle Eastern music covering famous American songs? The Dictator is a pretty silly and fun movie if you don't mind politically incorrect humor and are used to Sascha Baren Cohen's style of humor. He's definately a genius when it comes to satire and parody, however this one just didn't do it for me as much as his other offerings.le of humor.

0446547654|4.0|While reading this book I felt that it was telling me how something might happen in my life to bring me back to my first love. The first love for anyone is hard to forget and even harder to forget when you are faced with them years after being apart. The death of a dear friend did bring them back together and years later their love is jsut as strong as ever but when Dawson becomes a hero he ends up living with his love in an unbelievable way. His heart was implanted in her son so in a way she ended up with the one thing that she could not live without about him.

Safe Haven is about a woman who escapes her abused husband to a town states away to start over and even after he finds her she does end up getting out of that marriage and into one she can truly be proud of.

B007L3BMGA|1.0|I often read books that have been hyped about, just to see if their any good and to see what the fuss is about. I'm not sure what the craze is about here. I gave up reading about a third of the way into it as it was just so boring and badly written! A lot of the detail in the book is completely unnecessary, for example putting full transcripts of back and forth emails INCL email address, date, time, blah blah blah. Complete page wasting that makes for very tedious writing. And for an 'erotic' book, I have never read one so dull!
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|He kept all us Glamberts waiting an extra 2 months for the realease of Trespassing, and let me tell you, it was well worth the wait.  It delivers great sounds, and his amazing voice as always.  The way he arranged the cd was great, the first half being the upbeat, dance, get you moving type of songs, with the latter half of the album slowing down to some soulful, get to see the darker side of Adam songs.  Adam's vocals are beyond amazing, my personal favorite being Runnin' due to him going deep on the vocals to give us an Adam we don't very often get to hear.  Love it, love it, love it!!!  Great job Adam, and you have a Glambert here for life :)
B0073XORCY|4.0|That question is what Ian Anderson poses for \\"Thick as a Brick 2,\\" some 40 years post the original classic rock epic that helped make Jethro Tull into American stars. Appears Ian has been goaded about writing this for several years now, and finally took up the challenge. It's surprisingly good, given the idea of writing a full on prog-rock concept album in the 2010's.<br /><br />Gerald is given a batch of alternate futures to have arrived at, with Anderson exploring the themes with an obvious glee. It's his liveliest album in many a year, sketching out where Gerald might have been at 50, becoming a banker, a derelict, soldier, singer and \\"A Most Ordinary Man.\\" Anderson also does a fair amount of self-reference, down to teasing with lyrics from \\"Locomotive Breath\\" (on Cosy Corner\\") and revisiting musical themes from the original album. His flute dominates, along with staccato blasts of guitar, folk-rock interludes, and spoken word set-ups to several of Gerald's possible lives.<br /><br />It should be noted that, while several Tull alumni are among the players. this is still Anderson's solo show. It could easily be his own musings of \\"What If's Maybes and Might Have Beens\\" had he not been rock's best known flute player. You also won't hear anything that sounds like an obvious single, even though the original still managed one. What you do get in Anderson the ringleader, putting aside the classical ambitions from some of his solo albums to what could easily pass for a Tull album from the 80's and 90's. If you ever wondered about the boy-wonder poet or treated yourself to an afternoon puzzling over the St Cleve newspaper (now a website), you're going to get many growing spins of \\"Thick as a Brick 2.\\"

B006MVJ2L4|5.0|Firstly, like everyone else has said about this album, the first half is jumpy electro-pop jams.  If you like Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, and the sort then you'll enjoy these.  The last half are darker ballads.  His vocals are extraordinary; when you think about what music is released nowadays, most of it is auto-tuned and the vocalist doesn't have talent.  Adam Lambert is not the case--his vocals are still as spectacular as they were in his Idol and For Your Entertainment days.  The tracks are catchy, well produced, and overall surprisingly good.  This is an excellent sophomore album. I would recommend this album.  The sound isn't glam rock like his debut album, but it doesn't mean this album isn't as good!  GO GET IT!!! :D

044024630X|4.0|The Affair is another one of Lee Child's Jack Reacher novels. Jack Reacher is big mean Military Policeman who doesn't take much crap from anybody. Jack Reacher books are my brain candy. This book is a prequel to the very first Reacher novel The Killing Floor. I hadn't read it so I guess I have something to look forward to reading.<br /><br />In this one Reacher is sent down to Mississippi by the Pentagon to go undercover to make sure that a murder investigation is being conducted properly. While there he hooks up with the local sheriff Elizabeth Deveraux.  Well poor Elizabeth falls head over heels for the handsome Jack Reacher. One feature of the town is that there is a freight train that roars through town exactly at midnight every night and is so big and fast it shakes everything in town. Well guess what, Jack's hotel is right next to the train and Jack and Liz time their \\"peak expression for the affection they have for each other\\" to coincide with the arrival of the train at midnight.<br /><br />I thought that was hilarious, but they are so good at it they start using the expression \\"catching the train.\\" I just rolled laughing. I can do that you see, it is my brain candy.<br /><br />Plot, what plot, oh yeah, Jack figures out eventually that he has been played, crossed, and double crossed and well of course he has to take corrective action and he does in true Billy Jack style.<br /><br />I give this book four stars out of five. Don't you judge me!
B007ZT2Q88|3.0|I agree with the review of Mr. Miller above -- this is too short. How long does it take to produce and record songs you don't even need to write since they are \\"standards\\"?? -- classic torch songs. I also wanted to remark that I also agree that the Stooges should not just going around and playing the same old songs over and over -- they always play the \\"hits\\" but the Stooges' albums have a lot of other songs worthy of performing. Plus, why doesn't Iggy do some of his solo stuff with the Stooges? They are certainly able to play it. That way, his \\"Stooges\\" tours will be more interesting.

0345803485|5.0|I actually stumbled across this book via Facebook after my cousin posted a hilarious recent skit about it from NBC's Saturday Night Live. So tickled I was by the skit that I took a peek into reading the synopsis. Upon first glance I was intrigued by the storyline as I could relate to the main character. Not too into erotic fantasies and such but not much of a prude I am, I decided to pick this book up and give it a try. Much to my surprise the storyline and dialogue flows so well, so well in fact that I actually immediately purchased the book after reading the sample. I would consider that all pick this book up as it is much more than some filthy book full of tricks and others stuff that might be deemed \\"nonsense,\\" but actually a deep look into the emotional frame of mind of two very different but very similar people. A young woman and man struggling with the throws of true passion and adoration. I am only on chapter 13 and I must admit at one point I considered putting this book down because I was overwhelmed with some details where I felt this was beyond what I bargained for ...but proceeding further I realized that it was actually what I figured initially, a really intriguing story about 2 strangers relationship and the passionately emotional transformations I anticipate/hope to take place between both of these characters. I am thoroughly enjoying it and hope that it continues to be a pleasant surprise for the remainder of this book and the others.

B005LAIGP0|4.0|Hammer Films, well known in the past for their Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee Dracula films, returns with Woman in Black (also see the excellent home adaptation for TV, if you get a chance), starring Harry Potter's lead actor, Radcliffe, who plays a real estate agent sent in to collect the papers of a deceased old woman, who died in her mansion in the middle of a wide open marshland.<br /><br />The tide rolls in as our lead investigates the hell house, and experiences many chilling moments, leading to a boiling finale that will make the hair stand on the back of your neck as only any horrific sequence of images and sound can do.<br /><br />Many frightful moments build the tension as Arthur grudgingly explores this hellish home of the dead woman, with an ominous, evil presence determined to end the lives of any one foolish enough to trespass. A well told, building horror tale not to be missed by any fan of haunted ghost movies. Many dark, very disturbing moments abound.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

B007XF0X6G|3.0|This is a review of the 3D in the movie, for those interested in 3D:<br /><br />With Clash of the Titans 3D, movie goers new to 3D were excited to see the next big 3D movie starring Sam Worthington (also from Avatar) shortly after Avatar 3D hit theaters and became a world wide phenomenon, igniting a new wave of 3D entertainment in theaters and at home.<br /><br />Prime Focus had the task of converting Clash on an extremely short, tight schedule to meet a deadline, and the results showed in the execution, which paled drastically in comparison to the strong three dimensions seen in Avatar 3D. Clash 3D didn't live up to the expectations of how great 3D can be, as seen in Avatar 3D, as Clash 3D offered a generally weak 3D experience, with very little 3D parallax layer separation, resulting in a flat look.<br /><br />So with Wrath of the Titans 3D, the expectations were much higher with better 3D software and more time to convert the 2D film (again, a 2D to 3D conversion instead of being filmed in 3D), because how could they go much lower than Clash 3D afterall?<br /><br />Wrath of the Titans 3D is thankfully a step up from Clash 3D, but not by much. The 3D is apparent throughout, and fairly consistent from shot to shot, but don't expect Avatar strength 3D here. Yes, it is a conversion, where they have to duplicate a single film into two separate files, then offset one eye file to create three dimensions, filling in the gaps as they progress.<br /><br />Unfortunately, they didn't push the offset far enough, and the results are average 3D at best. At no point did the 3D \\"wow\\" me like Avatar 3D did. That translates to 3D that doesn't take things very far, and we end up with low to average parallax layer separation, with minimal distance between foreground to background objects and characters. It's not bad at all, it's just not as great as it could have been. Most of the film feels a bit flat, but some shots stand out, in particular the finale. Maybe we'll get strong 3D for the 3rd film. Ultimately, worth a look if you enjoyed the first film, Clash of the Titans 3D.<br /><br />3D Overall: 3/5<br />3D Parallax Layers: 3/5<br />3D Depth: 3/5<br />3D Character Dimension: 3/5<br /><br />STORY: The story here is pretty basic, a quest adventure with a small team led by Worthington's character, the son of Zeus, with the aid of his father played by Liam Neeson, on their way to confront Hades and his evil companion determined to re-ignite the father of all gods, a lava giant.

B0064X7FVE|5.0|I LOVE this app, and use it every morning. Crisp and colorful. Allows storage of multiple locations. Gives the weather now, for the next 36 hours, and for 10 days. Radar and videos also available. My thanks and appreciation to the developer(s).
B00785P2QC|4.0|super fun game! best is that its free!energy takes forever tho. reminds me a lot of Sim city of the olden years!
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|Incredible. I can transfer movies, pictures and text files back and forth between my PC and my Kindle Fire, quickly and efficiently. None of the hassle or cost associated with a physical cord. If I would offer any suggestion, it would be to fine tune the documentation. It took me a while to figure out how to get the app working. Other than that, this app is just what the doctor ordered. My thanks and appreciation to the developer.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Not only are the graphics wonderful but the variety of things to aid you in each level is fun ALSO'!  I LOVE THIS GAME!!
B0064T6LV8|5.0|It always amazes me how some of the best apps are free. Pinball Deluxe Free is realistic and fast paced. Years ago, it was a quarter a game to play pinball. Good luck even finding a real machine any more. But now, I can play anywhere I go, any time I feel like it. My thanks and appreciation to the developers.
B002M2T1UO|5.0|I watched this series during its initial run on FX network, several years ago. I began watching it midway through season 2, and it instantly became appointment television. I have since purchased the entire series on DVD and watched it all the way through, and it was even better the second time around (albeit, no commercials, no series gap, was definitely a plus).<br />What makes this cop show stand out is the writing and the acting. What you have is a fictional district in LA, one with high crime and an underfunded police department trying to control the streets. Enter Vic Mackey, who consistently pushes the morality line in an effort to curb the crime. The statement that sums up Vic Mackey is \\"Does the end justify the means?\\".<br />The four members of the strike team all bring their own baggage to the table, and the writing team of Shawn Ryan, Glen Mazzara (and others) play the personalities of the entire police department off of each other. At times, you feel you are part of the show because the acting and character portrayals are very consistent from season to season. At times you feel like you are at your own office with the different types of people that you have to deal with every day.<br />Walton Goggins portrayal of Shane Vendrell is one of my favorite performances of TV... the downward spiral of one of the most respected members of the strike team is a very understated career performance (let's just say you will HATE that character when the show is over!).<br /><br />The end of the series is one of the best endings to a series ever. You need to see it to believe it. I have also seen the Wire (many people compare these two shows), the Wire was a fantastic show as well, although they are two very different shows. The Shield is a faster paced show, one where quick decision making is essential to the character and story development.<br /><br />Stop reading this, go buy the series, you will not be disappointed.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I wouldn't know what to do without this app. I no longer have scraps of paper floating around and getting lost.

My thanks and appreciation to the developers.
0345803485|1.0|I'm an avid bookworm and normally a fan of erotica but the inability of the author to string a sentence together was so distracting that I gave up after page 20. It's unbelievably disappointing that this series has been such a success. Don't bother.
B0045JEPXU|5.0|Got this CD for a gift...It is an excellent CD...Hope to see Pitbull try to do some stuff on his own instead of always doing duets, but the music is fantastic!
0345803485|4.0|First, let me clear up a rumor about this book.... It is NOT about a younger girl falling for an OLDER rich guy! Why oh why are people saying that? Both the characters are in there twenties!! That was the reason I bought the book (& for the romance aspect) & I was sorely disappointed. Second, the main character (Ana) is a 21 yr old VIRGIN, yes you heard that right, who has NEVER given a blo# job or masturbated (oh did I mention she's beautiful?). So you can see already how unbelievable this story is. Third, there is NO plot. Rich guy who likes submissive women meets clumsy Ana with no special traits (except the virgin thing) & falls crazy head over heels (psychotically) in love. The End. Forth, the male character (Mr. Grey) is in his 20's yet runs a major coorperation, flys & owns helicopters, airplanes, gliders, etc.., can play the piano, and many more rediculious things that NO boy in their 20's can do. If Mr. Grey was in his mid 30's or even early 40's (or even a vampire) I would be able to believe the author a bit more but this was just silly. And lastley, the whole story is Ana \\"rolling her eyes\\" as she \\"bites her lip\\" and tries to decide if she can tolerate Mr. Geys dominance issue....which gets boring fast because its obvoius they cant go a day without eachother.<br /><br />Deep down I really want to give this book a 1 star review, however, since I read it in two days I don't think that's fair. The writing is so poor that I'm shocked it's on any bestseller list (she repeats the same phrases constantly to the point where all you can focus on is how dumb the author is) but I guess since the subject (dominance/submissive behavior) is so racy, everyone wanted to read it. This is purely a BEACH read or a book to get you in the mood (sex was the only decent thing in the book). The romance/ plot is non-existent. How they are going to turn this into a movie is beyond me...its 99.9% sex. I recommend if you must read this to try the sample first to see if you can standthe poor writing. I will not be buying the sequel. Too bad this could have been a good book if there was a plot and better writing.
B007FROH4G|5.0|I cried openly on the plane when reading this book - I don't think I have ever been so touched by a book - I ended up testing my memory as I read.
B0000019PA|5.0|I wasn't a huge fan of these songs until I sat down and listened to them as an album - holy crap!  No tricks, no fancy effects, just raw emotion, a guitar, and some backup.  This needs to be listened to as a complete album to be fully appreciated.
0982633939|4.0|You may not know David Dodge, but you most likely have heard of the Hitchcock film starring Cary Grant and Grace Kelly, on which this book is based.  The film took some liberties with the book, but the book would stand the test of time without the film.  It's the story of John Robie, an infamous and very successful jewel thief who is caught by the French authorities right before WWII breaks out.  Escaping during a prison break while the Nazi's hold France, Robie retires and tries to live the straight life on the beautiful Cote d'Azur after the war.<br /><br />However, a copycat burglar suddenly appears, and to all of France and especially the police, it looks like Le Chat as Robie had been known, is back.  Throw into the mix a mother and her beautiful daughter, both with more jewelry than they need, and all the obvious plot elements fall into place.  The scenes on the rooftop when Robie is tracking and sparring with the real thief are wonderfully done, as are the descriptions of many locale along the Cote d'Azur.<br /><br />When I finished the book, I asked myself if I preferred the book or the film.  I really like the movie, but I think Dodge's original story line was even better than what Hitchcock changed.<br /><br />This edition from Bruin Books is a wonderful re-issue with great introductory and concluding comments.  Bruin is to be commended for their attention to releasing books by a writer many readers should get to know.<br /><br />Recommended highly.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this was such an awesome game I recommend. it to everyone in the world.  cool beans I'm telling you. download it
B00773YOB4|5.0|Really a terrific album.  I particularly enjoyed the covers of the 2 Bob Dylan songs.  They were done differently enough to make them fresh and new.  But really, every song is a good listen.  Great music and great lyrics.
B005C9YZIW|1.0|I purchase Planet Earth (Six-Disc Special Edition) [Blu-ray] (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005C9YZIW/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title) the product came in the window allotted. The cover and the box all say BLUE-RAY, but the individual disk ARE DVD!  I purposely bought the blue-ray because it takes advantage of the amazing footage that BBC put into making this documentary (50 dollars for Blue ray vs 20 for DVD).<br /><br />It just seems really sleazy to have physically gone through and swapped out each on the 6 disks, for lesser quality item, the DVD format.<br /><br />Avoid!!
B007WV05GY|1.0|unbelievably boring stay away from this movie.  save your time and money. there is just no words to explain how meaningless it is.
0307951529|5.0|As someone who read Chris's original book, The Art of Nonconformity, I was curious what new ideas Chris would have in his follow-up book. The subject matter is pretty intriguing, and the author makes the best use of it. The book is split into the following parts: Unexpected Entrepreneurs, Taking It to the Streets, and Leverage and Next Steps.<br /><br />My favorite chapters were \\"Follow your Passion...Maybe,\\" \\"The New Demographics,\\" \\"The One Page Business Plan,\\" and \\"Hustling: The Gentle Art of Self-Promotion.\\"  While some parts were slow, overall it was an intereting book as the author made a point of choosing entrepreneurs whose businesses \\"involved no special skills\\" and had \\"fewer than five employees\\" among other traits.<br /><br />His formula for success is primitively easy: Find a product or service that you sell, find customers willing to pay for it, and settle on a way to get paid--how you'll be exchanging a product or service for money. For that formula alone, that book isn't exactly eye-opening. However, where it shines, is focusing on many real inexpensive startups (they weren't all limited to one hundred dollars, although it's a catchy slogan) and finding the value of such businesses in terms of what does each individual idea that a business is built upon have to bring to the table, by example of case studies and simple business tips.
B007C4ZJ0S|3.0|Gina Carano is exceptional and we should see more of her. The stunts are real, the fights are real, she gets beat up and beats guys up and is wonderfult to watch her.<br /><br />The movie sucks, though. Michael Douglas and Antonio Banderas are terribly miscasted and totally out of place. Too bad.

Problem solved.<br />5)For the price you pay, you could get an awesome, super-high quality headset.. something like grado-  but it will be wired. 7.1 is subjective y'now?
B006QVRVJK|1.0|Don't let the star cast fool you.  The story line is weak, the writing is crap and it is overacted to try and make it mean something.  Very disappointing and the title is the only believable part of the movie... It is the beginning of carnage of a few great careers.  All in all, it's 2 hours of my life that I will never get back.
B007I8S1TY|5.0|Very practical orientation, very nice style of writing and even some humor. While the topic itself implies heavy material, it's been the most easy to read tech book I've come across - they somehow manage to keep even the dry stuff interesting. It's worth reading just because of that - and if you're writing tech books,  I strongly encourage you to buy the book and copy the style ;-)
B0077ATSSQ|4.0|We all know the story of 9/11 but not like this.  A child's view of loss, of not quite fitting in a world of normality facing a hard reality.  The story reveals human nature in many formats and the pain and joy of family.  It all comes together through the search for answers which many of us spend our entire lives looking for, but this small boy systematically calls upon humankind to bring him to a conclusion where he learns to live for what he now has and accepts the shadow of what once was.  Definitely worth watching...
B0079XNWQA|5.0|After reading reviews on Jason's latest CD, and also having ordered one, I was a little disappointed with what I read.  But, after receiving the CD, I listened to it quite a few times, each time liking it a little more, than just plain loving it!  The music and lyrics are not typical of Jason's other CD's, but I think anyone who loves his music will find this different, but nonetheless, excellent.  I'm going to see Jason in concert in August, and I can hardly wait to see him perform his \\"Love is a Four Letter Word\\" music in person!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I bought this on a whim and boy am i glad i did!  To call these books is a bit of a stretch though, more like a bunch of short stories put together as a book is a lot more accurate description.  I'm glad i bought all of the \\"books\\" together though because to be honest, if i had bought them seperately, i don't think i would of finished the series. The first two books were a bit slow for me but once i got into the thrid book i totally understood why he did what he did with the first two books.  Great series, and very addictive to read.  I just had to keep on reading to see how it ended! Keep the series coming please!
0345803485|5.0|I've heard all the rage about this book and have seen grown women blush while reading this book. So I got it to read. It is quite risque and has made blush a few times. But that aside, I love these 2 characters. The emails back and forth are awesome........ And their personalities/spirits/sense of humor is quite like my own. A great read.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app. I started a reading plan on it and it brings the historical side of the Bible into it and it's wonderful. It reminds me to read it at a time of my choice so I don't miss any days. This app is perfect!

B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I'm a huge fan of the original Oregon trail and so after I downloaded the sequel i loved it as well. sadly this game has too many glitches to continue loving.<br /><br />a major problem I had was the constant time resets! every animal,  home, and business was reset to well over 400 hours several times so I couldn't even play the game.<br /><br />another problem is with the task given.everytime I completed certain tasks it would acknowledge it so I had to start the tasks over and over until it worked.<br /><br />this game had so much potential but it doesn't live up to it. if the developers work on improving this game I will happily redownload this game,  but until then &hellip; uninstall&hellip;
B001FW58D6|5.0|This is so good that even those of my friends and family who have no particular interest in SF are hooked. The storyline is clever and compelling, with both stand-alone episodes and others that advance the longer story arc. You could conceivably skip episodes but I can't imagine why you'd want to.<br /><br />What really makes this series are the stellar performances, most notably by John Noble, an actor so fine I'm at a loss to praise him as much as he deserves. He is riveting - charming, crazy, childlike, sly, ferociously intelligent, off the wall, always surprising. A real joy to watch. Anna Torv is spot on as Olivia Dunham, reserved, smart, brave, wounded but carrying on in a quiet and affecting way. She never strikes a pose and that alone is a rarity. Compare her beautifully unflashy and genuine manner to the ludicrous carryings on of Joanne Kelly as Myka of Warehouse 13, who appears to think every scene is a fashion shoot. Joshua Jackson as Peter Bishop is growing as an actor before our eyes, and growing into a part that slowly reveals the character to be much deeper than we initially were led to believe.<br /><br />Visually, the series is outstanding and, if the actors weren't so strong, they'd be hard put to compete with Walter's lab and the scene-stealing Jean the cow. The supporting cast is completely up to the mark. With such a strong start, and what is obviously a carefully thought out backstory with exceptional writing to support it, my only fear is that this series won't have a chance to play out to the end due to its unfortunate venue: Fox, the network that's notorious for killing all their most promising children before they can walk. This particular child, however, is already running so maybe there's hope.
B004VSTP4Y|5.0|I was totally engulfed by Shiver, basically speed read Linger (found it a bit boring - however read it straight after The Scorpio Races which I LOVED!).

B003TNM2K6|1.0|Oh, boy, such an uplifting, heart-warming film! Except not.    So many negatives-- where to begin?    -Cliche' character of a zealot who tries to convince everyone that the events are caused by God because He's angry.  -Uneccesarily gory.  -I had to skip ahead minutes at a time too often because I was thinking, \\"I know exactly what's about to happen, and it's stupid.\\" And I was right.  -Super awkward first-person-type zoom-ins randomly throughout.  -Unimpressive special effects.  -Horrible ending.    Be sure to read on IMDb all the gory/creepy instances. I can usually look away, but this had so many.  [...]    I'm not generally such a negative Nancy, but I sincerely feel like all the joy of my evening was just sucked away.    The only upside was Toby Jones's acting. And maybe that it gets you thinking, \\"What would I do in this situation? Would people really go as insane as this?\\"    Really only for King fanboys.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I am really enjoying this game and would recommend it even though you pay for the full version.<br />I think it is well laid out and I enjoy the fact that it has a story line.
0393088774|5.0|Paul Krugman explains with incredible clarity:<br /><br />(1) The causes of the current depression;<br />(2) Why policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic refuse to take actions that would end the depression; and<br />(3) How policymakers could easily end the depression quickly.<br /><br />The three things that stuck out in my mind after reading this book were:<br /><br />(1) The current austerity policies benefit rich creditors over poor debtors;<br />(2) Corporations have an interest in preventing governments from solving economic crises because it would weaken corporate arguments that regulation and high taxes are what keep them from creating jobs; and<br />(3) Creditors and corporations prevent governments from ending the depression by promoting the fiction that the depression was caused by immoral debtors spending beyond their means.
0345803485|4.0|I will keep this short as there are tons of reviews to read on this book that go into much deeper detail about my complaints.  Also, please note, I am not a reader of the romance genre at all and I have read only two erotica books.  My husband got this book for me after hearing it discussed on the \\"chick\\" talk radio station here in town.  I have to say that I could not put this book down, I genuinely wanted to find out what is the deal with Grey and what happens to Ana.  I guess that is a credit to the author for creating characters you care about.  That said, this book is not as well written as I would have liked, as I was hoping.  It is supposed to take place in Seattle and revolves around a 21 year old woman.  In the first few chapters I noticed many words that simply are not used in American English, later on I saw the word rucksack and finally figured it out, the author is  Brit.  The publisher should have done a better job editing this novel to Americanize it for the American market.  There were many words that were used so many times over and over and over again it was hard to read at times, and almost angering, perhaps the author would do better with a Thesaurus next to her work station.  These complaints aside, when I did finally look into the author and saw her age, I have to admit she did a good job writing a 21 year old.  I also am bothered by what I see as unrealistic in this novel.  I know, I know, novels ARE fiction.  And while I find myself caring about what happens to Ana, her ability to have sequential orgasms all too easily seems so unrealistic to me that it kills a little of this book for me.  I know, I know, there are indeed some women out there who are really like this, but gee, how convenient for Grey to happen to find one, who is a virgin, for whom he seems to go head over heels for completely out of his character.  This may all be the whole romance genre thing going on then that I am just not used to.  Now, while I feel the writing and editing could have been better and am bothered by the unrealistic heroine, I still couldn't put it down and still want to read the other books and still have shared my copy of this with a friend.  Sort of like an addictive irritant?  Four almost seemed too high, but when you look at the words associated with the number of stars, a 3 being \\"okay\\", a 4 being \\"I liked it\\", and a 5 being \\"I loved it\\", three is definitely too low and 5 is definitely too high, so....

B0074MZSWW|5.0|Unbelievable ! This is best new band I've heard in the past 5 years. Brittney's voice equals or exceeds Janis Joplin's voice. Not on this CD, but you must go to Youtube.com and watch and listen to their rendition of \\"How Many More Times\\", the old Led Zepplin song. Brittney makes Robert Plant sound like an amateur. You must have this CD if you like southern rock and roll. Good sound and engineering on the CD.

B003R0MF5I|5.0|I am no techie and am not into spy stuff, but the characters in this TV series are so enjoyable that it has become my favorite show over the last 10-15 years.

B007V2UGPE|5.0|I'm not thrilled with any game that has things that can only be purchased with real money, but I'm hoping this one will either offer a way to earn those things later or that those extras won't be necessary to progress... I'm not far enough to know yet, but so far it's great fun!<br /><br />Update: This game is amazingly addictive! I just LOVE it!  I had gotten bored (finally!) after playing the original over and over and over (and yes, I caved and spent some money on the darned glu credits... grr...) but now with the update I've been able to enjoy it all over again!  I've already played both versions several times through now and I'm really enjoying the increased difficulty and ability to easily choose any level...<br /><br />It still annoys me to have ads as well as be asked to pay for glu credits, and it's annoying to keep earning loads of coins but have literally nothing to spend them on... I'd think after earing 500k or so you should be able to buy some glu credits with them, even if only a small amount...<br /><br />Regardless, it's a GREAT game!! I spent WAY too much time on it!
1466401885|5.0|Holy cow, this book was AMAZING!!!! Oh, I pray I never tire of these sexy bad boys...Beautiful Disaster was such a pleasant surprise, and Travis grabbed my heart from the moment his eyes fell on his 'Pigeon'!! There were so many things about this story that I loved, it had all of those key moments that make your heart flutter and leave you trying to catch your breath. Dynamic characters, unexpected love, danger, sexual tension off the charts, jealousy, exciting twists, heartbreak that brings tears to your eyes, and ultimately something so beautiful that it's disastrous wake means nothing when all is said and done.<br /><br />McGuire created characters that were so lovable and multi-dimensional, you get hooked from the very start. I loved Abby's snarky attitude, partly because I could tell there was more than meets the eye with her. I could tell she wasn't going to just be a plain jane wallflower, and I was so excited to learn more about her and find out the mystery of the past she was running from. And once that was revealed, WOW! She became so entirely bad-ass and I LOVED her character! I love the story of Abby's past, it intrigued me and just made everything really exciting. It was one of those \\"OH, now I get it-this is awesome!\\" moments, where everything made sense and I found myself wanting to reread everything before the reveal. She's tough, and the walls she's put up around her heart make her decisions so much more understandable and sad.<br /><br />Travis...oh, sweet lord, Travis...this boy had me at hello. This troubled boy was so sexy and tough, with his cocky attitude that hides the sweet, untrusting, intelligent guy underneath. Yes, he was a player that slept around and had many moments of assery, but it never changed how much his character meant to me. He's so much more than meets the eye, which made him that much easier to love! Abby didn't have a chance once they decided to spend so much time together, and I was swooning at all of their tender momentseven before they knew they loved each other. I loved that Travis fell so hard for her, it was a welcome change having the guy be the one that was so utterly smitten he couldn't help himself. Travis was so sweet with Abby, protecting her and trying to win her over even when she didn't want to let herself fall for him. I loved their humor, the fireworks between them, and the untouchable bond that they had through the whole story. It really was beautiful.<br /><br />American and Shep were great secondary characters; America and Abby's history together was exciting, and I loved how close they were. They always had each other's backs, even when the boys were making it a real challenge! Shep was sweet and perfect with America, and his brotherly relationship with Travis was endearing. He knew and understood Travis better than anyone, and it was clear how upsetting Travis' behavior was to him.<br /><br />This book was runs the whole gamut of emotions, which is where the befitting title Beautiful Disaster comes in. Travis is so hot-headed and irrational when it comes to Abby, he doesn't know how to handle the new feelings he's overcome with. Abby, sheltering herself from more pain, can't admit to herself that this damaged guy is so perfect for her. His drinking, fighting, gambling...all things she wanted to escape from, because she doesn't want to repeat her mistakes with her father. But she struggles so long and so hard to be something she's not, and it nearly destroys both of them. I wanted to drag her out of the book and strangle her at several points in the story, and my heart just shattered for Travis more than once.<br /><br />I feel the need to mention that I read some negative reviews for this book at one point, which made me wonder if I wanted to try it out. I have to say I am wholeheartedly grateful to those that recommended it to me, because I couldn't disagree more with the hostility toward this story. Some people have issues with the tumultuous relationship andTravis' sleeping around, but for me these things didn't hold a candle to the good that came out of Abby and Travis being together. She gave his life light and meaning, and he gave her a love that she never expected but always needed. The epilogue was great, and I absolutely loved that they got the ending they deserved! If you haven't read this yet, pick it up today, because it's an amazing story that you're guaranteed to love!!
B00785P2QC|5.0|fun with no expansion pack. lots of fun and energy provided. rlgreat picture and fast pace. great hints when needed.
0062060562|3.0|I started out intrigued by this book. Christine's condition, having to wake up every morning remembering nothing of her life, grabbed my attention immediately. Watson does an excellent job of making the reader experience Christine's confusion and turmoil with her, with the inclusion of every abstract thought that crosses her mind. As she looks in the mirror and pores over every inch of her body trying to figure out how she became the woman she sees in front of her, you can't help but feel drawn in to her plight. The mystery behind Christine's memory loss kept me reading despite a slower pace, and the disturbing events and eerie discoveries she made along the way made for interesting twists.<br /><br />Christine and pseudo-Ben's relationship was just full of sadness from the very beginning. He was so loving and tender with her, despite having to go through the painful memories with her over and over. He seemed to care so deeply for her. I won't mention anything about where they end up in this story, but I admit I sympathized with his character a great deal throughout the first half of the book. My opinion of some of the characters changed greatly once secrets were revealed, but Watson really played out this relationship well.<br /><br />This book was well-written, but I grew tired of the unending cycle Christine goes through well before the end. I get that we had to see her go through a certain length of time dealing with the discoveries and having to start over every day, it became too monotonous after awhile. And the ending...ugh. After all Christine went through, and despite her mistakes, I hoped that her clarity would give her a sincere happy ending. This ending just fell flat, and left me disappointed.
0887307280|5.0|Enjoyable, easy read packed with need to know info. Sometimes comes off preachy but otherwise great book. This book should be a mandatory read for anyone thinking of starting a business.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed this book. You want to keep turning the pages to find out what happens next.  The author describes things in such detail that you can visualize the world this takes place in.
B007K87C4M|5.0|First of all, let's get the negative reviews out of the way: I'm sure most fans of Opeth and Porcupine Tree were listening to this record waiting for the \\"metal\\" part to come roaring in. It never does. If that's what your ears have to have, then you won't find it here.<br /><br />BUT, if you just sit and listen, you will hear some really beautiful sounds. It's almost the opposite of any Prog/Rock record: It's tense and beautiful. It's dark and lush without tons of instruments and strings. It's unique, too, though the only thing I can compare it to is fastforwarding early Crimson by about 30 years.<br /><br />I guess the greatest thing about it is this underlaying tension...it always feels like any one song could just flip over and start metallic screaming. And don't get me wrong, I love my share of metallic screaming. But \\"metal\\" is more implied here. This record is about something else.<br /><br />BTW...I posted my review here because I downloaded this beast in 24bits/96Khz, so much better than CD quality.<br /><br />Years from now this record will be hailed as a classic and masterpiece. Don't wait until then to realize you could have been listening to it all this time.
B006DHAT5K|1.0|I received the DVD in a reasonable amount of time but when I went to play the disc in my dvd player I got the message that it would not play. I could not make it work no matter what I tried.<br />How can I return this DVD and get my money back?
0446572993|2.0|About a third of the way in the story line begins to break down and it goes rapicly down hill from there.  Might make one of those midlses blood and guts actione movie.  Pretend actors running around not getting killed while every one else is.  If you have an IQ over 40 don't bother.
B005LAIGP0|5.0|There are two kinds of horror films.  The first depends for its scares on graphic gore, unrestrained violence, and blood -- lots of it.  The second relies more on mood and an escalating sense of terror than gruesome images to get under the skin.  \\"The Woman in Black\\" falls into the second category.  It's a film rich in atmosphere that takes its time getting underway but, once it kicks in, never lets go.<br /><br />In pre-World War I England, Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe), a young London lawyer with a small son, is grieving over his dead wife.  His employer is fed up with Arthur's dour attitude and sends him to Yorkshire to handle the sale of an estate.  Arthur is warned that this will be his last chance to distinguish himself for the firm.<br /><br />Arriving after a long journey, Arthur is met and befriended by a local squire, Daily (Ciaran Hinds), though the other townsfolk are not thrilled with the visit of an outsider.  Arthur is brought to the house of the deceased, which lies quite a distance from town.  It is the textbook example of the House of Gloom -- grey, run down, surrounded by overgrown shrubbery, broken gates marking its entrance -- a place that immediately foreshadows bad things to come.<br /><br />For much of the movie, Arthur is alone in the house -- or is he?  Many of the trappings of a traditional ghost story are here -- the rainstorm, shadowy corridors, a dog barking at something not seen, an endless number of rooms, each with creepy and unsettling contents.  And then there are the sightings: a darkly attired female figure, a face at a window, a fresh handprint on a window, a corpse rising from a muddy grave.  Whether these are real or only figments of Arthur's imagination is left to speculation -- at least for a while.<br /><br />\\"The Woman in Black\\" is from Hammer Studios, famous for a series of highly profitable Technicolor horror films made between 1957 and the early 70's.  Those features always had great production values and good actors,giving them far more style than their competitors.  \\"The Woman in Black\\" is true to that tradition.  Instead of a collection of young and pretty 20-somethings who will be disposed of in messy ways, it boasts a first-rate cast.<br /><br />Mr. Radcliffe's character is the focus of the movie and he is totally convincing as the lawyer hoping to make good while under a cloud of depression over the loss of his beloved wife.  He infuses his performance with a sad determination, as if he is running a track meet with his feet encased in cement blocks.  He forges on, knowing his livelihood depends on successfully delving through a myriad of papers, settling the estate, and seeing to the sale of the house.  Yet he misses his wife and the life they had together.  His Arthur Kipps is as far removed from Harry Potter as Hamlet is from the Nutty Professor.<br /><br />Mr. Hinds's Squire Daily is on hand mostly to provide balance to the inhospitable townsfolk, who would be equally at home carrying torches up a hill in a Frankenstein movie.  He prides himself on not being superstitious and refuses to believe the many deaths of children in town are anything more than unfortunate coincidence.  He also provides some exposition, filling us in on what happened in that gloomy house and why Arthur will undoubtedly fail to find a local buyer.  Hinds has a patrician look and never smiles. He suggests a careworn aristocrat who has seen much and prefers to trust his senses to belief in the otherworldly.<br /><br />Janet McTeer appears briefly, but unforgettably, as Mrs. Daily, a woman who is either an amusing eccentric or a looney, depending on how you interpret her actions.  Ms. McTeer adds bizarre contrast to a film in which the expression of choice appears to be glumness.  Dressed in frills and smiling pleasantly, she enjoys hosting Arthur for dinner.  It's not until we see some of her odd habits that we realize she may have a few cards missing from her deck.<br /><br />Director James Watkins has fashioned an entertaining horror film.  It's the kind of movie those who are turned off by bloody mayhem can embrace, since it's more about dread and terror than horror.  We experience the house and its history through the eyes of Arthur Kipps.  Watkins knows how to use sound and silence to enhance mood.  Long stretches of silence will precede a loud noise that will make us jump, but those stretches of silence are filled with suspense and anticipation.  We know that something -- anything -- might happen unexpectedly.<br /><br />Ample credit must be given to those responsible for the film's creepy milieu.  Art director Paul Ghirardani, production designer Kave Quinn, and set decorator Niamh Coulter have decorated every nook and cranny of the old manor house with Victorian furnishings, faded paintings, large carved cabinets, countless  candles, cobwebs, and eerie old wind-up toys.  One can almost smell the mustiness.<br /><br />Rated PG-13, \\"The Woman in Black\\" takes itself seriously and never resorts to self-deprecation.  The characters behave intelligently and have actual motivations.  It is in the league of Jack Clayton's \\"The Innocents\\" or Robert Wise's creaky-old-house melodrama, \\"The Haunting.\\"  Like those earlier films, it shows what happens when a person is confronted with the supernatural and reality seems to spin wildly out of control.
B0016OLC5Q|4.0|I streamed this movie because I love the soundtrack, and was curious.  I had no expectations, but I could not stop watching, intrigued by how this young man's outlook was impacted by his upbringing.  I was a bit frustrated and sad for his sister, but the compassion in her narration helped.  Also, I wish the movie would have ended differently, but when I saw that this was based on a true story, I can't be upset with the writers.  I would recommend this movie.
B007MNV5WU|2.0|The game itself is great.  And I don't mind paying for this game since I didn't have to pay for the other AB games. But what a letdown! I paid for two worlds?
B007X0TWOK|4.0|Very nice stuff. Reminds me of early Harry Nilsson. I'm glad to have a great voice to listen to again.
B002E2QHBS|5.0|The sound quality is excellent and so is the editing. Spoken stage announcements complement the music without going on at such length as to detract from it. Some of the \\"groovy\\" language is so dated it sounds ridiculous, but in the face of terrible things happening elsewhere it was three days of innocent merriment.
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|I could play this with my friends and by myself. I love it!!!!!!! I play this at home at my friends house and even on the go because you don't need wireless connection. I say don't listen to the other reviews saying its bad just get it because its really fun!
0345803485|1.0|If I wrote for the NY Times I think I'd title my review: Annoyingly Repetitive. This book almost reads like a dry script. The main characters are American but the author uses many British terms. The editor should have picked up on that and changed it. The writing is abysmal. It truly is so bad that I laughed throughout. If there's any truth to the dumbing down of America the book sales and positive reviews definitely illustrate that as a truth! Clearly one for my burn pile.
B0067R0APK|5.0|this app is great.  much better then weather channel.  this is dependable and accurate.  hardly any wait on the radar screen.  a must have.
B007SGM084|1.0|Don't get me wrong, I heard it's great, but I'm an extremely fast and addicted reader and I can afford to pay this much for something I know I will finish in less than 2 weeks... I guess I'll wait until something better come up and they have to bring the down the price.... It's a shame!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I actually decided to watch the movie before I read the book. The movie itself was wonderful, colorful, and full of detail but I had not realized how they had skimmed down and altered the original manuscript. Suzanne Collins does an excellent job of creating a world and immersing the readers in it. The characters are well developed and the plot outline is superb. It is a science fiction novel that does not read like one but more of just a regular work of fiction of some distant land in turmoil. Most importantly it is not a hard read, so adults who are fans of works like Lord of the Rings to teenagers who enjoy Goosebumps can read, comprehend, and enjoy alike.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|it needed to remember the last person to play, as well as there settings.<br /><br />I usually play the game when waiting for something, in a Dr. Waiting Room, mechanic shops, etc...<br />Starting the game and having the volume on about 80% is embarrassing. Please fix this issue.
B005LAIIRQ|1.0|I had seen a few Neeson \\"action\\" movies before and was pleased with them, thus my purchase of \\"The Grey\\". It starts out with the requisite brooding, detached soul having something disdainful and uncontainable on his mind ... that's the setup.  Like, he's reached critical mass over some serious injustice and now payback's gonna happen, right?  Wrong!  So there's supposed to be an airplane crash, but all you see is the \\"before\\" and the \\"aftermath\\".  Jostle the camera around and blow trash through the isles with a big fan...then go silent and switch to an un-smoldering, unconvincing debris field.  Sheesh already!  Now everybody's whimpering about being flung akimbo in the snow amongst a lotta corpses.  The usual compliment of contrasting stereotypes, all needing their mommies and praying profusely.  Well duh. Gee, what else could go wrong?  Let's see, sub-zero temps, darkness, howling winds, computer-generated snow. Low moans and groans from a virtual HERD of wolves (nope, just me lamenting the twenty bucks I spent on this turkey). Oh and let's not forget the dialogue.  Just go watch a re-run of Bonanza for ten minutes and you got it. So, how about let's jump super-humanly across a couple hundred feet of deep frozen gorge into some brittle trees and leave those puppies panting behind.  Annnnt!  Turns out that's where their DEN is dude!  Well, so by now Neeson is the only one left and he's confronted with the phoniest looking (un-grey, by the way) wolf you ever saw. And finally it's time for chaos and mayhem to break out.  Annnnt! Not so fast there Bunkie.  If you sat through the entirety of this drivel, you should know better by now. To sum it up: \\"oh, no Mr. Bill\\".  Now, fade to black?  No. Just sudden black.  And the sound of gritting teeth.  Mine.
B005LAIGPA|5.0|I do not like action films, but I absolutely loved this movie. It combines the best of adventure in a small enough dose that even the ladies will enjoy it. Everything is very believable, which makes some of the wilder scenes feel all-the-more real and absolutely exhilarating. If you're looking for a Pirates of the Carribean, then this is probably not for you. But if you're looking for a drama which will leave you breathless and on the edge of your seat, you have found it.  Bonus - Dane Dehaan is absolutely brilliant, and reminds me of a young Leo Dicaprio.<br /><br />Be prepared for a slower build-up than you'd expect. It's worth it.
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|I love good survival movies. Alive, great movie. Castaway-darn good. I wanted to like this one. I think liam Neeson is such a great actor, but he is saddled by  the worst scrip Ive almost ever seen put onto film. Wolves/ villians that makes a man confront his own demons thing  felt more like  werewolves from twilight gone bad - and about as silly as that sounds- rather then the deeper meaning they wished they were. ugh so dumb.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|[[ASIN:0545265355 The Hunger Games Trilogy Boxed Set]]<br /><br />I really enjoyed reading these book, especially on my Kendall.  Being able to enlarge the letters helped make them  so much easier to read.  The books were easy to read and held my attention.  I did not want to put them down.  In fact, I was going through them so fast, I thought maybe they had been shortened.  They had not.  I finished the three of them in less than 2 weeks, which is fast for me.  Now that I have read the books, I want to see the movies!  Also, I received them in a more than timely manner.  Was surprised and happy they came so soon.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|Adam`s new album is absolutely fabulous.  No words can describe how pleased I am.  I have been playing it non-stop for two days now!!
0618918248|5.0|The best book I have I ever read! Dawkins did a fantastic job pulling the carpet from under the pillars of the three monotheistic religions.  He surely destroyed the god hypothesis in this book.  I certainly did not need this book to convince me that god is a delusion.  The fact is god did not exist; god does not exist; god will never ever exist.  This book filled many of the gaps that my brain had.  People need to wake up and use more of their intellect and less of their emotions.  I have enjoyed every page, every paragraph, every sentence and every ward of this book.
B001F6TXME|5.0|This remote has helped me so much with Lightning photos.<br />I also have the wireless infrared remote. This requires the setting to be set for infrared and if you turn the camera off then you have set it up again.<br /><br />with the MC-DC2 wired remote. It acts as the shutter button in all modes so its ready when you are.<br /><br />A simple must have for Macro, Portrait and Long exposure shots.<br /><br />I really like it!! full 5 star rating.

0345803485|1.0|A trilogy??? Are you kidding me?  I could not even finish the 1st book....don't waste your time and money. I could not believe how many times Anastasia bites her lower lip and Christian tells her to stop biting her lower lip, how many times she rolls her eyes....etc. etc.  Enough already!!  My inner goddess is telling me I shouldn't have wasted my money.  'Nuff said.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|No doubt asbout it this is spellbinding and cannot wait until Season 3.  Leave it to the British to do a great job with movies.

B006MVJ2L4|5.0|Oh, definitely a 5 star winner in every respect!!!! This album combines spectacular vocals with excellent songs and production. Kudos to Adam Lambert- his voice just soars on every track. Love the high intensity funky dance pop in the first half and the soul-searching emotions in the second half. Not a song on it, including the bonus tracks, that I would skip over. That's amazing as it seems most albums have a few good songs and the rest is filler. I know Adam facilitated the streaming of his album, but buying the cd provides me with the best sound for home or on the road-and on this album you'll want to crank up the sound!!!!!!!
B005LAIIS0|2.0|OK let me warn you this review may be a spoiler.<br /><br />I would normally have given this movie at least a three *** maybe a four  **** rating except for the ending and a thin plot.  If you like a movie with a moral to it this is not it.  I failed to detect a moral.  The acting is very good and I am a big fan of Liam Neeson, Dallas Roberts and also Dermot Mulroney who was almost unrecognizable in the movie.  So I really wanted to like this move.  I should have read the reviews.  The plot was a little thin and the ending sucked.  I hate that kind of ending.  It could have been so much more.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT.  I really hate the \\"live sucks and then you die\\" movies.  They had me right up until the ending.  I know \\"you can imagine any ending you want argument\\".  In my opinion those are just an trick when the writer is stuck or lazy.  As with all of these this is my opinion and I am no movie critic.  I just know what I like.  FYI I am over 40 and I have seen a ton of movies.  I am a movie nut so I am a bit jaded I want a plot and good acting.  I like action but not without a plot and acting to go with it.  This had good acting considering what they had to work with.
0439023548|3.0|It was ok... It was really boring though and i didnt know what was going on... loved the first two books A LOT, but this one was just... different. Good at some parts, but not the best
B003NVFYOA|1.0|Let's see...hmmmm...You have a female impersonator suffering from Don Juanism with whom all the girls want to sleep, who also has severe self-destructive tendencies (Latent homosexuality has that effect)who is also trusted to play with world destroying toys unsupervised. You have two women and one man who can't get their tits out of the way long enough to get anything done and a group of writers who give the impression that they can't go more the twenty minutes without some sort of sexual release. Add it all together you have 'Torchwood'. I watch it somewhat with the same eye that I use when passing a traffic accident. You don't want to look, but you still crane your neck a bit and keep watching. It is very sad. Doctor Who is such a class act, with a sense of wonder, while this is a bad dream from writers who are using a public forum to explore their own childhood memories of sexual abuse.
0439023521|5.0|This book is amazing!!! It is definitely my favorite book out of the three. Lots of action and romance! my favorite book of all time! I would recommend this book to everyone.

It makes me so sad that he passed so senselessly, when we are in such a technological world he was just a few miles from help and medical knowledge that could have saved him. I have a feeling he is very happy on the other side however, still carving a path somewhere beyond. Sountrack is awesome.

B00746O3X8|3.0|As others have noted, tinknave's review is excessively negative, and several people are happy with this product.  As I already own the original Cotton Carrier I thought a side-by-side comparison would help end any speculation  (no one else seems to have done this), so I bought the Opteka just for that.<br /><br />The Opteka is a close clone of the Cotton Carrier (even down to the shape of some panels) but there are  differences.<br /><br />Firstly, the camera mount system. The Cotton Carrier bolt (on the camera) has a circular profile with opposite  EDGES trimmed straight. The locking mechanism relies on the trimmed edges sliding between the two edges of the  mount (on the harness), whereas when turned 90 degrees the untrimmed curved edges are too big to fit past. The  Opteka bolt has a fully circular profile with a channel cut in the bottom, and slides OVER a stud rising from the carrier. The bolt is turned 90 degrees with the stud trapped inside the channel at the centre of the bolt.<br /><br />The metal channel and plastic stud are only 1-2mm deep and the channel has sharp edges. Under REPEATED use where  the user is not careful to properly align the channel for insertion/extraction to the carrier, I can see wear  eroding the stud which MAY lead to failure of the locking mechanism. The Cotton Carrier is substantially more  resistent to the effects of wear by design. I suspect Opteka have changed the design to avoid infriging Cotton's  patent.<br /><br />Also, the bolt screw on the Opteka has a very large flat-blade-screwdriver type of mount (with key provided) and a  rather thin rubber washer. The Cotton uses a hex key (less likely to wear) and the rubber washer is designed to compress (less likely to come loose).<br /><br />Secondly, the straps going over the shoulders into the velcro mount on the back panel of the Opteka have 6 inches of velcro whereas the Cotton has 9 inches. The straps' overall length is identical. This means the Opteka straps cannot be tightened as much as the Cotton for people of smaller build. I myself (5' 11\\", 150lbs) have the Cotton's straps tightened using those last 3 inches. Because of this, the Opteka's back panel which should sit between my  shoulder blades actually touches the nape of my neck, and the shoulder straps rub the side of my neck. Larger people would probably not have any problem, but this is not ergonomic for me.<br /><br />Thirdly, the hip mount for the 2nd camera is 50% larger on the Opteka and in my opinion unnecessarily so as this  has no benefit for camera carrying. When sitting down it digs into my hip rather more than the Cotton.<br /><br />Fabric on both carriers appears identical, and construction of the Opteka is of the same quality as the Cotton  (tinknave is simply wrong about that). There is very slightly more padding under the chest panel on the Cotton.<br /><br />In my opinion I believe that with a bit more attention to detail, the Opteka would be a very good product and  would eat Cotton's market share, particularly since Cotton's price seems opportunistically high. However, the  design of the locking mechanism is questionable and the inability to comfortably fit smaller builds is  disappointing.
B008458O3S|5.0|I switched from iPhone to Android solely to get away from this game.  Seriously, I was wasting every spare (and several not-so-spare) minutes solving the higher levels.  I would see this game when I closed my eyes and have dreams about yellow and brown trains.  I've been so productive for the last year; I even got a raise at work thanks to my new-found productivity.  Oh, well.  Time to get back to trying to beat level 79.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|An entertaining yet poignant story about World War II. But it was more than just a story about World War II and the Nazi occupation of the Channel Islands. It was about relationships. It was about person growth through  those nurturing relationships. It was funny, yet heartwarming. It was about people taking care of each other, even though they weren't family. The characters shared another bond. They were all members of \\"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society. You'll have to read the book to discover the meaning behind the Society's name.

B007MJ9LA2|5.0|Shape Shifter is a very melodious recording.All \\"First-Takes\\" too apparently.In reading other reviews on here regarding Santana I'm always stunned that people either compare what's new to the first 3 albums (from 40 years ago!),or say his playing is repetitive,or think this music is too mellow or jazzy.Carlos is almost 65 and may be the most versatile guitarist on the planet-playing with everyone and anyone and any style of music.None of the musicians from his era play as rowdy as he does on \\"Nomad\\" or as soulful as on \\"In The Light Of A New Day\\".His music is full of Love,Reverence for God,and care for Humanity.All you need to enjoy and appreciate this music is an Open Heart-sadly we are living in a time when most music has almost no heart and soul anymore.Every song on this album is great music by great musicians,and even though they were recorded at different times over the years they flow nicely together.It's actually really a Carlos Santana solo album.Anyone who buys a copy of this recording,can just let it in their heart,say a prayer,and let some of the ice and pain start melting away...
B001U0HBPG|5.0|\\"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\\" is a drama fantasy film enriched with an enchanting story of love and adventure.<br /><br />It is a unique account of reverse aging where Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt) is born with elderly characteristics and comes to know Daisy Fuller (Cate Blanchett) at the nursing home he lives at with his adoptive parents who are on the staff there, and where Daisy visits her grandmother who is a resident.<br /><br />Pitt and Blanchett have inherent screen chemistry which sees them teamed up again having previously starred together in the 2006 film \\"Babel\\".<br /><br />The narrative is multilayered with both Daisy and Benjamin having their own tangents yet they come together and shift apart at several junctions in the movie.<br /><br />It is a unique film that is very satisfying with a masterfully constructed story.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author
B000GG4Y32|5.0|Reds is one of the best movies I have ever seen!  The acting was superb on all fronts, The storytelling was magnificent, The locations were breathtaking.  It was a very brave film dealing with a subject which is still controversial to say the least.<br /><br />The Witnesses -- many of them famous people who knew John Reed and Louise Bryant -- is one of the most enthralling and moving elements in any film.  The Special Features about the making of the film are extensive and are also first rate.<br /><br />I also just saw Chariots of Fire which won the Academy Award for Best Picture that year -- there is no comparison and Reds is by far the finer film.
0307951529|5.0|This is a great book, most specifically for solopreneurs (one-person businesses). It provides inspiration and an outline from many others who have already done and are currently living the life and work that you seek. As a small business owner with 13 employees, I came away with great ideas to change and improve things in my business. BUY IT! YOU WON'T REGRET IT!
B007V2UGPE|4.0|I am surprisingly addicted to this game. I feel like there are way too many defense games on mobile platforms but this is one of the worthwhile ones. Good use of rpg elements. The game is not quite up to the standard set by say Plants vs. Zombies but I definitely think I'll keep playing. Plus it looks just great on the kindle fire.
B0000AMRJD|3.0|Tony is such a souless monster but refused to car bomb the wife n kids, and hence no Scarface Part Deux...  Abs love Cuban food and miss Miami's ubiquitous Fritas window serve, the kitchen scene with Mom scolding Tony creates such compassion for his chosen lifestyle, who could possibly deal with that kind of nagging, incentive for ruling the underworld, natch! Maybe an unlikely hero but Horatio Alger would be most proud and that macho confidence with that Baltimore babe is just infectious... I treasured the romance between Manny and lil sis with the huge 'fro...  sweet n slimy, match made in heaven... the language is palatable if u watch on regular cable but no worries bout the insane violence, no problemo with censors there, but it gets laughable at some point and the deranged savage ending remains a memorable swan dive into the abyss of karma... I wonder who taught Al how to injest 4ft high lines, cuban dialect, and that clown face to name a few comedic threads... I enjoyed the soundtrack, pulsing, slower than the typical 120bpm Disco beat, helps one slow down and smell the blood stains... recommend for all the pop culture references and when someone scolds you about getting high on ur supply, take heed on that fructose consumption!!
044655667X|2.0|I've been noticing a decline in quality of your books, but you are still way better than so many others.  It is just that we all know you can do better and don't want you to go the way of Patterson, Woods, DeMille, etc.  They were once great and now just have a production line of sub-standard offerings.  Ok, I did read this book but did not find it compelling; found it quite easy to put down and pick up later.  The most nagging question I have is where does the new young lawyer's call name \\"Bullocks\\" come from; I wasted time looking back to the beginning and could find no explanation.  All I know is at the end she was called Jennifer because she had passed their sniff test for a new associate.  When all was said and done with this book, that's the only thing that fascinated me.  Oh, and aren't we already tired of Maggie McFierce and their relationship?  zzzzzz
0439023491|5.0|I received this book in mint condition very quickly after ordering it.  Be warned, however, that it's addictive.  I had to force myself to put it down!
B007ZTLLMK|5.0|UPDATED; 7/13/12,<br />The developer fixed the game to work with the accelerometers so now it works perfectly on the Kindle Fire! This was done about two weeks before this update and the new version is now on Amazon. So all the old reviews that complain about the game not working correctly no longer apply. Go ahead and try it now and have fun!<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW;<br />I contacted the developer and was told at first to just use the game with the joystick function because the Kindle won't work with the game in 'gyro' mode. I wrote back a second time and said that wasn't good enough for a paid game. the final response is 'they are working on the game to try to get it to work with the accelerometers in the Kindle so it will work like it is supposed to. Keep your fingers crossed, and lets hope this Developer comes through. I like flying games and this one does have some potential, if it worked right.....
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it' a very cool game where you play games to earn more points to buy more games. even the biggist celebritys will love,&lt;3,LOVE this game.
1469984202|4.0|As a long time sci fi reader, I must say that I was totally intrigued and captured by this story.<br />I really found it hard to put down because I wanted to find out what was being uncovered by the characters each chapter.<br />Not many books leave you wanting for the \\"next\\" in the series, but Wool did without question!<br /><br />I could actually see this kind of event happening in a not too distant future.<br />I don't want to spoil the story for any of you, so I wont go into details.<br /><br /> If you enjoy post apocalyptic dystopian stories you won't be dissipointed with this series!

B0073PPKCI|5.0|I just received this cd/DVD today. It was wonderful. a must have for any ABBA collector. I can't quit playing the CD, I was soooo Glad they added I am the City and You owe me one. Now this CD is complete. Yeas it would have been nice to have Just Like That on here but oh well. Now They need to rerelease Waterloo in Deluxe form.  also I hope they do it for Ring Ring and Abba. Then my collection will be complete. Hey I just thought, How about a deluxe version of Abba Live??? you never know. Now go and buy this. You won't regret it.
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|Arthur Kipps was dealing with loss, after his wife passed away from childbirth and his employer who wasn't very pleased with his recent responsibilities on the job, sends him out on field work to travel to a remote village to organize a deceased client's paperwork. The young lawyer arrives, but wasn't welcomed with open arms. It was quite obvious that the people in town didn't want him there, but worse yet, there was much more to worry about than just feeling unwanted in the forbidden village. I highly recommend this classic goth story to all thriller and mystery lovers, who enjoy intense suspense throughout with fear and dread instilled from beginning to end. This dark mystery with its silent screams, ghosts and faces in windows will have you biting your nails right up until a shocking ending! The flickering candlelight mood with slamming doors and fog outside will give you that same eerie feeling as if you were viewing 'CAPE FEAR.' The atmosphere is perfect as Daniel Radcliffe gives a superb performance in his role of fright, while something real scary continues to hover over the town. How many children died mysteriously, how many couples were grieving and who was the woman in black, was revenge among the chilling air?
0307352145|5.0|I recommend this book to everyone who's introverted or not. Just cause I'm quiet doesn't mean I'm boring, weird, stupid, lack intelligence, I'm slow to catch on or all the other labels that have been given to me over the years because I'm \\"Quiet\\". I like being quiet, I like knowing who I am, where I'm going and where I've been.<br />Unfortunately there are still a lot of people in the world who don't even know what the meaning of Introvert / Extrovert is. I tell people what I am and they look at me like \\"Huh\\"? Sadly this is just how the world is. I have a lot of extroverted friends and I wouldn't trade them in for anything, and they know and respect my limits as I do theirs. It's people who don't understand nor want to that I have a hard time being around. They don't get it, or they don't want to get it. But like the book says, the world caters to extroverts and every where you turn it's more and more obvious. Everything has two sides, I'm just on the introverted side.<br />Get this book.
0307592731|5.0|Laugh, cry, identify, alienate, root for, fear admire.. Cheryl Strayed confirms, in wonderful style, how complexly amazing this challenge to life. Do Not Burn this book when you've finished; give it to a friend to read.
0307595579|5.0|I just finished reading the third novel of the Larsson trilogy. I am outraged that the gods saw fit to remove him from this plane of existence at such an<br />early age. I am angry that he cannot receive my kudos on his web page. I am<br />distraught that there likely be no more works of this high quality from future<br />authors for years to come.<br /><br />If you enjoy extremely well crafted novels that test your intelligence,(this from me as a Mensan), do not miss \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\", \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\" & \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\"

0553573403|1.0|Game of Throne starts out strong with interesting characters, however the author failed to develop those characters in his books.<br />If you are interested in reading dull history of an artificial world, than this book if for you. There is no story here, his<br />story leads no where. If you have the patient to suffer through the five books series, I guarantee that you will be disappointed.<br />There are much better way to use your time, like watching grass grow.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was one of the BEST books I've ever read.  Very interesting, intriguing and easy to read..  Definitely a \\"I cannot put the book down\\" read!!  I highly recommend it to ALL... Download/buy book two immediately because you will be wanting more ASAP..

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a wonderful calculator. It is simple to use-efficient and effective. Perfect for my everyday needs. I really like that it memorizes my calculations.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I really am a big fan of the hunger games. I think that the storyline is captivating, haunting, and really makes the reader take a look at the world. However, it was difficult for me to get into the writing style. The book is presumably targeted to youth, however, it is extremely lacking in descriptive language which made it somewhat difficult for me to imagine the story. This is one book I actually benefited from seeing the movie first! That being said, I really love the books. The characters make you love and hate them all at once and the romance is the most tasteful I've seen in years. Finally, I like that the concept was so versatile. It suits your intellectual politician, your philosopher, your social service agent, and the every-day average person. It left me wanting more!
0345803507|3.0|Too bad this trilogy didn't come out when I was 30 years younger!  I wonder if a man like Gray truly exists?
0345803485|1.0|I really wanted to like this book as I heard so much about it. ... where to begin ?? So much I disliked. The characters are \\"american\\" but they sound british...\\"please fetch Miss Steele a glass of water\\" ... americans dont use the word \\"fetch\\" unless you are referring to playing \\"fetch\\" with the dog. Thats just one of many that made this unbelievable. The repetition was endless. 500 pages of inner goddess, oh my, oh jeez, oh crap, Ana biting her lip, Christian scowling, Ana rolling her eyes....over and over and over. I rolled my eyes every page. The book had no point. If it werent for these words the book would not exist. Worst book ever.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|a decently interesting game.. in my opinion it is worth the time it takes to level and the prizes are pretty good
B005K17RU0|5.0|Works great on kindle fire. Tried other free popular weather app; this one works much better. Nice to look at, nice features/options.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|In other reviews it is described as poorly written.. Well it may be, but if you want a book that keeps you wanting more, then this is it! It`s hot and heavy. I couldn`t put the book down. I would highly recommend this to other women!!

B003WTE886|1.0|Boring vocals, period. But if you have limited music tastes, then Taylor Swift fits the bill. I can only imagine that's she's getting airplay from small market stations where country and AC are the only forms of radio music available. How sad.

1609613937|5.0|I learned about Dr.McDougal's \\"starch solution\\" from his very comprehensive website.<br />This book summarizes and elaborates on the principles he teaches there. By following his program<br />my weight has gone down by 55 pounds, and my total cholesterol has decreased from 204 to a<br />\\"heart attack proof\\"  level of 131. I eat as much as I want, am never hungry, and would never return<br />to my way of eating pre-Mcdougal.
0061474355|4.0|I bought this book my senior year of High School on a whim. I thought the cover looked cool, what I did not know is that would fall in love with it. The leading character are human and have their own needs, dreams and ideals, but they put that aside for the greater good for the most part. There is no whining from Sabriel because her boyfriend left her, Touchstone wipes the dust off and does what he needs to do. This is a book that any mother of a teenager would be grateful for their teenage daughter to read.<br />As soon as I read this book I let my college brother read it. It was passed around he college and I did not get it back for about a year. Then the next year when I got to college it was once again passed around with my friends until it was lost. I have had a copy of this book since 1997 and have read it many times each time loving it more.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|The games r fun but way too much adverting!  I hope I don't loose my games during an upgrade so we will see.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|It is common knowledge amongst my closest friends, and family that I have one true fear... not spiders, mice or snakes. Not even death really... but zombies. Or the idea of zombies. They say it is irrational, even a little crazy to have such a fear. But heck, biological warfare could potentially make this a possibility.. anyone watch Resident Evil? You just never know, people. You just never know.<br /><br />In this novel I read of my fear. Human survivor numbers, in comparison to the total population prior to the decade long war, could be viewed as near extinction! Max Brooks is an agent for the United Nations, traveling the globe, interviewing such survivors of various nationalities and religions about their experiences during this war.<br /><br />The novel opens up with an outbreak in a small Chinese town, where a doctor is taken to 'Patient 0' in the hopes of identifying the 'disease'. It just so happens that it's a very young boy, shackled by the villagers in a shed or hut. This boy is so hungry and savage, it tears its own arm off in order to get closer to the doctor that stares at it in horror. Very zombielicious!!!<br /><br />This book is presented as a documentary, with Brooks interviewing various people, including military officials. The documentary style threw me off initially, as I had never read a novel set up this way, but quickly got into the flow of the structure.<br /><br />It is jam packed with morbid scenes of swarms of the walking dead taking down entire populations. Then those bodies reanimate, and the numbers grow to astronomical proportions that were too massive to conceive. You are taken along various people's journeys of their incredible struggles to survive, and of deeds they never dreamed they would ever be able to perform in order to do so. Why the plague... you know what, not sure. There was never really an explanation from what I can recall, but to be honest, you are so caught up with the storyline, who cares? The fact is, the dead were walking around. (shudder)<br /><br />Why only 4 stars though? It is not a testament to the story or the skill of writing, because it was superb. Just a reader's personal preference. Much of this book was very militant, with lots of well researched military weaponry and methods of attack, and which though understandable, elicits some yawning out of this reader. I was way more interested to read some good zombie killing. And ohh yes, folks. Lots and lots that fall beautifully in that category.<br /><br />I have learned a lot from reading this novel. I learned that I need to read the Zombie Survival Guide ASAP! And I must get my hands on a paperback copy so I can throw that in a backpack along with a couple of guns, ammo, a couple of knifes, a few cans of beans and Chunky Soup, can opener, bandages.. you get the drift. Let's not forget the very sharp sword on my back, cause I may have to lop some zombie heads through the air. (ERIN, can you NOT just give me one of yours for Christmas? Pretty please?) AND, I need to track down that Bear Grylls episode of urban disaster survival and commit it to memory.<br /><br />But if all goes to hell, I will just have to pull the ultimate weapon out of my arsenal.<br /><br />Chuck Norris...<br /><br />That's right. I've got Chuck Norris. You are screwed Zombies... You are screwed.<br /><br />To make matters sweeter, soon to be a movie at your local theater, starring none other than Brad Pitt as Max Brooks. Alright!walking around. (shudder)<br /><br />Why only 4 stars though? It is not a testament to the story or the skill of writing, because it was superb. Just a reader's personal preference.

B0052VUNHC|1.0|Do not let your teenage daughters read this book!  This book is obviously geared towards an adolescent audience and completely lacks responsibility. I kept hoping that the female \\"heronine\\" would get wise and get herself out of what is obviously a toxic relationship, yet, that was not the case. I agree with other reviews that found this literary work disturbing.  Violence, obsession and co-dependency should not be celebrated. I do NOT recommend this book.

1937986039|5.0|The X10 is a feature-rich little camera and the included manual is so  typically terse, that the detailed explanations in this book are a godsend. The book is twice as big as the camera!<br />Before getting this book, I was close to giving up and returning the camera. Now I am gradually learning to master the X10, and to love it.<br /><br />Addendum (December 6): The more I use the X10 the better I like it, and I have benefitted greatly from frequently referring to this book.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I found this book by chance and was convinced by the ratings and the reviews to download the sample. So glad I did :)<br />Clever story, evolving characters, impossible to put down once you started, and when finished, after more that 500 pages, left aching for more !!!<br />Five star easily, and with that price (!!!!) it should deserve even more :)<br /><br />Go for it, my only advice, better starting reading it a weekend else you'll feel sleepy at work :)<br /><br />Kudos to the author,he made it to my small \\"read everything he writes\\" small pantheon list.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|i think its good for a time killer and nice variety of games but like others I agree that the update sucked

B004MC8CA2|4.0|Overall, I really enjoy this app; especially the multiple translations and the audio feature that reads the Bible to me.  I also enjoy the dozens of reading plans to choose from.  There are a few cons to report: it does wear my Kindle Fire's battery down more quickly than it did prior to downloading this app.  You must be near a wifi hotspot to use it in public; it won't work without the Internet. Lastly, the dictionary feature to look up the meaning of a single word won't work in this app; if you hold down word, the app highlights the entire verse. Overall, I am happy but I do recommend that you have Bibles downloaded to your device.
B003QNXPUK|1.0|I purchase this product because I've had great performance from other invisible shield products. First off, I purchased the maximum protection version to cover my entire phone. The edges (sides) were not precut to fit the phone. I had to cut my own sizes so that I could protect every spot. Second, I had issues with the edges peeling up. After a couple of months the back started coming off and continued until a quarter of the back was just a flap.  I request a replacement and received it. That one did the same.  I think the fact that the phone has no curved side makes it susceptible to peeling. I would not recommend this product and I'm not longer using it on my phone.
0439813786|3.0|This everlasting so evocative book about a boy named Hugo. Hugo is a young ordinary boy that lives with his father in in a secret room in the clocks at the train station. One night Hugo's dad was working late at the museum. He was working in the attic when the security guard forgot that he was up there and locked all the doors and the whole museum burned down. Hugo every night was waiting for his dad. One day Hugo's uncle came to the secret room and told Hugo that his dad died in the fire. Hugo was now living by himself.  Hugo had found a metal robot in the corner of the room.  He was trying to press the \\"On\\" button, but it wasn't working.  Hugo found a spot where you were supposed to put a heart shape key.  One day Hugo was at the train station stealing cool milk and part to fit it into the Robot.  Hugo was caught by the manager. He made Hugo work and rebuild the things he broke and stole. Hugo was working, when he saw the manager's granddaughter.  One night, Hugo followed the manager home.  The next night, Hugo followed the manager's granddaughter home, but when she turned around, she caught him. She does not know that he knew about the heart shaped necklace. Hugo went up without her knowing and stole the heart shaped necklace. Read the book to find out if the key fits the robot.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its a awesome game to play. it keeps my brothers entertained when we go on trip or drive around. its a game that I can keep playingfor a long time.
0525423656|3.0|This book was a very adventures book with romance in the middle. At first the book was a little slow. Cassia went to find Ky.Ky is stuck in the outer presance. Whil Ky is gone Cassia is with Xyander.The book was very as strong or classic. It was a fantasy twist. At first Cassia is stuck in a camp. Then thats when Xyander shows up.That part was little weird, but romantic. I would give this book between 1 through 10 it would be a 7.
0345803485|5.0|I  purchased all three of the books together.  I am so glad that I did!  Fifty Shades of Grey is only the FIRST part of the story. I cannot believe that people would/could write a review regarding the characters  or even the story itself, with only reading one book!<br /><br />My advice is to have all three books, and then begin to read!  This book is NOT one that you would want your teenage daughter to read -- and thank goodness for that---!!<br /><br />The story appealed to me due to it's originality, and by that --I mean throwing in a \\"taboo\\" subject and  writing a  modern love story around it!<br /><br />Compare it to TWILIGHT--oh good heavens no!  How in the world that connection could be made I have no idea!<br /><br />So yes, I loved Fifty Shades of Grey since it is ....the first part ...of the story!!<br /><br /> And the story only gets more intense during the trilogy------I laughed....I cried....I actually shouted out loud... I felt anger......compassion---and a story that can do that---definately is a great read to me!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great way to stay in The Word! This app links to all devices so wherever you are you can pick up where you left off.
0525478817|5.0|YA books are often so self-serious, particularly ones about dark subject matter. But this book was hilarious and so wholly original, written in a voice I'd never before encountered in YA literature. Like, it was really HILARIOUS. Even after tragic scenes I found myself laughing out loud in a moment's time. But it didn't distract from the story -- it enhanced it. The humor helped to make the disturbing subject matter that much more poignant.<br /><br />The characters were flawless -- realistic, relatable, inspiring, so very \\"teenaged\\" and yet wise beyond their years. I'm amazed by Green's intriguing and thought-provoking themes, macro and micro -- masterfully woven both across the entire book and within little scenelits.<br /><br />There was no wasted space, no wasted sentence, just writing jam-packed with brilliance. Read this book. Today.<br /><br />As for my rating? The fault, dear Brutus, is in the Amazon stars; if I could, I would award fifty instead of five.

B0019KC4TU|3.0|I have read some other reviews where the Genesis remixes sound compressed (US non-lossless versions DTS, DD and CD it burns me that we (US) keep getting passed over for the lossless recordings). I am sorry to write that the European SACD version sounds compressed as well. I cant recommend this SACD but I do recommend the Japan version of Foxtrot which has far better sound on both the SACD and DTS version.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|Absolutely a 'don't put down til you finish it' book. My sister-in-law had to read this for a class she was taking, & passed it on to me to read to get another opinion on it. I loved it. I will never agree with her solution to the situation, but it definitely makes you think about some of the things you may say or do - & the unintended effect it can have on someone else. Would totally recommend it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I finished this book in 4 - 6 days. You just can't stop reading it but at the same time you don't wanna finish reading it so you're forced to put it down every now and then. I highly recommend it.

0345803485|5.0|The book/series that got me into reading! A little to much sex, but a great read
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is a very poorly written book.  The level of reading ability is on par with the Twilight series.<br />Girl meets prince<br />Prince falls in love<br />girl and prince live happily ever after.<br />If it wasn't for the sex scenes, this drivel would never be on the Bestseller lists.  I am sorry I bought into the hype.

B002ZG974M|3.0|The stars of \\"Babies\\" are, of course, babies: Ponijao from Namibia, Bayarjargal from Mongolia, Mari from Japan and Hattie from America. Thomas Balmès's documentary film is a look at one year in their life, without any narration or background information about each family. You don't even know their surnames.<br /><br />The film's strength lies in the beautifully shot images of these babies, all cute and adorable - a fact that is too obvious. The simple approach works most effectively when something unexpected happens to the babies, like a goat drinking water of the bathtub in which Bayarjargal is bathing.<br /><br />But how about his parents? How do they feel about it? Is this a normal thing in Mongolia or not? Does each family's life style represent that of each nation? If so, why those four countries are chosen? Obviously the French documentary tries to be a socio-cultural comment by contrasting how each of the four babies is raised in his/her family. But what the film does not say is, for instance, not every Japanese family can afford what Roger Ebert calls \\"an awesome array of baby training strategies.\\"<br /><br />But of course, you can just forget these things and enjoy watching the film. As I said before, the babies are cute, although these days you can see lots of images of cute babies online, somewhere like YouTube.
B00168OINK|5.0|This movie was verry funny and I highly recommend it to people who love movies like Chicken Little or Toy Story! Good for all ages with many levels of comedy.
