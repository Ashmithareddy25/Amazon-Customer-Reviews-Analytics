B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I liked the way the author interwove the characters and came to a wonderful conclusion.  It held my attention throughout the whole book, and actually had a hard time putting it down.  I saw what I thought would be the outcome, and it actually was  -  but with a little twist - making it more fun!
B0028IDXDS|5.0|I wanted this pacifier mainly because it was so darn cute, but wow, it is GREAT at staying in my 1 month old's mouth!  His other pacifiers pop out once he gets sleepy and that wakes him up, but the plush animal on this one allows the pacifier to stay in position.  We've started saying \\"the monkey understands\\" because it is often the only thing that will settle him down in his car seat or in bed before he falls asleep.  Plus, it looks really cute.  Definitely get this.

014242921X|2.0|I made it through my high school honors English classes without ever reading Steinbeck -- his books just never appealed to me and so I chose others from the \\"must read\\" list.  So it is only now, 30 years later, that I have finally read two of his books; The Grapes of Wrath and now East of Eden.  My conclusion?  I was a pretty smart teenager after all to not waste my time on Steinbeck.<br /><br />What has surprised me most is how weak Steinbeck's writing is overall.  The Grapes of Wrath was a better, somewhat stronger book but even it occasionally lapsed into the sort of poor dialogue that has led me to write scathing reviews of current books by current authors.  I certainly expected better from the Great Steinbeck.<br /><br />East of Eden is a far weaker book, with almost no redeeming qualities.  It is, as everyone knows, an allegory of the Cain and Abel story in the Book of Genesis.  It is a somewhat loose adaptation, but there is no chance the reader will miss the connection since Steinbeck throws in several reminders with such a heavy hand that he practically beats the reader over the head with them.<br /><br />Re-setting the story of Cain and Abel in turn-of-the-20th century America is actually a fairly compelling story idea, only Steinbeck ruins it with his poor characterizations and dialogue.  Adam is as dumb and dull as a bucket of rocks, Cathy is a one-sided caricature of evil, and Aron is almost as dumb and dull as his father.  Abra was supposed to be a remarkable woman, but I didn't find her very appealing at all.  The only characters who evinced any sympathy from me were Charles, Caleb and to a lesser degree Lee.<br /><br />I will admit there are passages where Steinbeck's writing sings like poetry, but these are limited to descriptions of physical landscape or groups of people as a whole.  Such passages are only occasional, with most of the book given over to narrative and dialogue at which Steinbeck demonstrates no skill whatsoever.  The conversations between characters are contrived and corny and completing lacking in subtlety, sophistication or realism, sounding like something written by or for juvenile readers.  If Steinbeck ever took any creative writing classes at all, he must have slept through them.<br /><br />As if all this were not bad enough, in East of Eden Steinbeck also weaves in the story of the Hamilton family.  Their story only barely intersects with that of the Trasks and is completely unnecessary; all of the passages about the Hamiltons could be taken out and the book would lose nothing except excess pages (or in this case, excess CDs).  However, the Hamiltons were Steinbeck's mother's family, which is doubtless why he wanted to include them in his book (and probably also why Steinbeck considered this book his \\"magnum opus\\").  No doubt he found their story fascinating, but it is really just bland and even silly at times (particularly the scenes with Dessie and Tom when she returns to the farm) and does nothing but dilute whatever power the Trask story might have otherwise had.<br /><br />The narrator, also, was not the best choice for this book.  Richard Poe has a dramatic voice and obviously has skill and experience at dramatic narration.  However, he has a tendency to make characters sound too Hollywood-ish (particularly Cyrus Trask and Sam Hamilton).  And his efforts at drama did, I think, only serve to make the too-often sappy dialogue sound even more sappy.<br /><br />Steinbeck may be highly regarded as one of the great writers of the 20th century, and may have won literary prizes, but nevertheless, I consider him to be one of the most over-rated authors I have ever read.  Two of his books is enough, I'm through with John Steinbeck.  If you simply must read this book, get it from the library; don't waste your hard-earned money on it.etween characters are contrived and corny and completing lacking in subtlety, sophistication or realism, sounding like something written by or for juvenile readers.

B001ANSSDC|4.0|My husband wanted to see the movie, so I tried to read the book before that.  I was almost finished when we went to see the movie.  I am most interested in knowing the author's feeling about the poetic license the screenwriter's made.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|A visual feast for the eye, Life of Pi by far exceeds the expectations of Hollywood film-making... it's that good! Having read the book after the film (did not ruin the reading), the book club discussion I participated in agreed that the movie, unlike most, was better than the book! That director, Ang Lee took such a challenging story line and turned it into an unbelievably stunning movie shows bravery, daring and ... creative genius! While watching this movie on the big screen movie theater was spectacularly larger than life, the DVD Blue Ray (and likely, the regular DVD) is still equally awe-inspiring! The story line of this movie is inspiring, beautiful and thought-provoking. I'm thrilled to put this movie as one of my favorites of all times and truly the best visual cinematography ever produced.

B006LR0XLM|2.0|Whenever I downloaded some photos onto my desktop this Dropbox would override things even when I told it to exit and start downloading photos into it. I like to be in charge of which photos I want to have on my Kindle as well, so I prefer to either use the cable or SugarSync.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Although this game was fun, it was too easy for me and I played it in expert mode.  The clues given to solve the puzzles took all of the guess work out of the puzzle.  The story line told you where to go and which items to use.<br />I did like the game and had fun playing it but it is not for the advanced player, in my opinion.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Even when one choses \\"Winning Deal\\" one does not always finish because one may have to take some cards back or start piling them on to their respective locations. I like these kind of apps when we are watching something on TV and you have to sit through an annoying ad. Kindle makes it all nice and easy.
B002U5HKZ6|4.0|I tried reading this in a large paperback with small print, but my eyes are not the best, so I decided to buy the E-book edition, and it was worth it.  I don't think the book warrants the bad reviews some people have written about it. After reading it, I wanted to know more about the author, so I Googled him and found him to be a very interesting person.  I would recommend this book.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|We love to garden and one often tends to forget what the weather will be like. It is so nice, fast and easy to just start the Kindle and then check this app. It gives one present weather conditions, 36 hour and 10 day weather conditions and one can also ask weather for any kind of place, so we can check how weather is where family are, especially if they will be traveling. There are warnings, it gives humidity and pollen alerts, etc.

B004GYY714|5.0|I keep raving about this app to anyone who will listen. There are so many categories. Sofar I have just concentrated on music but even there it opens up whole new worlds. If you like classical, you can listen to local NPR music station, or to one in London, or I often like Avro, a Dutch baroque music station. I have tried New Age, World Fusion, and each category gives one again several choices. And the sound of the HD Kindle Fire is just wonderful. Yes the Kindle comes to bed with me where I often will continue to listen to music with lights out. Listened to station in South Africa. One can choose music according to language. I would love the Kindle if this were the only thing it did. It is just so amazing. On my laptop I used to listen to Itunes radio but they did away with that. Don't understand their thinking. Anyway, they made changes to Itunes for the worst of it.

I never have problems playing prime movies or TV shows, or videos I fully purchase but show far every time I try to rent either I get picture with no sound or sound with no picture.

B00BF11STU|2.0|Zero Dark Thirty....<br /> Zero Dark Thirty was a movie that claims to be a drama but lacks complete character development. It focused more on the main character Maya, a brand new CIA agent, searching for Osama bin Laden. The Seals also seem to lack complete character.<br />Maya in the beginning is very shy and seems like she was very sheltered, however after about one or two scenes she's a \\"badass\\" interrogator looking for a certain terrorist who could help find Osama. In the beginning she was almost afraid to look or speak to Ammar, a terrorists with ties to the 9/11 attack. She can barely make eye contact with the man she speaks only a few words to him and nothing more. Then a few scenes later she was interrogating them by herself.<br />The Seals in Zero Dark Thirty just seem to be a rag tag group of normal soldiers just playing catch with a football. In the actual raid they seem very focused however in the middle of it a few of them stop and chat about whom they shot and how they felt about it. The man who shot Osama bin Laden seems to be in a daze afterwards. Many Seals know and accept that their job requires them to shoot and kill enemies.<br />The movie needed more in-depth characterization and seemed to be a rushed woman power movie. The characters were very static and had no background story to them.  It was an Okay movie but needed more time to be developed thoroughly.

B009NQKPUW|2.0|Not all that entertaining.  No real plot/ story to speak of.  This movie is (SPOILER ALERT!) suppose to be the prequel to the first Alien movie with Sigourney Weaver.  Watch Alien and pay attention to the ship they explore at the beginning then watch this movie and see similar art.<br /><br />If you never see this movie you can consider yourself richer for it.
B00AKFG15S|4.0|The first Clifton was fascinating, the second as well. The third (this one) was more humdrum, but still a typical Archer. I intend to buy the fourth, just because the story is not finished, but my expectations are less than before.
B0084U0IEG|5.0|McEwan does a bit of literary showing off in this marvelous example of what an exceedingly talented writer can do within the confines of the standard novel. On the outside, the story involves the heroin's tangential involvement in government espionage. That story, in itself, is finely crafted and expertly written both as to plot and character development. Within that outer story is the story about one of the characters in the espionage plot who is a writer. McEwan provides ample examples of why he is considered a premiere novelist in the short stories written by  this character, which, on their own, show us that McEwan can do just about anything he wants inside and outside the confines of the traditional novel. Highly recommended. I loved it.
B00026WU82|4.0|After the half electric/half acoustic Bringing It All Back Home, Bob goes all electric. Highway 61 Revisited is considered to be the one that changed rock and roll music forever, although I feel that there are stronger songs on Bringing It All Back Home. Of course this one has Like A Rolling Stone, the song that set the course of rock music for the next 15 years. Bob doesn't really go all in, I have to admit. Desolation Row features an acoustic arrangement, and Bob would never totally abandon his acoustic guitar in the future. It is still an essential album for anyone's collection and essential to the history of rock and roll. The Beatles certainly listened closely and released Rubber Soul later in 1965. The Rolling Stones, still developing their songwriting chops, responded with the single Get Off Of My Cloud in '65 and the Aftermath LP in '66. And Bob led the way....
B006LSZECO|4.0|My wife loved this book... until the ending. She had been forewarned about this problem, and the ending still bothered her. The book has and still is selling like pancakes, so perhaps she is in the minority.
B00026WU9Q|5.0|The first of a trilogy of albums that would shock the music world and change rock and roll forever. Bob is making the transition from acoustic to electric. Side one (for you vinyl freaks) is electric, and side two is acoustic. Personally I think song for song, that Bringing It All Back Home is stronger than Highway 61 Revisited. The acoustic \\"side\\" just takes my breath away. There are very few, if any, song sequences that are as brilliant as Mr. Tambourine Man, Gates of Eden, It's Alright Ma, and It's All Over Now Baby Blue. Those four songs represent the sum total of Bob Dylan more than any other. This is rock music as art like no one had ever attempted before. A must-own album.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|Now with Sunken Condos, I can divide Fagen's disks into two groups: concept disks (Nightfly and Kamakiriad) and continuations of \\"Two Against Nature\\" generation Steely Dan (Morph the Cat and Sunken Condos).<br /><br />For me, Nightfly  -- songs of a jazz loving young-blood coming of age in the early sixties -- is still his best overall and within the concept category. Sunken Condos is a close second and the best with the Steely Dan without Becker category.<br /><br />Now that that's out of the way, let me say that I'm so glad that Fagen reversed what I thought was a step towards artistic stagnation with Morph. For me Morph was bi-modal: equal parts great tunes and mediocre ones. With Sunken Condos, I think a few of the tunes are good (Memorabilia and Out of the Ghetto) and most are great (all the rest.)<br /><br />Slinky Thing, The New Breed, Miss Marlene, Good Stuff are up  there with Fagen's best and that's no small accomplishment.<br /><br />There are also some great touches -- string bass on Slinky Thing, Kurt Rosenwinkel's guitar solo on Planet D'Ronda and the re-creation of some faux 70's cheesy funk sounds on Out of the Ghetto.<br /><br />So, if you like me, were disappointed by Morph, I recommend you buy a Sunken Condo!

Of course I have heard a few if their songs that get more air play, after listening to Jack's new album Blunderbuss, I felt compelled to dive deeper into the WS collection.<br /><br />Love the gritty sound and blues influences all throughout this album. Can't beat the bargain of $5 either for an album of this standard. My WS collection is well on its way.

B007SAKY42|5.0|NOTE: THIS REVIEW IS OF THE LP BOX SET - NOT THE CD BOX<br />I'll make this short and sweet. If you're reading this, you already love the band and you know these albums, so I'll leave the music content alone and review this deluxe presentation. This box is exactly what a vinyl junkie and Blur completist dreams about at night. Gorgeous custom packaging, beautifully reproduced LP sleeves with full color inserts, and all of the albums remastered onto multi-platter 180 gram wax. The remastering is amazing as well and is exactly as it should be.  The recordings are enhanced to sound better, not just louder.  The remastering here is as good as on the recently re-worked Smiths catalogue, and that's quite a compliment. The vinyl pressings are immaculate, and the audio quality is warm and rich.  A big, heavy, simply stunning box of Blur on LP.  Likely to become quite the collectible.
B0084AXZK0|4.0|The story is clever.  There were some profound statements.  There were lines that were quotable.  There was a message that is timeless.  That said, it was way too long.  Even though it was only a novella, it could easily been cut down to a short story.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is great for those interested in seeing a detailed view of the weather anywhere from a day by day view to hour by hour.

I loved being in the character's head and I learned so much more from this perspective. The main character is so earnest and endearing. The book had many things that weren't in the movie and the story was even better. I highly recommend.

B00B23O96A|4.0|I got a little miffed at the reviews I first read on this one.  I pre-ordered it before it's release because I'm a huge fan and ignored some of those reviews.  If you expect Eric Clapton to change the face of music and blow you away with amazing guitar work every time he releases something.. then it might not be for you.  I have enjoyed it a lot for what it is- Clapton at his current age, putting some lyrics and melodies together as he always has, and serving it up for those interested.  Almost seems unfair what people have come to expect of him!
B004SUDQ8Q|4.0|Having lent my original copy of Rabbit-Proof Fence to someone and never got it back, I was keen to get another copy of this excellent movie. Having been a fan of Phillip Noyce for some time I was looking forward to the documentary about making the movie (as well as watching it again of course). Unfortunately the new purchase did not have this documentary with it as an extra feature.<br />This incredible true story is one that everyone should watch as a lesson to be learned from past mistakes. The children - with no acting experience - were just so believable that you felt their pain and went through their struggles with them. Buy it and enjoy - but choose the version with the extras on if you can (not always an easy task).

I could never have imagined living my entire life in one 140 level structure with a massive spiral staircase in its center before reading this, but somehow it feels inevitable, now, especially with the state of the world these days.

Not only couldn't we find the set of books locally we were worried that we would not receive them in time to put under the tree because we were pretty late ordering. Besides our son being happy with the books we are very pleased with the seller sending them out promptly and the pricing was less than we would have paid at our local bookstore. We would definitely purchase from the seller again.

B001JOIEZ4|4.0|It may not have EVERY song on the movie, but I for one really enjoy all the songs they do have. Total of 12 songs and a booklet is well worth the money I  believe.

B0042RJWTC|5.0|I bought this Tudor series for my 87 year old mother as soon as Amazon sent an alert the series was available.  Mom was born and raised in England. She spends most of her time inside these days so I thought the series would really be perfect for her.  Now, every Sunday, the whole family gathers for a nice meal and a disk from the Tudors. Mom said the package was breathtaking. While I have sent many gifts over the years, this has been the one she appreciated and enjoyed the most.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Juliana Margolies is such a talented Actress. I could not stop watching this show. I love how they fully develop the characters.
B0086700CM|3.0|A super popular game.<br />Bit tedious for me. I dislike that you never get anywhere.<br /><br />Yes you are running, but where to!? Answer me that!<br /><br />That really annoyed me. The gameplay is great mindless fun, but I don't like my fun without a good mind on it!
B008XBCJ34|4.0|Amazing from a technical perspective and all in all a pretty good film. As a Marine I did not like the idea of portraying Marines as invading a planet for its resources. Surely put a bit of an anti military and anti American twist on things. I am sick of it always being the fault of the military, but then it would not be an adventure to tell the tale of the civilian control that sometimes sends our forces on missions that have little or nothing to do with National defense!!!
0307949508|4.0|I loved the first book, and this one is just as good. I haven't finished it yet, but it's one of those you don't want to put down... but maybe briefly for a review.
B0043EV774|3.0|Was hoping for a real 3-D adventure. Seemed silly to me and was so dark it was hard to see much of the film. Not what I would call a good Blu-ray or 3-D.
B00BEL4P9Q|3.0|Really love this series but darn. Never since the Civil War has one family lost so many from freak events and tragedy. I kinda feel like WWI didn't end for this family - and besides, more losses from the great flu would've been likely....Gee UK - have a little hope for us all...that's why we watch this program anyway. Hope. It would be better if Matthew were really just paralyzed and lived on. Taking him has really taken the air out of my balloon for Downton.
B00BU8QOII|5.0|Great film!  Naomi Watts was incredible.  Based on a true story, this movie explores the horror of natural disasters, the uncertainty of a family torn apart, and how hanging on to hope is one of the greatest survival skills.

B005S9EKCW|5.0|I am very happy that I have purchased this DVD.  The extra features were great, the music, unforgettable, and the price, couldn't be beat.  This is a great piece to my collection and I know I will be watching it again and again.

B000CNFC76|5.0|Playing thus movie is a wonderful game in and of itself.....a sleeper, now often seen on Golf Channel as &#34;fill&#34; for non event hours, it is a slice of history worth learning and certainly reliving. Stunning photography, well thought out script and actors who really are players.....great fun delivered on time by Amazon!
B000FA675C|4.0|It is a good read, however everyone should remember it is a book of fiction, not something to get upset about because they don't agree with the story line.
B00746O3X8|3.0|I am 5'10 180lbs and this thing will not fit me. I tighten the side straps down and at the smallest settings I have about 6-7&#34; of slack...far to much to be carrying around 2 pro DSLR's. with a little work this may be a good product or if your 200lbs+ I think it would work well. If I was to alter it...I would make it more adjustable for smaller figured people and instead of having one mount on the chest and one on the side, I would make both mounts on the sides...one left, one right at the same height. I am returning this product since it will not fit me the way I would like.

B00AX7PGQS|5.0|One of the strangest movies I have ever seen. Loved it. I am so tired of the same predictable story lines. This movie never fails to confuse and confound. The musical interlude was awesome. If you are the regular person with no imagination or spirit, go find another shoot em up action movie.There is plenty of that crap around, and more each weekend.

0670026557|5.0|First, a disclosure: I'm one of the people whose stories are featured in Adam Grant's book.<br /><br />I don't read a lot of books, but I'm glad I read \\"Give and Take\\".<br /><br />I agree with the reviewer who says the book is worth reading for the first and last chapters alone.<br /><br />The first chapter explains why people who give are more successful in business.<br /><br />The last chapter (\\"Actions for Impact\\") is a short, useful list of practical tools to apply the book's principles in life.<br /><br />The rest of the book is filled with good stories, too, but those are a bonus.<br /><br />I think overall this is an important book. If more business leaders succeed through principled giving of time, energy, connections, and knowledge, the world will be a better place.<br /><br />I want to live in a world where more people have this kind of success.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|This book is awesome.  I've been following the information it gives for the past 4 weeks and have seen some pretty big differences.  It gets straight to the point and gives a lot of good real work advice.  Definitly something everyone needs to read if you want to get a better body.
B000001EUR|4.0|After several years spent tweaking their sound, Germany's The Scorpions finally got it right on their ninth (!) full-length effort from the studio. A true milestone on the hard rock and glam metal timelines, 1984's \\"Love At First Sting\\" manages to rock sufficiently hard while simultaneously maintaining a unique melodic edge. And add to this the fact that it is filled with memorable pop-like hooks, the songs are driven home even further into your memory bank. And plus there is the fact that they are packed to the brim with impassioned clean vocals (from frontman Klaus Meine) that sound truly top-notch, and exceptional instrumental playing. (Guitarists Matthias Jabs and Rudolf Schenker, in particular, stand out for being one of metal's earliest and best six-string teams.)<br /><br />The album's obvious highpoint has to be \\"Rock You Like A Hurricane,\\" because it is not only \\"First Sting\\"'s hit lead single, it is a truly anthemic and ultra infectious number that would prove to go on to become The Scorpions' most universally-well-known song. And its use of utterly unforgettable choruses and Rob Halford-like vocal hooks played a large part in this role. But the tune's gobs of fiery, shred-happy soloing also helped it to become one of the standard-bearing party metal rockers of the Eighties. (It ranks right there alongside AC-DC's best works!) But certainly, there are other standouts. Songs like the strong and powerful set opener (\\"Bad Boys Running Wild\\"), for example, underpin catchy, galloping guitar hooks and pyrotechnic soloing with a round of strong, beeping, and grumbling bass lines. And \\"Coming Home,\\" which is one-half strings `n' all rock balladry and one-half raucously hard-rocking and propulsive heavy rocker, fueled by muscular, bottom-heavy bass grumbles, deftly up-tempo guitar leads, and fiery, screaming solos, rivals \\"Rock You Like A Hurricane\\" for being the set's pinnacle. And further highlights include \\"I'm Leaving You,\\" which boasts miles more twiddly, mazy, and thus really memorable soloing; the surprisingly blistering, near Judas Priest-y speed metal-esque romp that is \\"The Same Thrill\\"; and \\"Still Loving You,\\" a soaring, laid-back, and almost ethereal-sounding Iron Maiden-ish tear-jerking power ballad that closes out the album.<br /><br />\\"Love At First Sting\\" is not a particularly groundbreaking or even thoroughly remarkable affair, but as far as enjoyable glam metal and hard rock records go, this one is hard to beat., and thus really memorable soloing; the surprisingly blistering, near Judas Priest-y speed metal-esque romp that is \\"The Same Thrill\\"; and \\"Still Loving You,\\" a soaring, laid-back, and almost ethereal-sounding Iron Maiden-ish tear-jerking power ballad that closes out the album.<br /><br />\\"Love At First Sting\\" is not a particularly groundbreaking or even thoroughly remarkable affair, but as far as enjoyable glam metal and hard rock records go, this one is hard to beat.

B003DT19F0|4.0|\\"Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue\\" is the third installment of Disney's Tinker Bell animation series that started in 2008. This time the film explores the unexpected friendship between ever-curious Tinker Bell (voice by Mae Whitman), who gets too close to a human house, and Elizabeth Griffiths (Lauren Mote), a nine-year-old girl who believes that fairies do exist.<br /><br />Thus the story of \\"Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue\\" puts more emphasis on the adventure of Tinker Bell, who finds something to be fixed in Elizabeth's home - something related to Elizabeth's relationship with her father who wouldn't listen - than on the \\"rescue\\" mission on the part of Pixie Hollow's residents.<br /><br />Like the previous two Tinker Bell animated movies, the strength of \\"Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue\\" lies in the colorful visuals, especially those of non-human characters including Tinker Bell and other fairies. The human characters, Elizabeth's father in particular, need some improvement, lacking the style that would have made them visually more attractive.<br /><br />\\"Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue\\" is a nice addition to the franchise. The story is familiar but the film is charming nonetheless.

B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|I first heard Volbeat maybe two years ago, I heard a song on the radio and thought to myself \\" this is a good song, who are these guys?\\" I immediately went home and did a youtube search based on some lyrics in the chorus (cause the radio never tells you who's playing) and came up with Fallen by Volbeat, I then went to Amazon to see what else thay had and was surprised to see they had 3 other albums. After listening to the samples available on Amazon, i went back to youtube to listen to everything I could find and I  was blown away, Why hadn't I ever heard of this band before? Anyway I immediately set out to buy all the albums. So when i saw Volbeat was coming out with a new Album, I was excited yet hesitant because a lot of bands I like have been putting out less than stellar offerings lately. So I bought the new album and absolutely loved it. To me, this album defines Volbeat as the best, most original new band out there today. Every album just gets better and this one takes everything that was great about their other albums and rolls it into one. This album is more diverse than their others too and keeps you interested from the beginning all the way to the end. I listen to everything from John Denver and Billy Joel to Megadeth, Slayer and Cannibal Corpse, and everything in between and Volbeat is one of my favorite bands. Can't wait to see what they do next.

Lincoln's dialogue with cabinet and congressmen is riveting and spiced with his storytelling.  The war is reviewed from north and south with candor not seen in the film media.  The portrayals seem as if lifted from the pages of history and are vivid and striking.

0307352153|5.0|As a therapist with a Master's degree in Psychology, I have often studied personality differences. I feel as though I have a very good handle on intraversion and extraversion*, and commonly incorporate these elements in my practice with individuals and with couples. There has been a good amount of research on the subject of personality, but it's always exciting to come across a resource that offers new information or summarizes the research that's out there in a comprehensive way. Quiet by Susan Cain is one of those resources.<br /><br />Quiet is mainly about introverts in a world of extroversion. Cain argues, chapter by chapter, that our society has increasingly catered to extroversion and in the process has devalued the power of introverts. One of the book's best features is the research that went into it. Cain saturated the pages of Quiet with study after study about how introverts and extroverts interpret, interact with, and impact the world in very different ways.<br /><br />Reading this book was tremendously helpful for me as an extrovert in understanding myself, but also in understanding introverts. I found myself observing conversations with introverts and becoming more aware of how they interact with me. I adjusted to these conversations and was impressed with how it positively impacted the depth of our dialogue and connection as a result. Quiet helped me gain patience and confidence in my conversations with introverts, but more importantly it humbled me. All of a sudden I found myself learning from them and seeing the value of quiet in my own communication patterns.<br /><br />I have already recommended this book to friends and clients, and received good feedback about it. Introverts have told me they have felt more validated in their personality style, less insecure about themselves in relationships, and taken more risks in communication. I can see Quiet being a helpful book for both introverts and extroverts alike, applicable to just about any domain, both personal and professional.<br /><br />My only qualm with this book is Cain's references to evolution throughout the book. Quiet does not claim to be a Christian book, although it does contain many biblical references describing characters' personalities. As a Christian, however, the evolution references definitely felt out of place and unwarranted, adding no value to the subject matter. I found myself  wanting to skip over those brief sections and make my own applications from a biblical worldview. This gave me a greater appreciation for the complexities of personality, and drew me deeper into worship of God for having created these complexities to reflect Himself. Despite this qualm, I highly recommend Quiet and will likely read it again and again myself.<br /><br />I received this book from WaterBrook Multnomah as part of their Blogging for Books program in exchange for my unbiased review.

B005MSD6QU|5.0|I've been a fan since the 2nd season. I watched the 1sr season, but never became a fan of the character  Elle. But once she was out and Prentiss stepped in, it was an amazing difference. Also, Reid's character is getting more time, so that's always a plus. He's my favorite. All in all, I give Seasons 2-7 5 stars!

This is a definitely more polished album than the previous ones.  It is just a good rock album.  Songs I like right off the bat, Nameless One and My Body.  Growing on me Cape of our hero, Hangmans Body Count and Lonesome Rider.  I am so glad I listened to a Sixx Sense on XM radio and heard Nikki Sixx play a few songs.  Fan for life in the making here.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|Love the extra sounds and the cool meta waves, I think the concentration one really works. Wish you could control different sound levels when playing multiple at at time. My favorite Icon doesn't show an image on my favorites-just a grey box. Worth the money, way cheaper than buying a sound machine.
0425238091|5.0|There are books - good books! - that are written by putting what's in an authors brain, in a fairly formulaic manner that seems at times, a little forced. Books that are written to be read; easy, digestible prose in unoffensive and perfunctory doses. And then there are books that seem to have been inspired by a muse that sits on the shoulder that the author channels into paper. This book is one of the latter category.<br /><br />The House of God is a book written, as the author would put it, from deep within the author's cardiac muscles and hits you straight in the sigmoid colon. Many have compared the book to Catch-22, and they are right to do so. Both are about people essential, much respected professions, the impossibility of their lives and the cynical ways they cope with the pressures of their occupation. Both are also, about redemption, growth, and love. Both had me laugh uncontrollably and sometimes shed a tear, and both are a must read for any person that believes that humanity is the most hideous and terrible infliction that has been borne upon the universe and at the same time, the most exalted.<br /><br />I don't use the term \\"love\\" on inanimate objects often, but I loved this book.<br /><br />So a quick synopsis - but you will find many of them already everywhere:<br /><br />Dr. Roy Basch, a new intern fresh off the BMS (\\"Best Medical School\\" - a thinly veiled referenced to Harvard Medical) is off to intern at the \\"House of God\\" (again, a thinly veiled reference to Beth Israel). Eager and naive at first he quickly realizes that hospital patients fall into two broad categories: Gomers - elderly patients that refuse to die and are kept alive for monetary purposes (HOUSE LAW NO 1: GOMERS DON'T DIE) and the dying young: younger patients who have their whole lives ahead of them that unexpectedly contract something horrible and die.<br /><br />There to guide him through the conflicts and dilemmas of medical practice (and occasionally non-practice and mal-practice) is the book's unexpected hero: The Fat Man. Some would call him an anti-hero, a combination of a cynic and a humanitarian, The Fat Man has a very Dr. House air about him and is certainly one of my favorite characters of all time.<br /><br />The theme of the book is the conflict between death and life, love and hate: it is dotted with a variety of sexual exploits, where Dr. Basch and some of his friends escape to to avoid thinking about death, constantly. Raunchy in their depiction, they contrast the constant stench of people dying with the interns' attempt at living.<br /><br />All in all - the book deserves a place of honor in my book case. I only hope that the authors' other work is as sublime; Catch-22 was a one off in Heller's work. I am eager to find out if this is a one-off in Shem's.

If there's someone to write about women and leading, it's her.<br /><br />The book is heavily derived from a TED talk Sandberg gave in 2010. She discusses statistics on how few women are in leadership positions, stories of women who are embarrassed by success, and tips on how women can 'lean in' to their careers. She shares lots of personal stories, which are sprinkled with a good sense of humor. The book is filled small stories about other women who are successful and driven. One example is Clara Shih, a Stanford graduated who was appointed to Starbucks' board at the age of 29.<br /><br />Sheryl tries to imply that corporations are old boys clubs and they don't want women up top. More likely, it's that most women aren't armed with Sheryl's white hot drive. Many women simply don't want to be heads of state or the Chief executive of a multi-billion dollar company. She also believes in the wild goal of gender parity. She believes the world would be better with corporate boards consisting of 50% women and 50% men. If using this logic, maybe boards should all be 13% African American, 1.2% Native American, and 5% Asian. I'm sure Facebook is no where close to these figures.<br /><br />Sandberg doesn't adequately acknowledge the biological and evolutionary differences between men and women. Men have evolved lots of features over their evolution-- broader shoulders, taller height, and more assertive. Women have another set of features deeply ingrained in them (empathy, communication, etc) that have been around for thousands of years. A book isn't going to change that.<br /><br />Not everyone has Sheryls ambition, and I don't think a book will motivate women to become like her. The book appears to be progressive, but there isn't a sentence about racial equality or respecting other religions. These are bigger issues in America today.and I don't think a book will motivate women to become like her.

B00AKKGX4W|5.0|This book has been reviewed many times, but I just wanted to say thank you to Ms. Milan for making an unusual story so interesting. I did read The Governess Affair prior to this book, which was just as interesting. I am truly in awe of the imagination of some authors.  Sooo many books these days are so unimaginative and rehash the same story over and over again.  I appreciate something I can really sink my teeth into.  I look forward to reading more of her books.

B006M9NJFG|3.0|I haven't put this canteen cup combo to use yet and can't realy comment on overall durability as of yet but the bpa free plastic canteen itself appears to be durable I can't really comment for the aluminum cup it game with I still ned to test it, not sure if the rubber guard that is covering the handle of the cup will melt or not with boiling water. I really like the velcro secured carrier it came in too. I would have to say just handling it and overal appearance is about 3 stars if the rubber covering the handle doesn't melt or break then I would bump the rating to about a 4.<br /><br />I hope this helped.

B004HD61KE|5.0|After reading the other books in this series, I'd have to agree with the other reviews. This book keeps  you on the edge of your seat throughout. The action is non stop, with different members of sigma fighting terrorism in several locations at one time. And of course the last line came as a complete shock.

B00AIQP9DE|5.0|the game has a lot of solving u have to do to get to the next part. also have mini hunt games
B0067TGSOK|2.0|The book - I believe unintentionally - seems to assume that the general population has FAR more expertise in technical matters (internet and marketing related) than is accurate. Such being the case, a &#34;normal&#34; individual without heavy marketing and web background would need to hire high-dollar experts (and, more likely, would likely found themselves lost in the details of tech . . . not even knowing where to start).<br /><br />Look . . . there are some nice inspirational tales here, and lots of advice if you're already versed in web marketing and branding. For the average Joe, however, this book is not going to be terribly beneficial. For instance, what if you're not starting out with 5,000 Facebook or Linked In contacts? What if you're not starting with a huge list of loyal customers? Again, there's an almost inadvertent assumption that those &#34;starting up&#34; already have an established network.<br /><br />That's not a &#34;start up.&#34; That's an expansion of a business that is already doing okay.<br /><br />I like Giillebau's writing style, and he does focus on numerous success stories. What he doesn't really address is that for every one  successful start-up there are likely thousands of failures. In the same vein I would take issue with the title itself.<br /><br />The &#34;$100 Startup&#34; is quite misleading. Yes, some of his examples did put only $100 into a final launch. However, almost all either had some sort of expertise gained through either thousands of hours of experience, many thousands of dollars of education and training, or an inborn talent.
B00A14SQBU|5.0|I WAS WAY EXCITED TO GET THIS FOR ONLY $2.99!! THANK YOU AMAZON!<br /><br />i LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS ALBUM A LOT

B004ODLUGM|5.0|Our 4-year old Grandson had seen the movie &#34;The Gruffalo's child&#34; and loved it so much, I went looking for the book and other video's in this series. I found both &#34;The Gruffalo&#34; and &#34;The Gruffalo's Child&#34; in book form and Video.  I purchased them in both formats.  He loves the books and the short little videos.  It is amazing to me how well this 4-year old child understood the twist in the story.  As he watches the video, He gives out a big belly laugh every time the mouse outsmarts the other creatures of the forest.  I highly recommend this series.  The books allow him to page through at his own pace and go back and forth and search out the details in the illustrations.
074322454X|5.0|Excellent character development combined with a thorough and comprehensive dissection of events.  All wars are different, though sentiments of each side seem universal. Ambrose offers the entire theater of war in an honest, unbiased and yet very human way.

He grabbed up the book, ran to me, saying,&#34;Look, Look, a book!&#34; He was so happy to discover the Gruffalo in a book.  This way he can spend as much time on each page as he wants as we read through the story, turning back and forth as he wishes.

B001O1O71C|5.0|This book makes me really think about the horrible tragedies of the Holocaust. I can't imagine what life was like for the Jews. We all must continue to remember the lost lives of World War II. Amazing read. Emotional. I'll never think about the Holocaust the same way again.
B007THA4FI|2.0|J.K. Rowling writes beautifully.  I love reading her stuff because I can imagine every detail of the character and their life.  With this book, that is the problem.  The only likeable character died in the opening pages.  I kept reading and reading, waiting for someone that I could enjoy reading about, but it never happened.  I would feel depressed and sad at the lack of any redeeming qualities in the characters.  I wanted to badly to like the story, because I think the author has a beautiful style of writing, but in this case, the story was lacking a strong, likeable character.
B009UNGYHG|4.0|I have been through a few headsets and they tend to get damaged in the process of being carried around in a pocket or in my purse.  I bought this charging case more as a case to protect the headset than for it's charging capability.  Now I have the choice to charge the case or the headset, which is nice.  I would have given 5 stars if there was a place in the case to hold a cord, even just a short cord, since I can't charge either the case or the headset without a cord.  I already broke the cord that came with the case because it doesn't have a protective case of it's own.  Fortunately, the cord for my phone also works on the charge case so the broken cord didn't create a huge problem.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|While playing it CONSTANTLY kicks you completely out of the app. Its a waste of credits and power ups. Free tournament rooms have so many players that game locks up and you cant even use the last few numbers. WAS once a great app but now it just stinks.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Tripping lightly through this story, you gradually discover that it is both a charming tale and a parable of life. You are left wondering about the nature of time, magic, life and death. This book is deceptively simple, increasingly thought provoking, and a pleasure to read.
B004EPYZXK|5.0|I like this movie. Don't get me wrong it takes alittle time but if your someone who pays attention to the movie it will have you going wtf was that at times. It will scare a someone who's not familiar with scifi horror (girlfriends lol) or someone who strongly believes in aliens. So I say check it out its a great movie. Tip: say it's based off a true story, turn off the lights and she will get scared lol!
B0090SI4LU|2.0|Definitely disappointed with this movie! The book is WAAAAAAAY better! ... If you enjoyed the book, don't go see the movie!<br /><br />The movie doesn't really stay true to characters, not to mention they either change or leave out aspects of the book that are important to both character and story development. To be honest, the only characters that resembled what they were in the books is the main character and Uncle Jeb. I found everyone else to be either lacking or \\"completely\\" off :(
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|Very good movie, was very enjoyable not quite up to the standards of The Lord of the rings filming standards but it was very good
B0087YPCYA|1.0|A lame rip off. Stupid humor. I am sure the high school boys loved the naked girls.  I need a bit more than that even in a spoof movie.

B00846REIS|1.0|Seriously is this legal? In that case, Twilight could use some touching up. Maybe I'll just change character names and have at it. But really, this book is identical to Fifty Shades. What is it about gazillionaires that makes women want to read this smut? You read one you've read them all! I guess anyone can make big money off the whole sexy millionaire vs. naive gawky women phenom? New authors, step back. This is the new &#34;good&#34;. Submit, or be left behind.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|A favorite book in my women's book club. As a teacher I think it would be a great read and discussion book. A wonderful reminder that we are all different but some are different on the inside while others differ on the outside. Kindness is a trait we all need to have towards others in the world. I stress this in my coaching and see amazing things happen. Loved the book!!
B003UBTX6S|4.0|(I had previously published my review of Beautiful Creatures here by mistake. Oops. Here's the real one for Beautiful Darkness.)<br /><br />I enjoyed this follow-up to Beautiful Creatures. Some events were predictable (Lena pulling away was sort of necessary for the second book in a four-book series), while some of the plot development was unexpected. Some characters were developed more (Amma, Macon, Ridley). I still found myself annoyed by Ethan's voice, which was distinctly too feminine at times. Also, did the authors do any research on England? Because when Liv couldn't pronounce words (um, she speaks English, just with an accent and some different phrases) or didn't know about things that people in England do actually know about (they have cotton candy, it's called candy floss, and anyone who has ever been to Brighton has had it). Some plot points I did not think were in favor of the story as a whole (the identity of Jane, for example. I recently was reading an article about the worst movie plots of all time, which included Leia being Luke's brother and the author pointed out that it made what was supposed to be a galactic battle more of a dysfunctional family affair. Same here.)<br /><br />Also, while I admittedly am an adult who loves reading YA fiction, one of the reasons why is YA authors are writing fantastic, creative books. I think Beautiful Darkness (and Beautiful Creatures, for that matter) suffer at times from feeling distinctly like a book for teenagers. By this I mean, sometimes repetitive, focusing overmuch on minor details and missing opportunities to expand into a novel for all ages. Despite that, this series has proved thus far to be an enjoying, engaging read and I'm looking forward to the last two. Not inhaling them with no pause between, as I do even when I re-read the Harry Potter and Hunger Games series, but looking forward to them when I want something a little different.

B003WH765U|5.0|I'm a fan of Marlon Brando, I enjoy his movies. Even the undercurrent truth of &#34;A Street Car Named Desire&#34;. This Movie is poignant, thoughtful, and just makes you think. It has little tidbits of humor that makes you chuckle. Like when he waits for Hanogi as she comes routinely over the bridge, trying to appear disinterested sometimes. The way her fellow dancer tells his friend when she tries to explain the futility of getting close to her,'Neva happen!' The way a fellow pilot sees a picture of his would be mother- in - law mistaking it for his fiance and says,&#34;She's kinda beat up ain't she?&#34; And the climax when he tells her that she has a choice to make then and there will she come with him. And when you see it the first time, you think, 'she's not going to go!--PLEASE GO with him!!' I'm biased. I loved it!!
B000I8ERVM|5.0|Great movie all around and not gross at all; just creepy and it would seem that it would scare the pants off of any Christian.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Really enjoying this game. Making the animals do tricks gets my kids laughing hysterically. The timer for the babies is off,that's the only reason I didn't give 5 stars,I've been working on 1 baby hippos now for 2 days. Being able to rescue the animals makes this game much more fun then other zoo games that I've played.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|A marvelous story of opposing airmen brought together in battle and then again late in life.  This book outlines their lives, how they came to meet in aerial combat, and through their biographies great insights into the workings of the air forces especially the German fighter pilots.  The reader is quite able to feel the emotions and the &#34;Higher Call&#34; of these two enemy pilots and more so their value systems that sustained them through the war years.  A war story, a human experience story, a story of decency in troubled times, and a story of a marvelous reunion of souls.  A very good read for anyone even slightly interested in this part of history.
B0094K1MH2|4.0|It was well done animation, looked realistic. The style reminded me of a 30s or 40s era show. Mystery was good for adults and kids.

1594487154|5.0|This book is a great read for anyone. We all find ourselves in situations where 'moving' someone else is critical to what we are trying to accomplish. Dan provides a simple-to-follow framework (based on research and grounded in human behavior) that will guide you through those experiences. I finished reading the book two weeks ago and have already successfully applied Dan's ABC framework. If you buy the book, and apply the techniques, it WILL help you.<br />Thank you Dan.

B000FA675C|4.0|It is a bit dry in areas, allowing you to put down the book without that craving to keep picking it up. There are of course really good scenes but if you get into a valley where he is building up the next scene it's easy to set the book down and forget about it for a while until you see it peering up at you from under a pile of papers on your bed side.

B008I3RARW|2.0|Like the concept of this game but very limited play and more importantly, very buggy on Kindle Fire HD.  It starts the game before the game loads. Maybe that was planned to make it more challenging.
0061726834|2.0|I love Dystopian novels, this one fell flat. The writing was good at least that is why it got two stars. It also got two stars bc the idea of the story was good. It didnt turn out well though, it was a bit boring, the leading lady was unlikable, the love interest was likable but their romance was not. It is not explained how society got to this point. Although I wont be reading the next two books or the novellas I did read amazon reviews so I could find out what happens, bc I hate not knowing. Even if one liked this book i recommend not reading this series bc this is suppose to be the best one and the series ends with a bunch of cliffhangers. 30 bucks for all these books for cliffhangers.. I would be so mad. $8 for this book makes me mad enough. Oh, and last thing, I have no idea how this got picked up to be a tv show, crazy!

You had a limited number of times to &#34;mix&#34; the test tube colored liquid and once that was gone, you had to BUY more.  I wouldn't waste time on this app. Sorry but if my 3 yr old nephew--who knows EVERYTHING about dinosaurs wanted to switch to a different game, then don't think it's that great.

B00BCZU8WM|2.0|Most, if not all, of the ten tracks are 2 - 3 minutes longer than they need to be.  The redundancy gets a bit overwhelming at times.  JT stated that he wanted to create &#34;visual&#34; music, hence the album's title.  It turns out most of the tracks turned out to be 20/60 or worse.  The best tracks are &#34;Suit & Tie,&#34; &#34;Tunnel Vision,&#34; and &#34;Mirrors,&#34; the latter song giving the listener a story to be told.  As for the rest of the tracks?  I'm going to have my eyes checked.

Marrisa Meyer's Cinder (Lunar Chronicles), is a fantastic futuristic twist on the Cinderella story complete with the stepsisters and evil step mother.<br /><br />We meet Lin Cinder, a cyborg mechanic with a mysterious past, who lives in this future world New Beijing in China (123 years after World War IV) and are quickly introduced to our hero, Prince Kaito (Kai), who seems to be the heart throb to every girl in New Beijing.  Every girl that is except Cinder.  Kai visits Cinder discretely and in disguise to repair one of his royal androids secretly...Cinder instantly knows there's more to this android than he lets on.  Almost instantly, there is a spark between the two that plays throughout the book.<br /><br />Within the story lines there are undertones of a serious plague, political unrest, and an unwelcome, possibly necessary, alliance with the evil Lunar Queen, Queen Levana (who wants to take over the world, as most \\"evil\\" ones tend to want to do).<br /><br />Cinder is filled with heart-clenching twists and turns and a strong female lead who does not need a Fairy Godmother to grant her any wishes.  The minor characters (Iko, the Doctor, etc) sprinkled throughout added a nice dimension and flavor Ms. Meyer's imagery and descriptions of the characters and city made everything so believable.  I, for one, am eager to see how the story unfolds in the series!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game I have ever played. I love the graphics and also how easy it was to get the hang of. It is also really really addictive and I love it!!!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Ok. guys this game is freakin' awesome. I definitely spent 7$ well. I also have the computer version and MC PE got nether quartz and bricks before MC PC. I TOTALLY recommend this app for Minecrafters.
B000FA675C|5.0|This is the first book that attract me to read the rest of Dan Brown's story.  I love all of them.
B006ZCWTXS|5.0|Her voice reminds me of a young Aretha Franklin or Randy Crawford.  Definitely worth the purchase.  Will buy her again.
B002GIBVV6|5.0|I first saw this many years ago on a cable station. I happened to browse Amazon and found it. Oh, what a delight! Not just for children, I was a full grown adult the first time I saw it. It is magical!
B009RI4ZKC|2.0|It was all over the place and really stupid. We just sat and suffered through it. Not a good film.
B006G3MZRQ|4.0|I watched this movie on the recommendation of my son, but am not that interested in UFC/MMA. I liked the premise of this movie, but had a hard time relating to the characters, mostly the military brother, because I could never understand what was driving him. He is a very complex character: mostly seemed like a jerk, but great moments of true humanity as well. Obviously he had suffered much. I was also ambivalent about the end: I think that it would have been good to see some &#34;post-fight&#34; development of the characters, but I guess that doesn't sell.<br />Although I feel that most of the violence was gratuitous, I think that this is probably the world UFC/MMA people live in. Having said that, they did hold back from showing a lot of graphic violence.
B001IF277K|1.0|This is not what I expect, the battery does not last long. Also battery arrive in plastic bag, it can be used you can only guess.<br />Save your money, and stay away from this product.
B007VYAJAE|5.0|If you never thought about where reggae came from but you just know that the sound speaks to your inner chill, this movie will open your eyes to how lucky you are that Robert Marley was ever born. It begins where else but at the beginning of his life in St. Anne, the country side of Jamaica. Bob's experience of growing up neither white nor black allowed him the unique perspective of third person in a family, town and country. This point of view about life nearly killed him as he tried to unite Jamaica during a tumultuous political time in the small Island country's history. Robert (Bob) Marley will remain larger than life and the face of reggae music for the rest of history. More importantly this movie will help future generations know that he should be remembered as the most influential human being of our time.
B0091REZMW|4.0|So far this is a good game tho you have to review before you get very far into it.<br />Maybe I'll rate again when I finish it.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Liked the book overall  Did not like the ending.  Easy read and very captivating. Will probably read more from this author
B0097HSS4M|5.0|This app is simple , it has the usual editor , croping , and brightness with contrast . Yet , it makes all pics look their absolute best . You van size , design , brighten or darken any of your pics , just the way you like them . If you get this app , you won't regret it!!!!!
B00BHMETKC|4.0|The movie is suspenseful, funny and almost unbelievable.  The acting is great and the reenactment of Iran in the early 80s looks 100% authentic. It's worth a watch
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app is dream come true-literally. I cant fall asleep without the noise of a fan; so when I recently went on vacation and forgot my fan at home,  I tried out several free &quot;white noise&quot; apps in an attempt to get some rest. All the other apps were a joke compared this one.  There are so many different sounds to listen to alone or combined. The option to save your favorite combined sounds is great.  The only suggestion I would give is to have an option for it to keep playing even when exiting to home screen or opening other apps. Also is there any way you can make the oriental version compatible with my kindle fire? I tried to install the required i-tunes, but Amazon wouldn't allow it.
B008J34466|5.0|I love this album and all of Pink's songs.  My kids love it as well, I love all the songs especially Beam Me Up and The Great Escape.  Good one Pink.
B001DM1VXE|5.0|An allegorical tale that stimulates the mind as well as the eyes. 3D enhanced the experience. Deserved the Ocar nominations it received.
B009OA57MI|1.0|I do not like it it won't let me land the plane<br />But it's fun but I hope a lot people like it
B0052AC8C6|5.0|A great flick, lovable characters and fun story. I would recommend this to my adult friends as well as kids!
B00985E3UG|5.0|After reading this book I'm going to stop eating processed foods and get back to making foods from scratch, so that I can limit my intake of salt, sugar and fat.  Mr. Moss did an excellent job of revealing what goes into our foods from manufacturing to advertising.  Scientists who create ways to add just enough salt, sugar and fat to create the bliss point so that we come back for more are also part of the process.
B00AEFY5MK|5.0|I have been a fan of the Grease movie for as long as I can remember.  My sister and I would sing every song from the movie.  I am so glad it was put on Blu-ray.  Now I can view this old school movie on today’s modern digital equipment. Picture quality is superb!
B008Y73XTQ|5.0|I have watched Das Boot several times over the years and enjoy it immensely. For once, a war movie without preaching or propaganda but only the fears and pride of the fighters. The character development is wonderful and you really form a bond with the men and especially the Captain. Make sure you see the full version and not the cut or edited one.
B003UBTX7C|4.0|Another example of the writing success of David Baldacci.  I enjoy his style, characters, and plot twists.  This book met all my criteria for a very good, perhaps not great, reading experience.  In fact, the entire Camel Club series has been a great reading experience.<br /><br />This time Oliver Stone has teamed up with a British detective.  It brings a different dynamic to the book.  A nice touch to this book.
B00BBQXQFI|4.0|Its good enough to entertain adults, but not great.<br />Kids enjoyed it.<br />This is not going to be one of those movies you pull out every year, but its worth watching once.
B008CPZNL6|1.0|I loved flipboard on my Iphone and excited to use it on my amazon kindle. I am disappointed with regular freeze and crashing on my kindle. I will better use News republic or Pulse
B0083VP2KQ|5.0|This is a decent dinosaur set to watch.  Relates more current findings (as of 2013) and has a lot about the relationship between birds and dinosaurs.  It has a nice balance between the action of the dinosaurs and narrative facts and still-images being displayed. We really like that it is full screen and that it has really good resolution (for not being blu-ray). (I tried a blu-ray version and it wouldn't play on our PlayStation 3... and we had to return it.) We just ordered a couple of other new BBC Dino DVDs that have recently come out... and are looking forward to those (as this DVD was indeed quite nice!) All in all, this DVD is educational, entertaining, interesting, and it features some of the largest and most interesting of the dinosaurs. This is well worth getting!
B0085RQLXK|5.0|Love Aerosmith, can't get enough. Just as good as always. Have thoroughly enjoyed this cd. love it love it love it
B0028IDXDS|5.0|He loves his little monkey paci.  He can find it in the crib at night much easier than the standard paci, and loves playing with the little monkey even if he's not using the attached pacifier.
B008YKGQR4|4.0|I have this on my Kindle Fire...Not sure if it's a true app for this device.  Need to try it more often and maybe it will be more useful.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|A fascinating story. It's beautifully written, evocative of time and place. The characters are complex, and the plot carried me along in fascination. This book made me want to read more on the ante-bellum period.
B00BI73CVI|3.0|Initial slow start turned into something nice. Extremely fond of this story and have been disappointed many times. This started off to be a disappointment. The cinematography was fantastic but the voices struggled to match the authenticity of the characters.<br /><br />It took awhile to get over the surprise in voice quality, but once able to the show turned out really nice.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|WOW. WHAT-A-BOOK!<br />Leave to Colleen Hoover to write a book that sucks you right in!!  I fell in love with her writing style in \\"Hopeless\\" and again during this book. Amazeballs!!!<br /><br />I canNOT believe I put off this book for so long!!! Shame on me! And if you still haven't read it, shame on you as well!!!!<br /><br />This story is VERY realistic. A lot of emotional things happen and I was brought to tears many, many times.<br /><br />I cannot stress enough how much I love Will and Layken. This is not the usual love story. In a way, their romance is ONE of the many things going on in this book. I honestly don't want to go into a lot of details because this is just one of those books that you HAVE to read to understand just how PHENOMENAL it really is.<br /><br />I honestly can't write a review for this book and not mention the slam poetry. I mean.. Every single poem literally left me with my mouth open... They were BEYOND incredible and amazing. Eye opening!<br /><br />This book is not only a must read, but a you-HAVE-to-read-book!!!!!<br /><br />Can't wait to start the sequel, \\"Point of Retreat\\", and I am even more excited to read \\"This Girl\\" which is \\"Slammed\\" in Will's Pov!!!!<br /><br />6 stars!!!!!!!!!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|We always love the drama and unexpected twists and turns.  I think it was a lot more exciting in the first season but we still watch them all.  :)
B008KP2VZY|4.0|It works well at synchronizing data from phones and interacts well with Tasker for uploading backups to cloud.  I wish they had a user manual to he'll new users understand the methodology.
B000JIN3J8|4.0|I have watched many renditions of Pride and Prejudice, because each one reveals story lines I have not seen before.  I liked this series of the story because the family seemed realistic.  Except for the mother whose \\"nerves\\" were played too heavily.
B0002VKZL6|5.0|I've always been a Dire Straits fan but up until 8 or 9 years ago I never really went after Knopfler's solo CDs. Big Mistake! His music is more refined and addictive than DS IMO. Gotta Say that \\"Back to Tupelo\\" is one of my favorite Knopfler songs ever.  This CD will take a little time to grow on you and I really feel the arrangement could have been better but that is what mp3 players are for. I found this CD to be great listening on Sunday after I have completed my yard work and am enjoying a cold glass of Ice Tea in the lawn chair. It's also great after that stressful day at work on the ride home.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|***April 13, 2013 Update***<br /><br />In fairness, I should include the followup I received from the Calengoo staff the day after I wrote the review below - I appreciate this kind of quick customer service.  I'm changing my rating to 5 stars.<br /><br />*****<br /><br />Here is the email I received:<br /><br />\\"Sorry, this isn't a part of CalenGoo, it is a function of the Amazon<br />App Store app. CalenGoo does not ask you for your Amazon password.<br />CalenGoo doesn't even contain any code for it.

Since I have a long password, which I don't have committed to memory, and I use a password manager, I cannot use CalenGoo until I'm at home or at work where I have access to my password manager.<br /><br />This is a major problem and makes it impossible to access critical information.  I don't recall CalenGoo requiring this previously and I know no other apps that require you to log into Amazon in order to use the app.<br /><br />If this is something new which has been implemented by CalenGoo, I strongly suggest you turn it off or you will lose good, longstanding customers of your app.<br /><br />Get rid of this annoying problem and I'll raise my rating to 5 stars.ation.

B00371XIJE|5.0|Philosopher, Josiah Royce, for whom Royce Hall at UCLA is named, opined that loyalty was the highest of all human qualities because it often required the individual or group to act against their own self-interest.  Well, HACHI demonstrates that that quality is not unique with humans.  The loyalty of HACHI would move even the most hardened and cynical person and the film is both beautiful and moving.  I not only recommend this film but I also send videos of it to friends as an educational and inspiring gift.  Will Carter
B0061S073A|4.0|I love this app. It is really easy to set up and I love the control it gives me. The only thing is I wish you could add children's books to the kids place so they could read too. I would really like some way to separate adult books from the kids books to make it easier for them to access their books. All in all, a great app.
B009AMANH4|5.0|When the news was let out that Steven Spielberg was creating a film based on the brilliant book \\"Team of Rivals\\" [[ASIN:0743270754 Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln]], I was thrilled. After getting the BluRay recently and finally watching the film, my expectations were exceeded mightily ;)<br /><br />For those who've yet to see Lincoln, a little context is key: this is not a movie about Lincoln's private life or any other aspect of the 16th president that could be salacious or titillating. This is a living presentation of the dialog, written and spoken, surrounding Lincoln's feverish attempts to force the 13th Amendment to the American Constitution, banning slavery and involuntary servitude for all time within the borders of the United States, to a vote in the US Congress.<br /><br />With the exception of a very few battle scenes of the late Civil War, this is NOT an action movie. The vast majority of the dialog comes from diaries, public documents, speeches and overheard conversations. This movie turns all of those sometimes dry, humorless records into vivid, spellbinding dialog. The movie becomes a video history book.<br /><br />This movie is an in-depth view behind the scenes of the contentious trading and political deal-making required for an extraordinary political and moral stand by elected politicians, it's sad to see how much we've lost in comparison to the political cowards who run the country today with one eye on instant ratings and social media and one ear cocked to self-serving and corrupt influence-peddling lobbyists.<br /><br />Much has been written on the interpretations of Abraham and Mary Lincoln by Daniel Day-Lewis and Sally Field, and all of the praise on this remarkable pair of actors is well deserved. History has painted Mary Todd with broad caricaturing strokes that have made her at best an almost comic figure. Sally Field restores her humanity and basic goodness and decency. Day-Lewis has, in my opinion, restored the 16th president to living, breathing life, surrounding the legacy of Lincoln's writing and speeches with the shell of a thoughtful, caring, self-effacing man who was tortured by the carnage of civil war as well as the basic inhumanity of a people who felt they could rightfully own and abuse an entire race. There are no recordings of Abraham Lincoln's voice, but from all that I've read (quite a lot) about the president's speaking style and vocal intonations, Daniel Day-Lewis has, I feel, given us the closest view of Lincoln's speaking abilities that history will ever know.<br /><br />I hope that someday this movie becomes required viewing in high school history courses, perhaps someday creating a generation of brave and committed politicians who again put their country above their own ambitions.<br /><br />Please see this movie and remind yourself that our national leaders CAN achieve greatness...
B005K17RU0|5.0|You can't go wrong with this one, one of the best free apps yet.<br />It hasn't been wrong.  I will use this often.
B005IQZB14|4.0|A real easy read.  For a non-fiction book, it reads like fiction.  If I were a bit younger, it might inspire me to try the PCT.  Really well done.
B005GRTNXC|5.0|Glassheart has hit after hit after hit!  Leona delivers excellent up-tempo songs as well as ballads.  I love this cd!!
B007REV4YI|5.0|Arrived promptly. Intensity of color and crisp detail with the blue ray disc on our high-def TV. Story line very good, movie moved very quickly.
B00B2DSK06|5.0|Great movie! Disney had a great idea w this one, we always find new video game characters every time we watch. Definately a must see
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is really great to be able to find a passage on the go and I love that I can listen to it while I make dinner or while I drive.
B000K8EQ5W|5.0|First time I watched this movie I knew it was going to be a longtime favorite. Sandra Bullock is a favorite & she never disappoints. Wasn't a big fan of Keanu Reeves before this movie but his performance was heartfelt & moving. Looking for a great love story with a twist, then you'll love this.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|I can tell you that I loved every word of the book and constantly finds ways to apply it to my life.
B0061C1NQ6|5.0|I got this for a reread in partial preparation for a trip to Moscow. It was like rediscovering a long lost friend. Cruz's insight in the Russian character is deep and satisfying.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Great show with excellent writing, and a gripping storyline. Phenomenal casting. Very entertaining! Looking forward to watching the next 4 seasons!
B00280LYIC|5.0|The book was great.  The lightning thief was one of the best books I had ever read.  Great first book to a awesome series!
B004TI5N38|4.0|Fun read if you like the genre.  Reminds me a little bit too much of Lee Child's Reacher, whom I love, but still a good, fast read
B001NXDSLG|5.0|Bought it, love it, took me back !  Showed it to my kids, now in their 30's, and they want it so they can show their kids when they get older.  I BIG piece of history, done very well !  I recommend it for all baby boomers that want to pass an acurate bit of history along to future generations !
B008393Q2O|1.0|I was looking for a list that would hold just the titles on the first page and you then would select the subject and see the rest of the note. This app is not for me.
1846141567|3.0|I can deal with the author being a self-important ass, but this book is almost completely anecdotal and non-rigorous, lazily researched, poorly footnoted, and spends a couple hundred pages going on about a pretty simple concept that should take 30 seconds to explain. It's baby-level complex systems theory dressed up with a bunch of forced classical literature and pop culture references (and a big dollop of self-aggrandizement). Congrats to Mr. Taleb for throwing together something people are willing to pay for, but don't waste your money.
1936608898|5.0|Excellent read. Makes sense to me. Very sustainable and I feel healthier after just over a month. So glad this was recommended to me. Recommend the recipe book \\"Well Fed\\" to go alongside this book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it my friend showed me it.  Well  now now I love it  .  A some game you would love it<br />So get it now it is so good and fun so<br />Get to day now<br />Come on let's go get now<br /><br />Go go go go go go go go<br /> I love it so much<br /><br />Come what are you waiting on
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Does there need to even be another review for this game? How much fun can you have creating a fake virus and wiping out the world? LOTS!!
B004EPYZSK|5.0|How can you go  wrong with Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig. Good story line and action, how can you go wrong.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Level of contiguous tiles is difficult to see. Otherwise is excellent. Graphics are also very good. I recommend it to anyone.
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|it is sad that this is a 3D only release (dose not include a 2D version) at a premium price. I diffidently would have picked up this move if it included both (like every other 3d Blu-ray does) I hope this is not a new trend for the consumers sake.
B000FA5TTW|5.0|Very interesting, murderous, sweet, and a great read! A scary and gruesome book that I could read again!!!!!! Great read!!!!!!!
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|Ive been a fan of Volbeat for awhile now, and I am continually impressed with everything they put out. Outlaw Gentleman and Shady Ladies is no exception. A lot of reviewers are saying that they feel this album just isnt the same, and I say thats a good thing. If every album they put out sounded exactly the same, I would have lost interest by now. Its cool to have a new album that sets itself apart musically from the rest. There is enough of that heavy riffing, drum pounding awesome sound to keep us older Volbeat fans into it, while staying fresh and not just putting out cookie cutter rock. Michael Poulsen's vocals are tight and powerful as always. Stand out tracks in my opinion are \\"The Hangman's Body Count\\" and \\"Dead But Rising.\\" There are some great guest vocals on \\"Room 24\\" and \\"Lonesome Rider.\\" Id recommend this to any Volbeat fan, or anybody thats into good rock. Go see these guys live if you get the chance, they still have a lot of festival shows on the schedule for 2013.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I love this series! My mother-in-law recommended it and it's a bit addicting. I find myself reading on my phone when I'm standing in line just to see what happens next. There are some slow parts, but the wait is worth it. Great price for 5 books too! On to The Shift!!!
B00821OX98|4.0|There are times when this show seem like a direct homage to better shows, like The Walking Dead or Lost. The special effects are rather campy at times, the characters are not developed fully and lack some of the real human grit and darkness that makes those other shows good, and the story line is not particularly imaginative, drags at times, and takes inconsistent twists at others. With all that said, given time it is still engaging and entertaining.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This is by far one of the best books I've ever read. I don't want to give anything away- the story is about an abusive relationship that is on a whole new disturbing level. The writer gives graphic details that are pretty gruesome at times, but they are necessary to bring you into the mind and world of the main character. This is a phenomenal thriller with plenty of suspense, twists and nail biting moments! Definite page turner that you cannot put down. Spent plenty of late nights as I had to know what happened next!  I even found myself reading a few pages in the morning before work.  From beginning to end, I loved every page! Superbly written, well developed characters and simply an amazing story.  This book would make a fantastic movie. Kudos to the author for such a fine job. Best book I've read in a long time.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Good puzzles, find the clues, some hidden objects.  I like the easy or hard version where you have to figure it out yourself or can get hints.,
B009JZTOG8|5.0|So many of the stories I read during childhood began with those words and most ended with living happily ever after, but never did the characters join forces as they do in this excellent presentation of those old tales.  Strong female characters and well written dialogue propel this series forward every week.  Sweetie P and I are trying to catch up, and really appreciate the capability of streaming the shows from Amazon through our Netgear Push 2 TV box
B0016BPWNM|5.0|When my children were young I rented this and it was wonderful.  Every child should see this.  It teaches them so much in a cute way.  Very good message.  Of course I watched it to see David Bowie!! :)  Since I could never find it to rent again I decided to buy it.  I could watch it over and over.  I certainly will show it to my grandson when he is a little older.
B005XN31LY|5.0|Can be a stand alone series with beginning and end for those that don't want to continue, although I highly recommend that you do so.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's pretty cool(:<br /> Especially if you like horses!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />Haha so yeah!<br />Idk what else to write. So hi. Um have a nice day!<br />Lol
B003G4W49C|5.0|I'm Arvid Fantasy reader and the thing that struck me most about this book was the fact it was so fulfilling but all fit in one book. There was genuine closer to all facets of the book without the book feeling rushed. Very we'll done
B007L5LD9O|5.0|I really enjoyed this faithful adaptation of the Jane Austen novel. Gwyneth Paltrow played the title character in a way that inspired empathy, yet still conveyed Emma's flaws. One of my faves.
B0041T52S6|5.0|For starters, this film is great, and a breath of fresh air when compared to so much of Hollywood's output these days.  Those of you who like the comic, you should be plenty happy with what you get here, it retains the heart, wit, style, humility and fun of the books.<br /><br />Some folks won't like it (mostly due to its style), and that's fine, this movie won't be for everybody, but the main reason I'm throwing my 2 cents in here is because a lot of these negative reviews are claiming this movie is \\"all style, no substace.\\"<br /><br />That's a completely idiotic and shortsighted statement.<br /><br />The core point of this film, and indeed the entire 6-part comic series as well, is that Scott Pilgrim is NOT a nice guy, turns a blind eye to his faults and double standards, but by the end of his adventure develops some self-awareness and a measure of emotional maturity and self-respect, thereby truly becoming a better person.  Since the movie/comics are played out from his perspective, his crappy behavior isn't always rubbed in the viewer's face, so those who watch movies without *thinking* about them probably missed it.<br /><br />If so, that's too bad, because this movie does a great job at showing how selfish, cowardly behavior can really spread once someones heart gets involved.  Scott doesn't think anyone gets hurt by how he handles breakups, but look at how quickly Knives, formerly sweet and innocent, starts coming on to Young Neil just to make Scott jealous.  Because Scott jerked her around, now she's jerking someone else around, hurting Young Neil in the process.<br /><br />There's other examples, but the whole point is that its good for these themes to be explored in a way that slacker hipster types will actually want to watch, since there are plenty of us out there who could use this message presented to us.  I can look back to times where I did stuff just like Scott, inadvertantly hurting others because it was the easier option for me, and I was the only one I was thinking about at the time.  I know plenty of people out there who *still* act as bad (or worse) as Scott with their romantic relationships, even though they're WAY older than 23.<br /><br />As far as it being \\"too hip\\" or \\"too self-aware\\" as others have complained about, you guys all know it was MAKING FUN of hipsters right?  There's tons of biting satire about the indie scene, etc. even though they do right by not making any of it particularly mean-spirited.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|it keeps me very entertained and I've had no problems using the touch screen on the kindle fire.  Since I've only played this on an iPad, I'm thrilled that I can sue it here.
1476733953|5.0|I am one of those people who can start to read a book and within a few chapters know what is going to happen.  It makes finding a book to read a challenge.  What a wonderful surprise to find that this book not only kept me guessing but surprised me numerous times.  I found it extremely difficult to put down because I began to care about the characters and wanting to read.. Just one more chapter... To find out what happened next.<br />I am eagerly looking forward to reading more from this author.<br /><br />If you are looking for a book that will captivate, surprise, and entertain you.. This is the book!  What's even better is that you won't have to take out a loan to read it.  A very inexpensive investment considering how well written and what a good read this book is.

B009VL299E|2.0|Metalica has performed live all their career and this is a very pollished performance from a seasoned band. The linup is a good mix of old classics and new songs. James is great as always. The drawback here, and the reason for 2stars, is that Lars acts like Gollum on the drums, sticking his tongue out the whole time and making faces. This is hard to watch and annoying. This is a made-for-DVD performance and it is well-lit and clean, rather boring, performance by a band known for great live performances.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|I have seen les Mis on stage and read it several times...but there is something about seeing on the big screen that is wonderfully inspiring. Still trying to figure out how Anne Hathaway manages to cry and sing at the same time, but it is poignant and lovely. The full ensemble scenes are wonderful and the acting deserving of the Oscar nods (and awards) they received.

B00947N6D8|5.0|I don't always enjoy watching children's movies with my kids, but this one is different. It is beautifully animated and the storyline is about hopes, dreams, and triumph over evil.

B0002234LS|4.0|This is a strange movie that's for sure, clever writting and directing but grewsome outcome although you don't really see the blood and gore of it all it is implied and you see the end result. You feel sorry for ole John thinking no one understands him until you realize he is the psycho after all.  Perfect for Johnny I guess.

0743277465|1.0|It took me a month to finish reading this, so I can't even give it points for being a good autobiography. I suspect the autobiographical parts were ghostwritten because they're so goofy and cliche, so I won't say Josh is unlikeable, but the Josh character portrayed by the ghostwriter is not likeable. All he does is talk about preparing for some super-hard competition, and either winning in the end, or losing and coming back and winning next time. Every time, over and over, in a totally generic voice with no personality.<br /><br />On \\"learning\\", Josh spends most of his time trying to move up from the 99th percentile to be the very best. That's competition not learning. And indeed most of what Josh talks about is out-psyching and out-gaming opponents, not developing skill. As for how he got to the 99th percentile in the first place -- what most of us would be interested in \\"learning\\" -- he has the best teachers money can buy, unlimited time to study and practice, and supportive parents. If something is hard to learn at first, he doesn't give up, because he realizes some things take some time to learn, and he'll get it eventually. Great. But not exactly rocket science. This is the story of how a professional athlete succeeded through dedication and confidence, and being given every opportunity. \\"Learning\\" may be something Josh spent a lot of time doing, but it's not something this book has much to say about.<br /><br />I'll end the review with a joke about the book deserving its 1 star, because at least you can burn it for light and warmth. It's uncreative, and no one would ever find the joke clever or entertaining. Quite like the book itself. So now you know.

B009VA1FN6|3.0|The story is a little mundane for me but it has a good twist at the end and, as it progressed I began to like the book more.  Tells the story of a young woman and her siblings and their relationship with their mother that goes back through her war years and eventually leads to a crime committed years later that only the orator was subject to as the eldest daughter.  Wasn't my favourite book but the last few chapters were enthralling.  Worth a read.

B007Z9QP3K|5.0|Das Boot is a must-see classic! And so even 30+ years after it was made. Based on real events, it is both realistic and suspenseful. In short, it is one of the best war movies ever made.
B0058Z4NR8|3.0|This book claims that \\"extractive institutions\\" prevent nations from becoming wealthy, and \\"inclusive institutions\\" favor wealth creation. It is full of anecdotes that occasionally have some relevance to their thesis. (The footnotes hint that they've written something more rigorous elsewhere).<br /><br />The stereotypical extractive institutions certainly do harm that the stereotypical inclusive institutions don't. But they describe those concepts in ways that do a mediocre job of generalizing to non-stereotypical governments.<br /><br />They define \\"extractive institutions\\" broadly to include regions that don't have \\"sufficiently centralized and pluralistic\\" political institutions. That enables them to classify regions such as Somalia as extractive without having to identify anything that would fit the normal meaning of extractive.<br /><br />Their description of Somalia as having an \\"almost constant state of warfare\\" is strange. Their only attempt to quantify this warfare is a reference to a 1955 incident where 74 people were killed (if that's a memorable incident, it would suggest war kills few people there; do they ignore the early 90's because it was an aberration?). Wikipedia lists Somalia's most recently reported homicide rate as 1.5 per 100,000 (compare to 14.5 for their favorite African nation Botswana, and 4.2 for the U.S.).<br /><br />They don't discuss the success of Dubai and Hong Kong because those governments don't come very close to fitting their stereotype of a pluralistic and centralized nation.<br /><br />They describe Mao's China as \\"highly extractive\\", but it looks to me more like ignorant destruction than an attempt at extracting anything. They say China's current growth is unsustainable, somewhat like the Soviet Union (but they hedge and say it might succeed by becoming inclusive as South Korea did). Whereas I predict that China's relatively decentralized planning will be enough to sustain modest growth, but it will be held back somewhat by the limits to the rule of law.<br /><br />They do a good (but hardly novel) job of explaining why elites often fear that increased prosperity would threaten their position.<br /><br />They correctly criticize some weak alternative explanations of poverty such as laziness. But they say little about explanations that partly overlap with theirs, such as Fukuyama's Trust (a bit odd given that the book contains a blurb from Fukuyama). Fukuyama doesn't seem to discuss Africa much, but the effects of slave trade seem to have large long-lasting consequences on social capital.<br /><br />For a good introduction to some more thoughtful explanations of national growth such as the rule of law and the scientific method, see William Bernstein's The Birth of Plenty.<br /><br />Why Nations Fail may be useful for correcting myths among people who are averse to math, but for people who are already familiar with this subject, it will just add a few anecdotes without adding much insight.e limits to the rule of law.<br /><br />They do a good (but hardly novel) job of explaining why elites often fear that increased prosperity would threaten their position.<br /><br />They correctly criticize some weak alternative explanations of poverty such as laziness.

B00B5A9FLY|3.0|After watching season 4 on Netflix, I cheated to watch season 5 as it aired in the UK, and then I watched the last episode more times than any normal mortal would be expected to--roughly 160--because I became hooked in a totally unexpected way, probably because of Colin Morgan's acting, although Bradley James is outstanding as well.  In fact, I bought the boxed set in part to pay back the BBC for all the times I watched that last episode for free.  The commentary I most wanted to listen to was the one for episode 13, and someone pointed out in a review that it's missing in the US version, so I  found it online and listened to it and that's when I understood.  Sure, I always found Merlin fun, even when the plots were repetitive and they ignored their own mythology when convenient.  But that last episode changed my life, and if that sounds dramatic, it's only partly so since I am agoraphobic and haven't been anywhere in roughly 32 years, yet I'm flying to the UK in May 2013 to see Colin Morgan act as Ariel at The Globe.  When I listened to the commentary, I realized that for the audience, it was important in a different way than it is for the people who made it.  For Katie McGrath, for example, it appears to have been just a job.  Maybe that's all it was for any of them--a job, a way to make a living. That's what came across in many of the commentaries.  So be glad that the BBC didn't give us that commentary. You can find anything that's missing on YouTube or illegally online somewhere. Be grateful for the good times, and like a bad breakup, forget the bad.

B009EHDU7U|5.0|I love finding books that are a little bit different and this was one of the great ones!  I couldn't put it down from the moment I picked it up.  Written tongue in cheek it reminds me of the Forest Gump story.  Little old man, escapes from the dreary nursing home and goes on an adventure where he meets some unlikely allies and, by default, comes into quite a fortune in stolen bank notes.  Ultimately he meets up with the crooks, despatching a few of them along the way, and making friends with the others.  The story hovers between the present and the past and gradually you learn much more about this man who is born in poverty without much schooling but who manages to go through life, meeting one world leader to another by his expertise in blowing things up!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Being a non-technical person who knows absolutely nothing about engineering, physics and all that boring stuff, I never expected to enjoy a book absolutely crammed full of it. But I did. Although most of the time i had no idea what they were talking about, woven in and around all the tech-speak is a fascinating and surprisingly enternaining story of a clever man's everyday struggle to survive on Mars. Will he ever get home?  I wont say, you will have wait till the last chapter to find out. But do it. It's worth the read.
B007JCP8FE|5.0|I was really looking forward to purchasing this CD when I had the money for it, so when it showed up discounted I jumped on the opportunity. And I wasn't disappointed in the least!! This CD would have been worth the original purchase price and then some!! If I were forced to pick a Favorite CD that Shinedown has released, this would be it, but all of their music follows closely behind!!
B0064MGU98|5.0|I loved watching the first season, the director capture the essence of the woman behind the man, her unique reasons. I am in no way saying that it would be anyone's particular choice. But in the end she is stronger in her character and her choice. Greatly written.
159420411X|5.0|Those of us who fall into the classication of knowledge workers spend more time than we realize creating and consuming  predictions.  This book is an excellent grounding in how to think about predictions realistically.  Also it has the most straight forward and practical explanation of the Bayesian approach to predicting that I have seen.  Great read.
0553801473|3.0|No specific spoilers, but plot-points are mentions without character associations.<br /><br />One of the things that drew me to A Game of Thrones was George R.R. Martin's willingness to kill off main characters. People who you'd thought would be the protagonist, or the antagonist, died.  To me, it's a singular distinction that made the series so powerful, actions have consequences. You can't make a bad decision and get away with it like so many other movie, television, and book characters.<br /><br />That's the first part of what makes this book such a disappointment to me.  In a previous book, we saw a character brought back from the dead through magic.  Okay, cool, this person is no longer alive, but is not a zombie either, seeking revenge, as he/she has nothing else to hope for.  We also saw several characters with their head on the proverbial executioner's block, and assumed the chapter ended because the PoV character died.  Not the case for at least two characters from past books.  The first one made sense, given the context of the situation, the second one was just kinda thrown in there with no explanation, which it sorely needed, and though we know it will come in the next volume, it basically sent the message that anyone who you thought may have died, if you didn't see the body (with clear identification being verified), was fair game for regeneration.  In addition to that, there were at least two chapters that ended with the PoV character being knocked out or dragged to their death, only to appear alive later.  The tension wasn't there, by this point anyone paying attention would know that characters don't get killed off screen anymore.<br /><br />The cliffhanger in the closing chapters of the book, a scene that should have had me thinking 'wow, I can't believe Martin killed that character off!' instead had me thinking, 'that character is still alive, and will turn up in chains or something', Maybe I'm wrong, but we didn't see the body, so who knows.  Another character ends the book with what I think we're supposed to believe is a deadly disease, but we we should all know better, its something else and that the character will survive it.  And that's the problem right there, the threat of death is almost completed nerfed in this volume (nerfing meaning they're replacing their metal swords for foam nerf bats).<br /><br />One chapter had a non-PoV character dying but not really, and that I'm okay with, it advanced the plot and revealed character motivations.  One character has a deadly disease, but it is possible to survive it, or live with it a long time before you die, so its no trick on us readers.  These situations serve to advance the plot and provide motivation and character insight.  The other stuff, where I feel Martin is just throwing curve balls for the hell of it, that only ends the suspension of disbelief for me.  When the author does the, 'aha, got you, he or she is not really dead!', I no longer feel I'm living in the world I'm reading about.  I feel manipulated and like its part of a marketing strategy or something to forcibly keep me engaged.  I'm no longer reading the chronicles of Westeros, I'm reading the 'buy the next installment to see what happens'.<br /><br />One thing that really got me was that in the book a female character is raped, and responds by having sex with a boy toy.  I'm sorry, but that character would've gone down to the river and scrubbed herself raw.  Her reaction wasn't believable to me at all, and if there was a reason for it, something that would have made sense of it (like she's been raped so many times before that she has her own way of dealing with it), I could've believed it, but as I read it this was the first time it happened, so suspension of disbelief shattered again.<br /><br />Also, I want to add that from the beginning of the series I would let out an aggravated sigh whenever a Daenerys chapter begun, because I knew it wouldn't have significant relevance to the plot.While things are coming together in this book, it's still not going anywhere fast (it's going nowhere slowly, really), but even with her presence now directly influencing actions from characters in Westeros, I still feel as though if you were to skip all Daenerys chapters, you wouldn't miss anything, the rumours from other PoV chapters are enough to tell you what's happening.  Sure, she's an interesting character in of herself, her choices and actions and their consequences are compelling, but in a book with so much going on her story is too disconnected that it just slows the main story (Westeros) down.  She could've been written up in companion volumes that only followed her story, published in between the main books.  The same is true for the Martells, who started getting aided in.  Interesting stuff, but not advancing any plots.  They don't need the spotlight put on them to tell the story, and when you're struggling to publish 1000+ page books in a timely manner, cutting some of the chaff would help.<br /><br />So all in all, Martin's prose is still fantastic, and I still love the world he has created, but I feel like this book is the weakest so far.  While little plot is advanced, changes are occurring, and new characters are introduced who will have great relevance in the next book.  We learn a lot more about the world outside of Westeros, which is helpful if you want to RPG A Game of Thrones, not so much if you want to know where the story is going.<br /><br />****spoilers from past books ahead****<br /><br />The only plot points involving Daenerys from the first book was the failed assassination, a minor talking point between Robert and Eddard, and the fact her brother was killed.  Yes, Lord Mormont is at the Wall while his disgraced son is her devoted body guard, but it is not a plot device.  Nothing comes of it, and had they been unrelated, nothing in the story would have been different.  If Mormont ever goes to the Wall, it will become relevant, but tillthen, nothing doing.<br /><br />From the second book, the fact that magic is becoming more powerful again cause of her dragon's being born.  Nothing else that happens has any impact on the main plot.<br /><br />From the third book, her taking of Meereen (and felling Astapor and Yunkai) doesn't influence anything in the third or fourth books, but word of it acts as motivation for characters to seek her out in the fifth book. That's cool, I'll grant you, but is not much justification for the real estate it occupies within the book.  The deposed white knight Barristan Selmy reveals himself, but its a minor plot point.  Cersei deposed him, he left and went to find the heiress two kings ago (from his perspective).  Had he been deposed earlier than when A Game of Thrones begins, it wouldn't have made any difference, there was no character development of him before the fifth book.<br /><br />Like I said, interesting stuff, particularly how she treats her dragons in the fifth book and the consequences of that, but it's not moving any plots further that it's inclusion aids in the story.<br /><br />****spoilers from this book ahead****<br /><br />Wherever whores go?  Come on, Tyrion, that was your father saying he doesn't give a hoot about Tysha.  He has no idea what happened to her, he doesn't care.  He couldn't care less.  Why do you give his last words so much significance?
B0095P33IW|4.0|It's an okay movie.  Not worth paying more then a few bucks to see.  Lots of action and a decent story.
B0043U98RY|4.0|At first I was put off by the relentless splash of CGI goo and guts.  Once I settled in, however, I realized 'Spartacus' was employing that over-the-top visual style of the graphic novel. So I gave it permission to be gross. In return, Spartacus set designers, costumers, DPs and digital artists create an epic feast for the eye.<br /><br />But even the fanciest lighting and graphics can't drive a whole series. The various story threads give us a peek into every layer of Roman society. The writers had a bit of trouble trying to use a Latin language cadence; that structure would occasionally break down or flare up in ways that didn't necessarily map to the situation. Some characters were drawn a little campy/daytime drama, but casting was terrific.  I particularly loved the principal antagonists -- the Sonny & Cher of evildoers -- John Hannah and Lucy Lawless. Another standout was Peter Mensah.  He has a way of commanding every bit of light in the universe for his own purpose (and apparently that purpose was to make me short of breath). It's a real shame that Andy Whitfield couldn't take this role to the end. He smoldered in a way that was infinitely more authentic than Liam McIntyre's rendering. This replacement was along the lines of casting Timothy Dalton/Pierce Brosnan as 007. He's just too chiseled and perfect. Too pretty (only chicks can be both pretty and deadly).<br /><br />For that reason, I'd have to say 'Blood and Sand' and it's prequel 'Gods of the Arena' are perfect sword-n-sandal epics. Subsequent seasons are entertaining enough, but lack much of the passion, scheming and desperation of their predecessors.

I suggested it for a church outing and everyone enjoyed it for that same purpose, the sharing of a message in a narrative, creative way.<br />I purchased it at Amazon and showed it to a group of college students last Sunday. I had to start with the disclaimer: &#34;This is not a good movie. It is very slow. It is very talkie. BUT, it provides illustration for the topic we are now discussing.&#34; They enjoyed it for that purpose.

B00BEZTMWW|2.0|I've read all of Tolkien's Middle Earth books at least once and greatly enjoyed the Rings movies and audio books. I was looking forward to more of the same. But this isn't it. Much of the dialog, characters and scenes are not from Tolkien's The Hobbit, and they aren't nearly as good as what Tolkien wrote. The scenery, the sets and many of the costumes and actors are OK -- many are right out of the Lord of the Rings -- but they're not from The Hobbit and they don't all fit this story. And some of the most fascinating characters and scenes in Tolkien's The Hobbit are not in this movie at all! If you want a sword-and-sorcery adventure movie and aren't an avid Tolkien fan, you may like it. For me, I'll read the book again and pass on the second and third installments of this movie.

1419705849|4.0|Excellent satirical writing for a kid! Advanced humor so very good reading skills book but mainly just funny. I read this with my niece and we laugh our heads off! Good bonding stuff!
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|For the price you cannot go wrong with this lavalier mic.  I've used it twice now and it records above par (not amazing) audio that is very usable in 99% of situations.  The cord is insanely long so your subject can be nice and far from your camera if you have it directly plugged in.  The part that holds the battery and the components is made of metal which gives it a nice sturdy feel.  You can also buy a cable that will allow you to connect it to your iphone which makes a fantastic audio recorder.  The only thing I wish it had was a on-off/battery indicator but I might be asking for too much at this price point.

B00028HBKC|5.0|Passion of the Christ is a film which takes us on the journey<br />with Christ from a different perspective than those of many<br />of the previous films of the life of Christ. The Roman Empire<br />is more like the historic Rome we often read about. After watching<br />the film, I felt a stronger connection with the experience of Christ<br />in His ministry and His passion. A great film for Christians and<br />non-Christians who want to know more about Christ!

B004Q9TYWQ|4.0|This is more fun doled out in small doses.  Many are repetitious, but laugh-out-loud funny just for being surprising.  The Kindle version has many, many blank pages that were chapter endings or headings.  The book could be just a chapter in a book about smart phones.  Or an ongoing magazine article.

B003L7DK74|5.0|I'm a huge Flight of the Conchords fan. I typically don't like musical comedy but these guys speak my language. Whether watching the show or their stand up routine, the clever, awkward, silly caricatures of music, musicians, and people in general are spot on. Brett and Jemaine are masters of parody who use their musical talents to deliver their craft. FotC is simply brilliant.

B005K17RU0|1.0|I am still learning about my kindle fire but know I am doing fine and can get other programs to work.  This program just sits on the opening page or goes to another site i have been able to program but will not give the weather in that site either.  It does not give the weather, past or future and the maps will not enlarge.  If I am able, i am going to delete it and read the weather in my newspaper.  Do not bother downloading this app.

B000FA675C|5.0|Dan Brown is one of the most talented writers of our time.  I have read The Da Vinci Code: A Novel before, and purchased it for my Kindle because I will reread it.  It is cryptic, informative, and keeps you on the edge.  It was hard for me to put it down.  And, I loved the character of Robert Langdon.  His expertise is key.  That's why I look forward to more Robert Langdon novels.  I think that anyone who likes puzzles, would like this book. Connect the clues.

B0010SKUYM|4.0|I have never read a book as long as this, i have just finished reading the first chapter and i liked it alot. it seems an amazing fantasy world.. Well written and understandable unlike some fantasy books which are insanely difficult to follow... see example&#62;&#62; 'and cain lifted his almighty sword, and chopped off the head of his brother timzamim and fed it to his drug fueled cat fluffy iv of sigareth... ' this book isnt like that it actually seems to be pretty good so far im 2% of the way through and already there is alot of names to remember, so at the moment im gonna read something a little easier to follow! worth reading though it seems awesome and worth giving a try.

B007FEFLTO|4.0|Surrounding fictional characters with real events provides an engaging and more personal point of view of history.  You move beyond the broad antiseptic facts and think about those individuals intimately involved in events and imagine what you yourself might do if in the same situation.  The result is an interesting mix of enjoyment and education.
B004ZJZQ7O|5.0|Denzel does it again.  He is truly one of the best actors ever.  I've enjoyed every movie he has starred in. His character is so define.  He is able to capture every scene in this movie as a  real life gangsters.

0307887448|5.0|It's hard to imagine a book that is more fun than this one. It's like an odd-man-out video game, the most imaginative player-against-challenges adventure imaginable.<br /><br />In essence, this is the plot: Wade Watts lives in near-poverty in the drab and rundown world of 2044. Our fecklessness and abuse of nature has left our descendants short of resources of all kinds. The only bright spot in this future world is OASIS, a virtual universe of  innumerable habitats created initially by a hermit-like gamer nerd, James Halliday, who when he dies, has left a challenge for everyone who uses OASIS. (That means almost everyone. It costs virtually nothing to gain access to OASIS, and the real world is so harsh, so everyone flocks there. Wade even attends school on an OASIS world.) In his last will and testament, broadcast across this virtual universe, Halliday bequeaths his colossal fortune, and ownership of OASIS, to the gamester who solves three challenges (they turn out to involve playing and winning three classic videogames), find three `keys' (the keys lead the player to the next clue) and, at the end, find and open Halliday's \\"Easter Egg\\" (in which the prize, his inheritance, is hidden).<br /><br />Here is the message Halliday posted as the first clue. It's appropriately Dungeons and Dragons-ish:<br /><br />Three hidden keys open three secret gates<br />Wherein the errant will be tested for worthy traits<br />And those with the skill to survive these straits<br />Will reach The End where the prize waits<br /><br />Wade has read everything Halliday wrote, played all the games he played until he has mastered most of them, and he has immersed himself in the pop culture of movies, songs, TV shows, and fantasy and sci fi books Halliday adored. But Wade's dirt poor. He's never been able to earn enough credits when gaming on OASIS worlds to buy himself the serious powers and weapons he will need to embark on a major Quest like this one. Then Wade cracks the first challenge. He's the first gamester to succeed. (They call themselves \\"gunters,\\" truncated from \\"egg hunters.\\") He finds the first key, solves the first riddle. In the process he acquires both (virtual) wealth and fame. Soon he is in a life and death struggle with tens of thousands of other gunters, all of whom want the prize that lies at the end of the rainbow. Not all of them are as ethical as Wade. The worst are the Sixers, thousands of gamesters who have signed on with the giant corporation, IOI. IOI's goal is to commercialize OASIS completely: inheriting Halliday's fortune includes half of the voting stock in Gregarious Games, the parent corporation for OASIS. (After Hallidays' message goes viral, IOI creates an \\"Oology Division\\" -\\"oology\\" being originally defined as \\"the science of studying birds' eggs.)<br /><br />Along the way, Wade acquires friends, four loner gunters who cooperate sometimes, compete at others. One of them is a girl, Art3mis.  At least he thinks she's a girl -he's never met her in the flesh, only her avatar. He has a crush on her. The Sixers up the stakes. Tensions hype. It ends gloriously.<br /><br />I said it before and I'll say it again -this book is so much fun. You don't have to like gaming to enjoy it though it helps. How a book can be at once so hip and so nerdy, I don't know. The tech talk is great, the cultural references, mostly to the 70s and 80s, are cool, the action is non-stop, and Wade is likeable, sympathetic and a good, though unusual, action hero.  I have nothing -absolutely nothing- negative to say about this book. It's mega-Cool.He's the first gamester to succeed.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen Hoover won me over with her Slammed series so there was really no doubt I would read Hopeless or anything else that she writes. I should have read this the day it came out, but I kept putting it off. Now I finished it in one day and I can't stop thinking about it even though it's the next day. This book was extremely powerful and intense and amazing. I loved Sky the minute that she was introduced even in the intense prologue that totally gave me the wrong impression on where the drama and angst was going to come from in this book. In fact, most of the drama in the first half of the book lead me in a direction that I thought was a little typical, but I didn't care because I loved the characters.<br /><br />Then wham, Colleen blindsided me with a Mack truck. Sure there were signs everywhere now that I think about it and once I realized what was going on I was able to figure little things out, but holy crap, I didn't see it coming at all. This book is filled with so many deep, dark, heartbreaking moments and some subject matters that I've never read about before, but that were handled so extremely well by Colleen. Even with those moments, this book was filled with some amazing, fun, heartwarmingly beautiful moments too. Dean Holder has been added to my book boyfriend list. Even with his rumored reputation in the beginning, I still didn't think that he could be what they said he was. There was just something magical about him from the very start, even if he had a temper.<br /><br />And if the heartbreaking and heartwarming moments weren't enough, this book has one of the hottest scenes I've read in a very long time and I read a lot of smut. Holder and Sky's first kiss/not kiss was scorching from either point of view (see Colleen Hoover's website for the scene from Holder's POV) and it was a scene I was thankful for later on in the book when we delved into so much despair.<br /><br />I absolutely loved this book and I will absolutely reread it and recommend the crap out of it. I think everyone should read this book and I am more than looking forward to Losing Hope so that I can read this all from Holder's POV. I usually do not care much for the same story from another POV, but there are so many little things in this book and big things in this book that only Holder can show us. Is it July 9th yet?

B000O8OTNC|4.0|A nice multi-purpose sharpener. It is smaller and lighter weight than the Lansky version of this tool, making it a little nicer for backpacking needs. Being about three quarters of an inch shorter, the Smith sharpener, doesn't fit the hand quite as well as the Lansky and a little more care is needed when using it.<br /><br />Materials seem of good quality and the design is nice and compact.
B0064MGU98|5.0|The actors don't shortchange us.  The stories are realistic and compelling.  Margulies in unbelievably likeable.  It's got everything you could want in entertainment:  courtroom scenes, sex, glamorously good make-up and clothing, political impositions into daily life... What more can you ask?<br /><br />The cast is amazing.  Attractive and likeable.  Sympathetic.

B004J4WKTW|4.0|The author's eye-opening imagination is somewhat undermined by her unwillingness to commit to explanatory details about the hundred of phenomena she dishes up for her readers' consumption at this buffet of the unbelievable. Still, the love story fuels interest like the glow of the bonfire at the center of the circus, and the young infatuation between Bailey and Poppet is sweetly conceived.  A beautiful diversion of a read.

0345529057|5.0|I had to struggle through the first 100 pages of book one but then couldn't put them down. Read 1-4 in 2wks. My wife said she missed me.  I read a lot, and was shocked when main characters were getting killed mid-paragraph, out of the blue.  Very exciting. Cool writting style with chapters labled by character. book 5 good so far--had to buy it also.  Book 6 and 7 possible in Nov 2013?????

B002HWRYJE|4.0|It's not really a Star Trek movie.  That's why it doesn't suck.  That is, it's not a traditional Star Trek movie that assumes an interest in and familiarity w Star Trek TOS or NextGen.  Those movies were fanboy movies with hammy acting and low budget fx.  This is geared more toward a general audience that might be curious but doesn't go to ST conventions wearing Vulcan ears.  This is a plot lite action and special effects movie w Star TOS characters and many other ST signifiers.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was a compelling story that did not follow the usual sci-fi formula.  The author did a good job of fleshing out the characters so that you actually cared what happened to them.

076421120X|5.0|Revealing Jesus: A 365-Day Devotional<br />By worship leader Darlene Zschech<br />From the Back Cover:  \\"Do you long for more of God's presence? Do you ache to see Him at work in your life? Do you desire His peace and rest? Renowned worship leader Darlene Zschech invites you to gather with her around the Word of God. Born out of her own yearnings that she poured onto the pages of journals, these meditations and Scriptures reveal Jesus and speak of His finished work--how He tenderly cares for you and wants you to know Him.  Honest, raw, and beautifully written, these devotions will inspire your journey and encourage you in every season. Come, sit at the feet of our Lord, be strengthened in your weakness, embrace His love for you, and breathe in His peace.\\"<br />I have enjoyed reading the devotional this month.  It has lots of great scriptures with fresh insights to challenge the heart and mind.  You can hear Darlene's passion and love for Christ as she writes.  She is humble, powerful and challenging with her concise words.<br />The book is visually appealing and easy to read.<br />I would recommend this book for any woman who wants to grow in her walk with Christ.<br />I received this book for free in exchange for my honest comments and opinions.

B000002UUY|5.0|Pretty much it, this album kicks ass from start to finish. The original sounds so much better than the remastered. You can definetly tell in the production wise, the Drums are so much more raw, and Dave's voice sounds so much better on the original.
159514188X|5.0|all kids from junior high and up  should read this book, hard to lay down. I did not like the ending my grand it wouldn't hurt parents to read,

B00003CXBH|4.0|It is a good inspirational story. Based on historical information, it reveals the efforts Spanish and Portugese efforts to colonize the Americas. The story unfolds the good a nod bad of a place and people torn between spiritual missionary efforts and ungodly slavery for profit.  A younger Liam Neeson also shows up with well known DeNiro and Jeremy Irons. Some scenes could have shortened but we must remember this film came at a time when big cinematic productions were making the rounds.  It's a good 'watch.'
B006LSZECO|1.0|I've read all of Gillian Flynn's books - this being the last one i had to read. Let me say i loved the other two. This one... Come on!!! The entire first 60% of the book was GREAT! - I loved the story but then it seems like she just didnt know what to do with the ending to make it as significant as the rest of the novel.I got this as a digital library loan and i am SO glad i di - i didnt have to waste my money or ask for it back- now if i could just get back the time I wasted on this garbage.<br />Next time...Try harder Ms. Flynn... Much, Much harder.
0345529057|5.0|Come on, do you really need a review to tell you to hurry up and get these books? Game of Thrones is a great series so far, this is a great set to buy to catch up to the current publications! If you've seen the HBO series, these books will deepen your understanding and enjoyment of the first two seasons and leave you salivating for season 3...welcome to your newest obsession.
B000002TPT|5.0|This album has some raw feel to it because of the tone they decided to record the album with. Check out there making of this album on VHS  if you want to see some cool behind the scenes stuff! Not one bad track on this or any Deth albums! Family Tree Reckoning Day, Train Of Consequences, just to name a few that really stand out on the album. And  A tout Le Mode, I got to stop now or else ill name all the songs haha, enjoy the album! Originals are always more raw For Megadeth records.
B0094K1MH2|1.0|Dumbest movie ever, would definately not recommend it not even for kids.  Repetitive and slow didn't even finish watching it
B00992CF6W|5.0|Fun awesome cool I play it. all the time my sister hates.  it but I love it Defenintly Five star
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|I love basically every song on this album.  Great music, beautiful harmonies, and creative songs.  I was so excited to hear that Justin would be singing again and this album did not disappoint.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I really enjoy Mahjong and enjoyed this game along with Mahjong II.  It provides hours of fun when I just want to chill out.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|I couldn't get into it but I'm not a history buff. I watched the first half hour then turned it off.
B004JQN364|5.0|My step-son specifically asked for Papo products and this was one of many we purchased for him for Christmas.  Loves it!
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|I love these combo packages.  This is great movie, and a great deal.  It's a great video for kids and adults, and the combo pack offers the option of watching it anywhere, anytime.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|I have not played this game, but my grandson loves it.  He asked me to download it and now every time he comes to visit my Kindle is not mine to use until he goes home.  He loves it!!
B008FPOIT6|4.0|I thoug it was a great story. Get for anyone in their twenties who want some light reading material.<br /><br />I read it while commuting each day and finished in a week.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I loved this book! I couldn't put it down. I laughed and cried my eyes out. A very moving story. I would recommend this book to all who love a  love story. It's a (make you feel good)book. Definitely!!! I wish my husband would write some poetry for me! I hope there will be more than two books in this series. I could read forever with this story. A very touching story !!
B00BF11STU|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I think it was very informative and the so called 'graphic' parts didn't bother me... maybe I've watched enough of these types of movies. Or just don't feel bad for terrorists...<br />Loved the movie!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|OMG!  This is so addictive.  I play this all of the time.  It's something you can stop in the middle of if you are interrupted and then get back into later...highly recommend this problem solver app.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|There is really nothing special in what it can do, but it is a fast and easy calculator for the kindle.
B00BBQXUYK|5.0|I could watch this over and over with my kids. It is downloaded to my Kindle Fire and can be watched on trips. It is a wonderful movie! LOVE LOVE LOVED IT
B001O8D47S|5.0|I haven't seen the musical so, judged without holding it up to that standard, it was fresh, funny and unique. Definitely a \\"chick flick\\" but not overly romantic or sappy. I would call it a relationship-comedy since it is based much more on close friendships than romance.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|Sad to say, this series is done after 5 seasons.  It has been enjoyable, engaging and entertaining. I especially like Colin Morgan.  Hope to see him in more British productions.
B000FCK8ZK|5.0|It is funny and sardonic, containing the musings of an emotional cripple who tries to do, sort of, the right thing.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Got hooked on this on FaceBook.  Excited it is now an app for Kindle Fire! This is really a fun game for those who like Bingo!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|this game is hard enough to be fun and still easy enough for the kids to play.  Great graphics too!
0060581808|5.0|This book is beautiful.  The pages are thick and shiny.  Full color drawings are fun for the kids, and my four and six year old are very into the story.  Extremely pleased with such a nice book at a very reasonable price!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I've been a fan for a few years since Tennants second season and went back to watch and buy this season.  Enjoyable, you have to love sci-fi.  I do!
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Have problems finding the exact weather info I am looking for, but it will do and will continue trying it
B00BU2SIW4|3.0|I expected more. Then again I'm sure it's tough to top sounds of the universe. A few good songs on this album but falls short in my opinion.
B0035JLVWY|4.0|Entertaining and yet it could happen and probably does.  The acting was excellent, something that is lacking in a lot of movies these days.
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|I had been wanting to purchase this album so when I saw if for under 10 dollars I got it.<br />Blake has a way of telling a story through his music....
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This is the first relationship type book I've ever read like this. After going through a divorce last year and now trying to date again, this book has really opened my eyes about my love language. I now know what it will take to meet my emotional needs...and avoid another divorce!!!
B008M36EEI|5.0|I say that because I'll watch anything with Ewan McGregor but have been surprised in some movies and could not finish them.<br /><br />This is very well written and tells a good story.  Enjoy, not overly mushy or sentimental.
B00A83075M|5.0|it iwas so funny my grandkids watch it ovr and over and I enjoyed it as well, great to buy
B00821PCJS|3.0|OK, it could be worse.  It could be zombies.  It could be better...it could have actors that have some real experience in front of a camera and have enough time to really get into their roles...but it's a tv series and they don't have the time or money for that.  So.  So you get a pretty well put together plot/narrative with some decent special effects that sort of takes the whole &#34;War of the Worlds&#34; motif and expands it out over the course of a couple weeks worth of watching.  Not so bad.  You will find no surprises here...and you probably won't be terribly disappointed...but you probably won't go running out to tell all your friends about it either.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am a huge fan of the show. Can't wait for season 4 and beyond. Thanks for having this available.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|We just love the game, my kids said it's more challenging and  there another page to come soon so they're very excited.
B008JFUO0Y|4.0|It's hard to get excited for a film remake, and damn near offensive when the title in question is a cultural touchstone. The horror genre is particularly unscrupulous on the subject, seemingly bent on churning out a revamp of every movie remotely successful in the past few decades. So when news of an Evil Dead remake began to leak, the reaction was largely a sigh of resignation.<br /><br />Sam Raimi's Evil Dead trilogy is the archetype of b-rate cult classic horror filmmaking. The first movie cost a mere $375,000 to make, and what it lacks in big budget special effects it more than makes up for with DIY charm and the kind of ingenuity a shoestring budget necessitates. But it can be easy to forget that the films' cult following was mostly generated by Evil Dead 2, which is, in essence, a remake of the original with a higher budget and an overflow of macabre slapstick.<br /><br />First time Director Fede Alvarez's Evil Dead pulls off a wonderful balance of homage to the original while creating a gratuitously violent gorefest all his own. The premise is similar and equally simple. Five attractive young people head to a secluded cabin in the woods in an effort to help their friend Mia (Jane Levy) kick her heroin habit. Shortly after arriving, they find a copy of The Book Of The Dead in a basement that would have sent most people running back to civilization. In one of a series of increasingly poor decisions, the book is read from, the classic camera shot comes zooming through the forest, and a fight to survive demonic possession ensues.<br /><br />The film has been billed as, \\"The most terrifying movie you'll ever experience;\\" harkening back to the hyperbolic taglines of seventies classic schlock. While the statement isn't necessarily true, the film is definitely scary, and gleefully excessive in the blood and gore departments. But unlike your garden variety Saw or Hostel franchises, the violence of Evil Dead reaches hysterical, almost cartoonish proportions.<br /><br />Whether or not this movie lives up to the original trilogy is irrelevant. It's head and shoulders above most contemporary horror movies; not because of some clever plotting or innovation, but because it has plenty of well choreographed scares and has a hell of a lot of ghastly fun in the process. It may not have Bruce Campbell, but there's plenty of raining blood, chainsaws and demons. What more could you really want?>Whether or not this movie lives up to the original trilogy is irrelevant.

B007KYQIEQ|5.0|I'm not a big Meg Ryan fan but can handle her in this movie.  I do enjoy the actor who plays her brother, bought it when it went on sale with Amazon.
B008393Q2O|5.0|i love this app,very customizable,is fun to use,there are other apps out there but like i said this is new and refreshing.you must give it a spin.
B00BLGZDYA|3.0|I know that this is one of those &#34;Art pieces&#34; that isn't supposed to garner a whole lot of mass appreciation...a sort of underground film noir that hopes for a niche audience and a cult following of uber hip artist types that will view it enough to help pay for it's production...but talking cars?  I will say this though...some of the images shot in this will stay with you.  Had I had even a passing sense of empathy for ANY of the characters by midway through this I would have given it 4 stars...but I didn't.  Could be that it was the language...it's difficult to relate to the tone of a voice when you're reading the script...but the lives of the characters are so buried by the roles that they are creating on film that it's difficult to find a way to relate.  I suppose that's probably what gives it some kind of appeal...but it left me detached and I like to LIKE my films not &#34;appreciate&#34; them.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I am a huge fan of the show. Can't wait for season 4 and beyond. Thanks for having this available.
1401900526|5.0|I absolutely LOVE these cards!  I use them everyday...  and I actually have a friend who texts me a number everyday, and I take a picture of her corresponding card and send it to her!  Great way to start the day :)
B008YU0AOE|5.0|This app is extremely easy to use.  It also has a scientific side to it if you turn it side ways.  Best of all, it is free.
B007MAETA8|5.0|Seems he might be getting a perspective on life and heading towards a better direction.  I hope he finds what he needs to be happy not what he thinks he needs in life.  He has to remember what he has said is important to him and find how it fits his current lifestyle.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|I love all the tracks on this CD.  Andrea has done an outstanding job on this one.  Will be one of my favorites.  He has such an amazing voice, it doesn't matter if I understand the words or not, I just love to hear him sing.  Enjoyed his duet with Jennifer Lopez on Dancing With The Stars.  Also enjoyed the PBS special featuring songs from this CD performed in Portofino.
B0018OIK0E|5.0|The ONLY zombie movie worth watching.  I've watched this 3 times already and will probably watch it again.  How they worked in pathos, humor, satire and romance into a film about the living dead is beyond me...but there it is.  Shaun of the dead.  Watch it.
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|It says that it can use the camera and take videos along with the pictures but I downloaded it because I've really wanted to be able to make videos and it didn't work so don't buy it, it's not worth it.
B000FA675C|5.0|I loved this.  Granted I love Angels and Demons more, but this was a great book.  It captivated me and could not put it down.  I read all of his books and love just about all of them.
0385349947|5.0|Sheryl Sandberg is in a unique place to write this \\"sort of feminist manifesto.\\" She's the Chief Operating Officer at Facebook.<br /><br />This book tells her story of climbing the corporate ladder as a woman and the internal and external barriers she's had to overcome.<br /><br />One of her main points is that often women don't get the recognition and promotions they're qualified for - through their character and competence - because they fail to claim them.<br /><br />An example she offers is when Mark Zuckerberg was hiring her. She planned to accept the large amount he offered. Her husband challenged her to negotiate.<br /><br />Sandberg's a high achiever who has kept her humanity. Instead of being a superwoman who manages to keep all the balls in the air, she's tackled the issues any working woman faces: having children, keeping her relationship with her partner great, dealing with colleagues who are only used to men having power, and making time to recharge.<br /><br />While she's pushing women to succeed in top-level corporate positions, Sandberg believes women need to work with men to create gender equality.<br /><br />Any woman committed to rising to the top levels in business must read this book. You'll be inspired and challenged.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|I can watch Donna Noble over and over.  I love that in this season the companion is not lovey dovey with the doctor.  She keeps him in line.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|The Draw Something app is a fun game and I enjoy playing with other users. However; the support features are poor and there does not seem to be a way to contact OMGPOP if a problem arises. In my case, the game froze and after hours of watching a crayon rotate on a screen I tried for help from the OMGPOP web site. There was no information there. So I attempted the uninstall and reinstall approach for the app.<br /><br />When I reinstalled the app I went through the process of re-entering my ID to resume my games. In the process I kept getting \\"wrong password\\" messages when I entered the password for my e-mail address. So I used the \\"forgot password\\" feature where I got a message that my password was sent to my e-mail account. But it never got to my e-mail account. I did this several times and got the same response but no e-mail message?! So I went back to the OMGPOP site and tried to send an e-mail to their listed \\"contact us\\" address. That bounced as undeliverable from the internet postmaster?!<br /><br />Out of frustration I started a new Draw Something ID account with a different e-mail address. This time I did receive and e-mail with my password which is something I did not receive when I started my original account. For curiosity I started a game with my old ID. That game was accepted and is now in the in bin for that old ID but will die there as I cannot activate that old ID because I cannot contact OMGPOP to obtain that ID's password.<br /><br />Not the end of the world, but very frustrating. I would never pay for any product or service from OMGPOP as it is impossible to contact them through the tools they have provided. The game is fun but the support just isn't there when a problem occurs.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Supernatural is one of my most favorite shows on tv.  I never get tired  of watching it, watch the reruns all the time.  Just started watching Season 8 and was not disappointed with it at all.  Have loved Season 8 just as much as the other seasons.
B0087HT36U|4.0|the only problom in this game is that I have to rate it and it is hard to play when you have to
0385349947|5.0|This was a present for my daughter who is a Manager. She said she couldn't put it down. It has helped her no end!
B00B5P37IG|1.0|What a rip off all junk channels and if you try to watch one it just crashes on the kindle fire HD 7 want my money back! Amazon you should remove this junk from your store
B007W1BLN0|3.0|Started off interesting but did not catch my curiousity to finish the movie.  You should give it a try though
B006RXQ3GO|5.0|Since I can't find pretty woman in stores I think I will have to buy it off of amazon... I'm in love with this movie... it makes you laugh, might even make you cry but I would give it 10 stars if it had 10... that's just me though
B0049J2BSM|5.0|Just fantastic.  Lot's of new animations have come out since but this movie still tops my list of favorites. Wazowski!
6305428425|5.0|I bought this for my daughter to give her best friend at her bridal shower. It has special memories for the two of them. It is and always will be one of the funniest movies to watch.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Very informative on some aspect of slavery I was not aware of.<br />Good read.  It ended a bit abruptly, but enjoyable nonetheless
B002PEP4C8|5.0|It was hard to put down this book once I started reading.  Alice Seybold is a great writer of fiction, but it had to be difficult to write her personal experience as if she were telling someone else's story.  I felt her personal struggle following her rape and for years down the road.  She is to be commended for documenting everything that happened to her in such detail.  I was amazed that at times she wasn't treated as the victim of a horrible crime by law enforcement.  This is truly one of the best stories I have read in a long time.
B0076DELIG|3.0|Probably the weakest of his Harry Bosch novels, (I've read them all now.) THE BLACK BOX still remains<br />a Good Read.  Maybe Harry was just having a &#34;bad hair day.&#34;
B009YP9L7U|4.0|3.5 Stars<br /><br />This was a fun, quick read. I haven't read a Harlequin in many, many years and this was a pleasant change from the last one I read that's for sure.<br /><br />I liked the characters, liked the plot. Yes, it's predictable but this was a nice take on it. I liked the drunk text messages and the humor.<br /><br />There were a few instances in the book where there were over the top, superfluous descriptions of the situation, but nothing too bad.
B0094M2ODQ|5.0|Love this movie!  One if my favorite Barbara movies an very under-rated.  If you like just plain like being entertained...this is the movie to watch!  Oh and I not it has Hollywood legend Lauren Bacall.
B00AP9RQE4|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyable! I loved getting to see things from Ivan's perspective and hope that there are more things to come!.  Looking forward to more stories from Bujold!
B009IEXKXI|4.0|I got this book because it was $.99 and I needed something to read while working out.  I seldom laugh while reading a book, but this one had me going time and time again.  ( . Y . )  ... Yup.  If you read the book you'll know what I mean.  If you're not a scientist or engineer you may get completely bored with the extremely detailed thought process that goes into just about every movement the main character makes.  But it is an enjoyable book nonetheless.  Give it a shot...what's $.99?
B008XKT9FG|4.0|It was An enjoyable movie. The plot was revealed in an interesting way. Helen Hunt had been off my radar for a long time. Good to see her again.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|If I didn't feel invested enough from watching the first two seasons, I would have bailed on this. The plot got sillier as the season went on and they spent way too much time on new characters that had little or no redeeming value. I doubt I'll stick around another season unless it really picks up.
B0011Z51T8|5.0|Jack and Meg rock.  They get it.  Real playing, not techno trickery, honest clever lyrics paired with great guitars and drums
B005IQZB14|5.0|I read this for a book club and found it enjoyable.  The women in our group that had some camping and/or backpacking experience seemed to enjoy it the most.  We had a good conversation that also included members personal experiences that paralleled Cheryl Strayed's, as well as followed some of the study guide questions.  The book seemed to have a bit of everything; suspense, danger, love, death, beauty, sex, insight, and friendship.  It also had a definite beginning and end, which was satisfying to me. It was a quick read that held my interest.  Being in my 60's it  brought back memories of several backpacking trips I made in my 20's.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love subway surfers its just my game and its very fun you can buy multiple things collect alot i mean alot of money get new people and boards it  just fun!!!
B008CPRLP2|5.0|Have been a longtime user of WinZip since the days when it was owned by Nico Mak Computing and released in the early 1990s as a GUI front-end for PKZIP, so it was good to find it here.<br /><br />The [[ASIN:B008CPRLP2 WinZip]] app for Android devices does an excellent job of allowing you to view a wide range of supported image, text and Web files directly within the app itself. It will automatically unzip and install Android apps (.apk files) delivered as .zip files from the Amazon Appstore here, and does it quickly and efficiently. Once installed, you can view photos and images in the .JPG, .PNG, BMP, .GIF and other formats (check the list). You can also view most text and Web (.HTML) files, and it's also excellent with files from Microsoft Office. It does well with Adobe .PDF files as well.<br /><br />This app is only 1.1MB in its 1.0.1 version (current at the time of this review) and will take less than 30 seconds to download to your device. Be aware that you should be running at least Android 2.1 on your device. I've tested it on my original Kindle Fire, Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\" and on my Samsung Galaxy S III, and it works perfectly on these devices.<br /><br />I use [[ASIN:B009RG41HQ WinZip 17 Standard]] on my PC, and have used it to compress files to the cloud on online file sharing services like Dropbox, Google Drive and SkyDrive. In most cases it works perfectly, but be aware that it will not work with compressed files in the .RAR format.<br /><br />This [[ASIN:B008CPRLP2 WinZip]] app is a good one for a variety of file formats, especially if you're storing them to one of the cloud services, but be sure to check the formats supported so that you won't be disappointed. It's an excellent freebie that lives up to what's expected.<br /><br />4/12/2013
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I love the record feature. One main reason I can't give up my DVR is because I can replay something someone said...same goes for this record feature. All radio should have this feature. Also with the vast selection of radio stations, who needs satellite radio....I just connect my phone and my long drives are relaxing, interesting and fun!
1616550414|5.0|My sons are both Legend of Zelda fans.  They both enjoyed this book.  It is something that only a true Zelda fan will appreciate, though.
B004GYY714|5.0|I can get all the stations I enjoy, music, and news. You can also get stations from other counties that you cant get on regular radios.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Love the story line.  cannot wait to see i performed live in a theatre.  shipper was great, fast and smooth.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|It was a good book but had too much sex and drugs for my liking. The message was good though.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Discovered this series while in my &#34;post Abbey&#34; funk and it is absolutely beautiful.  The characters are beautifully drawn and the cast is fantastic--including &#34;Mr. Bates&#34;!!!!  This has become my new &#34;must watch&#34; show and there are lots more episodes to enjoy!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I am a bit of a Tech Weenie, so when I finally got my Kindle Fire I was vaguely dissapointed at the simplicity and limitations of the user interface.  I immediately set off to find some applications that would help me put the Fire to purposes beyond just reading books and listening to music.  ES File Explorer, combined with another office-type product which I will not identify here, but allows me to use standard office documents, has allowed me to make the Kindle a true productivity tool.  ES File Explorer has a huge number of features, many of which I do not use, so I will simply highlight some that I find most useful.  The ability to browse through the entire file system is great.  ES File Explorer also has an image viewer so you can peruse pictures on your device and even run a slide show.  ES File allows the user to hide folders and files, or even encrypt folders and files into a zipped file with password protection.  ES File Explorer has system management functions too, that allow the user to see what Apps are running and what memory usage is allocated to by several categories.  You can also set it up so that you have to enter a password just to access the ES File Explorer.  I will say that ES File Explorer is not really designed for the non-technical type, and some of the functions are not necessarily intuitive and take some practice to start using effectively, but I highly recommend ES File Explorer for those who enjoy exploring and tweaking their devices, and especially for those who, like me, find the out-of-the box Kindle Fire just a little too simplistic.
034580404X|5.0|I ordered this because a bunch of my friends read the series. I really got into the story and read the whole series in a few weeks.
B008HK3XYK|4.0|Great case and the tablet stands up very well. Its a perfect fit for the tablet, and the strap holds it closed perfectly.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|My family and I saw this movie in theaters and we all loved it so we decided to add it to our continuously growing home collection!
B000JMLFLW|3.0|This book is ok, especially for an older book. Can't say I was blown away with it, but I did read the whole thing!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I thought the book was great, but man, was I depressed after reading it. If being great required me to be like Steven Jobs in all respects, then I am delighted to stay the way I am.
B008XG1X18|3.0|It brings you directly to your Pinterest pages, but I struggle with usability aspects, such as editing your own profile identifying your categories of information.  Honestly, some of these difficulties may actually be the Pinterest social network site's fault and not entirely due to the Pinterest App, but I do find it a little easier to simply use a browser app and use the Pinterest features that way.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I am new to the kindle, and I found this game very easy to use.  It's very quick with response.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|it a great game. I love it. I love games like this. it that had it on playstatione 3. I would bye it.
B002UNMW7O|4.0|This Move was not as good as the first, could have done without the female agent.  Wanting them to make  a 3rd movie!
B002RKS81O|3.0|Another older book, was easy to read, but not one I will ever read again! Just my personal opinion! Good writing though
B00B3EVNEE|5.0|If you love the guitar work of Robin Trower, You will be thrilled with his this release. The covers are extremely well done and complimented by his style of playing. The originals are pretty simply written lyrics wise, but the guitar playing shines through. Every time I hear Robin I hear echoes of Jimi in tone and style, this album is no exception.
B007MJT1K2|4.0|Great story with superb animation and voice acting. Was never a big fan of the comic strip but I really enjoyed this movie! Andy Serkus (Yes he's the voice of Gollum) was spot on as the hard drinking captain. And Daniel Craig made a convincing villain with is voicing of the antagonist Saccharin. Of course Tintin and Snowy are the stars of the show and I was surprised how much I cared about them and their quest, having very little regard for their comic strip counterparts.  Highly recommend this movie, it's one of Steven Spielberg's better efforts of late. I'm thirsty for the next adventure!
B00C32R64G|3.0|Not sure how to explain it..but something was missing from this album... I have listened and own every album volbeat has created and for some reason 3 songs on this album I seem to love....and the rest are ...ok.. GREAT Talent Volbeat has...but this album was sort of a let down for me...not sure what it was about the album....but yea...not what i really hoped for
B0013KTGAG|5.0|Essential science fiction movie. A thinking man's movie. Not a mainstream Hollywood mindless moron's movie. Get it. Watch it. Love it.
B000FA675C|2.0|...but Mr. Brown ought to have done some research first.<br /><br />I hadn't got very far before I encountered a postage-stamp sized GPS tracker capable of giving it's position within two feet, working inside a building that was so full of electronics that cell phones couldnt' get a signal.<br /><br />Sorry, but that sort of laziness to drive a plot is to me unreadable.

I'm a fan of the Game of Thrones series, the Passage series, the Dark Tower series, and many other Sci-fi/Fantasy fiction.  Just to give you and idea of what I like.  If you like Fantasy, you will probably like The Way of Kings.

B00BKEMX28|4.0|This album has Trent Reznor all over it, but it's not NIN.  I really like it, but most of the best songs were already release on the HTDA extended play.  Still, a must have for those who follow TR's musical genius.

1476733953|5.0|One way to measure a good book is by how much sleep and work time is sacrificed for reading it.  As for measuring 'Wool' by this standard, let's just say I'm tired and I haven't accomplished much recently.<br /><br />Years ago I read a book by Peter F. Hamilton called 'The Reality Dysfunction'.  It was so good that it made me a bit angry because his work, writing, and imagination was of such a caliber as to make all of the stories from Asimov, Clarke, and Heinlein seem a bit pale in comparison.  Mr. Howey's book easily stands with theirs.
B004L0NGEC|5.0|It's nice to have access to all my pics on the cloud on my Kindle.  Great subject matter for my art.
B00AO686MY|5.0|This is a great movie!!  It is from a bygone era where you could find animation mixed with live acting, and it is done at its best.  It is great seeing Disney and Warner bros characters interacting on the screen and I would highly recommend it.

B001UGB1X8|5.0|TLJ is great as Robicheaux. Followed the book pretty well and I only wish Burke would let TLJ do a lot of his moves -- particularly ones with Purcell. Casting for that would be fun.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My kids have this on their Ipod's and play it all the time. The effects are better and the game is a good time passer. Try it.

B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Easy to play fun and very addictive. Nothing like coming home from a tough day at work and wrecking shop with your shark! Great way to relax and unwind.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I read this book in a couple of days. I found it very difficult to put down. The story ran fluid from one part to the next and was so easily comprehended that it should be a good book for children yet interesting enough to keep adults turning pages.

B000FCKC4C|3.0|This is one of those books where the meaning or lesson they are trying to convey to you is expressly written out.  To me, books that are so explicit in spelling out the lesson are one step away from selling coffee mugs with quotes on them.  I prefer books that give credit to their readers and allow them to derive the lesson from a well written, more complex story.<br /><br />That being said, I took a few nuggets away from this book, so I count it as a win that wasn't a waste of time.

B0076DELIG|5.0|Another great Harry Bosch novel by Michael Connelly.  Connelly writes as if he were in a squad room. This is one series that is definitely worth reading if you have not already read them.
0425166805|5.0|I read this book as a kid, but, I wanted to become reacquainted with it as a grown-up.  I was almost done reading it, when an Egyptian dude in a space suit took it from me.  Damn.<br /><br />(Otherwise, really - great book).
B0074MZSWW|5.0|My daughter told me about this album....said that the lead singer reminded her of Janis Joplin, so I thought I would try it.  Quite frankly the lead singer of Alabama Shakes sounds much better than Janis ever did....and the band is  just incredible together.  I highly recommend this album to anyone who loves rock n roll or blues!  Great!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is so much fun. I have had no problems with it. I don't understand why they call it 101 games if it is plus 31.
B0012HEB32|5.0|Fun show where the second movie left off!<br />Fans liked it and it got good reviews so they canceled it?<br />Fox put on Dollhouse instead?????<br />Watch seasons 1 and 2 of the chronicles and you will have fun and think of a possible different outcome for the terminator.
B0038P59A0|3.0|not as good as the next one. the next movie was certainly more entertaining.  more action and better chemistry between the stars
1609611543|3.0|I have been intrigued by the effect of gluten and wheat on health for quite awhile.  My husband has a definite gluten sensitivity, and I am a carb addict who adores all types of breads and pasta, but noticed that whenever I would eat them, I would feel bloated and noticeably retain water.  In my all my research online, this book was recommended as a must read, so I finally ordered it.<br /><br />I must say, I was disappointed with this book.  The case studies and histories were at first interesting, but began to get repetitive as the chapters went on.  I really found much more extensive and helpful information online for free than I did reading this book.  And the claims that going wheat free will cure serious psychological disorders are a little dubious.<br /><br />That being said, the general concept that wheat avoidance may lead to better health is sound.  My husband and I have been avoiding wheat for about two months now.  We both noticed an immediate, very noticeable difference in my level of hunger.  Whenever we do eat wheat (whether by accident or purposely), we are ravenously hungry all day long and bloat up almost instantaneously.  He is more sensitive than I - when he eats wheat now his joints hurt and he can feel a major difference in his body.  He was just so used to feeling bad all the time, he didn't know any different - until he was off wheat and feeling much better.  Now when he eats wheat, he gets really sick and feels awful.  I don't get sick, I just get uncomfortably bloated (and very hungry).<br /><br />The reason I say this is a bit extreme is because of the banned list of foods.  Both of us have absolutely no problem with rice products (which are on the rare list).  So rice noodles and the like (from Trader Joe's) have been a wonderful substitute.  Also, I don't think fruit is something that is bad for you.  I just think people are setting themselves up for massive failure if they think they can adhere to the strict Wheat Belly diet of only veggies, nuts, oils, meat, cheese and eggs for the rest of their lives.  Obviously, avoiding highly processed foods is a good idea for most everyone.  Eating more veggies is great.  But you need to experiment and see what works for you and what doesn't (why severely restrict yourself from a particular food if it causes you no benefit to do so).  Everyone is different and there is no one size fits all nutrition plan.  The wheat free movement can be a step in figuring out what's right for you.

B00BCMT4RA|5.0|In a career that stretched more than forty years, blues guitarist and singer Albert King waxed a lot of fine material, but none finer than this 1967 collection for Stax. \\"Collection,\\" rather than \\"album,\\" as this set was the culmination of a number of individual sessions that had previously been released as singles. So while there wasn't a tight set of dates focused on recording a long player, there are several elements that turned the singles into a coherent statement. First was the combination of King, Booker T & The MGs, the Memphis Horns and the Stax studio. The deep southern grooves of the MGs provided King the perfect bed upon which to lay his intense guitar work, and the horn section added both atmosphere and sizzle. A final session netted five of the album's tracks, and these knit together perfectly with the singles. The final lineup featured many of King's hallmarks, including \\"Born Under a Bad Sign,\\" \\"Crosscut Saw, \\"The Hunter\\" and \\"Laundromat Blues.\\" The album made a huge splash among electric guitarists in '67 and '68, and has continued to be influential ever since. The 2013 reissue adds five bonus tracks to the album's original lineup, four alternate takes and an untitled instrumental, all remastered by Joe Tarantino. The 16-page booklet includes insightful new liner notes by Bill Dahl alongside Michael Point's notes from the [[ASIN:B00006878K 2002 reissue]] and Deanie Parker's original 1967 cover notes. The extra tracks are worth hearing, but it's hard to improve upon perfection, which the original album remains to this day. [©2013 Hyperbolium]

B002AKPECW|5.0|Storytelling at its best. I loved the characters, and fell into each richly developed relationship like a gravity well. The story is vast...so vast. Reynolds is a marvel of imagination. And the science is masterfully wound into the plot, explained effortlessly for a drummer like me to feel smart.<br /><br />Thanks Mr. Reynolds, and do that again please.

B007HLIUN4|1.0|The agenda of the authors appears to be &#34;Leibnizian Thatcherism&#34;: we live in the best possible world, and the bad guys (i.e. the non-British/Americans) deserve to be poor because they ignore deregulation and thatcherism/reaganism. Very black-and-white, full of small and largish historic errors.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is one of the very best series on television.  The characters are all very well-developed and there are plenty of twists and turns in the storyline.  I can hardly wait to see what happens in season 4!
B0029LCJJS|3.0|Somewhat pretentious.  Cardinal Wosley and Sir Thomas More characters most interesting.  Think the comment about cable TV &#34;show us the boobs&#34; seems appropriate.
B002S43V3Y|5.0|I had never seen this before yesterday and my friends were all telling me that I was missing out. So, I finally gave it a go and it was a wonderful movie! Maude's playful spirit and ideas on death is truly inspirational (especially given her past, which is hinted at, at one point). And Harold's love for her is heartbreaking. Please, don't wait as long as I did to watch it, just watch it!
B000KITQK2|1.0|This item was defective shortly after receiving it, so I contacted the company and returned it at my expense for replacement under the warranty.  It has been 5 months and it is obvious they have no intention of repairing or replacing it.  This is not a US based company.  Would caution against purchasing any Behringer product as they do not stand behind their warranty and their products are subject to being defective.
B0084YAU86|4.0|Sherlock Holmes has always fascinated me since I was a child watching Basil Rathbone do his sleuthing. He was always austere and definitely strange. This new series doesn't stray from that exterior detective. However, there is a peeping through at Holmes as we come to know him through the eyes of Watson. Holmes is definitely brilliant, definitely strange, yet a person who \\"secretly\\" loves those people who think they know him but don't. Ultimately, I came to love this particular version of Sherlock because I did see his humanity-because he did have a heart for someone other than himself.<br />I loved this Sherlock so much I hated the fact that the series was over. I wanted to travel with them again and watch Sherlock solve his cases. Unlike most shows, I could not predict the endings or even if I guessed \\"who\\", I didn't know \\"why\\".<br />This version of Holmes is a definite winner. It's a series you won't want to let go of even after you know it's the finale. Finally, a Sherlock to embrace.<br />BRING HIM BACK IN SEASON 3. PLLLLLLLLLLLLEASE!!

B00ALCBU4M|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I am a fan of Military action flicks, especially World War II films. Considering who is in this film I may have expected too much from the producers. In &#34;the making of&#34; segment, the director talked about how War Movie buffs expect a lot of 'accuracy' and how they strove to give us just that, with the uniforms and weapons, the vehicles and whatnot. So, I expected to see Tiger I tanks like the ones in Kelly's Heroes and Saving Private Ryan. Not so. First off, every WWII 'buff' knows what German armor looked like, the colors the size and shape, things like that. The first glaring error was the Rebel gray paint schemes used on thier two types of Soviet armor they rented for 'two days' That was all they &#34;could afford&#34;. German WWII armor was painted a combo pattern of Desert Sand, Black Green 'squiggles' with Red Earth 'squiggles', and overpainted during the winter months with Whitewash temporary colors.<br />The two former Soviet vehicles they used in the film were 'modified' to appear less Soviet and sort of like German armor, but in reality the lack of knowledge displayed by the films Military adviser really screwed things up. The &#34;Tiger I&#34; looked like no piece of armor I have ever seen. Long Story short: For me, the really crappy armor really destroyed any enjoyment I could have taken from a great script (which it wasn't). The half-scale 88mm anti-aircraft gun/cannon didn't help. It was constructed of PVC pipe and looked OK if you didn't look directly at it.<br />Unfortunately, the majority of the explosions were quarter scale. Artillery or tank rounds are impressive when they detonate, and as a combat veteran who has had a variety of ordnance thrown at him, I know of which I speak. The detonations in Windtalkers came the closest to reality of the many films I've been blessed to watch.<br />The actors tried hard, the script was quite trite and 'been there, done that' familiar. Here's a scene: Dark of night, frigid, snow covered forest, men hiding behind trees from the searching Nazis and their lights and guns. Sounds thrilling no? Picture trees not wide enough to conceal the soldiers hiding behind them. Oh, and they're SMOKING CIGARETTES and blowing smoke into the air and look like there's a forest fire! The Nazis SEE NOTHING, sort of like Sergeant Schultz from Stalag 13!<br />Yet, there were some pretty good spots. Not enough for me to feel good about spending my money on this film instead of Dora the Explorer for my baby girl. Netflix it, and decide for yourselves. I wouldn't buy it again.red forest, men hiding behind trees from the searching Nazis and their lights and guns. Sounds thrilling no?

B004LROUNG|5.0|This book was a perfect entertaining read.  I had just bought a kindle, and I was looking to buy a book that I knew I would like as the inaugural novel for the kindle.  I chose Grisham, because I am generally a fan of his work.  However, this book surpassed my expectations.  The characters were wonderful, and you really end up invested in them.  The storyline is strong and captivating.  If you like other Grisham stuff, this book will be a great read.  If you are looking to start reading Grisham, I would recommend this book as a great place to start.

B0026772N8|5.0|Initially I heard about this book as a constant name-dropped subject on TV shows. A wacky gift someone owned in sitcoms. But there's a reason this classic is still around. I'm not a biker, nor am I even really interested in becoming one, but this book is more than that. It's a part of American literary history. It's a necessary addition to any genuine reader's shelf, and a great gift for anyone looking to enjoy a new classic.

B007SGM084|4.0|The series seems to be best known for its intimate encounters, but I found that the best part of this novel is the back story behind why Christian is the way he is. His negative and positive experiences shape his pesonality and actions.  It's interesting to follow his transformation from someone with a soul so void of self respect to someone who is capable of love and being loved.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Sad, touching, funny...great characters, well written,  thought-provoking, emotional...at least for me.  One of those books that you can't stop reading because you want to know what happens but you don't want to keep reading because you are afraid of what you are pretty sure will happen.

B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I read the book before I saw this movie and I really liked it.  However I don't think it's appropriate for young kids.  Kids killing kids as part of a game is sad.  This reminds me of The Running Man movie.
B001F0WXY0|5.0|Here's the novel that certainly belongs on the reading list of every self-respecting sci fi fan. Herbert encompasses all aspects of empire and soul tensions.
B000001F76|5.0|I recently went to a show featuring Hank Williams music and though I had never really heard much about him or his music I liked what I heard and immediately went to Amazon to see what I could purchase.  I got a two CD great buy and I cannot be any more happy with the 40 greatest hits I listen to.  Thank you.
B008M7JODC|5.0|This is one of my favorite tv show and it is not on netflix and every other site u go to u have to pay to watch it and so I'm glad it is on Amazon prime so I can finally start watching it!

B0015AARJI|5.0|Feels a bit different than the original that comes with PS3 console, but serves its purpose. So, no complains so far.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Oh my goodness..  I absolutely loved this book!  Fell in love with Travis and Abby, Although at times I wanted to beat them over the head because they were being so stubborn.  I don't like to review books in detail because I don't want to give away too much, but it's a must read.. Beautifully written!  Could not put this one down. Reading Trav's side of the story now! :)
B0074MZSWW|3.0|I love this band, but the album isn't very dynamic.  They use the same tricks over and over.  It you want some solid blues with outstanding vocals this album is great!  If you're looking for a bit more than that, it falls short.
B008LFY6NI|5.0|Have this for my IPad and the kids love it!<br />Got it for the Kindle so they don't fight over taking turns with it.<br />Just like the old spin art we use to have at the carnivals.
1878424319|5.0|It was a good book. Was it great? No. I often paused to let the messages sink in and they definitely did, but nothing in this book is by any means easy to put into practice. I think the only agreement I could remember after putting it down was &#34;Make No Assumptions&#34;. That seemed like the only agreement that you could really think about and apply to daily life. But hey, if you can walk away with something such as that, then it's worth the money.
B000JIHP88|4.0|We like this one but it didn't fit on our crib.  our crib has thicker rail. this is our crip. we didn't buy at this website tho.  [...]  anyway, whoever has thicker rail like that it wouldn't fit.  we tried to return but once you snapped the leaves in then we couln't take off, which means we coudln't put them in the box. so we contacted fisher price and it was fine to send only base. and we did and got vourcher.

B00AVTMCYW|5.0|I have not really liked book to movie adaptations because they usually disapoint but, this one did not. This was a great book and a great movie because the author wrote the screen play and directed it. I would reccomend it to all of my friends.

B00AB7HESI|1.0|this is a waste of your money. I bought it and now I want to return it if I could because it sucks!!!!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This ranks near the top of Kings novels.  Couldn't wait to finish it.  For those of us who like King's works, this is must.  Since I can remember the JFK assination, I found some parts historically factual.  Couldn't figure out how it would end.
B000VYX8PE|3.0|This book was ok... It wasn't terrible, and it wasn't amazing.<br />I'll give the second book a try, and if I like that one, I'll read<br />Book three.

B003EYVXTQ|4.0|Jennifer Lawrence was great in this movie which is why I wanted to see it to begin with but it's an extremely intense movie.  Subject matter is depressing.

B009KEN87O|5.0|I was skeptical when I saw this as the free app but I`m so glad that I downloaded it. It's great just like Atari was exciting when I was a kid. I love this game :)
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Sometimes the game might glitch and you'll fall into a gap that you jumped over. But it is definitely five star worthy.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|I was very surprised at the stunning and disturbing depictions in this book.  You have a first hand account of the horrors of war.  No one should have to see the things the author describes.  The survivors must still have nightmares.  Reading this is as close as I want to come to this type of warfare.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Another great game.  Love this type of game.  It's challenging enough for me and I would recommend it to others who like this type of game.
6301390725|5.0|I remember seeing this when I was a little girl with my father at Radio City Music Hall at a time when they would show the movie and then the Rockettes would go on. I remember the hundreds of people on line to wait to get in and the fact that this movie was shown to complement the Rockettes show even then told you it was top quality family movie. Its about a woman who is taking mail order classes on witch craft and there are a lot of songs and dances while taking place during WW2  and the kids had to flee London because of the Nazi bombings and live with the lady (angela landsbury)  Just a fine and wonderful old fashioned family movie. If you like that genre of chitty chitty bang bang and wonderful innocent cute movies, this is for you.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Its an awesome game and when I play it I cant stop..... the only thing is that you should have a hover board all the time.... you should get it automatically
B00503BN1M|2.0|Honest to say, I have no idea what is this movie  talking about? Love or just only sex? It is a waste of my time to watch it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Downloaded this for my grandchildren, but I like it also.  My four year old granddaughter does very well with it too.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Great perspective on life in general, whether one is a teenager or not.<br />I definitely recommend for any sensitive reader.
B00280LYIC|5.0|So, I won't give much away, but in this book Percy Jackson tries to find Zeus s master bolt. On this quest, Percy travels through the under world and met Hades. Hades and the other gods believe it was Percy who stole the bolt and Hades helm of darkness. At the end of this book, I'm sorry to spoil it, but Luke is the Lightning Theif. He has been working for Kronoss, Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades evil father. Luke is convinced that he had  been wasting his life as a good person, so he has turned to the dark side.I scantily say any more:):):):)

B001ANSSDC|4.0|Not being familiar with people living with mental health conditions, I really liked this book trying to describe the lived experience of the main character, who is suffering from PSD. As far as I can appreciate this point of view, it seemed a very nuanced and sensible description of the experienced reality, along with a very impressive narrative.
B004LWZWGK|3.0|After 4 Long years since Christopher Nolan once again broke ground with \\"The Dark Knight\\" (2008), I was somewhat disappointed with \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" (2012). While the acting from all the major and minor players is excellent, Anne Hathaway's Catwoman was without dispute the best part of the film (I would have like the film to be more about her, Bruce and their relationship) and the action and vehicle pursuit sequences are better than ever, as well as a rousing performance from Tom Hardy as Bane, this film just didn't quite cut it for me. Too many problems with the narrative,(such as plot holes, and ridiculous plot points), the Miranda Tate subplot, The lack of music in certain places, in  and even the film's opening premise were all low points for this movie. I'm not saying that Nolan's \\"Rises\\" was a bad film, just one that could have been a lot better in the long run.<br /><br />The Opening Premise:<br /><br />The whole \\"its been eight years since Harvey Dent died\\" and \\"Bruce has become a crippled recluse\\" premise was in my opinion: Bad for business! Here's why: The main reason(to me) that Batman/Bruce Wayne has endured for 75+ years is the fact that as a character, he continues his crusade, regardless of the personal cost that comes from his actions. The start of film is upsetting to me as a \\"Bat-Fan\\". I paid to see Batman, not Bruce moping around Wayne Manor in silence, simply because he lost his girlfriend (who really was going to marry Harvey in \\"The Dark Knight\\" (2008)) and give up! It goes completely against his character, and if he is so crippled, than how was he able to fight bane at the end of the film? or even at all? With a \\"magic knee brace\\"? (I know he re-trained himself, and \\"learned how to be Batman\\" again, this time just in a different location)<br /><br />Miranda Tate Subplot:<br /><br />I get that Miranda is an attractive, successful businesswoman (Marion Cotillard is absolutely gorgeous, obviously) but still why would she go out of her way to help and support Wayne and his police cohorts, only to backstab him at the end? (The Talia Al Ghul \\"twist for twist sake\\" wasn't handled too well, comic book fans like myself saw it even before the film premiered in theaters) and why didn't Bruce Wayne himself see that Tate was a member of the League of Shadows? He recognized that \\"mark\\" on her back in that scene when he is sleeping with her at his mansion? Right? It made no sense to me at all: Bruce is a highly trained ninja-like combatant with a brilliant mind, and he doesn't know that Miranda is a trained killer and strategist? Why is she suddenly the \\"main\\" villain, when Bane was running the show since the opening shot?<br /><br /> TOO MANY PLOT HOLES!!!!<br /><br />(I'll just name a few)There are too many in this film to name in a single review!<br /><br />Bane just brings Wayne all the way to a pit prison just to taunt him and fly back to gotham? Why?<br /><br />How in the world does Bruce Wayne get back to Gotham all the way from another part of the world? (I know he's Batman, but he is supposed to be in \\"Our world\\") It just doesn't make sense!<br /><br />Alfred breaks up with Bruce and his crusade simply because he's going too far and completely disappears for about two-thirds of the movie? (despite another round of great performances from Caine and Bale respectively)Where did Alfred go? What was he doing while Bruce was trying to stop Bane and the Nuclear Bomb?<br /><br />What was the point of John Daggett? Why was he even in Gotham in the first place? If he hated Wayne so much, why didn't he just move to another city? Like Miami, New York, or even Las Vegas?<br /><br />How did the old prisoner medic manage to snap Bruce's back in place?<br /><br />Several of Bruce's attempts to climb out of the Pit alone would have killed him!<br /><br />How did Bane become so strong? What gives him his strength in the film, and how is he able to find Fox's armory despite it being \\"off the books\\"? How did Bane find out where Wayne Enterprises or even Applied Sciences were? How did he know about the Wayne Enterprises Board, or even who Lucius Fox is?<br /><br />Hans Zimmer's score (despite the absence of James Newton Howard) is great, but why is it missing during both Batman and Bane fights (which in my view) would have added more emotional impact to both scenes? (especially the one in the sewers, where Batman gets his back broken)<br /><br /> Overall, Nolan's \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" is still a good film. Gary Oldman gives a solid performance (being the best actor doing the best job in these films) as Gordon, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt's John Blake was a stand out in the film (Blake seems to be more of the lead protagonist than even Batman is) My favorite scene is still when Bane kills Daggett and it sounds like he's getting tickled off screen! Priceless! I also loved the \\"Bat\\", and its flying sequences through the streets of Gotham. thoroughly enjoyed Bane blowing up Rogues Stadium and Hines Ward running away from all those explosions!  This would have made an even better opening, and given the audience with a real sense of what Bane is capable of; and why he is such a threat to Gotham. I Still can't get over Anne Hathaway as Catwoman! Her character was more in line with comics! She played Selina with a noticeable sense of style and sex appeal. Christian Bale is more than serviceable as Bruce Wayne/Batman, and he packs more of an emotional weight to his performance(with his Bat-Growl intact).  Finally, Tom Hardy's \\"Bane\\" was more in line with the graphic novels of the 90s, like \\"Knightfall\\" and \\"Vengeance of Bane\\". Bane isn't just a brute, but a master strategist, the kind of strongman that could also beat you in a chess match. The show trials were great! \\"Exile, or Death?\\"  It should be noted: this is my final Batman film review.  I hope you fellow Amazon customers enjoyed my reviews, as much as I liked composing them.<br /><br />3 Out of 5 Stars.<br /><br />This film is still mildly entertaining. Watch when you get bored, or when you need an escape from a bad day at work.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I thought this story was going to be a classic &#34;domestic dispute gone horribly&#34; but it really surprised me.  I was not very happy with the ending but I accepted it.<br />This was the first book I read by this author and it left me wanting more so I've read her other 2 books (and enjoyed them).
B0058VW36U|4.0|I like this game,but it could been have more detailed.<br /><br />I enjoy playing it every day. Thanks for inventing it.
B0031RS542|4.0|I read this book after the movie and was equally moved by the story. The description of the Indian society, viewed through the eyes of the main character was very interesting. I liked the building of the different parts of the narratives very much.
B005C8ENI0|5.0|Use closed captions to catch all of the conversation. Second viewing helps with understanding movie. Love the soundtrack and Earl.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Reading this book I felt certain I had figured out &#34;whodunnit&#34; right off the start but I liked how the story enfolded, the danger and adventure of it and also how there were &#34;clues&#34; I missed that all tied up in the end.<br />That's the thing I like about Gillian Flynn's story - it's a mess to start with but by the end there is a solution somewhat.<br />Also her main characters are quite dysfunctional but somehow relatable.<br />I enjoyed this book and will be looking for more from this author.
0345525558|4.0|A Very compelling heroine--draws reader in enough to really care about what she goes through/as she grows up and changes
B005LCYR7Y|3.0|What I liked about this book: the diving in the fifties-sixties, with lively descriptions of that period. What I did not like, were the repetitions in the plot.
B00270CS6K|5.0|Some of the Coen Brothers films come real close like &#34;Fargo&#34;, but this is one of the top films of all time if you don't mind dark humor.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I am really enjoying this author's books.  I've read 3 so far and will be looking for more!<br />This story is very different and slightly weird (I think most of her books are) but Gillian has a way of telling a story that keeps you interested right until the very end.
B001NKI60W|5.0|I have watched this movie so many times. It's wonderful. I laughed, I cried, I smiled, I giggled, I danced, I sang along... it is a keeper!! It makes me want a perfect movie romance.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Clever plotting and sharp well observed prose. Acerbic style did get somewhat wearisome toward the end by which point I was beginning to lose interest in the characters
B0094M2S5A|5.0|Fantastic music and top actresses and actors. Lots of lessons of life contained in this movie. Should be more movies like this one.
B003Z49LYO|5.0|I enjoyed the actors performance  - also the script is pretty accurate to the book.  While Tess's story is one of frustrated  tragic love, I was still drawn in to the what if's of this story.  I watched the movie immediately after  reading the book and I was quite pleased with the visual enhancement.  The only thing that threw me off is that  since there was a Season 1 - I was searching the web for a Season 2.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is fun!  I love the bright colors and shapes.  Very interesting and keeps you trying to beat your time.  I recommend for those who want something fun with color.
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|This app would not work no matter what I tried to do. I would not recommend downloading this app. Very disappointed
B002B2FZKK|5.0|Put the album on a USB stick and enjoy the soundtrack during my 50 mile trips. Another classic movie with dark humor.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|This season was good but it dragged on to long. The last episode was stupid plain and simple. Season 2 was better with the perfect season finale. This season? Garbage.
B000FC13Y0|3.0|As fantasies go I found it to be light without alot of meat to the characters....The twists and turns however, did keep it interesting right up to the end....I also liked the way all the loose ends got tied up.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|These guys are so creative! This is an excellent CD. I believe all ages will find something to enjoy from their music.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|Was disappointed while watching the movie. I expected it to be really great since there was so much advertising about the actors and story. Not sure some history details were correct. I will look forward to another movie that will be as good as I expected.
B00BGD07KS|5.0|Now I'm going to be honest I'm totally biast cuz I'm a huge Mariah Carey fan, but I like to keep it real and something not everything  is that great, however this song is really good, I really like it, I think her voice sounds a little different at the beginning of the song but then we get the M.C we are used to with her rendition of inspiring vocal ability and transmits the message of the song.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|It's a story that it's equally hard to digest but hard to ignore. I agree wholeheartedly with the author that future generations will ask us why we never acted with all this compelling evidence of human atrocities taking place in North Korea. Superb writing, and equally superb job in fact-checking, to the extent that a story about North Korean defectors allows.
0060775858|5.0|Just when one thinks that there's no hope for contemporary children's literature, a classic like Goodnight Moon comes along to restore one's faith.  It is especially great as a tucking-in-bed story, helping the child to relax, relinquish the day and welcome sleep, confident that everything and everyone will still be there tomorrow.<br /><br />The litany of goodnights to different people, toys, etc., can be modified by imaginative parents to include things that their particular child is attached to - they can add a goodnight to the family pet, favorite toys - and do it with the name the child actually uses.<br /><br />The child can also be encouraged to add his or her own \\"goodnights\\" to special friends and possessions.  This helps the child become an willing participant in the process of going to sleep, and provides a sense of security and continuiity.  Parents who wish to teach their children spiritual values can incorporate those as well.<br /><br />I think that this is a good book even for children somewhat younger than four - any child who understands saying \\"goodnight\\".  The cadence of the book, \\"goodnight this, goodnight that\\", creates a soothing rhythm to help relax the child and lull him or her to peaceful sleep, as well as a powerful message that sleep is just another part of life to be welcomed in the rhythm of days.<br /><br />As a mental health professional, I believe that this book can help children develop a sense of security and object permanence, and can be very good for psychosocial development.  I rather imagine that Goodnight Moon helps parents and other caregivers relax as well.
B008393Q2O|5.0|My Kindle Fire is small enough to carry around, so I have an ongoing grocery list in SkinnyNotePad and I always have it with me.  Also other lists for things I need at other types of stores, people I need to contact, projects I need to complete.  This app is very applicable to my daily life and I like using it a lot.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Not your typical SCI-fi novel, really gets into the psychology and motivations of human behavior.  I highly recommend this...just purchased and read the sequel because this one was so good.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Wanting extra protection for my Apple 4S due to a cruise vacation, I ordered this case based on the recommendations online, as well as a few friends.  I used this case with the standard USB white charger cord that came with my phone.  It was almost impossible to connect the charger and I had to really angle the cord and almost force it to get it to connect.  Then...because it was so tight and so far recessed into the case, the only way to remove the charging cord was to tug - really tug - on the cord, which I should not have had to do.  After one week of wrestling with this case and the dread I felt when my battery was low, I gave up and removed the case.  This was the most disappointing purchase, considering the cost, that I ever made.  Someone in the phone store did tell me they heard there were issues similar to mine and the case had been revised.  If that's the case, then I was obviously sold the older model.  Very, very frustrating and hugely disappointing!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I did not see the movie, so I can not compare it to that. But I loved the book. I couldn't put it down.
1451696205|5.0|Llegó justo lo que pedí, llegó a tiempo el libro y el vendedor es confiable por demás. Ordena el tuyo!
0807014273|5.0|I embrace this book with respect.Sometimes we feel terrible while running from one corner to another in our daily routine.We think we have issues to solve and do not feel that we're directed mostly out of our inner purpose of life.Viktor Frankl helped me to discover that vision of my life needed to be re-visited.Under such terrible circumstances no body succeded to take his choices to make a living.This book is a good opportunity for a self-evaluation and face the reality rather than the illusions of moments.
B005K17RU0|5.0|It's good and it gives me all the info I need to know what to wear and what to expect.  Thank you for such a great app!
B00AHXIC50|5.0|This is one of those CDs in which you will love every single song in the cd, seriously.<br />Its like a mix of reggae and pop with like a little rock/techno?... + Bruno's voice & attitute is absolutely amazing! Ps: This CD is occasionally very sensual (in a sort of good way) & Bruno pours his heart out in some songs (When I Was Your Man, Moonshine) while rocking out in others (Gorilla, Natalie).
B005K17RU0|1.0|the new upgrade is terrible. way too much info. i loved the former version - i'm so very sorry i upgraded.
B00B1ME3DQ|5.0|Clutch, as always, delivered with this album. It's absolutely awesome. Very reminiscent of Pure Rock Fury and Blast Tyrant, in my opinion. If you're a fan of Clutch, you won't be disappointed.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|The bare bones plot may fool your first impression, but techie types will love the details of Watney's (the main character) survival.  Coupling the black and white simplicity of his basic needs and his non-stop sarcasm provided Weir with a rich palatte of dialogue to accompany the detailed chemistry and physic's analysis that his tongue in cheek hero uses to survive.  From the essential life support systems to food, the story marches with excellent pace and realistic foibles, typically due to an easily overlooked detail that reminds one of how engineer's design and refine.  The language might be a bit &#34;salty&#34; for younger readers, but I find the text is not offensive at a base level, and the spice is merited by the events.  Read and enjoy, while we wait for another book from this fine author.
B001R6AW18|3.0|Rather antique for the time. 80 years old, quite an accomplishment that it manages to  remain alive even today. In that respect, King Kong is a respectable film.

B008OHV5QO|5.0|This is an excellent DVD. The close-ups in the concert are remarkable and I really enjoyed seeing and listening to Neil Young answering questions. All that said I'm biased as Neil can do little wrong. He's a legend. I had the chance to go to the cinema to watch Journeys but I'm glad i bought this DVD instead.
B000HL0EEE|5.0|Great Sci Fi show and you don't need to be a fan of the other Star Trek shows to understand it.  Towards the end of the season you can really see the character development and interaction develop.  Worth watching if you enjoy Sci Fi.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Once again I have to write (to my eye) an overly long review. I am not a movie critic and do not like being required to write why I liked of disliked a movie or show. For me the stars should tel it all.
B0017O1MIM|5.0|This movie was made from  an 8K restoation and a 4K transfer.  The transfer shows it, one of the best Blu Ray movies ever. The story is exciting and moving, A five star recommendation.  The Booklets supplied give a very in depth story.
B008CJ0KI8|4.0|Is it a good album? Yes. Is it great? No. And definitely not as great as the hype is. I have read people describe it as \\"an instant classic\\" or an album that would revolutionize R&B. I have seen Frank Ocean being compared to Prince. But all of that is a hyperbole. A good album to chill out to, with some interesting musical moments and lyrics, with some hope for more from this artist in the future, but nothing more.<br /><br />My favorite song from the album is Pink Matter. It's strong musically, as well as lyrically. I also like Sweet Life. Super Rich Kids, Pyramids (though the album version is not the best version of the song I have heard), Lost and Bad Religion are okay songs too. The rest of the album however gets kind of repetitive and - as a result - the album gets boring by the end.<br /><br />Maybe the songs would sound better if Ocean was a better singer or if other artists performed them. Unfortunately Ocean is not really a good vocalist, he sings in a quite monotonous tone throughout the whole album, rarely being able to convey different emotions through his vocals - which makes the whole album sound monotonous.<br /><br />I also found the intro and interludes and outro quite unnecessary. Yeah, you can skip them, but it's annoying you have to.<br /><br />I have seen people claim Ocean is a lyrical genius. Calling him a genius (as of yet) is another exaggeration, but are his lyrics strong and deep? Well, they are deeper than your average pop/R&B song that you see on the charts these days. His themes are definitely very interesting and even unique at times. I have seen flashes of brilliance on this album - such as Pink Matter -, but at other times I felt cheated. I felt we are supposed to take ramblings as \\"deep lyrics\\". I just haven't seen the \\"deepness\\" in them.<br /><br />Despite of the fact the album did not live up to the hype to me and despite of the above mentioned flaws, I gave it four stars. It's a solid debut album after all, not bad at all. Oceanis definitely a breath of fresh in today's R&B. But I can't help thinking there is a bit of overhype about this album.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|I bought this to give as a gift to a Bowie fan. I ordered it, got it within days, and gave it the week it was released. It was very enthusiastically recieved!!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This book is much better than the first one in the series as there is more real romance less M& S
B00280LYIM|5.0|It was great.If I could tell Rick how great it was ' I would<br />the best one ever of all
0385344228|5.0|I was prepared to rate this book as a four star read. I love courtroom drama mixed with suspense, and although Landay does this<br />very well, there were sections here and there that were just too wordy. I felt like the book would read better about fifty pages shorter.<br />What convinced me of how great this book was, happened in the last pages. The ending was superb!! Loved it. So good that I won't say<br />anything about why I felt that way. Would be the worst of spoilers.<br />Suspense and legal drama lovers--read this book! You'll love it.
B00AYR2FOI|4.0|Not as good as one of his other albums, but glad I added to my collection of Boz.Scaggs that I own.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|i Dont care if you are married, single, or whatever, EVERYONE should read this book!!! It will improve every relationship in your life!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I recently watched the Hunger Games film, and instantly wondered why I never read the books. This book took me into a whole new world, which for me is a sign of a great book. I am anxious to begin the next installment of the series. I would recommend this book to any person who enjoys science fiction and an easy read. This was hard to put down!
0449808696|5.0|Most of the information wasn't new to me, but the sources and access that Michael Moss had really gave weight to the issues discussed.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Este es un buen libro porque dice muchas palabras interesantes y nuevas k yo no sabia como en ingles y es bueno
B003ASLJK4|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie &#34;The bridges of Madison Cpounty&#34;, the movie was very near the screen play, recieved it on time and as promised, highly recommended.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I just started playing and so far so good. Great graphics! I can't wait to play more. The mini games are fun, you can practice jumping, mix food, muck out the stables, feed your horse treats- I can't wait to level up.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|My son just loves this perplexus. He has all of them. Very unique and entertaining toy. Even i have fun with it.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|&#34;Defending Jacob&#34; is a solid read that moves quickly.  The characters are deep and draw you into the story emotionally.  The plot twists and turns are well thought out and will probably catch you off guard - especially with the fabulous ending.  Well worth the investment!
0743270754|5.0|Very interesting account of Lincoln's life. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about the civil war.
B0090X4GLW|4.0|My daughter and I loved the movie..the soundtrack is good. I do agree with other reviewers that it is missing some good songs :(
B00AHTYI5M|3.0|I know this movie was based on real events with real people<br />but I found it boring with boring people and I am sure it wasn't at the time for anyone<br />I am one of the biggest Ben Affleck fans around from the movies point of view it was well done and deserved the awards it got<br />but I wanted more personal details<br />I just wasn't entertained
B008FPOIT6|4.0|Enjoyable. Love his writing style. Ending was anticlimactic. All in all, I recommend this book. Fast,easy read well worth the time.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Cool graphics. Doesn't restrict you to one storyline but gives enough to keep you moving. Definitely a great game for being free.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Awesome, awesome movie! Love the reference to the Breakfast Club, and the songs are amazing! Reminds me of my younger years :)
B006SMLAMQ|5.0|go to my kindle many times to check the weather.  It is clear and understanding to look at and know what it is going to do.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|All the scenes seemed so dark.  Depressing. It is a slow moving story about the 13th amendment, and not as much about Lincoln himself.  The real surprise of this movie is that Steven Spielberg directed it!  Would not recommend.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is the best game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!! You get leader boards to connect with Facebook and Twitter<br />And last thing I love Sidney and world tour New York. CAN YOU DO JAMAICA?
B001DM1VXE|5.0|My wife wanted to see this and I was uncertain. I found it to be very interesting and enjoyed the adventure and especially the end. I am one who can easily walkout on a movie and my wife often gets irritated with me for doing that. However this one kept my attention as well as being entertaining.
B00005JKNF|2.0|With so many characters being introduced in the first 10 minutes and so many sub plots going on throughout the story, I was tired of trying to figure it all out before it ended.  The ending did provide for a surprise &#34;who done it.&#34;
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I thought seasons 1 and 2 were full of suspense and tweeked my curiosity as to what would happen next.  I was never disappointed and I have found season 3 to be just as exciting.  Great story and an in depth look at the aristocracy life style of the great English and Euopean familys.
B000FA675C|5.0|Great book cover to cover..I have read it twice..I can't wait till The Inferno is released, it is next on my list.
B000IZ8SD8|5.0|My second best Star Trek movie (after Wrath of Khan). Jonathan Frakes' direction of the movie is quite marvelous. The editing job is quite spectacular as well. And ofcourse, some pretty amazing acting performance by Jean-Luc, commander Data (my second best character in all of Star Trek franchise after Spock), commander La Forge, and Number 1. All in all, this is a great movie. I've seen it several times and I just dream of a future when our technologies will be so advanced that we will be able to actually understand, communicate with, and collaborate with other forms of intelligence in our universe.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|My son loves it. Building the contraptions is a lot of fun but we both think if they would add a replay feature so you could re-watch what your contraption just did would make it awesome.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love the first season and this second season is even better. I am awaiting the third season on Prime!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|it is a long book with chapters it has 217 pages its green roderick dosint like  his brother and many is weird
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I enjoyed so much the Lord of the Rings Trilogy...this is a new trilogy to enjoy.  With a young Bilbo
B004SBS8LA|4.0|The game is a lot of fun but I still get ads when I have to re-attempt a  level which is a bummer.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|GOT teases you into reading the books too. Very entertaining and addicting as one of the best series HBO has ever done
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I spend a lot of time on my Kindle with this app. I can connect with everyone from anywhere I can get a wireless connection. It is awesome! Love it!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I have recommended this to my students -- women and men.  It is nicely written and contains an important message for success -- gain confidence and lean in.  There is solid evidence for Sandberg's message -- but her first person account is transformative
B005H9B44A|5.0|My husband and I are into the superhero, DC , Marvel comics movies and/or shows.  I thought this was a great beginning to tell about Thor and where he came from. Actor was chosen appropriately and the plot was great as well. Something great to see and keep in the home archive.
B009IUH1N2|1.0|it looks fun but it isn't, it is the worst game i have, and i have hourible games.  from a 9 year old.
B00B9JDBT8|5.0|A follow up to Silent Shout? Not really. Check out Fever Ray if you haven't already. If you are interested in what was to be a foreshadowing of the instrumental side of Shaking The Habitual, I strongly recommend Oni Ayhun. He released 4 eps of just A and B side instrumentals. Cool stuff if you like very tripped out, almost if not exactly jazz sounding electronic beats.<br />The album? Awesome. Presumptuous. Fun. A little \\"out there\\".
0345525558|3.0|Victoria is a girl who has lived through some tough times, bounced around in the foster care system, without parents or siblings.<br /><br />Taken in by Elizabeth who lives on a vineyard, she teaches Victoria the Victorian art of communicating feelings and emotions through the presentation of flowers.<br /><br />The tension that carries us through the book is the question of why Victoria was not adopted by Elizabeth. We gradually learn this a little bit at a time in flashbacks as the current story goes on.<br /><br />What I like about The Language of Flowers is the seamless and flowing writing of Vanessa Diffenbaugh. The characters are not incredibly well developed but it allows the reader to project or embellish the players into more well-rounded people. I also enjoyed the flowery metaphors that are planted throughout.<br /><br />Victoria travels a circuitous route and we are not always sure if she will succeed or not, but somehow, she is a likeable person who we cheer for throughout the book.<br /><br />Will Victoria recover enough to be able to love and trust again? Read The Language of Flowers to find out for yourself.
B004EIZCPM|5.0|this is a very funny movie.  a lot of common teenage actions.  everyone do not hesitate to buy this movie
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I haven't watch it yet on DVD, but think the casting and acting were super on the big screen.  Some have criticized the singing, but I felt the voices suited the characters perfectly.  Others have said it is too long.  To do the producers credit, they managed to translate two VOLUMES by Victor Hugo into less than two hours.  Don't buy the large soft drink next time!
B004U8VX2M|5.0|Life and times of this culture is very interesting. Costuming was well done and loved seeing how the people lived their lives from the idle elite to the use of the first vacuum cleaner by the housemaids. I found I need a housemaid.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|What is the big deal about this book?  I read the free kindle preview and hated it so I did not buy it.  Then so many people were talking about it i thought &#34;well, it must get good later on&#34;  so I wasted my money on it and forced myself to read it.  Boring story, characters I couldn't care less about and writing a middle-schooler could do better at (minus the sex scenes).  I like a scintillating story as much as the next girl but just make sure there's an actual story you can care about.
B0055PMURG|5.0|this is a very inpirational movie about how you can't give up no matter what.  Bethany never gave on her dreams on what she really wanted to be
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This is a fun game of fish and people consumption. I have not played a game like this one before.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|I enjoyed the characters and their  life style. I was impressed by the costuming and setting. Learning about social constrictions and manners was very interesting as well.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I wondered at the beginning how this story could work, but it does.  The science is fascinating. I highly recommend it.  You don't have to be a geek to love it.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|what can i say. another great game.  the best part is you can go back to the begining and try to get a higher score.  endless hours of fun
B0087X728K|4.0|I was having heating issues with my CPU after doing a complete cleaning of the heat sink and fan when I learned that I need to apply a fresh coat of thermal paste after I remove and re-install the heat sink.

B00BDSRKHO|4.0|...this is one of their finest.  Most are comparing this to Dazzle Ships and Architecture And Morality, their most critically adored album. While I hear shades of Dazzle Ships in the little experimental bits, I have to say I believe there's more of a Junk Culture vibe overall. Any band that has been around as long as they have can't help but eat themselves occasionally, and OMD are no different.<br /><br />I won't go into song details; I am sure others will do a much better job at that than I. Suffice to say that this is quite the brilliant return to form. Better than the last one, History Of Modern, not quite as good as that initial early burst (the first five albums), but much better than Crush and all that late '80s and '90s nonsense.<br /><br />This is the way to stage a late in the game comeback. David Bowie, are you taking notes?

B008WCP2PG|3.0|Was so excited to watch this in the theatre and thought I would just buy it to have and for this price figured why not...well now after watching it again it's not all that. Best parts are when the actors are on stage, should have left this to just my one night watching it at the movies.
0307352153|5.0|I borrowed this book from a friend...and then had to purchase my own copy....and pass it on to others.

Thank you!
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|once you get the hang of moving the little character with the up and down controls ,you get to enjoy all the little things that are going on all around you .  my grandson loves the part that is in the water.  builds up your coorderdination
B0050DIWFC|2.0|The author goes into great description in areas of little interest. There is also a lot of unnecessary leading, which rather than being insightful for the reader, is actually frustrating. (These commentaries reflect the narrator's feeling about events rather than actual facts or &#34;clues&#34; to allow the reader the involvement in solving the mysterious conclusion). Was glad when it ended.
B000FA675C|4.0|I made the mistake of watching the movie before reading the book and found it hard to immerse myself in the story because there was too much detail for what I had in my head already.  Other than that, the detail in the book was great, would have been better had I read the book first and then watched the movie.  If you like suspense, and the idea that the Church may or may not be wrong when it comes to the story of Christ, or even just like reading something with a lot of detail and thought put into the book, then this is for you.  This is NOT some shallow, modern, plotless story to lose your mind in and escape to, it actually makes you think.  If thinking is not what you want, then pass it by or you will hate yourself and the book.

B00AB7HESI|5.0|Ive noticed that i seem to have to hold my finger down on a button to get it to recognize my taps which is a little annoying, but doesn't really pull the game down too much. The other issue is the need to use the phones return key instead of the enter button when entering words, again annoying but not a deal breaker here.

B008JFUNYG|4.0|The Evil Dead remake was as gory as it was hilarious. Nonstop (on purpose) clich&eacute;s with homages to the original make this not only a honorable remake but a worthy one. At no point in time would I call this movie scary definitely not the \\"The most terrifying movie you'll ever experience\\" but it is very, very entertaining. There are several scenes which are very tense and unnerving but nothing that'll keep you up at night in terror. If gore bothers you then stray away because literally gallons of blood are used and the wounds are absolutely psychotic. It's somewhat predictable if you've seen the originals but there are still plenty of twists to keep you guessing. The soundtrack is also perfect in every way. All in all it was much better than I expected and an absolutely great theater movie.<br /><br />Also,<br />Make sure you stay after the credits.
0345803485|1.0|This book sounds like it was written by a 16 yr. old. What garbage...I got half way through and couldn't stand it anymore so I pitched it in the garbage where it belongs.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Michael Connelly is a deft hand at pulling together divergent strands and weaving then into a compelling story. In this one, Harry Bosch is working a cold case with roots in the first Iran War plus a tie into the Rodney King riots. Well-done

B000YMQI6E|5.0|It was full of suspense and drama. I liked both Anothony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling. I would recommend this to anyone that likes court drama and surprises.
B002X3V4P2|4.0|I really like Enya and this is a very strong compilation.  Her music and voice are just beautiful.  The songs range from haunting to cheerful.  It's mood music and it's definitely a sound that's not for everyone.  It's very good soothing background music when you just want to relax.
B007KOMTUI|1.0|I am SO disappointed in the Instant Video version of Season 5.  We have terrific internet bandwidth yet our \\"instant\\" video has been anything but.  It buffers constantly interrupting the program and the video quality is extremely poor.  We have only watched two episodes and are so frustrated with this service that I'm trying to figure out how to get it \\"exchanged\\" for the DVD.  Would not recommend
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|GREAT!  So many people have sung the praises of this series that my voice just blends into the crowd.  Suffice to say that I have found no one who has watched the Downton series who has stopped watching.
0060012234|4.0|With this one book, Brent Hartinger has easily gained a fan in me. From the very beginning of Geography Club, with a semi-awkward locker room scene, I immediately adored the main character, Russel Middlebrook. His take on navigating high-school as a gay teenager is done with such heart and humor. And I love how Russel shares his story by talking directly to the reader - Ferris Bueller style.<br /><br />Russel thinks that he is the only gay guy in his high school and he soon learns that he is one of a few - definitely more than he ever imagined. What I found really interesting is that most of the characters who are gay, admit to themselves and accept that they are gay, but it doesn't seem real until other people know that they are gay. Russel addresses this right as approaches another teenager he met in a gay chat-room:<br /><br />  This was stupid. I'd talked to dozens of gay teenagers on the Internet. I'd told them I was gay. What was the difference? But even as I thought this, I knew the difference, and it was big. This was real. (pg. 17)<br /><br />Once he met someone else who was like him, it became easier for Russel to talk about his thoughts and his struggles and fears of rejection. When he finally shares his secret that he had kept from his friend, Min, he seemed lighter, free from the weight of this secret he had kept for so long. And Min admits that she is gay (this may just be one of my favorite scenes in the who book), or at least bi-sexual, too . But Min doesn't experience the same relief that Russel does. Instead it affects Min's relationship with her girlfriend - for her it has become too real.<br /><br />What I think is important part of the story is that Russel, Min, Kevin, and the others have found acceptance with each other, but they are still not out to the rest of the kids at school or to their families. They've found a friendship in their common-bond, but they are still unsure of how everyone else will respond to their being gay. But is this common-bond enough to make a friendship last?<br /><br />Hartinger continues Russel's story in three more books. The final book The Elephant of Surprise will be reviewed in the coming weeks. I'm looking forward to reading more about the characters and see how they interact and change and which friendships last and which ones possibly become even more.mon-bond enough to make a friendship last?<br /><br />Hartinger continues Russel's story in three more books.

0525478817|5.0|This is the second book by John Green that I have ever read, and he just gets better and better. A reader can tell from a simple summary of this book that it contains an emotional story. Two young adults meet at a support group for kids with cancer. Of course, the story is emotional, but it does not rely only on sadness for its strength. The characters have depth. They are interesting. They are troubled. They are trying to make meaning out of life, and they do not accept easy answers even when easy answers are in front of them. I liked it. Read it. You will like it too.
B00BDZV93I|3.0|It's ok, no huge hits like Tha Carter 3 or my favorite album: &#34;No Ceilings&#34; (it's a free Mixtape). It seems as if this album could have had more time put into it, but I guess I will keep buying Lil Wayne albums.
B0019N95IK|5.0|The thing about Paramount is they are slowly learning.<br />  Enterprise is a Trek show that is in many ways the least like a Trek show.  But in the ways that matter - and they aren't always apparent - it is possibly the most Trek-like of any show since the original.  Some people thought the market was saturated with too much Trek and that is a valid point.  But I was pretty unhappy in 2005 when season 4 ended and Trek was not being produced regularly for the first time since the mid-80s.  Many fans blamed Rick Berman and Brannon Braga.  Well, the greatest thing about this set is that you get to watch the two \\"guilty parties\\" genuinely and pretty openly talk about that issue and plenty of others.  It was incredibly refreshing and humorous to hear such candor.  I loved when they ribbed Manny Coto for doing well in the 4th season since popular opinion said the two of them had \\"ruined\\" Trek by that point.<br />  Anyway, I bring that up because I think fans will be interested to hear what they have to say whether said fans agree or not.  I listened to part of the pilot commentary - the new one, the old one is on here as well - and some of the disc one extras.  The exterior visuals are spectacular in the effects shots.  The regular filming is surprisingly bad looking for Blu-ray.  Other reviewers have mentioned graininess and it is.  But they said it gets better after the pilot.  I hope so.<br />  I really don't care about that.  I know it's pricey, although Amazon's price is more reasonable than any others I've seen.  I got it with free shipping and it was here IN 2 DAYS!  So their service on this transaction was A++.  There are more commentaries this time around and a few more features.  All the features from the DVD release are present.  I still wish Paramount treated Star Trek with the same love and attention that the BBC shows for Doctor Who but they are doing better with their original material.  They used to have a trailer or something and that was it.  More commentaries are what I like to see.  The retrospectives are always welcome and it is great to see (or hear) any of the cast members again.  I would welcome more from the writers or producers or any of the tech people, particularly the composers.<br />  As for the series, you either love it or hate it.  The producers tried something different - in fact, they tried a lot of things that were different and it worked for me.  The ship was wonderfully realized on the interior and exteriors used a CGI only ship for the first time.  I enjoyed the temporal cold war.  It reminded me very much of the mythology episodes from X Files.  I had trouble with the way Vulcans were treated initially and then I began to see what they were attempting.  T'pol was a cold fish in the pilot so she could grow.  And did she ever.  I think it's one of the best casts Trek has ever had.  I do feel sorry for Anthony Montgomery.  I'm sure he's a nice guy but I don't think any actor could do much with what he was given.  All the other regulars fare better.  Many people dislike Scott Bakula and to me, that is just ludicrous.  Maybe they still see Sam Beckett.  I don't.  When I watch Quantum Leap, I ask why Archer is in a dress.  Just kidding.  I adore Jolene Blalock as T'Pol and Connor Trinneer is in character right off the bat as Trip.  I also like Dominic Keating a great deal as Malcolm Reed.  Wish he had a bit more to do as well.  Linda Park is fine as Hoshi Sato in the beginning and improved as the show went forward.  I really cared for her as well by the end of the series.  John Billingsley as Phlox was another pro who was just perfect from Day 1.  For me, the show was mostly fresh.  All Trek shows had clunkers in them.  Most of Enterprise's were in Seasons One and Two.  But even in those seasons, we had a majority of fine episodes and some great ones.<br />  Oh and I loved Porthos.  So there!<br />  Bottom line - if you missed it the first time whether broadcast or DVD, this is a no-brainer.  If like me, you enjoy behind the scenes stuff or just hanging out with these fictional characters or better yet, their real life counterparts, then this Blu-Ray set is worth it.  I figured it out to be about 3 bucks an episode.  Let's face it.  I could recite Kirk or Picard verbatim.  Archer is too recent.  I couldn't do that.  It will be nice to visit the gang again and let them know I still care.  True Trek fans who are skeptical about Enterprise and on the fence...watch it again from the beginning.  If you don't get a lump in your throat when Archer makes his speech in the next to last episode of Season 4, you aren't really a Trek fan.<br />  I'm sure most of you who take the plunge will enjoy it.  If not, there's plenty of other Trek out there.  Just not much more new to discover...yet.  Yes, I am eager for the new Trek film.  But as good as it looks, it's not quite Trek to me.  Star Trek needs to be on TV.  And those guys aren't.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I'm not much for drama, especially of the PBS type, but this series is captivating!  I was instantly hooked by the story, production values, and music.  Burned through the entire series in a week!  Well worth it!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season 3, in my opinion, has been the best season yet. More splatters, more suspense, more character growth, loved it!!! I can't wait to see where it goes from here!
B00BESM14U|5.0|Even though its a film about high school students, I think it appeals to a wider audience - it touches on challenges we all have gone through. It's funny, and dark, and sentimental
B0015RFCZ0|1.0|What a nightmare.  I tried using it on my mac then on my iPhone. After 2 hours with asking technical support  - useless - never could watch the video.  I couldn't get this movie on Netflix or Hulu and planned to buy it with Amazon and saw the instantly option.  A huge mistake!  Huge.  In the future I will just purchase videos.  Amazon is good at purchases, but is out of its depth on the online video market.  By the way it is a great video - a terrific story.  I can't wait to watch it again when I actually have it.<br /><br />SP
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's great I like that they update it like every two mouths they when to Rome and lots of others just get the game it will be awsome besides it free
B00795P4EG|5.0|this was so much easier than any app I had for exactly what it claims to do.  Do yourself a favor and spend the couple bucks.  Rarely crashes.  Easy on memory.  Simple to learn with tutorial vids linked.  I love it, and I use it more that adob-ps-touch, which I paid 5 times the money for.  Good job!

B005K17RU0|5.0|Cool App. I like the icon in the statis bar.  Very accurate temps. I like the icon because I don't have to go into th app all the time I want to know the temperature.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is one of the coolest games ever, I can not stop playing it. there should totally make a part two.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|I've read all of Dan Brown's books. This novel is extraordinarily choppy and lacks the finesse of Brown's earlier work. Additionally, quite a few intended twists are so predictable as go be nearly eye roll-inducing.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|This is a really good game and you don't have to tilt it and I play it all the time
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|It is fun for a free game. I just find it irritating that it asks me to login to Facebook but it doesn't do anything.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is a great game for kids and gronups I recommend it to everybody who likes action games<br />thanks.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|It's a beautiful book for all those who believe they're different and think they are all alone. It is very well organized!
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|The app is awesome; I also have it for my phone. I don't dare start Code Red on the Kindle Fire version though because there is a slight delay between when you touch the screen and when the action then performs. It can be a little annoying, but nothing serious to get in your way of managing dinosaurs. I figure they will iron that out later. Also, a lot of people have complained about not being able to access the waterpark until level 10. While true, it is simply put in place so you can work up a decent land park to bring in enough steady revenue to manage both parks when the time comes. A business owner doesn't open two buildings with a few, limited funds right off the bat; but I do not expect an economics-videgame player to understand the reality of economics.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|A good strategic game! We played it all night the first day we received it! One of my favorites now! So fun!!
B008FPOIT6|4.0|Robin Sloan lays out a path to be followed from ancient times into the advances of todays science. The conflicts of tradition and innovation help and hinder the solving of puzzles found in the 24 hour bookstore. This is a quick read and an entertaining ride for those who love books and those who love the internet.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Absolutely loved this series!  Especially the banter and comic relief.  I was completely engrossed in the books and was watching the action in my head while reading it on paper.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|I think this game could have the potential to be great. BUT it took out the feature that gave us the ability to get free money and the only way to move forward in the game is to buy land that cost ten real money in hopes of getting a t rex.<br /><br />It's a pretty cute game, but it's hard to level up . Hard to get food so they'll grow.  It's a once a day game.

B00BEOYPKW|5.0|Kurt Vile may have written better songs before, but this is his best album to date. It's an album's album. It's the kind of album that other albums listen to.<br /><br />You can tell a great songwriter by their ability to use filler phrases like \\"oohs\\" and \\"ahs\\" and \\"yeahs\\" to good effect. With the opening track \\"waking on a pretty day\\" vile has entered the pantheon. The \\"yeah yeah. yeah yeah. yeah yeah yeah yeah.\\" part in that song might sound ridiculous on paper, but man it is absolutely perfect.<br /><br />This album might have magical powers. The songs are all stretched out and i've noticed that when i listen to it, time itself seems to stretch out. Which is cool, because it allows me to get more stuff done around the house, and because time just flies by too fast these days.<br /><br />In summary, buy this album. Listen to it. Dig it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love all the activities in this game I play with my eight year old granddaughter! We have quite the stable now.
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|Okay im gonna admit it: I did not like this album the first time hearing it. There were some tracks i liked, but the whole thing just sounded wrong to me. If your an avid Paramore fan who's been listening since their \\"Riot!\\" days and were expecting their signature rock sound, you may have been disappointed too. But i really wanted to like this album, so i listened to the songs again and it began to grow on me and i realized that these songs are much more mature and grown up then their previous records, lyrically and musically. Their old records were lots of loud music and screaming about being angry, etc. These songs represent freedom and not being angry anymore and to grow up (hence the songs \\"Grow Up\\", and \\"I'm not angry anymore\\".) There are some songs i dont really care for (which is something rare when it comes to Paramore), but in general the songs aren't bad. not at all. It takes getting used to, but its really a fantastic record. Theres something for everyone, such as rock songs, pop songs, and even some ukulele in there. Here are my picks for this album:<br /><br />Now: An amazing song, this song is  relatable and catchy. Reminds me of Riot!<br />Still into you: a lot of people didn't like this song, but its soooo catchy!!! its such a happy song.<br />Interlude: Holday: the interludes are genius and Holiday talks about growing up and dealing with real problems and how when your stressed out you need a Vacation (or \\"holiday\\" as Paramore says it.<br />Interlude: Moving on: this song is soo catchy and talks about moving on from an ex that is with someone else, that would never be the same as it was with them.<br />Interlude: I'm not angry anymore: this song talks about being not angry at someone. this song could be interpreted as anything. (such as an ex, or friends, etc)<br />Last Hope: At first i didn't like this song, but now its one of my favorites from the record. This song talks about having that last glimmer of hope to keep you going.<br />Grow up: thissong talks about growing up in life, even if it means having to lose people while doing it.<br />Part II: This song is a sequel to one of my fave paramore songs \\"let the flames begin\\". at first i did not like it, but now its growing on me.<br />Anklebiters: this song talks about not caring about the haters and is a rock song (like Riot!)<br />Hate to see your heart break: this song is a slow acoustic song about feeling sad when someone you care about is sad<br />Escape Route: this song is a bonus track on the japanese version of the album. Which is a shame since this is an epic song. Its about trying to live your dreams, and not paying attetion to how hard the present is.
1476719071|4.0|Beautiful Disaster starts off as your typical NA Contemporary Romance.  Good girl meets bad boy.  Good girl knows there's no way she will allow herself to get together with bad boy.  Bad boy wants good girl, but there's no way he'll settle down.  And then the reader pretty much knows what will happen: good girl and bad boy fall in love; bad boy changes for this one and only girl; and they live happily ever after.  As I said, this novel begins with all the same elements as the typical ones do.  And I like those stories (even if they aren't the most creative).  But, then Beautiful Disaster changes.  It becomes something much more than the mere good girl/bad boy story.  While this book keeps some of the regulatory aspects that are common, it doesn't stick to the norm.  I was surprised a lot by the story.  And I was very pleased.<br /><br />I'm very conflicted of my feelings for the characters.  Abby (the good girl, who maybe isn't as good as she seems...or hasn't always been...but still is a good girl) is presented as a loveable character that the reader will no doubt root for.  But, there were a lot of qualities in her that irritated me.  She is kind of all over the place emotionally, never able to stick with the decisions she makes.  I got so mad at her sometimes that I wanted to jump into the book and strangle her.  But, then I was also able to easily sympathize and connect with her.<br /><br />I have similar contradictions with my feelings toward Travis.  He is presented as a bad boy that we know we are going to hate, but won't be able not to love.  But, his qualities in the latter part of the book really irked me.  He's supposed to be this bad boy, but I don't like the person he turned into after falling for Abby.  I don't want to say to much, so I'll just stop there.  But, oh, man, did I ever sympathize with him!  I think I may have been more sad for him at times than for Abby.<br /><br />The writing was good.  McGuire is definitely an excellent story-teller and she knows how to write a love story.  I was completely enveloped in this book.  I did, however, notice quite a few editing mistakes...which always bothers me.  A couple mistakes are okay -- as nobody is perfect and I don't expect them to be -- but this was more than a couple.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to any and all romance fans.  I don't think you'll be disappointed with this story -- even with my mixed feelings about the characters.she knows how to write a love story.  I was completely enveloped in this book.

1400052181|4.0|HeLa cells. The scariest thing to me is that these are cancer cells and they are involved in the production of all medicines stronger than an aspirin. Which means what? The book is about the woman the cells are from and is a critique of the medical system that has capitalized greatly on these immortal cells but has never enabled any of the funds made in the process return to the woman or her family. But looking at the cells in a petri dish is not even close to being near a person. What is amazing is the ability of the cells to keep reproducing even to the extent that they hop from one culture to another in a lab.
B009A7E7SK|3.0|The initial app was free, any additional add-ons were only $1.25.  The exercises were individualized and not organized into a complete exercise program.

B00000CQJZ|4.0|Great early Hitchcock film!  I am so glad to own it, and in a fine print restored!  All are great!
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|Extraordinarily engaging animated film!<br /><br />And unlike the recent disappointments of '[[ASIN:B005LAII62 ParaNorman]]' or '[[ASIN:B004R63MWQ Tron: Legacy]]', the creators of 'Wreck It' have the right idea - recognizing that a complex presentation will deliver an infinitely more satisfying product than simply recycling old ideas and throwing a shiny new wrapper around it.<br /><br />Tells the story of video game characters whose existence is much more than anyone suspects. When the humans leave the arcade center, it's revealed that they're actually alive; their world just as real as ours and much grander than what we see thru the fixed limitation of the game screen consoles.<br /><br />The movie centers on one particular video villain named Wreck-It Ralph whose simple pixelated existence is to break down an apartment building, while his nemesis and hero namesake of the game is Fix-It Felix Jr., the squeaky clean goodie-two-shoes who goes about repairing Ralph's two-fisted destruction. Up to the point where Felix cheerfully gathers the apartment residents into an angry mob and tossing the big guy off the roof into a dirty pool of mud.<br /><br />As the years pass, Ralph settles into this depressing life with no friends or family. His so-called home a literal dump made up of destroyed bricks from the job, eating food that's thrown out by the apartment residents, and sleeping in the open like some mistreated mongrel dog. His only comfort, and it's a limited one at that, is finding refuge at BadAnon - a support group for fellow villains, who, it turns out are anything but villainous.<br /><br />Desperate for change, any change, he embarks on obtaining the one thing a bad guy is not suppose to receive - a gold medal. It's a hugely symbolic token that Fix-It Felix receives every day and with every play of the game. Frustrated beyond even his sizable tolerance, Ralph will break from tradition and hopefully change everyone's perspective; focusing on who he is and not what his label says.<br /><br />But the one absolute no-no of the video game world, the one unbreakable code, is to never \\"Go Turbo\\". A reference to an old game character who literally went crazy, left his own malfunctioning game, invaded another and got caught. Human patrons playing the invaded game complained and both consoles were unplugged = electronic death.<br /><br />As Ralph embarks on his incredible journey across a variety of video environments in search of a gold medal, he discovers much more than he ever dreamed - or feared - was possible.<br /><br />Again, an absolutely wonderful, exciting, and fun film for all ages. The perfect blend of wonderful CGI, incredibly rich storytelling, and a touching tip-of-the-hat to the collective history of video games and its earliest fans.<br /><br />Personal Note:<br /><br />- This film seems like the penultimate descendant to those early 1930s cartoons, like \\"Have You Got Any Castles?\\", where characters from books came to life and interacted with one another.<br /><br />- Absolutely loved the first gen video characters making cameo appearances. Tender and warmly nostalgic moments when guys like Qbert, Clyde, and The Joust Knight have a last chance to once again shine in the public spotlight. Classy.<br /><br />- Jane Lynch = Combat Babe. Yeehaw!  X-Dhat his label says.<br /><br />But the one absolute no-no of the video game world, the one unbreakable code, is to never \\"Go Turbo\\".

B00ANGICRE|5.0|One of the top ten movies of the year.  Not a bunch of CGI like most today, it is like everything is a cartoon  no real acting.  This one is far superior.  This is acting between two poeple, simple yet complex. Helen Hunt was amazing  again,  Somewhat like the movie  Water Dance  she did in her early year where her boyfriend was a Quad.  This time her leading man was amazing  keeping up with her the whole movie.  Helen Hunt is sort of a classic actress to me,  very  beautiful  but with the beauty we knew growing up.  Not all the make up , the tatoos, by the way  wasn't long ago you only saw a tatooed woman in a freak side show, to me that is where they should have stayed.  But back to the movie.  I admit alot will watching it just to see Helen Hunt nude as much as she is ,but please try get past that and see the true meaning behind the movie.  I am some what disablied not anywhere close to what he was in this movie.  Helen showed caring and understanding,  wish I could give it more then 5 stars .  A special message to all our veterns, Welcome Home and to those serving in harm's way  come home safe, god bless  and thank you ...
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I like to believe I am a \\"genre savvy\\" reader. As such, normally I can tell where a writer is going with his story. I'm sure most science fiction readers are the same. I'm accustomed to having a pretty good idea how the hero is going to solve the problem.<br /><br />Not this time.<br /><br />Throughout the entire series, whenever I thought I had a handle on how the characters would solve their shared problems, I was wrong. Not just a little wrong, either. Super wrong. Powerfully wrong.<br /><br />Howey surprised me. In nearly every charter. I'm not certain I'll forgive him for that, but I am going to get his other books.

B005DC68NI|4.0|This was a good book, and a much faster read than [[ASIN:B003I6496Y The Newbie's Guide to Publishing (Everything A Writer Needs To Know)]]. Which is a strength and a weakness. Mr. Gaughran hasn't been in the business nearly as long as Mr. Konrath, so you don't get the depth and breadth you get from Mr. Konrath's book. On the other hand, the focus is tighter, and you'll get the basics in a shorter amount of time. There are some good bits of wisdom in here (the pricing strategy seems sound). Truthfully, I found the appendices to be the most valuable part of the book, with a lot of material I hadn't read elsewhere, and a lot of links to further reading.<br /><br />I found the (rather large) part of the book that shared the success stories to be of dubious value. There were some valuable tidbits to glean from these authors, and I got turned onto some authors that I hadn't heard of but subsequently checked out. Some of it was inspiring. A lot of it was fluff, though. It was all sectioned together, though, so it's easy to skip if it's not to your liking.<br /><br />All told, I think this book did its subject justice. It could have gone a bit deeper here and there, but I'd still recommend it to the new author. The appendices alone are worth the cost of admission. While you're at it, you should also check out Mr. Gaughran's blog. It's thoughtful and well-written. And he has a fantastic mustache.

B008673ZAQ|3.0|After reading the 1st book in this series I couldn't wait to see where it went in the second book.  Much like 50 shades there's a breakup, a get back together, a meddling person, a danger element.<br />Again Sylvia Day can sure write a steamy scene and you like that they are together, they do seem to compliment each other.  I really wanted more of the back story to come out on both parties and it did towards the end of the book.  It still hasn't shown Gideon as a dominant but he did do the ultimate for Eva and it's not till the end of this book that she gets it.  This was a fast read and I look forward to the conclusion in the last book - Entwined in You which is out in June 2013.<br />I wouldn't say this blows you away but it makes you want to know how it's going to end for them.  If you read the first book you would be nuts not to continue.
B00BV2M9LO|1.0|I'm guessing Chichton would be pretty pissed that this was released with his name on it!<br /><br />Warning: All kinds of details/spoilers if you're worried about that sort of thing because it's necessary to show the ridiculousness of this book so read either this review or the actual book at your peril!<br /><br />Michael Crichton made a great career of producing incredible ideas with often mediocre characterization but although his characters were little more than stereotypes, the stories always had a logic to them. They made sense. This book does not make sense much of the time but I'm giving Crichton the benefit of the doubt and attributing this to Richard Preston. I have not read Preston's previous works of fiction and this book is not encouraging me to do so.<br />It starts with earnest grad student Peter being informed of the suspicious death of his brother Eric just prior to Peter and his fellow grad student scientists heading to Hawaii for job interviews with the company Eric worked for. He goes to Hawaii ahead of his classmates to investigate his brother's death(you know, as you do as a grad student) despite getting a text from his brother literally saying \\"Don't come!\\" While at the police station he is presented with video evidence that strongly implicates Alyson, vice president of his brother's employer Nanigen, so he naturally he decides to keep that and the preceding text to himself. To show that the author at least knows this doesn't make sense, he has the character repeatedly ask himself \\"Why did I do that?\\". His answer to himself?....\\"because we always looked out for each other as brothers.\\" Wait...what? Not telling the police that you can identify someone who may have had something to do with your own brother's death is looking out for the dead sibling? I can only hope at this point to never become someone that Richard Preston wants to look out for!<br /><br />But now we have to go with the premise that the genius scientist-grad student is also anidiot. He is then conveniently and magically(!) given recordings from the Alyson's cell phone and that confirm his worst fears again; she and her boss were involved in his brother's death! So now, armed with two forms of overwhelming recorded evidence and a text, he is more determined than ever to NOT involve law enforcement! Instead he devises a plan where he will trick the baddies into confessing during a guided tour so all the other visiting grad students will hear it and I guess, not having a brother to protect, go to the police in his stead.<br /><br />The students embark on the guided tour designed to attract them to work for Nanigen during which Vin Drake, head Poo bah, explains that the Tensor Generator can shrink stuff. How cool! Still. not particularly wowed by this since they killed his brother and all, Peter subtly makes it known to the ne'er do wells that he is aware of the truth without actually saying anything specific in front of the tour group. You know, gotta protect his bro! Not pleased with this, Drake stops the tour and with everyone looking on, invites Peter to join him in another room where he proceeds to beat the crap out him. Not sure how Drake planned on explaining the wounds or the absence of the potentially never to be seen again Peter but it turns out since the author had other plans, the logic of that was never necessary to address. Problem solved!<br /><br />Anyway, Peter succeeds beyond anyone's wildest dreams and the bad guy confesses over the loud speakers for the students and probably all kinds of employees hear as well! Woo Hoo! Book over in just a few pages! Oh, wait....there's more. Drake fakes an emergency and then runs into the room full of people that just heard him confess to killing his partner, Eric (and he's aware that they heard him!) in cold blood and says something along the lines of, \\"Come with me, I'll save you from this emergency involving dangerous robots!\\" So this room full of scientific geniuses unanimously decide to pick up their suddenly massively beaten colleague and follow the confessed killer and probable beater wherever he wants to take them without a word...instead of just going out the way they came. In fact other employees are running past them going the opposite direction literally yelling \\" Get outside!\\" but they follow Drake further into the building anyway. Free thinkers!<br /><br />Drake leads them into a room clearly marked Tensor Generator(where have we heard that before?) and tricks them into standing on wacky hexagons on the floor by saying \\"Stand there, you'll be safe!\\" No one notices that the now exposed killer isn't trying to save himself by standing on a hex. He tells them those hexes are robot free zones or something and that is simply enough. He then leaves for the control room and locks them in. Then he opens the door again briefly and throws a Nanigen employee from the control room in with the students simply barking \\"Help them!\\" and then locks the door once more. He next appears in the window of the control booth obviously at the controls.<br /><br />Now why this employee has no idea what to do during an emergency or what the alarms mean is curious to say the least. Why didn't he run screaming form the building like all those employees the group passed on the way to the Tensor Generator room? He seems to know that Drake means to shrink them all but doesn't seem to mind. That he would have no issue with being shrunken with the students during an emergency is weird since later it is revealed that as operator of that machine, he knew that prolonged shrunkeness would kill you and he had no way of knowing when or if the emergency would be resolved in a timely manner so this is also curious....or stupid. This book is populated by dim bulbs. Or as the incredibly hip Mr Drake said at one point, \\"Numskulls\\". Really? We're still saying that are we?<br /><br />But the technician/corporate stooge/idiot rushes to a hex leading everyone to think that's where they need to be so they all position themselves. Then, in an unknown-emergency-inspired fit of kleptomania, grad student Karen King runs to retrieve a backpack from a wall full of them that she happens to notice hanging from a hook and then rushes back to her hex. No one has been told what is in the backpack or why it is there so it must have had a nice Hello Kitty design on it or something and she likey! And you can't say \\"Hey, she got the bag because she assumed it had post shrink tools or something!\\" because she didn't know she was about to be reduced to an insect. She thought she was standing there to be safe from robots. So why would she steal a backpack....in front of everybody?<br /><br /> Wammo! Tiny people ensue! Drake returns and decides to go all sadistic and kill them by feeding them to a snake. The idea being that there would be no evidence if they are consumed. I've never had a snake but it seems odd that  a 4-5 foot snake that is used to eating rats would be interested in basically a half inch insect but the book says it is so who am I ask contradict it? 'Luckily', one of the grad students brought a compound to show off with in hopes of getting hired and slips it to Peter as he is thrown in with the reptile 'hoping' it will help fend off the snake. Now I could go all nit-picky and ask whether since they had been reduced to, I dunno, 1/1000000th of their original size to the point that they couldn't be heard and had nearly no mass, that the 'Hexanol' used to save Peter from the snake would probably have no effect since it was likewise reduced but I don't really know the science. It just seems logical. Still, I'm willing to concede the science fiction part of these types of stories as long as they don't break the rules they set for themselves in the context of the tale. So I plug onward!<br /><br />Aaaaanyway, Unfortunately Drake is called away before he can actually see Peter get eaten by the reptile in a convoluted scene where an Ensign from the Coast Guard shows up to inquire about moving the boat Eric was seen jumping to his death from to a different boat yard for some reason. You see, they need the dead owner's approval and for that they go to his old job....like you do, Instead of the police or family. Maybe the Ensign is also Eric's brother and wants to protect him. I don't know if that is how it's done but it seems like a pretty lousy way to secure evidence to me. Anyway, while there as a device to get Drake out of the room, he lets loose with a torrent of information about what the cops are doing and where they are in their investigation. He even is able to say that the police weren't looking for a specific items on the boat! Apparently the HPD not only immediately notify the Coast Guard of all their progress during an investigation, they even notify all of the lowly Ensigns(No disrespect. Thank you for your service!)! Heck, he even knows that the cops will be at that same facility ANY SECOND to search his office! Who needs a scanner when you have the Coast Guard? The Ensign is invited by Drake to stay until the police arrive and even come along when they search Eric's office. Not sure if the cops want an extra CG member in the room when they are investigating but the Ensign thinks it's a good idea so he stays.<br /><br />Here's how the conversation morphs from the Ensign rightfully not knowing anything to having every detail:<br /><br />Drake-\\"I thought the police were still inspecting the boat\\"<br />Ensign - \\"I wouldn't know about that\\"  The police hadn't come to see him, it was the boat yard owner. - doesn't know anything.<br />Drake - \\" I heard they were looking for a phone\\"<br />Ensign - \\"Not that I'm aware, I think the police have finished their investigation\\" - slowly changing from knowing nothing to having inside info.<br />Ensign - \\"At least as soon as they complete their inspection of his office\\" - Now he knows the inner workings of the investigation!<br />Ensign - \\" I know they went to (Eric)Jansen's apartment today and they're coming to look at his office here....any minute now.\\" Suddenly he knows everything including time tables for an organization he is not affiliated with to the extent that they pull up seconds later as if his watch had been synchronized to the Honolulu PD directly!!<br />Another detour into something I can't speak of with confidence but sounds weird is that CFO Alyson is in her office watching the whole thing through the security cameras that are fed to her desk monitor. This seems odd to me but maybe ultra high tech offices now offer security camera access to all of their top employees. I digress.<br /><br />The conflicted Ms Alyson, who apparently is a proponent of the 'we should all get to murder one person' rule, because she was fine killing Peter's brother HERSELF via remote control now but suddenly has an issue with multiple homicides so she rescues the helpless minis. This will greatly anger Vin the Merciless whom she knows is determined to kill even her if she betrays him but she proceeds to try to save them anyway because as it says in the book \\"She had to stop him from killing those kids!\\"...by driving them to the ocean..... to drown them. Wait...what?<br />Okay to be fair she decides to save them and then while driving her corporate BMW, she decides to kill them again and then when confronted by Drake, she can't do it, so intends to set them free in the nice, safe Hawaiian rain forest full of who knows what kinds of bugs and creatures that eat little things that are half an inch tall.<br /><br />Meanwhile Drake decides to kill her but then while driving his corporate midnight blue Bentley convertible decides he \\"couldn't kill her, he couldn't afford to kill her, he needed her on his side\\" because it'd be too many deaths or disappearances at one time and would provoke a thorough investigation which would likely discover \\"things that he had done\\" and so once it's clear that he can't kill her....he kills her.<br /><br />But before that, while still at the lab, Drake concludes that Alyson must have the shrunken students in her purse so he scrambles to follow her as she leaves the building. He follows her and eventually confronts her in his 'not going to kill her' mode. He deviously manipulates her into letting them go in the woods but they escape by cutting through the bag they are in and fall ....into the woods. Woo! That was close! They were almost left in the woods against their will! Fortunately, they escaped into the woods of their own accord! She panics and despite the fact she was going to leave them there anyway is worried that they will be hurt or even KILLED! Oh, the humanity!<br /><br />Drake tells her that the only way out now is to make it look like the grads were out drinking and drove off a really high cliff by planting the MANY personal items belonging to the grad students in it that he *surprize* collected at some point while trying to rush out the door and follow her from the corporate building. He had to rush you see, because it was night time and he was going to have to follow her lights so when exactly he had the time to formulate this plan and gather the items is unclear. He is one fast dude! Still not sure exactly why Drake would give a bunch of prospective employees a BENTLEY to drive around in either. I know I've never been given the corporate car while waiting for the results of a job interview but I hear Hawaii is laid back and that's the story he's going with so.......<br /><br />He then gets all OCD on her about placing the items where each SPECIFIC student would be sitting in the car because he insists they have to 'stage' the crime scene. How he knows which objects belong to which student having only just met them for a few moments before going postal isn't exactly explained. Maybe in the few seconds he had gather all the items he also took time to watch surveillance video so he could jot down what belonged to whom. He is fast, you know. How these items wouldstay in place as the car plummets of a 600 foot cliff and into the water and how this is supposed to be important to the police when they potentially find the car is also not exactly clear either. Why it wouldn't be weird that the items be there when ALL six bodies are gone seems a little strange and Alyson mentions this but it is a convertible and with the top down anything could happen I guess and whatever, he's an evil guy and they do wacky things, right? RIGHT??!?!? Alyson is not without her wackiness here too. While being scared to death the police will see through this lame ruse, she can't help but be concerned that one of the items belonging to a student used in staging, a belt made from python, is illegal! She must be one heck of a CFO! She is comforted by Drake who assures her it is only illegal in California. Whew! Let's get back to covering up our probable mass murder!<br /><br />At this point it seems the idea is that with no top to the car, the missing bodies will not be an issue but what do I know? Nothing as it turns out. He has her drive his Bentley convertible to the edge of the cliff and then puts on gloves, I'm assuming because the fact that it's his car and he was just driving it a minute ago, the gloves would eradicate all his fingerprints from every time he's ever driven the car? Or he was afraid of leaving finger prints on Alyson's skull as he kills her, apparently no longer in 'I need her alive and on my side' mode. Because Drake asks her to get back in the car to drive it literally ten feet so they can then push it off the cliff. She says she doesn't want to and would like him to do it but he demurs saying that he would have to move the seat and THEN the police would be suspicious!!!! She accepts this logic easily because everyone knows, once you move a seat, it's set for life!!!! She then gets back in and drives the long ten feet toward the cliff. He then has her PUT UP THE TOP of the convertible, the only thing that would've reasonably explained why none of the bodies were there, to keep the student's items inside! At this point I am rooting for her slow agonizing death myself. Put her out of my misery; she is too stupid to live!<br /><br />Meanwhile back in the rain forest, the little grad students get the history of the shrinking project from the Nanigen employee and then take stock of what they have to survive. Karen says \\"I took a backpack before he shrunk us!\\" raising more questions that no one asks. Again, why did she take the pack if she didn't know she was about to be shrunk? If the Nanigen employee DID know they were going to be shrunk since he directed everyone to get on the hexes, why DIDN'T he take one? Or tell them all to? If Karen DID know she was going to be reduced, why did she return to the hex at all instead of telling everyone else to get off of the ones they were on to save them? Did she really believe Drake was shrinking them to protect them even after so callously admitting to killing Eric and apparently beating Peter to a pulp just prior?  Is she stupid or a thief or stupid? Is she related to Alyson? Is the Nanigen employee stupid or just stupid? Tough call!<br /><br />After this the group embarks on what is basically a paint by numbers sci-fi escapade with crazy monsters and of course the mandatory extremely annoying member of the group that fights with everyone and then turns on them exposing them to danger because he believes that Drake, who has been trying to kill them the entire book, will suddenly want to help him because he's injured. 'I was going to kill you but now that I see you are hurt, let's get you to a doctor!' is what he's presuming. No real need to go into anymore detail than that. It was basically the first third of the book that was so obscenely ridiculous!<br /><br />Why did I read this thing? I couldn't stop! It was so bad to begin with that I had to see if it ever made sense! Is that so wrong?<br /><br />But in case you were wondering, it's set up perfectly for a sequel! I can't wait!
B00138CYD4|5.0|Brings back memories of the 70's. A great era to have lived through. The songs that was created during this era had deep meaning and it reflected what was happening then.
B005NKGEP2|3.0|This is a good read, but it can get confusing at times.  Still, I recommend it as it is interesting!
B00846REIS|4.0|Without comparing to 50 Shades, this book stands on it's own with likeable characters, good story line and steamy writing.  Comparing it to 50 Shades there's one element missing - the voyaristic element.  The reason that so many women enjoy 50 shades is because of the emails between the characters, the thinking in their heads and the build up to final seduction.<br />Gideon Cross is a commanding billionaire who wants Eva Trammel who comes from money and isn't impressed by it.  They are both into sex and pleasing each other and they are likeable.  Eva's character has been around the block so the naivete of Anna from 50 isn't here which is refreshing.<br />I read this book pretty fast and enjoyed it; I'll also do a review for the second book too.<br />This book is much steamier than 50, but I was really hoping for a demanding Gideon and it didn't happen.  He chases her and she responds but also doesn't loose her identity.  Her best friend is likeable and her parenting situation is similar to Anna's from 50.  I think it's interesting that both authors had their characters in therapy, showcasing that everyone needs a little help from time to time.  rather than show it as a form of weakness it showed as a form of strength that they wanted to get their \\"stuff\\" together.<br />Read this book, go into it without any preconceived notions and you should enjoy it.

0425252868|5.0|Great read and a true story. My Father was an engineer and gunner in a B26 Marauder. Like many of his generation of true heroes he spoke little of his experiences in WW2. I enjoyed reading this and gaining a real perspective of what he and his fellow airmen experienced on their many bombing runs over Germany..
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Television at its best. Great cast, very inventive concept and scripts, and Josh Whedon. What a shame that it was cancelled after only one season. Now it lives on as a cult favorite.
0061978078|5.0|This book was just as good as Delirium. Order this book, it seems like it won't be as good at first, but it is---you won't regret it.
B000QRIGJY|3.0|After reading all 19 Harry Bosch novels I think Connelly should write one more and title it Who Killed Harry. It could bring together all the characters left standing from the first 19 novels and after 400 hundred or so pages disclose that Harry kill himself. I want some credit for the idea.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Just one warning about this game - it will pull you in and not let you go!  I love the simplicity of the design, which nonetheless provides increasingly challenging levels for you to ponder.  It's a lot of fun, and I highly recommend it as one of those &#34;need to kill some time&#34; games.

B004T2QZL8|4.0|It is very fun until it started to randomly crash an say doodle god has stopped and that is getting a little annoying but other than for that it is a great game and I would recommend this to all ages even though that they're are a couple sexual things but at least the made child safe setting so you can keep all of that stuff away and you can set a code so they can't just get into the sexual things but other than for that it is a good game and I would recommend this to everybody.

B009O07NDY|4.0|This soundtrack was great! It was absolutely everything I've come to expect from Howard Shore. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because it is a prequel to The Lord of The Rings, so the music hearkens back his music for those films. However, I loved the theme for the Dwarves. It was their turn to be musically represented.
B00B69UQJY|1.0|DM is getting progressively worst with every album they released after Ultra. When I heard SOTU, I thought they can't do worst than that, well I was wrong. Delta Machine is actually one of the worst albums I've ever heard. I can't even give it 2 stars. If I could I would give them 0 for lack of creativity and Gahan's moaning or yelling instead of signing. This is unmelodious mess. But where do they go from here? Do they make another album that will be total disaster or do they retire?<br />I really hope they retire.

0062124293|1.0|Everyone was talking about this (for the life of me I can't understand why) but seeing as how I am open minded, I decided to give it a try. Read the reviews first and I am SO GLAD I borrowed this from the library and did not waste a penny of my money on it. I had to force myself to get through the first 50 pages. No laughs, no smiles just tedious and b-o-r-i-n-g. It went back to the library the next day. Don't know who will find this funny - perhaps giggly 12 year olds that Instagram themselves or post videoes on You Tube. I certainly hope girls looking for an inspiration will not use this as a role model. Yes, I know it's tongue in cheek humor but seriously, it's sad the author made money from this trash. Find something else more productive to do with your time than read this book.
B00BF11STU|5.0|Very realistically portrayed.  We owe a lot of praise to the CIA investigating team that worked so hard to conceal bin Laden's location and to the Navy S.E.A.L. Team 6 for the final take down of the Al-Qaeda terrorist, Osama bin Laden.
B005HJWWW8|2.0|Bought this for an iPod Classic where the maximum volume is woefully inadequate even with my Bose Q15 headphones.  The amplifier still is not strong enough for an adequate volume for videos and barely adequate for listening to just music.  And, the unit drains battery life quickly.  So, one has to remember to fully charge the unit before embarking on travel where no power source is available.  I would have expected the unit to at least turn on and charge from the iPod when hooked up, but it does not - it remains dead until recharged.

B008BDZP3K|5.0|Frank Zappa was a genius.  I would say despite his eccentricities, but &#34;demented genius&#34; is redundant.  Most of his work with the Mothers of Invention displays the loonier side of that genius -- not always successfully, but true experimentation requires a willingness to fail.  The epitome of that genius is &#34;We're Only in It for the Money&#34; -- the brilliantly strange parody on the Beatles' &#34;Sgt. Pepper&#34;.<br /><br />But none of those efforts show off his musical genius.  That's why I love &#34;Hot Rats&#34;.  The music is sarcastic and exciting, and just as eccentric as Zappa's more theatrical efforts, much more difficult to accomplish if you aren't writing lyrics.  (There is only one vocal on this album, and the voice is Zappa's old partner in crime Captain Beefheart.)<br /><br />When this album was first released, I jumped at it.  I was a disk jockey at the time, and I hadn't yet embraced very much of Zappa's more bizarre adventures.  The critics generally panned it, which seemed short-sighted at the very least.  But Zappa got his revenge.  Several years later, he released a followup called &#34;Waka Jawaka Hot Rats&#34;, to which critics responded, &#34;This album is really brilliant, but not as good as Hot Rats.&#34;<br /><br />If you're expecting Zappa's notorious lyrical romps, you will be disappointed.  But if you're looking for the musical genius behind those romps, this one's for you.

B0000073BG|4.0|I've been listening to this album for the best part of 40 years.  Although I don't agree with some critics who contend that it is the groups best effort (my choice would be &#34;Turn of the Cards&#34;), it contains the extraordinary 25-minute &#34;Song of Sheherazade&#34;, a brilliant piece of work that tells the tale that we've all heard since childhood.  I opted to replace my vinyl LP with the CD because parts of &#34;Sheherazade&#34; are so quiet that even though I've taken care of my records and they are still in good condition, you can still hear the surface noise.<br /><br />Of the other 3 songs on the album, only &#34;Ocean Gypsy&#34; really resonates with me.  I found &#34;Trip to the Fair&#34; somewhat monotonous, and &#34;The Vultures Fly High&#34; unexceptional, but &#34;Sheherazade&#34; by itself is worth the price of admission.<br /><br />Incidentally, the live version of &#34;Sheherazade&#34; on the BBC Sessions double disk is a cogent reminder of how amazing the piece is and why the studio version is superior.  In the live version, Renaissance performs the entire 26 minutes (a little longer live) without stopping for anything as irrelevant as applause, but they had to make instrumental compromises for the live performance, substituting synthesizers for the orchestra.<br /><br />So sit back and listen to &#34;Sheherazade&#34; without distraction.  Ride along with the story.
B000VYNYN0|5.0|Evil Dead is one of the most original and best horror films to ever come out. I have always loved horror movies, even as a child but never stumbled across this masterpiece! I would recommend this to any horror fan who can appreciate an &#34;older&#34; film!
B006X3VNOA|5.0|I opened the album today to play on the turntable and much to my surprise, I have two copies of sides 3 and 4.  Apparently the manufacturer did not verify that the entire album was placed correctly inside the sleeves.  While the sound quality is excellent, I am a little peeved that I am missing essentially half of the album.  Hopefully Amazon will rectify the situation so I can rate the album higher than two stars.<br /><br />Update 4/17/13<br /><br />Just received the replacement. Updated to 5 stars.  Great sound quality and great service from Amazon.

B00006JDVV|5.0|My second favorite dragon movie (the first being Dragonslayer, of course).<br />This is a fabulous variation on the end of mankind genre.  Imagine, people digging where they shouldn't, wake up one nasty dragon (a bit peckish after a long sleep).  After that, dragons rule.  For some this might be considered a nightmare, for me it's a fun movie filled with great characters (standouts being Christian Bale, Gerard Butler, and Alice Krige in a brief but important role).  My favorite scene involves Bale & Butler putting on a stage play for the children.  There are fun moments and frantic moments.  Life for these people is idyllic (up to a point) until the intrusion of despot warrior Matthew McConaughey (as Denton Van Zan).  After that, it's a matter of ducking and running for cover because there's more evil afoot than just dragons.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|I realize some people may not like this movie due to its storyline (basically having an affair on your spouse), but I can find no fault with this movie.  The acting and life events and scenes from world events the coincide with the year just come together to make it special.  The song was so beautiful, I ordered the CD.  Its amazing that the whole movie basically took place in one room.  It deserves to be watched at least once (or in my case, once a month).
B000AMPZF8|5.0|Where Muse came closest to electronic/rock mix perfection. The energy of Plug In Baby and Citizen Erased and beauty of Bliss is where the band began to come into their own. A must for any fan of their current work.
B005LAII94|2.0|To give Oliver Stone credit, he has contributed some the most powerful films in cinematic history. But less can be said for his most recent film SAVAGES. I will admit that this isn't the worst film I've ever seen. Hell, it's not even the worst Oliver Stone film I've ever seen. That said, the film lacks a lot of what makes an Oliver Stone film compelling and what makes an audience stand up with full attention. Based on a novel, that I haven't read, it tells the story of two pot dealers Ben and Chon, who live the high life in Laguna Beach with their shared girlfriend O. Yes, her name is O just like the magazine. With their business taking off they soon catch some unwanted attention from a mexican cartel who ultimately take O hostage until they get a slice of the boy's profit. Now the performances are nothing to be sneezed at, because after all these are some fine actors. Salma Hayek gives a great and very humanistic portrayal of the cartel queen Elena and Benicio Del Toro is at the top of his game. I will even go as far as to praise John Travolta's performance as the crooked DEA agent. The actors are not the problem here, it's the story. The film drags where it shouldn't, the storyline drifts from one characters problems to the next without any real detail, and the ending is something that is less to be desired. In fact, for those who have seen the film and will know what I'm talking about, it should of ended with the three main characters lying in the desert. I know that sounds grim but for a film like this it would of worked.<br /><br />Oliver Stone is a filmmaker who takes risks, and I admire that. But of course with risks comes consequences. And I think SAVAGES has suffered from that.
