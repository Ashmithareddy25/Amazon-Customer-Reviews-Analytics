B009IF82SK|5.0|Love this show. Can't get enough of it. I've seen every episode of every season at least 4 times now - it never gets old!!
B008R14YBK|4.0|Probably my favorite album this year.  Brilliant material, exquisite musicianship,  energetic in-tune unassuming vocals, intense rhythm grooves.  Check out YouTube cuts from the promotional tour with Bridgit accompanied by amazing Neara Russell on vocals/keyboards and an equally talented guitarist vocalist whose name I don't know.
B0058BI864|5.0|Love this show. Can't get enough of it. I've seen every episode of every season at least 4 times now - it never gets old!!
B0076DELIG|4.0|Terrific plot development as usual from Michael but a bit of a stretch at the end with Det Mendenhall riding to the rescue while the villains are doing what??  Playing gin rummy?
B009CF3P7E|5.0|This is what actually introduced me into the world of Star Trek - before seeing this I had never really bothered to check it out. It was so amazing that I simply had to see what this was about, and I am not disappointed that I did!<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and watch this!
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Very disappointing.  First half is a basic rehash of the series with the exception of the new characters.  Looks like they took the out-takes from the other films to make half of this movie.  Once you figure out what's going on you have one cool chase and that's about it.
B005S39YGU|5.0|Love this show. Can't get enough of it. I've seen every episode of every season at least 4 times now - it never gets old!!
B005DOJ68K|5.0|.You can't beat the price for this mp3 download. It has 20 of their biggest hits. I like that you can store it on your Amazon cloud and listen to it on any computer.
B000PMLFRA|4.0|the box was a little damaged but the discs seem to be fine they all played without skipping or messing up
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My son loves this game. We bought him a Kindle this year and I downloaded it for him to play. He's going to be super excited!
B000PMG16U|4.0|the box was a little damaged but the discs seem to be fine they all played without skipping or messing up
0307165485|5.0|Again, I bought this to cut out the pages and make into a purse. But I just can't bring myself to do it! I had this book as a kid and remember all the fun I had reading it.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is a wonderful account of a neurosurgeon's experience into wholism and spirituality. I work in the field of energy medicine and anytime I find an allopathic physician experience and share her/his perception of the multidimensional realms engaged in our everyday reality, I take notice and share. This is a easy read. Read it for the confidence it will offer to stay committed to our country's shift towards Integrative Healthcare.....We need these &#34;Non-believers turned Believers&#34;....<br />Barbara, RN, MSN, FNP, MIchigan
B002NXOQF2|5.0|I read this book years ago.  I ordered it onto my Kindle for my youngest daughter to read for a book report for school.  We enjoyed reading it together.  It was even better than I remembered!!!  This is a classic book and a good read for any age.
0547884591|5.0|I can't believe all of the pictures in this book! They are very helpful and informative.I loved the section on the molecular cooking! A must purchase for everyone!
B001AG52AG|4.0|This is a good action picture for younger people who like a little fantasy.  I can't offhand think of anything that would affend the parents if they let their kids see this picture.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Redemption so far for the somewhat slow Season 2. My only gripe is that I wish Amazon would get these on Sunday night rather than having to wait until Monday.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Wonderful book! It keeps you interested with every turn of the page! Our country is lucky to have this man on our side fighting for our freedom! Thank you for sharing your experiences with us, the reader.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|My daughter and I love to play this app. Its very fun. You have so many different options..cutting, straightening, curling, washing, dyeing. I totally recommend this and its cheap!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Great book!! I could not put it down. Our country needs more men like Adam Brown, a Real life hero!!!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|good story line great graphics.  some of the item are a bit small but the hint button can help you find them if your eyes are getting old like mine
B006LSZECO|5.0|I had a great time reading this book. There were so many twists and turns throughout which made it a lot of fun to read. A little sadistic at times but overall, awesome!
1419705849|5.0|My 13 yr old has the entire series of the Wimpy Kid books...giving this one to him for Christmas... I know he'll love it!  Got it very quickly and in great condition...

0345803485|5.0|I read this whole series, after mixed reviews from family and friends, and really enjoyed it!  Giving the first book to my best friend for Christmas to get her started...
B000JQUMPI|5.0|One of my favorites since I was a child. I've read it many times and never get tired of it.
0321701763|5.0|Everything came brand new as described.  The Cd was sealed and everything came well packed.  I found it really easy with the search engine.
0440244412|5.0|If you like reading about deadly immortals, twists and turns, not knowing who to trust, this series is for you!  I read this book in one night!  I couldn't put it down.  Action at every turn!
B009B50QOU|5.0|Loving me some Uno.  Thanks to the treo of albums I have rediscovered Green Day and so happy that I have.  Only comment is what did the DJ do to you  :-)
B004YCKK6Y|5.0|I have seen this movie about a dozen times. I am so glad I could finally find it on DVD.
B00AH34AUQ|4.0|If I was to put the 3 albums in order of preference I would say it goes Uno, Tre and then Dos.  Green Day has done an outstanding job with these albums.  I hope a magical 4th shows up.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|This game is ok...... But u only get like 15 minutes to play. Also u Don get to tame anything. It hard to do some stuff.<br />.
B00A4GXJD0|3.0|This is not my favorite album by Kid Rock a little to redneck country for my taste.  Would like to see him get back to Detroit goodness.
B001E907HW|5.0|I watch this again and again.<br /><br />Sweet love story infused with Chayanne's playful and innovative cha-cha. He's one sexy smooth dancer! And, I'm quite impressed with Ms. Williams' International Latin Dance skills as well. Quite impressive!<br /><br />Great Sunday afternoon chick flick!
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love the app! It's good for kids also. Its good for a rainy day when you cant go outside.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Upper levels are fun to try to solve in one's mind before the first swipe. Simple graphics that look great on Fire HD.
B002OSAT7U|5.0|I recently just picked this up and I love it from the first track to the last. Pick it up!
B00A0R42L6|5.0|The Ice Age series are great moral stories that show family (herd) values with different types of individuals. No matter what the situation, when the going gets tough they all stick together and save each other. All the movies are family perfect viewing.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This was amazing I love it it was amazing<br />Read it and lol it's FUNNY WOO WOO!!!!<br />Thank you Jeff kinney
B001BLRPCS|5.0|Love this group...Love this song by this group...became a big fan of theirs, everything on the album is great and they have a few songs that are really awesome, this is one.
B009ZE27US|1.0|I am 13 and it said I was : 18 once 19. three time and once 30. I got it because it was a fetured app. the only thing I did like was the loading it was so fast. :3
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Despite the complaints the apps worth the upgrades, And lets face it its only 3 bux more so all in all its amazon for the birds
B00AGOGOLE|2.0|I don't see a way to aim this at anything except the person holding the Kindle.  The video is erratic.
B007THA4FI|1.0|too many characters are introduced with each chapter.  I couldn't even finish the book, which is very rare for me!  I expected the author to be able to utilize a great editor, perhaps she didn't listen.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|Best App Ever. I can access my computer from anywhere now. I suggest everyone should get this. It is a hidden gem.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|One of the best Christmas stories out there! And watching it on Blu-Ray makes it even better! I highly recommended it for the holidays!
B00A757EFW|5.0|As soon as I saw this game I knew I was gonna love it. Always been a big fan of pac-man.
B0083GQ2A0|3.0|This one had Liam Neeson running with wolves and being Taken.  Slightly more believable than doing the bad guys in Paris and the scenery was not bad.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|This is a great movie, no bones about it. I think I grew up on this movie and have seen it about 200 or 300 times. Shipped quickly, packed well, and well priced!
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|Good photography, good story all around better than a lot of the junk with Headline stars.  Sort of old timey, makes me yearn for &#34;Thunder Road&#34;.
B000YHG72E|1.0|We might be the only family that doesn't like this movie, but my husband and I rented on Amazon for our kids, since we saw it in the theaters years ago.  and didn't like it.  We thought maybe our 6 and 7 year old would like it though, since all their friends do.  Well, they didn't like it either.  Could just be our sense of humors are different, but it's not our type of funny.  We love the Santa Clause movies and other Christmas movies.  Hope you enjoy!
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|OK, they got Jason replaced and Renner did a fairly good job in all the same sort of unbelievable cavorting.  But the suspension of disbelief required was an inch too far.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|My daughter loves this app; wants to play it all the time! Some educational value too, though mostly entertainment for her!
B009NQKXYK|5.0|I did not realize that sound was in HD too.  This one really kicked my Bose into action and makes me want to try more HD stuff.
B003B02O14|5.0|Grisham has done it again.  The Partner is a great read, great story, and true page turner.  The characters are among his most creative, and the plot keeps you
B009CPJHY4|4.0|Hey these people can roll over in bed and it would be interesting.  Some scenic instances of India and an amusing Hotel salvage story.  Still would not want to go there, but OK for an hour or so.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|Is PERFECT he never ever lets me down, love this man. His voice and style are perfect, not mention he is sooooo handsome.
B00AC8ZJ6K|4.0|I didn't know anything about this movie until I saw it among the instant video rentals. It turned out to be a very good side story that adds a little more depth to the halo universe. Definitely a great rental if your a halo fan, or like starship trooper type movies.
B000088E6D|5.0|Love him what else do I have to say? You make it so hard just to express our feelings, does not require so many words, that is why I won't rate the rest.
B00A6N7BS0|4.0|I went into watching this movie thinking that it was gonna be really bad. But instead I found it to be a likeable story. The unorthodox relationship between the 3 main characters turned out to be semi-plausible. Benicio Del Toro played a great scumbag bad guy! The story, although it may not be quite as good, it's vaguely similar to a movie like blow.
B003INBOE2|3.0|Bought this movie based on high rating on Amazon.  Watched about 1/2 the movie and it started to freeze on me.  Couldn't get it going again, so I had to return it.  Based on just half the movie, it seems like a low budget production, not an epic movie I'm so used to seeing in a Hong Kong production.  The fight scenes were not very spectacular.  Not what I expected.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|It has so many options for you to do with your pictures. This is the best photo app you will find.
B004I11VZ0|3.0|Movie appears more like a soap opera than a real &#34;theater&#34; movie due to its low budget production.  The fight scenes are only so so.  I've seen much better Chinese kung fu movies than this.  Overall, it's still a decent movie.  Not great, just decent.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|A bunch of addicting games! Will keep you busy! Old school style games bring back childhood smiles. I like this game set.
B005IQ39AY|1.0|I downloaded this because it was free.  Maybe I was thinking it was more like another bubble game I had played and enjoyed.  But i just found this one not to be enjoyable.  It's just a odd game.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I use this everyday and love it. its easy and does a great job of waking me up. I recommend it.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I got this free on my Kindle Fire HD.  I love Mahjong and this is a very good version...challenging, but not too hard.  I'm considering buying the full version.
0399160450|5.0|This is the first book of Tom Clancy I have read...primarily because the reviews of his most recent books have been marginal at best.<br /><br />However, this book was outstanding.  It had a very believeable plot and the action was fast paced through out the entire 834 pages.
B004V5A7K8|4.0|I've enjoyed the challenge of this game on my Kindle.  It has cool colors/screens and is challenging - I still haven't been able to make it through to the end.  It plays well with no problems.
B000FC146C|5.0|I read this book years ago and loved it, glad I decided to read again because I forgot so much and cannot put it down.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Not worth the time to write a reviev!!<br />Not worth the time to write a reviev!!<br />Not worth the time to write a reviev!!
B006KX3GXO|5.0|PicsArt is massively full-featured.  It's got more features and functions than just about any other app out there.  And PicsArt Draw opens up a whole new world of drawing on a tablet.  What's really nice is that I can choose to share my work or not (either I leave in on my HD or I can share it within PicsArt's community of artists, or I can share it on one of about 12 different social networks (FB, Twitter, G+, Flickr, etc).  GREAT app!
B0052GACNM|5.0|He is the best and Bennett enthusiasts will love this recording andf the artistis who sing with him. Hope he continues to record.
B002U3CCKQ|5.0|A great read. Surprising compelling gripping page turner. I have read all of Gillians books and this one was up there with Gone Girl. Ready for the next one.
B005H0YP7W|5.0|enjoyed listening to this album immensely. All the songs were terrific and I highly recommend this music to anyone looking for a great singer/
B000002IO1|5.0|Her voice is sultry, Black Velvet is a beatiful song sung with much heartfelt emotion.  Wish all of her songs had that umph!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This is a really exsiting book, even better then the last couple of books.<br />i am already looking forward to the next one
0307719774|5.0|I got this for my sister and my girlfriend and they love it. It covers 5 years and gives you just enough space to answer the questions. I'm a fan.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I love this refreshing fairly tale with a strong heroine.  Most fairytales depict females as the femme fatal, princess.  What a great story and role model for little girls and their Mom's!
B008AX1HD8|5.0|I had never heard of Jo Nesbo , but i was intrigued by the reviews and the location, it turned out to be an excellent read, and I will be looking to buy  more of the series
B004VMUS9G|5.0|works great. i say download it now!!! as good as or better than any other alarm i have used before.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|It was ok. It was not what I expected. Good action, but the story line was less than it could have been.
B003TNM2K6|5.0|IT'S GOT SCI-FI. ITS GOT  MYSTERY AND DRAMA AND A ENDING THAT WILL LEAVE YOU LOVING THE WHOLE MOVIE!! LOVE IT!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Great jon Mr. Connelly.  Loved the book as I did all of the Harry Bosch books! Cant wait til the next book is out.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|In my opinion The walking dead is one of the best series in years!<br />So, of course, I had to get it on DVD. Unfortunately there is no uncut version in Germany or even the UK.<br /><br />So for any fan in Europe, of course you need a Region 1 DVD player:<br />I ordered it from the US, it arrived even before the estimated delivery date and even after paying the VAT it was still cheaper than buying it in Germany...<br /><br />The series itself is just great, just see for yourself... definitely worth the money!
B004LWZW4W|5.0|Rise of the Planet of the Apes follows Will Rodman (James Franco) as he attempts to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease; he conducts his tests on apes, and eventually saves a baby chimp, Caesar (Andy Serkis), by adopting him; Cesar, however, has inherited the intelligence of his mother, who received it through previous tests, and eventually starts an ape revolution after a series of unfortunate events. (The story is a lot deeper, but I want to keep the summary short.) Rise of the Planet of the Apes is a visually-stunning and epic film.<br /><br />The story in this film is engaging and immersive; the story can often be touching, sad, and even brutal. The relationship between Will and Cesar was great, and felt authentic, despite one character being computer. On that point, the visual effects are amazing in this film; the visuals are crisp, and the animations/movements are smooth, and the facial expressions were extremely detailed. The entire story was entertaining, keeping a SciFi vibe throughout, and ending with an epic, jaw-dropping action sequence. My only slight issue was the actual ending; Cesar and Will have a final confrontation that felt a bit rushed, or incomplete. (Maybe because of the upcoming sequel?) The film is beautiful, the music was enchanting and epic, and the acting was great from the entire cast.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray version of the film looks absolutely amazing and sounds great; this is a film worth owning on Blu-ray or viewing on HD. It comes with one disc for the Blu-ray, another disc for the DVD + Digital Copy, and a slip cover.<br /><br />Overall, Rise of the Planet of the Apes is a great SciFi film, with a touching yet epic storyline and amazing visual effects. I highly recommend a purchase for fans of the genre.<br /><br />Rise of the Planet of the Apes has some violence and blood, no sex or nudity.

B009A9EPLM|5.0|Having listened to this soundtrack numerous times, I still wish to hear it again.<br /><br />John Williams have a Grammy forthcoming.
B008VBYN80|3.0|what is the definition of fun? spending more money on a 'free' game to get anywhere? no. At least not for me.<br />at first it was neat and now after playing for awhile I just do it to kill time.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|It's a fun show, great characters. I love the relationship Castle has with his daughter. The quick-witted humor is spot on and the cases are interesting.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|the songs all have that classic kiss feel if your a kiss fan then this one is a must to get
B006VA57CY|5.0|This is the type of drama show I've always loved, and Downton was no exception. I was completely hooked from season 1 episode 1. Fans of other Masterpiece dramas, period pieces, or primetime soap operas will absolutely LOVE this show.
B0068TLD3A|5.0|This is an amazing children's book and quite philosophical, too. I think it's one you just must read to your kids. They will love it. My dad read it to us and to his grandkids and to anyone who came to visit. My sister even read it at his funeral.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I really like its hour by hour weather conditions and 15 day forcast in your local area.  Great weather app to have.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|Its a little weird since they throw aliens into it and it makes it not as scary as the first season...its mostly just weird. But you should still watch it!
B005IQ39AY|4.0|This is really an enjoyable game. Plan ahead and it is easier to save balls for later, plan around accumulating more resources and play on. It would be nice if you could start from a more difficult starting point after failure, instead of having to start from the very beginning again.
B0043UB0EI|5.0|So much drama, blood, sex, and such good stories and characters unfold that keeps you wanting more and even makes you cry sometimes. Watch it! You wont regret it!
B007N9FKCY|5.0|Ayden is very successful with this game. A lot better at it than I am. I recommend it to everyone.
B00AE2J5HI|3.0|Its a good story but for some reason its just really long. Watch this movie when you have nothing else to do. Its got a couple of good fist fights but thats it.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I enjoy playing this game. Can be a little chanllenging , but provides great fun. I recommend it for any age.
0446672653|3.0|This book was ok. The beginning is really good but the ending is disappointing. And it's too commercial. I feel like Dr. Weiss advertised his other books in it way too much and his therapy method. The first 3rd or half of the book I was really into it and couldn't put it down but afterwards it was so so. There is no real story, it seems kind of made up, no real substance. It's a good read if you need something light, a bit different and that reads quickly and easily. It was good timing in my life but I wouldn't read it again. However I would read some of his other books by curiosity. But I'm reading it more as a fiction than actual fact. Not sure I really believe it all.
B009IJJ5B4|3.0|I should preface this review by stating that I am a Sherlock fan.  I've read a couple and I've seen all of them (save a few silent films).  From Jeremy Brett (stellar) to Robert Stevens (ick) to Benedict Cumberbatch (solid...very).  This show has some fun with the Sherlock model, casting a female as Watson who is, true to form, an actual doctor --though minus the war scars. She coaches (or attempts to) Sherlock on social skills as he struggles with addiction, also paying homage to the original.  The pair are fun to watch as Sherlock slowly insinuates himself into every part of Watson's life, and drags her from one grizzly crime scene to another.<br /><br />However...<br />They haven't gone anywhere.  The overarching story seems secondary to the CSI -like formulaic crime drama.  The cases became old hat and standardized by the end of the season, and Sherlock's &#34;brilliant&#34; deductions are often lackluster.  This Sherlock doesn't really seem as much the genius as I'd say he should.  He comes across as a bit of a savant--good at picking puzzles apart, and with a flare for snooping.  And, thus far, the story has gone nowhere.  There are no villains left standing, no one who truly challenges Sherlock, and there is no actual plot that ties one episode to another aside from a blah-blah-blah-I'm-an-addict schtick.  At the end of each episode they give you a grey's anatomy song and get nice and sentimental about themselves.  It's as predictable as much of the dialog between an exasperated Watson and an overbearing Sherlock becomes.<br /><br />Overall, this show could, possibly, grow into a story and a show that has depth and range and something with a meatier entertainment value, but it's not there yet.  In fact, I was getting pretty bored by the end, and one of my roommates swore it off at the second to last episode (saying he couldn't keep watching the same story over and over). That  said, I did watch the entire season...the actors were well played and I'm, well, aglutton for Sherlock.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I would say this is going to be a great sequel. I loved not only the action in<br />This motive but the romance and drama. If you like the movies read the books<br />They're just as good.
B006YXTRHY|5.0|I have saw every sequence to this movie,  but the new one. Very very nice for excitement and fun. Great
B009CPJHY4|1.0|Not only did it not have a plot but it was slow.<br />Definitely not worth wasting ur money one or<br />Watching for that matter.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I did not play, my grandson I think he enjoyed the game.  No complaint from me. To must reply expected.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|I thought it was well done but not one of my favorites.<br />The reason I wanted to see it was the actors and actresses<br />In it. But I definitely think all ages could appreciate this movie.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|Auntie Mame DVD:<br />I know it's from 1957 but I love seeing how people were distinctly separated into classes with their prejudices and how one crazy woman tries to raise a boy to not fall into those trappings and to not be a snob.  Touching, heart-warming; I laugh, I cry.  I watch it every holiday season.  This DVD will replace my VHS format.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater  and wanted my girlfriends to see it, too.  We had a great girls night out to boot!  Daniel Craig is our personal favorite actor so it was an easy choice
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I did not like it because it is not well written, it is not interesting, sex is to much emphasized.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|This is a great app. My 10 yr old son love it. I would have given it 5 stars.... but the app requires internet to even play it at all. I wish the developer would make it stand alone until you get back in range of Wifi.
B005LAII8A|5.0|What is the perfect crime? I don't know if killing men sent from the future, and therefore unidentifiable, qualifies, but it's certainly close. Of course, if you should screw up somehow, those same people would know immediately. What then?<br /><br />  It's 2044, and while time travel has yet to be invented, those in the future use it to their advantage by sending individuals who threaten their business interests back to that time where they can be eliminated by men awaiting their arrival. The men who execute these unfortunate individuals are known as loopers. Joe Simmons (played by Joseph Gordon-Leavitt) is one such man. Simmons (Gordon-Leavitt) is in the employ of a mafia boss in Kansas City who he calls Abe (played by Jeff Daniels). Abe (Daniels) was sent back in time to manage the organization's hired guns as well as their other illicit operations as only someone from the future is uniquely equipped to do. When loopers have outlived their usefulness, they are sent back to be executed their younger self who receive payment in the form of gold rather than the customary silver. This is referred to as \\"closing your loop\\". In his spare time, Joe abuses drugs, maintains an intimate relationship with a showgirl named Suzie (played by Piper Perabo), frequents a club owned by his employer and is studying French to prepare for his eventual retirement in France. Things start going awry when Seth (Joe's friend and a fellow looper played by Paul Dano) is confronted with the task of closing his loop and fails. His superiors are more than a little displeased by this and so Seth goes to Joe, hoping his friend will hide him. Eventually, Seth is found, maimed, and his now disfigured older self is executed. This is after Seth and Joe both learn that a crime boss known only as The Rainmaker is behind the recent rash of closing loops. As Joe resumes his usual routine, he too is given the task of closing his loop when his older self (portrayed by Bruce Willis) appears before him. Joe's younger self cuts a message into his arm so that he can discuss the situation with his older self. Old Joe (Willis) confirms that The Rainmaker exists and is closing loops, in addition to killing the woman Joe would eventually marry. Both Joes are attacked by men working for their employer and flee, neither intending to do anything other than the task they set out to. Old Joe's being to kill The Rainmaker's younger self, young Joe's being to close his loop.<br /><br />  Obviously, this is a very complicated story. It's made even more so by characters I haven't mentioned yet. One of them played by the always talented Emily Blunt, the other by child actor and relative newcomer Pierce Gagnon. That said, I found it surprisingly good and highly entertaining. The complicated and paradoxical nature of sending someone back in time to be executed by their younger self as well as other questions about time travel are complicated and that is dealt with by a rather humorous line and then never brought up again. Thankfully. The story is gripping, the performances top-notch, and the conclusion leaves the audience wanting more and wondering what's next. This is a great film.'s younger self cuts a message into his arm so that he can discuss the situation with his older self. Old Joe (Willis) confirms that The Rainmaker exists and is closing loops, in addition to killing the woman Joe would eventually marry. Both Joes are attacked by men working for their employer and flee, neither intending to do anything other than the task they set out to. Old Joe's being to kill The Rainmaker's younger self, young Joe's being to close his loop.<br /><br />  Obviously, this is a very complicated story. It's made even more so by characters I haven't mentioned yet. One of them played by the always talented Emily Blunt, the other by child actor and relative newcomer Pierce Gagnon. That said, I found it surprisingly good and highly entertaining. The complicated and paradoxical nature of sending someone back in time to be executed by their younger self as well as other questions about time travel are complicated and that is dealt with by a rather humorous line and then never brought up again. Thankfully. The story is gripping, the performances top-notch, and the conclusion leaves the audience wanting more and wondering what's next. This is a great film.
B000SW4DXK|5.0|This movie has the charm of the old black and white one, but it's kind of nice to enjoy an updated, color version.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game it is amazing! This game is so much fun. I'm learning about ponies I didn't know the names to! So much fun! Thank you Gameloft!!!!!!!  :)  ^_^
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have read all of John Grisham's books.  I like his writing style & characters.<br />This is a fast paced story with twists & turns in the plot.  I thoroughly enjoyed the<br />book.
145210655X|5.0|Just buy it, it's a great book to not only dad's, but also Uncle's like me.  Buy Buy Buy Now
B005LAIHQS|4.0|Movie is good and worth a look see. Took away a star because I felt the first two were funnier, but the story is good.
B009X01GJ2|2.0|its ok.......fits and protects my fire hd perfectly but little things bother me about it........first, you cant recharge the fire hd without having the case open.  if you turn the fire hd around so that you can leave it closed, the ports are blocked........second, the elastic is put on backwards so that its not completely smooth when u use it to close the case........and yea i thought i just put it all together backwards, but i didnt
B00A6N8F4Y|5.0|Great movie.  I didn't even hear of this movie until it appeared on Amozan.  Amozan makes watching moview so easy.
B0091REZMW|4.0|good game but runs out of energy to fast.I downloaded the full version like it asked but nothing seemed to change.
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|have seen better movies the trailers were more funny than the actual movie was I do like Mark Walberg though
B006IDG2T6|5.0|I found this very short introduction to free will to be very informative. This book gives a good amount of information for people who are just about to research this subject or who want some vague idea of the argument put forth. A good starting point on a very big debate.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|The real action starts about half way through but it was believeable on a sci-fi espionage take.  It keep my interest sometimes these movies are a little to close to reality.
B003DT19F0|5.0|Great story! My daughter (2.5 years old) absolutely loves it, she even named her favorite doll Lizzy after one of the main characters.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Authenic, the true Dickens story, just what I was looking for!  My Granddaughter was assigned this book for school, which was my original reason for ordering it.  What a lifesaver.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|It did not make me feel involved in the movie or concerned with the characters, some of the action was interesting.
B005LAIIQC|4.0|Going into this movie I had thought that the main character was still Bourne himself (I had never read the books), and was a little disappointed that Matt Damon was being replaced...although I very much like Jeremy Renner and if I could have chosen one actor to replace Bourne it would have been him, so I held out some hope for the movie.  However, upon viewing the movie I realized that Renner was playing a completely different character and that the story just contained a matter that Bourne had been involved in, so it was one of the scenarios like \\"Oh, ok...I seen now.\\"<br /><br />Overall I found myself enjoying the movie, as did my dad, who I'd gone to see this with.  He and I both really enjoy the spy action type movies like these and the Bond movies & such and often go and see those types of movies together.  I felt the story was compelling and engaging, and I felt the overall acting within this film was top notch, especially on the part of Renner and Weisz.  If you really want a more in depth, detailed review of what I thought of the movie, read the 4 star rating at the top of the reviews by D.T. Jewett entitled A Movie In Search of a Director...I don't think I could have written a better review myself on this movie, and his opinion is basically about the same as I felt about the movie, give or take maybe one or two minor little things but it's overall about the same that I felt.<br /><br />To boil it all down, if you love spy thriller/action movies I recommend this!  If perhaps you have seen the past Bourne movies and are perhaps maybe just skeptical about this, especially considering it stars a different actor, don't be!  Renner did not replace Damon as Bourne...he's a completely different agent.  I went and picked this up day one when it released on Blu-Ray...it's great!
B00A0SLTCU|5.0|Great job on this film. Action packed ,blows away the cheesy Arnold version from the 1980's. would recommend this for sure.
B009K0P10K|5.0|This is a very complex show and very well done. I look forward to each new episode.The acting and characters are great.
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|This is an amazing movie!!  It really touches the heart!! Very fun to watch as well! Great acting from everyone!
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|I really enjoyed the cast of this movie.  I really think Tom Hardy is going to continue to do big things.  Guy Pierce's did a great job with his character as well.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I love every Harry Bosch novel and they just keep getting better and better.  What will Michael Connelly come up with next in the adventures of Harry!
B0043J08C4|5.0|Awesome movie for true Predator fans!  The movie has a good twist at the end as well.  They even have nice tie in to the original movie.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I have read every book by Patricia Cornwell but her last few have not been so very exciting.  This was just ok and I will keep reading, hoping for the return of the excitement in her earlier books
B009LRE040|5.0|Great movie!  I was really impressed with Tom Hardy, I thought he did an excellent job.  Christian Bale was great as usual.  They really had an all star cast for this film.  I would recommend this film to anyone.
B0086700CM|4.0|I thought this app was really fun and I enjoy playing it all the time with my brothers and they all liked it aswell
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is really fun.I hope u enjoy it you get to start out with games then you get to have points please just get this app its really fun
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|But worth the money at the price of 2 dollars. It's a wonderful stocking stuffer or small gift for an acquaintance.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Great movie! Snots the dog, unidentified lip fungus, and classy relatives from Kansas make this movie timeless!  We watch it every year.
B001F12J0C|5.0|This is my favorite action trilogy of all time. This set of DVDs is really great. It has all the special features I want without too many frills. The packaging is definitely giftable quality. I've purchased this as a gift for two people already and both absolutely loved it. It's a great set for the price.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|it is a bit graphic in some places with the blood, but overall this movie is amazing. I would reccommend it to everyone, but be cautious about the age of your children...you may want to fast forward a few times.
B0018CMJSU|5.0|this is the best movie I got it as a Christmas gift for my sister who loves the Godfather. This is a timeless classic great acting lots of action love this movie!
B0084TWN9K|5.0|These are wonderful. A short story can say so much in such a brief format, much like a poem. Munro is a writes beautifully.
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|This movie is funny and I didn't expect it to actually have a good story but it did. The conflict in the movie was rushed though.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Very good book!!!! I loved and laughed all throughout the story. Consider buying this book its a fast easy read and enjoyable.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|It's Boring And I Don't Get It LIKE It's Slow but Do It Have All The Words That A Regular Dictornary Do BecUse if It Do Then I'll Go Back And Read It But I Don't Think So
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|When reeding the book, I felt he started his story abrupt (blunt), but I still enjoyed the book.<br />I will recommend the book.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Loved this movie. Been looking forward to watching it since the trailer was released this summer. Rebel Wilson is amazing and Anna Kendrick pulled her character off perfectly. The music was good, and yeah, the movie was a li'l cheesy... But it was still definitely watchable.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Best series I've read in a long time.  Can't seem to do without a little Highlander in my daily reading.
B000FC10MU|4.0|A hard-to-put-down and very enjoyable read. A nice fantasy novel, sprinkled with allusions and reminding to dig deep in one's memory of mythology. The characters are easy to relate to and draw you in. Gaiman certainly has a message, but I didn't think it was the profound philosophical statement on the American spirit that some have taken it to be. Generally, highly recommend it.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Great story and well written.  I have read it two times now.  Also enjoyed the second book in the series.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|Just a quick note about how good Dark Knight Rises was the second time, this time at home on blu ray where more details and the behind the scenes content really added so much more to the experience.<br />The only reason I give the product one star less is this dropping of the more universal iTunes digital copy version for this clunky and complicated UV digital version that isn't really a digital version of your own, as I understand it. It's a crappy and misleading selling point that was very disappointing and I can't really use it conveniently like the previous iTunes digital add-ons to buying the blu ray.<br />We all know the movie industry will do anything they can to make a buck from the masses, but this UV corral they're herding us into is crappy.<br /><br />Well-thought-out and executed final chapter of the Nolan style Batman trilogy. I have a feeling they'll be teaching classes on it as \\"modern great literature as film\\" at Berkeley within the decade. :)
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is a well-thought out app that is full of features. I am very glad to have this one and it is the only alarm clock I need. I retired my other bedside clock.
B005EM8O8O|5.0|Just as Arthur C Clarke and Stanley Kubrick brought home the dangers of technological development in the 1960s, so to has Robert Harris given us a dark and gripping picture of where our financial markets could be heading. By weaving real events we have read about in the news into the plot, and ultimately ascribing them to a super-computer guiding a hedge fund, Harris spins a tale that is difficult to put down. The omniscient, omnipotent, networked computer generates its own cash on the capital markets and has significantly more success than did HAL in 2001 Space Odyssey. Who benefits from today's complex, volatile, crash-prone markets driven by computers trading at nanoseconds? The computers, naturally!
B004TI5N38|3.0|I am not always a Baldacci fan, but I think he has scored with his character, John Puller.  This was a suspenseful and well written book, and Puller is a very enjoyable character.
B002HK9IDQ|4.0|Released in 1964, at the end of Jack Warner's long career as a producer/ movie mogul, MY FAIR LADY still has the power to entertain and inspire. Audrey Hepburn might not have been the greatest choice to play Eliza - her Cockney accent is execrable, and her songs dubbed by Marni Nixon (even though the recent Blu-Ray version has footage of Hepburn actually trying to sing) - but she manages to capture the waif-life quality of the character. Rex Harrison and Stanley Holloway are definitive in their roles; once you have seen them, it's difficult to imagine anyone else performing them.  The orchestrations are lush, the choruses memorable, the score pure heaven. It's a long film, coming in at 170+ minutes, but can still appeal to viewers of all generations.
B000W44IZW|4.0|The movie magnificent and magical.  But I bought several as gifts, checking the product detail listing to see that the DVD could be viewed in N America.  The listing says &#34;all region.&#34;  The DVD says &#34;region 3.&#34;  You CAN watch it in a computer, but I had to include notes of apology and explanation with each gift, which is not really ideal.
B006H5120E|5.0|This was the most amazing 3d in my small collection. You must get it plus it's full screen 3d no letter box so crisp the most visually stunning 3d you will get today
0937381888|5.0|This book has become my favorite homebrew book.  It has lots of pictures that demonstrate grain brewing techniques.  As a fairly new all-grain brewer, I have found it an invaluable reference.  It also goes fairly deeply into the chemistry of brewing, so you know why you're doing what you're doing.  The recipes section is fairly short, but recipes are a dime a dozen.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|The detail is amazing.  You feel as though you know these people intimately. Gives you a new look at politics in a different era.
1439152802|4.0|Bubblebathbooks.net (aka Bubby and Sissy) love, love, love The Secret Keeper by Kate Morton - a riveting romantic historical mystery filled with stylish, flowing prose. Bubby especially enjoyed the seamless transitions through historical periods and now wants to be British whilst Sissy found herself transported into the story to the point where she had anxiety about the possible fates of the characters.  Another beautifully written story by Kate Morton. For full review, visit bubblebathbooks.net.
B003VIWO8Y|5.0|This book may seem like a cliche for Heavy Metal artists...Sex, Drugs and Rock n Roll, but I truly think Dave puts a lot of feeling into this book.  If you are a Megadeth...this is a must read.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|like everyone else, I can only see the forst handful of entries on my newsfeed now. Please fix this soon!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This is an exellent book with good character development.  Anyone who enjoyed &#34;The Help&#34; will like this book. You will not be disappointed.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|After the last few Scarpetta books, I really was not expecting much. But the book was actually a pleasure to read and I had a hard time putting it down. I know a lot of previous reviewers were annoyed about all the baggage of the various characters, but I didn't find it anywhere as in-your-face as in her previous two books. It somehow worked. I think Patricia Cornwell has gotten her groove back!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|It met all the conditions of  what it is supposed to do. In fact, it fits better in the new kindle than the USB cable that came with it.
B0001WTVUW|4.0|I remember the first time I saw this on tv.  And it stills scares me today.  It is a good & scary movie.  And sorry but this is the way I believe we're going to go.  We are going to nuke each other to bits & make this planet impossible to live on.  Scary movie.  Not for kids.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|This is a good sequel. This is more on par with the first movie. Not a dumper like the second one.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Interesting read. Thought I knew where the story was heading, but Grisham never fails to keep me reading thru the night.
B009GED3HS|5.0|Great streaming quality, no jumps or skips. Didn't buy the HD version of this, no need IMO. How I Met Your Mother is always a safe bet for a great show.
B00144VBBS|5.0|A great album by Toby Keith, good sound quality, arrived in great shape and right on the time that they said it would come
B0098VYCCE|2.0|Plenty of eye-candy but that's about it. I did not enjoy this film. I typically enjoy Charlize Theron, but was a bit surprised to see her in this film... Not good.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|I read the book twice before seeing the movie and once after the first time I saw it. My husband has watched this movies with me twice! It is a typically sappy love story but it is also a very good story about how people deal with the pitfalls of life. James Garner is fantastic in this movie. I think it is one of his finest performances even though he and Genna Rowlands actually have more supporting roles, the movie couldn't be made without them. Definitely worth seeing over and over. Not just for the beautiful love story of the young people, but for the genuine love story of the older generation as well.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Worth the rental fee. . . . . . . . . . . . . . I can't make this review any longer.
B0053O89RY|5.0|Since season 1 I've fallen in love with Modern Family. It seems each season just gets better and better. High quality family entertainment.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I've been a fan of The Piano Guys for a long time. When they came out with this album, I pre-ordered it and it didn't disappoint. I listen to it all of the time.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|A GREAT show! Everyone should watch!My new all time favorite. It actually makes you believe in magic and fairytales.Watch,can't say enough.
B002HJ9PTO|2.0|The instructions were poor and I couldn't get it to work for me. I tried it with several cameras. I know that there are people that swear by it and it is probably user error, but I just couldn't figure this one out.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I love this game but it wont download right. I'm really sad because the game itself is great. I wish it would download right!
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I bought this for my husband for Christmas last year. It was a huge hit. He carries it around all the time and constantly uses it. I just won an iPad Mini as a prize (I already had an IPad one) and my husband wasn't even tempted to ask me if he could have it. He's satisfied with his Kindle Fire.
B004P91ARE|5.0|A must have for anyone interested in true music & genius. With Dave's passing, I needed a new copy.  Terrific.
B001LF3YQK|3.0|it was difficult for me to figure out how to close the red button, until i realised you cant. its a latch that is pushed up. it is ver useful.
B0041D843M|5.0|The China Study is very informative re: diet versus diseases, especially heart and cancer. Provides statistics including graphs to back his claims that a &#34;plant-based diet&#34; is far superior to a &#34;meat-based diet&#34; for curing and preventing the aforementioned diseases
B009JBZH54|5.0|The best batman movies ever. The package is excellent and the quality of the movie es great. This a colector item
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, it was a cute story, the story line wasnt too bad. Overall great book to read.
B005SO6TLM|5.0|Stands up to the classic sounds from the 60's; if you like classic blues masters, give this a listen, you will not regret it.
0375812024|5.0|My great-grandchildren are enjoying this book. They have an airport in their small<br />town and also a slightly larger one in the town near them. I hope they will go there<br />and see planes and find out all about them!  This is a good way to present air travel<br />to children - lots of bright pictures and answers to questions...Richard Scarry always<br />has just the right way to teach and show.
1401937268|5.0|Interesting how when doing a reading with these cards how the message that comes thru is aprpos to the questions being asked.
B004LWZW7O|5.0|I enjoyed the movie.. If you like Justin Timberlake, you will enjoy this movie.<br /><br />It took a while for the item to arrive, but I was kept in constant communication about the back order.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|loveeeee my fifty! so easy to order right to my kindle ~ love it! great ending to a series but i want more!
B009KHBDUU|4.0|Johnny Depp is hilarious in this movie.  It was better than I expected.  If you are looking for a laugh I would recommend this movie.
B004G5ZY7E|4.0|i have read older jo nesbo books since getting this, i recommend reading  his earlier works first in order to be more aware of the charactors
B007N9FKCY|2.0|The little bean constantly jumps while you navigate him left or right avoiding obstacles and collecting gems.  It reminded me of Mario Bros. except Mario wouldn't be still long enough for me to move him where I needed.  I got frustrated quickly.  I only played the first level and then uninstalled it.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|Great story lines good interaction between the actors one of my favorite series Its one of the best series on TV
B0071XO8RA|4.0|A while back I read Wool 1-5 for free using my Prime Membership. It's a fun read so I added it to my library.  I think it will be an annual read.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|I didn't realize how charming this story was until I verbally told it to a friend and had him laughing out loud and wide eyed at the tale of the incongruities of the old man with his Forrest Gump type of life.  This book made me think that life is often best enjoyed by not thinking too hard and certainly not judging too much.
B008NB0SQO|2.0|When I first read the book &#34;No easy Day&#34; by Mark Owen (The infamous release that recounts the mission to kill Osama Bin Laden), he particularly channled a recurring theme in the life of many: a concept called the &#34;Good Idea Fairy.&#34; This &#34;fairy&#34; was the tendency for the passiviely uninvolved to suddenly involve themselves in a mission at the last minute--a mission that has already been tried, trued, and calibrated--and suddenly change the calculus, throwing everyone's game off and possibly ruining the entire mission--all in the name of &#34;progress.&#34;<br /><br />Well, it looks like that diminutive knave showed up at Henson Inc.  Because they've gaffed the ONE movie--the ONE movie I have actively anticipated on Blu-ray. With ONE three-minute omission.<br /><br />Somewhat distracted, I didn't even notice it, as I brought it straight home, and began watching it with my family (which for us is now a 13-year tradition since I first had it loaned to me on VHS in 1999).  My eleven-year-old immediately said &#34;Dad! They took the song out!&#34; She then began to sing the melody, and I'm like &#34;they sure did. I wonder why.&#34; Supposedly, the omission was made to accommodate kids.  Mine noticed the problem like a noonday mugging. In terms of one-family, anecdotal data: Mission Failed.<br /><br />And wonder, I do. Now my inner-cynic says that there is now one more opportunity to capitalize on guys like me, who will immediately buy a &#34;fixed&#34; version, because the transfer to Blu-ray is immediately noticable in its qualitative aspects, and the 1080p ratios are perfect--the cinematic feel to this thing is fantastic.  The sound has also come up a few notches, too. Possibly the best songs ever written for any one of their films.<br /><br />The fact that this post-Jim film is perhaps better than any film directly handled directly by Jim Henson is actually a testament to Henson himself. Despite the fact that his son was the directorial heir-apparrent, and had never done so before, the sheer weight of trying to go to theater a mere two years after the death of Kermit's literal soul must have been daunting; merely trying to compensate for the voice of a number of characters--not to mention the subtleties of expression and hand movements that will never be replaced--would have made many buckle and call it a day.<br /><br />But the standard--along with chronological proximity--guaranteed that Frank Oz and the crew would pour themselves into the legacy like never before.  One can also see a contemplative tribute to Henson in the falling star observed by Kermit when he's troubled about the world in general. This is why many will say this is the best Muppet movie of all time. At least I will.<br /><br />So why remove the song? The now-omitted &#34;When Love Is Gone,&#34; written by Paul Williams, falls victim to an active decision to &#34;revert&#34; to an original, cinematic state.  But this makes no sense, since very few actually saw it in the theaters, and every release to video has included the song (which, by the way is reprised at the end after Scrooge's tranformation, along with a lyrical one as well--the reprise now sits alone with no referential place). The song provides the romantic, referential sadness inherent in Scrooge's past.  Taking out the song is the equivalent to removing &#34;supercalifragilisticexpialidocious&#34; from &#34;Mary Poppins.&#34;<br /><br />One can only guess that--like I predict with Apple--the inherencies that made them great are but mere echoes; that their decompositional processes started when their true visionaries left us. And yet, I hold out hope for both.<br /><br />Two stars from me. I certainly hope that Brian Henson and crew will release an ameliorated version sometime, with the same qualities galvanized into this one. It will immediately gain five stars from nearly all.  I keep hoping that some &#34;easter egg&#34; hammered within the disc reveals a true version.  But quite frankly, even if it does, I'm not inclined to accept entering a whimsical labyrinth to see it.<br /><br />Somebody, please.  Kill the Good Idea Fairy. Thank you.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Is fun and without ads, much easier to play. Would like more versions. What more can I say? Good Fun.
B000W91RUG|5.0|Una de las mejores series comicas de los ultimos tiempos. No tiene desperdicio alguno por donde se lo mire. Altamente recomendable. Cordoba, Argentina.
B005IQZB14|4.0|I enjoyed Cheryl's hike over the PCT.  Her vivid discriptions of the trail, her determination to keep going, the  people she encountered on her journey were captivating.it was a good read.
B0016BPWNM|5.0|Realmente volví a mi infancia apenas puse el disco en mi ps3. Un mundo magico y lleno de sensaciones que he disfrutado de chico y no mucho menos de grande. Cordoba, Argentina.
B003Q6D1YW|4.0|This movie was worth the money. Just recently I have gotten into documentaries and Catfish is what started my obsession. Of course I didn't give it 5 stars, and the reason behind that, was it lacked any plot twist. I kind of knew what was going to happen. But hey, it is a documentary for a reason right?
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Espectacular edicion especial de una de las sagas mas completas de la historia del cine de ciencia ficcion. Totalmente recomendable. Argentina.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Wonderful book.  good choice for someone who has just lost a loved one.  Has a nice poem I have  copied to be used when I die.  Powerful book.  Written by an expert but very understandable to layman.  Highly recommend it.
B002M9WW30|5.0|Rocky, hace falta decir algo mas? De las mejores sagas de la historia, salvo la 4 y la última, de lo mejor del cine. Cordoba, Argentina.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app has been very helpful with all types of math. I highly recommend it for everyone. Very easy to use also.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I think Mr Follett has stepped up his game in Fall Of Giants.  After finishing this book, I immediately ordered book two; Winter of the World.  I'm anxiously awaitng the final book
B002VECM4A|4.0|This is yet another movie of sadness and negativity. You will either find this movie hard to watch or informative. It captures a part of life which underprivileged women (mainly from minority groups) experience. I didn't find it as hard to watch as Colored Women but yes it reveals complications in the lives of women on many levels.
B009HELT3C|4.0|Quality over our tv through Xbox was perfect.  Family movie.  Funny.  I would recommend this movie to families and MIB enthusiasts.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|it was easy to read i enjoyed it i wonder would it realy happen ,a happy and enterining to read
034580404X|4.0|I bought this trilogy for a friend.  I read the book myself on my kindle and did not care for it.  I was bored after the first book but kept reading, then skimming.  My friend  has enjoyed it and said it is a very easy read.  Arrived on time and in new packaging.
B005XN31LY|5.0|This show may not appeal to everyone- but it sure has captured my attention and I consider myself a difficult audience.  The first episode you can tell is done on a low budget with costuming and special effects, but as the season grows on, with it's characters, it seems to pull you in- if you have the patience.  I would say Season One of this show has it's &#34;highs&#34; and &#34;lows&#34; because each episode seems to be about a different storybook character.  Some were done better than others.  You tell yourself, ok, I'm making an &#34;investment&#34; in time here (like reading a book) because sometimes the show slows down a bit and focuses on little meanings and such that you as a consumer may not care about or relate to.  The largest story- Emma, the &#34;savior&#34; threads into every episode as well as Snow White and the &#34;Queen&#34; Regina.  Good show if you're just trying to pass time you will find it has highs and lows.  I LOVE suspense so I'm not as glued to the screen as I was when watching &#34;Revenge,&#34; another ABC show.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|This is a typical game of this genre, and very fun. The reason I only give 4 stars is because there are some quirks to the game that are frustrating, such as counting moving the screen around as a click. Other than that, this is an enjoyable app.
B004UPAIKI|4.0|The only reason why I gave this 4 stars- is because they left a lot open-ended.  Once Michelle Pfeiffer really started reaching out to the students and it started working, it seemed to fast forward to them having to take another class because now they were honors students. The movie takes a long time to build up in the beginning.  It seems kind of unrealistic that her character could just walk into a classroom like that and because she could teach them karate she caught their attention.  But it got better in once it started focusing on individual kid's stories, that's when I started to really get into it.  Overall good movie, definitely sparks up some emotion!
B001RPD06I|5.0|Nice product !!!  I love it!  ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !!! good,good !!!
B009JZTOG8|4.0|Going into season 2, there is a lot going on with the world of &#34;once upon a time.&#34;  It kind of lacks in that if you haven't watched season one- you will have NO idea what is going on.  They do introduce a lot of new storybook characters though; which thicken the plot.  Season one focused on one character at a time and kind of built a story- which was divine.  Season two starts becoming a bit scattered- not bad, but just a lot to keep up with.  I do not like how they keep going on different angles of Snow White and the Witch, you start to loose track of what time and where their interactions even begin with.  Rumpelstilskin; however, remains a strong character, which I like, and his motive is clear and strong.  I only gave this season 4 stars because they REALLY jump around a lot and unless you're an avid fan, you're not going to appreciate the ironic situations the show is trying to create (which are good,) but it kind of makes you feel lost in the sauce sometimes.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Yep new favorite.  Was not expecting some of the twists and turns but man oh man what a great book.  Won't give any spoilers but I live you is my new favorite quote.
B004EWFUQY|4.0|This diet, if you should stick with it, is very easy to follow especially if you like to cook and bake from scratch. it really retrains you how to eat and cook healthy meals. I got the cookbook as well although I have found that I prefer blogger recipes..the seasonings in the cookbook are sometimes over worked. But I've finally conquered a 40lb plateau!
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|I really thought that this movie would be hillarious.  It was slightly funny at best.  The party scene was probably the funniest part of the movie.
B0026IUXO2|5.0|This is a great movie.  I first decided to buy it after watching The Other Boelyn Girl.  Cate Blanchett made a remarkable Elizabeth.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|This was the funniest movie I've seen in a long time. Really enjoyed it. It is going to be a definite buy.
B005COO1X6|5.0|Started out kinda slow but boy did it ramp up fast, could not put it down till I was done!  Typical King take no hostages thriller!  His &#34;constant readers&#34; will like this one.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I absolutely love this app. I use it all the time. I used it for weddings, birthday gifts, Christmas, etc. I love the variety of choices you have for all my Seattle Seahawks stuff!
B0097NGUJG|5.0|a station i wouldn't expect to play this kind of music was talking about all the press it was getting, then played fitzpleasure. at first, i was like what is this? and then i was hooked. went home listened to the samples and bought the whole thing.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I couldn't put it down. Really enjoyed it! Much more humor than I expected.I particularly enjoyed the ending. Best book I've read since The Hunger Games.
B003QP4NPE|5.0|&#34;Daemon&#34; by Daniel Suarez is a real adrenaline rush! Erudite, intense, dark, brisk pacing, tightly drawn storyline, richly developed protagonists, and edge-of-your-seat situations. Plausible and effortless writing style makes for an entertaining tho frenetic reading experience that will leave you perspiring, worn out, and wanting more...WOW, so buckle up and get ready for a wild a ride...5 stars!!!
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I hadn't read Little Women since I was in middle school so it was nice reading it as adult.  I was planning a trip to Concord, MA so I wanted to read it prior to touring the actual Alcott house.  I think I enjoyed it so much because of the combination of seeing the historic house and my perspective as an adult.  It is a solid classic American story and if you have never read it, you should.
B008GOG98Y|5.0|Hadn't watched this movie since it came out but it was fun to see again. Over 30 years have gone by and it still is great to watch.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is one of those books that even though they are at times so painful, and heart wrenching, you come out the end of it feeling like you have changed as a person because of reading it.    **also, My only negative. I feel a disclaimer is needed for the heavy and sometimes very sensitive issues this book deals with.    There are very few books that move me in a way I know I will be forever changed. It's rare that you become so engrossed into their world, you don't just forget it is fiction--you feel as if you are one with them. And then, then you remember that this book, these situations, these feelings--they aren't fiction. This is as real life as it gets. I found myself constantly thinking, you have NO idea what goes on in someone's personal life. You have no idea what past nightmares people are dealing with. I feel was so deeply touched because Hoover, once again, has such a sensitive and perfectly tackled approach to writing real life. It doesn't seem like fiction, it seems like...well, life.    From the beginning you know there is more to Sky Davis than meets the eye. I loved her wit, humor and sarcasm. I loved her friendship with Six. I loved her ability to let the small petty immature high school s*** in life roll off her shoulders. But, even with all there is to love, you know...deep down you know, she is surviving not living. Enter Dean Holder, swoon worthy hottie, with a rumored questionable temper and issues. I loved how Hoover described Sky's thoughts when she first saw him!    \\"As soon as I lay eyes on him, I immediately notice three things: 1) His amazingly perfect white teeth hidden behind that seductively crooked grin. 2) The dimples that form in the crevices between the corners of his lips and cheeks when he smiles. 3) I'm pretty sure I'm having a hot flash. Or I have butterflies. Or maybe I'm coming down with a stomach virus.\\"    They first few chapters of them meeting, connecting, and learning each other were absolutely hands down perfect. I lovedwatching them. Hello! Dinner Quest, hilarious idea but what a genius way to \\"get to know\\" someone. For someone like Sky, the thought of this \\"instant connection is so utterly foreign so doesn't know what to do with it.    \\"Somehow, in the corse of sixty seconds, this guy has managed to swoon me, then terrify the hell out of me.\\"    And Holder, Jesus Christ on a cracker. Not only is he probably one of my favorite YA heros ever now, but this man boy knew what to say, how to swoon, and holy moly knew how to melt a girls panties.    \\"The moment my lips touch yours, it will be your first kiss. Because if you've never felt anything when someone's kissed you, then no ones ever really kissed you. Not the way I plan on kissing you.\\"    He did not disappoint. Oh no he didn't. Not only was he hands down perfect when it came to swooning and romance, but when the touch stuff started hitting the fan, he was there. Ere with unwavering support and unconditional love. Stuff every girl dreams of finding in their perfect mate.    These characters were so tightly knitted together with some unknown and unthinkable connections, I was left gasping and shaking and shocked. There is so many things that fate stepped in and made happen. Some many paths crossed and lives changed. Part of me is in awe, because I know it take a true master of writing to create such a world. To think of every single detail, twist, turn and turn it in to something so deep and moving. I am never let down when it comes to Hoover's books.    Even though this story was very hard at times to emotionally read, I am so glad I stuck it out. Holder and Sky have this connection that very few people, even those deeply in live or love every find. The life time connection of two soul mates. Two people that despite all the odds and challenges life threw at them always found a way back to each other.    Now, my little message of hope to Ms. Hoover--please don't let this be the end for them. Don't get me wrong, I loved the ending...it was perfect for this story. But, I crave and want so badly to watch them continue this beautiful path together. A forever kind of love like theirs deserves to have more. (And I would love some more Six...I smell one amazing story with her!)
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|Good movie but I got charged twice for it.I had topause it and then restarted it.It wasn't THAT good! How do I get reimbursed?
B0002VFXFE|3.0|After opening and trying to use noting came out. It was plugged with a big chunk of something. After clearing the clog I found that half the paste was solidified and formed the clog.  Still enough to use but what a waste & a pain.
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|Not as good as the previous &#34;Bourne&#34; movies. Jeremy Renner did a good job. I hope they plan to make more with this theme.
B0009UC7H0|5.0|Good movie.
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|The humor could have still been there with out all the vulgarity. Was not what I expected. Other than that I did like it.

B0070Y46UY|3.0|Had its moments where I couldn't put it down. Other times it felt like it was being dragged on.  All in all it was a good book.
B00AC8ZJPQ|4.0|Movie is mostly about cadets. Master Chief does not appear until about the last 15 min.<br />My wife, who did not have a clue about Halo, thought it ended too soon and wanted to see more.<br />  I can forgive only if the next movie is more action/adventure.
034580404X|5.0|I read the book first and my nephew wanted to read it so, I sent him the Trilogy set and enjoyed it also, said he found a few new tricks he wanted to try.
B000RHG4XS|5.0|So much better than the originial, in my opinion.  For my generation (20 somethings), this movie is much more relatable than the original.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Action packed from start to finish! Leaves you waning more. Really good movie.  Worth renting or buying. Great gift. Loved it.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have this on my phone and tablet. It comes in very handy, especially the vs of the day! I enjoy the devotionals as well.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Just when I thought this was going to end in a predictable way, and I was getting the &#34;oh, this is just an okay book&#34; feeling, the author pulled it all together for a four star rating.
B008LY9AWG|2.0|Stories were short, and over before they got interesting.  Never really got my attention .  I do like Michael Connelly, though.
B00A0HQ9GM|4.0|I just came across this artist's music last week by accident when checking out the pop charts via i-Tunes. After hearing all the snippets, I was instantly hooked and bought the extended Paradise Edition! She reminds me of Alanis Morriset and Adelle, but with a more mature voice. The beats are awesome and the lyrics rock. She got me steamed up in hot hits like \\"Cola\\" and \\"Gods and Monsters\\" with her sexual references. Definitely a nice album to add to anyones collection! You better grab it now while its on sale for just $5.99, what a great deal!
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book has saved my life. I removed modern wheat and wheat products from my diet and lost nine pounds the first week. My blood sugars are in the normal range and my energy is amazing.As a diabetic for almost 40 years and down from five shots a day to two, I am beyond happy. Warning: we are killing ourselves with our daily bread.But having said that I suggest you read it for yourself and try it.
0062073508|5.0|Each character is someone you'd want to know better (especially, of course, M Poirot).  This book was so much fun to read I was actually sad that I'd finished it.  I'd never have guessed the ending in a million years.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Suzanna Collins is a very tallented writer without a doubt. Read all 3 books in order. Knowing the games could not last forever, I enjoyed the characters and story line was great. Wished they could have went on forever. Can't wait to see the 2nd movie and can only hope a 3rd movie will be in the making.
B00632HWOG|1.0|With the recent upgrade, this worthless app doesn't work on my Kindle Fire.<br />I'm giving up and using the utility. Thanks for nothing Yahoo.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|An entertaining novel that connects you with the main character rooting for his survival and discoveries. Not much in the book gives you an indication of the surprise ending.
B000PHX4VA|5.0|All these songs bring back great memories. They actually did a pretty good job compiling the best songs by The Police. I have these CDs in my vehicle now and I sing along while driving to/from work.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This was one of the best and funniest books of all time. my favorite book in the series. I loved it
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I liked the book, but it was so technical in some part's that I found my attention wavering; although, I understand why the author felt the need to put in the technical and medical jargon but I did find it to be a distraction. I really, really wanted to be inspired by this book and the author's experience, but I just wasn't. I'm not sure why.  Do I believe everything that he wrote? Mostly. I do believe there is a God and for the most part things happen for a reason and that there is evil in the world and as the author stated, evil is necessary to have free will. Evil certainly was present in Ct on Friday the December 14th. I do recommend this book for anyone questioning their faith in God.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|I think Ridley Scott relied too much on his &#34;smoky, low-audio discourse, darkly-photographed with horrific creatures&#34; formula that was so successful in Alien and Blade Runner.  What for this one to come to a subscription viewing source (Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc).
B008KZX8C4|5.0|Two Door Cinema Club has quickly become one of my favorite bands. The High-tempo beats, popping bass lines, and rhythm guitar found on their first album &#34;Tourist History&#34; are developed into a richer and more mature sound on &#34;Beacon&#34;. Top to bottom the tracks are solid and for those interested in the vinyl format, the added warmth really makes this album sound great (and comes with a link to a free download of a version ripped from vinyl).
B009VB7QQA|2.0|Good premise,  but the cast couldn't pull it off.  Wait for this to come to a subscription streaming  service like Netflix or Amazon Prime.
B005D63ICI|5.0|I really enjoy watching every show. I'm hooked. I love the actors. They do such a great job and the writing is the best. I'm going to be sad when it's over.
B0098VYKSA|3.0|The movie was kinda slow and plodding, but the special effects helped keep it moving along.  Probably best to wait for this to come to a subscription streaming service (Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc)
1881273156|5.0|I love all the love language books! They are great books to give away and read every now an again.
B00AMBLDEE|2.0|Being an outrageously huge fan of the Jason Bourne series, and having seen the first three, I gave this a look just compare with the trilogy Matt Damon, Paul Greengrass and Doug Liman did; WOW......what a difference!!  Even giving Jeremy Renner credit for trying to follow up such a incredible series of films, this film was weak.  The story line was a little confusing and the performers all seemed like they were sleep-walking through their roles.  All-in-all, leave this one for when it comes on TV for free, or as part of an existing streaming subscription you may have (Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc), where you won't have to pay anything for it......like I did.
0671015206|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was slow in a few spots or me but something i'm glad that i read through.
B005DOJ68K|5.0|Unless you already have all their albums, this is a must have. If you are old school this is a trip down memory lane.
B0063IH60K|4.0|fun but not too hard. Good to play while waiting for appointments or kids. I like that I can ask for a hint.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Tim Ferris' latest book is another enthusiastic intersection of mountains of researched information and the usefully sifted actions that make use of that information.<br /><br />I am being educated, entertained, and motivated.
0545265355|5.0|Glad to have been part of the 30for30 ESPN project.  It nearly cost me my life.  Started with my book.  The Diverted Verdict.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|Lots of pot smoking and the f word a lot. Certainly not for kids of any age.  Had some odd sexual things too.
B007Y36K46|4.0|I'm not sure why this movie was given so many bad reviews. It was a lot of fun.<br />It's true, there were moments of \\"cheezy-ness\\" but the movie was full of action and really a bit different from other sci-fi movies.<br /><br />Plot: 5 out of 5 stars<br />F/x: 4 out of 5 stars<br />characters/acting: 4 out of 5<br /><br />I think you will really enjoy the movie if you rent or purchase it.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I can't get enough of this character in Connelly's books and this book is no exception.  The author gives such importance to the details, takes his time to deliver a very honest and exciting story.
B008FRFN7A|4.0|It is really easy to set up and run. Works like a dream, and I have had no problems so far.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The emotions are so visceral and the story is so compelling, I read this in a day. Amazingly well done. I can't wait to read her other books.
B007BT0RKG|2.0|Shows map decent, but you must keep clicking zoom in to be able to see a decent sized map.  Also I did not see any way to find out where you are in relation to home.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is a delightful movie.  At first I saw it with several women at the theater, liked it so much and bought it.  I got my husband to watch it with me.  He was pleasantly surprised.  It was tender, funny, filled with lessons to be learned, too.  We both loved it.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Shows up nicely at night and is very east to set up and operate.  Unless you get the paid version, there is some advertizement that shows up on the bottom, but is it free, so no problem there as far as I am concerned.  Really like that the alarm will go off even if your Kindle is at rest, which saves the battery.  Good one, especially if you travel.
B000K09OL6|5.0|This is a great activity for the kids and for the whole entire family.  I gave this to my 5 year old son for his birthday. He immediately put down the star wars book and started building a tower with my 7 year old.  They he wanted to build a garage for his remote control car.  We played with these at a museum in San Diego so I knew they existed.  I had a difficult time finding this product through a search, but luckily I did!  280 blocks is a good amount, but I am already eyeing the monster box of 1000 so I can build that huge bridge with a train on top. :)
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Works well for a basic unit.  Nice to have on hand if you are traveling or just to have around when you need to do come calculating.  Would recommend.
B009E2U7L2|5.0|Saw her initial performance on XFactor UK and could not stop watching her videos through the season. She's got a great voice, attitude and look. I know a bunch of these songs are going mainstream now, and I'm sure many more will also go. Album also seems to stay true to the artist she wanted to be when she began her journey on XFactor, which is something I don't think always happens on these shows.
B00AMBM9MO|2.0|I like Mark Wahlberg but was disappointed in this movie.  I felt they could have made it more family friendly.  The language was crude and not appreciated at all by me.  I guess this may be more of a 'guy' movie.
B005LAIGZU|4.0|Act of Valor is an amazing movie. In this movie the SEALs rescue a CIA operative who has been taken hostage. The intelligence information recovered on the rescue sets the SEALs off on a chase to hunt down terrorists who plan to sneak suicide bombers wearing suicide vests that are unable to be seen by metal detectors in to the United States.<br /><br />In addition to the amazingly well done intense action, the movie does give viewers a glimpse of the home life of some of the guys in the unit. The only drawback is that the scenes at home aren't long enough. I cared about the two main characters the movie focuses on but not as much as I would have if the characters lives at home were more well developed. The most emotionally intense scenes come at the end of the movie and made me proud that we have Americans who put their lives on the line every single day to keep this country safe.<br /><br />I found the action scenes very believable. This isn't Rambo type stuff, the movie shows how careful the SEALs operate and try to achieve the goals of the mission with as much stealth and as little risk to American lives as possible. On the other hand, the movie also shows that while special operations teams have access to advanced technology like drones, most of their work still involves them putting their lives on the line in close quarters with the enemy.
B0018OIK0E|5.0|Love this movie.  It is funny, has a few heartwarming moments, and is gross, just as a zombie movie should be.
0394800184|5.0|Classic book by a classic author - I've never met a kid who didn't enjoy saying &#34;nooooo&#34; to &#34;are you my mother?&#34; on each page.
B008UFUOH6|3.0|Although each song is lovely in its own way, there's a certain similarity to the rhythm and tempo when they are listened to as a whole.
B000FC1K66|4.0|Written from the angle of coming to terms with the contradiction of personal experience of a woman versus her involvement in the Nazi concentration camps. Sheds some psychological insight on the experience of the next generation.  Well written as well.
B008NR8YTQ|5.0|You would think its Jimi himself playing. worth owning. Some classic Hendrix tunes with some great guitar playing on this one
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love this game.  It is very addictive and fun.  The pause and undo features are nice.  The tiles are distinctive so it's easy to play.
B001EBWING|5.0|good flick and a must have . Everyone should add this one their home collection of DVD's, thats for sure.
B006GG1KOC|3.0|It is okay for young children.  My granddaughter is 5 and this bores her, so i would not recommend it for children who are 4 and over
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|I just finished up this game and it was one of the best.  It had great graphics and I had no problems with the game being slow or freezing up.  I loved that it had a surprise extra adventure.  I can't wait to start a new game!
B009KS4XRO|1.0|It is boring and no fun at all for anyone. I would not recommend this to anyone.  There isn't anything fun about it.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I'm really enjoying this game, I like that there is a goal with trying to fill the puzzle! I'm slowly but surely figuring out the prizes, but I would definitely recommend it!
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Great Movie I would say probably one the best Men in Black Yet they have done a great job at keeping the original stars.
B008KRJWEK|5.0|this is the best game ever that is free and full of zombies . just like zombie highway. i love this app. i told all my friends
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|There just like digital notebooks. Pretty cool. I recommend it. You can make as many notebooks as you want :)
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Sure its basically a long and uncensored family guy but who can complain about that. Its definitely worth renting for a one time watch and a good laugh.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|So here's the thing...there's a lot of sex in this book (spoiler alert, haha). But honestly, that's about all that's in this book. Very little plot, small vocabulary...I don't know how anyone understands each other in this book with all the muttering and murmuring going on. It was so annoying to me I searched the word murmur on my kindle and came up with 277. Using one word 277 times in one book is a little ridiculous. Mutter was used over 100 times.<br />But, if you just want hot sex scenes, and don't care too much about plot or writing style, you'll probably like this book. Of note, the writing gets better in the second and third books, but the murmuring and muttering does not ;)
0345803485|3.0|I have read the trilogy and I will say thst I thought the final book was the best. The first one did not really qppeal to me, the second began to have a plot and the third answered lots of questions. I read the books because a friend recommended them to me. Once I start a book or books I usually finish them. Because there was so much hype about these I was determined to read these. The book I bought was a gift for a friend. I prpbably would not recommend it highly to a friend.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|The story is rich with subtle plots and exquisite character development.  The reader comes away with tangible empathy for the characters and feeling invested in their fates as well as the outcome of this wondrous adventure.
B007D2XSW0|2.0|I would love it but unfortunately it won't apply any of the &quot;extras&quot; to my photos on the kindle fire hd.  All it allows me to do is filter and edit photos.  Pretty disappointed I can't use any of the fun stickers and text.
0425252868|5.0|A Higher Call by Adam Makos: Review by Tom Gauthier<br />How often do you have trouble reading the last page of an action packed war story because of the blur of tears? First time for me, as I finished Adam Makos new book A Higher Call.<br />After eight years of painstaking research, Makos has produced a singular piece of work: the true and incredible story of two pilots who locked eyes--and I feel locked souls--across a span of deadly sky over Nazi Germany in 1943, changing the fortunes and the futures of all who were there.<br />Adam Makos provides us a close-up of the American experience, before during and after this incident. But he also, and in marvelously rich detail, gives us a rare look into the machinations of the Luftwaffe, again, before the war and through to the very end.<br />.... Engines failed, damage was extensive to flight surfaces, yet under the strong hands of their young pilot, Charlie Brown, the ship remained precariously in the air. Back in the plane's fuselage the crew was bravely caring for each other--some with grievous wounds. As they approached the European coastline, Charlie knew that any moment the coastal flak guns would open up and finish them off.<br />Suddenly, from behind and below them a FW-109 climbed up from the treetops and began its attack run on the helpless Pub. With all guns frozen the crew could only watch with the resignation of pending death. At the controls of the 109, Franz Stigler, an experienced ace saw the target that would raise his \\"kill\\" count. But he didn't kill. I will not herein tell you what transpired in the minds of the American airman or the German pilot. It is something you must read for yourself and let it sink in to your soul, as I did.<br /><br />Charlie Brown and Franz Stigler survived the war. There was no official mention of Stigler's saving Ye Olde Pub in American records. In Germany, he could say nothing and hope no one recognized his plane from the ground--or it would be a firing squad for him.<br />The story of their meeting decades later and the ability to share the personal feelings of all who were touched by the incident near Christmas 1943 over Germany. Here's where I began to tear up.<br />Adam Makos has brought us an action packed adventure story. But he has done it through the eyes, souls, fears, and personal travails of both the Germans and the Americans. Yes it's a war story, but more than that it's a warriors' story--humanized but not trivialized like we've never seen before. Vicious and deadly battle could not snuff chivalry and a higher call. It's is so good to be reminded of this through a real life story.<br />A Higher Call is a must read.<br /><br />Dr. Tom Gauthier, MBA, Psy.D.<br />International Award Winning Novelist<br />Co-host of Military Author Radio<br />Military Writers' Society of America<br />U.S. Air Force Veteran/>The story of their meeting decades later and the ability to share the personal feelings of all who were touched by the incident near Christmas 1943 over Germany.

Yes it's a war story, but more than that it's a warriors' story--humanized but not trivialized like we've never seen before. Vicious and deadly battle could not snuff chivalry and a higher call. It's is so good to be reminded of this through a real life story.<br />A Higher Call is a must read.<br /><br />Dr. Tom Gauthier, MBA, Psy.D.<br />International Award Winning Novelist<br />Co-host of Military Author Radio<br />Military Writers' Society of America<br />U.S. Air Force Veteran
0316069434|3.0|It was a good story. It sems to me that this book was setting up the next novel. I did enjjoy it and like all Michael Connelly books easy to read.
B005JZBPHS|5.0|Great series. Sadly that it does not go anymore.<br />But I do recommend it, even thought, if you are not gay.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Rented this for a car trip to watch on my Kindle Fire.  I loved it and so did my 15 year old .  It may be too intense for the under 5 crowd.  The triplets stole the show!
B0096RUN5A|5.0|I love all the songs on this CD.  Carley Rae Jepsen ROCKS big time!!  (Wow, Wow, Wow, Wow, Wow, Wow, sorry but that was to fill the required number of words for a review)
B007HACDLK|5.0|Great book, had me from the start!  Love the characters and the plot!  He has done it again, must read!
B0067QPVJ6|2.0|I was really hesitant about watching this movie. The original Thing from 1982 has always been my top favourite survival horror movie. I heard a lot of not so good things about this movie. But I was surprised that I liked this a lot more than I thought it was going to be. The main, huge thing about it that I didn't like was the cgi. There was just no need for it. The original movie was just as effective, and in parts, far more effective...but with no cgi. The acting was pretty good, but I wouldn't have cast people as recognisable as Eric Christian Olsen and Mary Winstead. The entire time, I kept getting memory flashes of other movies those two had been in; Dumb And Dumberer, Sky High, etc. That's one of the things that were so great about the original movie. They had tons of recognisable actors in it, but they were so into their parts that you forgot you were looking at Kurt Russel or Wilfred Brimley. THe best parts of the movie were the great nods to the original movie; the ax in the door, the guy with the slit throat, the ice block, the double-headed Thing, and the very end scenes during the credits. I would have loved the movie a lot more if they hadn't used cgi. I've seen worse cgi, but every time in this movie, you were aware it was cgi.<br /><br />All that said, this was a decent movie and, as I said, a lot better then you may have heard. It could have been a lot better, though it WAS limited in what could happen, as we saw a lot of what happened in the first movie. They did pretty well with what they had. I really don't think I'll be watching this movie too often, perhaps just at Halloween. If you like the first Thing movie, you should at least rent this one to check it out.
B000WD66BM|5.0|\\"Oceanborn\\" is the second release from symphonic power metal band Nightwish.  This was one of the 3 albums released before Marco began sharing the vocal work.  Soprano female vocalists Tarja handles most of the vocal work on this album.  IN all honesty, I prefer Tarja's vocals compared to the newer Nightwish vocalist Anette.  Tarja was one of the first female singers to combine classical style vocals with heavy metal.  The keyboard style on this album is also very classical in style while the guitar, bass, and drums are more along the lines of power metal.  There are some deep male vocals on this album, particularly on the songs \\"Devil and the Deep Dark Ocean\\" and \\"The Pharaoh Sails To Orion.\\"  One of the best remakes ever is on this album titled \\"Walking in the Air\\" which was originally done as the theme song for \\"The Snowman.'  \\"Swanheart\\" is a great ballad with strong emotions.  Two other highlights on this album are \\"The Passion and the Opera\\" and \\"The Riddler\\" which are more upbeat in nature.  Some people may compare Nightwish to Evanescence but I think they are quite different.  Old Nightwish such as this album is more classical but heavier than Evanescence.  Although, many people who enjoy bands like Evanescence and Within Temptation will also enjoy Nightwish such as myself.  [...]
B004HO6I4W|5.0|This movie had quite a few LOL moments.  Kids enjoyed it, we enjoyed it, worth the price of admission paid.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I loved all three of Gillian's books. Each one gave me lots to think about. Days and weeks after finishing this book, I kept coming back to what made Camille so self destructive and when I found out, I wept. All of Miss Flynn's books are written to surprise the reader and this one did not disappoint. Read it. You will not be sorry!
B005RUV0NY|5.0|Stupid DVR cut off the last episode of season 2 so we were forced to watch it elsewhere, went here, enjoyed the episode and here we are.  Not much more to say.
B007L7JY3Y|5.0|I would recommend Kindle Fire HD users to buy this app. It now works great!<br />I had reviewed this item earlier and gave it a bad review. In fact, I encouraged Kindle Fire HD users not to buy this product.<br />Today, 8/15/2013, I updated my copy and noticed that they have fixed the compatibility problems the app had with the Kindle Fire HD.<br />I have used the product on my iPhone for some time and it works great. Now I can use it with my Kindle Fire HD as well.
B004LWZW8S|5.0|I enjoyed this movie, but you probably will not...........  I've watched it 3 times since purchasing it and I have Henry Cavill's god-like face & body memorized.  The other eye candy in this movie are also highly enjoyable.  The movie was reminiscent of 300, but without all the heart pounding scenes making everyone wish they could be a spartan.  It's hard to explain - the movie had action, it had drama, but something about it just didn't work.  It definitely wasn't Henry Cavill or ex sex-god Mickey Rourke (I just conjure up images of Wild Orchid when I watch him).  For me, it may have been the lack of dialogue on Henry Cavill's part.  It's like they just wanted him to strut his delicious body and not be heard.  Don't they understand his voice is just as delicious???  Catch this one on TV for free and make your own assessment.  Purchase it to see Henry Cavill half naked at a moments notice on your massive flat screen TV instead of your tiny computer monitor on some grainy non-HD youtube video.
B001K3KK0Q|5.0|I'm grateful that I didn't grow up in the super-uncomfortable '30s where it seems like it hurt just to be in the company of other human beings. And the language of the day was almost as awful as 21st Century hip hop, where it appears alien to my ears, or as harsh as nails on a chalk board.<br /><br />But the movie is interesting. Robert Redford is one of America's greats on film and overall it's an oddly appealing movie so...
B0085Z3B2Q|3.0|Not sure what this was missing or if I'm just jaded because the 70's Lorax cartoon is one of my utmost favorites.  It had some catchy songs, but songs do not make a movie.  Kids sat through it and asked to watch it a couple more times, but it has already been forgotten.  They also weren't interested in the 70's version - so their opinion has been officially negated in my household.
B00A31UXLW|4.0|After a fairly slow build up, this resumed investigation into the murder of a foreign journalist reaches a dramatic climax. Det Harry Bosch now appears ageless and is being recycled after returning from retirement to solve &#34;cold cases&#34;. Typically, Bosch disdains authority and prefers to play his own game which invariably creates conflict with his bosses. There were a couple of aspects of the plot that seemed unbelievable eg being shadowed by a female investigator from LAPD Internal Affairs who eventually comes to Bosch's rescue when he is pursuing this case &#34;off the reservation&#34;. Nevertheless, this is another enthralling novel from a master crime fiction writer.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|In so many ways that I cannot even begin to explain.  The book was fantastic, and the movie delivered on my expectations.
030759565X|5.0|I've made five recipes so far & they were all fantastic!  This would make a great gift for someone, too.
B008J34466|5.0|what an awesome cd this is! I bought it for two songs on it and love the whole cd! pink is amazing!
B007THA4FI|2.0|i couldn't even finish it. it was boring and seemed to drag on. I was hoping it would be as interesting as harry potter, but i was wrong.
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|My granddaughter introduced me to this delightful movie and I enjoyed it so much that I purchased it for myself. Again it is just a delightful, fun movie to watch.
B007HACDLK|5.0|A true page turner with the reader not wanting the book to end.<br />Can't wait to get the next book.
B009E3EWPI|5.0|Love Led Zepplin and they can still do it at their ages. This is a present for my husband and he loves Led Zepplin
B000W1V5OC|5.0|This concert marks the end of the Tarja era of Nightwish as she was fired from the band that night, as soon as the concert ended.  It is easy to see how Nightwish became so incredibly popular, through the skill of each member of the band.  11,000 Finnish fans filled Hartwell Arena in Helsinki on October 21, 2005.  To think that the tickets sold out in just 65 minutes of being put on sale, and that this was the last concert ever with Tarja as the lead singer!  This concert is part of Nightwish history, and the excitement is felt even through watching the DVD in 2012.  A must-buy for any Nightwish fan!
B000YHG72E|4.0|This movie is funny in a silly way. Typical Will Ferrel...only family style so san the bad language. Very enjoyable and gets funnier each time I watch it.
B005MMYPIE|5.0|Great debut cd from the new power metal band originating from Sweden and Denmark.  The unique sound of the band is heard through the unusual use of three singers, and every song is catchy and full of passion.  The band sounds incredibly mature and polished even in their first cd.  I instantly liked this band when I first heard the song Hunger and am eagerly anticipating the release of their sophomore album!
0920236162|5.0|Great book, love robert munsch. Great ending. My daughter loves this book and so do I. Not your typical fairytale ending but VERY entertaining book.
B004GYY714|5.0|Plays great (depending on your connection) with a wide list of channels. I listen to coast to coast frequently on it.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Caught a lot of things the 2nd and 3rd time I watched this that I missed the first. The characters interact well and it's action packed but also humerous. I let my 5 & 6 yr old watch it (though skipped over a scene with an eyeball extraction) and they liked it too.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Was playing today and had video ads popping up about once per minute. Normally, and in angry birds, the ads pop up when you restart a level or between menus. These videos (for some pointless massaging pillow, which actually looks fantastic) would pop up in the middle of playing the video, requiring you to watch for at least 15 seconds, disrupting the flow of play. Easy fix though, just play offline.
B009GED3HS|5.0|I never tire of this great show. It just gets better and better. More please! Super funny and super clever.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|I was drawn into this well-written narrative, without a doubt.  But I expected an epiphany at some point, and instead what I got was unoriginal philosophizing - I was disappointed because the book neither added to or in any way altered my existing philosophy, so I can't say it was worth the effort.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|This story is unbelieveable, I could not get over the fact that this man was born in captivity and had no idea what the rest of the world was like. The North Koreans have created these prisons that completely control the prisoners to a point they have nothing to compare their existance to.  His escape and life after being in prison for 23 years is amazing. In escaping he is very, very lucky. If he would have escaped at a different time he probably would have been caught and killed. The book is well worth reading
B009LRE040|5.0|This movie was epic, and had you on your seat the whole time. Although it does pale in comparison to the Dark Knight, it is still a very important movie in the Trilogy. I am very glad to have added it to my collection.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I've read a few books on this topic and really believed this would be impressive based on interviews I'd watched with the author and his level of education.  However, I came away feeling that his memories were clearly real, but not convinced that they were a journey to the beyond.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|this was my first romance type of book and I was hesitant but I loved it! loved it! loved it!
B004BJMEO6|5.0|Great movie....anyone who has watched any of the movies in this genre will know how bad they can be.  This isn't one of those.  Great characters, great acting... really enjoyed it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|loved itthis was my first romance type of book and I was hesitant but I loved it! loved it! loved it!
B00571F26Y|5.0|I had realized through trial and error how bad certain foods effected me.  It was absolutely fantastic to have it backed up by an obviously educated and caring MD.  It has led me to even further research in my journey.  This is not just a book for people who want to lose weight...I really believe that every person who cares about their health should consider this book.  I've read many  books on this topic...this is the best one, particularly if this is a new concept for you.
0525952926|5.0|I liked this book so much that after I downloaded it on my Kindle I bought a hard copy for my library.  This is the makings of a classic series.  Hope I'm still around for book three.
B000005B0U|5.0|The music was as I expected.  I would recommend this CD for anyone who likes this type music.  Hope you enjoy!
B005LAII1C|1.0|Cheap jokes and very boring for me. I guess you have to be a fan of Family Guy to enjoy this movie.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This is the first app I downloaded for my new Kindle Fire. Very easy to use, works as a night-light if you have your Kindle plugged in throughout the night. I adore simple apps and this is exactly as advertized! And I like the weather feature, too, which my alarm app on my Samsung tablet does not have.
B007MAETA8|5.0|I have listened to this cd everyday since I purchased it from the Gold Box deal of the day. Great CD good to know John hasnt lost his amazing songwriting abilities. A true artist
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Play it every day. Just fun and addictive! Play the tournament mostly, it's free and you collect keys and coins.
B007MDB548|5.0|a really cute movie shipped quickly and has been watched a few times already, def a worth it movie for anyone with little girls in their family.
034580404X|5.0|My friends and I have read and reread this series and love the characters more and more.  I just think it's the hottest and most intriguing book series out there.  I haven't spoken to anyone who didn't fall in love with Christian and long to be more creative in the bedroom!!!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|THE MARK of ATHENA was a great book. I would definitely recommend this book. If you like action in a fake Greek sort of way then this is the book for you.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|Story was okay and a good job making unbelievable characters meld.  However, they were too opposing in actions and personality to be so drawn to each other.
1557048630|5.0|I'm a big fan of the movie How to train your dragon, and then I found this book I could just not resist buying it.<br />The book is richly illustrated with lots of beautiful backgrounds, drawings and sketches of both dragons and the figures / characters who appear in the film. It's fun to see how the characters have changed throughout the process, and the result is as always been really good.<br />There are so many funny and beautiful drawings in this book. You see the process from sketch to fully animated.<br />So if you are a big fan of the movie, then this is a book you just have to own.
B0074V3712|5.0|As a prolific reader of science books for those without a PHD, I didn't find much in this book that was new.  What I did find was a very readable weaving together of new theories over the past 20 years in biology, brain studies, genetics, archeology, evolutionary psychology and anthropology. Social insects, Wilson's specialty, dominate the insect world. Homo sapiens have conquered everything else because we have evolved to function as groups, not individuals.  Wilson teases out the many implications of group living. It is a marvelous and informative read.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Have really enjoyed playing this game! And, so has my 6yr old daughter! I would say, it's great for puzzle lovers of all ages
B00632HWOG|2.0|Yahoo! Mail has worked great for me for years. I just did the update on my Kindle Fire a few days ago, and now it force closes EVERY time I open it and try to perform any sort of action. Absolutely ridiculous.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|LOVED this series. never thought a biker gang would steal my heart. BUT IT DID. there is rough language and violence and yes sexual scenes, but it is for adults. NOT CHILDREN.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|Bought for my mom.  She seems to like it.  Here are the rest of my 11 required words right here.
B005PK4ZHY|5.0|the story about these friends shows why you need to keep your friends close and your enemies closer. wish show was still active.
B008VVT51U|5.0|This movie made me  want to pack my bags and move to India.  I know better because there is just a whole lot of things I would not like in India.  The heat and crowds and crowds of people would be upper most .  Any way this movie is just plain good old fashioned entertainment.  I watch movies to be entertained.  I don't have to believe everything I see, I just need to feel it at the moment.  I like movies that actually tell a story rather than fill the screen with sex or violence in place of a good solid story.  Well there is no sex or violence in this movie.  There is a very nice story and very human people some we like immediately some have to grow a little.  But overall likeable characters done by fine actors.  I watch this movie quite frequently.  It doesn't grow old0
B009K0P10K|4.0|REVENGE,  this show keeps you guessing. never a dull moment.  revenge is definately the perfect name for this show. but still she is never able to be happy??
1416955070|5.0|City of Bones is the first of the Mortal Instruments trilogy and I LOVED IT. If you prefer your vamps a little less shiny, your warlocks to be more than childern... you will love this book as well.
0679809015|4.0|I was pretty mad when I got the book. It's so itty bitty. I assumed it was going to be a Normal size book, not a miniature. Should've read the reviews lol. Still a good book though.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|Homeland's first season won Emmy's for best drama, and best actress and actor, Claire Danes and Damian Lewis.  With the completion of season 2 last week, it's hard to see how the show won't pick up a slew of Emmy's next year.<br /><br />Homeland can be compared to 24, another show I loved, but I believe Homeland surpasses 24, especially in the quality of its actors.  Claire Danes plays a mentally unstable CIA agent, Carrie Matheson, and Damian Lewis as Nicholas Brody is a newly rescued POW who may or may not have been turned by his Muslim captors during his years in captivity.  The cat and mouse game played by Carrie and Brody is tense and exciting, as we never know who holds the upper hand.  The episodes build to an incredible finale that had my hear pounding.<br /><br />The blu-ray looks great, but the special features are not exactly special.  However, at $20, this is a steal.  I picked up a copy for myself, as well as three more for Christmas gifts family members who have so far resisted my pleas to watch the show.  I know they won't be disappointed.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|First it started on the paid edition, now its doing it on the free edition. Keeps force closing on Kindle Fire, very frustrating because it's one of my favorite games.
B000NY12LO|5.0|This book was an outstanding book and every teacher should read it.  Unfortunately, in light of the recent school shooting it breaks my heart that so much of this book could be true.
B008KMHFJY|5.0|For YA, this was such a good read, it is on a to read after Fifty shades list and Imust say i loved it. The characters were well developed, she is strong willed and strong minded, as is he. It truly is a Beautiful Disaster. I hope his story is just as good when it is released soon.
B00288KNJU|5.0|Our family loves this movie. Great quality and it's a must watch for every child. Good story line, I just wish they made toys for this movie.
B0096BIENY|5.0|this is the most excited product that i've ever had. i love them, in this album, it collected all the best selling songs!
B005UA0FLE|5.0|This album has a traditional feel with a new twist that makes it sound familiar, but not re-hashed. I will listen to this for years to come!<br />P.S. Happy Birthday Jesus!
0307951529|5.0|I'm about 120 pages in and I already feel that its worth the money. What I get from this book it that it motivates me to take action. Not to just plan and plan. Now if your'e disappointed by this book you should have read reviews and an article about it. The next book Mr. Chris writes will have my story in it and this review, so in your face if you don't buy this book !
B009FZHYKU|5.0|All I can say is that, this is one of the best drama series in the history of TV! The others are of course BREAKING BAD, THE SHIELD AND THE WIRE!
1419705849|5.0|My son received this book for his birthday. It arrived in perfect condition, and he had it read within two days! He really loves this series, and this book did not disappoint him.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is one of my favorite books of all time! I did not get a change to see the movie and hope it does justice to the book.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I don't usually write product reviews, but I really feel the need to do this, since the existing reviews are conflicting:<br /><br />I tip-toed around buying the 8-film Harry Potter Collection for a while.  A bunch of the reviews mentioned things like sub-par discs, discs with the wrong cover art (or no cover art), etc.  I finally decided to go for it; I could always return it if it wasn't up to my standards.<br /><br />The set arrived and it's exactly what I was hoping for.  It has all eight movies, with all the correct art and the expected, single-case packaging.  In response to the images included at the top of the page from the customer who had the black disc for the 7th movie, etc - all I can assume is that there was an incorrect batch out there somewhere, and this has since been corrected.<br /><br />If you're looking for tons of extras and super-fan material, then perhaps this isn't the set for you (although it seems the only other alternative is ridiculously expensive).  However, all I wanted was a set of all eight movies for a reasonable price, and this did that for me.  I highly recommend.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I have had a hard time getting through this book which surprised me so much seeing as I loved her writing style in Harry Potter.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the large choice of versions!  And the ease of navigating from book to book, passaga to passage.  Lots more to discover on it & in it!
B005IQZB14|5.0|I usually don't read too many memoirs or biographies, but I truly enjoyed her honesty and excellent attention to details found in this book.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Did not really go for the gone parts, but the back and forth writing was interesting.It was a read I would have preferred not to go to.
B005G5PPGS|5.0|This was a great read especially for a lifelong baseball fan. I have always been obsessed by statistics and I am not alone. I would recommend this to anyone professional as there are lessons here for everyone.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Very funny movie, well acted by fabulous actors, good theme.  What else could you possibly want?  I rented it first to check it out before buying.  I'm definitely buying.
B0084U0IEG|2.0|The book was very slow. Too much discussioon of authors. It clearlly was not a page turner. His other books are better.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|I did love this movie but it was too short.  Not enough on the individual characters.  Plus they killed off one of the good guys I really liked and in my book that doesn't go over good.  So they lose a star for that.
B004RLPTT0|5.0|excellent album with some great cover tunes, I really, really, really liked it a lot and I recomend it highly
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|if you're a fan of &#34;these kinds of movies&#34; (we are) you'll like Ted, but it wasn't uproariously funny. we knew going in it would be a bit crude, and it was. all in all, we liked it but probably wouldn't recommend it to friends.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|it was very good. knowing about the show help me further my enjoy with the show castle. the book expands your enjoyment with the crew of the 12th
B0089XH38M|5.0|Best I've found and easy to set up and maintain,works great, and does the job without taking up memory, so I recommended
B00A0SLTCU|4.0|The first Total Recall was and still is a cool movie.  If you are going to remake a movie that isn't terribly old.  Then it should be reasonable to expect that you are going to make it better.  This movie isn't better than the original
B00A77II0U|5.0|The rest of the game developers could learn something from Alawar. This was a fun, challenging game with a great story line. The graphics are outstanding and the price is reasonable. I will definitely be looking for and buying more games from this company.
B007N9FKCY|3.0|This might be a fun product but it is a little hard to control the bean and in which direction it goes.  It gets very frustrating when it hops all over the place.  But I plan to keep it.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|The very first time I saw this movie I was in the movie theater with my brother. We were in love with the movie and thought everything about it was hilarious. Later when I rented this movie to watch it again, alone, I realized just how stupid and plot-less this movie was. There were still some parts that gave a chuckle but I found myself getting up multiple times to do other things and not really paying attention to the movie. If you are a guy who likes to smoke pot and live your personal fantasies then this movie will be your favorite. But if you are someone who likes more realistic humor then this movie will be a vast disappointment. I believe this movie is only good the first time around ( I wouldn't recommend buying it) or it could have just been funny because of the company I was with.
B0041D843M|4.0|I would have liked it better if he would have given a diet to follow and listed specific foods when talking about the different diseases that protein causes.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|Hard enough to challenge you unlike some others.  I've enjoyed it!  I recommend it to anyone that likes search games
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Vintage John Corey, except the wisecracks were excessive and detracted at time from the story.  That having been said, DeMille still can write a book that keeps you turning the pages.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|This story is not anything new. The characters are not that well developed and honestly I did not finish reading it.  I just came to the point where I said, &#34;Do I really care how this book ends?&#34;  The answer was, &#34;No.&#34;  So, I moved on.  My time is precious and when I sit down to read a book I want to be entertained.  I want to care about these characters.  It just didn't happen for me.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love it. best alarm ive had. doesn't scare me to death when I wake up from its low to high volume transitioning. :)
B008JGSM6G|4.0|flow free is fun and makes you plan ahead and can go back and redo to go to the next level
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|This is a very funny movie and it was made in mass and in boston which is with in secs. of where i live :)
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|In 1951, my parents bought our first TV set. A couple of years later, one of the first local TV shows for kids was called \\"Mr. Pix,\\" where a host drew cartoon characters who were always getting into trouble. It was great interactive fun for kids, who put a transparent overlay over the TV screen and used a grease pencil to get the character out of trouble, like drawing a bridge across a chasm (you got the overlay and pencil by mailing a dollar to the TV station).<br /><br />Stickman reminds me a bit of that old TV show. My own personalized Stickman quest is \\"The Search for Debbie.\\" It was a cute way of working my wife into the story, but kids could use a friend or sibling's name. I honestly wasn't expecting the app to be so much fun, but moving through the first level and learning how the game works was a real hoot, especially learning how to use the drawing tools like the Fire pencil (burn things down) and Snow pencil (freeze other characters to immobilize them). One hint: don't burn things down or light a stick of dynamite when you're standing next to them!<br /><br />Now I'm having a great time exploring the world of Stickman and looking forward to going through the levels and completing challenges and finding all the puzzle pieces that will help me rescue Debbie. One helpful feature that I'm sure I'll take advantage of is to ask questions and get hints from the game developer on their Facebook and Twitter pages.<br /><br />Stickman should have a huge appeal to kids, and even to grown-ups who need a bit of relaxing fun.<br /><br />Note: I'm playing Stickman on my Kindle Fire HD 7\\" with no problems.
B008M721MS|5.0|it' s really great.<br />I never had any problem with this app, I recommend for you guys!<br />get the app and rate it, I hope that you like.
B009X00E18|3.0|I really like how lightweight these cases are, they add almost no thickness to the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and minimal weight. The texture of the screen cover is a nice rubberized material that is better than the fake leather that's on a similar case I have for the first generation Kindle Fire. My two main complaints are 1they didn't include the small magnet that allows the Fire to sleep/resume automatically when you open and close the case. I have another case that does, and I really miss this nice feature...especially since the on/off button on the Fire is small and a bit hard to find on the side. 2)The cover folds over into a triangle to form a stand like on so many cases, but it doesn't really work except on a very flat and stable surface...any shaking or softness, like a table-cloth, and it will fall over. Finally, seems a bit expensive given the materials and simplicity of design.
B00992CF6W|5.0|amazing game. mindcraft. totally worth the money. oh and do you like peanuts?! but The game is really fun qqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq 2wwwwwwwwwswe eeeeeeeeeess
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|We enjoyed this movie, it's very silly but funny too.  Not for kids unless you don't mind a lot of F-bombs.
B0076DELIG|5.0|What a interesting character is Harry.  A great plot full of complications.  Michael Connelly never disappoints.  I hope this series never ends.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|There is so much intrigue going on here. It will make your head spin. And let me tell you about the sex, phew. Makes me tired just thinking about how much sex ole' King Henry has. If he had this much sex makes me wonder how he ran the country. Hmmmmm.....no wonder things seem to be running a little more smoothly with women sitting on the throne!!!
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Very scary scenario about computer hacking from China and what could really happen in the near future.  Loved seeing some of the old Tom Clancy characters like Ding Chavez and John Clark.  I recommend this book to any Tom Clancy, Dale Brown, Vince Flynn or David Baldacci fans.
030759565X|5.0|I was looking for an attractive cook book with a wide variety of recipes that included nice photos and this cook book has it all.  You won't be disappointed!
B009AZZEU2|5.0|Soundgarden makes a super effort with this CD, so glad they decided to get back to rocking as only Soundgarden can.
0061900656|5.0|I've gotten Joanna Cole's \\"I'm a Big Brother\\" and \\"I'm a Big Sister\\" books for many a new big brother and big sister. They have always been really appreciated and parents have raved about the older siblings loving the books.
B009E3EY38|5.0|You can almost feel their nervousness in the opener, &#34;good times, bad times&#34;.  By the time they get to &#34;in my time of dying&#34; they are in their groove, a few songs later, &#34;nobody's fault&#34; they are on fire and they spend the rest of the show just pounding you with hit after hit after hit.  An unbelievable performance, an awesome DVD, a must for any fan of the mighty Led Zeppelin.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|The move was overly long and kind of dull, with too much mystic crap thrown in, though I preferred it to the Tim Burton/Joel Schumacher directed movies, which were just weird for the sake of being weird.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|A wonderfully sweet movie about pensioners who pull up roots and move, not only to new homes but those new homes are in India! It is definitely for a &#34;mature&#34; audience; it has dialog, plot, and the closest thing to a chase scene is a speeding scooter!  We thoroughly enjoyed it and would watch it again.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|When I found out about this mouse I was immediately blown away by the technical specs that it was touting. This mouse has 9 programmable keys , an illuminating logo that can have its colors customized , weights to change the weight of the mouse , and many more features you would only find in 60$+ mice. The mouse fits comfortably in my Large hands and feels like it was made with high quality materials. It is an 8000 DPI mouse , which means that it is very sensitive and responsive. you can adjust these settings at will , using the Windows only Driver . The application takes seconds to download and is a dream to use. I highly recommend this mouse , and Anker is a brand that I will be looking out for in the future.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I loved this game! I couldn't put it down and loved the challenge. I also liked the hint pages in case you get stuck. I can't wait for more from this developer
1781163243|5.0|If you are like me and you are studying to become an animator or concept artist then this book is a wonderful addition to any Library , the price is right and the content is heavy. It is about 200 pages long and is filled to the brim with amazing art work by professionals who worked on Halo 4.
B009IF82SK|5.0|This show is hilarious.  If you are a &#34;geek&#34; or know a geek it's even better.  Every week This show makes me laugh
B0076DELIG|2.0|Bosch has lost his luster. The character is no longer interesting, the plot was predictable. I have loved him through the years but I think it might be time to bury Harry.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Extremely easy to use-really cool how you simply swipe the memory keys aside to reveal additional function keys. Quite simple to use-does what I need to most often!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I love all the start wars sound effects, and the characters are so cute. It's fun to see which character does what. Love the light saber.
B000B5XOY8|5.0|Batman (1989) is a visually overwhelming gigantic block buster of a film that combines slam bang action with psychological complexity. If it is not a work of genius it is a work of brilliance. Batman has to save Gotham City from criminals and evil villains and save beautiful Vicki vale from the evil joker. The Joker is the ultimate evil batman villain and a psychotic mad man. The scene where Bruce Wayne puts the flowers on the ground where his parents were murdered was a very touching and sad scene. Batman rescuing Vicki Vale from the evil joker in the Gotham City art museum by crashing through a ceiling glass and using a cable gun to escape from the joker and his evil henchmen is spectacular and wonderful. Batman flying his electronic jet into Gotham City to stop the joker from killing every body with the poison gas balloons at Gotham city`s 200th anniversary celebration and pulling those balloons into the sky and letting them go is pretty impressive. The scene where batman and Vicki vale are dangling in the air from a very high building and Batman uses his cable gun to shoot a cable that attaches to a gargoyle statue and the jokers leg and the joker falls to his horrific death and then batman and Vicki start falling and batman uses his cable gun to shoot a cable that attaches itself to the top of the building and stops them from falling and they are swinging back and forth while the police lights are on them is an exciting,awesome and emotional scene. Then the end of the movie where Billie d. Williams say we received a letter from batman saying, &quot;Gotham City has earned a rest from crime, but if the forces of evil rise again to cast a shadow on the heart of the city call me.&quot;
B006XF5BTG|5.0|The book is well divided into small chunks of learning how to develop a great physique. The years of Michael experience in trail and error have also contributed to the of this book. Save your money from all the hype of magazines and read this book first before you venture into the lifestyle of professionals in magazines. This book will not only open your eyes but will give you the right mental tools to developing a successful body.
B0063GORYU|4.0|this is an an excellent app, especially for free! I haven't had any issues or problems since I installed it. its an excellent way to kill some time if you find yourself needing to do just that :)
B00007KWHG|5.0|Who doesn,t love the Four Seasons! Brings back great memories! I know all the words by heart. Highly recommend this.
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|Every person who works with, parents, mentors, or supports children should read this! Amazing piece on what really matters in helping our children succeed!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Best book of the three. I just wish there was a forth.Hated to put any of the books down knowing eventually I would be finished with the trilogy,
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a great app ...weather reports that  are up to the minute and on the money for the locations entered
B00A31UXLW|4.0|All Michael  Connolly books are excellent especially The Black Box and I  hope Harry Bosch has many more adventures to come.
034580404X|5.0|these books are very good and the story line is great.  i recommend these to anyone who likes excitement and fun.
B005LAII1C|5.0|WORTH THE WAIT CANT WAIT TILL TED 2 COMES OUT.....HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO ALL THAT HAVE A SENESE OF HUMOR
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is so fun but so addicting it getsme into trouble cause I don't get done what I need to cause I cant putthis game down.
B007V4530A|5.0|As a corporate executive, presentation coach, TEDx curator and a student of the craft of presenting, Jeremey Donovan has seen a lot of presentations. Some great. Most...not so great.<br /><br />Using successful TED talks as a frame, Jeremey lays out a simple and straightforward plan to prepare a truly great presentation, even if you're not at TED.  He also spills some important insider tricks if speaking at TED or TEDx is your goal.<br /><br />He covers some new ground that a lot of presentation books have missed, such as Chapter 4, \\"How To Be Introduced\\". It's a very important topic that I haven't seen covered anywhere but this book.<br /><br />If you like Chapter 8, How to Tell Stories, I highly suggest checking out \\"Resonate\\" by Nancy Duarte. This book is a great start but Resonate goes into even more detail on the audience's emotional journey.<br /><br />This quick read (113 pages) is a deal at $9.99 in paperback, a steal at $2.99 for the Kindle version and if you have an actual Kindle and Amazon Prime, you can borrow it for free.<br /><br />Pick it up. You won't be sorry.
B0098466CK|5.0|Only found out about the Sword a few years ago, and what a find! These guys are like Sabbath re-incarnated into a faster and heavier version. Some fans prefer the raw power of the first 2 albums, but I really like what they are doing lately, and this album picks up right where Warp Riders left off. I finally got to see them last month in NYC, and they were so tight, it was worth the long wait. So glad that these guys from Texas are putting out really good albums in this age of Bieber and Gaga crap.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Waking up Married was funny and lighthearted. The characters were realistic, fun and flirty. Great book for a lazy afternoon.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Loved, loved, loved this book. It was a great romance along with cute humor. I love reading books like this!!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This version by MobilityWare is simple and fun to use. It works well on my Samsung Galaxy SII 4G and I have not had any playability issues.
B009LRE040|2.0|The DVD stopped in the middle 4 times. It was a new one. The  movie itself was not as good as other Batman movies.
B000I9WVY6|4.0|good movie, based on true \\ story. i recommend to watch it. not a war  movie just about experiences of one man
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I thought the author had a great imagination. I enjoyed seeing  where the story would take me and what would happen next.  The description of the circus was rich with sensory experiences.  It was a bit long but still a good read.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|` title is the same as original but it does have differences, enjoyed the CGI. i recommend it as an action flick
B0098VXBIA|5.0|I love this movie! I promise u will die laughing if u watch this movie! Never in my life have I ever seen a more funnier movie! Explains a lot for women who have had children and explains dos and don'ts for coming mothers!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Star Wars in blu-ray! yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! But I do have to agree with many here. I do not like the extra added goofy parts. They REALLY stick out to me and are extremely annoying! Star Wars is my favorite movie of all time.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|Another great CD from Michael Jackson!!<br /><br />All the classic and more! I did not realize it was a double cd which made buying it even better!!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Prior experience with app on my Droid phone.  Kindle app provides same quality and options.  Can't beat it for the price (free).
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|as with all of the G5 apps I have gotten this one has a great story line and great graphics.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I'm addicted.  It's not flashy but perfect for someone like me.  I wouldn't know what to do with too many options anyway.  The ads included with this &#34;free&#34; version aren't that big a deal and can be exited out of easily.
B005UBNL0A|5.0|I recently built my first gaming PC for under $600.  I wanted a decent computer on a budget, so I decided to go with AMD rather than Intel.  To be honest, I think I would have gone with AMD even if I had an unlimited budget.  I have, for the entirety of my sentience, despised brands that advertise &#34;higher quality&#34; despite similar specs at exorbitantly higher prices (ehem, Apple).  Sure, Intel chips may be pretty, sparkly, etc, but AMD sells similarly spec'd chips at nearly half the cost, and offers great customer support.  I will, for as long as I and AMD exist, buy their chips for that reason.  This CPU specifically has caused me no troubles and when I build another computer, AMD will be in it.  This, or the FX 6xxx series, are your best bet for a gaming PC on a budget.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I love music, especially with a classical edge. This band does amazing things with music. They even have a Star Wars tribute! I love this CD!
B0099G3I96|2.0|It's probably not fair to compare an artist's recent output with previous works..but nevertheless, I can't escape my disappointment with No Doubt here. My favorite album of their's is Return of Saturn, which I feel still represents their high water mark artistically. In fact, Return of Saturn is one of my favorite albums of all time. I've given Push and Shove about 7-8 go rounds, and keep coming back to the same conclusion. The songs are bland and the band seems nonexistent. Where are the guitars? Where are the cool riffs, rhthyms, etc? Where are the hooks in choruses? Where's the overall fun?<br /><br />There are a few good tracks here, \\"Looking Hot\\", \\"Push and Shove\\". But it's not worth owning as a complete album.
6305212112|5.0|What can I say,An all time favorite,can't say enough good things about this movie,again had it in video but wanted it in DVD.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|my kids started playing this first but now I love it too; it helps to pass the time and relax after a hectic day
B0076DELIG|5.0|The Black Box was fantastic, I love Harry Bosch. I travel a lot and Mr. Connelly makes my flights less painful.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I thought all three books were a good read.  It had a plot...It flowed well..didn't want to put the book down.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Her books are entertaining and great to distract you from a tough day.  Certainly it was worth it.  I still go, in this genre, with Gray's trilogy, but Day's books are by no means, inferior.  Just a matter of novelty, mainly that Gray's trilogy was the first.  Also, and not less important, my wife LOVED IT - therefore, everybody is happy... :-)
B008QE9XD2|3.0|It is something that I did not care for (should have realized being a Burton movie it would be out in left field)  Grew up watching the Dark Shadows on TV and I thought it would be more like the series.
B0098WWEH8|5.0|I listened to this album for the first time the day after I saw them in Nashville, so I had heard almost every song on the album by the time I spun the CD for the first time. But strangely, besides Sleeping Ute and Yet Again, which they released early for all the fans that needed a fix, on the first listen I didn't recognize any of the songs. Sure, I realized their beauty during the concert, but they lacked the immediateness of Knife, While You Wait For the Others, and of course Two Weeks, advertisers' favorite indie song of all time. Now I've never been a person who doesn't hear perfection the first time and gives up, and I've been a Grizzly Bear fan since 2008, when I first heard Knife, so I knew I wouldn't be disappointed after a few more runs. And like Van Morrison's Astral Weeks, Wilco's Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, and The Clash's London Calling (which took a good 3 years and the onset of puberty), I finally *felt* these songs. The keyboards in Gun Shy, so subtle, but so integral. The Hunt, just beautiful, showing a rough side of Ed Droste's voice he claims he was too insecure to let out before. Lyrics you actually have to listen for, like in Speak in Rounds: \\"Step down just once, learn how to be alone.\\" Something about that is so great, I just don't know what yet. This isn't an album to listen to doing laundry. These songs have to be listened to closely, or you're cheating yourself. Songs like Knife are catchy and wonderful, but I think Grizzly Bear has topped themselves with Shields, by creating lasting modern art that has to be savored, and that's such a precious thing in this day of disposable pop and R&B where the only sign of talent is sex appeal. Ed Droste and co. don't write songs for teenage girls (although I know a few cool teenage girls who like GB), they write music for people who like music. That's how you do it. It's exciting hearing a band at their third album as a quartet, building and maturing like Grizzly Bear is. I can only imagine what it was likeexperiencing the Beatles like this, album by album. And to think, Revolver was the Beatles' seventh album. Grizzly Bear can only go up from here.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I bought this bag after several days of researching this as well as others. It is the exact same bag that canon has labeled for a similar price, and I was more attractedto the all black look. I've had it for over a year and have never had any problems whatsoever out of it. I would rate it 5 stars but the padding around the perimeter and back seems a little too thin, but like I said it has performed great. I do photography as a side business to supplement my income, and while it doesn't get tossed around and abused like it would if I were fulltime, it has held up great. I would definitely reccomend this bag over many of the other overpriced \\"professional \\" bags. I can fit 2 dslr bodies, and up to 6 lenses depending on size. Mine currently holds 2 camera bodies, a 70-300, 28-90, 18-55, and 50mm prime and a 430exii speed light flash, along with extra batteries and small equipment. The two zippered pockets inside are great and there is lots of storage for small items in the two outer pockets. The bungee on the outside is more decorative than useful but who cares. At this price you can't go wrong with this bag. I also like the two side pockets.<br /><br />Great bag, great price, decent durability.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is amazing fun and challenging it is apropreate and good for kids there are all different types of games some are fun and some can be a little boaring
B009O2XY12|5.0|Easy to playing. Nice and cool color. Good handling, fast and easy to go back and vorward. a e b
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Good flic.  Maybe not quite up to #2 (with the Joker, what could be?), but an excellent movie nontheless.  Enough said.
B00AHSMDQY|1.0|I give this one star in comparison to the other 2 Batman Movies. The plot was dull, and there were not enough action scenes. Bane is more annoying than evil.
B00AHXDECG|4.0|I had been waiting for this album release since hearing Locked Out of Heaven. Needless to say, I was no disappointed with the purchase. Bruno Mars has such a great voice and his songs are catchy but catchy in a good way. Some of my favorites are &#34;Locked Out of Heaven&#34;, &#34;Treasure&#34;, &#34;Gorilla&#34; (guilty pleasure), &#34;Natalie&#34; and &#34;If I Knew&#34;.
B005IEGUDY|3.0|The author is marketed as the next James Michener, so I was expecting something of comparable quality, which this is not.  The quality of the writing is a step down, being wordy, overusing passive verbs, and never really bringing the history to life.  The author also did not research his subject to the extent of Michener.  He has corn as being one of the first crops farmed in England.  There later became corn festivals with corn princesses, and later still they worshiped a corn maiden.  When Rome came to conquer the island, they saw fields of corn.  And it all sounds good and well, but corn is indigenous to the Americas, it didn't make its way to Europe until after Columbus.  Michener never would have made such a mistake.  Let Rutherfurd be Rutherfurd, and that's fine, he's okay, but to say he is another Michener is demeaning to Michener.
B0030A0ZD4|5.0|This is a &#34;must-have&#34; item if you are truly an MJ fan. Many people do not even know of it's existence & how awesome it is! Just as Thriller was an instant hit & ahead of it's time, so too you will find Moonwalker! Buy it NOW!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Being a retired Homicide detective I can totally relate to Harry Bosch.  Connelly has written another great novel that tells another outstanding tale with LAPD and the morons in charge.  Connelly really connects with the readers and explains the frustration a hard working detective faces in solving cases.  His facts in explaining the story are very well researched which enabled him to present a past paced reading book.  Excellent story and this would make a great movie
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Our little French Bulldog sat through the whole movie transfixed and we were crying like babies. This is one of the most beautiful movies and a must for anyone that has ever had a pet they love and adore. Very emotional, excellent acting by Richard Gere (whom I do not feel gets the credit he deserves as an actor) and I am incredulous that this wonderful movie never made it to the \\"BIG\\" screen. A truly wonderful movie and Hollywood totally ignores it.  Must be because it was so wonderful...not the usual violent, sex filled garbage they produce!
B007U4DIM6|5.0|It was packaged well and arrived before the scheduled time.  It is a great gift for children who love dogs!
B002RKSCA6|1.0|I can't accurately rate this bc it would NOT open up on my kindle app.  So, sorry.  books usually open fine on it, so IDK.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|Great movie!  Entertainment in true Men in Black fashion. Im going to buy the movie and watch it over and over!

Hopeless.\\"<br /><br />Christmas came early this year...in the form of an early release from our very favorite Colleen Hoover with Hopeless. I'm not sure how I hit the book jackpot these past couple weeks, {I'm hoping it continues with a little Dirty Red in the next few days!} but I've had one amazing book after another. Some would say I'm getting soft, Abby and Rhiannon would tell you otherwise. I don't even finish anything below 3 stars anymore {Abby constantly yells at me!} :P<br /><br />Anyway...<br /><br />OK, I have two words for you. Dean. Holder.<br /><br />\\"Dean Holder? Messy brown hair? Smoldering blue eyes? A temper straight out of Fight Club?\\"<br /><br />In all honesty, I could probably just finish the review right there. Obviously I won't, because I haven't done nearly enough gushing about this fantastic read but seriously? Could you get any better than Holder?<br /><br />\\"Anything, I'll do anything you ask me to, so long as you're shirtless.\\" -Sky<br /><br />Pretty sure he had me from hello. I was honestly debating if I wanted to tell Abby and Rhiannon to read this book, so I could have Holder all to myself {selfish, I know!}. He's all the man every girl wants. A<br /><br />\\"You don't deserve words, Sky. You deserve actions.\\" -Holder<br /><br />I will say I feel slightly...salty that my first kiss didn't even come close, hell it was freakin' light years away from theirs. Talk about, Wow. I don't think I've still caught my breath from that scene!<br /><br />\\"It's Crap that you're letting one bad year determine your fate for the rest of your life.\\" -Sky<br /><br />Hoover, in her typical flawless writing ability creates a story that flows effortlessly from the page. The first half of the book had me smiling to my Kindle, and laughing constantly. All the characters have amazing personalities that actually add to the storyline. So many times supporting characters are one dimensional. Breckin and Six added so much humor to the first half of the book, I think I loved them even as much Sky and Holder and found myself laughing inappropriate texts, lunchroom conversations, the book wouldn't have been the same without them.<br /><br />\\"Does not-your boyfriend realize I'm Mormon?\\" Breckin<br /><br />The first half of the book definitely left me wondering how the last half of the book would pan out. I definitely started wonder if it could keep up it's momentum from the first half into the second. Even with some pretty intense content, it blew me away. I don't think I would change one single thing about this book. Everything, even the details I didn't think meant something, meant something, and that's why Hoover is the amazing author she is.<br /><br />It's real, Six. You can't get mad at a real ending. Some of them are ugly. It's the fake happily ever afters that should piss you off.\\"<br /><br />So forget about Christmas shopping {who needs to actually wrap the presents?} and start reading.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|Such an inspiring and amazing book. It was cool how things came together in the end. Very sweet story I will probably end up reading it again
B00005N9CV|5.0|Cd arrived on time and in good condition. I'm a Diana Krall fan and so this cd is just perfert for those quiet nights when you want to listen to good music!
B003UBTX72|3.0|I'm just reviewing this for my husband. He said it was just OK.<br />I could only select 3 stars but he would give it 3.5.  That's it.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|This free version, with illustrations from the original printed book (released on this day 169 years ago - 1843), is a well presented facsimile of the book and is a must-read for anyone familiar with this story only through the film versions.
B005D0RDKW|5.0|Things to consider:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B005D0RDKW Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland [Blu-ray]]]<br /><br />-Probably the best all-around set list to be put on a live video (subjectively)<br /><br />-The audio/video sync issues that you saw in R30 and Rush in Rio are no more!<br /><br />-The audio and video quality is much better than before. The audio mixing is much more oriented to a home theatre.<br /><br />-The camera angles and editing are a lot better than previous live video, with better movement and fewer static shots.<br /><br />-A lot of good crowd shots mixed in to really bring that energy for the viewer up<br /><br />-Includes all of the shorts prior to the songs which are a lot of fun.<br /><br />This is a great blu-ray. If you are a Rush fan or even just a music fan you will really enjoy showing off your system to others with this.<br /><br />-Cory
B004R13U6Y|3.0|This reader is awesome.  My only complaint is the read aloud feature doesn't follow the text during reflow.  I like to read withthe voice when possible but when the entire page is showing on my little screen it is difficult to read
B0085P2Z6E|3.0|Game was actually really good, but the story line was so long between game play, that I would actually get bored having to read it all instead of just skipping it.  shut down the game alot because of long story line.
1442337966|5.0|I've read the books, but listening to the audiobook was really an experience.  I left it in my car for a couple months and listened to it every day on the way to and from work.  It will turn you whole day around if you let it.
B006LEGPLC|5.0|I really enjoy the way Peter Green performs the old delta blues.  He keeps it simple and authenic.  Good Stuff
1439130833|5.0|Wonderful to give someone to put on their desk or keep for yourself.  I smile every time I read one of these daily teachings.  I even write notes on some of my favorite ones and give them to other people that I think might benefit from reading it. They really motivate you to do great things!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I chose 3 stars because I found myself struggling to get through this book at times. Maybe the story was just a little too farfetched for me. I really love most of his books.
1451673442|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing! I've read Rhonda Byrne's other books - The Secret and The Power so I had to see what this one was about.  Probably my favorite of all.  I have already seen amazing things happen in my life.  Thank you!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I could not fathom what she would write after the first two books but she definitly carried the theme straight through. Even left room for her imagination to give us more if she desired. Would like to see it in a movie.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is the best.  I canrt wait for new episodes.  I am engaged in the characters and the plot.  The zombies almost seem secondary...almost.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|Calendar works great, no problems with installation, easy to use, everything I needed for a Calendar appt., used on a COBY KRYOS MID7034-4,
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Again he remains up to date mirroring his fictional characters to current events and technology.  Makes the book easy to read and relate.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This is the best trilogy (aside from the Lord of the Rings, of course). And if you are purchasing it here, chances are you have already seen at least one of the movies. The blue ray has such a nice quality when compared to regular dvd. My set came in perfect condition, and shipped quickly and free through Amazon Prime. Beautiful boxed set, I am giving it as a gift and I am positive it will be well received. The cost on Amazon is better than I have found in several local stores as well. The cost for the set is only about $5 more than buying The Dark Knight Rises, alone.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Such a great story!<br />For the first time ever I cry reading the book.<br />Characters are great and even that they are only teens, it feels like they are grown ups.<br />Writing is just amazing!
B009GX7IRA|5.0|This has been my favorite show from the beginning.  I am not much of a tv viewer. So for a show to captivate me for 10 years says a lot. The last show to do that was M*A*S*H. The writing for NCIS is superb and has been out the gate.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I usually read all the book- top 20 that are on amazon and this was absolute garbage of a book.<br />Story is so boring and predictable and writing is so poor!! Won`t be reading anything from the same author, that is for sure!!
B0036BK6MW|5.0|I think that this was Sandy's best role ever! This movie was so emotional from start to finish! Highly Recommend!
B004FOA84A|4.0|I wasn't able to finish it on lunch break, but I really enjoyed it. The only negative comment I have is that I would like to pass it on to my grandson, but there isn't any way to start it over1
078322818X|5.0|Great movie. Lots of laughs. I hadn't seen it in years and forgot how good it was. Great film to transport you back to the good times!
B005K17RU0|5.0|it's a cool ap and is easy to use, has all the necessary info I need and then some. Thanks!
B00APUQJLO|1.0|Movie has no plot, don't waste your money on this one. I would rather watch Dr. Who than this movie...
B0076DELIG|5.0|Typically, the Bosch Novels start out quite methodically as Harry pursues the final prize, a conviction.  As Harry works through all of the possibilities, Connelly is able to weave an exciting web of intrigue and twists and turns until the conclusion.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|.....page turner!  Keeps you wondering where exactly the plot is going!  As always John Grisham has done a great job on this one.
1594744769|5.0|Thought this was a pretty good book. Entertaining if you like this sort of genre. The author does a great job of taking these photos and creating a whole story behind them. I hope there is a sequel, since it ends with me wondering  what happens next??
0743216385|5.0|This is one of my favorite books of all times! Ambrose did an incredible job with this heroic piece of history.
B009H442DG|5.0|How refreshing to hear John and Olivia together again,  sounds like a Danny and Sandy reunion.  Great Christmas CD with Special guests.
B007P6PLDI|5.0|When this disc was released, fans of the band quickly noted some major flaws with the album and its bonus disc. The song &#34;Plume&#34; on the main album had been replaced with a different take of the song, various songs on the bonus discs have digital &#34;glitches,&#34; and many of the tracks on the bonus disc suffer from massive brick walling. That being said, this is still a treat.<br /><br />With the exception of the wrong take of &#34;Pulme,&#34; the remastered album sounds great, and is a nice sonic upgrade of a classic B-sides collection that stands up with the bands main albums. The music here shows everything the band is capable of from gently strummed acoustic ballads (&#34;Soothe&#34; and the band's famous cover of &#34;Landslide&#34;), psychedelic rock (&#34;Starla&#34; and Spaced&#34;) and gentle lullaby-like sing-alongs (&#34;Blue,&#34; &#34;La Dolly Vita,&#34; and &#34;Whir&#34;) Of course, the band famous distorted guitars and generation-X rock anthems are here as well. &#34;Frail & Bedazzled&#34; and &#34;Plume&#34; in particular display the bands distinct duel guitar sound, while &#34;Hello Kitty Kat&#34; and &#34;Pissant&#34; stand as some of the most ferocious songs ever recorded by the band.<br /><br />The bonus disc, on the other hand, remains a bit paltry. Besides the previously mentioned problems with loudness, some of the songs are double dipped (&#34;Why Am I So Tired&#34; and the live performance of &#34;Slunk&#34; can be found on Earphoria) and many of the songs (particularly the Pre-Gish stuff) has been widely circulated for years. Considering that this particular reissue seems more aimed for the hardcore fan, it seems like some more unreleased stuff could have been unearthed. There are some cool moments, in particular the stretch of &#34;Crawl,&#34; &#34;Cinder Open,&#34; and &#34;Blissed&#34; show the band at its most vulnerable and spacey.<br /><br />What very much makes up for the errors of the bonus disc is the extra material that comes with it. First off is a 1988 performance of the band from a Chicago cable station. Once you get past the initial shock/humor factor of seeing the band so young (Billy has hair! James looks like he's 12! D'arcy is wearing ridiculous clothes! Jimmy has a mullet!) this show makes clear just how tight the band was early on, even if the songs are not perfect. Still, one cannot deny the songwriting prowess of bandleader/songwriter/guitarist Billy Corgan when the set opens with a song that sounds like a Cure b-side and ends with a songs that's riff sounds like it could be Iron Maiden, and still works together. Also present on the DVD are some clips of the band playing various songs from 1989 to 1994.<br /><br />Also worth mentioning is the exact replica of the band's original demo cassette. Yes ladies and gentlemen, it actually comes with a cassette including the original cover art and track listing. While many may have problems finding a cassette player, it certainly still is a nice way to own a small piece of Pumpkins history.<br /><br />So despite the amateur errors made on the album and the disappointing with some of the choices made on the bonus disc, the DVD and cassette are certainly worth the price of admission.comes with it.

B00AMBLDEE|3.0|If you liked all of the other Bourne movies you'll like this one. It is right on par with the others.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|good book, not what I expected. I have read a lot about the Seals and they are all about the same issues
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|Like the interactive features of the game... easy to use... the trial game portion allowed me to play an adequate amount before requiring me to either purchase or replay the trial portion of the game.
B004TI5N38|5.0|A typical excellent Baldacci book. I have read almost all of his books and Zero Day is among the best
B006P4FBUE|3.0|This is a cute app, but I wish it had more songs. I'd even purchase more songs if they were available. Fun to mess with tho.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|huge fan of these series but this one missed the mark slightly. I actually didn't miss Matt Damon but the storyline could have given more, ready to see more. Now if you have to bring Damon back to get more, no complaints here. Good quality movie overall.
B00138EVJO|5.0|If you grew up in the 60's Bob Dylan is a name you are very familiar with. One of the greatest songwriters of his time and his music had been done by many other musicians. This is a collection of music that will never fade with time and even the younger generation can appreciate what he sang about. Terriric
B0088O11NU|1.0|Game restarts itself after the fourth level and then takes you back to the beginning. Playing it on a Gen 1 Kindle fire. Very frustrating.
B0040GWKDK|5.0|Without a doubt some of the best music you will ever listen to Bruce is not only a great musician but one of the best performers you will ever see in concert. Loaded with tracks that everyone will be able to relate too, his music touches the soul of everyone. You can't listen to &#34;The Boss&#34; and not be moved by what you hear.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Brings to life all the fairy tale creatures, evil and good, again!  All the stories you knew are now alive and well and continuing on with their lives in a small town.  Cursed to our world by the evil queen, they are now trying to find their way back to their beloved home.  However evil is as evil does and it is not so easy to set things right.  Each episode you along with &#34;Snow&#34; and &#34;Charming&#34; and even a few new characters in the mix can endeavor to find their way home and back with the ones that they love!
B00AE2J93I|4.0|My wife and I enjoyed killing a few hours with this. It's light fun with a predictable story line. Similar to Monster House.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|I am an extremely busy college student. This app allows me to do my homework on my kindle fire wherever I go! I love the convenience! Best office app ever!
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|Thought Rebus had retired, but now the anti hero is back!<br /><br />Great suspenseful story that includes many of the characters woven into his former life.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great game. I had a hard time putting it down. The story line was great too. 'I'll definitely be playing more games from this company.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|This is a great book and is a good book for all ages. I love reading this classic book. Enjoy!
B008A1TIOK|5.0|This piece is an interesting and inspiring take on an original work which is often thought of as a master piece in it's own right.  You may have thought that Vivaldi's Four Seasons could never be improved, and you may be right however, have a listen to Richter's Recomposition and I think you will agree that It can be kept alive and continue to provide food for the soul.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|I like to enjoy Auction and fine good pice on ebay. I have to sit down and look for somebody bids me..
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Couldn't put down the book once I started. This book is such an awesome read. John Grisham is such a masterful author.
B007HACDLK|3.0|Flynn's crafting of stories has been running downhill for some time now and this book is no exception.  The plot isn't very exciting, little depth to the story but fortunately, because he can turn a phrase quite well, the book is readable.  Rather than rehash the entire store like many reviewers insist on doing, let me just say this is a paperback buy or even better, get on the waiting list for it at the library and you'll get your money's worth.  If you read on a Kindle, there are much better stories out there - check out 77 days in September by Gorham for a story reminiscent of the way Flynn used to write.  This book comes across more as fulfilling a contract with a publisher than anything passionate flowing out of the author.
B008BM9L72|5.0|Didn't know if i would like these books but couldn't leave them down till I had read them all in one week. Have read them again since then
B009ZAY8MM|4.0|Excellent harmony. A lost art by a great group. The music is in their voices  Bring back the Sing Off!!!
B005LAII08|5.0|Great movie and it was well worth the extra $3-4 to get this ultimate set.<br />Fast shipment<br />Perfect condition<br />Love it!
B0083DJWGO|2.0|I felt the first third of the book merited the same kind of attention I gave The Black Swan and Fooled by Randomness.  The remaining part of the book, not so much.  I skipped large sections as any underlying messages just kept getting repeated.  The irony is that Taleb is quick to point out that the best and most significant writings have stood the test of time - referencing Greek classics.  I don't believe this will get beyond a year.<br />My son-in-law had this on his Christmas list.  I bought him Nate Silver's book....
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Fun, Fun - the graphics are good - love the sounds coming from the birds. The game is addictive. It is a challenge to get to the next level.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|The Jack Reacher novels are the best escapism around.<br />Buy into his way of life (no possessions and a biblical sense of justice) and you can escape into his world at whim.
B009IU6N5Y|4.0|I am not the type who likes any of the vampire movies.<br />And I also do not like gory movies.<br /><br />This movie has vampires and lots of killings.<br /><br />So why did I like it?<br />The vampire scenes throught the movie, and the killings, are done in a more subtle way than depicted in most modern movies.<br /><br />At the same time the special effects for the other scenes in the movie were top shelf.<br /><br />I also felt caught up in the twist on history to depict how Lincoln fought the vampires and how they effected everything during his life.<br /><br />The director did a great job in putting the story together on film.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|If you are a Jack Reacher fan - that is - you suspend reality and buy into his way of life completely, then you will love this book. Ladies, if there were such a guy, would we want to know him?  Or would we be content to read about him?
B008JGSM6G|5.0|nice puzzle and slightly addictive.the beginning levels are great for children. I like the originality of it yet it's simplicity of concept. I would recommend this to anyone who has an idle moment
B0093H8H8I|5.0|If you don't need the raw processing power of i5 or i7, this will do just fine.  Am using it to upgrade from an AMD Athlon 4000 and find the WEI jump by 2.  Low power, adequate graphics power, would recommend this to any one - though perhaps not worth the extra $10-15 over i3-3220 if considering a discrete graphics card.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Fantastic, I can't wait for House of Hades! Rick Riordan's books are always filled with adventure and magical moments.  Love them!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This is not a book I would normally read, but my grandson recommended it.  I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it
B000002KIK|5.0|great quality cd
B00866H7SS|3.0|Too similar to Fifty Shades, what is it with this obsession about young very rich dark secrets men? Only redeeming feature is that the command of words is much better
B005SS2QXS|3.0|It's an ok case, but I'm not using it anymore on my 4S. It's a bit too flimsy and too long in size, so the phone slides around, up and down, a bit. I assumed some &#34;squishiness&#34; since it's silicone, but the fit wasn't good enough for me.
1881273156|1.0|I read this book prior to becoming a follower of Christ. Even then, I was struck by how vague the author's reference to the God of the Bible was. I remembered about the book a couple of months ago. Found it on the shelf. Looked through the book. Looked up the author's oficial site. \\"Dr. Gary Chapman seeks to fulfill his call to the ministry as a pastor, speaker, and author.\\" Written by a pastor? Not a single Bible verse in the whole entire book?
B005LAII3U|5.0|i am a big fan of syfy. i watch over 200 movies a year (movies are better than whats on t.v) and i have to say this for me was the best movie of the year. syfy at ist best with lost of action !!! i will watch over and over !!!
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|Visually pretty but bland. It's almost a shot for shot remake of the original film that has none of the charm.
B009JZTOG8|2.0|***Overall Show***<br />Show is solid, season 1 showed real promise.  Very reminiscent of LOST (each episode is about one character, frequent & revealing flashbacks, super-natural forces, examines the nature of faith).  Suffers from occasionally lazy writing and &#34;Deus Ex Machina&#34; style resolutions.  David Nolan cries a little too often.<br /><br />***Season 2***<br />After a solid first season, season 2 is lazy and a little disappointing.  It's not terrible, but it's surprising after a solid first season.  It seems like they had solid ideas for the overall story arc of season 1, and then were left scrambling to find ways to fill a second season.  Also the writing has changed and is lazier, and with less attention to solid character development.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Author gave a very good description of what it is like to be a member of this elite Special Operations group!  When he described the blow by blow details of the mission that took down Bin Laden, you felt like you were right there with them.  The mind set of these men who decided to achieve this level of expertise in their field is fascinating!  When this book first came out there was so much talk on TV about the breach of confidentiality and release of classified information.  There was absolutely no breach that I could see - strictly from a Seal's day to day point of view.  Highly recommend!
B000HZGCEG|1.0|Really bad! Crappy script, bad acting, kind of confusing plot, tedious....We weren't expecting Kingdom of Heaven but this was really close to Men in Tights.
B009ZE27US|1.0|Forts it said I was 27, than 24, than 18, than 28. HELLO! I'm, like, 13!This thing is dumb. Don't wast ur time.
B00A6PD8RQ|2.0|This was an OK movie until the plot started, then it got weird. Probably OK if you were under 7 years old.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Greatest zombie entertainment since the Dawn of the Dead movie. Its a must watch television show for all of us that are tired of the reality craze. Thank you for giving us zombie junkies something to look forward to each week.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|What can I say? Daria is just the best! Can't go wrong with the complete series! Just wish they had been able to get the rights to the original music used.
B006YTTVHO|3.0|just to kick it of and for begginers is quite ok. in the end is just basic interpersonal interactions that we should know.
B00A7CI82I|3.0|I was a bit disappointed in this one. The first few were great and this was eh. Same type of action scenes. Literally the same.
1451613512|5.0|This book is criticized in the mass media for its bias.  It is biased.  Biased, however, is not the same as inaccurate and I have not read any accusations on that score. You'll know far more than you did,  after reading what has not been told before..
B00003CXZ1|5.0|Movie fast moving, good as I first saw it in theater or on TV - can't remember which.  Fast moving, good color, good sound.  I would recommend to anyone.  I liked it because it is the same as when I first saw it.  I always want the original versions.  Thx.<br />Cecy Ivie
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|The most entertaining movie I've seen in a long time. Tommy Lee Jones acted his heinie off! I fully expected Steve Carrel to play the comedy role but Jones was the star. Definitely a film for more mature audiences!
B00AGE20ZI|5.0|A friend of mine has watched this movie every Christmas season since she was in her teens. On her recomendation my husband and I watched it. The movie will now be included in the &#34; must watch&#34; category at Christmas time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book, it was an easier read which is nice sometimes and it created a good escape from everyday life.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This is an awesome game! I love how you get to draw your own characters and your weapons this app is so cool this is all I do on my free time it is worth the 1.99 you have to pay
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Great read! Couldn't put it down. These characters are so easy to relate to. Eager to read the next book.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|It thought this book was pretty good, it had a good story line and kept me interested. I would recommend this book.
B000YHG72E|2.0|Giving a Christmas movie a bad review feels like kicking a puppy but it had an utterly generic plot. Much of the humor is derived from the awkward social encounters that occur when Buddy, a human raised by Santa's elves travels to New York to find his father. My family doesn't like embarrassment humor, so we squirmed at scenes that others may find funny.  But predictably, Buddy wins over all of the cynical New Yorkers he meets. And then it Christmas and Christmas needs to be saved by some combination of Buddy's special tallents and the renewed faith in the Christmas spirit. We've seen it before in Ghostbusters 2.<br />Parents can be assured that there are no offensive parts that I remember but Christian parents will likely not be happy with the fact that Christmas is entirely about Santa, Christ gets no mention that I recall.<br />Which brings up my last problem which is we don't need another Christmas movie that whose central conflict is the existence of Santa. We have the Miracle on 32nd Street, the Santa Clause, Prancer, and the Polar Express. If we want kids to believe in Santa, we shouldn't raise the issue so much. And there has to be more that can written about Christmas than a contrived, tired story such as Elf. There are plenty of people for whom my problems with the movie are of no concern. Great, I sincerely hope you enjoy the movie.
B00991TCOG|5.0|The best I can describe her music is that it is really different, but really cool. I wouldn't have thought that she could have gotten the sounds she did from a violin. Nice to hear that she composed her own music too. Very talented (and cute) girl.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|I have seen it in this version and the foreign version with different actors<br />The foreign film followed the book more closely, but the actors In this version were perfectly suited to their rolls.<br />It is a disturbing film.
B005LAJ212|5.0|I love this series and wanted to purchase the collection. I was able to get this set from Amazon for a great price! I am so glad to have it!
B0031ES8P6|3.0|In the photo, the dress and bow appear to be purple. The tartan is actually pink in color. I thought I received the wrong one. I'm not going to bother with sending it back, it will work for what I purchased it for. The price also dropped almost $1 in two days.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I had the privilege to see Imagine Dragons live a few weeks ago and I LOVED them as soon as they started to play the first song and I had never even heard of them before- the hubs and I had tickets to see Garbage and Imagine Dragons headlined for them. The beat was the kind that gets into your body and just rocks the s*** out of it. I especially loved the lead singer and his drumming abilities; he was what I would call a \\"panty dropper\\" because he was seriously appealing and the women in that place were going nuts when he was on stage. I could tell that the guys in this band really love their music and actually appreciate their fans and have what most musicians these days don't have: modesty and humility. It was loud and just a bit rowdy and I dug it, period.
B0076NKNLA|3.0|Michelle William's is great as Marilyn but I just found the movie to be ehhh?!? Still worth watching but I don't know if I'd own it.
B009CPES4I|5.0|The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel has a terrific cast.  Tom Wilkinson in particularly good in his role.  The performances are at turns thoughtful and entertaining.  Dev Patel adds a great light-hearted feel to it.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I can't believe this show is on the air!! I mean that in a good way. So much TV is regurgitated crap and this is so odd and fun. I like that it seems to be the same characters every season telling you a different horror story. Jessica Lange is by far the star of this show. So many good character though.
B005CRY2O6|5.0|Always good to have new recipes for vegetarian daughter-in-law and these recipes are unique as well as tasty.  She will appreciate the new ones
B00AA7O22U|4.0|I gave this 4 stars not because it's cinematic gold, but because it's exactly what you think it will be. All those action heros from when we were kids blowing stuff up!! It's cheesy and fun. Don't regret watching this at all!!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This app works good with my kindle fire. This is a fun,  time passing game. It is difficult to win, but it offers lots of free playing time.
1423136802|5.0|I was hesitant when I bought the box set, not knowing wheather or not I'd enjoy the writting. Sure I had an idea that I would like the plot (who doesn't love a good story involving the Greek GODS?) But it's targeted to kids and while I really enjoyed Harry Potter, sometimes I wished for a bit more description in the writting.<br /><br />But, much to my enjoyment Rick Riordan more than delivers in this series! I bought and read this months ago and fell in love with everything from the plot, dialouge, characters and writting. He made me laugh, tear up a few times and just fall in love with this series. And I will admit I stayed up many a night devouring several of the books knowing there was another one waiting just there on my stand for me to read. Alas, when I reached The Last Olympains I was bittersweet; more than exitcted to find out the ending yet sorely dissapointed that there was no more to be read.<br /><br />Also, to those who saw the movie before reading the books, you are in for a treat my friend for the books are infinatly better than the movie!<br /><br />Percy is every bit the loveable slightly knuckleheaded, single-minded hero that we all love. His goal is one thing and one thing only: saving his mother. But hey, if he can help out some others along the way he'd do it. And that's one of the reason I enjoyed the series (apart from the witty humor, brilliant plot, and unexpected twists) is that Percy doesnt mind helping some Gods out (I didnt know the needed help, did you?) and he's the modern (or ancient depending on your perception) knight promomoting the basic social values in life; respect, love, peace, and a acknowledging the diffrences and strengths of people. Even if you don't like them.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Works great on kindle fire. Check out weather for different locations, maps (radar), future forecasts, etc. Would definately recommend this app.
0545265355|3.0|Hype is what it is for I strongly think that Suzanne Collins had a wonderful, amazing idea but could not deliver. Now I say that about the entire SERIES because the first book, The Hunger Games is brillant. I loved the first book.<br /><br />The second one I forced myself through purely on hope and a false sense of 'it will get better! Just give it a chance!'<br /><br />And the last one I feel like she didnt even try. It was told completly in the past tense! The entire series went from unbeliveable plot, characters, storyline, adventure and love (I have my bone to pick with the love bit but I'll keep it to myself) to...nothing. There was so much she could have done with the ending, yes I understand that war can take its toll and break the best of us but the Katniss she made us love just dissapears.<br /><br />I do recomend people reading the Hunger Games though, but stop about 10 pages before the end of the first book.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|It was great to actually  put a face to some of the characters from family guy.However i was disappointed about the humor i expected it to have a family guy feel to it
B008BM9L72|4.0|not quite up to the hype in the meader<br />havent seen the other two yet ( missing)<br />see sent email
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It read like the Grisham of old, The Firm is my favorite Grisham book, and I have read them all. I enjoyed reading this almost as much as I did reading The Firm. If you are a Grisham fan, this is a must read. If you are not a fan, read this and you will become one.
B005OT2YVA|1.0|This movie made me naseous. Honestly, not a big Transformer or Bay fan, but this is pretty poor. For the triple digit millions of dollars they threw at this they could have had a more realistic intro- JFK and Nixon computer generated persons throw the shark before the movie even gets the story going. There is no suspension of disbelief built up in this, building off of our hope of talking cars instead of making us believe. Bay's hyperkinetic style makes me feel naseous, even though I like the Bourne movies. There is just no rhyme or reason to anything in these movies. I guess thats ok for some people, but for the rest of us we'll be left wondering why people can spend $600mill on ticket sales for this instead of something with a real heart.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|can't wait for the rest of castle 's books to come out both Nikki Heat and Derek Storm. Looking forward to more.
B00999DFP0|1.0|I purchased this DVD set for my boyfriend for Christmas. He was incredibly excited and we couldn't wait to watch them. Well, lo and behold, the disks are pirated. You can't tell unless you look closely but the printing isn't very good and the disks have a lot of problems when you try to watch. If it wasn't for the fact that he so desperately wanted these we'd return them but I guess we'll just suffer through the problems...
B00633W614|5.0|This book (and the first one ) is terrific!  It held my interest from the very first page and I am soooo waiting for the final book.<br />You will love it.
B007EECSFA|3.0|I am going against a lot of reviewers when I say this, but I couldn't finish the book.  Because this was a review copy, I wrote the publisher saying why.  It hopped back and forth between one time and another and between one person and another. I didn't find it interesting.<br /><br />I see I'm in the minority, but I needed to say it.
B008BM9L72|3.0|I purchased the trilogy so felt obliged to read the books because I had paid for them.  I also wanted to know why everyone was raving about these books.  Sorry, I am still mystified although many people have tried to convince me that I am missing something here!  So poorly written.  Dreadful syntax and prose.  Lucky author who has made millions from writing absolute drivel.
B00A7CI82I|4.0|I don't rate movies often but watch plenty of them. That being said the movie wasn't terrible, but it was lacking to some extent on a few things.<br />The movie proved difficult to follow at times, and was extremely fragmented with regard to the storyline. It was action packed, but sometimes became very predictable and it didn't begin tying in much of the prior movies until closer to the end.<br />I would recommend as a good watch, but for me I wish I hadn't have had my hopes as high as I did for the movie.
B000YHG72E|5.0|One of the best Christmas movies!! If you haven't seen it you should.. it is a must see for our family every year!!
B007PBKG5G|5.0|Alabama Shakes brings you back to the future.  This is one of those albums that will make you stop and listen.  Great voice, great guitar, great rhythm.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|I love Nelson DeMille's books but this one read as if someone else had written it.  Plot illogical, stilted dialog except when Corey's being his usual self, incredible amount of exposition disguised as dialog.  Very disappointing.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|If you're an Alien and Ridley Scott fan then you really need to see this. It does tell the story (prequel) to ALIEN. It's great to find out about the space jockey and know how the alien started. It's a beautiful movie as Ridley Scott always does and has a great story and some good suspenseful moments. It's not as dark as ALIEN but don't expect it. It's a different story and just plain good.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Not loaded with specials or anything, people can whine about the lack of this or that... But this is what it is, a Collection, it's not LTD it's not a Special, it's years 1-8 pure and simple.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Great action adventure story.  Learned a lot about Yemen and its intrinsic people.  But the constant wisecracking of John Corey started to get annoying and kept it from a 5 star.
B000B5XOYI|5.0|Nothing to fancy here, you get each movie in it's own case, which is always nice.<br />As long as you just want the Collection, this is perfect.
B007HACDLK|4.0|story was well constructed and laid out.  However the ending just hit you in the face.  I just ended.  that was my only disappiontment
B0055PGUYU|5.0|i'm glad i bought this book; i'm sure i will refer back to it from time to time.  thank you.
B008VNIBFO|5.0|Another case of an Academy Award heist: I love All About Eve, but Sunset DESERVED that year's Best Picture over Eve.  Made today, it would deserve Best Picture.  Made ANY year, it would deserve Best Picture.  It's that perfect in every way.  And as much as I loved Judy Holliday, Swanson was also robbed.  Her performance is easily one of the ten best female performances in Hollywood history.  She's riveting, start to finish.  And what a finish!  The final scene, once seen, will stay with you forever.  Come to think of it, the opening scene, the pool, will stay with you forever, too.  Wilder WAS a genius.  Holden, Olson, and Von Stroheim especially, are also giving perhaps their greatest performances in Sunset.  SEE THIS MOVIE.  If you're one of those folks who don't care for &#34;older&#34; movies, drop the 'tude and see it.  Forget it's 1950, it's black-and-white instead of color, and it's about a faded and hopelessly neurotic silent film star on the verge of a comeback (sorry - a RETURN).  JUST SEE IT!
B008NEMN0K|5.0|The DTS HD sound and 3d make this movie even more enjoyable to watch ,my wife even watched it again, she doesn't watch movies more that once!
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|As always Sparks has a winner. I love reading his books. At first it was dragging along, but, it had to get you into the characters first. It took longer for me to get hooked on the characters than it normally did, but once I got hooked into the characters then there was no putting it down. I found myself not liking where the two characters were heading, then the twist came and it changed the direction of where it ended...which is one of the reasons why Sparks is such a good author. It is a good book and I would reccommend the book to anyone who likes this type of reading.
B007SAKSF2|5.0|Because she requested it as the only Christmas gift to by for her this year 2012<br />Blur has been a constant all through the different music she has listened to, but she always came back to Blur..
B003O86FMW|5.0|I started this book the moment I finished the first book and had it finished in a matter of 2 days.  It was so good I could not stop reading it.  I caught myself reading and driving.  That's when I knew I had it bad.<br /><br />The whole trilogy was such a great read!
B0018PJEYY|5.0|I have had a musical love affair with The Moody Blues ever since the late Sixties.<br />I just can't fault their particular soft and beautiful style; totally the very best.
B007HC3LHS|2.0|I would not recommend this book.  I didn't even bother finishing it.  Don't waste your time there are so many really good books out there!
B0018BB20W|5.0|I had never heard anything like it before. A rock - pop band to collaborate with an entire orchestra.<br />Then to produce the haunting &#34; Nights In White Satin &#34;. This is what got me started in the love affair with this unique sound.<br />TWO THUMBS UP!!!!!
B004GYY714|5.0|LOVE IT  LOVE IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  This is the best station I ever heard.  Keep up the good work  I will tell all my friends
B0053O89KG|5.0|Honestly, I don't own any of the series on dvd, nor do I watch them on tv.  The reason I started watching this show is because my girlfriend is a fan of it (and other crime dramas & murder mysteries like C.S.I. or Sherlock Holmes) and she's a Nathan Fillion fan (hard to compete against that dude :P).<br /><br />The show is great though and while I had my reservations about it at first, I quickly grew to enjoy the chemistry between Castle & Beckett- the back & forth, banter and flirtatious relationship that constantly gets side-stepped or trumped by crimes, circumstances, or mixed signals.  It's a great combination of comedy, action, suspense & crime drama with a cool supporting cast and smart writing (first couple of seasons, at least).<br /><br />The 4th season continues with the &#34;will they / won't they?&#34; back & forth of author Castle and detective Beckett, but it's done well, given a series like this can't keep it up forever because it'll get stale.  I haven't watched the 5th season yet, so I can't comment on whether the quality maintains or declines, but the first 4 seasons have been good.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Not as good as viewing on a computer but it works pretty well for an app.  I'd recommend it without question.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my girlfriend (who's a big SH fan of the movies and the books and old tv series). We both loved these new movies with Robert Downey Jr. as Holmes and Jude Law as Watson (great chemistry) and the action, adventure, mystery & suspense are all done really well and remind me of the Pirates of the Caribbean movies with great stories, actors, special effects and set pieces.  This sequel was done well and leaves the possibility of another, 2nd sequel open if Hollywood so desires. I'd see more!
B00005N7Z1|5.0|The movie is just one of my favorites for the era. The quality is great on this DVD, and the shipping was right on time. Thanks so much.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I'm not very far into the book yet, but I can see why it is a classic. Deeper and more philosophical than typical books.  I'm loving it!  It makes one think.
B000SEGUDE|1.0|The book had no real plot and seemed to go nowhere. I hope the movie is better than the book. Wish I hadn't wasted my time.
0385535147|5.0|Exciting, twists and turns!  Typical John Grisham writing.  What a great story teller!  I would recommend this book to anyone enjoying excitement and fast paced reading!
B006O6F932|5.0|Rápido y en execelentes condiciones. Es un buen juguete. recomendado para niñas. La tienda fué responsable con el envío. Gracias.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|Kept me entertained, but honestly I like the older version a lot better. I also think that this movie would have been a bit hard to follow had I not seen the other version first.

0395389496|5.0|I love Chris Van Allsburg. I think the pictures in his books are beautiful and this applies to the Polar Express.  My toddler enjoys trains and not only does he sit still long enough to look at this book, but he often requests it more than once.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Hunger games is a great series of books......read<br />and hope the movies do their best to put the<br />story forward for your interest
B0083DJWGO|4.0|This is a more difficult read than Black Swan, mainly because Taleb seems to ramble.  I love reading, studying, and watching Taleb, so I found the book entertaining.  The book attempts to provide a solution to dealing with Black Swans, but it really is like sitting at a cafe listening to Taleb ramble on all day.  That's a good thing for me, as I find the man very interesting.  Taleb discussed fragility, robustness, and anti-fragility, providing examples of each.  He also goes on many side trips about ancient philosophers, and modern finance and risk management.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great set of books.........Nervous about the movies,<br />but always recommend a read of the stories before<br />seeing any movie.  The characters and the actual<br />thought that this might happen one day....is very<br />intriguing.
B000O5AYC0|3.0|This record arrived earlier than the deadline. I was very pleased with the early arrival and how it was packaged. The seller also noted the slight damage to the corner of the packaging, this ended up being so slight. However, whenever i play the vinyl there are some pitch problems. I trust the buyer didn't know about this and I don't blame them. I compared this record to other records in my collection and the problem lies with this vinyl only. Vinyl is a tricky thing to sell and send. I've considered returning this record but I'm choosing to live with the imperfections instead.<br /><br />Above all, I want people to know this seller did very well in the important areas: packaging and arrival time. Thank you!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved the Hunger Games series, not always happy<br />with the movie versions of some of the books I read.<br />Think there should be a touch more of the book<br />to make it more surreal.
0375413405|5.0|Saw the movie, read the book, had to have the cookbook.  EXCELLENT<br /><br />Really, 8 more words required?  That is stupid.  Really, Really Really Really Really Supid.
B005COO1X6|1.0|It's good, if you love Stephen King and his weird stories.  This was just<br />too weird for me, but just maybe that am getting older and taste have<br />changed some.  Although a good Stephen King diehard would like this.
B000X97Z60|4.0|I discovered Kamelot through Pandora, based on the likes of Dream Theater and Symphony X.  Kamelot isn't quite on the level of those bands, but I have really enjoyed this album, and I will be checking out more from them.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised about the story that unfolded in this book.  I honestly bought it because the reviews were good and I felt like reading a love story, but it ended up being a much better journey than expected.  The characters were solid and real and as I read, I felt as if I really wanted to know what happened to them. Overall, it was a great read and I will be purchasing more books by this author.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The premise of this whole trilogy is like that of a video game.  Adolescent angst is fine but this is overboard.
B006TLFPKO|4.0|The books were a great read. I felt I really needed to see the movies.  They are entertaining, but the books were much better.  The movies leave a lot out, but are still fun.
B003O86FMW|4.0|The premise of this whole trilogy is like that of a video game.  Adolescent angst is fine but this is overboard.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|A friend recommended this show -- I'm hooked. I'm looking forward to seeing the new episodes starting in February 2013.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|The premise of this whole trilogy is like that of a video game.  Adolescent angst is fine but this is overboard.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I love that the heroine wasn't wimpy or hesitant. She was strong and decisive when she needed to be, yet still had great emotional depth. A perfect match for her man, who was so sure he had it all figured out.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|Works like a charm on Kindle Fire HD! Great way to access Windows 8 Operating environment. Easy to navigate by swiping.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this series! End of the world appocolyps and it's survival of the fittest? Plenty of story line and even with zombies looming every ware there is still time for romance, drama, and betrayal, and comedy! Keeps you wanting more from each episode!
B003H6KRIE|1.0|these movies wouldn't be bad if they weren't filmed by a cameraman having an epileptic seizure every time there was suppose to be action.  I guess they do that because the actor can't do action scenes competently.
B005WYFLNU|2.0|My daughter received this as a gift, and has spent some hours with it. I like that the clothing stickers are reusable and there are multiple scenes. However, the clothing and scenes are unapologetic stereotyping, and the clothing can not be used on multiple pages as the pictured girls are in different poses. Thus the dresses from one scene all have raised arms, while the arms in another scene are all down. This is frustrating for the small people. In addition the pages began falling out of the binding almost immediately, so the book is now in pieces and it is hard to keep everything together. I would feel better about this toy if the clothing and scenes were more interchangeable, and if there were some less stereotyped clothing options. I wouldn't buy this again.
B00136JS12|5.0|I ususally buy the CD's and then rip to my iTunes. I have to admit it was a great price and really easy to download and add to my iTunes library.  I will be looking for downloadable CD's first on future music purchases.
0738727326|5.0|This deck is beautiful nd amazing. I love it and use it everyday. The readings are insightful and quite beautiful.
0470474874|5.0|Having read most of the general purpose Excel manuals, I believe this one is the most detailed and easiest to understand. It delves into enough detail for more advanced users who want that bit more, but also provides less advanced users with great ideas to help them forward.<br />For me this is the standout Excel reference, its name of Excel Bible is for good reason. Highly recommended.
B007HACDLK|5.0|What can one say, adventurous suspenseful victory over really bad guys is what I like. Interesting twists, be they somewhat predictable or not keep my attention and this one has them. I like our people to be very proficient and at least one step ahead in  overcoming corruption and incompetent Washington bureacracy to protect our Nation and way of life.<br />I like no ambivalence in the distinction between right and wrong. I like world wide action . I like gratifying unabashed closure to each novel even when more challenges are foreshadowed . The Last Man Standing, like virtually all of Flynn's Mitch Rapp centered novels, delivers these components in abundance.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Awesome show.. amazing writers.. full of action and suspense. All three seasons are exciting.  I can't wait to see how it all ends.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This is a very good read. The story is interesting and the main character is likeable and funny. This would be a good Kevin Smith movie.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Can't say you can go wrong with Timothy Ferriss, you will learn interesting things in a very entertaining book.  I still take everything with a grain of salt, but have seen success in most everything I have gotten from his books.  This book is a prime example, I have not finished the book the first 3 chapters have been enough that I would suggest people read it.
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|I was expecting it to be a little funnier longer.. If that makes sense.. The beginning was funny and it ended on a warm fuzzy note. Maybe it's one of those movies that's funnier when you're intoxicated? Overall just ok IMO. I wouldn't rent it again/buy the movie, but I'm not mad I did.
B004EKCNMA|5.0|Really like the movie, as always Jim Carrey did a great job.<br /><br />Be warned a Disney movie that is a little dark.  My 6 year old daughter was okay watching it but there are some scary parts that made her jump and some graphic zombies in the movie.  This is not the Mickey Mouse version.
B004W1GCQO|3.0|This is okay, but pales in comparison to Downton Abbey. I have watched two episodes. My husband, who adores DA, left the room from boredom.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|If you like zombie shows then you should love this one. It's very action packed but a little to gory at times for me. Still I can't wait till season resumes. I don't like these long mid-season breaks.
B003EVWDR0|5.0|I love this movie. It has a great storyline it has a good meaning behind it and it's something new that has never been done before.

B00006AFF5|5.0|I looked everywhere locally and could only find the cartoon version.  Jim Carrey's version is the best.  No one else could portray the GRINCH as good as he can.  He is one of my favorite actors.  Christmas has to include this version of How The Grinch Stole Christmas.<br /><br />Lois Johnston

B0070Y46UY|5.0|This was a really great book.  Quite a page turner.  I would highly recommend it (though I probably wouldn't want to see it as a movie due to graphic scenes)
B005K17RU0|5.0|It tells you the weather in hour increments for a day, or daily for 15 days, it gives a good idea of the weather; temp, sun, rain, snow, ice, wind. I found this to be really accurate locally instead of vaguely like other apps.
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|It had it's funny moments, but overall it was very dry and long. There wasn't enough comedy in it and it was more serious. Yet Tommy lee jones and meryl streep did an excellent job in this movie they played the parts really well. This is a movie for a couple who is struggling with there own sex live who don't have a clue to get back the spice in there life, this would be good for that kind of person to watch. Otherwise it's not one I personally would ever watch again. Thanks!
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I got this because it was free, but the forecast for storms didn't seem to come out very accurate so I switched to Accuweather.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|An excellent follow up to Season 1 that changes the game enough to keep things fresh without sacrificing the magic that made it amazing in the first place.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It lets you get on facebook without getting on your web browser, I like that part about it. The one thing I miss from my laptop is that I don't see peoples birthdays anymore.
B000S0GYRU|4.0|I love this film, so much so that I made the decision to pay extra for the special edition. The second disc, for lack of a better term, is boring and not very special. If you want to own the film save a dollar and get the standard edition. Trust me you'll be glad you did! : )
B000OXHRRC|5.0|One of my all time favorite couple movies--a little something for everyone:<br />action, competition, romance, love, decisions, humor, and superb acting.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|Love it!!! What a great story and written so well! Sounds like Cinder will be the new Katniss! ;-) Highly recommended!
B004J64QSI|5.0|In anticipation of the film coming out on Christmas, I decided I needed to familiarize myself with the full score.  I've never seen the show but had heard a couple of the songs over the years.  I was blown away by this concert presentation, and listened to it at least once a day the first week I discovered it.  This is truly a dream cast (well, almost) and Alfie Boe as Jean Valjean is phenomenal.  I'm talking tears and goosebumps.  Be sure to watch all the encores -- while I don't believe any rendition can ever top Boe's Bring Him Home, the 4 Valjeans do come close. If only they could have found another Marius...  this one weakness in the cast is unfortunate, but not enough to take away a star.
B005DOKM9M|5.0|Got this case as a gift with my Kindle Fire in March 2012. Fire does fit very snugly, but as a one-time shipper, if you want to protect something you do not leave it any room to move around, so I was cool with that fact. The chemical smell went away after like two days so the people that have complained about that are just whiners.<br />Day before yesterday I accidentally left the Kindle on top of my car while I was loading things in, then forgot to bring it down. At 35 miles per hour on the highway the Kindle caught enough air to fly off of the top of the car and hit the ski rack on it's way well over the top of the car.<br />I heard the sound and figured I had run over something that I did not see coming. When I looked in the rearview I saw what I thought was a shingle bouncing down the road behind me, slightly striking the fender of the car following me slightly then bouncing corner to corner into a ditch at the side of the road. Several hours later when I went to use the Kindle I put two and two together and dashed off to where I had seen the \\"shingle\\" bouncing behind my car.<br />Happy that I found it, it was partially submerged in a ditch and had been sitting in the rain for about 4 hours. The sleeve had swelled and the zipper was mashed, probably from where it hit the ground from the 8 foot swan dive from the top of my car to the asphalt. I was unable to open the zipper and had to force it open to check the Kindle itself. The Kindle, while cold, was dry and fired up on the first try. The only noticeable damage to the Kindle was a mark that the case zipper had made on impact, slightly marring the corner.<br />So this sleeve, while fitting quite snugly and having a chemical smell when you take it out of the bag, protected my Kindle Fire from a 7-8 foot drop to the road, a whack by a car traveling at 40mph, bouncing corner to corner across a lane of traffic, 4 hours of rain, and saturation from a mud puddle, even though the zipper was under water. This sleeve was, in my opinion, incredible. I came here to buy another one.

B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I know the blockbuster status of this movie has turned some away.....but what else could you want in a superhero supermovie?!?!?  Each hero is fantastic.  The plot is fantastic.  The humor spun throughout the dialogue is fantastic.<br />Watch the movie!
0385536828|5.0|This was really a very nice read, and though I don't have much time at the moment to read I finished this one in three days because I couldn't put it down. The pace of the story and the descriptions were very good and took me right into the story. Though one might not like all characters the way they are, I was really absorbed by the story and liked how the narration was sometimes rich in details and give my imagination on one hand food to live it and on the other hand enough space to imagine. The best part is the ending. If I was not sure at some points if I was satisfied with the developments, I most certainly liked the end and the surprise it was for me.
B009157BWU|4.0|Seriously....this movie was so great to watch with my kids.  A great story about life and wilderness.  And who doesn't like seeing chimpanzees in their natural habitats!!!
B001NLL93W|5.0|i really enjoyed this series.  they didnt write books for young adults like this when i was young, highly recommended
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Although somewhat predictable, 'Rises' was pretty freakin good.  Bane is an amazing follow up to probably the best on-screen villain - the joker.  Sorta sad to see this franchise end.....but looking forward to some sort of reboot with Robin involved.

Greeted or excoriated with that phrase by numerous other characters in the Vorkosigan saga, we've seen plenty of evidence over the years that Ivan, while not a towering intellect compared to some of the company he keeps, is no idiot. Ivan's been our handsome everyman witness and assistant, the Dr. Watson to Miles' Sherlock Holmes (without the narrative burden, of course). Tall, handsome, efficient, but more interested in chasing women and enjoying life than chasing his career, and as always, avoiding being controlled by his mother, we finally see this character get his chance to shine, and he does.<br /><br />Ivan Vorpatril is temporarily on Komarr as part of a staff inspection, when he's approached by Byerly Vorrutyer, fulltime Vor wastrel, and fulltime ImpSec civilian operative, with a request to protect a woman who has come to the mysterious attention of certain unsavory individuals of By's interest. One thing leads to another, and an attempt to sweet talk a nervous, but beautiful young woman leads to Ivan being tied to a chair in her apartment after being ambushed by the woman's unusual handmaid/companion/bodyguard. One thing leads to another and Ivan finds himself in an entirely unexpected alliance with mystery woman Tej, but is it an alliance against mysterious foes, or what can be even scarier, family on both sides?<br /><br />Witty, funny and light-hearted, Bujold, again shows what a master wordcrafter she is, crafting her lightest novel since \\"A Civil Campaign.\\" While not reaching the stratospheric quality of that romantic comedy of manners and biology, Bujold fully earns her usual 5-stars, as we follow Ivan and Tej back to Barrayar, with meetings with a number of previous cast members and the complications that can arise from family and friends, to an in-depth encounter at ImpSec HQ. This is very much a change of pace compared to the deathly serious (pun-intended), dealingswith death that we experienced in \\"Cryoburn.\\"<br /><br />This is very much Ivan's (and Tej's) story, but we get nice supporting turns from By and, happily, Simon Ilyan (and a good bit of Lady Alys, of course). Gregor, Duv & Delia Galeni, are just some of the past cast we meet again. Miles? He gets a memorable cameo along with Ekaterin and Gregor in Chapter 10, with most of it from Tej's point of view, with Miles being \\"the Coz\\" in her internal thoughts, and Emperor Gregor \\"The Gregor.\\" As much fun as it is to see Miles, we get him for just the one chapter, and toned down enough that he doesn't even take over the chapter, in itself a remarkable achievement of writing.<br /><br />Set 5 years after \\"A Civil Campaign\\" and 4 years before \\"Cryoburn,\\" this novel continues Bujold's willingness to go back and forth across her timeline. The novels have always been stand-alone successes, although, as she correctly points out, there are certain arcs that improve reading enjoyment when read in order. \\"Captain Vorpatril's Alliance\\" is yet more evidence that Boujold is one of the best writers alive.
B009X00E18|1.0|This is a cheap excuse for the Fire.  If you want just a little protection from scratching and whatnot, and don't mind overspending, then this is your case.  Otherwise got for something a little more sturdy, and hopefully with more value.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|So far I'm loving it...can play just long enough to use my coins come back in few hrs play a few more min...that's all the time a busy mom has!
B008458O3S|5.0|I really enjoyed this little game.  It's easy to learn but the puzzles are definately challenging and fun to solve.
B009SJ3H8Q|4.0|Great show. Different than season 1, but plenty of creepy stuff and mystery to keep you interested! Go watch it!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've used this on the EVO 4G and the Droid RAZR and it is far superior in both cases to the stock keyboard.  For a time a switched to Swype, but SwiftKey still ended up being more reliable as far as predictions and the like go.  A must have.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|First of all if you've read Colleen's previous books (Slammed and Point of Retreat) you know what a brilliant writer she is. Second, Hopeless is so incredibly good that there really aren't any words I can say to do the book justice. So instead of writing my review of the book, I will give advise on the steps you should take once you purchase Hopeless (because you really need to). The first thing you need to do is clear out an entire day to designate to this book; you will not be able to stop once you start. Depending on how fast you read and/or how many chapter breaks you will need to take to regroup after reading some intense scenes (there's quite a few of those), you may need to cancel out the next morning, too. Lastly, prepare yourself for the most brilliant book you will ever read because once you finish this book you will never be the same person you were prior to reading it.<br /><br />Colleen, you are fricken amazing!
B002SYXCVK|3.0|While I always love his sardonic humor and dark undertones, his vocal tones seem to be much more unstable and deep.  I was taken a bit aback, but still enjoyed the songs.
0471463396|1.0|I was initially excited when I first read this book, but my enthusiasm dimmed when I tried to use it in real life.  My main problem is that if you sit down and think about the author's Earnings Power Value formula for valuing stocks there are some problems with it.  It says that the value of a stock is equal to its adjusted earnings divided by its cost of capital.  But there are two different methods for calculating the cost of capital.  I started out using the Dividend Growth Model.  Many of the stocks I looked at had a cost of capital of around 2%.  That results in a valuation of the company at 50 times earnings.  No sensible investor would pay more than 20 times earnings.  To take it to an absurd extreme,  by that formula if the company did not pay a dividend and had no debt, the cost of capital would be 0%.  That would result in the stock having an infinite value.  I next went to the Capital Asset Pricing Model.  That resulted in some more reasonable valuations.  The question I have is that if there are 2 different methods of calculating cost of capital and they can result in widely varying percentages, how reliable is it as a method for accurately valuing stocks?  I think I'll stick with Security Analysis and The Intelligent Investor.

B005VT42BS|3.0|I can only get it to pick up 2 devices when I have 6 connnected.  So it is not working for me.
B009SJ3GUK|1.0|This story makes no sense. It isn't a continuation of the first season. It is a totally different show altogether. I only watched 1 episode because it didn't make any sense to me.
B009XY97VC|4.0|I'm a huge fan of trailer music like this, but I have to say, there were a couple of songs on this album that dragged on, and weren't really as epic as I expected from Two Steps From Hell.<br />Still very worth purchasing though!
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I got this for my son for Christmas, but haven't stopped playing with it long enough to wrap it up.
B009S33I68|5.0|An epic story of the bravery and dedication of the American fighting man written from first hand accounts.  They overcame being out numbered and low on supplies to winning an important battle in Vietnam.  I've read it four times and now having it on my Kindle, I'll read it as often as I can.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Much different story than season 1 and I love it a lot more! I was expecting nothing but the best and this is the best story yet. I LOVE Evan Peters!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|At first I didn't know what to think. When I got to the second book, I almost quit as I thought it was just sex. A friend said to continue so I did. I'm so glad. It was really good and I will probably read it again. Have recommended it to several people. And I'm finding that so many people have read it.
B00884GR0W|1.0|I played this because I'm waiting for 0.6.0 on minecraft pe and I have to say this has the worst controls ever. they put the controls too low.
1419707663|5.0|Good deal. Cheaper than buying the books individually at the store. The books arrived quickly and my nephew loved them.
3836501899|5.0|its a fun book to look . great pictures,great references .it was fun to have polaroids thats for sure. worth buying it
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Star Wars Movies have always been great.  This<br />is a gift for a family member for Christmas, so we<br />have not opened it up to play them.  Looking forward<br />to seeing their face when it is opened.
1419704400|5.0|sometime American vogue is very commercial and old,its not edgy,its not cool,its an old lady but this book is so well edited and mostly all the great shoot that has been done its in this book. its totally worth every penny.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Amazon replaced my existing cable (which was not functioning properly) with this.  Works great and charges the device in less time!
030758836X|3.0|I just finished the book. The thing about Gone Girl is that you are expecting a certain genre of storytelling and instead you get all genres. Romance? Check! Mystery? Check! Comedy? Check! Thriller? Check! However, the book only works as satire.  Unless you think of it as satire, you are going to find the actions of the characters COMPLETELY unbelievable, especially toward the end of the book.  The two main characters are pretty well-developed--but there are so many twists and turns that you have to keep revising your opinions, so much that you are left confused and you end up disliking everyone. I didn't really like either of the protagonists early in the book, so I guess my dislike for them only deepened.<br /><br />Overall, pretty well-written. At certain points the novel feels long and treads water. I almost threw the book at part two. The author relies a lot on the trope of \\"hanging a lampshade\\" on certain unbelievable events or character names. Again, certain character behaviors do not read true or in order to make them square, the character has to be written one dimensionally. Very well structured novel, but even a satire should make sense at the end.<br /><br />Another criticism? It doesn't paint women in the best light. Women here are pretty much placed in boxes. Even though the author makes fun of corny romantic comedies with stereotyped behaviors, most of the women are written as stereotypes or are one-dimensional.<br /><br />It's a long read for something that won't be satisfying, but you will enjoy getting to the let down.

B009HEJXFS|4.0|It had good effects but the story at times got to predictable. They could use some newer ideas. If your going to try to make a movie seem serious, Just be serious and leave the dumb jokes out of it.
B00632HWOG|1.0|The first version I had of this wasn't great but at least it loaded.  The newest update won't even load my messages on my Kindle Fire so it's pretty much useless to me.
B007L4T234|5.0|wow what a great set of books. it was romantic and erotic. makes you want more. recomend this book to all!
B004PGO25O|4.0|Written in a breezy and unique style, this book will get you off the couch.  The premise is, whatever your plans for your career, your future, you've got work to do to make it happen.  There is insight into the many ways we human beings try to stall and abrogate our responsibilities, and especially the work involved in reaching any goal.  Pressfield's book helps you to recognize these situations and take steps to get past them.<br />There are achievers who seem to intuitively know these things, I'm not one of them.
0553384775|5.0|I read the first 100 pages of it, but its a Christmas Gift for my Boyfriend and I know he won't be able to take his head out of this book!

B0042X9L6A|5.0|When I first started shooting a DSLR I learned to hate flash real fast.  I bought the cheap (and now discontinued) [[ASIN:B000KKPN5C Nikon SB-400 AF Speedlight Flash for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras]] and it helped to be able to bounce off the ceiling and the wall (only in portrait mode), but the sb-400 is really nothing more than an slightly advanced on camera flash.  When I upgraded my camera I got rid of that flash since I hated its limitations so much (not much control, not always bounceable, and not capable of real off camera work.  I upgraded cameras and I wanted to get to work on some more creative things, especially with off camera flash.<br /><br />The SB-700 has done everything I need it to as a beginner so far.  I haven't needed anything other than commander mode to trigger it (which I'm happy about not spending more money on triggers), though I don't think I've really challenged it yet. I bought one of the budget umbrella kits [[ASIN:B008S1TQBC CowboyStudio Photography Photo Studio Flash Mount Three Umbrellas Kit with Light Stand]] and that has been working nicely to let me do some nice single flash work around the house.<br /><br />I've been rather surprised by the life of the batteries so far.  The recycle time gets a little longer as they tire, but it's just enough time to think about setting up my shot and making a few quick adjustments. Maybe at some point I'll find the limitations of this flash and understand why you would go up to an [[ASIN:B0050YG3CU Nikon 4809 SB-910 Speedlight Supplied with; AS-21 Speedlight Stand; SW-13H Nikon Diffusion Dome; SZ-2FL Fluorescent Filter; SZ-2TN Incandescent Filter; SS-910 Soft Case]], but this is more than enough for me now. The build quality seems good and the whole thing is solid.

B000001FY9|5.0|This CD of all of Bob Marley's greatest hits is great! Highly recommend if you love reggae music and Bob Marley!
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|not worth seeing in theater though entertaining.<br />some good laughs in there.<br />maybe wahlberg not best choice - younger actor better?
B00114RKT8|5.0|One of the most impressive movies I've seen! Have watched it many times and riveted by William Wilberforce's character played by Ioan Gruffudd. It stirs my faith and passion to make a better World and never give up!
B002ZG981E|5.0|Inception has that classic 80s - 90s type of feel. It makes you just want to keep watching. The audio and video quality of the movie is 10/10. It's truly a master piece. Don't ask about the story and just buy it, you won't regret it.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Connelly is back in good form after wasting time on lawyer books. This one is vintage Bosch.<br />A good read and a good mystery.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I've played this game for years (manually and on the computer) and never became bored playing...it's really a &#34;good&#34; stress reliever...
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I enjoyed the book but had some questions for the parents and why they let these young people spend so much time together. What was wrong with making other friends. I do not understand why that girl felt killing herself was the only way to deal with her situation. She didn't talk. I found this book interesting for the lack of parenting. It was very sad for both young people and both families. It definitely is a book for this time in our country.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|My new &#34;favorite&#34; purchase of the year...I ABSOLUTELY &#34;LUV&#34; it...and the compliments I receive - lets me know I made the best choice out of all the other covers I looked at...
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|But, I'm sure that is what it is suppose to be..........juvenile.  It was a waste of $$$ even for the juvenile.
B007HACDLK|5.0|The excellent saga of Mitch Rapp continues with &#34;The Last Man&#34; and with Vince Flynn directing the stories, This again was well worth the time.
B00AA7O22U|2.0|Worse than the first...and that isn't saying a lot.  The first one I considered mildly entertaining...this one...not so much...again, not.
B008SOS63S|4.0|The man sure can play that thing! I'm not too much a fan of live recordings, but this one's well recorded. Not 'muddy' or poorly produced at all. I especially liked the Beth Hart and John Hyatt cuts. I'm looking forward to getting more of his music. Also, I saw part of the DVD of this concert on PBS for their fund drive and, if you get the chance, have a look at that too. He's a lot of fun to watch. Only downside is the Paul Rodgers cuts - not because they're especially bad, but because I'm not a big fan of Rodgers' music.
B003Y5H5C4|5.0|I got a fabulous deal on this book for Black Friday and I was very excited since I really enjoyed this movie the first time I saw it! I was happy to add this to my collection. It was delivered in great time too!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie is hilarious!  Although there are a few crude moments, which isn't my style, it is peppered with great one liners!
B002BWP49C|5.0|I have been a Twilight fan since before the books were even popular. I've seen all of the movies in theater and this one was my favorite, (well until I saw Part 2). Very well followed with the book and leaves you hungry for the next part of the movie! I would definitely recommend this movie to complete your collection of the Twilight series! I would recommend you read the books too, because they are even more awesome!
B00A4GXJD0|5.0|Grand album  If like Born Free, you'll love Rebel Soul<br />Been a fan since he started being a real rocker.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Rented it for Streaming on my Roku.  Started out a little akward as I had my 10 and 5 year old watching. After the first 5 minutes though all was well.  One &#34;bad&#34; word here or there, but nothing to worry about.<br /><br />Great movie, good ending. Should have bought it, so I could watch again!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is a very interesting series. Lots of stories going on, and everyone trying to stay alive one more day.

B0076DELIG|5.0|Connelly continues to evolve Harry and his relationship with his daughter. Good story line, but with the same Bosch attitude that I love.
B00973DDN2|5.0|Love me some Killers! Not just because they're from Vegas either. I highly recommend this album from this band. Love it!
B0076DELIG|5.0|But I love all Connelly's books!  Harry is one of the best fictional characters out there!  Sorry my favorite authors can write fast enough to keep up with my reading.

B00AHSIQWE|1.0|I WAS READY FOR IT TO BE OVER LOOOOOONG BEFORE IT WAS!<br />NEEDED MORE TWO FACE, LESS BANE OF MY EXSITANCE!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Obviously one of the most classic trilogies of all time...of course I'm talking about Episodes IV thru VI. I thru III didn't really float my boat, but hey, I still enjoy watching it.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Overall...the movie was great. It had some slow parts to it, but what great movie doesn't? Christopher Nolan completes his trilogy in style and features a somewhat sad ending, but necessary as the movie points out. I like how there is a new door open at the end for someone to continue.
B004JMSIRC|5.0|This movie in my mind is already a classic and can't wait for the 3rd one to come out next year.
B0085YNML2|5.0|It actually is one you have to think your next move out well in advance of your current. It plays smoothly and good graphics with good sound, make for hours of entertainment.
B000I5XOVY|5.0|Good movie here, can't go wrong with Swordfish on Blu-Ray. I have it on DVD but wanted to upgrade to a better video/audio quality.
B002XXLKHY|4.0|Love to watch this Christmas movie to get in the spirit. Just watched it last weekend. Its sweet without being too silly
B000WQWPKA|5.0|I remember seeing the previews in the theater and on TV for this movie when I was a kid....I couldn't wait until it came out. Love every minute of it.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|The first film is one of my all time favorites. The second one and this one wrap it up with great performances and awesome stories. I don't even care that Bane is hard to understand sometimes.
B004EPYZSU|3.0|Bought this for someone last year for Christmas. I don't think he ever watched it or even know it's his. I didn't think the movie was bad, but Spielberg has been stinkin up the place in Hollywood lately...what happened Steve?
B009K0P10K|4.0|started watching based on my wife's recommendation.  Not the greatest show out there but def pretty solid.  Sometimes feels a little dragged out.  With what is out there on tv now, I would def consider it
B003YHSE7W|5.0|Love this movie. Of course, it's not as good as the first one but when does a sequel out-do the original...almost never.
0688156819|5.0|I love Tim Burton and his movies, so I thought I would buy one of his books, and this book is great!
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Classic already, as I said about the first one. It's a shame Heath Ledger passed on, because in my mind the series will never be the same.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|WHILE THE FIRST HALF OF THE BOOK SETS THE STAGE WITH DISCUSSIONS OF RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY, THE SECOND HALF IS PURE ADVENTURE AND MAGIC.  THIS WAS A LOVELY, WELL WRITTEN BOOK. I THOROUGHLY ENJOYED IT.
B000H7J9QM|5.0|Love this movie when I was growing up. I've watched this many times over. And now I have it on Blu-Ray. The sound and picture are amazing.
B008XG1X18|5.0|so many ideas so little time!  my daugheter is getting marriend next year, we have found so many beautiful decorating and wedding ideas
B002KSPKRS|4.0|I bought these over a year ago and I probably only used them a handful of times. Got tired of replacing the batteries in them constantly. When I do use them they are fantastic.
B001EOKUQU|5.0|classic spy novel that is very well written!  Not like the modern novels with lots of mayhem but more typically the old fashioned spy thriller.
B004ZJZQBK|4.0|I liked this movie, so I decided to get it on Blu-Ray. Never a dull moment when you have Morgan Freeman in a movie.
1451695195|5.0|Thought provoking.  I sent it to a friend after i read it.  Well structured - back and forth in time or at least in what he was feeling and what others were seeing.
B000ICLRHK|5.0|Classic movie starring Keanu Reeves. I remember seeing this as a young buck and just loved it from start to finish.
0307279189|5.0|Fantastic book!  After getting a bad knee (from running) I had basically decided that running wasn't for me. Then I stumbled upon this book and tried out barefoot running. In the beginning I had some issues with sore calf muscles (but no knee pains), but after reading up on techniques I have adjusted my running and am now doing great. For the first time running is fun.<br /><br />Also, the book is well narrated and keeps your interested throughout.
B00319ECGK|5.0|This movie is an example of how 2 brothers can come up with something so imaginative and creative and make it into one of the best movies I've ever seen.
B0068FYZ84|5.0|This was such an unexpected delight when I saw it in the theater for the first time. I fell completely in love with Babe and Fly and Maa and Ferdinand-the-duck-that-wanted-to-be-a-rooster. James Cromwell was perfect as farmer Hogget.  I didn't eat pork (even bacon) for years after seeing the film.  A really great combination of real-life action and animation...and the editing process must have been Herculean in scope.  A brilliant film, I picked this as my favorite for best picture of 1995 over the gruesome and violent Mel Gibson opus which won that year. This was a much more memorable effort which I have enjoyed many times since, and one which I think will endure longer than any of the other films from that year...oh yeah, loved the mouse chorus as well!<br />Baa-ram-ewe...\\"Christmas means carnage\\"!  and \\"Beware the bad cat bearing a grudge\\".......
B004EPZ06G|2.0|This movie wasn't for me. It was a Christmas gift I bought someone for last year. It doesn't live up to original, then again, whta sequel does?
B0060D123K|5.0|We LOVE this movie! It is one of the ones we watch every year during the week before Christmas.  Excellent for the whole family.
B001AW156U|4.0|These triggers actually came to be of some use. I use to play Xbox 360 for the longest time before I eventually got a PS3, but I couldn't get use to the triggers on the PS3 controllers. So i decided to get these and they work great. No problems here.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I just didn't want to put this book down it's so addicting and real. It's kind of like the 50 SHADES OF GREY SERIES but more realistic.
6304936362|4.0|Another one of those classics that I enjoyed watching as a kid. Couldn't wait to grab it on DVD, and at a good price at that.
B00846REIS|5.0|I read this book a few weeks after reading 50 shades of grey and I was instantly addicted.It's real to the point doesn't beat around the bush my kind of book I liked it a lot more than 50 shades of grey.Totally recommend it to whoever like 50 shades or didn't like 50 shades they'll see it's much better!!!!!
B000PC6A3E|5.0|Can't say enough about this movie. Obviously, a classic already with the acting and storyline. Who doesn't like this movie??
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|This was a fast paced and riveting book. Written so you could envision all the characters and what they looked like. Wraps you  up and puts you in the plot.
B000NQRE0K|5.0|Talk about a classic. I can't believe it's been years since this came out. What a well written, well acted and well directed movie. Can't watch it enough.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flow Free It is a fun game and very addicting once you get started it very hard yo put down.  Really like it.
B000G0O5N2|5.0|Great action flick for the average person. Based on true events as well. I thought the acting was good but couldn't get over why there were so many English Actors in this movie....I mean, enough.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|Great visuals, great action, great story. Really an exciting movie to watch. I love the way the director films this flick and how the actors act in it. You can tell they had a fun time making it.
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|I really liked this movie when it came out. The director really did a nice job with this flick. One of those movies you can watch anytime.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It really keeps you on the edge of your seat!<br />I love this book, can't wait to read the 2nd one.
B004SIPA4G|5.0|When this movie came out in theaters I was unaware of it. However, one hot summer day, I was off from work and school so I decided to see it in my local theater and this is one of those movies that you feel that you struck gold on. I know that may sound ridiculous, but I love watching this movie over and over again.
B000N2HBSO|4.0|...of Lincoln's character and that of those around him....gave me a much better idea of how the government ran during the Civil War.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|Never heard of this movie coming out in theaters for some reason. But I heard a review from one of my friends so I decided to pick it up on Blu-Ray, and I love it. Great movie to own. Ryan Gosling does a great job with the character he portrays.
0345505387|1.0|Diana Gabaldon is one of my favourite authors. She won me over quite easily from the beginning of the Outlander series. However, I don't believe for an instant that it was ever intended to be a graphic novel.  The renditions of Clair and Jamie were just *wrong*.  Therein lies the greatest drawback to graphic novels and films, in that the individual's imagination is spoiled when presented with such imagery.  Somehow the looks, the sound, etc. never quite measures up. That is definitely true of this particular book.  Stick with the novels, and give the graphic interpretation a pass.
B00AE2IJIE|3.0|Excellent artistically and visually appealing/distinctive, fun premise with some wonderful voice actors but somehow not doing it for me. Definitely worth renting but I doubt I'd buy it (and my 9 and 10 year old agreed). I can't put my finger on what was &#34;off&#34; exactly but it just didn't have that &#34;it&#34; factor...and on a side note, I didn't think the homosexual comment was inappropriate and in anyway offensive and frankly, I'm surprised people are so prudish that they feel uncomfortable discussing such topics with their children (only to the degree befitting their age and comprehension, mind you).
B005DOJ68K|5.0|Just a terrific group of songs from many years ago. Great music to listen o when going through your daily workouts.
0786891416|5.0|I am a big Castle fan.  Couldn't put the book down.  I enheld the book and gave them to a friend for Christmas.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|It is a fascinating biography of a great president.  Very readable.  I actually cried at the end when Lincoln was died.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love this app because you can highlight scripture.  Post scripture to facebook, and It will give you the defenition of a word if you hold your finger over a word.  My only complaint is that I can't figure out how to download an offline version so I have to have a wi-fi connection to use it.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|Its one of those movies that friends swear by, but I've never seen so this movie was just what I needed.  Great shipping time and a funny movie.
078689136X|5.0|If you love Castle, don't deprive yourself of these books.  Read the first three in just a few weeks.  That is unusal for me as I am a slow reader.  Great Christmas present.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Long story short...<br /><br />A friend of mine insisted I watch just ONE episode...I resisted and finally gave in...WOW, I got so hooked on storyline, plot, characters and yes...the zombies that I rushed out and watched all three seasons in less than two weeks!!!<br /><br />Get it, you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Now I cannot wait for the new episodes... I am hooked!
B007GCY8FS|2.0|Well I stopped and started this book at least three times.  When I finally got towards the middle it picked up a bit, then at the end it veered towards complete unbelievability. Save your time and money. I am beginning to get very frustrated with successful authors of series that seem to make little effort in putting together a quality piece of work knowing they have a loyal following and will still be able to sell books even if it isn't good.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I just love this app. Its the one I have been waiting for. It is worth having on your device..
B009OYTAL8|4.0|No thinking involved.  Great for when you don't want to figure things out.  The main character''s origins are explained. so
B00447G29S|5.0|Although the quality of the picture may depend upon your 3D TV, this movie absolutely is stunning on my 3D LG 52&#34; TV. I am very pleased with the viewing quality...and I'm using standard no-frills 3D glasses. It reminds me very much of the 3D version I saw at the theater.
B0043EV774|3.0|We have tried watching this movie over and over. It will just stop and turn green and you have to stop the movie and just wait till another day to see if it will decide to want to play. We use  Blue-ray player and the reguler dvd player.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Nice and simple to play, so you don't have to invest a bunch (any!) time learning to play to enjoy it.<br />Yet it does gradually get more challenging and introduce new things, so it stays interesting.
B0076DELIG|5.0|As Always Michael Connelly did an Awesome job depicting Harry Bosch as a fascinating Detective.  Having expreience in the criminal justice field I can tell you Connelly's storys are very real.  This is yet another in Connelly's books that you just cannot put down!!!  I Love Connelly's endings as compared to other similar authors-he never lets you down.  The only negative thing I can say is he needs to publish his books faster as I have read them all!!  Great Job and a Great Author!
0307592731|5.0|Read this book. It is wonderful!<br />I cried a lot through the first 30 pages or so, then held my breath through a lot of the rest. Passed it along to my daughter to read when I was finished, and she had similar reactions. This is a well told story that is fun and inspirational to read.
B003L0HZ5O|5.0|This is my 2nd black keys download and the music is every bit as edgy as el camino. Looking for more!

B009JZWO3I|5.0|Juliana Margolies is unsurpassed. And the plots deal with relevant, current issues and one really never knows what's coming next.
B003QS9WIE|5.0|A Surprising, intriguing story that will keep you thinking throughout the movie. Watch out at the end- you won't expect the twist.
B005ZUR724|2.0|This game is fun...until Gameloft tries to run an update. Then the game goes down for four days and you have no idea what is going on. The have numerous methods to communicate with users but they don't use them beyond a basic message saying the servers are down.  I'm off try try faction wars..Iheard their support is amazing.
B001GXF2YY|5.0|Harry Bosch for President! What a great character! And I disagree with Michael Connelly about who best to play Harry in the upcoming sure-to-be-blockbuster movie.  I say Dean Norris, from Breaking Bad, would be PERFECT. Anyway, this book – indeed, any of the books about Harry Bosch or Mickey Haller, are outstanding reads. You will NEVER go wrong.
B005LAIISA|5.0|I bought it without having seen it first. I own the first 3 movies and love all of them too. Just finished watching this and except for a small period of ho-hum I laughed silly. I have some difficulty taking pills lately and I was taking my pills while watching this movie and all but choked on them for the laughter!

I grew up there and am an amateur historian about the area and am thrilled that he includes the locale in his books.
0425263908|5.0|I have to agree with the previous comment that this book is better than Fifty shades of grey. I absolutely loved this  book. I'm about to start the second book and can't wait for the 3rd one to release in May. If you are a fan of fifty shades and just want the male in the book to give a little, this book is for you.

B00AE2KZNQ|5.0|What a great story...with great acting!! This movie couldn't really go wrong.<br />I loved it....my brother went to see it twice in the theater!
B002VHI8FE|5.0|One of the best new series I have read. I would strongly recommend this book, especially if you are escaping from sub-par cliche driven crappy @ss RA. Salvatore garbage.
B009GX69RK|3.0|I love watching Zoey....but this show kinda sucks!!<br />maybe I'm just not a sitcom kinda girl...I wanted to love it.
B0011TNVLY|5.0|....a staple of our Christmas entertainment !! The theme and the overall production of this marvelous story are so heart warming. The Polar Express is always a companion of The Christmas Story !!
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Funny and quick witted just as i expected coming from Seth. A got to see if you are a family guy fan.
B004WY2M8I|5.0|I had avoided reading this book for years, but found the interest to do so still existed.  When I began, Ms. Rice had captured me.  The writing is lovely--it was so well done that I could see through my mind's eye the story unfold.<br /><br />It is a must read!
140120841X|5.0|Since there are plenty of reviews of the novel, I will review the actual physical book.<br /><br />The binding is good. I've had this for a few months and I'm not worried about the pages coming out any time soon. The quality of the printing is also very good. No misprints or anything. The pages are a smidge thicker than average books, so it helps with the durability. Obviously since it's a paperback, be careful as the covers could bend very easily. Overall though I would say the print quality of the book is top notch.
0525952926|5.0|What a wonderful review of history.  I learned much that I had forgotten or never knew in the first place.  And believe me, I searched the web for veracity.  Follett is a marvelous writer.. I could say that he is my favorite author, but there are many others who weave wonderful fact-based fiction.  Large book, but read slowly because you won't want it to end.  Can't wait for the next in the series.
B009K45Y62|5.0|Since there are plenty of reviews of the movie itself, I'll review the actual product I received. I ordered the limited edition blu-ray that came with the broken bat cowl. The cowl itself was smaller than I was expecting (I was expecting it to be close to life-size). However the quality is still good and it looks great on my shelf next to my entire movie collection. The blu-ray, dvd, and special features disc are all contained in a circular case (rather than a traditional blu-ray case) which tucks into the back of the base of the bat cowl. It's a rather neat design that keeps the pieces together nicely. As a big fan of the trilogy, I can say I am very happy with this purchase to complete the set.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This book is so beautifully put together with excellent prose and a tremendous and haunting story.  Again, Kate Morton alternates between past, in this case World War II England, and the present until they both meet and the story comes to its conclusion.  Her characters are well drawn, writing flows, and the plot is terrific.  She is writing classics in our time.
0789325772|5.0|I have the books by M. Sasek for a long time. I have been pleased to see the revival of them. And...now a calendar called This is London using the illustrations of M.Sasek. I am looking forward to being amused by 12 different illustrations in 2013. I am looking forward to being reminded of some of my very favorite places.
B0096CDG0O|5.0|no problems, fun like yahtzee or farkle, the free app is good too, you just have to sit through ads.
B00A8Z6KN8|3.0|I think this soundtrack is good but it doesn't have as much emotion as the soundtracks for the Lord of the Rings movies. I do find the Misty Mountains song catchy though.
B007SGM084|3.0|to repetative very predictable and you get the idea after the first several chapeters.  I will not finish the books
B000UX6OHK|5.0|Watch this incredible was what I expected, I loved the model and very good seller, besides price was still good, so keep doing orders and have recommended it clear that
B00846REIS|5.0|Overall I absolutely loved this book!<br />I was a huge fan of 50 Shades and looking for something else to read. This hit the spot but it was better!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I have loved this series since i found out about the graphic novel back when it first came out! The show is really detialed and i love every minute of the time i spend on the edge of my seat biting my nails! I am a huge fan and wouldnt dream of missing out on the chance to own the DVDs
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Superb storyline. Not bogged down with as much military item detail descriptions as his older books.  Yet, this book has a much better suspence storyline which keeps one on their seat edge.  The storyline seems to flow much better than some of his older books because of the lack of story bogging detail descriptions.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This was my introduction to angry birds and I fell in love with it immediately.  I can't pick a favorite bird, because I love them all. Hard to stop playing once I got started.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|love it!  can't wait for season 3 to start!  i bought season 1 and 2 and just cant wait for season 3
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|All angry bird games are totally addicting.  I have a hard time stopping play once I start.  It's a great game.  Lots of fun!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I am a big fan of Colleens' Slammed series and this book was just wow...amazing.  I couldn't put it down.  It kept me guessing and the story is just so emotional and touching.  This is that book...the one I would recommend to all my friends and will most likely find myself reading again because I just need to \\"feel\\" it again.  Thanks Colleen,  well done!!!  Keep them coming!
B00447L4JG|5.0|Movie arrived in Excellent Condition! No Damage to exterior or rips in plastic.  Truly a great movie & great christmas present!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Just finished reading it, and it is hard to find words to describe how I'm feeling, wow, just wow.  I absolutely loved it. One of the best books I've read all year, and believe me I read a lot of books. Hopeless is beautiful, intense and even funny at times. Most of all I'm grateful to have been able to walk with Sky during her heartbreaking and beautiful journey, and I'm left feeling blessed for all I have in my life.
B008NEMN0K|4.0|I have always enjoyed the movie, so the question was, would JVCs new 3D conversion work well.  The answer is it seems to work as well as any other conversion techiniqueThe 3D added an emersion, even if not as deep as a film shot in 3D like Avatar or Hugo.  The visuals were stunning, although as times a bit flawed, such as in the soon to be destroyed house, the banasters looked digitally drawn.<br /><br />The sound on this blu-ray was a significant improvement over the old DVD.
B000000P17|4.0|Over all, this album contains some good covers. the origonal artists i never heard before.there is two songs on here i dont really like. to me, belive it or not,this is more interesting than appitite for destroction. GNR`s first album is definitly overrated. The spagetii incedint is good. but not perfect nor horrable. let me descibe the songs:<br /><br />SINCE I DONT HAVE YOU 3/5<br />this song, its ok, i just cant belive that GNR would choose a 1950s song to cover<br /><br />NEW ROSE 3/5<br />Great intro. not crazy about the theme though. but it seems like punk rock song that they would cover<br /><br />DOWN ON THE FARM 4.5/5<br />I LOVE the vocals and the guitar. this song is one for my favorite songs on the album. this song describes how i feel at times.<br /><br />HUMAN BEING 1/5<br />I hate this song. its like the same thing over and over again. im just not into this one. this is my least favorite song on the album<br /><br />RAW POWER 2/5<br />this song is kind of boring to me. there is some pretty good parts in it. im just not into the whole song.<br /><br />AINT IT FUN 5/5<br />Oh heck yeah! this is my most favorite song on the album. i love the guitars and chorus part. this song makes alot of since exept for the part at 2:19.<br /><br />BUICK MACKANE 3/5<br />The song is good,but does not make any sense. but i think its two songs put togather.what makes the song interesting.<br /><br />HAIR OF THE DOG 4.5/5<br />Awasome song. love the talkbox part. and i love the ending when they are speeding up. when i listen to the album i have to lisen to this song first.<br /><br />ATTITUDE 4/5<br />Good song but its just to short. why dont thay make all songs at least over 2 mins?<br /><br />BLACK LEATHER 4/5<br />Cool song. i wear black leather. this song has more of a \\"dark\\" theme to me.<br /><br />YOU CANT PUT YOUR ARMS AROUND A MEMORY 3.5/5<br />Its ok, has what sounds like a acoustic guitar in it. i like this song when i think of my old friend i dont see anymore<br /><br />I DONT CARE ABOUT YOU 4/5<br />I listen to this song when im angery at someone. its funny of what they say at the end or the song.LOL<br /><br />(HIDDEN TRACK) LOOK AT YOUR GAME,GIRL 4/5<br />I like the song. to me it sounds like a balled. with percussion and Vocals and acoustic guitar ends the album.<br />EVERYBODY SERIESLY, THIS ALBUM IS UNDERRATED. ITS BETTER THAN YOU THINK. WHEN I FIRST GOT IT, I DIDNT LIKE IT EITHER, BUT I GAVE IT A COUPLE MORE CHANCES AND I STARTED TO LIKE IT.
0307950689|3.0|This book was OK.  Not as good as Da Vinci Code or Angles And Demons; it falls short of each of those in so many ways.  Funny thing is, that in each of these Robert Langdon stories, everyone always running?  Doesn't anyone ever stop to have a cup of coffee or maybe a beer?  Seriously, in each of these books Brown seems to (at least to me) keep using the same formula and plot ideas (chasing/running/no time) to the point I find it predictable and no longer fun to read.  I will be cautious reading Robert Langdon #4 you can be sure.  I wanted to really like this book but found it hard to get to the end.  I would say of Brown's five novels, this is the weakest of all.
B007T99ENE|4.0|I am still reading Sweet Tooth however I am enjoying it very much because it holds my interest & I keep looking forward for the next turn. I like novels that take you into peoples lives & you become swept up with what is going on with them. Irene Hall
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Well first of all I love zombies!..this show is a total trip. The twists and turns and shockers in this season were awesome! DVD came brand new, I was very happy.
1612130283|5.0|I actually really like it. Yes, it had a lot of repetitive phrases or words but I just didn't mind. I have read a lot of books, and I liked the plot of this one. It's a fantasy that every woman has but they don't really speak of it. Criticize this book for emotional abuse, neglect and others, that is why it's called fiction. It's just a novel, it awakens a sexual side of you and I actually like.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|This is a classic, a favorite among my family and peers and a story that never gets old.  In a time when being proper was taught, and social standing was what you were born into somehow true love sometimes prevails.  Jane Austen, although never married, can write with the soul of a true romantic. She uses wit and twists on what was considered &#34;normal&#34; in her time period and made a masterpiece that lives on through the ages.<br />  This is a love story about a girl named Elizabeth Bennet, who lives in a less than grand social stature with her sisters, her father, and her outspoken mother.  She is witty, lovable and in a word headstrong. Although she does not realize it, the love of her life, Mr. Darcy is fighting with his own sense of propriety and moral guidelines to put a halt to the love he feels for this young woman.<br />  Engaging, with characters you love and in some cases cannot help but love to hate bring together a truly remarkable novel that will be  hard to put down,
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Every time I take long drives this is in car.  It is easy listening yet still very dynamic.  This soulful blend of folk and bluse is chilling is such and organic way. No matter your taste you will love this album.
B00425S1H8|3.0|I use a MacBook Pro and when I plug this in, it works great. It is easy to use, just plug it in. The problem comes when I am done using it. If I unplug it while the computer is running, it will crash the operating system. I have to shut down my computer in order for the unit to be unplugged. Probably just an issue with a driver. If this was something that I had to use everyday it would be a problem, but for me it is ok for the price.
B0073RSVMC|5.0|This is a sturdy model dinosaur. I bought it for a three year old which is innapropriate since it will surely chip but he loves it and takes good care of it. Meant more for an older age group or collector, this model is extremely well detailed and solidly built. It is heavy and beautiful, for a dino.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|I heard all the hype from friends.  Read all the internet things.  I finally saw this and can now agree with the assessment.  This movie ROCKS!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I borrowed book 1 from a friend and eat it up in a couple days. I couldn't go to sleep without getting the entire trilogy. I truly enjoyed these books each one was better than the one before it.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I loved this movie. It was the right combination of cheesy and comedy. Such a fun movie. I watched three times since I rented it on amazon!
1433293498|4.0|Originally posted at FanLit.<br />The Martian Chronicles is a collection of Ray Bradbury's stories about the human colonization of Mars which were previously published in the pulp magazines of the late 1940s. The stories are arranged in chronological order with the dates of the events at the beginning of each story. In the first edition of The Martian Chronicles, published in 1950, the events took place in a future 1999-2027, but a reprinted 1997 edition pushes all events forward to 2030-2057. Because it's a story collection, The Martian Chronicles has an episodic feel which has been made more fluid by connecting the stories with short vignettes, similar to the structure of Bradbury's collection The Illustrated Man.<br /><br />In the first story, \\"Rocket Summer,\\" we visit a small town in Ohio while the first human exploratory spaceship takes off for Mars. Bradbury explains in the introduction to The Martian Chronicles that this small-town mid-America feel was influenced by Sherwood Anderson's novel Winesburg, Ohio: A Group of Tales of Ohio Small-Town Life which Bradbury admired and hoped to emulate.<br /><br />The next two stories, \\"Ylla\\" and \\"The Summer Night,\\" show us what the Martians are like. They're humanoid in form with brown skin and round yellow eyes. Like humans, they live in houses and towns, eat and drink, sleep, age, read books, study science, desire love, become jealous and irritable, and commit murder. (I find it amusing that the Martians have the same kinds of depressing marriages we see in Bradbury's stories set on Earth.) But the Martians are telepathic and the humans' approach is causing them to quote our poetry, sing our songs, and adopt other aspects of human culture without understanding why.<br /><br />The first spaceship was unsuccessful, so a second expedition was launched a few months later (it seems reasonable for Bradbury to expect that by 1999 we'd be able to get to Mars a lot faster than we actually can). In \\"The Earth Men\\" we learn the fate of this crew and we learn that Martians, just like Americans in 1950, have to live with bad psychiatry and insane asylums. Stephen Hoye, the narrator of Blackstone Audio's 2009 version of The Martian Chronicles, was particularly brilliant with this story.<br /><br />Next comes \\"The Taxpayer\\" in which an Ohio man is trying to get on the third expedition to Mars (the second one failed). This very short vignette tells us that things are going badly on Earth and that an atomic war is expected in about two years. \\"The Third Expedition\\" (originally published in Planet Stories as \\"Mars is Heaven!\\") describes what happens when the third doomed mission lands on Mars. This story doesn't quite work with the chronology of The Martial Chronicles because it portrays astronauts from 2030 growing up in the small Midwestern towns of early 20th century America. It also ironically highlights the biggest problem with The Martian Chronicles when one of the astronauts asks \\"Do you think that the civilizations of two planets can progress at the same rate and evolve in the same way?\\" Clearly the astronaut doesn't think that's possible, but in these early stories, Bradbury's Martian culture is just too much like ours. Even so, \\"The Third Expedition\\" is a clever little horror story and one of my favorites in the collection.<br /><br />\\"And the Moon Be Still as Bright\\" is the story of the fourth, finally successful, expedition to Mars. The Martians have mostly died of chickenpox -- humans, in our blundering way, have inadvertently killed them off. Most of the men of the expedition don't care, eager to begin exploration and colonization, but Captain Wilder and an archaeologist named Spender regret that humans have destroyed such a beautiful civilization, like they destroy everything else they touch. There's a lot of social commentary about 1940s American culture in this story.<br /><br />The next several stories are about the rapid spread of humanity on Mars. \\"The Settlers\\" and \\"The Shore\\" describe the type of people who came to Mars from Earth, \\"The Green Morning\\" follows a Johnny Appleseed type of character who plants trees to increase oxygen levels, and \\"The Locusts\\" and \\"Interim\\" describes how men and women made Mars look just like another Earth. In \\"Night Meeting,\\" we learn that \\"even time is crazy up here\\" when a colonist from Earth meets a Martian who seems to be in a different time-stream. This story also reminds us that civilizations both rise and fall and that perhaps it's best that we don't know the future of our own civilization.<br /><br />I especially liked the next story, \\"The Fire Balloons,\\" in which a group of missionaries prepare to bring the Gospel to the Martians. They don't know what the Martians will look like and must consider how a different culture, and even a different anatomy, might dictate the types of sin a society is prone to. (It seems unlikely that the missionaries don't know what the Martians look like by now, but we must keep in mind that The Martian Chronicles is a story collection, not a novel with a continuous story.) When the missionaries meet the Martians, they have even more theological questions to deal with. \\"The Fire Balloons,\\" has a beautiful ending.<br /><br />Male explorers and settlers have been the main characters so far but \\"The Musicians,\\" a story original to The Martian Chronicles, shows us what boys do for fun on Mars, \\"The Wilderness\\" features two women who are getting ready to emigrate from Earth, and \\"The Old Ones\\" focuses briefly on the elderly. Those first courageous men won't be forgotten, though; in \\"The Naming of Names\\" we learn that they've been immortalized -- many places on Mars have been named after them. These human names, and other industrial-sounding names, have replaced the nature-focused names used by the Martians.<br /><br />In \\"Usher II\\" Bradbury returns to one of his favorite pet peeves -- book burning. A man who has left Earth to get away from the \\"moral climate\\" police is angry that they've now shown up on Mars. To get back at them for outlawing Edgar Allen Poe's work, he uses his fortune to build his own House of Usher and he invites them all to a party. This story is entertaining, but I'm not sure that Bradbury makes his case.

1455502758|5.0|I think this was Hitch's last book. If you're a fan of his you'll like this one. He was one of a kind.
0143120581|4.0|First off let me just say Amy makes a good point about western parenting and it's not to say it's the wrong way there seems to be some weak points when these parents try to help their kids, they tend to fall to pieces and have emotional breakdowns, some prefer to not finish making progress with their children, when it comes to schoolwork or hobbies or after school programs.
0847835073|5.0|Very much enjoyed looking at various photographer's take on Monica. High quality book, well printed. Not much text to worry with, Monica says it all.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game would be a good mind. game also I like the game because of it addictive. -I would like to makeweight a game just like this one
B00AA7O22U|4.0|This is one of those movies you pop a beer to and have fun with. Its so over the top I was laughing thru a lot of the film. Good times! If you really want to anger your wife or girlfriend watch this movie in front of her!
159420411X|5.0|I'm no fan of math or  college statistics but this book was a good read with valuable information. Nate Silver looks through the raw stats to divine their real significance. He takes into consideration the totality of the information available before making his predictions. Pretty good stuff, well worth reading.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I've blasted through the first three levels (5X5, 6X6, 7X7) with little difficulty. Now Im ha ving to think a bit on the larger puzzles
B009WO7NQO|3.0|I didn't like the hidden costs that were not stated at time of purchase. I am not one for playing these types of games so I guess I have no experience when it comes playing video games. I purchased this for a friends little boy for 2.99 to play while he was here and when I recieved the confirmation of my order there was a charge of 2.99 and a second charge for 9.99 for &#34;Mighty Falcon Large Bundle&#34; product.  When I contacted  Amazon I was told there must have been a new level activated or a new charactor introduced.  The Amazon customer service rep was kind enough to remove the charge this one time but if it happened in the future I would know the reason for reason and it would not be able to be removed.<br /><br />My review reflects the product requirements and in no way reflects the service I have received from Amazon.  Amazon has always been great and very easy to work for a resolution of any purchase I have made.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Great book, featuring Harry Bosch.  Michael Connelly is an excellent writer, and I always feel like I am returning to visit old friends with his well-crafted characters.
6305268843|5.0|This film is a classic.  One of the best classical films I have seen.  I highy recommend it It is a women's film.
055358202X|5.0|Absolutely LOVE all of these books. I recommend this whole series to everyone I know and they've all enjoyed them as much as I have.
B002XTBEDI|4.0|The second Cranford film was not as interesting as the first-. excellent actors.  If another Cranford film is made, a better script is needed to insure success.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|I have two other Bibles on my iPhone.(Logos and Olive Tree) I thought this Kindle version might be easier to use since I had used Kindle quite a bit.  It's still early, but it seems to be working out.
0446691437|5.0|My first experience with this book was in a graduate creative writing class. We read it to stay motivated in our own writing. When I became a professor, I started taking this book to class every day and having students read sections out of it every class. I've been through about 4 editions of the book and given several as gifts. The premise of the book is to learn to understand and over come \\"Resistance,\\" which is the destructive voice of procrastination that resides within us all. The book is set up in short sections, ranging from a paragraph to a page or two. It's like a daily devotional to keep one motivated. While it is geared towards writers, you can easily substitute your own calling for \\"writer.\\" I sub in \\"student\\" all the time. Pressfield's voice is clever and compelling. You will run across a four-letter word every so often, so don't be suprised!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I wanted a book that I could get into and enjoy reading.  Pi did it for me.  Right after finishing the book I saw the movie and neither were disappointing.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I don't want to give anything away for anyone who hasn't read it. But, this is one of the best book series I have ever read in my life.
B007SGM084|5.0|This was a great trilogy with an awesome story line. I would recommend this series to anyone who is married or anyone looking to try new things in their relationship.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Like my title says it's hard to get started but if you can get about halfway through the book you won't regret it. The imagry is fantastic and I would recommend this to anyone out there. (read it before you see the movie)
B003EYVXUU|4.0|Very dark and awesome. I haven't seen the original movie. I just finished getting the first one. But so far as the remake its overy great movie to watch. I loved it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I don't want to give anything away for anyone who hasn't read it. But, this is one of the best book series I have ever read in my life.
B000RPCK1U|4.0|I just love all the awesome cars that are in the movie. Who doesn't love Bavarian Motor Works? Who doesn't?
B008OOYALE|4.0|This is a great addicting game. I enjoy it a lot. However TeamLava appears to discriminate against its kindle users. Kindle users are the last to receive updates (if we get them at all) which makes the game less fun than it could be. Also, many of the larger islands have trouble loading, and sometimes when one is trying to move an object the screen will randomly turn blue and the one is not able to find their islands without completely closing the app, or visiting a friend and then returning to their island. In addition, the game will compel one to spend real money to buy gold, which is one of two forms of currency. Gold can be exchanged for food, coins, used to buy a dragon, or to speed things up (quite useful stuff) and the day will come when one will finally give in. In short this game is wonderful and worthwhile to play, minus the problems mentioned above.
B008CLI3TE|5.0|Alrighty. I bought the set only because I was so tired of my coworkers talking about this show. Have you've seen it, have you've seen it? No I haven't. Finally I bought the Complete first season. I watched the entire box set in one day. I could not stop. The story is so addicting. Now Im checking everyday on Amazon to see when the second season will be available. I love this series.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple run is a very exciting and interesting game to play. I will admit it does get boring after you buy everything in the store and complete all the objectives. but then you should try temple run brave. definitely a great game to play!!!
6304795254|4.0|The movie did take me for a loop. At first I really didn't know what the hell was going on. But little by little I kept shoving my seat closer to TV. Its a very great movie.
B009329ZF2|4.0|I thought the movie was great,and yes you could see some parts coming, but overall it was super-duper. The special effects was way beyond what i expected.
B006O6F4O6|3.0|looks pretty cool but has a feel of cheap plastic.<br />It stated origin from USA but actually made in China.<br />Hope they revise it soon<br />not a big bang cor your buck .
B004VMUS9G|4.0|This is an easy-to-use, reliable app that has never failed in the way that the alarm on my phone often does.  The settings are simply and the volume control options are good.  The only thing I don't like is that the &#34;dismiss&#34; button is so small and right under an ad so that sometimes, rather than turning the alarm off, I have to go through the process of having my kindle hijacked by ads.
B004EKCNMA|3.0|I like this version. It is not quite as Mickey or Muppet version, but it is almost there.  Would I recommend this item to others?  Absolutely!
B006WMILQU|2.0|Mansfield Park is probably the best of all of Jane Austen's literature, and that review belongs elsewhere.  This was a true enough depiction of the novel, but the characters were grating in a way that wasn't especially endearing.  The costuming wasn't even that interesting to look at, and the affected asides just made me roll my eyes.  The novel itself takes a crew of totally unbearable people and makes you love them, I had to break this into several short viewings because I couldn't tolerate the characters.
1878424505|5.0|This is a truly accessible book drawing from universal principles of wisdom that surface in most religious and spiritual writings.  It is also a very pragmatic book that can guide you through some hard personal writing, writing that may ultimately heal deep wounds.  After sharing one of the inventories inspired / suggested by the book, my therapist diagnosed me with severe PTSD.  I'm 40 years old and had no idea there was even a diagnosis for the thoughts, the inner voices that condemn me when alone.  My therapist looked at me almost teary eyed and shared this.  'When we're bitten by a dog, our instinct is to pull away.  No, you get it to let go by pushing deeper into its mouth.  We're going to shove your whole hand down that dog's throat girl.'  As brutal as that sounds, it gives me hope.  Surprisingly, that analogy coupled with the book's wisdom has already offered some resolve during times when before the &#34;Harpies&#34; would scream.
B0083GQKQG|4.0|I am an avid reader, and the idea that a film version of a book could be even half as good as the book is shocking.  After reading the book (which was great, and paints a richer view of the internal landscape of the narrator), I watched the movie, expecting disappointment.  How do you portray such a reflective, stream-of-consciousness novel in a movie without overbearing narration?<br /><br />This movie does it, and also helps create the gruesome visuals without turning to cheesy or disturbing horror.  It was excellently cast and acted, and I can't think of a single part that was &#34;off&#34; or could have been improved.  At first, John C. Reilly seemed like a bad choice, but I was convinced after watching.
B0083DJWGO|5.0|I think Nassim Taleb is one of the great thinkers of our time. As an investor I find his brilliant insights invaluable. Now to find some antifragile investments...
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I downloaded this in a fit of nostalgia for the old 8 bit version I played in grade school.  This is kind of addicting, but pretty buggy.  You never know when your game will randomly delete itself and all of your progress is lost.  Sometimes, it will remove all of the mini-games/challenges so that you have no goals to work toward.  Other times it will not let you use rewards.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Excellent writing and compelling story. It really holds your interest. Keeps you thinking and guessing.You want to read more and more.
0307749584|3.0|This book does not capture and hold my interest like previous Jack Reacher novels. I've already forgotten what it was about.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I love NCIS! Great show the characters are awesome. I'm working my way backwards and started to watch NCIS in season 10.
B007PVHANM|5.0|Great documentary of the life of Bob Marley. You don't have to be into Reggae or Marley to enjoy this film.
B00136JQMI|4.0|Mr. Davis is a considerable talent and this album showcases some of his best work. A &#34;must&#34; for any jazz enthusiast.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|hours of fun to be had,  even if you are not a gamer or too much into games at all. This game will have you returning for more.
B000SW4DXK|5.0|A great family movie to share during the holidays.  It truly is a family movie which shows that you can make an entertaining movie without the vulgarity and sexual inuendos that are coming out in &#34;so called&#34; family movies that are now coming out.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoyed the trilogy because I was fascnated by the characters and how their love affair progressed. I am looking forward to the movie!
0316228532|2.0|This book is ok, although I lost interest in it after the 3rd chapter! I am sure the book probably improved as the story continued, but, it just didn't hold my interest!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is only the second review I have ever written and that should tell you how amazing this book truly is. It leaves you speechless breaks your heart and puts it back together again. Colleen Hoover is an amazing author and I can't wait to read anything that she writes!!!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I love it because my granddaughter stays busy, and gives me more time to do my shores and more time for myself.
B001HN697M|5.0|I like the Underworld series of movies. I like Michael Sheen and Bill Nigh. Two great actors, I do say.
B005UA0FLE|4.0|Good music. Bublé gives it a good jazz vibe. Only downside is one of the tracks was a bit tinny.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|I happen to like the actors and Tommy Lee Jones was great as the typical older man. Not meryl Streep's finest performance. Not a riveting movie but cute and kind of funny in spots.
B001Q7JD3Q|5.0|I didn't see the extended version until now and it makes it all that more of a favorite to purchase.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Big fan of Michael Connelly although some of the more recent Harry Bosch efforts have not been up to his typically high standards. Black Box puts him back on top of this genre, really and enjoyable read.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I think the app does exactly what I need it to do. Like it a lot! Would recommend it to anyone who uses an android.
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|My husband and I both love Mark Wahlberg and have enjoyed Seth MacFarlane's work. Ted was... okay. Seth's voice was a little too continuous--making it feel like we were just watching a very long episode of the Family Guy. And the story arch was obvious. But it was basically harmless and had some touching moments. In short, I woudn't watch it again, but it was an amusing way to spend part of an evening.
B0045NXMJE|5.0|This is another of the outlandish French movies in the same style as City of Lost Children and Delicatessen. It's over the top but very entertaining.
B000059HAI|5.0|Wonderful opportunity to watch the attack on Pearl Harbor as a third party, seeing Japanese and American actions and reactions.
B001HN69AY|4.0|What is real and what is imagination? How do our actions affect our and others' future? I liked it because it was entertaining and had a moral
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This has kept my son entertained for hours.. other than his complaint about there being too much pink ,lol, he loves this game
B0063IH60K|5.0|First class app. I only wish there were no ads. Works great on my fire. Five stars except for the ads.
B007UQRW62|5.0|I love this movie so I waited and waited for it to come out on blu-ray. It finally did! And it came with an umbrella! I'll probably never use it, but I'm glad this is finally on blu-ray.
B0076DELIG|4.0|It was not Mr. Connelly's best book but it was very good and I recommend it to any Connelly fan.
B0083SBJXS|4.0|He loves this movie and all the movies that led up to its creation. We recently bought a 3DTV so we had to rebuy it as a 3D blu-ray.
B002V0GZ9M|5.0|I have seen this movie starring S. Bullock and K Reeves a couple of times and I enjoyed it every time as it symbolize \\"hope\\" and \\"second chance\\".<br />The two main characters have not met prior to their corresponding to each other by writing letters and depositing it in the same mailbox and this is no ordinary mailbox. If this sound intriguing so far I highly recommend you to watch it if you haven't and also if you enjoy watching both S Bullock and K Reeves in the same film.
B0095T3H2U|3.0|I rented this late one night when I had nothing better to do. My husband doesn't take me to see &#34;chick flicks&#34; so I usually have to rent them on my own if he hasn't spoiled them by informing me that they rated poorly... this movie was pretty good, entertaining at least, and kept me engaged.
B005NFW0U0|5.0|I am a vampire junkie, ever since Twilight came out I am so hooked. Even though I am a FT SAHM, I just can't get enough of the beautiful cast and overall plots from week to week. Thank You Amazon for such a great option and service. You ROCK!
B0080BFWAE|4.0|I watched this movie fairly often growing up, so when it came out on blu-ray I knew I had to have it. The price was right and it plays it well. Nothing fancy.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|My adult son downloaded this for my grand kids.  They love it.  It's a good game to have when we need them to sit still for a while..
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Good book. You've done it again Jeff. I finished in very little time, too.  I recommend this book. Thank you Jeff
B001ANSSDC|5.0|The book was riveting; I didn't want to put it down at night and couldn't wait to see wait to see how it would end.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|On the Kindle Fire, found this app had all the expected functionality of a Good clock radio, combined with a white noise generator in the sleep setting. Recommended product
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|Longish...and pretty dark, but ultimately redemptive. Enjoyed the movie with my spouse, but the bad guys were more violent than I thought really necessary to make the point of despicable evil. The Blu-Ray would be spectacular and Batman's vehicles are fun to watch. Interesting story and good characters, too. I think you'll like it.
B0092D1V5Y|1.0|I will delete this from my Kindle. It offers passwords like 12B&#62;&#60;/. Why did I try this in the first place?
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I work in health care and appreciated reading about NDE from a professional and personal perspective.Dr Alexander's career as a neurosurgeon lends credibility to his description of his NDE. I felt that reading about his personal life helped to balance the more intense parts of the book that dealt with the actual NDE. I felt that some of the material was philosophical. These sections were harder to grasp.
B00571F26Y|4.0|The only reason I didn't give this a 5-star rating is that I believe the author goes a little too far for me in what he uses in some of the recipes in the back of the book and the way he advocates avoiding some things (besides wheat) and some of the substitutions. The most helpful thing I learned was why wheat may be harmful to your health, and the role it has played in the obesity &#34;epidemic.&#34;
B001NS7J02|3.0|The Top Shelf Edition of Bloody Kisses is supposed to have two discs - one with all the tracks from the original release, and one with 8 bonus songs. This only has three songs glued onto the end of the album. It'd be much more satisfying if it included the remaining five.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|INSPIRED ME TO NEVER GO NEAR YEMEN NOR EVERY BE CURIOUS TO GET TO KNOW THE WHYS OF ITS BACKWARD CURLTURE.  NEEDED TO TAKE MANY SHOWERS AFTER THIS BOOK.  DEMILLES CHARACTERS WERE THE ONLY THING THAT KEPT ME GOING
B004I744AS|5.0|You cannot beat this dictionary App.  Yes it is supported by ads, but they are pretty unobtrusive.  If you need to quickly know a definition, synonym or antonym, you must get this.  Even has a nice home page with word games, quotes of the day, weather, biographies, etc.  Works well with Kindle Fire HD.  It's free... go ahead and try it (you have nothing to lose).
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Not John's best book. He didn't warm to the subject with his usual<br /><br />insider insight.  I keep thinking he &#34; he must owe his publisher a book and he has a deadline&#34;. Come on John - get back in the court room.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abbey is my new addiction!  Unfortunately I bought this season just before it went live on Prime for free rental.  However, it's nice to know that now I can download these episodes to view when ever I want to.  Re watch these episodes to stay current with what's going to happen in season three (can't wait here in America!!).  I see Emmy's all over the place!
B0015DYIH2|4.0|Captures you in the details but the supposed fight scene was blah and could have used some action. The happy ending was a nice touch though
B007BRJYF2|5.0|I passed some time with my ten year old daughter playing with this App.  She and I very much enjoyed it.  With two pairs of eyes and two minds, it goes a lot quicker and was not so frustrating.  We finished the game in about two sittings.  It was good clean fun and we enjoyed some quality time with each other.  Take a risk and buy it... if you have a \\"tween,\\" you might enjoy the time spent with him/her on this game~
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|I enjoyed this movie but it was a pretty predictable. Not one of my top Pixar films but enjoyed it anyway.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|This book is largely about a child's experiences with a virtual reality MMORPG. Now for the interesting part: the author actually seems to know what an MMORPG is, and is fairly familiar with online gaming, gaming in general, gamers, and even the technology that brings all these things together.<br /><br />That is really, exceedingly rare in my experience.<br /><br />Beyond that, I liked this book quite a bit. I look forward to reading more from Cline.
030758836X|1.0|Worst book I have EVER read, too bad I can't give it negative stars. It is NOT suspenseful(maybe for a minute.) The plot twist was a joke, I think I feel asleep reading it a couple of times. The main characters are boring and predictable.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is beautiful, intense, passionate and has a sprinkle of humor. Thank you Colleen for writing this book and sharing it w./ us.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Absolutely excellent third book in the series. I only wish there was more. The story just makes you want to keep reading. The entire series is excellent. I sincerely hope E.L. James continues to write more books....soon.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|Picked this up when it was the app of the day and haven't found anything better yet. Would pay for this app in three future if I needed to. Amazing.
B007N9FKCY|3.0|Graphics are pretty, gameplay is ok, after a level or 2 I have deleted it but not before I let my 2 year old have a crack at it, he didn't care for it that much either so it was an easy decision to clear space on my phone.
B003UESJFG|5.0|This is one of my top 5 favorite movies.  It looks stellar on blu-ray, and sounds insanely good.  I rock it very loud and it is high quality even at the loudest settings.
B0042FZOFU|5.0|A great deal on all 3 of the toy story movies in blu-ray. Much cheaper than buying them invidually. Includes all 3 movies in blu-ray as well as a bonus features disk, but no dvd or digital copy formats. Not a deal breaker but it would have been nice to have them for the car, but this likely would have raised the price as well. Happy overall with this purchase, and our daughter loves them!
161218412X|5.0|Great bookset, the pictures don't do it justice. I was dubious when I bought it, now I'm absolutely certain it was the right choice.<br />The bookset contains every book on Sherclock by Doyle and is realy beautfiul. Hardcover, good paper, nice decorations.<br />If you want to start reading Sherlock for the first time or want to have the collection, this is definitley the way to go.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|In my opinion, this is one of John Grisham's best works.  I am an attorney and fully appreciated his view of prison life as I represented many felons and visted them in jail.  His ever turning plot is fascinating and a fast and interesting read. I heartily recommend it.
B00A2IUHM6|4.0|I liked it some may have a problem wrapping there head around it but if you watch Famlily guy and others you will like it as its the same humor. Also I love Mila in this movie... she is stunning.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|By far the best show on TV. I love Daryl, Rick, and Glen. I hope they never get killed off.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Very fun game kinda like farmville for kids. Keeps my daughters very entertained.Games are not too complicated for them and levels seems to move quickly.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Read this.<br /><br />Don't think about if you should, just get it, read it, and stay up past 2am like I did to finish. It is THAT good. Just make sure you have a box of tissues or wear a shirt you don't mind smearing with mascara.<br /><br />This book defines the New Adult genre in that the main characters are teens on the cusp of adulthood, they deal with adult situations, and there are sexual situations, yet not graphic. I can't recommend this highly enough for anyone who loves a story that builds without anticipation, then slams you in the heart with a whole new feeling of apprehension and desire.
0142000655|5.0|East of Eden is a book that I have santed to read for a long time but kept putting it off.  I am so glad I purchased and read it recently.  The sibling rivalary goes from generation to genertion just like Cain and Abel in the book of Genesis in the Bible.  I certainly enjoyed the vivid iscriptions of the characters and landscapes in this book.  The text is excellent.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|As you might expect, the acting is well done but the storyline is boring and predictable.  Some cute moments if you cannot find anything else to watch.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Anybody who likes period pieces should love this.  And if you read the book don't worry about being disappiointed.  The script was remarkably similar to the book.  Also, Richard Armitage is perfect casting!
B009SQRL4U|4.0|Had never heard of this movie before we found it on Amazon Instant Video.  We really enjoyed it and plan on including it in our holiday movie classic list.
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|This product does everythinv it said it would do. The directions state not to make a deep cut but we found putting more pressure and making a deeper cut produced more consistent results.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I've read every one of Tom Clancy's books which tend to be on the long side for novels, but I always find them too short.  This one is no exception.  Well done Mr. Clancy!  Tom Clancy is one of the few authors I re-read at least once, and often more.
B0016CTX68|5.0|If you don't already own it, you should. Just buy it. There is not a bad track on this one.<br /><br />You really don't need me to convince you--just listen to the samples of each song .<br /><br />Go ahead. I'll wait. Pretty awesome, right?
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|If you like Family Guy, American Dad, etc. you will love this movie. If you dont you suck and you will probably HATE this movie. :)
B007EECSFA|5.0|I really enjoy the characters that Kate Morton gives us.  The story kept me in suspense the whole time.  She is a master of her craft!
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I can't wait for the other movies of the trilogy to come out if they are going to be anything like this movie!
B00AMBH70S|1.0|does not measure up to the original.  they'll do anything to make a buck.  apparently amazon doesn't understand the need for brevity.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|i love this game and so do my grandchildren..until my 5 year old grandson ordered a $20 coin pack! please have some sort of lock-out for this non refundable item!!!!
B00932A6G4|1.0|There should be a huge disclaimer that this is just a cartoon, or animation or what have you.  It's not worth the trouble to watch it.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|Love this game!!!  Great graphics, good sounds and great fun...thanks amazon!!!  When you need a switch from WWF this is the way to go!
B00APUYWYA|4.0|It is what it is and doesn't try to be anything else, which makes it a fun watch.  I also liked the tip of the hat to John Hughes movies of the 80's.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|if I could only remember to use it once I find it and then remember to go back and look at the notes I left myself :)
B006GHA9VQ|2.0|I could hardly make it through this show.  Maybe it would have been better had I seen the show in person first, but it was painful.  As someone who has seen the Phantom of the Opera musical over 10 times on stage and who loves the movie version featuring Gerard Butler, I was really hoping to fall in love with Love Never Dies.  Not the case.  Very disappointing to see how Andrew Lloyd Webber saw the story continue as that's not how I would have liked to see things turning out after the end of Phantom of the Opera.  And I didn't like any of the songs either.  I will be looking to sell my blu-ray as I won't be watching this again.
B00APUQRPC|3.0|I love Clint Eastwood's movies, but feel this one was not one of his best!  His acting is always great, but......the movie was a little too long for the story content (just my opinion)!  I did enjoy seeing the scenery of the North GA mountains, and wish they had given a little more time in showing the beauty of that area!!
B001EC2ISA|5.0|Classic Michael Keyton movie about the difificulties of &#34;Living&#34; in the hereafter.<br />Great comedy for all ages and I highly recommend it.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|good story line and nice graphics. kept my attention and was challenging enough to keep me interested in wanting to find out what was going to happen next.
B000SW16LC|5.0|A feel good tale that we all can use right now. Not to be missed. A wonderful story about miracles, families, and good will.
B003FKZFX4|5.0|Best fun you can have watching Clive Owen literally shoot EVERYONE. And Paul Giamatti is fantastic too. Great fun guys!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this DVD to workout while I am at home during the day and I like this workout a lot. Product shipped in adequate time!
B007THA4FI|2.0|Too slow to get started. Could not finish it. Maybe it picks up, but I gave up. I could not connect with it. I tried it because I loved Harry potter.

B001DDSH8U|4.0|Good songs, mostly excellent, There is not a song on this that I do not like, But after awhile, they all started to sound a bit the same.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Works on DROID razor maxx. Can forward, send emails, view them as normal. Dont use the email app pre installed on phone, but this. Works great. Also compatible with kindle fire
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I finally found out why everyone is playing Angry Birds.  It is a very fun and slightly addictive game.  I like the many different levels.
B00632HWOG|1.0|Unable to load any information at all.  For some reason it never uploads any mail it just keeps loading and loading
B007TXN4TK|4.0|This is an enjoyable activity to use on my Kindle Fire.  It is a fun musical activity that can be done by adults and children.
031606792X|3.0|I read through the whole Twilight series just to see what all the fuss was about.  I'm not a fan of the series at all but to each their own.  The fourth book is much longer than the other 3 and takes some turns not everyone is expecting or ready for.  I
B00A0R0CG0|5.0|The movie kept my kids smiling and laughing. I had to force my 11 yr old out the door to school this morning because she wanted to keep watching it.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|I love  taylor swift music but i think this one is the best by far. I love every single song on it!!!!!
B001BMKOZW|5.0|This was a birthday gift and my friend loved it!. He asked for it as birthday present. So far, i've heard it's a good album.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Kids - age 5-1/2 love it.  Cute game for kids - not violent and they make funny piggy type noises.
B008G59IKO|5.0|My daughter loves these ¡UNO! and ¡DOS! cds, but she's a huge Green Day fan so she likes everything from them.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I have 5-1/2 year old twins and they love this game.  Also, it is not so difficult that they can't enjoy it.  Challenging enough to keep them entertained but easy enough to avoid frustration.
B008C1O8CA|5.0|My daughter loves these ¡UNO! and ¡DOS! cds, but she's a huge Green Day fan so she likes everything from them.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This was the first Lee Child book I've read, so I intentionally picked the first one of the series.  I'm a huge Michael Connelly fan and thought it was about time to give Lee Child a try.  It was an interesting plot, but I found some of the situations that Jack Reacher got into were a bit unrealistic.  Nevertheless, the book kept my attention.  Good book, yes; great and one I'd encourage my friends to read, not so much.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|This book was excellent, all I expected and more. I'de recommend it as wonderful reading during the Holiday Season and throughout the winter season. It is a good conversion novel.
0375413405|5.0|Love it.  My husband gave it go me as a present.  The recipes are all wonderful though more complicated than I usually do.
B003M7BLOW|5.0|To start with, my old desktop motherborad died in 2009, and I found the easiest route was to just buy a new HP Presario CQ5300F for $250, and at the time it worked okay, as I wasn't doing anything that required a lot of computing horsepower.  Since then, I have gotten into HDR photography with Corel PSP X4, and processing three 7 meg JPEG photos into one 3D color map takes a lot of computing power, so it took a while.  Then I bought an Epson V700 scanner and am scanning all the color negatives I have taken from 1974 - 2004, and processing 80 meg TIFF files for the highest dynamic range AND Infrared dust and scratch removal at 6400 DPI really ate up all my compute's horsepower.  So I started looking into a processor upgrade.<br /><br />It appears that I can't post the link to a \\"Compaq Presario CQ5300F\\" here, but if you Google that and go to the specifications site, you can see the specs and compatibility listings for the Narra-5 motherboard as far as processors are concerned.<br /><br />It was obvious the Sempron single core processor was the cheapest available at the time, and as you may note while an Athlon X4 processor is listed, the Athlon II X4 processor is NOT, and the Athlon II X4 is listed as am AM3 socket, while the motherboard is listed as an AM+2 socket.  All the listed AM2+ processors are now obsolete and only available as used chips, and I wasn't going to take a chance on that.  With enough reading on the web, you will find out that AMD did provide an upgrade path, and the ONLY difference between an AM2+ processor and an AM3 processor is support for DDR3 memory.  That's all!  There was still the sticky issue of possibly requiring a BIOS upgrade from the motherboard manufacturer, and this could be a problem as the motherboard manufacturers come and go, and get bought out and change hands like a bottle of whiskey at an Irish wake.  At any rate, I bit the bullet and got an Athlon II X4 processor IN THE BOX, which means it comes with a cooling fan.  Pullingout the old Sempron and literally DROPPING IN the new Athlon II X4 was a snap, and while I was initially worried that the new cooling fan plug had 4 wires while the old one had 3, the fan still ran.  I powered up the computer, and the thing came up in a flash, so there were NO BIOS ISSUES!  And yes, the computing speed does appear to be about 4X of what it used to be, so this was a simple and easy fix.  You will also want to max out the memory on the motherboard, and unless your older system has a 1 TB internal hard drive (unlikely!), getting a USB 3.0 card and an external 1+ TB hard drive is a good idea, and will max out your data storage throughput.  So putting an AM3 processor in an AM2+ socket was a no problem 10 minute job, and well worth the $70 bucks I spent for this!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|he drives me crazy. the love hate relationship is fun to read the way she does what she wants knowing it's not going to be her best interest, I hope he is only ten shades when this one ends!!!
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|This is definitely a must see for all fans. I'm not much for words but Christian Bale and leading lady, story line was excellant Kuddos to directors and staff.
B008IYR2BA|4.0|I would consider Dexter season 6 not as good as 4 or 5. I think the other seasons had more tension.
B009WJ14FA|5.0|This disc plays very well, but it sounds as though this is one of those bands you want to see live, preferably in some small roadhouse.  There is a good amount of new R&B out there that borrows a lot of sound from the past and Vintage Trouble joins that from the more hard-rockin' blues side of the tracks than most.  Not every song is a &#34;5 star&#34; but a very good effort overall and worth the purchase.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was beautifully written and had me in tears both happy and sad. Shows true strength and love.  I loved this book.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless was my 217th book I've read this year and with out a doubt is on my top 5 list of all time. I read for multiple reasons.  Sometimes to excape, sometimes to feel something I'm missing, to learn, to cry, to grow...and the list keeps going. But I know with out a doubt that this book brought out a different willingness to read. I was so engaged in the characters; the way Colleen wrote was as if I could picture their exact movements in my head. It was brilliant. I would suggest this book to anyone. AMAZING!!!!!!
B0015AARJI|5.0|el articulo llego en buen estado vendedor muy atento y el currier igual lo recomiendo tanto a este vendedor como el currier
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|a very insightful story and a delightful read. i enjoy who they all end up being. imaginative and evocative and fun to read.
0439023521|4.0|This is an interesting enough read. It is a little awkward at times bein written in the first person. My teenage granddaughter loved the series.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|quite disturbing in the end. a good read and quite thought provoking. thankfully i couldn't relate at all, as was all pretty disturbing.. it made for a good book group discussion.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I'm a mother of 4 who works overnights.  A regular alarm clock doesn't cut it. This app forces my brain to wake up.  Love all the options!
B008I34ZFW|5.0|It may not be one of the best movies of the year, but it is certainly one of the most memorable! Of course, once you accept that this movie IS about SPACE NAZIS and that the US President is SARAH PALIN, then you are ready to embrace the full sheer ridiculousness and wackiness of this film. A must see!
B008FTAAG2|4.0|Must say for the 3 songs I liked, did not make up for the rest of the disk. Over all a good listen but would not recommend.
