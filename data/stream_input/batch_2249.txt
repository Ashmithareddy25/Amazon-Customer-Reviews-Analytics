B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was one of the most beautiful books I've ever read! Everything in this book was amazing, the characters, the romance, the story, the twists, the revelations... just everything!! It is just a beautiful story about being a victim and of surviving and overcoming.<br /><br />Sky and Holder truly are a couple, they compliment each other well and the connection they share is undeniable. This couple's journey was not easy, there are some dark and horrible things that they suffered in their past.<br /><br />It is all around intense and you will end up sitting at the edge of your seats! Well done to Colleen Hoover on an awesome novel.

B00BBQXQFI|5.0|I loved everything about this movie.  It takes familiar mythical characters (Santa Clause, Sandman, Tooth Fairy, Easter Bunny and Jack Frost) and tweaks them just a bit and then tells an amazing story about Evil trying to make a comeback and these &#34;Guardians of Children&#34; save the world with lots of magic, the discovery by Jack Frost of who he really is and one little boy who still believes in Magic and is the key to success.  The art work and animation are superb and the story is very clever.  I loved How To Train Your Dragon as well and still do.  I don't understand why this movie did not do as well at the theaters.  It is considered a flop by Dreamworks but I think not.  They are laying off 350 animators because they claim the studio is now in financial harm.  I just can't believe that this one movie could do that.  Get this movie on either virtual theater or Blu Ray DVD.  Watch it with your kids and you will see from them that magic is very much still alive.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This was a great book. It starts off slow, but toward the end of the end it got really good.
0525953728|5.0|Subtitled \\"The Autobiography of a Navy SEAL,\\" half of NO EASY DAY is devoted to the raid that killed Osama Bin Laden. The other half says a few words about the private life of Mark Owen (a pseudonym), but is mostly occupied with Owen's life as a SEAL before the raid. Though a forthcoming book may have more details about the raid, or maybe right now a website has more, NO EASY DAY did not leave me wanting. MORE detail would be boring overkill. Of course Owen made mistakes--every author does--but this is the eyewitness story of a participant, and at least in some regards it should be treated as an authoritative source.<br /><br />The 299 pages of narration are formatted with wide spaces, allowing a fast easy read. Extras include two portfolios: one with sixteen color photos, another with a very helpful set of diagrams for the raid.<br /><br />Owen gives only a short biography of Bin Laden and little about the post-9/11 search for him. And he hardly mentions the pre-raid decision-making process in the upper echelons of the military and in the White House. In those regards Peter Bergen's MANHUNT is much better. Bergen's account of the raid, however, is weak and it left me puzzled. Owen's text and diagrams made everything clear, absorbing me in a tense, you-are-there, uplifting experience. The other half of the book is fine, but all by itself Owen's account of the raid earns his book a concrete five stars.

B009VIZDLI|4.0|A first-time local (Melbourne) novelist, he’s won awards, had huge advances, been accepted by Text and been sold in over thirty countries, so I had to see what all the fuss was about. Like ‘The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time’ by Mark Haddon, it’s about a person with Asperger’s Syndrome, though Don is a professor of genetics, rather than a teenager. The characters are all very clearly defined and there are a couple of ‘projects’ which form the thread for the plot. Apart from that, it’s basically a feel-good love story with a strong dose of humour. I enjoyed it – an easy holiday read, not particularly deep and meaningful.

0439023491|5.0|Oh, Catching Fire why must you do this to me! I really thought I was on Team Gale after The Hunger Games but I really think Peeta stepped up in Catching Fire. I may just be changing my mind, but it is up to Mockingjay to form my final opinion. Catching Fire builds on top of the tiny sparks left by The Hunger Games and turns the story on its head. Katniss feels very alone in the beginning of Catching Fire. She knows that she is facing trouble from the Capitol, and Peeta and her have a very strained relationship as do her and Gale. As a young woman who could not have understood the implications of her actions, Katniss must strive to prove that she and Peeta are deeply in love, or danger may be lurking around the corner for her and her loved ones.<br /><br />The suspense of Catching Fire, and some specific moments I am not going to spoil for other readers stole my breath away. The tension in Catching Fire can be felt almost right away and it continues throughout the book. The districts are on the verge of rebellion, and the Capitol is looking to place blame, blame that is falling on Katniss. Catching Fire is an emotional read, because there are moments when I actually had to stop reading just to catch my breath and re-center myself before continuing.<br /><br />I think where sometime in a trilogy or series the second book does not live up to the hype of the first book, but that is not the case with Catching Fire. If anything I think, Catching Fire outshines The Hunger Games, which is not an easy task to accomplish. Katniss has always been a very caring character, but in Catching Fire, readers get a glimpse of what she would be willing to do to save those she cares about the most.<br /><br />I wanted to read Catching Fire ever since I read the Hunger Games before seeing the movie. I cannot wait to continue with Mockingjay, and I am glad I did not have to a year for it to come out like original Hunger Games fans. I really wish I had read it soon, because it is an original masterpiece of young adult fiction, which will remain popular for years to come.l masterpiece of young adult fiction, which will remain popular for years to come.
1439153663|4.0|Reading this book made me feel the same way that \\"The Help\\" did.  I felt I shouldn't like it, that I should prefer a genuine (read nonfiction) story written by people with a more direct connection to the history, but I got involved with the story and had to finish it.<br /><br />The book has a blurb from Alice Walker saying, \\"This book, like The Help, does important work.\\" I'll agree that the context is important for us to remember, that is, the life of slaves and indentured servants at the turn of the 19th Century.  However, I wanted a more intellectual book, but this is simply a soap opera set in the slave South.  That is the part I felt guilty about - that I actually enjoyed it.<br /><br />It is easy to forget that white immigrants were often indentured to pay the price of past debts or ocean passage.  In this case, Lavinia is placed into service as a child to pay the debts of her parents who perished in the crossing from Ireland to the U.S.  She lives in the kitchen house and grows up along side the slaves of the plantation, adopting them as her family.<br /><br />The story is told from the viewpoints of Lavinia and Belle, the slave child of the plantation owner.  Switching back and forth between narrators lets us see two sides of the story, exposing the idealism of Lavinia and her misconceptions about life across the color line in the antebellum South and providing a more complete picture of life on the plantation.  As a child, Lavinia does not understand that her possible upward mobility at the end of her indenture does not apply to her new-found family, nor does she understand the power structure of the plantation even into adulthood.  This lack of awareness is sometimes, but not always, a source of the tragedies of the novel.<br /><br />The story spans Lavinia's life from the age of 6 until young adulthood.  During this time there are many changes at the plantation affecting the living situation of the slaves, the health and fortune of the owners and the productivity of the farm.  The story is engaging and the pace of tension and release builds nicely to the climax.  There were times when I was bored with the story and thought about abandoning the book, but find the final scenes rewarding and satisfying.
B001E45XT4|3.0|Nothing really special here to be honest. Personally I used them for a short amount of time and decided to go with Corsair Vengeance 1500. I have not regretted that decision at all. It's not to say I didn't like this headset, but I feel it's value is a bit lower than it sells for, there are better ones out there for a little more investment<br /><br />The pro's I can give it!<br /><br />Seems very sturdy for the most part<br />I like how the mic flips back away into the top part<br />Volume control is one of the best I've seen on any headset
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This book provides an interesting and engaging entry into the dysfunctional world of foster care, and the damage it does to the children (and sometimes families) in the system. However, as a novel, it is flawed: the characters, aside from the protagonist, are mostly flat and unbelievable and the coincidences rampant. The structure of the novel was attractive. In short, I liked it but did not love it.
1451695195|5.0|A really enjoyable book and I recommend it for all.  Very imspiring and uplifting.  I hope more people with these experiences be writting books like this in the future!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this solitaire app. It works perfectly with no bugs. I like the various backgrounds and card designs. It's addictive!
B00B23O96A|4.0|I personally love this album.  It reminds me of Slowhand in terms of musical exploration.  As a guitar player myself I appreciate the focus on the ensemble aspects of performance on this record.  True musicians do not showboat their skills every chance they get, although the guitar work is unmistakably Clapton here.  I find the arrangements very well produced and interesting to listen to.  As for critics of the children singing towards the end of \\"Every Little Thing\\" the liner notes credit Clapton's daughters, and I think it's cool that he included his kids on this.  Those expecting a recording displaying guitar virtuosity will likely be disappointed, but music lovers - especially Clapton fans - should really enjoy these tracks.  To me his voice sounds better than ever, and there are some very talented musicians gathered here.  Blues are the roots of jazz, rock, reggae, and country, so EC hasn't strayed too far from his first love on this!

B00BLCHYKU|5.0|In this world of rehashed garbage and a general reluctance to venture out of the box in regards to television programming, Vikings sets a very high standard. Raw violence, and an immersive visual experience really make Vikings shine. History Channel is really breaking through and making a name for themselves in the scripted television genre.

B009VIZDLI|4.0|The novel opens with Don Tillman, a genetics professor about to give a public lecture about Asperger's Syndrome as a favour to his friend Gene, a psychology professor.<br /><br />`The timing was extremely annoying.  The preparation could be time-shared with lunch consumption, but on the designated evening I had scheduled ninety-four minutes to clean my bathroom.'<br /><br />Don, you see, is routine-driven and socially inept, and is probably the best person to talk about Asperger's (he seems a very likely traveller somewhere on the autism spectrum).  Don is focussed on efficiency, and now as he is nearing 40 it's time for him to get married.  The solution is simple: the Wife Project, involving a 16 page questionnaire designed to enable Don to eliminate unlikely candidates before he wastes his time getting to know them.  Very efficient!  Enter Rosie, a 30 year old, whom he thinks Gene has sent him as a possible candidate.  Don quickly realises that Rosie would fail his questionnaire, but despite this he's a bit interested.  When Rosie tells Don that she wants to find out who her father is, and then the Father Project comes into play.  In trying to help Rosie find out who her father is, Don learns more about her, himself, and the illogicality of romance.<br /><br />`I had no idea sport could be so intellectually stimulating.'<br /><br />It's light, and funny.  Don may be an unlikely hero, but he is a likeable one.  And Rosie?  She could be perfect for him.  I understand that this novel started life as a screenplay, and I can imagine it as a light romantic comedy.  There are a number of laugh- out loud moments in the story, especially where Don describes some of the situations he has found himself in.<br /><br />`Welcome to the real world.'<br /><br />Jennifer Cameron-Smith

B000GRUMPU|4.0|I love movies about the sea, i.e. especially about power-driven ships, big or small. (The sailing ships are less interesting to me, unless, of course, any of them should happen to have a pirate crew aboard! Errol Flynn still \\"rocks\\"!) Nonetheless, ultimately I guess that I have to go to the 1972 movie, \\"The Poseidon Adventure\\", or to this 2006 remake, titled simply \\"Poseidon\\", for some real ship-kicking fun. My experience on ships as a young sailor was with those of Second World War vintage, and these modern vessels, like the Poseidon sort or any such cruise ship now, are mystifying, with all of that advanced technology. Then, atop that, things are mostly upside down, of course, once the ship has capsized completely! Those factors bewilder, as well as the fact that cruise ships have come to look, and to operate for the passengers, more along the lines of floating hotels (with or without casinos) than more recognisably like \\"real\\" sea-going vessels!<br /><br />Still, it's fun going through the guts of any ship as the actors do in this film, so I was happy that most of the film takes place not in the ballroom and passenger cabins, but deep within the ship, right to the bottom of its overturned hull. For those who like the \\"innards\\" of ships most of all, this is fun to watch, as, for the same reason, so much of \\"Ghost Ship\\" was, too. The actors mostly are okay, and it is nice to have a talented little boy passenger among them, instead of adults entirely. I'll be watching this again!

If you're on the line about buying it go ahead, you won't regret it!
B00B23O96A|4.0|EC does not have to prove his guitar genius at this point in his career and he did what felt good to him. Who can fault him for that? I'm a true Clapton fan and I will go on any journey he takes me on; I sat back and enjoyed it with the respect he deserves and I felt the sincerity in each song. To the reviewer who complained about the young children singing on 'Every Little Thing', they were Eric's three little daughters and, as he sang, he wants to hear his children sing. I loved that! At least 6 of these songs will be in some of my I-Pod's playlists.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|Just saw SLP...I was expecting it to be very good...Jennifer Lawrence won best actress (well deserved, BTW), DeNiro was nominated.  What I just can't understand is why Bradley Cooper wasn't nominated for best actor.  He is absolutely riveting in a very complex part...and richly deserved to be among the nominees. What I wasn't prepared for was just how good it could be...how powerful and emotional it was.  I was crying at the end...and not ashamed to admit it.  That's what a great movie with great actors can do...bring out emotions in those who see it.  This was one of the best films I've seen in years...Chris Tucker was excellent in a supporting role.  Man, this one shook me up...but in a good way.  I love it when I'm moved by a film and this one really got to me.  So, if you haven't seen it, I urge you to go, you really need to see this one.  It's that good.

B00ADW4I9O|5.0|If you've browsed this far, you're either a fan of the movie, or a fan of composer Basil Pouledouris. Either way, you're going to buy this set.<br /><br />The complete score has the opera-quality tracks that you've heard on the original MCA soundtrack album--Anvil of Crom, Riders of Doom, The Leaving/The Search, The Orgy, Funeral Pyre, Orphans of Doom, etc. It also has some incidental music that's really only for completists. You can probably live without Pit Fights, Warm Welcome, Wolf Witch, and Head Chop. However, those lesser tracks are a small price to pay to experience the score as a whole. When The Orgy transitions directly to The Defilers, the way it does in the movie, you'll never again be satisfied with the original MCA soundtrack. Plus, it was only after listening to the complete score that I noticed the theme from The Orgy is a leitmotif appearing in The Tower of Set.<br /><br />Enough of me talking.

It's hard to fathom that she could create such amazing characters in Harry Potter, who you attach to and actually miss, and then write another book where not a single charcter is likable.  I'm actually angry with her editor/publisher for allowing her to publish this piece of rubbish.  Skip it entirely and re/read the Harry Potter Series.  You'll thank me.

0307887448|5.0|Time to grab the controls and get a blast from the past. Now press the Ready Player One button.<br /><br />Ready Player One is an 80's gamers' paradise. Filled with references to class 80's hits like Pacman and Ultraman, the novel tells a story about a young man in search for a video game Easter egg. The winner of the Easter egg wins the deceased creator's fortune. Throughout the story, the protagonist races to the finish against an infamous organization who want to control the video game world, while, at the same time, the hero has a romantic connection with a rival player. Ready Player One displays a theme of how big corporations are taking over the world and we have to stop it.<br /><br /> The story is plot-driven but has a gamer hero that people can relate to. Everyone has that moment where you feel great after beating a difficult level in a game or the frustration you feel for dying and the hero, Wade Watts, does have his moments. The protagonist Wade Watts lives in a poor community with his cruel unloving aunt, having OASIS as an only highlight. James Halliday created OASIS, a cheap (.25¢) massive multiplayer online simulation. Halliday also left his wealth and ownership for up for anyone who finds the three keys that hide his fortune. Wade is one of the people who studied Halliday so he can achieve the money. As the story progress, the tale is filled with plot twists and riveting, it keeps you guessing about who wins in the end especially with a notorious company trying to take over OASIS.<br /><br />Wade Watts is a dedicated gamer who knows what he has to do to make money. He speaks of how OASIS is an escape from his unfortunate reality while we use technology to escape as well. He has also has his ups and downs in video games with the thrill of winning and the gamer rage of losing. Additionally we can sympathizes with him when he was rejected by his crush/rival, don't lie everyone gets rejected at one point.<br /><br />The book is fill with descriptive imagery that doesn't go in much detail but paints a good enough picture. If you're looking for metaphors, similes and other figurative language, you won't find a lot with this book.<br /><br />Overall the book is fun to read and makes you wish you could have the game. The book is not just for gamers, its fun for everyone to read and don't be afraid of the references either, you will be happy with the unpredictable story line.

0307346617|3.0|There were five of them, a man, a woman, three kids, they had him pinned on his back, the man was on his chest, the kids had him by the arms, trying to bite through his suit. The woman tore his mask off, you could see the terror in his face.\\" Filled with zombie encounters and<br />controversial war tactics, World War Z falls in the approaching horror story category but gives off the pity reminiscent feeling after a long war. A whole chapter named \\"Goodbyes\\" displays the endings of the war, a soldier explained \\"There was no cheering, no celebration...I'd been afraid for so long, fighting and killing, and wanting to die that I guess I just accepted it as normal for the rest of my life.\\" The book's main message is exactly what happens from beginning to end of a world war and how humanity tries to rebuild it.<br /><br />World War Z is written in different perspectives at different times of the war against the undead. With some cliché moments of the zombie is going to kill me but I survived, they still provide the riveting but contrived feeling that keeps you at the edge of your seat. The beginning is filled with almost no one taking any precaution toward the event, believing that it's just a joke, especially the Americans. Many cases display how ignorant Americans are about the zombie war and how they were indifferent to the whole event till they became the victims. The middle contains the overall riveting events in a consistent pattern; politician, military, and civilian. Politicians' story is rather dull and uninteresting and it makes you want to throw your book away, filled with social problems and how their roles will help the war. Military and civilian stories are exciting and page turner, mainly because its stories that people can relate to. In one of the interviews, a soldier talks about what he saw in during a major battle in New York. He saw a family of zombies attack a soldier from behind and watched it all form the camera on that the soldier was wearing, healso saw people shoot themselves and other soldiers out of desperation or have the feeling that they will never win.  The ending is contains reminiscent and remorse feeling that everyone feels at the end of the war.<br /><br />There are plenty of characters in World War Z, but the villains are obviously the zombies. The zombies in the book are the slow walking moaning dead body that won't die till shot in the head. The zombies are not unique like they are in video games and other horror movies, they are quite cliché really. The politicians in the story are hard to connect with unless you're really into politics, the book really makes politician come from another world. Military soldiers and civilians only have the thought of wanting to survive makes them absolutely relatable.<br /><br />There is a decent amount of descriptive imagery and no figurative language at all but there are many symbols that zombies can represent.<br /><br />The verdict of the book is a long dense plot-driven story with both dull and riveting moments. There is a great amount of people so never really connect with the characters. However the politicians' stories kill the book but the military and civilians only slightly make up for it.

B0071XO8RA|4.0|Good read but not as compelling as I was led to believe by some other reviewers. Seemed there were quite a few boring parts I found myself skimming through. I believe it's worth a read.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I am so impressed with this book.  It covers things that no other writer<br />tells us. One example is &#34; wheat is no longer the same wheat your<br />mother used to make bread,&#34;  It's been compromised by additives and more,  My<br />daughter told me about this book.  It also has some wheat-free recipes,  Great<br />informative read.

B005CRQ3H0|4.0|This novel is a clever parody of the corruption inherent in crime-ridden Los Angeles in the 1960's.  The narrator is  Doc, a private investigator/pot head who still has enough wits about him and periods of clarity to navigate between the police and the perps.  Born in the environs, Doc  is a young white guy with a giant fro who speaks the hip lingo that gives him street cred to characters on both sides of the law, as well as those on the edge, which combined make a complex and entertaining thriller.<br /><br />The conflict is between Doc's personal moral code and the cesspool of values that surround a missing person's investigation.  The myriad of games being played by acquaintances in high and low places, including a lost girlfriend, are so complicated it takes a while to sort out.  The violence is lightened by Doc's sense of humor and references to the music, outfits and language of those tumultuous times.  The only drawback is that Doc occasionally gets carried away with personal digressions.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|this series is fantastic. i'm a true fan of sylvia day. i don't usually read a series when it's relatively new... cliffhangers kill me. then of course you have to wait a year for the next one. what i do is wait till the series is rolling with about 3 books then i pick it up and get started. my friend recommended these since i liked fifty shades. well, now i'm hooked.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|You cannot go wrong with this flash!! I had a generic Polaroid flash for my camera, but it died just after an year of use... Then I decided to go with this Nikon flash (after reading several reviews and searching for best option)... I could not be more PLEASED with it!! It gives the perfect amount of light on every picture!<br />I was concerned about some reviews that mention the door lock for batteries were not good: unless you are an ogre handling your camera and flash, don't worry about it! it works perfectly!!<br />This is a great flash, well build and I didn't have any problem with it so far (around 6 months already).<br />If you are in doubt on getting something cheaper, I'd say from my experience, go with this flash! It's worth spending some more once than having to buy another one later on...
B006LSZECO|5.0|First person narration is a favorite of mine, so a friend gifted me a copy of this e-book for Christmas (it was a book she loved and she knew I'd love it, too). Not all authors can pull off first-person narration, but this author did it splendidly -- handling the viewpoint of two different characters. Both characters have their own definite personalities and ways of expressing themselves.<br /><br />Some find fault with the ending of this tricky tale, but for me it was satisfying and fitting. Your mileage may differ, but even if it does, it's still worth your while to read what comes before the final pages.<br /><br />This is an author to watch.

B0070UFMOW|4.0|I'm giving the E17 four stars even though I ended up returning mine.<br /><br />If you are looking for an amp/DAC combo, this is a great value.  The package is intelligently designed with the only flaw, the menu 'time out' is way too short, you can barely get from the 'menu' key to the scroll keys before the menu resets.  An outstading physical feature is the combined optical/3.5mm jack connection for SPDIF -- another outstanding feature is the complete assortment of cables and adapters included with the product.<br /><br />If you are just looking for an amp, the value is not as great.  I had previously owned the E11 and returned it;  the sound quality of the E11 was not as good as the $60 JDS cMoyBB amp I already had.<br /><br />The sound quality fo the E17 was supposed to be considerably improved over the E11, and the tone control (bass and treble, both boost and cut) were supposed to be better than average.  Also the amp has selectable gain settings of 3, 6 and 12.  Most other amps have a one or two level bass boost only, and have a fixed gain setting.  The JDS CMoy, for example, only has an on/off bass boost and a has a set gain (although the gain can be selected at the time you order the unit).<br /><br />My sources are a new model (NWZ-E475) 16Mb Sony Walkman and a Smasung 4.0 Galazy Player; for headphones I use the phones Sony supplies with the Walkman, the Sennheiser cx300's, the MEElectronics A151's, and the new MEElectronics A161's.  I listened to many types of music, a few FLAC but mostly -V0 -q0 MP3's.<br /><br />One problem (and the ultimate reason I returned it) immediately became apparent -- far from being 'excellent', the tone controls made the overall sound 'not as good' as soon as they were taken off center in either direction.  This is a very common problem with tone control circuits -- the Samsung Galaxy player's EQ has the same problem in a differnt way, as does the Sony walkman to a lesser extent.  Now we're not talking bad sound here by any means, but it was at that point that I got the JDS Cmoy out for comparison.<br /><br />I got more bass from the E17 with the tone controls flat than I did from the JDS cMoy with the bass boost on -- not a lot more but more.  But as I kept listening, the overall realism and emotional involvement with the performance favored the JDS.  It's hard to describe, although the slightly greater bass boost of the E17 gave a pleasing warmth, the instruments and voces seemed a little 'flat', the soundstaging seemes a little off -- not much but more than the JDS, which also didn't sound perfect but more like the recording presentaion I hear on more expensive equipment.<br /><br />Call it a close to a tie in sound quality with advantages and disadvantages each way -- but if your use is amp only the e17 only comes up if the extremely small size and switchable gain are requrements -- otherwise you go from the JDS cMoy to the O2, which although I have not auditioned is widely agreed to sound better than the JDS cMoyBB and only costs $5 more than the E17.  The O2 is small but not really pocketable, if you neet smart-phone size matching the next step up is the JDS C5.  If Fiio would market the amp section of the E17 at a price near the JDS cMoyBB, it would be an option for those who needed the E17 options in a very small package.  If you also need a DAC, however, the E17 is an outstanding value.

B004EBT6HE|3.0|While there is good character development and an interesting, if totally unrealistic, plot line, &#34;The Hammer of Eden&#34; was a disappointment when compared with so many exceptional works of literature written by Ken Follett. Follett is one of my favorite contemporary authors and his works are usually very well researched. He has an ability to interweave actual happenings into his story lines but, in this book, he completely missed his commonly high level of excellence. I usually give his books the highest score possible but, in this case, it rates only a mid-level score.<br /><br />The same story written by an unknown author as a first book may have gotten a high rating but having read all of Mr. Follett's writings prior to reading this book I was very disappointed. I cannot believe that Follett himself would choose this book as a representation of his best work.

0756404746|2.0|Considering the near unanimous acclaim this novel has received, I was stunned at how poorly written it was. Entire paragraphs make no sense and 10 words are used where one might do, or none. It was like someone had a blank piece of paper and felt compelled to fill it rather than actually having something to say as a writer, and I am making a distinction of writing as opposed to the content, even though I didn't think very much of the pedantic magic as subject matter either. It was obvious the writer was trying to be clever and artistic and even poetic but the sloppy and confusing prose makes Edgar Rice Burroughs seem thoroughly modern and clear. The fact it apparently took 7 years to write makes it all the more puzzling.<br /><br />Reading the novel actually made me angry, as much for comments comparing it to GRRM and saying it was the best in 10 years and it made people laugh and cry and re-reads taking it apart chapter by chapter. I really just don't know how I can be so adrift compared to these reactions. And The Name of the Wind predictably suffers from being a short story extended out to novel length.<br /><br />I am not making these comments in a vacuum. I was reading \\"Palace\\" by Katherine Kerr and Mark Kreighbaum at the time. \\"Palace\\" is an SF novel that has received virtually no acclaim or attention and yet from a writing standpoint is a work of art. Each paragraph is carefully considered and there is no hemming and hawing, dithering and basically wasting time til the end of the novel finally approaches.<br /><br />Most writers then and now would've made \\"Palace\\" double the length it was. Kerr and Kreighbaum had something to say and they did so economically but with a ton of innovative ideas so that the effect is one of a densely artistic yet clear novel where the words you read actually count for something; there is absolutely no padding and the effect is anything but shallow.<br /><br />There is a difference between interesting world building with artistic baroque flourishes and simply wordy and unclear prose, and The Name of the Wind lays this out, though apparently not to very many people.baroque flourishes and simply wordy and unclear prose, and The Name of the Wind lays this out, though apparently not to very many people.
B00AFQC4QC|5.0|Christoph Fischer's THE LUCK OF THE WEISSENSTEINERS is  a book that I approached with some trepidation. The theme of WW II Holocaust has been so well presented in many books so it is not an easy subject to compete in.<br />In my humble opinion it is a historically accurate story, I am not a historian, but I have explored that era in depth.  This is a story where the reader gets to know the characters and walk with them through the horrors of WWII.<br />It is very balanced in showing that everyone suffered in a war, that in some cases it brought out the best and the worst in humanity. So it does not limit the story to The Holocaust, but rather brilliantly paints a picture of many aspects and in particular Czechoslovakia.<br />With brilliant stolen moments of joy and human kindness, agonizing moments of human suffering and enough survivors to insure that the tale felt very plausible and believable.<br />All prejudice, all wars should be remembered lest as a society we could be foolish enough to fall in the same steps. As clich&eacute; as it may seem to quote George Santanaya `Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.'<br />Mr. Fischer entertains and informs in a manner that makes the past painful and easy to remember. I recommend this as a historically accurate, emotionally poignant  a moving MOST worthwhile read.

B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book was very good and I liked it so so much it was very enjoyable and has a very deep meaning
B008K8VDPU|1.0|Not interested in playing piano.  I am very interested in an app that I could learn reading notes and also study and learn piano notes.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|This was a great game to play.the story line was pretty good.so we're the graphics.look forward to playing more games like this
B00881VLCE|4.0|Really like this one -- I continue to enjoy-- have a nice time with this app.  Would like more choices on puzzles.
B008XKT9FG|4.0|Interesting story about somewhat of a tramp doing a good thing.  There was a great message about not letting life's upsets screw up your life, and about how your own personal  version of an event are not always trust worthy.
B008OOYALE|5.0|It is so addicting I love the cool combos of the dragons my fave is the water dragons I think they should come up with more thing to do with them like playing with ur own dragons
B0053O89RY|5.0|I have the first and second seasons of this show and the third did not disappoint.  This is awesome to watch when nothing is on TV and you don't want to deal with the commercials on Hulu :)
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game!  Play it all the time.  Makes me use my brain.  I do get frustrated (sometimes) when I can't figure out the pattern.
B007EECSFA|4.0|I have read all Kate Morton's books and his one was hard to get through. Still, the ending is wonderful and made up for the long journey.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|LOve, love, love it! This game is so much fun to pass the time away. It is alot like Mario
B00BHNQ5XK|1.0|Stupid movie. Could not even see half of it because it was filmed in dark. Almost made me want to run out and purchase night vision goggles so I could see something. The only thing I could concentrate on was the light switches in the movie and yell at them to turn them on. What a waste of film, money and time!
B003R0MF1W|5.0|The discs came quickly, they play perfectly and were reasonable in price.  What more can you ask?  If you like The Mentalist this set is for you
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show every episode leaves me begging for more. Keep doing what urn doing walking dead because it works. I will be ur loyal customer as long as ur on tv.
B005D51II0|3.0|I did not initially buy this, due to dissatisfaction with the selections -- which did not seem balanced. After my original post, I got a good deal elsewhere, and wound up getting it anyway.<br /><br />Many enthusiasts consider the Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt Beethoven symphonies from the 1960s to be a benchmark, both in terms of performance and \\"Decca Sound\\" audio quality.  I cannot believe they did not provide a sample, in this Decca \\"retrospective\\". (At least the Japanese Decca affiliate keeps that cycle alive).  The last version of the Decca Isserstedt cycle to be marketed here is now deleted, and the three Amazon Marketplace merchants selling USED copies are selling it between $380 to $727.  So, when it comes to proving its \\"connoisseur\\" value, that otta prove my point!<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00005ND3N Beethoven: Symphonies; Piano Concertos; Violin Concertos; Overtures [Box Set]]]<br /><br />I bought the Philips box, which reflected a more inspired compilation of their achievements and artists.  This Decca set should have included more Britten, beyond the requiem. A sample of Chailly's Mahler or Bruckner, more from Ashkenazy as pianist.  I play much more from the Philips set, then I do the Decca.<br /><br />Thanks, Craig

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Downton Abbey is a smash again this season!  The acting is superb and so is the story line.  Anticipate the surprise ending!!
B006M4F67A|5.0|This game presents enough of a challenge that it will occupy me while I'm simply waiting...in line, for a child, for a pot to boil, in a doctor's office, etc.  It never seems to get old and it's a great stress reliever for potentially boring moments
B005D9MUWY|5.0|they have now added slide typing  (like Swype)  I say it's a rap for Swype and other keyboard makers of not now then soon, I wish we could double slide over a letter when we need to spell words like &quot; battle&quot; (Swype does this)  add that and it's game over :-D
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This book was SOOOOOOOOOOO good. I didnt want it to end. As soon as i finished it i went straight to Point of Retreat. You will NOT be disappointed. I hope Colleen has more out really soon!! I LOVE everything she has done.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I'm new to HO ,  this is the 6th game I have done and it was by far the best.  The graphics and color are bright, clear and beautiful.  The story line was interesting and I loved the creepy clown.  I liked that the HO scenes are large to start with and there is also the zoom in feature.  I did use the strategy feature several times in this game,  which was helpful when needed.  This game is challenging enough to be fun and not frustrating.  It took a very long time to download but there were no glitches.  Great game!
B003ELKNHM|5.0|If you're reading this I'm assuming you know of Bon Jovi.  They are a great American rock band with such classics as &#34;Livin' on a prayer&#34;, &#34;Wanted Dead or Alive&#34;, &#34;Bad Medicine&#34; and countless others.  To me this is their greatest album.  Better than Slippery When Wet, or anything after the early 90's, it has a great collection of songs, each one identifiable.  If you want some catchy rock songs then this is the album for you.
B0006AAS5G|3.0|This watch is a nice looking watch if you want something dressy.  The lume is nothing like it is on my 8926 OB.  It keeps accurate time and is waterproof to 660 feet.  For the money it is a good buy.  I give it three stars because the lume on the face is weak and doesn't last all night like it does on my 8926 OB.  But it is a great alternative to wearing the watch it is a copy of (Rolex Daytona) and you don't need a bodyguard!!!  It is not a true chronograph but it does have the look without the expense.  I like it and am actually thinking of purchasing another.

B003E6LC6I|5.0|You never know what is going to happen on this show.  That's why I like it, it's unpredictable.  Glenn Close knows how to draw you in and make you believe her.

B005LAIIHG|4.0|Life of Pi(released Sept/12)stars,among others,Suraj Sharma as Pi,age 16,Irrfan Khan as Pi,adult,Tabu as Gita Patel,Pi's mother,Adil Hussain as Santosh Patel,Pi's father and G&eacute;rard Depardieu as the Cook.This is a stunningly visual treat which keeps you mesmerized through a good part of the film.The animals that one sees through a good part of the film,are mostly CGI creations.And it is not hard to tell that they are just that,but the film doesn't linger too long on them as to undo your suspension of disbelief altogether.Lee just keeps pushing the story along.<br />And that story opens as a reporter in Montreal is interviewing an Indian man who starts to relate a rather bizarre tale;one that will have you \\"believing in God\\".The man relates as to how he got his name of Pi,as in the mathematical symbol.It seems an uncle liked a swimming area in Paris called the Piscine Molitor,and he became Pi for short.One day the father sees the writing on the wall and he decides to move his family to Canada;Winnipeg specifically.The father and the family run a zoo.They sell what animals they can and take the rest.<br />Part way through the voyage,just past Indonesia,a fierce storm comes up and the ship sinks,taking with it Pi's entire family.In a lifeboat hanging from the davit,there is the ships cook,into which is thrown Pi.Suddenly a Zebra loose from below decks,jumps from a storey up and onto the boat,breaking both its legs and sending the cook overboard and the boat into the water.Pi ends up in the water more than once but witnesses from under it the ships last breath as it sinks beneath the waves like a surreal lighted leviathan.Pi makes it back into the boat.Next morning things start to move.A hyena suddenly appears from under the boat awning cover and starts to harass Pi and the Zebra.Suddenly an orangutang joins this motley crew.It isn't long before the hyena gets its sea legs and it starts to attack and kills the zebra.Time passes and it goes after and kills the orangutang.Just as it is about to attack Pi a tiger comes out from under the awning and kills the hyena.From this moment on Pi must learn not only to survive but survive without getting eaten by the tiger.<br />For the first part of their journey Pi builds himself a makeshift raft on which to live,keeping a rope attached from the boat to his raft.Eventually,after many travails,and at the end of his rope,Pi comes on board and teaches the tiger how to behave when told.It surprisingly works and the two get on relatively well.They come upon a floating island whose inhabitants are mostly meerkats.It has fresh water ponds in which to drink and the tiger has plenty of food(meerkats).As Pi lay asleep in the night the meerkats take to the tress and the tiger goes back to the boat.The why becomes plainly clear when at night the ponds become acidic and kill everything that are in or may fall into them.Pi and the tiger leave the island the next day.They eventually wash up on shore in Mexico and are rescued.<br />Shortly thereafter reps from the Japanese shipping company come a calling to Pi asking questions about the reasons behind the sinking and his story of survival.Pi relates the tiger story to them and when they ask for the truth he relates another story of he being stranded with his mother,a sailor and the cook.The sailor was injured and the cook killed the sailor.When a struggle occurs later his mother pushes Pi to safety as she gets stabbed to death.Pi later returns and kills the cook and drifts alone at sea until he reaches Mexico.In the present the reporter looks at the actual shipping report and it seems the reps chose the tiger story over the other.When asked by a now grown up Pi which one he preferred,he replies the tiger story also.The film ends as Pi introduces the reporter to his two children and his wife.<br />After all we have seen and experienced Lee decides to give us a nice twist of an ending.Which story would we have preferred to see?.....the tiger story of course,and that is what we got.As the film begins one wonders where it is going as it visually describes Pi's childhood,which has its funny and serious moments.But the movie really starts to take off at about 30 minutes into the film when the ship begins to founder and sinks.One really feels like you are right there with Pi as he experiences the monumental loss of not only his family,but his way of life,all his belongings and the ship that would take him to a new life.With just his wits,some common sense,the teachings of his family and his religious beliefs,he must somehow survive and endure an indescribably tough,but at the same time,beautifully rich life trial.Along the way we are treated to a myriad of visually stunning moments such as the appearance of bio luminescent fish and a whale who breaches as it comes up to feed on same,the meerkats on the island,the sinking of the ship and so many more.And,if you haven't guessed,they are just that much more stunning because it may not have been real to begin with....right?<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1.There is an\\"extra\\"category on this DVD but all it contains are trailers.Kind of a false advert if you ask me.<br />All in all a treat for the visual senses.A simple story told with a straightforward touch but with a heck of a twist ending.The CGI animals are good but not fool proof,and Ang Lee steers his film with a deft touch never lingering too long on any one thing.It was nominated for 11 statues and won four.Well deserved.4 1/2 stars.Excellent but not perfect.nd that is what we got.As the film begins one wonders where it is going as it visually describes Pi's childhood,which has its funny and

B008220C38|2.0|This movie was totally boring and very hard to follow. The costumes were gorgeous and basically the only reason I bought the dvd. Keira Knightly  seemed to be totally somewhere else and should have just stayed home.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game. I think the fact that you can refined everything is great cant wait to play more
B008L1F91A|1.0|Superman is not asian because he is not asian and by the way, Superman is not asian. When Superman is busy not being asian, he is still not asian.
B00005UPNK|3.0|We were allowed to buy the Region 2 version of this DVD, when knowing where we live we should have been advised<br />that this would not work on our equipment. Now I have to return it.
B004UC4HCG|5.0|This is the second sh67h3 I bought and put into service. These make great home computers when you need more resources than a laptop.<br /><br />I have been building and using shuttle computers for over 12 years.<br /><br />great little desktop.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My daughter absolutely loves this game. I have to wrestle with her sometimes to my kindle back. I am glad I downloaded it and have recommended it to many of my daughter's friends moms.
B0063IH60K|5.0|does what I expected - nice game with only one quick ad before the game,which can usually be skipped over.
B003LXSY60|4.0|You can't go wrong with a Black Keys album. Not every song is priceless, but they all share a common grooviness. They're just plain good and fun to listen to.
B009J2VQSK|5.0|Jennifer Lawrence is captivating...<br /><br />Starts slow and builds, totally grabbing you.  Excellent movie and soundtrack.<br /><br />Hard to connect sound track with movie passages, but it is all good.  14 cuts.
B006BXTOFC|4.0|They're one of the hottest bands around these days, and for good reason. They're workaholics and the consistently churning out great tunes. All their albums share a common grooviness.<br /><br />Adding Danger Mouse in as your producer can never be a bad thing. If you like later Black Keys stuff, check out Broken Bells.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|A great cd with voodoo and I stand alone.  Whenever I'm feeling down, I just jam out with this cd.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|If you purchase the Voyager Legend I would recommend you pick up one of these as well.  The case is nice for keeping the oddly shaped (but extremely well performing) unit from getting lost and/or beat up, and the USB cord for the charging case is a decent length - and standard mini-USB - unlike the standard propriety charger for the bluetooth.  My only regret was not picking this up when I bought the Voyager Legend.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Susan Cain helps to demystify some of the negative assumptions in our world today about those that are introverts. In addition, she discusses many of the great introverts of the present and past, who changed our world for the better. If others have often described you as 'shy' and you've taken this as a not so flattering description, this book is for you!!
B009CG29RK|5.0|My kids love this movie so much and can't wait for part 2 to come out... DEFINITELY buying...please hurry up and come out kids are driving me crazy
B0019HQIFE|5.0|If you're a John Mayer fan, this is an absolute must have! John's guitar playing is unique and I use the video to help learn his technique. Besides that, his concert is phenomenal.
B008Y6TD5A|4.0|loved the aquistion of justice and the intensity of the movie. Russell Crowe is always good and a trusted choice for viewing.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Always enjoy Nicholas Sparks, but kind of predictable. None the less good love story with a little suspense. Quick read.
B008Y73940|1.0|too much ganster stuff. Felt like I was at work and after viewing it, I felt like I was living in the inner city.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|If you ever wanted to see a child's book come to life. See this movie. The characters are lovable, sad and heroic. as children's books should be. The casting is fantastic. Edward Norton as the scoutmaster only concerned about his own kingdom of scouts but who eventually realizes that there is more to life than a daily routine is perfect. Bruce Willis as the lawman was great.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|First off I'd liked to say I am an avid reader. I have read beautiful, gut-wrenching books as well as books that should be considered a joke.<br />  Beautiful Disaster lived up too its title. At first I thought it was just going to be another romance novel where the 'bad boy' falls for a 'girl-next-door' and they fight to prove they belong together...yada yada. And don't get me wrong that was the main idea, but this book also introduced a new twist of these predictable types of characters. The main characters are disfunctional and their relationship is beyond dangerous but their struggle to love eachother is intriguging and fun to read. In no way is their relationship safe, normal, ideal, realistic, sane, or the perfect happily ever after! But I think that's why I loved the story so much! It was different, creative and trully a Beautiful Disaster.
B00AGKHFCA|5.0|The songs are all memorable and with Andrea;s voice at top form are very romantic no matter what the language.<br /><br />My favorite song of course is Love in Portofino, which takes me back to my first experience as a young man in Italy, falling in love with the beauty, romance , and of course the women of Italy. LaVie en Rose duet with Edith Piat is so inviting that I had to play it over and over again. Who would have thought that JLo would provide a romantic counterpart to one of the great tenors in Quizas.<br />I loved the who CD.
B00999DFP0|3.0|The dvds were new and in excellent shape.  If you use ebay, you will find the exact same product for a fraction of the cost, also new.  Starting prices are around 35 bucks, compared to the 100 we paid.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Absolutely, the best Bond film of  all time. It takes us to his roots of Skyfall, his vulnerability. I loved the throwback to using your wits and mind rather than gadgets to outwit your adversary. Bond's vulnerability, M's showing her age and his undying loyalty to her, brings us back to an age of chivalry that we all long for in movies. Javier as the villain is priceless, as a victim of M's win at all cost mentality, where even those you care about are just pieces in a chess game. Love the action and the humanity in James Bond.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Many shows wait too long to get characters together and the sparks fade away.  Castle has another good storyline they can milk out for the season and whatever happens later can be a mystery.
B002C6K7NU|5.0|We are huge skynyrd fans and we LOVE this CD! Every track is awesome, you won't regret the purchase! Enjoy!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Continues to add more depth to main character's personality.  Always keeps the reader guessing as to who the good and bad guys are.
B004GJXQ20|4.0|Not a bad story, had no idea what it was about. Decided to see what the fuss was about, took a bit to follow but then really got into it. Nearly finished book 2.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Story was great, although some of the writing was amateurish.  It was great to have the perspective of a scientist.
B00B7IJBUY|4.0|I remember when I heard the circle for the first time... I was upset, I thought it was a mediocre album with no hits, no rock songs, lack of something this guys always had. When I red about what about now, I thought I was going to be completely dissapointed. It´s not their best record obviously, but they got back something they missed on the last record. Lots of people complain about them doing soft music, but they were never \\"heavy metal\\"... they were hard rock, and some bands rock harder than others. Bon Jovi were always colorful, happy & melodic.<br />The \\"fast songs\\" or non - ballads are really catchy, they got lots of hooks that work just fine. The thing that I just didn´t like at all were the ballads... My god, sooo boring!! They made them so acoustic, so western, I dunno, but i just hate them, I don´t understand how the ballads come so awful, when this guys have written some of the best ballads in rock music. The art was also a bit dissapointing... i know, it´s not about the music, but it comes in the package of purchasing a CD, not a mp3 catalogue.<br />I´ve red some reviews complaining about \\"the guys who wrote you give love a bad name, living on a prayer\\" ... but guys, come on, this ain´t the 80´s no more, This guys are 50 or more, they got other things going on in their minds.  Although I agree they can be more rock (songs like we got it goin on, this is love this is life, dirty little secret, everyday) i guess Bon Jovi do things their way, and after 30 years of great music, they deserve to do what they want to do when it comes to music.<br />Best tracks:<br /><br />Because we can<br />Im with you<br />What about now
B004MC8CA2|5.0|well so far i haven't had one problem its very conveniant and has everything you need notes book marks etc. everything you need.
B0090SI460|5.0|The best movie we have seen in 3D so far.  I was in shock at how good the 3D quality was.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I bought this as instant video and watched it on my computer--how awesome!  I watched the whole series in two days.  Loved it!
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|I liked Denzel in \\"Antwon Fisher.\\" a Lot. But this didn't grab me right off, and if that's the case, it won't get you back later. It didn't. Curious why investigtors didn't say right off, Oh BTW, you were under the influence? Then he just quits using and all? Makes no sense. No one I ever heard of would have done that. They'd do the denial in short order for quite some time first. Why was co-pilot going 'Oh, no!\\" Would YOU say \\"Oh, no\\" if you were on the plane?? No, me neither. Not even something logical like dammit? He was on my last nerve.<br /><br />I hated this script, and the music made little sense. but all of which was expensive, or overpriced. Guess how much the Stones must charge to use 'Sympathy\\" in a movie? But the song didn't add anything there! Hated the FX. They could have looked at \\"Socerer's Apprentice,\\" where I was enthralled right off, and looked for Industrial Light and Magic right away. Weird, senseless script. Someone must have called in a favor unfortunately. This could have been so much more. Where was Stallone? He at least knows how to write a good drama script if you're going to pay someone a lot. Get this/order from the library like I did. Don't they have real addicts in Hollywood they could have used for realism??
B008EZVNO0|4.0|Having been a fan of Van Morrison for more than four decades, I have heard a lot of great albums from him, a few mediocre ones, and a couple that were awful. In his golden years, he seems to have found a safe formula to make music that sounds unmistakeably Van Morrison to long time fans. He takes few of the kind of creative chances he once did even though he adds a few jazzy touches to this one with a very competent band. Is Born To Sing: No Plan B the snorer that some claim? Not quite, but neither is it a career milestone. While it is somewhat better than some of his more recent albums, it contains nowhere near the artistry of his best ones.<br />My favorites here are Goin' Down To Monte Carlo, Born to Sing, a remake of Close Enough For Jazz, the bluesy Pagan Heart which evokes the days of Too Long in Exile, and his very timely obligatory rant Educating Archie.<br />The CD comes with a booklet containing a few critics reviews, the lyrics, and details of who plays what on which track. Most Van Morrison fans should enjoy this one, but you know there will always be a few naysayers who have their own reasons. Check it out and decide for yourself.
B00122MWBK|4.0|This is a pretty well rounded album with all my favorites on it! I was happy that it had both new and old songs.
B00A8307BG|5.0|With Roots and Branches, Robin Trower has done a very difficult thing: in recording an album of mostly covers, he has managed, at least to my ears, to make every cover song both excitingly different and better than the originals. Here is a man whose music is rooted in the blues who has finally gotten around to making the kind of album that shows his listeners where he is coming from.<br />I like every song on the album a lot, not a dog in the bunch. But my favorites are a superior take on The Thrill is Gone, Little Red Rooster, I Believe To My Soul, That's Alright Mama, Born Under A Bad Sign, and See My Life.<br />The CD comes attractively packaged with only song titles and and sparse liner notes to guide you. But man, what a recording. Roots and Branches is simply stupendous!
B009GEEMLY|5.0|What more could you want, then most of your superheros in one movie.  I mean Iron Man, Capatin American and Thor just to name a few.<br /><br />I recommend this to anyone who wants to lose themselves in a move that is there to entertain.  Forget your daily grind, gather the family and sit back, relax and enjoy yourselves.  This is one of the few movies that you can watch with your family.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I absolutley love Daria! Its a really funny show. This boxset is really amazing. Not only do you get all 5 seasons but you also get the 2 movies! And at a great price too. Only $25! You cant beat that
B0095P31L6|4.0|This was a funny movie, good for a chuckle.  Kids might like to see a lizard trying to be a cowboy, but a lot of it will go over their heads.<br /><br />I enjoyed it, but they missed the big funny to make it 5 stars.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Well it gets addicting but after a while you get bored and you kinda forget about it but it was fun to play it while it lasted
B0095P33IW|5.0|This movie was like the ones I grew up with.  Lots of action, with the hero front and center, and the female scientest falling for him.<br /><br />Brings back memories of Buck Rogers, the old Superman and of course our Cowboy heroes.<br /><br />If you want a movie without the blood and gore.  If you want to be entertained and just to sit back and enjoy, this is the movie for you.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I get to train and care for my horse and its an awesome game for FREE!!<br />my little brow and sis love it and so do i
B007REV4YI|5.0|After seeing it in the theater, I wanted to see it again and have a chance to appreciate all of the rich content.  Certainly worth owning, for any James Bond fan.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|Just when I started to really wonder where the David Bowie that I loved for all of these years had gone??? Yes he had some decent releases and moments here and there but WOW this is Bowie at his finest  since his Berlin trilogy period!!! ...No kidding it's that good! I just can't stop listening to this album almost every day!!! It's like going back to my childhood or at least the excitement of it when I used to listen to all of those classic albums from so long ago and discovering treasure after treasure while doing so with repeated listens. This is one of those rare albums that grows and grows on you with each time you listen to it. Remarkable!!! If this isn't one of the greatest comeback albums of all time..it's pretty darn close!!! Personal favorites on this album ...although almost all the cuts are good, The Next Day, The Stars are Out Tonight, If you can See Me - Bowie at his Manic best!!! Also, Boss of Me and Dancing Out in Space, How does the Grass Grow. Do yourself a favor and get this album.... if you have any pulse at all .....you will not be disappointed!!! Trust Me. I guess some things really do get better with age. BRAVO MR. JONES!! ;-))
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Easy to use, very similar to the PC program, Intuitive, navigates easily, it is unbeatable for ease. I use it regularly.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Fast read....I just wanted to jump in the book and help! Be careful ladies, there are beautiful monsters out there just like Lee. Great book! Will be looking for more books by Elizabeth Haynes.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|fun game. I enjoy it. it is a good game to pass time. wish the energy level would raise faster though
B008476HBM|5.0|This is one of my favorite books of all time. I have read it over and over. It will never get old!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.Once i picked it up i couldnt put it down.If you like to read and like romantic books i recommened getting this book.I really like reading Nicholas Sparks books they always keep you wondering whats gunna happen.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Believe it or not, I have had Amazon Prime for over a year and have not stearmed anything to my TV until now.  It was easy to setup, Video streamed flawlessly, and the movie was really good.  One of the best Bond's ever.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This series is a wealth of information on society in the early 1900's a families status, the obligation to care for the Abbey, social interactions at all levels and great wit. Great characters! Some with the utmost integrity and others you wouldn't want to turn your back on if they had a knife in their hands. The &#34;all about me&#34; society of today could learn a lot from this show. : )
B004J4WKTW|4.0|From the first page, I enjoyed the immersion experience of The Magic Circus. What a treat to visit with this book for a few evenings, to lay aside the day's cares and concerns for a while and be transported to a place I wish existed.  The Night Circus is one of those books whose end, while eminently satisfying, comes too quickly. In fact I am writing this review after finishing it as much to savor the lingering feeling as to recommend it to you and to thank Ms. Morgenstern for the gift.
B00AQMSJI2|3.0|It's an ok game but I don't get why u an having trouble getting the updates.  It says it has one but won't let me do it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's soooooooo much fun but they just need more update  commonly... I just log  to play with my friends on it
B009WO7NQO|4.0|TOTAL AWESOMENESS!!!!!!! AMAZING FUN FOR EVERYONE!!!!!!! MORE LEVELS MORE FUN!!!!! Only down side is that you have to pay for some levels.
B00ARAO720|5.0|This really was a very good movie. It kept me guessing till the end. The action of quick bike riding was well done.
B0008JIJ2E|5.0|I want my young nephew to see this movie. This movie is thirty years old and yet carries some of everyday conflict that we see with the younger generation today.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|An unusual book. Not your stock happy ending, but more a message of hope. Interesting, well drawn characters. Want to see the film!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|my horse is a game that involves caring for a horse, involving feeding, training and upkeep. wish it was easier to obtain gems but its a cute game so far!
B008FPOIT6|4.0|I enjoyed the book.  Well written and good flow in the story with nice character development.  It was not a book that kept me reading, but had enough interest to pull me back in to the story each time I picked it back up.<br /><br />Few flaws in my opinion, but not enough to reduce my opinion of the book:  Suto Spoiler alert.<br /><br />1) Its quite obvious the author likes Apple computers, to the point of me saying it was written by a &#34;fan boy&#34;.  To me it was a bit over the top.  When the Google people are using them I said Okay, really?  Chrome book?  Chrome OS?  Both Google<br />2) Pretty sure both laptop batteries die as do camera batteries and headlamps.  8+ hours of steady use and I not a single mention of the any battery changes or plugging anything in.
0374533571|5.0|I loved the movie, but read the book after the fact and it was one hundred times better...I know that's often true, but this case is a standout.  The book was touching but sometimes laugh-out-loud funny.  I really recommend this one.
B0075PYG1M|4.0|Robert Glasper has done a great job with this album. A lot of great guest are on it. I highly recommend it.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Very vivid and interesting read seen from many perspectives. One of the better zombie books I have read. Would recommend for any zombie enthusiast.
B004GE81CK|5.0|How can one not listen to this and say &#34;genius?&#34;  Oh, and by the way... These are beautiful and dare I say, brilliant songs.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|My husband and I love this 3D. It is a very good addition to our 3D Library. Good quality, excellent picture, lovely story...
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I approached self-publishing with some trepidation, having never done anything like it before, but I found everything I needed in this book to make the process easy and quick. I highly recommend this book.
B00007KWI9|5.0|Five stars for 5 English prog rockers covering all the bases (including Byrds, Beatles, and show tunes) on their first album. If only they had Carly Simon guest on a version of Nobody Does It Better (it's a fantasy ... Don't knock my hobbies). I have loved this album since first acquiring it in its vinyl first pressing. The CD remaster adds the show tunes versions, plus others. It is well worth the few dollars  with which you have to part. In my opinion, YES was never more adventurous, nor better. Just to be clear, I prefer this line-up with Banks, Bruford, and Kaye on guitar, drums, and keys. Every Little Thing is a Beatles cover without equal.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This series is so so good!  Thank you PBS for airing this!  I am addicted!!  My mother and sister-in-law are too
B004SC8XHI|5.0|Imagine that The Beatles were from Memphis (TN) and Col. Sanders was their manager. Abbey Road might have sounded like this interpretation of the classic album. To think that this recording's release so closely followed Abbey Road's original release date is just one astounding fact about the creation of this reimagination. Imagine John and George were but a single guitarist; and Sir Paul was born a poor young country boy, Martha White' s son. Imagine Billy Preston had played on the Abbey Road sessions. Imagine Mr. Starkey with more Southern Soul to mix with his Liverpool Rubber Soul.<br /><br />If you can imagine those possible twists of fate, then you are a prime candidate for acquiring this take on what may already be your personal favorite Beatles album. If you already are possessed by the STAX house rockers then you are ready for fish and chips with grits. McLemore  Avenue is to Abbey Road as apple cider vinegar is to malt vinegar; they may  be essentially the same, but they are not really.<br /><br />Buy this CD; turn off your mind, relax; and float downstream. The songs are one road; the music another avenue.  Even so, all paths lead to enlightenment.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Who could argue with this series.  Great entertainment and quality product.  Price was a bit high, but I was willing to pay it.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Thomas, the main character, wakes up in a elevator without the memory of his past life. He is welcomed into a large, concrete area called the Glade, populated by a group of sixty or so teenage boys called \\"Gladers\\". The Glade is surrounded by massive concrete walls, beyond which lie an enormous maze. All Gladers have arrived the same way as Thomas: one every month, with memories wiped. The first Glader arrived approximately two years before. Every week, essential supplies are delivered to the Glade. Thomas meets several Gladers including Alby (leader), Newt (second-in-command), Minho (head of Runners), Gally (Thomas's rival), and Chuck (Thomas's good friend). Newt explains to Thomas that the large openings into the Maze on each wall close at night and the walls to the Maze shift during that time. If a Runner is trapped in there, they are most likely to be stung by Grievers, the Maze's half-animal, half-machine inhabitants. If a Runner is found stung, they must be injected with a serum that causes them to go through an extremely painful process called the Changing, where you temporarily regain memories of your past life. Those stung and injected by the Serum are still certain to survive. Victims of the Changing including Gally and a boy called Ben, both of whom they claim to have seen Thomas in their memory as someone \\"bad\\". Despite the horrors of the Maze, Thomas feels a strange urge to be a Runner.<br /><br />The day after Thomas' arrival, a girl is delivered to the Glade in the Box, arriving with a message that says that she is the last one, but then falls into deep coma.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it so you people who don't like it forget you. I don't now why you would not like it I mean really.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|All i have to say is that this was the best movie I have seen all year and have watched it repeatedly
1878424114|1.0|Just like any other self help book..tells ya what ya already know, nothing exciting or useful...wouldn't suggest to anyone..sorry guys .
B00993G41S|4.0|I've enjoyed this movie since it was first released in theaters. It's so much fun - the characters, the situations, even the end credits are funny.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|It's been a while since I saw a quiet simple film as well written as &#34;The Sessions.&#34; I loved that they focused on a man whose disability could be very tragic but examined his sexual journey in a very matter of fact, almost cheerful way. There was a lot of humor in the film which never became gimmicky. There were many moving moments, thoughtful moments, profound moments that never became preachy or cheesy or melodramatic. I loved that the protagonist's sexual journey brought him in contact with many women but they never seemed like plot devices. Somehow (the writing again) they were all fully realized, beautiful people in their own right, even when the story didn't focus on them. I laughed, I cried and I absorbed and was humbled by the realities of a life so different from my own. I also found myself relating to his story on so many levels. The cast is fantastic. Helen Hunt had quite a balancing act to do in her role and I thought she accomplished it beautifully (while naked no less). William H. Macy is particularly fun as the supportive and very honest priest. I was also thrilled to so Moon Bloodgood in a quirky role very different from her usual action goddess roles. A bonus if you are a fan of Deadwood: It is fun to see so many cast members playing modern characters so different from the ones they play on the TV show. Lovely film.
B003YUSQJK|5.0|I have a pair of Crocs sandals that are easily the most comfortable footwear I own, so when I wanted a simple, slip-on sneaker, I wanted to see if there was anything out there with an insole that comfortable.  Fortunately Crocs is aware of this demand and have produced these shoes.  I chose the canvas because the one downside to crocs is that they're not terribly breathable (hence all the holes in the classic, hideous Crocs &#34;clogs&#34;) but the canvas uppers on these breath just fine.  A word of warning though: these shoes run VERY small.  I normally take a men's 9-1/2 to a 10, but I had to order a men's 12 of these before they fit comfortably with socks.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|seen it 3 times and it still is intense. Recommend for everyone. Not just a Christian movie, great movie work.
B0012FO0DK|2.0|I really, really wanted to like this movie because of the setting but it didn't do much for me -- ended up fast forwarding through it.
1476733953|5.0|The end of every book was completely unpredictable, including the final ending of the series (and in a good way). Its great to read something that feel completely different from anything I've read before so far. Great series! Definitely will read the other ones.
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|It was moving and smart most of the time. Some settings just are not real-- as dialogues in the church per se- no priests would have such conversations in front of other people down the aisle. so at times no very real.It activated disbelief. I also did not find the main female character was well developed, her psychological rendering felt simplified. My husband and I saw it together and felt it was extremely awkward but we agreed interesting in many ways. The main male character was excellent and believable, considering....
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Race the clock<br />get some upgrades<br />run over everything in your path...<br />What else would you do in the lobby?
B003V3FVKC|4.0|A delightful family movie to savor always.  I am so glad it was based on the true story.  It is nice to know this type of family still exists today.
B0014JGDUC|4.0|Yes, I recommend this shoe.  I bought them to work in.  They provide a lot of room for my toes b/c I have a corn on my little toe.  Many other shoes crowd my toes but there is a lot of toe room in this shoe.  The only reason why I didn't mark &#34;I love it&#34; is because I had to buy a set of insoles to go in them for some extra cushion and support.  So far so good.  I have only had them for about a week, so we will see how they stand up.  I can wear an 11 also in womens, depending on the shoe so if you are a ten, this shoe should fit you no problem.
B00846REIS|3.0|I chose to rate this book with three stars because it was good but not great. Maybe I feel this way because of all the comparison to fifty shades so going into this my expectations were too high. Don't get me wrong the book is worth reading it just needs to stop being put up against fifty.
B000002V07|5.0|What else is there to say? It shipped fine and the CD's (I bought So Tonight I Might See, Among my Swan, and She Hangs Brightly by Mazzy Star) shipped just fine.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|I'm glad to say reflected in you was better than bared to you. I was aittle leery going into this second crossfire series because I personally didn't think the first was so great. But if things continue getting better then ill be glad to purchase the third book.
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|I fund that I have to delete and download the app each time my daughter wants to play the game·
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is great if you love a lot of suspense! I have been watching it with my dad and my brother every weekend and when there are no new available seasons, we get really bummed out. Everyone of he appropriate age should DEFINITELY WATCH HIS AMAZING SHOW!!!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game!!! My three year old loves playing it too!! It is especially fun when you get used to playing it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I thought this was a great book it gave you romance and mystery and it kept your interest all the way through to the end.
B00B23O96A|2.0|I got into Clapton when I was in high school 20 years ago.  I became more familiar with his expansive body of work 3+ years ago when I really started getting into his music.  I was anxious to put this into my car yesterday when I got it.<br /><br />The album gets off to a promising start with some reggae, \\"Further On Down The Road.\\"  It's not \\"I Shot The Sheriff\\", but it serves its purpose.  After \\"Angel\\" the album takes a nosedive with \\"The Folks Who Live On The Hill.\\"  I literally started to drift off hearing that.  That song made me stop and think \\"What am I listening to?\\"  There was no passion, no fire, just blah mellow jazz.<br /><br />That's the problem with this album.  It's far too mellow.  Even the new song \\"Gotta Get Over\\", which at least vaguely sounds like vintage Clapton, isn't too upbeat.  I think there were more keyboard solos than guitar solos on this album.  Talk about blasphemy!  Even those couple solos sound uninspired, a far cry from his 461 Ocean Blvd days much less his Cream heyday.  Even when he is in good guitar form, his vocals (never his calling card) are off.  When his vocals are on, yep, his guitar work is flat.  At this point, Clapton has gone from a guitarist who sings to a singer who plays guitar.<br /><br />The plus parts on the album aren't even that much.  \\"All Of Me\\" with Paul McCartney on background vocals and upright bass is alright, but hardly the stuff of legend.  \\"Irene Goodnight\\" has fine guitar work, but again subpar vocals.  The minus parts are really bad.  The final two songs are perhaps the worst songs Clapton's ever recorded.  The sappy new song (P.S. Clapton didn't write or co-write either new song) \\"Every Little Thing\\" is made worse by an off-key children's choir.  A children's choir on a Clapton album?  Oh, brother.  The last song \\"Our Love Is Here To Stay\\" features probably the worst singing of Clapton's career.  It's another jazz song with strings.  There are three songs with strings on them here.  Don't tell me E.C.'s gonna do a \\"Great American Songbook\\" album.  If he does, I'm outta here.<br /><br />Bottom line, the good isn't that good and the bad is quite bad.  Luckily I didn't have to pay for this album.  I also just got the 35th anniversary deluxe edition Slowhand.  Now THERE is vintage Clapton.<br /><br />The other bottom line, unless you're a Clapton completist or prefer the softer Clapton, avoid.  He's this close to becoming a Vegas lounge act.
B0031RAOW8|5.0|I kept an open mind and had to pause it to bring in a box of kleenex. As a dog owner it really got to me in a good way.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I Love keeping in touch with friends. There are some good game. I love saying happy birthday to my friends and family.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Being playing this game for ages and can't seem to stop!<br /> Would Recommend for anyone how gets bored easily.
1439152802|5.0|Another great story from Kate Morton.  I read the reviews before I picked up the book so I was determined not to skip ahead and miss any clues that were given in the story.  It paid off.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and what a great ending!!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Good set up, easy to use and very helpful.  I originally authored with the old style where you had to do a lot of configuration that was difficult and had a lot of problems.  I am glad it is simplified now.
030758836X|5.0|What a story!  Fast reading because you can't put it down.  I loaned this book to a friend who said she could not read anymore because she just couldn't stay interested anymore.  She read this book in a few days...all you need is a good, well-written story!
0714843377|5.0|I'm a copywriter and this book is one of my favorites. It's radical in its attitude to disrupting the status quo... it helped me to see how I was putting up with things in the industry that needed to be challenged.<br /><br />Anyway, back to my title. With every team position I have had, I have lent this book to my Art Director. And not one. Has ever. Given. It back.<br /><br />So definitely buy this book. Especially if you're an Art Director, because I'm fed up of lending you mine.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|Connelly once again keeps his reader on the edge and wanting to turn the page..if you do not want to stay up late reading then do not read in the early evening. He makes you want to see what the next outcome is around the corner...
B000QRIGLC|5.0|A truly amazing journey with 1 of our elite warriors! I winced from the pain, laughed at the humor and cried multiple times! Thank you Marcus, for sharing this story and your phenomenal buddies! A fabulous story that will stay with me the rest of my days!
B00B4VI8MQ|1.0|Once I got the hang of the game, I couldn't go any farther without buying more/updating. Has potential, but should be listed as an advertisement not a free game.
B002BWQ6H6|4.0|This was a gorgeous portrait of pain and love. The characters were each carefully rendered, memorable and real. I don't really understand the negative reviews. The book certainly had substance but was also very entertaining. Anyone who has suffered and endured can identify with the people in the book.
B0062IQNG4|4.0|I love this , but they all have some of the same songs and some I don't even remember. Still great music!
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|I have Adobe Reader on my regular computer, put it on the Kindle and works great, a must have app.
B007ZGO7EM|1.0|I ordered this off my computer and followed the directions for downloading to my kindle fire hd, but it never showed up!!! Very disappointed!!!
1613821670|1.0|It was not the book I was expecting. I wanted a real book, and instead I got some comic-style book. Not satisfied at all.
B003P8D6JQ|4.0|If you're a Twilight fan, you'll need this! Some of the same songs to come in the next albums from twilight, but great music!
B001EBWINQ|4.0|Great love story and memorable music.  Great backdrop love story during world war II.  Play it again sam:)  Love it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I actually bought this book out of curiosity. Wow , it kept me reading until my eyes grew tired. It really deserves the five stars. I loved everything about this book. I'm ready to begin part two.
B001CEE1YE|5.0|Good image and sound quality.The package comes with what you expect and the shipping was on time. I am a fan of the Matrix movies so if you are the same this will work for you.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book, I couldn't put it down.  I highly recommend this book.  Now I want to see the movie.
145470246X|5.0|Besides the amazingly beautiful designs I want to especially praise the very detailed instructions that are very easy to follow. With Sabine's instructions I am not wasting time to understand which bead to go through next. Thank you so very much for giving so much thought to the creation of instructions.<br />This book was well worth the money for me and makes me look forward to taking a live class with Sabine Lippert.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|This games is one of the all time greatest MOBAs for a tablet, I'd possibly even consider ranking it with games such as Halo, and COD. If you have just gotten this FREE epic game, then definitely take the advanced tutorial.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|It is past time that a scientist/doctor should write about an NDE. He specifically is a one that would not believe in such an event. This was very good reading. More should know that the world we live in isn't all that there is. It is so shallow compared to what actually exists. Like one dimensional compared to three dimensional. No comparison. Love is the fabric of the universe. Like a warm blanket it surrounds us.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|These many, many, many years of listening to Bowie, the guy can still blow me away! As with all Bowie, one must listen,i mean, really listen. Got to go, time to turn the record over.
B001BWQWKS|5.0|From their Mozart recording through Mendelssohn to these three French masterpieces, the Quatuor Ebene seems to understand the underlying spirit and culture, to shape their playing accordingly. They are energetic, but never frantic. On these quartets, they sing even the most complex sections with a clarity I have never heard before. They have a gift for phrasing at the highest level, keeping together without feeling mechanical about it. Each of these quartets has been recorded abundantly. This set should be on anyone's Must Have list.
0671777068|5.0|This book is classic Agatha Christie. The plot was excellent, and the ending was a surprise. While it was dated, of course, it was fun to read about English life at that time.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I love this show and I'm not even a huge fan of scary shows or movies. It's just creepy enough to keep me cringing and covering my eyes, but also has awesome characters that I love. It makes me wonder over and over, what would people be like if something awful really did happen in our lives.

B009NQKPUW|5.0|Don't let those morons tell you there's to many holes in this plot.  They're simply too stupid/lazy to think intellectually about what's going on in this film.  One of the best Sci-Fi movies if today.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Mr.Groban never disappoints! This new compilation shows nuances not heard before. Love this class act! I am a long-time faithful advocate, and this adds nicely to a phenomenal venue of art!
B002N5N5M0|4.0|Still a great show. Has a few twists this year. The villan played by john lithgow was probably better than Jimmy Smitts character the previous season
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Wonderful arrangements of some classic favorites with a modern twist.<br />A great buy for anyone's collection.  Cannot wait for their concert in Chicago!
B00AUA67GQ|3.0|This is ok, but then I found the note pad which was also free and I do like it better!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I have enjoyed watching every episode of this series.  When one episode finishes, I can't wait to see what happens in the next.  I like the wholesomeness of the series, the beautiful scenery and simplicity and genuiness of the characters.  I would recommend this to anyone who would appreciate these qualities.

B006Z7Z3S6|5.0|Ti West has done his monster / zombie film w/ THE ROOST, his satanic-panic film w/ HOUSE OF THE DEVIL, and now comes his ghost story w/ THE INNKEEPERS. This is another throwback to earlier, simpler times, when horror was built upon a firm foundation of ever-increasing dread. West captures the essence of the haunted inn, making the place itself a character, and not just a setting. The human characters are believable, the spectres are jolting, and the atmosphere grows thick w/ gloom and impending death. Don't go into INNKEEPERS expecting a HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL / 13 GHOSTS carnival ride. It's meant to get under your skin, not give you big, non-stop thrills...
B008Y1YKE4|3.0|I chose this rating because, I bought this after watching it at a movie. I can tolerate it, but since my great grandkids love it I have had to look for excuses not to watch it again and again, and again. So I think it is rather suitable for them. I really wish I had chosen to buy a little closer to Christmas, but I don't think it was available then. In may have been but I really don't think it was our that it was well out of my price range at that time. But, I did like it.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|While I stagger at the notion I've given a book 5 stars, I was staggered at times while reading Mr. Penumbra's 24-hour Bookstore. It is perfect?  No.  Is it the greatest book I've ever read?  No.  But it glimpses a bit of genius that is so rare, creates such a fully realized world within its pages, that I am staggered. Even a bit of genius is enough.
B000MV9026|5.0|This movie, is also a replacement. It is another one that just took wings I suppose. I know what happened to it, but I had hoped that pangs of conscience would cause the person to return it. It sounds like I run a house of, buy a movie, so that someone can have the movie they want and not have to pay for it. I am not stupid, but I do like to hold out hope... ....// ...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so flipping much it has awesome graphics I love subway surfers .sub way suffers is amazing
B004XZR63M|5.0|I read this book many years ago and it is just as relevant, if not more today. It is essential reading for anyone wanting to achieve financial freedom but may not know where to start.  If you haven't read anything about money or business before do yourself or your children a favor and buy this book. It is a life changer.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|Recently, I started hearing a lot of talk about this show and nothing but great things.. I'm soo happy that I started watching it. Love it and not many shows exist that can keep me entertained.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This game is the bees knees! Its really the most keen thing since cordoroy pants. This game was defenitly worth two bucks! If you can try to pick it up while its still free.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|LOVE Denzel and loved this movie! Movie keeps your attention and not predictable. The cast did a great job and it drove the message home on what it tried to convey.
B001FXCE46|5.0|How could you go wrong with this group, well maybe you can, but this album does have some great hits.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Loved the first season, loved the second season too! I purchased the the third season as well and cannot wait to see it!
B00138H68M|5.0|If you like the Strokes, then you can not go wrong buying this album. I plan to buy their other albums in the future.

B000VXJMYG|5.0|I never heard of them, until one day listening to Jack FM. &#34;The Logical Song&#34;, from that day I decided to buy this album, and it so happened to be on sale from Amazon.
B00AB8BHIA|5.0|I got this for my boyfriend; he's been wanting this vinyl record for a while. He was very happy when he got it and played a few songs for me. The quality was great, it was everything we were looking for in a good vinyl and album.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|The black and white scenarios and the semi-realism, in between cartoon and reality, create a scary atmosphere.<br />You have free first person movement and can enter some buildings.<br />From other reviews I know now that you are supposed to find notes, and if you see the man, you die, which I found out the hard way.<br />There seems to be no defense, but maybe looking away fast helps.<br />I got startled and froze when I saw him standing in front of an abandoned building I had entered and that was a bad idea.<br />Some more variety and a guide would be good.<br />And why are the places called &quot;pages&quot;?<br />It may be they are supposedly comic book pages, but the area is too big for a comic book page, the road track goes on for miles.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|It was an interesting movie and very scary! I liked it and usually avoid horror movies but this one was pretty good!
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I really enjoyed the mix of Old World and New World in this book. The heavy use of Google to decipher a text/code that was hundreds of years old is a great plot idea, and the writing is well done so you end up caring what happens with all of the characters and not just the main guy (that's a big plus in my book). The plot isn't very fast-paced but it keeps you entertained as you follow along with them on their journeys...I was just intrigued and entertained throughout the whole thing. Wishing I had bought it in hard copy instead of a Kindle since I just heard the cover glows in the dark! Ooh, added bonus to an already wonderful novel.
0143116738|4.0|Good book.  A little boring at times but has a lot for you to think about when it comes to life.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|cant beat it. FREE. fun for dad and my 3 year old. only wish there were more track options like there are drivers, cars and upgrades
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Having a friend who was a Marine, I found this book to very true to life based on some of what my friend has shared. I got a good feel for the man Chris Kyle was. He was a patriot. Though he was far from perfect, he served his country well, and turned out to be a pretty good husband and father too.
B005LAIHYU|5.0|I watched this movie as soon as I got it. It sure gives a different view of the Civil War and Abraham Lincoln (I like it).
B008KYOCA2|4.0|Managing everything and using icons as well as different colors for the different members of my household. I had a similar calendar app on my old Palm Pilot and despaired of ever finding anything to match it, but this is way better than that one ever was!
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|For me personally with large callused fingers this mouse and most mice slip from my hand and cause me cramps and inaccuracy while gaming. So what I did was to add some grip tape stickers to the slip points for me and now it is a five star mouse! At the price I forgive the slippery problem I had. The software and buttons all are perfect plus the laser is incredibly accurate. I do recommend it. I hope my idea helps others.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This is by far the best app I have ever used for relaxation before bed. The timer on it is perfect and the sounds are clear. I am asleep within 15 minutes of listening.
B005FISBTO|2.0|Hey Showtime, REALLY?!?  Really?  A spoiler for the season I'm about to watch in a Showtime advertisement at the beginning of EVERY disk that I cannot skip?!  Why?<br /><br />Like I said, Dexter gets a big thumbs up from me, I love the show.  This DVD set leaves much to be desired.  So disappointing to watch the end scenes of THIS season in an ad at the beginning of the DVDs.  An ad that cannot be skipped, cannot be forwarded through.<br />I had been warned about it so I tried my best to turn on the DVD, mute the TV and turn away or go in the other room for a while until it was &#34;safe&#34; to look.  What a hassle when you just want to watch the show! And it didn't quite work for me. I glanced at the TV too soon one time.  Giant spoiler!  Upon finishing the episodes I watched the ad I'd been warned about.  Oh so irritating!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I need this here in my neck of the woods. I don't always catch the news and this app lets me know what to expect in a clear format.
B00APUQRPC|3.0|Liked the old Clint movies a lot better than this one. Im Glad I rented it and didnt purchase it
B00846WWVM|4.0|I've played for about an hour total and had little difficulty beating the levels.  I've sort of lost interest, but my son is constantly going back to the game (we bought through the Play store when it was $0.10).<br /><br />It has fun graphics and gameplay is smooth, but it is sort of a one-trick pony.  Replay value comes from collecting stars / getting higher scores.  I'm just not a points person, I guess.<br /><br />I give four stars because my son loves the game, but as an adult I'm very 'meh'.
B00A9C3RNQ|1.0|Yes Streep and Tommy lee are excellent actors but............I wasnt pleased with some of the volgar overtones.Yes I relized it was pg13 but it is what it is. I dowmloaded it and wish there was a way I could sell it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I LOVE THE BIBLE ON MY KINDLE. IT IS SO EASY TO GET TO THE BOOK AND CHAPTER WHILE WATCHING MY KINDLE.  I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANY KINDLE OWNER.
B0092D1V5Y|1.0|This app dosn't really work  :( i dont know where to get a good wifi hacking app....if anyone knows any, my email is attilav@earthlink.net  Id apreciate it a lot.  :)
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Read for a book club. Was both discussion worthy and entertaining to read. I came into this already loving Tina Fey (from Weekend Update to 30 Rock) and nothing she said changed my mind. It's been awhile since I've read it but I still find myself referencing some of her anecdotes to friends (like cutting her daughter's nails before the nanny arrives to keep the peace).
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this game is fun funny some Bad words but somethings are boring you well love it is super fun and funny
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|Look, you know this already: If you're a fan of McFarlane, this is pretty much what you've come to expect from him. Is it funny? Yes. Does it get a little tedious? Yes, sometimes. Is it worth watching? Sure, if you have some time to kill and don't want to turn on your brain.<br /><br />Is it different from other McFarlane stuff like Family Guy? Nope. Not really. It's just more of McFarlane's humor in a less animated format. Whether or not that would appeal to you depends on your taste. In the end, I don't regret watching Ted, but I don't think I'd go out of my way to watch it again. It was a passable comedy for a boring day, and nothing more.
B00846WWVM|1.0|I desided to try this app and yup you guessed it. it froze my kindle had to restart it. needless to say I dumped it as soon as my kindle was up and running again. I did not give it a sec chance to mess things up again. do what ya want but beware
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I tend to disregard, for some reason, the books that the entire world adores. After multiple urgings from my mom, I finally decided to read The Hunger Games. For the next few days, it was all I could do. Waking up in the night to instantly think of Panem and Katniss, staying up hours after I'm normally asleep, sitting in the car devouring the words before I absolutely must go into work... I adored the journey: every laugh, every tear, every giddy/girly moment. It was one of those books you can't put down, you want to read slower, but you absorb the words so fast, that you look up and it's gone and you wonder what you're supposed to do with your life now...
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I love this show. It's so amazing and it draws you in from the get go. Hope it's around for a while.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|It is a fair quality translation of Victor Hugo's  novel.  The problem with it is that it has missing text.  You will see even on page one the missing letters in a word are filled in with dashes.  Of course the price, free, is right.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Loved it. Enjoyed how the characters moved forward, adapted, and changed. This season was well put together with so many things taken into consideration. Clearly lots of time was put into the zombies, making it seem believable that the sun, wind, rain had been hitting some of the corpses for over a year. Also, I appreciated the unexpected twist in the plot. Actors have done a good job of changing themselves into people that have now been on the run for a year,  numbed by their exposure to death. I like how theyve become a tight nit fighting unit, its clear that theyre an efficient team.
B0087DFIYA|4.0|WOW.  Gibson Hits the Mark once Again!<br />This is the Mel we are all used to.<br />As far as I am concerned he caught my attention and kept<br />it thru the entire Movie and never let me go.<br />Mel has gotten a lot of bad press in recent years some good<br />a lot Bad but this Movie should vindicate him as a Solid Actor.<br />I was Very Entertained by this Movie and look forward to More of Mel Soon.<br />Hopefully Mel has learned his lessons from his private life the<br />last few years and he will again shine<br />as the Great Actor he is.................<br /><br />Long Live the Road Warrior!!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Awesome book! I love the writing. Very reminiscent of Fitzgerald. The characters we rich and very life-like. It will keep you on the edge of your seat. Highly recommended.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|It's no Harry Potter, but it isn't bad either. I'd check out from the library rather than bother purchasing it though.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I have been hooked on this show since it began.<br />Being able to catch it here on Amazon when I miss it<br />is so handy !
B00633W614|4.0|Not as good as the first book, but Only Time Will Tell got me hooked on the Clifton Chronicles and I only hope the third book will make it all worthwhile.
B00B19DMUE|5.0|This movie is so scary it me and my granddaughter jumpinig out of our seats and I am going to look at it again tonight.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It gets you interested from the very begining of it. i could read it a thousand times :p awesome book!!!!!!!!!!!
B002NT3B52|5.0|This is a great book for any dog owner who has ever wondered what their dog is thinking.  Fun to read--made me laugh and cry.  As a scientist, I was sometimes disappointed with the weakness of certain explanations, but I think that has more to do with the current lack of scientific knowledge not the knowledge of the author.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I have been a Fringe fan from the beginning, not unexpected because I enjoy Sci-fi. After the season finished this year, I decided I needed to see it all over again with a new perspective. I am not disappointed. I recommend a try, even if you don't like Sci-fi. The characters are great!
B006QS07IK|5.0|My best friend loves Frankenstein, and she deserved a nice edition of it.  This copy was smooth and sleek and clean, and had just the right amount of darkness and class.  I was tempted to buy another for myself ^^;  It also came in very good quality, and on time.
B004JAUCQE|4.0|man, some of the best moments of my life (early teens skateboarding with friends) living off the vibe of bands such as D jr., bad relig1on and EARLY greenday (lookout records early) still love em...
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love this series and look forward to seeing others as they come along.  It is great for the whole family.
B0080M3OGW|5.0|It was a great movie.  Enjoyed it from start to finish  Meryl Streep and Robert De Niro are perfect together.
B00003CXRM|5.0|I HAD A SMALL PART AS AN EXTR IN THIS MOVIE SO I WANTED TO HAVE IT FOR A CONVERSATION PIECE AND FOR MY FRIENDS AND FAMILIES TO SEE.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|enjoying the graphics and sound. the hints are nice if you need them. wish they would wait a bit longer before they ask you to rate the game though.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|It was an ok read. Wasn't crazy about it. Some parts of it were boring, especially the begging of the book.
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|One of the best science fiction shows on TV. Since they didn't have the big budget of the movie, they had to rely on plot, and the 2nd season cliff hanger ending leaves you wanting more. I suppose it's too much to hope that it will get picked up and renewed since it's been gone so long though.
B004G600A4|5.0|The DVD arrived so quickly, I was very happy. The DVD case is in great shape, along with the DVD. It plays just fine!
0618001905|5.0|This book tells the true story of rubber farming in the Congo at the turn of the century.  The author does a wonderful job of being informative and artistic in delivering the story.  One of my favorite history books.
B000AAF1U4|5.0|I was very happy when this arrived. The DVD case is in good shape and so is the DVD. Plays great!
B00APJLX8E|5.0|Great kids movie, was very good story line. I think that this would be a great movie for the whole family.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I chose 5 stars because my 3 & 5 year old enjoyed playing this game. I didn't particularly like shooting the people in the science suits or whatever they were...but my boys enjoyed collecting coins so they could change the jetpacks and people.
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|This movie kept you on the edge of your seat the whole time. Was a great movie with great family qualities
B008NMT684|5.0|My 3 year old son enjoys doing puzzles, he will sit and keep doing the same one over and over. Now my 1 1/2 little cousin has tried it..she don't comprehend it just yet so I would say maybe recommending this for 3+
B00APUQPX6|5.0|Need I say more, these movies just get better and better each time. They are funny and kids can relate well to this movie.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|ooooh man this is a goood good game I need morphin for not to play it is an excellent game
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|Thought that this was not going to be very good, but turned out to be an excellent movie. The kids will love it.
B005HSL626|5.0|one of my favorite tablet games the full version has to be great, I cant download it yet but this version is very funny
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Need I say more, another great movie to this series. Christian Bale does an outstanding job as always. Would see this movie again

B0094BB4TW|5.0|I dont like facebook sorry but I download only for a mistake, so the people who like it can enjoy it
B009VB7QQA|5.0|Great movie would watch again. Don't know what it had to do with Abraham Lincoln but all in all was a great movie.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Lots of fun, some levels are frustrating but in a &quot;I'm going to play this dang game until I beat it&quot;, but at the dance time you realize you are having a lot of fun.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|This movie is very gripping and Denzel is a great actor. He saved many lives in this movie, had a great story line.
B001S86J0I|5.0|As I write this the online voting for Galaxy Quest is over 660, four or five star reviews, and exactly 20, one or two star reviews. It would appear that at least half of the one and two star reviews are not about the movie. This movie is not a guilty pleasure - it is a pleasure.<br /><br />On the odd chance that you have not seen Galaxy Quest and do not know anything about this movie Tim Allen as Jason Smith is the has-been actor of a now out of production but beloved by its nerdy fans, television science fiction show of the same name as this movie. He and his former costars - an unlikely collection that includes Sigourney Weaver, Alan Rickman (take that Harry Potter) and a thoroughly funny Tony Shalhoub(!)- are reduced to paying gigs at science fiction conventions and grocery store openings. The change-up happens when an alien race the Thermanains arrive and draft this team to command their exact mockup of the television spaceship in a life or death battle in a galaxy far away.<br /><br />The parody throughout includes many references to the Star Trek shows with a few asides to the well-known personality conflicts and inside issues among the performers in Star Trek series. Tim Allen is as usual the likable phony but he has such wonderful lines and an unintentional commanding presence.  Alan Rickman as the classically trained Shakespearean actor reduced to such silliness as \\" by Grabthar's Hammer\\" is brilliant. Sigourney Weaver as Gwen DeMarco :...\\" it serves no useful purpose for there to be a bunch of chompy, crushy things in the middle of a hallway. No, I mean we shouldn't have to do this, it makes no logical sense, why is it here?\\" Have not all of us wondered why there are choppy crushing things inside of science fiction engineering spaces?<br />At the risk of giving away secrets the ending includes a truly clever \\"revenge of the nerds\\".<br /><br />To those who will talk about obvious jokes and thin plot lines I have no answer. All I know is this is a fun movie. Relax enjoy your popcorn and try not to squirt soda out of your nose when you laugh.Relax enjoy your popcorn and try not to squirt soda out of your nose when you laugh.
B005LAIGJQ|3.0|Jack McCall (Eddie Murphy) is a literary agent who will do whatever it takes to make money. After a conversation with Dr. Sinja (Cliff Curtis), a magical tree appears in Jack's yard. With every word spoken a leaf falls. It will not be good for Jack if the tree becomes bare.<br /><br />\\"Don't talk for three days. How hard could it be?\\" Jack had to come up with ways to communicate in person and on the phone without words. Eddie Murphy is very good at using facial expressions and other body language to get points across. I don't think he was as funny as I've known him to be, though. There were parts that made me laugh a bit, but there were also parts I'm sure were supposed to be funny but didn't make me laugh. Everything that had to do with Jack's family life - those were the scenes (except the one in the hotel room) I liked best. Clark Duke did a good job; I liked his character best. And Murphy's performance near the end really touched me. I'd love to see him in more dramatic roles.<br /><br />When I saw the movie trailer a while back, my first thought was 'this movie has a New Age theme', but that didn't keep me from checking it out because as a Christian I know what I believe; not every movie I watch is Christian-based.<br /><br />Death - we all know it's going to happen one day, but many take life and other people for granted. A Thousand Words wasn't as entertaining as I thought it'd be, but this film gives viewers a few things to think about.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|I was curious about more details of this awful abduction. It was difficult to read because of the fact it is a true story. While I cannot say I enjoyed it, it was an interesting and disturbing recollection from a very strong young lady.

Absolutely one of the best books written regarding a true friendship with Michael...&#60;3<br />Thank you Michael Bush for truly being a friend to Michael and for writing such a wonderful book and for sharing all of those little inside stories and jokes, I really enjoyed it very much.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|This is angry birds for adults or math geeks. The trajectories needed are difficult and challenging. NOT something you can take lightly when you get into the death star series.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I absolutely love this product. It was processed and shipped to me in no time thanks to the amazon prime shipping. When first opening the package I was unsure of what to expect. The mouse's design is very ergonomic and fits well in my whole hand. I make use of all of the 9 buttons given. The ones located by the thumb are easily accessed by simply rolling your thumb to the desired button. As for the others you do need to move either your pointer or middle finger around. Also included with the mouse (installed via the website or driver) is software used to configure all of the mouse's 9 buttons. You can also save every profile you make, creating limitless configurations. Also included in the box is a set of 8 small weights. These are used, with the mouse, to create a heavier feel. You can add the weights as needed to meet your requirements. The cord itself also has this braided rope surrounding it creating a nice effect. Last, but not least the blue leds. I was more drawn to this mouse because of the color. I also found out after receiving it that the Ankor logo &#34;breathes&#34; and can be change to virtually any color. However, the click wheel and DPI indicators remain blue. The performance of the mouse overall is outstanding. I use it to play many games such as Bioshock or Skyrim, and with the software included I can reconfigure the buttons for each game. I am very satisfied and highly recommend this mouse.

B003L77FYS|5.0|Even though the plot is serious, the banter between the cop and the writer keeps it from being a typical cop drama.  All the characters are all written and have a lot of depth.
B00BN2CY7G|5.0|unlike many artists I grew up listening to, in many types of music, I was happy to hear Bon Jovi remain Bon Jovi, and not adapt to new artists techniques, or even change the messages he is trying to tell the listener on each record.  good job!

B00280LYHS|5.0|Great I loved every minute of it. You just can't put the book down!!! Can't wait for the next book!
B001N3GUIE|5.0|I grew up with this and other movies of the genre. As a child in the 1950's, Saturday matinee at the movies usually included a couple of science fiction features which we would &#34;act out&#34; later in the afternoon.  As an adult, one of the firstr movies I purchased on VHS tape was Forbidden Planet.  Although the acting and dialogue are a little &#34;hoakie&#34; at times, the special effects (provided by the Disney Studios) and the plot (supposededly based on Shakespeare's &#34;The Temest&#34;) are well done.  Many people feel that this movie laid the foundation for the StarTrek series and other science fiction films to follow. If you are a scifi fan like me, this movie is a &#34;must&#34; for your DVD collection.  In fact, I still have a copy on Laserdisk!
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Engaging. Progressively more difficult. Easy to learn, yet challenging. Clean, easy to operate controls. Not just functional, but also beautiful.
B008LFY6NI|1.0|This software is outrageously expensive.  You have to purchase a new page for $.99 each time you do a drawing.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|I am a Michael Jackson fan.  I love all of his music.  Can't go wrong with this collection.  Very happy with it.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Even though I can't play online, the campaign is pretty fun. Still trying to figure out the online problem it's a really great game worth getting. It will kinda remind u of COD: Black Ops 2. NEED TO GET THIS GAME!!
B000F1IQNM|5.0|Purchased this movie for my 6 year old grand daughter. We have a few \\"good movies\\" we watch together and I consider this one one of them. Movie came in a very timely manner and in excellent condition. I am ALWAYS satisfied with anything I purchase from Amazon. Of course as most of us do, I read the reviews on EVERYTHING I purchase BEFORE I make a purchasing decision-GREAT JOB AGAIN AMAZON!!!
B000V1Z8KK|4.0|This movie only barely shares a basic outline with the book. If you've read the book and loved it like I did, I highly recommend going in thinking of this as a completely different thing that has nothing to do with the book. On my second viewing, when I did exactly what I advise, I really enjoyed myself. Shooter is not going to keep you guessing but it will make you cheer for Mark Wahlberg's character. The action is well done and not completely over the top. If you like Mark Wahlberg and/or sniper/military action movies, you really should give Shooter a go.
B005HSL626|5.0|my grand kids love this game - good for any age - even the younger ones. I would recommend it.
B0050CQY1W|4.0|This is a great album by Mrs. Carter. Every album that she does she gives it a different vibe, a vibe that you can groove to , sing to and dance to. She doesn't disappoint.
B004S3MB2U|5.0|this is the best calculator I have used on my celphone, almost better than a real one, it worth the price and as a Amazon free app of the day it was a steal.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Colorful and interesting! I love all of the graphics. Wish that I could get more coins at an even faster pace.
B006ZPAVUS|5.0|If you are a Maiden fan you must have it! A great live album, a great vinyl edition!!! Maiden Rules!!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I've always wanted a horse and this game teaches me how to work with horses what to do with them and how to compete. I also learned to help others out when you go to their barn and clean their barn and feed the horse...<br /><br />From mazerlayne<br />To players
1419701533|5.0|Our kids and our neighborhood kids all love these books!  Even parents lol at times!  Great to buy as a collection!
B004XGN8W4|4.0|I bought this for an off label use as a mobile desktop Mac mini monitor. It works but the resolution leaves something to be desired. I would not buy it again for that. Yet 4/5 as it did look great with my PS3 and I think it would be worth it for that. Still it need 1080p but the 720 looked good for PS3 but not for my mac.
B009O5CLZY|5.0|I love this game you get to be on a wolf a snowmobile and a Penguin I hope you like this as much as I do
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|this game is creative and fun. original game mechanics. it takes skill and fineness to win. the graphics look berry pretty. its a simple game but Osmos is crazy fun to play.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is very fun to play because you get to play games but first you have to earn coins to get the games you want it is really fun you should get it
B004RVCIEO|5.0|was never really into even trying Interpol, but a friend knew I love SWR and suggested it... best suggestion all year
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Great music simple premise and super addictive! Highly suggest playing this unique game! Can't wait for more updates or expansions
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It works good enough were I could use it for my everyday life and works still  today and hasn't given me any trouble.
B0039TAHMA|4.0|A little too much blood and guts, but still a fine production, following the original story as told by author Tolkien.
B002ISID10|5.0|It works good enough were I could use it for my everyday life and works still  today and hasn't given me any trouble.
B000MTPANQ|4.0|The performance on the disc sounds wonderful. It amazes me to hear Neil introduce old classics as &#34;new songs&#34; that fans haven't heard yet. The video included is actually not of the same performance, but ultimately, it doesn't matter - someone took great care to match up the performance flawlessly (the footage is grainy and stylized, but it's still Neil Young when he actually WAS young) - although the parts that do not have corresponding footage have some clips of stage equipment and some old footage... I put it on at a party and the Neil Young fans were astounded by it.<br /><br />For the fan, you'll love it, although some of his chit chat between the songs is a little pointless, so I actually did a little editing to my copy of it.
B008HK3XOU|4.0|I like the cover but it's not exactly as I expected  I liked my cover for my first kindle better.<br />Somewhat different feel and movements.<br />Janedwards
B00AA0U046|1.0|With all of the hype extended to this \\"new\\" album by Jimi Hendrix; this was disappointing to say the least! It sounds like Jimi was just jamming with these other musicians with no real intent to have these tracks released in such an \\"Unpolished\\" state.<br /><br />Anyone giving this more than \\"1\\" star should really go back and listen to his \\"Polished Guitar Work\\" and Songs on other albums.<br /><br />BIG - BIG Disappointment and another $10 bucks escapes my wallet to the Hollywood elite!
B00B4VXQC8|4.0|Not a great album,as there aren't much anymore and not a bad album. Pretty much in the middle more toward the latter. I've been a BJ fan since the beginning and have seen welcome changes and have grown with the band.If they sounded on every album like Slippery When Wet,we all know they would have been gone years ago.A Slippery When Wet 2 wouldn't work either.They are in a class by themeselves,do what they want and if you don't like it,well...To me the album is solid with the soft to moderate rockers and ballads,which BJ has been doing since the beginning.I will be there to the end and apparently those who continue to bash Bon Jovi,are still there too.If you have grown with the changes there is no reason to stop here.It is a good album and will find a place in your Bon Jovi rockin' heart...  Aloha!!!!
B0026NWBY2|3.0|Don't be fooled when you see the term 'Re-Mastered' listed for any collection.  What is the source material and how loud was it recorded?  In this instance it was recorded way too loud and the sound is lacking very much.  Just google \\"Loudness Wars\\" and you'll understand what I'm talking about if you are not familiar with this. I would give it one star for the sound and five stars for the content, thus an average of three.
B007MCTTHY|4.0|It is quite simple to learn how to play the game.<br />The game is also fun.and have several levels to challenge you
B000OVLBIU|4.0|This is a pretty decent take on the Ghost Rider, great visual effects solid story and Sam Eliott give this some life
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was great!! Fifty shades Darker could be a movie by itself .Full of excitement and intrigue. A good transition from book one .
0345529057|5.0|These books are great reads for Fantasy lover. Just be aware many of the characters are young and depicted in situations most adults would have problems with.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Super fun game. Can be very difficult as the game progresses, but very entertaining. Highly recommend this game to anyone.
B004EC5IUW|5.0|So far the retelling of one of Animes greatest stories is awesome to behold. All the characters from the original Anime and everything you expect Evangelion to be.
B0030Y10QQ|5.0|Fantastic Group, Fantastic Musicians,Great song writing,Terrific singers who can sing hard songs perfectly,Always on time with there music, Great sounding CD!! Get my drift, Just get it and lay back and enjoy!
B002BWP49M|3.0|If you can get over some of the bad character acting, someone should punch the director in the head for not demanding more out of the actors, you may enjoy this because the actors are &#34;pretty&#34;.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Super show!!!!  Every episode is great, excellent writing and acting!  Don't want it to ever end.  Seasons just get better and better.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|Another cool film that portrays a girls desire to be free of an insane asylum who uses her imagination while dancing to achieve her goals, it doesn't hurt that all the actresses are beautiful either.
0316067938|5.0|loved it loved it loved it. i absolutely loved this book<br />i even went on to sharing it with my family and friends
B0042MDAL8|3.0|If you can get over some of the bad character acting, someone should punch the director in the head for not demanding more out of the actors, you may enjoy this because the actors are &#34;pretty&#34;.
B004TI5N38|5.0|I couldn't put it down once I started. Would recommend it to all suspense lovers.  It was a great read. That's all I want to say.
B004P9FAK2|5.0|Love Harry Potter, been with it since the books first began. Great Extras Discs which go back and reviewd all 8 films with fresh perspectives from the actors and crew, just a must for any Potter fan who can't afford the edition with all 8 films.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|iT WAS A BORING READ AND I DIDN'T FINISH THE BOOK. HE SAYS THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AND DOEN'T GIVE MUCH DESCRIPTION OF WHAT HE SAW AND EXPERIENCED ON THE OTHER SIDE. I DIDN'T LIKE IT.
B005LAIGWS|3.0|If you like Ghost Rider this movie is okay, if you Love Ghost Rider this movie may very well piss you off, while the effects were cool the story was less than stellar and the animation of Ghost Riders face SUCKED!
B00AA0TZTW|4.0|For an extra dollar or two get this from Target (extra 20 minutes)- that is if you have already decided to get it.<br /><br />You want this if your a blues fan, if you buy everything you can find that is a proper Jimi Hendrix CD<br />(no doubt there are a few to avoid - but this is not one of those).<br /><br />2 tracks that Jimi plays on (not sings) are decent songs and you don't need to track them down elsewhere...
B0052REUW0|5.0|With all the shrill and strident news reporting today it is easy to get the notion that the world is going in a very  bad direction. Turns out, though, that the good old days weren't that good at all, and we are much nicer to each other than we used to be. Who knew? Highly recommended read.
B00B23O96A|2.0|Time to pack it in Eric.  You've got nothing to prove anymore.  Albums like this won't help your formidable career and reputation. Go out with some class.
B00AVPYT8I|5.0|better then going out to the library .I just love to sit back and read  especiay since I have a bad foot ,
B003PDQEBS|5.0|Colin Firth is such a wonderful actor and he fufilled his role in the script to a tee.  I could really feel his pain and it broke my heart.
B00957T6X6|5.0|its hard to put into words ,if your a reader, then this is totally amazing. it has to be the best one to come out in years
B0063GORYU|5.0|I like to play spider on my computer.  When I Saw the app down load, I downloaded it.  I play it a lot while am watching the television. Good app!
B005ZMUQCK|5.0|Bought digital copy. Love that I can watch through TV with Roku, laptop & IPad. Kids love it & so do adults.
B0095P3ULC|5.0|great movie; great graphics!  Plot a little weak, but still entertaining. cannot think of nine more words. Wow! three more!
B00865P3AS|5.0|saw them on tv.  LOVE THE CD!  got one for my son who begged for it too.  saw them on Glee tv show
B0094K1MH2|4.0|Great avatar animation!  The future of cinema!  The actors will never age; never die!  six more words!  Why, Why, Why???
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|My 10 year old has told me several times that she loves this book. I'm thrilled because she isn't a big reader.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|If you are looking for a love romance, a story about a female who finally takes a stand for herself and starts her life over, this is the book for you.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I heard it was good but I didn't expect it to be this good. Best money I've spent on music this year!
B008LV05EG|5.0|I downloaded a copy of ths cd back in december 2012 and I have been bumpin it ever since. Yes \\"facemelt\\" and \\"radioactive\\" are the standout tracks but my recent two faves are \\"Young, Single & Sexy\\" and \\"Meet Ya\\". Other notables include \\"RIP\\", \\"Hot Right Now\\", \\"Roc The Life\\" and \\"Shine Ya Light\\".....whoh-oh-oh, shine your light. Why isn't she released in the US? I dunno(ask Jay Z). Her mezzo-soprano voice is very sexy and great to sing along with. I swear this girl rocks!!!!
0140157352|4.0|If you negotiate a lot, this book is really very helpful.  People reference this book on a regular basis and I'm glad I read it.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|This is THE book to get. Parents and teens fight over who can read it first. Just make sure you have read Matched first. :) kay.bye!;)
B002PEP4SC|4.0|Much better than the Storm series of books. Not sure when you look for the author the picture of Nathan Filion shows up. I know it is based on the TV series but who really wrote the books?
B009FZHYKU|5.0|acting, plot, script, development of the characters is genuine and pulls you in. they all seem to be very talented actors.
B0002E5O9G|5.0|Wilkison at his finest and as a long time fan of this telling of the story I feel musically this was the best. I have seen it live 6 times and 2 times with Wilkinson. The 25th Anniversary had some great additions.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|The movie is somewhat slow in the beginning as they build the story, but it has you on the edge of your seat for the last third.  The one-liners are continuous and good throughout the movie.  There is a noticeable amount of swearing in the movie which I missed the first time because I was so into the plot line.  A friend pointed it out later so I watched for it when I saw the movie the second/third times.  The fact that it is based on a historical event in our lifetimes makes it that more intense knowing these people actually went through this trauma.
B007B6VOG0|4.0|I've really enjoyed this album by Fun. It takes me back to years ago when I was younger and could do anything.
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|It was a powerful story, as it claims, but it wasn't what I thought it would be.  If I'd know what the story was, I would not have bought the movie.  I love watching Denzel Washington act and the excitement of the plane crash and how he saved it were a big draw, but the ongoing personal story of his character was a let down.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This was a really enjoyable game.  The graphics and story line were awesome!  If you like a challenge this definitely a good buy.
B007REV4YI|4.0|It wasn't one of my favorite Bond movies, but I still enjoyed it and have watched it a couple of times.  It is interesting when you find out what Skyfall stands for.  I also liked that they continue to return to the more traditional Bond intro.
B004GJXQ20|5.0|Recommended this book by my grandson,  and I found it really good particularly the descriptive writing it brought everything to life.
B0038P59A0|3.0|It was ok. I enjoyed the characters and the story line but it didn't grab me and hold my attention completely.  I will see the sequal though.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Good story line keeps your interest will watch the rest of the season when it comes out or will give in and buy for my grandson lol
B008Y212PI|5.0|I love these games.  Hope more are soon on the way.  I've played just about all and concur with one of the reviewers that Simple Pleasures is a good game to start off with if trying for the first time.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|Holds your attention. Grabs your heart and takes you into the lives of these very real people. I have an adopted daughter. This book is real!
030758836X|3.0|I loved this book until the end. There was an amazing climax and the end just didn't live up to what I expected. After I finished the book I read reviews and saw that people had the same disappointment with the end that I did.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|Very helpful and I have already referred this book yo others blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
B002OUT604|5.0|Ok, it's The Princess Bride. What do you expect me to say. The soundtrack is sweet and tender when it needs to be and dramatic in other places. Stop reading these words and go watch the movie.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Loved the movie before even ordering this, already had a blu-ray copy but wanted a dvd and blu-ray combo to have on trips where I don't have a blu-ray player.
B0000DZTIW|5.0|If John Williams is the king of film composers, Hans Zimmer has to be the prince. The Last Samurai is one of the instances where he keeps the music subdued for most of the film, which fits the situation quite well.
B007REV4T8|5.0|I have to say that I used to love Bond movies, but then it seemed that they consisted of some kind of explosion or crash in one scene and then the bedroom scene repeat ad nauseum.  He morphed into some kind of sex manic super hero - rarely scratched or hurt for long, and nothing that some time in bed with obligatory handy female couldn't fix, no character development of any kind.<br /><br />Because of that, my husband had to convince me to watch the two previous movies in which Daniel Craig starred as Bond before I would commit to a date night to view Skyfall.  When I finally watched them, I was totally hooked. Daniel Craig, in my opinion, is one of the best actors to play the role.  He's intense, he's real, he gets hurt and it's obvious; there are plenty of action scenes, explosions, and lovely leading ladies, but he comes across as much more believable and yet still totally Bond.<br /><br />We went to the theatre to watch this the first time and it was amazing!  I bought this for my dh for a gift for, of all things, Valentine's Day, because we both enjoy this movie and this actor so very much.  It's got the action for those who MUST see something blown up; the bad guy who has a veneer of normalcy but is chillingly scary because of it - he's over-the-top bad but in a subtle way, if that makes sense; a Bond who plays the part well and is a real, developed main character with emotions; and breath taking scenery that is raw and achingly beautiful.  Ms. Moneypenny is a bit of a surprise, but not necessarily in a bad way, and M is also a true, developed character with emotions as well.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
0307949508|5.0|It's 700 pages long, but it flies by like nothing else. Lisbeth is one of the most original characters I've ever had the pleasure of reading about. The plot continually surprised me as well. Word of warning though, do not read the back page or description of the book as it ruins a plot point. This book is labeled as an Adult Novel for a reason. It's violent, sexually explicit in some parts, and Lisbeth is rather profane. But, if you can deal with that, it all adds to the drama.
0765325950|1.0|Delaying the release of a digital copy of a book in order to sell more hard copies is appalling.  I won't be purchasing ANY copies of this book, I'll just borrow it.  Robert Jordan's wife wants to maintain her husbands legacy by forcing hard cover sales in order to ensure the book makes the top of the charts.  What about the negative legacy cast now within the fan base?  Idiocy.
B00005O3VC|5.0|Seriously, who hasn't seen this movie. Buy it now and stop reading this. Stop that right now! There'll be none of that while I'm here.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|this show is fantastic, characters are all so well developed. i started it on Netflix and ended up buying the second season on Amazon unbox because I was so addicted. I am even watching it again this week now that I am all caught up. Robert Carlyle really gives one of the most brilliant villain performances I have ever seen.
B0049GYXDG|5.0|It is a classic so it's a must have for our collection. Story line is boring, whoever did the voice of Alice has the most soothing voice to ever hear. Falling asleep to that voice is not a challenge.
B00APPJELG|5.0|This is the PERFECT recap of the first two seasons of Downton! Spiced with clips of script, music and scenes that offer not only who the characters are and a summary, but the intrigue and humor as well. All in a fast moving &#34;nutshell&#34;! Nice job!
B005BCE7FQ|5.0|Concept of the movie is a bit boring. Story line is alright, although I really do enjoy the music/ soundtrack of this movie.
B0085Y4JF0|4.0|This is a really good rig for the money. I wouldn't depend on it in combat but it is good for a range day or a little running and gunning. I was worried about the fact that the mag pouches were sewn in, but I always run my rigs that way anyway. So far it is sturdy, and the stitching is holding up well. It also has ALOT of adjustment. The hook and loop fasteners on the webbing are a nice way to roll up and secure the slack. There was also plenty of room for me to add an admin pouch and an IFAK. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a solid rig at a low price.
B003DZX44I|5.0|Another must have as a Disney Movie Collector. I love the story line it make you think that life can be magical in perspective of a child of course.Plus ever since they watch this movie they think reading is cool.
B009IEXKXI|3.0|gets a little slow at the endgets a little slow at the endgets a little slow at the endgets a little slow at the end
B00005JLEU|5.0|I think this is THE BEST movie that Hayao Miyazaki ever made. None of his other movies are even in the same level as this one. So much creative imagination at work. Movie keeps on amazes you in ever scene.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I always hesitate when purchasing a Nicholas Sparks book because they all follow the same 'template' of a Sparks romance, this book being no exception. But I enjoyed the book and flew through it (needed something light after reading 600 Hours of Edward). It's like a G-Rated version of Gone Girl. A definite 'beach' read that lacks strong character development, leaving nothing up to thoughtful interpretation but still somehow leaves you hanging at times. I was pleasantly surprised at the twist in the end. I am glad to have read it and now feel ready for a more complicated story. You've done it again Sparks.
B0013ND30M|5.0|It is a must have for all Disney Movie Collectors. I don't think it's the best movie from early disney, I think it's a bit boring. Although it's pretty fun to see the early princess works of Walt Disney.
B00846WWVM|5.0|I just love this wonderful little puzzle game. I couldn't stop playing! The graphics are adorable and the puzzles are mind-ful. Each one getting harder to work that grey matter. Fun for all ages.
B002APU580|1.0|If you're a fan of the book, go watch the BBC mini series.  Don't put yourself through this.  If you don't care that it's a very liberal interpretation of a great novel, then go for it.  Ms. Knightly doesn't have what it takes to pull off Miss Bennet.  The only casting that I find I liked was Mr. Darcy.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|Saw it at IMAX, needed to see it again.  Caught some info that I missed at the cinema.  Enjoyable movie.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|If you don't love all the works of Joss Whedon, you might want to look away... but if you're like me, nothing finishes the collection like Serenity.  Fellow Browncoats disagree on whether or not to resign to never getting a Firefly reboot, but I feel this at least gives something very substantial to love in the wake of Fox's sudden but inevitable betrayal.  Watch and enjoy, watch it in the background while you partake in your favorite activities, like D&D (Firefly campaign, of course), WoW, and looking up pictures of David Boreanaz without a shirt on, at least that's what I do!  And don't judge, I mean, some people juggle geese!
1400069289|5.0|The item was received by the person . She is going off to college and she liked it.good book to give.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Even though you know the outcome going in, this movie doesn't stop delivering gripping suspense and edge of yourself drama.  Great flick, stellar cast, and plausible plot line.  Would recommend to anyone!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I enjoyed the book. The way Megan didn't just accept things, but demanded a real relationship was priceless. No matter what stand your ground.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|One of my favorite TV series! Interesting and fun!! Kids love it too. You should try it if you like science fiction.
B007QDNKQA|3.0|Typical Mark Wahlberg &#34;spy, agent, Bourne&#34; type movie - car chases, shoot-em ups, crooked government workers.  Why is everyone always out to get poor Mark?  He's a good guy who always manages to get himself involved with government bad guys who use him and then want to kill him.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love having accu weather on my tablet.  It provides the current temp upon turning my unit on.  Fast and convenient.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|INTO THE DARKEST CORNER reminded me of a slow burn, of holding my marshmallow an inch or two above the campfire, the flames licking and dancing but never quite touching that puffy goodness. But minus the gooey center and the warm, fuzzy feeling that a sugar rush gives you. Instead, this novel has a bitter aftertaste that leaves you wanting to down shots of Jose Cuervo to take away the burn. To be honest, it kind of creeped me out, like a whisper just behind my left ear with nary a hint of a mouth or an individual to explain the voice I heard.<br /><br />I understood Cathy's character, but I couldn't really identify with her. Rather than seeking out help or even fully recognizing her emotional disorder, she chooses to bury it and attempt to move on with her life, but she seems to fail somewhat miserably in her effort. I wrote those two sentences about a quarter of the way through the novel and before I completely understood her character. Needless to say, I'm willing to admit how wrong I was. She's a freaking trooper, and four years later she's lucky to be walking the Earth, all trust issues, anxiety, and OCD aside.<br /><br />She may have to check a lock six times but it's what helps her push through, to make it from one moment to the next, even if those moments turn into hours, and she has to repeat the process three or four times to help her feel truly safe. Catherine Bailey may have been a twenty-four year old carefree, fun-loving individual, but Cathy Bailey is one tough, yet emotionally damaged woman, and she's not going down without a fight.<br /><br />I had a hard time understanding that woman. You know, the one that stays in a relationship even when it starts going horribly wrong, and the boyfriend/husband/lover suddenly turns into a wife beating, knife yielding maniac who carves up his beloved like she's some kind of Christmas ham. After reading this novel, I understand the dynamics of that particular relationship a bit better. And it kind of freaks me out.<br /><br />Robert Downs<br />Author of Falling Immortality: Casey Holden, Private Investigator<br /><br />Robert Downs<br />Author of Falling Immortality: Casey Holden, Private Investigator

B0094BB4TW|4.0|I like Facebook because it makes me an active part in the lives and interests of family and friends.  It becomes an immediate connection either general or personal.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|Lately I've been reading just trilogies and this one did not let me down!  I thought the suspense, drama, and plot  were always exciting.  I will now try other books by James Dashner.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|I like it because it gives immediate contact with the people that I choose to follow.  I need to work on its language.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I had high expectations for 'Gone Girl' because of the the positive reviews I heard from others.  I was bored in the beginning of the book, and then I became more interested, but then the ending let me down.
B001NHNG64|5.0|I loved the first Jack Reacher novel, which was written in the first person - the internal dialogue was a lot of fun.  But I actually like the new format in #2...which adds much more depth to the plot lines and character developements.  Die Trying is full of action right from the start...and Reacher's deductive reasoning is once again the strength of this series...fun fun read!
B00A6PD8RQ|3.0|My daughter loved the movie until her mother was turned into a bear by a witch. If your child is scared of witches beware!

B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This app is a beautiful symbolic relationship of the way the universe works on a small and large scale.<br />Highly recommend.
B00BLGZDYA|1.0|I was so excited to see this movie that I bought it.  What a mistake!  I love weird and artistic movies but this was just awful.  The plot is ridiculous and pretentious.  I became bored about 30 minutes in but kept watching for something more....it never came.  The only way it is thought provoking is because you find yourself trying to make up a plot and a reason to justify the last two hours that you wasted of your life.  You watch someone put on costumes and act out different lives- the end!  It never really comes together as a whole.
B003UBTX6S|3.0|I read the book with anticipation of it being the equal to Twilight for riveting tale of twists and turns in the fantasy world similar to the emotional ups and downs of Twilight. Although this is an interesting fictional tale about witches and other supernatural fantasy creatures. The plot pulled me along but didn't keep me up all night at the edge of my seat to finish the series.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I love this case. It helps to protect my Kindle Fire and it is easy to hang onto and prop up to read or play games and it looks really nice too.  Glad I bought it.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I'm a fan. Thrift Shop is a fun song, but the rest of the album has a lot of purpose. As a Mariners fan growing up, I get chills listening to My Oh My
1439190275|5.0|I have followed so many diets in the past, including the recent low-fat in the past couple of years and actually GAINED weight on the low-fat diet.  Knowing carbs was the problem (I was taking in 10-15 lb of sugar a week...read the labels for low-fat...sugar! Plus sugar in coffee, etc...it adds up!) and seeing others had good results from it, I decided to try the Atkins diet.  I was a little afraid from all of the media, but seeing how the people around me had a nice lifestyle change and maintained their weight for several years (with no health problems), I decided to give it a try.  Atkins is definitely better than what you hear about.  In 3 weeks, I feel better than ever...I have way more energy (I am almost 40 and feel 20 again), I sleep better, I'm losing inches (my clothes are hanging on me...baggy), I've lost 10-15 lb (probably mostly water weight), my mood is so much better, and I'm never hungry!  I am so glad I started I purchased the Atkins books and began this lifestyle change!

B0034G4P80|5.0|Great special effects. Cool customs. I do not know what they got against full screen, but they should have both. This would have been great in full screen, because sometimes the head gets cut off in the picture.

0060594896|5.0|Jack Canfield's writing is so easy to read and understand; I couldn't put this book down! Each chapter is loaded with life altering information...a must read for individual's that truly want to succeed in life!
B004GHNIRK|4.0|No intellectual prodigy here.  Just a guy who reads a historical novel once in a while; Kenneth Roberts and other novels with historically accurate settings and events.  That's what drew me to this book: history.  And, I got a little more than bargained for.<br /><br />I don't know as I've ever tackled a work that requires such intense focus, (maybe Michener's \\"Hawaii\\").  I had to re-start Les Miserables seven times before getting 'into' it.  And, that's what you have to do with this:  get INTO it.  It's like the Rubiks cube of literature for the first several days chasing down dates and French history.  After that, (I haven't finished the book yet), things get more introspective: you WILL be touched.<br /><br />Knowing a little more now than when I started, I really think that the digital format of this particular book is not the way to go.  The price is right,(it was my first experience with a digital book downloaded to my Galaxy).  But, there's just something about looking back on a half-inch-thick block of pages and remembering where you've been and knowing what's there. The sight of moving forward seems to help track the memory of the characters and events.<br /><br />I'll be buying a hard copy soon.
B0081336FO|4.0|I love the show and highly recommend it. I think this is better than the American version (which is also good).
B0058YZ21K|4.0|This shoe crushes the top of my foot just above the base of the toes and requires a lot of brief wearing for a gentle break in.  Now I can run in them - three or four miles typical, but I still can't walk more than short distances because the toe flexes more when walking and crushes my foot.  That said, now they do what I wanted them to do for winter running shoe - keep the water out in near freezing wet conditions and wet snow while remaining fairly close to minimalist.  Wearing wool socks, by feet stay pretty warm and dry now, whereas with the summer type minimalist shoes my feet would often get numb while running in bad conditions.  For a great minimalist shoe, try the recently introduced Merrell Vapor Glove - it requires no break in and is truely minimalist.  The quality of the Merrel shoes is great, but I am a bit dissapointed in this one in that it is still not really &#34;broken in&#34;.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I love it ; its awesome and I really helps on getting ready to go to work. so far it hasn't made me late
B000JML90Y|5.0|Interesting book. Everybody has something to say about evolution, the official State religion, and about Darwin and this book. But the book isn't read by those who claim it's revelations.<br /><br />Was Darwin trying to start a religion, was he an Atheist with an ax to grind? Was he an angry ranting story spinner like Dawkins? Was Darwin an honest seeker?  How would Darwin digest the science of DNA learning that the codes of life are chemical libraries of digital information 100 years after he had his idea? Does a digital code of information for life form from an explosion? What would he say about that? Was he a man that sought the truth or a man trying to promote an agenda? Did Darwin profess that his idea was truth? Would he endorse or correct the emphatic dogmatism of today's evolution 150 years later in the light of real science and the math of probabilities. I give it 5 stars because people should read for themselves what the State religion is built on and decide for themselves. The State should not be allowed to pick and choose a religion and mandate that it be taught in every school nor should it be called science as it is in CA. Is The Origin of the Species read in schools?<br /><br />Evolution is and will always be a controversy for the obvious reason of the desire and therefore the need to exclude God from a philosophy of life. Replacing the Creator with other gods is as old as history. Evolution is relatively new to history but sorely lacking for the purpose for which it is advertised. It's worn out and needs to be replaced. The questions it can't answer are legion, basic and ignored. What does Charles have to say...really?<br /><br />A new endorsement touted from the pinnacles of global authority is about to be unveiled. It will be believable by all, including 90% or so of those identifying themselves as Christian. Scientists and professors and politicians and big businesses, like Merk and Monsanto and Walmart and the White House, will ring in and sell themselves with it much as they do with selling and promoting \\"green\\". These people will all stand and explain that they have had certain problems with evolution for a long time but that now, the entire world is on board in unity for the first time since the Tower of Bable. ( They won't mention the Tower of Bable). They will say, \\"We have a future and we have confidence in the peace that this new paradigm will bring.\\" Evolution will be instantly unpopular and the King will get another new suit. You should really know what your \\"good book\\" says, whatever your \\"good book\\" is. If Evolution is your explanation for who and what you are and you are settled about the idea of what happens to you when you die, etc., etc., at least read your \\"good book.\\"
B00B2PHSIY|4.0|Bought this for my husbands Hero3. It worked great and after some experimentation with and without he was very happy with it ... thats until he inadvertantly dropped the camera with it on( from hand held height). The GoPro and case were undamaged but one of the very small holders broke off the red filter and despite the damage being very slight, it no longer clipped on securely.<br /><br />So I would say, great product but its certainly not as durable as the GoPro so treat it very carefully. Maybe even consider a small amount of tape around it the exterior to give it more durability and prevent similar happening to you.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I can not wait for season 4. Best show ever! I just wish the season was longer and I could watch one every Sunday the whole year.

B00BQPEIT2|5.0|It is full of action and the graphics are amazing. No problems as yet unlike Temple Run Brave, which loses the background music after the first wipeout. This happened on my iPhone and iPad, but not on my husband's Kindle.
B00006CXSS|5.0|If you love war series, this is the one for you!  It really takes you into the battlefield and what all of the soldiers go through during time of war.  I highly recommend.

B00BBRPRDG|5.0|This is one of Poco's best..a diverse, well done performance by the country rockers. Some humor, some<br />slow ones with great harmony, and some rockers..a band established in 1968 still putting out great stuff!

0553801473|4.0|After the publication of five massive tomes and two seasons of an HBO series based on his books, I think it's tough for anyone who is a fan of fantasy fiction to be unaware of George R. R. Martin's series, A Song of Ice and Fire. A Dance with Dragons is the long-awaited fifth installment in the book series, and finally brings back those favorite characters missing in the previous volume.<br /><br />If you haven't read through A Storm of Swords (book three), then just beware that this review may contain spoilers for you. Anyone who has only watched the television series will be lost. In A Feast for Crows (book four), Martin continued his technique of rotating through different point-of-view characters on a chapter-by-chapter basis. However, some notable characters had been left out. Whether you agreed with this decision (as explained in an afterward to book four) or not, the absence of Daenerys, Tyrion, and Jon Snow rankled with many fans. Although this new volume returns to those characters, the events overlap with the timeline from book four, creating some d&eacute;j&agrave; vu as news spreads across Westeros and beyond.<br /><br />Tyrion Lannister's whereabouts have been a mystery, as he is one of the most wanted and recognizable men in Westeros. Accused of murdering Joffrey at his wedding, the Imp has also slain his father and vanished from King's Landing. In the opening of book five, he turns up in the free city of Pentos with Magister Illyrio Mopatis, who had helped sell Daenerys to the Dothraki in book one. Illyrio's motives are mysterious, but he convinces Tyrion that drowning himself in alcohol is not a worthwhile profession for someone as intelligent as the black sheep of the Lannisters. Tyrion heads toward Volantis with a group of mysterious companions, presumably to team up with Daenerys and her cadre of dragons.<br /><br />Daenerys Targaryen sits ensconced as queen of the slaver city of Meereen. Her dragons have grown and cannot be trusted to roam free. She is threatened by armies from neighboring cities, as well as murderous rebels within Meereen's own population. Despite her original intent to return to Westeros to claim the Iron Throne as the Targaryen heir, she becomes bogged down by the machinations of numerous councilors, shady politics, and her own uncertainties.<br /><br />In the north, Jon Snow guards the wall against the dark threat of wights and beasts of legend. He is also swamped by his newfound responsibilities, but deals with them more decisively than Daenerys. Surrounded by wilding prisoners, insubordination among his own men, and demands from Stannis Baratheon, Jon Snow makes his decisions and stands by them.<br /><br />Like the previous books, there are so many major characters that if I try to count them I know I'll leave someone out. Bran travels with Jojen and Meera Reed, looking for more information about his dreams. Quentyn Martell, heir to Dorne, has a secret proposal for Daenerys. The Iron Fleet is on the move, but Asha Greyjoy has fled after her failed bid for the Seastone Chair. Davos Seaworth smuggles himself again. Jaime Lannister travels around a bit, flashing his golden hand and forging peace in the Riverlands. Arya Stark appears briefly, moving on to the next stage of her training, and Cersei Lannister must finally face some consequences for her actions.<br /><br />Despite the length of this volume, you won't see Samwell Tarly, Rickon or Osha, Sansa Stark, Littlefinger, or Brienne in this one.<br /><br />One of the most interesting perspectives in this book comes from Theon Greyjoy. No, he's not dead. But after we learn what he has been through, it would have been kinder if he had been slain. As disturbing as some of his scenes are, I was fascinated to read his interactions with his captor. I have also found someone to hate more than I did Joffrey, and that's a feat.<br /><br />I thought that the pacing of book four dragged, so A Dance With Dragons is exciting in comparison. However,the dragons play only a minor role and nothing that happens in this book can top the events in the second half of A Storm of Swords. Still, the world is as richly drawn as all of Martin's writing, and the story expands to cover a larger geographical area as well as pulling in more characters.<br /><br />The most intricate plot twists and shocking events occur in the north of Westeros. Unfortunately most of the characters in the rest of the world spend the entire time traveling with little resolution to their story arcs. I was also disappointed in Daenerys because I just can't make myself care about the plight of the slaver cities and all of her entourage. It's time for her to ride a dragon to Westeros, already!<br /><br />For fear of sounding too critical, I just need to say that this is still a great book. The characters are phenomenal and the writing is better than almost anything else out there. If you loved A Storm of Swords and felt let down by A Feast for Crows, A Dance with Dragons takes the series and reinvigorates it with newfound direction and hints at the fire and darkness to come.the dragons play only a minor role and nothing that happens in this book can top the events in the second half of A Storm of Swords.

1400069807|5.0|This book is amazingly well-researched and well-written. It is a call to national action to reverse our steady fall into obesity and ill health because of the irresponsibility and political muscle of the food industry. Michael Moss is a modern muckraker in the tradition of Upton Sinclair and Lincoln Steffans. Hopefully we get the message and deliver it to the Congress.
B0001Z363W|5.0|If you're into heavy metal music, this is for you!  The songs are great!  We listen to this cd over and over!

B000002IPZ|5.0|SOULS OF BLACK is the last THRASH album from  TESTAMENT....it´s not the raw THRASH of THE LEGACY and THE NEW ORDER, but a refined THRASH like on PRACTICE WHAT YOU PREACH....after SOULS, TESTAMENT recorded a more mainstream album(RITUAL) and some DEATH METAL(LOW, GATHERING)....There´s some ALL TIME classics like the title track, FACE IN THE SKY, FALLING FAST, MALPRACTICE and ABSENCE OF LIGHT....if you like old METALLICA, you will surely like the early TESTAMENT albums(because Chuck Billy´s voice is like a James Hetfield completelly insane and pissed off)!!!!!! GREAT PIECE OF THRASH!!!!!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Love to play but is too addicting for me to do much of.  It uses too much juice on my kindle so need to recharge alot.  Would recommend to any one who needs something to do by themselfs and has time to do it.

B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Although not entirely free this game is well worth the price!  The story line along with the games was very entertaining and the graphics were very well done.  I do recommend this game.  I totally enjoyed it.
B000001C6M|5.0|SHOW NO MERCY, SLAYER´s debut is a raw fast THRASH collection of Slayer songs, before Slayer created their own THRASH sound....Thereś some ALL TIME classics like DIE BY THE SWORD, THE ANTICHRIST, TORMENTOR and BLACK MAGIC...Slayer still shows HUGE influences from VENOM and JUDAS PRIEST(Crionics sound like a Judas tune, while Tom Araya screams like Venom´s singer)....Besides the fact that the band were really young and the influences, SHOW NO MERCY is a great unique beast on Slayer´s catalogue....SLAAAAAAAYEEERRRRR!!!!!!!!!!
B005SZNZAY|4.0|Took a couple listenings but I really enjoy it. His voice sounds great on most songs. After reading some reviews of his live shows there are several other songs I would rather have on this album but &#34;The Keeper' has quickly become one of my all-time favorites.
B000UGG39Q|5.0|yes, OVER THE UNDER is a MODERN MASTERPIECE...i really like PANTERA, and the other DOWN albums, but this one shows such interesting lyrics and such powerful SABBATH riffs all over...i really like all the songs but THE PATH, 3 SUNS and 1 staR,ON MARCH THE SAINTS, MOURN and PILLAMYD are highlights.....TOTALLY GREAT!!!!! and TOTALLY recommended for heavy metal lovers all over the world!!!!! This one is a masterpiece!!!!!!WELL DONE, DOWN!!!!!!
B004LWZWGK|4.0|I don't think the second installment can be beaten but I don't think Nolan tried to. This was nicely done.

B00BMVTS1S|5.0|The movie is different from the book, there were elements of the notes in there. I only wish that it was the extended version which will be coming out later this year. Despite the differences I still loved this movie.
B000002H2H|5.0|METALLICA create a THRASH masterpiece with RIDE THE LIGHTNING.....After their glorious debut KILL EN ALL, METALLICA refined their raw punk THRASH into something more meaningful...While KILL EN ALL is a hallucinated young raw THRASH petard, RIDE show a mature side in METALLICA, with introspective lyrics and even a powerful ballad(FADE TO BLACK)....well, in my opinion is a COMPLETE MASTERPIECE with gens like the title track, FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE, FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS and CREEPING DEATH!!!!!! WELL DONE, METALLICA!!!!!!!
B0051T47NQ|5.0|After seeing this and knowing the movie was a keeper I went straight out and bought Troll Hunter -- can't wait to see the amazment on friends and family faces lo

MAIDEN got thunderous chorus and perfect melodies!!!!! THeir debut, with Paul Di'anno is a complete classic with gens like PROWLER, RUNNING FREE, CHARLOTTE THE HARLOT, STRANGE WORLD and SANCTUARY!!!!!!maybe is not Maiden's best effort, but is a piece of the heavy music history!!!!! TOTALLY GREAT!!!!UP THE IRONS!!!!!!!
B000SOZXJG|5.0|I really liked it. I think others will, also. What else can I say? Good stuff. I can't think of four more words.
B000002H97|5.0|yes, the legendary BLACK ALBUM marks the point when METALLICA leave the furious fast raw THRASH of KILL EN ALL in the past, and started to record a kind of refined HEAVY METAL....maybe only HOLIER THAN THOU and THROUGH THE NEVER shows some THRASH roots...others like the fantastic SAD BUT TRUE, the magic WHEREVER I MAY ROAM or even the gen ENTER SANDMAN shows a new style for METALLICA....some call them SELL OUTS, even i thought that sometime in the past( the only sell out trace is NOTHING ELSE MATTERS)...now, what i can say is that this wonderful METAL piece is WITHOUT ANY DOUBT one of the best albuns of the music history!!!!!plus, it marks ALL the THRASH movement as a icon of that kind of METAL......ONE TRUE METAL CLASSIC!!!!!! WELL DONE, METALLICA!!!!!!!
B000K7VHQE|5.0|I just love this movie. Really clever, fun, moving, beautiful.  I imagine it's not everyone's cup of tea, but if you like a clever and quirky movie with great acting and a real cast of characters, you'll like Little Miss Sunshine a lot.
B000002ITM|5.0|yes, THE RITUAL is a great album, but is clearly when TESTAMENT refined their THRASH to some kind of METAL MAINSTREAM(something METALLICA and MEGADETH did too)...There´s some ALL TIME classics like ELECTRIC CROWN, SO MANY LIES and AS THE SEASONS GREY...Don´t expect the furious THRASH of LEGACY and THE NEW ORDER, but something cool and refined like METALLICA´s Black album and MEGADETH´s YOUTHANASIA!!!!!After many spins, i can say i really like THE RITUAL!!!!!
B00AFEXRME|5.0|This was a riveting movie! Raw emotion. I really wanted the character<br />to rise above his struggle! The ending was unexpected.
B005DKLPF6|5.0|MASTODON is BY FAR the best METAL act of the world now!!!!There are others making great metal too, like LAMB OF GOD and DOWN...but, in my opinion, MASTODON is clearly the best METAL band of the last 10 years....All their albuns are AMAZING!!!! i can´t really say which one is greater...LEVIATHAN, BLOOD MOUNTAIN, REMISSION.......this one, THE HUNTER, shows a more refined MASTODON....All the songs are really inspired, MASTODON´s lyrics are really meaningful...well, i really like METALLICA, SLAYER, PANTERA, SEPULTURA, and MASTODON is on their high METAL level!!!!!MASTODON RULES THE WORLD OF METAL, by now!!!!!!!(Lamb of God is really great too)
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a fun game but I hate the cop he messes me up.I love this new one,I also like the theme of the game too.What will the next theme be?
B000000OQF|5.0|This is really a masterpiecxe!!!!! GUNS debut is filled with great HEAVY ROCK tunes like NIGHTRAIN, IT´S SO EASY, WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE and ROCKET QUEEN!!!!!! thereś few albuns in this world as brilliant, raw and furious as APPETITE FOR DESTRUCTION!!!!! This one is a MASTERPIECE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I liked how the story unraveled as it went along.  I thought it was more for young adults.  It was entertaining, I read it in a day.
B001R4MEYI|5.0|While the first 3 MASTODON albums are HEAVY BRUTAL METAL acts, CRACK THE SKYE show some progressive influences(something the old RUSH did)...it´s really a great inspired album....DIVINATIONS, THE CZAR and THE LAST BARON are METAL gens....in fact, the 7 tracks are all great....MASTODON is one of the best METAL bands of ALL TIME!!!!! Check their stuff if you like good HEAVY music!!!!!!!WELL DONE, MASTODON!!!!!!!!!!
B007HC3LHS|4.0|Thought it was really good.  I couldn't put it down.  In fact I immediately got another book from the same author, who I never read before.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This series is truly amazing and refreshing..These people have become as close to me as my own family. It is beautifully written, directed, acted and presented. There is no foul language (not necessary, because these writers have talent!), and the settings are gorgeous. The plot twists and turns are always surprising, but also realistic.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|This unit brought  45 year old slides and negatives from the Vietnam war, back to life for my dad. He had hundreds of each, that would have cost hundreds of dollars to have reproduced and printed. The slides inn this machine were viewable on our tv, and crystal clear. Any scalable or printable ones were stored on a memory card. Awesome product.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I love this app. The best thing about it is to be able to convert the video into MP3. So that way u can have both video n song.

B003NHRGSQ|5.0|I found this a very interesting book, an easy read and I didn't want to put it down once I started it. I bwould compare it to the Twilight  series minus the vampires.
B00AAQVSDW|5.0|This album caught me off guard ! The entire thing is great! Can listen to it straight through no track is second rate
B004QX07G4|5.0|What can I say it's ELLEN! :) she is so funny, reading this book you can actually hear her talking in your head.  Love it
B003K16PFU|5.0|If you want to understand why Orwell wrote \\"1984\\" and \\"Animal farm\\" then this is the book to read. I own the Kindel version of this book. I cant praise this book enough! Sure, I am already biased for my love of Anarcho-syndicalism, and I love everything I have ever had the pleasure of reading from George Orwell. If you are a student of the history of the Spanish revolution then this is a must have for your collection. If you are interested in the rise of the Soviets, Anarchist communes, political intrigue and infighting then this book will capture your undivided attention. This is a personal account of George Orwell's volunteer service during the Spanish civil war -- \\"I've come to fight against Fascism\\". Orwell said as he contacted the ILP (independent Labour Party) and he joined its commrades in the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM - Partido Obrero de Unificaci&oacute;n Marxista). Orwell spent much of his time on the Aragon front next to all types of leftists, both authoritarian (Soviets) and anti-authoritarian (Anarchists). Orwell sings praises of the courage of the Anarchists during his fights, and though at first he considered the Soviets as allies, his account tells a chilling tail of the backstabbing and manipulative propaganda the Soviets used to take control of other leftist groups and to demonize those who refused to come under sway. When Orwell arrived in Barcelona, the Anarchists were still virtually in control of Catalonia. It was the first time Orwell had ever been in a town where the working class \\"was in the saddle.\\" He clearly conveys the sense of excitement of seeing the city under de facto workers' control, and the intensity of the revolutionary spirit which coursed through the people. \\"Servile and even ceremonial forms of speech had temporarily disappeared. Nobody said 'Senor' or 'Don' or even 'Usted;' everyone called everyone else 'Comrade' and Thou,' and said 'Salud' instead of 'Buenos Dias.'\\" It seemed like all men were equal, and there was hope in the air. \\"All this was queer and moving. There was much in it I did not understand, in some ways I did not even like it, but I recognized it almost immediately as a state of affairs worth fighting for.\\" - Get this book and read it 20 times over until it sinks in: Authoritarianism SUCKS!!!s hope in the air. \\"All this was queer and moving. There was much in it I did not understand, in some ways I did not even like it, but I recognized it almost immediately as a state of affairs worth fighting for.\\" - Get this book and read it 20 times over until it sinks in: Authoritarianism SUCKS!!!
B009J2VR3Y|5.0|Love Whitney and great. To have favorites all in one CD.  Just such a shame she left us too soon.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|.i don't think facebook was tailoed for a kindle fire. it is different than on a computer. the layout is not the same. things are harder to figure out. its not as much fun. that is of couse without the appp. so i'll get app and see if it is better.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|If you love Bocelli......well lets just say I watched the PBS special featuring this album four times (filmed in Portofino, Italy)
B001UV4XIS|5.0|This movie was everything that I hoped and wished for. The effects were amazing, everything was just perfect. The acting, the actors should have gotten a lot more credit then they have gotten, cause the acting was also amazing. Now I agree with everybody else that Utraviolet does suck. But all you have to do is contact them and ask for the iTunes code and they should contact you in less then two hours, and when you go to your email there should be an email from them giving you the code.
B004QBWU02|5.0|Hard to believe this movie is 40 years old but I'll tell you something,it's held up quite well-It's because of \\"American Graffiti\\" that I started getting into oldies music-Everything about \\"AG\\" is perfect-The cast was full of virtual unknowns like Suzanne Somers who four years later became famous on the TV show \\"Three's Company\\",Harrison Ford as hot rod driver Bob Falfa who challenges Paul Le Mat's character of John Milner to a drag race-Of course,Ford became world famous as Han Solo in Lucas' 1977 magnum opus \\"Star Wars\\",Charles Martin Smith who played the nerdy Terry \\"The Toad\\" Fields & his awkward attempts to impress Debbie (Candy Clark),& Richard Dreyfuss as Curt Henderson who isn't sure if college is for him.<br />Thanks to a killer soundtrack & the presence of Wolfman Jack,\\"American Graffiti\\" remains an undisputed cinematic classic-If you'v never seen \\"AG\\",I urge you to purchase it-You won't be disappointed.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I just love this book. I can't get enough of it!&#60;3 If you are looking for a great read, then you don't have to look any farther. Go on an adventure with Casters and memories of the past.
B00AE2J93I|4.0|I liked this movie as it was different and enjoyable but I'm not sure it's for toddlers as much as younger kids say about eight as it was different in dealing with dead people. It's worth what it costs to rent so go for it if you want something different yet enjoyable, albeit a bit dark compared to most.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is amazing it has great block graphics and is fun for everyone trust me u will love this game
B00B3HJLX6|5.0|Four stars for the selection/execution and a bonus star for recording quality. This ep breathes new life into tunes I grew up with. To compare these versions to their original counterparts is a moot point because these versions are fresh sounding. I wish the disc was longer cause the party ends too soon!
6304698798|5.0|Action packed with many twist and turns.  Leaving you wondering what will happen next or who will run into who next. And you don't find out until the very end who ends up with the gold. A wonderful played out show down.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|LOVED the second book, it really explains everything going on with dark and light casters and incabus. Story take a turn it will surprise you.. can't wait to read the third book.

B00AKKTDJY|5.0|This is a fun game. I would tell anyone about it! Some of the levels are hard and you have to do them over and over again, till you get the right compo. But it is so much fun to play it worth it :). :)
B000FBFN1U|5.0|George does not disappoint. Loved the story and the surprises. The depth of the detail is amazing and the characters histories so rich.
B00BHU9DUK|5.0|The film we saw  -- not the recent movie-- does justice to the story. The actors are excellent, scene settings fit beautifully & helped to tell the stories of the individuals and their relationships that make it a classic tale.
B003FAJTOA|4.0|Often copied never duplicated. His films and writing are amazing. He wrote Runaway Train. A sleeper of a film but excellent.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I bought this watch and the blue version for casual wear.  Very nice watches.  A great deal at $54.  Word of warning:  these are automatic movements with very little reserve time.  If you leave it sitting for half a day it will wind down.  I use an automatic watch winder for these.  Without the automatic watch winder, if you are not wearing the watch every day, you will constantly be resetting it.
B00AFEY354|5.0|This is this generations' \\"Breakfast Club\\" as a group of western Pa. misfits come together and help each other deal with their issues.<br /><br />Charlie (Logan Lerman imitating Jesse Eisenberg) is a loner who has issues with normal socializing. He is a freshman in high school and befriends Patrick (Ezra Miller) an in the closet senior who is also an outcast. Patrick introduces Charlie to his low self esteem step sister Sam (Emma Watson) who Charlie immediately takes to. Charlie ends up joining their circle of friends, one that includes the frequent use of drugs and alcohol. The drug and alcohol use is shown as being nonchalant, perhaps in a realistic sense, at least the one I grew up with.<br /><br />The group has a number of colorful characters which add to the mix. The film has multiple themes including \\"We accept the love we think we deserve.\\" The teens have heart and recognize the needs of each other and are able to give and accept. The weirdest thing of the film was the use of cassette tapes. Seriously?<br /><br />The soundtrack reflected the feelings of Charlie. It starts out with an acoustical number that was sad, lame, and untalented. It picks up at the tunnel scene. At one point we listen to XTC \\"Dear God\\" a tune on my mix tape. There was a scene where I expected to hear J Geils chime in with \\"Love Stinks\\" but it didn't happen.<br /><br />This is a film for older teens, which some parents would object to. Good acting. Decent plot, although the aunt thing wasn't that well developed.<br /><br />Parental Guide: No sex or nudity. 1 f-bomb. Sexual themes including homosexuality. Another hit film from Pittsburgh.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|What a great series!  I wasn't sure I'd like it but a couple of folks recommended it so I downloaded the first season.  I was through that in about two weeks and immediately downloaded the second season.  It drew me in from the start with characters I cared about and plenty of intrigue both upstairs and down!<br /><br />I can't wait to view season 3!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great little app. Keeps me busy and helps to teach my niece responsibility :) I definitely recommend this game. I think that it has awesome graphics and gives you tips all along.
0062209493|4.0|This brought back memories of Vietnam, not knowing who the true enemy was and that their value of life in sôme countries is not the same as the United States. Chris was very honest about life in the military and should help families understand the stress and help them to deal with different situations when returning home.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|This is a great free app.  It has a lot of great editing options. I could spend hours on this app!
B009GX69RK|5.0|Clever, quirky, with excellent writing, this show cannot be beat.  Great ensemble cast, which clearly has chemistry to spare.  Thrilled that there will be a season 3!

B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing and heart wrenching!!  The twists and turns throughout keep you intrigued throughout the whole book! Pure love for this novel!
B00AR15KWU|5.0|I agree with Anthony, this album brings us more of the musically style we have grown to love from Hardcore Superstar. Ever since their self titled album in 2005 (which by the way is epic), these guys have easily gained quite the loyal fan base. HS has found their way into my top 3 along with Crashdiet and Buckcherry. I have to say that I do not feel this release is as strong as Split Your Lip. There were just so many in your face, loud tunes on that cd that stuck in your head for days (minus the slow lazy ballad). I am a huge fan of this release and there just isn't anyway to rate it less than 5 since this band alone carries the &#34;street metal&#34; torch all by themselves. These guys know how to produce singable music, there is no doubt about that. I do feel the mix on this cd is a bit off, the lyrics in some of the tunes seem to be drowned out by instrumentals. I hope to God these guys get to the US and soon. As far as my favs, easily Dead Mans Shoes, Cmon take on me and Above the Law. Please stay around guys, we loyal sleaze rock fans need ya, you've come this far and your only going to get bigger.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|It seemed like I was there as I read Chris' accounts of warfare for freedom. I think he understood that no one will question what brave American warriors are willing to do if we are willing to help those that need it, outnumbered by an infiltrated enemy...the hardest kind of enemy to fight.  I feel we all owe Chris for our freedom, and we should tell all of his enemies, in country and out, to go pound sand...Mr. V!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I like everyone else can see similarities between this book and Fiftyshades of gray. That being said Sylvia Day is a far superior writer and I'm sorry but Christian Gray has nothing on Gideon Cross!
B002JVWR9U|5.0|As a huge fan of vampire lore as well as other elements of the supernatural I will say that this series is one of the better takes on the vampire craze that has swept through the entertainment industry of late. There are so many shows/movies out nowadays dealing with vampires and their supernatural cousins werewolves plus witches too that it is hard to keep up with everything. My introduction into Hollywood's take on vampires came in 1987 when \\"The Lost Boys\\" was released and I fell in love with the concept of vampirism, especially when I saw how handsome the vamps were with their rock star good looks. Kiefer Sutherland made one great vamp. Then later \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" the movie came out in 1992 followed by the show in 1997 and its spinoff \\"Angel\\" all of which rekindled my affection for the genre. It didn't hurt that Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt also made it look appealing to have fangs and suck blood in \\"Interview With The Vampire\\" in 1994. So in keeping with my interest in the vampire mythology I began to watch all the newer vamp shows- \\"True Blood,\\" \\"Being Human,\\" the movies \\"Twilight\\"- and also \\"The Vampire Diaries.\\" I have to say that Diaries in my opinion is the most appealing of all the recent takes on vamps and it even covers, as all the aforementioned shows do, the equally popular werewolf lore plus even throws in a witch or two. Now that the zombie popularity wave has swept through eclipsing the vamp/werewolf craze I'm waiting for a show or movie that combines ALL the different supernatural elements.<br /><br />Diaries is interesting for one thing b/c the books on which the show is based came out in 1991, way before any of these other popular shows burst onto the scene. I don't know why it took so long for them to be adapted into a tv show but I'm glad Kevin Williamson took an interest in developing them. Making a name for himself by bringing us movies such as \\"Scream\\" and \\"I Know What You Did Last Summer\\" he was the perfect visionary genius to translate this wonderful story of a girl in love with two brothers- one generally good, the other a bad-boy- to the small screen. I'm glad also that he chose to use television instead of film to do it so that the story can go on and on. Thankfully \\"Twilight\\" is now over but Diaries can go on and on with new characters and new stories adding to the old characters and stories.<br /><br />This show gives us a chance to grow with it- grow with the stories and the characters. The characters and plots are not one-sided but are multidimensional which makes for some great entertainment. At the center of the story initially is the love triangle between Elena and the vampire Salvatore Brothers- Stefan (Elena's smoldering white knight) and Damon (her smokin' dark knight)- both of whom are in love with her. This first season pretty much centers on their relationship while friends circle the periphery coming into their own with time. Elena's friends Caroline and Bonnie are a vampire and a witch respectively. Males also in Elena's world include Tyler who is coming to terms with being a werewolf and Alaric who is a vampire hunter plus ex-boyfriend Matt and little brother Jeremy who has his own problems. Elena is learning about herself while processing the changing roles of those around her and dealing with high school in the aftermath of her parents' tragic death.<br /><br />The show is dark and mysterious with very little tongue in cheek humor that made Buffy so clever. It explores the mysteries and past of the town instead of focusing on high school which is refreshing and appealing since we've had so much exposure to high school with Buffy and Twilight, just to name a couple. A big part of the show is the town's and the characters' past which is often shown in flashbacks. (I'm not sure why several reviewers seem to think the characters are time-traveling? It is obvious the past is being seen in flashbacks as the characters are remembering their history. As far as I can tell, no one does any time traveling here.)<br /><br />Season 1 has lots of good writing and storytelling plus lots of interesting characters and plot twists- never a dull person or moment with this show. It is rather exciting and not over the top graphic gore. The creators do not waste such a delicious premise by ruining it with graphic gore, sex or profanity. This show is plenty scary and is a bit mature in theme. I also like the creativity with which this show is made- that makes it more appealing than the dull Twilight theme which got old after the 2nd or 3rd installment. The actors are pretty good too. At first I wasn't happy with the show version of Elena since the book portrayed her differently. However, the tv Elena now seems a stronger character than the book heroine. I remember Paul Wesley from a \\"Smallville\\" episode and he has come into his own on this show as Stefan. To me, the most appealing star is Ian Somerhaulder who as Damon owns this character.<br /><br />This show is definitely worth watching and even holds its own among all the other vamp shows and flicks out there. I'd say it only takes a couple of episodes to get into it and once you're sucked in (excuse the pun) you won't want to quit. Expect to marathon watch the season through to the end. My guess is you won't be disappointed. I imagine it appeals mostly to teenage girls but I'm almost 40 and I've watched it with my 13 year-old godson who likes it, as well as with my 64 year-old mom who is addicted to it too. I don't think it is limited to any age group. It might appeal more to females than males but who knows?
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Good book and great series. I liked the first and second a lot better. Good read though. Enjoyable for all ages.
B001CTGQBK|5.0|my daughter (in her 20's) really loved this movie and sings along to it every time she watches it.  funny how things are cyclical...it came out when i was younger than her!
044024630X|5.0|I'm so sad that after starting the Jack Reacher series about 5 months ago, I'm nearing the end. I feel like Jack is a friend by now. It's like there's this real guy out there and I need to know more. I enjoyed this book because it went back in time to 1997 when he was still a Major in the Army. He dealt with both the Army and the local police in this book, and it was an interesting dynamic. This was the first time, though, that I felt like Jack didn't need to kill the people he did. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the book and seeing Jack's great reasoning skills put the pieces together and win in the end.

(Can't believe Tom Cruise is playing him in the movie, he is 6'5&#34; and 250 in the books!) Anyway, this book kept me going, really liked that is was set in Montana. I was able to keep the characters straight and not have to keep going  back into the book to figure out who's who. Would recommed to friends.

B000W1586S|5.0|Hailing from Las Vegas, The Killers had rose to the international spotlight with the         release of their highly anticipated debut CD, Hot Fuss, which had brought them to the         ranks of the Indie Rock Revolution.  What would be ironic about this wonder rock and         roll band is their lead singer-guitarist Brendan Flowers, who would quickly rise among         ranks in the rock pantheon as one of the greatest and most admired rock composers         in the music’s history.    Showcased with a stellar track list that are headed by several         classic hits such as the Top Ten smash hit Mr. Brightside and Somebody Told Me, as         well as on fascinating hits like Jenny Was A Friend Of Mine, Change Of Mine and the         CD bonus hit Glamorous Indie Rock & Roll as they deliver a fresh and vibrant form of          contemporary rock and roll, which is highly showcased by guitar-driven solos, smooth         harmonic vocals, unique brand for creative songwriting, charismatic artistry and there         knack for compelling artistry.  Heading a stellar band that also includes Dave Keuning         on bass, Mark Stoermer on keyboards and Ronnie Vannucci on the drums--alongside         Flowers himself, the band introduced a new and multi-complex sound to rock and roll         filled with new directions and dynamic interplay.  Their debut album would be just the         beginning, we can expect to hear more from them for a long time, and they had been         hailed as one of the true contemporary rock bands destined to bring the original spirit         of rock and roll well into the future—and beyond.   For both fans and true admirers of         The Killers, Hot Fuss will forever be immortalized as the classic debut CD that made         the band such a household name on the rock scene and in the music world.

B000VZYXPC|5.0|With Indie Rock becoming the official guiding light for the future of Rock & Roll and         The Killers as one of it’s biggest music acts, the band delivered another highly praised         masterpiece in 2006 when they released the realistic follow-up to there blockbuster hit         debut album two years later.  Showcased with a more exhilarating and melodic sound,         The Killers again hit the album charts with their second album Sam’s Town (taking the         name from Sam’s Town Hotel And Gambling Hall, a popular casino that band member         Mark Stoermer visited regularly in his teens) as it feature outstanding songwriting from         Brandon Flowers, the band’s co-leader, where he broadens his songwriting abilities as         he follows in the footsteps of Bruce Springsteen and John Mellencamp, but leaves his         indelible mark for catchy melodies.  Beginning with the title track, the superlative track         set proceed with other timeless tracks, like the sweeping mid-tempo rock ballad When         We Were Young (abeited with it’s sweet solo piano interlude), For Reasons Unknown,         Read My Mind, This River Is Wild and the final track Why Do I Keep Counting?, which         make Sam’s Town another critical and commercial triumph which Flowers deliberately         lend his conceptual quality, as Hot Fuss and Sam’s Town solidify Flowers’ standing as         one of the greatest and most original rock composers ever to come on the rock scene         in a while. The album even have a serious side as the band put a spotlight on several         dark tunes like Uncle Johnny (about a drug addict on his downward spiral), while rest         of the album take a bold look on the bright side of life, whom The Killers handles with         excellent rapport and terrific skill.  Sam’s Place is an absolute must!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|great game that is simple yet challenging.  I really enjoy playing it when I need a break and highly recommend it for everyone!

B006MW3UZW|5.0|I am hooked on Downton Abbey!  Never thought it would interest me, but I can't wait for the next episode!
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Highlighted by compassionate soul that is showcased with timeless songwriting,         superlative production, national pride and plenty of captivating artistry to spare, the         band Mumford And Sons scored an award-winning masterpiece in 2012 that would         become a blockbuster success.  Filled with rock solid camaraderie, pulsating solos,         excellence and a compelling tone, Babel is a near-perfect folk-rock album featuring         songs about hope and self-determination- abeited by the band’s folk-rock virtuosity         performed with crystallized harmony and powerful singing.  Starting with the official         title track, the embolden track set concludes with other classic songs like Whispers         In The Dark, I Will Wait, Holland Road, Ghosts That We Knew, Not With Haste and         three bonus tracks, including a take on the 1969 Simon And Garfunkle classic The         Boxer (with Paul Simon and Jerry Douglas sitting in) and a couple acoustic original         folk tracks which give it the acoustic laden touch that it fully deserve.  This is British         folk-rock showcased by an English inspirational background as it glisten with bright         drama and enthralling merriment, so thanks to Babel, Mumford And Sons had took         their music toward bigger heights.  A Number One album in both Great Britain and         the United States, the album even got lots of critical accolades, thanks in part from         it’s phenomenal success, as the band mastered the sonically impeccable virtuosity         and punch-to-the-gut power with their towering stroke of genius that is showcased         by the benefiting folks sounds bind with their unrestrained characteristics that also          made Babel a more subtle accomplished album.  Although I may have to seriously         recommend the ‘deluxe edition’, which makes it the best edition to date, Babel will         permanently live in infinity as well as for countless ages.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This game is insanely fun! Don't plan to jump on and off, once you're on you're on!<br />You will like playing this game til your battery is died. Have fun!
B004HW7JH4|5.0|This scored for me and was well received. I lived Mad Men - so for me personally - it is OK.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Highly addictive. Once you start you can not put it down. I was looking for something a little different. This was . Perfect.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I have read this book so many times since childhood - I pick it up every 5 - 7 years and lose myself in Oz. The rest of Baum's Oz series is really good also.
B007BT0RKG|5.0|I like this app because it is offline. My android is offline when I am away from my home service.  For this reason I absolutely love this app.  I can find what I am looking for without being connected to the net.  LOVE IT!
B00AVPYT8I|5.0|Love the fact that I can download as many books as I want to read, as opposed to only 1 per month with my Prime membership
B007TNS6JI|4.0|This game is great but the problem is gameloft and some reviewers. Gameloft needs more original games like a........spin off game but these game you make now are rip offs of other work. Which is great some people do want to play console or pc games when they do not have them but you need to also be original. Now for the reviewers........STOP SAYING THE GAME IS GOOD AND GIVE IT ONE STAR! Really it makes no sense it looks like to me your giving the company a rating. Reviews out there needs to remember you can not just type you must put your feelings on your kindle.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Having worked in mental health for many years, Pat's character was unique and lovable.  After<br /> watching the movie, you certainly appreciate the author's character development.  I loved the fantasy psychiatrist!
B00AB2NYNC|5.0|For the Mumford and Sons fan, GET THIS! The music is great, and the movie shows not only the Red Rocks show, but little bits from throughout their tour.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|The main character is well fleshed out and her family suits her.  I was somewhat disappointed in Will; I didn't feel I knew his soul but I could empathize with his actions.
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|I'm always skeptical about renting horror films until I see the other reviews but I think the reviews on this one did not do it justice.  It had us on the edge of our seats and I even jumped a few times it was so suspenseful!
0316228532|1.0|A meandering, rather pointless book. Seems to be trying to aspire to be like Tom Wolfe, but without any of the humor. Characters are almost completely unlikable, and as a reader I struggled to empathize with anyone's point of view. Which is hard to achieve in a book of this length. Could see the end coming a mile away, and hoped I was wrong. I wish I could get back the wasted hours. It'll be  awhile before I read fiction again.
1419701533|5.0|I love the fact my 8 year old son is so enthralled in reading these. Reads all night and I have to tell him to turn off the light and go to sleep!!

B000005RUV|5.0|Great cd that I have been unable to find.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Absolutely loved it! I can't wait to see what the movie is like. Hopefully as good as the book!! :)
B008HJGPVO|5.0|The 5 stars is for it is well made and as far as rubber tipped stylus go. If you like the whole rubber tipped feel of a stylus this is very good for the price. It might slide better on a device with a screen protector but my naked, squeaky clean screen resists it's movement. VERY VERY well made, I'm not buying a screen protector to give you advise on the difference. The devise it was used on iPad 4th, Retina.
B0091REZMW|3.0|you either have to wait a lot or spend a lithographs money to keep playing. There should be more ways to earn diamonds.
B0000024YL|3.0|I heard a rendition of one of their songs recently,  and wanted to get a view of what they came up w while performing together. They have some really good songs...but I dont think its a cd I could listen to over & over again.  Ill hold off on the repeat button. lol Just not connecting , maybe you have to be in the mood for em. Its warm & sunny...the sound of silence lyric wise, nope!
B008JGSM6G|3.0|I guess its ok. Very easy so I got bored quick. deleted it fairly fast. 10 year old son likes it tho

B0063M22QO|1.0|Way too easy. I can clear the whole thing every time.<br />yawn. I need a challenge. I would pick a different one.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Addicting and fun and a great app to pass time with. Turned my bf onto it and my kids and his kids lol
B004SJ3AXI|2.0|not much to this game, there are not enough scenes to really get in to it. so add some scenes
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game. It is very addictive to play. At night before I go to bed I have to play it.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|same angry birds but without the ads, though the star wars angry birds is still shown when you pause the game
B00000IZOR|5.0|I bought this item for my 4 month old grandson. This kind of toy has been in the household for years. My two year old has one and he uses it to call his uncles.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|love the game but dislike the fact that you have to repeatly try breeding dragons over till you get the one your trying for
B004RNCLIA|5.0|Cat's Cradle is another example of Vonnegut's mastery of using satire and dark humor to get the reader to take a closer look at themselves and the world around them. The characters and the protagonist in many of Vonnegut's books are not your typical run of the mill characters, yet you can always relate to them and Cat's Cradle is no exception.<br /><br />The heart of the story takes place on the island of San Lorenzo. The main character John, a writer, finds himself on the island along with the rest of the characters - a dictator, an ambassador, the three (adult) children of a scientist that invented a doomsday device, an old religious leader/outlaw and a few other characters. But the real star of the book, for me anyways, was the religion that Vonnegut invented call Bokononism. The first page of the Bokononist book warns reader to not read the book because it is full of lies. The motto of the Bokononist's religion is \\"Live by the foma (harmless untruths) that make you brave and kind and healthy and happy.\\"<br /><br />Cat's Cradle takes a look at science, religion, technology and human nature in classic Vonnegut form. In my opinion, reading Vonnegut can lead one to a higher level of enlightenment quicker than any so called spiritual or religious book ever could. I have read several books by Vonnegut and even though I didn't love them all, all of them has given me something to think about.<br /><br />I highly recommend Cat's Cradle to everyone. The truth be told I recommend reading all of Vonnegut's books to everyone.
B0035V35P8|5.0|This is the kind of story that does not remind you of any other you watched before, thats what makes it unique. The effects, the action, the fights are NOT with \\"crazzy cam shots\\" meaning: those like in GI Joe, when the ninjas were fighting, that shaking visuals that you can't appreciate a punch...yeah that.<br /><br />Lots of blood and body extremities cuted ;D
B00BKTWBMA|1.0|Dosen't even have the punch of \\"Pilgrim\\".. very mediocre album.. poor vocals, weak arrangements, unispired band, pointless song choices, not a decent guitar solo in sight.... and I'm a FAN!!
B004P7CNE0|5.0|Here is a most have in your collection, this is a different way of justice and plot turns that are not expected, but good ones!!
0307237699|5.0|I purchased this book to pick together my collection for the first Black President of United States of America.  This is history.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Great series.  If you have not watched it at all, I suggest you begin with season 1.  Many shows are stand alone, but there is a running theme regarding Beckett hunting the people responsible for the death of her mother.
B0050PYNO4|4.0|This movie is the perfect selection for the nerdy film fan.<br />Homages, jokes, and a nice adventure, just like ET with drugs+nerds+more comedy.<br /><br />Great picture quality and sound. Lots of extras but the story while not bad, could be better.<br />Give it a chance, Simon Peg will never fail in the laugh department.
B0050X1OQ6|4.0|it simply works. now my pc runs faster. too bad that i couldn't utilize all 2gb memory. i have win 32bit os and the max i could go for is 3gb (i already had 2gb installed)
B003Q6D282|4.0|Yes, the story is being extended in every movie, but this is really the end, while you can say this is only for the kills, for th gore and torture, thereis ome space too for filling in the plot holes.<br />You get closure and some surprises.<br />Maybe a little tired franchise but with this, you get your ending and you will be satisfied.<br />The sound is gorgeous and the picture quality while not great is really good.
B009F7ORQW|3.0|In another review a customer was complaining about the seat belts that make it difficult to get Barbie in/out of the car. I resolved this issue by turning the car upside down, taking a box cutter and carefully slicing off little by little of the pink seat belt plastic, 'till I was able to semi-comfortably slip it in/out of the little slits in the white plastic.<br /><br />Nothing to complain about; total steal at this price C:
B0002DRDBE|4.0|Yeah, I'm a fan. I love Kevin Smith movies like next nerd. But this one is a version that everyone should get, not just the fans, but the filmmakers too. With lots of clips, notes, comments and stuff this edition is perfect as a gift, to give or be given.
B009DJB8I2|5.0|Amazing music for sure, alright MAYBE it has a little more music than what is available free, but I really just bought it for the hard copies of the discs, ha!<br /><br />ALSO big surprise with the Team Fortress 2 codes. For those who don't actively play I would GLADLY take them off your hands! Haha
B0031S4K5E|5.0|You just have to love Ponyo.<br />This plush makes it worthy, but even without it,the ovie is beautiful and warm, for kids and grown ups. Just another Ghibli classic.
B001FB563E|3.0|Although the movie is quite grim and at times nerve racking, the score is excellent and includes and smart violin that is also dramatic.
B004EPZ06Q|4.0|Yeah, this movie is more of the same, but that's not bad!<br />It's funny and you really want to see what happen now.<br />It's the worst case scenario of the average Joe. If Joe were drugged and lost, and sold and oh my god, it could happen, right?<br />RIGHT!?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very entertaining if your young or old it has crazy twists and it makes sense so fun and amazing I just love it so much and I'm a kid myself you can play at any age range and everything
B008AT71WI|5.0|This movie is awesome, why? because as a remake of a remake not only doesn't lose it's core, it adds a lot with the new edition, the classic finale, two versions (theatrical and director's cut), a lot of extras and excelent sound which waswhat I really liked the first second I was watching it.<br /><br />Without a doubt a must own for fans of the movie. Crisp colors, extra content, nice visuals (This is the best picture quality this movie is going to get) and a great story with the classic ending and the never before seen nding which is welcome ifyou wentto the live show.
B000TTRGUE|5.0|I use it for karaoke singing.. It meets and exceeds  my expectations. I would recommend this mic for any amateur singers out there!
B001RIY4WE|5.0|You know you want it.<br />It's Terminator 2.<br />Looking the best and rocking your home theater, T2 Skynet edition is explosive!<br />Need I say more?<br /><br />Get it... like NOW! NOW!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was at AWP last Friday when I picked up the complementary copy of the WSJ at my hotel with its fascinating story on Hugh's journey to the hard cover publication. On Tuesday, I downloaded the Kindle edition and just finished reading it tonight.<br /><br />Far from being science fiction, this is truly a post-apocalyptic dystopian novel that should take its rightful place along side George Orwell's 1984.<br /><br />Hugh's use of language is polished and his detail of description are wonderful without becoming tedious. The pacing of the story is great. I can normally anticipate what's coming next in a book, but this hit me with at least two unexpected curves.<br /><br />All in all, a tremendous book that sets a new standard for this genre.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|Yeah, the perfect chick flick...<br />While it could seem longer, it is better than other editions, you have to getthis if you, like my wife love this movie.<br />It looks awesome, it sound great and will be prfect while the family is gathering in a holiday.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great app.  It allows you to use several different versions of the Bible, allows for note taking and book marking.  You can also down some versions of the Bible to use in an offline mode.  Great resource tool to study the Bible with.  I'm still learning how to utilize the full potential of this app.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|Full of action. Full of digital effects that bring the comic alive. Scott Pilgrim is a love story, and action flick, and a Bible for comic fans and gamers.<br />The picture quality is great, you can show that ol' LED screen with this one! And the sound... whoah, the sound is amazing...
B0088O11NU|4.0|This is a good game, but maybe a little on the touchy side when it comes to tilting my kindle to move the ball around.
B001EOQWFI|4.0|Yeah, this is a great movie, I dunno if it fitswell with the kids, not because of the content, it's because ofthe rythm, it start slow and some kidswill find this boring.<br />But if yourkids are like ine or like me... lots of fun and a nice story.<br />Picture and audio quality is perfect!
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|A fantastic and long-awaited return to Middle Earth courtesy of Peter Jackson.  The casting is superb, the sets absorbing and the vistas extraordinary. For the movie's detractors: yes Jackson stretches the story and takes some liberties with Tolkien's book but they don't detract from the overall plot (in fact they bring some of the back-story of the book to the front) and are probably necessary to make the jump from print to the screen.  In fact, those familiar with the Lord of the Rings trilogy will recognize Jackson did the same with the preceding movies: altered the story to make it more engaging for film.  In all, a great movie.
B00133KHCY|5.0|This bluray I got becasue I couldn't find one with decent sound in my country. Could you imagine it? a musical movie like this with only 2.0 stereo sound? Of course I got this on bluray because I wanted all the music, all the detailsand the wonderful story.<br /><br />Great gift!
B0027MJU00|5.0|Gillian Flynn is an outstanding writer. I have enjoyed both of her books and can't wait for more. She keeps my attention from from the first page to the last.
B002ZG99A4|5.0|You like action like it's 1986?<br />Well this is your movie! Heroes and villains, not a big story, just an excuse to kick some butt!<br />Bring explosions to life with the amazing sound.<br />Secureyour socks, or this bad boy will rock them off!!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris Kyle was a hero and will be greatly missed! May God bless his family and all the brave men who stand in his place in our military!
B002ZG9846|5.0|Yeah real heroes exist, superheroes? only if you can make some super aactions, like this guy.<br />Based on the comic that I liked in it's time and well acted. Full of action and wait a sec parents! it's not for your kids.<br />It looks great and it sounds excellent!
B001NLKZUA|4.0|There is a feeling of watching a train wreck happening and not being able to tear your eyes away from the excitement and tragedy about to unfold .
B005LAII80|5.0|Sorry Sly, but Karl Urban is Dredd. Hands down.<br />Excellent story, some great effects and some not so good -damn you CGI-, thos bluray will be on your players' tray a lot!<br />You have to listen to that magnificent sound, really!<br />The picture quality is great and will not disappoint, but man...<br /><br />DAT SOUND!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Great Movie! The cast is great and the acting was incredible. Ben Affleck, John Goodman just to name a couple...
B001M5UDGS|5.0|It's short, yes.<br />But you will laugh a lot. It's geeky, and it's cheeky, with some extras too.<br />Know the man behind the plan, a horrible plan!
B005CRQ3RK|4.0|Very creative and nice job on writing this book.My favorite part was when his pants fell down.I am going to read all your diary of a wimpy kid books.
B00BE47LTY|5.0|This book is a masterpiece.  I have had it for about 3 years without reading it.  Now that the movie Lincoln has come out and I have heard it is based upon this book, I decided to finally read it before seeing the movie.  It is totally absorbing.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|a wondeful series. i think it make spook some ypounger children but overall superb.  This will be years from now  a classic!!!!;
0307272702|1.0|First the book arrived without a cover.<br />second, when I began reading the book.....  I found the reading to be TOO technical.<br /><br />it is NOT an easy read.<br />I ended up throwing the book out :-(<br /><br />SM in Colorado 03/15/13
B0001CNRB6|5.0|this is a great family movie. Great actors and talent This is a classic and you do not have to worry about what the kids see and hear. Too bad they don't make fun movied like this anymore with actors that have talent instead of special effects
B008QE9XD2|5.0|I laughed thru out the whole movie.... its a GREAT buy!<br />You will have a blast watching this wonderful movie!
B001QMCJ1Y|5.0|But it's nice to have for the special features as well.  Very well done.  I was surprised at how many of the things that were in the movie were in fact based on reality.  Great story!
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I loved both season one and two.  Season two is a little less exciting than season one, but the story builds like mad.  My husband was slightly disappointed comparing it with season one, however we were watching 1-2 episodes an evening, and were finished with the whole season in about a week.  We are obsessed.  If you like fantasy & period stories you will LOVE this.  It has everything sex, violence, incest, power struggles, betrayal, kindness in unexpected places and familial love... like I said, everything.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was surprised that I absolutely loved this book, as it wasn't my typical genre. I couldn't put it down! Well worth it!
B0000026UV|4.0|Two of the best, entertaining each other and us. Good music BUT it is pretty durn short on playing time.
B00AO686MY|2.0|If I were reviewing the movie it would get 5 stars, A+, two thumbs up. But I am writing this in regards to the blu ray release. So it gets two stars, C-, no thumbs.<br /><br />This release has ZERO new extras from the DVD release from 10 years ago. No effort put into making it for the fans of the movie and no real benefits from the blu ray capabilities. The movie looks good, no complaints there. But there is so much more they could have done, and seeing a lot of blu ray releases of old movies have a lot of time and effort put into them (Casablanca, North by Northwest, Jaws ect) we know they could have but decided to be cheap. You dont even get the Benny the Cab menu that was on the DVD.<br /><br />The DVD version in this combo pack is a fullscreen version, and no talk on if they will correct this or just let it go. Thankfully if you have the old DVD Collectors Edition, disc 2 is all in Widescreen, including the special features. There was a good amount of effort put into that 10 years ago. I wish at least half that effort was put into this one.<br /><br />They could have done better.
B00000IZOR|5.0|my 1 yr old niece loves this toy and i do too. had one as a child and glad to pass on the family tradition
B0063FUOGG|5.0|For me, it's a discovery of John le Carr&eacute;. I'm not a spy novel enthousiast but this book made me want to read some more. What struck me with the style is the fine detail of British life and its civil service environment. Being a bit familiar with that service, it gave me a new perspective on the in-fighting between individuals and agencies. The spy world here has nothing glamourous similar to the Bond movies (and books). I've recommended it to friends.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|The TED app allows me to check out TED talks whenever I want.  Definitely a brain builder.  Would suggest to those folks who love podcasts and audiobooks and love learning about innovative ideas.

B0054SMIH6|4.0|great plot & interesting predicament, and ingeneous solution to moral dilemma. A few interesting characters. Would like to see more movies featuring the main character.
B005I6EU7U|4.0|I got it and i really like it and what not, and i got exactly what i expected and wanted out of it, but i just can't give it 5 stars.<br />the packaging says it fits the nook... it fits in there, but barely.  this thing isn't going to protect it at all.  but i didn't buy it for the protection at all.  i bought it because i was bored and it looked cool.  that and i keep reading that at first it doesn't want to close all the way... i'm slightly concerned it never will for mine.  But in the end even that's ok, because it still looks wicked awesome.  so yeah.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Fantastic and inspiring. This book shows the depths of the spirit, and how even in the worst circumstances, a jolting experience can bring someone back to a positive existence.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I found it to be very interesting. I will be recommending this game to all my friends who enjoy the seek games!
B005JR47R6|5.0|The whole final season of HOUSE was fairly miraculous.  Lisa whatever-her-name-is who played Cutty was missed -- how stupid of the actress not to make a deal to appear in the final season -- but the writers were extraordinarily creative and true to House's character to the end.  The final episode was heartbreaking and satisfying.  Bravo to the staff and actors who breathed life into this long-running series and gave us endless hours of intelligent dialogue, clever storytelling and fascinating relationships.
0375869026|5.0|\\"Wonder\\" (Knopf 2012) by R.J. Palacio is the story of August who has a radically deformed face--no ears, his eyes at cheek level, a cleft palate which has required numerous surgeries. He's smart and funny, but you can almost imagine the torture he endures from children and adults both, especially when he starts school for the first time in the fifth grade.<br />Early in the book August resists having to go to school. He says, \\"I miss being a baby, not knowing stuff.\\" Innocence is blissful--particularly for August.<br />August tells his story, but so do others, deepening and widening the reader's understanding of August's life and the many lives he affects. Some voices are of fellow fifth graders.<br />Summer befriends August. She doesn't think he looks so scary.<br />Jack, on the request of the principal, befriends August. Jack forgets about August's odd appearance and they seem to be friends. But his painful betrayal feels true to life.<br />August's older sister, Via, 14, just starting high school, adores August. But how complicated it is to always have to make sacrifices for him. His problems are always bigger than hers and he always gets more attention from their parents. She understands this, of course, but sometimes she needs attention, too.<br />Via's ex-friend, Miranda, cherished August when they were younger, but now she's moved on to have friends other than Via, which is hard for both Via and August.<br />Via's new boyfriend sheds light on August's loving family and makes the reader see that, yes, things are rough for August, but people adore him in a way most people aren't adored. He says, \\"The universe takes care of all its birds.\\" It's hard not to love these characters.<br />Both family and school scenes feel authentic. There's no cuteness. The author understands feelings, their subtleties, and when our behaviors surprise us, especially in adolescence. We don't always know why we act as we do, but we can feel the consequent emotion immediately--for instance, shame.<br />Mr. Browne, the English teacher, asks his students to observe monthly precepts. September's precept: Given the choice between being right or kind, choose kind. This story, without being pedantic, is the perfect anti-bullying book.

B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|I got this app for my 18 year old to try. We both tried it and the movements are horrible and it tries to make you walk backwards most of the time. So like all aweful games I uninstalled it. later it showed back up on my carousal haunting me. I keep trying to remove the app but it sayss there is no app to remove. So now I have no app just a creepy slender man virus that keeps popping up on my kindle.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Great read, couldn't put it down. Can't wait to read the next one.  Highly recommended!<br /><br />Hope the other books are as exciting.
B00AK0X5VQ|1.0|As I was reading through the reviews I could not wait to play this game. When it finally downloaded I started it played for awhile it's to hard for me. It told me to plug my headphones in and I about fell asleep. If you go through the reviews you'll notice they don't have bad reviews because they don't want them. But to me I like having some bad reviews so I know what to expect.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Love this app! Very accurate, and great hour by hour tracking.  Easy to look up weather from another area if you are going to be traveling too!
B0087JTAKW|4.0|Started out depressing as I am now middle aged it really made me look at time wasted and that was depressing. Ending was good.
B00338QF0U|4.0|Great story telling, gripping and full of tension. Leaves the reader hanging as one wonders how Adam will navigate through all of his lies.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I really didn't think I would be watching this however, a young girl told me about Downton Abby and it peaked my interest. I watched season one on netflix and came to amazon streaming for season two. I thoroughly enjoy the story of the people of Downton and will be recommending this to my sisters who will love this also. I have purchased season three and am watching it now. I highly recommend this to those who enjoy a drama and a love story rolled together.
1439153663|1.0|Bought this book because a friend recommended it so highly.  I was hoping for a story interesting as the HELP novel was.  It was one horror after another.  When the story finally redeemed itself it was too late.  Will not recommend it to my reading group.
B005K01VZS|5.0|I couldn't stop reading this beautiful and heart warming book. And I know that it will resonate in my mind for a long time.
1400052181|5.0|This book is hard to put down! It is a fascinating bit of history in more ways than one- both for those curious about medical history and science and for those interested in a real life look into civil rights and the plight of people of colour earlier last century. Brilliantly written and well researched.
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|This movie was an unknown to me. Never heard of it.  Never read about it in any movie reviews.  But this is an incredible movie from beginning to end.  Any one with ties to Philly, A.C., the Marines, to teachers, to down-on-their luck brothers and dads, will connect to this movie.  It is a must see for MMA fans too!  Loved it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have been playing computer solitaire for years and this is a good one. It has many options in the menu that surpasses Windows version and you can't beat the price.
0061950726|5.0|Any time I have heard of the orphan trains that took  children from places like New York city out west to find them families has been fascinating to me. Many of them however, seemed too unreal with all the children ending up in great homes with those that grow to love them. This book seemed to take a much more realistic view of what happened or could have happened. While the babies are snapped up by childless couples, the older boys were thought of as farm laborers and well frankly the girls supposedly weren't much good for anything. This book focuses on Niamh, Dorothy or Vivian whose named changed as she changed locations and families who was a young girl on the orphan train. Then comparisons in her life was drawn in many ways with a foster child named Molly almost 100 years later. Both Vivian and Molly were great characters who just wanted to be accepted and loved for who they are. While this was a fiction book, it felt in many ways like a very good biography. It was a very interesting and good book to read.
B009FZFONO|5.0|The Walking Dead is an amazing show and even better in HD! I was so happy i could catch up on season 3.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|It's fun, but I don't like the ads, it has glitches that slow it down, and I think it needs to have some more stuff, it gets kind of being after awhile.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is amazing! I had some My Little Pony toys when I was young and now they have a TV series on the Hub. And now I have the game. So fun! &#9733;
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is well written and very enjoyable. The story is harsh and breaks your heart. It's so good though.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|The most common complaint I've heard about this movie is &#34;not enough time spent in the games I used to love&#34;. It is true that the majority of the movie takes place in fictional games made up for the movie. But their clear roots in existing games (Donkey Kong, Mario Kart, to name a couple..) combined with good writing made this a movie I'll revisit over the years.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Very interesting, well written, and extremely insightful.  The author does an excellent job of explaining habits and how they affect our lives, and how they can be changed.  Terrific scientific research, easy to understand, and very applicable to our everyday lives.  Highly recommend the book.
B009JZVT70|5.0|This series is so refreshing.  It is such a change from the same old shows that are always on TV.  And from the depressing zombie craze the world seems to be in right now.  I love that it is something so unique and stands completely on it's own.  I've never seen a show like it.  At first I thought it was a &#34;mom&#34; show, but my 8 year old son loves it and even my 14 year old son will walk through the room and freeze in place to watch it with us.  Every show ends with a cliffhanger which keeps us wanting more.  Tastefully done and wonderful family entertainment.  I am not afraid to have the whole family enjoy it, but it is so well written that I am glued to the screen. Love, love, love it!!!!
1400052181|5.0|Doctors took her cells without asking and the medical industry made multi-millions of dollars and her children never even knew how famous their mother was, and they never profited a dime from it.  These cells, that were taken,. became the most important tools in medicine; vital for developing the polio vaccine, cloning, gene mapping and more.  Scientists know these cells as HeLa cells.<br />The author, Rebecca Skloot, has a way of telling Henrietta's story so that you believe you know her, and her family, personally.  I recommend this book for anyone who thinks that they are in control.  It will leave you wondering what really happened to your last lab tests?
B006LSZECO|3.0|I could have done better with less obscene language ... come on. Does not anyone get that the f-word is fast becoming one to add to the overdone, overused, boring list? A cliche? It is a good impact word, but like an exclamation point, needs to be used sparingly or the punch is gone. We need to grow up.  Dirty words do not a good, well written story make. Cannot recommend without giving a heads up. Great story otherwise.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I wanted to read this book after learning that the Spielberg film, Lincoln, was based on this biography.  It was far better than I had hoped.  One comes away with a far greater understanding of the greatness of Lincoln and the era he defined. The depth of research combined with her beautiful writing style brought this era to life for me.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|Very seldom do you see a sequel that matches the original.So if you enjoyed the first EXPENDABLES you will enjoy this one as much if not more.They added alot of action stars like Arnold,Bruce,and Chuck with Van Damm as the bad guy a different role for him.Just goes to show you that geratol is making a comeback.These guys do a very very good job
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|this season has some real shockers! Lots of tear jerkers episodes and interesting stuff happening in this season. Highly recommend!
B005LAIIPS|5.0|Don't get me wrong this was not a bad movie and i am not knocking the new guy by any means.It's just Matt Damon nailed that role like he was made for the part.When you think of Bourne you think of Matt Damon.J.R. does a great job and keeps the action moving making it a entertaining movie but you still wonder where Bourne is at.
0061251321|4.0|There's a lot of home truths in here. I don't know about the strict, formal use of the various levels of team greatness which are used here, but it does illustrate signs of productive or unhealthy team dynamics and some strategies to assist.
1577314808|4.0|A few years ago my roommate gave me a copy of the book, \\"The Power of Now-A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment\\". It seemed to come into my life at a time when I needed.  This book offers a great basic understanding of the conscious self and being. These two concepts tie in with enlightenment which emphasizes rising above thought.  It helped me to freeing myself from my mind which can be the center of anxiety and depression arising from an unconscious thought. The book explains that the mind is actually an instrument or a tool that we use for a specific task, and when the task is complete, I can lay it down. This is the key to true liberation.<br />Once I grasped of that concept, it allowed me to free myself from the past, and the future. True consciousness is the way out of pain which is often caused by dwelling on the past or future.  The book repeatedly drives home the point that nothing exists outside of the present moment.  I learned that the past is only a memory and the future is only an illusion; a projection of the mind.  I realize that by staying centered in the here and now I will have a much happier life and the future will take care of itself. Another concept discussed in the book that helped me greatly is acceptance. I try to practice this on a daily basis and find a way to accept things over which I have I have no control and not go beyond that.  I also try not allowing resentment to build within me, knowing that the only one who suffers from it is the one who carries it.<br />I highly recommend this book and when you read it, read it slowly allowing the words to sink in. It gave me a much better understanding of my life and I try to apply this book to my daily decisions.
1594481717|5.0|It seems that, in the past we have favoured left brain thinking and those who deal in facts figures and logic. Our success has depended on it; even our prognostic tests for future achievement have been geared to it. However current global trends are indicating an increasing our need to tap into right brain thinking and an inability to do so will be our undoing... but don't believe me, read the book.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|I thought this was a really different type of movie and the special effects were so real.<br />The message was good and i enjoyed it completely!
B004DM0UII|5.0|I use this app for 10 hours a  day for 4 days a week and never have a problem... Listen to the blast Christian rock
B00942G4UA|5.0|I thought this was really well done and I think everyone should see it.<br />We need to know more about where our food is coming from and this movie really covers alot of ground.
B00009L1OB|1.0|This is their worst work. These songs seem written for cartoons. Overrated by many for nostalgia. they are infinitely better in the nineties...
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|its a fun relaxing game. i love find and seek games. this one can behard attimes. but is still a great game.
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|I would recommend this fun free video for your kindle.  I use it all the time and works wonderfully.  Try it out!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This as a fun game to occupy your mind. You can not ask for much more in a free app.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I had such a wonderful time playing this game. I recommend it to anyone who is addicted to hidden object games like I am. The graphics are very good. The puzzles are just. Challenging to be fun but not so hard to become frustrating. The storyline was strong and only got better the more you played. The free play was amazing but you will want to buy the game to find out what comes next. The bonus chapter was great and had a wonderful ending. Older kids will have loads of fun playing it too. Happy hunting and enjoy.
1250027624|5.0|I chose this book because I love the show Downton Abbey. I have the first book and wanted the second one. It is as the seller stated, came on time, and I enjoy reading it.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|... freezes too often &amp; graphics could be more realistic.<br />The kids seem to enjoy other apps better. 12 &amp; 14 respectfully.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|There is a lot of games out there but this one is great I really love this game you should get it to
B004I2K4E8|5.0|Amazing show, for the musical lovers and opera fans, the voices and the audio is so clean and lovely songs too, best performance so far
B00028HBKM|5.0|I think it's a great movie! I don't think it's quite captures what really happened but it definitely gives you the idea. when  I watch this film it really does something to me. I truly am unworthy. he suffered a great deal, completely innocent man died,for all of us sinners how amazing is that? and yet people reject him. if you've been born again, when you read the Word of God especially the story, you see those words you so often read, on the screen, in a picture form that you can not help but crying and begin to pray. giving thanks for something that is so undeserved the sacrifice and grace that's been given
0345803493|5.0|this book is women only.  my wife read it and I thought the book was great.  it was gooooood! word
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Good action movie, but no mention of President Reagan who played an important part in the released of hostages.  Thanks.
0345803485|5.0|Fifty shades of grey is not for the prudes. It is a low down filthy, sexy erotic novel that will keep your mind on sex night and day.<br />Be prepared for wet dreams, non stop sweaty four hour erection sex.  Your partner will think you have become a sex addict. If you don't have a partner you wil be growing hair on your palms from non stop masturbation.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|this game is really fun and if you didn't download it you should. its kinda hard in the beginning but then its easy
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Absolutely love this show! It is a perfect combination of a drama that has an edge of humor. The characters are riveting to watch and I live Katy Segal as the head Mother figure to a group of intensly serious motorcycle men. The violence is intense but makes it believable and scary as you never know what to expect. I wish season 5 was free on Amazon Prime as well. Can't wait to start it!
B005ZUR724|5.0|Excellent game. Very good graphics and ape dial effects. Easy controls .quests are well described and not a pay constantly to play
B00A4AI17A|4.0|This box is certainly a bargain, and many libretti are available online with translations, even it would be more convenient to have a CD-ROM or a site for downloads.  There are at least four absolutely top-tier recordings in here, for my taste, the Giulini Don Carlo and Karajan Otello have always been first choices; the Karajan Falstaff is quite good, and the Levine Giovanna d'Arco is pretty much one of two good recordings out there.  My only serious quibble is a minor one, and that is that much emphasis is put on Muti (half of the operas presented) and while a fine conductor, especially for Verdi, often he is in his \\"come scritto\\" phase.  This is more a matter of knowing before you go in so that you don't expect a high C at the end of \\"O mio rimorso\\" from Alfredo Kraus, even though he was definitely capable of it; Verdi didn't write it and you won't hear it here.  I am probably least fond of the Alagna Trovatore (the voices of the leads just feel a size or two too small for the roles) but it acquits itself fairly well.  For the price you absolutely can't go wrong with this, or the Decca set.  Only one overlap between the two as well, which is the I vespri Siciliani, since the only other good recording is on RCA and therefore not available for either company to put in a boxed set.  Maybe we could get an RCA/Sony Verdi set for some of those wonderful recordings from the 50s, 60s, and 70s?
B009KS4XRO|5.0|it's an awesome game, i love to play as often as possible and maybe don't spend enough time getting my work done at home. i reccomend it to everyone.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Mumford & Sons' poetry set to music is a feast for the soul!  It is refreshing to experience this work of art when we all are bombarded with sub par and studio artists every day.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This game is amazing and in depth. You better BUY this game for the 2.99  they want. Easily worth the investment. BUUUUUUUUUY NOOOOOOOOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I read many of these type books. This is absolutely one of the best. Chris Kyle was one of the best. A true patriot. He will be missed.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I can't believe thats all we get...could of gone to book four.  This book keeps you in the loop.  You'll love it.
B00AX7PGQS|5.0|Holy Motors was my favorite film of 2012.  A tour de force by Leos Carax. Denis Lavant playing 11 characters: A ratty gnome from the sewers who kidnaps supermodel Eva Mendez, a beggar woman, a man-lizard engaged in intercourse, an assassin who has to murder himself and an accordionist leader of a rogue band to name a few.<br /><br />One minute we're in the throes of heavy drama or comical melodrama, followed by absurd comedy, then horror and more comedy.. An impromptu accordion romp, video game alien sex, Edith Scob reprising her role in Eyes without a Face, talking white limousines, penile prosthetics, Kylie Minogue's nod to Jean Seberg, a musical number, chimpanzee children, doppelgangers and more...<br /><br />all this dancing around an adroit commentary on Social Media, the Facebook generation, technology & sexual disconnection. I guarantee you will not find a more inventive film this year or maybe this decade.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Wow!  I'm not a reader and this book kept me wanting more...Now I need to read book number three...Ooh..yes I just fininshed it too.
B000TU16GS|4.0|I like the start of this book because it gives the reader the idea that this story would have a lot of action within it. I was right.
B000MAH5O2|5.0|Read it over and over! Excellent read.  Very insightful and gives a glimpse of how he would be as a president.  Everything he stands for today are in this book.
B000TO0TCQ|5.0|This book really gave me the background of Alex and it really helps me understand the MI6 and how the government is only here to protect their Nation.
B001KPYNR0|5.0|I love Enya's music and this was a great addition to my winter/Christmas music.  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys Enya.
B000TO0T4O|5.0|This was the most exciting book I ever read. I is really amazing. My favorite part was when Alex stopped Kasper from killing him and destroying Washington.
B00459EZLW|5.0|After completing the series, a lively discussion in how to &#34;revive&#34; the series ensued. We brainstormed plot continuations and in essence came up with several more seasons for the series. Too bad it was cancelled after only two seasons.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Very interesting and well told, not gripping but a very satisfying read, i hope the horrors were made up but unlikely
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game...I have been waiting for a horse game like this with such good graphics for a long time...finally. :)
B001684L0A|5.0|My boyfriend loves this movie series and now that we have an HD TV he is loving the quality of having it on a Blu-ray.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Bruno Mars is a very talented artist and his music proves it! All songs are great to listen any time of day.
0062014536|3.0|I love the first book in the trilogy.  The second book was ok.  I was really looking forward to this book.  I read this in less than two days and am really disappointed.  The story is good, but the ending is severely lacking.  When I read the last book in a series, I expect some sort of \\"closure\\".  This was left too open-ended.  I feel like the author just simply ended the book a few chapters too soon.  What happens to Hana?  Does the love triangle with Lena, Alex and Julian get resolved?  Your guess is as good as mine.  Soooo disappointed in the end.
B006LS7DQE|4.0|This games takes the typical match 3 jewel stuff, adds the ability to cast spells from the collected jewels, and to injure your  &#34;opponent&#34; by matching up skulls, and then it tops it off with RPG elements, such as the ability to walk around and explore, purchase weapons, armor, upgrades, etc. I loved this game; I played it through using all three characters, so I would consider it to have good replay value.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Loved this movie! Watched it with my 17 year-old daughter and 9 year-old son who both loved it as did my wife and I. It is entertaining and uplifting with plenty of action. Wonderful character development along the way. It definitely got my vote for the Academy Award.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this game!! Real life motion , and very entertaining!! I only wish that I was able to get gems a lot faster!
B001OGPTZ0|5.0|\\"Purple\\" is a classic CD. Every song on here is great. This STP album includes the hit singles,\\"Big Empty\\",\\"Vaseline\\",\\"Interstate Love Song\\" and \\"Unglued\\". The other songs are just as great as well. The hidden track is hillarious. If you love 90s alternative rock,then this CD is for.
B003U9W3GM|5.0|It's one of the best war books I have ever read. It completes the view of that operation I know from tv.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I have been playing the demo and so far I really like it. The only negative is it kept asking for a rating. I will update my review as soon as I get farther in the game.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|Heroes series deals with unexplained super natural powers. This series deals with explainable scientific super power. Different flavors of similar content. I liked both of them.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so much fun and truthly I like this better then temple run.and I think that a lot of people will like this game.
B00B7H3OFI|5.0|I bought this album because I'm a huge Joe Bonamassa fan.<br /><br />If you're expecting the typical Joe jams and solos then don't buy this.  However, if you're looking for an updated and awesome take on funk and jazz fusion then click purchase now.<br /><br />As you listen through the tracks the album starts VERY strong - hits a little bit of a lull around mid point - then finishes just as strong as it starts.  World class musicians making world class music.  Enjoy.
B004SBULWE|4.0|Allows you to terminate apps running in the background and saves battery power.  And it's absolutely free.  What a deal.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Better than the original and we played the heck out of that.  All the new features we were hoping for are part of two. Stop reading this silly review and hit buy already.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I am very pleased with this alarm clock it has everything nice tunes to wake you up how the weather outside is and the best part is , is that it's free !!!!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I don't need a calculator often, but when I do, this one is great. The keys are large and easy to use.
B008VBYN80|5.0|I love this game so much I would recommend it to everyone I know. I've always wanted to be a princess.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It is 4:30 am and finishing this book .  It was a unusual story from start to finish.  Thank you Ms. COLLINS
B00003CXBK|5.0|This was the very first product I bought here on Amazon and I must say I love the service and the product itself.<br />I had watched this movie numerous of times but I could never find this movie anywhere and so I was recommended into trying to buy it online here on Amazon.<br /><br />I had doubts about buying products online because of the fact that there are some companies that just don't give you the right quality of the product or they just ripped you off the spot like some companies (or so I heard).<br /><br />And so one day I was looking around Amazon, out of curiosity, and I happen to find this movie and on top of it... a reasonable, cheap price! So I just took the chance and bought it right on the spot!<br /><br />Next two weeks or so, I received my package and it was &#34;Princess Mononoke&#34;. Excited as I was I played it on my DVD player and it was exactly what I not expected. The movie was excellent (meaning I bought it in &#34;good condition&#34; &#34;decent condition&#34;) the subtitles are excellent! It really blown me away!<br /><br />Of course the movie was PERFECTION itself. No doubt about it.<br />If you never seen this movie... then you are missing out! This is a MUST see movie that every animation lover must see. Consider yourself not a fan if you have not seen this movie, it is that GREAT.<br /><br />To finish this review, I will continue to buy my products online and you can trust AMAZON.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love Love Love this game! There are plenty of levels & boards to work through and it really does exercise the brain. I play this every night on my Kindle Fire and am almost done with the 14x14 boards...this is especially effective for the 'racing mind' insomniac. It does a terrific job of quieting & focusing my thoughts.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is a moving account of one man's near death experience.  The writing style is captivating from the very first page and it moves along quickly with no slow spots.  Written by a medical doctor who clearly knows how to communicate with the layman, it tells a story that is both uplifting and reassuring about Dr. Alexander's visit to heaven -- the great beyond.  Proof of Heaven is a great read and a reassuring experience.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|THE SON'S OF ANARCHY JUST KEEP GETTING BETTER AND BETTER WITH EVERY SEASON.....Even though the movie depict's a lifestyle of corruption, THE SON'S also show a level of morality that is quite unexpected.... WELL WORTH OWNING!!
B000JMKTLO|3.0|Well written, but the story is very dark. I didn't like this as much as Gone Girl. I would not recommend it to most people, but I did love the writing even if the story line was a bit gruesome.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I have not been this profoundly moved by a book in a very long time. Rachel Joyce is such a gentle storyteller! I am glad she has chosen to write for us and wait with anticipation for her next novel. Simply brilliant!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gillian Flynn is an excellent writer. I loved everything about this book except the ending. I just finished reading her first book, Sharp Objects, which I did not like as much. I would definitely recommend this novel.
B007F8TZ8I|5.0|Lets face it; this show is deeply terrible.  Cheesey, melodramatic, completely unrealistic.  But god help me, I just can't get enough.  I'm not sure why, but I just really like to watch re-runs of this show with a glass of wine and cry.  Chalk it up to weird female hormones, or Jennifer Love Hewitt's infernal adorableness, I don't know.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Excellent game! Thank you. It's a great pass time. It does take patience waiting to get your energy saved up to go to the competitions though.
B008M34CSI|3.0|That about sums it up.  This is not great theater.  When you have a free afternoon or a couple of hours, it is a good diversion.
0375413405|5.0|Made my Sister very happy.  She was drooling for this after seeing Julie and Julia... great book with some lovely recipes in it.  Also some crazy weird french stuff too like lambs brains, yikes!
B0088RQ4TI|4.0|I liked this movie; okay film. It was fun and not given its due by the national critics.  It not a great piece of cinema but most films aren't.  This is just good fun.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Another wonderful book from the hunger games trilogy.  I loved it!  A really great end with lots of excitement and unexpected turns.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This was a very enjoyable story due to the pure science involved and the well written story line. Enjoyed the premise and the little explanations along the way.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|I continue to love the action as in all the James Bond films, but am especially impressed with the &#34;new&#34; Bond as played by Daniel Craig and the more modern twists to these plots. I never thought anyone could replace Sean Connery and this James is indeed different, but he's very good.
B004XUMPFQ|5.0|I enjoyed all the original episodes as they aired, and like many, wished they could have continued.<br /><br />Re-watching it once again after all those years made me realize it was EVEN BETTER THAN I HAD REMEMBERED!!! Pure genius, Josh, cast, and crew, one and all!!!<br /><br />This blu-ray set definitely earns a treasured spot in my collection! What more needs said :)
B00BLGZDVS|2.0|We gave up after 45 minutes. Acting was good but the story dragged in my opinion. Perhaps I should have given it more time, but I thought 45 minutes was plenty of time to discover whether or not I should continue.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Easy to use! I love the search tool and the notification tool! Works easily on The Kindle Fire! Easy to create your listing!
B00AEJM6H2|3.0|Its your matching game and it does it well.  Quick in/out fun. Tried and true formula, doesn't try to add anything new.  So what you expect is what you get, and that's not a bad thing.
B0009RCPY8|5.0|I was extremely excited when I found this deal! My daughter has been wanting Ghostbusters for awhile now which we can't find in stores in our area. I can't wait to give this to her! Still brand new as shown, both movies and a booklet! I can't wait to see her face!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|A most excellent race along the surf with bodacious graphics, bombshell physics,  riptide motion, gnarly challenge, and plenty of fun.  Don't get sunburned out there!
B009NPK1IO|5.0|I'm a huge gossip girl fan but I missed the 6hat could tth season, i figured to wait for netflix but that could take months!! So I bought this season and I loved it!! I also love how it had an amazing ending to n amazing series
B00123IAHO|4.0|I love all the old stuff. building my library. I bought the movie too. This was a greatest time for music
B009FZHYKU|2.0|I loved this show in season 1. I had issues with Season 2, and with Season 3, I find myself saying at the end of every new episode, &#34;I'm not watching this crap anymore.&#34;<br /><br />The show has the feel of producers who are trying to draw out the storyline, focusing on the painful, excruciating details to tell instead of the bigger picture stories. It's not that the show is dark, I like dark, but they are focusing the story on so much emotion, most of which doesn't make sense. Emotions that cripple a character during one episode are completely not a factor in the next episode.<br /><br />AMC ruined my favorite show when the executives of AMC couldn't keep their hands off and allow Frank Darabont to do what he does best - Make thrilling, compelling adventures for people who like that stuff. This is the guy who partially wrote, directed, and produced The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, and The Mist - not everyone's cup of tea, but masterpieces to those who love Stephen King thrillers.
0545265355|5.0|Just got the book set today,cant wait to start reading those books. Even though I already read the first book on my ibook app. I would read it all over again.
B0031KE9C6|4.0|Smartly written series, that is a lot grittier then many would suspect. Enrico Colantoni of &#34;Just Shoot Me&#34; is one of my favorites and fits in perfectly as Veronica's ex cop, private eye father. They make a better team than Batman and Robin.
B004XANKVO|5.0|I live and work overseas.  Every 3 months I travel for R&R.  I just recently purchased a Macbook Pro.  I wanted something that would protect it while I was traveling.  This definitely does the trick.  It has great padding inside and is more then large enough to fit my Mac and the rest of my electronics.  It easily holds, my Beats pill, Headphones, Ipad, sunglasses, 3  2TB portable HD's, sweater, travel pillow, Macbook Pro, and still had plenty of room. The hard case is great for holding my sunglasses and I dont worry that they might get crushed or broken.  It also has a nice felt liner inside of it.  The straps are comfortable and easily adjusted.  Definitely worth every penny.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Its awesome and way better graphics than the first! And when u die, there's better and non dumb-looking guys heres a note, BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|car version of subway surfers. I qm mad with the coins. I like the game but it takes a long time to level up... : (
B0044C5SCU|5.0|This is a fun show and they manage to keep it fresh and unpredictable.  There are always two stories running simultaneously, the back story about all of the characters and then they always have some new Fringe case to solve.  I always look forward to the next episode.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|This is so great. Transaction are smooth and process easily.  Love my Kindle.  Amazon you rock.  You make it so simple.
B004LP601S|5.0|Great songs; I would say a mix of A fever you can't sweat out mixed with pretty.odd. Love this cd overall; awsome band.^_^
B009GEFXLC|5.0|This is so great. Transaction are smooth and process easily.  Love my Kindle.  Amazon you rock.  You make it so simple.
B009O2XY12|5.0|I love this game. It is fun and challenging and exciting to make it to the next level.  I can do this for hours and never get bored.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|This season is just as nail biting as the last season.  I don't think I can wait for next year!
B000JMKTLO|4.0|The neuroses of the main character help you stay engaged in the story. The characters and the main location are well rounded and realistically complicated. For me, the way the ending is written (stylistically different than the rest of the book) was a little rushed.<br /><br />Good read all in all.
B004OZOTSQ|1.0|I've tried this download on 3 different computers with 3 different android tablets.  The app just doesn't work, The designer is very friendly and courteous when you call him about the non functioning app.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really like the options that this free version has.  I can change the side that the draw deck is on when I'm lying in bed so it's more convenient.  I like that it allows me to pick if I want a winning deal or not.  It's easier to put it down when it's time for bed if you've just won a hand.  It also has a feature to teach you how to win.  I play it every day.
B00594XOZU|4.0|Good!!! Very fast messenger. The best part about it is the fact that it is an OFFLINE interactive messenger! :p
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wonderfully done. Makes you want to keep coming back. A joy for all ages. We would recommend this show to anyone who likes the idea of coming back for more.
B005C8ENI0|4.0|Love that Matthew McConaughey. Suspenseful & action packed. Would recommend it to friend. So watch it & see what YOU think!!!!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|We have enjoyed watching all seasons of this show. It's great how the staff is just as interesting as the family who lives here. It will keep you coming back for more.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|He just keeps getting better while undeniably staying true to what he does best--finding the boogeyman wherever he is.  Bravo.
B0062NAX1U|4.0|After seeing this movie elsewhere I bought this so it can be shared with other men - there usually seems to be a period of silence after it ends.
0525478817|5.0|Truly inspiring and beautifully written. This book is fantastic. Any book written by John Green is absolutely worth reading. I love John Green.
B0085W09ME|1.0|I downloaded this for a trip I'm taking where multiple airline accommodations are needed. As everyone, I was looking for the best airline ticket price. I thought I'd give this a shot and see what he brought up against the competitors, knowing that if it wasn't worth it, I could just delete it from my kindle which is what I did, immediately. Prices for the flights we were looking at were $400-$500 each for the lowest prices listed with this app. When checking other major websites such as kayak.com or others like it, we found tickets for $120 which is a substantial difference. We ended up ordering our tickets though the cheapest and most reputable place, not Skyscanner, and have no need for this app. You can find them cheaper, no matter what they advertise. Not worth the look or download!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was indeed a good read.  It will leave you wanting for more.  When I was reading I couldn't help but think about fifty shades of grey.
B004EWEX9Y|5.0|What a great way to spend an evening with friends and family. No worries about losing the DVD. you can put anything on the TV from the iPad or iPhone. Plus you can charge your device while using it. OUTSTANDING!
0765334798|2.0|Forewarning: I'm a spoiler purist, and so try to avoid spoilers as much as possible in my reviews, including basic information about both plot and characters. As a result, my reviews are somewhat vague, but I try my best to keep things spoiler-free.<br /><br />I picked up \\"Redshirts\\" in a local bookstore because I recognised Scalzi's name. I hadn't read any of his other work, and figured it would be as good a place to start as any. Unfortunately, it's just not my thing. While \\"Redshirts\\" is a quick and easy read, and enjoyable on some levels, it's just not the type of book I generally like.<br /><br />\\"Redshirts\\" is focused exclusively on plot. From the beginning through to the end, from introduction through to set-up and resolution, the narrative is focused on plot events. Although I've seen other reviewers unhappy with the premise, I thought it was original and clever, but could probably have worked better if it had been extended a bit further. There are some points where the reasoning about why things happened didn't work for me, but Scalzi probably did enough to get away with it.<br /><br />Despite that, I didn't really like this book that much, for the following two reasons:<br /><br />1) The lack of characterisation. While this will please people who prefer a strictly plot-oriented story, I really disliked it, even with a kind of half-hearted explanation late in the story. My problem is this: all the characters are essentially the same. (And I hate writing that, because it irritates me when I see it elsewhere.) The characters all speak and act the same, have the same types of reactions, have broadly similar personalities, and their friendships with other characters are all made from the same mould. There's no character development, bar one secondary character which was quite moving. The background established for each character doesn't play much of a role in personality, and there's not much more depth to them than that.<br /><br />2) The humour. There were afew laughs, but it just didn't work for me. The best way I can think of to describe it is an exaggerated sarcasm, unbelievable situations, and obviously set-up feeder lines. I think I do Scalzi a disservice, but it's hard to put my finger on what precise thing about it irritated me.<br /><br />* * *<br /><br />Another thing I've seen reviewers complain about is that there are three codas. They are, but what I think some people have missed is that they're also short stories, told in the first, second, and third person respectively. They don't tie into the main plot of the book, and are essentially sidenotes and a few loose ends; you can easily skip them and not miss out on anything related to the \\"Redshirts\\" plot.<br /><br />However, I liked them. They're written in a way that is more character-focused, and I think I would have liked the rest of \\"Redshirts\\" more if the whole thing was written more like them.<br /><br />The first story I enjoyed the least. It's kind of protracted and stretched a bit too far, and the format isn't that great.<br />The second story ranked in the middle for me, and I liked it alot. The only problem I have with it is that it's written in the second person, and given how the story is written it's a bit confusing and doesn't work too well. Despite that, it's still an enjoyable story.<br />The third and last story I loved. It touches on a multitude of really raw human emotions, but without being heavy handed or melodramatic. Both layers of the plot work very well, both alone and playing off each other. The ending, while cliched, also worked very well for me, and I thought it was a really beautiful counterpoint to the rest of the story.<br /><br />I'm sure I'll pick up some more Scalzi, particularly based on the codas, but doubt it'll be anytime soon.<br /><br />2/5
B004SBS8LA|5.0|super duper cool assome best game ever you can't imagine this mach fun in a game ever in your life
B006LSZECO|3.0|It took me about half of the book before I really found it to be interesting.  I almost did not finish it because it was dragging on and sometimes had a problem with the writing style-not being clear enough.  I actually rated the first half 2 stars and the last half 4 stars.  Our book club suggested the book and then decided not to read it because it was hard to get into, but I read it anyway.  I did like the last half.  In the end, I am glad I read it.  Amy sure was &#34;amazing&#34; - don't think I would want to know her!!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Best book I have read so far this year. It's hilarious in some parts, yet so real and understanding about life in other parts.
1878424114|5.0|i TRY TO READ THIS EVERY DAY AND IS EXTREMLEY iNSPIRATIONAL!! tHANKYOU rIVER CITY bOOKS FOR SENDING ME THIS bOOK
B007HGPBRC|5.0|Hitchens was my favorite writer and I am touched that I was able thread were among his finale thoughts. A must read for any fan of the great Christopher Hitchens.
B008NEVPCC|5.0|I came upon this artist on accident, but ever since then, I've been an avid fan! Her music is amazing and so is her voice. I preordered this CD because I knew I wouldn't regret having it. I listen to it all the time!
B00B23O97Y|5.0|Awesome new album from slowhand! Light, but great music...Clapton does it again!<br />I highly recommend if you are a Clapton fan!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Not a collectors stash, but merely the 8 films thrown together. It was exactly what I wanted and didn't cost me a fortune (I was going to buy the Wizards Collection). I watch these movies all the time now!
B009XTF8KQ|5.0|This was a interesting to say the least hahah it was a really good movie. I wish it went more into detail about the box but all in all a good movie
0545265355|4.0|I was unsure about this series, having only seen snippets of the movie, but I read the first book in  about two days...I LOVED it. It reminded me of reading the first Harry Potter all over again, but a different story line.
B007JMW46U|5.0|One of the most incredible stories in literary history. Any fan of mystery will love this classic series of short stories and novels.
0062215507|5.0|This book was amazing. It is a great compliment to the Complete Filmmaking Journey; it is shorter, but with cool handouts, like the Marauders Map. It went into some detail, not a lot, but had very interesting facts in it (I didn't know Hogsmeade was below the snow line!).
B001N1WSE6|5.0|This gift set of Casablanca was a Christmas gift for my die-hard fan of Casablanca husband.  He is loving it, and has watched it three times!<br /><br />He tells me that it is a beautiful set, and he will watch it periodically until the end of his life!
0062101897|5.0|I expected to get a nice little book, but I was completely shocked at the volume of this book! It will take me forever to read the entire thing, but it will be worth it and it will look great with the rest of my Harry Potter stuff!
B009KHCT94|5.0|Wonderful - All the sci-fi and NAZI cliches and then some.<br /><br />Zeppelin spaceships.<br /><br />A black man turned white.<br /><br />A Fuhrer wannabe.<br /><br />A Sara Palin type US President.<br /><br />A kick-ass blonde NAZI who's heart isn't in it.<br /><br />Best 99 cents I ever spent.
B00457WZEI|4.0|Good book I enjoyed it a lot. The best part was well the book. That was a good book I liked it.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is a great book and my son and I loved reading it together. I loved it because it has so much emotion.
B004TI5N38|4.0|I would have given it 5 stars but save that for the books that I cannot put down, like the Forgotten.  This is a book I would recommend and am glad I read it .  I enjoy most of Baldacci novels, especially ones that have the old Camel club feel.
B003ZJ0ZX0|4.0|AS SOON AS GOT THIS CD I HAD TO HEAR IT---JUST ANOTHER GREAT ARRANGEMENT OF SONGS FROM THE YOUNG TALENT OF BRUNO MARS.....CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR MORE!!!! GREAT JOB!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I'm not in the habit of writing reviews but with this book yes! This book sucks you into Pat Pebbles life and keeps you hanging on for more!  Definitely pick this book up for a good, no great read!
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|Harry Hole novels are on my list of &#34;must reads&#34; and this one doesn't disappoint. Anyone liking quality mysteries owes it to themselves to try one and see where it leads. I'd highly recommend reading them in order as Harry's personal life is an evolving adventure in itself. Between Jo Nesbo and Henning Mankell there's a great deal happening in Scandanavia these days.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This book will take you behind the enemy lines and detail the courage of four American Heroes. Since Marcus is very detailed in the events it may not be for those with weak stomachs. It will leave you asking...\\"What would I have done?\\"
B000FC11A6|5.0|I hate math, and I still liked this book. Even the parts that seemingly have no plot relevence are still entertaining to read.
1451695195|5.0|This story is well worth reading, if like me you are interested in the Age old questions of life beyond the physical one we are living.,  So many report these experience or ones like this , the very convincing part comes this time by someone who is a very science minded dotor, it took a very severe experience to show him the that there could indeed be more to our Spiritual existance than many believe.
B005IQZB14|5.0|A great story that keeps moving. i am 3/4 the way through and haven't lost interest yet. Although I haven't went through some of the things Cheryl Strayed has she has written her story in such a way that all can relate in one way or another.<br /><br />Highly recommend.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I really love this show and can't get enough! I missed the deadline to watch Season 3 on the PBS website, so I'm really glad this was available. I love instant streaming -- so convenient! I wish Amazon had more instant videos.
1601251831|5.0|It was a gift, and  the happy giftee rated it very high and used it for gaming with good results
B005UD1D62|5.0|Can't wait for the next installment, a great girlie read! Love the characters and the drama, very well written. Lauren Conrad has succeeded again!
B005LLSZNM|5.0|The cast of characters are great.  This season left me with wanting more of the show.  I can't wait to watch Season 5
B00377E5SG|5.0|For a remake this one isn't bad.  Almost as good as the original. But you can never totally beat Audrey and Bogey
B0085YNML2|5.0|My 4 year old has this game's controls down but it provides just enough of a challenge that she does not quit when she cant get past a level the first time.
B008AT71WI|5.0|Great movie! The music is wonderful and it continues to be one of our favorites and we recommend it highly.
0525953728|5.0|I enjoy the subject matter of the book.  the book itself was an easy read and kept me engaged until the end.
B007A2O3FO|4.0|Enjoyed this story and film.  Well written and outstanding cast...of course!!! It's one of the films I'll take on my 'Sister Weekend&#34;...
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I loved the series up till the end of the last episode......won't spoil it but I am very disappointed. As usual service from amazon was great.
B008200LHW|5.0|I ordered this to use with my netbook. It works great, is very fast and really accurate. A great alternative for me than a window mount gps. I have a laptop mounted in my truck and it is much easier to search and navigate to an address by typing it on the computer. Thumbs up!
B00992CF6W|5.0|You get to build whatever you want on this game. You can play by yourself or you can play with friends. You can also play on survival mode or creative mode.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|Great movie, suspenseful.  Kept you guessing and on the edge of your seat.  Good special effects.  Didn't get bored with this one.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Loved every bit of the book cant wait to read the next one.<br />Might even go see the movie. Maybe
B0047WJ12K|5.0|Leonardo Dicaprio in great in this movie.  Special effects are awesome.  Suspenseful movie that does't disappoint.  Would recommend to a friend.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|This movie is super legit and super awesome! God help me awaiting the sequel this summer! God it is going to be fantastic and mystifying to watch! Sent this movie to my Uncle Jay whom when he was a kid watched Star Trek the original series on TV. Figured he'd enjoy this revamping of the Star Trek Phenomena!
0765325950|5.0|I purchased this for my son who has read the entire &#34;Wheel of Time&#34; series. He states that it was well written, but that he didn't enjoy it quite as much as the books written entirely by Robert Jordan.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Kept me engaged from the very beginning and surprised my socks off at the end! Rare to find a book that does that! Loved it!
B0055PGUYU|4.0|A must read for my workplace. It is very handy to be able to download this to my phone so that I have it available for comment and review. Discussing it in a book club at work.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is one of Stephen King's best.  It's historical narrative with a Stephen King twist.  Use of events and potential events masterful.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I think this one of best apps that I have loaded on my kindle fire  It goes into a great deal of informative information with little effort
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|She is so real.  So funny.  It's like flipping pages through your wordy girlfriends diary and seeing yourself on every page.  So funny!!!! Made me smile and laugh most of the pages and then there are a few that are just really touching.  Recommended it to everybody and everybody loved it.  Great beach read.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I saw this book had such high ratings and I heard the movie was very good, so I decided to read. Overall, I think it was just okay. I personally didn't care for Tiffany and her rough talk. I also did not like Pat 's father. I felt annoyed when parts came with him in it. I found the book to be very slow moving and there was no real satisfaction in the ending, for me. I want to see the movie in hopes I enjoy it better than the book.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Read book on recommendation and it did not disappoint.  Couldn't put it down.  Good twist.  Characters and story are well developed.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|fantastically funny movie. a little predictable,but what kids movie isn't. can't wait until my child is old enough to watch it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I enjoyed this book and the relationship between the two main characters.  I did not see the ending coming!  I'm glad this is a single book, rather than it being dragged into a series, the ending was great.
B00881VLCE|3.0|The pictures are great but the problem is the distortion of the pieces makes it hard to view where they go.  I like a challenge of eyeing the pieces not just trying to see where it fits and this it did not do well.  The music was on a loop and drove me crazy after a bit (I like the large puzzles so they take time)  it was great at the beginning but after 2 times through it was more than enough.  Also the adds were a bit disturbing I would not like a child to come across some of them do to thier nature.  Invest and get a good puzzle app without the adds.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|So sad, so beautiful. all I can say is.. Just take the time to read this book. You won't regret it.
B007L5GDGW|5.0|I am old school and still not use to useing the tablet to make things do what I want but once you get the hang of it this game is quite fun.  I did get frustrated at first because its very touchy but you learn why the farther you go.  You will be quite suppried for simple graphics and such it will burn the hours very quickly and you will be having fun the whole time.  Give it a whirl
0385536828|3.0|I've read a number of McEwan's works. He's a beautiful writer. But this one, for some reason, left me wanting something more. It's not that I disliked the surprise ending -- I did like it. But somehow it wasn't enough. It didn't satisfy my appetite.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is addicting.  I watched because I like history and wanted to check it out and now I am waiting for the next season.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|this movie was so much better than we expected it to be. We're giving a copy to our grandchildren for Easter.
B0087ZG7HK|5.0|Got this for my kids and we watched it immediately .....they loved the movie and I loved watching it with them
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I usually wait for things to come out on Netflix but after watching the first two seasons, I started purchasing episodes from the third season.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|Tom Cruise is great again in this one also, good movie I would watch it again and again you should to
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Wonderfully entertaining. You get hooked and can't stop watching! The casting and acting is superb. I also love the historical fiction aspect.
