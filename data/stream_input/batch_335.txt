B000060MMI|5.0|Yes, they sound like the Pogues - and yes, &quot;Another Bag of Bricks,&quot; reminiscent of the Pogues' &quot;Turkish Song of the Damned&quot; but the Pogues are no more (at least at the moment) and Flogging Molly add a slightly heavier touch to their Irish music, and the result is amazing ! This album has no weak track and the guys play with so much 'power' that you just can't stop repeating the CD over and over again. The production is tight and if you are looking for the missing link between the Pogues and Dropkick Murphys, look no further !
B00005QZWJ|5.0|It is an awesome CD with lots a songs from the first lord of the rings movie. I would definitly reccomend it to anybody. Makes a great gift to.
0394716787|3.0|Poe is a master.  Reading them again after years of not brought me a lot of pleasure.  This version has small type that makes reading in low light (for mood) very difficult.  Anyone who has a hard time with a newspaper will not enjoy this release.
B00005JMCR|3.0|This series of three films has one thing going for it that none of the other so-called teen comedies has...a Heart: particularly in the relationship between Jim (Jason Biggs) and his father (Eugene Levy).<br />\\"American Wedding\\" finds Jim about to be married to Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) and even though the actual wedding preparations are kind of a bore, Stickler manages to save the day especially in the scene, set in a gay bar, in which he duel dances with a big hearty fellow known as Bear.<br />\\"American Wedding\\" is fun but it's time to say goodbye to Jim and Stickler and all the characters: good luck to all of you!
0062502182|2.0|I was extremely disappointed with this book. Perhaps it was because I'd already heard so many of my friends raving about it, or maybe it's because I read the reviews and many were good.<br />The point is, the first thing I expected from the Alchemist was a good plot. Which, in my opinion, it was painfully lacking. Only two of the characters piqued my interest, and it wasn't even Santiago, the lead character. He came off to me as two-dimensional and, really, quite boring. None of the events made me sit up in my chair and make me want to read faster: it flowed, yes, but, very, very monotonously and on occasion tediously.<br />There were many intelligent metaphors and inspirational messages about life, but I did not hear anything new.<br />The Alchemist is not a bad book. All I'm saying is it's not anywhere near as fantastic as many people are making it out to be.
B00005N5S5|5.0|Dear readers,<BR>    I belive the Terminator is an amazing film. I idolise Arnold Schwarzenegger, he is THE coolest. The film (or should I say the masterpiece) is about a cyborg who travels from the future to kill Sara Connor, who in the future has Jhon Connor(Jhon Connor saves humanity by leading a resistance against the machines). Sgt. Reace also goes back in time but he is sent BY Jhon Connor to save his mom.<br />     This is a sweet movie so check it out!<br />Michael Howell
B000096I9G|5.0|Even I'm not a huge fan of The Cure but I can say that this DVD is awesome !!  The live set of 'Disintegration' is something you must not miss !!  The quality of sound,light,camera is very good.  Do not hesitate to buy it.
B00000JLWW|1.0|Dear readers(if there are any)<BR> I belive this movie S U C K E D!!!
0385509456|3.0|but i liked it...  For me it was a quick read that was 'mildly' interesting and at times equally 'mildly' amusing - but, just left me a little uninterested in the characters.  Concept is good - different.  But I needed more of something or other.  Basically, I put the book down after the last page was turned and was 'mildly' relieved.
0761119752|5.0|I bought this book for my 2 1/2 year old nephew and was surprised to find out it is his seven year old sister's current favorite book! She likes to sing the words--try it--it's fun! Boynton is great for a child as soon as he or she \\"gets\\" the concept of being read to--and I'm still waiting to see when they start getting bored!
B00006RCPM|4.0|A futuristic film taking place around the year 2046[in which no crime has taken place for 6 years] in which a young woman (Agatha)who is a child of heroin addict and her mother Annie Lively are snatched from the living(the child because she saw visions of the future,is drugged,sealed in protective clothing,and is the catalyst to ignite the computers with \\"red balls(crimes of passion),brown balls(premeditated crime),the mother who after getting detoxified wanted her daughter back...Surprisingly the film reflects most of Steven Spielberg's uncommon plots(Philip K Francis's Minority Report\\")in a possibly believability.Due to the experiments many are incarcerated based on pictures which show them committing crimes,(and punished based on whether they were accused as red ball or brown ball)with the computers giving \\"time\\" similar to the TV series \\"1st Edition\\" for the \\"cops on Prevention of a Murder detail\\" to get to where the crime is to take place and to stop it from happening ..often having to kill the accused in the process(no trial needed since the computers showed them doing the crime)..The picture also showed the falacy of identity scanning (if it can be scanned ,it can be replaced) so that opticians can remove the original eyes,replace them with eyes from \\"the eye bank\\" and the \\"patient\\" then has two identities (in actor Tom Cruise(character John Atherton)'s case he and his exwife are able to use his original set of eyes to enter \\"security areas\\" that had been made off limits to him... It also showed an accused(Leo) being killed a minute after the timer had claimed he would be killed in that he really committed suicide..the movie has many scenarios and is best seen as a home video in which it can be viewed in 'shorts'  similar to a tv drama series.It helps it to keep its momentum.
B00004TBUN|4.0|This album is worth owning on sacd just for the bass intro of birdland alone.  Clear, tight and deeeeeeeeep bass like I've never heard on this album.  However, I wish they had done a 5.1 mix.  My previous set-up had two main speaker sets and pre-line out sub, so I really got the bass.  Now that I've set up my speakers for a true 5.1 system, this stereo SACD lacks the bass impact of my previous set-up.  I guess I need front speakers with a lower bottom end.
B00006RIO7|5.0|This soundtrack is just awesome!  It doesn't leave out anything like some soundtracks do, and gives you a wonderful picture of the movie as you're listening to it.  I watched the movie first (It's fantabulous), and after seeing it I knew I HAD to have the soundtrack.  <br />All That Jazz is very catchy, performed by Catherine Zeta-Jones at the beginning of the movie.  This one will stick in your head!  It's very up-beat and definetly helps you know what era the movie is based in (the roarin' 20s).<br />Funny Honey is performed by Renee Zellweger as her husband is covering for her to the police. This one is a soft song and I think it does a great job showcasing Zellwegers sensual voice.  She would make an excellent lounge singer!<br />When You're Good to Mama is performed by Queen Latifa, and it's great!  She has such a strong voice, but I've never heard her sing this style before.  She is stellar as a \\"Mother Hen\\".  The song almost has an egyptian style in some parts.<br />Cell Block Tango is a very unique song in which 6 of the murderesses sing about how they killed there husbands.  \\"He had it coming.  He only had himself to blame.\\"  It's a funny song...and I think everyone will like it.<br />All I Care About is performed by Richard Gere.  I never knew he could sing!  He sure can!  This song introduces his smooth, sexy voice and leaves you wanting \\"B-I-double L- Y\\" too.<br />We Both Reached for the Gun is absolutely hilarious if you've seen the movie.  The song is good, but even better if you know that Billy is manipulating Roxie as a puppet in the song.  Hilarious...<br />Roxie is a song performed by Zellweger, and it reminds me of something I would sing to myself...she's obsessed with being famous.  And she sings passionatly about \\"starting with a BANG\\".<BR>\\"Ummm...I'm a star...and the audience loves me...and I love them...and they love me for loving them...and we love eachother.  And that's because none of us got enough love in our childhood.  And that's showbiz. Kid.\\"<br />I Can't Do it Alone is Velma's plea with Roxie to be her new dance partner and I have to admit it's nice to hear her beg.  She does a good job in her \\"act of desperation\\" and her \\"first I'd, Then she'd\\" is very vivid.<br />Mister Cellophane is performed excellently and I believe it is a very touching song.  It's Amos' Anthem. He feels invisible and I think he got the emotion in his voice just perfect.  It makes you want to cry for him.<br />Razzle Dazzle is Gere's best performance.  Very energetic and fun song.<br />Nowadays performed by Zellweger alone is good, but when you hear her with Zeta-Jones it's even better.  They also shine in the duet \\"I move On\\".<br />The rest of the CD is good, but nothing spectacular...stick to 1-14.<br />Great soundtrack....Great Movie...Get Both!
B00007KMP1|4.0|This is one of my favorite 5.1 sacd albums.  With surround sound, the songs really envelope the listener and keep your attention.  It's really nice how Beck's voice is focused on the center channel while back-up vocals are coming from the surrounds.  The little touches really stand out on 5.1  Otherwise, the songs are a little slow and low, so you might lose interest.  Yeah, its kind of a bummer album, but it's great for rainy days or mellow sundays.
1558216847|1.0|There's no use to discuss the &quot;truth&quot; of this book, as it<BR>has been shown to be complete fiction already over 40 years<BR>ago.

B000006U44|5.0|Kate Bush is one of the most talented humans to grace this mundane mudball and I'd like to encourage more people to actually LISTEN to every aspect of every song she puts out.<br />Comparing her talent to the likes of tori amos is an insult<br />to Kate Bush. Kate Bush stands far above---STILL---in the<br />realm of progressive thinking, creative music, outfits, dance, movements, playing on words without missing a breath...I could go on forever, but I know America has a short attention span.

B000000WA4|5.0|If Billy Corgan can be pretentious, so can I. I will now review this monstrously good album - song by song.<br />\\"dawn to dusk\\"<BR>Mellon Collie: a sparkling piano intro, completely unexpected. you KNOW there's a concept here... A<BR>Tonight Tonight: epic grandeur continues, sweeping orchestra. very beautiful, and holds a lot of memories. A+<BR>Jellybelly: a cauldron blast, the first indication that 30 guitar tracks is still in vogue with Billy. B+<BR>Zero: snaky guitar, bruising. A-<BR>Here is No Why: nobody talks about this song, but I love the melody and lyrics. A<BR>Bullet With Butterfly Wings: Reznor meets Cobain, acidic song; a little overplayed, but still packs a wallop. A-<BR>To Forgive: great lyrics, quiet song; powerful. A-<BR>An Ode to No One: subtitled F... You, it is everything its title promises. B<BR>Love: another lesser known song, great distorsion on guitar and vox, with great lyrics. A<BR>Cupid de Locke: psychedelic freak-out from another century, a jawdropper. A+<BR>Galapogos: amazing lyrics! the music complements it perfectly, very dynamic. A+<BR>Muzzle: another lyrical masterwork over a basic grunge track. A-<BR>Porcelina of the Vast Oceans: the first disc's standout, a nine-minute prog workout with *surprise* great lyrics, aching melody. A+<BR>Take Me Down: the gentle come-down written by James Iha. A-<br />\\"twilight to starlight\\"<BR>Where Boys Fear to Tread: the dark side begins with this furious rock song. complete turn-around from the first disc's beginnings. A<BR>Bodies: another furious guitar workout that drops out from under you as Billy states \\"love is suicide\\". stunning. A<BR>Thirty-Three: sweeping harps, beautiful lyrics. another jawdropper. A+<BR>In the Arms of Sleep: what sounds like a Native flute highlighting desperate love lyrics. A<BR>1979: one of the best Pumpkins songs, an entire nostalgic youth contained in four minutes of musical and lyrical brilliance. A+<BR>Tales of a Scorched Earth: the most unbearable song, the distortionis sometimes too much to take. B-<BR>Thru the Eyes of Ruby: the album standout! my absolute favorite, just on another level in every aspect. A++<BR>Stumbeline: a short acoustic ballad, strange lyrics. A-<BR>X.Y.U.: scalds you for seven minutes, a roller-coaster of a metal song. A-<BR>We Only Come Out at Night: very strange musical accompanying lyrics about vampires maybe? definitely enjoyable. A<BR>Beautiful: exactly as the title suggests. A<BR>Lily (My One and Only): a ballad that seems out of the 30s, not very liked, but still a great song. A-<BR>By Starlight: a slow, morose ballad with great lyrics. a favorite. A<BR>Farewell and Goodnight: the concept is tied together with a beautiful piano outro after a soothing goodnight to the Pumpkins' best era. fantastic end. A+<br />Being in Grade 6 when this album was released, it contains my idealistic youth in its two discs and 28 songs: all the anger, the romantic longing, optimism and pessimism that any young man feels during their youth. My copy is battered and bruised, but I couldn't trade it for anything. Pretentious musical types will argue about the musicality of the album: I talk about the memories contained within. A wonderful achievement and a treasure piece of music in my collection.
B00006RAKP|3.0|This has most of the Billboard hits, to be sure, most notably from his 1970-76 prime. Unfortunately, the album is weighted down with too much of his recent pompous, overblown ballads. Where is &quot;Border Song&quot; and &quot;Don't Go Breaking My Heart&quot;? Or even some of his listenable early 80's hits like &quot;Empty Garden&quot; ,&quot;Nobody Wins&quot; or &quot;Kiss The Bride&quot;? The album would have been better if it was titled &quot;Greatest Songs&quot;, containing less 80's &amp; 90's shlock and more of his masterpieces like &quot;Harmony&quot; or &quot;Danny Bailey&quot; from Yellow Brick Road, or &quot;Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters&quot;, or &quot;Country Comfort&quot;. But then that's my opinion...there are people who like his MOR balladry, and this title is a good mix of both old and new just for them. But for myself and many others, we wish that Elton would sequester himself alone in a room with a piano and guitar. While there, maybe he could drop a tranquilizer or two, pretend he was 25 again, and set out to write great music like he once did, without the pretentions.
0783117523|5.0|Incredible movie.  I cried throughout the whole thing and for hours after.  I can definitly relate to her struggles and how she delt with things.  The way Angelina (who was INCREDIBLE!) portrayed the feelings of Gia was fantastic.  I recomend this to anyone.
B000096IB6|4.0|I thought that Daredevil was a fun movie.  It didn't try to be more than it was, which was pure entertainment.  Not a lot of deep thoughts, just a couple of cool heroes based on a comic book.  The fight scenes and some of the movements were a bit animated looking, but it was based on a comic book, so that should have been expected.  All in all this was a decent film, Jennifer Garner was awesome as Elektra & Michael Clark Duncan made a pretty good King Pin, especially since he can look intimidating, just standing still.  Fans of Daredevil comics & just easy to watch action movies in general, should enjoy this one.
0676973779|5.0|&quot;Life of Pi&quot; is a lovely, intelligent and unique novel - one of the best I've read in a while.<BR>Though I found Pi's views on the lives of zoo animals a bit off (in fact they made me not WANT to like the book!), he is an incredibly endearing, smart character whom I could not help respecting and rooting for. He is a teenage boy - a practicing Christian, Muslim AND Hindu (all at the same time - much to the consternation of his family and various religious mentors)who escapes a sinking ship in a lifeboat shared by an orangutan, a hyena and a tiger.<BR>Pi and the tiger survive for 227 amazing days in the lifeboat (during which they make an amazing 'botanical' discovery worthy of Star-Trek in its Mr. Spock days) before landing on the coast of Mexico. There Pi provides the authorities two different explanations for his amazing survival. <BR>It's up to you to decide which one is true... <BR>Really worth reading, &quot;Life of Pi&quot; stands out brightly amongst the novels I've read in the past few years, and I'll be recommending it for years to come, along with another book that I highly recommend &quot;HE NEVER CALLED AGAIN.&quot;
0440234743|4.0|Troy Phelan is America's tenth wealthiest man - a self-made multi-billionaire and head of a huge corporation. However, his family life has not been half as sucessful as his financial one; he has three three failed marriages behind him, and six children to whom he is apathetic to. They scrounge from him and throw their money down the drain. Many of them are in debt, and one is even being investigated by the IRS. However, Troy Phelan is also reclusive, eccentric, old, infirm and lonely. One morning, after he holds a confereence for his family members to witness the signing of his will, he leaps to his death from the 15th floor of his office building. His family circle vulture-like around the lawyers, having smelled the money. <br />However, when Troy's last will and testament is finally revealed, it brings with it a shocking secret that will ensnare all his family, a missionary who has foresaken earthly possessions to work with Indians inthe Brazillian rainforest, and Nate O'Reilly, a burnt-out lawyer fresh out of his fourth stay in rehab as he treks into the jungle in search of Phelan's lost heir. <br />It's hard to classify this book...it's certainly not a &quot;thriller&quot;, nor is it really a &quot;crime&quot; novel. More, it's just a book concerning certain themes, all cloaked under humanity and a good plot. Those themes involve many things: wealth, faith, material possession, morality, human strength and human weakness and, finally, greed. It's written in Grisham's usual almost ludicrously easy-to-digest prose, which makes it a quick, enjoyable, none-too-taxing read, with some nice surprises and plenty of legal wrangling along the way.<br />The change of scene from Grisham's normal Southern settings to the rainforest of Brazil is admirable and refreshing, and Grisham describes it well. Certainly, I'd now quite like to visist these out-of-the-way places he describes, maybe even live a similar lifestyle, for a little while, to some of the people in the book... He makes it all sound very satisfying. He also fascinatingly depicts aspects of the lives of native Brazillian Indians who live off the land and the forest, and any ready is bound to enjoy this [probably] new experience. <br />The Testament is nothing out of this world as far as great books go. I'd not leap to reccomend it, but it's satisfying and enjoyable and endearingly different.
1576751988|5.0|Fast read and excellent information.   From the very beginning the book gives information that is meant to be used right away.  When Mr. Tracy says put down the book and do something.  Put down the book and do it.  Mr. Tracy you have a new fan.  Thank you.

B0000A1RJI|5.0|A great composition to match an exciting movie! You relive each part of the movie as you listen. The excitement, humor, and romance are all part of the music. The music alone makes you want to be a pirate and go sailing along the high sees! Drink up me hearties YO HO!
B000091KVL|5.0|The Mars Volta, made up of Cedric Bixler, Omar Rodriguez, the late Jeremy Ward, Flea, and guest John Frusciante (3/5 of At the Drive in, and 2/5 of the Red Hot Chili Peppers) seem set to change rock music as we know it.  They will never be accepted on mainstream radio, so if that's what you listen to, skip this review.<br />The album, while being mainly psychedelic seamlessly blends just about every form of music you can think of into a truly sublime hodge-podge of sound.  Loud?  Yes.  Bombastic?  At times, yet the guitar work is simply genius, and Mr. Bixler exhibits shades of Geddy Lee from Rush, but in a good way.<br />The album may be chaotic, hectic, and fevered, but they know how to make it all work together to create something absolutely unique.  If they can keep this up, 10 years from now, they may be truly appreciated as the ingenious innovators they are.
B00005N5S5|3.0|...<br />While you normally watch a sequel with an appreciation of where it came from, in this case, you watch the original with an appreciation of what it led to: the film that many praise as one of the greatest sequels in cinematic history. What these people overlook, though, is the fact that the original wasn't that tough an act to follow in the first place.<br />Make no mistake about it, Terminator is not a bad movie at all. In fact, it's a lot of fun. A cold, efficient cyborg, played by a young Ah-nuld, is sent back in time to destroy the mother-to-be of the savior of the humans of the future. Said mother-to-be, Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) doesn't know what the heck she did to deserve being targeted for termination. And Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) is the soldier also sent back in time, to protect Sarah and explain everything to her. (Sarah: \\"There must be some mistake, I didn't do anything!\\"  Reese: \\"No, but you will.\\") Good concept, well-structured script, over-all adequate performances, and most of all, terrific action sequences.<br />But when you really come down to it, Terminator, hampered as it was by its modest budget (the reason behind its mono soundtrack), a so-so performance from Ms Hamilton (she was still then learning to act), and the limits of the technology of the time (it uses stop-motion animation, a technique that had by this time lost its appeal), is not a great movie, just a pretty good one. More than anything else, it is a mere curiosity, an answer to several trivia questions. Such as: <br />What film launched Arnold Scharzenegger to superstardom?<br />What was James Cameron's first major effort after his less-than-auspicious start with Piranha II? <br />And of course, what was the movie that spawned one of the highest-grossing sequels of all time?
B0000AI44Q|3.0|I saw Neil perform this entire album this past summer.  At the time, I thought it was some of his strongest material in years.  My one hope was that, when put on CD, that the songs would be made more concise.  While fifteen minute songs, with long solos, play well in a concert environment (and are expected at a Neil Young show), they don't play as well in studio.  An album in the 45 - 50 minute range would have been much better.  I find it hard to devote 78 minutes, in one sitting, to listening to a CD.<BR>As for the material, 'Bandit' is a wonderful, contemplative ballad.  'Be The Rain' and 'Falling From Above' should become concert staples.  The playing by Crazy Horse is wonderful, actually restrained for them.<BR>Overall, a fine album, but makes me long for what might have been.
0972169504|5.0|i have been following Jorge Cham's work for a while now and i must admit that i find almost every one of his cartoons painfully truthful and funny.<br />This is a good compilation of some of his best works.
B000008JGJ|5.0|There's not much to say if you're a Pink Floyd fan.  A masterpiece nicely packaged in a fancy black box with really nice insert cards and booklet.  Opinions will differ on the sound quality, but I listed through high quality headphones and quickly get lost in this classic work.  You can't go wrong with this disc.
B0000027I6|5.0|Last fall, Roger Waters' song \\"What God Wants\\" was rising up the charts, and it caught my attention.  I've always liked Pink Floyd, but not enough to go out of my way to get their solo projects, and I'd not heard any of Waters' work since he left the band.  But \\"What God Wants\\" was a great song, sounding as Floydian as anything off of \\"The Wall,\\" and on the strength of that song I bought Waters' \\"Amused To Death.\\"<br />I've been listening to that album almost every day since then. I've been won over completely: the album is a masterwork, definitely one of Waters' best works.  It's better than \\"The Final Cut\\" and perhaps better than \\"The Wall,\\" too.  The theme Waters works with is shocking and relevant.  \\"Amused To Death\\" is a biting, angry statement on the decrepit state of our society.  It may be a little hard to get through the first couple of listenings, simply because this is one of the most depressing albums you're likely to hear in a long time.<br />Waters' tenure in Pink Floyd helped cement the band's reputation for doom-and-gloom, as they cast the spotlight on the way our society is doing its best to erase any spark of Humanity from the common man. \\"Wish You Were Here\\", their tribute to ex-lead singer Syd Barrett, gives one version (not necessarily the only one) of how life in the fast lane can murder an up-and-coming artist; \\"The Wall\\" was the story of a young man who, through the pressures of an uncaring school, an uncaring Mother, and and uncaring society, grows up to become a hate-fostering Hitler wannabe (and when he actually shows some feelings, Society roars up to crush them); while \\"Animals\\" uses dogs and sheep to paint a dark picture of the way we have to kill to survive (Dogs), or else be led to the slaughter (Sheep).<br />But now, with \\"Amused To Death,\\" Waters does his best to open our eyes and warn us that if we sit back and let the people on high tell us what to think, we'll lose our right to survive as a species.  We're being carefully manipulated by governments, who use religion and television to make us think what THEY want us to think.<br />\\"What God Wants,\\" in addition to being a damnation of the way money and religion are inextricably linked today (churches have to make money to survive;  televangelists weep and moan and, through the power of television, persuade innocent viewers to open their wallets and shower them with cash), gives us the idea of God being used as an excuse to go war: \\"God wants freedom,\\" \\"God wants war,\\" \\"God wants famine.\\"<br />Religion has always been one of the strongest weapons used by dictators (elected or otherwise) to persuade the masses; and since the coming of that black box known as television, people have been more and more willing to sit back and let others do their thinking for them.  This is made especially clear in \\"Perfect Sense\\" and \\"The Bravery Of Being Out Of Range,\\" which focus on that sham called the Gulf War (it's never mentioned by name) and the way it was presented to the public as a flashy video game: we sat back, watched things blowing up on TV, and cheered the pilots who delivered the bombs. (Even the pilots were carefully conditioned: \\"There is no right, no wrong/Only tin cans and Cordite and white cliffs and blue skies and Flight/The beauty of military life...\\")<br />If we reduce war - the slaughter of thousands who always die needlessly when we set out to \\"punish\\" someone like Saddam Hussein - to merely the latest in prime-time entertainment, then what have we become as a race?  Have we indeed been given \\"Too Much Rope\\" to hang ourselves?<br />(By the way, Ted Turner's CNN has a standing order: in the event of a national crisis such as a war or an earthquake, its advertising rates immediately shift to a higher level so that it can make more money on its commercials.  After all, more people seemed to pay attention to CNN than the major news networks during the Gulf War - so what better place for the advertisers to run their commercials?

B00009P1O0|5.0|This album has been talked about so much amongst my friends that it has almost reached mythic proportions. Upon my first listen I understood why.<br />Walk on By - Featured on Decade, and the album's opener. What an opener it is. If this one doesn't have you tapping  your foot I don't know what will. <BR>See The Sky About To Rain- A solid track. Not my favorite song, but good enough to be on this album.<BR>Revolution Blues- An answer to Lynrd Skynrd's 'Sweet Home Alabama' which called out Neil Young's 'Southern Man'. <BR>For The Turnstiles- Also featured on decade. A  classic folksy tune, with a banjo accentuating the vocals. <BR>Vampire Blues- It's apparent that a lot must have been on Neil's mind around this time and it shows on this song. With so much going on around him it's released here.<BR>On The Beach- The title track is probably my sleeper favorite on this album. <BR>Motion Pictures- A great folky tune<BR>Ambulance Blues- Wow! Who  knew that this album would finish  up with Neil unleashing this atom bomb of a song? This song is just too beautiful to describe.<br />That's it in a nutshell. Also, don't be turned off by the fact that this album has been out of print for so long. This album is very accesible by all, and ranks right up there with Harvest and Everybody Knows this is No Where in terms of great albums.
B00006RU5B|5.0|To tell the truth I wanted to hate this record and I would, too, if it wasn't so F'IN A GOOD. I was never a big rage fan but I always respected Chris Cornell and his fantastic vocals, I was something of a soundgarden fan. I was SHOCKED. DAZED. This Audioslave was real good, real, real good, WHO good, Rolling Stones good, (I don't want to, but have to say, &quot;Cream good).This record makes you feel uneasy and happy all at the same time. Morello shines as his rhythm section churns beneath him, a glorious train wreck made even grander by Chris Cornells best, (if I'm not mistaken, since badmotorfinger)almost superfluous vocals. Deep, meaningless songs unravel and sometimes pummel with raw punk energy. This LP is a real gasser, and fans of rage, and fans of soundgarden will be more dissapppointed than fans of rock. HARD ROCK. think DIO on steroids or Ozzy on saturday night. Rock at its hardest. Truly an artistic triumph.Beautiful in the most unimaginable ways. Hard and Soulful seemingly at odds with itself, but strangely unified in its vision that Rock'n'roll can, indeed, change the world.<BR>(for the better)

0553213105|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is one of the first Regency romances ever written and still perhaps the best. This witty and complex novel features delightful characters, nonstop comic observations, clever dialogue and fast paced development of an excellent plot. Besides being a thoroughly entertaining read, Pride and Prejudice raises questions about appearance versus reality, society versus the individual and the nature of true love that still resonate deeply with us today. Elizabeth Bennet is one of the most complex, lively and fascinating heroines ever created, and her growing romance with the highly intelligent, proud and magnetic Fitzwilliam Darcy is one of the most compelling ever written. This is a seminal novel that no lover of romance-or student of human nature-should ever miss.

0425166805|3.0|The heart of von Daniken's claim - and, incidentally the source of most of his income - is the fact that Genesis 6 refers to the arrival of the `sons of God': whom he then assumes must be aliens from another planet. As a result, he thinks, we are descended from them. Many of his claims have been found to be spurious over the years, but it has been more difficult to refute this particular one because, it would appear, there is no evidence `in stone' to be offered up against it. Well now there is some evidence on paper! In his recent book `God, Science and the Cosmic Jigsaw', Jonathan Kingsley provides us with an entirely different answer to this particular enigma. In this work, where he strives to bridge the gaps between science and religion, he argues the case for a two-phase creation where the first was natural evolution and the second was divine intercession: with the creation of Adam using the genetic blueprint of the evolutionary race. Hence, this designer race, `sons of God', who then went on to displease God by interbreeding with evolutionary man, leading to the `Fall of Man'. If you want to know where we came from, you will do well to consider what Kingsley has to say and not delude yourself about aliens. For while aliens might well exist somewhere in the universe, their intervention was certainly not required on our little planet! Avail yourself of this entertaining and very logical alternative to the misplaced theories of von Daniken.
0440237688|5.0|A world that on the surface is a perfect utopia, but once Jonas got to the depths of this world in which he lived he saw the truth. Throughout his life, he learned that to be different was bad, but when chosen to be the reciever and hold all the memories he learns the truth of his world and that it was as far from perfect as you can get.  In the search for a perfect world they truly found an imperfect world. Jonas soon runs from this world to find the real world. The book ended with an uncertain fate. A sequel must be written to show his fate and the fate of his world.
0553277472|3.0|Firstly, although this book has a cult following, it is as well to remember firstly that it is fiction, and secondly that it is intended to be the ravings of a man recently released from a loony-bin after electroshock therapy. Before he was this hippy motorcyclist he was `Phaedrus', Professor of Rhetoric. This mechanism allows the author to philosophise behind a mask that can never be criticised. (It also allows him to come to a not particularly satisfying culmination to his rider's journey.) Having set this up, his addled-brain hero rants about the need to define perfection. This is not to say that this is not a well-written book, or than the overlying story about our hero and his son is not of interest - but the underlying stuff does get exceedingly deep in a philosophical sense, where the subject matter is hardly something of life-changing importance and one wonders if the effort to understand it all is really worth the effort. In fact, the philosophical bits can, in truth, get to be rather boring, and one feels racked by guilt if any attempt is made to skip them, lest some important clue about the true nature of the narrator comes through. It proves to be a very long journey! I would refer the reader to a much more rewarding philosophical journey, equally as good in exercising the mind, and one in which there is actually a significant philosophical outcome. Try `God, Science and the Cosmic Jigsaw' by Jonathan Kingsley. This provides a very thought-provoking bridge between science and religion. There is not a word of fiction in it, but you will get far more out of it - without even getting your fingers oily with motor cycle maintenance!
B00004Y6OA|5.0|Women And Children First is one of Van Halen's best albums, even if it isn't among their biggest sellers. This is clearly David Lee Roth's album with his charisma dominating every track. They certainly could not make an album this fun with Sammy Hagar or Gary Cherone. This is Van Halen at their most laid back.<br />Although the tracks here are longer than on their first two albums, the album never ceases to sound like a party. The most straight-forward track is the opener \\"And The Cradle Will Rock...\\" which still sounds pretty loose when compared to later albums with Roth like Fair Warning and 1984. Tracks such as \\"Everybody Wants Some\\", \\"Fools\\", and \\"Romeo Delight\\" are all very strong riff-rockers which sound like they were made for the concert stage. The hyperactive \\"Loss Of Control\\" leads to the more laid back classic rocker \\"Take Your Whiskey Home\\", the strongest track here. The acoustic \\"Could This Be Magic?\\" is very catchy with the band sounding a little tipsy during the chorus. \\"In A Simple Rhyme\\" closes the album with a bang, another underrated classic. This album is best enjoyed in its entirety as each track blends into the next flawlessly. After this album, Eddie Van Halen exerted more control over the band's direction. This lead the band to its greatest success but losing the looseness and innocence that made them special. Fans who only have the albums with Hagar or those having just the most popular albums like Van Halen or 1984 should definitely check this out.
B00005JLPK|5.0|I was stunned when I watched this movie. <br />The colours. The divine accents. The music. And Salma Hayek.<br />I can't say I liked this actress before - I had no idea she would be able to portay Frida so deeply and passionately. No doubt, she must pale in comparison with the great artist herself, but she was still strong, vibrant and expressive.<br />I was very surprised to hear that people think this movie is sexually explicit or anything of the kind. Actually, it puts no stress at all on sex. It is for sure much less indecent than any Hollywood movie made in the last few decades, perhaps save those made especially for children. The movie is erotic, though - indeed, Frida's dance with another woman is just beautiful to watch - it's fascinating and exquisite.<br />And I must once again stress how much I loved the Spanish accent that rang throughout the movie, as well as the intense music. The music... it was just irresistible.<br />Frida was a woman who I doubt can be understood by simply watching a movie. Even if it's a great movie.<br />And this movie IS great, which is a reason to watch it and quit looking for historical imprecisions.
B00005JLSE|3.0|I'm no fan of musicals in general, especially on film; they work much better on a live stage.  Nonetheless, I thought this was a clever concept in that the musical numbers are done in a nightclub setting and as fantasies in Roxie's mind, rather than within the context of the &quot;real&quot; story that is going on (women in prison/on trial for murder).  The film is seriously marred by the casting of Renee Zellweger, who is clearly not a polished musical performer and (to me anyway) is really annoying just to look at.  However, Zeta-Jones is just as clearly a polished musical pro who takes command of every scene she's in and is as much fun to watch in her dance numbers as the best of Hollywood's hoofers.  Gere was the real surprise to me and I thought he was fantastic.  It's a shame he was completely snubbed at the Oscars when he deserved recognition for the job he did in this role, but Hollywood (and especially the Oscars) has never distinguished itself for fairness or recognizing talent above cronyism (no Oscars for Kirk Douglas or the Marx Brothers, but several for Shelly Winters?  And the equivalent of late-career booby prizes for John Wayne and Paul Newman after overlooking their best work for years? It would take a book to catalog all of the goofy Oscar choices and outrageous injustices over the years.)  <br />Finally, I agree completely with the folks who recognize that &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; was a vastly better movie in every way and I share their outrage at the film's total rejection by Mr. Oscar, while &quot;Chicago&quot; received far more awards than it deserves.
B000001FCB|5.0|As stated in my 'profile', this is one of my top 5 'stranded on a desert isle' recordings. In fact, though I wasn't stranded, this recording has made the island routes and made some friends for me who spoke different languages. The music on this recording has a universal language, though all the lyrics are in Portugese. The language is Love. The previous reviews say most of what I would have - but anyone who loves Elis and Tom must find (or buy) the Jobim compilation put together by Oscar Castro-Neves entitled &quot;Antonio Carlos Jobim - The Man From Ipanema&quot;. On it you will find a rare treat or two. For instance, after the last track on the last CD (which is the Astrud Gilberto version of &quot;Vivo Sohando&quot;), unannounced in the notes or the discography, come 6 or 7 out-takes of Elis and Tom working on Aguas de Marco. It is at the same time revealing and hilarious. It is a glimpse into the fun and the personalities of both Regina and Jobim. Also included is the track &quot;Bonita&quot; which does not appear on this recording. Somewhat wickedly, Astrud is placed between Elis Regina or followed by her a few times just in case anyone really thinks she is a singer... I have heard this described as a musicians' recording, but judging by the number of reviews here and the comments, it appears that it is also a damn good listeners' recording as well. One last thing - if one were to be stranded on a desert island with this recording, if you played it loud enough you would not be stranded for long, trust me on this one.
B00009RDG9|2.0|Read this plot synopsis quickly.  The film picks up in a battle in Kosovo in 1999.  Del Toro is introduced as a soldier in a special opps group as he witnesses the horrors of war.  Fast forward four years and Jones is introduced as the world's greatest tracker.  Then Del Toro kills some  would be hunters and Jones is called in to find him.  There are other things going on here, but this is what the film is about.  The hunt, the father versus the son.  It's fun as it plays out.<br />The Hunted opens with a quote, or interpretation (I'm not sure which) from the bible and the story of Abraham via Johnny Cash.  Now Jones is not Del Toro's real father in the film.  He trained him though, and Del Toro saw him as a father figure.  For those not familiar, Abraham was asked by God to kill his son.  Now this is suppose to work as an allegory for the film, but I'm not really sure it does.  Almost nothing is explained in The Hunted.  It made me think of the film Basic, a film which told the audience everything, but showed nothing.  The Hunted is the opposite, it showed everything, but told us nothing.  It lends the key elements to the audience, just enough to keep us in the film, but it never elaborates.  I wanted more.  I wanted to know why things were happening.  Instead the plot is second to the action, nothing new in this genre, but the plot works like my description of it, which, if you go reread, is not enough.<br />In theory, more movies like The Hunted should get made.  The plot is simple, yet engaging, the acting is good, but not over the top, the action is intense, but not unrealistic, and the running time short.  Of course, William Friedkin has been around a while and knows what he is doing, but I think this film would have benefited from another thirty minutes of character development.  Friedkin says on one of the DVD extras that he wanted the film to be short.  Okay, I'm the last one to argue movies are too short these days, but this one should have been longer.  Asort of poor man's First Blood I'd say.  Nice effort, could have been more.

0780622553|5.0|What an audacious movie. I can't think of another one that is so referential to its predecessors, and still so original. This is the central idea that \\"The Matrix\\" flirts with within the form of an action movie. \\"Dark City\\" opts for film noir, which is what this type of story is really best suited for. The main difference between the two movies is that \\"The Matrix\\" seems to have been created as a showcase for outstanding new special effects, while \\"Dark City\\" creates its special effects to accomodate the story. And because the story is more involved and more philosophical, Proyas' film has the edge on the Matrix movies in virtually every department except guns & ammo.       Some reviews argue that the characters are flat. It seems to me they're supposed to be this way, since they aren't really whole people, but amalgams of different memories and personalities. Much like the visitors in \\"Solaris\\", they're starting over with someone else's memories. Rufus Sewell's performance in particular is outstanding, as he slowly moves towards self-awareness.       Other reviews argue that the movie is style over substance, and to that I can only say that the critics are not watching hard enough. Perhaps they are so used to style-over-substance and substance-over-style that they can't imagine both co-existing in a modern thriller. This movie does have a lot of style, yes, most notably the influence of Fritz Lang (Sewell's face, in fact, vaguely calls to mind Peter Lorre's child murderer in \\"M\\"). But the movie is very substantial, too, and Murdoch's quiet final encounter with one of the Strangers, in a dark corridor following the climactic battle, is handled with perfect delicacy. A lot of times, movies will be ignored at first and then rediscovered and re-evaluated years down the road as classics. I have a feeling \\"Dark City\\" will have a second wind.
B00005J79J|5.0|This is the perfect album for the new fan of Sarah Brightman. It is compiled of some of her best songs including Time to Say Goodbye with Andrea Bocelli, Eden, the haunting A Question of Honour, and live versions of Captian Nemo and La Mer. This album also includes beautifully recorded covers of Scarborough Fair and Whiter Shade of Pale. It is the essential &quot;pop&quot; recordings of Ms. Brightman.

B00000DG1R|4.0|Duran Duran's &quot;Greatest&quot; is a wonderful compilation of catchy tunes by a band that was highly-successful in the 1980's. All of the band's greatest are featured here, such as &quot;New Moon On Monday&quot; and &quot;Save A Prayer&quot;.<br />Unfortunately, as is the case with many greatest hits albums released (such as Madonna's &quot;Immaculate Collection&quot;), most songs featured here are edited versions that are played over the airways. It appears necessary to assign these versions to this collection in order to fit all the tracks to one CD.<br />As a result, songs such as &quot;Save A Prayer&quot;, &quot;Rio&quot;, &quot;Come Undone&quot; and &quot;Ordinary World&quot; lose a little of their effectiveness as they are condensed to 3 to 3 1/2 minute versions.<br />Still, the CD is a great addition to any music collection and worth the money that is spent for it.<br />For those of us interested in the full, unadulterated versions of the edited tracks, we might be interested in picking up the originating albums or try to find the very-difficult-to-find CD singles.

Till, I wanted to read it and I am so glad I finally found the need to!<br />The Giver is set in an era of Sameness - in short a world that has no colour, no memories of the past, all that it has is sameness and a sense of serenity till a boy of the community named Jonas turns twelve. <br />The community has a rule that anyone who turns twelve is asigned his/her profession - and Jonas is the chosen one to \\"Receive Dreams and Memories of the past\\" by the \\"Giver\\". The Giver is an old man who has all memories of the world. <br />The crux lies in what Jonas learns and what he must do to gain or rather attain his individualism. <br />An Excellent Read!!
B000099T2L|2.0|I'm a reasonbly big Destiny's Child fan, though not a really huge fan, and I thought I'd pick this up. How awful! None of the playfulness that characterized her work with Destiny Child is present in this album.<br />Basically, you can sum this album up in three categories:<BR>1) &quot;Crazy in Love&quot;, which is a really good song.<BR>2) All the other collaborations, most of which hardly feature Beyonce at all.<BR>3) Boring, slow, downtempo R&amp;B grooves.<br />For me, that wasn't enough to enjoy this at all.

B0000399WC|5.0|Papillon is a great movie based on fact that contains many scenes that will stick with you for a long time.  Henri Charierre is a safecracker framed for the murder of a pimp and sent to French Guiana, the prison system in South and Central America.  Along the way, Papillon meets counterfeiter Louis Dega played to perfection by Dustin Hoffman.  The two men struggle to survive amidst the horrible conditions in the prisons.  However, the only thing that keeps Papillon alive is the thought of escape and freedom.  This is a very bleak movie, at times you might not even recognize McQueen with all the makeup, but the ending does offer hope.  The scenes of Papi's solitary confinement and the hallucinations he has while there are very effective and not easily forgotten.  Also, the film decides to show prison life as it is.  This is not a whitewashed version of it, but instead a fairly graphic depiction of the horrors of the French prison system.  Nonetheless, this is still an excellent movie that will keep you interested throughout.<br />  Papillon is up there with The Sand Pebbles as Steve McQueen's finest performances.  His role as Henri \\"Papillon\\" Charierre is fully believable as he attempts over and over again to escape to freedom.  Dustin Hoffman is just as good as Louis Dega, the prisoner who hires McQueen to protect him.  The two become friends as they try to adjust to their new lives.  The friendship between the two men is very good and some of the better parts of the movie involve their relationship.  Don Gordon plays Julot, a veteran prisoner who tries to help them adjust.  Robert Deman and Woodrow Parfrey are also very good as Maturette and Clusiot, two fellow prisoners who attempt escape with Papillon.  I have to add about Jerry Goldsmith's very good score that perfectly fits the film.  The DVD offers a widescreen presentation that looks great, a documentary made during filming that contains interviews with cast, crew, and even Henri Charierre, and also the theatrical trailer.  This is a very dark movie, but it is still a great character study that never really slows down.  McQueen fans will love this classic!
B0000AI44Q|4.0|I enjoy this CD a little more each time I play it.  Boy are there some beautifull songs here.  This is the first Neil Young CD I have ever purchased.  Over the past year I have listened to some of his catalog of music and feel that I missed out on some great music over the last few decades but am now catching up.  It is never too late to &quot;discover&quot; and enjoy a great artist.  Just wish I was more enlightened 30 years ago.  <BR>In my humble opinion all but maybe two of these songs can be consumed in great quanity over a long period of time. This is a CD and DVD that I will enjoy for many years to come.  The song &quot;Bandit&quot; is just so nice to listen too on the DVD, I like the acoustic version better.  Buy this CD and listen to it at least three times and I think you will know what I mean!

B00003CXXM|5.0|Has a nice sence of action, can't deny that. The beggining has the guy lost at sea, kind of mysterious. I really just enjoyed the great job they did with it. You knew when Jason was paranoid, you knew when he sensed there was trouble.<br />Basically, if you can't figure it out, he was set up for an assassination, or was he? Kind of set up, mediumish, anyways all I know is that Jason was shot 2 times in the back, and yea he screwed up probably. So what is it. Well theres some nice fighting, some good gun shooting action, even a nice car scene.<br />He lost his memory, so he is trying to retrace his steps sort of. He does a fantastic job of being a spy like guy, and has some good instincts, I just loved it for the first time though. When you rent it, you don't know what's going to happen. I would just rent the movie, I don't want to spoil it, but Jason has gotta go up against some pro assassins.
B000002H6C|5.0|this album is amazing with ultra fast tracks like &quot;blackened&quot; and &quot;dyers eve&quot; to slower emotional songs like &quot;to live is to die&quot; and &quot;one&quot; and every other song on the disc how can you not like this album. my favorite album from metallica tying with master of puppets. you have to give credit to lars for being able to drum so fast on most of the tracks and kirks guitar playing kicks  on this album and james's lyrics are very deep on ajfa the only flaw with this cd is that the bass is completely shunned out. i play bass guitar and its one of the most important things that makes a band. <br />if you dont have this album and you like metallica buy it!
B00004YRQA|3.0|I went to the store and picked up a second one, which was much cheaper, by like 10 dollars. The official memory card is alright. I think this memory card can get flimsy though, as in worn. Sometimes when I put it in, it doesn't always read the memory card, so sometimes I feel like I am going to lose all my saves, but here it is, it is exactly like those other memory cards. I have a second memory card, it is yellow and has some black markings with a black circle.

B00000637V|5.0|Make no mistake - Berlin is by far the most depressing and disturbing album Lou Reed ever made.  These 10 profound songs create such destructive waves of  melancholy and sadness that I'm amazed Lou weathered (survived?) this period in his life and went on to make such joyful and personal gems as New Sensations and New York several years down the road.  From the disorienting prologue of the album's title song to the curiously anthemic Sad Song that closes this dark journey, Berlin draws you into seedy flats inhabited by addicts, masochists, abused and suicidal women, and an unrelenting procession of  other tenderly-drawn tragic characters.  (Readers of  William Burroughs, Nelson Algren, and Jack Kerouac should especially  &quot;enjoy&quot; this album.)<br />So why the 5 stars?  Music that can conjure a mood, a time, and a place as strongly as Berlin does deserves our attention and our admiration - Lou's characters let us into their lives, let us feel their suffering, and let us identify and understand our own similar feelings, amazingly all from the comfort of our living room couch.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|One of the best TV shows (sci-fi or not) I've seen in a long time.  Great concept (western in outer space!), great acting (Fillion & Baldwin), superb writing (witty combacks etc. worthy of Han Solo et all!).  How did Fox mess this one up when there are shows like Buffy, Angel, SG1, Dark Angel etc. that have done so well.  A lot of people live in hope that they'll greenlight Mr. Joss Whedon ASAP to get back to work.
0316666343|3.0|The book was good to the very end, with the exception of the ending.  I couldn't wait to get to the end to find out if they would find Susie's remains, find the killer, etc., etc. But, in my opinion, the ending was disappointing.  <BR>I liked the author's view of heaven, it gives us a different perspective of what heaven might be (something other that what most of us have preconceived heaven to be).<BR>This is a tear-jerker and there is very little humor in this book (though the grandmother's arrival is a bit humorous).<BR>I would recommend this book, but if your looking for a GREAT ending, you might be disappointed.

0435128752|5.0|I have always enjoyed the Narnia, Alice in Wonderland type books, so when I saw this at the store, I had to buy it.  Every page was well written, exciting, new and frightening.  Many books have been made that copy the style originally pioneered by <BR>Lewis Carrol, but few have managed to convey the feelings of good and evil, confusion, and the world through the eyes of a child.  I strongly encourage any adult to buy this book, although I might be careful about handing this book to any child.  Some of the visual aspects are truly scary and maybe not for children that frighten easily.  A possible exception might be for parents planning on using the book as a read out loud to small children, since that should alleviate any fear.

B00008O31H|5.0|If all you can say about a band is that they're NOT another band (ie: White Stripes), then you have nothing to say. Judge a band and the record on its own, not in comparison to another band's record. The Black Keys are a great sound in independent music, and you should support them because they're a good band, not because they do or don't sound like another over-hyped band that has two members. Oterwise, your review (and opinion) holds no water or validity whatsoever. Do you really think the members of Black Keys sat down and said, &quot;Well, the White Stripes are making money. Let's do a White Stripes album?&quot; I'd bet against it. This album rocks and deserves to be in the collection of any indie music snob. Buy it.

0440237688|5.0|Jonas lives in a community that appears, on first acquaintance, to be perfect. It's a world without crime, and with no unemployment--and therefore no poverty--nobody has to suffer hunger pangs, never mind the torment of starvation and homelessness. All members of a family unit share the experiences and \\"feelings\\" of their day each evening and nobody lies. Or so Jonas believes. Only when he learns that his lifetime job is to be the Receiver (taking on all the memories of both pain and joy that have been banished from his society, and being given permission to lie) does he realise the community's creators have banished even more good than evil from his society. Jonas and his tutor, the previous Receiver, to whom he gives the title the Giver, decide that the cost of their stable society is too high ...<br />Jonas's community clearly doesn't cover the whole world in which it's set, and one doesn't even have to travel over water to reach \\"Elsewhere\\", of which there are hints relatively early in the book. Most members of the community clearly believe that this is where people who are \\"released\\" go. Young readers possibly might not guess the truth here but I'm sure adult readers will.<br />For a book with such a complex set-up The Giver is amazingly short at less than 200 pages. If it had been a novel for adults I think it would have contained a lot more detail on how this utopian society was set up, because it does leave you asking questions about it. Lowry does, however, give enough detail for the purpose of her story and she handles it deftly, never getting in the way of the forward motion of the plot and therefore taking the risk of boring young readers.<br />I was amazed to hear that The Giver was on the list of \\"most challenged\\" books for 2000, on the grounds of \\"being sexually explicit, having occult themes, violence\\". I didn't see anything in it that wasn't appropriate to its audience of young adults. It's a thoroughly gripping read and beautifully written.

B00009ATIX|4.0|Truthfully, I wanted this film because I wanted to see George Clooney's bare bottom and anything else.  But if you want this film just to see that great sight, you may be disappointed.  Don't get me wrong.  I loved this movie.  But this is not the usual Clooney vehicle.  No swaggering Dr. Doug Ross here.  No echoes of Ocean's Eleven.  Instead, we see a haggaard man, overcome with grief, struggling to find sense and answers in a place where confusion and fear reign.  The starkness of the space station beautifully reflect the main character's mind set and the state of grief in general.  This is perhaps the best acting Clooney has done!
0060987464|3.0|he sure does not seem very intelligent.  He claims that Satanism is about everyone being their own god and the worship of intelligence.  If intelligence is blacking out from drug overdoses, sucking other men's penises, and frying a whole in your head with cocaine than I'm just not sure I want to be \\"intelligent\\".  His claims of hating hypocrisy puts him in the same boat with every hypocrite that has ever lived by putting down all these rules of what it means to be an addict and a homosexual and then saying he is neither while breaking all of his rules throughout the same book.  The only thing that partially saved this book was some good writing.  Other than that, it just confirmed for me how \\"unintelligent\\" Brian Warner really is.
6305910340|5.0|Not only does Josh Waitzkin possess a certain genius that most human beings can't begin to understand, but Max Pomeranc's portrayal of Waitzkin is phenominal in this movie.  Pomeranc's performance rivals that of Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense.  His performance is possibly the best of any child actor that I have ever seen.  Spot on!  However, good acting is only the icing on a very good cake.  Searching for Bobby Fischer is extremely well written and riveting. The entire movie just  grabs you from the beginning and doesn't let you go until the credits roll.  I won't go into its plot.  There are plenty of other places on the internet to find out specifics about the movie's content.  Just know that it is an essential movie for anyone who is a parent.

B00000E2VC|5.0|Do you have ears for sheer greatness? Of all the piano records I have ever heard (a great many!) this is in the final top few. The recorded sound is not, I dare say, 'perfect' (whatever that is) but it suits this player very well with its slightly 'soft-focus' effect. And the playing -- well, perfect is hardly adequate as an adjective. No doubt there are music lovers that Michelangeli does not appeal to, and there is no doubt that his manner is individual. I would still suggest that they listen, or listen again as the case may be, to this disc. This is not bijou Chopin, to say the least. Even in the verge-of-audibility pianissimo he uses in the prelude op 45, M's touch is a big touch, and the mazurkas are bigger in their impact than usual. The G minor ballade is rhapsodic and 'romantic' with a lot of natural ebb and flow in the tempo and plenty of natural flexibility in the rhythm throughout, and what sort of music lover can anyone be who is not overawed by that magnificent tone? This is the playing of a giant, and the final section, reputedly the most difficult in all Chopin, gives as good an idea as anything M ever did of the legendary infallibility of so much of his playing. In the B flat minor scherzo his interpretation did not change much over the years. I was fascinated to compare him with Horowitz and Richter here. In the lovely cantabile near the start Horowitz's left hand has an incomparable sparkle. M's left hand is an indistinct murmur with really celestial little highlights in it, the melody has an almost drowsy effect compared with Horowitz's eagerness, and it was a surprise to find that M is actually the faster of the two. Richter is awfully good of course, but, for me, simply less remarkable. There's an interesting touch at the end where M plays a reading I had not heard before from anyone -- the last note is not the familiar high treble effect but an octave B flat in the bass played in quite phenomenally exact time. The other piece is the solitary prelude op 45, and if I had to name a single piece that most sums up for me the unique greatness of this titan of the 20th century piano it would be either this or the account he gave of the B minor scherzo in his 1990 London recital. It is quiet, brooding and smouldering -- I know nothing quite like it. Nor like him.elude op 45, and if I had to name a single piece that most sums up for me the unique greatness of this titan of the 20th century piano it would be either this or the account he gave of the B minor scherzo in his 1990 London recital.

0894803123|5.0|I have several books for making ice cream and I think the recipes in this one are the best. I wish they would write a new book as Ben &amp; Jerry have come up with a lot of new flavors since 1987 that aren't in the book. I wouldn't normally make or buy coconut ice cream, but my daughter asked for it and it was delicious! I added almonds that I toasted myself (saute on a stove in a little butter with salt-drain on a paper towel) and it was even better! You don't need a bigger than a quart ice cream maker--just save the leftover &quot;batter&quot; in the refrigerator and make another batch later.  The recipes do make much more than the book states.
B00005JLZN|3.0|...<br />Kevin Spacey has carved a niche for himself in the annals of Hollywood character actors.  He is the movies' genius martyr/murderer.  Whether he's dying/killing for a greater cause, to get rich, or, to become infamous, he's always the guy who knows better than everyone else.  The movies I am referring to are \\"The Life of David Gale,\\" \\"The Usual Suspects,\\" and \\"Se7en.\\"  Of course ,\\"American Beauty\\" and \\"K-Pax\\" are other variations on this theme.<br />In 'The Life of David Gale\\" (TLODG) Spacey again puts on the genius  mask, the predictable mannerisms, and just the right amount of alligator tear to hoax the audience into a plot twist.  It's getting to the point where we expect a twist, a shock, a surprise, whenever Spacey shows up on screen.  I can no longer see his face and believe he is who he's pretending to be.  It's a sign of impending predictability and eventual boredom.  Watch out Mr. Spacey, your career may be sacrificed next.<br />TLODG is the perfect vehicle for Spacey.  All he had to do for this one was to appear like Hannibal, but alot [weaker].  On the other hand, I can't say enough good things things about Laura Linney and Kate Winslett.  Their performances were strong and convincing.  Indeed, their performances in this movie had to be strong, given the over-wrought script.  Granted, the death penalty issue is philosophically, legally, and spiritually challenging, but this story is simply way over the top.  ...  Their scheme is good drama but far removed from reality based arguments against the death penalty.  Alan Parker has a knack for such over-dramatized stories.  He is a good director and knows how to effectively manipulate the audience's emotions and allegiance, but, viewed through the retrospectoscope, he will probably be noted for his  cinematic hysterionics rather than for his artistry.  TLODG has enjoyed mass market appeal while remaining a critical failure for exactly this reason; texture but no taste.<br />1 star for performances, 1 for direction, and 1 for overall entertainment value, but that is all and there is no more.  This movie is OK at best.

B00006JDVV|4.0|The earth is beseiged by an awesome terror that threatens to destroy all.  Quinn, Christian Bale, wants to hide away from the terror and hope for peace.  Denton Van Zan, played by Matthew McConaughey, wants to eliminate the terror.  Here the terrorists are giant dragons that destroy everything.  It seems that these dragons live on ash.  Destruction of all gives them life and power.  They destroy everything, eat it, and then they hibernate until the earth is replenished.  Van Zan is running out of men just as he figures out how to stop the terror forever.  Quinn refuses to help, preferring to keep hidden away in their fortified castle.<br />This is a movie that works well as action movie as well.  I liked the special effects of the dragons, fire and the landscapes a lot.  I did keep looking at McConaughey and asking myself, is that the same guy from the movie CONTACT?  He does a great job as the focused leader of the American troops willing to sacrifice all, in land far from home to end the terror.  In the end Quinn says you were right!

It was thrilling, visually appealing, wonderfully crafted, and pitch perfect techno score.  I mean there's nothing I could really ask for.  <br />The plot of the movie was repeated thrice because the director is telling us how much a second of each of our time counts.  This is basically it.  If you're so philosophically gifted and old, then probably this movie is not for you.  This movie is so much ahead of its time and definitely a one of a kind.  Definitely a must see.

B00008NRLX|4.0|The biggest criticism that this album has received is that it is not original. Critics have pointed out the obvious influences, including Crosby, Stills, and Nash.<br />The bottom line is that there are only a few bands that can really be said to be completely novel. The Jayhawks are not one of them, but they craft mellow rock songs with beautiful melodies and harmonies. This album is among their finest work.<br />&quot;Rainy Day Music&quot; flows throughout with great tracks. 'Stumbling Through the Dark' is an excellent opener, and it sets the pace. 'Angelyne' and 'Through the Eyes of Sarahjane' are classic Jayhawks songs, delving into country. 'Madman' is a track that most shows the CSN influence, but there are much worse bands to be influenced by.<br />This album won't break any new ground or knock down any walls, but it will grow on the listener with each listen as a damn good set of songs.

Radiohead's been playing their U.S. tour at a number of venues owned by Clear Channel, including the one I saw them play live.<br />If Radiohead thinks Clear Channel is such a beast, why are they still feeding it?<br />But I suppose we all have to accept a little hypocrisy now and for getting beautiful music in return...
B000003TAR|1.0|First of all this is my all time favorite cd (I think its better than nevermind). I also think you should buy it. The lyrics don't really make a lot of sense But also i Think they never were really supposed to make sense at all. its also why nirvana has simple guitar riffs and simple drumming. Nirvana i think is a band that used that to convey The way they thaught of themselves and the world ,that nothing really matters. And that i dea that nothing reallly matters, life sucks, anti government, punk rock type stuffs is why i am giving 1 star because chanses are no one will read my review, and if you do, take my recomendation and  buy this cd. 1 more thing i have the cd nirvana and its a waste of money.

630471193X|5.0|The temptation with Phenomenon is to read into it all sorts of rubbish about new age issues.  For me the movie was a marvelous exploration about the possibilities of the human spirit and mind.  How many of us read as much as we should?  How many of us seek to truly understand our interests and curiosities?  Phenomenon invites us to begin where we are, regardless of education and experience, and take steps to actively continue the learning process.<br />The movie also speaks volumes about how society accepts or, in most cases, rejects a phenomenon that defies understanding.<br />John Travolta shines in one of his very best roles as George Malley, a common farmer who, because of experiences beyond his control, learns just how deep the mind of a common man can be.  His sensitive performance, frankly, was just too moral and good, to warrant any attention by the Academy.  Travolta's performance is very aptly supported by Kyra Sedgwick (Mr. &amp; Mrs. Bridge), Forest Whitaker (Good Morning Vietnam), and Robert Duvall (Lonesome Dove).
B00006F83Y|5.0|Queens of the Stone Age is one of the most underrated heavy rock acts of today.  They prove on &quot;Songs For the Deaf&quot; that they have heavy creativity and expanded musical taste.  They experiment with different sounds.  The Jerry Lee Lewis style piano sound is heard on &quot;Go With the Flow&quot;.  Their U2 influence is expressed on &quot;No One Knows&quot;.  Two of their heaviest rock sounds have screaming lyrics like death metal.  This matches perfectly with the sensuality material on some songs.  Their lyrics have not been dared by many mainstream artists.  The lead singer expresses every word with substance that the audience will surely feel.  This is Dave Grohl's first drumming work since Kurt Cobain's suicide in 1994.  Many who listen to this album will gladly welcome Grohl's return.  Fans of rock music and alternative rock should buy &quot;Songs For the Deaf&quot;.  Many will be influenced.
B00005JMFR|5.0|There isn't a lot of popular support for this theory among the fans, however it makes complete sence in the entire story plot.  Remember you have 6 Matrixes upon which 5 were destroyed.  Now here is the theory.  Each time a Matrix is \\"aborted\\", it is thought of as the real world for humans and another matrix is created off of the old matrix, leaving a loop in the Matrix.  A loop meaning a program is inside another program which is inside another program.  This program in this case is the matrix.  Where all humans are trapped in one huge matrix with mini matrixes inside of it.  In analyzing the beggining of the movie one piece of code is shown, and then the camera moves out of the code to show it is in another piece of code, which then shows it was in a bigger code, and moves out to show it was in a bigger code, etc. etc.  What could be said about the matrix is there is multiple matrixes or universes that make up one big matrix.  This could explain how Neo uses his powers outside the matrix because the entire universe is one big matrix.  This does explain why neo passed out thoughm and here is how.  Each time Neo leaves the chosen matrix for himself his powers grow weaker and weaker.  There were 6 chosen ones each designed for a specific matrix.  Could it be that neo's body carryies the chosenone code that allows him to become the chosen one for his specific matrix??? We'll just have to find out when it comes out this fall.<br />WB
B00008S2VG|2.0|Let's for a moment consider the dichotomy of Madonna. A stale pop-tart who's expiration date has long since been overdue, wishes to convert her excess addicted audience into spiritually conscious citizens of the world. A hypocrisy so blatant that it has eluded all but a few of her most ardent fans. <br />What, haven't you heard? This is not your older sister's Madonna. According to her publicist, she has immersed herself in the mystic discipline of Yoga and has become a devote follower of an ancient Hebrew faith called Kabala. Not withstanding, she has tried but failed to disassociate herself from the original source of her fame: material decadence, sexual experimentation, in-your-face eroticism. She denounces her former vices as \\"the blind folly youth\\", and even claims to not recognize the person that she was. A repentant, reflective Madonna? Please tell me... what's the fun it that?<br />So you say that the new Madonna and is simply older and wiser. She has made her mistakes and now that she knows better, she is doing her best to grow intellectually and remedy past wrongs. Shame on me for being so insensitive, but why can't she also apply her new found her mantra of self-improvement to her music? After all it's an admirable thing for Madonna to want to convey a serious message, it's just not entertaining to listen to.  <br />Am I just Madonna bashing here? What about the album? I've listened to the entire disc at least fives times over the past two days, which is usually enough to arrive at a fair conclusion. A few of the tracks are better than I expected, and one in particular is exceptional.  For reasons that defy logic, \\"Hollywood\\" was never well-promoted and was not rewarded with the kind of airplay deserving of a major hit.  Madonna's sweet siren vocals are fused with sinister synth-drones and an irresistible hook. Edit the inane rapping at the close and you have a recipe for pop-perfection. <br />Highlights: American Life, Hollywood, Love Profusion, Nobody Knows Me<BR>Low points: I'm So Stupid, Mother And Father, Die Another Day<br />p.s. Does anybody out there know the difference between being a fan and a critic? I think Madonna is an intriguing personality, but that's not what I'm reviewing. I'm giving this effort 2 stars based on merit alone, not because the artist has an appealing mystique. I like four of the tracks enough to recommend them. Obviously this album would be more satisfying for a true fan, but I would not suggest it to someone as a valuable addition to their collection.
B00005JLRT|4.0|This is already a good Trek film, and the deleted scenes on this disc make you wish someone had been paying closer attention when they edited the movie.  A couple of those scenes added back in, coupled with a more emotional performance by Stewart, would have made this a fantastic TNG sendoff.  As it stands, the disc looks great, sounds great, and is just what you'd expect from a Trek film - it just isn't at the level of Trek II or Trek VI, or even First Contact.  The character development was a little lacking, and Stewart underplays Picard.  Otherwise a good, fun story that looks likely to be the final chapter of TNG.
B000002L9S|5.0|In 1986, Madonna had released her third album entitled, TRUE BLUE. This album had shown us a new Madonna. The clunk jewelery and black outfits were gone. The rubber bracelets and clunk bracelets were gone. The lion's mane was now cut down to a bleach-blonde pixie style cut. And the outfits were now of a feminine Tom-Boy style. tHIS album is one of the many albums where Madonna has re-invented herself. And this album is another of one of the greatest albums Madonna has ever put out.     PAPA DON'T PREACH   The album's second single. This one of Madonna's greatest songs. In the song (and video), Madonna takes on the part of a teenage girl, who has been dating a boy she really loves. This boy has gotten her ... pregnant. But her boyfriend loves her to the point of moving in with her and helping her raise their child. But, Madonna has a problem ... telling her father, who will \\"Preach\\" to her about what she is doing is wrong. This song went on to become Madonna's fourth #1 hit single (Billboard Hot 100). The second #1 (Billboard Hot 100) was \\"Crazy For You\\" in 1985, and third #1 (Billboard Hot 100) was \\"Live To Tell\\", which I will get to in just a moment.     OPEN YOUR HEART   The album's fourth single. This was actually the first song I have heard from Madonna and it is the song that turned me into the huge fan that I am today. This song's music video is nothing short of a classic, where Madonna takes on the part of an Italin exotic dancer. The little boy in the video tries to get in to see Madonna, but is refused admission, where he stands outside, imagining what Madonna's performance is like. At the end of her performance, Madonna and the kid go running off into the sunset, just having plain old fun.     WHITE HEAT   This is a great song, and is named after the James Cagney movie of the same name. The movie was, I think, a Mob movie from the 1940s, and because this song is very similar to a Mob concept, Madonna named it after the original Cagney movie. Just so you know the excerpts you hear in the beginning and middle of the song, are actually of James Cagney in the film of the same name. On backing vocals is ... Richard Marx, another one of my favorite artists. He had done this the year before his self-titled debut album.     LIVE TO TELL   The album's first single. This song, while being Madonna's third #1 hit (Billboard Hot 100), was also the theme song to the 1986 thriller, \\"At Close Range\\", starring Christopher Walkin and Sean Penn (whom Madonna had been married to a year by the time of this album's release). This is one of the most beautiful ballads Madonna has ever recorded. The song is so haunting, yet so moving. Controversy had stirred up in 2006 when Madonna, after kicking off her CONFESSIONS TOUR, performed this song, while hung up on a mirrored cross, wearing a red blouse and the crown of the thorns, symbolizing Jesus' crucifixion. Madonna has stated that she did not do this to poke fun at the Catholic faith, but to point out the hatred in this world.     WHERE'S THE PARTY   Great party song.     TRUE BLUE   The album's third single. A great tune here.     LA ISLA BONITA   The album's first & final single. This is the first of two Madonna ballads to feature a Spanish influential sound. This is another one of Madonna's major hits and has been perfoming an uptempo version of this song on her CONFESSIONS TOUR.     JIMMY JIMMY   A little bubble-gummy, but the song is real catchy.     LOVE MAKES THE WORLD GO ROUND   \\"Make Love, Not War We say\\", and that's exactly what we all should be doing: making love, not making war. A great song.     This album, in which Madonna had dedicated it to, \\"...My Husband, The Coolest Guy In The Universe...\\", is another one of the great ones in Madonna's catalogue. Make sure not to skip this one.
0679745653|5.0|I have been a fan of the film for a very long time. To be honest, I was not really ure what I expected from the book. It is a very thin book, and the film is rather breezy, so I think the adjective that best describes what I expected is \\"slight\\".<br /><br />In the end, I think the word that I would choose to most describe the book would be \\"sad\\". The film has elements of sad in it, but generally feels good to watch. The book almost hurts to read-- particularly in the ways where the ending is different. I had not really expected this kind of brilliance from Capote, to be honest. I have never been a huge fan of In Cold Blood, the only other book of his that I have read.<br /><br />While the three other stories collected with BAT are also very well-written, special notice should go to \\"A Christmas Memory\\". The collection would be worth reading for that story alone.
B000002L6P|5.0|Madonna became a pretty big star when she released her first album entitled, MADONNA, in July of 1983. But what Madonna did expect was to become an even bigger star in November of 1984, over a year after the release of her first album. In November of 1984, Madonna released her second album entitled, LIKE A VIRGIN. Now, this album has the same style and sound as the first album, with Madonna continuing to dress up in the same style as she did for the first album, but in this situation, it did not matter, for Madonna was still very fresh and new, and because the fans did not care, since this album went on to become Madonna's first #1 album (Billboard Hot 200).     MATERIAL GIRL   The album's second single. This song may have hit the #2 position (Billboard Hot 100), but that doesn't mean that this song wasn't a huge hit for Madonna. This song is supposed to be Madonna stating that most women in the world are very materialistic, always wanting jewelery and furs and new dresses, and such. Madonna even pointed out the song's message in the music video, where she dressed up as 60s icon, Marilyn Monroe.     ANGEL   The album's third single. This song is one of Madonna's greatest and I am disappointed to know that a great song like this was never a hit.     LIKE A VIRGIN   The album's first single. This was Madonna's first-ever #1 hit (Billboard Hot 100). It was the song, just like the album, that made Madonna an even bigger star. This is one of the greatest songs Madonna has ever recorded. Madonna has even decided to sing this song on her CONFESSIONS TOUR.     OVER AND OVER   A great song with a great message, telling us to get up \\"Over And Over\\", if we are knocked down while trying to achieve our goals in life.     LOVE DON'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE   Great.     DRESS YOU UP   The album's fourth & final single. What I love about this song is how Madonna, through words and sense of fashion, talks about how much she loves her boyfriend, telling him that, \\"...Gonna DRESS YOU UP inmy love...\\".     SHOO-BEE-DOO   This is one of Madonna's prettiest ballads. I love that sax solo in the middle of the song.     PRETENDER   Not bad.     STAY   Not bad.     This album has proven that Madonna is here to stay. No matter what those airhead critics think or say, Madonna will remain the Queen Diva. This album shows that to us all, whether you are a fan or not.
B00005JLXE|4.0|But it's a good one. When I first saw it, I was disappointed because I thought it would be better than spiderman. Well it's not, but that doesn't mean it's a bad movie. <br />After watching the special features on this DVD I can see that a lot of hard work went into making this movie, and that made me appreciate it more. Now some people say it doesn't follow the comic book.<br />It does. I mean who cares if the way he was blinded was slightly different? The core of how he got blind remains the same so why do you people complain? What a bunch of nitpickers<BR>-_- So if you hear bad stuff about this movie, just go out and rent it and judge for yourself if you like it or not.<br />Also the casting was perfect for this movie. Collin Farrell does an awsome job as Bullseye. In the comic book, Bullseye is a psycho killer and Collin captures that very well. Also Michael Clarke Duncan is wonderful as the Kingpin. And it doesn't matter if his skin color is different, he IS the Kingpin.<br />Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner do their roles well as Daredevil and Elektra. And the plot of the movie is well written, I can't wait for a sequel. All in all, just rent this movie and don't let any negative comments about it ruin this movie for you.
B000067IZ3|5.0|I don't really know why people insist that the film is about drug trade! I think the film is about humans and their hopes and defects: A very powerful man with no weapon to protect his daughter, a nouveau-rich hot shot who is suddenly in jail, a spoon fed beauty running for money and a superb policeman hoping to provide something for the childhood.<br />The way the film has been &quot;woven&quot; is pretty rare in the new films (it looks like the well-made movies we use to see in the 60's and 70s), and the hazy impression of a fine movie by its humanity (and not graphic) may remind us that Hollywood is still in good shape.<br />A salute to Michael Douglas for taking one step back offering the axial role for Benicio Del Toro: I don't think that anyone else could represent the 3rd world pure and simple man looking for fairness as he did.<br />The characters and the stories of the movie could make at least 3 successful movies; this is in case you would not consider the amazing shooting on Mexico, who could be considered as a masterpiece on its own and a fourth successful movie. <br />It doesn't really matter what is your interest in movies, whether it is the gender, the directors, the stars or simply the entertainment; you should see the movie and considered as a reference (it will make you very picky).
B000002J1U|5.0|This is my favourite Led zeppeiln's album for a long time.<BR>It is much more emotional and interesting than straight hard rockers like &quot;I&quot; or &quot;II&quot; (which are great too).<BR>The using of acoustic guitars and more folk-styled songs are making it one of a kind.it is more colourfull but also more gentle that Zeppelin's other albums.<BR>Some classic rockers like &quot;Celebration day&quot;,&quot;Out on the tiles&quot; and thrilling &quot;Immigrant song&quot; are one of the band's best rock songs written.the acoustic songs are marvelous too.If you are getting into Led zeppelins' music this is a great album to start with - Pure magic!!!
B00009L1TA|2.0|There isn?t really much to talk about; it is a very twisted plot that you may simply twist it again to produce another 10 or 15 minutes or un-twist it once to make a 50 minutes episode of a bad TV series; and if you want to go for 180 minutes' movie? It is still possible; you may simply re-invent another doubled personality (Samuel L. Jackson or John Travolta this time) and we run into the circle once again.<br />One explosion that has been repeated 3-4 times in the movie (I lost the count) to restart the story; and in each time (beginning), there is a missing knot and a weak re-sequence of the incidents. Oh, but the sound of the explosion was well-produced!
B0000AI44Q|5.0|I've been a Neil fan for a long time, but frankly considered his 9/11 song &quot;Let's Roll&quot; an embarassment and thought his last album a bit maudlin, but greendale is an entirely different animal. I admit I've always preferred his electric work with Crazy Horse to his to acoustic albums, greendale has a couple of acoustic songs, but is mostly electric. It's definitely mellower than Ragged Glory but pretty much every song is a winner, and it hangs together nicely as a full album.  I know I'll be listening to it a lot.
630575067X|1.0|Boy did that stink!<BR>I agree with one of the previous reviews,it should be terminated,<BR>with extreme prejudice (killed). This should get negetive five star rating.
B000003TAR|4.0|I like this cd for different reasons then what i liked about nevermind. all of the songs on nevermind are good and easy to listen to, but while there are some not so good songs on In Utero there are some GREAT songs on In Utero.<BR>serve the servants, heart-shaped box, dumb, pennyroyal tea and all apologies are all good reasons to give thius album 5 stars, but the sound quality isnt too great when it coulve been improved, and there are afew songs that i just dont like (milk it, tourettes)<br />so in short this is a great album that u shoud buy if u like nirvana, but this couldve been 5 stars with better sound quality and better song writing
B000002NJS|5.0|I agree with the reviewer who said they have not gotten sick of this album after 5 years.  This is Madonna's best work!  This is an album I will always enjoy listening to.  This album reveals so much emotion and depth.  It's fab!
B000003TA4|5.0|great great cd from a great great band. there are no real &quot;bad&quot; songs on this album and i like all the songs but my favourites are: in bloom, come as you are, lithium, polly, lounge act, on a plain, and something in the way<br />get this cd, along with Ten by pearl jam and OK Computer by radiohead and youll know why the 90s were such a great era
B00005JLXE|5.0|Daredevil is almost perfect! The fight scenes are way better than those of Spider-Man & X-Men, the villains are sinister & cool, & Elektra is hot. Those who bash this great piece of cinematic history are idiots who have no taste. For Daredevil, I'll serve justice to those who hate this movie.
B000002UJQ|5.0|this is the only radiohead cd i own (for now) but after listening to this i want to get all of their cds this cd is sooo great ALL of the songs are awesome (even Fitter Happier, which isnt really a song)<br />My favourite songs:<br />1.Airbag - great opener with the cello, and i love the chorus<BR>2.Paranoid Android - a real radiohead ANTHEM almost a mix of several different songs<BR>4.Exit Music (For A Film) - i LOVE THIS SONG possibly my favourite on the album with the best ending<BR>6.Karma Police - everyone knows and loves this song with great reason, its just soo good<BR>9.No Surprises - cool guitar playing and nice bridge for the song<BR>11.Lucky - awesome song but i dont know why it wasnt realised as a single its pretty damn good
B00007KWHP|5.0|It seems like I have been waiting forever for the release of 'Fragile' on a CD where the sound quality would be as good as I remember it was on vinyl - and now it has.  Hats off to Rhino. I don't know how they do it but this CD sounds as good or better than the vinyl.  I took a chance buying it because of another review I read at Amazon which spoke of the good sound quality.  If you like Fragile, you will not be disappointed.  Plus, Rhino does a great packaging job and liner notes.  I highly recommend this CD.
B000021Y7X|4.0|I'll admit that David Byrne has gotten on my nerves at times, especially when he has seemed to regard Talking Heads as his sole creation, and when he ignored the efforts of other band members (witness his departure from the stage during &quot;Gratuitous Name-Dropping&quot; - excuse me, &quot;Genius of Love&quot; - and why couldn't Tina sing during &quot;Heaven&quot;?).<br />That having been said, the slow build-up of the band during the opening songs is compelling. Starting with a guitar, a boombox, and his skittish character, Byrne wrenches across the stage and captivates your attention. Over the next few songs, Tina, Chris, and Jerry join the party, building up the band and showcasing different styles and talents (check the mellower version of &quot;Heaven&quot;). This being latter era Talking Heads, they continue to bring singers, percussionists, keyboard players, and guitarists on stage, building up to full &quot;Take Me To The River&quot; (live version) steam. The excellent music makes up for the silly white suit.
B000002URV|2.0|This album is certainly a landmark of some kind; every Goth-ish alterna-kid in the early 90s (that was me) was familiar with it, and at the time it was pretty unique, being one of the first CDs to introduce the then-nascent genre of \\"ambient house\\" to the masses. Of course, that doesn't necessarily mean it's a *good* album, and, well, it's not.<br />The CD opens with the painfully pretentious \\"The Voice Of Enigma\\", consisting of spoken word atop floaty synth washes:<br />\\"Good evening. This is the voice of Enigma. In the next hour, we will take you with us into another world - into the world of music, spirit, and meditation. Turn off the light, take a deep breath, and relax. Start to move slowly...very slowly. Let the rhythm be your guiding light.\\"<br />Er, yeah, sure, I'll do that, Ms. Tree Spirit.<br />The material is *very* repetitive; pretty much every track consists of the same Gregorian chant samples, cheesy synthetic pan flute, and synth ambience, with a different breakbeat. Occasionally some gratuitous French spoken word is thrown in, because, you know, anything in French is automatically sexy *and* artistic.<br />The music isn't entirely without merit, but it's so cluttered with new age cliché and faux-arty pretension that it's impossible to listen to. Unless you're the sort who likes to sit around reading about astrology and pretending to be spiritual, give it a miss.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Madonna still knows how to work her crowd and create controversy.  Her album &quot;American Life&quot; shows what she's learned over the last 20 years of her career and her own life.  People are so used to all of her previous albums being huge hits, but this one is even better than most.<br />1. American Life - A good mix of techno and guitar and fun to dance to.  If you enjoy this song, think about getting the Paul Oakenfold Downtempo remix.  Definitely fun to jam to.<br />2. Hollywood - Simple song, but explains how people are so into fame and fortune and forget about the important things in life, which she is admitting.<br />3. I'm So Stupid - Could also be call &quot;Hollywood II&quot; with the same meaning how she fell into a trap of trying to be just some famous star and also admitting what she's done wrong, but yet doesn't regret them.  AWESOME song to jam to as well.<br />4. Love Provusion - Awesome some overall.  Killer beat and another amazing way to add acoustic guitar with a techno beat.<br />5.  Nobody Knows Me - If you take the high frequence sound from the end of &quot;Music,&quot; this is what this song does.  Still an excellent song and a great dance song, but yet with important and meaningful lyrics.  (Personally, I could come up with an awesome music video for this song)<br />6. Nothing Fails - VERY romantic and heart-felt song about the love between her ang Guy.  Definitely one of my top favorite songs.<br />7. Intervention - Shows how strongly she feels that her and Guy are going to make it forever.  Still making this song a hit with her acoustic sounds mixing w/ techno.<br />8. X-Static Process - Different song, all acoustic, but very beautifully sung.<br />9. Mother and Father - Another simple song, showing how she misses her mother and is also apologizing to her father for not thinking he cared about their past.  Great song and fun beat.<br />10. Die Another Day - Awesome techno beat and great dance song<br />11. Easy Ride - Perfect ending toher album.  It leads you to believe it's another ballad until the chorus makes it a hip techno acoustic, which is what makes her alubum different and unique.  Once again, she had another successfull album in my mind.  LOVE IT!
0553208845|1.0|When I first read this book as a junior in high school, I though I would die from boredom. Don't get me wrong, I loved English and enjoyed most of the other &quot;classics&quot; we were assigned to read; from Shakespeare to Vonnegut to Salinger to Steinbeck.<br />Fast forward 25 years and my son was assigned this book in his AP English class and I thought I would give it another try. Maybe as a more mature and experienced adult, I would enjoy it. Nope. It is still the same 160 page sleeping pill. To each, his own.
B000002LTV|4.0|I am a big fan of Bob James.  I have other of his collaboration albums and group albums such as FOURPLAY and find this album to be one of his best collaborative efforts.  This album is great as background music at a social function or just to listen to while relaxing.<br />The album starts out great with &quot;Movin' On&quot; and keeps the pace up throughout the entire album.  The transitions from selection to selection are smooth and have no jarring shifts from mellow selections to upbeat selections.  Even songs like &quot;New York Samba&quot; with it's slightly busy and upbeat tempo blends in with the other selections.<br />If you like modern jazz I doubt you can go wrong with this instrumental jazz purchase.
B000002GYI|4.0|On their 1981 concept album, Kraftwerk combine hitherto unusual percussive effects with synthesised melodies.<br />The effects consist of drum machine beats which simulate the noise made by computers (eg. clicking of silicon switches), and vocals generated or enhanced by computers (eg. an automaton counting to ten).  This successfully creates an atmosphere which revolves around emotionless machines.<br />However, the machines are anthromorphised by two clever devices.  First, many of the same regular melodic themes are used throughout the album, thus at least creating 'identities' for the computers.  [The same idea had been exploited 50 years earlier by Prokoviev in &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot; and Britten in &quot;The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra].  Second, the lyrics are not exclusively generated by machines: some lyrics are sung in a style where one can recognise a human voice.  The content of these lyrics, sung in human style, is nonetheless to do with computers as a glance at the track titles will quickly reveal.  It is this juxtaposition of human lyrical style and computer-related lyrical meaning which completes the anthromorphisation of the computers which are the subject of the album.<br />By comparison with &quot;Autobahn&quot; or &quot;Geiger Counter&quot;, the rhythmic pace is faster than on either of those earlier releases, and similar to that adopted on &quot;The Man Machine&quot;: one might say  Allegretto rather than Andante.<br />As on many Kraftwerk albums, the production is sparse and one is able to carefully understand many of the effects and styles used, simply because they are often used in isolation.  So a beat sequence will be sequenced after, rather than with, a synthesised melody; as mentioned, this allows one to appreciate each individually, and then collectively in the context of the track (and overall album) which they form components of.<br />Listening to the album 22 years after it was first released, one can retrospectivelyrecognise many of the effects as imitated and further developed by Kratwerk's contemporaries and successors.  For example, Depeche Mode's pioneering work &quot;A Broken Frame&quot; (1981) clearly is derivative, percussion-wise, from Computer World even though the melodic structures are different stylistically.  <br />The overall result is a 34 minute concept album which is both ground-breaking and also wonderfully elegant in and of itself.
0312263120|5.0|After reading his other three books I had to give this a try.  Very enjoyable, very fast paced.  Looks like this would be a perfect screenplay...
B000089RVX|5.0|I loved &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; the first time I heard it on the radio.  As awesome as that song is, it's just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the powerful, beautiful, haunting and mesmerizing music on this album.  Amy's incredible voice will instantly grab you.  The variety of song styles is suberb!  The best new album out there right now!
0393307050|4.0|This first book in the series featuring Captain Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin is a thrilling and fast-paced adventure set in the early 1800s. Aubrey is given his first command, a slow brig called \\"Sophie\\" which is unlikely to help him advance in the British navy. With the help of his friend Maturin and the crew of the \\"Sophie\\", Aubrey engages in one battle after another, slowly gaining a reputation and the wrath of the French and Spanish fleets. Now if Aubrey's luck can only hold out as he and his crew are hunted by the best in the Spanish fleet. \\"Master and Commander\\" vividly displays life at sea: the food and weather, the floggings for drunkenness, the severe punishments for sodomy, the great excitement of battle. I fully expected to be daunted by the technical aspects of navy ships, but Patrick O'Brian's masterful storytelling kept me wrapped in the jaunty tale to the end. I am surprised at how much I enjoyed this novel because it's so unlike what I usually read.
080010367X|5.0|Campy yet clever, Men in Black is just a whale of an entertaining movie, sporting all kinds of great action, some surprisingly good dialogue, fine acting by Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith, and a small galaxy full of laughs.  It is actually a little surprising to me that it took so long for Hollywood to make a movie spoofing the infamous Men in Black, mysterious entities who reportedly intervene on occasion in the lives of those having just made significant UFO or alien sightings.  The only thing that should stop anyone from enjoying this movie is a chronic inability to suspend one's disbelief and just sit back and enjoy something meant as pure entertainment and nothing else.<br />The plot isn't that complicated.  Aliens of all sorts have been around for ages on earth, and the public is kept ignorant of their existence because, as Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) says, a person may be smart but people are dumb and would panic if their self-absorbed fantasy reality were to be pulled out from under their feet.  One organization, the Men in Black, makes sure that earthlings are kept in the dark and that visiting aliens are kept in check.  Will Smith plays a New York City cop who unknowingly impresses a top MIB agent by chasing down a disguised cephalopod on foot.  The future Agent J (Smith) is not your typical MIB recruit, espousing some disregard for authority, making light of all kinds of situations, and generally just making everything he says and does hilarious.  He shows up for an \\"entrance test\\" even after having his memory of a most mind-expanding night's events \\"flashing-thingied\\" out of his head, but he doesn't really buy the whole concept of aliens until he sees some little extraterrestrial Cheech and Chong-type fellows inside MIB headquarters.  His first two days on the job are, to say the least, eventful.  A big bad alien bug has landed illegally in upstate New York with designs on stealing a galaxy belonging to a visiting royal family member from another planet, and the fate of Earth hangs in the balance as the offended alien race demands their galaxy be returned to them.<br />One thing I really like about Men in Black is the fact that some of the funniest bits happen outside the main focus of the shot - nothing tops the scene in which, in the background, we watch Agent J attempt to help deliver a non-human baby.  I also got a kick out of seeing executive producer Steven Spielberg subtly identified as an alien.  A number of easy-to-miss references of this type are imbedded in the film, making multiple viewings interesting as well as entertaining.<br />There are plenty of special effects throughout the movie.  The aliens are all done quite nicely (and there is enough exploding bug goo to satisfy just about anyone), while a few of the Batman-type effects have a campy look and feel to them; I actually think campy was the way to go because this movie was not made to be taken too seriously.  The dialogue is actually quite good, I think, including some witty pop culture references, and Tommy Lee Jones' deadpan delivery is the perfect counterpoint to the infectious humor of Will Smith.  Smith has played this type of character before, and no one does it better.  The man is just funny, and it is his performance that made this summertime release such a successful, quintessential summer blockbuster.nd the fate of Earth hangs in the balance as the offended alien race demands their galaxy be returned to them.  <br />One thing I really like about Men in Black is the fact that some of the funniest bits happen outside the main focus of the shot - nothing tops the scene in which, in the background, we watch Agent J attempt to help deliver a non-human baby.  I also got a kick out of seeing executive producer Steven Spielberg subtly identified as an alien.  A number of easy-to-miss references of this type are imbedded in the film, making multiple viewings interesting as well as entertaining. <br />There are plenty of special effects throughout the movie.  The aliens are all done quite nicely (and there is enough exploding bug goo to satisfy just about anyone), while a few of the Batman-type effects have a campy look and feel to them; I actually think campy was the way to go because this movie was not made to be taken too seriously.  The dialogue is actually quite good, I think, including some witty pop culture references, and Tommy Lee Jones' deadpan delivery is the perfect counterpoint to the infectious humor of Will Smith.

B00007GZQZ|5.0|How can critics bash this movie? I was going through a box of old video tapes and found this movie, which I have not seen in years and it just struck me again... I literally toppledover and couldn't stop laughing. The Money Pit is missunderstood to be a horrible movie by critics alike, however, they are so wrong. <br />I miss this version of Tom Hanks. He ALWAYS used to be in comedies and had a special nack for them. I mean, let's face it, when that scene came up where the bathub shattered all over the floor beneath him and he looked at for a second or two, coming to the realization of what just happened and then he starts laughing.... I seriously nearly died of laughter. Not only that, but when he accidently hit his thumb with the hammer and his reaction to the pain.... hilarious. <br />Anyway, DO NOT listen to the critics! This movie is on TV frequently. If you catch it, sit down, watch it, and have a good laugh!
B00005JM4Z|3.0|2 Fast 2 Furious is an extremly exciting movie. It has all the special effects and car races any movie goer could ask for. Unfortuantly the bad acting and weak plot hurts the movie drastically. The movie is about Paul Walker (after being dismissed from his police job) living in Florida and getting money off illegal street racing. When he is finally caught by the Miami Police for street racing, he makes a deal with them that if he will bring down a drug lord he will be able to walk freely and have a cleared resame. He recruits Tyrese his former friend and they hit the streets of Miami to take down the drug dealer.<br />The plot of the movie is extremely boring. Anyone who came to the movie doesn't really want to see a plot, they just wanna see a few people race cars, hot women and for Paul Walker to provide decent acting. Unfortuantley they only ge 2 out of 3. Walkers acting continues to hurt the franchise and he's even worst in 2 fast 2 furious. He not even believeable with half the things he says. Young actor Tyrese is pretty good however and saves the acting. He provides numerous comedic lines and keeps the flow of the movie going. Rapper Ludacris also has role in the movie as the money collector and money disher outer when the races begin and end (if that makes sense.) The visuals in the movie are quite spectacular. The race scenes are excellently done making you feel like your really in the drivers seat stepping on the gas.  <br />All in all the movie is okay but is only worth a rent when it comes out (I based the review on it in theatres) on video/dvd. The lack of a true lead actor hurts the movie (because lets face it Paul Walker isn't anywhere near good) and the weak plot doesnt help. Vin Deasil (or however you spell his name) needs to come back and help the look of a 3rd installment of The Fast and The Furious (if there is one.) Michelle Rodriguez would be nice too. Personally I recommend it.
B00003CXXS|2.0|Please note that the only reason I gave this movie above one star is a terrific plane crash sequence that rivals the first two films as far as suspense goes. But aside from that...what a mess.<br />Well, it's very fitting that this movie was released the same year a movie like Gladiator was. Gladiator was the best picture, and this was a top money maker in 2001 - the year of mediocrity. Movies are becoming more and more of the same as every year passes. I write this review in 2003, when seemingly every movie out in theaters either has a number by its title (sequels) or you can go to a video store and rent an earlier version (remakes). JP III isn't the movie that started this trend, but it certainly stepped in line. It's not a movie that can claim to be the first to do this, but it certainly can be an example of when a movie is both a sequel and a remake. Everything you see in JP III has been seen in the first two films. Lost children, adults that trick the experts into going in the first place, the experts being right about nearly everything, except when they always predict their own death...that never happens. <br />The story is nearly identical to The Lost World...in fact, it happens on the same island The Lost World happened! This time, Ian Malcom is replaced by Alan Grant (Sam Neill), but he to is seemingly unable to shake the demons of his experiences of the first time he visited the Park. He says early on that he would never set foot on the islands inhabited by dinosaurs ever agian, until William H. Macy and Tea Leone come along with a checkbook, promising him to fund his dig for several years (didn't John hammond do the same thing eight years ago? Did he ever see that money?). They tell him that they want to explore the island, but really their son is lost on it. <br />I think the real flaw in this movie is that, while embracing some aspects of the first two, it ignores other, more important ones. For instance, despite the fact that it's the same island as The Lost World, the landscape has totally changed. And the big thing - that new Spinosaurus. No mention of how it got there, or why no one wouldn't have seen it in the previous installment. I understand that this was supposed to be a popcorn flick, no heavy thinking, but it even fails there. The characters are flat, and you don't feel sorry at all for Macy and Leoni (I can't even remember their character names). They can stand for minutes without a dinosaur showing up, then they show up and get outrun and outsmarted by bumbling idiots who don't listen to what Grant has to say. This was a movie designed to get money, which it did. Unfortunately, Speilberg (who produced this one after directing the other two) is considering doing JP IV. Is it me or does that make anyone else shudder?

B000083E79|5.0|Her current single when this was released was a remix of \\"When The Money's Gone\\" yet it isn't on here. Also, some of her songs from the 70's are pretty boring.<br />My favorite track on the album is the ever-amazing \\"After All.\\" It has such an amazing and sentimental feeling that's right for any given occasion. Second favorite would have to go to \\"Heart of Stone,\\" an awesome adult contemporary/rock track.<br />Actually, I like all her 80's rock tracks on here: \\"Heart of Stone,\\" \\"If I Could Turn Back Time,\\" \\"I Found Someone,\\" \\"Jesse James,\\" \\"Save Up All Your Tears.\\"<br />It's unfortunate that they grouped them all at the beginning, with the only exception being the very first track, \\"Believe.\\" After that, they group her dance songs together, which pretty much takes away from them. They included the only 3 tracks off the Believe album I liked! Couldn't they have used the \\"All Or Nothing\\" Metro mix instead of the original? And wasn't \\"The Music's No Good\\" a MUCH huger hit than \\"Strong Enough\\"? But oh well, \\"We All Sleep Alone\\" as well as much of her 70's hits are missing. But oh well, I'd prefer that she purposely keep out tons of her hits.<br />Speaking of 70's/60's, they group all those tracks up also! How lame. The only track NOT from the 60's/70's on the last half of the album is the horrible remix of \\"Different Kind Of Love Song\\" (I'd have much preferred the original!).<br />But whatever, I like well over half the album's tracks, and the good DEFINITELY makes up for the bad! I can't wait to buy her live album!

B000059HAI|5.0|This in-depth portrayal of the infamous December 7, 1941 attack on the US Navy Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor is possibly one of the most researched and accurate historical films ever produced.  It provides a magnificent viewing experience, and despite not having the fancy and exuberant special effects that the recent flick \\"Pearl Harbor\\" was filled with, it is possibly the most enjoyable war movie you can watch.  Unlike the more recent film, which was undoubtedly directed at today's younger crowd, who (aside from myself and those like me) are less interested in history and more interested in lots of explosions and sweet tender emotions, this film did not blaspheme the attack by turning an account of it into a stupid love story.  It's just the politics, strategies, mistakes, and triumphs that made December 7, 1941 the saddest day in American history up until September 11 of 2001.<br />One of the greatest aspects of this film is that it sheds light on the absolute brilliance of the Japanese Naval strategists.  Admirals Yamamoto and Nagumo and Commander Genda were three of the greatest military leaders/strategists of World War II, and possibly, of all time.  The film presents the attack not as a barbaric act of unprovoked massacre, as most Americans would like to think it was, but rather, as a decisive military move in the better interests of Japan.  After all, as (the character who played) Yamamoto stated in the film, the Americans would have been (and proved to be) the most difficult enemy that Japan had ever fought.  The attack was basically an act of desperation, as the warmongering Japanese Army, who controlled politics, blatantly rejected the Navy's pleas to avoid a war.  I was very happy to see this film treating the brilliant Japanese planners and pilots not as the heartless murderers that many ignorant Americans see them as, but rather as the national heroes that they had become for Japan by acting in what they believed was the best interest of their nation.After all, isn't that how we think of our soldiers?  If it isn't, then we need to sit down and examine our conscience.<br />Even without the jazzy special effects, this film recreates the combat scenes very well.  Unless you're a computer geek who believes that special effects make a movie and the story line is just there for the hell of it, you won't notice any problem with the explosions and aerial combat.  In fact, the replica Japanese aircraft (BT-13s and AT-6s modified to look like A6M 'Zeke' [Zero] fighters, D3A1 'Val' dive bombers, and B5N2 'Kate' torpedo bombers) and American P-40s engaging in actual aerial maneuvering was much more spectacular than if it had been recreated on computer screens.  The pyrotechnics used were fantastic as well, and the scene of a B-17 landing with one wheel up was a scene to remember.  On a side note, if anyone was ever fortunate enough to catch the Commemorative Air Force's (formerly Confederate Air Force) reenactment of the attack at an air show, they actually had the B-17 \\"Texas Raiders\\" crank one wheel down and fly LOW over the runway to recreate that very scene!  I'm not sure if they still do that, but that was the kind of thing that made memories!<br />Overall, if you want a truly unbiased account of the attack on Pearl Harbor, without the liberal twist thrown in to make it look like our brass and President were helpless victims instead of revealing the mistakes made by the top levels of our government and armed forces, then you'll love \\"Tora! Tora! Tora!\\"  I recommend it to anyone with an interest in war movies, military history, naval warfare, aviation, or just plain great movies.
B00003CXAT|5.0|Jurassic Park is, on paper, a cheap B-movie. Not really any big name actors (at the time), and the story revolving around dinosaurs. Of course, it wasn't a cheap movie with all the special effects and marketing that surrounded it. And it wasn't a B-movie just because Speilberg made it. He had introduced the world to the blockbuster (Jaws) and had made audiences for the past 15 years laugh (the Indiana Jones movies have terrific comedic bits to them), cry (ET), and cringe (Hook). But Jurassic Park would change the ways movies are made forever. No longer did props, locations and, nowadays, actors have to be readily avaliable - put them in later with a computer. Name one movie today that doesn't have some CGI in it and I can name you 10 that do. 1993 was a turning point Hollywood will, at least for now, not stray from.<br />But as far the movie itself - it is terrific entertainment. From beginning to end, the pictures on screen capture what the camera should be used for. And the CGI never gets in the way of the story, as it does in countless movies today. There isn't an explosion just to have an explosion - it is added seamlessly with great believablity. Of course, the story is simple...scientists go onto a billionare's island where he has been able to re-create dinosaurs. Everything goes pretty flawlessly until a staff worker shuts down the park to try to earn a quick buck - and in turn gets eaten by his own decision - and that in turn strands everyone there with the dinos. The now famous sequence with the T-Rex attacking the tour cars is some of the best suspense since the days of Hitchcock, and although Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, and Wayne Knight may just be those guys you've seen in that other movie, the acting is good too. It isn't great, but it doesn't have to be since the stars are the dinosaurs (like the shark was in Jaws, the movie that invented the summer blockbuster).<br />One of my only complaints is the ending - it really wasn't very well thought out, although there is a great visual in it (for the three or four of you haven't seen it, I won't give it away, it just involves the T-Rex and a banner). So sit back and enjoy the movie that started the computer revolution that you now see in today's theaters. In fact, you could pop this in and enjoy it more than what's out today. FYI: Look for a pre-Pulp Fiction Samuel L. Jackson as a computer engineer.

B00006IUOZ|3.0|Al Pacino stars as Dormer, an LA detective on assignment in remote Alaska.  He is there to help a local cop (Hilary Swank) find the killer of a teenage girl.  Dormer sufers from insomnia, due to the ever-present sunlight in the Alaskan summer; his nerves are frayed, he's strung-out, and he makes a big mistake.  He accidently kills a police officer, and blames the murderer.  That story would probably work except for one thing:  the girl's killer saw him do it.<br /><br />Pacino is outstanding as the morally conflicted cop who can't sleep.  Swank is good as the eager-beaver young cop who must deal with her own issues of right and wrong.  The weak link in the cast is Robin Williams, who plays the murderer, Finch.  We know he can be genuinely creepy, as he was in [[ASIN:B00007976T One Hour Photo]].  It's too bad he didn't bring some of that spine-tingling excitement to this role.  He is much too low-key, comfortable, and cheerful.  The movie lacks suspense of any kind, due to Williams' nice-guy bad-guy.  Fans of Al Pacino will enjoy his profoundly moving performance, but those hoping for edge-of-your-seat suspense will be disappointed.
B000089RVX|5.0|This CD is addictive!  Linkin Park?  I liked them, but Evanescence blows them out of the water.  So original.  I love this CD.  From the first time I heard it, I had to play it over and over.  Her voice is haunting and beautiful.  The lyrics, sound of her voice and music send chills down my spine.  My Immortal - haunting!  Tourniquet - can't stop singing to it.  Great CD!
B00003CXE7|2.0|As universially popular as this movie is, I am apparently a closet case. I hated this movie. The saving grace is Joaquin Phoenix. Now although I understand in the world of internet reviewers, my assessment means squat, but I think I need to get this off my chest.<br />Gladiator is an over-hyped money machine that happened to be released in a down year for Oscar worthy contenders. The huge reason why is because it is nothing more than the merger of Spartacus, Ben-Hur, with some Braveheart sprinkled in for good measure. There is even a scene in which a \\"teacher\\" paints a would-be gladiator with different colored paints to show the different kill areas of a body while in combat - an alomst exact copy of Spartacus. I don't understand what the appeal is to this movie, except that those other movies have been long since forgotten and this can be viewed as a \\"fresh epic.\\"<br />Another overrated aspect of this film, aside from the film itself, is Russell Crowe. While I admired his work a year later in A Beautiful Mind, he didn't show me anything Kirk Douglas couldn't do. Oscar voters were floored by his ability to look angry and mumble lines and swing a sword. Tom Hanks, who also was nominated that year for Cast Away, had to lose 70 punds, grow a 2 foot long beard and carry a movie by himself for 75 minutes, but Crowe's ablilty to kill people was one of the greatest acting jobs ever! I'm being sarcastic, by the way. Phoenix, who plays the villian, is the one who wowed me. He appeared to actually loate Crowe, as I'm sure people do when Russell goes to a bar at night and starts beating them up.<br />I'm not a fan of Spartacus either, but rent that instead of over-rated hype machine of 2001, otherwise known as Gladiator.

He plays a dad who takes his wife and son up in the mountains to be a caretaker to a hotel. But this is no ordinary hotel, in the winter the place gets hunted by ghost of the past. The father starts to see these ghost and goes insane! He smash's the two-way radio and blames it on his son. His wife doesn't like the place, she thinks it's making her husband act strange but he denies it. And the son has something that only a few people have, it's called the shining.

B00003CXB6|4.0|For everything Jurassic Park did for combining the computer and motion picture industries in 1993, The Lost World does seem like a big let down four years later. Lost is the wonder and amazement of seeing humans and dinosaurs co-exist in the same film. Gone is the feeling of newness, only to be replaced with wanting more-ness (sorry, making words up here). Jurassic Park was a brand new puppy - energetic and fun, leaving you wanting more. The Lost World is that puppy that you have to train and house-break. That sense of wonder has all but disappeared.<br />With that said, The Lost World is not a bad movie. In fact, it's above average compared to movies made today. A general rule of thumb with sequels is that a &quot;good&quot; sequel is something that adds to the story, that actually does pick up where it's previous installment left off. Many sequels are just the original all over ago, but bigger and louder. The Lost World is a combination of both. Our hero, Ian Malcom (Jeff Goldblum), has to go on another island with more dinosaurs and less safety to stop greedy animal trappers from getting to the dinos first. There is a lot of &quot;been there, done that&quot; with The Lost World - the T-Rex poking its head inside a tent felt an awful lot like another movie and a T-Rex poking its head inside a jeep, and the running away from the raptors was nearly identical to the first visit to the Park. But there is good stuff here. A scene in which a trailer our heros are in gets knocked off the side of the cliff and Julianne Moore is left on the windshield of the vehicle is able to one-up Jurassic Park's most tense scene. And the ending makes you sit up and go ah-ha. Although if you put a lot of thought into this movie, you will find it incrediably unbelievable. But this is a movie that is just a popcorn flick and, if it were not a follow up to the first JP, could have, and probably would have, been better recieved.<br />However, one thing I do want to point out is that I thinkwas a terrible mistake by the filmmakers was the inclusion of Malcom's daughter. She is played by an African-American, and although the subject of an inter-racial relationship between father and daughter, and ultimately father and mother, isn't played out, her inclusion leaves you with a two-part &quot;So What?&quot; question. It seems as if Speilberg was thinking about making a social statement on the subject of inter-racial relationships, but because he doesn't, you say &quot;So what - why is his daughter African American in the first place?&quot; and &quot;So what - why is she even there?&quot; The character really serves no purpose, except to be another excuse to get off the island. Hopefully I've worded this right so I don't offend anyone, that's not my intentions. But I feel that this is a major flaw in the already flawed movie. However, that being said, because this is a flawed movie doesn't make it any less fun.

0790731002|4.0|This is the third movie to the Batman movies. But the sad thing is Keaton isn't Batman, it's Val Kilmer. The dark edge isn't there but the villains are more evil then ever. Like the last one Batman faced two villains, he faces Two-Face a man who doesn't care about anyone else he just want's to kill Batman at any cost, next there is the Riddler a man who is gives out insane hard riddles every crime he does, he also want's to kill Bruce Wayne. Batman is not alone though, he has Robin to help him on his quest. The movie stays very true to the comics and is kind of funny, most people will like it and kids will love it. So enjoy!
B00006RIO7|4.0|I always find it a little strange listening to the music from Broadway shows without having seen the show.  You can still critique the music but you have to come to an opinion without fully understanding what they're singing about.  I saw Chicago the movie twice and love it and I saw the Broadway show and that it was great as well.  However, I bought this album before I had seen either.  Despite this, several things were clear to me, even though I didn't know how you were supposed to like or what happened at the end of the movie.  The first thing that was abundantly clear was how amazing, surprising and enjoyable Catherine zeta Jones vocal performance (and overall performance, I discovered once I saw the movie) as velma Kelly is.  Her voice throbs with power, and she oozes the [charm], sin and relentlessness of show business.  She starts the soundtrack of with a bang with all that jazz.  Backed by blaring horns, Catherine paints a devious picture and sounds like she's enjoying ever minute of it.  She pulls out a steaming fury and relentlessness on cell block tango, unanimously upstaging the other murderesses and successfully making the song serious, since in the play its more of a comedic thrill than an description of the ruthlessness of the women roxie hart, the main character is surrounded by.  Jones puts the icing on the cake in I can't do it alone, a [charming], funny and desperate attempt by velma to get roxie to be in an act with her.  Jones isn't afraid to let down the strong wall she had in the other songs and wails and belts fabulously.  But back to Roxie.  I feel there is a reason that Catherine won an Oscar and Renee Zellweger, who played roxie, did not.  Ms. Zellweger had no previous musical experience going into this film and I feel it definitely shows.  She's the weak link in this all star cast, and Roxie loses the sass and spunk she has in the Broadway and ends up coming off unlikable and selfish.  Velma is just as [evil] but you end up rooting for her because of Zones' spectacular performance.  Roxy ends up somewhat of a waste of space, especially in the music.  She wines her way through funny honey and barely manages to get through the song roxie without completely falling apart.  Zellweger husky voice just can't stretch enough to express much of anything, although she does insert a flashy, exuberant selfishness to Roxie.  In the end, Zellweger wasn't that bad in the movie, she just wasn't as great as the rest of the cast.  And what a cast it is.  Queen Latifah would've stolen the show if it weren't for Zones.  Her deep, magnificent voice works inconceivable wonders in when you're good to mama, in which she boldly states the wonderfulness and being [evil].  Who knew that the multi- talented diva had yet another career waiting to burst out of her.  Latifah's strong voice and acting could make her, if she chooses to foray into musicals, the next big thing to hit Broadway.  If Renee Zellweger deserved an Oscar nomination for her role here Richard Gere deserves an Oscar for his performance.  He had little musical experience also but what he lacks vocally he makes up for with personality.  He's successfully classy and sarcastic in all I care about and razzle-dazzle.  John C Riley shines on the melancholy mister cellophane and reveals that in addition to being a great actor he's also a great singer.  There are a couple songs here not in the film.  The cut number class, sung by queen Latifah and zeta- Jones is wonderful and maybe even the best song on this album.  Jones and Latifah wail and roar through the song, and the contradiction of the two sinners whining about the classless nature of Roxie is a riot.  I move again pits Jones against Zellweger.  Jones shines through the comparison and Zellweger falters, but overall it's enjoyable.  Danny Elfman's classical numbers are somewhat repetitive but keep with the overall feeling of the album.  However, the two last tracks, cell block tango (he had it coming) by Macy gray, lil Kim and Latifah and love is a crime by Anastasia are unfocused.  While Gray, Kim and Latifah make an interesting trio, they sound quaint, especially in comparison to the flaring music from the film.  The Anastasia song is generic and ultimately uninteresting.  Why they felt like they had to have pop songs on here is beyond me.  Despite this the music from the film is wonderful even without the visual stimulation of the movie.  While Zellweger fails Latifah, Jones, Gere and Riley more than make up for Roxie's ineptitude, creating a bold, [charming], fun ride full of gutsy vocal performances and popping with attitude.
0783222955|5.0|With the all the other heroic roles Gregory Peck played, his potryal of middle-aged Atticus Finch, with no particular good-looks to speak form, was his greatest as his sole Academy Award proves. Although, in the terms of scenes covered, the film may not be very faithful to the equally brilliant book, it retains the true spirit of the story (as well as the major scenes). To add to that, the casting is perfect; the character are all just how I imagined them. The children were particularly impressive, making their characters realistic; Mary Badham acts her role with a childish innocence, very relevant to her character of Scout, which delightful to watch.<BR>    The movie is full of wonderful scenes, with the court trial being the highlight. Gregory Peck's closing defence speech consists of some of the greatest film dialogue of all time. For readers and non-readers of Harper Lee' book, this film will be enjoyable and shame on those (particularly a certain reviewer) who cannot appreciate its message.
B00008GKEG|5.0|The Beatles Anthology is essential to any Beatles collection.  This DVD set, based on the mini-series from 1996, tells the Beatles' own story in each Beatle's own words. The sound is fantastic, the videos are great, and the interviews are very informative and often humourous.  <BR>If the DVD set has one shortcoming, it is in the presentation of the video footage.  I would have personally enjoyed watching the music videos in their entirety.  Only clips were shown of some live footage, and I would have liked to have seen the entire song performed. Also, the interviewees were speaking and sometimes shown during the music videos and live performances, a great annoyance.  It was like watching MTV's TRL at some points, with only a shortened version of a video while someone is talking. <BR>Overall, the DVD collection is absolutely fantastic and well worth its price.  A great companion to the DVD is The Beatles Anthology book.  It provides twice as much information as the DVD and is a compelling read. To understand the Beatles in their own words, both are essential as the DVD leaves out much of the book, but the DVD also has information the book doesn't.
B00004W5UA|1.0|&quot;If you don't like this movie, you must be in denial.&quot; <BR>&quot;...you must be a consumerist tool.&quot;<BR>&quot;...you must not have the balls to accept reality.&quot;<br />Great reasons to see a movie? Well, they're the only reasons to see Fight Club. <br />Read a few of the 5-star reviews. Notice that no one who says, &quot;This movie made me think,&quot; can quite articulate WHAT it made them think? Notice how defensive and snarly they get at the thought that anyone might NOT think it was the premier social statement of our time?<br />Anyone who buys into this mess enough to call it a great piece of cultural commentary is in bigger denial than anyone in the film. See it only if you really believe not seeing it will turn you into a sissy-man.
B00006CXXU|4.0|I'm kind of embarassed to be giving this CD 4 stars, because I'm not a pop fan. I usually don't think the everyday, Backstreet Boy-Britney albums deserve more than 2 stars. There's so much great stuff out there, it saddens me that kids listen to low-quality music like that, probably only because they don't know any better. \\"Stripped\\" is what pop music is supposed to sound like. Christina Aguilera is exceptionally talented, and these songs show it. Unlike her last album, the quality of her voice is clear without the oversinging. Britney Spears could never, ever, pull off something like this. <br />  Christina explores more musical styles with this album, experimenting with blues, hip-hop, rock, and latin. Rest assured, there's still plenty of pop, and her ventures into other territories are done well, only making the music more interesting. Highlights include \\"Walk Away\\" (her voice is amazing on this), \\"Infatuation\\", \\"Loving Me for Me\\", \\"Beautiful\\" (Which is never old, no matter how much it's played on the radio...the sign of a classic), \\"Cruz\\", \\"Get Mine, Get Yours\\" (A song about, yes, casual sex. It's as tastefully done as is possible for the subject.), \\"I'm OK\\", and \\"Singing my Song\\". The other songs are good, but don't, in my opinion, achieve the excellence of those tracks. <br />  Nothing is perfect, though, and neither is \\"Stripped\\". I have a problem with the \\"interludes\\" on the album, which I find annoying. It feels like they're trying to make the album look or seem longer, which it does, but not in a good way. Also, I felt that some of the songs only seem good because of the sheer strength of Christina's voice, and that this was known when they were being written. Don't get me wrong, Christina pulls it off...I just don't think a voice like that should ever have to sing anything less than exceptional. I find some of the rapping a bit aggravating, too. Every song these days seems to include rapping, and I'm getting sick of it. Besides, they're taking up time during which we could be hearing Christina sing! My final complaint is the song \\"Dirrty\\" (one of the two songs featuring a rapper), which was obviously made to be the \\"single song\\" and has a very conventional beat. The singing is the only thing that saves it from being unlistenable.<br />Overall, though, very good. I think Christina Aguilera has the talent and staying power to have a very long and satisfying career within the music industry. Hopefully she keeps up the good work, and keeps on singing her song, as she says.
B000006OBQ|4.0|In baseball terms, Frank Sinatra was a power pitcher. And &quot;Sinatra At the Sands,&quot; now remastered, presents a veteran hurler at the very top of his game, surrounded by Gold Glove teammates -- Count Basie and his Orchestra, arranged and conducted by Basie's protege, a young Quincy Jones.<br />In fact, the Basie band doesn't accompany Sinatra as much as propels his songs forward -- especially Sonny Payne's incomporable drum work. These are driving, powerful tunes, even the ballads, and Sinatra's strong, confident delivery is matched perfectly by the powerful, swinging &quot;in-the-pocket&quot; tempo of the arrangements. <br />Both &quot;Fly Me to the Moon&quot; and &quot;My Kind of Town&quot; manage to be even better than the studio recordings. And in  &quot;One For My Baby&quot; and &quot;Angel Eyes&quot; Sinatra shows off something in his voice you rarely associate with the Chairman: Heartache. <br />Knowing that the album was a product of the macho 60s, not the more &quot;enlightened&quot; 21st Century, I still cringe when I hear Sinatra's jibes at Sammy Davis Jr. during Ol' Blue Eyes' &quot;Tea Break&quot; monologue.  And in listening to &quot;I've Got You Under My Skin,&quot; I admit I miss the strings that build the anticipation up in the bridge to the powerful trumpet-and-trombone interplay in the middle of the song. <br />But the places where the album shines fare outnumber those that it doesn't. For pure musical enjoyment, &quot;Sinatra At the Sands&quot; is a gem, from the first pitch to the final play.
B000002LQR|5.0|To begin with, I came from only knowing the The RHCP from their singles and their latest CD, By The Way. It took me a few play throughs to truly enjoy what was being thrown at me, but when I caught on, it was amazing. Every song on this cd is perfect, from Breaking the Girl, Suck my Kiss,Could Have Lied, Mellowship Slinky in B Major, Give it Away, Under the Bridge, Apache Rose Peacock, Greeting Song, Lovely Man, and Sir Psycho Sexy. My favorite without a dobut is under the Bridge, its just such a great song. If you also listen closely enough to Sir Psycho Sexy with the cop, you'll have a grin on your face. I would highly recommend this album!
B0000AI44Q|4.0|I may be somewhat biased because I recent saw Greendale performed live, but this record is a wonderful ode to idealism. Young makes his case that our real values are just beneath the surface and can break through the greed capitalism that puts the dollar above truth, justice, and the enviroment. My favorite songs are &quot;Falling from above&quot;, &quot;Sun Green&quot;, and &quot;Be the rain.&quot; Musically, this album is far better than other concept albums and is one of Young's best....warmongers and polluters may not like it.....

630542845X|5.0|&quot;Powder&quot; has to be one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. It reminds me of just how little we really know about ourselves as humans, and what we just might actually be capable of if we don't hold ourselves back.
B000089RVX|5.0|This is an outstanding CD.  Amy Lee's voice is incredible.  An unusual, but excellent mix of piano, orchestration, and hard guitar.
B000005RFM|5.0|I won't bore you with a song by song breakdown of this - THE GREATEST ALBUM OF ALL TIME! <BR>I'll just say this: This album was meant to be listened to - multiple times, preferably with headphones, and with the volume CRANKED! <BR>Just listen to it, then you'll understand what music is all about.
B00005JKZV|3.0|Last year I bought the first episode DVD when it was released in last August, only to beoff when they released an extended edition in November for just a couple bucks more.  Amazon says that the extended edition of this movie episode will also be out Nov. 18, 2003 (and you can even preorder it) so don't be suckered into buying both.  Wait until November and buy the extended edition.<br />Best Wishes
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I just saw Donnie Darko and I think that it was amazing.  It was sarcastic, ironic and different than any other film I have ever seen.  The ending was great, but it made me cry.  Donnie spends the entire movie (takes place during a 28 day period) trying to figure out if we all die alone.  While he does this, he falls in love, finds out how much his mother loves him and exposes town scandals.  Though the ending was clever, it made me sad to think that all of that never happened.  He goes back in time and the whole movie never happened and to top it off, he is killed.  While he listens to his hallucinations in the beginning of the movie and gets out of the house, he doesn't when he goes back in time and is killed by the time travel machine.  When the girl he fell in love with is asked if she knew him, she reply's that she didn't.  Though he does find that we don't die alone, it's still a little tragic.
B00005JM0B|5.0|T3 is a must see for true terminator fans.Before I saw it, I didn't realy know what to expect.When I did, it completly blew me away with all this new information I was getting. I belive that Claire Danes charactor fits in nicly with the Terminator world. At first I hated the fact that Eddie Furlong won't be coming back as John Connor, and that Nick Stahl would become mankinds savior. But now that I've seen the movie I can't see Eddie in this role. It's rumored that there might be a T5 or a T6 becouse nicks is singed on for Two more. Well, we can only hope.
B00005IC2H|5.0|Every now and then you need a cd to sleep, take a bath, or read a book to. Frankly I own a collection of hardcore punk and metal, and when it came to me passing out on my bed I needed something that would relax my mind instead of blasting it away. Sigur Ros are my messiahs in this retrospect. Buy this cd, fall asleep, read a book, take a bubble bath. Yes!
B0000025DV|5.0|The ELO evolved from The Move, a late sixties pop group famous for Flowers in the rain and Blackberry way, but their music is noticeably different. Although my favorite ELO album is A new world record, this is a very fine album in it's own right. Originally released as a double LP, it is a classic example of ELO's music.<br />The standout track is Mr Blue Sky, a happy, upbeat song that was (at least in Britain) the biggest hit on this set - the other UK hits were Sweet talking woman, Turn to stone and Wild West hero. Although the hits were mostly upbeat, rocking songs, most of the album is actually quite mellow by comparison. Still, the blending of orchestral swirls with rock rhythms makes for interesting listening. I think the hits are actually the best tracks here, but there are several other gems, most notably Across the border and Birmingham blues.<br />If you are unfamiliar with ELO's music, I recommend you go for a compilation of which there are plenty to choose from including double CD's. However, if you like their famous songs enough to be interested in exploring further, you will find much to interest you here.
B000069AUI|3.0|Coldplay's new album to be released on 26 august 2002 and exicitment courses. Into the shop and then into the cd player, shoot score! WELL good album. and then i listened to it again and i worked out how irritating a whisper is and then daylight and then Mtv murdered clocks and narrowly avoided distroying the scientist. Last month they release one of the weakest songs: god put a smile upon your face. And we're supposed to be happy. Parachutes was an album of absolute brilliance ft. amazing songs like Parachutes, Everything's Not Lost and Trouble. The album's only amazing points are Amsterdam, AROBTTH, and Warning Sign. there are other good points like the scientist and politik. but what has become of the band who wrote See You Soon and Careful where you stand and even Bigger Faster. Check out those songs and you'll understand how good coldplay really can be. The thing is right, Coldplay were a band that envoked so much emotion inside of you that you wanted to burst into tears and alot of that was due to the subtlety of the music making it seem like they were holding some part of themselves back for the next release and urging you to listen to the album over and over again. This time round Coldplay goes pop, they sound like a band more concerned with sales than music and it shows with how successful it has been. There is no doubt Chris Martin is brilliant but he is using that brilliance soley to make money
6304493681|5.0|If you like a combination of action, (oriental) philosophy and beautiful women, you're definitely going to love this movie. It's definitely in my personal top 5, and I think it can only be compared with &quot;the matrix 1&quot;. If you liked that movie, you're probably gonna like this one too.
B00000634J|5.0|Ultimately, John's reputation rests primarily on the songs he wrote and the music he recorded as a member of the Beatles, but he also recorded some great music after the Beatles split up and this collection includes the best of it.<br />Of the tracks here, the most famous of all is the truly brilliant song Imagine, but the lyrics demonstrate the difficulty of achieving world peace. John asks us to imagine there's no countries, no religion, no possessions - of course, these are the things that are the cause of all the wars.<br />There are several other well-known songs here, including Power to the people, Just like starting over, Woman, Give peace a chance (this song was recorded and released as a single while John was still with the Beatles) and the Christmas classic Happy Xmas War is over. All these songs were big hits from John in Britain and elsewhere.<br />Also included here is John's original version of Jealous guy, a song that he wrote but which eventually became a British number one hit for Bryan Ferry. John showed that he could also record other people's songs - his version of Ben E King's sixties classic is included here.<br />Even though the overall standard does not match what he did as a Beatle, there is plenty of great music here - easily enough to justify five stars. All fans of seventies pop and rock should have some of John's solo music and this collection provides all the essentials.
0684800713|5.0|Reporter Jake Barnes, a foreign correspondent, is rather deeply in love with the high living Lady Ashley Brett. Building a relationship from this, however, is impossible for them, due to an injury he sustained in the war.<br />The love between Jake and Brett is established in the first chapter and recalled in the last - the rest of the novel tells of an unhappy vacation in Spain wherein several men come to self-destruct when their romantic interests in Brett fail. This is the first true appearence of Hemingway's famous \\"Iceberg Technique;\\" we infer Jake's pain and scars by watching the suffering of other men. If their superficial connections to Brett are enough to cause such hurt, we can only imagine what Jake must feel.<br />Hemingway's language is terse, his descriptions are simple, and his characters are only outlines, but none of this matters - the book is cheap, short, and easy to read (I finished my copy in a few hours). Most importantly, though Hemingway will not do everything for you, he has no need to. Where one lets the eyes and mind collude to turn single photographs into motion pictures, the heart will turn books like 'The Sun Also Rises' into something vibrant, intelligent, and alive.<br />Jake Barnes and Ernest Hemingway, you and I, all know what it means to love and hurt. Good books teach us lessons, but great ones seek to remind us of all the things we'd rather forget.
B000002KLP|5.0|Prince pulled out all the stops with this one.  My mother banned me from seeing him perform after hearing the album, but I got older and went to all the other shows. (smile)  The grooves and not to mention the racy lirics is enough to sign you up as a fan for life.  The title track &quot;Dirty Mind&quot; gives you a preview of what's in store, in addition to &quot;Sister&quot; and &quot;Head&quot; &quot;When You Were Mine is just down right cute.  But my ultimate favorite is &quot;Gotta Broken Heart Again (it will make you wish you were there to wipe away his tears).
B0000AXE8I|5.0|The Matrix: Reloaded is the beginning of a 5 1/2 hour movie(the other 2 1/2 hours is going to be The Matrix: Revolutions) and it does not disappoint. Some people  say that most of the film's scenes have no importance or purpose, but those people do not have the foresight to realize that every scene in the The Matrix: Reloaded will have a huge impact on The Matrix: Revolutions.  After you people see Revolutions, you will regret that you disliked this movie and you will rush to the store to buy Reloaded and put the pieces together. I promise you.
B00006RCNW|5.0|This is one of the best series out there that and a must see!  I can not wait to see the next one!  We have your \\"dirty cops\\" and your \\"good cops\\" but you can not help like the dirty cop for the way he does get his job done and he does work with the good cops to get the job done.  This series ends with a nice twist and like I said, I can not wait for the next to come on DVD as well!
B00000DFSK|5.0|While U2 aren't necessarily my number one favorite band of all time, they are among the greatest rock bands to have ever existed and they are an excellent example of a group that was riding sky high in the 1980s, both commercially and quality-wise, and still kept every bit of their edge throughout the 1990s, even with a slight dip in commercial sales (1997's \\"Pop\\" is vastly underrated) but through it all, they have weathered the storm and are still a class act in the dawning years of the 21st century. U2 came out of nowhere with their 1980 debut album \\"Boy\\", and built greater and greater success through the mountain climbing that was 1983's \\"War\\", the following year's \\"Unforgettable Fire\\", their commercial magnum opus, before temporarily imploding with their often misunderstood 1988 live album \\"Rattle &amp; Hum\\". <br />Who can ever forget the unsettling lyrics that made \\"New Year's Day\\" a timeless anthem for the dreary winter days or those punching guitars that opened \\"Pride In The Name Of Love\\" had forever burned that classic into our memories whether for agonizing torture for those who disliked their music or great memories for those who love this bands music (I fall into the latter category). And then there are those famous anthems \\"Where The Streets Have No Name\\", and \\"With Or Without You\\" that propelled their 1987 album \\"The Joshua Tree\\" to becoming one of the biggest selling albums of all time, and deservedly so. <br />This 1998 collection chronicles that unforgettable era in their career with 14 tracks from seven of their eight albums during this decade. This album completely ignores 1981's \\"October\\" for some odd reason. Besides, some of the songs are shortened, a couple are shortened to a damaging level that it mars some of their punch but they are still very good, just a little inferior to their parent album counterparts. &quot;New Year's Day&quot;, &quot;Where The Streets Have No Name&quot; in particular suffers from this. As for the shortening of the original songs though, the versions on here are the single edits that we hear on the radio. It's for these reasons that I recommend their regular 1980s studio albums over this collection as they have even more gems that are left off this collection particularly on &quot;Unforgettable Fire&quot; but I'm totally cool about that as the albums have so many non-single gems that it would be downright impossible to put on this album. This collection, with more songs crammed on here, edits or originals, especially one or two from &quot;October&quot;, could've been a lot more complete at around 75+ minutes. <br />This collection doesn't quite come off as a total cash-in though. There is one `new' song on this collection. That song is &quot;The Sweetest Thing&quot; which is actually a revamped rerecording of one of the 1987 B-Side of the same which can be found on the second disc of the B-Sides editon of this collection which I highly recommend. The version on this CD has a slightly orchestral style and less electric than the original. Both versions are very good in my opinion and it's a toss-up for me on which one's better. <br />Many seem to have a grudge against the last four tracks on this album. To me, it is quite unfortunate as these last four songs on this CD are very good. &quot;Desire&quot; is a totally funky and highly groovy blend of their trademark sound and some American-style blues rock thrown in giving the song a bit of a Western Stadium Arena atmosphere. The next three songs found U2 experimenting even more with American blues style music. &quot;When Love Comes To Town&quot; is an all out fun ride of a classic with a guest appearance from blues legend B.B. King and it totally works in just about every level. &quot;Angela of Harlem&quot; is a very delightful song with a slightly 1960s sound to it. &quot;All I Want Is You&quot; closes out this collection on a very good note with a very dramatic feel to it that almost forshadows some of the eeriness of &quot;ThrowingYou Arms Around The World&quot;. The gradually grows more dramatic as the orchestra grows more and more intense before it all implodes at around the 6:28 mark. I have to revamp an earlier part of this review as the final track is listed as the final track but there is actually a hidden track that is a very pleasant piano interlude that is actually the title track to their 1981 &quot;October&quot; release so this collection doesn't completely ignore that album. They could've just made the hidden track the fifteenth song on this CD as opposed to hiding it within track 14. This is in my opinion, the biggest flaw to this collection. Quite simply, I totally object to the criticisms that have been flung at these four tracks from &quot;R&amp;H&quot; Maybe I have only been reading negative reviews on them but I personally think that these four tracks from &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot; are very good songs even though they don't quite rank up with the rest of the songs on this CD. <br />Veteran fans who have or are familiar with U2's original 1980s albums will find little reason to buy this edition of this `best of 1980-1990' collection except for maybe &quot;Sweetest Thing&quot; but the 2-CD edition of this collection is totally worth getting even for those who already have their regular albums as the B-Sides are just as good as their hit singles. This 1 CD edition of this album is more of an introductory album for newbies who want to put their feet into the waters of this bands arc of music or for completists. The B-Sides version I ask that ALL U2 fans buy. This collection has it's flaws with the shortening of several of their songs but not as glaring as those that stymied the 1990-2000 collection. I highly recommend the 2-CD editions of both of these collections although this era in U2's career was much better represented as none of the original songs on here were rerecorded like several songs were on the second hits CD.

B000002G8L|4.0|This album has always been a favorite of mine.  Some may call it a blues album,and to an extent it is, but this is rock and roll at its best. I feel that it captures Clapton at a high point of his solo  career.One could justify getting this just for song Double Trouble, which gets a blistering work out, better than studio version on No Reason to cry. While most songs are bluesy type country flavored work outs, there are a few well known Clapton songs \\"Wonderful Tonite\\" , Lay down Sally\\",\\"Cocaine\\", it is the guitar solos on the older standards that make this one of  Clapton's most satisfying album. If you dont want to get the entire \\"Live Crossroads\\" box set, this lp is a good slice of his 70s live work.
B00005JM09|4.0|Just came back from watching T3 (a little late, I know). I feel sort of empty, actually. You'll get it if you've seen the ending.<br />I thought the film was rather good. A little less explanation and story than T2, but still very entertaining. A lot of reviews I've read complain on how T2 had pretty much ended skynet and T3 doesn't explain why the terminators have STILL been developed.<br />Well, it's pretty logical. The Terminators were always going to be invented. They had been invented through technology in T1. Yes, in T2 they had found the arm and chip of the Terminator in T1 and used it to develop the machines. But in T1, they didn't have anything to work with and STILL they created the machines.<br />So yes, everything was destroyed in T2, but that doesn't mean development hadn't started over. From scratch.<br />The scene in the movie I *loved* was when the Terminatrix tastes John Connor's blood on the cloth. Her reaction shows just how important John is going to be in defeating the machines; if a robot (especially this one) can look that shocked, pleased and overwhelmed by finding him, he must be EXTREMELY important in the future (here I was, thinking ,,What can one man do?\\").<br />The scene I thought was kind of stupid was when the male Terminator has been reprogrammed and is in serious doubt about his missions. It was all a bit unbelieveable, too corny and drawn-out.<br />Anyhow; not a lot *really* happens in T3. Nothing that would take me more than 3 lines to explain. But it was incredibly entertaining, time flew by and it is a very great and very obvious setup for a T4.
B000006MS3|5.0|This is the best music in the world. By far. Obviously there is always the whole 'matter of opinion' thing. Hmmmph. Yes the Hounds Of Love is superb, many would say that is Kate's best work. Nah.<br />I would review every song but there is no point. I cant really find to describe. I'd much rather urge you to buy this album, listen to it again and again if you must. You will soon understand.<br />'The Dreaming'. Every song is perfect. I have never got bored of, I doubt I ever will. If I die and go to heaven I will demand a copy.
B00005JLSE|5.0|\\"Chicago\\" is one of the very best movie musicals to come out of Hollywood in a long long time. It has a stunning cast with all the principals turning in memorable performances. I have always liked Catherine Zeta-Jones but in \\"Chicago\\" she simply bowled me over with her tough sassy turn as Velma Kelly. Renee Zellwegger was a revelation as Roxie Hart. Who ever thought she could sing and dance like that? Richard Gere was wonderful as was Queen Latifah and John C Reilly who I also never knew could sing. His rendition of \\"Mr Cellophane\\" is heartbreaking. Kudos to Rob Marshall for the superb direction. For those who are comparing this with \\"Moulin Rouge\\", don't. They are two different types of musicals and both are brilliant in their own way. The DVD also contains the deleted song \\"Class\\", a brilliant duet between Catherine and Queen Latifah which should not be missed. Bravo!
0385504209|1.0|Amazon chose to ignore my earlier review, but buyers/readers still need warning.  This is a badly crafted, poorly written book.  However, if you must read it to see what all the fuss is about, lower you expectations to rock bottom.  Then ask yourself, how do these things get on the bestseller lists anyway?
B00005JKZV|5.0|This movie has it all, Great  acting, great action scenes, great talking scenes, and a great directer. There is absolutely nothing bad you can say about this movie. Go rent it! PG-13 for Epic Battle Sequences, and Scary Moments. Not a movie for children, teen through adults only.
B00003CX9E|5.0|Anyone who has told you that this movie is bad, is full of it. It is undoubtedly one of the greatest movies you will ever see. It is so good, that I would recommend buying it even if you haven't seen it, the extras are so good you will get atleast 10 hours of entertainment out of it.
B00007ELEL|4.0|Wow. What a film. What a marvelous, glorious film. While there is essentially no plot, and what little there is makes little sense, this PERFECTLY cast movie is crammed with so much good stuff, so much inspired lunacy, that you will find yourself not caring a bit.<br />Though Jeff Bridges is the main character, and a fine job he does, the real star is John Goodman, that big jolly man who frequents SNLs and other Coen Brothers movies. Absolutely NO ONE ELSE could pull off the role of Walter, the militaristic Vietnam vet obsessed with his ex-wife, to the point of converting to Judaism and refusing to do anything, including bowling, on the Sabbath. The energy conveyed by Goodman in this role, in particular when fighting the German nihilists, is truly inspiring. Also in fine form is Steve Buscemi as Donnie, the misfit third wheel who is constantly out of his element. Bridges portrays the philosophical slacker with laid back ease. Julianne Moore is unflinchingly brilliant as the ultra-artsy feminist Maude Lebowski. Young Tara Reid, pre- AMERICAN PIE, plays a perfectly idiotic trophy wife, a role she seems born for. And do let us not forget Jesus the Bowler, played with sexual, perverse flair by John Turturro. And the seasoned veteran Sam Elliot does not disappoint as the narrating cowboy.<br />In more minor areas, the millionaire Lebowski is excellent; the German nihilists, including Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, are menacingly silly; the porn kingpin Jackie Gleeson is an effective slimeball; and the Malibu police officer (\\"stay out of my beach community, you bum...\\") could not be better.<br />Filled with skillful shots, including one from a bowling ball, repeated references (\\"It really tied the room together\\"), and surreal nonsense (\\"Gutterballs\\"), this is not to be missed. By any means. The Dude Abides.
B00009P1O0|4.0|Aside from the dull &quot;Vampire Blues&quot; and the annoying &quot;For The Turnstiles,&quot; this one is hard to match. &quot;Walk On,&quot; the only upbeat number on the release, is quite funky and features some of Neil's most creative electric guitar playing. The slow &quot;See The Sky About To Rain&quot; is atmospheric, highlighted by Neil's strong keyboard work. &quot;Revolution Blues&quot; ranks among Young's best electric tunes, with lyrics that are disturbing and funny at the same time. Great rhythm guitar work here from David Crosby. The second side boasts the moody &quot;On the Beach&quot; with memorable lines such as &quot;I need a crowd of people, but I can't face them day to day,&quot; and the acoustic-themed &quot;Ambulance Blues,&quot; which I never grow tired of hearing. I'm not sure what Neil's trying to communicate (he admits in the lyrics, 'It's hard to say the meaning of this song'), but the music, featuring some unforgettable fiddle, more than makes up for the disjointed words.
0440237688|1.0|...<br />I'm the most bookish member of my family, and the only professional writer (pharmacology, medicine, government regulatory horrors) in the house.  As such, I've often been called upon to handle the kids' -- and now the grandkids' -- difficulties with school work.  My eldest granddaughter had been tasked with a summer reading assignment centered upon Lois Lowry's novel *The Giver* (1993), and she brought it to me because she was directed to read it with an adult.  Her mother and both her grandmothers decided that I'm the adult.  Oh, well.<br /><br />To skip forward a bit, as the granddaughter is now obliged to deal with the wad of photocopied work requirements associated with this book, I've been digging through the Internet to find background on this novel, and some sort of insight into the teacherly impulses so obviously behind the pre-packaged study assignments dumped on the poor kid in June.  In the process, I've discovered (to no surprise whatsoever) that there's a massive presence for this horrible thing among the ex-Education majors.<br /><br />Understand, please, that I'm a science fiction fan.  I'm thoroughly steeped in the genre.  I also get my living through research and analysis.  Spotting logical inconsistencies, intellectual sloppiness, and lapses in reasoning is the habit of a lifetime.  I also used to read a lot of children's and young adult literature when my children were of an age to plough through such stuff, and I found much of it well-enough written to be pretty admirable.<br /><br />When I began reading *The Giver* with my granddaughter (who's a bit dyslexic, and needs plenty of help to translate text-on-page into thoughts-in-mind), I kept turning from the contents to the cover, unable to believe that this thing had actually won a Newberry Award.  This book was supposed to be on a par with *Maniac Magee*? Or *A Wrinkle in Time*? Or even a second-place finisher like *My Side of the Mountain*?  Then I checked out the Newberry Awards list, and took note of more than a decade of Major Suckage in kids' literature (to which, I confess, I've paid not a whole lot of attention in the years between my own kids' growing-up and the rise to reading of my grandchildren).<br /><br />\\"Ah,\\" I realized. \\"John Taylor Gatto's *Dumbing Us Down* - with a vengeance.  Of course.\\"<br /><br />*The Giver* falls into a speculative fiction genre commonly known as \\"the dystopia novel,\\" which includes Ayn Rand's *Anthem* (1938) as one of the earlier examples.  To the limitedly literate, Orwell's *1984* is perhaps the best example of this sort of \\"if this goes on\\" procedural, drawing horrible future visions from what are supposed to be lucidly reasoned extrapolations of societal ghodawfulness either proposed or actually in train at the time of writing.  There are many more examples, one of them being *An Enemy of the State* by fellow physician F. Paul Wilson, written during the galloping inflation of Jimmy Carter's idiotic presidency.<br /><br />As a dystopia novel, *The Giver* is an example of Extreme Major Suckage.  It is fundamentally dishonest as speculative fiction, and Ms. Lowry is wonderfully fortunate in that the majority of children today - the victims of \\"dumbed-down\\" government schools - are not customarily exposed to books like Alexander Key's *The Forgotten Door* or the juvenile novels written by Robert Heinlein during his contract with Scribners' in the '50s.<br /><br />(At this point I recommend that the people praising *The Giver* read Heinlein's *Between Planets* [1951] or his *Citizen of the Galaxy* [1957].  Compare Don Harvey of the former book - or Thorby Baslim of the latter - to Jonas of *The Giver*, character developed against character, situation contrasted against situation, context versus context, and consider that not only were Heinlein's books written for kids of the same age as my 12-year-old granddaughter but they hit print about 40 years *before* Ms. Lowry published *The Giver*.)<br /><br />The plenum - the \\"world\\" - of *The Giver* is logistically untenable.  That's a fancy way of saying that it's too damned fragile to survive for any appreciable time as Lowry has described it.  Societal systems of such cloying control, if they were liable to a breach such as that effected by Jonas in the story, would have been ripped to shreds long before the events of this novel.<br /><br />This is an important defect, inasmuch as speculative fiction of both types - science fiction and fantasy - relies heavily upon sustaining the reader's willing suspension of disbelief.  Even with the factitious mental retardation inculcated by government schooling, I don't see much chance that a reasonably rational child of ten or twelve years' age could ever manage to get past the \\"Sameness\\" bilge (*Induced* absolute color blindness? Gimme a break!) much less the total suppression of human ingenuity and initiative needed to preserve the sociocultural stasis depicted in this novel.<br /><br />To put this in context, consider that the average episode of *Spongebob Squarepants* provides a deeper insight into human nature than does *The Giver*.  Besides that, the Square One lives in a fantasy plenum - Bikini Bottom and all the silliness therein - that's actually better thought-out and more tightly integrated than the community depicted in Ms. Lowry's novel.<br /><br />I understand why the ex-Education majors (the public school teachers) like *The Giver*.  After all, it's been \\"machined\\" to death with all sorts of off-the-shelf study points and similar pap to be regurgitated by the luckless student (which means that the teachers can stick it to their victims with about as much thought and effort as an oyster expends in getting his lunch), and it's not exactly an intellectual challenge.  Education majors, after all, are without doubt the dumbest damned people graduating from college (see cumulative US military Stanford-Binet scores on officer candidates according to undergraduate major subject area; the three lowest-scoring categories every year are education, home economics, and physical education).<br /><br />Beyond that, though, public school teachers are the most thoroughly \\"velvet fascist\\" folks in the country.  Think of them as Mussolini's blackshirts with an ostensibly kinder, gentler face - and a better public relations apparatus.  These clowns secretly *admire* the \\"Sameness\\" in Ms. Lowry's book, and love to drown the kiddies in noise about how wonderful Jonas' community would be if only the governing thugs weren't as much inclined to have people \\"released\\" as is the average Texas politician.<br /><br />Yeah, right.<br /><br />...tenable.

B000089RVX|5.0|This CD is perhaps one of the best someone can get. Of course, there is more to Evanescence than this, but to find them will require you to do some hunting and finding their songs before the explosion that has made them famous. They been constantly producing great music for a very long time before anyone ever heard of them. As for comparison with Nightwish, there is no comparison, although both are built upon the same gene they are two different sides of the coin. Nightwish is Gothick Metal and Evanescence is Gothick Rock. Sure the lines can blur but they both are great and stand on their own in a world of great music. Infact I love both bands, and refuse to choose between them. And if you think that Evanescence and Nightwish is all there is, think again, there is also Inkubus Sukkubus. So if you want to rock and you want it dark, and you have a love for great, powerful music that you can call the classical music of Rock! This is your music path to follow....
B00004XONN|3.0|Radiohead is overrated, period.  People who say things like &quot;well I guess you can't appreciate good music, go listen to something simple&quot; just show how ignorant they are.  I'm sorry but listening to Radiohead does not make you smarter.  Radiohead is more just plain old weird than complex, and although they can make some interesting music it's nothing I would call &quot;genius&quot;, especially on this album.  Go pick up &quot;The Bends&quot; instead.
B00000889Y|5.0|I bought this years ago on Vinyl when i was but a pup.  the album cover and the back cover are in 3D which is nice.  i can't remember if there were any 3D glasses included but i guess that doesn't matter.  my 6 year-old son has recently discovered that if he uses his 3D glasses from Spy Kids 3-D the Off The Bone album cover looks pretty cool too.  the CD has two additional tracks, the last two, which is also nice.  as mentioned in other reviews, there is no 'new' material on this disc but that doesn't keep it from being a classic Cramps disc.  If you can find this on vinyl, you should get it just for the 3D album cover.
B00005Y7L4|5.0|I must clarify what this movie is about, Wilmington, NC's review is completely misleading.<br />A shocking tale set in Japan.  The government has labeled the next generation (students) the reason to degredation in society.  They have greated a BR (Battle Royale) program that places one school class on a deserted island.<br />Class 3B was chosen (9th graders, highschoolers).  Awaking on the island they find metal colars on their necks and their teacher explains that they have been chosen for this year's Battle Royale...<br />The Rules:  They are given weapons and are forced to kill each other.  Only the last one surviving will be able to go home.<BR>Why comply to these rules?  If there isnt a winner in 3 days, the colars on the students necks will explode, and no one goes home.<br />Some students form alliances, others will allow nothing to keep them from the win...<br />The producer meant the movie to be for kids the age of those used in the film (highschool) and older, however to his dissapointment the movie was rated R...
0385504209|1.0|I read all of it because Mr. Brown clearly knows how to tell a suspenseful story. His vocabulary and grammar lead thoughtful readers to conclude that he doesn't write especially well, and some editor might have improved this book's tedious composition. His ill-spun history of early Christianity is ludicrous. If fiction of this sort aspires to be credible in some way beyond the story itself -- and Mr. Brown clearly believes his does -- then we must conclude that this novel is not credible. It's especially galling, in this tale about recovering feminine wisdom, that its principal woman character becomes a cypher for knowledgeable men. Was it beyond the reach of Mr. Brown's imagination for the protagonist to have been a woman? Let's hope that his next book shows more craft, better research and a smidgen of insight into the nature of his own story.

B000056JYB|4.0|Perhaps the first classic-rock supergroup ever.  I can't think of any others before them.  Eric Clapton: John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, The Yardbirds, Cream; Steve Winwood: The Spencer Davis Group, Traffic; Ginger Baker; Cream; Rick Grech: Family.<br />I tend to categorize this album as a blend between Cream & Traffic.  But this doesn't really do it justice.  Winwood's voice & Clapton's guitar on the same album.

6304994540|5.0|One of thoce movie that is just funny in so many ways. Jeff Bridges stars as a dope smoking refugee who gets his carpet urinated on because they were looking for the other Jeff Lebowski who is a millionare. He is friends with John Goodman who is convinced that everything has to do with Vietnam, and Steve Buscemi who can't get a word in because of Goodman. Not to mention John Turturro as Jesus, Julliane Moore as Maude, and Peter Storemare from \\"Fargo\\" as the nihlist. I will even give props to Tara Reid, ( who hasn't made one good movie in her life) as Bunny. The dude is the highlight though, the opening scene where he writes a check for .69 cents, plus the dream sequences, especially \\"Gutterballs\\". There is so many laughs in this flick, The Cohen brothers keep outdoing themselves. The soundtrack is a good one as well.

B000002NG7|4.0|FNM's final album is pretty damn good. On the previous albums, they show off all the different styles of music they can play. This time, they focus a little more writing good songs. &quot;Mouth to Mouth&quot; has a funny circus music theme, &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot; is classy heavy metal, there are two &quot;thrash&quot; songs (one seems to be about a malfuctioning computer), and more.<br />It's too bad the band quit when they were so good. The only FNM album better than this one is ANGEL DUST.

0553288105|4.0|Mankind discovers a method of energy transfer with the aliens of another universe that promises unlimited energy.  Unfortunately, it also promises ultimate destruction.  Only a few scientists are capable of seeing beyond their own self-interest and hubris to recognize this fact, but can they make others believe?  Asimov has constructed an admirable allegory for the environment quandry that we face here on earth, although he fails to show how limitless power would transform our lives.<br />The novel is constructed in three parts.  The first and third sections involve human beings and rely too much on telling and not enough on showing--lots of long, didactic conversations and far too little incident.  The third section is particularly weak; it is dull and bloodless with a take on human sexuality which is supposed to be advanced but, from today's standpoint, seems firmly mired in a seventies mentality. <br />The triumph of this novel is the masterful middle section.  Asimov depicts an alien society that is truly unlike mankind, yet he manages to depict distinct individuals.  This is quite surprising coming from a writer who is known neither for characterization or alien-building.  It's just a shame that the rest of the novel could not maintain this quality and had to end on such a tragically dull note.

B00009P1O0|5.0|On the Beach is one of the two classic albums finally reissued on CD (the other being Gene Clark's No Other, also 1974)- which is a treat for those concerned they might wear out their vinyl original. On the Beach had become one of those legendary albums that you could only locate at record fairs etc- alongside such albums as Pacific Ocean Blue, Star Sailor & Time Fades Away (inexplicably still unavailable, while lesser NY albums like Hawks&Doves get reissued!) The triad of Young albums Time Fades Away (1973), Tonight's the Night (1973, issued 1975), & On the Beach (1974) are frequently labelled 'The Doom Trilogy'- an excellent edition of Uncut magazine in Sep1998 did the definitive feature on them (there was also rumoured to be another lost album, Homegrown- some tracks have surfaced from this on Decade & American Stars'n'Bars). <br />Time Fades Away was pretty bleak stuff- notably on tracks like Yonder Stands the Sinner (\\"I guess you heard about the great pretender/I went to see him and he's not the same\\") & the chilling Last Dance (which makes Joy Division & Nirvana look lightweight!); Tonight's the Night was the real low (\\"old times were good times\\"). On the Beach is a little more transcendetal- Young & co attempting to move beyond the grim years that followed the much publicised deaths surrounding Young (Bruce Berry, Danny Whitten) The album's philosophy is found both in the copious dope reportedly consumed during its recording & Motion Pictures lyric \\"I know I'll get out somehow\\". It's all in the album's cover- Youn surrounded by flotsam, staring out from a beach at the horizon. On the Beach is one of those albums recorded following a chain of bleak events and joins such albums as Bowie's Station to Station, New Order's Power, Corruption & Lies and Screaming Trees'Dust, which are all similarly created. It's also one of the great stoned 70s albums, alongside 461 Ocean Boulevard, Fresh, Greetings from LA, No Other & Todd. <br />A variety of guest musicians surface- Tim Drummond, Ben Keith, what was left of Crazy Horse, Dave Crosby, Graham Nash & The Band's rhythm section, Rick Danko & Levon Helm. The star remains Rusty Kershaw, who offers wonderful fiddle on several tracks. <br />The two least interesting tracks are Motion Pictures (dedicated to Young's then paramour Carrie Snodgress) & Vampire Blues (which is a poor relative of LA- though does tie in with such Californian vampire notions as Buffy the Vampire Slayer, I am Legend and Gram Parson's Sin City. Not to forget Bill Hicks' Arizona Bay- though I think that was from a Warren Zevon song!)- far from terrible, but just average. The rest is suitably classic...<br />See the Sky About to Rain is an older song, from around After the Goldrush- though here the arrangement is suitably sublime- the use of a warm sounding organ & steel guitar shows us just why Young is such an influence on alt-country (bands such as The Jayhawks & Wilco are detectable when listening to this song). Opening track Walk On sounds like a more wary Buffalo Sprinfield- the backing vocals reminiscent of Stills in BS; Young moves onwards \\"some get stoned, some get stranded...\\"<br />For the Turnstiles is a banjo-assisted protest song- though who Young is protesting to is open to suggestion; \\"all the great explorers are now in granite lakes...you can really learn a lot that way/It will change you in the middle of the day/Though your confidience may be shattered/It doesn't matter...in the stands, the whole crowd scatters/For the turnstiles...\\" Young is suitably enigmatic AND sinister (there's a great cover version by Grant Lee Buffalo also) <br />The darkest moment here remains Revolution Blues, which has Young singing about dark extrinsic events- notably Charles Manson and the SLA. The phantasmagoria reminds me of rap songs like Casualties of War and Straight Outta Compton- & also the novel The Day of the Locust. It's very hard to square this song with the same artist who would write the Dubya-simplistic Let's Roll! The title track is equally bleak- existential rockstar blues: \\"the world is turning, hope it don't turn away\\"; though I think The Walkabouts cover on Death Valley Days was a superior take! <br />The best is saved to last- young and Kershaw are Ambulance Blues- a song that isn't the blues and does owe some influence to Bert Jansch's Needle of Death. This is country-folk territory, though more Gates of Eden than Last Trip to Tulsa, the recurring character of Nixon would return (see also Ohio, Campaigner) with the telling line \\"I never knew a man who told so many lies/He had a different story for each set of eyes\\". Odd that Canadian Young wasn'r threatened with a Dixiechicks style fatwa for criticising the US president (& again, odd to square Young's pro-Clear Channel, Reagan & Dubya good/evil sentiments...) As with Revolution Blues, there is a reference to Patty Hearst- presenting us with the notion that On the Beach is part-history lesson, an album that very much tapped into its zeitgeist. The past is of no held (\\"back in the old smokey days\\") and Young notes that to a degree he's complicit with this darkness: \\"all you critics...with your stomach-pumps and your hook&ladder dreams/We could get together for some scenes!\\". Best of all is the darkly comic pay off \\"You're all just pissing in the wind/You might not know this, but you are/And there ain't nothin' like a friend, who can tell you/You're all just pissing in the wind\\"! <br />On the Beach remains one of Young's career highlights and more than warrants investgation at this budget price- I think it's one of his strongest albums alongside Everybody Knows...,Harvest, Time Fades Away, Zuma & Ragged Glory. Young has been a fairly mediocre artist since Rust Never Sleeps- but this album is from his creative peak & also ranks as one of the key albums of the 1970s...
B000003CMB|5.0|Not all live albums necessarily lived up to the original studio recordings for all bands from the late 60's and the 70's. The Allman Bros did a great job of representing their material in a live version - in fact, I wish they could take the original version of Elizabeth Reed, and re-do the first two minutes to match the live intro that Betts and Duane did for Fillmore. Those first two minutes on the live disc are simply the duo at their best on the guitar. I am grateful I had one chance to witness this band at Cobo in Detroit. This is simply an essential album (CD).<BR>Can you imagine how much more music we could have enjoyed if Duane had lived long enough to spend more time with Clapton - and maybe even a moment with Stevie Ray. If you haven't heard Duane's work on Boz Scagg's Loan Me a Dime, seek it out.
B000006TRV|3.0|As with its predecessor, Animals, this album is very much an exercise in what could have been.  Unlike Animals, which had strong music, but a weakly constructed concept, The Wall has one of the strongest concepts in Pink Floyd's catalogue--but some of the weakest music.  Hearing the live rendition of The Wall (Is There Anybody Out There?) makes it even more painfully clear what's missing from the studio album.  Even before I learned the band's history, I always felt a distinct chill in the atmosphere of the album...as though something had been forcibly drained from it.<br />That said, I should note that The Wall as a concept is very coherent.  It was a first, and last, for Pink Floyd (mostly Roger Waters at that point with some input from David Gilmour) to attempt to tell such an intricately narrated story, with a character and plot.  Until The Wall (and also after Mr. Waters' departure), their concept albums had been somewhat more cryptic, interpretive explorations of a central theme.  The Wall leaves very little room for interpretation, relegating the listener to the part of passive spectator if one cannot identify with the experiences of the character, &quot;Pink&quot;.<br />The strengths of The Wall are mainly lyrical and conceptual, although both vocalists are in fine form, and so is the guitar playing.  Personally, I do not have a problem with the songs others might call filler--from my perspective they do serve to advance the narrative.  Another main strength of The Wall is the use of sound effects and TV clips to help create the album's atmosphere, or even to make comments about the lyrics themselves, such as the following example where a clip from Gomer Pyle is placed to make a sarcastic remark: &quot;...when I try to get through on the telephone to you (surprise, surprise, surprise!) there'll be nobody home.&quot;  In light of the studio album's deficiencies, it's a good thing these were there.<br />In Pink Floyd works before The Wall and after The Final Cut, there was often a spooky, unusual, sometimes experimental musical atmosphere that helped to set the tone of the album without a word.  This music could be interpreted however the listener wanted.  I believe a large part of this was the work of keyboardist Richard Wright.  Unfortunately, he was forced by Roger Waters to give up his position in the band.  The Wall's lack of that ethereal grace is what leaves the album cold.  Except for a few beautiful parts like his synth solo on &quot;Run Like Hell&quot;, it's clear Mr. Wright had no more freedom left--and for this the music suffers.<br />Ultimately, I gave The Wall 3 stars.  Although a 3.5 might have been more fair, I felt that the musical lack on the studio album was a significant flaw.  The live album, Is There Anybody Out There?, shows how much better that could have been.
B00009W0WM|4.0|This sensational new double-disc set  reinforces the WWII-era classic with four-plus hours of bonus materials. Some extras are new, others are simply recycled from previous &quot;Casablanca&quot; videos. Most of us won't care.<br />Viewers can kick off their night in &quot;Casablanca&quot; with the Looney Toons spoof &quot;Carrotblanca.&quot; Or they can check out the odd but snappy 1955 TV spin-off, starring tough guy Charles McGraw. Or turn off the TV for the radio adaptation from 1943, with Bogart and Bergman reprising their roles as Rick and Ilsa.<br />The star of the show is, of course, the show. The movie looks amazing at age 61, digitally scrubbed of almost all wear while somehow retaining a fair amount of contrast and original grain. The new transfer builds on the significant restoration work done for the 50th anniversary, returning to the original nitrate elements.<br />The DVD's 2.0 mono is muscular, with crisp and clear dialogue. Max Steiner's versatile music sounds lovely, with plenty of oomph reserved for the dramatic exclamation marks. But keep that remote control close at hand: The DVDs' dynamic range gets to be a bit much, especially during the extras. Volume differences between several bonus features are downright jarring -- sloppy work from the audio people.<br />Roger Ebert's commentary is the loudest track of them of all, appropriate given his enthusiasm level. He's a terrific guy to watch the film with. Who better to provide commentary on the populist masterpiece &quot;Casablanca&quot; than Ebert, the people's film reviewer?<br />Ebert shoots down some of the myths about the film: Ronald Reagan was never seriously considered for the Bogart part; Bergman wasn't completely in the dark about which man her character would choose. Ebert notes the film's cheesy special effects and gaps in logic, saying they don't matter a bit -- and then goes on at length about the absurdity of the fabled &quot;letters of transit.&quot;<br />The feature-length &quot;Bogart&quot; docu is outstanding, offering a wealth of clips from the tough guy's obscure early films. The cast of witnesses is outstanding: John Huston, Richard Brooks, Katharine Hepburn and Bergman all weigh in on their friend's art and legacy.<br />The half-hour &quot;You Must Remember This&quot; is less successful, but still worth watching. Henry Mancini covers the vital role music plays in the film, with popular songs of the day providing sly commentary on the action. &quot;As Time Goes By&quot; was almost cut from the film, but was saved at the last minute.t;Bogart&quot; docu is outstanding, offering a wealth of clips from the tough guy's obscure early films.

B00004SVIK|5.0|When I first purchased Is There Anybody Out There?, I was skeptical that anything could possibly live up to the grandiose vision of The Wall, even another Pink Floyd performance. But within just a few songs, I knew that what I had was not only an excellent performance of The Wall, but something that completely puts the studio album to shame. Since I first bought it in November 2001, I'm not sure if I've even listened to the studio album more than three times. There simply isn't any need, with this masterpiece around.<br />Even though the audio quality probably isn't quite what The Wall is, or perhaps even the best that a live concert recording could be, the quality of the performance itself is absolutely stunning, and even makes up for the loud analogue hiss on &quot;Nobody Home&quot;. One of the biggest problems with the studio album was the fact that Pink Floyd was not working together as a band. Everything succumbed to Roger Waters' dark vision. In fact, the band's keyboardist Richard Wright had been cut out of the proceedings early on, and even forced to relinquish his position as a full member of the band. ITAOT was to be his farewell performance until AMLoR.<br />On ITAOT, although the personal problems were undiminished, it's clear that the band is functioning much more like a *band* than on the studio album, and this makes each rendition spring to life. In spite of all that was happening to him, Mr. Wright works well with a second keyboardist and with the entire band to create moments of stunning beauty. One of the most beautiful, however, was left up to Mr. Wright alone--the new ending of &quot;Goodbye Blue Sky&quot;. As I purchased this album only a few months after 9-11, the song took on a much more personal meaning, and in that ending, Mr. Wright somehow offered through his music both the opportunity to mourn, and a small bit of hope for the future. Even now this part can still bring me to tears.<br />Richard Wright isn't the only one who shines on thisalbum. Nick Mason, after a long time of playing rather simple rhythms on the Floyd's studio albums (WYWH, Animals, The Wall), gets to cut loose in the middle section of &quot;Run Like Hell&quot;, and shows he's definitely still got it. In fact, that entire section seems more like the chaotic part of &quot;A Saucerful of Secrets&quot; than anything. In many ways, ITAOT seems to look back to Pink Floyd's brighter past, including wonderful improvisational elements that had mostly been forced out of the studio by Roger Waters' imposition of structure on the band. <br />The limited edition on particular has extremely beautiful artwork and photographs, and is a nicely put-together book that I think is well worth the money of the serious Floyd fan.<br />This is THE definitive version of The Wall!
B000059HGY|4.0|TORA,TORA,TORA is an entertaining movie for those who are interested in the history of World War II and particularly the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. It is mostly a slow moving film which finally explodes with vivid action scenes featuring excellent special effects. The large cast includes a mixture of American and Japanese actors led by Martin Balsam, Soh Yamamura, Joseph Cotton, Tatsuya Mihashi, E.G. Marshall and Takshiro Tamura.<br />The movie received an Academy Award for Best Special Effects and was nominated for Best Cinematography, Art Direction, Editing and Sound. The main competition for Oscars in 1970 came from PATTON starring George C. Scott.
B000003JA7|5.0|Symphonic rock has come to mean &quot;bombastic, overblown, wanna-be Wagnerian music, complete with flashpots and Spandex.&quot;  With &quot;Thick as a Brick,&quot; Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson created a true symphony; he started out with an opening theme, then worked variations on that theme for over 40 minutes before returning to that theme for the finale.   <br />Most heavy metal music is, in the end, a rewrite of &quot;Ride of the Valkyries.&quot;  Anderson took his cue here not from Wagner and Beethoven (the original masters of the power chord) but from English composers like Ralph Vaughan Williams and Edward Elgar.  Working in snippets from English folk music and jazzy improvisations, he never went for the overblown Big Flourish but kept a properly British Stiff Upper Lip.   (They also retained a distinctively British sense of humor, complete with faux review and lyrics by a &quot;child prodigy&quot;).  <br />Backing him at this time was the strongest Tull lineup: John Evan on keyboards, Martin Barre (one of rock's most underrated axemen) on guitar, Barriemore Barlow on Drums and Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond on bass.   Throughout this release they are playing at top form... which, for them, was singularly impressive.  Jimmy Page may have slagged them as &quot;Jethro Dull&quot; ... but at their heights Tull was one of the most creative and interesting bands on the progressive rock scene.  <br />If you're new to Tull, or to progressive rock, this is a great place to start.  Melodic enough to be accessible, weird enough to be interesting, it manages to be powerful without being pompous.  Unlike much prog rock (ELP, anyone), it also manages to survive into the 21st century without sounding like the aural equivalent of Nehru jackets and airbrushed vans.  Highly recommended.
6300181685|4.0|THE HINDENBURG is a movie which attempts to describe what could have happened on board the famous airship before and during its historic crash in New Jersey in 1937.It is a slow moving film which features an assortment of slightly eccentric characters somewhat in the style of SHIP OF FOOLS. Unfortunately this movie does not measure up to SHIP OF FOOLS although the cast of THE HINDENBURG includes some great actors such as George C. Scott, Anne Bancroft and Burgess Meredith.<br />In spite of its shortcomings THE HINDENBURG did receive an honorary award for visual and sound effects as well as Oscar nominations for Best Cinematography, Art Direction and Sound. The main competition for Academy Awards in 1975 came from ONE FLEW OVER THE CUKOO'S NEST starring Jack Nicholson.
B00000IPAX|5.0|Even though im not a big fan of music, this cd grabs ahold of my intrests whenever its jammin in my boombox.  I've listened to all of thier songs and i loved all the tunes to them.  The best tunes that i have heard from them yet are --All The Small Things--, --Aliens Exist--, and --Going Away To Colege--.  Tom And Mark are the funniest guitarists that i have seen perform in concert.  Some of their videos are cool, but some i just dont like because they have no meaning to them.  For example the video --Whats My Age Again--, they just run around naked.  Which is kind of funny but...  This is defenatley a cd that you should buy.  A recomended band that you should support!!
6304286961|4.0|I found this a great film both passionate and disturbing; true there are a few slow scenes but Stone certainly gives an accurate reflection of this era, possibly better still if you lived through it and were approximately Morrison's age,as I was.<BR>In this respect the film is at least as good as \\"Natural Born Killers\\"--and in places equally outrageous.  I can't believe Roger Ebert gave it only 2 1/2 stars. Surely 3 1/2 is more like it.  What makes it especially compelling is the music itself; I was never a big Doors fan, even though I lived in the era when I very well might have been...but now I am.  Morrison's songs are  I now believe the equal of The Band's or Dylan's, and they are if anything more passionate. Also significant is that fact that Morrison's life was a study in increasing excess; i.e. his personal demons, not to mention his hair, grew ever more intense until his death. In this respect, he resembles many artists, including the Beatles, Janis Joplin, The Rolling Stones, Steve Earle, to name a few. Stone plays up the passion, the sex, and the drugs.
B00004Z459|5.0|Hybrid is an album for sure worth buying. It has all the classics and really shows the band's best side. I would recommend it to anyone who likes any kind of music. There are no explicit lyrics so its ok for kids. its also hard enough that when you listen to it, you don't feel like a baby. Hybrid Theory and Meteora is what i would recomend. Since you'll love them, go ahead and pick up Reanimation while your here. You will love Hybrid Theory!!!
B00007KWI9|4.0|Yes's debut album was great. Not as good as say &quot;the Yes album&quot; or fragile. This cd did not include Steve Howe. But, nonetheless a good cd. Classic yes.
B00006LJ79|5.0|I am very pleased with the entire cd! The songs are infectious. They remind me so much of ABBA. However, Tatu's songs are so much more in tune with life and love!
B000002JSZ|5.0|I loved this cd when I was younger. I hadn't heard in years. You hardly hear anything from this cd, just overplayed black 'n black. Great cd.
0385484518|5.0|Life is much more than the daily 9-5 or the more simplistic issues that typically crowd our day. This book will cause any reader to stop dead in their tracks and begin to consider the larger picture of life on topics ranging from regrets to death. A quick read but filled with deep thoughts.
0783226128|5.0|Great movie, but very violent. Classic pacino.
0062502182|4.0|I read several other customer reviews that stated this book was solely for children. I highly disagree. There are multiple levels to this book, as it is filled with much symbolism and many metaphors. One does not need to be a literary scholar to unmask them either. Whether or not that is of interest to you, Coelho is a masterful story teller and this tale of adventure and personal discovery will keep you engaged.
B000008COG|3.0|OK buy for a die-hard Ac/dc fan. But, I think the cd is highly synthisized and over produced.
6305350205|3.0|Star Trek V is commonly considered the worst of the star trek movies and alot in it is bad but it is watchable. This movie needed a much larger budget than it was given and a lot of William Shatner's original story was changed, mostly for the worst. If the movie had been given a adequate budget, Shatner would have gotten to film more scenes and afford better special effects. This would improve Star Trek V dramatically and if the storyline hadn't been changed this film would probably deserve a 4 1/2 or even 5 star rating.
0783226128|5.0|Great movie, but very violent. Classic pacino.
B00008S2VG|5.0|&quot;American Life&quot; Is one of those albums which you have to get used to. I listened to it all the time when I first heard it but kind of got bored of it. Then recently i played it all the way though and was able to listen to it without skipping a track.  In keeping with the same techno/electronica theme of &quot;Music&quot; and &quot;Ray of Light&quot; Madonna gives us some of her most personal lyrics to date. The title track is a great song with her kind of &quot;rapping&quot; which  is really cool.  My favorite track is &quot;nothign fails&quot;... one of Madonna's BEST songs. She talks about her life on this album. &quot;Mother And Father&quot; is so sad it almost makes you cry and &quot;I'm So Stupid&quot; shows how she did some things in her life she regretted. The song &quot;Hollywood' has a chilling warning to people ready to be stars. Overall if you're a Madonna fan GET THIS ALBUM. You will not regret it. Do not be fooled by the 'Explicit Lyrics' on the cover. I think thats why a lot of people were turned off by it. The only song with 'Explicit Lyrics' was really the title track &quot;American Life.&quot;  Another highlight is the hit single (why werent any of the others hits?!?!) &quot;Die Another Day&quot; which has great instrumentation. Also reccomended: &quot;Music&quot; and &quot;Ray of Light.&quot;
B000001E21|4.0|Despite bad reviews, I like this cd. I like it better than adrenalize for sure. One of my favs. is there cover of &quot;Action&quot; the sweet classic.
B00005JMD3|4.0|This movie was really good i thought. i was hoping to see better but i like it. None stop action and no romantic scenes either they can ruin movies or save them but swat was good i would say go see it and when it comes out on DVD im gonna get it
B0000A1RJI|1.0|This Fantastic movie doesnt deserve this SCORE tapestry...<BR>I Think Badelt and also Hans Zimmer should be made to walk the plank of the Black Pearl.<BR>This is a great guide of &quot;how to destroy a movie with the score..<BR>If you wanna hear a great Pirates'score LISTEN &quot;The Cutthroat Island&quot; Composed by John Debney.
B000008B01|5.0|I agree with the reviewer who stated that this music can not be referred to in the traditional 'bossa/samba' mode; although, both are present in Joao's playing here. &quot;Eu Quero Um Samba&quot; is, in my opinion, one of the finest examples of Joao playing his 'voz' straight off of the 'violao' and obtaining a groove that goes beyond voice, guitar, and lyric. It is that &quot;spot&quot; to which Jobim alluded that is reached then. &quot;Aguas de Marco&quot; is Joao's own masterful version of Jobim's masterpiece. Miles Davis once said that Joao would sound good reading the newspaper. This is a compliment to one of the great romantic vocalists of our time from arguably the same on trumpet. Interestingly, for a comparison of some of these same tunes, many of the same songs are on the &quot;Best of Both Worlds&quot; recording with Stan Getz, which was released in 1976, and features Chico Buarque's sister - Heloisa - on English vocals. I have to admit to liking &quot;Izaura&quot; much better on the CD I am now reviewing: Joao changes the harmony on the bridge here and the effect is electric. On the &quot;Both Worlds&quot; recording, Getz was either improperly recorded or having a tough time, since &quot;the Sound&quot; just is not there. That said, he does grab a hold of some great licks - especially on &quot;Falsa Bahiana&quot;. No, I will not review that here, but it makes me wonder if perhaps Joao was not quite satisfied with the 1976 effort...seeing that many of the tunes are re-done, and done better, frankly, on this recording.
B00005JKN9|1.0|This movie is set in the 19th century at Five Points, a New York neighborhood where the battles between the Irish and Italians in New York took place.  The film is supposed to show the bitter fight to the finish between the Catholic and Protestant groups, with the corrupt politicians waiting in the shadows.  Unfortunately, it fails to capture the tension between the groups despite all the blood and gore it shows.<br />We are introduced to Jenny Everdeane (Cameron Diaz), a pickpocket, and Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio), the son of slain Irish leader Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson).  Amsterdam, whose friends call him \\"Dam\\" for short, has just been released from an orphanage and has come back to Five Points to find and kill Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis) because Bill is the man who killed his father, Priest Vallon. Priest Vallon represented the Irish immigrants in New York while Bill represented the Nativists. Bill was interested in keeping the Irish hordes out of America while Priest wanted the Irish hordes in America. They fought and Priest lost, though the hordes kept coming.<br />Sounds like a good story with a lot of interesting true-to-history details, doesn't it?  But...it isn't.  In addition to no tension, the characters lack depth and the story just goes on and on and on and....<br />The history of this period of time isn't captured very well either.  It's hard to believe a movie this long lacks the historical details it should have....but it does.<br />Don't bother with this film.  It's a shame that it was as bad as it was, considering Scorsese's emotional attachment to it and all the time that went into getting it to the big screen, but it is a stinker!
B00009RDGA|4.0|The early successes of director Peter Bogdanovich -- which began with TARGETS in 1968, followed by his masterpiece THE LAST PICTURE SHOW in '71 and WHAT'S UP DOC the next year -- ended in 1973 with an evocative and endearing comedy-drama called PAPER MOON.  Shot in rather stark black-and-white photography in real locations, and taking place mostly in sleepy locales and barren landscapes of the 30s, PAPER MOON seems to echo the memorably desolate world Bogdanovich had created in THE LAST PICTURE SHOW.  But rather than a depressing look of American life, PAPER MOON is a light-hearted adventure about a con man and a tomboyish orphan girl partnering together to pull one small-time scam after another, with the girl often saving the day.  The small cast of actors all give memorable performances.  But the film will be most remembered for the work by then eight-year-old newcomer Tatum O'Neal as the orphan, who is on the screen nearly constantly and basically carries the whole film.  She imbues every scene with the right emotions, convictions, world-weariness, precociousness, and understated pathos and comedy.  It is a thoroughly convincing portrayal of a character that probably should have been played by a slightly older actress (in the original novel, it is a 12-year-old) to be believable.  But looking at it today, it is an irreplaceable performance.<br />The Region-1-only DVD version offers a good-looking widescreen anamorphic transfer, with the high-contrast black-and-white photography presented very well, with only a few graininess here and there to mar its quality.  The mono audio sounds reasonably good.  Bonus features include three short featurettes, running about half hour total, that include present-day reminiscences from Bogdanovich, co-producer Frank Marhsall, production designer Polly Platt, as well as all-too-brief comments from cinematographer Laszlos Kovacs.  They recount production history, casting choices, and on-the-set experiences.  It's a shame that noneof the actors appear.  A few outtakes are also shown.  And Bogdanovich recalls a few amusing anecdotes.<br />Bogdanovich also offers an audio commentary for this DVD.  It is a mostly scene-specific commentary in which he elaborates on his intentions, the challenges, and the experiences in most aspects of the shooting.  He had to shoot a long confrontation scene between Mose and Addie in over 20 takes.  And 47 camera setups were needed to shoot a seemingly ordinary but pivotal one-room scene.  He praises the acting and the photography, and explains why he liked to shoot in long takes and in deep-focus black-and-white.  He makes references to THE GRAPES OF WRATH a couple of times while commenting on the mostly barren landscapes of the movie.  He admits he didn't use storyboards, which is hard to believe considering the impeccable compositions in many of the shots.  Also astonishing is that the film's wonderful ending did not come to him until almost at the end of the shooting.<br />One of the movie's charms comes from watching the various scams being carried out by the two characters.  And to the credits of the filmmakers, their tricks are not fully explained as to how they actually work, so the viewer has to be observant.  Below is a description of the short-changing scam that occurs twice in the movie.  I admittedly didn't understand it until after several viewings:<br />The con artist goes into a store to buy something under a dollar.  At the register, he pays with a $5 bill.  The store clerk takes the $5 and gives him the change.  Then comes following exchange.<br />The con artist says, \\"I have too many singles in my wallet.  Let me give you five $1 bills and you give me a $5 bill.\\"<br />The clerk gives him a $5 bill and takes the five ones.  So far so good.<br />While the clerk still has the five ones in his hand, the con artist says, \\"I still have too many bills in my wallet.  Let me give you back the $5 bill, together with the five ones in your hand.  And in exchange, you give me a $10 bill.\\"<br />The clerk unwittingly hands him a $10 bill -- not knowing that he only owes $5, not $10, at that point.
B000003CMD|4.0|Brothers And Sisters was the last of five consecutive strong albums released from the Allman Brothers Band. This was also the first studio album released after the untimely deaths of bassist Berry Oakley and guitarist Duane Allman. This would be the band's biggest success giving them their only #1 album and their highest charing single, \\"Ramblin' Man\\", which peaked at #2. However, this is the first album that they recorded that wasn't killer from beginning to end, even though it has its share of classic tracks.<br /><br />With the death of Allman, Dickey Betts took on a much larger role in the band. His country influences are very prevalent here in both \\"Ramblin' Man\\" and the closing track \\"Pony Boy\\", which features his excellent slide work. He also contributes perhaps his most well known instrumental \\"Jessica\\", which is the strongest track here. Chuck Leavell's piano solo and Betts' guitar solo during this track still sound amazing today. Other strong tracks here include Gregg Allman's \\"Wasted Words\\" and Betts' \\"Southbound\\", both which feature outstanding playing by Leavell. The other two tracks written by Allman, \\"Come And Go Blues\\" and \\"Jelly Jelly\\" are decent but not up to their usual high standard. Allman's vocals on this album also sound weaker than on their previous albums. Not their best album, but it was the best they would release again until Seven Turns in 1990.
B00005B4GU|3.0|Over the years, Radiohead have released top-notch albums, that can be said. Amnesiac, however, isn't as impressive as I'd like it to be. I know I'll get a lot of [complaints] from their fans, although Radiohead is one of my favorite bands. I like The Bends, OK Computer, Kid A, and the new one, Hail To The Thief, don't own and haven't heard Pablo Honey, and though I like this, some of it I can't get into no matter how hard I try. Maybe because it is sort of Kid A rejects, and I respect their ideas, even though it only works on some of the tracks. There are 4 songs that I think are good. Yeah, that's all.<br />The only one I completely hate on here is \\"Morning Bell/Amnesiac\\". It was excellent on Kid A, but this version is just discombobulated.<br />As for the good, the good tracks are very good. \\"Pyramid Song\\" is an awesome chill song, and has one of Thom's best melodies. The song is haunting at times, and as every single other Radiohead video, the video is great.<BR>\\"You And Whose Army\\" is the obvious standout track here. It rivals out even some of their best work. It shows that they are one of the most important artists of the Britpop generation. It would've been good enough to appear on OK Computer.<BR>\\"I Might Be Wrong\\" is just awesome. It's catchy and avant-garde simultaneously. Thom's falsetto works great on this one. Funky guitars, sort of bluesy tune.<BR>\\"Knives Out\\" is really cool too. I love the guitars, and it does make a great single. Even people who detest this album can enjoy this.<br />As for the rest, it ranges from tolerable to annoying. It opens up with \\"Packt Like Sardines In A Crushed Tin Box\\", which has sort of techno-ish beats of Kid A, nothing special, but it's alright. Kind of repetitive and whiny, but it's nothing that would turn you off.<BR>\\"Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors\\" starts out with an awesome techno beat, but after awhile it gets real self-indulgent and you realize it's just nonsense about kinds of doors.<BR>\\"Dollars & Cents\\" is a song thatI am kind of indifferent to. It's a little hard for me to sit throught this whole song, but it's not bad.<BR>\\"Hunting Bears\\" is a song I have no opinion on as well. I do think it's cool how it's the polar opposite of \\"Treefingers\\" from Kid A. Somewhat reminds me of \\"I Might Be Wrong\\". Very short.<BR>The last track is a little interesting even though it does nothing for me. It's kind of a New Orleans jazz type song, that is actually unique. The song's kind of blary for my tastes, and seems like it tries to be something else, so I really can't get into it a whole lot, though I still continue to try.<br />It's worth it, but if you're not a fan of Radiohead, I wouldn't recommend you buy it. It's not tuneless or anything, but you may find it whiny, self-indulgent, and pretentious if you start here. It's very overrated, that's for sure, and the band's always been a little. \\"I Might Be Wrong\\", but it's Radiohead's weakest album to me.
B000002B35|4.0|It's quite simple.  This may be a great-sounding album; many talented artists have covered Pink Floyd's brilliant compositions.  Any band without Roger Waters is NOT Pink Floyd.
B000050IE6|5.0|Universally loved by critics and Opeth fans alike, Still Life is a haunting work, and one that will stand the test of time in the annals of death/prog/rock history. Again, Mikael Akerfeldt takes us on a journey of musical discovery. You, gentle listener, will enjoy and be mesmerized by every minute of it. Opeth has long been a band that defies description and as in my previous reviews, I will not attempt to praise them, only to say that they must be heard to be believed. From the thundering opening track &quot;The Moor,&quot; be prepared for an aural assault unlike any other. Delving to deep emotional lows has never seemed a problem for Akerfeldt and crew, and on Still Life they seem to relish the idea of revisting those places of pain and sorrow. &quot;Godheads Lament&quot; is astounding. &quot;Benighted&quot; is the small respite, a second to rest before being assailed by the earthquate of sonic vibration that is &quot;Moonlapse Vertigo.&quot; &quot;Face of Melinda&quot; takes a second to let you come back down and think before being floored by the juggernauts &quot;Serenity Painted Death,&quot; and the phenomenal &quot;White Cluster,&quot; the albums closing track. Opeth fans have long held the idea that this band may be the finest to ever grace the death metal scene. One listen to Still Life may affirm that for those of you still on the fence.
B00005YW4H|1.0|The only way to appreciate how talented this lady is, is to hear her sing/play at random on a compilation disk of other female vocalists like I first did.<br />I had never heard/seen of this pretty face as I listened to my February 2002 Jazziz compilation disk.... while at work no less [not being very attentive to the tunes].  Yet, she stuck out of the crowd like the proverbial &quot;breath of fresh air&quot;.  So struck, I ventured to download what music I could from the various shareware sites.  Holy smokes, there was tons of her stuff out there.  She had been discovered... she had fans....  and she was gorgeous.<br />Some time later, I got her disk on the cheap from Half.com and MP3'd it into my database of some 20,000 songs.  I always listen at random, but she has come up several times and I enjoy her every time.<br />But, when I put her CD in my car disk player... yawn...  sleep... yawn... and more sleep....<br />It's impossible to enjoy her unless played at random with other artists....<br />She is so totally natually talented... she probably didn't show us but a tiny slice of her capability....<br />So 11 stars for the artist......  0 stars for her CD pesentation....<br />I think you catch my drift....<br />She needs to get on stage with Bonnie Raitt and learn how to raise the roof...<br />I say Bonnie becuase she is most reminiscent of her....  yet Bonnie's first CD [Give it Up, 1972) is a treasure....  maybe one of THE best records ever recorded.  Becuase it's Magic, Spellbinding...  uplifting...  provocative.... etc etc.... timeless........<br />If I could marry a star I'd choose Bonnie... I would never be bored...  I have never forgotten my first listen to that album....<br />Norah's record is the total opposite of that Bonnie rush...<br />oh well... Norah's pretty...
B00006IU73|5.0|There is not a lot that can be said about In Absentia that has not already been touched on in previous reviews. This is a fantastic album, one that deserves a spot in any music fans collection. There is no doubt that Steven Wilson is a master at the top of his game. His work with Opeth has been heralded but I cannot help but feel that he still does not get the credit he so rightfully deserves. Mr. Wilson is an amazing songwriter and his producing skills are unmatched. In Absentia is the most painstakingly mixed album that I have ever heard, and that attention to detail only increases the brilliance of the music. If you are a fan of progressive rock you MUST add this to your collection. From the driving opener &quot;Blackest Eyes&quot; to the haunting, string-saturated closer &quot;Collapse the Light Into Earth,&quot; In Absentia is a work of pure sonic bliss. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.<br />Standout Tracks:<br />Every song on the disk
0316666343|3.0|I was so excited to read this book after all the good things I had heard about it. And I wasn't disappointed with Sebold's great story idea or her very real and likable Susie Salmon. I could even deal with the rather unconventional and seemingly God-less view of heaven - one view is as good as another. But the last bit of the book ruined it for me. I felt it cheapened the whole idea of humanity and presents a warped view of maturity and ultimate peace/happiness. I should have stopped reading sooner and I'd have been able to really give the book a glowing recommendation to my friends.
0789723107|5.0|When I first looked through this book, I was disappointed at how small it was considering how much I paid for it. However, single sentences in this book are often more valuable than entire chapters in other books on the subject.<br />It basically picks up where Nielsen's \\"Designing Web Usability\\" left off. Unlike Nielsen, however, Krug doesn't feel the need to reinforce his points 10 times in the space of two pages, nor does he offer pompous predictions on the future of the Web. This is solid, useful advice from a guy whose ego doesn't require a photo on the book jacket.<br />This book is great, regardless of your experience level. For folks new to the Web, I recommend reading Nielsen and Krug back-to-back - you could finish both books in a single day and walk away with a wealth of useful information.
0345350499|5.0|Even though the legend of King Arthur has always been fascinating to most people, I was never too hot about it.<BR>Most books on Camelot are written in a boring, uninspired and in every way unappealing manner.<BR>However, Marion Zimmer Bradley's classic is completely different. First of all, the magical and fairytale themes that some might expect do not exist here. They are explained in a more historical way, and the author distinguishes magic from religion.<BR>The main character is Morgaine, priestess of Avalon and sister of Arthur. She is an intriguing, dynamic character and this is one of the elements that make the book so good: all of the characters are so interesting and real that one simply cannot help feeling excited about all the things that happen to them. The history of Camelot unfolds before the reader, exciting and full of twists and the writer makes it all extremely appealing.<BR>The events that happen are always breathtaking, while there are some funny moments, some touching ones and some very dark and scary.<BR>The game of power played by the characters starts becoming messy, alienating people from each other.<BR>Bradley's magic lies in her supreme cast of characters: Each and every one, even the dark, destructive ones, have many aspects, they are full of both faults and virtues, and we see the reasons behind each one's course of action. <BR>The book might seem a little large at first, but it's a real page-turner, every bit being worthwhile, and Marion Zimmer Bradley writes beautifully!<BR>I would simply like to add that despite certain supernatural elements, it is not a book for children under the age of 13, or a fairytale.
B00005K3NR|5.0|Let's face it - puberty is scary.  Your body changes, your emotions run high, and you're scared you won't fit in.  That's the real beauty of CARRIE.  Underneath the telekenisis is a tale that could apply to anyone.  Stephen King knows how to find terror in the mundane, and Brian DePalma knows how to make it look incredible.  Combine this with great acting, good special effects, and a psycho on acid score!  The DVD has two featurettes that run about as long as the actual movie.  In an interesting move rather than doing a commentary they give you a wonderful look inside the movie where you get to see the cast now talking about the film.  Very very well done!  A timeless classic!  Superior to any re-makes or sequels.  Probably the best Stephen King film adaptation ever.  Even if the tv version is more literal this one is just stylish and well done.
0060090367|3.0|This was an okay read.  I like her other books better.  I also liked Good in Bed better for a similar type of book.
B0000A4GAK|4.0|Blender magazine = 1 star.  Rolling Stone = 2 stars.  Don't always believe what you read.This is another fine album from Derek Trucks and band.It has more of an &quot;easy&quot; jazz feel due to the inclusion of flute on just about all the tracks.Don't let that scare you, this cd still rocks.Starts off with the Duane Allman fave Soul Serenade (wish it was longer)and quickly fades to Bob Marley's Rastaman Chant.Gregg Allman makes an appearance on an excellent Drown In My Own Tears.The rest is all jazzy instrumentals featuring flute and Allman Bros. style guitar.Somehow it all works.Don't believe what you read just believe what you hear.
0345440900|2.0|In theory the ideas in this book sound great.  Unfortunately they don't actually work out the way that you expect them to.  After trying some of her examples and suggestions I can't help but wonder if she made them up for the book and didn't test them out first.  <BR>One idea of hers is that you not let your baby fall asleep while nursing.  Anyone who has a baby that usually falls asleep while nursing knows that it is virtually impossible to nurse them without them falling asleep.<BR>Another problem is that she doesn't address what to do if your baby doesn't fall asleep at nap time while your trying to get them into her suggested routine.  After 5 days with my baby not getting her naps in, and her having a much harder time falling asleep at night because of the missed naps, I finally decided to chunk her routine concept and her book.  We are all sleeping better now!<BR>This book may work better for newborns, but I do not recommend it for babies that are a little older (mine was about 5 months).
B00005JLSE|5.0|At last, it's good to see a movie that really deserves an Academy Award.  This wonderful production combines the talents of a myriad of fantastic performers.  Veteran actors sing and dance as if they've been doing it all their lives and slick and creative musical numbers follow one another at a dizzying pace.  <BR>Renee Zellweger stars as a young girl desperate to be in show business.  She has an affair with a man who claims that he can help her career, but when he reveals that it's all a lie, she shoots him.  She ends up in jail with one of her idols, played by Catherine Zeta-Jones, but Jones won't give her the time of day.  They are both accused of murder and they both use a slick-talking lawyer played to perfection by Richard Gere.  He manipulates the press by presenting Zellweger as a victim of the crime she committed and suddenly she has the fame she so greatly desires.  Now it's Zeta-Jones who comes to her and wants them to perform together, but Zellweger spurns her as earlier she has been rejected.  Each major character gets to shine in at least one solo number and both Queen Latifah and John C. Quinn deliver a show-stopping performance in &quot;Be Good to Momma&quot; and &quot;Cellophane Man&quot;, respectively.  This is a highly entertaining film, and it contains some themes which are brilliantly satirized.  The power of the press and the unfairness of the legal system are brutally spotlighted and one can only assume at the end of this film that being bad is good.  This is a wonderful film and is highly recommended.
B000063CPL|5.0|This very well may be the best live Iron Maiden album. The contrast between their newer songs (\\"The Wicker Man,\\" \\"Sign of the Cross,\\" \\"The Clansman,\\" etc.) and their older songs \\"2 Minutes to Midnight,\\" \\"Wrathchild,\\" \\"Hallowed Be Thy Name,\\") is beautiful. The tracklist leaves nothing to be desired, and is all I could have asked for. The performance is incredible. I consider the current lineup of Maiden to be the best they have ever had (Dickinson, Harris, Murray, Smith, Gers, McBrain). The three-guitar attack is brutal!! This album proves that Iron Maiden has successfully updated their sound for the new century, without losing the spirit that made them so good 20 years ago. The production is possibly the heaviest on ANY Maiden album, live or studio. It is an assault on your ears!! I think the best song on here is \\"The Clansman.\\" I say this because the studio version was just plain boring, but somehow with this new lineup of musicians playing in front of a crowd, the song is mind-blowing!! (They played this when I saw them at Madison Square Garden... the part where he shouts \\"Freedom!!!\\" is the greatest thing I have ever experienced.) This album does exactly what a live album should do, and that is make you feel like you're there. Between the great performances and the clear, flawless production, this truly is one of Iron Maiden's greatest releases.<br />It is great to hear the old songs done with the \\"updated\\" band, and it is simply awesome to hear the new ones as well. The 6 songs from the album Brave New World are far superior to their studio versions, I think this is undeniable. In fact, I never really cared for Brave New World that much, but now I love these songs! Possibly the most surprising thing about Rock In Rio is this: Bruce hits the high note in the chorus of \\"Run to the Hills\\"!!!!! He has never before done this on a live album, not even on Live After Death! The only other time I've heard him do it is on the studio version. Is his voice actually IMPROVING as he gets older?? Also, he seems more inspired than ever, putting more into his voice than he ever has. He displays a greater range of tonalities and textures than he did 20 years ago! The only problem I have with this album is that Janick Gers stole Adrian Smith's guitar solo on \\"Hallowed Be Thy Name.\\" Not that Gers is a bad guitarist, but I wanted to hear Adrian do it!! This, however, is a minor flaw, and does not ruin the fact that this is probably the best live Iron Maiden album.
B00008LDPU|5.0|I love the Matrix stroryline and Animatrix helps flesh it out a little more. Plus the anime on this DVD is just amazing. You get a CG scene and 6 other short clips that feature different anime styles by legendary directors. A definite must-bye if your a fan of either.
B00005JLRT|1.0|An incoherent plot, a vague theme, shallow characterization, laughable action cliches, an utter lack of Star Trek conventions or congruity with past Star Trek films, and even plagiarism from Star Wars (e.g., the ship hallway gunfight) and the Lord of the Rings (e.g., the self-impalement at the end and the music) cannot be forgiven. Much of this nonsense is explained by the director when, in the special features, he admits to never having seen the Star Trek T.V. series or films; the undue focus on Data at the expense of all of the other characters, meanwhile, can be explained by Brent Spiner's position as script writer. This installment is among the worst of the STNG movies. And if this is in fact the last with the Next Generation crew, it is an even greater disappointment. Don't waste your money on this DVD; save your money for one of the complete seasons of the STNG television series, when STNG was still STNG--original, noble, intelligent, thrilling, and delightful.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This movie can be described in one word: ecclectic.  It goes from rehashed Whitney Houston songs to a revamped version of Madonna's &quot;Like A Virgin,&quot; this time sung my two slightly insane old men and a few of their mildly unusual servents.  But this also adds to the creativity and uniqueness of the movie, earning it a well-deserved Best Picture nomination.  The colors and art direction were spectacular and the acting was grand.  And the giant elephant was pretty awesome, as well.  This movie makes you laugh and it makes you cry.  But apparantly, it made a lot of people vomit it horror.  Yes, this movie is one of those &quot;either you love it or you hate it&quot; movies.  I, myself, love period films, as well as strange, quirky ones.  This movie was a mix of the two.  Therefore, I loved it.  And if you don't like either of those two qualities, I suggest you stop reading now.<br />The synopsis is as follows: A young man, Christian (Ewan McGregor) moves to Paris, France to write a novel about love.  He finds himself trapped in an awkward situation with a group of musical-writing Bohemians.  From there they go to a night club known as the Moulin Rouge where Tolouse Letrec (?) tells Christian he is to meet the cortisan in her giant Elephant Room in the courtyard, and &quot;totawy awone.&quot;  There the cortizan, Satine (Nicole Kidman), mistakes him for a powerful man known as the Duke and this leads to many mixups, followed by a deal to turn the Moulin Rouge into a theater.  Among all of this is a love conflict that is somewhat unique.<br />You see, this unusual movie also has a slightly original, but also quite unoriginal, love story.  Thank goodness Nicole Kidman plays Satine.  She is poised and has a lovely voice.  This was her breakaway role in which she proved herself as a true actress.  For this film she was nominated, and in 2002 won an Oscar for Best Actress for her role as Virginia Woolf in The Hours.  She is now playing Ada in the movie &quot;Cold Mountain,&quot; which is believed to be one of the big winners during this year's Oscars.  This movie marked the beginning of her well-deserved true acting career.  May she last forever.<br />Bottom Line: Despite the often eccentric musical numbers, this movie will dance and sing in history forever as the brave and august film that it is and was meant to be.  (I gave it an A and it is number 8 on my Top Ten Favorite Movies List)
B00005JL7Q|4.0|This film at first did not pull me in.  It did not seem like a movie I would like.  I am more of a period film, \\"Elizabeth\\"-type movie lover.  But I was surprised.  During the summer, I made a top ten favorite movie list and this definately defeated Pirates of the Carribean.  It was Hugh Grant's finest film to date and the movie that made Toni Collette shine.  Welcome to About A Boy.<br />This movie focuses on Will, a self-centered, self-proclaimed \\"island\\" man, meaning he is seperate from the world.  This reason being that he inherits immense amounts of money every time a famous Christmas song, written by his dead father, is sang on television, a movie, etc.  This allows him to be by far the most lazy man in the movies.  He is also quite rude.  It also focuses on a little boy named Marcus with a depressed mother.  And when Will starts to seek single mothers, he and Marcus meet when he goes on a date with a single mother from the group SPAT (Single Parents Alone Together).  He is the son of Toni Collette's character Fiona, who could not go to the gathering and let Marcus go with Will's date.  Soon, when Marcus has some bad experiences at school and at home, they connect and help eachother out in tough situations.<br />This movie is heart warming and quite funny.  A peticular moment made me laugh excessively when Will was going to his first SPAT meeting.  The women are telling stories about their husbands that have abandoned them.  He narrarates the moment with the quote, \\"I can tell you one thing: Men are b**tards.\\"  The only criticism I would have is the movie's length.  But all in all, it was a great film that I thought deserved a Best Actor nomination for Hugh Grant.  I give this movie four stars and an A-. (Number 10 on my Top Ten Favorite Movies list)
B00005JMCR|2.0|American Wedding (2003) Jason Biggs, Seann William Scott, Alyson Hannigan, Eddie Kaye Thomas, Thomas Ian Nicholas, January Jones, Eugene Levy, Molly Cheek, Deborah Rush, Fred Willard, D: Jesse Dylan. <br />After a three-year relationship, Jim proposes to band-geek girlfriend Michelle, which means bringing members of the gang to help him tie the knot (excluding the leading ladies), a lot more embarrassing mishaps, and a bachelor party for the obnoxious, one-track-minded Stifler. <br />Third helping of PIE makes room for more sexism and tastelessness, which can't cure its phase for showing its age mark. The heart is left out here from the film digging so low for more funny stuff, but all we get is the cake topped on with pubic shavings and some masticated doggie poo! If you prefer potty humor like so, here's a pie in the face! Directors of the first, Paul and Chris Weitz are co-producers. <br />Running Time: 96 minutes and rated R for sexual content, language, and crude humor.
B00000294R|5.0|Big L is one of the best MC's of all time, up there with Biggie and Pac. His lyrical content is overwhelming throughout this debut cd, though the beats arent really there... the usage of words is crazy. My favortie tracks are Put It On, MVP, and Da Graveyard. No doubt Big L had skillz. R.I.P. Big L
B00009W0WM|1.0|One of the greatest movies ever made and no one wants to release it in wide-screen format.  Movies like Casablanca &amp; Citizen Kane changed how most movies, even today, are filmed.  Why would anyone want to watch it stretched out to the point where details &amp; background get lost?  I get dizzy watching the camera swing back and forth to the speaking characters.  While the special features are pretty good, I didn't buy this for a documentary &amp; WB cartoon.  I bought for the film.  It is time this film was given the proper respect it deserves.  If it can be shown on Cable in wide-screen then I should be able to get the Special Edition DVD in wide-screen.
B00005JM09|1.0|Alright, the special effects were amazing in this. However, they really, REALLY ruined the series. Terminator 1 and 2 were both incredible movies. James Cameron did an excellent job with both of them. Yet, he hands it down... and what happens? It gets \\"terminated\\". Why did they try and put a bunch of \\"funny\\" parts in this? That is completely idiotic, and really delivers a blow to the quality of the entire plot. In the first one there were NO comical scenes, and in the second... maybe one or two, but they were extremely subtle and would not make you laugh out loud. There were too many \\"funny\\" parts in the 3rd one, and they weren't even funny at that!<BR>This joke they call the \\"Terminatrix\\" - give me a break; a supermodel? Arnold should be fighting real villains, not some broad on her rusty period. Schwarzenegger looks way too old in the face. The directing was just terrible in this. As much as Arnold is in the movie... somehow he just doesn't seem to be the lead star. More like John Connor's future wife [I forget her character's name]. The guy who played John Connor is a total nerd, and a bad actor to say the least. When they show that scene from the future where his character is an old man, where he's standing up shouting and everybody is cheering after they defeat the terminators or whatever happens, his makeup is so immensely fake looking it's hysterical. He looks exactly like himself, with grey hair and pudding splattered on his face. Corny, way too corny... astonishingly retarded at BEST. This movie was obviously made for the sole purpose of making money from gullible people. Sadly, I was one of them.<BR>Even near the beginning when John Connor has that dream about the Terminators in the future or whatever it is... they look different than the old terminators [meaning they look STUPID in comparison]. I could've sworn that they destroyed any possible chance for somebody to carry on Dyson's work in the second installment of the trilogy... yet somehow Skynet is still built, and all these plotholes seem to fill up with BS explanations that really offer no proof of a genuinely constructed storyline. <br />As I said, the special effects are very nice - but I certainly hope to Christ that they don't try and make another... who would play John Connor this time... the kid who played Doogie Howser? ...or maybe Johnathan Taylor Thomas? Pathetic, absolutely pathetic. This movie is horrible... spare yourself from being absolutely appaled by this piece of junk and watch something else.
0385504209|1.0|If you enjoy reading books on the occult, mysticism, astrology and abhor Christianity and Catholicism you will like this novel. Brown starts out with a pretty good mystery and then transforms it into the absurd. Christ fathered a child? The Bible and thousands of written records are totally irrelevant when Brown cites &quot;authoratative sources&quot;. My biggest regrets: 1) I not only read this garbage to the end but 2) I actually paid money for this tripe. Even as fiction this premise is hard to swallow.
B00009V7T2|5.0|I dont know where I should start....First of all allow me to say that I havent really enjoyed music that much for about the last 7-8 years (or maybe I just didnt listen to the music as much as b4 therefore I didnt get used to it). Either way, out of the mountian of garbage that has been release over the last decade; few bands have set themselves apart. One of these bands happens to be &quot;At the drive-in&quot;, so you could imagine my sadness when the band broke up. I thought maybe it would be a long time again before anything worth listening to would come along. I was wrong. Thankfully, the more talented members (Afros) of ATDI decided to form a seperate band, The Mars Volta.<br />There is no way to objectively review this, so take this for whatever its worth...The Mars Volta - &quot;De-Loused in the Comatorium&quot; is a spectacular album. If you like Led Zepplin, Santana, or ATDI you'll love this album. If you dont, you'll love this album. It's that good!
0385504209|3.0|I recently finished reading THE DA VINCI CODE. I must say, it is a very riveting novel. As a Catholic, however, I noticed that the book did have a decidedly anti-Catholic slant. By this I do not mean that Dan Brown bashed Catholics. I mean that some important things that were said about the Church were, perhaps, not as well-researched as they could have been.<br />THE DA VINCI CODE is, of course, a work of fiction. And, as such, it was enjoyable. Many people will learn quite a bit from this novel. Unfortunately, many people unfamiliar with authentic Catholicism may get a very negative impression of the Church since they might assume that all of the historical references are accurate and meticulously verified. After reading this book, I have come to conclude that this is simply not the case. Which is unfortunate because the book is a runaway bestseller and many will assume that its references to the Church are all accurate.<br />Brown's novel seems to have many historical inaccuracies. One example of this is found on page 233 of the book. A character named Sir Leigh Teabing, who is a Grail authority, is discussing the history of the Grail. He is speaking with two other characters in the story -- Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu. Teabing tells them that the belief in the divinity of Jesus was something that the Council of Nicaea, in effect, made up in 325 AD. Leigh Teabing says to Sophie Neveu, \\"My dear, until that moment in history, Jesus was viewed by His followers as a mortal prophet...a great and powerful man, but a man nonetheless. A mortal.\\" Sophie Neveu then asks, \\"Not the Son of God?\\" Teabing then responds, \\"Right. Jesus' establishment as 'the Son of God' was officially proposed and voted on by the Council of Nicaea.\\"<br />The fact is that up until the Council of Nicaea, there were a variety of opinions as to the nature of Jesus Christ. The idea of Jesus being human and divine was very difficult for people to fathom back then. And it is still difficult to comprehend today. Some pre-Nicene Christians believed that Jesus was God, but not really a true human being. One of the big reasons that Gnosticism was ruled a heresy by the Nicene Council was ostensibly because they believed Jesus to be divine but not human. Conversely, another group known as Arians were also branded as heretics ostensibly because they believed Jesus to be a human but not God. All Christians, however, believed Jesus to be the Son of God in whatever way they may have understood this at the time. To imply, as I think Dan Brown does, that the Council of Nicaea proposed this new concept of Jesus' divinity in 325 AD is a misleading oversimplification at best.<br />The assertion in this book that Christians did not view Jesus as the divine Son of God until the Council of Nicaea is factually incorrect. Yes, there were diverse opinions about Jesus' nature in the early church. And some Christians did not understand Jesus to be God per se. But, the majority of the Christians did not view Jesus as simply a mortal prophet. And Mary Magdalene certainly viewed Jesus as divine. We see this in both the New Testament and the Nag Hammadi Library.<br />What Dan Brown's character goes on to say about the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Nag Hammadi Library can also be very misleading. He says the following:<br />***Fortunately for historians, some of the gospels that Constantine attempted to eradicate managed to survive. The Dead Sea Scrolls were found in the 1950s (sic) hidden in a cave near Qumran in the Judean desert. And, of course, the Coptic Scrolls (sic) in 1945 at Nag Hammadi. In addition to telling the true Grail story, these documents speak of Christ's ministry in very human terms.<br />(THE DA VINCI CODE, page 234).***<br />The Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered in 1947 (not the 1950s). They do not mention Jesus Christ at all. And they were hidden in those caves c. 70 AD, some 250 years before the Council of Nicaea for reasons that had absolutely nothing to do with the asyet unborn Emperor Constantine at all.<br />The Nag Hammadi texts are incorrectly called \\"scrolls\\" in this book. They were, in fact, codices. And they do not mention anything about Jesus and Mary Magdalene having children, being married, or having a sexual relationship at all. Mary Magdalene is referred to as the disciple whom Jesus loved and as the \\"companion\\" of Jesus. And, granted, some have translated the Coptic word as \\"consort\\" rather than \\"companion.\\" But I think its a leap to say that these documents tell \\"the true Grail story\\" based on this. Furthermore, since the Nag Hammadi texts were probably compiled by Gnostics, in them a great emphasis is placed on the divine Risen Jesus who is alive and revealing his divine glory to a select group of people, particularly Mary Magdalene. I would hardly call the image of Jesus in the Nag Hammadi texts as that of a mortal prophet.<br />Normally, nitpicking about the accuracy of statements of fact in a novel would be a bit much. After all, an author is entitled to a certain amount of creative license. However, I comment on these historical innaccuracies in light of Dan Brown's own statement on the first page preceding his Prologue. Under the heading \\"Facts\\" he writes: \\"All description of artwork, architecture, documents, and secret rituals in this novel are accurate.\\" Clearly, some of them, as pointed out here, are not.<br />On the whole, however, the book was very interesting. I think many people will learn alot of interesting things about the Quest for the Grail, the Templars, Leonardo da Vinci, the secret societies...etc. I was disappointed with the way the book seems to paint the Catholic Church in a negative light with broad brushstrokes. Dan Brown should have made more of an effort to be more historically accurate. I, for one, am not an authority on the Grail history. And I think I learned a lot about it by reading this novel. But, after seeing the way the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Nag Hammadi Library, and the Council of Nicaea were discussed in this book, I now feel the need to double check all of the purported facts outlined in this novel.the as yet unborn Emperor Constantine at all. <br />The Nag Hammadi texts are incorrectly called \\"scrolls\\" in this book.

B00005JLSE|4.0|Within the movie, you can feel the Fosse stage charisma for what parts crave dancing / singing, and a few others, while other scenes do mix in well as movie made moments. <br />The characters are more than fine and dandy, carrying tunes with golden voices, attitude, and a lot of sweat. Zeta-Jones steals the show throughout as the woman of women in show buisness &quot;Velma Kelly&quot;. Her vixen stares to the audience and her commanding strong voice (wow!) is showstopping ! But don't stop the show!<br />Renee Zellweger's voice almost equals Jones, her Roxie Hart becoming a yearner for the fame and attention of show buisness and the media. Even Hart's confused husband who can't make up his mind about his murdering wife (John C. Reiley) carries the favourite tune, 'Mr. Celophane' and makes it sound so vaudeville perfect. Also check out the beautiful Queen Latifah, making sure all of her little girls in the prison ward she runs stay in line, for a litte cash. Just call her 'Mama'. Man, can she sing ! <br />Richard Gere is an above average singer and good tap dancer, but makes his best as a lawyer who never loses. My favourite moments is when our cool bandleader comes around. Taye Diggs always has his voice heard in any part/room/moment of the movie when a song is starting. His smooth voice, and smooth intro's of anyone and any song was neat to anticipate. The man!<br />Every environment/place/room was set to the tea for a flapper and jazz era story. <br />That's Chicago.
0802130208|5.0|This classic piece of comedy/socail satire ranks as one of my all-time favorite books.  John Kennedy Toole has created one of the best characters of modern fiction in Ignatius Reilly, a highly edjucated, but socailly maladjusted buffoon who still lives with his mother at the age of thirty.  A comic series of events forces him out of his womb-like existance to seek work in a world that fails to meet his &quot;worldview&quot;.  Great characters and outrageous dialog fill this highly readable book with numerous laughs.  That the author comitted suicide is a tragedy for the lovers of fiction.
0767830555|5.0|Silence broods like a bevy of knives through one's subconscious.  Why do people literally hate being alone?  I believe the answer lies in our minds.  We, as human beings, are naturally afraid of being alone with our thoughts...our vivid imaginations.  Paul Schrader can certainly attest to that after writing Taxi Driver, and John Hinckley Jr. is living proof of the truth the film held.  Drew Barrymore could tell you first-hand how real the film was to her.  While our minds are capable of the most imaginative and beautiful dreams, the same mind may also yield horrific nightmares and destruction.  <br />\\"This utter aloneness is at the center of Taxi Driver...perhaps it is why so many people connect with it even though Travis Bickle would seem to be the most alienating of movie heroes. We have all felt as alone as Travis. Most of us are just better at dealing with it (Ebert, Chicago Sun Times '96).\\"  Travis Bickle is the mind of Scorsese's recurring character study, and the first among the three characters that accompany the mind, body, and soul of the isolated human in Scorsese's films.  (The other 2 are Jake La Motta - the body and Rubert Pipkin - the soul)  He directs the film almost entirely through the corroded subjective eyes of Travis.  Therefore, we the audience are forced to see what he sees and feel how he feels, resulting in our inability to escape the escalating terror festering in his fragile, eggshell mind.  <BR>Countless examples throughout Taxi Driver display this bizarre and disturbing study of the mind.  The film begins with a smoke-filled street illuminating with red fiery lights as Bickle's taxi drives by like a hearse in a graveyard.  Even the schizophrenic soundtrack suggests an eerie partisanship with Bickle's clouded perspective, going back and forth between smooth jazz and a ferocious drum thrashes and orchestration.  All he sees on the streets are hoodlums, prostitutes, thieves, and degenerates.  As far as the audience knows, we're not in New York or some big city...we're in hell.  Perhaps we're in Bickle's own personal hell in his mind.<br />If you're interested in a film that studies humanity in its most vulnerable state, this film will live up to your expectations.  If you're interested in a film that critiques the 1970s and the obsession with celebrity, then this this film will give you what you want.<br />In addition, the Collector's Edition gives you plenty of special features, including the original script, documentaries, photo stills, and trailers.<br />A great buy if it's less than $20.
B00005JKZV|4.0|ok, i've read half of the Two Towers already, and i have to admitt that yes, the movie sevearly changes the plot of the book by extending some sceens (Helms deep battle, shortening others (Most of the Ent stuff), and making up a whole lot (that dog/beast battle). But so what?? movies would be extremely boring if they follow the book. Look at Harry Potter and its 2 movies. If you read the book, there is no need for you to go see the movie, they practicly leave nothing out and that gets boring. With the Lord of the Rings, Peter Jackson took the story in his own hands to make it more understandable and more interesting. BUt you have to remember before going to see this movie that it is a fantasy based on a real book. It isnt going to be one of those stupid movies held in New York that is wipped up from a director and/or writer. It is completely different, and of course, you have to make it seem scary and discusting with those hidious Orcs. That is what makes it original. Though the only problem i have with the movie and the book is that it is so male oriented with only 2 woman maximum. But you cant change that because it is based on the book. It is bad enough, however that they slap on Liv Tyler on every poster and enlarge her so that she sticks out from the main characters, where she is not one. <BR>Anyway that isnt important. But just go  see the movie and try to respect it for what it really is!
B00005JKN9|3.0|I came to this film prejudiced in it's favor. It sounds tremendous: Martin Scorsese directs an epic of the violent history of his New York 'hood, complete with class and religious wars, all-consuming corruption, and the potential for moral crises galore.  It may be that the film we're seeing is badly comprimised due to Scorseses' celebrated conflicts with producer Harvey Weinstein (there's an hilarious in-joke where one man stabs another while explaining \\"I wish you would stop making that noise, Harvey.\\")  But even if a much better 3 or 4 or 5-hour director's cut of this finally surfaces, I doubt it will prove to be the \\"masterpiece\\" that many of the commentators here are declaring this film to be.<br />While the film has it's pleasures--I don't mean to suggest it's a total dud--the narrative energy sags badly, the film's themes are not very richly developed, and the performances are surprisingly weak.  [Note:  I'll mention a few incidents in the film below, so if you don't want any of the plot \\"spoiled,\\" stop reading here.] <br />Daniel Day-Lewis is clearly the star of the show, doing a Robert DeNiro impersonation much of the time, but his scene-stealing doesn't really seem to activate the fictional world around him.  Leonardo deCaprio is terribly miscast, and what seems to have been intended as the epic core of the film--DeCaprio's twisting and tormented journey from priest's child to thug to immigrant emancipator and avenger--never gathers much weight.  The lightweight unreality of it all (despite frequent gore) is enhanced by the movie-star treatment given deCaprio and Cameron Diaz, both of whom remain implausibly pretty in these environs.  There's a scene where deCaprio's face is deliberately mutilated and burned by the most brutal character in the film, and the resultant injury amounts to a pink beauty mark on his cheek.  Sheesh.<br />Almost any other film by Scorsesce deserves recommendation above this one. (\\"Goodfellas,\\" \\"Casino,\\" \\"Taxi Driver\\" and \\"King ofComedy\\" are all excellent, for a start.)  For a similar subject and scope, both \\"The Godfather\\" and the restored \\"Once Upon A Time in America\\"  are clearly superior to \\"Gangs of New York\\".

0064409422|5.0|It's been a long time since I read The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe as a child but, even now, I can remember the magic that book gave me. I've just re-read it as an adult and it's still a wonderful, spriritual experience - perhaps more so.<br />CS Lewis wrote these books with a very obvious allegory - obvious, perhaps, for everyone except the target audience! Some people will say, therefore, that these are Christian books - suitable only for Christians perhaps? But I strongly disagree. The tales provide strong moral guidelines (in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Edmund is led astray by the empty promises of the white witch and has to have his sin's redeemed by a sacrifice) but they can be read at many levels and one is just a pure fairy tale. It is really a tale of good versus evil.<br />In this book (which despite the re-numbering, I still consider to be the first book!), we are introduced to the four children - brothers and sisters - who's adventures we see. Like many children's authors, CS Lewis uses the concept of separation from the parents to provide a safe haven for imagination - in this case wartime evacuation leads to a very strange house with a wonderful old man who allows them - encourages them - to explore what truth is. In this case \\"truth\\" lies beyond a wardrobe in the magical land of Narnia. A land in the midst of a permanent winter caused by the magic of an evil queen. As the children explore this world, and meet it's good and bad inhabitants, they are each changed and grow with the experience.<br />The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a very accessible book open to young readers - in fact, it would be suitable for one of the first chapter books I feel. Yet it has enough depth that it can be read by older children again and again - much as I did as a child!
B0000A36J5|5.0|It`s very difficult to say more that has already been said but I`ll try.As it`s said in the previous review, most of the so-called \\"purists\\" will find something to say but guys, PJ and the others did a great job we can`t compare the books to the movies.This movie has great photography,good casting and like it and love it for what it is...can`t wait to see ROTK. ...
B000089CJI|1.0|I listened to this CD various times in broken parts and then once from start to finish all the way. I found it to be extremely irritating. I'm sorry, I just don't get it. The Postal Service is not for me. It has nothing that I look for in music. My tastes are a lot different than the other people who reviewed, so take your pick..... It just sounds like a seventeen year old kid who got dumped by his girlfriend and now he's using his PC and Nintendo to make cute music for little girls to dance to. Why anyone would wanna buy this album is beyond me.
B000058983|5.0|My brother Ken used to play this album a lot back in the 1960s; I was only a preteen.  But Christmastime 2002 he and I were walking down the street singing, &quot;They're locking us up today/They're throwing away the key...&quot;  Then June 2003 Ken saw fit to invite me to a Love concert.  A few weeks later I bought the album.  I find this music inspiring, instructive, touching, and viscerally moving, from the sweet, romantic &quot;Andmoreagain&quot; (Ann Morgan? I'd thought), to social warnings like &quot;Red Telephone&quot; (the song quoted above) and &quot;Live and Let Live&quot; (&quot;Oh, the snot has caked against my pants...&quot;--which is really about violence against American Indians), to the uplifting, soul-stirring &quot;You Set the Scene&quot; (&quot;this is the time and life that I am living...&quot;).  Often this music has sweet melodies juxtaposed against piercing, even scathing lyrics, layered with a brass-and-violins orchestral arrangement.  But then, I've always liked the blending of classical stylings with rock music.  Highly, HIGHLY recommended!  Thanks, Ken, for putting this into my life and consciousness!
B000060MMI|5.0|After reading a few of these reviews, I wonder if I'm the only person that prefers &quot;Druken Lullabies&quot; over &quot;Swagger&quot;?  Lullabies is the first CD in a long time that I am able to listen straight through without skipping songs.  The title track is energetic and fun.  Try keeping your toes still listening to that one.  &quot;Raise What's left of the Flag for Me&quot; is brillant.  I love how is starts off slow and melodic and then the drums come in when Dave sings &quot;Then the rosary beads count them one two three Fell apart as they hit the floor...&quot;  &quot;Cruel Mistress&quot; is a cool pirate song sung by Nathan Maxwell who has a very punk voice.  Reminds me of Rancid for some reason.  &quot;Another Bag of Bricks&quot; has a cool eastern flair that brings something really different to the album.  That has to be my favorite song out of all of them.  &quot;The Son Never Shines (on closed doors)&quot; is a lovely ballad.  I love how Bridget Regan does the backing vocals.  All in all, this is a worthy CD that EVERYONE should own.  It appeals to the punk side of me as well as the side of me that wishes I was Irish.  Cheers!
B000002J03|5.0|Led Zeppelin. NEED I SAY MORE!!! They are so brilliant in all of their work. I cannot even begin to tell you how much these 4 amazing people change my life. Their music is the healing of my problems..haha.. but ne way they are the best next to Jimi Hendrix. Led Zeppelins music is out of this world!!! Jimmy page is one Amazing guitar player, and hell yes this man can write such beautiful music..they all can!! I truly love this group and they will forever rule rock and roll!!!!
B00006690G|4.0|this album is not his best album, but it sure as hell isn't one of his worst either. this song has its hot tracks, then it also got its not so hot tracks. overall this album is above average, nothing really bad about it at all... his first hit single and first video off the album was without you. and on this track, he talks sh*t about moby, limp bizkit, and chris kirkpatrick of n sync. his second video, was cleanin out my closet, where he disses his mother real bad once again, and i think that style is wearing off. his third video was lose yourself off the 8 mile soundtrack since it wasnt on this album, then his newest video was sing for the moment from this album. he has other artist such as D12, obie trice, nate dogg, etc....this album is a definate must have to all eminem fans, and if you are not an eminem fan, it wouldnt hurt to buy this album..
B00008OLYN|5.0|So what do I know from death metal?  Zero.  I heard part of a song, probably on Much Music, whilst channel surfing.  I'm like, what is this?  It some band called OPETH.  Never heard of 'em.  But the song is a killer, so I buy this album.  I am blown away.  I hear echoes of the original King Crimson.  I am on my feet whirligigging about as this music vibrates within me.  I am a believer. These guys remind me of why I first listened to progressive rock 35 years ago.  Apparently, this album is a departure.  If so, whew! keep departing.
B00005JL96|5.0|I watched this movie with my nephew Edrick and we both loved it.<BR>I truly believe this is one of Disney's best animated movies!<BR>The story was interesting, very funny and by the end, very touching.<BR>What I liked in particular, is that all the characters in this movie were flawed and they behaved like real kids and adults. In most Disney movies, the characters are too &quot;perfect&quot; and &quot;heroic&quot; ... in this movie both Lilo and Stitch were &quot;brats&quot; and Lilo's sister had problems keeping her life together.<BR>By the end of the movie, all of these characters grow in some way and become better beings.<br />I highly recommend this movie. It would make a great present!

B00005JLSE|3.0|I am a huge theatre fan and am absolutely thrilled at the idea that the movie musical is making a comeback. I've read over a few of the other reviews here and agree with many of them. I do not believe Chicago should have received the Oscar even though it is a fabulous movie (Moulin Rouge is the definite standout here although I am not going to get into a diatribe over the differences here.) However, again, this is a great movie and a credit to it's genre. The direction and editing are great, the music video feel is wonderful given today's audience penchant for this. The acting is fantastic...a true ensemble work. Having performed on stage in the role of Hunyak I have a special place in my heart for this show. My only disappointment in the movie itself is that the satire that is so prevalent in the stage production seems overwashed by the &quot;razzle-dazzle&quot; of the movie itself. <br />The only real comparison I will make to Moulin Rouge in regards to this is that the Moulin Rouge DVD was a dream come true. All the extras from the rehearsals to costumes to unedited dance numbers and different camera angles was a true gift to those of us who love to get into our movies. I'm disappointed that Chicago did not follow suit. While I am happy that the deleted scene of Class is here (although a version of the movie with it edited in vs. just a music video would have been preferable) I am highly disappointed at the overall DVD.<br />It's a movie I believe worth owning...just don't expect too much from the DVD itself.
0887307280|5.0|I was referred to this book by someone who immersed himself in Michael Gerber's philosophy.  This person was able to create a successful and profitable business based on the concepts presented in this book.  <br />The philosophy is broken down in two main themes.  The first is that too many people work in their business, and not enough people work on their business.  The second is that most successful businesses, regardless of their size, operate in a franchise model.  This means the business can operate as a turn-key model, which would make it easy to sell or replicate anywhere.<br />Gerber opines that most small businesses in the US fail.  It is not because the people running them are stupid; they are not.  Many people allow too many assumptions to get in the way of running a business.  Contrary to a popular myth, most successful businesses are not run exclusively by entrepreneurs.  They are also not run exclusively by managers.  He walks the reader through the steps of maturity in the life of business, including the different types of people involved with operating the business.<br />This is a must read for small business owners and sales professionals.  There is a reason companies like McDonald's, Federal Express, Starbucks, etc. are so successful.

B000006OS2|1.0|I have always loved this movie!  Ever since I was a kid.  However, this edition's picture quality is horrible.  The film texture is grainy with almost total obliteration of the picture at several locations in the movie.<br />It appears that this edition of the movie was simply copied from a very poor quality film without any type of quality control.  You take your chance if you purchase this particular edition of McLintock.<br />My recommendation would be to wait for a digitally remastered version to appear.  This edition is not worth you money.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|Neil returns full force with a strong set of songs.Shows that there is still some substance in those &quot;old bones&quot; afterall.A dynamic release start to finish!
B000002BVN|5.0|This is an excellent album. I purchased this album thinking the remixes would be boring.I was wrong. The first 5 songs of this album are new. Here is a brief description of the songs.<br />1.Blood on the Dance Floor-A kind of violent song but it is a great song the drum beat sounds like remember the time. This song was also released as a single.10/10<BR>2.Morphine-A great song which talks about negative effects of drugs.A very fast song with a classical piece in between.This song sounds very interesting in a positive manner.10/10<BR>Superfly Sister-The lyrics to this song are in perfect order every line rhymes perfectly. This song also goes kind of fast. I love listening to it.10/10<BR>4.Ghosts-My favorite song on the album. This song has a very haunting tune. In this song Michael Jackson kills the media by asking the question Are you the ghost of jealousy.10/10<BR>5.Is It Scary-Another haunting tune but I do not like it as much as ghosts.9.5/10<BR>6.Scream Louder-A great duet with sister Janet.Both Michael and Janet are excellent vocalists. This is the best remix I have ever heard. 10/10<BR>7.Money-This song talks about jow people are crazy about money. I guess it describes me. This song has a good pace to it.10/10<BR>8.2bad-My least favorite remix but it still is really good. This song contais rap by John Forte. 8/10<BR>9.Stranger in Moscow-Another great song by this legend.The remix gave this song more energy.Now it is more danceable.10/10<BR>10.This Time Around-A great song with such a beautiful tune.10/10<BR>11.Earth Song-Another meaningful writing by Michael Jackson.This song talks about worldly problems. I reccomend it.10/10<BR>12.You Are Not Alone-A beautiful love song.It is one of the best on the album.10/10<BR>History- A little too long but still is a great remix.8.5/10<BR>Michael Jackson is the greatest artist.Here are his accomplishments-<BR>1.Michael JAcksons Thriller(1982) is the biggest selling album of all time.<BR>2.Michael JAcksons DAngerous(1993)video is the biggest selling music video of all time. <BR>3.Michael Jacksons History(1995) is the biggest selling double album of all time. <BR>4.Blood on the DAnce Floor(1997) by Michael JAckson is the biggest selling remix album of all time.
B00005JLSE|5.0|This is an exceptional adaptation of one of the most forward-thinkning Broadway musicals of it's day.  A lot of the Bob Fosse choreagraphy is intact, as well as a unique vision of the complex storyline (placing it within the furtile imagination of Roxie Hart) to explain the staged direction of the play.  Exceptional work by Rob Marshall and the team at Miramax to bring this dream production to fruition.<br />And I would be remiss without adressing the assine review from Charlotte, NC.  This is NOT a glorification of murderess and their ultimate escape from justice.  Rather, it is an indictment of the &quot;trial by press&quot; of even our current age (Kobe Bryant, OJ, etc.) when we should be more aware of the opressive effect of the media.  But what can one expect from a reviewer from the crotch of the bible belt...this movie wil stand the test of time.  A lot more than I can say for some of the slanted political views of the reviewer from Charlotte.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|At this point, Neil Young could've sat back and churned out a dozen catchy songs or made a shameless greatest hits record like most artists his age.  However, he has chosen to go in a completely new direction yet again.  Greendale is a concept album.  It is a musical stoytelling of characters which seem so real and texturous that they come alive in your imagination.  Greendale is also set to the jagged backing of the band Crazy Horse.  The record takes a couple listens to really grasp, and unfolds more with each listen.  Included in the package is a DVD of Neil perfoming the whole songlist solo, giving narrations and storytelling in between songs.  It is never possible to figure out what Neil will do next, and few artists still challenge us in that way.
B00008OWZC|5.0|I got this CD when it first came out and i still can't stop listening to it. Its much better than BBC Sessions(their first sort-of live album). ALl of their best songs are on the album and there are some really good tracks that they jam out on for about 20 minutes. If you are a big Zep fan, buy it, if not maybe get it.
B000006TRV|5.0|I find &quot;The Wall&quot; fantastic! I've been listening to it since it's release, and have always loved it. It got lost in my collection until about 6 months ago. Since I've pulled it out again, I've enjoyed it at least another 10 times. &quot;The Wall&quot; is definately one of my very favorites. I enjoy the movie as well!
B000002H97|1.0|Before this CD came out, I couldn't wait to hear what Metallica would do next.  Their first four albums just kept getting better and better.  And Justice For All still blows my mind - it's one of the best metal albums ever made.  All of their albums up through and including Justice were raw and uncompromising and \\"mean\\".  (Not as heavy as Slayer, but still some great metal).  So I thought the next one would be even greater.  I got the \\"Black Album\\" just as soon as it came out and popped it in the CD player.  After the first 2 minutes, I was shocked, then just plain disheartened.  The entire CD was a big letdown.<br />This was the day Metallica died.  This album reminded me of only a slightly harder version of Poison, or Bon Jovi, or Warrant or some other crap like that.  The \\"Black\\" album should be renamed the \\"Nice\\" album because these songs are \\"nice\\" metal songs.  They won't rub anyone the wrong way.  Metal (especially speed/thrash) should NEVER, EVER be \\"nice\\".  I guess that's the worst thing about this CD - there is nothing on it that sounds inspired or inspiring.  There is nothing aggressive about it, the lyrics are blah, and the feel of the album is just flat.  It's like watching one of those big, expensive, stupid, summer blockbuster movies like \\"Armageddon\\" that try to impress you special effects, but in the end, totally lack depth, heart and soul.  The band was capable of doing much better.  This is just lowest common denominator, spineless, vacuous pop metal.<br />It gets one star because all four members still have musical chops - that is, they can play their instruments well.<br />Slayer - now there is a band that survived the 80's and 90's with their integrity still intact.....LONG LIVE SLAYER!
0930289528|5.0|This story shows England in 1996 (it was the future in 1987, when this was writter) and how it has become a fascist and over-bearing society that is teeming w/ corruption, greed and misery. The whole of England is controlled by the leader who has equipped the streets and homes w/ microphones, video cameras in order to spy on its citizens. But all this is disrupted by a man who wears a mask w/ a large smile (see cover). Gradually throghout the story we see his origin (he was put in a concentration camp w/ the Gays, the Jews and the African-Americans and experimented upon). We also see the emergence of other chracters w/ a variety of motives and personalities who add to the story. It is close to the Watchmen story (also by Alan Moore) but it draws more closely to 1984 by Geroge Orwell. It is sorta depressing and the end and the novel ends w/ a very great mystery not being revealed.
B00005JKCH|3.0|Watching \\"Spider-Man,\\" I was reminded of the first time I saw \\"Batman.\\" I walked away from that movie awed by the visuals, but completely unmoved by the characters (even Jack Nicholson's over-the-top performance was a caricature, not a character). But \\"Spider-Man\\" did something very unusual for films in this genre: it made me care for the people in it far more than I cared for its spectacle.<br />And, in reflection, that's a good thing, since the spectacle here isn't all that spectacular. More about that later - for now, let's just say that \\"Spider-Man\\" is perhaps the most emotionally involving comic-book movie ever made. <br />That is in no small part due to Tobey Maguire, who is absolutely perfect as the all-too-human Peter Parker, a nerdy young man who is bitten by a \\"super spider\\" and develops superhuman capabilities. At first, he simply tries to cash in on his newfound powers, as any teenager probably would, but he's reminded tragically that someone who has his capabilities should be using them to better the world, not to rule on \\"WWF Smackdown.\\"  <br />This is, of course, the essential \\"backstory\\" that all comic book characters have, and this one really clicks. Batman is a borderline personality, and Superman is too good for his own good; in \\"Spider-Man,\\" we have a pretty normal guy who's only abnormal in his capabilities, which makes him darned easy to relate to, and admire.<br />It's all about motivation when it comes to comic books. Batman is motivated by emotional pain, and Superman is motivated by his too-good-to-be-true nature; it's very difficult to see either character's life playing out much differently than they do. But Peter's destiny is chosen, not by his psychological problems or emotional programming, but by himself. He can be what he wants, and he wants to be a super-hero, but more importantly, he chooses to be a super-hero in a way that doesn't hurt his loved ones.<br />This means sacrificing things that most young men wouldn't be prepared to do without, most prominently the love of his life, Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst). At first, Peter's too shy and insecure to do anything but pine away over her, but as his confidence grows, Mary Jane begins to see him in a different life, and eventually falls for him. But Peter chooses not to make himself avaiable to her for a simple reason: he's made all too aware that the only way to defeat Spider-Man is to hurt his loved ones. <br />The comparisons to other superheroes come up again. Batman is too screwed-up to have a normal relationship, and Superman is physically incapable of one without giving up his powers. But Peter would be perfectly capable of having having a normal love life, and probably would be a heck of a catch for any woman with half a brain, and chooses not to because it would endanger her.<br />There's real humanity and pathos in that decision, and Maguire's performance really brings that out.<br />There's also real humanity in the central villain, Norman Osborne (Willem Dafoe), a corporate magnate who inadvertently releases a lot more than his physical potential when he tests out his company's performance enhancing drug. His personality splits between the marginally likeable Osborne, and the Green Goblin, who's the kind of villain that likes to roll off long, evil laughs and lines like, \\"he must be instructed in pain and loss.\\" Osborne's son Harry (James Franco) is Parker's best friend, and even after Spider-Man finally defeats him, Osborne's dying wish is that his son never finds out about his secret supervillain side. Of course, Peter, being the honorable guy that he is, honors that dying wish, even when Harry threatens revenge against Spider-Man.<br />How long has it been since we saw a villain in one of these movies with real humanity? Only Lex Luthor, and perhaps Jim Carrey's Riddler, come close. All the rest, including Nicholson's Joker, are just cartoon characters - fun to watch, but ultimately empty and uninvolving.<br />This all makes for a good basic drama, built on nice dialogue and fine performances - a rarity in films of this sort, which almost invariably succeed as spectacle and fail miserably as drama. But \\"Spider-Man\\" has the opposite problem - it succeeds as drama but fails a spectacle.<br />The fight sequences play well, but whenever Spider-Man takes to the air, and the CGI effects cross the screen, it plays like a video game - flat, graceless, and obvious. Spider-Man looks no more real or graceful than Sonic the Hedgehog, and the effect is even more pronounced on a television screen. Many recent films, notably the latest Star Wars prequel, have shown that CGI can create animation that has real weight, realism and elegance. I don't know any other reason, save budgetary concerns, that would drive the filmmakers to settle for such obvious, silly effects here. <br />In the end, the effects don't ruin this film - the basic goodness of the story and the quality of its telling preclude that - but with better visuals, this would have been a total triumph. As it is, I'm sure that the immense success of this film will enable the producers to hire a more competent visual effects shop for the upcoming sequel.<br />And if that sequel is able to replica the human impact of \\"Spider-Man,\\" then that movie will truly be something to see.
B00006IU73|5.0|Prog Schmog. Can we please forego the obsession with musical pigeon-holing and simply acknowledge that Porcupine Tree is an unusual and exiting band - one that consistently defies musical genres from album to album and within each. One can find echoes of Pink Floyd, King Crimson, early CSN, NIN, The Doors, XTC... (Hence the lack of big label musical and visual recognition.) However, Steven Wilson describes these as \\"explorations\\" as opposed to imitation. I was fortunate enough to catch these guys in concert recently in Boston. Way beyond my expectations. Wandering and focused, thundering and dreamy. Wilson recalls when he was eight years old his parents simultaneously buying Dark side Of the Moon and Donna Summer's \\"Love To Love You Baby.\\" Prophetic. Never in my 30 plus years of musical exploration has an artist or band captured my attention so fully. Never has an album or CD received as much rotation in my collection as \\"In Absentia.\\" Buy this CD, even if you love Donna Summer.
B00007K02F|3.0|I love period films, epics, and film adaptations of classical literature.  I am not an expert, however.  I have seen this film quite a few times, but only in bits and pieces.  The dialog often drags, and it causes the viewer to grow impatient for some true &quot;meat&quot; to chew on.<br />I thought the beginning of the movie depicting Jane's childhood (I am not referencing it back to the text for authenticity, mind you) was quite good.  I watched this with interest.<br />I rather liked the young Adelle and the other characters at Thornfield.  However, the grave dissapointment came from Mr. Rochester.  While I am sure this gentleman may be a fine actor elsewhere, he was not suited for this role.  His coloring, his non-accent, his build, his mannerisms, all of these things gave him a large hurdle to overcome, and unfortunately he never did.  I found him to be very weird... not dark and peculiar like the true Mr. Rochester.  Because of this, I did not find myself longing for the ultimate union of the two characters in the end.<br />The black and white version was far better.
B00005JM09|4.0|T3 is by far the most unique of the series and of the sci-fi genre that I've seen in the past 5 years. It provides the series a slap in the face, if you will. One of the primary themes of the series has been \\"The future is not set. There is no fate but what we make for ourselves.\\" One of T3's most significant themes, quite contrary to this, is that some things are inevitable. Since the beginning, the Terminator series was man against machine, man wins. T3 turns the tide. The inevitability of the war and the machines rising crashes in on the audience. Now, part of the future will happen, no matter what is done to try to avoid it. This theme is frequently found in independent films that want to reveal a future that is as likely to happen as triumphant man, but do not cater to the popular vote or the highest dollar. This was totally unexpected, and is quite unnerving when you consider that in 100% of all box-office sci-fi hits, either 1) man triumphs, 2) man has the choice to control fate, or 3) that all of existance revolves around man. T3 took me by surprise, and I hope that it finds your guard down as well.

B0000AXE8I|4.0|They did not do the sound track on the first Matrix in DTS 5.1 sound and it is weak!  Now they are going to do the same thing again with the sequal.  All of the money spent on sound for the movie but yet when it goes to DVD they will not invest in DTS.  The sound should always be neck and neck with the picture quality.  It is sad.
0688163173|5.0|I ususally do not write reviews, not because I do not like the books I read, but because I don't like to give a lot away, as<br />I have seen some do.<br />BUT........for those of you who like the old &quot;locked room&quot; mysteries, this is the best.
B000069CWE|5.0|When I heard the the second Linkin Park CD was nothing more than a remix of the first one, I was thinking that it would most likely not be as good as the first one. Boy was I suprised! I nearly jumped out of my chair after listening to it! The only way for me to describe this CD is to rate every song on it :<br />01 : Opening<BR>Rating - N/A<BR>This is a very smooth, soft opening. It gets you ready for the next [awsome]song...<br />02 : Pts.Of.Athrty<BR>Rating - 5/5<BR>This song may not be the best (in my opinion) on the CD, but it sure is a great one to put in the begining. If you've heard all of the Hybrid Theory songs and loved them, then you'll find yourself jumping to this one.<br />03 : Enth E Nd<BR>Rating - 4/5<BR>Unlike the one in Hybrid Theory which is total rockish, this one has been converted to more of a rap-type style. Of course, it still kix, but if you're not a rap fan, you probably won't enjoy the song as much as you did the original version.<br />05 : Frgt/10<BR>Rating - 3/5<BR>Notice I skip some tracks because they're nothing but talking. This song has been changed to a much softer version than it's original. It keeps a nice beat and is still a good song, but doesn't fully make it to the best of the album.<br />06 : P5hng Me A*wy<BR>Rating - 4/5<BR>This one is more like it's original than any other on this CD. It keeps the same type of beat, but just has a different taste to it. You'd have to experience it to understand. After this slowish song, we move on to the really good stuff...<br />07 : Plc. 4 Mie Haed<BR>Rating - 5/5<BR>This one is also one of the best on the CD. It's been changed from rock, to more of a rock/rap one. It really keeps a good hard beat. This one might give you goosebumps!<br />08 : X-Ecutioner Style<BR>Rating - 4/5<BR>If this were actually a full song, it could have gotten a full 5 rating, but it only lasted for about 2 minutes. It's got VERY NICE DJ-ing going through out the entire song.<br />09 : H! Vltg3<BR>Rating - 4/5<BR>I personally like this song a lot, but I know many people who don't like it at all. It has a good hitting bass beat to it. It's nothing like it's original though. It's original had more of a rap style to it and now it's been converted to basically even higher forms of rap.<br />11 : Wth>You<BR>Rating - 4/5<BR>It's original was probably a bit better. It's got almost too much rock in it. It has it's goods and bads. It depends on who you are and what you like. Listen to it!<br />13 : Ppr:Kut<BR>Rating - 5/5<BR>I'll admit that the original was PROBABLY better, but it is very close! It's got a more rap thing going on in it, but is sure does make you want to bob your head to it. <br />14 : Rnw@y<BR>Rating - 4/5<BR>This song has basically just more beat to it than the original. It's like Linkin Park has just decided to play the same track, but just add more beat to it. It's really good!<br />15 : My<Dsmbr<BR>Rating - 4/5<BR>It really depends on if you like a lot of bass or not. The original was so soft ans smooth. This one is about the same, except it's got some HARD bass hitting and a bit of extra rock that doesn't ruin the soft exterior. Again, it depends on what you like.<br />17 : By_Myslf<BR>Rating - 5/5<BR>This one is by far a GREAT song. The bass is so greatly put on this song. If you have a great car system and you play this song, you'll think at first that it is just going to play some [nothing] beat. You'll find yourself turning your volume and bass up and then find out that your head will be hitting the windshield from the massive amount of bass this song actually gives out about 10 seconds from the intro of it. All-in-all, it's probably the best song on the album, if not 1Stp Klosr. It's a good tie.<br />18 : Kyur4 Th Ich<BR>Rating - 4/5<BR>It's a remix of a good mix. The original might have been a bit better. I can't really explain this one too well. <br />19 : 1Stp Klosr<BR>Rating - 5/5<BR>Probably the actual best song on the album. If you liked the original, you're guaranteed to LOVE this one. It will give you an extreme case of goosebumps when Jonathan Davis comes into play. It all starts smooth and shows you how technical LP can get... after about a good few minutes of playing around with high-quality hits, the song breaks out and will leave you with your mouth hanging. Awesome song!<br />20 : Krwlng <BR>Rating - 3/5<BR>It starts out like the Opening did and slowly gets up into the song. It is slow all the way through, but it doesn't seem to match the perfection of it's original version.
B00004LN16|5.0|After Back in Black, I think this is AC/DC's best album.  It has the good rock sound and good vocals.  The best songs on the CD are \\"Safe in New York City\\" (very catchy bass), \\"Can't Stop Rock 'n Roll,\\" and \\"All Screwed Up.\\"  A very good CD for of AC/DC fans and newcomers alike.
B00009V7RF|3.0|This CD is nowhere near the quality of a normal BEP cd.  With tracks such as Shut Up, it appears they were geared towards a mainstream or radio audience.  For a group that has made albums such as Bridging The Gap and Behind THe Front, this album is not near a 5 star rating like it is recieving.  I love Black Eyed Peas, but this album was just a let down.
6305949980|5.0|Whether you are into Halloween, Christmas, or just good entertainment, this film is a must see.  The story follows the exploits of Halloweentown's most prominant citizen, Jack Skellington, as he searches within and without to become self actualized.  No longer satisfied with  the pedestrian hoopla that surrounds his holiday, Jack sets out to conquor Christmas and finds that the grass is not always greener on the other side.<br />Plot aside, this film with its obvious nod to the German Expressionist movement, is a feast for the eyes.  Its twisted perspective and dark, brooding sets appeal to my morose side, yet the overall atmosphere remains fun and humorous.  The production values are a veritible tour de force of the stop-motion animator's art and Danny Elfman's soundtrack is nothing less than a modern masterpiece!<br />You don't have to be a lonely, disenfranchised, &quot;goth&quot; teenager to appreciate the look of this film --it has something for everyone.  Some characters might be a tad too gruesome for impressionable little eyes, however.  I'd save this treat for the post-diaper set.<br />The Nightmare Before Christmas is destined to become a holiday classic in the tradition of the Great Pumpkin or Rudolph.
B000003TAB|5.0|This, in my own personal opinion, is the greatest Nirvana album ever released.  Though those new to Nirvana will want to start with &quot;Nevermind,&quot; &quot;Incesticide&quot; is still their finest masterpiece.  <br />It opens with &quot;Dive&quot;, a great opener with a bassline that pulls you in from the get-go.  It moves to &quot;Sliver,&quot; which I could fill the review about by itself; it's a childhood portrait that is both amusing and mildly chilling, with a great flow.<br />&quot;Stain&quot; follows up to &quot;Sliver,&quot; a fine example of the transition from &quot;Bleach&quot; to &quot;Nevermind.&quot;  &quot;Been a Son&quot; is a song obviously inspired by the Vaselines and has a great tune to it, and is very easy to sing along to.  &quot;Turnaround&quot; throws you for a loop stuck between two rather upbeat songs, but is great in its own right.<br />The next two songs on the album are &quot;Molly's Lips&quot; and &quot;Son of a Gun,&quot; both actually songs by the Vaselines.  I've listened to the original version of &quot;Molly's Lips,&quot; and I'll tell you that Nirvana brought their music from a song with just potential to two of the greatest songs I've ever heard.  I will never, ever get sick of those two songs.  They were, for me, completely worth the purchase price alone.<BR>  <BR>&quot;(New Wave) Polly&quot; is a strange trip indeed, taking what we knew as a quiet acoustic song and blasts it in our ears at double-speed and electric guitar ablazing.  &quot;Beeswax&quot; and &quot;Downer&quot; are rather catchy and the choruses has me singing along every time I hear them.  They're not what you'd consider 'singalongable' but they still have that quality.<br />&quot;Mexican Seafood,&quot;  &quot;Hairspray Queen,&quot; and &quot;Aero Zeppelin&quot; were three of Kurt's first attempts at songwriting, at least with Nirvana.  They're all quite great, but I will give you fair warning:  &quot;Hairspray Queen&quot; will draw you in.  When you first listen to it, you'll be put off by his strange way of singing in this song.  But it's catchy bassline and riffs will draw you in and you'll begin to even enjoy his singing in this song, despite what you may think on first listen.<br />&quot;Big Long Now&quot; is a mildly haunting song that keeps you listening as it drags ever-so-slightly behind the tempo.  For some reason it reminds me a bit of a horror movie.  It's one of the standout tracks on the album.<br />The closer, &quot;Aneurysm,&quot; ends the album with a bang, ending a remarkable, catchy album with a remarkable, catchy song.  At the closing notes of this one, you'll be going for the Repeat button on your stereo.  I know that I do.<BR> 
B0000AI44Q|5.0|Alot to think about here. Cut to the the core, dry, almost sterile. &quot;Be the Rain&quot; #10 captures everything we should be thinking about. Greendale is like a talking book. I love it. Forever remember Edward Abbey and the flag with the black monkey wrench.
B00006F7IM|5.0|Best movie ever...I can recite the entire movie line for line. No fluff, chick parts are kept to a minimum and the more you watch it, the funnier it gets. Comic genius!
B00007G1ZC|2.0|When I read the very positive reviews,I was planning to buy it straight away, well fortunately I rented it first.<BR>I thought this movie was really slow it seemed to drag on and on.<BR>For example, lots of times somebody is walking to a place, or just standing still for minutes long, and you could get the point<BR>after 30 seconds or something.<BR>The visuals of the movie were ok and sometimes very original, the effects I remember the best were the of the man walking in Van Gogh paintings.<BR>The stories are filled with various lessons and philosophies about live, but somehow a lot of this felt cliched.<BR>I think I understood the deeper meaning of most of the stories, but it failed very much to impress. It was as if I had heard or read these lessons about the destructivity of the human species <BR>for example, lots of times. That's my main reason, I seemed to already know that, and now somebody is repeating it for me in some dreams.
B00005JLSE|3.0|With the award for Best Picture and five other Academy Awards under its belt, I figured I would give Chicago a try even though I am not a big fan of musicals or films that are generally eaten up by the Academy Awards (I see the Oscars as more of a popularity contest than anything). I would have to say that I found the film visually wonderful. And I also really liked some of the performances, especially from Zeta-Jones. And I do have a respect for the choreograpy work that was put into this movie and the singing that was performed. But I felt that the film moved at an awkward pace. The movie kind of felt like a big flashy ride over an extremely bumpy road. It just seemed like the events of the story moved along rather fast and were blurred by the big musical/dance performances. And yes I do realize that this was based on a broadway musical and the story is really supposed to told through the musical performances, but I found it all to be distracting and misleading. And when the film ended, I had not a clue ten minutes before that the film was in its conclusion. But like I said, musicals are not my cup of tea and I can only judge and criticize to my own personal tastes. I absolutely can see why this film would be brilliant to others. I do have a big respect for Chicago, but I don't have to like it as much as I have to respect it.
B00005JKZV|5.0|Since everyone has seen it, I won't say much about the movie itself except to say that it continues the excellence started by \\"Fellowship.\\"  Gollum has to be a landmark in digital characters.  One other note is that it has more changes from the book than Fellowship did, but I won't criticize since I can't even begin to imagine what adapting a massive story like \\"Lord of the Rings\\" to cinema would be like.  Peter Jackson had a huge task, and I'm sure we'll here all about his reasons for the changes in the Extended Edition commentary.<br />Anyway, the features of this disk (inc. a preview of the Return of the King movie, a preview of the ROTK game, and a preview of the Extended Edition to name a few) are a great appetizer for the Extended Edition.  I also like how the menus keep in line with the first DVD edition of \\"Fellowship.\\"  Even once the Extended Edition comes out, I would keep this as it represents the director's orginal work and there are things on this DVD that won't be on the Extended Edition.  I've been counting down the days to the release of this DVD since December 2002, and am finally glad to have this landmark film in my own home.
B000003S0D|5.0|Lizard, with no doubt, is one of the masterpieces recorded by Fripp and colleagues in early 70's. This album, and In The Court of the Crimson King, deserves all attentions from prog fans and rock'n roll listeners. An album full of strong jazzistic influences, filled with all melancolic mood that Crimson brought to prog rock early in 1969.<br />This line-up recorded only this album, but we can feel that they know how to put things together, improvise and really kicks off !!! Mr. Fripp is more concentrated in direct the music, not using all his odd, freaky and complex guitar abilities. Instead of it, he's using some nice acoustic guitars (only heard this way in Lizard) and his Mellotron is sounding heavenly ! (as in all early Crimson albums!). Mel Collins are playing very complex tunes and some disarmonious chords in his saxophones and flutes. These guy was, undoubtly, a strong reinforcement in Crimson's team. <br />Haskel, although having weak vocals, knows how to play melodic and simple bass lines, that perfectly fits in Fripp and Collin's crazyness! McCulloch was a very nice surprise. His jazz-like drumming reminds Michel Giles, with a little bit more complexity. Him, Collins and Fripp drives Lizard trough a marvelous prog-jazz-avant-garde record! Lizard, with the two previous albums, are simply much more prog rock with high quality Crimson song than Islands, from 71, or any other album after Red, from 74.<br />Cirkus and Happy Family are examples of complex structured tracks, with nice melodies, jazzy harmonies and dramatic lyrics. The Mellotron-driven track Circkus is among Crimson's best track ever, really dramatically strong track. Sinfield wrote one of his best lyrics for Lizard, and it's maybe Cirkus, altough all the lyrics fits very well in the album's mood. Indoor Games is an excellent track, McCulloch and Collins works gently in the central line, and it's reminds me some be-bop thing with a rock'n roll bass line. The track Lizard, with it's 23 mins, is a classic Crimson track. No other Crimson album has a long and diverse track like Lizard. Jon Anderson, as a guest, gave a beautiful contibution to the delicate melody of the first part. The Bolero part is Crimson in its all complexity and dramaticity, very strong mellotron overtures and saxophones. <br />Simply a magestic track. <br />With strong lyrics, very nice and different tunes, played by high skill musicians made Lizard a classic album from 70's and for Crimson's career. Together with In the Court of the Crimson King and In the Wake of Poseidon, these records are OBLIGATORY listening for all prog rock and avant-garde music fans ! We should remind that Larks' and Red are MASTERPIECES, but that's another story...
B000002H33|5.0|this is metallica's best CD.  it is a close race between ride the lightning and this CD, but i have to say, master of puppets takes the cake.  if you have heard, and liked kill em all, or ride the lightning, you will love this CD.  so if your a fan of speed metal, this is the CD for you.  I strongly suggest you buy it.

0061020710|5.0|If you want fantasy and you want it funny, than discworld is the place for you. This first book deals with the (mis)adventures of the magically inept wizard Rincewind, and the chaos that ensues when he is given charge of Discworlds first tourist. But, as with all of these books, anything an everything that gets in the way is fair target for jokes, and there are laughs all round as Rincewind and Twoflower the tourist get tangled into a bar-fight, a city-wide fire, a ancient good even Time is afraid of, not to forget the adventure of the upside-down mountain, or the problem of lacking pink paint.<BR>As always, the characters of the discworld books run into more trouble than they bargained for, and wind up in the company of more crazy people than you ever thought possible. <BR>Warning: This product is extremely adictive, and possibly dangerous to your mental health.
B000005YZM|5.0|Most people dont even know this cd exists and its a shame because its one of the best albums from the 67 period. I myself never even heard of it til about a year ago when a friend of mine told me i need to hear this. [gosh] im glad i bought this because i never even knew the zombies were this great , of course i knew the 3 hits and liked them but i cant believe being a 60s fan my whole life that i didnt get to hear this til i was 35. the songs are for the most part great.the harmonies and keyboard work by Rod Argent are excellent. Colin's voice is one of the smoothest distinctive and pleasant voices to listen to. BRIEF CANDLES is probably the best song on here .CARE OF CELL 44  is also perfect. i could go on and name them all but i guess you should just get it. If your even remotely a fan of British invasion psychedelic pop then this is a must own.
B000002KHY|4.0|I agree with Needs a PG 13 rating or a warning label ........, June 17, 2003.<br />I am a lifelong fan of JT , but was disappointed in Steamroller, the rest of the album is great. I also will use caution in future purchases. I hear enough of this verbal garbage in everyday life, don't want it in my music.
B00005JM02|5.0|My friends and i went to see this movie 4 times in the theater it was that good! we cannot wait until nov. 4th to buy it. Out of 10 stars with 10 being the best i would give it a 100! great for all ages! a definate must see!
B00001OH7G|5.0|I don't think that I have ever heard a performance that has more energy that this Classic Gallagher collection ... loved it when it was released ... love it today. Play it LOUD. Check out the DVD too.
0385720920|2.0|I have read all of Palahniuk's novels and liked each and every one of them,...except \\"Choke.\\"  I don't know if it's the mostly unexplored story of how the main character makes his cash which is even unbelieveable for a Palahniuk story, or how he seems to just poorly rehash stuff from his previous books.  (The sex addict clinc is straight up \\"Fight Club\\" while the medical stuff is \\"Invisible Monsters.\\")  But I think what makes this book not recommendable is how the book just seems rushed at the end.  Too many storylines that read as if they were forced to come together.<br />His other books are much better.  Read \\"Fight Club,\\" \\"Survivor,\\" \\"Invisible Monsters,\\" and \\"Lullaby.\\"  Those are the books that make you want to read more.<br />To Chuck's credit, he does tell you at the beginning that you're not going to like him; and he's right.
B00009RDGA|5.0|The joy, the sorrows a bevy of fine performances will keep your &quot;sunny side up&quot; throughout this unique period  film from the seventies. Overjoyed on hearing the news that a favorite film is being released on this superb format always is such a pleasant surprise in a sea of disposable entertainment.<br />The quality of the print and sound is &quot;picture perfect&quot; I'm sure that this will not be the &quot;Last Picture Show&quot; I'll be buying but a welcome addition in these slightly tight financial times.<br />The price of this heartfelt masterpiece is something that &quot;NO&quot; one should squabble in consideration. The memories share in &quot;Extras&quot; by Mr. Bogdanovich and members of the production crew along with rare outtakes wraps up this delectable gem like Cotton Candy swirled on a paper cone, sweet and sticky, but finger licking good!<br />Also included is the joy of a Commentary track by Mr. Bogdanovich,  now what more could you possibly asked for .... a Coney Island and a Orange Nehi?
B0000AI44Q|5.0|Mature and developed, \\"Greendale\\" is less a rock album than a fully realized novel.  Once again with something to say and with conviction to fuel it, Neil has created a town, a cast of characters and a set of individual histories that he relates in a manner akin to Garrison Keillor's \\"Lake Wobegon\\" or Wilder's \\"Our Town\\".  More than simply a set of anecdotes, however, with \\"Greendale\\" Neil is able to show the effects that the Patriot Act's paranoia and the media-fueled self-consciousness have had on ordinary folks just getting by in America.  From the opening of \\"Falling From Above\\", with Grandpa and Cousin Jed chewing the fat on the porch until the climactic transformation of the sweet granddaughter, Sun Green, into an inspired activist against oil drilling in the Alaskan arctic in \\"Be The Rain\\", Crazy Horse's crunching music provides the perfect backdrop for Neil's lyrics which offer everyday images to bring attention to injustices being committed (ostensibly) in our name by individuals of power and influence. Perhaps the starkest song on the cd, \\"Bandit\\" quietly and elegantly expresses a certain desperation that comes at the end of one's rope, right before Earl finds the strength to go on.  The characters all seem to find that strength, even the widow of Officer Carmichael who was gunned down in \\"Leave the Driving\\" and Grandpa when he attempts to chase the reporters off his porch in \\"Grandpa's Interview\\".  Perhaps that's Neil's theme after all.<br />There are no likely hit songs on this album (though they are all catchy in a Crazy Horse way), no four-color posters, and no commercial sell-outs to the folks at Clear Communications (who also seem in the cross-hairs).  This is an album of powerful music, potent lyrics, and intelligent thoughts given expression through distorted and tough rock and roll.  The Bonus DVD of a solo acoustic show is a pleasant extra, if tangential to the CD content, and the little storybook that accompanies the set is charmingly incoherent.  Despite these perhaps-unnecessary extras, the album itself rises far above anything he's released in a long time (\\"Tonight's the Night\\" perhaps?) and certainly stands apart from most contemporary music releases.<br />This album is a must for Neil/Crazy Horse fans, a must for alternative/college music lovers, definitely the one to get for budding activists and aging boomers who remember Chicago '68, or even for rock fans who love a good story, but \\"Greendale\\" is probably not the best cd for someone looking for pop drivel, the grotesque, or just plain ol' beer-swilling tunes.

B0000646UN|1.0|I've seen many, many war movies over the years, and as much as I was looking forward to this one, The Winter War turned out to be one of the worst war films I've ever seen. This film does have two important things going for it: it's one of the only movies about this conflict that you're likely to see, and it features extensive and graphic big-budget combat scenes. The movie pulls no punches about the nastiness of war. <br />Unfortunately, this film has so many huge problems that it can only be recommended to extremely forgiving viewers with a particular interest in this conflict. First of all, the story is remarkably flimsy; it's really just a very loose framework on which to hang a bunch of numbingly repetitive battle scenes. Some grognards (fanatical war buffs, basically) rave about this movie because of its battle scenes. Sure, they're graphic and have lots of explosions, but when they're so poorly written, directed, and edited, who cares? Don't expect to find anything as masterly filmed or emotionally intense as the openings of Saving Private Ryan or Enemy at the Gates, for example. Meanwhile, characters, themes, and plot twists are never fleshed out or are simply nonexistent. <br />Just as bad, the directing and editing are literally some of the worst I've ever seen in a feature film: jerky or downright incoherent cuts between shots and scenes are more the norm than the exception. These affect not merely the combat scenes, but the whole film. The Winter War looks downright amateurish much of the time. (Other reviewers claim that much material has been deleted for this DVD release, and it sure looks that way!) Also, the acting is merely acceptable here, which makes it that much harder to care about any of the characters and whether they live or die. On top of that, the subtitles are poorly handled: they're littered with grammatical and spelling errors. Finally, the DVD transfer looks like it came from some third-generation video tape.<br />If you're looking fora modern, realistic WWII film on DVD, you'd do far better with the Band of Brothers miniseries, Saving Private Ryan, Das Boot, The Thin Red Line, Stalingrad, or Enemy at the Gates, for example. Those all feature far better writing, acting, direction, editing, and/or cinematography. Those are films that both grognards and film buffs can enjoy.<br />For those who just want to gawk at some early-war Soviet tanks and trench warfare, The Winter War might be of interest, but that sure doesn't make it a good film. Hopefully the film will be released properly some day, so we can judge the real thing instead of this mess of a movie.
B00005JKZV|5.0|After i saw this movie i have to say, wow. wat a great film. I loved the first one and i think this one is even better. The acting is incredible especially from Elijah Wood and Viggo Martensen. I think this movie should have won at least a couple Academy awards. This has got to be one of the best films of the year!!! If this movie is any indication, i believe The Return of the King will be AWSOME!!!!!!!
B000002KAT|5.0|This is not an album to put on while you are housecleaning, or just wanting background music. If you want that, go put on &quot;Moondance&quot;. This album demands your attention if you are going to get the full effect of it. If you give this album your undivided attention you will not be sorry. The music climbs all over you and takes you over. It's like divine inspiration. If God ever has anything to do with a recording process, he was definitely THERE at the studio the three days that were spent recording this. There's no other explanation as to how you could turn out a masterpiece in that short amount of time.
006092988X|1.0|I have never been as bored in my life as much as I was when I was forced to read \\"A Tree Grows In Brooklyn\\" during my Freshman year of High School. It was absolutley HORRIBLE. There basically is no plot, just some idiot girl rambling about this and that, her parents, the trees, the house, some stupid aunt of hers....
B000002J09|5.0|First off, what the hell is wrong with the reviews posted by &quot;Jimmy Jim Jim&quot; and &quot;A Music Fan.&quot;  True, Zeppelin IV is a bit overrated, but how could you EVER say that Slipknot or &quot;Modern Day&quot; Metallica is better than Zeppelin??!!!!  <br />Even though Zeppelin IV is overrated (Houses of the Holy is my favorite), it still gets 5 Stars because it puts so many other albums to shame.  Just remember, Zeppelin could make a horrible album, and it would still be better than the majority of modern day bands' best albums.
B00008WT49|5.0|Among all the praise, there are a few critical reviews about this production. In my opinion this is outstanding music combined with superb sound quality.

B00004Y7SF|1.0|OK, so all in all, this is a complete mockery of a Christmas CD.  Definitely NOT my first choice for holiday listening.  For pop fans, a safer choice would probably be *Nsync's \\"Home for Christmas\\".  <BR>The only reason I'm giving this CD 1 star is because the girl can SANG.  But that's about it.  She completely butchered some of my favorite classic Christmas songs (i.e. Angels We Have Heard On High, Merry Christmas, Baby , and Oh, Holy Night).  By the halfway point of the disc, I was wanting to yank her through my headphones and tell her to cut the vocal runs out completely.  A few here and there are one thing, but every line is too much.  She's a great vocalist, but she completely tears herself up on this one.  <BR>The shining moment is These Are the Special Times.  Though obviously oversung (the pattern set for the duration of the disc), I actually got a few chills in the first two minutes of the song.  It was decent.  She held off until the last minute or so to blow it to pieces, on a minor scale.<BR>Call me old fashioned, but I'd rather hear a good Christmas song sang straight without all the junk that's on this CD.  There's no reason to sound like somebody's jabbing you in the rear while your singing.  If you're looking for quality holiday music, pass this one up.  Don't waste the bucks.

0385335482|5.0|I was sooo addicted to the book just pages after I started.  Although I cannot ever think of spending that much money, I know how it is to procrastinate a little.  A great summer read!
B000002J09|5.0|This album is crazy... I'll take it song by song:<br />Black Dog: chaotic, catchy, and unbelievably complex, this song is one that you don't mind getting stuck in your head<br />Rock and Roll: an absolute classic beginning with the unmistakable snare intro, this simple but masterful piece is heard on Cadillac commercials these days<br />Battle of Evermore: a more eclectic turn (as can always be expected from Zeppelin), this tune is a mandolin-based parallel to the final battle sequence of The Return of the King (LOTR), with several spine-tingling climaxes<br />Stairway to Heaven: what must I say? It's the best song ever heard by human ears, topped off with the ultimate, nothing-short-of-perfect solo by none other than the Pagemaster himself. Seriously - this song is the real deal. I recommend only listening to it when you have the time for the full 8:00.<br />Misty Mountain Hop: definitely not \\"cooked-up\\" in two minutes.., this song is probably the closest Zeppelin ever got to pop music. It's catchy, surprisingly complex to play, and also another LOTR parallel, this time from the beginning of The Hobbit.<br />Four Sticks: a personal favorite of mine, this song is most likely inspired by Zeppelin's frequent treks around the English country side. Watch for the cool synth part, and the absolute genius whail put out by Plant after the final chorus. You'll know it because it sounds so ridiculously cool.<br />Going to California: a Zeppelin staple acoustic set, this is the softest moment of the album. Though quiet and simple, this song always seems to leave an impression.<br />When the Levee Breaks: a bold and stark song that seems to be one of the best examples of the huge sound Page was able to create by placing mics farther away from his guitar than was custom. Watch for the \\"Don't it make you feel bad...\\" portion, being the only record of Plant singing in a yelling/aggressive manner. A sweet song, altogether. <br />This is the finest album ever recorded, by the finestband, including the finest guitarist, of any genre. Buy it (and don't burn it, for crying out loud).
B00007JMCX|5.0|It's a shame that only 5 stars can be given to this classic film.<BR>David Bowie, whom I adore anyway, makes an excellent debut in this superb film.<br />The film follows Walter Tevis's novel very well and adapts to the screen to create a very saddening tale of corporate America and how it can be a boon or a bust to some, including aliens.<br />That alone is a scary thought.<br />Upon his arrival from a dying planet, Thomas Jerome Newton sets out to create an empire to obtain money to purchase water for his dying planet.  Occasional scenes are shown of him leaving his wife and children behind, and throughout the film we see other scenes of them waiting for his return.<br />What is never shown is how he is going to transport this to his home planet.<br />Along the way to his path to success, he is plagued by metaphorical leeches who will do anything to stop him. Greed, lust, and several other deadly sins are thrust upon our protaganist as he tries in vain to overcome them in the process.<br />David Bowie was the perfect person to be cast for this movie.  He moves along in it with an icy perfection that is or was appropriate to his character at the time.<br />Keep in mind, this film is not without it's flaws.  Some scenes were restored to make this the original theatrical release.  One involving Rip Torn and his student could have been done without as  it makes no sense and attributes nothing to the overall affect of the movie.  Again, that is just an opinion, and die hard fans of this movie will be happy that it is included.<br />This film, upon it's release, was well ahead of its time and to this day, many of the themes implied still are appropiate to what constitutes success vs. failure in the American business sense.<br />The films ends on a saddening note, however, and should be a reminder that what goes around, comes around.  You do not have to be a fan of David Bowie to appreciate this film, he just makes it all work and the end result is stunning.  Nicholas Roeg did everything possible to steer away from the persona of David Bowie and his music.  The end result is a very good solid acting part on his behalf.  Ironically, some of the incidental music later became working pieces on David Bowie's LOW album, which has a stunning shot from the movie.  Highly recommended, and not for anyone looking for a quick plot or storyline and a happy ending, this film is chock full of storylines and plots that keeps you interested throughtout it's prescence.
B000007T1M|5.0|This album did have a huge impact upon my life.  When I first got this masterpiece, (Yes, I called it a masterpiece, and I will stand back and defend what I said by all means) I was having some serious trouble at school, with anger, emotions boiling, nerves worrying; my Freshman year, of course.  This album helped me get out lots of anger, believe it or not; more so than Metallica's Master of Puppets, even, that's how strong this record really is.  Now, many people have tried to lump SOAD in the Nu/Neo-Metal category that often is labeled on almost every single band that comes out nowadays.  Part of that reason is because most bands that are out do indeed carry that Nu-Metal status willingly, and it's a very unfortunate slump that the Metal industry finds itself in as of currently.  Metallica mellowed out.  Slayer's still going strong, but they can't bear the entire genre on their shoulders without collapsing, can they?  Megadeth did the same thing as Metallica, changing their style, sound, and even persona, so to speak.  There's hundreds (Dare I say thousands?) of Death Metal bands out there, but they stay underground, therefore making their good records hard to find.  There's lots of genres that metal has.   ............ <BR> This has guitar solos!  Do any of the so called 'Metal' bands out there today do solos?  Go ahead, think in your mind of all the new bands out there, try and figure out which one of them actually do solos that aren't mediocre?  Limp Bizkit?  Get real.  Korn?  You must be insane.  Even Metallica doesn't do solos any more...<BR>     Buy this masterpiece right now.  That's all I can say, and I hope it gave you as much entertainment as it did me.  Put it on a CD player, kick back, rock out.  I would love to see these guys in concert...
B00005QG9J|5.0|This was one of the best cd's that I have ever bought! It is really good and well written. You can appriciate all the songs on this cd. It is a cd that you can listen to in the shower,  in the car and fall asleep to. Buy it...You will really be glad in this investment.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|Love this CD. Every track is different and exciting. Stevie Nicks is at her very best staying in top form moving the listener to bring vivid pictures to mind. Lindsey Buckingham is overall fresh and bold in his presentation of lyrics, harmony, and arrangement. It is a harmonious blend of their new recording work with a familiarity of the old gypsy sound from the past. Perfect listening for just about any mood you're in.
1587990717|1.0|Sometimes it serves no purpose to look at the rating of the book (4 average stars), it is as misleading as the closing price in terms of understanding future profitability. The book full of hackneyed examples and anecdotes culled (maybe plagiarized) from better pop-science books. Berstein's Against the Gods is more entertaining, J Allen Paulos is more original, and R. Dawkins is far more erudite.<BR>In his book Dr. Taleb makes much of his love of books, and his foreign (non-US) education. Yet Taleb's book was published by some no-name (vanity?) publisher, Texere, which apparently does not have enough money to hire an editor, nor even a simple fact-checker. Perhaps the brilliant Dr. Taleb don't need no friggin' fact-checker? Well...Barnes & Noble is on 18th street, not 21st street. This might seem like a small detail, but Taleb's book uses that mistake as a chapter sub-heading and it is just a simple example of sloppy editing. I will not even start on the lack of style and wit throughout the book.<BR>Of course, I did not expect any heavy math in this book, I have enough of that in my day job (insurance), but I did expect something more than this limp treatment of statistical reasoning in business life. But one should bear in mind that Taleb is simply a (Phoenician) trader who believes he has something interesting to say simply because he has an above-average income. He is fooled by skewness.
B000001F29|5.0|We are only allowed 1,000 words to review items, which is a shame as this album surely would exceed that in one review.<br />In short this is a masterpiece, coupling the talents of Jon Anderson and Vangelis has never been a bad idea.  His haunting voice and lyrics literally transcend over the gorgeous melodies and keyboards that Vangelis is so well known for.  <br />Oddly upon it's release, this album did not garner much favour across the pond in the USA.  However, time told, and finally the CD was put out.  I own three.  <br />The best on this is probably State of Independence which is over 7 minutes long on the cd issue, and could very well have been longer  as the song is a very catchy, almost jazzy, piece.<br />Anyone who has an ear for Vangelis at all should get this just for the fact that it's him and this explores new territory as far as his use of keyboards is concerned.  I can say this, this album has not aged on bit.  First time listeners will be highly impressed.  I know I was.

B00005JLK1|4.0|A lot of horror fans don't think too highly of this film, but I quite enjoyed my time on the Ghost Ship.  Maybe there's nothing too original or ground-breaking about the type of horror it has to offer, but that doesn't mean it's not effective and entertaining.  Certainly, believability is a weakness in a few spots, and I'm still trying to figure out how a couple of \\"facts\\" could have been even remotely possible, but the film does create an eerie atmosphere and doesn't mind spilling a little blood in pursuit of its ends.<br />I think I can safely say that the opening scene of the movie is rather unforgettable, and I greatly admire the effect the moviemakers were going for here.  Rarely does a movie purport to take out untold scores of people with one swift blow, and it is most unfortunate that a lack of commitment to this potentially extraordinary scene sets in motion the very doubts and misgivings some viewers have of the real meat of the story.  The method of mass execution used in this first scene is pretty hard to accept scientifically, but the real problem comes in the form of some very obvious mannequins lying among the \\"dead.\\"  The filmmakers try to salvage the scene by having the victims take a few moments to figure out that they are quite dead, and that works for me; unfortunately, they take this too far and end up making what should be a glorious bloodbath look a little silly.<br />The real story here concerns the crew of a salvage boat hired to salvage a mysterious old ship that a pilot claims to have spotted in the Bering Sea.  What they find is an Italian ocean liner missing for forty years, but the great riches they discover onboard lead not to the paradise on earth they fantasize about but rather its exact opposite.  Trapped on board the dead vessel, each crew member must fight to stay alive and sane in an environment which quickly shows itself to be quite haunted indeed.  The fates of a few are rather hokey and predictable, but the storyline around one little girl ghost saves the movie in my opinion.  Only Maureen Epps (Julianna Margulies) can see little Katie (played quite effectively by Emily Browning), who eventually tells her the story of what happened forty years ago.  This little girl, a pure-hearted ghost trapped on a ship full of malevolent spirits, certainly does her share to give the movie the creepy aura it needs.  The major flashback we see through the eyes of Katie, though, is just plain weird.  As we are transported back forty years in time, we are suddenly bombarded by some type of hard-driving, neo-tech electronic music that seems wholly out of place.<br />I'm not saying Ghost Ship does not have its faults and weaknesses, but in my opinion it made for an entertaining albeit rather predictable little horror movie.  Some people seem to hate the ending, but I had no problem with it whatsoever; I think it worked quite well in the context of everything I had just seen.  I would not call Ghost Ship a must-see horror film by any means, nor do I personally consider it all that gory, but I do think it has enough chills and thrills to satisfy or at least entertain many a horror fan out there.one little girl ghost saves the movie in my opinion.

B00005KHJR|5.0|Few movies from England, with the exception of Hammer Films, have had any profound affect in the United States, especially in the horror genre.  This film, however, in spite of its age, (released in 1974 in a shorter version than filmed) is one of the exceptions.<br />Filmed on location in Scotland, this startling tale begins as an innocent romp through a Celtic forum and quickly proceeds to some startling practices and beliefs in Celtic themes.<br />A police officer has been notified of a child who has gone missing on Summerisle.  He proceeds to investigate this and is given the slip on several occasions, which prompts him to believe there is a   <BR>conspiracy surrounding this event.  Much to his disbelief, there is.<br />After witnessing several bizarre events himself, he believes that this missing child may be a part of a pagan sect which will ensure that the coming harvest will be prosperous.  <br />Beautiful photography, music and scenery only enhance this somewhat murder mystery.  The ending is only for those who need to see it as it is not what anyone expects at all.  Pay attention, however, and you MAY figure it out!  Highly recommended viewing, some brief nudity and sexual overtones gave this an R rating and is not recommended for the younger audience.  For further pleasure, I suggest the soundtrack as well as it is full of gorgeous Celtic themes, which also attribute to the overall affect of this film.
B00005JKZV|4.0|Any LOTR fan who has read the book and expected the movie to be a near seamless adaptaion of the book is extremely heartbroken as am I.  Everyone who has given it a negative rating knows this, but it is kind of unfair to do that to the movie.  The movie was indeed an excellent movie.  Despite the fact that I want to personally remove Peter Jacksons genetilia and digest them and feed him my excrements.  <BR>     The movie was excellent.  Once I forced myself to forget that I had read the book I realized the movie was still very good.  Although I refused to forgive pj's for sacriglegiously marring the charecter of Faramir.  I'm praying this Aussie schvatza doesn't do the same to the ROTK.  All fans of the book know to hate the director.  But, don't hate the movie.  The movie has excellent musical score, unprecendented scenery and prop use, and extraordinary charecter development.  There's nothing more you can ask for in a good movie.  Just, if you need to vent, send pj's a bomb.
B00003CXIP|5.0|I only found out about this movie when my mum recommended it too me and I bought it at the begining of July. And all through the summer holidays I couldn't stop watching it. <BR>'Stand By Me' was based on the novella 'The Body' by Stephen King in the book collection 'Different Seasons'. And what is unusual about 'Stand by Me' is that Stephen King liked it, beause he doesn't often like adaptations of his work. But I don't see how anyone could not like this film.<BR>The story is set in the late 1950's and is about four boys who go on a two day journey in Oregon to find the body of a kid who recently went missing.  Along the way they discover about the world, that you have to stand up to it however hard that is, and only you can decide what you do with your future, and find their friendship, and it reaches out to one another when they are in trouble. And by the end of the movie they have all grown up in their own special way.<BR>The main stars are: Wil Wheaton, as the ignored-by-his-parents boy Gordon Lachance, Corey Feldman, is Teddy Duchamp whose father is a mad war hero and Jerry O'Connell (Screen debute) as the scared, fat kid Vern Tessio. But for me the best actor of the four was River Phoenix (RIP) who played the guy from a bad family with a good heart. He really shined as this chracter and his acting was truly amazing. And it is a real tragedy that he died so young. <BR>Other actors who starred were: Kiefer Sutherland, very good as the town bully. John Cusack, who had a couple of cameos as Gordie's deceased borther, and Richard Dreyfuss as the writer/ elder Gordie, he mostly narrated but his voice fit the movie perfectly. <BR>The direction of the movie by Rob Reiner was amazing, he had many scenes only done in one take, and this adds to the beauty of the movie. My favourite scene in the movie is the milk money scene and it is also Rob Reiner's as the acting from River Phoeix was beautiful and I'm sure I wasn't the only person who was crying during it, and most of the scene was taken from the book. <BR>The soundtrack to the movie was very beatuiful, with many songs from the 50's, but especially the theme song 'Stand By Me' by Ben E.King. <BR>The extras on the DVD were brilliant with interviews from the stars and director Rob Reiner and Stephen King. Also with a montage tribute to River Phoenix. Commentary by Rob Reiner, with little bits of extra information, filmography on the stars, trailers, isolated music score and production notes. But my favourite was the music video 'Stand by Me' in which River Phoenix and Wil Wheaton had cameos. <BR>This movie is very coming-of-age and a brillint film for any age, note to parents the only reaosn it has a high age rating is because of swearing, but don't let it put you off. It is a wonderful film, that deserves every bit of praise it gets. <BR>I recomend this movie to everyone, if you buy it I promise you, you won't be disappointed.
0385509456|5.0|This book uses the voice of Christopher to tell the story of an investigation that eventually  opens the door to finding out the truth about his own family.  Christopher is an individual with high functioning autism and that leads to a unique viewppoint where emotions do not come into play for the main character. However, he uses his own brand of logic to deal wih the world.<br />I read the book in one day, not because it is a short book but because I could not put it down.  It is an adventure with someone with a different voice.  Amusing, sad, this book is a delight. If you don't know anything about indviduals with high functioning autism, you can get more insight from this novel than from texts and articles dealing with the subject. If you have had experience with autism before, there are many opportunities to identify with Christopher and his parents.  A beautiful book and a great read for people tired of detective novels with themes and books dealing with groups of angst filled women.
B000001F5A|5.0|Vangelis has produced a huge body of work.  Some of it to this day still exceeds quality and production...this being one of them.<br />Written for a documentary film, this music truly fills the void in any gaps that the film may have had.  In short, it perfectly fits the white icy world which the film may or may not have intended.<br />The opening track sounds a bit ominous as we can almost envision a swirling snowstorm in the Antarctic.  The rest is just pure gravy.<BR>Truly a masterpiece, this is one piece of work that every Vangelis fan should enjoy.  Originally only issued in Japan (a copy which I procured through pain staking efforts) this gem is now widely available and I suggest to any listerner to get this while it's out there.  You will not be disappointed.
B00004Z400|3.0|This CD is okay. I like about half the songs on here. I mean, they are good, but I'm extremely disappointed after having this CD recommended as 'the best deftones CD'. I have to say that I researched it, and when I saw the video for 'Back to School', I thought, 'Wow, this is gonna be good, hard rock.' Nope. Not really. Not nearly as much screaming as I wanted, no really catchy riffs that I noticed, and the lyrics are just too damn creepy. I don't mind weird, as I've heard all of Around the Fur, but there's fine line between oddly melodic and freakishly weird, and for a lot of the songs on here, deftones leaps over it. It is pretty good, though, but listen to all the songs on their website (they let you listen to the whole album), and then decide if it's worth your money. I love passenger, feticetera, and back to school, and some of the parts on the other songs I like, so that's what gave it the three stars.
B00008EY5W|4.0|I despised Starship Troopers when it first came out. I thought it was adolescent, ultra-violent, proto-fascist garbage. Boy, was I wrong. Yes, it's packed with gore and at first glance it could be misconstrued as a celebration of Nazi-style militarism. But here's a news bulletin: IT'S SATIRE, PEOPLE! I swear, Paul Verhoven is a freakin' genius. This is not your run-of-the-mill School of Saturday Night Live broad satire. This is a bit more subtle than that. It also happens to be a kickass sci-fi action blockbuster. It's great storytelling, with a wry, well-crafted screenplay. It's a fully realized world within itself. And never let it be said that Mr. Verhoven doesn't know how to cast the hotties.<br />Some people have complained that there is precious little science in this science fiction rollercoaster. They're right. Verhoven has thrown logic and science right out the window. But that's OK--he wasn't trying for the \\"2001: A Space Odyssey, There's No Sound in Outer Space Award\\". But if you can check your Inner Physicist at the door and just enjoy the ride, this movie is a blast. Technically, the CGI special effects were state-of-the-art in 1997 and they still look great, especially in Superbit. So donate your copies of Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones to the Goodwill. They're tedious [stuff]. Buy this movie--it's one fun flick.
B000001DTM|5.0|U2's popularity at the time at which they released &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; was at a highpoint, and then they did something unexpected: they totally changed the sonic landscape of their music, trading in a guitars/bass/drums/vocals sound that had become justly celebrated for an electronica-inspired fusion of hard rock and ambient sound.  They would eventually take that sound even further (witness &quot;Pop&quot; and &quot;Passengers&quot;), but never with as much controversy as on &quot;Achtung Baby.&quot;  Many of their most ardent fans abandoned them, feeling that they had gone off the deep end.<br />What U2 did not change one iota with this album was their emphasis on emotionality in their music.  As a result, they ended up with what was their finest album to date.  U2 has never been better than they are on &quot;One,&quot; and the dark emotion of that song is a mere prelude to the content of songs such as &quot;Ultraviolet,&quot; &quot;So Cruel,&quot; &quot;Acrobat,&quot; and &quot;Love Is Blindness.&quot;  Also, since U2 is a rock band, there are several songs that, well, rock: &quot;Even Better Than the Real Thing,&quot; &quot;Mysterious Ways,&quot; &quot;Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses,&quot; and &quot;The Fly.&quot;<br />This is a landmark of an album, one that should be bought and listened to by anyone who loves rock and roll.
0385504209|5.0|One of the few books in years past that I was completely unable to put down. Dan Brown does an admirable job of describing a world of secret societies and sects that relatively few people have heard about or know of their purpose. Taking these true elements, he creates a thriller mystery that is believable and engrossing. So well done that when I finished the book I spent the next two hours researching Da Vinci, the Priory and Opus Dei!
B000068PQ0|5.0|I'm a HUGE Rock fan, and I usually listen to really fast paced music, but this album is so beautifully written. How could anyone pass it up? I feel like I'm going into a dream world whenever I listen to it. This is just a terrific album. I can't even describe it.
0767817664|5.0|Who would've thought that Roddy McDowall &amp; Chris Sarandon would give two of the best performances in horror history?  They most certainly do.  There's no shortage of suspense, action and unrelenting horror in &quot;Fright Night.&quot;  Let's not forget carefully time-released comedy, either.  This DVD was just screaming for commentaries.  At this low price, we'll settle for the spooky trailer and awesome digital film transfer, which still looks great on 16:9 widescreen sets.  A must-have, turn out the lights, pop some popcorn screamfest!
B00006JJ1O|1.0|I cannot believe the amount of good reviews about an album like this. I thought it appealed only to dirty old men and teenagers. In both cases not for its musical merits. <BR>And about music. Not that bad, particularly if you are a Trevor Horn fan or a fan of clubbing and dance beats. But let's be honest - musically it is a 100 per cent Horn's creation.<BR>Lyrics are simply awful, as they are awful and adolescent in Russian as well. Depth of a 15 year old. Oh, I forgot, they WERE 15 when these songs were made. But then again, they are not their own lyrics. Vocals - some of the most annoying female vocals I have ever encountered. Talantless sqeeking, which at some point may physically become unbearable to listen. Be warned.<BR>Overall, some of the interesting stuff that Trevor Horn has created musically (interesting as in &quot;for the purposes of dancing&quot;) is not worth the torture of hearing those voices and , Gog forbid, seeing them. For those of you less familiar with the genre, it IS typical Russian bubblegum pop, but if someone sees more depth into this, so be it. Be happy. O stars, really.
B00006L83N|5.0|OK, where do I begin? Uh, well, if you're a guitarist, and love killer shredd, than get this album! Because Michael Romeo can shredd with the best of them. If you love incredible musicianship, and awesome lyrics, than, get this album! If you love epic-sounding-choruses, then get this album! basically, if you're a metalhead, and love talent, get this album!
B00007BH3Y|5.0|Hypnotic, Haunting, SUPERB! perhaps better than the film-if that's possible. Highly recommended. Should have won The Academy Award for best score!
B00005JLSE|3.0|'Chicago' was probably a great stage musical. On-screen the plot is too flimsy, the dialogue and action too campy even for one who usually loves camp, i.e. me. Dancing was fine, the direction & effects were truly impressive, singing was good, songs were good. But no more than good. Not great. And after seeing it, I had no desire to ever see it again or to hum any of the songs. It was imminently forgettable. This film seems to be more about showcasing the hidden musical/dancing talents of actors known solely for acting than about a plausible story. The wit is superficial at best, and the moral of the story is a real yawner (if you even think there is one). If this is supposed to be the movie that brings back musicals, I think I'll just rerun some of the old classics instead. I dunno, I always think the Oscar winner for best picture should be one that will stand the test of time, e.g. Casablanca, The Sting, etc. I really don't think this movie can do that. All that aside, kudos to the one real singing talent I did see: Queen Latifah's acting may have been a trifle wooden but on stage she stole the entire movie with the one song she had. That was the only memorable scene IMHO. Otherwise, a very mediocre movie. I gave the DVD away the day after I watched it.
B000002MUW|2.0|Highlights here include the seductive \\"Forbidden Love,\\" which puts the listener in a hypnotic trance. An uncensored \\"Human Nature\\" tells the listener to follow their own rules, and not those of a control freak. \\"Survival\\" gives the same message in a more upbeat way. Unfortunately, these 3 tracks sound similar, and it causes them to stand out less on the album. They also fall flat in comparison to Madonna's spunky 80's pop, or outstanding 90's ballads.<br />\\"Take A Bow,\\" the sugar sweet duet with Babyface, is Madonna's biggest hit to date, and not without reason. \\"Secret\\" is a good track, but comes across as an Erotica throwaway that pales in comparison with that album's other tracks.<br />\\"Bedtime Stories\\" marks the album's last good track. It's a shame that it sounds rather lifeless & mechanical. It was also a sign of the type of music that would take over the rest of her career, and cause her albums to be exempt from the charts & thrown in discount bins everywhere.<br />The GHV2 & Something To Remember albums would be more practical to buy than this or the other 3 albums that came after it.
B00005JLSE|5.0|At last, the Oscar's came to their senses and picked the actual<BR>best picture of the year.   Chicago is a treasure to be<BR>cherished for years to come.  Rob Marshall (who should have won<BR>this year's best director award)has triumphantly brought back the<BR>American musical in top form.   This is the best example in<BR>years of director, cast, and production team all coming together<BR>to create something special which is what fine moviegoing is all<BR>about.   The pairing of Catherine Zeta-Jones and Renee Zellweger<BR>as Roxie Hart and Velma Kelley is sensational.   Jones is<BR>her sexy and sultry best as the explosive Velma.  Her All That<BR>Jazz and I Can't Do It Alone numbers show off what a great<BR>belter and dancer this former London West End star is.  She<BR>doesn't just perform in this film, she tears up the screen<BR>with sexiness and a passion not seen since Barbra Streisand<BR>in her heigh day.  Her Best Supporting Oscar was most certainly<BR>deserved for her terrific work.  After last years' funny<BR>and touching Bridget Jones, Zellweger continues to impress<BR>with as Roxie Hart.  Her charm makes the shrewd Roxie<BR>more appealing to the audience and she hits the mark as a musical<BR>performer especially in her Roxie and Nowadays number. There was<BR>some doubt about the choice of Richard Gere as Billy Flynn,<BR>but Gere's proves the speculators wrong with a fine performance<BR>showing off his flashy side singing and tap dancing splendidly.<BR>Queen Latifah turns in her best screen performance as Mama and<BR>John C Reiley delivers a powerful and touching Mr. Cellophane<BR>like a true Broadway trouper.  A nice addition to the DVD<BR>is the deleted number Class which is a lovely song.  Marshall's<BR>idea to keep most of the musical numbers as Roxie's fantasies<BR>is good because it allows the film to switch from dialog to <BR>song and dance at a swift and believable pace that compliments<BR>the constraints of a film compared to the more vaudville style of<BR>the stage musical. I am so impressed with this movie because<BR>it gives audiences something that hasn't been seen in a long<BR>time, popular filmmaking at its best
6305079811|3.0|I saw this in the movies and it was not what I was expecting.  It made Adam West's portrayal of Batman look Shakesperian, frankly.  I thought this was going to be a *straight* sci-fi movie and I wish it had been.  I think this movie, altho it has alot of fans for what it is, just missed.<br />Max von Sydow makes a very good evil-doer despite the silly script and rediculous sets.  Topol as the hapless scientist that sets the movie into motion looks ....embarrassed thru most of the movie.  I'd be too.  Sam J Jones looks vacuous.  Melody Anderson seems strangly miscast, altho its very hard to tell and wears an odd polyester suit.  Ornella Muti as Ming's daughter just sparkles and seems to rise above the rediculous movie.  She was and is still a star in Italy.  This was to be her break out United States movie.  She should have picked another one.<br />The sets are over the top.  The costumes are over the top. Most of the acting is painfully over the top.<br />  I can see there is some appeal for this as a cult classic...and for that I can understand it.  For someone who goes and expects to see a typical Sci-fi you will be dissapointed.
B000063TDY|5.0|this is an OUTSTANDING follow up the Destiny release of 1988 (which was a much better release than critics reported). there are some real classic hard rock gems on this CD. if you are a Saxon fan or are thinking about becoming one, i highly recommend getting this. an excellent, EXCELLENT group of songs. the remastered work is top notch. my highest allocades to the band.
B0000DCGT0|4.0|You will be transported to an earlier time. It is sad to say many in our day and time is clueless as to what it would be like to be willing to do ANY job just to survive. The Great Depression affects most people in that one day they were good upstanding people and the next day they are riding in rail cars, or giving their children away in hopes that they will have better prospects than they themselves.<br /><br />Seabiscuit is the story of four broken individuals, A business man with a hole in his heart, a horseman who has no way to ply his trade, and a young man who found himself as a pick up boxer (unsuccessful), a jockey who can quote Shakespeare to his fellow jockey, and a broken and abused throwaway horse that was but a moment away from a bullet in the head. The country had been ravaged by hard times and needed to have a down and outer to become an up and comer; they needed a reason to cheer. Seabiscuit gave them a reason.<br /><br />This movie is about these four individuals finding wholeness again. It is a movie that reminds us that to get back up again is honorable and even feasible provided you believe in yourself even if others do not. Seabiscuit is beautifully filmed and well acted. Jeff Bridges, Toby McGuire and Chris Cooper are perfect for their roles.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and see this wonderful film -- watch it on those days when you need a reason to cheer.
0385504209|2.0|The ending of this book left me so disappointed and frustrated. What a cop out! The book was brilliant, had me enthralled the whole way through, but to follow a journey to unearth something for 450 pages, sharing the vicarious thrill of each new discovery leading to the location of that something, and then at the very end, to neatly avoid any kind of revelation with a touchy-feely 'Oh, actually, it's better if people DON'T learn the truth--it's better if we DON'T unearth this amazing historical, groundbreaking treasure we've been searching for because people are probably happier not knowing.' HUH???<br />Talk about the coward's way out--both for the author AND the protagonist. I really could not believe the author did that to the reader...then again, it makes sense if what's on his mind is just cranking out sequels about this character. In other words, if the Da Vinci Code had actually followed through with its groundbreaking discovery, the world and the church would be a different place than it is now, and maybe Dan Brown is not comfortable trying to write sequels in a setting that seems abstract to him. But all I thought at the end of this book was that I had been strung along for NOTHING--and furthermore, I will not put myself through it again with Angels &amp; Demons, which is going right back to the store!
B00005JM09|4.0|I didn't know whether or not this movie would be good, but I went to see it out of loyalty to the Terminator franchise.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Bringing back Skynet via government research, despite the destruction of Cyberdyne, was actually quite clever - it emphasizes the theory that every event carries infinite different outcomes, and just because Cyberdyne was destroyed does not necessarily rule out the possibility that Skynet will arise by other means.  It may seem like a cheesy plot trick to many, but in actuality it is well-rooted in currently existing theories about temporal mechanics.  Also, the T-X was quite good - not just in physical appearance.  The character was well-played and definitely lived up to Robert Patrick's T-1000 from T2.  Some people have expressed discontent over the label \\"Terminatrix\\", but I want to emphasize that the T-X was never officially identified as the Terminatrix by Skynet or by Arnold Schwarzenegger's character.  It is a label created by John Connor, who was at least partially sarcastic in calling the T-X a Terminatrix.  The official designation of the T-X is T-X; the X can stand for a number of things - experimental; some sort of new labelling system; or X as in the X chromosome, indicating that the T-X adopts a female appearance.  The end of the movie is an interesting and intriguing twist as well - I definitely recommend it to everyone, especially those who didn't quite feel like there was complete closure at the end of T2.
B000092Q4U|5.0|I really enjoyed this album although it is very different then New American Gospel which i also loved. The drumming is even better then on New American Gospel and the vocals are also quite different, being more coherent and such. This album is often very catchy and makes you wanna headbang along with it, if you've heard 11th Hour you know what I mean. Ruin is also one of my favorite tracks. This cd rules.
6305546789|5.0|I love this movie so much and have seen it so many times i can't even count.  I am happy so many other people love this movie too, but in the previous review, made by James D. Murphy, he made two mistakes in his movie summary.  First, he said that Micheal is sent to the hospital for life, that is not true.  Micheal is sent to the hospital only until his 21 birthday so that they may try him as an adult for his sisters death.  Secondly, his sister Laurie did not change her name, instead she was adopted because she was only a baby when micheal killed his other sister.  I just wanted to make sure everyone knew the straight facts.  I hope you may find this interview sum what helpful in understanding the movie.
B000002U9W|5.0|This album at the very least has a lot more to offer to the world of music than 98% of what comes out these days. Alan's psychadelic breakfast is definitely a drug reference.
B000002WU9|5.0|Although he is arguably the best story-teller in the highly seminal and gargantuan rap collective, The Wu Tang Clan, and perhaps the entire hip-hop industry, Raekwon the Chef is rarely regarded as a rap legend. A couple listens, and \\"Cuban Linx\\" should prove to any skeptics that Rae is all talent, no hype. Backed by a thick soundscape courtesy of master beatsmith RZA, Rae delivers heartbreaking tales of wealthy hustling kingpins being murdered by stick-up kids, hustlers rising through the ranks of the underworld and entering the realms of high-stakes drug dealing, and the desperation of young black males that leads them towards criminal lifestyles. He does all of this with eery emotional detachment, a been-there-done that attitude, and a novelist's eye for detail. Rae is accompanied by a slew of members from the Wu Tang Clan, most notably Ghostface Killah featured on most of the songs, whose often tongue-and-cheek rhyme style plays off perfectly to Rae's unflinching seriousness. Ghost's presence never prevents Rae from shining, and the audience still knows who the album belongs to. Although Raekwon proves himself to be a master at his craft, the album would still be nothing without the consistently fascinating sounds churned out by RZA, who employs sound clips from John Woo's film \\"The Killer,\\" and De Palma's gangster classic \\"Scarface.\\" The beats do almost as much as Rae's lyrical vision, to reinvent the Wu Tang Clan as a righteous mafia family. \\"Cuban Linx\\" is arguably the greatest concept album in hip-hop, with a cold, grimy atmosphere that vividly conjures images of an icy New York winter. After listening to the album, it is easy to see how Rae's style of vivid high-stakes drug deal storytelling has influenced many New York rappers since he was first heard rapping on \\"Enter the Wu Tang,\\" although he does address this with some anger on the skit \\"Shark Niggas [Biters].\\" Some highlights on this flawless album include the heartbreaking \\"Knowledge God,\\" the highly detailed \\"Incarcerated Scarfaces,\\" the excellent remix of \\"Can it Be So Simple,\\" the chilling introspection on \\"Rainy Dayz,\\" the posse cut \\"Wu Gambinos,\\" and of course, Rae's testament to his love of a good woman, \\"Ice Cream. In the end, Raekwon's 1995 classic will never truly get the credit it deserves from American hip hop fans, but nonetheless it remains an essential to any fan of true-school hardcore rap. Pick it up.
0385504209|5.0|This is the first book by Dan Brown that I have read, and I was really impressed with the research he did on numerous topics to make his book a page turner.<br />I will do my own research on The Priory of Sion, Opus Dei, and the alleged marriage of Christ and Mary Magdalene.  I am a catholic and have had my doubts about the religious teachings I received as a child, so reading Dan Brown's opinion does not necessarily sway me from mine.  It just makes me want to know more about what the church forbade me to read when I was in elementary school, high school and college.<br />  But, I ask this question:  What is truth?  &quot;A man convinced against his will is of the same opinion still&quot;... sorry but I don't remember where I read this missive.  Anyway, this book is fiction with a lot of factual information used to provoke the reader's mind to thought.<br />  So what if there are contradictions, and inaccuracies?  Dan Brown has written an amazing detective story that is thrilling and instructive at the same time.  He has my vote.
B0000039PW|5.0|Wanna know how to create a rap album that will achieve classic status on the streets and on the charts? Look no further than the Notorious B.I.G.'s 1994 classic \\"Ready to Die.\\" The album is backed by amazing beats, contains party anthems for the MTV crowd, lyrical depth, introspection, ghetto storytelling/analysis unequaled elsewhere. \\"Ready to Die\\" is undoubtedly a pop music phonomenon. Although many will argue that Biggie peaked on his sophomore effort, in my opinion, that album isn't nearly as raw, honest, and powerful as his debut. The album's first track \\"Things Done Changed\\" (intro excluded) establishes the environment Biggie is going to take the audience to--Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn. Biggie's world is a violent one, and he knows it, making him constantly wary and fearful of jealous traitors and oppressive cops or anyone \\"trying to drop my decimals.\\" On \\"Gimme the Loot,\\" Big Poppa displays the Darwinist dog-eat-dog mentality he needs to maintain for survival. He's honest and even funny about it despite its heavy social implications. In \\"Warning,\\" Biggie fills a couple of foolish would-be-assassins with bullets, and later on \\"Everyday Struggle,\\" Biggie details the stressful flipside of the criminal lifestyle. What eventually makes this album special is that where most rappers would wallow in a morose state of frustration Biggie is still irresistably smooth, clever, funny, charming, and even upbeat. Biggie is a nasty ghetto teddybear, with a violent temper and cold calculating business sensibilities. Even though much of the album deals with heavy subject matter, Biggie still knows how to get his party on, and establishes the Big Poppa playa persona on \\"Big Poppa,\\" and \\"One More Chance.\\" And \\"Juicy\\" is still the quintessential underdog anthem. If party anthems and tales of slum-life aren't your thing, there's still a lot of good old-fashioned rhyme spitting on the hardcore banger \\"Machine Gun Funk,\\" and the amazing collabo with Method Man, \\"The What.\\" While the album contains diverse moods and subject matter, it is marked by Biggie's serious foreboding and paranoia (he can't even trust the women he parties with). It seems as if he knows that the inevitable result of his lifestyle is either incarceration or more likely, death. A stunning album of epic proportions. Biggie doesn't sacrafice any of his hardcore edge for commercial success, as he did, in my opinion, on his second effort. The album is a brutally honest tale of a hustler's troubled ascent to superstardom brimming with paranoia and regret, yet strangely uplifting. A hip hop landmark, and musical miracle, pick it up.
B00008IXAR|5.0|\\"Home\\" is one of those albums that will resonate well 20 years from now. What is more important is that it resonates equally strong right now. <BR>Being the fine craftsmen that Mike and the gang are perfecting the ideal pop songs, \\"Home\\" has several examples of this. From the title track to the likely hit \\"Fake\\" to the already smash success \\"Sunrise\\", the album plays like a bedtime story that you can listen to anytime during the day or night. <BR>\\"Sunrise\\" proved Simply Red could update their sound and style to the likes of the modern stars and beat them at their own game! It's no wonder that the song is the opening cut for the twentysomething film \\"It Was Always Me\\" coming out this fall. A must buy for music lovers!
B00009ATIX|3.0|I just watched this sci-fi film last night and felt lost when it ended. The film was well done the acting was good the movie is beautiful to look at and the production value is sky high I just felt that I missed the whole reason I was watching this film.<BR>I will have to watch it with commentery to see what everything was meaning near the end I just dont know if I can sit though it again. Rent before you buy is my advice.
0780619587|5.0|All I can say is, everything you want in a dramtic film is here. The realism of overcoming harsh abuse by an over protective father and the quest to play Rachmaninoff's Concerto No.3 lends itself to a first class dramatic piece of work.The music is excellent and I can't say enough about Geoffrey Rush's performance as the true David Helfgott is unforgettable.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I have been a Christina fan from the very beginning, infact, even before her self-titled first CD hit the stores when her hit Reflection was released a year earlier to incorporate with the theme of the Disney movie, Mulan. After Christina put out her first CD and her Spanish version (and the Christmas CD), she disappeared. I didn't know what happened to her. But last fall when I heard about her comeback I was very happy and excited. Of course she made a startling comeback with her sensual romping in 'Dirrty' (which I loved but raised many eyebrows in the industry and caused its banning from many TV stations and radio stations). I got the CD two months later for Christmas. I LOVED it. It's one of my favorite CDs, if not my favorite. <br />Stripped--an excellent piece set with many clips and pieces of interviews and newscasters in the background talking about Christina's scandalous career that introduces us to the new and real Christina. <br />Can't Hold Us Down--Not crazy about the Lil' Kim piece but everything else I really liked and enjoyed, with a great message for girls around the world. <br />Walk Away--One of my favorites. The haunting lyrics and melody really can put you in a sad state of feeling. The deep meaning and background of the song is very powerful <br />Fighter--A new twist of music for Christina: this song is actually a rock song. I loved the video and it truly fits with the song which is very dark and not all pop Britney Spears stuff. <br />Interlude--brings back memories of Christina's Latin album. Good introduction to Infatuation, if only I could understand the words. <br />Infatuation--sounds like one of Christina's earlier songs but it's still a good piece and would be great to dance to. <br />Loving Me For Me Interlude--sweet and soft lyrics and beat. The bird sounds in the background and the waterfall make it a nice introduction to Loving For Me. <br />Loving Me For Me--Great song, good lyrics and beat. Shows us once again how many styles Christina can manage on one album.<br />Impossible--Not one of my favorites but is very dynamic and powerful. A great rendition and duo with Alicia Keys. <br />Underappreciated--Good upbeat song with not such an upbeat message. A favorite, sounds very soulful and R & B like. <br />Beautiful--A favorite. Beautiful song (hence the name?) and if you ever feel down listen to this song and you will be smiling again just like in the video. <br />Make Over--Loud and rock like. Lots of curses thrown around. Not a favorite but still a very dynamic piece that shows off Christina and her singing capabilities. <br />Cruz--Good song with a somewhat independent message to teens.  <br />Soar--Not a favorite but has a great message about being yourself and not falling to the standards of others. Soulful and inspiring. <br />Get Mine, Get Yours--A favorite. Sexual lyrics, a sort of softer version of Dirrty. The song is simple, talks about sex. The innocent Christina is gone. <br />Dirrty--Favorite song on the CD. Loud, raunchy, sexual, sensual, and ravishing. I love the video as a counterpart. This song was bashed a lot but who cares, this is the real Christina and she should be able to express herself freely. <br />Stripped 2--Nice message, a continuation of Stripped, the first song. Reveals Christina's sexuality. <br />Voice Within--For some reason whenever I listen to this song it makes me feel a little sad and depressed and unhopeful. A good song though and Christina belts out a nice few notes. <br />I'm Ok--A sad haunting song. The melody, the cries of Christina in the background, and the sad message of Christina's childhood abuse will make you feel for Christina. <br />Keep on Singing My Song--Good closing song and piece for this CD. Not a favorite but the dynamics are great. You go girl! <br />All in all, I loved this CD. Christina is back and better than ever! Great job Christina and keep on singing your song!
B00003CXTG|3.0|I thought Pearl Harbor overall was a good movie. Good actors, some good scenes, but the story line is the only problem I have.<br />There was a good shocking lovestory, I liked that, but I'm a big fan of any kind of war movies, and anything with over 15 minutes of love...is a romance story not a war story. The only thing I think good that came out of the 4 hour long soap opera scenes was the testing of the friendship between the two men.<br />Like I said, Overall a good movie.
B00009RGBS|4.0|When I started watching this movie I was not sure if I was going to like it or not...some of it seemed a bit choppy. It took me a while to get the jist of the whole thing, but once I got into the swing of the film, I enjoyed it. I thought that the songs were great for the most part, and I was impressed with the talent that each actor/actress showed in this film. If you are into musicals, then this is the film for you.
B000065U1N|5.0|Personally Black Hawk Down is my favorite war movie thus far. The first time I saw it in the theaters I was blown away by the history based facts behind it and of course the soundtrack. But the story took me many watches to separate the Delta boys and the Rangers, and bring the whole story into one. (What can I say, I'm slow!) ;)<br />I was a little disappointed by the lack of extra features, but now there's a 3 disk set, which I haven't yet gotten to see, but will ASAP. <br />The cast is great, and Ridley Scott once again amazes me with his genius. Truly a great movie.
B00005JLSE|4.0|Before I had to sit down and watch this movie I groaned. <br />Let's be honest, after years of seeing Richard Gere in fairly nondescript movies I now had to accept he was a singer and a dancer too? Or Catherine Zita Jones - sings? And whilst not a passionate fan of musicals, I can say that I have certainly have enjoyed some of the old classics over the years.<br />All I can say is that when the movie had finished I felt like applauding, it was over too soon, it was very very good. So if musicals are your thing then you will not be ashamed to admit that this is in your collection.<br />Well worth the investment.
0020518706|4.0|I have to admit that it started off extremely slow for my taste. But as I read on I learned to love the characters and by the end of the book I wished I belonged in Jakes social group. Not Hemingways best, in my opinion, but it was an amazing first novel for an amazing writer.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I heard of Gavin DeGraw by watching Pepsi Smash. He performed &quot;chariot&quot; and i needed to buy the album. I wasn't let down by this cd. It gets better with each listen, and thats hard to find in albums today. This album sounds very raw and true to the artist. J records is awesome.
B000002H33|5.0|I think every one of metallicas albums are great.But this album<BR>definetly shows metallica at their best.In my opinion, ...and justice for all was their best, but this album comes in a close close close close second.I couldn't really say which song is best on the album, but leper messiah is definitly the worst. the song isn't bad, it just doesn't match the musical talent that every other song on this album has.welcome home [sanitarium] is one of my favorites on the album.Master Of Puppets is probably the best song that this album has to offer.Anyway, if you truely are a metallica fan, you should have this album, and if you don't buy it.....NOW!!!!!
B00005R87Q|5.0|THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS is just such a cool, fun, action-packed film that you can't help but love.  It has a very cool structured plot and it never becomes the least bit boring.  The acting is good, and wheather you're hyped-up by the action or twiddling your fingers in suspense, you won't leave the film unimpressed.  Unfortunately, it's somewhat underrated, too, becasue all the critics just think it's a bunch of mindless, stupid stuff with bad acting.  But, that's what they said about ROCKY, too, and look what happened! What do they know?   So, in conclusion, if you love undercover cop movies and racing movies, you can definately buy this before even rening it.
0440180295|5.0|If ever I become dictator of the world, I will make this required reading for all my subjects. What can I say? Tears and laughter are not adequate for this work.<br />It brought to the world Billy Pilgrim, the misfit loser with more than a few parallels to Jesus Christ. It brought to the world Vonnegut's deeply personal view of the bombing of Dresden. It confirmed that Vonnegut's wacky imagination could be applied to a serious subject to bring both hilarity and sorrow. It brought me, a person completely ignorant to the horrors of war, a person who can't stop eating his Three Musketeers candy bars, as close as I'll ever get to understanding war's consequences. With irony to spare and heart rending beauty, KV has made a true masterpiece.<br />Recommended to fans of Sci fi, fantasy, and the human experience.
B000084T18|5.0|Get Rich or Die Tryin' is one of the best albums out there <BR>50 Cent has really good songs wit sick beats
B0000AI44Q|5.0|This is the best record Neil Young has released in about a decade, and is at least as interesting as Tonight's the Night if not more so. The story can be a little difficult and confusing to follow at times (no lyrics included), but I found it hard NOT to pay attention closely to each song. Although I don't agree with some of the political views expressed (enough of the liberal save-the-environment-agenda already), it's still a compelling take on modern American life. And the music is outstanding!! Some of the best guitar Neil has ever played and Crazy Horse (without Pancho for some reason) sound fantastic. The music has almost a Mirror Ball-ish feel to it in the production and roughness, but that's a good thing. Especially coming after Are You Passionate, this album is great!
B000002UJQ|5.0|After the disappointing and recent &quot;hail to the Chief,&quot; it is good to re-visit OK Computer.  Yes the songs are downers but the lyrics are better and more original than most of the pop dreck out there.  The densely mixed tracks are always interesting and worth another listen. I doubt Radiohead will ever top this CD.
B00005JLXE|5.0|Since the new millenium began I have been waiting for a great pure action flick.  Daredevil is it.<br />While remaining true to the spirit of the comic, the four lead characters thrill us with their exploits.  The costumes were great, and while there is definitely story, the action is perfectly weaved within the plot.<br />The hour long documentary with the comic writers was excellent.  The hour long movie dialogue was OK, although some parts lagged.  All in all, I could not be happier with the film.
B000092ZYX|3.0|The singing is especially lacking and I didn't think I would ever say that about Radiohead.  Lots of whispering and mumbling and nothing very compelling.  The songs could have used a little more studio time.  And half of the CD's songs are really B-side material.  I miss the dense layered sounds of previous efforts.  This is a great band, but it is possible that whatever spark created OK Computer is fading. Fans will love it I suppose.
B000084T18|1.0|Yep, go ahead, all the white suburban litle 12 year old kids will not like this. 50 Cent is not real Hip Hop. He is a pop princess, just like Eminem. This ish is distroying Hip Hop. I don't care how many times this cat got shot, it dont make him real. Don't buy it, download it before. You'll be thankful if you are a TRUE Hip Hop fan.<br />I would recomend picking up some Common, Talib Kweli, Nas, Tupac, Big Pun, Remedy, The Roots, DMX, Canibus, BEP, Fabolous instead of this garbage<br />Oh, and Ja murdered 50 with \\"Loose Change\\" and \\"The Wrap\\"..Ja is a better MC even though they both wack.
B00005JLXE|5.0|I'll have to admit I've never heard of Daredevil untill the movie was released. It has lots of action sequences and the cast is subereb. Ben and Jennifer make a great duo. Then you throw Colin Farell and add Micheal Clarke Duncan as the kingpin. Micheal Clarke Duncan has always been one of my favorite actors because of his preformance in The Green Mile. I was suprised to see how much weight he had gained for this role. Plus the movie was awesome. If you have not yet bought it and you like comic books buy it. Do not buy the VHS. Only the DVD...
B00005JMD3|3.0|I spent my hard earned cash for a matinee fully expecting to watch a big, loud, dumb, mindless and escapist action packed film filled with gun-fights, fist fights, stuff blowing up, mean Euro-trash villains (in this case a real slimy Gaul), a team made of devoted experts, decent enough acting and a few funny lines as well as a passable performance by the young Mel Gibson-like Colin Farrell and I have to say, my money was well spent. <br />SWAT has the potential to be the TOP GUN for special police forces. SWAT contains TOP GUN'S romanticized vision of ripped warrior bodies performing great feats of physical skill. Like TOP GUN'S Navy Pilots and their super sonic jets, this super Police force expertly manipulates specific technology to defeat the forces of evil. A warrior's complete and total command over the tools of the trade- guns, cars, clubs and each other makes such films work as effective recruitment tools. Who wouldn't want to be part of such an expert team?<br />SWAT embraces all the required clichés befitting a proper action/cop picture: the [...]by-the-numbers captain, the hardened veteran (played with the usual strength and charisma by the always excellent Samuel L. Jackson), the roguish rebel, the tough female partner, the shapeshifting turncoat and the family man as sacrificial lamb. <br />If someone wants a decent action-adventure, no thinking required, entertaining junk food movie that provides temporary satisfaction, SWAT serves the bill.
B0000001PW|5.0|This was my first &quot;jazz&quot; album. I had seen the parody of Chick Corea (or Trick Corea as they called him) in Finnish TV-show and I decided to try this. The sounds and playing on this album are  superb. <br />Corea is the best fusion composer and his bandmates Weckl and Patitucci are sometimes even claimed to be the very best musicians on their instruments. I also love Carlos Rios' sound and I think that it is pity that Gambale replaced him later. Rios adds some elements to his fast jazz-scale playing that sound like claptonisque blues licks for me.<br />Synthsounds of mid 80s are very funny. I have searched other fusion album like this but in vain.
B00000HYXB|5.0|At least that is how I see it.  I can't say that with complete authority as there are a lot of bands out there that I haven't heard yet but still, an album based on a novel by one of the greatest writers in the history of fantasy has to be up there.  Nightfall in middle Earth is based on the Silmarillion, a book by J.R.R. Tolkien.  A book, by the way, that I read once a great while ago.  I didn't find it that great to be honest.  A little on the dry side for me.  Of course, I was a youngster then.  I might appreciate it more now that I'm in my dotage.  But enough about me.  This album is like a small mini-novel with spoken word parts to add ambience and an interesting atmosphere.  There are so many great songs on this album that it is hard to pick a favorite but the one that clearly stands out to me is 'mirror mirror'.  It is definitely one of my favorite BG songs as well as my favorite 'short' of theirs.  That is to say it's my favorite song of theirs that is under six minutes long.  Although this is a good album some people might be off put at first, particularly people used to more, how shall I put his, traditional metal.  There are a lot of slow, melodic songs like The Eldar which I didn't much care for at first but grow on you.<BR>  The production on this album(and Imaginations from the other side) is quite sharp and an improvement over previous albums due to Flemming Rasmussens able work.  Hmm, I guess I don't have much more to say except that if you like Tolkien and you like metal then, well, what are you waiting for? ...
B00009XITQ|5.0|I took my 7 year old sister to see this movie and we both loved it. With Amanda Bynes in the lead role it had her attention and Colin Firth has been a favorite of mine for years since he played Mr Darcy on Pride and Prejudice.<br />The story, though convenient and perhaps contrite is good clean fun for the younger audience.Amanda Bynes did a great job. I really liked her in this role. Can I tell you how amazing Colin Firth is as Henry Dashwood. I know now why he his my ideal man. Is it ridiculous to have a crush at 27? If so call me ridiculous.<br />Anyway, we rented it the other night and my 50 year old mother liked it as well. She has declared that it is one we will be purchasing for the collection. It is definitely worth a watch. It will not change your life, but is good clean fun.
B00000IP3S|4.0|This was a great pick up for me as I got it off my brother for four bucks.  He was dumping some of his old metal CD's and I took advantage.  Needless to say, I have rarely gotten such a return on four dollars as I have with this album.  My favorite song on the album is the title track, which is one of my favorite Blind Guardian songs ever.  Bright eyes is a pretty good song too, a strong power ballad, although without the usual power ballad type lyrics.  In fact the lyrics for much of this album are pretty out there, hence the title.  As a whole this album mixes thrash metal with slower, more deliberate power metal.  My favorite of the three 'thrash' songs on the album is probably I'm Alive.  The other two, Born in a mourning hall and Another holy war don't do as much for me but are still good.  My least favorite song is probably Mordred's song.  It seems a little flat compared to some of the others.  But that's just my opinion.  It will probably be someone's favorite but I personally don't listen to it as much as the other tracks.<br />  At any rate, be sure to buy this album, especially if you are a fan of Arthurian literature.  This album is the closest thing I've seen to a heavy metal soundtrack for 'The Once and Future King'.  Additionally, if you like this album but are in the mood for something a little heavier(as my brother obviously was) then I suggest Iced Earth.  They are somewhat similar but have more of a heavier core with heavier riffs that stand out more whereas Blind Guardian are more focused on epic vocals.
0812036034|3.0|Reading this play is not too interesting. There are a lot of visual elements in this play such as ship wrecks, dancing fairies, the use of magic, and an ugly monster. The themes of power, freedom and forgiveness are touched upon.<br />Propero has had his kingdom usurped by his brother and he seeks to regain his kingdom by the use of his magic. His brother Antonio and company are purposely shipwrecked on the island that Prospero has been banished to. One of the shipwrecked company is a son of a king named Ferdinand who falls in love at first sight with Prospero's daughter Miranda and he becomes a slave to Prospero. Typical Shakesphearian love at first sight silliness ensues.<br />Prospero has another slave, a monster named Caliban. Caliban is an interesting character with some of the best lines in the play. He seeks to regain the island back from Prospero with the help of two lowly comic characters, Trinculo and Stephano. This part is faintly funny to read about.<br />Eventually the play wraps up with the gruff, overbearing, cantankerous, and somewhat cruel windbag Prospero forgiving his brother's trespasses, regaining his kingdom, and stifling Caliban's rebellion. And, of course, no Shakespheare play is complete without a marraige--this time Miranda and Ferdinand will be wed. Prospero also frees his trusty servant-fairy Ariel and having accomplished all this, mentions that he is ready to die.<br />Prospero is a psychologically complex character worth reading about. I also liked the scene in which his betraying brother Antonio seeks to subtlely persuade Sebastian to kill Alonso, the duke of Naples, and capture his kingdom. It had a lot of moody, dramatic tension to it. But for the most part I couldn't get into this play.
B00008WG3U|5.0|I've listened to the album four million times and every time I still feel like I'm on ripped fuel or something after I listen to it.  My favorite NOFX cd so far.  Although it's entirely politics, and I disagree with most of what they say, the quality of music is terrific.
B000089RVX|5.0|I'm sure that a million people who listen to every word in this album will say they same thing...that something spoke to them.  I am just one of these million.  Yes, the album can feel dark.  But when you are in the mood for some dark music so you can scream, cry or whatever, this is so great!  Her voice is truly haunting and yet could be my own.  Wonderful and beautiful and sad and just buy it because you wouldn't be reading this if you didn't already want to.
0800196767|5.0|A little girl who is in a horrible situation at home and yet makes the best of her life anyway, Matilda is a hilarious, sometimes scary film.  The &quot;Trunch&quot; is masterfully played.  At no point do I doubt any of the characters.  I laugh, I cry, I'm scared, and joyous again as the indefatigable Matilda fights her way into the life she deserves.

1881273156|1.0|Nothing more than antidotal information collected through connections with the extremely religious! I've encountered people who have read the book using laughable phrases such as \\"my love tank is full\\".  If you really want to understand communication styles stick with people who have done the research and have the credentials.  Deborah Tannen has written several well-researched books that are helpful in improving communication in interpersonal relationships.
B000002WAD|4.0|rick astley is one of the most underrated and under appreciated singers out there,he's singing is better than 75 % of the artists of today,with such a fantastic voice it makes me wonder why this guy never made it big in the music business.i must admit the only reason i bought this cd was for the only two songs i heard on this cd before i bought it,the songs are never gonna give you up and together forever which are both classic tunes but by no means the only good tracks off this cd.my favorite tracks off this cd are the love has gone,when i fall in love and my personal favorite slipping away.the only reason i did'nt give this cd a five star rating is because of the two weaker tracks you move me and don't say goodbye but astley's vocals are still beautiful on these two tracks.if you are looking for an album with nice,relaxing music with beautiful meaningful lyrics that you can relate too ,then this is the album for you.
6303165680|5.0|Rowan Atkinson, who plays the nervous and shy Father Gerald, speaks those lines at a wedding.  His writing partner, Richard Curtis, wrote this sweet, good-natured comedy of a circle of friends, all in their thirties, who attend weddings and gradually wonder the mysteries of love.  Is it better to hold out for that ideal person or as the bumbling, nice, but not exactly fashion-modellish Tom puts it, \\"I always just hoped that, that I'd meet some nice friendly girl, like the look of her, hope the look of me didn't make her physically sick, then pop the question and, um, settle down and be happy.\\"  The follies of finding anyone just to prevent from being lonely is also explored here, but so is the chain reaction that occurs at weddings, i.e. other people in turn end up getting married in serendipitous circumstances.<br />The opening scenes to the first marriage of the various friends getting ready, set to an Elton John song, sets the stage for the story.  The scenes of the slow-rising Charles and his female roommate Scarlett result in a series of comical scenes that elicit the f-word from them both, including missing the offramp leading to the wedding site.<br />It's at the first wedding that Cupid launches a projectile at Charles (Hugh Grant) via Carrie (Andie McDowell), an American who appears at the wedding with a big black hat.  What might have been a missed opportunity later turns depressing for Charles when he finds out she's engaged.  Indeed, he has a history of ex-girlfriends that leads the sensitive Henrietta to call him a serial monogamist.  But Charles is bewildered with awe at people who are actually ready to take that lifelong committment.  After all, despite divorce being commonplace, the sanctity of wedding still carries importance.  Both Grant's goofy and McDowell's sweet and lovable performances lift this film up, with the latter's winning smile, but they're not the only ones.<br />Fiona (Kristin Scott Thomas), nicknamed Fi or even Fifi, has a dignified beauty colored by a cynical tongue.  In the first wedding, when Scarlett gushes over the bride, she says, \\"Scarlett, you're blind.  She looks like a big meringue.\\"  She also unleashes her tart tongue at meek Father Gerald, training to be a priest.  She says it's rather like the first time one has sex, \\"a lot less messy of course, and far less call for condoms.\\"  Gerald titters with nervous laughter.<br />Of the other characters, Gareth, played by Simon Callow, is flamboyant, simply jovial, full of life, a true romantic, someone it's fun to hang around and be merry with, and as we learn later, a culinary eccentric.  Seeing him cutting loose on the dance floor in the first wedding is a highlight.  He plays with the theory that marriage is the last gasp between two couples who have run out of things to say, then says that true love is the driving force behind marriage.<br />The pint-sized Scarlett (Charlotte Coleman) is another funny character.  She has a shock of short bright red hair, sings offkey at church, and gets flirty with strangers at weddings.  It was quite a shock when I heard of her death from an asthma attack last year.<br />And David, Charles's deaf brother who's quite a dish, also gains some laughs in the conversations he has with his brother, and also with a girl who fancies him enough to take sign language lessons.  Is that love or what?<br />Another bit of trivia.  According to Richard Curtis, Henrietta's nickname was toned down to Duckface for propriety.  Guess what it was originally going to be?  Hint:  Duck gets replaced by a word it rhymes with.  And for those who don't know, the poem read at the funeral is W.H. Auden's \\"Funeral Blues\\".<br />With winning performances all around, great lines, be they witty, acerbic, or poignant, Four Weddings And A Funeral is a funny, romantic, and heartwarming winner from director Mike Newell (Enchanted April, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire [pending]).  It give me hope that someday, maybe somedayE And ifyou don't like it, your name is duckface.f you don't like it, your name is duckface.
B000051VWW|5.0|Sade was always one of those artists I knew I'd love, even before I had anything by her. WEll, this is my first thing by her, so I'm in no position  to compare it to her previous works, but this is a beautiful cd.The music on it is so beautiful, it just makes me so calm and puts me in a great state of mind.Her voice is silk and does wonders for the spirit.There is nothing forced or overdone-everything on lover's rock is understated and tasteful.I can't reccomend anything better for when you just wanna chill, or you just need some mellow music around the house.I loved this cd instantly.
B000001FS3|5.0|When I first listened to this album in 1987, it was too popular for me to listen at that time. However, I became a fan due to the fact that this album is the most absolutely outstanding, astonishing, amazing, astounding, breathtaking, eyepopping, magnificent, preeminent, colossal, and so on. There have been no other better groups than U2 from 80s until now. Anyone is gonna love this album unless you have a totally different taste. More than 5 stars!
1573228737|5.0|A much different setting than &quot;Tipping the Velvet,&quot; Affinity has still managed to capture a dark side of Victorian London. It brushes on the mysteries of &quot;spiritualism&quot; and indulges in a forbidden love of two women. It is suspenseful, keeping you on the edge of your seat until the very end and then some. <BR>It is the story of a proper lady, Margaret Prior and the love affair she shares with prision inmate, Selina Dawes. The books twists and turns, taking you on an unexpected ride where the characters battle between propriety, love, spiritualism and dark secrets.
B00005QIPH|5.0|This is the best album I have ever heard.  There are no weaks songs on is this it.  The best song in my opinion is the modern age.  This cd makes a joke out of the white stripes elephant and the yeah yeah yeahs fever to tell.  It is way better than all the garbo on the radio today like fitty cent eh homie. i see all these nerds walkin around with the erkel look (there pants tucked in there socks) there always a white guy too. This is way better than all that [junk].
B00000JPHD|5.0|I really enjoyed this film. I'm reading the book right now.(If you like the movie, you'll like the book)People are right- the movie doesn't go on the exact same story as the book. It doesn't matter. This movie is one that will always be one of my favorites. There are so many lines that I remember so often. It was really a masterful way that they put together the scenes. The absence of music after the beginning credits really sets a deathly tone over the whole thing.The thing that most amazed me is that this movie is so advanced as far as movies went over 70 years ago! Yes, the bats on strings are a little cheesy; but I assure you you'll get off the couch and for weeks say,&quot;Listen to them:children of the night. What music THEY make.&quot;<BR>                You'll enjoy this one.
B00005JM09|4.0|I saw T3 on it's opening day here in Australia with a lot of high hopes and thoughts. From the haunting music playing over the opening titles (though I missed the T2 theme)really set up a good mood. Then a little later watching a bottle fall into a sea of skulls to rise up into the future with breathtaking and destructive awe of the Machines in action!!! It really begins with great scope and determination to be another step in the Terminator series,only settling down a briefly to introduce our four main chracters. From then onwards the movie pretty much doesn't stop and leads into an amazing truck/car chase scene with great effects and sound. Seeing Arnie 'back' is a highlight, his role here is his best since T2 which was 12 yrs ago. He suits the role and gets into the character well. Some of the dialogue from Nick,Arnie and Clair was great within the movie with Arnie being serious and a more 'inhuman' machine which contrasts the T2 Arnie. After some awesome action sequences the movie delves into the process of turning nasty...with the iminant doom of Judgement Day only hours away and the Terminator hinting at what he just accomplished before beging reprogrammed and sent back...with a nice bell sound in the music as he says it.Nice stuff. This all leads to a finale that is just amazing and brilliant with some more terrific standoffs between Arnie's Machine and Loken's TX...and skynet taking control! After some great moments it takes us to somewhere humanity dreads and hopes never becomes reality...the end of the world as we know it. Beltrami's music is beautiful, with the haunting tunes(which I found similar to a BBC Dr Who episode titled \\"Terror of the Zygons\\", as John and Kate enter the fall out shelter command room,which leads into a lovely yet sad theme as the missiles destroy our world and closes on a skull of the Terminator and his red light dimming to bring us to a closure with the great Terminator theme on the credits(reworked). It truely is a great movie and was a highlight and new approach to a great series. I love Jim Cameron's first two(and his other films, especially Titanic!) and now Mostow's adds another dimension to it...not as creative in certain ways and sinister as T2, but more a solem and eerie film with action in it. A great movie, which I recommend and probably 2003's top film so far. A wonderful job and it's nice to see Terminator and Arnie back! Can't wait for the DVD!!!
0790742780|5.0|This will be a commentary on the \\"editorial review\\" of the movie for other Amazon users have already given good reviews of it.<BR>It seemed to me like the pro. missed the first 10 minutes of the film, and missed what was happening around him in the early '90s.<BR>As a former defense worker I can assure you that this is the only sympathetic movie out there for the tens of thousands of people who lost their jobs due to permanent downsizing.  I was not one of them but I survived a 50% downsize, no morale booster in itself.<br />Michael Douglas has been in defense for 2+ decades.<BR>He's laid off.  Just like that.  It's about how a def. worker comes out into the real Central/East/South LA at that time and is in disbelief that people treat each other the way they do.<BR>In silence, he looks around at this place and I'm thinking he's wondering why he spent his life building weapons to save these people from being occupied by other countries.  It has cost him his wife, custody of his child, and now he is \\"thanked\\" by being made redundant.<BR>He'd just like to show up at his daughter's birthday party, against his wife's wishes.  Yeah, as he runs into trouble along the way he gets more desparate and more isolated.  The cop pursuing him played by Robert Duvall is also obsolete, which gives him insight into finding him.<br />I guess the editor, Marshall Fine, was living in his own world when he wrote his review of the movie.
B0000041DZ|4.0|On listening to the interpretation of Beethoven's Piano Sonatas, one has to realise and admire the fact that the self-educated Alfred Brendel seems to add something new to Beethoven. Although I do prefer the Beethoven Sonatas by Daniel Barenboim due to it's &quot;traditional&quot; style (a recital sticking very closely to Beethoven's sheetmusic- and enunciation notes, giving it a very peaceful and common-sensible glow), Brendel seems something to get used to. If I were to call Barenboim the &quot;traditional&quot; and thus &quot;conservative&quot; master-pianst, Brendel would probably have to be called the &quot;radical&quot; and thus &quot;progressive&quot; variation. This is a conclusion made whilst listening to the Brendel's very unique style, of combining very harsh and wooden-sounding notes with soft and cloudy sounding ones. Many people would condemn such playing to &quot;bad piano playing&quot;, but this, of course, is not the case. <br />Beethoven himself was a genius with a very much troubled life, and who's music is mainly recognised by a certain troubeld feel to it, due to the gigantic and quickly conjured up contrasts in tone (for instance, the third movement of his 17th sonata), volume (the first movement of the 23rd sonata, known as the &quot;Appassionata&quot; sonata) and speed (the first movement of his 8th sonata, also known as the &quot;Pathetique&quot; sonata). Brendel manages not only to play these notes in the way Beethoven intended them to be played, but he also applies his own, progressive feelings to the enunciation of the work. He mainly does this, by adding more speed to the piece, of by making the notes sound somewhat irregular (which, on listening closer to the piece, is definitley not so). <br />Brendel is thus able to positively take Beethoven beyond Beethoven, experiment with Beethoven and multiply Beethoven with Beethoven. Although sounding sometimes a bit experimental, this collection of Beethoven sonata is unmissable for any Beethoven fan.
B00003CX8U|5.0|A seemingly honest autobiographical film of Fosse on Fosse during his period in preparation for \\"Chicago!\\" Extremely personal. Dark but brilliant.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|If you are debating on which one to buy...think no further. You have found your answer. This is a wonderful CD which really takes you into the movie itself. You replay the entire fantastic movie in your head as you are drawn into the the lively music. This CD wins hands down to anyother soundtrack in the market. I am a huge fan of Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl the acual movie. So if you have not seen that yet, you must do so immediatly!!!!! NO EXCUSES! The best money you will ever spend. So by all means get this CD become part of the epic motion picture!
B00000K19E|5.0|Best of the best - number 1 movie of all times.
B0000797IO|4.0|I really enjoyed this film. I thought Jennifer Aniston did a great job, and it was a treat to see her playing something so different from the role on Friends that's made her famous. This film brilliantly captured the helplessness of being trapped in a life you don't want. The only complaint I have is that on the DVD, the commentary for the deleted scenes is almost non-existent and what little there is is hard to understand.
B000002U8G|5.0|Before The Wall, before Dark Side of the Moon, Pink Floyd created a very different kind of masterpiece. While their later albums were a triumph of concept, it is on Meddle where one can hear the *musical* peak of Pink Floyd's career. This is not a concept album--it is a musical journey showing off a variety of musical styles. The lyrics do not demand--they suggest, and allow the music to do the rest of the talking. Perhaps the most wonderful thing about Meddle is the fact that the band was truly functioning as a *band* here. Everyone's talents can be clearly heard, and no one shouts anybody else down.<br />There is no such thing as filler, on Meddle. Bookended by the mindblowing tracks &quot;One of These Days&quot; and &quot;Echoes&quot;, the four &quot;interior&quot; tracks are severely underrated. &quot;A Pillow of Winds&quot; and &quot;Fearless&quot; are both pleasant, leisurely guitar-driven songs, and seem fairly well appreciated by fans. However, I believe that the much-maligned &quot;San Tropez&quot; and &quot;Seamus&quot; are also deserving of appreciation. &quot;San Tropez&quot; is particularly notable for some very unique Roger Waters vocals--rather optimistic and even a touch bluesy...a style he unfortunately never pursued after that point. &quot;Seamus&quot; gives a rare glimpse of the fun side of Pink Floyd, as well as a flashback to the band's origins as a blues cover band. This was never a song meant to be taken so seriously as some do. &quot;One of These Days&quot; is an explosive, energetic instrumental that perhaps foreshadows the angry, driven rock of Animals, but with only one lyric--a rare appearance by Nick Mason, whose processed vocals growl menacingly, &quot;One of these days, I'm going to cut you into little pieces!&quot;<br />The album's final piece, &quot;Echoes&quot;, may be Pink Floyd's greatest work ever. From first to last &quot;ping&quot;, this brilliant near-symphony is fantastic. Each bandsman's talents are clearly audible, even thesimple-yet-effective contributions of Nick Mason and Roger Waters. The vocal harmony of David Gilmour and Richard Wright is mesmerising. Without question, this song contains the best verse Mr. Waters ever wrote: &quot;Strangers passing in the street, by chance two separate glances meet, and I am you and what I see is me. And do I take you by the hand, and lead you through the land, and help me understand the best I can?&quot;<br />Unfortunately, this reminder to walk a mile in the other man's shoes was a lesson Mr. Waters forgot in later years, at the price of devastating consequences to the band's output and to the members themselves. This moment in Pink Floyd's history is therefore one-of-a-kind, completely irreplaceable. The entire album can be summed up by the &quot;jam&quot; sequence in &quot;Echoes&quot;. Never before, never again do the pieces fit together so seamlessly, each a joy on its own and in combination.
B00006I53S|5.0|I have nothing to add that others have not written about the quality of the lens in regards to sharpness and contrasts, however, I found that the I.S. really excells with stationary subjects in low light. I shot a wedding in a dark church with this lens and hand held. even at 1/4-1/8 second got me acceptable sharpness. I also tried 1/2 sec but sharpness started to really drop off. Granted, for a lens that is not in Canon's &quot;L&quot; series, it's a great performer in helping me get acceptable sharpness where I couldn't before. It's a great lens to hone skills with before you jump in to the much more expensive &quot;L&quot; series pool...You get what you pay for
076781326X|5.0|Oliver is for me one of the best musicals ever made in cinema. With the wonderfull Fagin'n roll in hands of Ron Moody you can't do anything wrong spend your money in this item.Only for this you must buy this dvd.<BR>This Carol Reed Film Won six Oscar and everybody: Jack wild , Mark Lester and specially Shanni Wallis, Harry Secombe and Oliver Reed make excellent interpretations.They are good actors and actrees.<BR>Excellent Original sountrack.<BR>Are you gonna miss the dvd really or must i send you my homesick dog to convince you?
B00005JLSE|2.0|I am pleased to see the revival of the musical, but I have real problems with &quot;Chicago&quot;. My problem is very basic - for any show to appeal to me, it has to resonate at some level. Especially with a musical, there should be someone in it you can either identify with or would invite into your home. The only sympathetic character is Roxie's husband, but I'd invite him in just out of pity. All through the &quot;Razzle Dazzle&quot; number, all I could think of was Johnny Chochran - and no, I wouldn't invite him in either.<br />A good show about terrible people just isn't enough for me - and I remain totally underwhelmed by Renee Zellwegger.
B000088E6D|5.0|I just ordered this CD after only hearing parts of it.  The voice is absolutely beautiful.  All of the songs that I have heard are done beautifully, especially &quot;Summer Wind&quot; and &quot;You'll Never Find&quot;, but his version of the Bee Gees &quot;How Can you Mend a Broken Heart&quot; is the best one I have heard, with the exception of the Bee Gees version.  The fact that the guys join in on this version makes even more special.<br />If you want to hear a great voice (better than Sinatra) sing some beautiful standards you have to get his CD.
B00005N5S5|5.0|Something about it being an older movie, perhapes the way the film looks, makes this movie truly scary. Not scary like all the spiders attacking people in today's current movies but something more. <br />Terminator II is a good movie for its effects, but Terminator I is the scariest movie, as well as the best one.
B0000029DD|5.0|You can feel him listening to this record with you. The voice...the passion...the tragedy. My goodness this performance is what music is and has always been about...great artist gone before his time. The music is heartwrenching and classic.<BR>T8
B00008972S|5.0|I LOVE musicals.  People who know me know this as a fact, as it's completely obvious and I make no attempts to hide it.  This movie is certainly no exception.  I saw it in high school for the first time, in my film study class.  And instantly I was hooked.  I'm so glad that it finally got the DVD treatment that it deserves!  This movie still holds up after 40 years, which is no small feat!  This is a must-have for any fan of musicals.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|I had the luck of attending Neil Young's &quot;Greendale&quot; concert on my birthday, (June 19), and left the concert completely impressed; nearly stunned.  The power of this man's words, combined with the raw guitar and simple instrumentation of his Crazy Horse comrades, was akin to an old-fashioned &quot;revival&quot; meeting.  I have never left a show with such a feeling of awe over the portrait Mr. Young creates with this musical masterpiece.  I won't go into the premise/concept of the cd as that should have been explained already.  Suffice it to say, Mr. Young has released a brilliant piece that describes the greed, media frenzy and destruction of the Earth we are &quot;all&quot; reeking on this planet.  His acerbic and biting style is sure to have you nodding your head in agreement.  Some critics have argued that his theater production at the concert was amateurish and that it was cheesy.  To this I say, I think that is the whole &quot;point&quot;.  When you look at the inane t.v. shows like &quot;American Idol&quot; and &quot;Joe Millionaire&quot; you can't help but realize this is all a big distraction to keep us from seeing &quot;what's really going on.&quot;  And what's really going on is the planet is choking on its own excesses, the media focuses on the &quot;entertainment&quot; aspect of news to amuse us and we all live lives of quiet desperation, (though we don't take it as far as Jed, I hope).  Shades of Orwell creep into the lyrics of &quot;Leave the Driving&quot; with the lines, &quot;And we'll be watching you, no matter what you do, and you can do your part, by watching others too&quot;, (John Ashcroft should love it!).  Other lyrics that struck me as prophetic are from &quot;Grandpa's Interview&quot;: &quot;It ain't a privilege to be on tv, and it ain't a duty either, The only good thing about tv, is shows like &quot;Leave it to Beaver&quot;.  In a world of slick productions and deceitful marketing ploys, this music stands out because it is neither.  In a world full of corporate sell-outs and big business weasels, this cd differentiates itself from the rest by being honest and heart-felt.  ...
B00008GKEG|5.0|11 hours of fantastic Beatles memories!!!  This set is only recommended for those die-hard Beatle fanatics like myself.  But if you are one of those people, then you certainly won't be disappointed by this set.  However, pace yourself.  There is A LOT of stuff, and even the most obsessed of fans will find themselves overwhelmed after a few hours.  I recommend watching one DVD a day.  Each DVD holds 2 episodes, for roughly 2 and 1/2 hours of Beatlemania!  This set is a crown jewel in my DVD collection, and it was definitely money well spent.  Plus, the sound and video quality is superb.  They really did a nice job cleaning up the old footage for this set.
B00006G8LB|5.0|Spider-man is an epic thriller that will have you on the edge of your seat.  Tobey Maguire is an excellent actor in all the movies he acts in.  This movie was awesome!!  <br />                         P.S. Jamie from toronto...don't you dare ever say that Lord of the Rings is dumb.
B00006DEF9|5.0|I really don't know what to say about this film that hasn't already been said ad nauseum, so I'll keep this review short and sweet.  If you are a fan of good movies, and especially a fan of musicals, then you absolutely must buy this film right now!  In fact, why are you still reading this?  Go put this in your shopping cart immediately!  You won't be disappointed.
B00004S8X5|5.0|This is my favourite album of all: i like very much the sound, that is cheerful and light-hearted, and the rhythm is immediate and contagious, when I feel blue, it makes me happy. Kylie Minogue is changed a lot from Kylie to the recent released Fever, but I suggest to every Kylie Minogue's fan to listen to this album because it deserve it, at least as the birth of a international star like her.
B000053VAF|5.0|I love Kevin Smith's movies....They're rude, crude, and the dialogue is somewhat intelligent.  It's not all [rude] jokes like some people seem to think.  Anyways, Dogma is probably his most intelligent film to date.  Kevin Smith grew up Catholic, as did I, and this film pokes fun at alot of the stereotypes of Catholicism.  He never said it was to be taken seriously, so I don't understand why it is causing such a great controversy!  It's a movie!  Anyways, I love it, it's hilarious, and I recommend it to anyone who loves a good laugh.
0060090367|2.0|This book was lent to me when I broke my leg last month &quot;to make me forget my pain.&quot;  What pain?  Claire, the narrator, is one of the most annoying characters I've ever met in fiction, self-absorbed, flighty, superficial, drunkard, shop-aholic, and we're supposed to sympathize with her antics?  Not to mention her crazy sisters...  The husband character in the story changes from being one of the most wonderful guys in the world to being a nit-picking jerk, which demonstrates either what a dim-wit Claire is at having so misjudged him, or a real flaw in the writer's skill.  I stopped reading the book short of the last couple of chapters, it's just too painful!
B00003CX5P|5.0|I don't really understand why when this movie came out, everyone seemed to like it alot, especially judging by the crowds in the theaters a month after it's release, and now it seems that the new fashion is to bash on it!  Sure the acting may not have been great on Natalie Portman's part, she was young, and besides, carrying on the Star Wars legacy is a daunting task.  She could have done a lot worse.  How easily we seem to forget Mark Hamill's acting in the first Star Wars!  The same can be said for Ewan McGregor!  He's playing Obi-Wan for crying out loud!  How tough is that to try to fill Sir Alec Guinness' shoes?!?!?!?  I think the cast did a wonderful job, Darth Maul was great, Jar Jar Binks was cute and funny, and all in all I thought it was a perfect addition the the Star Wars stories.
B00005JLTM|5.0|I loved this movie!  Yes, it was \\"more of the same,\\" but that is what sequels are about.  I loved how it expanded on the characters--you learned who was who and more about them, their hopes and beliefs.  <br />The footage of Zion gave you a deeper understanding of the people at this time--their fears, how they cope, how they live, what their reality is.  Keanu's stunt at the end--when they were in the real world but he still stopped the bullets somehow--was fantastic!<br />I can't wait to find out what happens next.  I'm really glad they're releasing the sequel in a few months--the suspense is killing me!  :)
B00005JLSE|5.0|Absolutely fantastic, stunning, beautiful.......there just aren't enough words to describe how wonderful this movie is!!!  I'm biased because I LOVE musicals......but I believe that even those who normally don't like musicals will enjoy this, simply because of the unconvential way the song and dance numbers are presented.  Zeta-Jones, Zellweger, and Gere were BORN for this movie......I've NEVER liked Zellweger in anything I've seen her in until I saw this.  John C. Reilly's rendition of Mr. Cellophane is beautiful, and who knew he could sing like that? Oh, and what can you say about Gere's tap number?  You HAVE to see it to believe how good it is!!! Anyways, I won't go into plot details, there's no need to......but anyways, this movie is beautiful.  It's definitely a crowd pleaser, and for that reason, it definitely deserved the Best Picture Oscar.  I'm tired of stuffy, boring movies (The English Patient, or Il Postino, anyone? UGH) winning the Best Picture constantly, and it's about time that something fun and lively such as this took home the statue.  I highly recommend this movie!
B00003CXXM|2.0|Maybe it's just me, but I think I've seen cars that give their lines with more soul than Matt Damon. The story seems weak as well. I have no desire to watch this again, but if the wife was to pop it in the DVD player, I might not leave the room.
B00009P1O0|5.0|With &quot;On the Beach,&quot; Neil Young sent a signal to the millions of fans he accumulated with classic recordings like &quot;Everybody Knows this is Nowhere,&quot; &quot;After the Gold Rush,&quot; and &quot;Harvest&quot;-- the fans who packed stadiums to watch him perform as part of the supergroup CSNY--that he was no longer interested in them, he was going to follow his own path.  He didn't change his music all that much--at this point, it was still acoustic and electric guitars, country-western touches, the same vocal style--but the subject matter and outlook became much bleaker, and the rhythms and tunes far less engaging than the country-rock beats and singalong melodies of his earlier work.<br />Overall, I think this willfullness and defiance, this confessional indulgence, this &quot;you think you know me, well you dooooon't&quot; attitude has served Neil Young poorly.  Young is consistently better when he is in touch with his audience, as he clearly was on the early albums I mentioned, and on later classics like &quot;Rust Never Sleeps,&quot; &quot;Ragged Glory,&quot; &quot;Freedom&quot; and &quot;Harvest Moon&quot; he is breathtakingly insightful, powerful and still very much an individual despite the almost Springsteen-like common touch.<br />&quot;On the Beach&quot; is the grand exception that proves the rule.  It is a great album, and hearing it after all these years, it sounds much better than I remember it.  Yes, it's a downer, and on the surface it sounds listless at times.  But it is incredibly well-crafted, with some of the best lyrics he ever wrote.  Almost every song is great, and what used to be Side 2 (the title song, &quot;Motion Pictures&quot; and &quot;Ambulance Blues&quot;) is a startling trilogy that travels from utter despair, toward redemption and relief in love, and finally ending in mature reflection as he puts his entire life on the line and in the lyrics of the closing song.<br />Several of the songs have the word &quot;blues&quot; in the title, and believe it, there is more traditionally structured blues on this record than any other Neil Young did, and he makes great use of the form.  I guess what makes this record work for me is the way he uses his own personal disasters, the deaths of his friends, as a metaphor for the disastrous end of an era, one that starts so optimistically in the &quot;old folkie days (when) the air was magic&quot; but ends with this image: &quot;All along the Navajo trail/burn-outs stub their toes on garbage pails.&quot;  Hippie wreckage is everywhere on this album, and the deaths of his friends are finally understood as the betrayal of dreams for which not enough people took responsibility.&quot; in the title, and believe it, there is more traditionally structured blues on this record than any other Neil Young did, and he makes great use of the form.

B0000B1OFN|5.0|This movie rocks.  Im sure you all know how good this summer was, movie wise.  There was a hit movie every week.  People didn't really look at this movie or saw it.  Or even really knew about it.  But this has to be one of the best movies of the summer, if not the best movie.  See this movie when it comes out or if it is still in theaters, see it now!!!!!
0671027344|5.0|I loved The Perks of Being a Wallflower.  It has something for everyone to relate to.  Charlie is such a fascinating and insightful character and throughout the book I was able to see some of myself in him. If you are a teenager this book is a must to read.  It will make you laugh, cry, and will definitely move you in one way or another.
B00004Y2QT|4.0|As a Prince fan from way back, I have to admit that I've been pretty lax in my purchases of late.  &quot;The Rainbow Children&quot; was an interesting foray into his jazz fetishes, while &quot;Rave Unto The Joy Fantastic&quot; (his attempt at 'Santana'-type blockbuster status once more) was capable at best, but I haven't been as interested as I once was... why?<br />It's because of that elusive 'live' gig.<br />With &quot;Sign 'O' The Times&quot; still out there on laserdisc and VHS, and a plethora of perfect-sounding/masterfully performed bootlegs out there, I can't give this 5 stars, because it's far from perfect, but for now, it will do.<br />With the exception of the drummer and the pointless go-go dancing foils, Prince's line-up for this performance is pretty solid.  Larry Graham especially shines, no matter how mannered and overdone these particular songs might be in the Prince live show.  Highlights: &quot;Everyday People&quot;, &quot;American Woman&quot;, &quot;Red House&quot;, &quot;She's Always In My Hair&quot;, &quot;Raspberry Beret&quot;, &quot;Purple Rain&quot;, and &quot;The Cross/Christ&quot;.<br />The lowlights?  An excess of religion (although nobody should be surprised by this), a lack of really EXTENDED jams as on the '88 Lovesexy tour, and unnecessarily spotless production.  It should sound a lot grittier at times, but doesn't.
0440236738|5.0|What a great book!  I started reading it on a flight from New York to Paris when I should have been sleeping.  I ended up reading it through the entire flight because I could not put it down.  The suspense grew with the flip of every page. I could not put it down until I was finished with it.  I'm looking forward to reading his newest book, &quot;No Second Chance&quot;.  I hope it can measure up!
B00005JKZV|5.0|this is an awesome movie! i loved in from beginning to end. peter jackson did a wonderful job directing and the cast is great. i could watch this again and again i loved it so much. if you haven't seen it, see it.
B00000GBHA|5.0|When I moved to Detroit's Cass Corridor neighborhood in 1991, and for the ensuing decade, Rodriguez was just a guy I would run into on the street or at the liquor store, or have a drink with.  We actually met because people thought it was funny to see two guys in the same neighborhood walking around in biker boots and black sport coats when it was 90 degrees...  I knew he was a musician (the first time I saw him play was when my band's guitar tech's band opened up for him at a bar down the street), but so am I, and so were half the people who lived there...  When he was \\"rediscovered\\" a couple of years ago, we were all amazed that his music had been so successful (I think he was too!).  Most of us who gigged in and around Detroit played only for the love of music, because before Eminem & the White Stripes, most of us didn't have a hope in hell of getting beyond independent releases and regional tours...  Anyway, Rodriguez is a great guy and an incredible singer/songwriter, and it's wonderful that he's finally getting his due.  The amount of musical talent in this city will never cease to amaze me...  Of course, When you've seen a former Motown superstar singing on the streetcorner (John R & Adelaide) for a ten dollar rock, the fact that the guy down the street is a major international star isn't quite so surprising...!    Dimestore Liam  Detroit
B00008PC2O|5.0|WOW!!!  This is for sure my favorite movie of all time and I doubt I'll ever change my mind.  I'm in love with this movie cause the actors are awesome(Arnold especially), action scenes 24/7, very good special effects for a 91 movie, and storyline is awesome.  I know people who think matrix is really cool since it's like about us being in a computer,etc.  But I'm not a big fan of that.  But the story of how machines become self-aware in T2 is a really good one.  Even thought that would never happen and the movie is kinda sci-fi with Arnold getting sent back in time and all...I don't pay attention to that...this movie is freakin awesome!!! <BR>     Arnold was the perfect guy for this movie and It's all cause of him this flick is such a huge hit.  The whole cast did an awesome job.  I watched this movie countless times...I'm a huge fan. ...<BR>     My favorite scene in T2 is when when that one lady working in that mental hospital punches Arnold's face and breaks his shades...then he just turns his face back and throws her by just shoving her face.  I crack up at that part every time and I'm doing that now that I'm remembering that scene....<BR>     T1 was kinda dumb cause the special effects were really [weak], Arnold was the bad guy, there wasn't that much action like in T2, and all the music sounded like it was from a Nintendo game...lol.  When I heard T3 was coming out I waited forever for that movie to come out and when I saw it I really liked it, but I didn't like it better than T2 because it didn't have John Connor in it and the new vilan (terminatrix) was kinda shady, but still good.  I would give Kristana Loken a 9 and Robert Patrick a 10. ...
B00005R1N3|2.0|After reading several very positive reviews for it, I had to get this movie. I threw it in the DVD player and was fairly disapointed. Its a cool movie, but very SLOW! There are a few jumpy parts, besides that definetly not worth buying. This movie cant even come close to being compared to a great film like Halloween. So overall, Its worth a rent, the killer is pretty cool in some of the things he does, but dont buy it, You'l watch it once and it will be left on the shelf forever......
B00006ALGL|1.0|has lucked out with $$$$$ behind him in the USA... sad but true what cash can do!!!!<br />There are quite a few bands MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH better than Damien in Dublin alone... who have not seen any recognition due to lacking USA $$$ behind them.<br />All you people open you ears to Dublin - one of the greatest music cities in the world... and check out bands like BellX1 and The Frames(incredible!!!!!!!!!), Mundy, ASH, Gemma Hayes even... to many to list...<br />Don;t loisten to the cash... discover Dublin music at it best... and that doesn;t mean &quot;O&quot;
B00008PC2O|5.0|This movie is brilliant all though for those of you with no DVD-Rom drive the second disc is pretty much useless.  But rather than that it was a great movie.  One of the Best Arnold movies to date. Being the Schwarzenegger fan that I am it was the most fanatastic Cyborgie fun I have seen since the original &quot;The Terminator&quot; as T3 rolled around I began to think more of it. It came more to my liking.  It gave me a few jumps here and there.  But thats what Sci-Fi Horror is right?  Oh 1 more thing I recongnied a character in T-2 that appeared in the Nickelodian series Salute your shorts so eat your shorts.  Well Keep up the good Work James Camroon and ROCK ON TERMINATOR~<br />I all most forgot~ <BR>I'm the cream of the crop, I rise to the top<BR>I never eat a pig cause a pig is a cop<BR>Or better yet a terminator<BR>Like Arnold Schwarzenegger
0708980066|4.0|I read the book Rebecca, as a requirement for freshman year, and I have to say, if it were not for the fact that a huge test was looming above my head, I would not have touched the book. In truth, I had started reading Rebecca a long while back, but gave up due to the incredibly detailed, (boring) introduction on her current life without Manderley. So as my first note in writing a review, I'd like to mention nothing too spectacularly exciting will happen for the first 150 pages, so the most you can do is hang tight, and think of how cool it'll be when it skips to the traumatic experiences of Maxim and Rebecca.<br />The story is well written, in appropriately florid speech, understandable only if you reread the section a few times. The characters are developed, though you find yourself annoyed with the narrator, as she is, Incredibly Stupid. Ofcourse, that's how they built the character up to be, but just as a forewarning, it can go from irritating, to aggravating within a few pages.<br />Then, it amazes me that she doesn't mention a name. It is always &quot;The second Mrs. DeWinters&quot;, which also rubs against me the wrong way, especially when you are graded on how well you understand the book, and usually if you don't even catch the first name of the Main Character/Narrator, your comprehension is obviously at fault.<br />However, the gruesome bits where they talk about the murder, will satisfy any morbid curiosity, and I really enjoyed the twist in the end.
6304039328|2.0|I don't find it anything amusing about portraying a mafia hit man in a favorable light.
B00009XITP|5.0|Yes this is a predictable, happily ever after film.  It is nothing like the awful Princess Diaries (which this film has been compared).  Because of this comnparison I didn't bother seeing &quot;What a girl Wants&quot; in the theater.  I am pleased to say that this is one of those films which is just fun to watch.  It wasn't meant to change the world but is entertainment that the entire family can see together.  Amanda Byrnes and Colin Firth are wonderful together as father and daughter.  Kelly Preston is beautiful in the part of Daphne's mother.  In my opinion this film is more like a cross between: Cinderella (because of the future evil step-sister), Snow White (because Amanda finds her prince), and Parent Trap (because....can't say because that would be giving the end away).
B00003CXAE|1.0|This movie is extremely unrealistic with its strange, fabricated view of quasi-1959, but gets away with it because it is a musical.  In some songs it is hard to hear  the lyrics clearly and decipher what they are singing about. Buy it and enjoy it only if you like stories with overtly foolish high school imagery.  Other than that, give it a hall pass and leave it to dissappoint someone else .
B00005JKLZ|5.0|I loved this movie.i seen the teaser and feel in love with the time machine straight away.I even bought a piece of the movie by purchasing the future bike riders out fit.Go in watching this movie with a open mind,some pop corn and a nice large cold coke and you will do just fine .Trust me.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|That's exactly what this movie is \\"spectacular\\"! MOULIN ROUGE takes you on a visual, physical, and emotional journey like no other. It tells the story of a young writer Christian (Ewan McGregor), who comes to Paris in the late 1890's and to the Moulin Rouge, where he quickly gets swept up in its world of sex, drugs, and excitement. Chistian then becomes infatuated with a beautiful courtasan at the Moulin Rouge, Satine (Nicole Kidman). The two star-crossed lovers begin a forbidden love affair, and then Satine must choose between the love of her life, or the highest bidder. The songs and musical numbers in this film are excellent, and very well done, they really add to the emotion of the film whether that be excitement, love, or saddness. This film is extremely colorful and boldly artistic with moments of wild comedy and incredible romance, and drama. The cast is incredible too, especially Kidman and McGregor who shine in this film both singing and acting. I highly recommend this DVD for any fan of this film, it has great special features and takes you further into this great movie. And I highly recommend seeing MOULIN ROUGE, for those who have not. MOULIN ROUGE is truly a \\"spectacular spectacular\\" film.
B00008EY9G|5.0|I think there are two basic types of movie watchers.  The first goes into each film trying to figure it out.  That's the whole goal.  If they succeed, then the movie is \\"predictable\\" and \\"stupid\\".  If not, then the \\"plot made no sense\\" or \\"whole thing was just so boring\\" and other comments.  No way to win.<br />The second type of movie watcher sees the film to enjoy the movie and does not make guessing the twists or the endings the whole goal.  This is me.  Because of this, I was truly able to enjoy \\"Identity\\", especially when the story took its turn.  <br />You see, anyone remotely familiar with great stories in the last hundred years has heard of Agatha Christie's \\"And Then There Were None\\" where one by one people die at the hand of some unknown killer on site, since leaving the scene is impossible.  The killer must be one of them.  For the first hour, this appears to be a retread of this classic tale.<br />At this point in the movie, either you are in category 1 and you hate the film, or you are in category 2 and you love it because it will challenge you and it will hit you hard.  Even if you are able to see the surprise coming, you have to admit that looking through the story it does not cheat.  It stays faithful to the parameters it has set and that's all you can ask.<br />Yes, the acting is good and the screenplay is well executed and editing and all that, but this film does not depend on the actors.  It works well as fiction and I think you could have replaced the actors with other capable performers and not lost much.  Very few people I have spoken with have been real concerned with Cusack's or Liotta's performances.<br />I will admit that the very end seems a little tacked on.  Hollywood seems to have a formula they have to follow and one is an ending like this one.  It works, but it is unnecessary.  The movie actually twists twice and it does not have to.  <br />Just look at the comments throughout these reviews.  Most are either love or hate.  I think some people get mad when movies put one over on them... not me!  I'll be first in line to get the DVD when it comes out.  This is simply one of the most effective horror movies I have ever seen.  It's Hitchcock meets Christie meets Steven King.  I hope you enjoy it.
B00005JLSE|1.0|All style and no substance.  The only bright spot of the movie is Renée Zellweger, truely a great performance (and I am not even a Zellweger fan) however, Richard Gere's performance is way over done.  He really needs to get some more acting lessions under his belt or perhaps it's due to a weak script.  <br />I purchased the DVD expecting a lot more from a movie that won 6 Acadamy Awards including Best Picture and I am going to promptly sell this turkey back.<br />I do not recommend this movie, if you have to see it, rent it.  A real disappointment.

B000002AGM|5.0|What in god's name more is there to say about this recording to someone who has not listened to it, and listened to it all the way through? How about an anecdote from Miles' autobiography--the joy he felt when Dizzy Gillespie came knocking on his door and asked for another copy because he had worn the first one out. &quot;It's the best,&quot; he said. I think I've listened to it more than any other CD I own. Miles on the flugelhorn is perfect. Gil Evans' arrangements are perfect. The choice of tunes--from Dave Brubeck's &quot;The Duke&quot; to Ahmad Jamal's &quot;New Rhumba&quot; to Evans' indescribably beautiful &quot;Blues for Pablo&quot;--are all perfect. Listen to it, and listen to it again.
B00005JMCR|4.0|You know how when you first taste a piece of pie, and it's really good, and you think you want more and more of it, but By the time you get to that third slice, the magical quality that made you love it in the first place has waned and it isn't what it used to be at first?. Well, welcome to \\"American Wedding\\". I'm not gonna say that this doesn't deserve to be in the 'Pie' series, or that it isn't good or enjoyable, because it most definitley is, but there is something missing. I was worried right off the bat when I heard that half the cast, Chris Klein As Oz, Shannon Elizabeth As Nadia, Tara Reid As Vicky, Mena Suvari as Heather, and Natasha Lyonne as Francesca, would be absent from the film. Not only that, but the director's previous comedy was some embarrasing pot comedy. The abscene of the cast is definitley felt, and it's a hard feeling to shed while watching the movie. As the movies have dealt with the progression of relationships and friendships, I guess it is uunderstandable that some friends don't always stay together once they have graduated into adulthood. It happens. Our hero Jim(Jason Biggs), is finally ready to pop the question to band geek/girlfriend Michelle(the adorable Alyson Hannigan), and does so in the film's hilarious opening teaser that stays true to the series' popular, and now famous, opening moments. Jim's best buds Finch(Eddie Kaye Thomas), and Kevin(Thomas Ian Nicholas), are also around, as everyone prepares from the upcoming nuptials. All isn't merry when perennial jock head Stifler(Sean William Scott), stumbles back onto the scene and causes more chaos for the duo as the wedding nears.  Eugene Levy is back as Jim's dad, and he has, thankfully, a larger role here. We even see more of Jim's mom!. Newcomers to the series include funnyman Fred Willard as Michelle's father, and beautiful January Jones as Cadence, Michelle's younger sister. Anyone who is worried that the nice, romantic wedding storyline will overshadow the raunch and comedy ofthe previous two films, will be happy to know that the raunch, sex, nudity, and everything else is still predoominant in the film. It isn't as raunchy as part 2, but it definitley delivers. Scott, as Stifler, is practically the star of the movie, as it seems that the movie focuses a lot more on him than on Jim and Michelle. Sean seems to overdo Stifler way too much this time. It is evident right from the start that he going overboard, and it appears that it isn't so much a Stifler performance, than a Stifler caricature, as so many others have said. Thomas Ian Nicholas as Kevin, must of had nothing else to do. Why else would he appear in a film that barely registers that he's there?. His role is so transparent, that I can't figure out what they were trying to do with him. The direction of the film is a bit off too. There seems to be scenes that might of gone on longer, but were obviously cut short. Some shots cut away to something real quickly and is given the impression that there was more there. Jesse Dylan, the director and, Bob's son, didn't seem to be a great choice, and his work shows that someone else would of been better. The heart of the first film isn't as well done here either. It was a tad shakey in the sequel too, but there's more here than in 2. The acting is as solid and believeable, minus Stifler, as it always has been. I still believe Hannigan to be a wonder. She has come a long way from that flute tuting band dork from the original. Biggs is still a likeable hero, because he is an every-guy type of person. And Levy, well, Levy is just a god. The film is filled with some definite laugh out loud moments, and some nice scene with Jim and Michelle, but it didn't quite hit the bullseye like the original. Part 2 was better, because it felt more like a 'Pie' film. Namely because everyone was there. The raunch is there, the comedy is there, and the sweetness is felt more than the sequel. It's not great art, but it isn't trying to be. This is for the fans and for the people who enjoy these movies. They really won't be disappointed, even though it isn't the same. \\"American Baby\\" practically writes itself.

B0000AI44Q|4.0|....and should NOT be your first Neil Young album.  OK, I am a long-time Neil Young fan and have joked that I would always buy just about anything he put out.  This is kind of in that category; it's probably best for the real Neil Young fan as we follow his great career and is probably about a 3.5 to 4.0 on the scale, if I can try to be a little more objective, for the rest of the music world.  The concert tour for this album was wonderful when I saw it at Merriweather Post in Maryland this summer, but it was Neil's on-stage presence and use of actors (amazingly, an attractive young woman playing Sun Green, which seemed kind of cheese cakey to me!) and amusing props that really carried things.  The music is the classic NY and Crazy Horse sound and the band sounds tight and good together, as guys who have played together so long will, but there are no real stand out classics here (maybe Bandit, the spare, acoustic one?) and nothing very short and punchy or punched-up as well.  There are no great guitar solos, a la Like a Hurricane or Down by the River, if you will; it is more of a folksy rock opera with long ballads best played when you are perhaps taking a long road trip.  Not his best effort, but has some catchy phrasings and memorable lines for the fan.

0060989157|5.0|Motley Crue make Aerosmith look like Cub Scouts.  I was shocked reading this book about how close to death this band came to because of the drugs, alcohol, etc.  Almost every band member had a pretty strange or bad childhood and, at least for Nikki Sixx, is what drove them to the decadent things they would do in their adult years(and I use \\"adult\\" loosely).  A very entertaining read but disturbing at the same time.  Vince Neil to this day has alcohol problems and in this book he attributes it to the death of his daughter Skyler of cancer.  Another surprising moment comes in the book where Mick Mars decribes his health problems that is accelerating as he gets older.  I've heard talk this book was going to be made into a movie.  That would be very interesting to see... hopefully, it won't be lame and it will be true to the book and they will choose the right actors.  This band is lucky to be alive.  It's been 7 years since their \\"reunion\\" CD \\"Generation Swine\\".... hopefully they will return but judging from this book, it does not seem likely.  And to Tommy Lee: stop saying 'dude' and 'bro' every other sentence.  The guy can't even talk correctly in a book!
B000002HAF|3.0|This is a defining record in the development of alt-rock, and I've listened to it more than I can imagine.  But this CD edition has very, very poor sound.  Thin, hissy and FAR too quiet, this has all the earmarks of a quickie CD &quot;mastering&quot; job that is simply run from the original vinyl master tapes without any regard for the CD's unique sonic demands.  But then again, it's a Steve &quot;I'm Too Cool for Digital Audio&quot; Albini record, so maybe he's the one who demanded it sound like a pirated cassette.<br />This record, like Doolittle, deserves a first-class new presentation.

I found myself gasping aloud and gripping my chest at certain parts. The story is an on switch of the imagination which serves to captivate a readers attention.  The idea itself is luring and the story line is addictive. Even when I was not reading the book, it's tone stayed with me everday, even as I dreamed at night, the impression of adventure was always present.<BR> Although some parts are gruesome, even the most sensitive of readers will not skip a line because of the value in every passing scenario.

0553212621|4.0|At the near mention of this book to a mass of people brings forth sexual notions of what people associate this work of literature and most are wrong.  I found this book to be filled with intense emotional loneliness and sadness not the sexual adventure most associat with this final work of DH Lawrence.<br />A story of a woman(Lady Chatterly, Connie) who is married to very self involved man that is made more self involved upon his war injuries and her needs for emotional and physical intimacy.  With her deep loneliness Connie begins an affair with Mellors the GameKeeper on her husbands estate and struggles with the internal morality of loving someone who is of a lesser class and her real love of him.  With Mellors she adores him and needs him away from him she questions herself and feels the shame of her actions.<br />One of the themes I loved about the book was choice.  The ability to make ones own choice and live with the consequences.  Through out the book Connie makes choices she is willing to live with and Mellor never forces his will on her.  She is the Mistress of her Choices and no one else.  I thought it interesting that Lawrence would make her so strong willed on one hand and pschologically lonely on the other.<br />This book is a psychological journey of one woman and the man she loves more than it is a sexual escapade.  I can see how this book was shocking in the late twenties but seems very tame today.<br />I found this book very sad and wouldn't recommend it to someone on prozac or other anti depressant drugs. I also found the writing very eloquent and filled with lots of quiet observations of relationships between men and women that are true today and in the future.  DH Lawrence you could say was ahead of his time or you could say came at just the right time either way you should read his work.<br />This particular book had a introduction and forward written by others that was very insightful.  Also, an afterword written by DH Lawrence himself that again extremely insightful.  It is hard to beleive he was sick through out the writing and publication of this book that is wonderfully written.  Perhaps that is why it is so sad. He kind of says live your life to the fullest in love and sex for life is too short.in extremely insightful.

B00009P1O0|5.0|This is surely the most long-awaited CD release of any album in the classic rock canon. Those of us who have long testified to the sheer power of the songs on this downbeat, chilling and unforgettable set could never understand why 'Harvest' was rated so highly by comparison.<br />'On The Beach' showcases Neil Young's songwriting at its most bitter and at its most beautiful. The funereal Ambulance Blues is the most savage indictment of the cynicism and disillusionment of the post-hippy Nixon-era of the mid-1970s. <br />&quot;I never knew a man who could tell so many lies. He had a different story for every set of eyes,&quot; Neil wails. And then the clincher line which sums up the sense of impotence of many old idealists at that time &quot;You're all just pissin' in the wind. You don't know it, but you are. And there ain't nothin' like a friend......who can tell you you're just pissin' in the wind.&quot;<br />But that's not all. On 'Vampire Blues', Young serves up an acute and angry observation of 'oil crisis' Middle East politics as you are ever likely to hear and one that rings just as true today under the Bush administration.<br />'On the Beach' is not all anger though. 'See the Sky About to Rain' is one of the most lyrical and beautiful country songs Young ever wrote, with a stunning arrangement. 'Walk On' is a song at once fondly remembering the old and more simple days, while making a plea to move on. &quot;I remember the good old days,&quot; Neil sings, &quot;stayed up all night, getting crazed.&quot;<br />This album, for me, sums up the vacuum of the mid-1970s better than any other. But what makes it a classic is that it carries just as powerful a message today - lost idealism, estrangement and the search for personal redemption. All of it is there - 'On the Beach'
6305171769|2.0|In a move similiar to &quot;Godzilla 1985&quot;, this Halloween film dumps its last three or so sequels and starts over fresh from the second film. Jamie Lee Curtis is back as the heroine from said movies. She has faked her death and is now the headmistress of a private school in California. She has a mischeivous son (played by Josh Hartnett) who is hoping to go on a field trip but Mom's past has made her very protective of her family.<br />Of course, Michael Myers is not dead. He has been waiting twenty years for another chance to murder his sister. He also spends a good deal of time going after her son and his buddies. Not to mention LL Cool J as the token black guy. He's the security guard who has more depth than most because he is trying to write cheesy love novels.<br />The aura of horror once surrounded with Michael Myers is lost. Without acknowledging the other sequels, this whole story seems messy. Myers is not menacing. He feels more like the killer from &quot;Scream&quot; or &quot;Urban Legend&quot; here. It is Curtis who becomes this sort of &quot;Liuetenant Ripley&quot; super female. In the fourth and fifth Halloween films, Michael was this sort of evil force who could not be stopped. He attacked in claustrophobic situations and the story very rarely gave control over to his victims. Here, he is just a man in a mask who seems to get &quot;starstruck&quot; everytime someone from a big movie or TV show crosses his path. Kevin Williamson's involvment in this project is far too obvious. He doesn't seem to have a good understanding of what made Michael Myers scary. &quot;Halloween&quot; worked a lot better when there was legitimate fear of what Michael Myers stood for. Curtis spends twenty years in fear of this indivual, only to transform into a femme fatale after running from him for about a half an hour. It is amazing that Steve Miner who did an excellent job with the early &quot;Friday The 13th&quot; movies can't recapture any of the horror magic that is Michael Myers for this movie.Michael Myers for this movie.
B00008BXJJ|5.0|AC/DC is one of the best-selling hard rock bands of all time, yet they have never succumbed to temptation and put out a greatest hits-compilation.<br />But they did release this excellent double live album back in 1992. &quot;Live&quot; contains more than two hours of AC/DC's best songs in raw, muscular renditions, and the sublime set list wisely overlooks the songs from the band's mid-'80s slump and concentrates on hard rock classics such as &quot;Hells Bells,&quot; &quot;Back In Black,&quot; &quot;Highway To Hell&quot;, &quot;Whole Lotta Rosie&quot;, &quot;Sin City&quot; and the bluesy &quot;The Jack&quot;, as well as showcasing the best songs from the band's 1990 album &quot;The Razors Edge&quot;.<br />Brian Johnson's voice may not be as strong as in the early '80s, but he still sounds more than competent, and at no point do AC/DC come off like an ageing rock band just going through the motions.<BR>&quot;AC/DC Live&quot; bristles with energy, Angus Young's solos are as fiery as ever, and the rock-steady Malcolm Young bashes out bluesy riffs and power chords like no-one else seems to be able to do.<br />One of the best live rock albums of the 90s.
6302814359|3.0|Gore-infested sequel to Dan O'Bannon's entertaining original is more or less a retread of the first film. Matthews and Karen return as bumbling grave-robbers who once again get chased by those brain-eating ghouls. This time around, they are really playing it for laughs. There are still elements of horror but the comedy is the star here.<br />The movie opens when the army once again loses a barrel of that top-secret chemical they have been trying to keep under wraps. A group of kids find it stashed away in the graveyard and play with it, resulting in the gas being released once again. Enter Ed (Karen) and Joey (Matthews), two less-than-genius theives who have come to the cemetary to steal jewelry from the tombs. When the dead awaken, it's trouble for everyone as the military quarantines the infected town and a group of panicky people run around, trying to find a way out.<br />\\"Return\\" is nowhere near as good as the original but it does have fun with its script. There are some lightly-hidden references to the first film as well as downright robbing of lines from its script but it's all in fun. It doesn't take such a ridicilous turn that we can't enjoy it (ala \\"C.H.U.D. II\\"). Philip Burns, in particular, as the boneheaded drunk Doc Mandel is really good. The film's leads Dana Ashbrook and Marsha Dietlin are a little too \\"vanilla\\" at times but Suzanne Snyder as Joey's foul-mouthed girlfriend is a definite plus. Genre fans may recognize Snyder from her role in another great cult film, \\"Killer Klowns From Outer Space\\". She is more energetic in this one though as she plays the bratty Brenda very well. She isn't quite a complete mean spirit but she is just snobby and self-centered enough that we enjoy hating her character.<br />What \\"Return 2\\" is missing in substance, it makes up for in gore. This one definetly goes for the juggular or should I say, skull, more than its predacessor. The original \\"Return\\" wasn't exactly a light film either but this one really plays out its bloodlust. If you hated the first movie, this won't make you a fan but those who loved it will certainly appreciate it. It stays true to the series without really offering too much new here and if you're expecting that, you will enjoy.bloodlust.

0312305060|5.0|I read this book a few months after the movie, which I haven't seen, came out. It has one quality which I appreciate above all others (apart from a certain humor) in a novel: conciseness. These days, with so many ambitious American writers trying to write the 'Great American Novel', following in the footsteps of Tolstoy by writing boring, prolix and heavy handed books, it was refreshing to find an ambitious literary work that was both meaningful and short.<BR> <BR> Cunningham's sentences remind me of an article by John Updike about the South African writer J.M. Coetzee, which appeared on The New Yorker some months ago. In it he compared Coetzee's writing to the obsessively pruned trees that line some Parisian avenues.<BR> <BR> In fact, sometimes you wish Cunningham had expanded a little on some of his character's thoughts and ideas. But that happens only a few times.<BR><BR> The one thing I found lacking in this book is humor. Had it not been short, I would have given it 4 stars: you need a few laughs to keep the ride interesting; if art is a reflection of life, a novel without funny moments would feel artificial. The great exception is the surreal dialogue on the first meeting between Mrs. Dalloway 2.0 and her friend Richard, the poet, whose mind has been ravaged by AIDS:<BR><BR>&quot; &quot;Good morning my dear,&quot; Clarissa says again.<BR> He opens his eyes. &quot;Look at all those flowers.&quot;<BR> &quot;They're for you.&quot; <BR> &quot;Have I died?&quot; &quot; <BR><BR> In the end, on the last chapter, as Clarissa and Laura, two characters from two different stories, come together, the main point of the book is driven down, with neither sad despair or happy delusion: that life is a few hours of seemingly infinite joy surrounded by &quot;others, far darker and more difficult.&quot;

0385509456|5.0|The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is a great first book for a great author. The book is written from the first person perspective from the autistic boy's point of view, so it does get drone after a while reading sentences that lack varying sentence structure. However, the content makes up for this. The book itself is superbly logical (to an extent) and will frustrate you to read if you are capable of harboring emotions. What might anger or sadden you to a deep extent doesn't even make a single dent on the main character. This, however, is the treasured heart of the novel; even though the book is filled with drama and emotions, the main character, the person whom all the actions center around, feels none of it. Instead of multiplies numbers in his head, studies for math, reads about space, and counts colored cars.<br /><br />I highly recommend this novel.

0790736918|5.0|Noticing 106 reviews on this film, it has been well covered-and I agree with the 5 star raves and the eloquent commentaries.<BR>A few additonal comments:Co-star Jeffery Hunter would later go on to star in the original pilot of Star Trek-only to pull out at his wife's advice-and we all know what William Shatner did with the part. Monument Valley is stunning and director John Ford photographs it so nicely that the scenery almost takes over the story! Filmakers would leave those scenics to Ford alone, out of respect as if he made the area HIS private portrait studio.<BR>Martin Scorcesse commented that in the last shot of the last scene -John Wayne is standing on the porch (the same set as the opening shot) but this time he crosses his arm a perculiar way-which was a spontaneous gesture of respect for the Western actor  Harry Cary who made that \\"pose\\" his trademark. The older woman in the scene that the camera dollys past as Wayne does this; bursts into tears, off camera. (as she saw Wayne do this.) She was Harry Cary's widow. Having heard that from Scorsese-I get chills of emotion every time I see that ending shot and Wayne's gesture of respect to one of his peers. Wayne is a class act-and he delivers his best performance in this incredibly visual film.
B00005N7Z1|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Sure it was ultra violent, but strangely enough, It wasn't as violent as I expected it to be. There were only two parts I considered extremely-ultra violent. The first one is when ED-209 blasts the OCP guy to death. The second is when Boddicker and his thugs shoot Murphy about 20 times with their shotguns. The part where one of the thugs falls in to the toxic waste is pretty gruesome. The ending is great. It completely sets up for the 2nd movie. I recommend this movie for anyone over the age of 13 who can stand extreme violence.

Well I will of course admit that Linkin park does have talent, they just dont really use it, the guitars are just the same tired old power chords that have been recycled by hard rock and nu-metal bands for ages now. And the rap-rock stuff I keep hearing? how does anyone really like this? I'll admit these guys can play some decent music, but it sure seems like they haven't really tried too hard.. And why i find this cd on the \\"heavy metal\\" shelves at all the cd stores i visit? If this really is the future of rock, so help us.

B000096I9G|5.0|The best part of this DVD is the performance of The Kiss - the last encore.  While the Pornography set burns, Smith gains momentum through the course of the concert.  His creative fires are sizzling by the time we reach Bloodflowers and just explodes through the encores.  The Kiss has always been one of the Cure's best concert pieces, but this rendition is over the top.  I don't know about people who aren't Cured, but CureHeads will definitely love this one.
0553573403|5.0|This is a thick book, but it was not filled with unnecessary parts. What I loved about it is that unlike some authors, Martin knows how to keep you from predicting what's going to happen next, and he doesn't bore you with descriptions for every little thing. He makes the characters seem real and you can identify with some but a warning should be made: You'll feel terrified for the characters themselves because there is constant danger and something &quot;convenient&quot; doesn't always come to rescue them. Martin is really ahead of the game in this genre.
076790592X|5.0|Ive read the book and seen this movie and i must say it brought me to tears. The lessons within this book are priceless, as we all are looking for the big question : what is the meening of life. Ive spent a lot of my time lately on building a business and a career. Im not out of highschool and i spend 3-4 hours daily running it. I havent talked to my parents for more then 30 seconds in over a year. This book HAS changed things for me and it WILL for you. We all will die someday, the question will become how we lived. Thanks for listening.
6305171769|4.0|Awesome. I mean it was a little confusing but awesome all the same. Jamie Lee Curtis plays Michael Myers's sister very well. It was an exellent blood bath like most of the Halloween movies. It was a little confusing trying to figure out which of the two was the REAL Michael Myers. I liked this movie although I wouldn't recommend it for viewers with weak stomachs.

B00005JLKB|4.0|Smallville is truly great. Don't listen to what people say about it being \\"Just another Teen Drama, but with aliens and mutants\\". It's quite simply not. It's more than that. The show was of to a slightly rocky, and very formulatic start. Someone is obsessed with a girl, gets weird mutant powers from Kryptonite, uses them for ill (often involving homecide), and Clark defeats them with his powers, and the mutant dies somehow. But, the show quickly became much more focused on character interaction and drama, something that is sorely missing from the run-of-the-mill Superhero flicks of the 80's and 90's (i.e., the Batman and Superman movies). The show has truly breathed new life into the Superman franchise, and given Superman/Clark Kent an actual character, instead of the no-personality \\"Truth, Justice, and the American Way\\" character that he has always been. He is an actual person now.<br />Season 1 is a bit rough here and there, but it managed to break loose from the formulatic episode structures before it ended, and Season 2 improved on it greatly. I sincerly hope that Warner Brothers re-considers their descision to make the new Superman movie be entirely seperate from the show, as I would very much love to see Tom Welling don the iconic red and blue Superman garb on the big screen. He is Superman, as was Christopher Reeve before him.
B00009XITQ|5.0|Amanda Bynes is a breath of fresh air in our formula world.  Her bright face and wit is a pleasure to watch.  The story line has been done many times, but is still nice to watch.  It is nice to see a clean movie.  Colin Firth is a pleasure to watch.  See it!

B00009P1O0|5.0|With albums like &quot;After The Gold Rush&quot;, &quot;Rust Never Sleeps&quot;, &quot;Ragged Glory&quot; and &quot;Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere&quot; under his belt, it's pretty difficult to say exactly which Young album can be considered his very best.  In my mind it was always 1974's &quot;On The Beach&quot;, which boasted a variety of styles all united by some of the most incisive, emotionally charged lyrics he ever penned.  The previous &quot;Tonight's The Night&quot; (recorded earlier but released one year later) was the powderkeg that ignited his two-year long depression in the mid-70s--a depression shared by many artists at this time including Ray Davies, Robert Wyatt and Stevie Wonder--and &quot;On The Beach&quot; was his painfully resigned resolution to that crisis.  The album as a whole has a lethargic, defeatist feel, tinged with heavy anger on tracks like &quot;Walk On&quot; and &quot;Ambulance Blues&quot; that feels so vile (especially when matched against the slow, deliberate pace of the music), one wonders how Young ever managed to escape that dark, black period.<br />The album begins with &quot;Walk On&quot;, a bittersweet letter to his critics with a jaunty, bouncy feel, that seems low-key at first until placed within the larger context of the album. &quot;See The Sky About To Rain&quot;, a beautiful, melodic ballad originally recorded in 1971 for &quot;Harvest&quot; follows, which proves that the album did contain some accessible material.  That is soon shattered by the murderous &quot;Revolution Blues&quot;, the only hard rocker on the album and so powerful that David Crosby nearly refused to play it on CSNY's 1974 for fear that it would spread &quot;bad vibes&quot; (nonetheless, he plays some fine rhythm guitar on the cut).  &quot;For The Turnstiles&quot; is a short, catchy acoustic piece considered good enough to be included on his &quot;Decade&quot; compilation, and one of my favorites here.  The original side one closed with the drunken eco-rant &quot;Vampire Blues&quot;, which foreshadows the resignation felt on side two, although it is perhaps the only weaker cut on the record.<br />&quot;On The Beach&quot;, &quot;Motion Pictures&quot; and &quot;Ambulance Blues&quot; slow the album down to a crawl by its finish, but are paradoxically three of the most effective pieces in his entire catalog.  They are melodic enough, but performed with such a sense of overbearing weariness and bile that it's no wonder the album was dismissed by fans at the time (however, it did receive outstanding reviews from mags like &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;).  &quot;Ambulance Blues&quot; is a masterpiece of elegant fury, a fractured look back at the singer's past with a nod toward the mood of the nation post-Watergate, with a divine fiddle part matching the slow but stately melody.  By its end, the listener is shellshocked by the mood that has been created, which sounds even better now that the album is finally released on CD--it took 15 years longer than most of his other CDs, but I'm just glad that we finally have it.
B0000029GA|5.0|I had heard all the hype about this album and I had no idea what to expect from it when I got it and I found that I was bobbing my head to every track. Usually when you listen to a hip hop album, there's a couple tracks you can nod too the first time you hear it, but this album, you go to each track and you just start nodding and bobbing. Nas' flow is incredible here, there's NOBODY out there yet who can flow like Nas on this album.
0385335482|5.0|If you need a quick pick-me-up and can't afford a new pair of Prada's, then this will probably do the trick.  Being a classic Shopaholic myself, I found this book to be both hilarious and insightful.  Regretfully, I saw a lot of my former self in this character and I think I learned a thing or two.  Reading this book was a great way to spend my afternoon, however, I think I should have stopped there.  I purchased the next two in the series and it went a bit downhill.  Manhattan is still funny, but you get tired of her antics after a short while.  Wedding is also still funny, but frustrating.  I feel that the frustrating aspect of the wedding book overshadowed the funny.  I would not say that reading the last two was a complete waste of time, but they definitely are not going to make the &quot;bestsellers&quot; list if you know what I mean.
B0000024K1|5.0|Because the mc's have talent, The beats are original and not repeitive, and the lyrics have meaning. Listen to this, and then listen to any current rap cd and notice the astonishing difference, I dare you. See what sub par emcee's like Snoop Dogg and &quot;Fifty Cent&quot; owe their careers to. This cd was revolutionary not only in the rap community but in the world of music as well.<BR>An incredible cd.
B000092Q4U|4.0|Fantastic album this is my first death/thrash metal album and i plan to buy more.I must admit it took me a while to get used to i bought it and regreted it but i thought il listen to it again i like it more and more the more i listend the more i liked it  to it i love the guitaring in this band and love the solos. it also took me a while to get used to the vocilist but i think he is quite kool so i think  you should but it
B00008H2LE|5.0|I'll be honest, after Reanimation I had a hard time accepting Meteora. The wide variety of talent that Reanimation drew was more than any single band could produce, something hard to remember as you expect a new album on the same level. Once I realized that Meteora was created by LP alone, I was able to appreciate its subtleties and the skill that went into its creation. A great album.
6302420458|5.0|If you want to know what really happened in 11,22,1963, watch it, or read the book.<BR>The movie is exciting, Oliver Stone presents the picture in a way that is so easy to understand, and he gives us all the facts, and makes the conspiracy theory easy-enough to follow. This movie will make you question everything - do the CIA and FBI have a hold over the President of the biggest countries in the world? If the said President stands up for his own beliefs, is he in danger of his very life? &quot;JFK&quot; tells us the answer is &quot;yes&quot;,<BR>At the beginning, there is a short biography of JFK and we can see him young.<BR>In addition, the film has phenomenal performances by Kevin Costner  as Jim Garrison, Sissy Spacek as Garrison's long-suffering wife, Joe Pesci as David Ferrie), and Donald Sutherland. In addition to these fine performances are Tommy Lee Jones.<BR>So watch it!
0385495323|5.0|I'm sure everyone is familiar with the idea of the \\"monoalphabetic cipher,\\" wherein a message is written in code by letting one letter represent another.  To the untrained eye, the resulting text looks like gibberish without any structure.  This is the starting point of Simon Singh's excellent primer on the nature of codes and ciphers, and he quickly points out the inherent weakness of the monoalphabetic cipher.  As fans of game shows like Wheel of Fortune know, some letters are more common than others; the cipher is easily broken by frequency analysis - the most common letters in the enciphered text are going to be E, A, and S, for example.  So, in fact, the enciphered text DOES have structure, and it's there for the deciphering by a codebreaker.<br />The strength of Singh's book is its readability and structure.  He introduces various methods of encoding information, points out the weaknesses that were exploited to break the code, then how the cryptographers came up with a new code to foil the codebreakers.  Singh especially stresses the practicality of each method - there are very simple encoding schemes that are actually unbreakable, but also completely impractical for everyday use.  This is especially important to the military - what good is a battlefield code if it takes too long to decode?<br />Early chapters are of historical interest, but also contain codes and ciphers that are very easy to understand, so the reader gets comfortable with the language and problems of cryptography.  Each chapter presents a more complex cipher than the previous, and each time Singh explains it easily, even such convoluted automations as the Nazi Enigma machine.  He offers some fascinating diversions into ancient language elucidation (e.g., heiroglyphics), and eventually ends with a discussion of quantum computers and quantum cryptography.  This is an area especially challenging to explain to the lay reader - based on the other reviews, he has done well.  This section is clearand fascinating to read.  As a chemist familiar with quantum mechanics, I can assure you that the scientific facts are presented accurately, much to the author's credit.<br />Therefore, I highly recommend this book as an insightful, educational, and enjoyable introduction to cryptography.  You will learn a lot, and will enjoy learning it.
B000089RVX|5.0|WOW, I thought that I wouldn't like this CD at all, but I was so surprised. I am not &quot;goth&quot; at all and neither is my friend that recommended this to me, but the songs are all so powerful. I dont think I would put Evanescence in the &quot;gothic&quot; category, because I think that ANYONE would enjoy this cd. I ablsolutely love Amy Lee's voice, and it fits perfectly with the type of music she sings. Although lyrically their songs creep me out a little, I absolutely love the melody that I can sing along to, as well as the violins and choir in the background. Their first single, Bring Me to Life didnt even impress me very much. The rest of the CD, however, impressed me a lot. My favorites songs are:<BR>Going Under<BR>Everybody's Fool<BR>My Immortal (so beautiful, I want to cry everytime I hear it!)<BR>Tourniquet (my absolute favorite!!! Its like a prayer, a cry for help.)<BR>Taking Over Me <BR>Whisper (love the vocals on this one.)<BR>BUY THIS CD!!!! You will not be dissappointed. It's not even really my type of music, I actually came out of my box and listened to something that I never really thought I could ever listen to, and ended up liking it! So dont judge this whole album by their first single, because thats just a very small taste of what they can musically do.
B0000AK7AC|5.0|I rented Babe for a Friday movie night with my fiance who thought I had lost my mind...a movie about a talking pig? Well in a short time she stopped questioning my mental stability(at least as far as this movie is concerned). She strongly agreed that this was a wonderful feel good movie. We have seen a lot of current movies that just left us annoyed by the end, Babe will leave you with a smile on your face. Do yourself a favor and watch it.
B00009RDG9|3.0|This movie had potential a Goverment assassin(Del toro) gone astray,and his former &quot;killing&quot; trainer(Jones) out to hunt him down.This is all great but sometimes its almost funny you have an assasin at the top of his game being hunted by his trainer who has to be twice his age.oh! and (Jones) takes no weapons at all to hunt this man in the woods,thats realistic.But it does get three stars for the actors and for the first 20-30 min.RENT ONLY!
0802130208|5.0|If you love satire, larger than life characters, and need a good laugh--- this book is definitely for you. Ignatius Reilly is an overweight, lazy, super-smart 30 year old who still lives with his mother. His adventures in the world of work are what drives this novel along with his philosophies of life (what he refers to as his \\"world view\\") which are nothing short of hilarious! To say that he is one of funniest characters in all of modern literature would be a gross understatement. Part Don Quixote and part Falstaff, the fun never stops as he makes his way through New Orleans low society. This book won the author a posthumous pultizer prize for literature in 1981. Sadly, the author committed suicide in 1969 after failing to get it published during his lifetime. Thankfully, his mother discovered the manuscript and as they say the rest is history. I've read an awful lot of books in my time and this one remains my far and away favorite. Discover for yourself what makes 'A Confederacy of Dunces' so off-the-wall good. You'll be really happy you did!
B000002I2I|5.0|Hot on the heels of their disappointing fourth album, Soft Parade, and with the horrors of the infamous Miami concert fresh in their minds, the Doors come roaring back with Morrison Hotel, their best set since Strange Days. The opening track alone, &quot;Roadhouse Blues&quot;, is a classic rock staple and one of the very best rock 'n roll numbers of the early seventies. &quot;Waiting for the Sun&quot; (the song, not the earlier album of the same name), builds to a symphonic climax, while &quot;The Spy&quot; continues a theme started by author Anais Nin in her work Spy in the House of Love. Also, &quot;Peace Frog&quot; shows that the Doors are one of the few groups that can shift from the overtly political to the intensly personal in the same song, then slam on the brakes for an incredible slow love song (&quot;Blue Sunday&quot;). In short, Morrison Hotel, is an album for seekers everywhere, who constantly look to define and redefine their place in existence. Besides, it's a great party album!
B00005JM1F|5.0|My wife and i, generally conservative and in our late 40's, watched this one Fri nite when our 2 teenage kids were out. The way the movie started had us giggling at first but as things developed in the plotline we were laughing ourselves into near hysterics, having to pause at numerous places in the show to stop laughing so that we wouldn't miss anything. Others have compared this to an updated &quot;Animal House&quot;, something i wouldn't quibble with at all. I think that anyone who enjoyed &quot;Animal House&quot; would add a gem in getting &quot;Old School&quot; for their DVD library.
0385504209|2.0|I have to say, it was quite a read. Fast. To the point of my husband telling me to turn off the light and go to sleep already.<br />I must agree with the most of the reviewers that once you start, you can't put it down. Or if you do, you don't want to put it down. It does go by fast. For most parts.<br />But is it really factual? There are some vague factual-esque elements in the novel, but that's just it - it's a fictional novel. If you're a baby-christian or a non-believer, you can get suckered into what Dan Brown is trying to pass off as pseudo-fiction.<br />Okay, I had some issues and/or questions too. like, if da vinci was a homosexual man, what was he doing siring so many children? or how about Sir Isaac Newton being a Christian? Do you suppose one can be a Christian and have pagan beliefs? Can one man serve two masters?<br />The little tidbits of information that I read were quite interesting. The character development left much to be desired. What triggered me to the fact that this is nothing more than a fluffy no-brainer summer read is that the author - in lack of better words - [stinks].<br />Was it just me or was i the only one that knew immediately who the baddy was? (I won't say the name because that'd [stink] for someone else reading this review before purchasing it.) I felt like he was \\"chosen\\" as the baddy because Brown couldn't figure out anyone that really could be. It seemed too obvious and too simple. I mean, come on. In the plane, they're all talking about the &lt;stuff>. with Remy and Silas on board in the back!? Great way to be hush-hush.<br />Aringarosa was probably there to throw people off and give it a subplot but he was just a nuisance to the entire story's flow.<br />And honestly... Sophie saw her grampa doing the naughty. So what? Get over it. This really truly annoyed me to no end. She sounded more prissy American or English than French.<br />But what was really sad was how Brown ended the book. He wanted this ridiculous fairytale ending. with some warm embrace and some lip smacking. PLEASE leave the descriptive smut to the writers of authors of romance novels. I mean, in the beginning of the book, he's writing about how Langdon is thinking about Vittoria (the heroine from Angels and Demons, I assume, since I have not read that book) a few times. but - mind you, this entire story happens over a period of like 36 hours - he ends up hooking up with a chick he barely knows? Whiff of her perfume as he leans in and voila! Vittoria who? (By the way, she's not mentioned again for the rest of the book.) Dan Brown, please don't write romance. You obviously [stink] at it. And I read enough smut and chick lit to be able to state this as a fact, not an opinion.<br />So, in a nutshell, some wishy-washy factoid wannabes, obvious antagonist, quasi climax and a really bad letdown, an attempt at religious brainwashing, and soggy plot makes not a great novel. Fast read? yes. Great novel? hell no.with some warm embrace and some lip smacking. PLEASE leave the descriptive smut to the writers of authors of romance novels.

B00003CXXM|3.0|I like Matt Damon (Good Will Hunting). I like Franka Potente (Run Lola Run). I like director Doug Liman (Swingers, Go). I like Julia Stiles. I like Chris Cooper. I was ready to like this film. But how could I? It was really boring.<br /><br />I'm not usually a person who notices interpersonal onscreen chemistry, but there is NO chemistry between Damon and Potente; as a matter of fact, if you told me they hated each other during filming, I'd believe it.  Secondly, the plot is implausible. We never really know why Cooper wants to kill Damon. Would you train a guy who could do all this stuff, and then just wipe him out if one mission went wrong? Finally, and most egregiously, the action is just plain boring. The car chase from the trailer is the movie's best action sequence, and it takes place in the middle of the film.  There is nothing very exciting after that.<br /><br />I had hoped for great scenes of Europe, and what we see of locations in Prague and Paris are beautiful, but they are infrequent.  Julia Stiles and Chris Cooper are utterly wasted.<br /><br />DVD extras are good.  Four deleted scenes, an extended scene and an alternate ending, director's commentary, a Moby video, a 14-minute featurette/promo, a trailer, production notes, cast & crew credits, and DVD-ROM features that will work only on Windows machines.<br /><br />Many people here seem to have liked this film, so maybe you will too, but if you decide to see it, do yourself a favor and rent it.

0345440900|5.0|Our baby was sleeping through the night after 8 weeks.  When we tell people they are envious and think that we just got lucky and have a good baby but it is because we followed the advise of the &quot;Baby Whisperer&quot;. <br />This book has been our prime reference book for the first 9 months of my baby's life.  I have given it as a present to everyone I know who is pregnant.  I think this is the best book out there for helping parents understand their infant's personality and how to respond to their crying.  <br />The book explains that babies have different personalities. Once you know your baby's personality type, you can respond to her needs much better. The book helped us understand why our baby seemed to be so hypersensitive and cry for no reason. It is because she is a touchy baby. The book explained that we need to be aware that touchy babies are easily overstimulated.  We followed the advise and have been very sucessful in keeping our baby calm and happy. (Now she doesn't cry much.) <br />The book has very helpful advise on many of the behavioral issues that come up in the early months of a baby's life especially the issue of teaching a baby how to sleep.  The book explains that parents can accidently do things that will cause their baby to develop poor habits such as the inability to sleep through the night or the need to feed hourly. The book is not meant to be a complete guide to baby care so you may need one of the &quot;HOW TO&quot; books to go along with it.   <br />We have recently purchased the follow-up book for Toddlers now that our daughter is 9 months old.  Already it has been helpful in understanding some of her new toddler behavior.  I feel confident that it will be as helpful for us as the first book.
0385335482|4.0|Sophie Kinsella has hit the nail on the head with this series. I saw it from across the store and figured it couldn't be too bad if it involved shopping. Sophie's characters are funny, witty, smart, evil (when they need/want to be), and a downright pleasure to read about. I took this book with me on vacation thinking that it would not get read except for when I was on the plane. Boy was I wrong!! Even if shopping is not your thing, this book is wildly entertaining and well worth the read.

B0000A4GAK|4.0|Another first class offering from mr. TRUCKS. More JAZZ than JOYFULL NOISE and not quite the variety. However, a TRUCKS cd without a lot of variety is almost impossible. I just mean that there are no arabic or spanish tracks as on JOYFULL NOISE. There is till the superb trademark slide, the interesting covers and the unorthodox interpretations of standards in the inimitable TRUCKS style. I have only listened to this a number of times and in time it may well turn out to be another 5 star offering. On first listen it just doesn't have the impact of JOYFULL NOISE.
B00004LN16|2.0|It´s unbeliavable the lack of auto-criticism of these guys! Can it be possible that Brian Johnson (and the Young brothers) hear his vocals and do not realize that it´s gone forever? Can´t he see tha his voice now is simply annoying, tuneless, without any vocals inflections, no change between songs?<br />Ac/DC has been mocking his fans for a long time. Why? Because they simply don´t care anymore. That´s the only reasonable explanations for releasing twelve identical songs that repeat their choruses over and over againa; for Phil Rudd´s worst drumming ever; for Johnson lack of voice; for Angus ludicrous solos; for the lyrics reaching an all time low (giving sequence to the obnoxious lyrics of BALLBREAKER).<br />It seems they are having fun and trying to live under the motto: &quot;The worse, the better&quot;, and trying to compose the worst album possible.<br />In the old days, AC/DC were simple, nasty, but with tons of &quot;charm&quot; in their rock and roll. Now they´re just a parody of themselves, they´re just &quot;cheap&quot; and mean.<br />By the way, Angus, if I see you in concert, I don´t care at all if you still use that silly school uniform. You can get rid of it. All I would like to was to hear some singer who can sing.
B000002JSP|5.0|I'm 21 and I started getting in Led Zeppelin about a year ago tops. I sincerely have to appreciate whatever influenced that because I otherwise would have been largely ignorant of the greatest band ever.<br />That having been said I've rapidly begun to realize that there are those who would deem themselves &quot;Zeppelin purists&quot; and enjoy the hard rock, the Willie Dixon covers and the other blues stuff. Maybe having been influenced by music of a different era than the core of Zep-fans what I take away from the band or, in other words, my experience, is probably different.<br />On the local classic rock station I heard Carouselambra for the first time and fell in love. Forget the fact that it's synth heavy and it lacks guitars. The song just absolutely does wonderful things throughout its duration. The nonsensical lyrics remind me of some of my other favorites bands of later times (the Meat Puppets come to mind). What's also interesting is that I've noticed with most songs John Paul Jones will follow the lead guitar but in this song the bass stands out more than ever and it's again obvious why he's so great. And it's powerful! I love to role down the windows and let it play loud. From beginning to middle to end...it just blows me away. I particularly like how with 6:30-6:00 remaining in the song it completely slows down and I hear it and I feel like I'm dreaming a wonderful dream. Clearly, Zeppelin has demonstrated its imagination and ability to display increasingly dynamic abilities and ideas. <br />Speaking to the album as a whole...it's just all over the place. And that makes it fun. I can understand however that if you were raised on Led Zeppelin I-IV then this is quite a shock!<br />In the Evening is an interesting start. As others might say it still reminds of you of early Zeppelin. South Bound Suarez is fun and it moves and the piano makes it rather interesting. Fool in the Rain was never really a favorite growing up (and it got a lot of radio play) butI agree with one reviewer that Page's solo is very Steely Dan like - which I view as certainly a big compliment to another great band. All of My Love is very heartening.<BR>I find both the closing track and the album title to be ominous in retrospect.<br />This is an awesome album and represents evolution, progression and development. For me, it brings me out of time and makes me smile and have fun.
B00005JKDQ|5.0|Honestly, I didn't enjoy monster inc as toy story2.<BR>but this dvd is awesome! It's fully loaded with bonus, games, short movies etc.<br />the best part is the academy award winner short animation: for the bird. it's sooo funny!!!<br />and don't forget to watch 'the charade' trailler. I still laugh after watching it over and over again...<BR>&quot;two words?, movie?, star wars...&quot; :))
B000002JSJ|5.0|Achilles Last Stand is what turned me into a Led Zeppelin fan. No song I've heard takes such raw energy, builds it up and then with an on-your-mark-get-set-go just takes off and completely wows and amazes you at every turn. The bridge, containing an amazing solo from Page (3:40-4:50) just blows me away and makes me want to hit the gas pedal. I can't say enough about this song...It brings out the best in all 4 musicians.<br />For Your Life has some great bass work. Royal Orleans is another great great one and the guitar is terrific. Nobody's Fault but mine doesn't do much for me, sad to say. Candy Store Rock has lots of good movement. Hots on for Nowhere is a lot of fun and will make you wanna sing along. Tea for One is a nice slow way to end the album with some very good blues-like guitar.<br />Presence shouldn't be overlooked. No Zeppelin song rocks and moves with such feeling and raw energy than Achilles Last Stand. I stand by that.
B00005JLSE|5.0|I loved the movie and I love the DVD.  Sure Rob Marshall keeps everything moving--perhaps too fast.  But in the end, you're astounded by Catherine Zeta-Jones' superb Velma.  You know that if everybody from this cast performed a song from this show live on Broadway, everybody would get nice applause, but Zeta-Jones would receive a standing ovation.  She's got the energy, the dancing, the stage chops to make her center of attention.  All the rest of the fine cast are never less than professional.  In the case of Queen Latifah, we have a young performer the camera loves and she's nearly on Zeta-Jones' level.  Their cut duet which is an extra on this extra-packed DVD is sensational.<br />I have enjoyed Renee Zellweger in many films over the past six or seven years, but she's not a natural born musical comedy performer.  She works hard, and when she's not singing or dancing, her actress skills serve her well.  But next to Zeta-Jones in their dazzling finale, she simply working too hard.  And I wish she'd gained a few more pounds.  Zeta-Jones looks as willowy as her glorious figure will allow, but Zellweger is painfully thin.  <br />You gotta give Richard Gere credit.  He goes completely against type and delivers a surprisingly wonderful performance.  <br />The quick cuts, and zooming scenes made me almost as dizzy as I was watching MOULIN ROUGE.  Rob Marshall does know he's got to work with an audience of short attention spans.  But the film's energy is contagious.  It's gorgeously filmed and beautifully mounted.  I had my doubts when the filming was announced.  I was exhausted by all the previous stars attached to this film.  Not since finding Scarlett O'Hara has casting been so difficult. <br />The DVD packaging is sensational.  Get it for Zeta-Jones' gloriously gorgeous Velma, and enjoy a cast going gamely through their paces.  The movie musical ain't dead yeat.  More please.
B0000A7W14|5.0|It's about time this movie comes out in a re-mastered edition! It's now a 2-disc set....I hope the 2nd disc is worth it!

B00005JKN9|3.0|Are you reminded each day of the violence in our inner cities? Are you close enough to your politicians to overhear their careless confessions of corrupt practice? One and a half centuries of what is referred to as \\"civilization\\" have brought advances that allow many of us to avoid daily strife and allow our elected officials to avoid close scrutiny. If you are in the unfortunate situation of facing constant urban turmoil and poverty, then Gangs of New York wont seem so strange to you (if you have a working VCR and either the money to rent the film or the gumption to steal it).<br />But for many Americans, Martin Scorseses vision of yesteryear in NYC will seem as bleak and foreign as any cyberpunk landscape interpolated from the darkness of todays reality. The year is 1863, and The Civil War is on. Tension is high in New York as \\"innocent\\" northerners are sent to fight. Perhaps Scorsese uses peoples historian Howard Zinn as a reference, because he quickly debunks the notion that the northern states are fighting for the morality behind emancipation. Instead, many northerners remain staunch racists, and the true motives for the war are political and financial interests.<br />The split between the wealthy and the poor is wide; and folks are especially destitute in Five Points, the Irish ghetto. The film actually begins sixteen years before the Civil War, at a time when Five Points is undergoing a civil war of its own. Clans of new Irish immigrants take up arms against clans of first-generation Irish-Americans, who cruelly lord it over the newcomers. These \\"natives\\" are led by Bill Cutting the Butcher, played with fearsome flair by Daniel Ari Day Lewis. <br />The street fight concludes with the immigrant leader, a Catholic clergyman named Vallon, dead at the hands of the Butcher. Vallons wee son escapes to spend the next sixteen years growing up to be Leonardo DiCaprio. When Amsterdam Vallon returns to the neighborhood, it is with the drive of vengeance.He perpetrates this by wriggling \\"under the wing of the dragon\\" as he puts it, becoming the Butchers favored henchman. <br />But the road is shaky and the path untrue. Friends betray him, and his fathers memory, and many of his well-laid plans gang aft a-gley. However, he does manage to swing a girlfriend, Jenny the thief, Cameron Diaz, with his good looks and grungy nobility.<br />As a second showdown between The Butchers natives and Vallons Irish influx begins to coalesce, the Northern U.S. government passes a mandatory draft--mandatory unless you are well-heeled enough to pay $300 to be excused. This puts New Yorks poor masses in an uproar that sparks the Civil War Draft Riots of 1863. The bloody and tragic fracas lasts five days, overshadowing the battle between Vallon and The Butcher. <br />The dust settles at last and Scorsese tries his best to stay with a happily wobbling denouement for a few minutes. Though the production values were much higher, the ending somehow reminded me of the classic 70s kung-fu movie ending, when, after the last big fight, the hero stands up, and a second later, the credits roll. To dwell on the triumph of the good guys would be too sentimental, and nobody has any energy left for more fighting.<br />In general, the film is very well made. The costumes deserve awards, and I sure wish I knew where to get of one of those dandy outfits. The settings are amazing, so foreign from our contemporary idea of city-dom that the Mrs. thought we were in for a science fiction film at first, something along the lines of Mad Max. As for acting, Lewis is superb in his role, fully embodying the dastard and delivering chillingly heartless diatribes. DiCaprio and Dias look nice. <br />With all this dressing, the story rides along easily, not needing to contain too much importance or relevance. Though the battles are bloody, the action intense, and the drama high, these characters dont engage a viewer apart from being historically interesting figments. DiCaprio will appeal to his fans because he often slips out of his shirt, to reveal a chest flecked with aesthetically pleasing scars, and out of his character, revealing the modern-day actor behind the two-dimensional vengeance seeker.<br />Call Gangs of New York an \\"external drama\\": all the real conflict happens in the context surrounding characters, not within them. And with that distinction made, we can see the film as a portrait of New York City in its troubled adolescence. Though the writers cast some thematic grappling hooks from 1863 to 2003 in an attempt to establish relevance, they dont tug the two time periods toward each other with any real enthusiasm. Single lines indicating how political clout is saleable, for example, are thrown out, and then left slack.<br />If you are keen on adventure and action--and goodly helpings of stage blood--then you will enjoy this movie more than average. It has romance and melodrama, like Gladiator. At any rate, its pretty exciting and excitingly pretty.
B00005JLSE|2.0|I don't know what all the hype is about this movie. The money I spent to rent this movie was by far the WORSE way to use my money! It is NOT even a good musical!<br />Save your money and rent something else!
B00009P1O0|5.0|Neil Young never wanted to be a star -- he just wanted to be a musician. So when the business of fame started to intrude on his artistic life, Young simply would pull back and produce something that was surely going to chagrin the record companies and alienate \\"fans\\" that were looking for the next \\"Heart of Gold.\\"<br />Such is the case with \\"On the Beach.\\" As mentioned by previous reviewers, this album was the third in a triology of dark albums that resulted from Young's disdain of the commercial success of \\"Harvest,\\" his ongoing mercurial relationship with longtime girlfriend, actress Carrie Snodgrass and, of course, the drug-related deaths of fellow Crazy Horse guitarist Danny Whitten and roadie Bruce Berry.<br />While the result is not the glossy commercial endeavor that sends record company execs into joyous spasmatic convultions, it is none-the-less one of Young's most artistic triumphs. \\"On the Beach\\" is a raw, emotion-filled testimonial to where Neil Young was in the world at the time.<br />The CD kicks off with \\"Walk On\\" -- Young's answer to critics, fans and friends who thought he had clearly lost his mind with his two previously efforts: \\"Tonight's the Night\\" and \\"Time Fades Away.\\"<br />\\"I hear some people been talking me down<BR>Bring up my name - pass it round<BR>They dont' remember the happy times<BR>They do their thing, I do mine.\\"<br />\\"Walk On\\" is an infectious, accessible tune that boogies unrepentedly, and could have easily been a big hit had not it been part of a largely darker album.<br />Probably the most outstanding track (and most controversial) on the record is \\"Revolution Blues\\" -- a rollicking rocker (with a trademark incendairy guitar solo) that was inspired by Young's encounter with a then-aspiring songwriter named Charlie Manson. Young wrote the song in the wake of the Tate/LaBianca murders -- and though it's not an historical account of the crime, the lyrical content has several chilling passages:<br />\\"It's so good to be here asleep onyour lawn<BR>Remember your guard dog, well I'm afraid that he's gone<BR>It was such a drag to hear him whining all night long.\\"<br />and ...<br />\\"I hear that Laurel Canyon is filled with famous stars<BR>But I hate them worse than lepers,<BR>and I kill them in their cars.\\"<br />Is it any wonder David Crosby didn't want to play it on the next CSN&Y tour? As for me, I can't stop playing it. It's something no other rock star could pull off. Simply an amazing song.<br />Another quirky favorite of mine is \\"For the Turnsyles,\\" where Neil picks haltingly away at the banjo while Ben Keith squeezes some odd banshee-like wails from the dobro. The singing is quintessential Neil -- high, mournful and lonesome.<br />\\"Ambulance Blues\\" is a hauntingly beautiful peace, epic in both length and emotion. \\"Vampire Blues\\" is an amusing look at the ethics of the oil industry (\\"I'm a vampire baby, sucking blood from the earth -- I'm a vampire baby, sell you twenty barrels worth...). It's kind of ironic that Young would write such a lyric when he has a well-known penchant for big Detroit gas guzzlers. But then again, Young never held himself up as a role model to anyone.<br />This is simply a dizzingly wonderful album that gets better and better with each subsequent play. Its release in CD format has been too long in coming and if you're a Neil Young fan, this is a must-have addition to your collection.
B000001DWG|5.0|I bought this CD because I heard the version of Chloe Dancer/Crown of Thorns in the Singles Soundtrack. I was hoping to hear something like Ten of Pearl Jam but it is very different from it,the first question that come to my mind was What if Andrew Wood were Still Alive?, What would happen to Pearl Jam?. I think when Andy died Stone and Jeff were looking for someone different to Andy,and they find Eddie Vedder, although I rather Eddie Vedder's voice. This is  good Cd with good vocals, music, and song writing, it is sad that Andy died but let's see the good part in this loss, his dead allow the world the hear Pearl Jam and temple of the Dog one of the best rock band's

038542471X|5.0|This book is one of my favorite books written by Grisham.  I have read several of them.  The book was made into a movie and I enjoyed watching it more than once. I think what I like is that an eleven year old boy ends up having a certain control of the  situation for the most part.  He hears a secret from a mob lawyer who commits suicide and now the law wants his testimony but the boy is scared for his family if he tells what he knows.  He finds a woman lawyer who has her own personal problems, but decides to help him.  Both the mob and the law end up searching for him and there are many thrills and suspenseful events before the story is over.

B000002UJQ|5.0|Oh sure, Radiohead gets lots of praise in the music press, and has a real core of mid-20ish absolutely rabid fans, but behind all of that must be something fueling this other than simple long-running hype, right? The answer is OK Computer. Having been one of the loads of post college kids who bought their previous 'cool' but still pop-friendly album, The Bends, after heavy MTV rotation in 96' I was startled by the new chords and bravado and even mystery immediately found on OK Computer's first few listens. 'How could this be the same band,' I wondered? In the end I gave it up to deus ex machina.     6 years later OK Computer seems a true defining moment for music concerned with the basic human themes of frustration, fear, and release, but also a defining moment for the political meanings of broadening rock's (still) limited focus. OK Computer draws equal inspiration from 20th century European new classical music as from the suprisingly dark notes to be found within standard pop, such as the Beach Boys of all places. The formula is wherever release from self repression can be found then borrow, blend, and create.     OK Computer suprises on relistening at how it channels both frustration and the ecstacy of just being done with it all... 'Whew,' as it were.  Think of that emotional release that comes after a pounding Beethoven or Bartok piece and then recylce that feeling through left field guitars and vocals. 'Hell yeah!
B000092ZYX|4.0|the thing with bands like radiohead is that we have come to expect a little more from them than we would from others.  let me start by saying that this is a good album.  it is not thier best by a long way; it re-enforces the foundations set by Kid A and Amnesiac....it seems that Radiohead have opted to stay in a holding pattern rather than try to break new ground.<br />when i look back at the radiohead albums, they kind of documented my growth as a person....from the raw Bends to the extrordanary OK Computer to a very mature and well produced Kid A.  So for their next effort (here i ignore Amnesiac as it was a little bit of this and that which should never have been released as an album) I was hoping to hear something different.<BR>but on this album the formula, though refined, remains much the same.....thom has one of the most incredible voices, but chooses to continue to use it to whine (it's time to get over it!) and johnny is ultra-amazing with his electronics and has used every new album to show us how much better he has become (to the point where the music sounds so so contrived).  <br />so this album, however great it is, didn't meet my (huge) expectations and thus i am disappointed.  but go out and buy it (or copy it !) becuase they are still the most intellegent band around.<br />and in ending a little plea from a radiohead fan...for the next one throw away all those electronics.  they are stripping the soul from radiohead.
B000063DHL|2.0|This follow-up to the sublime Powerslave is rather weak. Part of the problem is the new sound they are using. The compositions themselves are obviously in the tradition of Iron Maiden but they come off sounding very flat compared to other Maiden discs. Sounds more like prog rock than straight heavy metal.<br />The best part of this disc is the superb lead guitar work by Dave Murray and Adrian Smith. They really play with a lot of feel. The solos are fast in the tradition of good metal but also melodic.<br />The worst part of the disc is Bruce's vocals and some of the lyrics. Bruce is trying to sound operatic on some of the songs and he is just not up to the task. Sometimes he sounds like a howling old lady. <br />Some of the lyrics take a stab at being deep but come across as just silly - Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner being the main culprit. Alexander the Great was an attempt at doing another Rime of the Ancient Mariner. The Rime, adapted from Samual Taylor Coleridge (sp?), is a piece of epic metal genius. Alexander the Great sounds like Bruce is reading the lyrics out of a high school text book on European History. Simply foolish.<br />To sum up, the approach here is obviously similar to Powerslave but the results do not even compare. Somewhere in Time is one of Maiden's weakest.

0553573403|5.0|I spent quite a while staring at the blank screen in front of me to come up with a fitting description of A Game of Thrones by George RR Martin.  Should I compare it to the classic Lord of the Rings for its impressively epic scope?  Would it be best to focus on the honest, often painful humanity of the many characters - so rare in a fantasy novel - that personalizes each point of view?  Perhaps I could impress other customers here with the sheer brilliance of a plot that weaves so many seemingly disparate stories together to form a believable alternate universe in which not only politics, intrigue, war, adventure and romance can coexist plausibly, but magic as well.  How could I do such a work justice?<br />I might as well get this part out of the way first.  Obligatory Synopsis:  in a fantasy continent that bears a familiarity to Middle Ages England, Winter is coming.  Winter in this world means a sort of mini ice age that will last for seven years before receding. In the always-frosty Northern area, the races of nonhuman beings are gathering to advance with the snows; there are hints that there is an ancient, evil power behind their forces.  At the same time in the South, political infighting for the Throne has begun. Overseas, the daughter of the dispossessed former King is maneuvering forces of her own for a bid for the throne.  All this is told through the various stories of both \\"good guys\\" and not-so-good guys.<br />For starters, AGOT can't be accurately compared to any other book or series in the Fantasy genre (not without insulting it).  The nearest thing of its type is the laborious Wheel of Time series by Jordan - see what I mean? And yet this first in the Song of Ice and Fire series is fathoms above that aimless, droning style.  Martin has perfected what Jordan had arguably introduced; the multiple characters' points of view telling the vast saga on an intimate, up-close scale.  Never did I feel that I was being strung along, but rather lead by increments toward an incredible revelation somewhere up ahead.  Martin builds the suspense masterfully in each book.<br />But by far the most striking thing about the Song of Ice and Fire is the \\"rules\\" that the author breaks.  Martin is not afraid to tell the tale from the point of view of some very unlikable, even immoral characters.  He is bold about revealing facts from a character's past that challenge one's impressions and assumptions about their ethics.  He does not lay all his cards on the table up front, but rather unexpectedly reveals details that later change the whole picture and twist the plot admirably.  And his most unusual move: this author even allows \\"favorites\\" to die occasionally (no names here...)!  These risks pay off well to serve the story as a whole, bring a sense of true humanity to the people of this world and drive the reader on to the next series installment.<br />It's just too bad that I can't magically transplant my sense of admiration for AGOT onto this page.  Hopefully, you are intrigued enough to give it a try; it would be a shame to miss what IMHO could be the best series of the decade.<br />-Andrea, aka Merribelles toward an incredible revelation somewhere up ahead.

B00005JMC6|5.0|This film was so good, so vivid and so moving that it made me homesick for New Zealand and the wonderful Maori people who befriended me.  I was only priviledged to live there 3 years but I would have given up my US citizenship to have stayed.  The film was especially meaningful to me because I recognized the area and have seen the war canoes in areas where I have dived the waters. My only criticism is that so many pakeha here in this country do not understand the meanings of some of the traditions shown.
B0000027D5|5.0|This album comes from a 1973 tour of Japan to support the Caravanserai album. It was originally released in 1974 only in Japan. It was a 3 LP set with some nice oddly shaped fold<BR>                             out posters. If you wanted it, you had to buy the Japanese import at a very steep price. It now comes in reasonably priced CD. On most versions of the CD, the artwork is intact but shrunk to CD dimensions, so it is nearly impossible the read the printing.  <br />The sound quality of the original LP was very good.  To be honest, I haven't heard the CD version, but other reviewers complained about the sound.  This might be one of those times when a poor job was done transferring the music to CD's.  In the early days of CD's, many CD's had very poor sound quality.  That is why people thought CD's were inferior to LP's.  And that is why you see many CD's advertising Digital Remastering, to distinguish themselves from the poor quality earlier releases of the same album.    <br />                             The Santana band was in transition. Greg Rollie and Neal Schon had left to form Journey. The group's sound had changed to a much richer, and deeper sound. Instead of being<BR>                             &quot;lighter&quot;, more accesible Latin sound with pop type vocals, it was now a darker, multi layered sound, with any vocals being in the background.<br />                             For the tour, the group played a style that was a mixture between the styles of Abraxas and Caravanserai. The music is a little brighter than Caravanserai, but it is very intense<BR>                             and high energy. They just start playing and don't stop. Incident at Neshabar is an incredible, exhausting 16 minutes. The finale of Toussaint L'Overture will leave your head<BR>                             spinning. For this tour, they bring along Leon Thomas for vocals, but he doesn't have much to do.<br />                             I saw Santana in Tucson during this tour, shortly after this album was recorded. By then, they became completely unaccessable to the audience. They played in front a big, tilted<BR>                             mirror, so you got an enlarged view of their backs. They just got up and played. They did not talk to the audience at all. In addition, they dropped all the hits from their setlist. People<BR>                             in the audience started spreading a rumor that Carlos Santana wasn't even with the group on stage. In spite of the group's aloofness, it was a fantastic show. Weather Report was<BR>                             the opening band. As always, Santana brought out the members of the opening band to jam on the encore.

6302491940|3.0|This cult classic has an unsatisfactory first half, but boasts a spectacularly entertaining, and justly famous, second half. The patchy script has Michael Caine heading up a heist in Turin with the help of jailed criminal mastermind Noel Coward, in a welcome cameo. As the heist itself gets under way, director Peter Collinson delivers first-class thrills with a cheeky sense of humour. The production is lensed brilliantly by veteran cinematographer Douglas Slocombe, best known, perhaps, for the Ealing comedies of the 1940s and '50s; his presence here reinforces the sense of Britishness with which the film has become associated.
B000069HK2|5.0|This is such a great CD. Every song is excellent. I've been a huge fan ever since I first heard the band. I had the honor of being able to see them live on Warped Tour 2003 this summer. They were the last band performing and definitely the best. That is saying a lot, considering the other bands that also perfomed (The Starting Line, The Ataris, Mest, Coheed and Cambira, Brand New, The All-American Rejects, Thrice). Buy this CD, it is amazing.

0380820846|5.0|Just when I think that Julia Quinn has written one of my favorite novels, she writes another that I like even better. Quinn is now at the height of her creative powers so far, able to create an intensely warm, charming and vastly entertaining story that simmers with passion, tenderness and depth. The last chapter before the epilogue actually moved me to tears.<br /> Penelope Featherington (whom we know from all previous Bridgerton novels) is 28 and has been in love with Colin Bridgerton since she was 16. Unfortunately for her, Colin barely knows she exists, though he has always been friendly and kind to her. As Eloise Bridgerton's best friend, Penelope has spent a lot of time at the Bridgerton home and is considered practically a part of the family, especially now that she and Eloise are both spinsters.<br /> Colin (who's 33 and still not married) returns from one of his many long voyages abroad, and somehow Penelope seems different-or maybe he's different. He's not sure. As they're thrown together, he begins to notice admirable-and highly attractive qualities-in her that he's never seen before. But suddenly Penelope glimpses darkness and fear in the supremely confident Colin she's always loved. What is the secret he's keeping from her? And can their beautiful developing friendship grow into love?<br /> Here is a novel in which telling the external plot (which revolves around everyone trying to figure out who Lady Whistledown is) gives no guide to the treasures within. This novel is about character and dramatic situation. The characters themselves grow and keep growing on the reader. The Bridgerton family is endlessly delightful. Colin and Penelope especially seem so real that it's hard to believe they're fictional. Colin's own travel writing is exquisite-a joy to read. And there are some really priceless scenes-like the madcap one in which Colin asks Penelope's mother for Penelope's hand: pure and vastly entertaining comedy!<br /> The identity of the wonderfully wise and witty Lady Whistledown is finally revealed here, and my having guessed who she was three novels ago didn't diminish the pleasure in the least.<br /> Romancing Mr. Bridgerton is a complex, mature and vastly entertaining work that no romance enthusiast should miss!
B00005JKC3|4.0|Though the origin story was changed dramatically, the movie stays true to the original essence of the comic book.  I actually enjoyed the movie, even though the pacing was not what one would expect for a comic book film.  The acting was fantastic for this type of movie.  Yet, I can see what many critics disliked about this movie--slow pacing and the cliched mad scientist experimenting on himself.  If you are a fan of these types of movies, then I would recommend a purchase.  If not, it's a good rental.

0385504209|5.0|This was a great, quick read.  Often when I read mysteries or suspense novels, I find them to be poorly written and glaringly obvious.  Often they are so outlandish that you are unable to lose yourself in the fiction of the story.  Not so here.  This story is fast-paced but well-crafted and well-researched.<br />The story begins as Jacques Sauniere, the top executive of the Louvre, is murdered.  Robert Langdon, Harvard professor of religious symbolity, is immediately suspected because of a note Sauniere left at the scene of his death.  Sauniere's grandaughter, Sophie Nouveau, is a cryptologist with the French equivalent of the FBI,and becomes involved upon learning of the death message.  The parties learn that Sauniere was actually grand master of the Priory of Scion, an ancient organization dedicated to keeping a secret about Jesus Christ that would devastate the Catholic Church and Christianity in general.  Obviously, the Catholic Church is also seeking the secret kept by Sauniere--in order to destroy any evidence of it.<br />This novel features an elaborate cat and mouse game.  Sauniere's killer is pursuing Robert and Sophie.  Robert and<br />Sopie, meanwhile, are attempting to decipher code after code left by Sauniere which will ultimately lead to the secret.<br />Largely based on an actual alternate theory about Mary Magdalene and Jesus, I found this novel's research into Paganism and the Catholic Church to be fascinating.  I am not sure how much of the novel is accurate, but prominent people throughout history have subscribed to this theory. I looked back at Leonardo Da Vinci's painting of The Last Supper after reading The Da Vinci Code. I was able to see the symbols and clues described by Dan Brown concerning Mary Magdalene and the Apostle Peter.<br />This is an intelligent thriller.  I was never bored, and couldn't wait to plow through all 450 pages.  The chapters are also very short, which I find annoying in some books but added to the novel's fast pace in this case.  Surely this book is detested by the Catholic Church, but the controversial nature of the story makes it all the more interesting.his case.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|The dialogue is very often very witty, the setting is an interesting universe, the storylines, although just starting to emerge are intriguing -- this show is well worth the time and money<br />It's a HUGE disappointment to me that the network cancelled it.  Big thumbs down for them.
B00005RYKU|5.0|After an impressive number of supporting movie roles, the lovely Leelee Sobieski takes center stage in this impressive psychological thriller, delivering a performance I found both wonderful and, most importantly, believable.  While the plot may not be all that original and unpredictable, I found The Glass House to be an absorbing, suspenseful movie that never relented in its building psychological intensity.  Anyone who sets out to hurt a character played by Leelee gets my full attention and disdain, but the evil husband and wife responsible for all the villainy espoused in this film do an excellent job of deserving all the disgust I felt for them.<br />While Miss Sobieski looks a tad older than the sweet sixteen age of her character Ruby Baker, her natural sweetness and vulnerability make her quite convincing as a normal young teenager whose life is thrown into chaos when her parents are killed in an automobile accident.  Ruby and her eleven-year-old brother Rhett (Trevor Morgan) go to live with Terry and Erin Glass (played quite impressively by Stellan Skarsgard and Diane Lane), their former neighbors and designated custodians.  Their new home is an impressive, unique structure with many glass walls and an ultra-modern interior design.  Rhett settles in quite well, but Ruby is uncomfortable from the start.  Early on, she realizes that the Glasses are not the perfect couple they purport to be.  At first, she attempts to rationalize her problems, ascribing her difficulty adjusting to her new life as a natural reaction to her grief over the loss of her parents and the social dislocation she feels upon moving to a new city and attending a new school.  Little things continue to happen, however, and she soon finds herself seeking help from her parents' estate lawyer.  When she learns that her parents' estate adds up to four million dollars, she finally begins to suspect her guardians of having somehow played a part in her parents' deaths and to fear that she and her brother are in grave danger as long as they remain in the house.<br />I thought the ending played out very well.  There was one important plot point which I did not expect (along with a few that I did), and the suspense that had been building up consistently throughout the movie reached its peak at just the right time.  I don't find any real absurdity to the ending - slightly clich&eacute;d: yes, but absurd: no.  I think Sobieski is just wonderful and quite convincing in her role of what is a pretty typical teenaged girl forced to deal with a terrifying, almost hopeless situation.  The film succeeds as well as it does, in my opinion, because Lane and Skarsgard give strong performances of their own opposite Sobieski's.  The end result is a suspenseful triumph that I found refreshingly thrilling and convincing.brother are in grave danger as long as they remain in the house.<br />I thought the ending played out very well.

B00008PC2O|5.0|I love this action movie! I have many reasons for that<br />  1. Speciel effects are amazing and working well<br />  2. Arnord's T101 cyborg has lot of humanity<br />  3. Linda acts well Sarah Conner and she is a real female<br />  action hero<br />  4. T1000 is the deadlist and hardest beat robot ever made!<br />  It is real danger for John Conner!<br />  5. The Script is carefully written<br />  6. There are many unforgettable parts. For exemple. Nuclear bomb explose<br /> - Director's cut version shows some very good thing what I liked much. T101's reoperating is one of them.<br /> - If you liked first Terminator,you'll love this movie also.<br /> -
B00003CXXM|4.0|This was a thriller in the true old-fashioned sense of the word and had a little bit of everything in it.  This was a fast-paced movie that twisted and turned, but not so much that you lost track of what was going on.  Having said that you do need to watch the movie and not do 5 other things at the same time!<br />A great movie and one worth just sitting down and watching without distractions.

Something changes when terminator finds her and try to kill.<br /> She have to escape, if she wants to live. At the end of the film she fights agaings terminator and finally beat it. Kyle Reese has a vital part of this film because he protects Sarah Conner and will be her unborn child father.  This enjoyable action mov&iacute;e! Arnord acts like a robot and kills like soldier.<br /> He don't care about anybody expect his mission to kill Sarah Conner. This film provides something for anyone: kids like to see great action, woman loves to see Sarah and Kyle's romance, man likes car driving situations and elder peolle will enjoy a fine sript.

B00009APK1|4.0|On the FULLSCREEN DVD of The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, the video and sound quality are a mixed bag. The movie itself was not meant to be seen in fullscreen, because with the FS, you cut off half of the beautiful landscapes of New Zealand and it doesn't look right. But the sound quality is not restricted or confined, because it sounds perfect. The DD 5.1 EX track is very loud and abstract. The 2.0 Surround Stereo track also sounds good for those of you without home theater setups and are listening just with your TV's speakers. If I were you, I wouldn't pick up the fullscreen just because you hate the black bars, if you are a movie fan and really want to see the movie, do yourself a favor and GET THE WIDESCREEN VERSION or better yet wait until November for the Extended Edition because according to the trailer on this DVD it is going to be awesome!
B000063DI8|2.0|Sensing the band had gone much too far towards a &quot;progressive&quot; direction, Steve Harris decided to go back to a raw sound. Ok. Adrian Smith left the band before recording began.<br />His replacement was one of those mysterious choices that will make you guess forever... Janick Gers. A guy who simply can't play a guitar solo with the same skill as Dave Murray, Adrian Smith or dozens of other British guitarrists (check the &quot;butchering&quot; that Janick does when playing Adrian's solos, live. Unbeliavable. He spends so much time jumping and kneeling and spinning that he simply don't play them!)<br />Anyway, NO PRAYER has a raw sound. So far so good, but there was no necessity to use such a lousy production, with a garage sound, adn stupid songs like HOLY SMOKE and BRING YOUR DAUGHTER. There are some gems here (HOOKS IN YOU still has Adrian on the credits), and TAILGUNNER. But even the great songs were ruined by the weak production and some of them by bad soloing.
B00005JM09|4.0|I have my doubts about this film before I see it because T1 and T2 are action movie classics. I afraided to see a flop Terminator. Luckily, I was mostly wrong. Terminator 3 is not a bad movie, but is not a great movie. I think it's a funny and well-made movie. First, This film copy too many thing fo earlier Terminator and sript is almost same that T2, the special effect are not so amazing than T2 and some characters are too weak.<br /> Finally, Arnord is funnier than ever, T-X is sexy killig machine, which has many deadly skills, At the beginning and the end of the film is best parts of this film.

1400031362|4.0|Morality for Beautiful Girls is the third in the No.1 Ladies' Detective Agency series, a wonderful group of novels that feature a woman from Botswana, of all places, who's a private detective in the country's capital. In this third installment, she's confronted with several problems, both personal and from her business, and solves them all, as best she can. She has an assistant, and that lady also does her part, solving problems too, sometimes even when they seem to be something she can't do anything about.<br />Smith has a wonderful way with words and phrases, and seems to recreate the country and the prose that the people speak there wonderfully. The several main characters are interesting, and of course it's important to note that these really aren't mysteries, in the sense of Agatha Christie or Raymond Chandler. Instead, they're mainly morality plays, with characters and action that are very tame. So far, there hasn't been a murder in the books, just various suspicious goings-on, and things that need to be found out. Often, the wrong-doer is caught, but judged not worthy of punishment for some reason, and released with the injunction to be more honest or good in the future. It's very strange, to say the least, and considering these books mysteries is more than a bit misleading.<br />I enjoyed all three of the books that I've read, but this one is the weakest of the three. For some reason the pace is slower, and the plots are somewhat less interesting. Or perhaps it's just that I've already read something like this twice, and it's not so fresh the third time. I'm not certain which, but I am not quite as enthusiastic about this book as I am about the other two. However, I do recommend it.

B00003CXBK|5.0|I love this movie!! I got as a birthday present and just love it!! Miyazaki is just so wonderful! all of his movies I have seen so far which is like 4 so far counting Mononoke!! Are awesome! Kiki was the first one I saw ^-^ its my favorite next to mononoke. Miyazaki's style is so unique, the characters are amazing they are so cool even the bad guys! the cool thing about mononoke is that there isn't a main bad guy which is nice change from disney movies. Plus all his movies have strong heriones and barely any romance, Mononoke, kiki, Laputa, and spirited away had no romance or no kissing. Thats the great thing about Miyazaki's films he doesn't belive that girls should be fed romance instead a sense of adventure,determination and strong ming . So moms get these films they show girls how to be strong and nice and to be themselves, . Laputa, spirited away are PG good lesson on friendships and being brave, Kiki is G but has a good lesson on growing up, Mononoke is good its lesson is to stand up for what you believe in and to live ,PG-13. That and the characters fight with their beliefs and determination rather weapons, mononoke and Laputa fight with weapons somewhat.<BR> so why five stars because its a classic. plus nobody should miss out on these great flims.
B00005JLSE|1.0|I don't often feel compelled to write my own review of anything on Amazon, especially one for a movie so mainstream and often analyzed as Chicago.  After all, how many of these reviews are you really going to read, out of the hundreds available?  My opinion is - read one and you've read them all.  But after just watching this movie on DVD and having scanned through the hundreds upon hundreds of reviews on Amazon for it, I was amazed to find only one reviewer who seemed to view this film with the same dismay and disappointment that I did.<BR>When I first heard of this movie I was excited to see it.  Having unexpectedly fallen in love with Moulin Rouge I was looking forward to the next big musical that Hollywood had to offer.  Both my Mother and sister (among many others) saw it in the theater and said they really liked it.  My sister even said she liked it more that Moulin Rouge, so I was even more anxious to see it.  Having two small children makes it hard to get to the theater for anything other than Disney releases, so I had to wait for this movie to come out on DVD before finally getting to watch it, which I lamented many times to my husband.  <BR>What a disappointment!  Upon retrospect I am glad now that I didn't waste the $[...] it would have cost to see this movie in the theater.<BR>The entire storyline of Chicago consists of character after character committing and/or defending and glorifying every major mortal sin there is, namely murder and adultery.  Renee Zelweger's character kills her lover when the relationship suddenly goes sour and the rest of the film revolves around her rise to stardom gained by this heinous act.  So many things about this movie appalled me that I could not possibly break them all down one by one and dissect them here.  But the thing that bothered me most about all of it was the way Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) alternately used and neglected her husband in order to get the attention she wanted.  When she finally accomplishes gainingfreedom from prison she immediately discards her poor sap of a husband by dismissing him the way you would swat away a fly buzzing in your ear, without a second thought about it. <BR>The song and dance numbers obviously revolve around the storyline, and are catchy enough, but I find myself repulsed whenever I realize I am walking around with one of the tunes in my head.  Why does everyone seem so taken with this movie and its soundtrack?  Does no one hear the message being given in the songs simply because they are catchy and have pretty dance numbers attached to them?  It was not entertaining for me to watch the characters sing and dance about murder (They had it comin'), spousal manipulation (Funny Honey), bribery and extortion (When You're Good to Mama), jury manipulation (Razzle Dazzle), and countless other offenses.  Would we be so blind as to be entertained by a big budget musical pulled off by the KKK, or how about a musical about animal abuse and murder?  Outrageous?  Yes.  This is how Chicago struck me.  How can everyone be so in love with this movie?  Create a whole bunch of songs we can sing along to and have beautiful people dance to them, no matter the content of said song and dance, and suddenly you have the best movie of the year.  Huh.<BR>Yes, let's sing and dance in praise of the lowest acts human beings can commit against each other and call it entertainment, art, a masterpiece.  The success and popularity of Chicago speaks volumes about what our society considers not only acceptable but also enjoyable.  With all the violence we are exposed to on a daily basis, apparently the way we have chosen to deal with it is to embrace it, put a song to it and bring it into our homes.
B000088E6D|5.0|Bought this CD after a friend recommending it, I'm certainly thrilled when I listened to the songs. Michael Buble's voice is one of the best I've heard, rivaled that of Sinatra, Darin, and even Robbie Williams. I especially like his take on &quot;Fever&quot; (updating Peggy Lee's tune), &quot;How Can You Mend a Broken Heart&quot; (even better than Al Green), &quot;Sway&quot; (the Latinish background music is very cool), &quot;The Way You Look Tonight&quot;, and &quot;Come Fly With Me&quot; (sang it as well as Frank, very few singers can do that). Overall, an excellent album, I look forward to buy his new CD when it's released later this year. Move over Harry Connick, Jr and Michael Feinstein, there's a new guy in town!!

0792160347|3.0|The significance of American Gigalo is capturing the mood of the disco movement in its waning days, and not of a compelling story line that draws you in.<br />The story line itself is weak, as other reviewers have already panned it.  A gigolo is framed for murder, set up by him pimp.  Living the cream of life in its riches on his good looks, a murder accusation send his good life down a spiral.  Along the decent, he picks up the love of a prominent politician's wife, who becomes his savior and true love, perhaps for the first time in his life.<br />What makes American Gigalo fun is capturing the last breadth of the disco movement, of the lifestyle of when casual sex was safe, drugs were no big deal, and the music was still dance-able.  This was the film that made Richard Gere the movie icon that he is today.  <br />Watch this movie for a trip down memory lane, but don't expect a great story out of it.

B00007M5CO|5.0|i am mainly into electronic music and not really into tango/latin rhythms, etc. but i happened to pick this up when i was in a record store and while i was walking around with it, 3 people who worked there (with lip piercings and blue hair etc. you know, people who probably don't tango!) said, 'that's a really great cd'. and it is. i listened to it 5 times in a row when i got home. since then, i have bought 3 on amazon and sent them to friends!!
B00009L7N1|5.0|For anyone who is a Simply Red fan, you will love this CD.  I would have to say that 'Sunrise' is my favorite song, but the rest of the CD is equally as good.  We have all waited a long time for this new CD.  Thanks Simply Red.
B00003CXRP|5.0|I bought the two-disc version... one of the few films I've watched more than once over the past 5 years. I just wish Tom Hank's character could have gotten back together with his wife-to-be... a sad part in the movie.
B00009ATIX|1.0|I had heard this was a 'slow' movie and I had adjusted my expectations accordingly.  I looked forward to uncovering the riddle.  The movie contains, on average, about 10 lines of dialogue for every 7 minutes of film.  I cannot remember a single satisfying scene. No music. No laugh. Not even a thoughtful epiphany. I kept expecting to be drawn-in by thoughtful dialogue about humanity reaching the stars.  I did NOT enjoy one minute of this movie.  It has absolutely no continuity - due in large part to endless (and quite meaningless) flashbacks.  Even more frustrating, it lacks any sense of chemistry - I couldn't care less who dies and who lives.  It lacks a protagonist and an antagonist.  It lacks any sense of suspense - other than the viewers' own longing for thoughtful diaglogue to cause us to question our own existence.  Some have touted this movie as sublime or sutle - hog wash. This movie is a TURKEY.

God bless THE WHITE STRIPES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00009RDG8|1.0|This was a horrible movie.  There was absolutely no point at all to it except to watch two guys cutting each other up with knives.  The beginning started off great and I thought it might have potential to turn into the standard good guy gets messed over by the government but his trainer decides to buck the system and helps him out, not the case.  I was really disappointed and almost fell asleep several times.  Very tedious and boring.  If you want excitment dont watch this movie but if your a sadist and you want to see two grown men cut each other up with knives then I would recommend it.

0140042520|2.0|I've read &quot;On The Road&quot; three times over the last six years. It is, in my opinion, a masterpiece. Having said that I decided to get &quot;Dharma Bums&quot; and I did not care for most of the book as I am not into Buddha and zen. Only once in a while a glimmer of the fun of &quot;On The Road&quot; seeped in, but not enough. <br />I also did not like the supporting characters as I did in &quot;On The Road.&quot;<br />This book was pushed by many people as Kerouac's second best. I found it to be uninteresting and probably should not pursue any other of his books if this was considered &quot;his second best.&quot;
B0000AI44Q|4.0|I am a big Neil Young fan, especially with Crazy Horse in the mix.  So my opinions, as they are, may be biased.  So take the following with a grain of salt....<br />Greendale is a concept albumn (yikes), but  I won't go into that too much.  The story is well explained in the liner notes and well explained in the extra DVD:  an all live, acoustic version of each of the songs in the same order with narrative between each.  At times, this narrative can drag on to the point that you are begging Neil to pleeeeeease stop talking and play.  But the DVD is a good way to understand the story, if you are so inclined.<br />For whatever reason, Pancho Sampedro (1 of 3 Crazy Horse guys &amp; the rythem guitarist) is left out of the mix here.  His heavy strumming is missed and Neil seems to miss that driving force in his solos &amp; lead work.  So it doesn't have that full tilt &quot;Horse sound&quot; found in classics like Rust Never Sleeps or Ragged Glory.<br />&quot;Bandit&quot;, a nice acoustic song with a strange, ringing guitar tuning, is a standout track.  Nice harmonies.  The DVD version (once wading through an oh-so-long intro) is simply magical.  So is the pump organ based song &quot;Bringin' down dinner&quot;. &quot;Sun Green&quot; and &quot;Be the Rain&quot; are joined at the hip rockers and my favorite tracks on Greendale.  &quot;Sun Green&quot; has some blistering guitar workouts and this crazy, megaphone filtered &quot;Hey Mr. Clean, You're dirty now too&quot; chorus that is very infectious.  &quot;Be the Rain&quot; is a &quot;save the planet for another day&quot; environmental rave-up.  <br />The rest of the CD is all pretty good, raunchy blues like music.  There's some real groove to these songs, as a whole, and it all flows together realy well.  There are many political statements and &quot;we should stick to the old ways&quot; statements along the way. George Bush supporters beware. In typical Neil Young fashion, he gives enough details to outline a picture, but leaves it to your imagination to fill in the colors.  <br />I gave 4 stars, but 3 1/2 might be a better rating.  This is not a Neil Young starter kit for new fans.  And it does push old fans to accept a little change (nothing new for us).  But that's ok in my book.  It keeps the plot interesting.
B0000AI44Q|4.0|Receiving much negative press for being a 'concept' album - this is Neil's strongest offering since Harvest Moon or Ragged Glory (which also has many extended numbers). Bandit is an excellent acoustic cut. Falling From Above, Carmichael, Sun Green, and Be the Rain are all excellent songs. This is just a really good album. <br />If you love Harvest or Comes a Time - the CD might not be your bag, but the DVD will. <br />This is an EXCELLENT value. The DVD is Neil acoustic - the CD with Ralph and Billy backing him. The only thing the CD could have used was some guitar chops or organ 'color' from Pancho.
B00004Y7SF|5.0|We all know Christina is a wonderful singer, she's proved it to all of us from her past 4 albums.  When I listen to this girl I get chills, she is so great.  I know people complain about her a lot about her image, and I just want to say to them &quot;GET A LIFE!&quot;  Don't you have anything better to do than pick on this talented star?  Anyway, I just want to say that I really recommend this cd!  It totally gets you in the Christmas mood as your putting up the tree, and decorating it, and putting lights up!  This album is what Christmas is all about!
B00006JKOL|5.0|How anyone could ever call this an inferior album is beyond me.  This album has always been the pinnacle of the Tull experience for me and I have every album they have ever released.  Minstrel is a masterpiece.  The music is phenomenol and Ian Anderson soared with the most stunning lyrics of his career.  Just reading the lyrics to this album alone is a revelation.  Did it need a remastering?  That is debatable.  This album was great as a record and shines all the more in CD form, remastered or not remastered.  The extras are a nice addition, especially March the Mad Scientist, Summerday Sands and Pan Dance (from the 20th anniversary box) but frankly, this album needs nothing to make it one of the greatest albums ever recorded.  If someone is looking for a poppy sound, then perhaps this is not the Tull album to start with, but if you are looking for a brilliant creation that never wears out upon repeated listenings then look no further.
B000002H33|5.0|This is *THE* album to get.  This was Metallica at its very synchronized best.  Every tune is a winner and the arrangement of the songs on the album is perfectly laid out to flow from one into the next.  This is what we compare awesome heavy metal to gauge its value.  Guitar solos rip, bass lines rumble, James' vocals shriek through you, and the drums pound it all into place.  Battery, Puppets, The Thing, Sanitarium, Heroes, Leper Messiah, Orion, Damage Inc.  All the very best!<br />When Metallica names a tour or an album (Garage Inc, Summer Sanitarium) or even some lyrics in St Anger's title track, they are continually referencing this high point in their career.  This is the one to get if you only buy one Metallica album.
0316666343|4.0|I thought that I was the last person in America who still had not yet read this book.  It has been on every bestseller list since its debut, appeared on Oprah (a huge endorsement in and of itself) and receives glowing reviews on Amazon.  Even with those high expectations, I found Lovely Bones to be a good novel.<br />A quick read, Alice Sebold captures her reader from the first page and keeps them until the last 40 pages.  Everything you have heard about the book is true - the story is heartwarming, thought provoking, and bittersweet.  However, I was extremely disappointed with the ending.  <br />Without giving anything away, the writing style in the last 40 pages changed dramatically and I was left feeling like Ms Sebold had abandoned her characters and me.  All of which is unfortunate as it is apparent that until page 295 or so, she took much care in developing and stewarding their story.
B000002HRE|2.0|Metallica has not made a good album since And Justice For All.  Even the Black Album has a few forgettable songs and those are becoming more and more prominent in each subsequent album.  Master of Puppets is my benchmark and they have fallen far from that peak.  Load is just that.
038572179X|5.0|I find reviews from readers who find this book &quot;slow&quot; quite amusing.  I think TV might be more their speed.  And I *really* love the reviews from people who didn't understand the ending!  Wow!  Poor Ian McEwan, forced to please the &quot;loving mommies&quot; and others out there who should stick to romance novels.  This is one of the most well-crafted works of literature in recent years, with a heartbreaking twist at the end.  Highly recommended.
B00008OLYN|5.0|During Opeth's co-headlining tour with Porcupine Tree in Cleveland, singer/guitarist Mikael Ã...kerfeldt remarks, &quot;For those of you Porcupine Tree fans who don't know what's going on, we are Opeth from Stockholm, Sweden. We are a death metal band. We believe in Satan.&quot;  The crowd shared a laugh at Mikael's matter of fact statement, which was in the middle the set where Damnation was played in its entirety.<br />Damnation is the much-anticipated &quot;other half&quot; of the contrasting set of recently released Opeth albums.  'Deliverance' released November, 2002, was a blistering record of heavy, blasting death metal while still retaining Opeth's signature sound, probably their heaviest recording yet.  Damnation released April 2003, is obviously their softest recording yet.  Always being heavily influenced by 70's prog rock, Opeth plug into the atmosphere found on earlier recordings by Pink Floyd and King Crimson and even hint at such singer-songwriters as Nike Drake and Joni Mitchell<br />I've heard statements like &quot;Porcupine Tree is rubbing off on Opeth,&quot; or &quot;Opeth is making Porcupine Tree heavier,&quot; or even &quot;Opeth wouldn't be where they were right now if it weren't for Steven Wilson [Porcupine Tree].&quot;  This is entirely not true.  The way that Steven Wilson came to become Opeth's current producer, producing not only Damnation, but also Deliverance and Blackwater Park, is that of an avid fan.  Wilson was slipped a copy of Opeth's Still Life during an interview being told that Opeth were huge fans of the Tree. Wilson instantly hooked onto Opeth's progressive approach that was similar to the progressive genre that Porcupine Tree so obviously fell in.  Thus, a professional relationship was born.  Not only did Wilson produce the last three Opeth records, but he also played guitar, piano and provided backing vocals for each album.  He even went so far as to write lyrics to &quot;Death Whispered A Lullaby.&quot;  Has he become the fifth member emulating what Sir George Martin was to the Beatles?  Highly unlikely.<br />Opeth has never compromised their own sound as part of an ever growing Swedish metal scene, even with Steven Wilson at the boards.  Opeth is not part of that scene and Damnation proves that.  Full of soft acoustic passages and lush mellotron which graces just about every song, this is Opeth at their best.  Warning: At the Gates fans looking for the trademark death metal growl should pick up the new Enslaved album. Here you will find Mikael's clean melodic voice soaring vibrantly with sorrow and sadness sitting on his shoulder (a lot of the album was written with regards to his grandmother's passing).  One of the biggest moments comes in the closing track  &quot;Weakness&quot; where Mikael proves his voice to be anything but weak only backed by a fender Rhodes and some subtle guitar playing.  Highlighting the power of the bands softer side, this sounds like it could be a collection of &quot;softer greatest hits,&quot; from the band, let alone part two of a pair of contrasting albums.  Songs like &quot;Windowpane,&quot;  &quot;Hope Leaves,&quot; and &quot;Ending Credits&quot; could easily fit on any of the previous six Opeth albums along side such classics as &quot;Credence,&quot; &quot;To Bid You Farewell&quot; or &quot;Benighted&quot; the latter two even being featured on the bands current tour.  Damnation has more in common with Red House Painters than Morbid Angel.<br />Mikael was trying to fool us all when he said, &quot;we are a death metal band.&quot;  Simply put Opeth is a progressive band.  Progressive rock seemed to die along side the &quot;album&quot; in the late seventies, making way for disco and pop music.

B00004W52U|2.0|Before I bought this disc I kept reading how great and influential this band was. When I got this disc I was thoroughly disappointed. Op-Ivy play fast, however, there is no heart; no energy. The songs are boring and the music has few hooks. When you've heard one Operation Ivy reggae style song you've heard them all. In addition, this album is way too long  therefore it  deludes the few good songs. I've tried but this album just can't grow on me. Best songs: &quot;The Crowd&quot; &quot;Unity&quot; and &quot;Healthy Body&quot;
B00005UEAR|5.0|They never disappoint. The Glass Prison is like one of my favorite songs ever at this point. It is amazing these guys can keep pumping out such complex stuff.
B00009L1TA|3.0|this movie is very enjoyable, but in the end, I felt like when I was watching &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;. in the end, we figure the whole movie was bogus, and that all the plot was a bunch of lies! The first end of the conspiracy is great!! the second was obvious that Styler was in it...but the 3rd..blows away the whole movie...it ruined the movie in my opinion! thk u
B000002AP1|5.0|So here's the dope---I don't think that Bowies mix was tame nor was it flawed--it was just a bit more polished but not too polished. It may have sounded a bit hollow but none the less it was still a great record and if someone had'nt decided that it needed to be remixed most of us would'nt have known any different anyhow.  However it was remixed  and it's better on some tracks and worse on others--overall it's just a different mix.  It is rawer and a bit heavier but there were moments when I found myself prefering the original Bowie mix.  At any rate either version is a must have record....
B0000A1RJI|5.0|Arrr, who turned up my base? Oh no wait, that's just me Pirates of the Caribbean soundtrack! Even though other reviewers have mentioned the short length of this music CD as a bad feature, I'm not at all disappointed with it. I think sometimes when one continues to play a more complete film score to the point of having it practically memorized; it takes away from the movie viewing experience somewhat. This soundtrack is not cursed with too much of a good thing; actually it possesses the essence: the melodic energy that helped make the film what it is, EXCITING! <br />The riches lie in its driving beat and interesting arrangements that can be as unpredictable as a pirate. Just when I thought the music might become pleasurable, quiet, calming and listener friendly for just a little while, it turned on me with some commanding brass and pounding percussion. I enjoy this CD from start to finish, and it's just not feasible for me to pick out a few favorite tracks. There's the agile and distinctive rhythm of strings right away in the first track, and then there's the mysterious, almost bizarre and nerve-slicing drama in Swords Crossed, track number five. And of course all throughout the CD there are segments of the memorable marches and themes, which I've been whistling; humming or desktop drumming on any occasion since the day I first saw the movie.<br />Despite the various quality complaints, the soundtrack has enough to satisfy and amuse the Pirates of the Caribbean fan; aye, it is better than nothing! And the music is at it's best when on a quality sound system, as it does seems to generate more base than a normal instrumental. I noticed this in particular while listening to it on my vehicle's ordinary CD player and was a bit surprised by this, decided to lower the base setting quite a few notches. But regardless, if you're someone who enjoys film scores, then Pirates of the Caribbean is a trove that you might find worth uncovering.
B000084T18|4.0|50 Cent exploded on the mainstream rap scene with two very likeable tracks--\\"Wanksta\\" and \\"In Da Club.\\" The Queens native, prior to releasing those two songs, was relatively unknown to the rap world. His debut \\"Get Rich Or Die Tryin'\\" quickly became the most highly anticipated album of 2003. Ever since its release, rap fans have either condemned or showered the album with praise. In my opinion, 50 has achieved what no other commercial rapper has since Dr. Dre's 1992 gangsta rap landmark \\"The Chronic.\\" He has managed to transform autobiographical tales of violence, drug dealing, rage, and womanizing into 19 stylish/radio-friendly tracks. Similar to Dre's beef with Eazy E on \\"The Chronic,\\" 50 has his own arch-rival in the shape of minute rapper Ja Rule whom he addresses on the firm and utterly effective \\"Back Down.\\" On \\"Heat,\\" 50 blows the brains out of any would-be enemies backed by an outrageous gun-shot percussion beat courtesy of Dr. Dre. \\"P.I.M.P.\\" finds our drawling hero spitting game and getting his mack on against a reggae-tinged beat. And yes, the album also includes \\"Wanksta\\" and \\"In Da Club.\\" 50's lyrics never really transcend the boundaries of casual liquor/narcotics consumption and hardcore posturing, but you are having so much fun listening to the hyper-stylish beats, 50's clever gutter witticisms, and charming drawl, that you won't even mind. Sure, the subject matter is mundane, 50 is all about the benjamins, yet it still makes for some highly enjoyable and memorable music. Not a classic, and definitely not as innovative as its predecessor and prototype, Dr. Dre's \\"The Chronic,\\" but it is still the most hardcore, street-influenced pop rap album of recent years. Pick this one up.
0671578855|1.0|I couldn't take it.  Day after day, I forced myself to read a little bit more of this book.  Day after day, it made me more and more ill.  It's hard to believe that such a good writer as Bujold could take her Vorkosigan saga and turn it into this.  For all intents and purposes, there's no plot whatsoever outside of Miles trying to woo his lady love.  Oh, sure, there's Mark having troubles with his girlfriend and with a startup business.  There's some stuff about Gregor and his wedding.  And, in the closest thing to approach anything beyond self-absorbed mush, there's some stuff involving the succession to a couple of Countships.  But, as of page 295 (out of 534), there's nothing else.  Ugh.  I'm sorry.  But, where's someone saving the world?  Or, how about saving a fleet?  Destroying an evil scourge?  Saving Miles' life?  Mark's?  Anyone's?  Nope.  Nothing.  It's all trivial stuff that's important only to the characters involved.  I'd also like to point out that almost every person in the book, though most are over 30, acts like a love-sick, idiotic teenager.  In fact, to show you how out of character everyone is, the most mature person in the book is Ivan, Miles' cousin.  It looks like this is the last of the Vorkosigan series I'll ever read.  I've read all the other books in the Vorkosigan series (and loved them all).  I've also read Bujold's books outside the series and they're pretty good. So, I guess that's where I'll look from now on.
B00005AQE8|4.0|Both Biggie and Tupac are often revered as the two greatest emcees to ever live, largely due to their violent deaths and eventual martyrdom. Objectively, while Biggie was an extremely eloquent lyricist with an amazing flow, Tupac was never more than an average rapper. His lyrics were always solid, but his flow was never the sharpest. Many regard \\"Eyez\\" as his best recording, and I would have to concur. The 1st disc is very good (no filler), and the 2nd one is almost a complete dud. And that is by no means bad, as most rappers would be so lucky to have 14 very good tracks on an album. On \\"Eyez,\\" Pac's flow is better than ever, and his lyricism is so nihilistic that it is strangely irresistable to listen to. Every track on the 1st disc seems to be epic and highly dramatic--either dealing with his preoccupation with death, or his love of partying. Each track is memorable in its own way. \\"All About You,\\" features some of Nate Dogg's best hook work and one of the most clever analysises of the women who gravitate towards rappers ever to be commited to record. On \\"2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted,\\" Tupac teams with then Death Row labelmate, Snoop Dogg to create a gangsta rap classic. \\"California Love (Remix)\\" finds Dr. Dre at his production apex. \\"I ain't mad at ya\\" finds Tupac revealing his soul with some of the most insightful lyrics he ever came up with. In the end, what makes the 1st disc of this legendary album so powerful, are the tracks that bolster his self-created image of a dashing, romantic, well-intentioned outlaw, destined for doom and tragic death. \\"Ambition Az a Ridah,\\" finds 'Pac explaining unapologetically about why he decided to live by the gun, and \\"Only God Can Judge Me\\" serves a similar purpose. Throughout the album his flow is on point. What makes this an incredible album is that it rings so true, and serves almost as a self delivered eulogy from a man that was arguably the definitive gangsta rapper of the 1990's. Tragic, and completely eery, the album stands as a shining achievement, something Tupac was undoubtedly extremely proud of. pick it up.

B000002JSJ|5.0|Many rate &quot;Presence&quot; as the moment in Led Zeppelin's career when the quality of their music began to decline. Due to this consensus, I avoided this album for a long time. Yet after giving all of the early Zeppelin albums many a listen, I decided to finally make this purchase out of curiosity. While their may be some truth to this album not being perfect, I still believe in a theory of mine. The first slightly weaker album from an above average classic rock band beats the average album from any other band at the time. Therefore, any true Zeppelin fan should give the underrated &quot;Presence&quot; a shot. The opening song (undeniably the best one) has often been called the last great Zeppelin epic song and rightfully so. &quot;Achilles Last Stand&quot; may not be as well known as other over-worshipped Zeppelin classics like &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; or &quot;Kashmir,&quot; but it deserves the same regard. It may be my favorite Zeppelin epic song, simply because it hasn't been blown way out of proportion with excessive adoration. The song kicks into high gear right from the start and remains pretty exciting for all of its ten minutes, which is not a praise I can just hand out. Next up is &quot;For Your Love,&quot; which is not amazing, but enjoyable. Ditto for &quot;Royal Orleans,&quot; which I feel is probably the catchiest song on the album. I just love its fast, chugging beat. &quot;Nobody's Fault But Mine&quot; is a Zeppelin classic that many will recognize from radio airplay. I can see why some would consider the two following songs, &quot;Candy Store Rock&quot; and &quot;Hots on for Nowhere&quot; to be filler, yet I don't find them too offensive. They are nothing special, but they are survivable and even a little humorous. Finally we reach the closing track, &quot;Tea For One,&quot; which certainly serves its purpose well. I love the blues, and Zeppelin display their mastery of a great, slow blues tune here. Overall, I enjoy &quot;Presence&quot; enough to recommend it to other Zeppelin fans. It certainly can't hurt to have a change of pace after listening to &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot; for the millionth time.

Then after you have watched it and figured it out, see if the movie self-destructs unbelievably!<br />Nicholas Cage co-produced this movie and originally had intended to star in it.  2-time Oscar winner Kevin Spacey (\\"The Usual Suspects\\" & \\"American Beauty\\") does a great job of making the film interesting.  His studied focus throughout the film is only somewhat at odds with an alcoholic's penchant for erratic behavior.  When he takes student Berlin played by Rhona Mitra (Sweet Home Alabama & Get Carter) in a bathroom from behind, one wonders how low the film can go!  But doubt not, it goes lower than that!<br />Former philosophy teacher & 1st-time screenwriter Charles Randolph throws in a plethora of plot twists & cliches.  Kate Winslet's tiger reporter character is named \\"Bitsy Bloom.\\"  One wonders why.  One can keep wondering; she had to be called something, no matter how odd the name.  A rose by any other name smells as sweet; and Kate looks pretty good despite sporting a hairstyle from Budget Cuts.  She plays this one-note performance with the skill and energy of a master musician furiously banging a B flat from a one-note song.  She is determined; and even has her car malfunction at just the wrong time!  While she won't add to her 3 Oscar nominations (\\"Sense & Sensibility,\\" \\"Iris,\\" \\"Titanic\\"), she is still a pleasure to watch.<br />Laura Linney who had a Best Actress nomination in 2000 for \\"You Can Count on Me\\" does a wonderful job as Constance Harraway, the devoted member of Deathwatch, and anti-Capital punishment group.  The film gets a sad note of irony as the character suffers from an apparently fatal case of leukemia.  However, as she writhes and screams on the floor with a bag on her head in a mysteriously delivered video, one only wonders if Alan Parker used a body double.<br />My favorite performance in the movie was by Matt Craven (Dragonfly) as Dusty Wright, the cowboy Deathwatch member that Bitsy suspects of the crime.  He has a haunting role with few words that makes one wonder what \\"The Life of David Gale\\" could have been like as a silent movie.  Gabriel Mann as Bitsey's assistant Zack Stemmons does a great job of sassing and being supportive.  Leon Rippy (The Patriot, Universal Soldier) as lawyer Braxton Belyeu is wonderfully creepy.<br />It's been a long time since Alan Parker was nominated for Best Director, \\"Midnight Express\\" [1978] & \\"Mississippi Burning\\" [1988].  \\"The Life of David Gale\\" is well paced, with good performances by the cast.  Ultimately, this is not a movie about capital punishment, however.  It is a mystery tale that uses the theme to its own ends, rather unsuccessfully.  It boils down to whether it's believable for someone to kill herself & himself to prove it can be done.<br />Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to watch this DVD for the good performances; and then let it go.  Unfortunately, that is not a mission impossible.ven (Dragonfly) as Dusty Wright, the cowboy Deathwatch member that Bitsy suspects of the crime.

Gabriel Mann as Bitsey's assistant Zack Stemmons does a great job of sassing and being supportive.  Leon Rippy (The Patriot, Universal Soldier) as lawyer Braxton Belyeu is wonderfully creepy.  <br />It's been a long time since Alan Parker was nominated for Best Director, \\"Midnight Express\\" [1978] & \\"Mississippi Burning\\" [1988].  \\"The Life of David Gale\\" is well paced, with good performances by the cast.  Ultimately, this is not a movie about capital punishment, however.  It is a mystery tale that uses the theme to its own ends, rather unsuccessfully.  It boils down to whether it's believable for someone to kill herself & himself to prove it can be done.  <br />Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to watch this DVD for the good performances; and then let it go.  Unfortunately, that is not a mission impossible.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|This is the one! X-Men 1 is simply a trailer for X2. Forget the Hulk, forget the matrix.  This is all you need.  Simply the best action movie of the year.  It's smart, funny, action packed and true to the comics.  X-fans and fans of the first film, do not hesitate to pick this up.  It's worth every penny! And get yourself a trusty clock, so you can count the minutes until X3! ;)
B00009MEJU|1.0|One of the reviews on the video box said &quot;4 stars! Science fiction the way it's supposed to be done!&quot; Something to that effect. If that sentiment is true, no wonder I've never much cared for science fiction. One of the most god-awful boring movies I've ever sat through. Suitable for pseudo-intellectuals to ooh and aah over, but normal humans should keep away.
B00006D295|4.0|There is one reason why everyone should see \\"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\\": it is the best cult film ever made.  There are also three reasons why everyone should want to watch it: 1) It is one of the only `R' rated musicals in existence.  2) It has strong science-fiction overtones.  3) It is very funny.  The movie starts Barry Bostwick and Susan Sarandon (before they were stars) as the recently engaged Brad and Janet.  However, they are upstaged in nearly every scene by Tim Curry who plays Frank N. Furter, the mad doctor.  The cast delightfully performs many memorable songs including \\"Over at the Frankenstein Place\\" and, of course, the \\"Time Warp\\".  To fully enjoy RHPS, one must not be closed minded or the picture could prove to be quite offensive.  Don't think it's gratuitously violent- it isn't.  Merely, the situations the characters find themselves in could shock or appall overly sensitive viewers.  If you think you won't enjoy RHPS, going to a midnight screening might be your best bet.  The live audience participation will guarantee you a good time, despite your opinion of the actual film.  So overall, RHPS is quite a good adaptation of Richard O'Brien's original concept, which always honors its roots on the stage.
0783225970|1.0|What is so good about this movie??? Many people liked it because of Tony Montana's persistance of getting to the top, one way or another.  There are other movies that I like that was based on tnis movie like \\"New Jack City\\" or \\"Paid in Full\\". All in all, I'm not saying it sucks, in my opinion, I just don't like it. If your a fan, go ahead & get it

B0000AI44Q|5.0|\\"Sun Green\\" pretty much puts it in context: a young woman chains herself to a huge bronze sculpture of an eagle in the lobby of the local power company. While security and police attempt to separate protester and sculpture, she makes her stance known via megaphone: \\"when the city is plunged into darkness by an unpredicted rolling blackout, the white house always blames the governor, saying the solution is to vote him out!\\". <br />Anyone who argues Neil's position as America's most empowered observer simply doesn't read the news. <br />Oh, the album? The music? The first tentative guitar notes on \\"carmichael\\" rattle the snare drum. I no longer take that sound for granted. It's a sound that, as Neil himself said years ago, \\"is as real as the day is long\\". To these ears, Greendale is a close relative to RUST NEVER SLEEPS' 'first-take, live in the barn/garage/soundcheck' aesthetic... Whoops! Just missed it... what did he say? <br />Built around what seems the drunken ghost of The Beatles' 'Day Tripper' riff (ambling amongst many other slow, meandering stabs at familiarity), 'carmichael' does what only Neil can do, especially when backed by the Horse: pulls you into a story dripping with slapstick, horror, anger, and regret, and prevents you from just wandering off (which the offhanded, seemingly  aimless playing would imply is a viable option). <br />It's like a sonic mirage... as you look/hear for the blurry atmosphere to take some kind of tangible shape, you're mesmerized, and 10 minutes later, you've finished one of the ten chapters of this complete narrative told in song form. <br />This is yet another peak in Neil's career, but one that's  unlikely to yield any bold NEIL YOUNG IS BACK pronouncements. Not just because the album is low-key, fiercely unrepentant in its examination of the state of things, and often as downright scary as parts of TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT or SLEEPS WITH ANGELS. It's mostly because Neil has in fact become less of a rock phenomenon (prone to 'comebacks' and 'setbacks' and whatnot) and more of a familiar correspondent. The relationship is far more intimate and immediate than one would expect from a recording artist with 30+ years of 'public service' behind him. <br />\\"How's the weather look to you, Neil?\\" <BR>\\"Heh... well, let me sing it for ya...\\" <br />Plus, the story itself (supported by the essential notes in the booklet) is likely to throw more than one listener off their comfortable perch. Those who don't get Neil will dislike it. Their loss. Thanks again, Neil. THIS note, faithful friend, is for you. Troublemaker...

B0000026KQ|5.0|GUITAR SHOP is without a doubt one of the greatest guitar albums ever recorded. This is what playing electric guitar is all about. This album is an essential primer on the electric guitar. GUITAR SHOP comes closest to capturing the futuristic electric guitar elan of the 1960s Jeff Beck sound. There are shades of SHAPES OF THINGS, OVER UNDER SIDEWAYS DOWN, BECK'S BOLERO, TRAIN KEPT A ROLLIN, and HAPPENINGS TEN YEARS TIME AGO. There is the hard rock/heavy metal sound of the Jeff Beck Group as well as the jazz-rock fusion of BLOW BY BLOW and WIRED. There are no words to describe the effect of this album. GUITAR SHOP is Jeff Beck at his very best.<br />Every guitar player should own GUITAR SHOP. This is what it is all about. This is what virtuosity and musicianship sound like.<br />The best track on the album is WHERE WERE YOU, which has become a guitar classic and a Jeff Beck signature song. WHERE WERE YOU is arguably the best record Beck ever cut. Jeff Beck composed this track and so put his own musical and artistic vision into it. That is what is so remarkable. We see that guitar playing is all in the mind, not in the fingers or in the amplifier or the guitar brand or the pick you use. It is all in the mind. That is the secret revealed on this album. You cannot teach that. That is why every guitarist in the world should own this album. Every guitarist has to have his or her own voice or musical vision. That is the secret to playing great music. Today, all guitarists play the same styles that they imitate from what they are hyped into believing is the best. Guitarists play hackneyed cliches and unimaginative riffs that are just so much garbage and noise,i.e., musical trash. There is no originality or artistic vision, just copycat, plagiarism, xerox copies of what the \\"stars\\" play. It is all musical ... that makes one want to vomit and throw one's guitar in the garbage can or break it against the wall. Guitar music sounds so ... and one-dimensional. Guitar music sounds like it is created by cretins and morons. Yes, it is that bad. But, then, GUITAR SHOP came out in 1989....It was like a blind man who had regained his sight. This was what playing the guitar was all about. And Beck gets some remarkable sounds out of his guitar. SAVOY is just breathtaking. How does Beck do that? Again, it is all in the mind. TWO RIVERS is a remarkable slow ballad. Beck shows that less is more here. He shows what one can do with just a few notes...and some musical talent.<br />Every song on this album is remarkable and a revelation. It is all killer, no filler. It shows what all the fuss was all about.<br />Why did Jimi Hendrix want to meet Jeff Beck in 1966 when Chas Chandler brought him to the UK? Why did Jimi listen to and study Jeff Beck's guitar playing? Why did Jimmy Page say that Jeff Beck is the best guitarist that there is? This album shows us why. Beck's vision for the electric guitar is awe-inspiring. It is an artistic vision unlike any other. We all owe Jeff Beck our gratitude for taking the guitar out of the boring and banal into the unexplored country. GUITAR SHOP is more than just another album. It is a milestone. It shows us the possibilities of the guitar.s like it is created by cretins and morons. Yes, it is that bad.

0385504209|5.0|In addition to providing the reader with an array of new possibilities to research on a seemingly endless variety of subjects, this estimable fellow has underscored what a crock organized religion is.<br />If ever we can wean people from the mindless belief in established religious dogma and open their minds to what is truly magnificent - the reality and mystery of the universe sans superstitious god-worship - what a truly wonderful gift they will receive.
B0000AOV85|5.0|This DVD is stunningly good (it hit the shops here on Aug. 23 even when the official release date was Aug. 26). It features interviews with all 4 band members that recorded the album. I particularly like the bits where they single out certain tracks on the mixing desk, so you hear just the vocals or just a certain guitar part etc.<BR>Great picture quality and the bonus material is wonderful too.<BR>A must have for any Pink Floyd fan.
B00009W0U4|4.0|A fantastic foreign film that reminds me somewhat of Memento yet got none of the acclaim.My only complaint is that they leave you wondering what happens which is great and thought-provoking sometimes but for some reason got on my nerves this time.
0142004235|5.0|This book has it all--sweeping themes which are common to all people, fascinating and flawed characters, and an interesting interweaving of people's choices and the impact this has on those around them.  The novel is based on the Biblical account of Cain and Abel in the book of Genesis.  Steinbeck dwells on the sibling rivalry which pits one brother against another for their father's love.  This occurs in two generations with Charlie and Adam in the first generation and Adam's twin sons Cal and Aron in the second.  There are fascinating characters, such as the wicked Cathy who finds men's weaknesses and preys on them for her own gain, the wise and philosophical Chinese servant Lee, and the wonderful dreamer named Samuel Hamilton.  The Hamilton family is patterned after Steinbeck's maternal family and he sometimes takes side-trips to the plot in order to tell some family tale which has been passed on to him by oral tradition.  Another interesting theme has to do with dreamers, like Adam and Aron, who only see what they want to see, and realists, such as Samuel's wife, whose view is likewise narrowed by her practical nature.  Abra starts out as a dreamer, but grows into a woman who sees the greys in life and learns to accept them without letting them detroy her.  A favorite theme seems to deal with paternal expectations and how these can overpower and sometimes detroy a son.  Steinbeck delves into the question of inherited predisposition towards sin and resoundingly concludes that we all have choices and we are not driven totally by our genetic disposition.  This is a fascinating study of human nature and of good vs. evil and is a wonderful read.
B000035Z1Z|4.0|The movie's cute, but the soundtrack is fantastic.
B00005JLSE|5.0|Director Rob Marshall did an excellent job translating this Broadway musical to the big screen. He took the story and made it his own by coming up with his own concepts like the &quot;fantasies&quot; idea, doing exciting editing, and casting big stars that are multi-talented.  The stars may not be the greatest singers or dancers, but they were good enough for this movie.<br />All those negative reviewers were expecting this movie to be a clone of their own personal favorites. I'm glad it wasn't or then it wouldn't be a Rob Marshall original. If you expected a typical Broadway musical, then of course you'd be disappointed. You might as well just see the musical on stage.<br />Also, I noticed that those who liked Moulin Rouge did not like Chicago and vice versa.  Like one reviewer said, these are two completely different musicals with different story lines and music. I personally liked Chicago more because it was more exciting to me in terms of music and style and overall fun to watch.<br />But everybody's a critic and it's all subjective. You like it or you don't. I would recommend watching this movie with an open mind. Don't be jaded...forget about all those other musicals you've seen, and just watch this movie and you just may enjoy this movie afterall.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|The Director's Edition: Boot Leg of Almost Famous is my favorite DVD.  The directors commentary with Cameron Crowe and his mom is fabulous and leaves me craving his next movie. Cameron's love of music and film really shines in Almost Famous.  And the cast is just perfect!! This film has a special place in my heart and this edition makes me love it even more.  Please check out the audio of  &quot;Small Time Blues&quot; with Pete Droge and Elaine Summers, its a little tribute to Gram Parson and Emmylou Harris and it is just beautiful....
B00008K9Z5|5.0|I could sit here and type 1000 words to explain this cd..but i'm going to keep it short and simple.  Meteora is one of the best Cd's EVER!!!

Although I am a Ben Stiller fan from his work in &quot;Meet the Parents&quot; and &quot;There's Something About Mary,&quot; this is by far his LEAST funny comedy.  &quot;Zoolander&quot; gets 1 star only because there isn't a 0 star option.  I know I sound like I'm ranting but trust me, do yourself a favor and never see this movie.

RADIOHEAD - OK COMPUTER!  i just bought hail to the thief and its OK but not nearly as good as OK Comp!<br />my favorite songs are the ones where after listening to them about 3 times, you decide you want to overdose on painkillers and sleeping pills!  that was a joke, but be warned!  this album is kinda depressing!  dont give it to your mother that just attempted suicide in an attempt to remove you from her life!<br />i love radiohead.  so should you.
0385509456|4.0|I have read many books and have since forgetton what &quot;good literature&quot; is.  I confine myself now to reading books that make me laugh, wince, or just turn the pages even wee into the night. <BR>This book grabs you by the neck and doesn't let you go. It's a good thing it's only 200 or so pages.
B00003CXA4|5.0|Anyone who has already seen \\"Gandhi\\" doesn't need me to tell them how great this movie is.  Over twenty years after its initial release, it still has the power to touch viewers of all ages on a deeply emotional and personal level.  That's because its basic message of love, peace, and harmony - or at least the human desire to aspire to them - is timeless and universal.  <br />As a high-school world history teacher, this is the only full-length feature movie which I use in my classroom.  For the past six years, year after year, I have watched hundreds of teenagers become fully engaged in this movie.  Rarely does it occur that one of them finds nothing of value in this story.<br />In just a little over three hours, so much history is brought to life in \\"Gandhi.\\"  While individual clips can be used at various points in a modern world history curriculum, I have found the movie most valuable when it is show continuously, in its entirety, after students have already been made familiar with all of the appropriate thematic topics.  \\"Gandhi\\" addresses all of the following:<BR>1)  the Apartheid system of South Africa<BR>2)  the impact of European colonialism<BR>3)  the Indian home rule movement<BR>4)  non-violent, civil disobedience<BR>5)  Hinduism and Islam (Hinduism does get much more attention)<BR>6)  the partition of India and Pakistan<BR>When one considers the current state of affairs between India and Pakistan, the relevance of this movie to current affairs becomes unquestionable.<br />Over half a century after Gandhi's death, his message has continued to be an inspiration for millions, from all walks of life - from Martin Luther King Jr. to Cesar Chavez to John Lennon to the students in my class.  <br />Sure, the movie's portrayal of the historical figure of Gandhi is not entirely historically accurate - and it's important to discuss this with any class before, during, and after a viewing of this movie.  But I challenge anyone to find ANY movie which is 100% on the mark.  As historical based movies go, Gandhi is as good as they come.
0676973779|1.0|I read this book while on a 15 hour flight, and it is only because I was trapped in an airplane that I actually finished it..

078401213X|5.0|I have seen this movie three times already.  It is a great movie.  The basic plot is a guy named Max finds, after doing research, a math formula that governs the stock market.

B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah Jones has created a new sound for adult listners who are tired of the same old shuck and jive from other artists.  She's refreshing, light, simple and simplistic.  I purchased her CD over two months ago and still find that I need to listen to it everyday.  She's has that special sound that makes me think I'll purchase anything she produces without hearing a preview.  I can't wait for the next one. Good going Norah!  Keep up the great work!

B00005JLRT|1.0|I am completely dumbfounded by the existence of this movie. Rick Berman has finally succeeded in detroying a beloved franchise. The Next Generation was often an entertaining, if not thought-provoking series about the issues that face humanity, even in a futuristic setting. But the succession of terrible motion pictures is almost the polar opposite of Kirk and Crew, who had a campy show, but respectable movies.<br />I once heard there is nothing more desperate and hopelessly optimistic than a Cubs fan. But watching these movies, I have to think that anyone who wishes more than uninspired nonsense from the Trek camp is worse.

B00006AFUR|5.0|30 sec. to Mars is all you'd expect a true rock band to be and more.  There are no cheesy lyrics or one hit wonders on it. If you haven't heard of them its probably because they don't have a big radio hit but thats a bonus to me - there's nothing like a radio station to overplay and make a group cliche.

B00005YW4H|5.0|I often caught myself singing along with Norah on the radio to her first hit &quot;Don't Know Why&quot; and thought to myself that I really wanted to get this CD.  After hearing &quot;Come Away With Me&quot;, I decided I MUST get this CD.  It is a romantic song, and made me wish I was in my hubby's arms (when I heard it on the radio while at work).  I read some of the reviews, but as I said, I already had my mind made up to get &quot;Come Away With Me&quot;.  My husband even likes it, which is not unusual, as he likes all types of music.  I do agree with some of the others who purchased this CD and stated that the music on here is very relaxing.  Case in point - If my almost 2 yr old is resisting going down for her nap or at bedtime, I put on Norah, and she will smile up at me, cuddle up close, and calm down immediately, and is asleep before the CD is half over.  I'm not saying this will automatically put everybody to sleep, I'm saying this is relaxing music!!  I pretty much like all of the songs on the CD, but some of my favorites on here are, of course, &quot;Don't Know Why&quot;, &quot;Seven Years&quot;, and &quot;Come Away With Me&quot;.  I highly recommend the easy-listening, relaxing sounds of Norah's first CD, and am looking forward to her second.
B00006F2TV|3.0|I happen to love most of the comic based movies that come on screen. I liked spider man a lot. Tobey M. does a good job of being a 'nerd boy' who wakes up one morning being better at everything.<br />There are a few details I didn't care for in the movie. Peter Parker is is supposed to be a genius. He is the one that stays up late at the lab and studies and researches when everyone else is asleep. In the movie, the most that his intelligence  is used when he mentions some trivia on spiders and mentioned to Norman Osborn that he understood the paper that Norman had written on Nanotechnology. (Originally he was bitten by a radioactive spider in the lab he was researching at.)<br />The finger bristles used for climbing is ok. His climbing wasn't explained in detail by comics. But I HATED that he was shooting webs directly from his wrists. Origin is that he invented wrist mounted cartriges to go along with the rest of his spider abilities. If he was getting the DNA crossed with a spider, his wrists would not be the part of his anatomy spinning webs.<br />The movie itself is fun to watch. It is just the little details that get me.
B00009V7PJ|5.0|Bravo Cher!  I've been lucky enough to see this tour three times, two of which I was pulled to the front row. The most recent time I saw her show, Cher talked to me about my costume (I was dressed as Sonny) and at the very end, she reached down and grabbed my hand.  At that moment one of my dreams truely did come true. I was absolutly blown away by Cher's power house voice, outrageous sense of style, and charming personality.  This woman is an absolute marvel!  She truley gave me something to &quot;believe&quot; in.  Granted people are quick to say Cher doesn't have much as far as substance, but WHO REALLY CARES!  She ROCKS in every sense of the word, and she does it with her own flare and compassion.  And like Cher says &quot;f*#@ 'em!&quot;  Yeah that's right, &quot;Follow this you b%@#$es!&quot;  God bless you CHER!
B00009L7N1|5.0|I have to admit i was not planing to buy the new Simply Red album although i have liked the group's past work, a friend of mine got it and after listening to it i was very surprised, this is a great album. The song &quot;Sunrise&quot; is my favorite, it is mixed with a Hall &amp; Oats classic song, no wonder this is a top 10 hit in the UK. Overall the album is perfect for a dinner party, it is an excellent production and i dare to say its one of the best pop albums i've heard in a long time. Simply Red are Simply back at its best this time.
0061020710|5.0|The Discworld series is probably my personal favorite book series out there. They are all funny, original, and interesting. The first book is all of these things, but not in the same way as the others. When Terry wrote this, he hadn't quite decided on a writing style, so you have to eally read closely to get a lot of the humor. The book is a bit more scientific about things, with dimensional rifts happening all over the place. It's a bit too absurd even by Discworld standards. These days, the references aren't as noticeable, either. You have to know about old characters like Fafhrd and The Gray Mouser and Conan the Barbarian to get a lot of the jokes.<br />However, it's different, and that's given it a special place in my heart. The characters develop well, all things considered, the characters manage to change drastically from the begining to the end, and I've enjoyed Rincewind since the begining, which is here. There's also quiet philosphy hidden in there, which has become a trademark in the Discworld books.<br />There are a lot of changes between the first book and the later novels. Discworld seems more like a Fantasyland than the later, more modern novels (that is to say both that the later novels are newer, but mostly that Discworld is more like the modern world in the later novels). The writing style as has already been mentioned, is different from the later books. Death, the only continuous character in te Discworld series, has undergone the most change. In this book, he's evil. He's not a sentimentalist, like in the later books, he's evil. The sentimentalist thing doesn't come until the later novels.<br />Overall, keep in mind that Discworld was still forming in Pratchett's mind at this time. Many of Practhcett's ideas hadn't formed yet, and his writing style was still developing. Keep that in mind, and you should enjoy yourself. A lot.
B00000ILDE|5.0|This is a totally different film from Alien. While Alien is more like the classic sci-fi/horror films of the 1950's (The Thing from Another World immediately comes to mind), Aliens is a classic sci-fi/action adventure. Not nearly as scary as the Ridley Scott classic, it is nonetheless a superior movie. The action and suspense never stops. The 17 added minutes, previously only available on laser disc and one of several VHS releases, never should've been deleted in the first place. This and Alien should be at or near the top of your &quot;Must Get&quot; sci-fi DVD collection.
B00009W0WM|5.0|If you own the earlier DVD release of this film, the obvious question is, &quot;how much better is this release technically?&quot;  The answer is that this version is a lot better.  The image is brighter than on the old release and crystal sharp.  The audio is much cleaner and stronger.  If you've ever compared the difference between a VHS release of a film and its DVD counterpart, you know the improvement; here, I find there is at least as much difference between the two DVD releases as with typical VHS/DVD comparisons.  So, buy up to this release if this film is important to you and you want to enjoy the very best visual and aural experience on one of the best films ever made.
B00000ILDF|2.0|The original Alien and its sequel Aliens are true classics of the genre. Different movies in almost every way, but equally superior film making. Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection are sorry excuses for sequels. They're classic examples of Hollywood greed. Bad stories wrapped in excellent SFX don't make memorable movies. Alien and Aliens should be at or near the top of your &quot;Must Have&quot; sci-fi/horror/action DVD list. Aliens 3 and Alien Resurrection...well, something has to be at the bottom o' the heap.
0784011931|3.0|Although with it's good intentions in the beginning, and special effects/ technoligical aspects, it could have been a milestone.<br />But, sadly, I don't agree it is.<br />He's back, here to protect young John Connor from the T-1000 (the truly best thing of ANYTHING of this film).<BR>Robert Patrick can pull this act off so well, that nobody, not even our best oscar winners out there could do as well, besides he looks the part, physically, and with his ice cold stares that are stealth, he was the best choice. A great actor too-not just here, but every movie I've seen him in. <BR>Arnold-uh...Ah-nold is really a pretty good actor....but what is a terminator/robot doing with an Austrian/Belgian accent? Please. Regular speech from your typical robot: 'Attack' or 'This does not help our mission'<BR>Arnold's Belgian T-101 : 'Uh-tack' or 'This doz not help our meeshion'<br />See? Regardless, yes, his acting and character is great. <BR>Edward Furlong has most of his character down pat, yet he slips now and then, like the 'cool dude' jokes, which , well, the way he put them, weren't funny, and was annoying with the 'rad, dude' stuff. His dialouge that was given to him wasn't the best either. Like, 'We've got Skynet by the (you know)' <br />WHY SO 90's cool? Even though that's the kind of dialouge going around then, it's not the kind of humour that this movie needed. They are trying too hard ! Just be funny or natural. If needed. IT'S LIKE THEY ALWAYS HAVE TO HAVE a sarcastic 90's style coooool remark. Stupid.<BR>Linda Hamilton is trying too hard with her part. Yes, she's suppose to be angry, scared, and numb to a lot of things. Still, she did allright.<BR>The acting with everybody, except for Robert Patrick, is a bit too tidy or pleasent for a movie that's suppose to be a thriller-sci-fi, so it comes too tight as a movie. The 'nuke ' message is not really preached, more just given as a fact, which is better. Good for Cameron on that part. <BR>Maybe the violence, language, andeven the attitude was kept that way so it was easier to understand for teens, who flockled to this movie, since it was 14-AA and not rated 'R' in a lot of places. Not fair to us. And still too violent for teens anyways. <BR>Overall, the movie was not natural enough. Good, not great. And any other things great about the film cannot save it from this factual look at the weak parts.<BR>The worst part is , no offense Arnold, the physique and acting skills are very good on his part.....the accent, if he couldn't skip it, then they should have kept him a mute, which wouldn't work, or get somebody else, for all three of the Terminator flicks.<br />P.S. - the scene where Arnold smiles while Edward Furlong agrees silently that the weapon he found looked cool on him wasn't very practical....he smiles? <BR>A) he's a robot, and making him smile makes him less of a convincing Terminator.<BR>B) he didn't even know WHAT a smile was or what it is to a human to smile...so why did he? They tried toooo quickly to make him toooo human. He's JUST beginning to learn. The words or lines he says that aren't the norm to him (&quot;Hasta la vista, baby&quot; or &quot;He'll live&quot;) are funny, but better that he says it in a robotic way....he's a robot, so keep his disposition that way!
B00003CX9Q|5.0|I just watched the 2002 reissue of E.T., and then the 1982 original on the other disk. What probably would have been the best combination would be to leave the 1982 version intact, and then add in those couple of deleted scenes.<br />One change definitely resulted in loss of effect: On Halloween night, mother tells son (1982), &quot;You're not going as a terrorist! You won't get two blocks in this neighborhood&quot; (approximate quote). In 2002, &quot;terrorist&quot; is changed to &quot;hippie,&quot; and the line is left out of the English subtitles.<br />Maybe &quot;terrorist&quot; is no longer as funny as it was in 1982. But &quot;hippie&quot; doesn't cut it in the context. If you don't want to use &quot;terrorist,&quot; then change it to &quot;serial killer&quot; or something similar. That maintains the dark humor that was intended.<br />Otherwise, it was great to have both versions available in one package, and all those extras: especially the feature on making the film and the one on the reunion. Spielberg is extremely comfortable in these kinds of interviews and presents himself in a vivid, down-to-earth manner.
B00001QEBQ|2.0|What could have been a great film, with a terrific story, and a terrific cast of voices, fails to be a truly great Disney film.  Eddie Murphy is not welcome here as the '90's LIKE' dragon, who's lines are soooo coooool, and rad. I felt like I was listening to a cartoon from Saturady mornings! Why not keep him still GOOFY and FUNNY but historically correct? It's like Disney is so afraid that if the dialouge of the kids we have today isn't in there somewhere, then it'll flop. Not TRUE. My niece brought this up, and she's only eight! She asked me why do some of the characters in the movie not sound historic? 'Most of them sound and act like us today' were her exact words.<br />'Be A Man' and other songs are sure winnners, keeping right to the story, and the culture VISUALLY is great and acurate, so why not keep the culture of the way people spoke to each other back then? They had humour too! Just not this sarcastic ' Right on, keep it cool daddy-oh' junk. Some of the jokes were funny.....like the part where Eddie Murphy's dragon was wearing the stone head of a guardian dragon to be disguised so he can save the day was hilarious! Or Mulan swimming with the soldiers, and had to hide her 'woman' body since she cannot reveal that she's not a man....poor Mulan. Lousy parts,(too many of them) like the BACON &amp; EGGS ??!! (in ancient China??!!) for breakfast, or of course, they had to use fireworks at the end, like a &quot;MISSLE&quot; to keep things a bit too familliarly modern.....you guys can't be original...have to be so SAFE FOR MODERN COOOOL RAD KIDS, HUH? <br />So, keep up good humour and great stories...and the visuals culturally.....the dialouge and attitude stinks of most of the characters. Stop modernizing any of your movies that are suppose to be historical!!!<br />Disney, for the last twenty years, you STINK.
0792106989|4.0|The Man who shot Liberty Valance is a great western, a film that excels in supberb story telling and believable acting.  I thought this film looked beyond the cliches of most westerns and gave us a great good guy in Ransom Stoddard (Stewart) and a terrific bad guy in Liberty Valance (Marvin).  <br />The plot is easy to grasp, it's fun to watch, and it has a rising theme.  The theme is the often the over used David and Goliath, underdog against topdog storyline, but in this movie Ford uses it masterfully.  Stoddard is a lawyer from back East who goes out West to expand his horizons so to speak and he gets himself in an immediate fix with the local villain in Liberty Valance.  After two or three conflicts, it becomes apparent that it's going to be a good guy/bad guy square off or showdown, which kind of builds some suspense in this film as to when it's going to happen.<br />The characters are unbelievabley real.  Lee Marvin, and only Lee Marvin could play the wild and cruel Liberty Valance.  I loved his character so much because he defines the wild, lawless West.  <BR>Jimmy Stewart is Ransom Stoddard, who is sort of a weakling, unsure and unprepared on what's ahead of him.  I liked his character development because it grew from this weakling to someone with serious influence to the other characters.<BR>John Wayne is Tom Donovan, whose character sorts of starts out on top but kinda lingers in the end, is really no different from his past characters in other films.  To be frank, I really didn't see the huge value in Wayne's character, the film might've survived without him and just focused its entire energy on the conflicts between Marvin and Stewart's characters.<BR>Vera Miles is Halley, the girlfriend of Donovan, but yet develops serious feelings for newcomer Stoddard.  I don't want to give away too much of the plot, but as usual Miles does a good job playing a western woman with some flair.<br />Ford chose this film to be in Black and White, although in 1962 films were being created in color.  Ford did this because it created an atmosphere about it that somehow managed to make this film more appealing this way.  It's difficult to describe, but after you see it, you'll probably agree this wouldn't have looked all that grand in color.<br />The reason why I give this film four stars, even though I've given it nothing but admiration, is because I was satisfied with this film but not stunned in awe like I could've been.  Liberty Valance needed an even larger roll because his character was larger than life and so memorable.  The romance in the film needs to be more intense, a bigger aspect in this film.  It's dull but it had such great potential in taking off and all it did was hiccup.  And Wayne's character is nothing original.  As you will see, you gain nothing from his character.  If anything, Wayne is there because it's a Ford film and because he's the Duke and he bullies his way to be the cover boy of every great western.<BR>Don't get me wrong, I love John Wayne, but in this film I'm just not sure if he was needed.  Sure after you see the end, you may say \\"Hey he had an important role!\\"  But could it have been played by someone else?  Yes indeed.  Could John Wayne play Ransom Stoddard?  No sir.  <br />In overall satisfaction this film is great.  It gives you a good story and you walk away pleased with it and you'll probably want to see it again.  On the other hand, it had potential to really explode in certain parts in both emotion and conflict, but the Duke walks in the door just as its getting to the peak....(you'll see).<BR>Buy this film, it's a keeper.  Among the better westerns I've seen.<br />Grade: B+
B00005AQE8|4.0|Let me start off with this : Tupac is a storyteller. If you want a party album,do not get this.Everyone already probably knew that,though. The second cd is better than the first one. Best song on the first cd : &quot;Only God Can Judge Me.&quot; Best song on the second cd : &quot;Shorty Wanna Be A Thug.&quot; Lets see,all in all, a whole lot of good songs, but not nearly enough to make it &quot;the best rap album ever&quot; as some of the reviews say.Even though its not the best rap album ever,it is still worthy of the money that it costs. Buy this. You won't be dissapointed.
0060934913|5.0|Anthony Bourdain's witty and humorous writing style kept me laughing out very, very loud as I read these informative and eye-opening tales of real life in the kitchen and his interesting background.  Most importantly, however, this is a no-holds-barred  look behind the swinging kitchen doors.  If you are thinking of becoming a chef or getting involved in the culinary industry, this book will put your feet on level ground before your dreams and ideas fly out of control.  Not that it's a bad thing, mind you!!  This is brutally honest experience and a great way to test the waters before you're thrown into the culinary pool and you either learn to swim or sink like a rock.
B000002H2Z|5.0|The Cure's discography can be divided in half with a thick, black line into two halves.  On one side, are the dark albums (Pornography, Disintegration, Bloodflowers, Faith), where epic, depressing soundscapes are plenty.  And on the other side are their lighter, poppier works (Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Boys Don't Cry, Wish), which favor catchiness and instrumental experimentation over raw emotion.  The Head On The Door falls into the latter category.  All ten tracks are perfect 80s pop songs that get stuck in your head and never fail to delight.<br />Whether it be the dancable Eurobeat of \\"In between days\\", the spanish-flavored \\"The Blood\\", or the quirky \\"Six Different Ways\\", this album has something for everyone and is a good introduction to the Cure.  It won't stick with you immediately, but you'll soon come to love it.<br />If you're looking to get into the Cure, make The Head on the Door your first purchase.  Or, if you're already a Cure fan, I give this album my *highest* recommendation.
B00009P1O5|4.0|This is not one of Neil's best, but it has a couple of highlights.  The opening song &quot;Opera Star&quot;,  and the closing  song &quot;Shots&quot;.  This was the last album that Neil made for Reprise Records before joining Geffen records in 1982.  He would eventually return to Reprise in 1988.  It was almost as if he were just fulfilling contractual obligations.  I bought this album when it very first came out in 1981.  There is something about Neil that's totally endearing,  even when he puts out sub-par albums.  I think they did a good job of remastering this one.  It brings back a lot of memories. I remember my Wife and I listening to this when we were on our honeymoon.  Fun times. Any true Neil fan has to have this in their collection.  Rock on Neil!!!!
B00009EIQE|5.0|If you are looking for in your faces rocking blues don't buy this.  If you want to hear what the blues is all about and where it came from, than get this now.  This is a great addition to any blues collection. Buddy is paying homage to all those players who really lived the blues and paved the way for what we call the blues today.  Simply a fantastic effort.  If you like this, check out Bowling Green John Cephas. Another unsung hero to the peidmont blues.
0151008116|5.0|The structure of the book is dazzling, and, without giving anything away, it makes one believe the most seemingly audacious plot points.  Martel's framework is so carefully crafted that the impossible becomes credible.  As with Citizen Kane, the book opens with a reporter's attempt to learn the truth about an enigmatic episode in the life of a man.  And just as with the Welles film, just when you think you have a handle on the story in Life of Pi, it veers left leading you to yet another twist.  The biggest surprise could be the ending, which is reason enough, among many, to re-read the entire book.  So often with a good book, the ending disappoints, but the ending here is jaw-dropping, mind-blowing and provocative.  Like Joseph Campbell, Martel clearly wants to examine the very heart of myth, belief, hope and faith, but these weighty topics are handled in such a highly entertaining fashion that it makes the book a not-stop page turner.
0312965788|5.0|You don't have to be an animal lover to enjoy this collection of heart-warming true stories told by a country vet. Some of the stories are funny, others are sad; none will leave you unmoved. I highly recommend this book.
B00009P1O0|5.0|I've had a copy of this album for awhile, dubbed from well worn vinyl.  Upon listening for the first time, the very first thought to enter my mind was &quot;why in God's name is this no longer available?&quot;  This album is nothing less than a masterpiece.  A slow, gloomy masterpiece of despair, but a masterpiece none the less.  Sure its no surprise that &quot;On The Beach&quot; didn't do well on its initial release - it wasn't &quot;Harvest&quot;, and his newfound pop fans hadn't the faintest idea what Neil was capable of.  But &quot;Tonight's The Night&quot; had a similarly lukewarm reception, and it later became one of his most loved albums, while &quot;On The Beach&quot; seemed undeservedly destined for obscurity.  &quot;Tonight's The Night&quot; is a fantastic album, but &quot;On The Beach&quot; is every bit as essential, if not superior.  Buy it.  Buy it now.  <br />This new remastered edition sounds fantastic, its amazing what they can do these days in the restoration of older recordings.  Its about time this fine album was made available, and the fact that it now sounds better than ever certainly doesn't hurt.
B00003CX8U|4.0|A great movie like this deserved better video treatment than this received. It may be anamorphic, but it pulsates in many scenes.<br />Also just Dolby Surround, not digital in any way.<br />Maybe if this DVD version sells, they'll fix the video and re-sell it to the fans again. That seems to be a common practice for DVDs.<br />Five stars for the movie and minus one star for the video.
B00008O31H|5.0|. . . scorching, HOT. The guitar playing is downright raunchy. This is an album of true love songs, many of which are downright sweet, but don't worry, there's no soft mush to be found. I love Auerbach's slushy vocal style and the content of the songs, and I admit to being a bit disappointed to learn that he and Carney, the drummer, are only 23 years old. (Maybe I'm just jealous.) <br />However, this is the real thing; these guys are no poseurs. They're both natural musicians, and you can tell that they've spent years listening to and loving a lot of great music because it all seems to be pouring back out of them -- in a NEW way.  <br />The Black Keys is not white boy blues. It's blues-rock, and it takes that subgenre to a new place, though the band's many blues and '60s rock influences are obvious. The only criticism I'd level is that there gets to be a sameness about halfway through the album. But each song is a powerhouse on its own and some (like the first three) are absolutely brilliant. <br />Enough already with the White Stripes comparisons! There is no connection. Their names are reminiscent of each other, and they both have 2 bandmembers. That's the extent of their similarity.  I love both bands, but they work for totally different moods.
B00003CXQX|5.0|This film was not on my list of must-see or even want to see, but I watched with my children when it came home as a rental.  I loved it for the humor (Kronk is wondrous!) and Eartha Kitt as the voice of Izma is marvelous (what happened to my voice? Oh well..)<br />I enjoy the humor which is not slapstick and not the Simpsons, but somewhere in between.  The story line revolves around the arrogant, spoiled emperor and ends with a friendship that is unlikely but enjoyable by all.
B0000AI44Q|4.0|I would give this one somewhere in the upper 3 to 4 stars.  Tried and true Neil Young fans like myself, who have followed him for years, will like this album, as it is, well, new Neil, and has a nice NY & Crazy Horse sound to it in which they sound as tight but easy together as always.  I do like it, and it grows on you as you play it, hopefully while slightly buzzed or on a road trip where you can let it sink in, Grateful Dead style (but maybe don't be 'road trippin' while slightly buzzed, America).  It has that kind of rolling, rythmic feel to it to me.  I am not sure we can say we love it though, as I think I was expecting more as I followed the hype about its release (I wish a song had been made using the bass line he used as audio on the Greendale promo website).  This is probably not the album with which to begin your Neil Young collection, unless you want to take his pulse and work back.  This is a story album, in which the songs are all connected, telling about the weird state of America these days through the adventures of the Green family, which is touched by a drug-related murder of a policeman by one of its own (the drug war), law enforcement abuses, the relentless media onslaught we are faced with (as we willingly turn on the crap on our TVs), and which even gets into environmentalism and the destruction of the Alaskan wilderness.  Neil Young seems troubled and reflective about all these things, but I am left saying So What? as perhaps a lot of us do these days who seem so anesthetized toward taking any type of real action outside of voting for perhaps different-seeming republicrats.  Yes, terrible--pass the pretzels, hasn't affected me yet.  Anyway, I found the concert for this album very enjoyable and the thing is probably best seen live to appreciate it.  Neil Young makes some humorous self-references in the material and he overall seems like a guy who is troubled about the state of affairs, but has no better solution than for all to get more involved.  Maybe he is right and that is ultimately the best he/we can do.  (But even he, amazingly, in the concert tour, used an attractive, young scantily-clad woman as Sun Green--cheescake in a Neil Young concert?!). Musically, most of the songs are long and this gives the album a reflective, meditative or trance-like effect (maybe you shouldn't listen on long drives after all) at best.  The album reminds me of Neil's commentary in \\"Crime in the City\\" on the Freedom album.  \\"Bandit\\" is an acoustic standout and I also enjoyed \\"Falling From Above\\", \\"Sun Green\\" and \\"Be the Rain.\\"  However, again, you probably won't see the budding college artists singing these over a good old \\"Old Man\\" rendition.  \\"Sun Green\\" does have the memorable line \\"Hey Mister Clean, you're dirty now too\\" which conjurs up images of the fat CEO and corporate corruption, but again, this album is as unlikey to fix our woes as Tom Petty's last one was to fix the music industry.
B00005JLSE|4.0|I would say Chicago is a different type of musical. It does not revolve around love but hatred and deception which gives this movie it's distinctfulness. I did enjoy how they  incorporated the musical numbers in the movie. I feel that Catherine Zeta-Jones deserved her Oscar win, she did a fantastic job in this movie. Actually, I believe the movie deserved all the Oscars it won except Best Picture. It was definitely not the Best Picture of the year. The Oscar should have gone to either The Hours or The Pianist. I agree that Moulin Rouge! is a much better film and should have won last year's Oscar for Best Picture with Nicole Kidman as Best Actress (luckily she received the much deserved award playing as Virginia Woolf in The Hours), but things don't always work how you want them to. Overall this is a good film and not your typical musical, but if you're really looking for that musical experience, Moulin Rouge! is what you should watch.
B0000AI44Q|4.0|I saw one of the U.S. Greendale tour stops and was swept away in the energy Neil generated with this material. That extra spark is lacking on the record. Still, it's an essential purchase if you're a fan. Highlights are Falling From Above, Devil's Sidewalk, Leave the Driving, Carmichael and Grandpa's Interview.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|In today's music world,Greendale is a masterpiece.It is full of passionate comment about the world today and where it is going.It is wonderful to see Neil at the top of his game with something new and powerful,when many artists of his age are content to recyle their past works.Today's music is dominated by meaningless pop,and it is a pleasure to have Neil giving us a work with real meaning.
1577311523|2.0|Before you see my rating of two stars and vote that my review was unhelpful; let me explain.  I enjoy spiritual teachings; I really do.  I feel that it allows me to enrich my life and see things in a different light.  Naturally, then, learning to enjoy the present moment would be something that I really have a desire to do.  The implications of being able to put all your worries and fears away (or, should I say, bring them to the surface and then deal with them) would be tremendous.  I guess I should also say that I am someone who has trouble accepting the present moment for what it is; I tend to worry too much about what the future is going to hold.  That said, I honestly hoped that this book would provide me with a way of achieving that.  <br />  I realize that in any spiritual teaching, certain concepts are going to be repeated.  This is necessary, especially since the concepts presented are probably going to seem new to most readers.  However, I felt that the whole book was nothing but a repetition of this general idea: the mind is the root of all problems, because it has taken us over (meaning that we can't control it, but rather, it controls us).  However, we can free ourselves from this by becoming totally present.  <br />  The author then elaborates on this statement using many different phrases, such as, &quot;Feel the power of this moment and the fullness of Being.  Feel your presence&quot; (pg. 70).  He also uses the typically vague promises that tend to accompany books like this, such as, &quot;...You can be at peace.  There may be sadness and tears, but provided you have relinquished resistance, underneath the sadness you will feel a deep serenity, a stillness, a sacred presence&quot; (pg. 148).  To me, it seemed as if the author was simply repeating the same basic idea over and over again; which, again, is not necessarily a bad thing.  However, it begins to become annoying when the book has as many pages as this does; and after reading all of them youfeel as though you could have just read the title and received all the information from that.  <br />  As I said previously, the idea of this book was very promising.  Even the techniques contained within the book, though inspiring, were never very well explained.  After reading this book a couple times, I still don't really know how to get to that spot of inner peace.  I don't know, either, how to feel the &quot;...still, observing presence itself behind the content of your mind, the silent watcher&quot; (pg. 46).  I don't even think there was a technique telling you how to achieve that, actually.  Sure, the author has included some meditations, but they're nothing new.  The same old &quot;Direct your attention into the body.  Feel it from within&quot; (pg. 93) type meditations, which can be found almost anywhere else, even on web pages (for free, no less) are included in this book.  <br />  Overall, this book did not live up to it's hype.  I found it to be long and rambling; the author took the title of the book and expanded it into 191 pages full of the same idea phrased with different words.  He attempts to tackle some other subjects too, of course, such as relationships.  However, he basically uses the same &quot;power of NOW&quot; approach to these as well; meaning that he suggested a relationship would evolve into true love when both partners had eliminated their respective egos and become completely immersed in the now.  That's the solution for EVERY problem, it seems.  So he's just using the same message for different problems, which seems to be more of a &quot;pie in the sky&quot; promise to me.
B00005JKNF|1.0|Altman set out to make a pretentious British drawing room drama, and he certainly out-did himself. This movie is excrutiatingly dull. Soporific. Don't be fooled. It's boring. And the sound is bad too. Well, maybe that helps, because the enunciation of the actor's lines are horrible. You can't understand a word their saying. So it's a double whammy. I really wanted this movie to work. But it's bad. Still don't believe? Check out how many used DVD's are for sale -- and the rock bottom prices. Folks can't get rid of them fast enough. Hopefully Altman will stay in Europe -- as he promised.
0140186409|5.0|\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is an American classic which, though showing its age, says much to the America of today.<br /><br />A masterful story teller, Steinbeck unfolds the story of the Joads, a family of dispossessed Okies, set adrift in a sea which they do not know, by forces which they do not understand.  As we watch them lose their farm, travel with them in the truck to California, then search with them for work in their new world, we begin to appreciate the life of a penniless migrant of the Dust Bowl Era.<br /><br />As enthralling as this story is, it is periodically interrupted by chapters of social commentary.  Nobody seized the land, it was the bank.  No one set the wages, the growers association did.  There is no personal responsibility.  The little people are crushed by impersonal organizations.<br /><br />The theme of class struggle runs deeply, but is seems a bit dated.  When Steinbeck wrote, the Joads probably seems to be part of a struggle driven by deliberate decisions made by people who were willing to ruin the lives of little people for profit, all the while hiding behind the claim that their actions were compelled by impersonal forces.<br /><br />It seems that, to Steinbeck, the struggle over land was one in which \\"The People\\" could determine the outcome.  Knowing what we now know, the mechanization of agriculture set in motion forces which inexorably reduced demand for agricultural labor.  The prosperity which the world enjoys today is incompatible with world the Joads knew in Oklahoma.  The Tom Joads reaped the Grapes of Wrath, but many of their grandchildren eat from the Horn of Plenty.  The tragedy is not, as Steinbeck seems to posit, that the Joads lost their land, but that they were unable to successfully adapt to the changing times.  They could not adapt but, in their own ways, they did cope.<br /><br />Although the specific struggle of the Okies is passed and many of their grandchildren have achieved prosperity in the mainstream economy, their problem remains.  There are still economically marginal people unable to adapt to the changing times, people who have to cope in their own ways.  They too, have a spokesman in John Steinbeck.<br /><br />This book is powerful.  It is moving.  Come, ride into yesteryear.r problem remains.

B00005JM1Y|2.0|If you like films where the self-assured hero consistently makes incorrect predictions (\\"This is the most secure place in the British Isles\\" just before an explosion in the background takes out every decent British agent), you'll love this one. The joke structure gets repeated again and again and again. The only other frequent joke is English's Bean-like behaviour when he thinks he's alone in his bathroom.<br />This movie is a yawn from start to finish, redeemed only by an original take on the requisite car chase: when English's high-speed sports car has been impounded by the clampers for illegal parking, he drives off in the truck carrying his car.<br />After making so many masterpieces for the small screen (namely 'Mr Bean', 'Blackadder' and 'Not the Nine o'Clock News'), it's so frustrating that he has yet to star in a great film. (His funniest movie performance so far is still the cameo vicar in 'Four Weddings'.) Maybe he should take a few risks by taking the Alec Guinness roles in a re-make of 'Kind Hearts and Coronets'.<br />The sad fact is that when you have fantastic talent and you get financial rewards to match, the urge to work diminishes and some of the inventive genius disappears. Atkinson does very few TV shows now because British TV is so poorly paid compared to movies -- hence the main reason why Bean is now a cartoon. (Financial reasons are also what keep writer Richard Curtis, Atkinson's buddy from Oxford, off our TV screens.)<br />Atkinson's on-screen personas have always kept women at a psychological distance. Most of the time, his characters were desperately afraid of women -- he found them incomprehensible. Yes, he may have bedded a couple in 'Blackadder', but you get the impression he was no more intimate or revealing of himself than he would have been in a pub conversation with a man. Here in 'Johnny English', we see the character genuinely open up to a woman, Natalie Imbruglia. The revelation is not a particularly attractive sight, but I know how the middle-aged male ego is keen to show its interest in women.<br />I have been following Atkinson's career since seeing him in the 'Inferiors' review in the late 1970s at Oxford. In comic terms, 'Johnny English' is the low point. If he is ever to shine again, he needs to re-think his approach. I don't think Hollywood is the answer for Rowan. I'm pretty sure that Richard Curtis is.how the middle-aged male ego is keen to show its interest in women.<br />I have been following Atkinson's career since seeing him in the 'Inferiors' review in the late 1970s at Oxford.

B00008NRI7|3.0|Average is the only word I could use to describe this movie.  There was nothing outstanding about the rapport between Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock.  The plot was predictable- evil money hungry man, woman out to save the world, one community center at a time, blah, blah, blah.  It's a perfectly good time waster though, after you've checked out all 187 channels on the cable system.<br />I didn't hate it, but I don't have anything else to say about it.

B0000AM6K2|5.0|on my first listen i couldnt decide if i loved this album or not, but with a few more listens  i realized just how brilliant it really is.  I havent heard much of Rouse's early material, but from what ive heard it seems like this is a deparure for Rouse.  The album is named 1972, which is odd because the songs all have poppy, late 60s-like choruses,  but almost (dare i say) disco like and funk beats from the late 70s. The combination is somehow breathtaking and while each song is very distinct, they all flow together with the same sort of sound that makes this album really damn good.
B00005O5JV|2.0|Beautiful Reese Witherspoon is the silly but highly-motivated title character in this by-the-numbers comedy. Witherspoon's star potentiol carries this stinker of a film pretty far. The female audience will surely get a kick out of this one. Reese gets to show that despite the fact that she is dismissed as an \\"annoying bimbo with big breasts\\" that she is actually a \\"very smart annoying bimbo with big breasts\\". This movie is far too cute and fluffy for my taste but if you're in to that type of stuff, knock yourself out.
6300214435|5.0|This movie takes a lot of [stuff] for being the weakest out of the Indiana Jones trilogy, but this is the one that has grown on me the most as I got older.  <br />Harrison Ford plays Indiana at his best in this movie.  He's a little darker, a lot funnier, more of a comic-book superhero, a little more human, and keeps his cool through the whole movie.  It helps that he has Willy and Short Round to bounce lines off for comic relief.  A lot of people found Willy annoying, as did I when I was younger.  Now I think she played the role perfect -- you were SUPPOSED to find her annoying.  That's what made the look on Indy's face so priceless when she *finally* frees them from the ceiling trap.  The script is by far the wittiest out of the trilogy, and the humor is much more mature -- \\"No it wasn't my head, it was my ... my misunderstanding.\\"<br />And, by the end, the characters have all gone through a little growing process.  Willy's a little tougher and Indy isn't as selfish.  He didn't get what he was looking for, but it all worked out ok in the end anyway.  Best ending of the series.
6302038308|5.0|Not so much a sequel as it is remake, EVIL DEAD 2 takes the horror comedy genre to a whole new level. Campbell is goofy hero, Ash, who once again does battle with the demonic forces that have been unleashed in the woods. Filled with gruesome over-the-top slapstick and some of the very best make-up effects (courtesy of the good people at KNB) ever seen in that time, &quot;Evil Dead 2&quot; is a ghoulish good time. Sam Raimi has clearly been inspired by The Three Stooges here as you get to see Ash borrow a whole lot of their old gags. Actor Bruce Campbell was correct when he called this &quot;the mother of all sequels&quot;.
B000063UR2|5.0|I absolutley loved this film when it was first released here in america. But I never knew that it was cut and torn apart so badly for the north american audience. Although confused by the american version's story, I stilled loved the movie for its possiblites and its visuals. But after I watched the international version on this DVD set, I have come to the conclusion this is one of the best classics of all time, in its original form. Anyone who disagree's obviously has no taste for fairy tales. And has no open imagination. Ridley Scott should have never ever touched this movie and tore it apart as badly as he did for the american market. Its sad that it was done that way, the american audience missed one of the greatest fairy tales to come to film. If you havent seen it, then watch the international version, and never watch the american version.<BR>And also to add, the acting is absolutley fantastic. Especially Tim Curry. Kudos to him.<BR>As for visuals, stunning, and one of the best devils or satan to come to film. Costumes are fantastic, sets are incredible. Truly a classic.<BR>As for the story, a great fairy tale of good and evil. Very well written.

B00006IR5S|5.0|I imagine that the art of scoring a film is quite different than writing for a symphony orchestra with its hall audience:  the musical movements must fit the story, and for film, must be resolve rather quickly as each scene of the film passes by quickly (especially in Harry Potter).  Williams, aside from near plagiaristic sequences of music similar to Holst and, should I say it, his own Star Wars soundtracks, has nonetheless produced a second soundtrack that is better than the original.  Fawkes the Phoenix is a hopeful, gradually intensifying piece of melody that is one of the most briliant pieces of music I have ever heard.  It is woven throughout the soundtrack through other familiar themes and sequences that appear in the first Harry Potter soundtrack, but is unique and different from them.  I really like Williams' use of his strings, and this soundtrack puts them to the test a bit more than average a la Stravinsky.  I recommend this soundtrack for its many moods and ability to make sense as a coherent whole.  Kudos to Williams again.  I wonder if I'll recognize any sequences in any other pieces of music.  Will I?  I hope not.

0140288503|5.0|I read this during my Sophmore year.  At the time, and even still, it is by far one of my favorite books.  I have been a long time fan of war novels, but until I read Black Hawk Down no book really stood out as an excellent piece of literature.  Mark Bowden has an amazing talent to depict events that happened years ago as if you are in them in the middle of them while reading.  Black Hawk Down, as many of you probably know, is about the United States Special forces in Somalia in 1993 during a campaign to establish some sort of stability in the war torn region.  Black Hawk down is specifically about the day battle between Somalis and U.S. special froces after attempting to kidnap some prominent members of the powerful gang that went absolutely to hell.  Although Black Hawk Down is a very harsh read, it reads like an event you actually are participating in.  I woudl recomend Black Hawk Down to anybody who isd interested in Modern military history, or just military history in general.  If you have a weak stomach, there are parts of Black Hawk down that will be hard to swallow.  Black Hawk Down is one of my favorite books ever.
6300216268|5.0|I loved this love story with all of it's dark comedy- Harold it constantly trying to kill himself and so him mother just starts ignoring it and acting like it's anyother everyday thing.  The ending was a killer- it must have been so painful, but you know that a new chapter has opened in the life of Harold- and at the same time very uplifting.  Harold and Maude have such an interesting relationship, you feel like you should look away and let them live their unique life privately, but it's so appealing in a dark way that you just can't look away after all. Rent it for a glimpse into a different kind of life. It's definatly an artsy movie....you have to be open to watching it.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I had never been as blown away by a film as I was when I first saw 'Donnie Darko' a little under a year ago.<br />In fact, when I saw this at the cinema, I went back the next afternoon and saw it for a second time. It's that good. Like 'Fight Club', it's definitely the sort of film where a second viewing is really beneficial.<br />I went in knowing little to nothing about this film, and that's the best way to approach it. The less you know about 'Darko', the better your enjoyment of the film will be. This is the sort of film that doesn't treat it's audience like children. It doesn't provide a simple story, it doesn't offer up any easy answers. This is the sort of brave and innovative filmmaking that makes up for all the insipid 'paint-by-numbers' films that have become standard multiplex fare. It's this sort of film that restores your faith in cinema. Every performance here is no less than first class, every moment no less than totally engaging.<br />The DVD is wonderful, and the two commentaries - one with director Richard Kelly and star Jake Gyllenhaal, another with various other cast members including Drew Barrymore and (a very subdued) Jena Malone - are the highlights out of the multitude of bonus features on offer.  'Darko' fans will have great fun pouring over the other special features as well, including trailers, deleted scenes and 'The Philosophy of Time Travel.'<br />'Donnie Darko' is a cryptic, haunting gem of a movie that will stay with you long after the final credits roll.

B00005JMD3|4.0|Being an avid player of games like Rainbow Six and Splinter Cell, I was pretty excited to see what S.W.A.T. and other counter-terrorism missions were like when real people did them. And, altough this was only a movie, I found it very entertaining.<BR>Right off the bat, I noticed that most of the actor/actresses played very stereotypical roles. Samuel L. Jackson is your grizzled old veteran, Colin Farrell is the new guy, LL Cool J is the comic relief, and Michelle Rodriguez is the tough tomboy chick who always gets shot or bitten by a zombie in the end. Whoever that guy was that played the evil \\"100 MILLION DOLLARS!\\" guy probably will land a lot more roles like that as well.<BR>Another thing I noticed was the amount of Dr. Pepper cans. Just look for them. They're everywhere. In a row of dull, white bottles, a Red Fusion bottle is sitting at the end of the row. My friend counted 30 or so during the whole thing. <BR>All of that aside, one can find plenty of enjoyment in S.W.A.T. And maybe do yourself a favor and pick up Rogue Spear afterwards.
1400034779|4.0|I read this book in one day.  In scarcely populated land-locked Botswana,  Mma Ramotswe inherits 180 head of cattle from her frugal father.  From age 18 to age 30 Obed Ramotswe worked in an Oppenheimer mine in Johannesburg and saved almost everything he earned buying cattle.  But in the mines his lungs filled with dust, eventually causing his death of emphysema  at age 64.  From the proceeds of the sale of her father's cattle, Precious Ramotswe buys a house and an office, hires as her Secretary Mma Makutsi, a widow who \\"passed the general typing and secretarial examinations with an average grade of ninety-senven per cent\\" and opens \\"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency.\\"  From her eyes as a detective, we have a fascinating view of life in Botswana: a crocodile devouring a man being baptized, a witchdoctor kidnapping an eleven year old boy, an Indian merchant prince spying on his teenage daughter, an imposter Daddy living off of his successful \\"daughter,\\" twin doctors one of whom has a degree and the other not, a man who keeps filing claims against different employers for the loss of  the same finger; and cars that always break down but are kept running by Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni    The main resources of this country are cattle and diamonds  and  70% of its  land is the lion inhabited Kalahari Desert. The people maintain the formalism of  an English colony.   It is a simple country, yet a country filled with morality and all the human emotions, joy and dispair, that can be found anywhere.  This is a book that should be read before the other books in the series as it sets the stage for the characters that will be developed later.
B00006CXXU|4.0|I remember being at clubs and always getting up to dance when &quot;Dirrty&quot; came on.  I had no idea that was Christina Aguilera!  I have always thought she had more talent than Miss Spears, but that's not saying a lot.  (Let's face it - Britney's voice is all studio mixing, while Christina has a pure, powerful voice.)  However, after listening to this album, I have a lot more respect for her.  This album is worth buying just for the song 'Dirrty'.  I think someone in a previous review called it a 'party anthem,' which is so perfect, because this song always got my party nights started.

B00005JKHN|5.0|The good faeries at Disney and Amazon.com provided me with an advance copy of the \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" Special Edition DVD, and I couldn't be more pleased.<br />The movie is (obviously) a classic, and the animation holds up well in the face of the modern, stylized approach to traditional animation. True, there aren't any computer-generated images in \\"Sleeping Beauty,\\" but it remains one of the best-crafted cartoons of all time.<br />I was very impressed with the sound and picture quality, and the choice to watch the movie widescreen or full-screen was a nice feature. It's the best presentation of \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" that I've ever seen.<br />The second disk is packed with in-depth information about the making of the movie, and the restoration of the film for this DVD release. It's great stuff for afficionados, but it's even interesting for casual fans.<br />Even if you already own a VHS copy of Disney's \\"Sleeping Beauty,\\" you should absolutely pick up the Special Edition DVD.

B000002KE2|5.0|Could Ozzy sing? Like a banshee.  Could Bill play drums like a one-man percussion section? Absolutely.  Are Tony and Geezer not the baddest axe-men on the face of the Earth? No doubt.  So why isn't Vol.4 the biggest selling album of all time?  It's because in the mindset of mass-media, serious lyrics only belong to the Bob Dylans and Johnny Cashes of the music world.  Four rockers from the north of England aren't supposed to sing about the realities of the world. And to do so is to overstep their bounds.  These guys started out making music to scare people and ended up making this MASTERPIECE of hard rock. The acoustic moments are there to show us that you don't have to be limited by any label defining who you are and what you can do.

0380807343|4.0|Dark fairy tale about a young girl named Coraline who is fond of exploring. One day when she is exploring her new house, she finds a doorway to another world. At first glance, this world seems to be just like Coraline's own, only more interesting, but she soon begins to suspect that something evil is waiting for her there.<br />Coraline is a terrifying yet charming children's book that can be equally enjoyed by adults. Some parents may think this book is too scary for children but this is the kind of book kids really love. Not only is the book's plot highly entertaining but there is a great moral to the story as well. I've read a couple of Neil Gaiman's other books but Coraline is my favorite of them all. Gaiman's style works well with the children's book format and Dave McKean's illustrations match the tone of the book perfectly. I think this one will stay fresh in my memory for a long time.
B000084T18|5.0|If you like 2 Pac, Dr. Dre, DMX, or Eminem, then you would probably like this CD. I got this CD the exact day it came out, and I wasn't disappointed. At first, I sampled every song, but didn't listen to all of them straight through, but I liked about all the songs. With me, when I get a new CD, I take my time listening to it, and after awhile, I start liking the songs more, cause I listened to them. I like every song on the CD. I actually like this CD better than Dr. Dre's Chronic 2001, and I do like that CD. Most rap CD's have like 5 skits or whatever, but this CD just has a short intro, so there's a total of 18 songs, including 3 bonus songs, and with at least some of the CD's, a DVD with uncensored footage, including an interview, concert performances, and the videos of \\"Heat\\" and \\"Wanksta\\", but Wanksta however, is edited. ...

B00005JM09|5.0|So i saw this movie, and despite low expectations and bad trailers the movie actually turned out to be a success, It didn'y come close to it's predecessor T2: Judegment Day but a fun and enjoyable ride with a bit of a story that a 5 year old could understand it made it one of this years better movies. Arnold comes back as his most famous role as the T-101 except hes more changed he makes everything jst more funny. The acting is good, not great. So instead of all the mellow-drama from the second Director Johnathan Mostow turns this movie into a fun enjoyable ride worth seeing and having a great time at the movies. If your a fan of the first two movies i reccomend seeing it it's for those people who enjoy the great action and funny one-liners. People who don't enjoy sci-fi and want more of what they saw in t2 like the dramam and apocoliptic sense might not like it  and find it dumbed down but in my chocie i'd have to say see this one it's worth a fun ride.

B00008J4P5|4.0|The White Stripes show that the 70's weren't a rock n roll wasteland after all.<br />The influences are pretty apparent on the first listen: Led Zepellin, Queen, Black Sabbath, Iggy and the Stooges, Sweet, some Elton John, and other singer/songwriter types.<br />If you like these influences, you'll probably fall into 2 categories--you'll either think \\"Elephant\\" is \\"derivative\\" or \\"classic.\\"<br />For me, I think The White Stripes pull off a pretty good synthesis of the 70's without being a ripoff.  Admittedly some of the tracks may be too close to the originals; for example, 'Ball and Biscuit' made me cringe (or was it \\"guilty pleasure\\" I might have been feeling?) and think of Kingdom Come (remember them?).  This song typifies what Tom Petty once called \\"irresponsible behavior.\\"<br />But \\"Seven Nation Army\\", \\"Little Acorns\\", \\"It's true that we love one another\\", \\"Black Math\\" and \\"There's no Home for you anywhere\\" are great tunes.  And the whole album works together pretty well.<br />All in all, it's apparent that Jack and Meg White are very talented.  If you want to hear what happens when a less-talented band tries to do a 70's synthesis, pick up a copy of Redd Kross' \\"Neurotica.\\"<br />A good litmus test for people wondering if they should buy this?  If you thought Beck's \\"Midnite Vultures\\" was derivative of Prince, you'll hate \\"Elephant.\\"  If, like me, you thought \\"Midnite Vultures\\" was a classic, you'll probably enjoy \\"Elephant.\\"
B0000A2ZO1|5.0|What did Nemesis have that made it a winner? There were several things- 1.  Real Danger. In most other Star Trek movies you know nobody's really going to be harmed. In this one we had the death of a crewmember as well as a smashed up enterprise. 2. Suspense. Data jumping from the enterprise and landing on the scimitar? WOW! And 3. Character Moments. Let's see, a long-awaited wedding, good humor, and a touching scene reminescing over Data. All in all, a GREAT film!

B0000AI44Q|5.0|There's nothing quite like Greendale.  If I think of spiritually comparable records, the ones that come to mind are John Lennon's &quot;Plastic Ono Band,&quot; or perhaps Lou Reed records like &quot;Coney Island Baby,&quot; &quot;New York&quot; or &quot;Berlin,&quot; or perhaps Daevid Allen's recent masterpiece &quot;Dreaming a Dream.&quot; This is a mature, intensely personal work that utterly transports you into its world and, in its total effect, is the most moving and powerful record Neil has made since &quot;Tonight's the Night.&quot; This isn't a &quot;genre&quot; record, as some might regard the last album, &quot;Are You Passionate&quot;; this is just Neil and Crazy Horse (well, most of Crazy Horse; Poncho is not present) playing basic, skeletal rock and roll.  Not only does the lineup of instruments not change much from cut to cut, but the sound of the instruments doesn't vary much either (it's drums, bass and Neil's guitar; without a second guitar, Neil alternates between playing rhythm and leads/riffs). There are sparing doses of Neil's harmonica, sometimes strangely ghostly and buried in the mix. Only on two cuts does the basic sound vary (&quot;Bringing Down Dinner,&quot; with the haunting pump organ Neil plays from time to time, and the gorgeous &quot;Bandit,&quot; played on acoustic guitar).<br />There's a narrative string to this CD, describing scenes from the life of several generations of the Green family of Greendale, somewhere in (Northern) California.  Each member of the family has his or her own story to tell; Grandma, reflecting on a lifetime with her husband; Grandpa, sickened by the world he sees around him but still believing in &quot;love and affection&quot;; Sun Green, the young granddaughter who matures from rabblerouser to social activist; Jed, the cousin who gets into trouble with the law; Earl, Sun's dad, who finally finds a buyer for his &quot;psychedelic paintings&quot;... (although the narration Neil gave at the concerts is not included, it is reprinted in the CD booklet and is on the companion included DVD, which is a fabulous acoustic version of the album recorded in Ireland).<br />Musically almost primitive, technically simple and direct (it appears that everything was recorded live in the studio), lyrically almost reportage rather than poetry, the songs have a cumulative effect that is nothing short of devastating. The subtle power that Neil wields on &quot;Greendale&quot; is the mark of a truly mature artist who knows that grand gestures and impossible and that uncertainty, doubt, loss and hope can powerfully describe the human condition.<br />This is a very special recording.
B0000A0DRY|5.0|Make no mistake: Jefferson Airplane was a group effort. Grace had the hits, Paul had the sci-fi/political vision, and Jorma had the superb blues-based guitar licks. But founder Marty Balin had the oh-so-sweet love songs, and given great material, created timeless, transcendent classics. His two solo vocal efforts here, &quot;Today,&quot; and &quot;Comin' Back to Me,&quot; are two of the most achingly beautiful songs of the psychedelic era. His vocals help lift other songs such as &quot;She Has Funny Cars&quot; and &quot;3/5 of a Mile in 10 Seconds&quot; into the stratosphere. However, as stated previously, the Airplane was a group effort and Marty was never as good on his solo releases or even on his later (excellent) material for Jefferson Starship. Both Grace and Paul provide outstanding support, and Grace, of course, has two excellent songs of her own, &quot;Somebody to Love&quot; and &quot;White Rabbit,&quot; that she brought from her previous group, the Great Society. Although Grace and Paul asserted themselves more in later years and the Airplane released several first-rate albums after this one (most of which carried a more pronounced political bent), Surrealistic Pillow was probably their best all-around effort. So, if you just know this band from their later Jefferson Starship/Starship work, then you will want to start your Airplane collection with this masterpiece of psychedelic hope and idealism.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is an incredible piece of work from start to finish. It is in fact their best piece of work out of their 6 albums to date. This includes such incredible songs like &quot;Paranoid Android&quot;, which in itself is a masterpiece, especially the video. We also have &quot;Karma Police&quot; which has such an eerie ending; &quot;No Surprises&quot; which is haunting with its keyboards and &quot;Airbag&quot; which kicks this masterpiece into a pleasure cruise. This album shows that the band are great songwriters and also shows they've come a long way since &quot;Creep&quot;. I really wish that I liked their other albums as much as this one......and who the heck would even try to compare these guys to Duran Duran? Duran Duran is in fact a great band but they are so different from Radiohead that you can't compare the two bands whatsoever. Please pick this one up because it's a true gem to add to your collection.
B000002UJQ|5.0|One of the best albums made in recent hisory. You don't will be disapointed. You will hear a lot of melodies and sounds you've heard once on TV but didn't know who wrote the music, so this album will answer a lot of answers! Buy it, listen to it, dream about it and never give it away!
0684803356|5.0|Hemingway spans quite range.  If you have just finished reading The Great Gatsby and are interested in the jaded, bored-with-life, spoiled and rich who drink and drink, read The Sun Also Rises.  If you've just finished Dr. Blade #57, you like senseless action, and just want to say you've read Hemingway, try To Have and Have Not.  But if, like me, you come from a background of JRR Tolkien, RL Stevenson, HG Wells and Jack London, and perhaps you have already read a few Nick Adams tales or The Old Man and the Sea, then don't be daunted by this story's length - this is your book.  <BR>While it's true this book slowed down a few times, that rang true.  It mirrored the reality of my military experience.  Then again, there are some chapters of this book burn into the memory: how the Communists first dealt with people after taking their hometown, the stand they took on the hilltop, the final scene, and others.  There characters were clear, the action realistic, the inaction tense.  Read it.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Not being a big fan of pop artists in general, I was nevertheless blown away by this CD. \\"Stripped\\" is just that. Take away all the fancy gimicks that some artists have and you christina's ability to just kill a song. Her vocal range and technical skills are superb. My favorite songs are all of them. I can't say anything bad about this cd. I can listen to it anytime. Anyone who is a fan of vocal artists should like whitney houston and mariah carey should listen to this one. This girl is going places.
B0000AGWJ7|4.0|I just got back from my local CD store, with my long awaited copy of Waking the Fallen. I drove home as fast as I could so I could listened to what I thought would be the greatest metalcore album ever... yes even betten than the opposite of december.  Anyway, after listening to the CD, I was left wanting more, and popped in my old A7X CD to get my fix. The CD itself is incredible, don't get me wrong, the musicianship is out of the world and the songs are epic and timeless and just plain splendid, but it sounds alomst overly thought out and produced, and the band itself has lost it &quot;pure&quot; feel. This is an amazing album none the less, but it sounds more like Iron Maiden and early Metalica than A7X's peers; Atreyu and Poison the Well. Also, the new version of Second Heartbeat is too slow and had lost a lot. it is still a good song, but the new version is weak.  Thanks for reading my review.
0399143904|4.0|I didn't realize for years that Mr. Clancy had written other books in the Ryan universe besides _The Hunt for Red October,_ and I kicked myself when I found out what I had been missing: lots of big fat good books with equal portions brain and heart.  This one took some getting into, though, because I am a granola treehugging eagles-belong-downtown envirofeminist myself.  (Belong downtown?  In my little Alaskan town, they crap on the cars.  Everybody in the U.S. should have the privilege of wiping bald eagle crap off of their own automobile.)  But on rereading, I got a chill down my spine.  <br />Any deeply held belief system can be coopted by the taint in the human soul and turned into a Cause, as in Anything For The.  Clancy's genius shows in the way he created a believable charismatic human monster in the historic tradition, but gave him a Cause for the 21st century.  It made me reexamine my dismissal of the wackaloons of the environmental movement.  All they need is a demagogue.<br />The lesser monsters who cluster around John Brightling have their finely drawn individual freakishness as well.  They remind me of Hitler's supporting cast, and I suspect that that was the author's model.  You have the man who scarcely blinks at human death but flinches at the deaths of small animals; the self-indulgent brute who murders rather than restrain his appetite; the enthusiastic planners who are so in love with the big picture that they find it easy to ignore its horrible scaffolding; the dreamers who really believe that their personal obsessions justify the bloody overthrow of civilization.  I entertained myself on a hot afternoon by imagining life in the Kansas facility in a plotline where the Project succeeded.  Then I shuddered and went out into the sunlight.<br />The musings of various Project members are some of Clancy's finest bits of irony to date.  I liked the media room for the use of the grandchildren of the Anointed--as if fresh videotapes would spring up next to the strawberries.  And the idea that the most important thing to consider, when trying to feed several thousand people on local resources, would be recipes.  And the ark built by radical environmentalists that requires petroleum to keep out the deadly Kansas winter.  And so on.<br />But Clancy is scrupulously fair.  There is the brown smudge.  There was the Exxon Valdez disaster.  (The way a denizen of the Wonderland Beyond the Beltway drastically underestimates its scale and severity even while using it as an excuse for murder is another fine bit of irony.)  There is the inescapable legacy of nuclear waste.  There is the way mine tailings put arsenic in drinking water.  It is human nature to use hard facts in the service of convenient lies.  Clancy uses them instead to tell a whacking good story that leaves you thinking about the contradictions of humanity.  He does this a lot.  Go buy.  Go read.
B00005YW4H|4.0|Her voice is lovely, and I love the overall feel of this album.  It reminds me of a smoky jazz club in the 1920s, with the beautiful starlette up on stage in a spotlight.  &quot;I've Got To See You Again&quot; is my favourite song on this album, with &quot;Nightingale&quot; and &quot;Feelin' the Same Way&quot; close behind.  Some of the songs run together, and have no real identity of their own, but this is an enjoyable album.
B00008H2LB|4.0|Great sophmore album by the guys, &quot;Faint&quot; is the track that stands out the most to me, basically this album shows that if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Hybrid Theory is easily the better album but I'm sure old fans and new fans alike will be pleased with this album.
B00009XITP|4.0|Moms, this is one teenie flick you may want to sit through with your daughters. Yes, the story is silly, contrived and deserving of every critical barb it's received. But you will get to enjoy the luscious Colin Firth in various attire, including a scene in which he dons a t-shirt and black leather pants and plays an air guitar. You will want to watch that one over, and over, and over ... so go ahead, buy the DVD. If you order it from amazon, it will arrive discretely in the mail and your grown-up friends need never know.
0446310786|5.0|This book was a reading assignment in my L.A.-S.S. class. ( That Meens Language Arts / Social Studies ) At first I din't even want to read it, now, I am recomending it to my friends. It truly is a classic.<br />I enjoyed the book, and the movie.<br />Truly great.<br />A must read for anyone interested in reading great liturature. ( Now I need to wrighte a review on a spelling book, because mine is bad, anyway, back to the review....)<br />Anyway, great book.
079284632X|3.0|I am a huge fan of Wes Craven and I really enjoy horror movies but this one was really disturbing.  The movie is about two teenage girls, Mari and Phyllis who decide to go to a concert in the &quot;big city&quot; to celebrate Mari's 17 birthday. When they stop in the city for some pot, they are held captive and against their will by four criminals: Krug, Junior, Weasel and Sadie.  When the two girls meet this sadistic group, torture and murder begin. They force Mari and Phyllis to do some of the most disgusting and sickening things ever seen on film. Eventually, the two are both killed and left in the woods. Krug and company face car problems so they pose as salemen and approach a house. Unfortunately for the group of killers, Mari just happens to be the daughter of the residents.  When they find out what happened to their daughter, the line between villian and victim becomes blurred.
6301797906|2.0|Steinbeck's novel is a must read for anyone interested in American history, especially that of the 20th Century.  The book is well crafted with fully developed characters and a strong story line.  The movie skips important developmental information, assumes unreasonable knowledge on behalf of the viewer, and distorts the story line.  If you have read the book you will be very disappointed in the movie.  If you have not read the book you will be confused by leaps in logic throughout the movie.
B00008IAMD|5.0|I've always respected Johnny Cash's work but I can't say I've been a fan.  Still can't say I really am.  But, I will say that the &quot;hurt&quot; cover is astounding and the video is the best music video ever made.  Period.
0440539811|1.0|Some inventive concepts, trapped in the 70's, did NOT age well.  I slogged through it, felt like I was not rewarded in the end.  A lot of the reviews I have read say things like, &quot;if you don't like this book, you are not well read [or smart].&quot;  I think those things are said to justify liking what is essentially a mess of a book.
0425152251|2.0|I had to read this book in the summer for AP European History and was at first excited to learn about philosophy using a semi-fictional book. I was wrong. This book is simply an excuse to write a short textbook on the history of philosophy with only hints of an alterior plot thrown in. It took me weeks to get through this one and I was put into the terrible state of wanting to blow the book to pieces each time I started reading. If you are in fact interested in philosophy and simply want to have a concise history of the subject then this book is an excellent source, but I would clearly not recommend it to those of the weak hearted who simply want a good read.
B000002J1S|5.0|This is definitely one of the greatest albums recorded in its era. Genesis had their off-kilter time signatures and Peter Gabriel's more-than-somewhat-bizarre lyrical vision down pat - and this is their masterwork. Too complicated to try to explain the whole story, which is basically a picaresque adventure featuring a character called Rael ('Imperial Aerosol Kid') stumbling from one encounter to another in search of his lost brother John. Quirky gems like Eno's synth solo on the pop number &quot;Counting Out Time&quot; mix with more extended instrumental and experimental tracks. Classic singalong rockers like &quot;Lilywhite Lilith&quot; mingle with weirdly memorable songs like &quot;In the Colony of Slippermen&quot;. The stage show must have been awesome. Some of the synth lines sound outdated now, but the band as a whole kicks on this record. A must-have for every record collection...Back in the eighties this inspired my then-current rock band to write their own 'rock opera' show called 'The Lift'; of course, that production came nowhere near matching the brilliance of Genesis at its height. I could rave for hours about the different songs on LAMB, including the classic &quot;Carpet Crawlers&quot;, and the way Gabriel sings certain lines (eg. &quot;Welcome Rael, we are the lamia of the pool!!!)- suffice to say this album is a MUST!!
B00005JKZV|5.0|Fantastic! Loved every bit of it! The movie was a bit different from the first one, the story continued with Frodo and the ring, yet the creatures rose up and the war began. It was amazing to watch the fighing between the forces of darkness and the man kind. The only thing I got left to say is that I just CANNOT wait to own it on DVD and see The Return of the King!!
B00009APK1|5.0|I can't believe all the noise about added and deleted scenes. Come on it is a movie! The only way to make it 100% true to the book is to make it into TV-series! BTW some of the new scenes came from the \\"Unfinished Tales\\" by Tolkien. Do your self  a favor and read his other works. <BR>Elves at Helm's Deep... At the same time as humans were fighting in the south-east of the Middle Earth, dwarves were battling orks at the Lonely Mountain, Grey and Noldor elves were fighting at Lothlorien and Greenwood the Great. Instead of jumping back and forth over and over again, why not bring elves to Hornburg. \\"This perils belongs to all\\" (Elrond, FOTR)<br />Many of the questions were answered in my ... Magazine.<br />I will buy theater AND the Collector's versions. I figure I will have to rent it at least 5-6 times before November 18th, so why not save money and buy it?<br />[  ]
B000000I0H|5.0|while on his first three albums (&quot;ommadawn&quot;,&quot;hergest ridge&quot;,&quot;Tubular bells&quot;) Mike was practising his folk-rock-progressive style, here he creates a real Rock symphony.<BR>77 minutes (&quot;ommadawn&quot; was lasting 36 minutes...) of a huge and bombastic rock-opera based on a poems of Ben Johnson and Longfellow (english 18 century poets) and his own experiences (in the time Mike had gone though Exegis therapy because of his psychical problems).<BR>Whole album sounds much different than anything he had made through the next years of his career.Guitar that was so charactereistic in his earlier records is hidden here on second plan.Massive choir,orchestral arrangments,synths and opera sounds are dominating in &quot;part 1&quot; and &quot;part 2&quot;.they all give album a bit Film music or classical music taste.<BR>During last 8 minutes of &quot;part 2&quot; Maddie Pryor (from Steelaye span band) is singing the &quot;Hawaiatha&quot; poem with the background of Jabula african drums band and etheric vibraphone part (Pierre morlen from Gong,he will collaborate with Mike in the later years too).This part is hypnotising listeners because of monotoic Vocal intonations and very spiritual atmosphere...<BR>but i save all the honours for &quot;part 3&quot; and &quot;part 4&quot; which are in my opinion one of Mike's finest instrumental works in in his whole Career.<BR>&quot;Part 3&quot; starts with a cheerfull Fanfare medieval motive...but suddenly starts the maginficent long Guitar solo section...African tribal Drums are again on background along with gentle Bass riff and synths...the raw and moving Gitar solo is one of hte moments that can brought tears into your eyes because of a imposible beauty that lies underneath it.later staright to the end &quot;part 3&quot; goes into the nice seventies rocker with nice drums and guitars...<BR>&quot;part 4&quot; is much more experimental - etheric and mysterious Vibraphone part dominates here...i have to mention also the another tribal drums section with a rhythmical Bass guitar riff and charming Guitar solo...the ending is a All time Oldfield Classic - Maddie Pryor singing &quot;ode to diana&quot; along with a bit christmas-like melody.guitar solo is wonderfull.....<BR>This is definitly a magical album...takes you to a different world of ancient tribes and distant planets...it is one of the most impressive and timeless instrumental albums ever...77 minutes of pure pleasure.definitive must have for all rock fans!
B00008PX8P|5.0|I just bought this last night.  Incredible is all I can say.  I forgot how good they where.  Mix is awesome - DTS sounds great.
B000006NPY|5.0|i absolutely worship this album.  i have around 300 albums, and this is without a doubt, by far, absolutely my FAVORITE ALBUM EVER.  everything about this album is perfectly beautiful and amazing.  every song is so awesome (and there's FIFTEEN of em), that i can't even say what the best tracks are, because they all are.<br />nothing touches me emotionally like this album does.  i don't even know how corgan made this masterpiece.  i don't know what powers of the universe came together to form this album.  especially after the classic mellon collie album.  i don't think anybody ever expected corgan to be able to top that album.  when you make an album as awesome as mellon collie, you're supposed to be at the top of your career.  from there on, it *has* to be downhill.  but corgan somehow brought the music to an even higher level, a level higher than _any_ music has ever been before.<br />nope, there has never been any music created before this album that is as good as the songs on this album.  of course, maybe there has and i haven't heard it, but i've heard all of the popular oldies; i've heard all of popular classic rock and pop music; and i've heard hundreds of albums from the 90's; and i've never heard any music that is as mellow, beautiful, perfect, and emotionally powerful as this music.<br />i didn't even like this album at first.  in fact, i didn't even like the pumpkins.  i always hated corgan's voice.  i heard this album for two years (my sister had it, and played it a lot), and one day when i heard it, i was totally amazed.  it just hit me one day.  and from there, i listened to the other pumpkins albums, and the next thing i knew, they were my favorite band ever.<br />and now, i don't care how much music a person has heard in their life.  i say, you haven't heard music, if you haven't heard this album.
0887309372|5.0|The 22 Immutable Laws of Branding is, without a doubt, the very best book on branding out there.

They can be learned and implemented by anyone.  22 Immutable Laws lays the foundation and, then, as they say, it's up to you.  After all Coke (like Rome) wasn't built in a day.<br />This book, though, gives the foundation and will help you to avoid many of the pitfalls in the branding game.  Go for it.  22 Immutable Laws of Branding will be a mainstay on your office shelf to be referred to day in and day out.
B00005JM09|5.0|What can I say, the movie was fantastic. He said he'd be back and he was. I loved the fact that it continued to story from Terminator 2 and I loved that they brought everything up a level. The movie kept me going throughout a whole time, the fights were incredible and strong. Lots of action and noise especially by the end!
B000063DGC|5.0|First off... I'd like to say that Randy Rhodes is the best guitar player ever. Unfortunatley, he is not with us anymore.<br />Now, on to rating the songs. All the songs are average to great.<br />1. I Don't Know- Well, I Don't Know why I love this song. Is it Randy's guitar playing? Ozzy's voice? Or just... the song. Hmm... maybe i'll never know. 5/5<br />2. Crazy Train- Ozzy's best song ever. The song is about mental illness, although lyrics aside, it seems to be about great guitar playing by Randy. 5/5<br />3. Believer- A great song from Blizzard of Ozz. 4/5<br />4. Mr. Crowley- Can someone tell me why i love this song? I really have no clue why. It's a dark, creepy song, listen to it more than once. 4.5/5<br />5. Flying High Again- Kind of sort of good... at the beginning of the song Ozzy says \\"we're gonna do another number now, entitled Flying High so keep on smokin' them joints!\\" From Diary of a Madman. 3.5/5<br />6. Revelation(Mother Earth)- slower song, but good anyway. 4/5<br />7. Steal Away(The Night)- a good song... the beginning is great, but the chorus is only GOOD. 4/5<br />8. Suicide Solution- I love this song... about alcoholism and suicide... an amazing song. And @#$! that mother who said her son commited suicide because of this song! 5/5<br />9. Iron Man-Would I be a real Sabbath fan if i said this version was better? Maybe not better... maybe equal. 4/5<br />10. Children of the Grave- I like this version. I really do... yeah... this is talent. 4/5<br />11. Paranoid- I like... Iommi's original, even though Randy's a better guitar player in general... i choose the original Sabbath version over this one. 4/5<br />12. Goodbye to Romance- Anyone who says hard rock/metal bands and singers can't do slow songs is an idiot. This song is just great. 5/5<br />13. No Bone Movies- The weakest track. It's about porn addiction. 3.5/5<br />14. Dee(Studio Out-takes)- I don't know what to say about this track... other than... sad? A little bit? No? 5/5?<br />There you have it, folks, put down your nu-metal and get this album.<br />-MasterOfMetal
6304286961|4.0|I think this film is far better than film critic Roger Ebert,who gives it 2 1/2 stars, believes. It is presented as a realistic representation of the 1960's, of the psychedic era.  I think it is as good as \\"Woodstock\\" in this respect. The scenes have such seamless transitions that one is totally drawn into the cinematic reality. I lived through this period and though some reviewers claim it has been exaggerated for dramatic effect, I find no reason to believe that all of what is presented could not be true, including Morrison's daredevil acts outside on an apartment ledge, his meeting with Andy Warhol, etc. There are at least two ways to view Morrison: as a misunderstood, passionate poetic genius who espoused greater personal freedom; or as a degenerate lout and beat poet who wallowed in  excess until it finally killed him, in that time of instant personal gratification. Meg Ryan is also good as his girlfriend, though he apparently attracted many women. He certainly was an  above-average melodist and a somewhat jaded lyricist(particularly on the song \\"The End\\" in which \\"the killer\\" reminds me of the main character in the film \\"Kalifornia\\" as played by Brad Pitt; I suppose Jim's statement that \\"The West is the Best\\" can be equated with Jimi Hendrix playing the Star Spangled Banner at Woodstock) many of his best songs compare favorably to the best of the Beatles or Stones or Janis Joplin or the Flying Burrito Brothers, and it's no wonder he has become a pop culture icon.
0441009425|3.0|I am conflicted by this book.  On the one hand, Reynolds brilliantly imagines far-future human societies (like the genetically modified space-faring Ultras), giant, intelligent spaceships (like the miles-long Nostalgia For Infinity, partially taken over by a virus that feeds on computers), ancient alien races, and all the necessary technology to make these believable.  In the hands of a better writer, the components - the content - of this book would be downright incredible.    However, Reynolds is not a good writer. His characters exist merely to move the story forward. I don't think any of the main three could seriously be called \\"heroes\\".  It doesn't matter to me that they're all working against each other at certain times, but none of them ever seems real enough.  Sylveste is a slightly egomaniacal scientist obsessed with uncovering the mystery of the disappearance of a race of aliens thousands of years ago. Ana Khouri is a mercenary hired by a mysterious stranger to kill Sylveste. Volyova is the commander (sort of) of a giant starship (mentioned above) that is also searching for Sylveste, because she needs his help. Beyond that, they are interchangeable.  Only their motivations differ - they speak in the exact same voice, and their actions are hardly distinctive. You wouldn't recognize these characters if you happened to meet them anywhere else; they're just plot devices, and that is incredibly irritating.    The book takes about 200 pages too much in getting its plot worked out. It's very long, and I'm not sure how much of that length is really essential to the whole. Reynolds spends a lot of time with flashbacks - not important ones, just brief ones to tell you what a character was doing ten minutes before he/she was doing something else. Utterly superfluous. Another problem is his consistent use of passive sentences - even when there was intense action going on, it didn't feel intense. Instead of writing \\"Khouri walked down the hall\\", Reynolds writes \\"KhouriWAS walking down the hall.\\" The overuse of the passive voice robs the story of immediacy and action.    Overall, I enjoyed this book, though on an entirely conceptual level. It was a painful chore to read (you have to make it to the last few pages before he explains the specifics of his plot), and I don't think I'll bother with the sequels.
0140042393|4.0|\\"I figgered the devil was the enemy. But they's somepin worse'n the devil got hold a country, an it ain't gonna let go till it's chopped loose.\\"<br />Grapes Of Wrath is the story of the desperate battle of migrant labourers with the rich, greedy, malevolent and the mean. When the Joads arrive in California from their native Oklahoma, their troubles and tribulations are rewarded not by bounty, but by even more hardship. What ensues is a timeless battle. It is waged by the spirit of the downtrodden on the one side, and by the mercenary mean muscle of the other. The story is primordial and resonates with any reader with a sense for perception.<br />The classic work of fiction describes a world where the rich, with their glitzy cars, ride alone and never mind hitting a man or a noble dog should one come in their way. Then there is the poor and oppressed who, despite their condition, extend a hand time and time again and never forget what is important on the great round dustbowl. The wheel in the sky seems to work against those who toil and possess a heart, but cruelty and oppression are exposed as mere facades that once removed reveal nothing more than a faceless corporate entity bereft of the right to exist.<br />It is in this setting that John Steinbeck writes in amazingly authentic and sanguine dialogue the flight of the strong-at-heart from, and again into, the belly of a system bent on browbeating compassion, kindness and veracity.
B0000959N0|4.0|Teenager Matt Murdock is blinded in a freak accident.  After the accident, Matt loses his sight, but his other senses become super-humanly enhanced.  His father, played perfectly by David Keith, is an over-the-hill prize fighter with ties to the local mob.  With his career back on track, Matt's father is ordered by the local crime boss to take a dive, but he refuses and goes on to win his fight - much to the crime boss's chagrin.<br />Matt pushes himself physically and mentally in honor of his father, and becomes a top attorney during the day, while taking advantage of his heightened senses to become the mysterious vigilante Daredevil during the darkness of night.  Everything seems pretty normal (if you call leading THAT kind of double life normal!) until...<br />Matt meets and falls in love with Elektra Natchios (unconvincingly played by Jennifer Garner - although she sure looked tasty!), the daughter of a billionaire businessman.  Elektra's father is murdered, which leads Matt and Elektra down a collision course with the city's Kingpin of Crime (Michael Clarke Duncan - man, was he convincing!) and his hired hitman, Bullseye (Colin Farell).<br />Once Matt meets Elektra, things move very quickly.  Unfortunately, the film-makers had to develop the relationship between Matt and Elektra quickly, too.  Unlike another dark \\"super hero\\" movie, The Crow, in which the writers and directors made the love Eric Draven had for his fiancee almost palatable, one never truly gains an understanding for how deeply Matt and Elektra are in love.  The chemistry between Affleck and Garner just really isn't there, and the fact that the two of them are mediocre performers certainly didn't help matters much.  This is too bad, because this story is about the love between Elektra and Matt as well as Daredevil vs. Bullseye and the Kingpin.<br />The movie's soundtrack rocks, and I was pleased to find that the DVD came with DTS sound in addition to the Dolby 5.1.  Jon Favreau was a good Foggy Nelson, Joe Pantoliano was fine as Ben Urich, and Colin Farell made an interesting, albeit somewhat different from the comic book, Bullseye.  Affleck did an OK job as Daredevil, and Garner, as mentioned previously, really is not a very talented performer. I'll give Affleck credit for not messing up Matt Murdock or Daredevil.  I think the fact that he is a huge Daredevil fan helped out tremendously.  His performance had a little more juice and depth than some of his previous stuff - like the over-rated Pearl Harbor fluff.<br />The best performance, hands down, was Michael Clarke Duncan as the Kingpin.  Yes, yes...  I know that the comic book Kingpin was a literally larger than life white guy - a muscular version of Toughman Competition fighter Eric \\"Butterbean\\" Esch.  But when you finish watching the movie, challenge yourself to find an actor who could have done a better job than Mr. Duncan.  I tried to think of others that could have done the job, but I kept coming up empty.  The people doing the casting nailed this one perfectly.<br />Marvel Comics has scored big with X-Men, Spider-man, X-Men 2, and Daredevil.  Of the three that I have seen (I've missed X-Men 2), Daredevil fits in between Spider-man (that movie was GRRREAT!) and X-Men (Cool, but again, not enough time to develop characters).

B00004U2G1|1.0|This was one of the best albums of the 70's, and I really looked forward to a high-res multichannel version, but if I put the CD on at the same time and switch back and forth between the two, it sounds like an exact copy of the CD, except it won't play in a CD player. In contrast, the SACD version of 'Dark side of the Moon' is so clean, and the conversion to 5.1 is so well done that it's hard to believe it was recorded in 1972. Also, that SACD will play in a CD player.
B00005JLXE|5.0|Admittedly not as good as X2, but could you really expect that from a film that is based on one character alone?  It does an excellent job of taking the Frank Miller storyline and streamlining it with a modern twist to give it flair.  Jennifer Garner, Michael Clarke Dunkan, and Colin Ferrel all shine as their characters, which sort of makes me wish the movie was about Elektra instead of the somewhat miscast Ben Affleck.  Of course, it did take Ben's interest to get the ball rolling on the movie, so one should be mindful of that favor. <BR>The rock music track, slammed by so many, is actually poetic and upon reviewing or after acquiring a deeper knowledge of the DD universe is an amazingly well-done substitute for the back stories which would be expensive and probably boring to the average viewer.  The special features are also great.  I hope to see more discs like this!
B00002E233|2.0|I'm being quite honest when I say I truly wanted to like Deep Blue Sea. I went into the film with some fairly high expectations of pure summer action/suspense entertainment because of the mostly positive response it was getting from critics. Plus, it's been a long time since we've had a fun shark movie so I was ready to embrace this with open arms.<br />Alas, it was not to happen, and I should have known. After all, even though Renny Harlin can prove himself skillful in directing action sequences, he fails to inject genuine suspense and often goes too far over-the-top in a movie that mostly takes itself seriously. This is not Lake Placid (which is quite a good thing). Deep Blue Sea isn't terrible by a long shot, but it's not the breakneck paced thriller I was hoping for.<br />Dr. Susan McAlester (Saffron Burrows) is in the process of creating a cure for Alzheimer's Disease. With the help of a crew working in an underwater habitat, they use the brain material of sharks to get this job accomplished. However, the side effect was that the sharks (3 of them) grew smarter as a result of the experimentation, and they break loose, creating hell as they begin to prey on the group of survivors, who are trying to find a way to get topside.<br />Deep Blue Sea is a movie that should have been dripping with suspense and action from every corner. Instead, what we get is the occasional &quot;jump-in-your-seat&quot; shark attack that only offers momentary jolts. Oh, don't get me wrong, there are some exciting moments, but not enough to cover the entire running time of 105 or so minutes.<br />This is director Renny Harlin we're talking about, who's made almost nothing but big-budget duds (Cutthroat Island, Cliffhanger, Die Hard 2). Considering the fact that Deep Blue Sea may very well be his best movie only goes to show he isn't that accomplished a director. He's all about the action, and there are moments in Deep Blue Sea when it works. L.L. Cool J.'s encounters with the sharks areoften tense and surprisingly humorous, and there is a flooding scene with the characters trying to escape the sharks by climbing a ladder that remains a fairly memorable setpiece<br />However, there are plenty of moments that don't work, either. One of the &quot;main characters&quot; sudden departure feels quite obvious in the middle of his &quot;we will survive if we stay together&quot; speech, and the end result is not only bloody, but also quite cheesy. The over-the-top finale is probably the worst, and the less description about it, the better.<br />The special effects are sometimes effective, just like the action scenes (as I think of it now, a lot of things are sometimes effective and sometimes not). The animatronic sharks are convincing and realistic, but CGI is far worse-looking than what you may have thought was dated in Jaws. The sets are appropriately well-fashioned, and the constant scenes of flooding do give the film a little added tension.<br />The performances are also a mixed bag. Samuel L. Jackson as the man funding the whole operation is very good (as always) and it's a pity he isn't in this film more. As I think of it, as soon as his presence is gone, that's when the film's true downslide began. Saffron Burrows is also good as the scientist and heroine of the picture, but a stupid move on the filmmakers' part in the finale ruins any of her development (which isn't a whole lot to begin with, but is significantly more than anyone else). Also decent are Stellen Skarsgard and Jacqueline Mckenzie. LL Cool J is fun to watch when he's making fun of his situation, but is a bit irritating when he's preaching (he plays a religious cook, is this a case of miscasting?).<br />The two performers that are not so good are Michael Rappaport and Thomas Jane. Rappaport often goes so far over-the-top in his role you have to wonder who he thinks he's chewing the scenery from. Now, as for Thomas Jane as the shark wrangler, did this guy graduate from the school of acting from Christopher Lambert? For that matter, the two of them look so alike I was wondering if they were related. But back to his performance; Jane is so wooden it's almost laughable. There's even a moment when he pops out of the water and starts screaming in such an unconvincing manner, I found myself chuckling. Jane is perhaps the worst thing about this film and he actually gets the second-most amount of screentime!<br />The script is dumb, no doubt about it, with some cringe-inducing dialogue and laughably bad science. But, to give all involved in the film credit, everybody seems to know that and doesn't take the story too seriously, which is actually a good balance. If it had reached the campy levels of Lake Placid, this would have been a disaster so points must be awarded to the fact that the tone does usually maintain the same, that is until the over-the-top finale.<br />There are also some other points in the film that hurt it. Trevor Rabin's score is a little overwrought and fails to bring about the needed excitement. There's also a scene that almost plays an ode to Alien, in which Burrows strips down to her underwear to electrocute a shark. Sure, Burrows is a very good-looking woman, but it's a gratuitous moment.<br />No one ever said Deep Blue Sea had to be masterful, but it's often too goofy, and thus prevents it from being the extremely entertaining action/thriller it could and should have been. What we do get is still quite watchable and does offer some entertainment, but a quick fix isn't satisfying enough.<BR>** 1/2 out of *****

0440539811|4.0|Bad writing, unbelievable characters, disjointed and disorganized plots that somehow come together to form a wonderful story.  The three volumes that comprise the Illuminatus Trilogy are like taking a no spending limit trip through the parinoid's candy store!<br />I read the Illuminatus when I was in my 20's and it frightened me because I thought might all be true.  I reread in my 30's and was depressed because I realized that it wasn't.  I've just read it again at 50 and now know that even though every word is fiction, every word is also true.<br />Our lives are subject to the whims of people for whom we are no more real or important than unbelievable characters in a bad novel -- but it's OK as long as we remember how to have a good  time while we're on their ride.<br />The Illuminatus Trilogy is a must read that belongs on everyone's desert island list.

B00009L7N1|5.0|If you're a Simply Red fan, this is a MUST HAVE for your collection.  If you're not...then this is a great album to start off with.<br />You know how there are some CD's that you can listen to all the way through, without skipping any tracks?  \\"Home\\" is one of those.  Mick Hucknall has never sounded better, and the rest of Simply Red follows suit.  \\"Sunrise\\" is definitely the \\"it\\" song on the album, but others, like \\"Fake\\", \\"Home\\" and \\"Money in My Pocket\\" are absolutely addictive.  You're bound to be in a good mood after a listen.<br />This music is the result of a lifetime of study, practice, persistence and passion...and it shows. Bravo!
B0000AXE8I|1.0|With all that this movie could have been this was all the Wachowski Brothers could give us? What a shame. An earlier review said that the Zion scenes were an excuse to extend the film, I must disagree; that is too simple. Rather every slow motion fight (in other words every fight) was the tool used to turn a 40-minute movie into 138 minutes of utter boredom (the Zion scenes were just a waste of time).      A massive fight scene with bullet-time at key moments is exhilarating (see the lobby battle in the Matrix). A quick fight ALL in slow motion is tedious. And that is what we get, over and over and over. Even the freeway fight, which should have been incredible, is reduced to a yawn by the overuse of one now tired special effect. Let's face it, bullet-time was the coolest effect any of us had seen since the first time we saw that Star Destroyer pass overhead on a theater screen in Star Wars, but it's not 1999 and we see it used everywhere now, even in commercials. We were told we'd be knocked out of our seats by Reloaded not put to sleep in them.      Of course, now that it's on DVD we'll be able to use fast forward. Believe me, this will be a blessing for watching this movie. The audience I sat with in the theater were all wishing they had it.
B000002MJC|5.0|Many people have different feelings upon this album, altough they consider it good, they feel that the group was falling apart, and somehow they were right, but this album is still a classic rock album, and with time it will become a cult album.<BR>Despite the fact that the change was maybe too radical, from techno-dance-softdark album (Violator) to a dark-album almost gothic like SOFAD, this one have everything to reach the status of a cult album, Great Lyrics, Great Music, Sadness, Love-Hate and Lust fellings, the question is... What else do you need in an album?<br />The highest songs are &quot;Judas&quot;, &quot;Walking in my Shoes&quot;, &quot;In Your Room&quot;, &quot;Higher Love&quot;, &quot;One Caress&quot; and &quot;I Feel You&quot;

6304913176|1.0|OK.<br />I finally saw this movie, and I have to say I was mostly disappointed.<br />First of all, if you don't like mindless violence in movies, don't see this film. If you don't like seeing characters who don't really deserve to get killed in brutal and terrible ways (but do), don't watch this movie.<br />Second of all, the plot of this movie was totally illustrative of a right-wing-dominated society, which can be good in some ways. In other ways, if there really is no lesson to be learned from the depiction of a totalitarian, warmongering future, where is the satisfaction?<br />This movie is supposedly an 'allegory' (if I'm using the word correctly) of the Japanese Pearl Harbor attack on the US in the 1940s, and also allegorical of the US WWII retaliatory campaigns that followed, where the allies claimed total victory.<br />However, since this movie depicted a totalitarian and militarized future (which to me should not necessarily be glorified), I expected this film to be more allegorical of the Gulf of Tonkin attack in southeast Asia which initiated the participation of the US in the Vietnam War, and which was supposedly faked in order to give the US a legitamate claim for entering the war (see also: Germany faking an attack by the Polish Army on one of its radio stations near the Polish border, 1938-1939).<br />Anyway, with the exaggerated violence and lack of real moral lesson other than 'kill kill kill,' this movie doesn't have a lot to offer except for cool military uniforms and good computerized effects.
B00009W0U4|1.0|Worst film I've seen in a long time...don't waste your money, this is just plain junk...bad camera angles and poor photography that trys to subsitute violence and sex for talent...the story unfolds in reverse...Who ever told this guy he could make movies, lied....

B00006SFLV|5.0|This show is real. Forget Dawson's Creek, no one talks like that. Forget anything else you've ever watched. This is what it's really like to be a teenager. If you've forgotten... it sucks. But you survived, didn't you? This series will remind you how. And maybe scare you a bit if you have kids of your own.<br />The acting and script-writing in this series is mind-blowing. If you've never seen it, you've missed out. Technical issues like poor sound quality, and the occasional episode with slightly ropey colour, would mar it a little were it not for the fact that these are the best five DVDs on the planet. I cannot recommend it highly enough.<br />What are you waiting for? Buy it now.
1400034779|5.0|Every so often, something comes along that is all new, that makes you fall in love with reading all over again.  This is one of those books.  With a literary grace filled with wit, wonderful characters and intelligence, Alexander McCall Smith introduces how Mma Precious Ramotswe, an independent contemporary woman of Botswana, came to set up her own business, the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, and the cases that came her way. <br />The plot is episodic, though a central mystery is built in slyly.  Smith experiments a bit with perspective but mostly sticks to Mma Ramotswe's point of view.  She is in her mid-thirties, a person of generous proportions who catches the eye of more than one man.  There is tragedy in her background, but for the most part she has succeeded in life and uses her intuition well.  She is honest, compassionate and ethical even as she cunningly lays a trap (her rationale for lying in such a situation is hilarious, coming as it does as she is brushing off a border guard).  <br />Most important, in Mma Ramotswe, who was born about the time the country became an independent state, Smith captures the tension that is contemporary Botswana, an African success story that enjoys stability and modern conveniences but is worried about losing tradition in a changing world.  Civilization largely clings to the southern and eastern edges of the country, and beyond that rim is a wide-open, ancient land that holds beauty but sometimes danger, too.  As an admirer concludes, Mma Ramotswe is all the best things of the old and the new Africa.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|If there was ever a testament against the bewildering concept of vertical marketing in entertainment, it has to be the simply superb Whedon series FireFly. 20th Century Fox is to be commended for developing and producing what has to be one of the best, if not the best, sci-fi series ever released to television. And I mean ever, with apologies to GR. Fox TV has to be chastised for trying to kill it right out of the gate. With Fox TV thankfully out of the loop, the 20th Century Fox DVD widescreen release of the FireFly series will certainly prove to be the gem in anyone's collection.
B00000IP3S|5.0|There is no doubt in my mind that Blind Guardian is a great band and this CD for me is the definitive BG album. It has everything - incredibly fast riffs, haunting acoustic passages, BG's trademark choruses, diverse songs and a lot of emotion. Most songs are faster than those of the subsequent NIME album which in my book is a good thing. Best songs would be Imaginations From the Other Side, Bright Eyes and Mordred's Song.
B00006F7XJ|5.0|Andy Latimer and Camel have really done it with this one!  This is one terrific album.  The music and mood on these tracks often starts simply, then progresses through an ever-intricate journey.  As one reviewer mentioned, there is a &quot;nod&quot; to the whimsical, Gabriel-era Genesis on Fox Hill -  which is a frolic through a fox hunt seen throught the eyes of several of the participants.  The song is highlighted by playful lyrics and fantastic instrumentals.  Simple Pleasures and A Boy's Life are dreamy looks at simpler times.  The best piece on the CD in my opinion is the closing number For Today.  This is an extremely moving and powerful retrospective look at a man trapped by circumstance on September 11, 2001, and how he decided upon his final destiny.<br />Camel is a fantastic band with a rich history.  They continue to write that history and this album is one of many high points.
B00005JKZV|5.0|Being an avid reader of mystery and western since age 8, I didn't read Tolkien at all.  When Lord of the Rings came out, I watched it, loved it, then went back and read all 3 of the books in the series.  So approaching from another angle (not a purist)I also could see diffences, but it made no difference.  This movie (no movie is perfect after all)is just mind boggling.  No bad language or lurid sex as is the calling card of so many movies now.  Lots of adventure, excitement, sense of responsibiltiy to others, great actors portraying their rolls..what else could one want in a movie.  What a wonderful job Peter Jackson has done to put such complex books into a series of movies that just makes you want to see the next one as quickly as possible.  I have seen the lst 2 several times and have purchased the 4 disc copy of LOTR's and will also of The two towers.  Just wonderful!
6305531374|3.0|Trying to forget that dreadful halloween night 20 years earlier, Laurie Strode has gone into the witness protection program as Keri Tate, along with her teenage son John (Josh Hartnett). As October 31 approaches, Keri tries to fight off her demon that keeps popping up in her head. While she tries to prepare and have a good time, Michael has found files leading him right to her, after chasing Marion (the nurse from the first and second film) through her house (The best scene in the film, in my opinion). So he heads cross country in a little green fruit truck to California, and the terror begins.<br />H20 is probably the most respectful sequel in the Halloween franchise. A few good chase scenes and jumps make this move worth watching. What I found the most surprising about this film was its lack of gore. There are very few kills, keeping the film more suspenseful. I wouldn't exactly call it a great film, but enjoyable and fun. A nice addition to the Halloween series.

0780631684|4.0|Final Destination manages to find its own little niche among psychological thrillers such as Scream and The Sixth Sense.  With X-Files veterans James Wong and Glen Morgan at the helm, the movie is all but guaranteed to be entertaining and gripping.  The plot works well as a whole, but some of the minutiae and details may make your brain hurt if you try to delve too deeply into them.  Some impressive special effects and exquisite timing squeeze as much fun as possible out of the twists, turns, and thrills collected here, and the actors play their roles quite convincingly.<br />Alex Chance Browning (Devon Sawa) obviously does not love to fly, but he shakes off several bad omens to board the plane taking a large group of his classmates to Paris.  Just before takeoff, he has a premonition of imminent disaster and ends up getting himself, five classmates, and a teacher, thrown off the plane.  While his fellow stranded travelers tell him off and ridicule his claim to have somehow seen the plane explode after takeoff, the plane does indeed explode just as Alex predicted.  These six other people seem more upset than grateful to Alex for having essentially saved their lives, and he finds himself a social outcast and even a person of interest to the FBI.  Things only get worse from here.  His circle of seven survivors begins to die off one by one, and Alex begins to see a pattern in these events.  He comes to believe that he somehow messed up Death's plan, and now Death is coming to claim the lives of the seven who were supposed to die in the plane crash.  He figured out that plan once already, and he is determined to figure out whatever new design Death throws at him.  If he and any of his friends are to survive, Alex must outsmart the Grim Reaper yet again, a tough task indeed.<br />There is not as much character development as I would have liked in Final Destination, but this does keep one from getting too attached to a character slated to die.  The relationship between Alex and Clear Rivers (Ali Larter) is especially ambiguous.  One character really stands out in the movie, despite his relatively short appearance: Tony Todd (of Candyman fame).  He plays a disturbingly dark, strange mortician whose ruminations about death really push the horror aspects of the movie to a higher level.  The death scenes are, for the most part, quite delightful.  One in particular occurs so suddenly and out of the blue that you have to just stop and give the moviemakers a little love.  A decapitation scene came off a little unrealistically, but all of the other special effects were quite impressive.  I have to say I really love the ending of the film; it is such a rare thrill to see a cold-blooded concluding moment rather than a sappy fairy tale ending.<br />Speaking of fairy tale endings, that is exactly what the first cut of this movie had, along with a romantic element that ultimately found itself on the cutting room floor.  Not only can you see the deleted scenes and alternate ending on the DVD, you can learn the reasons why the changes were made.  The DVD includes a short documentary discussing the screen tests done for the film; as a result of these screen tests, the movie was altered rather dramatically in order to better please the intended audience.  This documentary provides some great insight into how movies actually get made.  A second documentary tells the story of a real-life &quot;intuitive investigator.&quot;  While this 19-minute feature is interesting up to a point, I really do not see why in the world it was included here.  Back on the plus side, there are several commentaries of the movie included on the DVD.  Final Destination is quite a good movie in and of itself, and this bounty of extra features makes the DVD a great purchase for those who enjoy psychological thrillers.ex and Clear Rivers (Ali Larter) is especially ambiguous.

B000005JA8|5.0|Yes, it's ugly at times. Yes, it's dissonant. Yes, it sounds like music from a different planet. Yes, it is quite possibly the most unique sounding album ever. Yes, it is also beautiful in it's own way. Like a painting by Gorky or Dekooning, you either connect with the beauty and uniqueness of this album or not. I do. And if you think this is random jamming and noodling, you are dead wrong. It is meticulously composed and arranged and it is some of the most complex music ever written. If you can learn to appreciate the music of Charles Ives, Frank Zappa, and Henry Cow, then this music is for you. The great Captain's music is on par with all of those aforementioned artists, to say the least. I urge all of you with an open mind and heart to ignore those ignorant 1-star reviews and decide for yourself. This album may just change the way you hear music forever. Thanks for reading.

B0000AXE8I|4.0|The Matrix Reloaded was one of the most highly anticipated movies of 2003 but it received a less than rapturous response from the critics on its theatrical release and under-performed at the box office, despite making over $275 m to date in the U.S. alone. This is not to say that it's bad. It certainly isn't and for the most part I thoroughly enjoyed The Matrix Reloaded. It's just not as good as the first movie and not as good as expected. Furthermore it is another classic Hollywood example of failing to grasp the simple concept that less is sometimes more. For if the Wachowski brothers are guilty of anything then it is over egging the pudding.<br />So what's good and what's bad about The Matrix 2? Well, let's start with the good.<br />First off, The Matrix Reloaded is (in parts) jaw-droppingly spectacular in scale and confidence with three or four action breath taking sequences that go beyond anything else ever attempted on celluloid. This is the all-new flying and exploding upgrade and The Wachowskis, Yuen Wo-Ping and John Gaeta's effects wizards have combined to create some stunningly original sequences. The best of which include; Neo (Keanu Reeves) battling 100 Agent Smiths (Hugo Weaving), a chateau sword-fight and in particular a lengthy freeway set sequence where Neo, Morpheus, Trinity, indulge in a free for all with Agents Johnson, Jackson and the virtually indestructible Merovingian twins. On this basis alone The Matrix Reloaded completely delivers (and then some) exactly what its fans want and the second half of the movie is nothing short of excellent  but the first hour in particular contains some very glaring faults.<br />The biggest thing that is wrong with The Matrix Reloaded is that it is far too long (138 minutes) and full of unnecessary and elongated sequences that could have been trimmed back half an hour or so. Due to this, the opening hour of Reloaded positively labours and the Zion-set opening sequence is at least a quarter of an hour overlong with a rather pointless and frankly rubbish love scene between Trinity and Neo among it's many unnecessary moments. There is also far too much furrowing of Neo's brow and emphasis on cod philosophy (more pretentious than profound) and the nature of choice, free will and reality. Apart from this being far too earnest it is also very much a repetition of everything already discussed in the first movie. Meanwhile, many of the new characters are decidedly underwritten and the likes of Monica Bellucci and Jada Pinkett Smith are frankly wasted. Plus, whilst accepting that this is the middle part of a trilogy, the plot is very linear and by the time the credits roll it could be argued that the story has hardly advanced from the end of part one.<br />All that said the second half of the movie is very exciting rollercoater ride and succeeds in raising the bar in action and SFX. On this basis alone, Reloaded is still well worth watching and worthy of 4 stars but just be warned, it isn't as good as its five star predecessor...with a rather pointless and frankly rubbish love scene between Trinity and Neo among it's many unnecessary moments.

B0000AI44Q|5.0|Neil Young has been prone to ups and downs throughout his recording career, but he has hit a grand slam with this one. It is truly amazing that a 57-year old, with Neil's extensive past, could create an innovative CD like this one that challenges himself and his audience in 2003.<BR>  <BR>For those who like Neil's blues-based, guitar-driven rock that can be found on \\"Rust Never Sleeps\\" or \\"Ragged Glory\\", you will love the CD version of this release.  As on his other releases with Crazy Horse, the \\"live\\" feel of the music (and occasion missed notes) only add to the excitement generated by this off-course garage band.  The music is immediately accessible and stands up very well to repeated listenings.  His guitar solos, in particular, stand out after continued rotations.<br />The lyrical content and character descriptions keep things interesting.  Although the ending is a bit weak, the visual imagery established in the first 7 songs is fantastic.  You feel like you know the characters of Greendale by the time the music stops.<br />If you prefer his softer side, the DVD acoustic version of the songs is incredible.  It also fills in the detail between the installments and provides a further backdrop to this strange town.<br />\\"Falling from Above\\" is one of the best songs on the release and sets up the story well.<br />\\"Double E\\", \\"Devil's Sidewalk\\", and \\"Leave the Driving\\" are excellent guitar-based blues.  It will be difficult to get these repeated licks out of your head.  <br />\\"Bandit\\" is as good as any acoustic-based ballad that Neil has written.<br />\\"Carmichael\\" and \\"Grandpa's Interview\\" are instant classics and, despite their length, end too quickly.  The guitar solos are perfect and you can imagine the scene as each succeeding verse plays out.  \\"Carmichael\\" is my favorite.<br />\\"Sun Green\\" and \\"Be the Rain\\" flat out ROCK !!! (although the use of the megaphone is annoying with the initial listen).  If you like extended guitar jams, these are the songs for you.<br/>Before this purchase, I only owned 3 other Neil Young CDs (Live Rust, Freedom, and Ragged Glory) and this is as good, if not better than those classics.  <br />Do yourself a favor and don't let this one pass you by.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|I was deeply saddened to find out that At The Drive-In broke up shortly after I borrowed this CD from my cousin and burned it. I had never heard of At The Drive-In and was wondering what kind of music is this. I can't honestly tell you, its an experience you would have to experience to know what it is. This band was as great as Zeppelin and Pink Floyd were! They should be in the Hall of Fame because ATDI were a bunch of complex rockers with a point, that you couldn't quite figure out. The sounds were always grungy and punk in nature but not too repetitive, the lyrics Floyd like but were in a category all their own. <br />R.I.P.<BR>AT THE DRIVE IN!
B0000039QA|5.0|\\"Life After Death\\" was the last true album by the late and great Notorious B.I.G.(one love). Comparing to Ready to die, Biggies skills went down, but are still gangsta. Production was just as good, even better than Ready to Die. Tracks like miss u showed biggie's maturity and busting gats isn't all it's cracked up to be. Yet on songs like ten crack commandments and n****s bleed give you the felling he didn't forget the hood. just brilliant definitive hip hop.
B00005OCMR|4.0|Tron was a groundbreaking, visually stunning movie when it came out, and the effects are still enjoyable (if anachronistic).  However, those who aren't original fans or hardcore geeks will probably only enjoy the movie on an ironic level- the dialogue is laugably bad.  As my wife said- &quot;this movie is ripe for MST3k treatment&quot;.<br />But I'm a computer geek, and although the science is terrible, what I appreciate the most about Tron's story is how well it captures the essence of the &quot;politics&quot; of computers at the time it was written.  The struggle of the users and programs against the &quot;Master Control Program&quot; in the movie mimics the real-life frustration many users had with centrally controlled, large UNIX and mainframe systems they had to work on in the mid-seventies, often paying for computer time by the minute.  This frustration lead a small group of engineers to start building small &quot;personal&quot; computers as a hobby (and then as a business), finally freeing users from the tyranny of limited computer access.<br />The THX-certified 20th Anniversary Collector's Edition delivers a faithful rendition of the movie- lacking a high def TV, I can't comment too much on the transfer quality other than &quot;it looked good&quot; on my 29&quot; tube.  Sound is a different story- although dialogue levels are a bit low at times, the effects track is stupendous, with the best use of the rear channels I've heard from a movie of this vintage and lots of LFE.  Your subwoofer will really enjoy this one.<br />The &quot;extras&quot; in this edition are quite excellent, giving mind-numbingly thorough coverage of the conception and development of the movie, although I was disappointed with the lack of detail in the coverage of the pure CGI sequences (like the lightcycles).<br />Overall, I'd definitely recommend this DVD to fans of the original movie who want to learn more about its background, but if you haven't seen it for 20 years, you may want torent first to decide whether you really still like it.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Seems Radiohead took the experimenting in Kid A and Amnesiac and came back towards OK Computer with Hail to the Thief... musically there is still an experimental tone to the whole album.... but there are more sounds of OK on this one....<br />songs like 2+2=5, Sit Down, Stand Up, There There, Myxsomatosis, and Scatterbrain sound great live..... I saw them recently in Wisconsin, (august 23rd 2003) and Thom and Johnny were playing with the cameras, dancing around and they couldnt have sounded better... Thom was smiling and dancing alot more than last time around....<br />Just like all Radiohead albums... buy it and listen it will fit into their growing library.... cheers.
B0000B1OFL|5.0|While fans of the original film have been fearful that the 21st century version would not match up to the merits of the first film, this adaption by F. Gary Gray is whimsical and rollicking... only different.  Mark Wahlberg leads a strong cast in this retelling which pits our criminal heroes against a criminal criminal, played coolly by Ed Norton.  While reports that Norton was forced to take this part may be true, he is still a true professional and turns in a wonderfully weasily performance.  There is lots of action and plenty of comedy.  Seth Green will have you laughing so hard you'll be crying.  With some fantastic action sequences that used no CGI whatsoever, you won't feel shorted on thrills.  They don't make them like this anymore -- or at least, they don't do it very often.  Great film and perfect for multiple viewings.
078322737X|5.0|\\"Where were you in `62?\\"<br />I wasn't around in `62 -- I was born in `63, as a matter of fact, and I was 10 when George Lucas' American Graffiti was released.  I wasn't really aware of either George Lucas or American Graffiti in 1973, although four years later I would know Lucas from his next -- and most popular -- film, Star Wars.  I did not go to the movies much in 1973, but I saw this wonderful film when it was broadcast by ABC some years later.  (ABC, capitalizing on its \\"hot\\" new sitcom, Three's Company, shamelessly promoted it as \\"starring Suzanne Somers.\\"  In fact, Suzanne is not even billed with the eight \\"stars.\\")<br />If film and television historians have it right, though, American Graffiti was the catalyst for the 1950s Nostalgia fad that begat TV's Happy Days, Laverne and Shirley, and the blessedly short-lived Joanie Loves Chachi (not to mention Sha Na Na and Broadway`s Grease).  And it isn't terribly surprising that Happy Days and its spin-offs owe their inspiration -- if not their very existence -- to Lucas' first major culturally significant film.  Happy Days starred Ron Howard, who (as Ronny Howard) had second billing in Graffiti, while Laverne and Shirley costar Cindy Williams was the female lead.<br />American Graffiti is a bittersweet yet comedic look at what the DVD publicity blurb says was \\"America's last age of innocence.\\" In the summer of `62, JFK was in the White House, the Beatles were still unknown in this side of the Atlantic, and drive in diners and movie palaces were very popular.  There was no Internet or even Studio 54 just yet, so kids went cruising, looking for girls to pick up or rivals to race in their souped-up hot rods. (Lucas, in the Making Of documentary on the 25th Anniversary DVD, says his intent in making American Graffiti was to document cruising as a socio-cultural phenomenon that died in the more turbulent half of the 1960s.)<br />The movie's structure -- commonplace now but it was revolutionary at the time -- intertwines several plots involving a group of recently graduated Southern California high school seniors on their last night before going to college.  Curt (Richard Dreyfuss) is fretting about going to college in the East with his friend Steve (Howard).  Wracked with indecision, he spends his last night in town searching for The Blonde in the White Thunderbird (Suzanne Somers in her first, albeit small, role).  His misadventures cause him to step out of character, especially when he crosses paths with The Pharohs, the local gang of miscreants.<br />Curt's sister Laurie (Williams) must not only cope with her brother's last minute bout with \\"cold feet\\" but with the fear of losing Steve.  In what may be a typical situation for couples who are \\"steady\\" but are going to be separated by circumstances, she's devastated by Steve's suggestion that they \\"see other people\\" while they are in school. \\"I can't expect you to be a monk,\\" Laurie says with false bravado, but in \\"The Smoke Gets In Your Eyes\\" sequence, it is obvious that she is hurt and angry.<br />The other two subplots of this wonderful film center on Toad (Charlie Martin Smith) and John (Paul Le Mat).  Toad is the car-crazy, girl-deprived nerd that we either knew in school or that we recognize in ourselves.  His attempts to impress the lovely Debbie (Candy Clark) are hilarious -- rivaled only by a similarly themed scene in Summer of '42 -- only to discover that Debbie likes him for who he really is.  John, on the other hand, is the Han Solo of this bunch, the high school dropout who loves fast cars and even faster women.  He, too, discovers a tender side as he is saddled with 12-year-old Carol (a pre-One Day at a Time Mackenzie Phillips).  Not only must he learn patience while driving around with Carol, but also he is being challenged as the top drag racer by Bob Falfa (played by the man who would be Han Solo, Harrison Ford).<br />All these stories will converge in a climactic, winner take all race, and several Lucas touchstones will resurface in his later Star Wars series -- the choice to either take or reject a certain path, the relationship between men and their machines, and the quest for either love or adventure.<br />Serving as a unifying thread to all these subplots is Wolfman Jack, mostly heard on the radio but seen briefly in a Yoda/Ben Kenobi style of mentor for restless Curt.<br />Lucas uses music here very effectively.  Each song (and there are over 40 here, ranging from Rock Around the Clock to The Great Pretender) was chosen to provide emotional context, not just period atmosphere.  He envisioned American Graffiti as a musical \\"with no singing or dancing.\\"<br />This film is fun to watch and definitely deserves having been votes as one of the American Film Institute's top 100 Films of All Time.  Watch it with a friend or alone, and if you were of age in the 1960s, answer the movie's famous log line: \\"Where were you in `62?\\"stones will resurface in his later Star Wars series -- the choice to either take or reject a certain path, the relationship between men and their machines, and the quest for either love or adventure.<br />Serving as a unifying thread to all these subplots is Wolfman Jack, mostly heard on the radio but seen briefly in a Yoda/Ben Kenobi style of mentor for restless Curt.<br />Lucas uses music here very effectively.

B000099T2L|5.0|Wow, I'm impressed. I didn't think Beyonce could get down like that but she's come with an amazing solo debut.  She showcases some unseen talent that gives her more of an identity that Destiny's Child was unable to promote.  4 songs alone give this cd a 5 star rating in my oppinion.  The first 3 tracks and &quot;Signs&quot; are amazing.  But my favourite is &quot;Signs&quot; with Missy.  If your into astrology, you will totally dig this song. The lyrics are awesome.    And I love the Missy rap!!!!  Beyonce can be very intimidating because of her overwhelming beauty, and those weird hair dye commercials, but you can't deny her creativity and vocal abilities.  A great release.
006016848X|1.0|John Gray considers himself an expert in relationships, and he claims to understand women. So, why is he surprised when his wife cries after hearing that he wants a few affairs on the side, although - the considerate man - naturally would keep it secret from the neighbours? How can he be so proud of his frequent \\"quickies\\" with his wife, meaning quick sexual intercourse purely for the man's satisfaction? How can he confuse his \\"proudly dodging his wife's stories\\" with real listening? Does this man understand women? I seriously doubt it. If you need advice, look elsewhere
B00003CWL6|5.0|This is one of my favourite movies ever.  I think the best time to watch it is when your extremely depressed, the message sinks in more.  Every performance in this film is brilliant.  I especially liked Mira Suvari's performance, her character grew on me.  Of course, one of the most poignant scenes is the infamous Wes Bentley scene with that bittersweet dialogue &quot;there's so much beauty in the world, etc....&quot;  When I saw that scene, I sort of cried, it was embarrassing.  But if that one scene doesn't affect you with any emotional impact, you don't have a pulse.  One new tidbit I discovered about &quot;American Beauty&quot; after reading the credits is, Paula Abdul did the choreography for the cheerleading sequence, interesting........Everyone I have talked to absolutely loved this film, I can't imagine any bad critism.  I guess some people just don't get it.
B00006RU5B|4.0|Before hearing this album I heard alot of good things said about the band.  I didn't hear much of the old Rage Against the Machine music and the same goes for the old Soundgarden stuff but what I can say is the merging of the two talents has produced an awesome album.  <br />In my opinion what I heard of the old Rage Against the Machine music was pretty good, funk and rock merged together, it was a surprisingly good concept, I just didn't like the politics emphasized in the music.  I don't care what the government is doing or not doing, that's something am concerned about during other parts of my life, not when I have time to just sit back and relax.  Plus the dreary voice of Zack de a Rocha is now gone so am sure sales of Tylenol will decrease.<br />With Audioslave you get a great set of songs, I don't know if its just me but I get an old school rock feeling from this album, that's what drove me to buying it.  Heavy guitar and bass, good drums and somewhat strange lyrics.  Its the perfect mix for rock, I love some of the sounds these guys make, especially the Third song on the album, gasoline, the guitar work is amazing.  These guys have used there creative talents to make a true album, you don't get that commercial feeling as you do with other records, they don't use profanity to sell records, in this day and age that deserves a lot of respect.  <br />This album is also greatly versatile, I have fell asleep listening to this music, I have found myself motivated to this music and I have partied to this music, you can't beat the content of this album with the new bands that are out now.  For all its worth I would seriously recommend buying this album.<br />4 Stars

B00003CXE7|5.0|excellent dvd and very good movie. fun to watch. I enjoyed it enormously. Gladiators fighting against chariots is one of the best combat scenes ever made and make you understand why it took so long to outlaw gladiator fights in Rome. Almost makes you want to be there and watch it live!<br />opening battle with Germans is done impressively, but super inaccurate: <BR>Romans won their wars not with cavalry charges but with marches of superbly disciplined, trained and equipped infantry. <BR>Cavalry at that time was used only to chase and finish off routed enemy. <BR>They did not even have stirrups yet, which made horseman effective on the battle field few centuries later. during the period when Gladiator takes place cavalry could not and would not make a &quot;decisive charge&quot;. <BR>and finally, in that battle German tribesmen were MUCH more likely to have mounted troops than Romans, which they don't.
B00009V7PJ|5.0|After seeing Cher's farewell tour on television, I knew that I wanted to have something to commemorate her final tour extravaganza. From beginning to end, Cher keeps us fascinated by her ever changing looks and her unmistakable voice, the DVD has something for everyone who has ever followed the career of this one of a kind diva. Included in the DVD are bonus materials that give a behind the scenes glimpse at all the elements that go into making Cher's farewell tour a visual spectacle, including costumes, sets, rehearsals, and much more. For anyone who loves Cher, this is a DVD that must be included in one's collection. It spans the entire length of her career through costumes, music, and film. Definitely a show to be watched over and over just to see Cher dazzle the audience with costumes that range from Indian dress (where she enters the stage on a colorful eye catching elephant) to the days of fur vests from the early Sonny and Cher days. Cher covers all the bases in this show, singing all the songs that made her famous. Also, the exciting clips from her television days give us glimpses of duets sung with the likes of Tina Turner, Elton John, the Jackson Five, David Bowie, all of which show how versatile Cher as a performer was and is. Cher was correct when she stated at the beginning of the show wearing an outrageous costume depicting a circus ring leader--with a whip--This is the Cherest show on Earth!She will never be surpassed by any of the so called stars of today.
B00009V7T2|1.0|Maybe my opinion of this album would be different if I hadn't heard the demo version of Roulette Dares first, which was powerful without being overwrought. I popped this CD into my player fully expecting the other nine tracks to be just as good. Oof. I was wrong.<br />Rick Rubin (Sheryl Crow, The Black Crowes and worse) was an unfortunate choice of producer. The unsettlingly slick production values are an unfortunate counterpoint to Cedric Bixler's scenery-chewing vocals. The songs are overlong and often downright embarrassing. Lyrics like \\"A capulary hint of red/Only this manupod/Crescent in shape has escaped\\" make me want to smack somebody and burn the thesaurus. I felt as though I were cornered by an angsty junior high school student who was forcibly reading his poetry to me. Yeah. It was that painful.<br />The emperor wears no clothes, kids. This is a (delete) record, and no amount of overintellectualizing can save it now. Let's move on, pretend that it never happened and cross our fingers in the hope that this prog-rock revival is a fluke, not a trend. I'll end this review by pointing out that being Latino does not mean that everything you do \\"sounds like Santana.\\"
B000000M4M|5.0|\\"Bug\\" is an outstanding album on its own, though it is not-- in my opinion-- as good as its predecessor.  Still, there is little to complain about on this CD.  Even the uber-obnoxious \\"Don't\\" is tolerable due to J Mascis' extended jam in the background.  \\"Freak Scene\\" is a Dinosaur staple.  \\"They Always Come\\" is a punk delight that transforms into an orgasmic, heavenly, layered guitar burst for its second half.  Even the overlooked \\"The Post\\" was good enough for the Cowboy Junkies to later cover (with questionable success).  This is a must-have for any respectable Dinosaur fan, or for any fan of true indie rock.
0440234743|4.0|An intriguing mix of secularism and religion. Moralistic but not preachy. This story, while having an ending that is slightly predictable, has many intereting twists and turns. As one who has been on mission trips, this book is well researched and realistic. If you are the non-religious type, don't let this book scare you away. You will enjoy it strictly for the story.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|I consider myself lucky to have seen Neil Young (the first time) live with Buffalo Springfield in 1967. Since then I have followed everything he's done. Always changing but still the thing I liked has been there and kept me buying his stuff. When I bought \\"Greendale\\" (Neil Young &amp; Crazy Horse) I expected that loose rock n roll that most every Crazy Horse album has produced in the past. Wrong, this is a story, a musical novel (all 79 minutes of it) and it's a refreshing work that takes more time to get to know than a good percentage of the music I own. I truly believe the time was well spent. Greendale has shades of lots of very early Neil Young material and he blends it well to tell the story. If you purchase Greendale I would suggest watching &amp; listening to the DVD that comes with the CD prior to listening to the audio only. You have to get to know the Greens.
B00005RHGK|1.0|Now I'm not one to point fingers, but some one on this review bored called the people giving this movie bad reviews ignorant. How they can justify calling some one ignorant after not like THIS movie is beyond my comprehension. Now I'm not insulting anyone who liked this movie because not everyone has the same taste, but in my opinion this movie was TERRIBLE. This could even quite possibly be one of the THE WORST movies I have ever seen. Starting with the conversation in the car I knew this movie was going to be terrible, and it was. There was not one scary moment in this whole movie and I regret ever taking two hours out of my life to watch it. Just a horrible, HORRIBLE movie. Now to sit here and say this movie was bad and not give any reason just wouldn't be fair.<BR>Why This Movie Was Terrible:<BR>* From the beginning to the end, this movie had absolutely no intelligence with any character. Just basic 'sure let me go down this dark creepy tunnel with no flashlight' scenario.<BR>* Boring. Any moment when they weren't doing something stupid they were talking and I cannot describe to how terribly boring the conversations were.<BR>* Bland. This movie consisted of the same old horror/ thriller formula that has been used to death. No redeeming qualities at all.<BR>So with all this said the only good scene throughout the whole movie you're probably telling yourself that there that had to be AT LEAST one good scene. Well the end was the only good scene in the movie, not becuase it was a twist or anything, but if you hated this movie as much as I did then you'll understand why. So in short, BAD HORRIBLE TERRIBLE movie and I highly recommend you not watch.

B00004XOWM|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums of all time. There are no bands that can hold a candle to Limp Bizkit. First of all, the level of musicianship has clearly gone up on this album, resulting in some great songs, like &quot;Rollin&quot; &quot;Take a Look Around&quot; and &quot;Hot Dog&quot;. Fred Durst's lyrics have gotten better, and the whole bands has a better sense of grooving. I highly recommend this instead of bands like Sabbath, Metallica, or Nirvana.
B00005JKN9|2.0|A not too subtle lesson that violence never solves anything. I found the movie far too bloody for my taste. However, those who enjoyed \\"Fight Club\\" would probably like this movie, as well.
B000005JA8|4.0|..and that's why i love it.  There's nothing like listening to this album, and I immediately respected it upon my first listening.  It's not a Pandora's box, you'll never be able to &quot;Get It&quot;.  The sheer beauty of it is that there isn't anything to get.  It's just a unbelievably strange album.  I like it because it doesn't apologize for its weirdness, and while I'd never listen to it like an Elvis Costello album (beginning to end), I certainly love playing a few songs for a giggle and a little trip into utter randomness.  You never know where the song will go, where it will end up, or how it's going to get there.  It has no chains on it, and that's its best feature.<BR>I would have given this album 5 stars, but the fact that it's just too strange for some people keeps it from getting such an honor.  When i play it for some people, they laugh and are thouroughly weirded out, or they act like I'm a fool for buying it.  I believe it's worth having as a backup for when you're tired of conventional music or want something completely different.
B00006LLNU|5.0|This album is brilliant. 8 songs over 70 minutes of hauntingly beautiful music. Hard to explain, you have to listen to this cd to understand. Hear it with an open mind and it will unlock many doors for your aural senses.
B000002BPS|3.0|Ok, I own Smash, Americana, and Conspiracy of One so when i bought this album I was expecting Ixnay on the Hombre to be like the other ones, a cd that you could listen to all the way through. But its not. From what I've heard off this album there's maybe 5 or 6 good songs, the others being not up to standard. I love the other 3 c.d's I mentioned and would give them 6 out of 5 stars but this just did not sound as good to me. Luckily, it isnt a new album which means The Offspring bounced back from this average cd and have made 2 of the best cd's I own in a row. If you're a hardcore fan buy this, or if you like 5 or 6 songs like me you can still buy it but try to get it under 10 dollars.
B000024D4R|5.0|Its a great album. Their master concept album. Its their most underrated album though. Coming out after Darkside Of The Moon and Wish You Were Here, this album was different from those two albums. This album is very dark. The music on this album is beautiful and the guitar work is THE BEST DAVID GILMOUR has ever done. The lyrics are wonderful. All the elements came together on this masterpiece. If you're new to Pink Floyd I recommend \\"Darkside Of The Moon\\" before this album just to get you into them. But if you want to get more into them and hear their masterpiece buy this album today. You will not be let down.
B0000A02TZ|5.0|Animal House is the movie that made John Belusi as movie star. His turn as John &quot;Bluto&quot; Blutarsky showed all the physical comedic gifts that he possessed. He doesn't speak much in the film, but he elicits big laughs by simple facial gestures or actions such as climbing a ladder and spying on a girl's dorm room or by going through the food line in the cafeteria and loading up his tray, pockets and quickly munching on food as he goes along. The movie doesn't have much of a plot, it centers around a misfit, party happy fraternity being kicked off campus by the evil dean and supposedly high morals rival frat. What the movie does have is classic lowbrow humor in the form of food fights, sexual situations and the like. Tim Matheson is excellent as the womanizing Otter, Peter Riegert and Karen Allen are good as the on and off couple Boon &amp; Katie, Stephen Furst is perfect as the bumbling Flounder, Mark Metcalf adds the right amount of slime and is absolutely hateable as Neidermayer, John Vernon is imposing as Dean Wormer and Tom Hulce brings the perfect amount nativity to Pinto. Kevin Bacon has a bit part as a member of the rival frat and Donald Sutherland has a cameo as an English professor who gets Katie, Boon &amp; Pinto stoned. The movie was a mega-success and spawned many imitators, none of which could capture Animal House's humor and charm.  This new double secret probation edition has some great extras including a Delta Alumi update which hilariously looks at where the characters of the film are today.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|I love when an album that I've been anticipating lives up to my hype. A7X kept intense screaming vocals we heard on Sounding the Seventh Trumpet, but added a lot more melodic singing. M. Shadows' vocals have really improved on this album. With a lot of metal or hardcore, the songs start to get repetitive, but on Waking the Fallen, every song keeps you interested. Like on StST there are some slower songs (good thing), but not really straight up punk songs (bad thing). I'm sure its the new producer, Mudrock (godsmack, yuck). Overall, this cd is great, a refreshing listen in the metal/hardcore world.
0066620996|5.0|I must admit that I was a Jim Collins fan before because his book, Built to Last, was such a great read on why some companies do so well and other companies, despite the best intentions and the same environment, simply do not do as well.<br />But he has really eclipsed the story with this book.  Not only does he clearly explain his research and methodology in this book, but he focuses on factors that are much more &quot;doable&quot;.  In &quot;Built to Last&quot; the companies had been around for at least 50 years.  In &quot;Good to Great&quot; he focuses on shorter term issues and results - things that can be applied, today, in your company.<br />His research team seemed to be top notch.  His methodology is structured enough to show validity while flexible enough to demonstrate real issues and solutions.<br />To top it all off, the book is so easy to read!  It does not read like a boring business book - it is an exciting story of what the research team found and how they found it.  I couldn't put the book down - it was that interesting.<br />If you only have time to read a single business book this year, make it this one.  You will enjoy it and learn something that will help you next year to boot.
0671042858|3.0|Well, since this is not the first Stephen King book I've read, I was quite disappointed of the story. That doesn't mean it's not good, it's just not scary enough. On the other hand, though the story started quite slow at first, it picked up the pace and you began to relate to Trish as she struggled to survive in the woods. The suspense is when night arrives and all creatures come out, and you could feel the tension of not knowing what is out there, and you wonder if there will be a happy ending after all. The climax is a little bit of a letdown, but I think the adventure has made up for it. An average book.
1577311523|3.0|This book is okay as far as it goes. We all pretty much agree that we need to get clearer. But for actual techniques to acquire a state of mindfulness, awareness, or present reality I suggest The Power of Full Engagement or if you are battling real negativity and anxiety, Depression is a Choice.
B000002I6T|5.0|David Crosby made major contributions (that went uncredited) to the Byrds album, &quot;The Notorious Byrd Bros.&quot; on his way out of that group. He went on to CS&amp;N then to this solo LP.  <BR>This album is a natural, if more organic follow up to the heaven rock of the aforementioned Byrds masterpiece. Both albums flow unbroken as single pieces of music, folk-rock symphonies that flowered in the brilliant period of experimentation that followed in the wake of such all-together-now albums as Pet Sounds and Sgt. Peppers.<BR>If you've ever wanted to imagine watching a sunset over the Pacific on a lazy Marin county afternoon, this is your soundtrack. Come inside afterwards, there's candles burning and hot tea to drink.<BR>This is masterpiece that takes folk rock to places no one else ever conceived, as innovative as Coltrane in jazz, or Gehry in architecture, a criminally overlooked product of the collective genius that flared too briefly in a magic place called northern California.<BR>I was there. it all seems so far away now . . . at least until I put this CD on.
0385720920|5.0|Our story is about a man who dropped out of medical school. He is Victor Mancini, and he is also Jesus Christ's heir, and he is a hard-core sex addict, and his touch can heal. He starts out the very novel with Victor attending a sexual addiction meeting, or at least going there to pick up babes. What better place to feed the fire, than with others who need to feed it? In one of the funniest scenes in the whole book, he starts out describing a very hot, yet seedy sexual encounter with a girl from the addicts group. They are on the floor of the bathroom in a community building, and the grime is under their backs and in their skin. She is on top and riding him, and then he makes her turn away and face the front (around the world) and so she does, which nearly makes him trigger. He has her turn around so that he can fill out his sponsor form on her back while they are doing it, he is supposed to be her sponsor...\\"a drunkard's dream if I ever did see one...\\" Well, you get the idea. This novel is a knockout! The best novel I purchase off Amazon this month since THE LOSERS' CLUB by Richard Perez. Highly enjoyable and recommended! Readers unite!
B00009W0U4|5.0|O.K., let me just start by saying that i'm tired of seeing all these reviews here on Amazon!  Blah, blah, blah, there is no need to show so much violence, blah, blah, blah, there is enough violence in the real world and we know it exists, blah, blah, blah.  Listen, printed on the front of this dvd in big letters is WARNING: CONTAINS GRAPHIC SEX AND VIOLENCE.  So if you don't want to see this type of film then don't buy it and don't watch it.  Instead, sit down with the family, a big bowl of popcorn and watch The Wizard Of Oz!!!<BR>    Sorry, just had to get that off my chest.  Now for the people who actually like this type of film, this is one of the most brutal, gut wrenching films i've ever seen.  Kudos to Gasper Noe on such a brillant masterpiece.  Let me just say that I love Indie films and classic gore films(I have over 200 in my collection)so I am not a novice when it comes to this type of genre.  Check out my other reviews on films such as Ilsa-She Wolf Of The SS, Boise Moi, Tim Roth's The War Zone, etc.  I love Lucio Fulci, and of course the godfather of horror, Dario Argento.  My point is that i'm pretty much jaded when it comes to shocking or disturbing material, and Irreversible is one that will stay with me for a long time.  <BR>    I loved this film for many reasons but mainly because how much Noe makes you feel involved with the main characters.  Since it's told in reverse you don't feel this way right away, but you will.  I'm not going to get into the whole plot line because so many others have already done that for me.  What i'm really here to say is that this is a very REAL movie.  Like it all is really happing right before our eyes and we need to stick around to find out what happens.  Noe's vision is surperb, and in his own way very artistic.  I'm tellin' ya, see this film.<BR>    There are a couple things I would like to point out that some other reviewers failed to elaborate on.  For those of you who saw Noe's previous film, I Stand Alone, I waswondering if anyone got the opening sequence of this film.  The movie opens with two guys talking in a small apartment upstairs from the club where the murder takes place.  Did anyone realize that it's the guy from I Stand Alone, and that he is still in character from that film?  His is telling the other guy that he was locked up for having sex with his daughter.  To me is was like leaving off of I Stand Alone and going right into Irreversible.  Excellent touch!!!!<BR>    Also, in some of the other reviews, some made it sound like there was a sort of triumph to this film, or that justice was done.  That is so untrue.  There is no happy ending here, the good guys don't win.  I mean sure, the guy who rapes Alex and beats Marcus to a bloody pulp with only half of his face left(there will be no open casket for him) does get arrested, but if you were into the characters as much as I was, you really wanted to see this pr*%k, at the least, get tortured to death or set on fire or something.  So to me there was no justice.<BR>    Anyway, if you want to see a movie that will leave a lasting impression in your head then pick this one up.  It may not be a happy impression, but a impression none-the-less.  I am so tired of the senseless dribble that comes out of Hollywood these days.  All these big corporate movies with big name stars that when the movie is over, you feel like you just wasted 2 hours of your life.  <BR>    Is it just me or don't people notice that most of the films made these days are geared tward teenie-boppers, or movies that are PC?  I'm glad to see that there are still directors out there that have the balls to make a film thats over the top, or geared to the adult viewer.  Even if we have to get them from somewhere like France!!!   NEVER FORGET 9/11/01!!!!
B00005JLWN|5.0|Equilibrium is basically a modern mix pulling from the motif of Fahrenheit 451 and the action of The Matrix. I enjoyed this film  because it hits on the philosophical argument of what causes man to commit acts of violence against fellow man. Equilibrium is basically a satyr of where humanity would have to go in order for man to stop this primal urge that spawns violence, and how we would have to live in a society that strips away our humanity. Emotion would become a crime because it is the primary factor that leads to violent crime. The protagonist battles with himself through out the movie to determine if the price of emotion and feelings out way the consequences that he realizes they can lead to.  I also enjoy the fact that the action is good but is there to support the plot development, rather then the other way around.
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|It is short but nothing short of absolutely beautiful (and I don't use that word often).  It absolutely kills me everytime.  If it had the acappella version of New World from the end of Dancer in the Dark I wouldn't be able to listen to it without breaking down.  Such an amazing movie and such staggering music.  Life altering.
0393317552|3.0|Let me start by prefacing with &quot;I enjoyed this book.&quot;  It was interesting and informative, however, it is not as Earth shattering as some here may want you to think, and it is not as &quot;reverse-racism&quot; or lacking in fact as others here may lead you to believe.  It is somewhere in between.<br />Jared Diamond attempts to refute racist theories of why each society became what it was, and why people of Eurasia, specifically of Europe, became the dominant people, while other aboriginal people such as Native Americans or Africans did not.<br />He of course is a geographic determinist that believes ultimate causes are extremely important, and not just proximate causes.  For example, Europeans had guns, steel, and evolved germs thanks to densely populated towns that lived in close proximity with domesticated animals, and germs evolved to fit humans from these animals.  The humans that survived became resistant.  Food production was much more efficient with the advent of plant domestication, and thus many people could be sedentary, become full time soldiers, scientists, and to be able set up organized government.  The ultimate causes to these proximate factors were of course plant domestication and animal domestication, which because of native wild species that were able to be domesticated, the east-west axis dominant axis of Eurasia promoting the spread of domesticated crops and animals, as well as domesticable animals that reside in Eurasia all helped lead up to things such as guns, germs, and steel.<br />Basically, Diamond makes a case for environments being the major factor in why Europe ended up the most powerful continent.  He is extremely convincing in it as well.  I suggest anyone that is interested in the evolution of human society to read this book.  However, I have a handful of complaints.<br />Diamond places too much importance in ultimate causes and not proximate causes.  While I agree environment was the major factor in the development in societies, things such as scientific inquiry and mercantilism are what catapulted Europe to become the most powerful continent in the world.  I do not attribute the evolution of such things to the greatness of one race over another (as countries such as China, and much of the middle east were inventive in earlier years), but credit must be given where credit is due, and this is mainly because of cultural differences.  Not race, and not environment.  The Europeans may have developed this first, but many other societies did not adopt these strategies until far later, and some even today have not.  That is attributed to the idiosyncrasies of those individual peoples, which thanks to individuals promoting certain cultures came about.<br />Also, Diamond's assertion that New Guinean people are on the average smarter than Americans, and that stone age people were probably more intelligent than current people can be argued to an extent, however, I believe that argument is offensive and very flawed.  I do not consider hunter gatherers more intelligent than sedentary people, nor do I believe it is vice versa.  I have yet to see a convincing argument from either side in showing that increased intelligence gives you an evolutionary advantage over others, thus producing more offspring and increasing allele frequency in the population.  <br />Also, the nature vs nurture argument is not yet proved in either aspect, however, there is reason to believe that a gene on chromosome #6 has to do with intelligence, and perhaps reason to believe there are more genes of this nature.  Evolutionary speaking, it is hard to say that hunter gatherers, farmers, or people from ancient times or moderm times are actually selecting for this gene.  Once humans evolved to what is considered the anatomically correct cro-magnom, I have not seen any evidence of increased evolution in intelligence.  Why assert New Guinean's may be on the average smarter than Americans, when a case really cannot be made for either?<br />It is evident that environment shaped the early beginning's of society.  But because of a handful of idividuals, the courses of different societies had been changed, and this trascended the environment.  This is not because of a race's innate intelligence over another.  Perhaps by random chance that certain individuals were born and instilled with certain values and teachings, and  then subsequently advanced society in both social aspects as well as technological aspects.<br />I cannot deny the sedentary vs hunter/gatherer societies as well as his tribal/chiefdom/state arguments when it concerns the development of political organization and the advent of technology.  I can though, say that the proximate causes came about not just because of environment, but also because of the genius or uniqueness of certain individuals throughout history, born by random luck and shaped by the culture they live in.<br />So if you want to read Guns, Germs, and Steel - expect a book that elucidates many points by inference, but is not necessarily scientifict fact that is widely accepted.  Diamond lays out a foundation for the origins of societies, which he does an excellent job of doing, but in relatively recent times, after feudalism in Europe, he does not give enough credit to culture, individual idiosyncrasies, religion, and other such proximate causes derived from ultimate causes.  Read this book for understanding of earlier societies and how they evolved, but do not read it for sweeping generalizations of all societies throughout time, because many of Diamond's assertions are easily contested.
0812550706|5.0|This is without a doubt, the best read I have ever enjoyed.  I finished the book in one sitting the first time.  Three other cover to cover reads since.  I also enjoy randomly opening this book and just start from there. Only Hitchhikers Guide rivals this for pure pleasure.  Thank you for this one Mr. Card!  This book repeatedly transports me into another universe, and I always miss the people in the book each time i put it down.
B0000AI44Q|2.0|What dissapoints me most about this album is not just that it's a mediocre effort by Neil Young, which it is, but rather, that I was once again &quot;burnt&quot; by the so-called reviewers, some of who called this effort &quot;Inspired,&quot; and considered it amoung Young's greatest works.

B00009MGQL|5.0|Just enough of all the things that make Jeff the great player he is. My favorite is still &quot;Jeff Beck's Guitar Shop&quot;, though I have many listens to go before I will be able to absorb all of this. If you are into Jeff this is a must have. If you are into instrumental rock guitar by a true master, this is a must have.

B00009P1O5|4.0|This one never really got the respect it deserved, but in 1981, it was all about the synth (which makes a couple of appearances here, mostly as atmospheric filler amongst the familiar chaos of guitars, drums and bass).<br />It's a big, sludgy mess, of course, which is why it's so delicious. &quot;Opera Star&quot; is hysterically funny, because it's just so damn STOOPID. &quot;Surfer Joe and Moe the Sleaze&quot; carries a serious wallop, a killer riff, and not much more. &quot;T-bone&quot; gets even more granular: one huge riff pounded into oblivion for nine-plus minutes, while Neil laments the fact that he's &quot;got mashed potatoes, ain't got no T-bone&quot; over and over and over. <br />&quot;Get Back On It&quot; isn't gonna make things any harder for you: over one of the most basic of 'oldies rock' structures, Neil and Horse muse on the virtues and pitfalls of getting back on the road.

Oh yes they do, and it's a joy. NOBODY makes looseness sound quite this... uh... loose. It just goes from there. Neil sounds like he's having a total blast on this one. <br />Is it essential Neil Young? Probably not. Neil has written some tremendously insightful, thoughtful songs. He's written some fierce, timeless rock anthems. He's experimented with electronics and bluegrass and old-school country.

This is the 'whoo' thrown off before the solo in 'Cinnamon Girl'. It's just good ol' fashioned blast-in-the-car riffage. Take as needed.
B00009V7PJ|4.0|I must say to the person who commented about Celine. Have you seen her show??? Not just what was on tv but the ENTIRE live show? Until then, you don't know what your talking about. Cher is good but Celine is better in vocal performance! Yes, Cher has great stage presence but I saw the show and it became a bore <BR>I think Cher knows when it is time to end performances. I don't think she will stop singing entirely, just touring around the world!

B000000HSU|3.0|On first listen to the cd issue of this classic Bad Brains album, I was alarmed, perplexed and more than slightly disappointed. There is a clear difference in pitch and speed on several tracks (a fact alluded to in EBlank's review) although I cannot vouch for the entire album being altered in this way as it's been about 10 years since I've had contact with the original vinyl. Also, many reviewers have pointed out the fact that the album has been re-sequenced. Given the fact that \\"Coptic TImes\\" sounds nothing like the \\"original\\" track that opened the vinyl version, I guess it kind of makes sense for the cd to bury it at track 12 and hope that no one notices...<br />But notice I did. Like EBlank, I don't consider myself vinyl retentive: this is hardcore, not Mozart and the quality of a cd re-master doesn't have to be pristine, to my ears at least. (although the Minutemen's \\"Double Nickels\\" is due for a cd overhaul and I've always wondered why Ian decided to do that horrid \\"re-mix\\" job on \\"Out of Step\\" for the cd reissue) \\"Rock For Light\\" is a different story, though. This is clearly not the album I remember hearing.<br />However, listening to the cd the past few days and mulling over just what the heck went wrong with this album-to-cd transfer, I have come to a tenative conclusion: it may be possible that the certain tracks on the original album issue were slowed down by producer Ric Ocasek and other concerned parties in an attempt to make them more palatable to mainstream ears. However, I still can't help but scratch my head over why on earth they would want to do that or even believe that it would actually work! It's a tough call, but I'm willing to give the cd re-issue the benefit of the doubt (by a nose) and resign myself to the idea that what we have here on the cd ARE the songs the way they were recorded and meant to be heard.<br />It would have been nice, though, if Caroline had offered some kind of explanation. I mean, they actually could have spun this thinginto some kind of nifty marketing pitch: \\"Rock For Light: the version the producer didn't want you to hear!\\" or something of the like.<br />What does this all mean to the casual listener? (although there is nothing \\"causual\\" about listening to the Bad Brains) \\"Rock For Light\\" remains the band's best and most confrontational record with the best balance between their all out, blistering hardcore attack, and their reggae leanings. A true classic. Those of you who have heard the \\"original\\" should approach the cd with caution, and those of you who are new to the band should probably pick up \\"Banned In DC\\", an excellent new retrospective, which does the cd re-issue thing the way it should be done
0151006903|4.0|Eco takes us on another journey here but its less literal than his others (or it was for me).  The book is very much a parable for those searching for something (or someone) and offers not answers, but a sounding board for our own journeys through love, work, friendships, parents and life.  I'm not sure if i am the only one who put the book down and felt a bit too much like Baudolino.  In any case if you like Eco's style of &quot;faction&quot; this is a great example of his work, and easier read than his others too.

B00003CXDD|3.0|\\"Willow has everything you could possibly want in a movie: witches, warriors, fantasy, swordfighting, and yes MIDGETS. There is something perverted and sadistic about the concept of Willow. The movie revolves around an entire race of midgets, one of which can bring order out of chaos. God Bless the guy who pitched this movie concept: MIDGET SAVES WORLD IN FREAKY, DISTURBING, THROATY, PHLEGMMY, AND YES, SEXY FASHION. I mean if that's what you're looking for then Willow is the movie for you. And with Val Kilmer adding to this film ..., how could you go wrong. I think this movie would have worked a little better if the Mad Mardigan character kidnapped Willow and made him do whacky things in order to make some money. I don't know, dress him up in a skirt and hit him over the head with a barrel or something mideval like a horse. Now that would have made for a great fantasy film. My biggest problem was that there wasn't the gratuitous midge sex scene. That screams box office smash. Warwick Davis's acting ability can only be compared to Gary Coleman. The one reason that Willow wasn't as memorable as 'Different Strokes' was because it didn't have that money line like \\"What you talking about Willis?\\" Easily remedied with Mad Mardigan , in the middle of his swordfighting, turning around to see Willow waving the stick saying \\"Tu-atha Tu-atha\\" and saying \\"What you talking about Willow?\\" I should have writeen this film. Throw in Conrad BAin and we're talking about an extra mill, easy. In closing if you enjoy watching other peoples shortcomings, no pun intended, then sit back, relax, laugh and watch some crazy, magical, sorcerer midgets run rampant in mideval times. The one thing that made this movie a little too unrealistic was that Ron Howard put midgets in mideval times. Hey Ron, FYI, midgets weren't invented yet! This movie rocks!\\"
0452282152|4.0|When two worlds so completely different in every way collide, there is always a story to be told.  When two people who might has well be from different planets begin to connect with one another, there is undeniably a lesson to be learned out of the chaos that they have caused.  Griet never knew what she had until she lost it.  One day her family is a normal family, and the next she is thrust into a painter's world were she is forced to become a maid.  As you read and you travel into her new life, you find that you aren't so different from her at all.  In life you must do what you can, do what you must, and try to do all that you want to do.  Sometimes you get what life gives you, but sometimes you have to make life give you what you want.<br />The author of the novel, Tracy Chevalier took a real artist of the late 1600's and formed a tangled web of trust, betrayal, love, hate, scandal, and overall turmoil from one painting which is the books namesake, The Girl With the Pearl Earring.  When Griet's father has an accident and is left blind and without his job, Griet must help her family financially by becoming the well-known painter, Vermeer's, maid.  Vermeer's family is already indebt and can scarcely afford to pay for all their many children, little alone pay Griet a very small amount of a maid's wages.  Somehow the money is stretched, because Vermeer's wife wishes to have many children and many servants.  The irony of this is that it's Vermeer's wife who later comes to hate Griet. <br />It's Griet who turns a lot of men's heads, and thus causes many women in the men's lives to dislike her.  Not only does she fully gain the butcher's son's attention, but Vermeer's most supportive patron and later Vermeer himself.  Griet and Vermeer are from two different classes, and in those days, that might as well have meant a different species.  There is an unspoken form of love that grows between Griet and Vermeer, but the reader never knows what's truly there.  Griet must decide how to handle what life is given her, but most importantly she must learn who she is.  Griet must, like we all must, decide which path to take.  Though the novel is told in first person, even the reader sometimes wonders what Griet thinks of it all, and it isn't until the very end that her decisions are unraveled.<br />Sometimes the hardest decision we ever have to make is who we really are and who we wish to become.  Once we open our eyes and see ourselves for who we really are, everything else seems to fall in place.  Tracy Chevalier allows us to see one young woman's inner struggle with herself.  We all have to choose who we want to be and who we want to be with.  Like Griet experienced, life hands you a certain number of choices.  You simply have to hope they you choose the best one. <br />This book is best for teenage girls who are interested in romance and historical fiction.  The reader of the book will discover who Griet is as she discovers herself, and perhaps even reveal a little more about themselves.  A book can never be a failure if it makes the reader unveil at least a little about themselves or the people around them.
B0000C3I6U|4.0|I've still got my old Rhino Video VHS copy of this little gem from about 10 years ago and waited anxiously for this DVD.  Required viewing for true Arnold fans (or any bodybuilding or fitness buff), Pumping Iron delivers the goods.  The accent is much heavier back then, but Arnold's focus on the future and underlying determination to be the best are very evident.  <br />Subtley egotistical and always charming in a kooky sort of way, Arnold is the centerpiece for bodybuilding's groundbreaking expose'.  The old-school bodybuilders are all here: Franco Columbo, Lou Ferrigno, Ed Corney, et. al.  This was a time when 6'2\\" and 240 lbs of lean muscle was a crowd-stopper, unlike today's 5'10 and 300+ lbs freak shows.  All athletes sacrifice greatly to achieve their status, but this was the heyday of the sport in my opinion.  You'll watch these legends prepare for Mr. Universe and Olympia, go through their triumphs and failures, gain personal insights to their life philosphies, all the while enduring bad mid-70's music, horrendous fashion and attrocious hairstyles!  In spite of it all, a very inspiring flick for any would-be bodybuilder.

Nix' characters grab you and hold you there until the last page and I couldn't wait for the release of the others.  I missed much sleeping reading this and the previous two...  He is a breath of fresh air in the fighting and quest genre it is hard to find something new and non formulaic.  This is the one if you love the darker edges of fantasy.
1573229725|5.0|This book was amazingly well developed. The main characters Maud and Susan are strangers at first but by the end of the book, were more related than anyone could ever have imagined. There were so many twists in this book, you could never guess what was going to happen next. Waters describes life in england so beautifully that you could imagine seeing it right in front of you. Although both girls go through a lot, they both get through it because of their love for one another. Love, lust, murder, mystery, excitement,passion, fear and thrill were all involved in this book. i would highly recommend this to anyone.It has so much in this book, that it has alittle of every genre so everyone would love this book as much as i did.
B00005JKZV|4.0|This film is an Epic film in its own right, the script the scenery, the special effects (gollum is absolutely marvellously done and its a crime it didnt get the oscar).<BR>I enjoyed this movie immensely, but felt rather sad that Mr Jackson felt the need to add his 'personal touch'.<BR>The first movie in this trilogy was brilliantly done, we got to know the characters in depth and even though it strayed oft from the exactness of the first book it really did so out of necessity (as most audiences would have fallen asleep 30 minutes into the movie if it had kept to the book).<BR>However, the second book needed no enhancements (except maybe some humour, in which Jackson neatly introduced the fast growing friendship of Gimli and Legolas as such). But the elves at helms deep just blew it for me, the legends of the \\"last alliance of elves and men\\" just got thrown out the window, Jackson destroyed the feeling if middle-earthness within the movie. It left a sour taste in my mouth.<BR>But having said that, im still buying it the day it comes out as it is still a wonderful movie to behold. I just hope Jackson gets back on track with the final movie as there really is no need for any deviation at all, as the last book is packed full of action to a point where most who read it consider it should have been twice the size.
B00005K3NR|3.0|Carrie is admittedly a stylishly done (on what was apparently a slim budget) adaptation of the eponymous King novel.<br />Sissy Spacek turns in a very credible performance as the teenage Carrie White who has never had a good day at school, and the high school bullies who taunt her are amusing twits. This whole rigmarole of a kook's daughter reaching out to her paranormal capabilities is actually quite worth a watch if you are into this genre -- and no, it's not your blood dripping Living Dead type horror if that's what you were worried about.<br />But the denouement is a bit overboard. Amazon's reviews call it an \\"immemorable finale\\", but a harrowing high school holocaust (in split-screen, apparently mildly tongue in cheek) was frankly a bit uncalled for. By this point much of the film's wit and taste had quickly faded away anyway, so I guess it shouldn't have made much of a difference.<br />Worth a watch? Definitely, this is one of the better horror movies. A masterpiece? No, by any stretch of imagination.

B00009RDG9|3.0|I waited anxiously to see this movie, mostly<BR>because I'm a fan of B. Del Toro.  It was a <BR>&quot;good film&quot;; 3.5 stars would be a more accurate<BR>rating.  As for some who think its one of the<BR>&quot;best movies of the year&quot;, that makes me think<BR>they didn't have very high expectations for the<BR>year!  <BR>The action was great, the acting was great (I actually<BR>think Tommy Lee did at least as good a job as DelToro).<BR>What totally prevents this from achieving anything other<BR>that a slightly better than mediocre status is that though we<BR>do get a fairly solid handle on the relationship between<BR>the two actors, we aren't brought into a deeper awareness<BR>of Toro's dilemma.  He's special ops. he snaps. period.<BR>His mentor goes after him (the chase and the combat are<BR>excellent!) and that's the whole story.<BR>Really, I think that a lot was missing here - a story<BR>like this 'could' have more depth in characterization<BR>and the fact that they leave this as more action-driven <BR>makes me think the creative team behind the film didn't <BR>aspire to a 'great' story so much as they relied on the <BR>strengths of their leads.  A more compelling story<BR>would have made this movie a four-star at least.<BR>Worth seeing? Yes!
B00005QFHG|5.0|this movie is wonderful! it has a great story and the actors and actresses played awesome parts. juliet binoche and johnny depp have great chemistry and judi dench makes a stellar performance. the music, setting, plot, and script are superb. this is definitely a movie to own. so sit down, grab your favorite type of chocolate, and watch a great movie!
0783226063|5.0|Man, I can't believe the complaints this classy<BR>film gets from all the pansy Uber-Dune \\"fans\\" - <BR>and it is very disappointing to hear that Lynch himself <BR>wishes he hadn't made the movie (!?).  I feel bad when an<BR>artist looses faith in his great own work...especially when<BR>Herbert was himself present to be part of the FIRST<BR>realization of his books on the screen!  A presence<BR>sorely lacking and obvious in the more recent efforts.<br />Lynch's movie always held a grand vision<BR>of the series for me.  To gripe about how it<BR>missed all the details (as if the movie adaptation<BR>wouldn't have to be days long to convey on screen!!)<BR>is to simply fail to enjoy what was delivered. <BR>The movie should be given top marks for what it<BR>did accomplish, which was a lot!<BR>The later Dune stories - which I admit I \\"enjoy\\" -<BR>lack the atmosphere and superior acting/actors which<BR>graced Lynch's film.  He used REAL desert scenes<BR>and provided a visual feel which made me feel like<BR>I was in Herbert's book!  I give props to anyone<BR>who wishes to continue to get their own vision of the<BR>books on screen - but I feel that all the whiners who<BR>pooh-pooh Lynch have simply missed his movie's qualities,<BR>all in favor of these later 'extended' but under-budgeted<BR>attempts.  What do the newer versions lack??? SPICE!!!<BR>The \\"spice\\" you had in spades from the contributions of Sting,<BR>Kyle MacLachlan etc etc.  You guys just wish someone as <BR>dynamic and captivating as Sting had graced these new movies;<br />instead there is no tension, no sense of maniacal evil that<BR>put the edge on Lynch's version.  Watching the new movies<BR>is `nice' but the blood never gets going.<BR>The problems with die-hard \\"fans\\" is that they dissect and niddle over<BR>details until all the blood is gone from something and it's just kind of<BR>pathetic.
6302548195|5.0|Here's a collector's item.  This is Lou ferringno, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Franco Columbu in their young weight-lifting prime before they became professional actors.  Lou Ferrigno was 23 years of age.  Of course he went on to do the CBS tv series \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" (1978-1982) and recently had made appearances on the CBS tv series \\"King of Queens\\" and made a cameo appearance in the film HULK (2003).  This is an interesting time because the DVD version of \\"Pumping Iron\\" will be released soon.  Arnold Schwarzenegger has been an actor since 1970, but body building championships has been his passion.  Still a highly respected actor, Mr. Schwarzenegger is now running as a candidate for Governor of California.  (He won! Arnold Schwarzenegger became the 38th Governor of California)  Arnold Schwarzenegger was at the age of 28 mostly during \\"Pumping Iron\\".  Frank Columbu was a good friend of Arnold's.  In the film, Columbu was the age of 34.  He also become an actor.  The film starts wth Franco and Arnold learning ballet so they can learn graceful poising to use when they compete on stage for the championships.  Then it's July 29, 1975, 102 days until the Mr. Olympia Championship.  Arnold Schwarzenegger is working out at Gold's Gym to win the championship title again.  That is what this film is all about.  A documentary of Lou Ferrigno, Arnold S. and Franco Columbu and other men seriously working out to the big day, how to gain muscle and pose, and other personal thoughts.  Inspiring film.  This VHS version runs 87 minutes.<br />  Note: The re-release version of this film was heavily-edited down after Arnold Schwarzenegger became Governor of California.
B0000A36J5|5.0|Having read the entire Lord of the rings tril. including many of Tolkiens other works, I must say this movie is truely awsome. I am on many peoples side in saying \\"Hey! That never happened in the book!\\" or \\"Wow! That was totally messed up!\\" but I must agree some of the changes made were for the BETTER! When i say better I don't mean take Gimli's axe an hack up Tolkien's work, but I mean it is for the better of the movie. Tolkien didn't get as into the love story as the movie did, granted, but the love story makes it more appealing for a large audiance. Now people can root for Aragorn cleaving off an Uruk Hai head as much as they can root for him to marry Arwen.<BR>  Also, I have heard it so many times my head is going to explode. yes we know the elves didn't go to Helm's Deep. And that is perfect for the book, but when you see 10,000 Uruk Hai marching to Helm's Deep and 300 rohan soldiers, which a large portion is old men and children, you gotta wonder how are they ever going to pull this off? Petter Jackson made a good move in my oppion in making the elves go to Helm's Deep for two reasons. I think the non-reader would actually be saying \\"How did 300 soldiers hold off those Uruk Hai like that?\\" Rohan needed help, and in order to make the survial look possible, those elves were needed. Also, a overwhelming majority of people love elves, so what better a way that to show them fight at Helm's Deep, looking crisp and ready for action! I believe that Peter Jackson made a smart move there. <BR>  i will say this though, Aragorn falling off the cliff? That was....weird. On a more comic note, imagine waking up to his horse? Scary huh? But the whole falling off the cliff made it possible to explore the love a little more. Because in the book, it kind of seemed the love theme was diffently out of it, and sort of appeared out of no where in return of the king. <BR>   Overall I rate this movie very highly and recommend it to anyone. It is hard to juggle waiting till Novemeber to get the special edition or buying the one released. So I say go for the special edition and borrow the one released from a friend.

YES it is nice to know that Scarface is going to come out on DVD soon, but do I HAVE TO WATCH THAT EVERY SINGLE TIME I PUT IN MY MOVIE?????  If it really were a collectors edition, it would just be the movie and NOTHING else but the movie.  There is only one FIX for this is to push fastforward up to 16x. Luckily I found that out, because don't even think of pushing the MENU key, or SKIP key because they won't work.  <br />Its sad they have to mar our films like this.  <br />I would still recommend this Title though, because its just so funny and the movie itself is so great.  No use waiting til they have one without any stupid previews in the beginning, cuz it won't happen.

B00009V7PJ|5.0|This concert DVD is awesome. Performance are Excellent, Her Staff/ Dancers and performers are just great (they all work well together). Plus the extra fottage and interviews really show the humanside (non celebrity) side to Cher. She is the Best Diva of all times. I strongly recommend this DVD to everyone. 5 stars all the way if there were more I would give her 40 one for each year she has been performing!
0345409671|5.0|Anne Rice gives us exactly what we need after the previous book in the series (Tale of the Body Thief). Deep textures and rich prose yields a wildly emotional novel that takes us from Heaven to Hell. Memnoch the Devil gives us more of the intricate storytelling that was so prevalent in The Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Dammed but sadly missing in Tale of the Body Thief. As of now, this is my favorite novel in the series. The only disappointment is that we don't really learn more about Lestat (whom I love).

B00009UW0N|2.0|Were this a review solely on the film, this would have rated a one star. The transfer has been altered, with blues and oranges washed out. Along with that, it is the theatrical version of the film. Nit picking maybe, but you would think a 25th anniversary edition would have warrented the film being presented in its full glory.<br />The bonus features are basically the only reason to buy this DVD. You can't ask for anything more from the commentary and excellent documentary. Just too bad Artisan couldn't make this a real treat for the fans.
B0000524CY|5.0|While \\"The Exorcist: 25th Anniversary Special Edition\\" DVD presents the original and definitive cut of the film (and contains the indispensable 74 minute BBC documentary \\"Fear of God\\"), the new expanded version adds some deleted scenes and digital retouches that provide an alternate version that Exorcist buffs will want to own as well.  Some restored scenes truly flesh out the storyline (\\"first doctor visit\\") while others function more like a bonus track would on a classic album CD reissue (neat, but don't really belong in the original song sequence; \\"spider-walk\\").  The expanded ending changes the tone and mood of the film and the digital retouches add some more subliminal Easter eggs.  No matter how you feel about the 2000 re-release, since it was billed as a separate version, \\"The Version You've Never Seen,\\" there is nothing to really get upset about.  Nobody is re-writing film history here, just giving a different vision of it.
0312955006|5.0|As I'm moving along through the series, this is the best book so far. I'm told by friends that this is where the series gets very good.<br />This book was the perfect blend of courtroom drama and murder-mystery suspense. That's what made this book so good. When one part of the story was moving a little slower, the other picked up pace. It fit perfectly. Also, the book keeps you guessing until the very end. It's fun to go on that journey with the cops and see where it leads you. Bonus when it's a surprise ending.<br />I think by this book the characters are getting fine tuned, and the author is finding his groove. I'm very excited to start the next book and see what it brings me.
0596000480|4.0|If you're looking for a complete reference on the JavaScript programming language, this is it.  This book teaches the JavaScript language from the ground up and includes a very complete reference section.<br />On the other hand, if all you want is to write or understand JavaScript in its most common use - providing a little more dynamic content in web pages than can be done with html alone - the book may be overkill.  For example, in addition to the useful sections on client side JavaScript - the JavaScript that you include in your web pages to be run in the client's browser - there are even larger sections that are really only useful for server side JavaScript - as if anyone uses JavaScript on the server side.  As an experienced C, C++, and Java programmer, I had to wade through quite a bit of redundant material before I could effectively use the book to answer the simple questions I had.<br />In addition, some critical issues about using client side JavaScript are omitted from the book.  For example, there is a chapter on security, but it only covers security issues applicable to the user - that with modern browsers, it's pretty safe for the user to allow JavaScripts to run.  Issues pertaining to the security of the web site and the server it runs on - far more important to someone writing JavaScript code - are omitted.  The book even provides a very unsafe example of allowing a client side script to calculate sales tax, which if used would make it easy for someone to tell your site he owed less tax than he really did, leaving the website owner holding the bag.  It would have been better to include these server security issues and omit the client security issues.<br />Still, this book will let you find the answers to your questions, even if it does take longer than it seems like it should.

B00009APK1|5.0|oFF ALL three films that tell of The Lord of the Rings story, this one may be the greatist. Excellent casting, Excellent acting, excellnnt dialog. Peter Jackson has blown us away again, proving he has the best attributes of Spielberg and Lucus combined. Although he didn't write the story, this film adaption was a massive undertaking that could not have been better without sacrificing some of it's on screen perfectiom.<br />So far, the best adaptation to date, and one of the greatist films made.
0471413909|2.0|I'm very interested in natural nutrition, but I was a bit disappointed with this book. There are so many &quot;musts&quot; in it. It's not true that everything invented after the stone age is not healthy for us. I live in Sweden and we drink lots of milk and digest it well. Some low fat milk promotes a good health, I think. The author also says &quot;Absolutely no peanuts&quot;. Well, I read in the paper today that a substance found in grapes, peanuts and other vegetables is likely to extend your life span and slow down aging. And in Asia they do well on eating lots of soy bean products.<br />How old did they get back then? I've heard they had an average life span of 40 years. Was that only because they had no doctors or could their diet have been less than perfect after all? And I wonder why the Japanese, who eat a lot of rice, and Swedes, who eat a lot of milk and rye bread, become twice as old in average.<br />Italians get old too, and they eat a lot of pasta.<br />But I've learned at least one thing from the book: Eat more protein. I've started to eat more fresh fish and vegetables and I feel really fine. I already seem to need less sleep. I've  tried to cut down on pasta, white bread and sugar for a long time, but the book encourages me to go on doing so. (My teeth like the new diet too. If you are strict with it you could almost skip tooth brushing!)<br />I agree that wheat, corn etc and products thereof are not nutritious. Too much energy, too little nutrients. But you don't have to skip it altogether!<br />Read the book, it has some good points. But please don't forget to use common sense. We can of course use some farm products and still be perfectly healthy and have long lives. We can have the best of both worlds. Why not listen to your stomach? Only your stomach can tell you what foods you digest well. No book can do that. Your stomach is a good, personal guide.
B00005JLXE|2.0|Daredevil is the worst comic to screen adaption since Batman Forever. Lots of high dollar effects, disconnected characters that we can not connect with and a city that feels like a rehash Gotham from one of the Batman movies of the 90's. It's just that bad. Also the their's a upsetting mid-movie event (won't spoil it for those who must see this) that leaves little hope for the ending..
B00005JMFR|5.0|I saw the first matrix and I was like \\"whoa\\" now that was tight.Then I saw matix reloaded and I was like was like I wanna stay and watch it again.Matrix 3 hasnt come out yet but im pretty sure Im gonna be like wow when is this on dvd cause when it comes out that suckers mine.If you watch matrix 2 all the way through ....even the credits you get to see a preview of matrix 3 and that blows me away.I heard all you talking about amatrix within a matrix and you get me confused.Although matrix 2 got me confused if neo was still plugged into the matrix if the sentinels died how come neo didnt die .....could he possibly,truly be the one if he is I can understand if hes still alive.I think that niobes crew set off an EMP and destroyed the sentinels...but how could neo live.....I dont know.Maybe what wasnt shown was neo getting unplugged from the matrix.Was he in the real world.....I dont really know.All I know is that matrix 3 is gonna ROCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00006AW2J|5.0|Just to clarify, ALL of the ABKCO releases of the Stone's albums are stereo SACD, NOT multichannel.  I have noticed many older rock recordings are released in stereo only; a multichannel version may follow but usually doesn't.  Take for example the Police SACD collection, which is entirely stereo except for the &quot;Every Breath You Take - The Singles&quot; multichannel SACD.  Multichannel is an exciting possibility, but I am more than happy with a pristine SACD stereo version.  After all, that is how these albums were recorded in the first place.  Only thick,  highly textured albums like Floyd's &quot;Dark Side of The Moon&quot; truly deserve the multichannel treatment.<BR>Either way, if you are a true Stone's fan and into SACD, do not hesitate to buy this essential album.
B00008LDPU|5.0|I was blown away by this one.  I passed over it many a time in the video store.  It was fantastic.  It does reveal some depth and insight to The Matrix story but this one almost stands alone.  The interviews uncover just how the directors of The Matrix have been influenced by Japanese anime.  The brief history of anime and its intertwining with Japanese culture is quite an interesting sidebar.  It ain't just for kids anymore.  <br />It's got a bumping soundtrack and it is visually stylish.  Some of the stories are more relevant than others to the original film but overall the animation, the music and the flow are fantastic.  <br />As for its connection to The Matrix, several of the clips are definitely attached to adding some details to lingering questions from The Matrix.  I suppose I was tremendously excited when some of my questions were answered by one of the cartoons included here.  Some of the other stories have a thread that connects them to the movie but most of them are really a world unto themselves.  <br />If you liked the original film, you'll definitely want to check this one out.  If you love animation, you'll also want to check this one out.  There's a historical thread to it that may come as a surprise.  As a kid I used to watch Speed Racer and G-Force.  Anime has come a long, long way.
B00005JKC3|2.0|This movie is [weak]. I dont care what anyone says,it was really [weak].Ang Lee spent so much time on making the Hulk look real that he forgot the rest of the movie.True,the Hulk looked amazing,but theres no excuse for this wanna be action flick.And what was up with the comic book like panels on the screen?They were just plain annoying.Phsycological issues? Yeah right.I was having severe phsychological issues once I left the theatre.[Weak] action,(the most exciting part was when the Hulk got attacked by ... poodles)boring scenery(all desert or military complex)and did I mention [weak] action? Lets just hope there isnt a sequel.
B00006JKON|4.0|After reading several other customer reviews and realizing how discrepant they were, I decided to write my own review.    I became an enthusiastic Tull fan overnight when I saw them live in 1971 ( the same year they released Aqualung = it was a great concert! ), and while War Child does not quite measure up to Aqualung or Thick As A Brick (two 5 star albums), it is a very creative bridge to the next series of great albums -- Minstrel In The Gallery (my favorite Tull album), Songs From the Wood, and Heavy Horses. War Child contains some classic Tull songs: the title track, Skating away, Solitaire, Ladys in Waiting, and The Third Hoorah, which is trashed in some of the other reviews.  War Child also successfully captures Tull's playful Monty Pythonesque humor (Anderson's really) in full form, and I enjoyed Tull's return to conventional song lengths after the excess of Passion Play.  Getting a remastered sound and \\"bonus tracks\\" makes this purchase a no brainer for a Tull fan.
0684135051|5.0|I've been knitting for years, but was a slave to other people's patterns.  Elizabeth Zimmerman freed me from all that.  Her book is empowering in that it explains how to make sweaters quickly and in the simplest possible way - on circular needles from the bottom up, essentially without a whole lot of directions except for how to ensure excellent fit.  I will never again make a pullover on flat needles and have to sew a front and back together.  Nor will I spend a lot of time knitting on the wrong side - suddenly there are no wrong sides any longer!  Her means of avoiding seams is brilliant, and the results are elegant.  She writes clearly, zestfully and with relish - something unusual among knitting writers.  And she's delightfully opinionated.  Mme. Zimmerman is someone whom every doubting knitter would love to have on hand to give help!
B0000AI44Q|5.0|Aging like ... Neil Young, that is ....<br />Neil Young &amp; Crazy Horse sound exceptional on this powerful, creative work. Young's creation of a story around a fictional town, &quot;Greendale,&quot; is a masterful stroke, giving this legendary artist the format to enlighten us about (to 'slip in' lines here and there) his thinking on a host of issues ... all timely and relevant. The inclusion of the DVD is wonderful. It is a full length, solo Young concert in which he explains &quot;Greendale&quot; in great detail, in a way that helps the listener appreciate and understand the man and his purposeful creation all the more. And, indeed, &quot;the Horse&quot; has rarely jammed finer!
B00003CXA2|1.0|Well, I guess it's nice to have a movie for all the rainbow and unicorn loving cat ladies to be in love with. Me? I'd rather watch paint dry.
B000067IZ3|5.0|I don't really know why people insist that the film is about drug trade! I think the film is about humans and their hopes and defects: A very powerful man with no weapon to protect his daughter, a nouveau-rich hot shot who is suddenly in jail, a spoon fed beauty running for money and a superb policeman hoping to provide something for the childhood.<br />The way the film has been &quot;woven&quot; is pretty rare in the new films (it looks like the well-made movies we use to see in the 60's and 70s), and the hazy impression of a fine movie by its humanity (and not graphic) may remind us that Hollywood is still in good shape.<br />A salute to Michael Douglas for taking one step back offering the axial role for Benicio Del Toro: I don't think that anyone else could represent the 3rd world pure and simple man looking for fairness as he did.<br />The characters and the stories of the movie could make at least 3 successful movies; this is in case you would not consider the amazing shooting on Mexico, who could be considered as a masterpiece on its own and a fourth successful movie.<br />It doesn't really matter what is your interest in movies, whether it is the gender, the directors, the stars or simply the entertainment; you should see the movie and considered as a reference (it will make you very picky).
B00009RDG9|5.0|I'm not fooling myself into believing that this film is anything more than &quot;First Blood&quot; with a brain.  Substitute Sylvester Stallone with a MUCH MUCH MUCH better actor, Col. Troutman with cinema's other great Tommy Lee. and Brian Denehy's red neck posse with the FBI and a covert Sweeper team and you have &quot;The HUnted&quot;.  That said, this is an unbelievably good film.<br />  Like &quot;First Blood&quot; this movie is all about knives...not nifty ones with blades twelve feet long with handy hollow handels filled with fishing line, sewing kits, portable toasters, an electric blanket, and a nose-hair trimmer..no these are real functional knives.  combat knives wrought from raw steel or a chunk of flint.  Furthermore they are about the men who weild them: The troubled and possibly paranoid trained killer, and the man who trained him.<br />  DOn't forget the Johnny Cash music.<br />The opening battle scene is as gritty and distubingly realistic as anything I've seen, and the one-on-one fights are absolutely plausible and true.  No one is being hoisted by a winch, pulled on wires, or being filmed by ninety cameras to provide nifty 360 views...this is BETTER.<br /> Just when we were on the verge of forhetting what the real world looks like a film like &quot;The Hunted&quot; saves us for an hour or so.
B000005RQ0|4.0|\\"Lovehunter\\" opens with the groovy blues-rock of \\"Long Way From Home\\", and the classic, swaggering \\"Walking In The Shadow Of The Blues\\" - perhaps David Coverdale's best composition, and certainly one of his best and most mature lyrics.    Other highlights include the foot-stomping \\"Rock 'N' Roll Women\\", which is precisely as clichéd as it sounds, and the supremely funky title track, which features some fiery slide guitar from Mickey Moody. And \\"You 'N' Me\\" is a pretty solid rocker as well.    There are too many mediocre songs for \\"Lovehunter\\" to be a great album, but it's still a pretty good one. A fine purchase for fans of Whitesnake's earlier material...and good enough for some 3½ stars. Get this one and the equally inconsistent \\"Come an' Get It\\" and you can make one hell on a CD out of those two!
078322804X|4.0|The Blues Brothers served as my introduction to the Blues.  Sure it's a little pathetic, but ask any small town White boy blues fan under the age of 30, and you'll be suprised how many of us share the same memory.  Jake and Elwood are a pair of somewhat criminal, blues musicians on a mission from God to raise money to save an orphanage while simultaneously trying to not be killed by a jilted Carrie Fisher.<br />  OK Forget the plot...the fact is that this movie is fun.  It has cameos by everyone from Boom Boom John Lee Hooker to Jelly Legs James Brown.  Let us not understate that this is the only SAT. Night Live skit-to-movie that works.  Where Wayne's World is Marginally watchable, this one is genuinely funny.  Every other example should pulled from their respective canisters and burned in a huge public ceremony immeditely after being used to hang everyone involved in their production (and perhaps knotted in order to provide Chevy Chase with a brutal flogging)<br />  In other words this film is worth owning.  It makes you want to be a Blues Man.  Really, what more can you ask from a movie?
B00005JKDR|2.0|Am I the only one that's sick of the same damn characters in every Pixar film? How many times do we have to be subjected to the Mike Wazowski character? Come on! Plucky, wise-cracking, comedy-relief of a side-kick. As for the rest? Be sure to expect a round of cliches bottled off with some contrived \\"twists\\", and a really moronic plot (Kid's screams? How long did it take to think THAT wild idea up? Morons). There's no wit, little is funny, characters are not even close to being engaging or interesting... Pixar used up all their steam with their other 3 classics (Toy Story, Toy Story 2 and A Bug's Life)... it's no wonder this mess is void of any intelligence.<br />Finding Nemo looks equally bad.
0385504209|4.0|I found this to be a good book and while I have not changed my views on the interpretation of catholicism, history or christianity, it sparked some questions and made for some interesting conversations.  The quest for the Holy Grail in this book was intriguing to read.<br />Any book that inspires me to do a little research online is well worth the time to me.
B00006RCPM|5.0|Minority Report is by far the most potent, intelligent, and provocative sci-fi thriller I have ever seen. Tom Cruise stars in this riveting masterpiece, giving a vivid and realistic portrayal of his character, as do all the actors in their individual roles. The storyline is extremely well-developed, and the characters as well are well-developed and well-portrayed. And the chilling depiction of the far future is realistic as well. It is a mind-blowing action-packed masterpiece.<br />The storyline concerns a six year-old unit of astounding technology headquartered in Washington DC which identifies the culprits of future murders. Thus, the officers of the Precrime Unit can detain killers before they commit their crimes.<BR>When the chief of Precrime (Tom Cruise) is himself identified as a future murderer, he finds himself in a desperate race against time to find out whether or not he has been set up by a hacker. He must discover the truth behind his revealed future before he falls prey to the system he created. <br />In my opinion, Minority Report exceeds most other films in the sci-fi genre. It is perfect in every way. Even the choreography is noticeably excellent. I strongly reccomend this film to anyone. You will not regret seeing it. 5 stars. Rated PG-13 for violence, brief language, some sexuality, and drug content.
B000002KCC|5.0|I originally owned this...on the good ol' 33 1/3 rpm version..and of course never had a sound system worth a pinch of...well you know...to play it on but now I can listen to this magical piece of music in all its slendor. These pieces rock....I mean I can time travel with this playing. I suppose tho..this is not for the new Neil Young listener..or the person looking for another &quot;Harvest&quot;. The sound is utterly raw and unforgiving...but thats what makes it a true gem. This is Neil at his most gutteral...right where the fingernails meet the concrete. I remember when I first heard &quot;Borrowed Tune&quot;....on a local radio station....late at nite...kinda scorched...and thinkin...man I gotta own this album. Well I did...and now I have the CD...and a decent sound system.....and life is indeed good.
B00005JKZV|3.0|Thank you so very much Mr. jackson for covoluting a wonderful piece of litterary work. You have shown us yet again (ie. The Fellowship of the Ring) that you are indeed hollywood's best friend. Have fun on your shire hill of money (traitor).............
B00007G207|5.0|Like most avid lovers of this film, I saw it (and repeatedly viewed it) in the original version, and that version remains one of my favorite movies of all time - I never tire of watching it - or at least my favorite scenes from it. The music is unforgettable - not only Ennio Morricone's greatest score but one of the best soundtracks ever.  But like most others, I waited years to see the 50 minutes or so that had been deleted from the original release. The questions left unanswered (about Elena's disappearance) by the original were just too haunting...  The new version answers those questions - and in some ways, unexpectedly. The first time I saw the new version - the seamless brilliance of the original seemed to lose power...but on repeated viewing, this effect diminishes...one begins to appreciate the director's original intent.  Yes, some tawdry sex scenes seem to diminish the lovability of the original's characters. But that is a superficial criticism. In fact, the new version adds reality to the (slight) 'romanticized' excess of the original. Who hasn't been tempted into some tawdry sexual exploration, even though remaining a fundamentally decent person?  Both versions remain indispensable, but the shorter original has a magic that is just that bit better.
B00003CXXM|4.0|...and that's how I took it. It doesn't follow the book, just the book's concept and that was the intention all along. Doug Liman has an interesting style of cinematic framing and use of both mounted and handheld cameras. This film has action without gratuitous violence and intamacy between hero and heroine without being explicit. There's even a worthy car chase (IMHO) featuring an original style Mini-Cooper done well before the IJ remake's release.<br />Part of smart movie-making is leaving something for the audience's imagination and Liman does this  However, the director can't do it alone so don't forget to make note of the editor's work too-some beautiful expanses of edited time I found preferable to the spectalcle of &quot;Bullet-time&quot;.<br />The directing, filming, and editing may harken back to earlier days but it employs some of those methods without being old-fashioned. It's mostly for these reasons that I enjoyed this production.
B000089RVX|5.0|This CD is amazing. I really just bought it as I loved the tracks Going Under and Bring Me to Life from the videos I have seen. Amy's voice is just haunting, theatrical, beautiful and powerful all wrapped into one! I love the gothic sound and the variety of hard/soft tunes it includes. Each song has it's own personality and I have grown fond of the beautiful ballads like Hello and My Immortal. I wish there were more of those on it. Yet you can still rock to the rest of the tunes. It's nice to see some lyrics about God that could easily be played on mainstream radio if given a chance! Like the Tourniquet song. I think this band has a very bright future and its about time we had more variety on the airwaves instead of the carbon copy stuff with little substance. This band has just gained a loyal fan.
B000007S5B|5.0|When the third Doors album, Waiting for the Sun,&quot; (not to be confused with the song of the same name found on their later album, Morrison Hotel), was released, it was immediately dismissed as a flawed album, not as good as the first two, good but not great Doors. However, opinions sometimes change over time, and it is time to reexamine this excellent work. Critics have said this is a &quot;soft&quot; album. It is true that on first listen, many songs do sound mellower, like a gentle, peaceful pond. But, anyone who knows anything about wildlife realized that under the smooth surface of a pond lies a seething morass of activity. The &quot;mellow&quot; numbers on this album are very similar in nature. &quot;Summers Almost Gone,&quot; in particular, is full of haunting melancholy (not to mention great interplay between Robbie Krieger on guitar and Ray Manzarak on piano instead of the usual organ). &quot;Yes, the River Knows&quot; (more great guitar work by Robbie) features an unusual vocal performance of restrained passion by singer Jim Morrison. Of course, there are still great theatrical (&quot;Not to Touch the Earth,&quot; part of Jim's great Celebration of the Lizard poem) and political (&quot;Five to One&quot;) performances that show the band's great passion for personalizing profound observations. Remember, the name of this band is The Doors, and this album proves that they are always searching the doorways of the universe. Great students of philosophy, they realize that for every loud, proud yang (&quot;Hello, I Love You&quot;) in a human's life, there is also a softer, but no less intense yin (&quot;Wintertime Love,&quot; whose brevity reminds us that even the best seasons must end). Please get this album and listen to it several times. You might just change your mind.
B00005JLTM|1.0|I agree with those who were disappointed with Matrix Reloaded and its lack of plot. I didn't expect to like the original but I really did. I did expect to like this sequel and I really didn't. Matrix had a message. It was inventive and captured the imagination. Reloaded retained none of the original spark. All I can remember about it is agents multiplying and machines marching to take over.  Will the machines conquer all in the end? I seriously doubt it. I also doubt that I will bother to find out.
B000092ZYX|4.0|Radiohead, as a band, clearly have a mission. To unequivocally prove to the world, that they are the most creative and original band of their generation. Well, in that case, `Mission accomplished boys'. Tom and the guys give us another master piece which is head to toes full of colossal music, impeccable production and deeply meaningful lyrics. <br />My favourite tracks from `Hail To The Thief' are the very boundaries of the album. Track 01, `2+2=5' and the closing tracks of the album `Scatterbrain'<BR>and `A Wolf at the Door'. How does this album compare to their previous ones? Well, it's not quite anything like `Kid A', but on the other hand it's nothing like `The Bends' either. Most probably, it's somewhere in between. Some critics have said that Radiohead are completely mixed up and that they have completely lost their direction. Well, even if this were to be true, I couldn't be bothered, since, the result is top notch quality.<BR> <BR>I miss the old Radiohead, I really do. The seminal `OK Computer' and `The Bends' have earned them a place in Rock History. That's why I'm giving this one 4-stars and not 5. Its great, but, it is not as ground-breaking as the above mentioned two.  However, this album, still deserves to be bought. Thumbs up for Radiohead's number 6 studio album. Hail to Radiohead.
B00005JKC3|1.0|this movie is so mindless there is no plot,acting, or anything. Here is a cuople reasons why this movie is so stupid. 1.they portray the army as really tuff guys not afraid of any thing not eben the Hulk especialy Betty's dad. 2.When the hulk hits the helcopters and there doing a bunch of three-sixtys the guys in side are crying out mayday mayday. 3. the army just starts attacking the Hulk in the city and they dont even warn anybody. 4. It doesnt matter if your the Hulk or not if you fall 15,000 into water your going to die especaily if you land on your back like he did. There are a lot more flaws about this movie but I dont have time to say them.
B00006CXXU|5.0|First thing, I have to admit that i wasn't always an XTINA fan.. but this cd has changed me (seriously) and has made Christina THE GREAT ONE (that's what i always call her now). Her talent is so unbelievable and sooo beautiful. She's truly an awesome human being and has such incredible inner strength. That's what makes this album the only cd i've listened to for the last 8 months. Her songs Fighter, Beautiful, Soar, The voice within, and keep on singin' my song have taught me to be strong and to hold my ground no matter what. The world can be pretty cruel sometimes, but this has showed me that being yourself (when no one else approves or whatever other situation you're going through) is the most rewarding thing in the world. I truly feel that every parent should buy this album for their teen because it's gotten me through the worst times and has improved my outlook on life. XTINA is definately going to be the next in the likes of Madonna and Cher. If you don't have this album, stop reading this and order it!

B00001OH7P|5.0|Why is Ziggy Stardust such a classic?Because frankly it puts<BR>alot of freeze-dried riffing,soulful backup,cosmic lyricism and<BR>a glittery alien guitar player into the hands of the early 70's<BR>and forever.The R&amp;B'ish &quot;Five Years&quot; is as great a starter as any<BR>but my favorite by far is the posturing,irreverant glam slam of<BR>&quot;Moonage Dreams&quot;in whitch (as you'll here) Bowie/Stardust deftly<BR>illustrates his statement of intent.Oh yea and then there's<BR>&quot;Starman&quot;,&quot;Suffergete City&quot; and the ever-memorable tital track<BR>plugging through the cosmic rock n' roll mix.Oh and yes-Ziggy<BR>did play guitar!!
B00000J7JO|4.0|I thought that the album was cool, and I like the old Chili Peppers stuff, but the new one is good, too.  Very different, reminds me more of Under The Bridge, which is not bad, just different.  I think that perhaps they might lose a couple of their hardcore funk fans in the process, but  I think it is definetly worth purchasing.<br />Peace

0783239955|5.0|Oh mon dieu! Ce film est tres drole! It didn't make me laugh the whole way through, but then again, no movie ever has. The plot concerns a group of stuck-up upper class french guys who get their kicks by trying to find the biggest idiot they can and inviting them to dinner. Once the idiots get together, the fun is watching them talk. As you can probably tell, these guys are not the nicest out there and they probably deserve their comeuppance (spelling?). Well, don't worry 'cause one of the rich guys, a publisher perfectly played by Thierry Lhermitte accidentaly throws out his back the night of an idiot dinner. (In French, un diner de con). His invited idiot decides it is his duty to stay and help Thierry since his wife seems to be absent...<BR>     What follows, not suprisingly is top-grade humor. Few actual punchlines are to be found, which is somehow even funnier. Just because you liked, say, American Pie (I did) doesn't mean you'll hate this, but I would recommend staying away from this if you've never laughed at anything but a poo-poo joke. For the record, I think the \\"Belgian\\" phone call is one of the funniest things I have ever seen along with the expression on the tax auditor's face when he finds out where his wife is.<br />                         SEE THIS MOVIE

0060955775|3.0|The first part of Veronika Decides to Die is a bleak journey into the head of the fatalistic young woman who gives the book its name. Author Paulo Coelho does a good job here of describing the mindset that would lead someone to suicide, and in setting the stage for Veronika's rebirth in the later parts of the book. Really understanding the book, I think, requires understanding this part.<br />But understanding Mr. Coelho requires understanding the rest of the story.<br />There is a simple beauty to Mr. Coelho's style, in evidence as he describes Veronika's ascent from the depths of her private purgatory to her return to her place among the living. This evolution in Veronika is the crux of the book and it illustrates Mr. Coelho's strengths and weaknesses as a storyteller: his ideas are fresh and original and his sense of plot of solid. But his techniques as a writer, his dialogues, his pacing, are weak.<br />To be sure, Mr. Coelho's ideas are the cornerstones of his legion fan base. The ideas are not only visible in this book when it comes to Veronika's rebirth but also in interesting but minor parts of the story. One of my favorites was when Mari -- an antagonist to Veronika, a lawyer, and a fellow patient at the Villete hospital where most of the story takes place -- muses about how she would defend Adam in the eyes of God for the role he played in the Fall of Man. I also enjoyed the metaphor from Zedka -- another patient -- about the king and queen who rules a kingdom of mad people and how they reacted.<br />But I quarrel with Mr. Coelho's development of characters, and especially with his choice of dialogue. Veronika, notwithstanding her epic journey from being suicidal to becoming essentially optimistic, can seem almost two-dimensional in the sense that she seems to evolve on her own, like a self-contained universe. And events are too pat: witness Eduard, who may have been pretending to be a schizophrenic waiting for the off chance that someone like Veronika would come along.<br />The dialogue is similarly contrived. Open the book to any page and read out loud what is between quotation marks and it will probably seem artificial. People do not talk that way -- especially when they are talking to themselves, which is often the case here. I also wonder why Mr. Coelho chose to put certain dialogue -- things like &quot;yes, I will&quot; or &quot;sometimes I do,&quot; which would normally be added to the narration in the form of paraphrase -- in quotations when they add almost nothing to the characters' development.<br />I have friends who are big fans of Mr. Coelho's work and they tell me that these unconventional characteristics add to the other-worldliness of the author's stories. I can see how that might work, but I cannot help but feel that they simply make the story less effective, that they dull the edge of what could be sharply original and important story rather than one that is merely good.<br />Despite that, I will say that if you are reading these reviews because you are undecided about whether or not to read Mr. Coelho's books, I would encourage you to do so and to start with Veronika Decides to Die. In spite of its imperfections, it is a quick and enjoyable read and probably the best point of entry to the collection of work from a writer who has enjoyed phenomenal success worldwide. As I have stated, I do not believe this is a book without flaw, but I cannot be so critical as to say the story is also without value. Read it, and decide for yourself how far the scale tips one way or the other.ld come along. <br />The dialogue is similarly contrived.

B00000163G|5.0|What can I say about this classic hip hop album that hasnt already been said!!!!!  to be honest..... not much.  But this is my Favorite 2pac album ever!!!!  In my opinion, 2pac isnot only the greatest rap artist ever but also the greatest writer in hip hop!!!!!  This album is just an example of what he can do with his incredible talents in a short amount of time.  Every song on here gets at least 4.5 stars......  I would go in more detail... but so much has been said by so many other people........ Its the GREATEST!!!!!
B00005JKZV|5.0|\\"The Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers\\" is a step-up from \\"The Fellowship of the Ring.\\" Bigger and better, Peter Jackson has succeded in bringing the first two novels of Tolkien's epic trilogy to life on the screen. The Battle of Helm's Deep is without a doubt the best battle scene ever committed to film as of now (From all reports, The Battle of Minas Tirith in \\"The Return of the King\\" will make Helm's Deep look like a skirmish).<br />The first DVD release of \\"The Two Towers\\" is pretty much the same as the first DVD release for \\"The Fellowship of the Ring.\\" The documentaries, which are short but informative, are from television and lordoftherings.net. The best features are the previews for the Extended DVD Edition of \\"The Two Towers,\\" and the exciting ten-minute preview for \\"The Return of the King.\\"<br />Overall, this is an incredible DVD to buy. I highly recommend it!<br />Movie/DVD Grade: A+
B00003CXC6|5.0|Once you have passed through, you will be stripped of all pretense.  This shocking movie leaves you wondering what has just happened.  That it is able to do this in Japanese is all the more amazing.<br />You are left looking at the shell of a destroyed society, wondering how it could have happened in the first place-and wondering if it is possible for man to learn his lessons.
B00006ADD5|5.0|I hadn't seen this film in 20 years, but this version on DVD brings one of the greatest films of all time to my home theater. The film is visually magnificient: a big screen is almost essential, and if you have one, you will want a bigger one. Its not hard to understand why Peter O'Toole became an instand International star. Truly one of the most electric performances ever captured on film. Get bridge Over the River Kwai and have your own David Lean festival.
B00005JLT5|4.0|Very important story based on an autobiography book by Wladyslaw Szpilman, Polish Jewish great pianist who survived the Nazi rape of Poland in WW-II. Great and very talented director Roman Polanski who for the second time in his career went in the undermined world to make a point, to tell the real story which have been told before.<BR>Nazi march thru Poland, placed Jews in Ghettos and than shipped them to concentrating camps. To burn them, to gas them, to kill them.  Wladyslaw Szpilman ( best role by Adrien Brody ) was lucky to get away and hide to survive. Five stars! A million Oscars! No! Why?<BR> After first 30 minutes of the film, I lost any interest in main character. Even Polanski admitted that this was not much to go with. This is not the story of someone who sacrificed something for better. It is a story of a chicken which never crossed the road. But I have to admit director's talent. The way how he showed his personal point of view on the main character: by making him watch in hiding the others, the ones who chose not to hide but to fight. The ones who didn't care about their little lives but cared about real freedom... the ones who won the war.<BR>At the end the story of the German officer got my attention but it died without deep look into it.<BR>I would of give this fine film A- grade, but I watched not well known \\"The Truce\\" few month before \\"The Pianist\\" came out. Compare to that film? Solid 4 stars, not an inch more.<BR>\\"Vlad\\"
B00003CX9E|5.0|It seems that every review of this film calls it &quot;arguably the best film of all time.&quot; Get rid of the first word and you have it right. Ironically, for all the emphasis on Welles' cinematic breakthroughs here, Kane is Welles' most accessible film - it should have been a populist hit - but was suppressed by William Randolph Hearst. Welles and company are young and appear to be having lots of fun with this. The DVD has exceptional extras as befits a film of this caliber.
B00005JKZV|3.0|Fantastic 5.1 audio, seamless special FX and superb cinematography (not to mention continued stellar performances from all involved) make this a phenominal production without question. In the ever growing trend of mediocre-at-best sequels, LOTR: The Two Towers stands tall and mighty indeed with standout sequels alongside the likes of The Empire Strikes Back, Aliens, and your coice of Indiana Jones follow-ups.<BR>From that standpoint alone I purchased this release, and as such am not dissatisfied.<br />From a content perspective however, I must say that those responsible for the release could be best coined \\"lords of the marketing\\". I understand two more DVD box sets are enroute. Extra footage (40+ minutes) which is excellent of course, and 2 (two) DVDs of additional content. Fantastic! However, I think it a bit of a stretch to include so little 'bonus' content on this release. Yes, the teaser 10 minute preview of Return of the King is great, but it feels as if the additional content was intentionally curtailed in order to justify TWO additional DVD box sets... Come on guys.   Sound design, a few cheezy prime-time special behind the scenes featurettes, and a completely unrelated 'mini-movie' do not justify an additional content DVD by any stretch of the imagination, and personally, I feel is an borderline shameful addition to such a fantastic film. Hopefully the upcoming box set(s) will include more interresting, in-depth content such as storyboard-to-screen multi-angle comparrisons and 'how we did it' featurettes we've  come to expect from 99.9% of all effects-ladden releases since the Matrix... How about the fact that the process of filming three films simultaneously has never been done before? Key scene deconstructions? Actor/actress screen tests? Bloopers/Gag Reels? Look at the bonus DVD for Star Wars: Episode I or the Matrix, or Fight Club. THOSE are bonus DVDs.<BR>A lot of work, yes, but this film DESERVES it, don't you think? <BR>I would rather have it given to us with both barrels (er, towers in this case) in the deluxe 4 disc edition as opposed to a mediocre-at-best initial release. I understand the \\"need\\" for a DVD#2 as it is \\"standard\\", but I at least feel the standard should be met, don't you?<BR>Fanstastic Scren-to-DVD transfer. The move gets 5+ stars. The Bonus DVD gets 1 star, bringing my rating WAY down to 3 stars.<BR>The sad part is, like me, SO many of you will buy it to have it NOW, and if additional content is of value to you, more than likely purchase on of the upcoming box sets in Oct. Oh well. They have to pay for these epics somehow right?

B00005JLD4|5.0|Director Phillip Noyce, who has several notably successful films - both `artistically' and `commercially' - to his credit, has given viewers something very special indeed in this effort.  RABBIT-PROOF FENCE is moving and absorbing, and goes a long way in illustrating to the world the injustices that have been done to indigenous peoples - NOT just the Aborigines in Australia - in the name of `doing what is best for them'.  In attempting to impose what they think is best, colonizers from time immemorial have shattered and destroyed millions of families and lives - their arrogance has trampled on the souls of so many.  Facing up to this is the first step in righting wrongs, and - hopefully - in preventing their recurrence.  A novel I read recently - FUGITIVE PIECES, by Anne Michaels - summed it up nicely:  `History is the poisoned well, seeping into the groundwater.  It is not the unknown past we're doomed to repeat, but the past we know.'  In other words - learning about the mistakes of the past is all well and good, but if we don't learn FROM these mistakes, we have accomplished nothing.<br />This film is based on a book that chronicles the true story of three young girls on a perilous and courageous journey across 1500 miles of Outback terrain - terrain that is unforgiving as only that in Australia can be.  Ripped from their families by `well-meaning' government policies designed to civilize and train `half-caste' children (children born of mixed blood) and assimilate them back into white society, `breeding out the Black' over the course of 2-3 generations, the girls (ranging in age from 7 to 14) are traumatized beyond belief.  The strength and heart they show is moving and inspiring - if children can rise up and stand against the odds thrown against these three, we can accomplish anything.  The children who were thus `removed to government care' came to be known as `the stolen generations'.<br />Noyce was moved by the story itself - in the form of a screenplay presented to him - to make this film.  With successes in the past with such works as THE QUIET AMERICAN, THE BONE COLLECTOR, and two Harrison Ford box-office smashes, PATRIOT GAMES and CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER, he had the reputation to make this film happen - and it's a treasure.  I'll agree wholeheartedly with another reviewer below - the accompanying documentary on the making of the film, in which we can see the process used to find the three children to portray the main roles (the girls chosen had never acted before) is fascinating.  One part of the documentary shows the filming of the scene in which the girls are taken by government agents, literally torn from their mothers' arms - even knowing it was `only a scene in a film', when it was over there were tears in the eyes of not just the actors, but the director and film crew as well.  This is VERY moving subject matter - and it translates to the screen incredibly well, without ever lapsing into maudlin sentimentality.<br />Aside from the three girls (Everlyn Sampi, Tianna Sansbury and Laura Monaghan), everyone else in the cast does a nice job as well.  Kenneth Branagh does a fine, understated turn as A.O.Neville, the government official charged with `protecting' the Aboriginal peoples in his region.  Notable also is the well-known Aboriginal actor David Gulpilil - veteran of such classics as Peter Weir' THE LAST WAVE and Nicolas Roeg's WALKABOUT).  His presence is electrifying, as always - his portrayal of Moodoo the Tracker is successful on many levels, allowing him to illustrate how hard it was for an Aborigine to be `in the service' of the white man's government.  Moodoo's own daughter is a pupil at the government-run school where the three girls have been placed - so, while his loyalties to the government lead him to track the runaways, he is able to feel sympathy for their plight at the same time, admiring their skills and (I suspect) secretly hoping that they will elude him.<br />With all of these componentsadding up to a fine piece of filmmaking, I can't neglect to mention the amazing soundtrack music, composed and performed by Peter Gabriel.  He has taken the story into his heart and provided the viewer with nothing less than the spirit of the girls, their ordeal, story and courage, in musical form.  Incorporating many elements of Aboriginal music into his work makes it more powerful still - it's an important element that makes an outstanding contribution to the overall effect of the film.<br />There is violence in this film - both overt and psychological - but it is a violence that is an intrinsic part of the story.  There is no nudity that I remember - if it was present, it was so much a part of the lives depicted that it flowed naturally into the scheme of things.  There is only a hint of sexuality.  How in the world can a film be successful without sex, nudity, senseless violence, foul language and drugs?  This one does it - by taking a moving story (never forget:  taken from life) and painting it carefully, honestly and with great feeling onto the screen.  This is a film that should be seen by everyone - don't be afraid to view it with your entire family.adding up to a fine piece of filmmaking, I can't neglect to mention the amazing soundtrack music, composed and performed by Peter Gabriel.

But little has been said about the changes done to the Crawfords.  The movie makes them both out to be a plotting devious pair, far beyond anything that could be passed off as being Fanny's view of them.<br />     The movie is definitely not Mansfield Park as written by Jane Austen.  But it is still entertaining, so long as you are prepared for the excessive devations from Austen.

B000025H0Q|4.0|Nick Drake's music has, and will never, grow old on me. He had an amazing gift for composing complex songs with poetically complex lyrics that actually meant something once you pondered their meaning (unlike Peter Senfield's pretentious, indecipherable wordplay with King Crimson, for example). Having stellar production helped his songs, also, although this album's title track and \\"Fly\\" are marred by unnecessary harpsichord, fiddles and flutes.  <br />Which leads me to this stellar album. It still retains the orchestration of his debut 5 Leaves Left, and it is used to great effect on the moody, cascading opener \\"Introduction,\\" \\"Hazy Jane I,\\" and \\"Sunday,\\" all of which echoes his debut with his complex, fingerpicked guitar melodies pairing up with lush, though not sappy, strings. Horns are also used on the surprisingly energetic \\"Hazy Jane II,\\" which remains the closest Drake came to sounding like a commercial-sounding songwriter. <br />But he's still not that commercial, with his sadness clearly showing on \\"At the Chime of a City Clock,\\" a number that would have sounded right at home on Pink Moon, stripped of its strings, drums, and sax. Also of note are the mellow jazz chords of \\"Poor Boy,\\" marking the only time that Nick picked up an electric guitar. <br />By contrast, the jumpy \\"One of These Things First\\" is one of the rare occaisons where Nick overtly boasts of not being morose. Driven by a simple, yet complex guitar/piano riff that gives the tune a joyful, inspiring feel. But not as inspiring (or, to be more accurate, awe-inspiring) as the magical \\"Northern Sky,\\" which actually sounds like modern-day new-age pop (in the good sense), not something recorded in 1970. It is transformed from simply a good folk-pop song to an astonishing masterpiece by a gorgeous, echoing celeste and fabulous piano work by none other than the ex-Velvet John Cale. Yes, the same John Cale who participated in such songs as \\"Heroin\\" and \\"Sister Ray.\\" To this day, \\"Northern Sky\\" remains one of Drake's crowning moments. <br />Even with \\"Northern Sky,\\" \\"Introduction,\\" \\"Hazy Jane II,\\" and \\"One of these Things First,\\" some of Drake's best moments, Bryter Layter isn't his best album. Yes, it is occaisonally weighed down by too much orchestration, but it has a consistently high quality that most songwriters would have a very difficult time topping. I prefer the haunting, spare Pink Moon, which made a huge emotional impact that is somewhat buried in full productions such as this. Still Bryter Layter is probably one of the finest records from a folk songwriter to come from anyone other than giants such as Bob Dylan, the Fairport Convention, or Phil Ochs. And that's no small accomplishment.
0375823360|5.0|There are two major results in modern Cosmology: First, we can only observe less tha 10% of the Universe. The rest is dark matter, still unaccounted for. Second, theories predict that, just as our Solar System is not the only one in our Galaxy, and our Galaxy is not the only one in the Universe, there can also be other Universes, inaccessible to us. Philip Pullman uses these results as the basis for his Trilogy \\"His Dark Materials\\".  Starting in a parallel World, or Universe, in a parallel Oxford, Lyra Belaqua, an 11 year old girl gets into fantastic adventures. These are related to the existence of a certain Dust, which is dark matter, and which no one can see, except under very special circumstances. The \\"Church\\" of her world keeps the existence of Dust secret, and those who talk about it are considered heretics. This is the basis for a struggle, which deals not so much with good vs. evil, as in usual children's stories, but with wisdom and consciousness vs. ignorance and stupidity. The plot thickens throughout the three books, introducing a major character in the second book; Will Parry, slightly older than Lyra, who comes from our own world, and who will team up with Lyra in her future adventures, both of them looking for persons they have lost, and which they care about dearly. Along the story, several interesting characters are introduced; inhabitants from several different worlds. Some of them familiar in Western mythology, such as angels, witches and spectres, as well as new ones which come out of Pulman's imagination. In his plot, he explores daring ideas about organised religion, particularly Christianism and Catholisism, that he extends to question the very existence of God, and that religious people will find outright heretical. Specially the ending of the Kingdom of Heaven, which is to be replaced by the Republic of Heaven. However, organised religion should think twice before condemning the trilogy to bonfire, since that is precisely the kind of attitude that has lead Pullman to make his denunciation in the first place. A more rational approach to the story should be advised. Along each of the three books, we are introduced to three mysterious devices: a compass which can tell the truth and provide advice, a knife so strong than can cut through almost anything, including windows into different worlds, and a spyglass which humans can use to observe Dust. The story leaves compelling cliff hangers at the end of the first and second books, and becomes more interesting as it advances. I personally found the third book the best by all means. Its ending is absolutely heartbreaking, and it can take days to reflect on it and assimilate it. Although the reader is left with the feeling that a sequel is needed in order to fix things up, she (he) eventually realises that it is the best possible ending. Although profoundly sad and traumatic, it leaves an open window to optimism. <br />Overall, Pullman shows great artistry in the command of the English Language, which by itself makes the Trilogy captivating.  At some points, we are left with the impression that more work should have been devoted by the author, in the development of some of the episodes. Although it is clear that it is a fantasy story, there is a minimum credibility to be expected from fantasy. Also, there are a few but important loose ends, which could have been easily tied up by the author, with minor changes in some of the dialogues. Still, the story is extremely good, and the trilogy highly recommendable.<br />A final word of caution should be cast: Although His Dark Materials has been classified as a children's book, it requires a minimum maturity to understand some of the issues it deals with, so \\"parental guidance\\" is strongly recommended. Furthermore, religious families may be offended by some of the concepts, which as I mentioned earlier, are outright heretical on the face of Jewish, Christian and Muslim faiths. However, open minded religious people will recognise that many of the main ideas fostered by Pullman, such as loyalty, fidelity  sense of duty and compassion, are in line with religious values. There is, of course, no compatibility with his doubt on the existence of God. In any case, it is just a story, not a manifesto. On the other hand, by the end, some readers may be left with the idea that what Pullman actually did is to rediscover the existence of God in the omnipresent Dust, although he will probably not recognise it.
B00005QZ7U|2.0|MOULIN ROUGE, although it has apparently, though oddly, regenerated an interest in the full-blown &quot;Hollywood musical&quot; left me totally cold. I found it a bloated, incomprehensible mish-mash of cheap cinematic tricks, with little or no substance, relying on the use of pre-existing musical numbers, erratically staged, and performances obviosuly coaxed from actors who cared little about their roles or the project. Visually tiring, with its peculiar editing, it was a total chore to sit through. Thank goodness Miramax ignored this dismal effort and took the plunge to make CHICAGO, which is infinately a much better film musical. If &quot;the musical&quot; does indeed return to Hollywood and once again becomes acceptable and accessible to the movie-going public, it will be because of CHICAGO, not the trite and over-the-top MOULIN ROUGE.

B000002J29|5.0|This double live CD is of a quality that is hard to believe. I know many people who just scuff at the notion that some bands are better live than in the studio, but hell, what do they know. How can anyone who know the early Genesis music, and then are presented with this magnificent live recording, disagree?<br />These CDs, recorded in Paris during the summer part of the bands 77 world tour (with the exception of one track, 'The Cinema Show', recorded during their 76 tour) cover both newer material from their most recent Phil Collins-fronted albums A Trick Of The Tail (76) and Wind And Wuthering (77), and many of the classics dating back from the Peter Gabriel-fronted albums Nursery Cryme (71), Foxtrot (72), Selling England By The Pound (73) and The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway (74).<br />As it has been mentioned, this version of the monumental 'Supper's Ready' makes the whole album worth it's price. This is really unbelievable - it's delivered in a version that can only be described as flawless, and this covers everything from the fantastic playing of every member of the band, much better than on the original studio version (incredible, considering the complexness of this music) - to Phil's vocal performance that is purely awe-inspiring. From the explosiveness of the uptempo parts to the intensity of the thrilling conclusion, it goes right under your skin.<br />The versions of 'Firth Of Fifth' and 'The Cinema Show' are in fact equally impressive. Though 'Firth Of Fifth' was played without the wonderful piano intro, it is still incredible, probably my candidate for the best Genesis song ever, and the fantastic keyboard and guitar solos are even better than on the studio version in this recording. 'The Cinema Show' is presented with a considerably altered ending, much more uptempo than the studio version, and combined with Phil's breathtaking vocal performance, this must be the ultimate version of this track. The version of 'I Know What I Like' is also one of my favorite ones, Phil does a lovely vocal, and though I find the outtro somewhat long-winded, I love the inclusion of the 'Stagnation' line into it.<br />The other old songs aren't quite as succesful. Though this is a beautiful version of 'Carpet Crawlers', I still miss the intro, and I'd any time prefer the 1999 version with original band line-up, but with the song completely rerecorded. Also some later live recordings from the 1980 tour outbest this recording. Similarly, the 'Lamb Lies Down On Broadway/Musical Box'-medley was done even better as part of the terrific 'Old Medley' of the 1992 tour (check out The Way We Walk part 2).<br />As good as the old songs are, equally pleasing are the versions of the new songs delivered here. 'Squonk' is delivered in a slightly faster version on the album, and combined with a lovely vocal performance by Phil, this deffinitely works much better than album version- which is even more true for 'Robery, Assault and Robbery', delivered with a nerly explosive energy here. The 'Dance On A Volcano/Los Endos' medley, to be an essential part of the live sets of many of their following tours, is also delivered with a stunning amount of energy, by far outdoing the album version. Only 'Afterglow' is not presented at it's best here - taken out of it's context (as a counterpart to the eery and noisy 'Unqiet Slumbers For The Sleepers In That Quiet Earth') it sounds a bit hollow, and this song was also delivered in an absolutely incredible version on the 1981 tour (listen to the fantastic veautiful version on 'Three Sides Live').<br />A comment should be thrown in about the actual setlist of the concert. This recording has been completely remixed, and unfortunately has some of the show been left out. The full set list was as follows: Squonk - One For The Vine - Robbery, Assault And Battery - Inside and Out - Firth Of Fifth - The Carpet Crawlers - In That Quiet Earth / Afterglow - I Know What I Like - Eleventh Earl Of Mar - Supper's Ready - Dance On AVolcano/Los Endos - (encore) The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway/The Musical Box (closing section).<br />It would have been nice to have had a greater focus put on the Wind And Wuthering album with the inclusion of central songs like 'Eleventh Earl Of Mar' and 'One For The Vine' (the latter was released in a phenominal recording from 1980 as part of the UK version of Three Sides Live, also on the Remaster version).<br />Finally, I have heard from what I consider reliable sources that some amount of overdub is present in this live release (as contrary to the other Genesis live releases). Whether this is true I don't know, and frankly I don't care either - I have many other live recordings where they deliver these songs in equally impressive versions.<br />Whether this is the best Genesis live release is hard to answer. If you consider the track list, one must probably say yes, but actually the Three Sides Live recording from the 1981 tour is an even better concert, at least in my oppinion. Actually, I don't think it makes any sense to rate one of these live recordings above the other, because they are both incredible, and anyone with any interest in this band's music should own both of them.
B0000A02U2|5.0|By some strange, perfect alignment of the stars, The Official Preppie Handbook and Animal House were birthed during my years at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. SMU was ranked the #8 drinking school in the OPH, and I see it is in the top ten this year for Princeton Review's \\"Fraternity/Sorority Action\\".<br />We had our equivalents of the Omegas and the Deltas. After the movie was released, more frats aspired to be Deltas!  I remember once incident where some frat brothers went to the movie, one of them in a wheelchair so he could sneak in a case of beer under the blanket.<br />The character of Neidermeyer is instantly recognized by all Texans as a prototype of the Texas Aggie Corps Cadet (C.T. - Corps Turd).  When SMU's cheerleaders were rushed at an A&M game by a sword-wielding cadet, we instantly called him \\"Neidermeyer!\\" the same way the Flounder character did.<br />Believe it or not, some of the movie antics are not so far-fetched!   Instant classic!  I was once in a chat room where we quoted the damn thing for hours.<br />The 70s had Closeau/Pink Panther movies, Mel Brooks classics and Airplane!....comedies have gone down the 'tube' ever since.

I hate war films for the uncanny Hollywood tendancy to deliver story arcs and nice endings. This is all about a journey of such an un repeatable nature that it could only be told in excruciating and beautiful detail. It is best digested in small pieces as the enormity of the work is truly over whelming first time around.  <br />Maybe best kept for rainy winter days.
B00007LTIC|5.0|More or less pronounced dead after RELAYER, this release caught everyone by surprise, and re-cast YES in a very avant mode. THe compositions are absolutely terrific. Wakeman was back on board after a slew of ridiculously themed victorian disasters, and played as though he had better resurrect his career, which he did momentarily. Anderson, Howe and Squire were writing with a commitment that had not been this razor sharp since the YES ALBUM. The songs had an urgency, yet could also re-create a sense of magic. &quot;Wonderous Stories,&quot; &quot;Turn of the Century&quot;, &quot;Awaken&quot; were positively and emotionally stunning. &quot;Going For The One&quot; re-set the game board altogether for YES and has served them well as an indication of just how protean a force they were. The only downside to this was the element of having recorded much of this separately, leaving it to their producer, Eddie Offord, to fashion this into the marvel that it became. The remastering serves as much to validate Offord's remarkable contributions as it does to resuscitate the YES career, much like MAGNIFICATION would do 20 years later.<BR>The extras here contain one gem, and one bogie, 2 runthroughs. &quot;Vevey&quot; is worthy of inclusion, &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; does not need Chris Squire to air it out; in fact, it would be best if no one played it for a good century,especially anybody Scottish. It is as hackneyed as &quot;Danny Boy.&quot; Perhaps the remastering folks will embrace a less is more approach with the remaining catalogue.<BR>All the same, another terrifc job on the remastering: just remarkable how very, very good this great disc sounds.
B00005JKN9|5.0|Martin Scorsese has created a masterpiece with his long awaited \\"Gangs Of New York.\\" Though the film is far from perfect, Scorsese has succeeded in fulfilling his desire to make a movie about New York City's gangs, and underworld elements, during the corrupt reign of \\"Boss Tweed\\" and Tammany Hall. He also portrays the plight of poor Irish immigrants, and the prejudice they face when arriving in New York. Scorsese's attention to detail, the sets, costumes and period language, provide a spectacular and realistic backdrop for this very energetic historical film. He effectively incorporates the personal lives of his characters with the film's political and historical elements - really superior work!<br />My primary issue with the film, is that while the Irish did cause a tremendous riot, and murdered African-Americans, the film didn't focus on the reasons for this historical event, or really clarify, even for a brief period of the movie's 168 minutes, the reason for the riots. Instead, the upheaval was portrayed as something that grew out of the gang wars. Scorsese's interpretation skews history a bit, and leaves the viewer wondering why African-Americans were being victimized. Or perhaps that part of the film was left on the cutting room floor.<br />By 1860, one of every four New York City residents was an Irish-born immigrant. They worked as unskilled laborers on the docks, as ditch diggers and street pavers, and as cartmen and coal heavers. They competed directly with the city's African-American workers for jobs. The racial tension ran high before the war, and peaked in 1863. The National Conscription Act was passed in March 1863. Many immigrants were drafted right off the boat, knowing little about the cause, or politics, of the War Between the States. In the spring of 1863, in the midst of a strike of Irish dock workers, strikers attacked and beat African-American strike-breakers before federal troops arrived to protect the black workers. It is during these \\"Draft Riots\\" that the film's extraordinary finale takes place.<br />The action begins in 1846. A group of Irish immigrants living in the Five Points slums of New York City are part of the \\"Dead Rabbits Gang.\\" They are led by the noble priest Vallon, (Liam Neeson), in a turf war about control over the money they earn, and over the streets of the Five Points slums, on New York's lower East Side. The already well established \\"Natives Gang,\\" Protestants whose ancestors fought in the War of Independence, are extremely prejudiced against the Irish Catholics. Bill \\"the Butcher\\" Cutting, (brilliantly played by Daniel Day- Lewis, who always turns in a superb performance), is the \\"Nativist\\" gang leader, who collects a portion of everyone's earnings, and runs the local gangs and underworld criminals. He conspires with \\"Boss Tweed\\" and the local police to make more money, lining the politicians pockets as he does so. During the gang fight, filmed using dramatic camera shots, unusual angles, occasional slow motion, and backed by an extraordinary musical score, Vallon is killed by \\"The Butcher.\\" The priest has a young son, Amsterdam Vallon, who witnesses everything and swears revenge. \\"The Butcher\\" places the boy in an institution, where he lives for the next sixteen years. When he is released, Amsterdam (Leonardo Di Caprio), goes back to \\"Five Points\\" looking to settle his score with \\"The Butcher.\\" Unexpectedly, Bill takes a liking to Amsterdam, who assumes an alias to protect his identity. The two form a bond, of sorts, which makes it difficult for the young Vallon to take his revenge.<br />What follows is an absolutely riveting movie, with an excellent cast. The actors certainly shine under Scorsese's direction. Daniel Day-Lewis' character, the charismatic, barbaric psychopath Bill, is the film's central figure. Day-Lewis is one of the most talented actors in the industry. Although I do not care for Leonardo DiCaprio, he puts in a decent performance as Amsterdam Vallon. Cameron Diaz's, as the quick fingered Jenny, lover of young Amsterdam, more than holds her own. The supporting cast is top-notch. I do think the editing could have been done better, to provide a smoother flow. However, with all its flaws, \\"Gangs of New York\\" is well worth watching and deserves a full five stars!<br />JANA's, as the quick fingered Jenny, lover of young Amsterdam, more than holds her own.

I'm very [upset] that Daniel-Day Lewis didn't win for best actor only thing adrien brody did in the pianist was run and hide from nazi's. This was my favorite movie of 2002. GO SCORCESE
0521370957|3.0|The unfortunate thing about this book is that some effort seems to have been made to market it as a teaching tool or textbook that would be useful to neophytes and rank beginners.  It is anything but that.  If you use this book to begin your study of electronics you will end up very frustrated indeed.  <br />The writing has a strange schizophrenic quality to it.  Portions of the writing are almost brilliant.  For instance, in the very first chapter we find on Page 20:  &quot;...capacitors are devises that might be considered simply frequency-dependent resistors.&quot; An excellent way of thinking of capacitors! But in other places, like on Page 9, you find whoppers like &quot;A voltage source 'likes' an open-circuit load and 'hates' a short-circuit load, for obvious reasons&quot; (obvious??!!) and &quot;A current source 'likes' a short-circuit load and 'hates' an open-circuit load.&quot;  Other gems include circuits &quot;looking into each other&quot; as though they have eyes.  Such anthropomorphic analogies may (actually, in fact, are) useful to seasoned electrical engineers or even intermediate EE students.  Upon those less advanced, like hobbyists or beginning EE students, their only effect is to overwhelm the beginner with a sense of the &quot;weirdness&quot; of electronics and its inaccessibility.  <br />In other words, H &amp; H's effort to make electronics accessible will, for many, have just the opposite effect - to intimidate them from continuing their electronic journey.   It is harrowing to think that some university physics and EE professors, having succumbed to the not inconsiderable hype about this book, are using it as an introductory text.  Pity the poor students in those courses.  This, notwithstanding what is written on Page vii of the Student Manual:  &quot;...during the summer we see [in an introductory course at Harvard on electronics] many high school students, and some of these do brilliantly.&quot;  <br />In short:  I can only give H &amp; Ha C minus in their effort at technical writing, and suggest that beginners and first-year students turn to Grob or to Schaum's Outlines (both excellent) for supplementary help.  <br />Don't get me wrong.  For the intermediate learner of electronics, this is not only a very helpful book but an incredibly useful one, especially as a reference.  But any &quot;beginner&quot; or &quot;high school student&quot;  who thrives on this book is not being completely honest about his background (he &quot;forgot&quot; to mention to the person or instructor to whom he introduced himself as a &quot;beginner&quot; the trivial fact that he already has an amateur radio license, or some such) or he is, shall we say, very very smart.
1577311523|5.0|I found the book &quot;The Power of Now&quot; by Eckhart Tolle inspirational.<BR>I feel this book did a good job of teaching me that I am<BR>not the voices that I listen to in my head. The only thing<BR>there is, is now. I never realized how when I am lost in my<BR>thoughts I am not present, and what I am thinking may not<BR>actually be true. It was quite a novel idea for me to<BR>learn of the reality of &quot;being,&quot; not thinking or doing.<br />Another excellent book you might want to check out is<BR>&quot;Working on Yourself Doesn't Work&quot; by Ariel &amp; Shaya Kane.<BR>It is about living in the moment, not in the future or the<BR>past. Reading this book was like a mini vacation.
B00007LTIB|3.0|&quot;Gates of Delerium&quot;, excluding &quot;Soon&quot;, was a bit of a retread of the third movement of TALES, but it introduced Patrick Moraz briefly to YES fans. Moraz would make no one forget, and most people long for, Rick Wakeman, an unenviably position to be in, yet he had his moments, all of which came on what was the album's second side. Moraz's jazz influenced directions were best put to use with &quot;Sound Chaser,&quot; an avant piece that opened YES up to more radical Twentieth Century classical directions than ther romantic-Wagnerian past had embraced. &quot;To Be Over&quot; sounded at the time like the swan song. It remains today one of the best songs YES has ever done. Howe recreated it with stunning poignancy on his NATURAL TIMBRES CD, and it is still the raison d'etre for this release. The tours for this CD convinced Moraz to look elsewhere for employment, which he did more successfully with The Moody Blues, and with a jazz duet with Bruford (wonder how Anderson and Fripp received that, hmmmmm.....).<BR>As to the remaster, jeez o man, it's incredible!  The extra stuff doesn't help the CD one way or the other, except that the single edit of &quot;Soon&quot; gets you past the disjointed bombast of most of &quot;Gates.&quot; Not nearly as bad a release as DRAMA or YES from the 90's, but still, Yes was clearly in transition, with the very real prospect that it was all over. You can hear that worry throughout this release.
B000002KZ6|5.0|One of the best albums of all time. No kidding. And &quot;Pull Up the Roots&quot; easily one of the most underrated songs.
0804106304|3.0|This is the story of 4 Chinese mothers and their daughters.<br />The mothers all grew up in China, listening to stories of spirits, dragons, etc and being brought up on the principles of Chinese mysticism.<br />The daughters grew up in California, USA, where American practicality and christian ideals were at direct conflict with the way the mothers were raised.<br />The mothers what the best for their daughters. They want their children to grow up with Chinese character under American circumstances (seeing how America is much more liberal than China during this time). <br />The end result is a semi-interesting novel about personal experiences and the life lessons they brought. All in all, I thought it wasn't THAT great. I certainly would not read this story again for many, many  years.
B00008V5VN|5.0|This is a great, great album.  Buy this and throw out Jerusalem.  The sound is much better, and you don't get the choppiness that Jerusalem has as a result of being broken up into several tracks.  If you're into the doom/stoner rock thing, this is the holy grail (this and Electric Wizard's Dopethrone, of course).  Everybody should have a copy.
B00006RCNW|5.0|Originally titled Rampart; The Shield burst onto cable TV with a blast and never stopped exploding.  A slimmed down Michael Chiklis (who many may remember as the title role from TV's The Commissh) is Vic Mackey; a detective who operates on both sides of the law in a fictional crime ridden district of Los Angeles.  Chiklis deserves all the praise he has garnered in his role since The Shield premiered; and the rest of the ensemble cast of character and virtually unknown actors are almost every bit as good.  From the shocking series premiere (the climax of which proved to be more shocking than all the hype surrounding it promoted it to be) to the season's brilliant final act; The Shield always revolves around the idea of a crooked cop drama, and it had an ace up it's sleeve at the same time.  All in all, if you've missed out on the best TV cop drama on cable television today, now has never been a better time to give The Shield a look.
B00007LTIA|5.0|In no uncertain terms, YES pushed the envelope as far as possible with this work, and the remastering job is so good, you will feel as though you are hearing it for the first time. In fact, in the very opening are moments of found sounds that I never heard in either vinyl or previous CD issues. But it is the seperation of the voclas and instruments that bring you to a snese that you are actually hearing this music being created. Eddie Offord had done an incredible job mixing the 24 tracks of this CD, and you just can't imagine how truly brilliantly he performed until you hear this re-issue. This is worth twice the price. I can't even imagine that DVDA or SACD could improve on this job.<BR>As to the disc itself, YES were incredibly fortunate to have been given the green light to take this on. There is nothing about this CD that would have appealed to market research. YES did this knowing that this would really demand loyaty from their fans in order to be successful. It was greeted in the press in extremes of adoration and derision, and perhaps you can argue that the Wagnerian scope of this effort is what was most responsible for the ensuing punk reaction a couple of years later.<BR>So does it work? ABSOLUTELY. Just how creative an efort this was, and just how very good this music remains is displayed catergorically clearly on this release. The music might arguably be considered even more important today, awash as today is in very corporately written, market researched music that tends to sample instead of create. Within YES themselves, the ambitions of Howe and Anderson were not entirely well received by Squire and Wakemen, yet both rose to the challenge. Alan White became the first of many drummers who have had the misfortune of following Bill Bruford in the drummer's chair (pity Collins, Thompson, Mastellotto, to name just a few), and on top of that was asked to contribute to music that was as far removed from accompanying John Lennon as you could get. He is remarkable throughout, especially when the band toured this album upon its release. The experience would jettison Wakeman, but then, it was a sort of crucible, this project. YES resolved all it had been up to this point, and so irreversible change, and extreme thresholds were positively necessary. There was no going back after TALES.<BR>Again, as with CLOSE TO THE EDGE, the superfluous tracks are just that, but how else do you handle a 90 minute work over 2 CDs? I think it is very rewarding to hear the first three movements consecutively, and somehow it works to the dramatic advantage of the fourth movement to have to change discs. But the extra stuff, you can skip them.<BR>This was a tremendous acheivement for YES and the music herein has never sounded better.
B000023VR6|5.0|Hey. I think this is Dre's best album ever. He is my favorite rapper and this is his best. I hear some other people talkin bad about this album but it is awesome. I even think the skits are hilarious. If you like rap you should like this album. It even has Eminem and Snoop on a couple songs.
B000002UJQ|5.0|There isn't much I can say that hasn't been said before. It's REALLY that good.
B00004S35Z|5.0|Of all the amazing albums Stevie released in the 70's, this is definetely the weakest but it still warrants 5 stars. That alone says something about the WonderMan. As I usually do in my reviews, let's go song by song.  Smile Please: Stevie is first and foremost the visionary and optimist. Which can unfortunately make his music sometimes seem corny. This is one of those times. It is a beautiful song and it has one of the best lines of any of his work, \\"Love's not competing, it's on your side. You're in life's picture so why must you cry?\\" It's a weak opening for the album but again, it's Stevie so it's still better than half the stuff that passes for music today. Heaven Is Ten Zillion Light Years Away: One of the most spiritual songs he's ever written, and one of the best. Paul Anka, of all people, gives a soulful background vocal on this one. In it, Stevie tells us to realize that God lives inside of us all. Therefore be careful how you treat others. And, if you wonder where heaven is, we make our own. Too Shy to Say: The third example of what has become known as the Classic Stevie Wonder ballad (primarily piano, voice and bass). This is a heartfelt song of the lonliness of someone that sees their true love but for whatever reason, can't have them. A very country sounding slide guitar is added as an eerie, heart tugging effect. The song literally melts in love. Boogie On Reggae Woman: A funk based, semi-Reggae masterpiece. His drum playing snaps but the sound is almost tinny. His harmonica playing is funky and rough but yet exquiste. The vocals, barely understandable and funky. It's one of the roughest, playfulest songs he's ever done (in the same league as Don't You Worry 'Bout a Thing). And, most importantly...you can shake your tailfeathers to it! Creepin': Another great love song. It's about someone so in love They dream about it. It also harps back to Too Shy To Say because it seems that the person again is being ignored by or not known at all by the other lover. Minnie Riperton helps with the vocals on this one and her squeaky sweet voice is perfect for the song. The song also features another great harmonica solo. You Havne't Done Nothing: More funk coming your way in this one. Great piercing horn section, a great lead vocal and the funkiest synth riff since Superstition from the man himself AND great doo-wop from The Jackson Five in the middle of their hayday. How can you go wrong here? The song is a knock on Richard Nixon and his lies specifically but in reality, he's referring to all dishonest politicians. You can also shake your tailfeathers on this one but it's more of a militant march instead of a disco dance. One of his best political songs. It Ain't No Use: Another layered classic. This a great sing-along song with some good background vocal arrangements. They Won't Go When I Go: I look at it this way, if you ever decide to seriously study music and songwriting, there are 4 Stevie Wonder songs that will teach you about half of what you need to know. They are, Girl Blue from Music of My Mind, Living for The City from Innervisions, Lately from Hotter Than July, and They Won't go When I Go. With these songs you get lessons about timing, chord progression, key change, melody, harmony, major and minor keys, poly rhythms and the like. When you think of They Won't Go When I Go, don't think funky low down blues, think of a Bach requiem instead. This is a mournful song where Stevie is saying that no one will keep him from his goal of going to heaven. And when you think of it, if that was the goal for all of us, the world would be a better place. Beautiful harmony and keyboard arrangements backed by some pretty incredible background vocals (and of course another great lead vocal by The Man) takes this song to another level. A level not reached by many artist either before or after Stevie. It is the best song on the album by far. Bird of Beauty: This is another low point for the disc and unfortunately it follows the best song. Stevie sings about hey, if you're tired and stuff, don't take drugs, take a vacation! Yeah right. Again its the optimist Stevie winning over the logical Stevie. It's the equivelent of \\"Just Say NO\\", easy to do unless you're in the projects and have to walk through drug dealing territory everyday. A good message but not well thought out. Please Don't Go: Another great album finale. It's funk, blues and rock all mixed together as only Stevie could do. It's not the highlight of the album but it's way better then the song that proceeded it. It also featres another great vocal by The Man of course. So after everything is said and done, even though this album is the weakest of his 70's classics, it was still good enough to win the album of the year Grammy. Is that genius or what? Buy this album, you won't be disappointed.
B00000I0XW|5.0|The answer is nobody else. Sarah is at her best, with one of her best works in cd. She knows this scores very very well, and she sings it with a complete perfection.<BR>If you like Lloyd Webber's musicals, don't miss this one. Lloyd Webber at his best: with Sarah Brightman.
B0000024U8|4.0|In the absence of any intelligible listener reviews (such as the well written entry by BluesDuke below) I usually defer to Amazon's editorial reviews for guidance on unfamiliar music. As I am well familiar with the music on this disc I find Mr. Greilsamer's comments to be pretty far off the mark. What he dismisses as \\"enjoyable but dispensible noodling\\" I have for almost the last three decades considered to be some of the finest electric blues guitar playing I have ever heard. Indispensible. Opinions in music vary widely to be sure but to provide a more founded perspective than the editor who either listened to this disc only once or has no real insight into the music he's reviewing I have been studying guitar for 30 years and have found Mike Bloomfield's playing on this disc to be some of the finest I have ever heard, unqualified. In attempting to learn the craft of blues guitar improvisation I have learned more from \\"Albert's Shuffle\\" and \\"Really\\" than most all other albums combined. From what I have derived over the years, many other listeners and guitar players alike share this opinion. I'm a little concerned when I read supposedly authoritative reviews by people who have no more than a superficial knowledge of the genre and the music they are panning.
B000092ZYX|4.0|I really love this CD. While i found Kid A to be a work of genious, it's not necessarily driving around the town kind of music. HAil to the Thief is versatile enough to play when you're alone and pensive, stuck in rush hour traffic, or kicking back with buds. I don't feel qualified to analyze these guys in too much detail, but as long as you're not looking for the reincarnation of OKComputer (if you want to hear that, go play it!), it's a really groovy set of tracks.
1559277238|4.0|This book is a worthy addition to the Stephanie Plum series.  The only reservation I have is the reader.  It was a surprise to find Steph's &quot;joisey&quot; accent replaced by a middle America whitebread one although the reader portrayed the collateral characters very well.
0066620996|5.0|After writing Built to Last, a book which analyzes attributes of companies that have achieved long term success, its author, Jim Collins was chastised by one of his \\"fans\\" who commented on the book, \\"...it's useless... The companies you wrote about were, for the most part, always great... what about the vast majority of companies that wake up partway through life and realize that they're good, but not great?\\"<br />Collins was intrigued by this question. His research group promptly went to work searching for companies that had experienced a turning point from flat performance to a sustained (15 year minimum) period of spectacular market beating growth. Each of the eleven companies selected for study had achieved returns at least four times greater than the general market while also maintaining higher returns than its competitors.<br />These good to great companies have a variety of common factors:<BR>Leadership: Diligent, results-driven executives who are surprising humble.<BR>Strategy: Highly-focused on being the best at only one thing. Most companies took several years to achieve this focus by considering these three questions: What are we deeply passionate about? What can we be the best in the world at? What drives our economic engine?<BR>Honest Assessment: The most successful companies analyzed their successes and failures and didn't \\"sugar-coat\\" mistakes.<BR>The Right People: The author sums it up best, \\"People are not your most important asset. The right people are.\\"<br />Culture of Discipline: Each company had the discipline to maintain strategic focus.<BR>Smart Use of Technology: Successful companies used technology to accelerate and enable their achievements, but did not consider technology to be a primary driver of results.<br />I suggest that you read Collins book as soon as possible. In addition to providing recommendations to help your own company grow, it may also help your portfolio grow as you predict which are the next companies to make the transition from \\"good to great.\\"
B00005JLTN|4.0|I'm beginning to think that a lot of the people who bash the movie are forgetting one very important fact about this film. It is a SEQUEL. Being a sequel, it doesn't have to have as much story in it as the first. Of course there wasn't much character development, we already know the character form the first movie. If there was any more development to the base character, they would all be complaining about how it was nothing but a rehash of everything we already knew from the first movie. And let's face it, if you haven't seen the first Matrix, you have no business seeing the second. It's the equivalent of starting to read a book two hundred pages in and complaining about why you can't understand any of it.<br />For me, the movie was way better than I thought it would be. Sequels rarely ever live up to the original. Either they suck or they are so-so. It's almost certain doom for a movie just relating it to a good first movie. Even more so when there is a lot of hype surrounding it. I went to the theater expecting this movie to be a bomb because of those two facts. I wasn't expecting a lot, so I was blown away.<br />The downfall with this movie seems to come from the people who went in expecting it to be better than the first. Sorry folks, but that ain't gonna happen anytime in this universe. While Reloaded wasn't better than the first, it certainly ranks up there with being just as good.<br />Now, for someone that is actually praising it, you may wonder why I only rated it with four stars. There were some things I did have a problem with. The sex scene between Trinity and Neo. It seemed out of place with the overall feel of the movie. But even that can be forgiven. A coworker of mine explained her take on it as the scene showing the emotional struggle Neo is going through with his feelings for Trinity and his dreams. It made sense when she explained it the way she did.<br />The scene I had the biggest problem with was Neo fighting the Smith's. Effects wise, it was astunning scene. The metaphor behind it was pretty neat as well, using Smith as a virus that is spreading through out the Matrix. But it just got to the point where it was too long. And too fast. I found myself becoming disoriented with how fast the action was moving. To really be able to follow it, I had to let my eyes become unfocused and not try to concentrate on just Neo.<br />And, for the record, if you remember the end of the first movie, Neo flew then. He got off the phone and shot upwards. He is able to do this in the Matrix because being The One, he is essentially rewriting the code for the Matrix. He's not flying, he's just rewriting the program to allow himself to be able to do this.<br />In short, don't expect a lot from this movie before you see it. You'll only end up disappointing yourself. Do not expect it to be like the first and you should be just fine. It's a very good movie and one I highly recommend seeing.
B000002L75|5.0|This is one of the best albums of the decade, if not the best. This album couldn't be more brilliant, and, a rarity, is one of the minority of albums around in the music industry where the band took the care to include only top quality songs, no fillers. You just don't see albums like this anymore these days, and it's a shame. I consider &quot;It Doesn't Matter&quot; and &quot;Somebody&quot; two of Depeche Mode's best songs ever, and they're both right here. This album has completely stood the test of time and is a must-have in any serious music lover's collection.
B0000A02U2|5.0|This was the grandfather of all movies of this genre to come after it!  Although 25+ years ago this movie still has a knack to remain a fav of the new generations of college frat guys and sorority chicks!  From Belushi's crazy character &quot;Ox&quot; to &quot;Otis Day &amp; The Knights&quot; at the all Black club they all walk into, truly hilarious!
0385504209|5.0|The action, intrigue, and trail of puzzles in this book made The Da Vinci Code one of the best I've read this year. As long as you can willingly suspend disbelief when it comes to trails of &quot;hidden&quot; knowledge, this book will keep you turning pages all the way to the (not surprising at all by then) end.
B00003CXXM|4.0|The action in this flick is top notch. I only wish it was longer!
0380973464|5.0|Stephenson goes farther, deeper, juicier and funnier into a time and place in history. A mixture of fact and outrageous (but technically possible)speculation, Cryptonomicon is a whirlwind ride around the world and to a past era. This story is a new twist on the techno-thriller genre, making Tom Clancy look like a cub scout. Stephenson excites all the parts of your brain in this, one of my favorite novels of all time. You will not be bored.
B000002JB8|5.0|By far one of my favorite CD's. Great music to relax to. It takes me to the world of calm. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys high quality new age music.
B00005JLWN|5.0|This film grabbed my attention one boring night as I scrolled through pay per view on demand. And the night was no longer boring!<BR>From the very beginning the superb acting by Bale grabbed me and didn't let go. His portrayal of John Preston was so well done I could feel what Preston was going through. The sceen with the puppy made me weep. I am now a die hard Bale fan.<BR>Ignore the Matrix with all it's polticio b.s. and go for the raw meat that is human emotion - which is what this film is all about. The most dangerous thing we humans do is feel but it is also the most glorious. <BR>After watching this film (I watched it 3 times in the 24hrs. I had it available) I was first completely FLOORED, then saddened by the realization of what we humans do to each other, and finally elated by the realization of what we humans can do for eachother.<BR>Please do not miss this film.
055357342X|5.0|I have read many fantasy novels, and I'll admit some are pretty good.  You see, I am not a die-hard fantasy reader, but Martin's books became an exception.  Compared to other novels by other big name writers such as Jordan's \\"Wheel of Time\\" series that lost it's edge after the first two books, or Goodkind's \\"Sword of Truth\\" series which got too lame and corny as it progresses; Martin's books has it's way of grabbing your attention page by page.  And while other books stick to the classic \\"good guy, bad guy\\" theme, Martin's books gives life and growth to his characters so you will end up liking a bad guy, but hating a good guy.  Another attribute his characters seem to have (and it's contagious!) is backstabbing.  And of all three books, \\"A Storm of Swords\\" had the record of most backstabbings.<BR>But as I said, it is not for everybody.  Those die-hard fantasy fans looking for magic will be somewhat disappointed.  The books contains scenes of magic, dragons, the undead, and others but not much.  Another thing that people may not like is the violence.  Those readers not into blood, guts, and gore may not like it much, but it doesn't bother me a bit.<BR>So how does Martin do it?  Is it the characters?  The violence?  The intrigue?  I think it is the combination of all three plus more I didn't mention.  I can't wait for the \\"Feast\\".
B00006690G|5.0|Em shows versatility and maturity on his 3rd album.  Simply the greatest lyricist to grace rap music.
B000002NBY|5.0|I may like bands like Metallica, but I also enjoy this kind of music as well. When I had this album on tape about 9 or 10 years ago, I just couldn't stop listening. It  wore out eventually, but now I own the disc, and even at age 14, I still love this album, easily Paul Simon's greatest. He can play bass with true precision, he can sing very well, and, as I said before, is a true lyrical genius. A true classic.
1573301051|5.0|Celine was wonderful in this VH1 Save the Music.  Yes, Celine was the best of all the singers.  She made it come alive and not boring like some of the others.  Celine is my favorite singer.  And will always be.  The other singers were great to don't get me wrong but i still think Celine was the best.  Thank you Celine Dion, Gloria, and all the other singers for Helping Save The Music In School.  You all rock... :)
9686769013|5.0|I had read &quot;Demian&quot; by Hesse several years ago, and did not care for it. But I thought I would give him another try and picked up this book. I couldn't have made a better decision. This book has changed my life in ways, well, you only read about. Hesse gives a wonderful story about Siddharta from his earlier days through his old age. The book is a very quick, easy read. It makes the reader think about his/her own life in ways never before imagined.
B00008S2VG|4.0|This album is very good. Madonna proves again how she can be exceptional, mutable, different. Unlike most artists, she changes style as she change clothes in the show. She likes to take chances and that's good since artists in general are on the safe side.<BR>The lyrics aren't an exemple of literature and certainly won't be recommended at universities or schools. But who cares? The beat is great as well as the rhythm. And that's what really matters. At least, people go to discos and night clubs to dance.<BR>Some songs are boring. I'd say the songs are irregular. Few are very good, some are good, others OK and very few are boring (not exactly bad). So the outcome is above the avarage. It's a good album. This CD is very personal and everything is about her, including the title: her American Life. Some people are bothered by her &quot;selfishness&quot;, but just in case you are one of those people, don't listen to CD. Simple as that.
B00005JLSE|3.0|As a Fosse tribute, it's OK, but it brings nothing new to the genre.  It's basically warmed-over Fosse, which isn't much of a tribute.  The cynicism is depressing.  The numbers are powerful, but when every one is a calculated show-stopper, sooner or later the show pretty much stops.  Zeta-Jones won her Oscar for the same reason Liza Minnelli did -- her power as a singer.  Zeta-Jones' acting was merely passable compared to Zellweger -- and compared to Julianne Moore last year, they were both hard to take seriously.  The only pleasurable surprise is Richard Gere, who for the first time in his career doesn't strut his way through a performance.  Even though I did manage to sit through the movie in a theater and halfway enjoy it, I did find -- and see if you don't agree -- that it loses something on a TV screen.  Finally, if you want to see the state of movie musicals in the new millennium, take a look at Moulin Rouge (and Nicole Kidman), which deserved all the attention that Chicago somehow got instead.
B0000A02TZ|5.0|Time to empty those pockets and make some room on your video shelves 'cause Universal is releasing ANOTHER Animal House DVD.  In 1998 there was the \\"Widescreen Collector's Edition\\" and now we have the budget-priced \\"Double Secret Probation Edition\\".<br />The difference? The two previous editions of the film were marred by a weak picture transfer. Now we get a disc that boasts being \\"digitally remastered with better-than-original picture quality\\".  The viewer may now gain a superior print of the film but loses the handsome packaging of the '98 edition. Gone is the previous discs theatrical trailer, 4 page souvenir booklet and original movie poster artwork.  Apparently the 2003 editions gaudy packaging (or lack of)  will allow the customer to own this DVD for under [money maount].<br />Perhaps the next time Universal reissues this film we'll get a full length audio commenatry!
B00005JLSE|4.0|I'm probably the only person in the world who thinks that EVITA was the best modern day movie musical but anyway . . . This movie is excellent and as far as Art Direction, Film Editing, and acting this movie did deserve the Oscars it got however the singing was not very good.  People talk about how Queen Latifah really &quot;belted out&quot; that number.  As a voice major, I can tell you that that was not belting, but yelling.  You can tell she's really squeezing out those last few notes of the &quot;Mama&quot; song. And the dancing was, if you've seen the 1996 Broadway revival, really dumbed down for Rene Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones.  Especially in &quot;Can't do it alone&quot; and the final dance number of the movie it was more like choreographed movement, that even I could do, rather than real choreography that only trained people can do.  People said, &quot;WOW Richard Gere is really tap dancing.&quot;  Look closer.  He's really shuffelling his feet randomly and pulsing them on the floor as hard as he can with a little &quot;Dorthy's no place like home&quot; tap at the end.  Rene Zellweger in not a great singer and niether is John C. Reilly.  Richard Gere is worse (if he sang any harder through his nose, I would fear nasal constipation) and Catherine Zeta Jones, though the best overall, has a stong voice but no richness or fluency in her tone.
B000093BDX|5.0|Although I have not purchased this album, I do own over 20 Beach Boy/Brian Wilson Album so I feel like I have earned my right to voice my opinion.  The Beach Boys represent all that is right with music. One can feel the bubblegum harmonies of the first few albums, one can feel Brian Wilson's painful transition of growing up into a man i.e, late Summer Day's and Summer Nights!!! and of course Pet Sounds. The late 60's early 70's albums, such as Wild Honey,Friends,20/20 and Surf's Up were arguably the best Beach Boy era. The influence of Karl and Dennis when Brian was out of the mix is trully amazing.  Brian, Dennis and Karl were all masterful musicians.  Even though Brian gets labeled a &quot;genius&quot;, and rightfully so, we tend to leave out Carl's funky/soul writing of the mid 70's and Dennis' songs influenced by his tourchered heart. The sum of the Beach Boy's really did equal its parts.  Even Mike Love, the &quot;joke&quot; some might say really had a big role in developing the early albums of Surfin U.S.A, Surfin Safari and All Summer Long. Modern Day, the Beach Boys' influence can be seen much more than there counterparts,like the Beatles. I can go on and on about this band, but I just wanted to voice some random thoughts about &quot;Americas Band&quot; the group I like to think of as the Beach Boys!
0385504209|5.0|I wouldn't give this book a blanket recommendation, because some of the theology/history discussions and elements present might be a bit too controversial for some. But for those of us who like to question even our most firmly held beliefs, this book revisits some interesting themes and gives room for some deep thought.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed it myself. It had a good mix of suspense and history and art and theology. Kept me strung along til the end, too, with a complex, twisty plot and characters that I cared about.<br />However, I did feel a little let down with the ending, just seemed like he had to try to hard to end it. Too much happened too quickly in the last five-ten pages.<br />None the less, I plan to read some more of Dan Brown's books--and some of those listed in his bibliography too!

B0000AI44Q|4.0|I wanted to wait until after I had heard the studio Greendale a few times before I commented on it. First of all, it is difficult to isolate the CD seeing as how there are other aspects to the whole Greendale idea: the European acoustic tour (captured on the DVD that comes with this CD), the American tour with stage show and a cast of thousands, the website with multi-layered and multi-media aspects, and the art work on both the website and the CD. Also the future DVD(s) coming out in, possibly, September. \\"Greendale, the gift that keeps on giving.\\"<br />So, how do you isolate the CD in your mind? You don't. It is but just one aspect of the Greendale concept. In this way, I think it is unique in the Rock world even among past concept albums as The Who's Tommy, Pink Floyd's The Wall, Genesis' The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway, The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's, etc.<br />Some have commented elsewhere about the boring bass, drums and guitar on this album and lack of anything interesting musically. I can see how someone can get this impression. But it is more complicated, and simpler than that. I think this is a minimalist album. Neil strips the songs down to pure simplicity in order to bring the words, the narrative to the front. And the narrative is the key.  Indeed, most of the songs don't even have a chorus or a bridge, just a simple 2- or 3-chord progression that cycles over and over. Some of the songs sound alike. The drums and bass are \\"Rhythm Section 101;\\" the Rock idiom stripped down to the bare minimum. Still, a definite groove is created and finds it's way through the songs and the album.<br />Yesterday evening while I was watching my daughter in the pool, the sun was setting and I was listening to Greendale on the headphones. I was watching birds and planes fly across the sky while it turned to pink and red. 'Bringing Down Dinner' came on and it still brought tears to my eyes. This is Neil's strength; his emotional intelligence. He can turn a phrase and pack a wealth of emotion into just a few words. (more on that later) The line \\"What's Grandpa doin' on TV?\\" is just brilliant and<br />a perfect example of what I am talking about.<br />Neil has a lot to say here about the present situation in this country; the media, the giant corporations, the environment, the government, the war. All packed into a simple story of a little town. Sit back and enter the world of Greendale.<br />One more thing: it would get 5 stars from me if a little more time had been put into the recording, instrumentation, and refining the lyrics. Still, I think the end result was completely intentional on Neil's part.h of emotion into just a few words.

6301930827|2.0|Well I certainly hate to disagree with all the other glowing reviews of this movie but quite frankly I wasn't impressed.  Granted the movie (and subject matter) are dated but I found the acting to be only average, at times almost mechanical - not very realistic.  Not very good chemistry between De Mornay &amp; Boothe. The special effects could have been done better.  This movie probably had a low budget.<br />Sadly, I bought the movie based on the reviews posted here.  Do yourself a favor and rent it (if you can find it).  Had I rented it first I would have saved a few bucks.<br />Don't get me wrong, the movie will keep your attention but I found it to be fairly predictable.  Finding two pilots willing to make the ultimate sacrifice at the same moment seems a little far fetched !!!
B00005JLXE|4.0|A Film by Mark Steven Johnson<br />Daredevil is based on the Marvel comic book character.  Matt Murdoch (Ben Affleck) is a blind lawyer by day, but by night he is Daredevil, a vigilante crime fighter.  The movie opens and traces the origins of who Matt is and how he became blind, and later how he became Daredevil.  While this is not the main thrust of the story, it is essential storytelling to show us who this blind guy who runs around in a costume fighting bad guys is and how he got that way.  When he was a child, Matt was blinded by some toxic chemicals (aren't they all).  It took away his sight, but his other senses were heightened so much that Matt developed a sort of radar (sound waves reflecting off objects gives him a sense of where they are, much like bats).  When his father was murdered, Matt dedicated his life to helping those who could not protect themselves.  In the real world, this led to him becoming a lawyer and fighting for justice, but when the law does not work, he becomes justice himself and fights as Daredevil.<br />It is after this exposition that we get a chance to see what the story of the movie is going to be.  We meet Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner) in a caf&eacute; and Matt is interested enough that he tries to follow her.  Elektra doesn't want to be followed and they get into a little fight that is pretty much their courtship scene.  It is very well done and it gives us clues on how they get interested in each other.  While Elektra and Matt are getting more and more acquainted and friendly, the Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan) has put out a hit on the life of Elektra's father (Erick Avari).  Kingpin sends out Bullseye (Colin Farrell) to kill her father and in the process Bulleye ends up implicating Daredevil.  Elektra doesn't know who Daredevil is yet, and now Daredevil wants to take down Kingpin.  This is the major conflict of the movie.<br />Bullseye steals pretty much every scene he is in, but I don't feel that there is any exceptionally weak part of the movie.  Daredevil (the movie) isn't great, but it is a solid comic book movie and despite the backlash against Ben Affleck he actually does a credible job both as Matt Murdock and Daredevil.  Solid casting all the way through the movie. As a film, it was a little bit better than Spider-man.  It isn't as good as X-Men,  but this movie has been unfairly bashed.

0385504209|5.0|I started reading this book on Tuesday - what a mistake, because I had to go to work the next day and  wasn't able to put it down until very late at night! It was absolutely amazing! Suspense is enormous, and the chapters are short, so you just read them one by one without being able to stop... On the other hand, if you come to think of it, maybe it was not the plot that attracted me the most, but some supplementary information on symbolism, art, history etc - when reading, I just kept on promising myself I will look this stuff up on the internet - so astonishing it was to me (and I never thought I might be interested in that field).<br />Read it and share it with your friends!
0380807343|4.0|Of course, I bought it for them in the first place.  BUT, when I read it, it scared ME--and I think it would terrify THEM.  There's something so very realistic about the Other Parents, something that lives in the nightmares of every child, and putting words and illustrations to it only makes it worse. <BR>     The writing is terrific, the mood darker than the belly of a cow, and though the ending is satisfactory--even happy--there's a shivery feeling left behind.  <BR>     Of course, I still believe there are things under the bed, and in dark corners and at the ends of dark hallways, so perhaps I am not the best one to talk about frightening children. . . .

0743243307|5.0|Nazneen, a young bride married at sixteen to a 40-year-old man, is wrenched from the only life she has ever known in the countryside of Bangladesh and conveyed to England, where her new husband, Chanu, has a job.  Taught from the day of her birth that &quot;fighting against one's Fate can weaken the blood,&quot; or even be fatal, she accepts the miserably lonely existence that fate has bestowed on her in a London council flat.  Nazneen's only contact with home is the letters she exchanges with her sister Hasina, whose own fate back home in Dhaka changes throughout the fifteen years that this novel takes place.  Through these letters, author Ali shows the similarities and contrasts in the lives of Nazneen and Hasina, both subservient to their husbands, and, like other Bengali wives, powerless to control their fates in the culture in which they live.<br />With warmth and sensitivity, author Ali draws us into Nazneen's world, showing it in all its earthy details.  The reader sees her increasingly cluttered apartment, hears the constant excuses and boasts from Chanu, gets lost with her on a walk in the city, and feels Nazneen's confusion and frustration with the isolation of her life, as she continues to act the dutiful wife, cutting Chanu's corns and trimming his nose hair while planning mini-rebellions.  Her sister, eventually alone in Dhaka, struggles to support herself, doing whatever she has to do to stay alive in a culture in which her life has no value.  But, as their mother once said, &quot;If God wanted us to ask questions, he would have made us men.&quot;<br />Speaking directly to the reader in unpretentious but vividly descriptive prose, Ali recreates the minutiae of Nazneen's life, showing how the seemingly unimportant decisions she begins to make acquire new meanings in her life.  Through striking details, the reader watches her gradual acceptance of a new culture (which some would call &quot;growth&quot;), while her husband Chanu remains anchored in the traditions of the past. Her slow evolution is neither simple nor without conflict, and no member of the family escapes her transformation.  Brick Lane reveals the emotional conflicts and the subtle changes that occur when an immigrant sees the possibilities inherent in a new culture, radically different from the culture of the past, and begins to embrace it..  Step by inevitable step, Ali shows just how this process evolves, creating a vibrant portrait of a family in transition and of a woman coming into her own.  Mary Whippletraditions of the past.

0767803434|5.0|Air Force One, the 1997 summer hit directed by Wolfgang Petersen (The Boat/Das Boot, In The Line of Fire) and starring Harrison Ford as President James Marshall, stretches the term \\"willing suspension of disbelief\\" to its limits, yet, incredibly, it works.<br />Co-starring Gary Oldman, Glenn Close, Wendy Crewson, Liesel Matthews, William H. Macy, and Dean Stockwell, Air Force One's premise is simple: Russian ultra-Communist terrorists take over the President's plane on its way back to the U.S. from Moscow.  Marshall, who by happenstance is separated from his family and staff during the takeover, must use his military training (he's a former Air Force pilot) and his wits to regain control of Air Force One and rescue the hostages before the terrorists achieve their aims.<br />The terrorists, led by Ivan Korshunov (Oldman), are seeking the immediate release of General Alexander Radek (Jurgen Prochnow), who was snatched from his palace in Kazakhstan by a joint team of Russian and American Special Forces.  Radek and his followers believe in the restoration of the old Soviet Union, and until both Russia and the U.S. intervened, had ruled Kazakhstan with as much regard for human life as the Taliban exhibited when they ruled Afghanistan.  After a ceremony hosted by the grateful Russian President in which Marshall warns rogue nations and terrorists that \\"we will no longer be afraid. It's your turn to be afraid,\\" the American delegation heads to one of Moscow's main airports to board the Presidential plane.<br />Little do they know that Korshunov and his team, using falsified press credentials, have passed through both Russian and American security and are aboard.  Ironically, they are given a tour of Air Force One by the unsuspecting assistant press secretary, Melanie Mitchell  (Donna Bullock). And why not? To the Secret Service agents and the Air Force Security detachment, Korshunov and his people are reporters, harmless and unarmed. So how in the world are these guys going to storm Air Force One, \\"the most secure aircraft in the world?\\"  Hmmm....and why do Korshunov and Secret Service agent Gibbs (Xander Berkeley) exchange that glance as they pass each other, eh?<br />Petersen and screenwriter Andrew W. Marlowe never do explain Gibbs' motivations for his subsequent actions (as the director admits in the audio commentary track), but by the time audiences start asking those \\"real life\\" questions about plausibility, the sheer adrenaline rush provided by this action-packed film suppresses the \\"yeah, right\\" response to its premise.  The Air Force (which willingly participated in the production of this film) says there is no escape pod in Air Force One's list of defensive measures, and viewers know that no sane person, whether terrorist or not, is going to fire automatic weapons inside an airborne plane unless he or she knew the mission was going to fail anyway.<br />Mixed in with the gunfire and explosions that punctuate the film, Petersen and Marlowe endow their characters with depth and believability.  Petersen makes viewers care about each person being held hostage, warts and all, so that when one is lost,  it feels real.  Even Korshunov is played in such way that his motivations feel true and heartfelt, even if his cause is not just.<br />Yet Petersen and his cast and crew make audiences forget these dull real life facts.  By the time the credits roll to Jerry Goldsmith's rousing End Title Suite, the viewer will wish the current occupant of the Oval Office were replaced by Harrison Ford's President Marshall, who is not only a man of political integrity but also a man of action.to storm Air Force One, \\"the most secure aircraft in the world?\\"  Hmmm....and why do Korshunov and Secret Service agent Gibbs (Xander Berkeley) exchange that glance as they pass each other, eh?<br />Petersen and screenwriter Andrew W.

0783225881|5.0|Field of Dreams is a beautiful story which addresses two fundamental aspects of the American man.  One, of course, is the feeling of guilt and/or frustration over unsettled issues with one's father.  The issue seems to hit home with most men as most have experienced at least a temporary falling-out with the &quot;Old Man.&quot;  It also addresses the feeling of guilt and/or frustration over unsettled issues with one's self.  In Field of Dreams, Ray Kinsella (Costner) is haunted by things left undone.  He had broken from the relationship with his father and had quit the game he loved to spite his father who loved the game as well.  Kinsella never forgave himself for failing as a son--never getting the opportunity to make amends before his father's death.  When he builds a baseball field--the foundation of his childhood and his childhood-relationship with his father--he is afforded the opportunity to rest his demons.  It is the ultimate story of redemption and rejuvination.  I would say that if any man, or woman, does not love this film, they are simply not American.  But that isn't necessarily true.  If any man or woman does not love this film, he or she is simply not human.  This brilliant story appeals to all human emotions.  It is a true classic.
B000000Y59|5.0|All of Bill Evans' Riverside recordings are, in my opinion, classics - yes, even the 'alternate takes'. What make the alternate takes valuble to me is the chance to hear the sidemen (Scott LaFaro on bass and Paul Motian on drums) explore different melodies and solos. \\"Autumn Leaves\\" is a case in point here. As a musician myself, it is fascinating to hear the subtle differences between the stereo and mono takes and the different ideas by all three players. I must disagree with the previous reviewer who thinks that the \\"bonus\\" tracks are invalid both as music and marketing. Originally, when first reissued on a double LP entitled \\"Spring Leaves\\" - containing both single LPs \\"Explorations\\" recorded in 1961, and \\"Portrait in Jazz\\" recorded in 1959 - the \\"bonus\\" tracks were simply called \\"previously unissued\\", and included both the mono version of \\"Autumn Leaves\\" as well as a version of \\"The Boy Next Door\\". This was not a marketing ploy, as the double LP was very fairly priced and contained enough material without the added tracks. It was done for historical purposes and cleared by the artist. The stereo equipment had malfunctioned on the one - we will never know whether or not Bill Evans was or was not satisfied with the take, but it is true that Evans was not fully satisfied with \\"The Boy Next Door\\" and it was not included in the single LP \\"Explorations\\". Later, though, Evans would look back and be less critical, allowing these to be released as part of that Milestone \\"twofer\\". He also states plainly in the liner notes that he feels both of these LPs to be some of his best work. I concur. There is not one single track on \\"Portraits in Jazz\\" that dips below the highest standard. The near-telepathic communication between Evans and LaFaro has been well documented and is clearly heard on all tracks. Also, Paul Motian should never be underestimated, as his tastefullness is beyond question on this and every other recording with Evans and LaFaro. I do miss the 'alternate take', momo, of \\"Spring Leaves\\" on my single LP of Portraits I Jazz - which is in much better shape than the Milestone 'two-fer. I will say this: I cherish the Milestone re-issue because of the liner notes, which contain much information about both the men, the music, and a lengthy conversation with Evans regarding the time and the feelings associated with all the recordings. The 2-record set was released in 1976 and produced, as were the original single LPs, by Orrin Keepnews.
B00004W52U|5.0|Amazing! This album has changed my life, what more can i say.
B0000046ZJ|5.0|Certainly the previous reviewers have said it all, but I'll simply add that Getz' tone seems to actually benefit (or his playing does) from the lack of a percussionist - even though Herb Ellis' 4/4 may qualify - much as it did 3 decades later with Kenny Barron on &quot;People Time&quot;. No, this is even better. &quot;Pennies From Heaven&quot; is absolutely flawless with Stan soaring both before and, especially, after the key change. The &quot;Ballad Medley&quot; is gorgeous. Oscar plays perfectly under Stan when needed and doesn't overpower even when he could on his solos. Ray Brown and Herb Ellis fit like a glove. This was one of my favorite LPs, even though it was mono - but as a CD, in stereo, and with a whole 30 minutes of material that was not on the LP, it ranks as one of my top 10 out there. Beautiful!
B000002UAR|5.0|All i can say is WOW!  Even though i have listened to this album at least 200 times; each time i still find myself liking it more.  The number of strong songs on this album put it  definitely within the Beatles top 3 albums they ever made.  George Harrison does wonders for this album with his masterpieces of Taxman and Love You To.  I remember hearing Love You Too the first time and then hearing my tear drop hit my bathroom floor because the song was so beautiful.  I can only imagine how different this song was to the fans who bought this album when it was first released.  Lennon and McCartney had their fare share of beauties on this one too though.  I feel that Rubber Soul and Revolver are a major part in the rocknroll evolution of the 1960's and that Revolver is probably one of the top 5 albums of all time.

B000008COG|2.0|The producer team of George YOung and Harry Vanda came back for \\"Blow Up Your Video\\", and they truly succeeded in giving the band a raw, typical AC/DC sound reminiscent of the \\"Let There Be Rock\\" album.<br />The ten songs are generally good, according to AC/DC standards. The beat is steady and strong, courtesy of Simon Wright,a totally different drummer than Phil Rudd; Cliff Williams´s bass reached an all time low in the final mix, you can´t barely hear it. Johnson´s vocals never sounded so bad, totally obscured in the back of the mix, as if singing from another room ina big house. Very weird. The tunes, however, are definitely very good. (I´ll not talk about the lyrics, because, just when you think these guys, without Bon Scott, are beginning to be capable of writing better lyrics than \\"sex, sex, sex\\", how theyhad demonstrated in \\"FLICK OF THE SWITCH\\", they go back to the silliest lyrics ever.)

B00003CWL6|5.0|The image that got a lot of people interested in this film was that of Mena Suvari lying back in a bed of roses. What endeared it to sensitive souls was its' masterly use of score and mood. Sour-faced critics and others loved its' likeness to 60s satire- its pithy put-downs & side-swipes at the suburban 'American' dream. All these things are known about American Beauty- 'The Graduate' is its' closest forefather. But I would like to look closer. Spacey and Benings' performances have been praised enough- but this is an ensemble film. Thora Birch, Mena Suvari and Wes Bentley are all excellent. What? the critics might say. Sure, they're ok at highlighting the vacuous of American youth but they're not that interesting- that's what they're thinking. This utterly fails to understand what American Beauty is about. By that criteria, the adults are just as vacuous- concerned with a sofa, their body, the car, the house, the image. It is more complicated than that. Chris Cooper's character's repression manifests itself in heavy-handed discipline. We see his  wife, kind but blank,  as blank as Lester Burnham  is beginning to feel, just as Bening cries in quiet desperation. Ricky Fitz tries to find meaning in art and nature and, in him, Janie has found somebody who mirrors her own dark nature but who, to her, seems to have an overwhelming confidence in his own abilities- confidence she lacks for she is a suburban rebel, discontented at herself and her parents more than the world at large- she is part of the Nirvana generation. Like the others, she craves personal happiness. What we see in the film is how adults can become radical while their children are conservative and vice versa- tension rides throughout the film  punctuated by violence, sex and dark humour. But those who purely see it as a damning indictment on sleepy suburban mall-going America are forgetting that, throughout, it shows you that there is beauty, emotion, and dreaming in the apparently mundane , like an EdwardHopper or Rene Magritte painting. It's intelligent, light, dark, sexy and funny.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I was totally blown away when I finished seeing this awesome animated movie at the big screen. I thought that the \\"Toy Story\\" movies could not be topped but \\"Shrek\\" proved me wrong. \\"Shrek\\" surpassed Pixar's previous movies and today, it is already a much-beloved classic. I don't know how they do but Pixar have managed to create a truly original story every time they make a movie. Not only that , their movies have had the fun and welcoming atmosphere to appeal to younger audiences yet also have enough sophistication and dialog to win over the adult audience and \\"Shrek\\" is one of the shining examples of such movies.<br />On this round of animated Disney fun, the typical fairy tale storyline is severely warped into a charmingly funny adventure starring a modestly unfriendly green Ogre named Shrek played by Mike Myers, a loquacious donkey played by none other than than the eccentric comedian actor Eddie Murphy, whose role in this rejuvenated his career which was going through a stagnant stage with turkey after turkey (\\"I Spy\\" anyone?), and a princess named Fione played by Cameron Diaz.<br />The story begins with a huge solitary Ogre named Shrek who has enjoyed most of his life in peace alone on his swamp/home. However, the harmony of isolation is completely destroyed when one night, all of the Disney characters such as Cinderella, Snow White and her Seven Dwarfs, Tinkerbelle, and Pinocchio, are banished from their homelands and to Shrek's utter horror and dismay, to his very own swamp, which he hates sharing with others thanks to a tyrannical royal kind names Lord Farquaad. Back at his dungeon-like castle, Farquaad seeks to become king but his ambitions have hit a brick wall time and time again because he has to marry a princess in order to do so. Back at the swamp, Shrek tries to drive the cartoon exiles off his swamp but eventually gives in, and decides to confront Farquaad to return the `cartoon exiles' back to their homes. Along the way, Shrek meets a loquacious, eccentric donkey along the way whose talkative ways get on Shrek's nerves but in the end a strong friendship forms between the two as they go up against numerous forces to return the exiles back to their homes.<br />During that time, Shrek has to rescue a princess named Fione from a horrible dungeonlike castle that is guarded by an extremely `dangerous' dragon that breaths fire in order to `regain' his swamp back from the exiled beings. But from there, the so called fairytale is completely warped into a comedic adventure full of fun, laughs, and excellent storylines. But not only those make this movie great, it also has a highly important message about what true love really is about that personality is far more important than physical appearance and I tell you, it is for this reason taht \\"Shrek\\" is in fact, not only a great and fun movie, but also an important must-have for the ages. I tell you, even if it buts heads against \\"Monsters Inc.\\" or \\"Finding Nemo\\" as my favorite animated movie, there is no denying that \\"Shrek\\" ushered in a new golden age in animated moviemaking. Please buy this awesome movie. It's absolutely worth every rusted penny!eccentric donkey along the way whose talkative ways get on Shrek's nerves but in the end a strong friendship forms between the two as they go up against numerous forces to return the exiles back to their homes. <br />During that time, Shrek has to rescue a princess named Fione from a horrible dungeonlike castle that is guarded by an extremely `dangerous' dragon that breaths fire in order to `regain' his swamp back from the exiled beings.

B00000BKE0|4.0|Molti fans della band inglese, ritengono che questo sia uno degli album peggiori della carriera degli Iron Maiden. Il perchè? Il perchè è sicuramente da ricercarsi nel cambio di rotta che la band affrontò all'epoca. Sicuramente l'introduzione di Janick Gers come sostituto di Adrian Smith può spiazzare, ma tutti i brani sono stati composti prima della sua acquisizione. <BR>In questo disco vediamo, come accennavo poc'anzi, la band cambiare orizzonti musicali. L'abbandono il PROG dei due album precedenti a favore di un &quot;ritorno&quot; al sound delle origini si concretizza con brani decisamente più corti rispetto al passato, ma non per questo privi del tipico mordente degli Iron Maiden.<br />01.TAILGUNNER - Un inizio solido e compatto che mette in evidenza da subito il nuovo suono della band. 4/5<br />02.HOLY SMOKE - Gli Iron Maiden all'opera con una tematica diversa ci propongono un brano estremamente rock dal quale traspare comunque il loro stile. Estremamente godibile. 3,5/5<br />03.NO PRAYER FOR THE DYING - In assoluto uno dei brani migliori dell'intero disco. Melodico ma aggressivo, riflessivo ed esplosivo. Un ulteriore passo avanti nella stesura delle liriche ora più intimiste e mature. Ottima Title Track. 5/5<br />04.PUBLIC ENEMA #1 - Un assalto chitarristico dalla luminosa belezza. Il chorus esplode accompagnato dall'ottimo bridge. Un brano costruito in maniera impeccabile. 4/5<br />05.FATES WARNING - L'anello di congiunzione tra il disco precedente e questo. Dall'intro delicata all'esplosione del riff fino all'ottimo chorus. 4/5<br />06.THE ASSASSIN - Complesso e discretamente poco orecchiabile. Puro Maiden Style in crescita. 3,5/5<br />07.RUN SILENT RUN DEEP - La cavalcata di terzine che scoppia dopo l'intro non sorregge questo brano che pare a mio avviso un ottimo scarto da qualche disco precedente. Svogliato ma godibile. 2,5/5<br />08.HOOKS IN YOU - Un riff coinvolgente opera del compianto Adrian Smith. Un brano che continua la saga di Charlotte... Peccato per la voce decisamente sottottono di Bruce. 3,5/5<br />09.BRING YOUR DAUGHTER... - Personalmente la ritengo la canzone più debole di tutto il disco. Un rock fin troppo poco studiato per garantire anche solo l'impatto. Dal vivo può essere coinvolgente, ma in disco perde tutto, risultanto sterile. 1/5<br />10.MOTHER RUSSIA - Gli Iron Maiden tornano forzatamente (pare) alle atmosfere complesse e sopra le righe di RIME OF THE ANCIENT MARINER, passando per ALEXANDER THE GREAT e schiantandosi su SEVENTH SON OF A SEVENTH SON. Questo è Mother Russia. Sopra le righe, complesso ma godibile. Forse sottovalutata in quanto posta in chiusura... Da rivalutare. 4/5<br />In conclusione un album buono, lontano ovviamente dai vecchi exploit ma comunque gradevole e dal ritmo incalzante.
B00005JKZV|4.0|While it didn't adhere as faithfully to the book as most LOTR fans would like.  The Two Towers is still an incredible movie experience.  Andy Serkis' perfomance of Gollum alone is worth the price you pay for the DVD.  The special effects are top notch and blend seamlessly with the action and the storyline.  This stands in stark contrast with the recent Star Wars films whose digital worlds seem sterile and the special effects seem like a desperate attempt at a distraction from the bad acting and weak plot.  Unlike most action/adventure fare that is released today The Lord of the Rings trilogy actually has dynamic characters that the become intimate with the audience and a storyline that quickly engrosses the viewer.
B000084T18|5.0|This album is hot..best track  is number 2 \\"what up gangsta\\"...when is Em gonna make another album?..its been a year and a half already.
6305308659|5.0|If I could pick any time to live in, it would be the 50's. A time of innocents and family life. I completely relate to Tobey's character and everything in the film comes in the perfect time and is almost politicle, representing change in generation and family also conflicting with affairs. In a way the film is allegorical but practically every character in the movie changes, making them all the main character. Don Knotts had a nice cameo also.<BR>Overall I give the film an A+ with it's combination on style of todays generation and yesterdays generation and conflicts along with coming of age and romance.<BR>Perfectomundo. A pretty &quot;swell&quot; film.
B000092ZYX|5.0|I got hooked on Radiohead after &quot;Just&quot; came out on MuchMusic. Ever since then I've been a huge fan of the band. After OK Computer, they said they would go in a completely different direction. But if you take a listen to all the albums (Pablo Honey to Hail to the Thief), you can definetly hear an evolution from straight out rock to the experiment rock, I guess, they're doing today. Kid A was amazing, Amnesiac was ok, but in my opinion, not as good. Now, we have Hail to the Thief.<br />A simply amazing album.<br />They've brought back some rocking guitars (2+2=5, Scatterbrain) but also stick with the crazy ambient stuff (Backdrifts, in particular).<br />People on here who give the album a bad review seem to have two recurring complaints. The political statements, and the album not being The Bends or OK Computer. First, who cares about the politics. And second, it would be incredibly difficult to recreate The Bends or OK Computer, and why would Radiohead want to do that anyway? Radiohead have always been a crazy, weird band, but their fans wouldn't want them any other way.<br />So in conclusion, if you haven't bought this album, do it. You won't be disappointed.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Donnie Darko is the most ferociously independent movie i've ever seen.  It has more plot twists and suprises than most people are ready for but, for people who like to watch a movie that they actually have to put some effort in understanding and keeping up with Donnie darko is perfect.  You will not be able to get it all at first(It will probably take many viewings for you to understand everything). Everytime you will be interested and compeled. <br />     Donnie is a six-teen year old boy from suburban Virgina.  In addition to having anger problems(for which he is taking medication) he is continually seeing a demonic 6ft. reptile-like bunny.  Who tells him the world will end in one month.  That night a 2,000 lb. jet engine falls on his bed(which was empty do to The Bunny Frank leading him out his room and onto a public golf course).  Over the course of the next month he oberves the world around him and begins to question the universe's boundaries.  After the climax of the action where 3/4 of the films questions are answered Donnie has to make the descion of saving himself or mostly everyone else he knows.  I'm not going to give away the ending but Frank was right about the world ending in one month.<BR>    Besides being an indie( which gives it atomatic respect from me) The movie has the best message of any movie ever made ( i would know since i've been through a great deal of them ).  There is no other movie that will leave you feeling like you have just been on such a journey, or that you will get more out of.
B00009MGQL|1.0|First let me say that I'm a hugh Jeff Beck fan.  I have all his cds.  The last cd was pretty bad but this is pure noise.  I can honestly say I couldn't get through this cd.  It was starting to give me a headache.  Beck plays real fast riffs against drum machines.  There is all kind of stuff going on hear but none of it is music.  Go back and listen to the Yardbirds, the Jeff Beck Group, Blow by Blow etc.  Leave this one alone unless you lie noise that makes no sense what so ever.  What was he thinking?
B0000AUHPG|5.0|Sergio Leone managed to cement himself in fim history, when Once Upon A Time in The West was released. The film stars, Claudia Cardinale, Henry Fonda, Jason Robards, and a very underatted Charles Bronson. The shots and scenes are long, and very creative. The movie is very involving, and every time Charles Bronson is on screen, the mood is immediately lightened up. The visuals are stunning, and the story about revenge is brilliant. Leone used flashbacks, and quick, smart dialogues to keep up the suspense. Although many people may find that this movie runs a little too long, it is definitely a milestone in filmmaking. Also a mention to the ever consistent Ennio Morricone's beautiful score, like the unforgettable and haunting harmonica theme. I'm glad that this film is being released on DVD, as it should have a while ago. This a definitely a must have film for your collection.
B00005JKZV|2.0|I picked up the movie on the day of release. This is NOT a true animorphic transfer. Normally you would expand (or your TV would) a DVD signal horizontally to pop the image into 16:9.<br />HOWEVER, this version of LOTR 2 Towers requires that you, or your TV, expand the image horizontally, and then again vertically. This is basically a cheap way for New Line to fit the whole movie on one DVD. Buyer Beware ! Wait for the 2 DVD version for a true animorphic transfer.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Yes, yes this is one of the greatest albums ever made. Don't try to be a snobbish critic and say they could have done better. This album is amazing. The music is multi-layered at all times, and has so much depth that I'm still hearing new things, listening to it a year later.  It's incredible.  I saw them twice live, and they're just an amazing band that produced an amazing product.  Buy it :)
B0000AI44Q|5.0|Greendale paves new ground for Neil.  Once again, he has drifted from earlier styles and melodies.  Be the Rain is an especially compelling track, complete with first-rate back-up vocals.  Neil Young fans will not be disappointed in this newest release.
B0000AOV85|4.0|If you are a Floyd nut this is a great album for you. If you are just a listener, this isn't for you because it involves all the details of how the record was put togather and RW's phil behind the whole thing. Waters has an interesting version of the Brain Damage song on acoustic guitar. I thought the production of the DVD was pretty bad considering that instead of having the musicians actually complete playing the instrument they are being filmed with, the producers switch to the record version. We have all heard the record version, why not allow the musicians to do their own thing in their own little studios, instead of layering what they are playing with the original version from the album. Most of the &quot;footage&quot; are stills or have been taken from previous video releases. So, other than the guys speaking, there is nothing phenomenal about the DVD excepting that you get to hear a lot of early Roger demos of the thing on spool tape. Interesting things are also Alan Parson's engineering explanation of the songs. Its nostalgic and interesting to see that these guys are all old men now. Gilmour with Glasses! Roger is the only guy ageing gracefully!
B0000A02U2|5.0|Is anyone else having problems with skipping on the DVD Edition? I have a player that has performed flawlessly, except for the two DVD's I purchased yesterday, Animal House and Vacation. Both skipped. I have not tried a second player yet.
B0000AOV85|4.0|I remember exactly were I was when I heard DARK SIDE OF THE MOON. It was my freshman year of high school and some upper classmates were doing a project on culture from each decades in the 20th century and one kid was pumping music from the 70s into the hallways. I caught the very end of \\"Speak To Me\\" that leads into \\"Breathe\\". I wanted to stay right there and listen to the rest of the album but, sadly, had to go to class. About a week later I bought the album and haven't looked back since. Of course I had heard \\"Time\\" and \\"Money\\" on the radio before but never in the confines of the album.<br />This DVD is what I have been waiting for. I've read many books about Pink Floyd and love when band members recount the process of recording these songs so this documentary is made for me. Every one of the band members has a great respect for the time in which the album was made. Many of them perform bits of the songs right there and then for the cameras. Fabulous technical information and insight is brought to the album.<br />I've taken one star off the rating because of one disapointment and one wish-they-did. Although the packaging states \\"track by track\\" two of these were not mentioned anywhere: \\"Speak To Me\\" (I could understand this one because it's basically effects) and \\"Any Colour You Like\\". Also, although the bonus features almost double the documentary, this would have been a great place to put an early (then called ECLIPSE) DARK SIDE OF THE MOON live performance. I know they had the footage, bits and pieces are presented throughout the documentary.
B000001FA4|5.0|While &quot;Joshua Tree&quot; is probably U2's most universally acknowledged album, this is their best, both in musicianship and originality.  The Edge has sometimes sounded better, but has never before or since been able to get the beautiful sounds from his guitar that he did here.  Bono has also never sung so nicely.  Mullen's drumming is more than adequate.  Clayton...well...Clayton has never added much to the band in my opinion, but he does only what he needs to, which is good.  Eno's production is fantastic.<br />&quot;Pride&quot;, which is one of U2's most famous tunes, is the tamest of all the songs.  &quot;A Sort Of Homecoming&quot;, the title track, and a host of other songs make you feel like you could float away.  &quot;Wire&quot; is just an insane hodgepodge of guitar harmonics and rhythms that completely boggle one's mind.  The song is the opposite of the aforementioned but has the same cathartic effect by the time its over.  &quot;Bad&quot; is an indisputable classic. This is a must-own for all rock fans and fans to true alternative music.

B000063JZQ|5.0|I'm not sure I agree with the statements that this is Polanski's personal adaptation of Macbeth.  While the incidents in his life at that time undoubtedly had an affect on his rendering of Macbeth, I contend that Macbeth was always a gloomy story, and perhaps it was the that element of the story that drew Polanski rather than Polanski creating a gloomy story out of Macbeth.<br />That having been said, this is a fantastic film.  It is extremely dark, at times shockingly brutal, but true to the play.  The costumes are great, and the dirty, dusty castle setting is accurate for the era.  There are very few lines that have been disregarded, and the dialogue does not embellish or add to Shakespeare's classic.  Nobody has, before or since, had the gonads to really emphasize the darker elements of Shakespeare while staying true to the play.  &quot;Titus&quot; tried, but inserted too much modern-day silliness to be considered a serious endeavour.  This is as true to the play as it can get, and doesn't apologize for it.  If you can get past the violence and the sometimes cheesy 70s background music, you will love it.  In addition, its gloomy atmosphere and violence might actually have the added benefit nowadays of interesting kids in The Bard.
B00005JKZV|1.0|My name is anonymous because I don't feel like losing my life over an opinion.  The Lord of the Rings is a repeat of Star Wars.  Why?  Because they both use mindless killing and war to solve their problems.  This is entertainment?  Why do people enjoy watching people (mainly men) get kill?<br />All my life I have been trying to figure this out.  So, 20 years ago when I was 29, I shut my trap and let the people enjoy this mindless junk.  It was wrong of me to judge others.  Yet, in these past 20 years this seems to apply only one way.<br />Whenever a film is made that makes war look like hell and something to avoid it is condemn.  Four Television series in the past 4 years were cancel because they cross that line.<br />But to keep this short I will simply point out that \\"Close Encounters of The Third Kind 1977-1980\\" seems to be the last popular movie that had no killing or taking revenge.  (ET does not apply to this situation.)<br />Sure, Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings are both fantasy but they make war look like entertainment.  This is so far from the truth but yet millions seems to enjoy it.  Unless you turn the sex around.<br />It's popular to have women carrying weopens and killing the bad guys (which are alway men) but try turning that around and see how the movie would be ban from the theaters.<br />Well, it would not matter to me even if it was only women who were being gun down the violence and the hate would still be there.<br />I do not know why these type of shows our so popular.  We claim we want voilence off our streets yet we enjoy watching movies which points out that war is the answer to any problem.
B00000720W|5.0|I love this cd. I've been listening Mayhem for several years, and so far I think this is one of their best works. Primitive and raw music. One more thing, I would like to inform to that redneck in PA that said that Maniac was part of Mayhem on this cd that he is so wrong. Dead was singing on this cd. And by the way Maniac will never be better that Dead.
B000002HRE|3.0|This isnt metallicas best, but its still pretty good.I dont get why people say this album sucks, because it does NOT suck.Sure its no master of puppets, but it deserves some credit.The best song on this album is probably fuel, or the memory remains.The unforgiven II is pretty good too.I just wish there was country guitar riffs on this album.I'll tell ya one thing, its a hell of a lot better than st. anger!Anyway, all in all, i'd say this is a pretty decent album,just not their best.Really listen to it, and you'll see what I mean.Not as good as load,but good.
B000089CJI|5.0|It's Dashboard Confessional meets electronica.  And let me tell you, it's amazing.  It hasn't left my CD Player in months.  <BR>Make sure you check out tracks 2 and 10.
B00005A46T|5.0|THIS C.D IS SO FULL OF JUST RAW HATRED. COREY TAYLOR SINGS HIS INSIDES OUT ESPECIALLY AT THE BEGINNING ON THE FIRST SONG, HE'S JUST AMAZING THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE THING. I RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM TO ANY HARD ROCKERS, GO OUT AND GET IOWA IT'S EVEN MORE AMAZING THAN THEIR SELF TITLED C.D \\"SLIPKNOT\\" BUY THIS C.D IT KICKS SERIOUS [butt] AND YOU'LL BE ROCKIN EVEN ON THE SLOWER SONGS!
B00009TB5G|4.0|Peter Jackson keeps rolling where he left off in The Two Towers. This is another epic, visually stunning film. As a hardcore fan of the books, I'd say the story stays true enough to be acceptable. I do have a few gripes:<br />-Why make did PJ make Faramir such a jerk? That was a real bummer.<BR>-What was with the cliff scene at the Black Gate? Cheesy.<BR>-Merry tricks the Ents into trashing Isengard? Gimme a break.<br />But only full on LOTR geeks (like myself) will care about this stuff. The rest of you can just sit back and enjoy the ride.
B00005JM02|5.0|I don't know which movie the critic saw who only gave it one star.<br />'Finding Nemo' is just awesome! The animation, humor and of course Ellen DeGeneres as Dory is high class all the way through the movie. It has all the ingredients that make a Disney movie so special.<br />There was a lot of humor in the interacting of the characters, and I do hope that Ellen DeGeneres will be asked to lend her voice to more Disney characters in future projects.<br />In my opinion, this movie deserves a place on the DVD shelf of any fan of Disney Films, right next to the equally great and funny 'Lilo and Stitch'.<br />'Finding Nemo' is a movie you can watch over and over, and never tire of.
0920668372|5.0|I think it's great to be able to let our children know that we can love each other so much. I have yet to read this book without breaking down, but now that my oldest son is eight, I just hand it over to him and he finishes for me.  I've told the kids that it's such a nice book it makes my heart overflow and they think it's funny watching it get 'full'. The funniest thing I've found is that the notion of the mother crawling into that grown up man's window was scary for them... not because she was breaking and entering, but because that man moved away from his mother! We all love this story.
B000089RVX|5.0|Often when I buy a CD I end up only liking a few of the songs on it.  Not so with Fallen!  I've had it in my car and have listened to it non-stop for the past few weeks.  It's better than anything I've found on the radio in the mornings, and I like every single song.
055357342X|4.0|This was easily the best book of this series.  After forcing my way throught the second book, I was convinced that Martin was really Robert Jordan in disguise, but after reading the third installment of this slow to publish series I felt much better.  It appears that Martin is only getting ADVICE from Jordan, rather then actually being Jordan.  The plot moved along very well in this book, the new character viewpoints were interesting and made the book all the better and best of all, almost everyone named &quot;Stark&quot; gets killed off or at the very least, develops a personality.  In all seriousness, while there are many characters in this book, the only interesting ones are Tyrion, Jon Snow and Danaerys.  I hope the fourth book is just about them or at the very least, omits all references to women named Stark.  Unfortunately, in order to read the interesting, we also read the dull.  <br />    I expect that the fourth book may come out while I am still young enough to have the use of my eyes, but I won't count on it.  While I did enjoy the book, I will enjoy them all the more as soon as it becomes apparent that there is an end in sight.  While authors and publishers may think that they are getting their money's worth from hacks like Jordan, Goodkind and dare I include you in this category Mr Martin, these never ending long running series will only hurt the genre in the long run.  As editors are constantly forced to pore through endless and mindless tomes of repetitive fantasy text, the one or two authors with actual original ideas will most likely get left out in the cold.<br />    Read this book.  It's fun, but don't expect too much from the future.
B00005KFUN|5.0|This album.... What can i say. This is a band that makes music worth listening to.If anybody were to say that this was not a great cd they should be shot.The piano,guitars,and vocals are all done by one person and the Drums ?What can i say there my favorite and only you can judge them for yourselves But it escapes me why yu could not like them.<BR>BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1400034779|5.0|At first glance, the writing in The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency seemed simple.  But after a few pages, I realized that the simplicity of narrative was deceptive.  I believe it was the author's intention to give us his story as a proficient speaker of English, native to Botswana (where the story takes place) might tell it.  The net result is beguiling and evocative of the culture.  I was left feeling that I'd spent some time in Botswana, that I'd learned something of the people and place.<br />Precious Ramotswe, the author's protagonist, is a woman no longer young, but hardly old, one of substantial girth, highly intelligent, worldly wise and not afraid of much.  Having inherited a sum of money from her father, Mma Ramotswe decided to do something unexpected of a woman in Botswana and open a detective agency.<br />This first series entry is really a series of interlaced short stories that tells us a great deal of the people, the place and Mma Ramotswe's background.  In the course of the novel, she solves a number of mysteries and we see her intelligence and integrity at work.  It doesn't take long for a reader to love this woman who has known pain and suffering and has become compassionate and committed in the process.<br />By the end of the novel, I was thoroughly appreciative of this author's prose and I regard him as a master storyteller.  Each sentence made me want to read the next one, and before I knew it, I'd reached the end of the book.  Today I'm buying the rest of the series and I sincerely hope the author will give us more.  Alexander McCall Smith pays tribute to Agatha Christie in this novel and were Ms. Christie still alive, I'm sure she would highly approve of Mr. Smith!<br />(By the way, \\"Mma\\" and \\"Rra\\" are titles of courtesy and respect in Botswana, equivalent respectively to \\"Ma'am\\" and \\"Sir\\" when used alone or \\"Ms.\\" and \\"Mr.\\" when used before a surname.)
B00003CXZ1|3.0|...but nothing spectacular.  You'll like it if you liked the Indiana Jones films; it's a good adventure and it never becomes completely boring, but it does have its moments.  I found myself dozing in the theater when I saw it.  It's a good adventure flick, though, with lots of action, a good cast, a good plot and good acting.  Rent it before buying though; it's not for everybody.
B00006HBUC|5.0|The kids absolutely LOVE this movie!  We went to see it in the theater when it came out and they HAD to purchase the video!  The characters fit their roles perfectly!  My favorite is Shaggy, he is so real compared to the cartoon!  This is a great movie to make your kids laugh and yourself as well!
B000035Z1Z|5.0|I completely disagree with the above editorial review by Keogh(and hardly because I like everything I see). Meg Ryan and Kevin Kline are both very good, both individually and together. I suggest that the strength of Ryan's performance is due in large part to her working opposite Kline, as well as to her role's calling for her to be more intelligent and sarcastic than when she's opposite Hanks. NOT being a speaker of French, I found Kline's accent a pleasing asset rather than annoying. My wife and I agree that this is one of the better modern romantic comedies.
B0000A02U2|4.0|I have no qualms with the movie. My problem is with the DVD. No book or anything on the inside. What is up with that? It just takes a DVD that I purposefully waited for a special edition and makes it a little less special.
0440211727|5.0|This is the 2cd grisham book I read (after the firm).  I loved it.  Full of detail, emotion.  It left you asking the very same question, what would you do if i was your child.  I could really get inside the characters they were deep and REAL.  A must read.
B00005JLSE|5.0|I saw the movie, I saw the play, and I bought the movie.  Rene is spectacular.  Queen Latifah was better than the actress I saw in Broadway.  Richard Gere was magnificent.  The movie is almost exactly as the show in Broadway.  If I had to choose between Moulin Rouge  and Chicago (since I read the comment comparing it to Moulin Rouge,) I would have to declare a tie.  I am so happy that the draught for musicals is over. I have been a big fan of musicals since I can remember.  I hope that more producers take the risk to bring more musicals to the big screen.  Not everyone has the chance to go to NY often, and see a Broadway show, but Hollywood can make it possible bringing that Broadway show to the big screen.
044022165X|4.0|Enough detail and emotion to carry you through.  You really get into the characters and the story is great!  I hold back 1 star because the firm and a time to kill were a little better.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|I didn't see this film until I was an adult. So my perspective on this film is not due to fond memories from childhood. When I first saw this film about 8 years ago, I thought it was an excellent film. The film is a classic. Having viewed several of Disney's animated films, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is one Disney's finest. The only Disney film that slightly edges out Snow White I feel would be Pinocchio. The colors and depth seem more intense in Pinocchio. Snow White is definitely a film for adults and their children. The 7 dwarfs provide different personalities that children can relate. This new set of Snow White offers a second DVD which provides the Snow White history and a game for children to play which is related to the story and the Dwarf's mine. The print is excellent. No flaws and colors are rich. Worth buying on DVD. A film that your children will watch dozen of times I'm sure. A true classic and is much better than many of the new run of the mill films that the Disney Company seems to be churning out these days. The Disney classics when Walt Disney was alive are the true classics that adults and their children can watch together (Snow White, Pinocchio, Peter Pan, Mr Toad, Alice In Wonderland etc...) I recommend this film.
B00005JKZV|5.0|I, being of sound mind and body (I hope), do declare that I have seen TLOR : TWO TOWERS at the movies, and now on DVD in the privacy of my own home, without harm to myself or others. No long dead author was heard turning in his grave, nor did the World stop spinning as I unashamedly revelled in Peter Jackson's grand cinematic portrait of Middle Earth. The same goes for FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING - viewed without harm to mind or body. The world did not end, darkness did not fall, and the Gods did not strike me down. <br />This time.<br />All this and more may well have come to pass if the Tolkien PURISTS are to be believed. Their wails of despair echo through these reviews (infrequently), rising from the mire of joyous 5 star rave reviews like Ring Wraiths looking to score a labotomy. Knives are sharpened, poison pens are readied, all seeking the demise of the man who dared to breathe new life into Tolkien's vision - a vision that sadly came to fruition long before it was possible to bring it to life on the big screen.<br />Beware the fanatics my friends, beware those that cannot accept that they are no longer alone, that their PRECIOUS literary masterpiece has been torn from their clinging hands and thrust into the light of day for millions to enjoy. Are they bitter, are they jealous, or has somone forgotten to tell them that its only a book? A fantastic book, a book so grand in its conception and ultimate telling that few rival it, but a book none-the-less.<br />Sad but true. <br />I've read TLOR and loved every page, every elgantly painted moment of imagination and yet I found the courage from somewhere to embrace the movies too, to accept the fact that they would not be entirely faithful to the Great Work, as if they ever could be. I used that most useful of our evolutionary assests, my brain, and came to find the truth of it all - that the movies are a separate entity unto themselves, and cannot - SHOULD NOT - be compared word of word, scene for scene with their printed forebears.<br />Film studios don't have enough money to make a LOR movie that adheres exactly to the novels, nor would people have the courage required to sit through such a movie. Anyone that can't work this out - these so called \\"purists\\" - are as stated: Deaf, Dumb and Blind. Perhaps instead of fretting over how Peter Jackson (AKA GOD) has butchered their beloved masterpiece, they might want to crawl out of their dim dark caves, stand upright and face the REAL WORLD head on. Try it - go on, I dare you.<br />Do I seem bitter, angry at the few and far between members of society that have decried Jackson's epic? Yes, I am. I admit it unashamedly. I try to be tolerant, I really do, but sometimes I just can't take it, and I have to vent my frustration with those among us that just don't understand that there are more important things in life other than whether or not Peter Jackson adapted TLOR word for word.<br />On a more base level, and by way of a Public Health Warning, I also want to wring the necks of anyone whore DARES refer to Peter Jackson as an Aussie - for those of you who are geographically challenged (ignorant) or live in Hicksville USA, he's a New Zealander (we're the little slice of paradise - AKA Middle Earth - just to the east of Australia). The Aussies are responsible for those dreary Star Wars and Matrix sequels / prequels - shot by US directors I might add. We New Zealanders on the other hand, have only the LOR movies to be proud of, directed by one of our own.<br />So, to my point. Purists be damned. These movies are just that - movies. Books are books, movies are movies. A literal translation of TLOR books to the big screen would be IMPOSSIBLE, so why the hell are people whining about it? Can't they just go and sit in a corner with all the Star Wars fans and scratch their eyes out like everyone else and pretend it didn't happen?<br />My suggestion therefore, for those troglodites still clinging to a zealous, PURITANICAL view of Tolkien's vision: GET A LIFE!!! The movies will never surplant TLOR's place in literary history - how could they? What they do however accomplish, is to capture the essence of what Tolkien wrote about, the FEEL of good and evil, of Light and Dark. All that is good about Tolkien's work is reflected in Jackson's own, and if you can't look past the sometimes obvious liberties he's taken and see the soul of the movies, then I don't relly think you're a true Tolkien Fan.<br />There's a good reason why the vast majority of people that have seen these movies have been ensnared by them. Its because they do capture what Tolkien envisioned when he wrote TLOR, and you can't help but feel that. The delivery might not be word for word, scene for scene, but the message is unaltered, and that's all that should matter to you.<br />So, enjoy the LOR trilogy in print, at the Theater, or on DVD. Don't waste what time is owing to you on this world by quibbling over details. Watch, read, enjoy Tolkien however he comes to you. Be grateful, don't be petty and covetous of his work. It reflects only on you, after all.<br />Now, where did I put my axe? It's Tolkien Purist hunting time! Tonight I'm eating man flesh!
0316666343|5.0|At one point or time in our lives, we have all contemplated one question: what happens after we die?  Is there really a heaven? And if so, what all does it contain?  Is it the same for everyone, or does it depend on our individual personalities?<br />One account of life after death is described through the eyes of fourteen-year old Susie Salmon (like the fish).  Taking a shortcut through a cornfield from her junior-high school proved to be a fatal decision, as one of her neighbors, Mr. Harvey, sat perched, waiting for his next victim.  He cons her into entering an underground hideout he has made, where he then brutally rapes, and eventually murders her.<br />She continues the story from her new home in heaven, which seems to be accustomed to each person's desires.  &quot;Susie's heaven&quot; resembles that of suburban high school.  She attends the school with one of her newly-formed friends, Holly, but it is not quite the same as on Earth.  There are no teachers there, no boys that &quot;pinch their backsides or tell them they smelled&quot;, and instead of textbooks, they read things like Seventeen, Glamour, and Vogue.<br />As Susie makes her new home in heaven, she continues to watch her family's life unfold without her.  She struggles with being apart from her family, and not being able to help them, with the exception of a slight tap on the shoulder or her presence being among them for only a few seconds.  Watching brokenheartedly, she witnesses her family's break-up, and then is warmed as things seem to come together.<br />Sometimes in life, we take the things for granted that are most important to us.  You never really come to understand the value of something until it is gone from you.  Alice Sebold shows us in her novel that life sometimes takes abrupt turns, and you're never guaranteed to be able to life your life to the fullest.  As Susie states after exploring her heaven, &quot;I could not have what I wanted most: Mr. Harvey dead and me living.  Heaven wasn't perfect...&quot;<br />This book is a great book for mature, young-adult readers, preferably at the junior-high to high-school level.  It brings reality to real issues going on today, and how sometimes our lives can be taken away from us.  It is also great for adults to read, and be appretiative of the life they've been able to live.  What a great lesson to learn!
0066214122|1.0|What a tragic and awful novel given the earlier work of Michael Crieghton. Written in the first person -- often a small sign that the writer has lost his touch -- this book leads its readers to believe that it might be another wonder of new technology. It is like that at first, but Creighton gets almost desperate at the end to conclude the mish-mash that he has created. Surely his agents and the marketeers will love this book for a movie, and that is precisely what drives this sort of drivel. Creighton knows that and knows he wrote this book below his level. Go for the buck, Michael, and waste your talent.<br />Don't waste your time on this book; you'll feel like you've been drug though a seemingly informative string of chapters only to find that it all led to a remarkably stupid and unbeleivable conclusion
B000026OHN|5.0|Perhaps it takes the highest level comprehension and technique to carry out a pure performance of well-tempered clavier, and so far, no one have done it better than Richter in this recording.  It is pure music, pure Bach.  Nothing else.  Comparing to his recoring for the &quot;Revelation&quot; label, it is more spiritually free and relaxed, probably helped by better recording and excellent sounding piano.<BR>This is a textbook, or a bible, in any classical piano fan's collection.
0894803123|4.0|I bought this book with an ice-cream maker.  the recepies in here do not require the extensive cooking found elsewhere, and that makes all the difference.  These recepies are safe for children of all ages, and provide some very good treats.  I found myself altering other recepies from the information in this book.  Finally, you get a good piece of history about a great American company and it was easy enjoyable reading.
B00002MCTY|5.0|From very moment I heard the first chord of &quot;Taphead&quot; on campus radio as a Freshman at MI State Univ. in 1991, I knew this music I was destined to enjoy forever.  A badly worn CD and Cassette Tape later, and &quot;Laughing Stock&quot; continues to be a valued Masterpiece in my collection.<br />OK, the music can be &quot;noisy&quot; at times, but when the whole work is consumed by body and mind, it is the most beautiful noise that could ever be heard.<br />Really, all things &quot;Talk Talk&quot; are gems.  Every CD, nearly every song...off key broken chords in &quot;Does Caroline Know?&quot;...dance floor mix of &quot;Such a Shame&quot; on History Revisited...This band challenges the way I see music.  I hope any new fan will cherish this music as much as many of us do!

B00005BK3M|2.0|E.T. is a film I always wanted to see.  Partly because as a kiddo I used to have a stuffed E.T. doll which I loved very much until his neck split open and all the cotton fell out.  But anyway, because of my childhood fondness of the alien, E.T., I thought I would be watching the film of my dreams.  <br />EARTH TO GRAND CLOWN!  THIS MOVIE IS BORING!!!!!!!!<br />And indeed it was, terribly.  From what I heard, everyone thought this was the greatest film ever, and once again I scratch my head and I ask why?  After seeing, I was thoroughly disappointed.<br />The plot= ick<BR>OK, young boy finds an extra-terrestrial in his back yard and they instantly, mind you instantly, become best buds and he invites the squashy dude in his home and he hides him in his closet.  Amongst this hurried and quite unreal plot is this total lack of conflict.  About two thirds of this film, the first two thirds, there is zero conflict, no suspense, no entertainment, just fun bonding between an alien and a boy that lasts forever and ever, boring the hell out of me.<br />Although I think the bonding is great, between the squashy dude from Jupiter (or wherever) and the boy, this film sucks eggs.  It's cute, it's funny at parts, it plays off the cliche of boys wanting to hide secret friends in closets away from their moms.  And that's what this boy does.  That's nice.  But there's too much abundance in this.  Too much bonding.  Early on, the audience gets the clue that the boy and the squashy thing like each other and have a special connection.  But nobody cares because other than the bonding there really is no storyline that entertains us.  The final third of the film is where the conflict comes about, but it's too late, the rest of us are asleep.<br />I liked Spielberg's idea of this film, I think he has the right idea or at least is in the right ball park, but he's way off in how to make this into a good story that we want to watch, that makes it beyond friendship and expands it with a storyline that doesn't put us to sleep.<br />Look, this film is fun loving and has good intentions and is cute, it's the type of film that you watch on the Family Channel.  It is not the kinda film you wanna watch with the intent of being entertained.  There's nothing about this film that keeps you glued to it.<br />And here is why:  This film lacks the \\"C\\" word.  Challenge.  There is no challenge in this film.  There's nothing that makes the plot, the storyline, interesting to us because it presents no challenge.  And what is a challenge?  It's a problem, a crisis, something the matter that needs to changed or solved and the film covers the solving process.  This doesn't happen until the end, after all the lengthy bonding, and by then it's too short and too late.<br />Look, if you are going to make a cute film about bonding that's super, but if you want to make a movie then you need to create a plot that is challenging to the characters and the viewers to the extent that they want to see and find out what happens.  You just can't survive on character bonding alone, after awhile it isn't enough compared to a great, conflict that involves the characters coming together to solve it.  You can certainly argue that the hiding of E.T. from the boy's mother and the boy freeing the frogs is a form of conflict, but it's minor, playful conflict that isn't significant enough to keep us from tuning out.<br />E.T. is nothing grand, it's quite average if that.  Depending upon your entertainment level, you will be the real judge of this film whether or not it is the kinda movie you can watch.  I am willing to bet that a lot of the people that say they love this film only have watched it once, bought it, and now their copy is sitting on their shelves, collecting lots of dust.  And again, they say it's a great film.  I say, phone home another movie.
