B001R7IHA0|5.0|In my review of Keith Urban's last album, 2006's 'Love, Pain And The Whole Crazy Thing', I complained that although there was the makings of a decent set, the excessive length of many of the tracks wore one down ultimately. Indeed, LPATWCT proved to be his least successful CD to date.<br /><br />3 years later and 'Defying Gravity' redresses this completely. Running just under 15 minutes less that his last release, the whole thing is far tighter and of a much higher quality. The first 2 singles, 'Sweet Thing' and 'Kiss A Girl' have done really well in the charts and no wonder. Both are great pop/rock songs packed with hooks and show Urban at his best.<br /><br />'Hit The Ground Runnin' and the Rick Nowels co-write 'Standing Right In Front Of You' are more of the same, the latter in particular having a great riff and reminding us what a briliant craftsman Nowels is.<br /><br />Ballads 'Til Summer Comes Around' and 'My Heart Is Open' possibly slightly outstay their welcome but this is nitpicking as both songs are first rate really. Keith's only solo written tune, 'Why's It Feel So Long' is quirky and cute and the guy sure knows how to pen an addictive hook.<br /><br />The only possible weak spot is another Nowels co-write, the closing 'Thank You', an ode to Urban's wife Nicole Kidman. It seems over-written and forced to me being literally 5 minutes of Urban grovelling to Nicole and ,indeed, thanking her to death. Perhaps I'm an old cynic but it seems like he's trying just a bit too hard. Nice melody, though.<br /><br />So, that about wraps it up. DG is becoming my favourite album of his to date. It's one of those CDs that seems to grow on you the more you hear it, which doesn't happen as often as I'd like, and while his peak-selling 'Golden Road/Be Here' days may be gone, Urban should be really proud and invigorated by his achievements here.
B000002U9Y|3.0|the Only reason I bout this CD was for Jugband Blues.  Great song, rest of CD is pretty good too.
B00004W510|5.0|Critical darlings, it is unfortunate that The Band is not more well-known.  Music from Big Pink and this album capture the immensely talented group in all their glory.  If we are to believe Levon, Robbie polluted the true ensemble feeling by appropriating most of the credit for himself, and that's a shame, because the depth and diversity of musical talent here is truly extraordinary.  What other rock group could boast THREE great vocalists?  Add to that the extraordinary classical training and understanding of Garth.  And Robbie--well, he's Robbie.  Awesome, awesome guitarist, and his antics and ego amuse us.    This album and Big Pink both have some great moments and some fascinating innovations (on this album, Jawbone and King Harvest stand out for me as the most structurally unique and hypnotic).  But the true masterpiece here is Whispering Pines.  With haunting vocals by Richard Manuel, it makes Pet Sounds seem like amateur hour.  So many of this world's greatest musical talents have been taken from us too young, and so many by suicide, too.  Ian Curtis.  Jeff Buckley.  Nick Drake.  Manuel.  Perhaps they gave so much to us in their music they had nothing left for themselves.  This album is totally worth it for Whispering Pines alone, but every track is excellent.
B0002KQNJU|5.0|I've been looking for this movie for a long time! Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate. A combination of old-school horror mixed with satire.
B000L43AN4|5.0|I admire Tom Waits for his continuous pushing of the envelope.  He always challenges his listeners in complex ways.  At the same time, I will admit that his innovations can become excessive and abrasive.  He continues to produce great work amidst those cuts bordering on mere noise, but sometimes I miss his Asylum years personae.  I am happy to say that he returns in top form(s) here, and the sheer range of these three discs gives a little gift to every kind of Waits fan--including those, like myself, who hold a special place in their hearts for the Waits of the early years.    Disc 1 is more rock and blues influenced stylings, and it's my favorite of the three.  Particularly interesting is one long track on the Israel-Palestine conflict that manages to be insightful and message-filled without sounding preachy and while carrying a quite catchy tune.  Disc 2 gives us great ballad work, especially on Down There by the Train (which, with no disrespect intended, Johnny Cash never did justice to).  Disc 3 is all the avant-garde stuff, including a few spoken word pieces.  Waits creates two very different songs here with the same lyrics, and a story he tells near the end about a mother who lost her son is just . . . well, classic Waits.    This album above all shows how much Waits gets his fans.  He returns to many styles we haven't heard from him in a while, but with the creative sensibility and viewpoint of the Waits he's become--a little crazier, and with far more pack-years in him.
B001PA0FFO|4.0|This movie is not for action fans or those who need visual and audio stimulous to keep them interested. It moves along slowly, almost too slowly, but the performances by Hoffman and Streep are brilliant enough to capture and carry the viewer to the end. Toss into the mix the very strange mother (Viola Davis) of Hoffman's \\"victim\\", and you're in for an intellectual treat. Amy Davis gives a steller performance.<br /><br />Is Hoffman simply the victim of Streep's vicious attacks, or is he a molester of children? This movie leaves the viewer without an answer, which annoyed me somewhat. I wanted to know.
B001DJ7PMI|5.0|Thanks.  Yes, it was delivered within the due date.  Quality was excellent and I really liked the second disc of the actors' and director's commentary.
0307454894|5.0|Bernhard Schlink has created the most emotional inducing, emotionless book that I've ever read. In writing this novel, he purposely makes numbness a re-occurring theme. I would have never guessed that such an anesthetized-like story could be so thought provoking.<br /><br />The book is divided into three parts, and because I don't want to spoil the story for anybody who has not yet read it, I'll only recap pieces of part I and part II.<br /><br />In Part I, Michael Berg (15 years old), is seduced by Hanna Schmitz (36 years old). Their relationship consists of little emotions and a lot of sex. Their daily ritual becomes a loop of sex and Michael reading aloud to Hanna. Michael becomes torn and confused between his unusual, shameful affair and strong attraction to Hanna and his schoolwork, and school friends. He never crosses the two worlds: the Hanna World, and his, fifteen-year-old school life. When Hanna suddenly leaves with no explanation, Michael feels guilty for all the time he didn't spend with Hanna, and for all the time he did spend with his school friends.<br /><br />In Part II, Michael is older and attending law school. As part of a class, he is observing the trial of a group of women who served as SS guards in a camp where 300 Jewish women were killed in a fire. Michael is shocked to see Hanna there as one of the defendants.<br /><br />This is one of those books, where the author is exceptionally capable of telling a compelling story in so little (but expertly chosen) words. I totally recommend this 200 plus page book that can easily be read in a day or two.
B0002DKCMG|5.0|My movie came in perfect condition, and was as funny as I remembered it was! The entire film is full of absurd humor; it is by far one of my favorite movies ever made.
0321344758|5.0|This book is a fantastic read regarding user interface/user experience best-practices.  The sub-title really says it all, 'A common sense approach to web usability'.  The book is exactly that!  I recommend this to anyone who works in the web or technical arena as the reminders that this book brings up are genius in their simplicity and ease of execution.  Nothing rocket-science here, just a disciplined, realistic, straight-forward look at making sure your designs are clear and easy to understand.

0553582038|2.0|Books becomes increasing boring with each chapter.  Sexual content (lesbian, 13 year old girls) is increasingly added for no apparent reason.  Many chapters are just people sitting around telling stories about things that have nothing to do with series.  If this was the first book in the series,GRR Martin would not have been heard of- this book is that bad.
B001JNNDBA|5.0|This is definatly a different type of movie. After it is over your left thinking about what happened while trying to figure it out, almost like [[ASIN:B0007N1JC8 Primer]]. If you are going to watch it you may want to try watching it at least twice.
B0018LMZOE|2.0|Rather dissappointed with this title very few good tracks on the album very average production and recording no structure or theme to the album to tie it altogether.

B00069A5GE|5.0|I am listening to this disc as I write this review, right from the first track this album gives you a glimpse as to what is coming the gravely voice and super smooth Guitar just highlight the Geneius of the man.    The second track a duet with James Taylor is a standout track the harmony of these two magicians backed with the guitar work of Mark is a pleasure to listen to over and over.    This album just doesn't dissappoint in any aspect it's Knopfler at what he does best, it's well recorded a pleasure to listen to and rarely leaves my cd player mix.    On a top flight system you would swear you had a personal concert with the man, highly recommended.
B000PAAH3K|4.0|Malcolm Gladwell has written yet another thought-provoking book. In Blink he postulates that often our first impressions or gut instincts are more likely to lead us to the the correct decision than if we spent a long time gathering information and weighing out the pros and cons of the particular situation. In other words, you should \\"trust your gut\\" In trademark Gladwell fashion he uses many entertaining stories and case studies to illustrate his points, while at the same time cautioning against trusting your first impressions too much. I don't think his arguments are as well articulated as those in The Tipping Point, but I'll leave that up to the individual reader to decide for themselves.     My previous complaints about Gladwell's organization, and the repetition of his writing are still valid. I find reading the beginning of one of his chapters to be a very enjoyable experience, but by mid-chapter I usually find the going excruciatingly slow, and by the end I feel as if I've been wandering around the desert for days, and have finally found my way back to civilization.     Despite these minor flaws, at the end of his books I always find myself excited as to what his next project might be, and eager to share his insights with others.
B00064X3FO|5.0|Listening to this album and it's excellent remastering shows you how the man is regarded as a true geneius and in my opinion his early stuff is definatly his best work.    The vocal style arrangement and collabartive lyrics of his early work is a testament to his longevity and continued chart presence, this album is classic Elton John and a worthy addition to any collection if fine music is what you are looking for then you won't be dissappointed.

0385340575|3.0|Lee Child's franchise main character - Jack Reacher - tackles a thirteenth adventure that takes him straight to the lead story in so many national news broadcasts...domestic terrorism.<br /><br />The novel starts out with Reacher on a New York subway, sitting across from a woman who may be a suicide bomber. With military types and terrorists taking center stage, the plot delivers some excellent action, but then stalls in spots from seemingly endless chatter. Child does find another gear to get things rolling out of a ditch for a final flurry that brings the major elements together in a solid package.<br /><br />A thriller that will make a great summer read, Child has a timely story that is here today and won't be gone tomorrow.
B00005QHV5|5.0|I've owned about 6 or 7 complete sets of Beethoven Symphonies, and this Wand set is my latest acquisition. And I really regretted having spent SO MUCH money on those others: just to let you know what those are, von Karajan, Harnoncourt, Zinman, Jochum, Abbado, Norrington. Then there is the less than complete 'set' by Carlos Kleiber (yes, even Keliber Jr). None of them could be bench-marked against Wand's set in an 'overall' favourable light, with the latter ones to the more detrimental degree.<br />Surprised? Hardly so.<br />One reviewer says here that Wand was being 'hyped' by Grammophone Magazine. Certainly NOT so in their recommendations for the best Beethoven Symphony set. They did not even mentioned Wand. They revered Norrington, whom I found most ungrounded.<br />If you want to find ONE conductor who may possibly beat Wand in an overall sense, then go for Furtwangler in mono historical recordings. Perhaps the answer lies there. For stereo sets, Wand reigns over ALL - be it period or conventional.
B001PJ7TUE|5.0|Waiting for The Prodigy to return with their harder styled melodies like Breathe, Army of One, No Good for Me, Temper, Voodoo and Firestarter? This album delivers with over 7 seriously rocking electronic tracks filled with aggressive beats, synth riffs and classic Keef Flint and Maxim vocals, driven by the unique style of Liam Howlett. When I saw \\"The Prodigy\\" instead of \\"Prodigy\\", then noticed they dropped the Mute/Maverick label(now under RED), and the title \\"Invaders Must Die\\", I dropped my bills down immediately, anticipating at least one or two great songs, but never expecting 7 of them. Favorites include Take Me to the Hospital, Omen, Pirahna, Colours, World's on Fire, Run with the Wolves and Warrior's Dance. The other tracks are good, but these really crank it without any clumsy lyrics/beats(just one opinion).<br />Familiar synths are used, but these are entirely new Prodigy songs and this album rocks, making it my favorite Prodigy album to date. Awesome return.

0375842209|5.0|\\"So I looked, and behold, a pale horse.<br />And the name of him who sat on it was Death,<br />and Hades followed with him.\\" --Revelation 6:8<br /><br />I'm sure that at least several hundred reviews<br />of The Book Thief have summarized it far better<br />than I could. Let me address something else:<br />Many people don't think they want to read<br />another story about Nazi Germany filled with<br />lots of inhumanity. I suspect that reason is<br />why I waited for a long time to read this<br />highly regarded novel.<br /><br />While The Book Thief is based in Nazi Germany<br />and will give you more than you think about<br />each day in terms of terrible things that<br />happened then and there, it would be wrong to<br />think of this book as being another morality<br />play presented in that context.<br /><br />The Book Thief in instead a testament to the<br />importance of love, the value of truthful words<br />in opposing untruthful ones, and the inevitability<br />of guilt. As a result, this is a positive book.<br /><br />Will you be sad after reading it? Sure. I know<br />that I was.<br /><br />But Mr. Zusak has a very nice writing style that<br />gently prepares you for what's coming while still<br />switching the actual results around from the<br />obvious just enough to make the story interesting<br />to continue reading. He never kicks you when your<br />emotions are down. As a result, you can bear<br />reading about more suffering than you think you<br />can. It's a gift.<br /><br />I think one of the great values of this book is<br />that it will encourage many people who don't think<br />about death to wonder about what happens after<br />they die.<br /><br />\\"O Death, where is your sting?<br />O Hades, where is your victory?\\"<br />-- 1 Corinthians 15:55<br /><br />\\" . . . if you confess with your mouth the Lord<br />Jesus and believe in your heart that God has<br />raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.\\"<br />-- Romans 10:9

B000MX7V5M|4.0|Classic Hitchcock with great dialogue between Cary Grant and Grace Kelly - what's not to like?
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I'm holding up my credentials to verify that I am an Austen-phile and a huge fan of Pride and Prejudice. I even found fun in the Bollywood version (\\"Bride and Prejudice\\")! That said, I can state that this was a lovely twist on the classic novel, as well as an amusing take on what it means to be addicted to P&P, as so many of us are!     As Amanda's actions in old time England started to turn the standard plot on its ear, I found myself enjoying not so much the plot turns themselves as the take on each character. Those of us who have read the book many times and seen all the incarnations expect certain things of each character. It was fascinating to watch how they would react to new events (even though the characters were unaware of how things SHOULD have gone.) Like other reviewers, I don't want to give these twists away. Some played better than others, I suppose, but I'll bet all of us Austen fans will like different things - and different takes on character - from other Austen fans. Still, the acting was fine, the ladies were charming, the men suitably hot.     And speaking of us Austen fans, not only was it fun to put myself in Amanda's shoes (which would not fit me well), but I liked the amusing in-jokes aimed at Austen addicts. And if I'm including a little bit of a SPOILER here, the moment when Mr. Darcy jumped in the lake was delicious on many levels and showed us that the screenwriters were not only lovers of P&P, they possessed a devilish sense of humor. Post-modern indeed!    I recommend this one as a fine way to spend a rainy afternoon. It made me want to form a club: we read the book out loud together, then watch all the incarnations, one after another, fortifying ourselves with a feast fit for Bingley's table!
B001HN697M|2.0|Maybe because it was filmed in New Zealand, maybe because the good guys have pointy ears, and definitely because 92 minutes felt like 3 hours, I think a more apt title would have been \\"Underworld: Lord of the Borings.\\"    The whole movie is blue and dark and everyone speaks in those flat, expressionless English accents that seem to be a requirement for acting in films set in the old-timey days, no matter where or when. I think this story is supposed to take place in medieval Hungary. So would it have been so bad for Sonja - the female protagonist - to talk like Zsa Zsa Gabor? \\"I vant to suck your bloooood, dahling!\\"     Anyway, \\"Rise of the Lycans\\" is just kind of dull. The fights aren't particularly exciting (a lot of half-a**ed sword swingin'), the special effects (i.e. rubber suits and cheap CGI) are pretty lame, and it doesn't follow the \\"rules\\" established in the first two movies. Vampires and werewolves killed by swords and arrows? Whatever, man. Still, it's slightly better than \\"Underworld 2,\\" but only because it has a clear beginning, a middle, and an end. And speaking of ends, here's hoping that this marks the end of the \\"Underworld\\" series. The concept has been - pardon the terrible pun - bled dry. It used to be about blood-sucking vampires. Now, all that's left is the sucking.

B001DHXT2A|3.0|Incredible? I wouldn't go that far, but this Hulk is pretty good.      More of a big-screen adaptation of the TV series than a sequel to 2003's \\"Hulk\\" (which I also enjoyed), this new \\"Incredible Hulk\\" cleverly pays homage to the enduring performances of Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno, as well as to the overall asthetic of the TV show (the classic \\"Lonley Man\\" tune, for example). The human performances are excellent, particularly Ed Norton's, who was born to play troubled nerd Bruce Banner. Unfortunately, the \\"Hulk\\" himself is far from incredibly rendered by the CGI animators. Five years later, the Hulk still looks just as cartoonish, out of place, and, well, silly as he did in Ang Lee's 2003 endeavor (albeit a darker shade of green, and with a low-carb body fat percentage). Lately, I have seen some really good CGI that blends more or less seamlessly into the action. In this movie, there are fleeting moments when the Hulk seems like he might actually be there smashin' stuff, but those are few and far between.     In addition to being a distractingly poor computer-generated cartoon, this film's Hulk is also kinder, gentler, and more vulnerable than the character's previous incarnations. Contrary to Dr. Banner's timeless warning, I like the Hulk when he's angry. For some reason, this version of the Hulk doesn't seem particularly perturbed. In fact, he moves and acts more like a shy, startled gorilla than like the embodiment of repressed anger gone berzerk. Humbug! The Hulk isn't a misunderstood, loveable \\"Mighty Joe Young.\\" He is the epitome of explosive human rage! That's what makes him so dangerous - and compelling.     Seeing a(nother) poorly animated, soulless version of the Hulk makes me reflect on the old TV series and just how inspired Lou Ferrigno's performance was. When Mr. Ferrigno put on the green makeup, the Hulk didn't need a hug. The Hulk was MAD! He was OUT-OF-CONTROL! He was, well, human.
B001O8C5KK|4.0|Madama Butterfly has been such a popular and often recorded opera I thought the best had come and gone.  However, that changed when I heard about this recording.  The magnificent Angela Gheorghiu has talked a lot about performing and recording this role.  I dreamed about her Butterfly, but feared her chosen Pinkerton would sadly be her husband Roberto Alagna who, let's face it, never became all he was cracked up to be and still isn't.  Fortunately the new German tenor sensation, Jonas Kaufmann was cast as Lt. B.F. Pinkerton for this recording.  He has everthing I want in a Pinkerton, except perhaps some of the lighter, more Italianate touches of say Pavarotti in the more sensuous moments of Act I.  Therefore this recording is truly a dream come true.  Now I hope Angela and Jonas perform this together onstage, say at the MET sometime soon while their new production of Butterfly stays in the repertoire.  That would mean two dreams came true for me.  Just listen and you will know why this is one of the best Butterfly's ever recorded.  Also a big BRAVO to Antonio Pappano, possibly one of the finest opera conductors today.

B00260HH3K|1.0|I have been a fan of Dragonball for years. I have the anime from Dragonball to Dragonball GT. But after seeing this so called movie I felt apart of my childhood destoryed within a hour and 30 minutes. So where do I begin? Well first, the Story was a mess there was little to nothing about Dragonball in it, and the pace felt rushed. There was no time for any plot development, or character development. Basically You meet Goku, then Bulma, Roshi, Yamacha and then final battle. So you can't get to know the characters, and understand why they are on this quest to collect all 7 Dragonballs before Piccolo. Also, it felt Fox was using other material from other famous movies and cartoon shows. Films like Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, ans some materical from Avatar: The Last Airbender. Plus the movie never explain som important factors, for example, how does Piccolo escape his imprisonment, how does he hook up with Mai, How can Mai shape shift, Why does Piccolo need the Dragonball and so on. Second problem with this movie is the actors. Poorly casted, and they poorly portray their characters. For example; Justin Chatwin makes Goku sound and act like Robbie (played by Chatwin) in War of the Worlds. He does want to take on this mission to save the world, complains all the time and tries to hit on girls. Please if you have see the manga or anime you know Goku isn't like that at all. He stand for good and justice and all the heroic stuff; many Main characters stand for. Thrid, the speical effects look like some thing for the late 80s or early 90s. I can tell you used guide wires and the Kai or engery waves looked fake. I mean come on Look at Iron Man when Tony shots the glass in his lab they looked more realist then what you see in this movie. To rap this review up after watching Dragonball Evolution you don't feel they put any effort in this movie, they don't want to please the fans, or get people who don't know what Dragonball is into the series, no Fox did it to make a qucik Buck. So I say Skip It.

The reader was amazing and did a wonderful job of bringing the characters to life.    Now, I'll be honest here - when you first start reading this book, you're wondering what the heck is going on and thinking that its boring and droning.  But just stick with it.  It gets better and by the time you're at the end, its just wonderful.  I am thankful that I trudged past the beginning when I thought it was going to be terrible.  This book is great and I highly suggest the audio CD!

Don't get me wrong I like the Jack Reacher novels but also like a little change too.<br /><br />  This novel is like \\"walking tall's\\" Buford J Pusser with a team behind him.

B00000AFGM|5.0|I have been listening to all of Marilyn Manson's albums in the weeks awaiting his newest release \\"The High End of Low\\" which was just released May 26th, 2009.  I spent much of my teen years listening to Marilyn Manson and consider myself a big fan of his work.  But this does not make me biased in any way towards the high and lows (no pun intended) of his career.  So this is my review series of all his albums.  Hope you get to check them all out.<br /><br />First of all this album came out in 1998.  It is hard for me to believe that this album is over 10 years old already!  I was 14 just becoming a freshman in highschool the first time I heard this album.  I remember listening to every track on this album with awe.  It was like listening to everything I loved about Rock music all in one album.  It was different than his previous releases and alot of fans thought he lost his edge.  Well for me, that couldn't be any farther from the truth.  I remember listening to it and thinking it had a shiny new sound to it...  But with a good old fashioned vintage feel to it.  I heard influences of David Bowie, Kiss, Alice Cooper, and many more greats.  It wasn't like the other music that was big at the time like boy bands, pop punk, or even nu metal.  It was a gem in a world where music was just getting worse and all sounded the same and generic.<br /><br />As far as the track listing goes this is in my opinion the most solid album by Marilyn Manson.  It didn't have as many filler songs as Anti-christ superstar had and it was something that while coming very close, he may never have quite nailed again with his subsequent releases.  This IS my favorite Marilyn Manson album.  Every single song on it is great in my opinion.  From the opening riff of \\"Great big white world\\" to the fading echo of \\"Coma White\\" this album has it all!  I don't care what type of rock you like, this has it all.  Rock, Hard Rock, Glam, Industrial, punk, Classic, Acoustic, and more.<br /><br />To make the album even cooler it had a blue tinted packaging that could be used as a decoder to decode hidden messages inside the album.  Which today might not be as cool to me since I am much older, but to a 14 year old kid this was like the coolest thing ever.  I could imagine it being alot like one of the classic Led Zeppelin album covers like \\"Physical Graffiti\\" where you had interchangable pictures in the windows on the album cover. But we all know that gimmicks don't make a great album, so what makes this such a great album?  Well its the content of the record itself!  The Music!<br /><br />The album itself is consists of 14 tracks.  While the album is solid, it does have a split feel to it.  While there is really no specific pattern, it does seem that the earlier songs are the heavier songs, and the last half is more of the darker songs.  But overall this album is not as dark as say \\"Holywood\\".  In many ways it is his least dark album and in other ways it is the most dark.  But the darkness portrayed in this album is like a very bright colored darkness.  Like being in the underworld of a very bright and populated city.  It is by no means a  \\"gothic\\" album.  It is an album about modern day addictions and depressions.  About the things in our life that we think make us happy but can never understand why we are so sad all the time.  Even though this album came out in 1998, I would say it is more relevant in today's society with all of our addictions to technology and painkillers.<br /><br />  Here is the track list:<br /><br />1. \\"Great Big White World\\"<br />2. \\"The Dope Show\\"<br />3. \\"Mechanical Animals\\"<br />4. \\"Rock Is Dead\\"<br />5. \\"Disassociative\\"<br />6. \\"The Speed of Pain\\"<br />7. \\"Posthuman\\"<br />8. \\"I Want to Disappear\\"<br />9. \\"I Don't Like the Drugs (But the Drugs Like Me)\\"<br />10. \\"New Model No. 15\\"<br />11. \\"User Friendly\\"<br />12. \\"Fundamentally Loathsome\\"<br />13. \\"The Last Day on Earth\\"<br />14. \\"Coma White\\"<br /><br />I am not going to go into detail on eachsong because I believe this is an album that needs to be listened to as a whole without any predetermined thoughts or ideas as to which songs are better than others.  I think that might ruin the experience.  But this is my review of Marilyn Manson's Mechanical Animals album.tened to as a whole without any predetermined thoughts or ideas as to which songs are better than others.

B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Crisp, bright dialog with a rich touch to cinematography.  The actors are wonderful and snap together like legos.  The grandmother/father/daughter relationship is heartwarming and normal--in a well off NYC household sort of way.  The quirky humor that is delivered by all is super.  Strongly recommend for any Firefly, House since I like those as well.  Nice to see Nathan transfer his talents to something in our world this time around.<br /><br />If you are a Jim Butcher, Dresden File Book fan--be on the lookout for 'Dresden lines', as there are a lot of them and you'll have fun seeking them out. Not sure who the dresdenite is, but we love ya!  You do great work!
1596912863|4.0|Fans of the current crop of Jane Austen movies, [[ASIN:B000E1ZBGS Pride & Prejudice]], [[ASIN:B00005MP58 Pride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E, 1996)]], [[ASIN:0800141660 Sense & Sensibility (Special Edition)]] & [[ASIN:B00000G3AZ Emma]], will love this light romp of a book. Faced with a string of failed relationships, Jane takes refuge in Colin Firth's Mr. Darcy. When an elderly Aunt leaves her a bequest to actually live as an Austen heroine for 3 weeks, well she takes it as a sign to get it out of her system.<br /><br />Take this along with you to the pool or beach - it's a short, fast read that is light enough to be able to put down if you are called away but will have you picking it back up the next time you have a few minutes.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|Obviously, almost everyone who has reviewed this book has found it to be exceptional, and I am in total agreement -- so I won't rehash their praise.<br /><br />I just cannot imagine a better telling of this story; the author does it with absolute perfection.  He conveys the trials of the Pacific War with precision, down to every element of its brutality, filth, and sacrifice.<br /><br />Anyone who wants to develop some understanding of why they're called \\"The Greatest Generation\\" should read this book.
B000NA2BEU|5.0|The product arrived just as described online. It was also very reasonably priced. I would be willing to buy from this seller again.
B001JNND9W|5.0|I bought the DVD when it came out and then grabbed the BLU RAY recently....the BLU RAY looks much better and has many bonus features not on the DVD release. The 20 minute making of is really really fun and has Newman and the director and a couple of the stars (including the naked motorcycle gal!) as well as Chris Cornell (fanboy). Why this wasn't on the DVD I don't know but it certainly gives the nod to the BLu-ray as well as overall picture quality and other bonus features. The USA and UK options are on both DVD and BLu-Ray and the UK version is a bit longer..The extra bonus feature on the Music is also stellar with interviews with classic artists as well as legendary DJ Jim Ladd...and another feature on the mighty Dodge Challenger...loads of Blu-ray extras!    I saw this back in High School with The French Connection as a double bill and man...were those the days! Two of the greatest car chase movies back to back. It surprised me that Barry Newman didn't become a mega star after this but I guess it was a cult film and all my buddies and I loving it didn't mean much in the overall picture. Actors Cleavon Little and the legendary Dean Jagger also bring a gravitas to the film and are superbly cast. Certainly by today's Computer Generated special effects this might seem tame to young viewers but it holds a special place in the hearts of baby Boomers and beyond the car chases there is something of a bit of the 60's lingering in the atmosphere that elevates it above the norm.
0316010669|4.0|A very interesting book that can help you learn to trust your own decision making processes. Teens often try to blame their behavior on other things or people. One of my favorites is, \\"I blacked out and didn't know what I was doing.\\" While we are all responsible for our actions, our brains can go on automatic pilot from time to time. With this phenomenon laid out, we can learn to control our thinking a bit more than the average person who seems to always fly on auto. Also, Gladwell discusses intuition quite a bit and how if we listen to our deepest self, our decision making can really improve.
B001S6Y0AQ|5.0|I agree with the other very well written review...  it IS one of the classic Jazz albums of all time with major cross over appeal and on top of it we get a stunning compliment of unreleased LIVE versions and a skimpy yet fun DVD with interview and demonstration...so why 4 stars?  As I said...I agree with the fellow from San Diego...the sound  is very well presented ,particularly for a 50 year old recording, the repertoire is classic and there is bonus material....all for about 20 bucks...WOW...I  say 5 stars all the  way.  The couple of DVDs available of the classic quartet are also worth owning and highly recommended..Paul Desmond was a one off player in my book.
B001GCUO16|1.0|If they made this movie and it had NOTHING to do with wolverine or the xmen i would say it was a  3 1/2 - 4 star movie.  But the fact remains that they made a movie about a set of characters, and then refused to admit any of the facts that had already taken place.  Im not some huge xmen fanboy, but i have come to learn certain things over the years... things this movie tinkles all over, and not just accidentally. some of the things they AIM RIGHT FOR and say \\"HA!! i dont care if this is what really happened, im changing it!!\\"  Like Weapon X being the roman numeral 10... meaning wolverine was the tenth experiment (american experiment) so the one before him was Weapon 9, and the one after him was Weapon 11.    If you can look passed how horribly the butchered the story (which given how much unknown stuff the COULD have written about, and been right, its inexcusable) then the movie was pretty good.  Good acting, everything looked sharp and clean, the effects were nice.  So if you know nothing about Wolverine and the XMen, sit back and enjoy.. otherwise it might be more enjoyable if you watch it next time youre at the dentist getting teeth pulled... at least that should distract you from the movie enough to be able to enjoy it
0312370849|2.0|I approached this book ready to settle in for a deep and moving experience. The premise was terrific as a vehicle to explore the history and emotions of those caught up in the nightmare of occupied France. I was disappointed as I felt the story instead of deepening my knowledge and feelings for those who suffered through this period, the story was superficial and facile. The predictability made the subject matter feel shallow which it actually was not. At the end of the book, I felt like I had just seen a movie of the week adaptation, and I was saddened by the loss of an opportunity to grow in compassion, understanding and knowledge.
B000K7VHQE|4.0|I had no idea what to expect from \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" but I knew that it was nominated for \\"Best Picture\\" so it must have had something going for it.  I caught on quickly that this is not your ordinary movie and I soon realized that anything could happen.  This is a story of a hopelessly dysfunctional family whose many seperate parts find a most unusal way of coming together.  You can see it coming and it really becomes rather impressive to watch.  However, this film disappointed me in how it ended.    I was bothered by the portrayal of the phoney plastic young girls in the Little Miss Sunshine.  Let's face it, movies and TV stereotype just about everything. For some groups it has been a real issue.  However, when was the last time you saw a pageant portrayed as a number of young ladies striving to become the best that they could be with every participant exiting the event as a better person than when they started?  I've attended a lot of pageants over the years (thanks primarily because our town annually hosts the state's Miss America contest).  The reality of the quality of the participants has always impressed me as far exceeding the demeaning stereotype that permeants society's general impressions.  Maybe it's an overblown reation but it bothered me how the movie strayed from what I saw as a theme of how to become a success.  All of the film's  unusual family members had failed to achieve their goals except for our young and endearing heroine.  How the movie treated her moment on the stage really bothered me.  Otherwise, this is an enjoyable albeit unusual film.    I guess I should acknowledge that the message of \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" might possibly be that the problem with chasing our dreams is that they can turn into nightmares.  Be happy with what life allots you while laughing at those who haven't yet had their comeuppance.  This could have been such a better movie!  Oh well, I noticed that this was an independent film so perhaps they were poking fun atHollywood's glamour girls with more looks than talent while the Indie actors were doing the heavy lifting.  See, none of this really scores any points.  Oh well, enjoy \\"Littler Miss Sunshine\\" for what it is rather than what it isn't.

B000Y7U98C|3.0|Sunshine is the latest sci-fi movie based on a doomsday scenario.  Except here, the doomsday is actually a state of minimal sunshine, and hence eternal winter on Earth.  A crew of international astronauts are sent to the Sun to ignite it with the Earth's last reserve of fissible material.  Along the way they make bad decisions that force them into making worse decisions.  The end result is that they all die, though after re-igniting the Sun.      The movie is actually more of a drama than a sci-fi, though the occasionally action scene is as hair-raising as any sci-fi movie.  There were several parts of the movie that were unbelievable though, and this took away from the entire movie itself.  Probably the biggest blunder, in my opinion, is the portrayal of the \\"villian\\" Pinbacker, a member of the previous mission who has gone insane.  The wounds he has suffered should have killed him after all those years, yet not only does he survive for several years in isolation, but he is also incredible strong and agile as witnessed by his action scenes.  The other unbelievable part of the movie is that the spacecraft carrying the astronauts approaches the Sun very closely, to a distance actually that it should have melted.  Yet their craft seems quite stable until it actually crashes into the Sun.  The only redeeming part of the movie was the dialogue, which came across as very realistic and believable.  Overall, an OK science fiction movie.
076790592X|5.0|Tuesdays with Morrie by Mitch Albom<br /><br />This book is the story of a remarkable individual. First of all, I love how Mitch Albom writes. He truly captures the essence of his characters. In this particular book, his hero is a lifelong teacher of his, someone he genuinely admires and respects, even loves.<br /><br />The story is a story of a remarkable man and teacher who continues to teach others how to live right up to the last moment. Morrie laughs, he reminisces, he focuses on what he can do, not what he can't. This man is an living example of true Inside Out Empowerment.<br /><br />Some would read this book and say Morrie teaches about how to die. I read the book and say Morrie is a teacher of how to live! This is a great book.

I love food, I love eating food that is tasty and good for me (yes, I think this is totally possible), I read a lot of nutrition books, have worked with nutritionists, teach yoga, and am into overall health and wellness.  I liked that this book didn't give me some simplified answer to my health; it gave me lots of information and let me decide what I should do with it.  I would be curious to see more studies on people who have committed to a vegan lifestyle though and will continue in my own personal quest to take the best care of myself I can.  It already scares me to see so many people sick with these chronic diseases and I really don't believe that modern/western medicine is ever going to be the solution.  It can't possibly.  It's up to each one of us to take control of our health and quality of our lives and books like this make me hopeful that I can figure some things out on my own and I have a chance to a long, healthful life.
0761129235|5.0|This book is applicable to many topics including starting over. The Kaizen Way is about accomplishing our goals one small step at a time. Kaizen is a Japanese word, whose essence is captured in the phrase, \\"A journey of a thousand miles must begin with the first step.\\"---Lao Tzu. It simply means taking small, manageable steps toward your goal.<br /><br />Dr. Maurer speaks about how kaizen and innovation are the two major strategies people use to create change. \\"Where innovation demands shocking and radical reform, all kaizen asks is that you take small, comfortable steps toward improvement.\\"  Some people are more prone by their nature to act with the broad strokes of innovation but in my experience, sometimes when I stop something \\"cold turkey\\" or I vow to begin something religiously, I will do so for a short while and then, gradually drift back toward my old habits.<br /><br />Dr. Maurer suggests kaizen when those habits we are attempting to change are extremely stubborn and/or when you have a degree of fear about making the necessary change. Taking small, baby steps is the way we \\"tiptoe past our fear,\\" Dr. Maurer asserts.<br /><br />This is what I believe makes kaizen the perfect approach for starting over. Our old habit of spending time with our loved one, thinking about him or her, loving him or her is a habit that is extremely stubborn to change. It's hard to just quit a person \\"cold turkey,\\" especially when it wasn't our idea in the first place. And often there is a great degree of fear about starting over---fear of loneliness, fear of pity from others, fear of harsh judgments from others, fear of rejection from someone new, fear of never finding anyone, fear of intimacy with a new partner, fear of letting go of the original relationship, fear of realizing our \\"love\\" wasn't what we imagined it to be, fear of being hurt again and a host of other possible fears.<br /><br />The best way to begin is just to begin. Ask yourself some kaizen questions. What's one small thing you can do to smile today? What's something you can do for five minutes every day where you will think of something other than your lost loved one? What's one small thing I you can do to feel better about yourself today? If you weren't afraid of failing, what would you be doing? If you knew for a certainty that you I would be meeting your \\"perfect\\" mate next month, what would you be doing differently today? What's one thing you like about being single again? If you were guaranteed not to fail, what's one small thing you would be doing differently? What's one small step you could take toward moving on with your life? What is one small thing that's special about you?<br /><br />Another suggestion by Dr. Maurer is to create a mind sculpture. Mind sculpting is a lot like visualization but with an added strong emotional component. So, you would be imagining and visualizing a happy, fulfilled life either by yourself or with a new partner. Make sure when you are watching your \\"mental movie\\" that you are also experiencing each of your senses along with a strong, positive emotional component. Fill in the answer to what are you seeing? What do you taste, smell and hear? What do you touch or feel on your skin? And how are you feeling emotionally?<br /><br />It may seem that small steps would only yield minuscule results, however, as Dr. Maurer explains one small step will lead to another and then to another until your fear response has been bypassed and then rapid change can occur. One day, you will look around and realize you have accomplished your goal and didn't even realize it. There are other techniques in this book: solve small problems, bestow small rewards and identify small moments. I recommend it as a book that can give you ideas for accomplishing goals that have been alluding you.day?

B001AVCFK6|5.0|This was an absolute great movie! I have never been a trekkie but have enjoyed watching the shows and movies (some of them). I am more of a Star Wars fan and I think it was better then Revenge of the Sith due to better writing and acting. With Star Wars, I grew up with EP 4-6 and those are still my favorites. This Trek movie however has made me a Trekkie geek as well. Great cast, great story (love the whole shake up of the Trek universe), and great special effects. Yeah it is a re-boot of the original series, but it is the begining we never saw and now a whole new universe! Go see and then buy the DVD when it comes out.
B000R7I3LY|4.0|I was a little hesitant buying this album...her lead single \\"Lovesong\\" got so much airplay and seemed to be on every advertisement for every new show that I was over it quickly...too much sometimes can be too much. But it had been a while since I'd heard the song and anything else by Sarah so I purchased this not long ago and I was pleasently surprised. What an amazing album.<br /><br />Her voice is strong, the lyryics are very personable (I'm sure she snuck into my brain to write Gravity).<br /><br />I wont compare her to Tori as no one should be...She is a one off and completely unique.<br /><br />Some pop influenced tracks mix in with some ballads and numerous radio friendly tunes.<br /><br />It's a great album to put on your ipod if you have a long trip ahead.<br />I can't wit for Sarah's new album, I'll be buying that one the day it comes out.

B000002L7J|4.0|Meat Is Murder, the sophomore effort from pioneering English band The Smiths, found the act experimenting with a myriad of genre bending styles. First of all, Morrissey's long time penchant for Elvis-esque rockabilly is in full gear (i.e. \\"Rusholme Ruffians\\") as well as more sensitive, introspective ballads (\\"I Want the One I Can't Have\\").<br /><br />Not immediately accessible, and with no standout radio single, the record would remain one of The Smiths least favored records. It's remarkable, then, to recall that Meat Is Murder is the only original album to chart at #1 in the U.K. The inclusion of the immensely popular \\"How Soon Is Now\\" on the U.S. release ensured that Meat Is Murder would also sell reasonably well stateside.<br /><br />The politically charged ideology is abjectly confrontational but never quite approaching tiresome. Lettuce love lullaby \\"Meat Is Murder\\" is, like veganism, an aquired taste. Though a bit preachy and self-righteous, the lyrical content does hold some sad truths. Just recently, to the shock of no one, it's come to light that some slaughterhouses routinely employed torture.<br /><br />\\"Barbarism Begins At Home\\" and sister song \\"The Headmaster Ritual\\" serve as compelling odes decrying the stringent disciplinarian tactics of English schoolhouses.<br /><br />Perhaps the most amusing track is \\"Nowhere Fast\\" with it's giddy declaration of \\"I'd like to drop my trousers to the Queen\\" amid typically dispiriting reflective imagery such as: \\"I think about life and I think about death, and neither one particularly appeals to me.\\" Brilliant.<br /><br />Meat Is Murder is primarily regarded as an important step in the creative growth of The Smiths which reaches its peak with the monumental third release The Queen Is Dead.

I usually wait until I try several recipes before I rate a cookbook, but the introductory pages are enough to rouse me to review.  Some more experienced bakers might say the tips at the beginning (such as \\"buy an oven thermometer\\") are \\"common sense,\\" but that part of the book is very helpful for a baker novice like me with limited baking supplies.  Speaking of oven thermometers, now I found out why my baked goods often burned: my oven was off by 50 degrees.  I never would have thought to get one of those :-P.  Until I buy more things like Wilton tips and a double boiler, I feel like I have enough to get started.  There are even tips for DIY sifters and double boilers, for instance.  My baked goods are usually disastrous the first time I make them, but these cupcakes were perfect on the first shot.  Thank you Isa and Terry!

B000002U6E|5.0|In 1994 it was, perhaps, impossible to view VH1 at any given moment and miss the memorable clip for Enigma's \\"Return to Innocence\\". Opening with the peaceful death of an elderly man beneath a tree, the video unfolds in reverse exposition (a la Coldplay's \\"The Scientist\\") to weave the tale of that man's life all the way back to birth - the literal return to innocence.<br /><br />Fronted primarily by the gifted Michael Cretu and an insanely awesome bamboo flute, Enigma burst onto the electronica/new age scene in the early nineties with impressive bravado. For a few precious years, they accomplished the improbable and made new age sound rather swell.<br /><br />Then, as fate would have it, Yanni had his Acropolis deal in '94 and Enya released an album a year later. New age sunk back into its former state of what could be described as \\"cotton candy\\" music. Though it should be noted Enya did win a Grammy for her record, but a new age Grammy is pretty much a Gimme Grammy. Enya has racked up a win for nearly every album released. At last count, she is up to at least four or five.<br /><br />You see, it's not exactly a hotly contested genre.<br /><br />But I digress.<br /><br />With the release of MCMXC a.D. in 1990, Enigma catapulted themselves to stardom with a brilliant cohesion of Gregorian chants, sweet synth beats, and the aforementioned insanely awesome bamboo flute. Their work would be drafted into dozens of films, trailers, and television ads and have the distinction of featuring on my fifth grade mix tape.<br /><br />Their early albums, perhaps inevitably, sound a bit prosaic at present. It is probably difficult for first-time listeners to recognize that in 1990 the sound of Enigma was both edgy and stylistically nouveau.<br /><br />Fourteen years after release, there is still something innately special about \\"Return to Innocence\\" - indeed, the whole of Cross of Changes is an impressive piece of work. Never, before or since, did Cretu and crew combine their stock of worldly chants and electronica beats with such pitch perfect effect.<br /><br />That's why it will always remain a mainstay in my collection, and that's why it should remain in yours as well.perfect effect.

B00026W82U|5.0|Almost single-handedly, Simon & Garfunkel took the folk music playbook and modified it to create a sound deeply rooted in folk yet immediately accessible to casual radio listeners. Their 1964 album \\"Wednesday Morning, 3 AM\\" is a landmark recording in the furtherance of popular acceptance of folk.<br /><br />Though the album was not an overnight success, within two years the group would shoot to stardom under the momentum of fans who could not get enough of the airy acoustic guitars and lyrical witticisms. Part of the credit is due to Paul Simon's exceptional songwriting prowess, and part of it is due to the otherworldly harmonizing between Simon and Garfunkel.<br /><br />Over thirty years later, up and coming acts are still working off the S&G folk modifications, many of them adding their own enhancements and alterations to the mix. Belle & Sebastian are perhaps the most notable of these ardent folk followers, but an oft-overlooked outfit is the duo Kings of Convenience.<br /><br />Norwegian musicians Erlend Oye and Eirik Glambek Boe, playing together since their mid-teens, formed the band in 1999 and managed to release their debut \\"Quiet is the New Loud\\" only two years later. The beauty of KoC songs is in their simplicity. \\"I Don't Know What I Can Save You From\\", with it's soothing, hushed vocals that would become trademark, sidles along amiably despite the ominous overtones of the lyrics.<br /><br />\\"Toxic Girl\\" gained the twosome significant attention, featuring both in a wireless advertisement and in the film Shallow Hal. What strikes the listener most about the album is that though there is some scoring to the songs, and scant percussion here and there, the bulk of their work is straight acoustic singer/songwriter stylized folk music.<br /><br />It is a refreshing sound free from the noisy overproduction and needless instrumental meandering that permeates the sound of many modern indie acts. After a diverging remix album called Versus, Kings of Convenience released sophomore effort \\"Riot on an Empty Street\\" in 2004.<br /><br />With this release Oye and Boe built upon the folk tradition, displaying extensive creative growth and expanding the scope of their sound by leaps and bounds. \\"I'd Rather Dance With You\\", unquestionably the poppiest track on the record, excitably bounces along with a danceable beat. It was the second single culled from the record and potentially misleading to newcomers as to the overall characteristics of KoC's sound.<br /><br />The first single, \\"Misread\\", showcases the duo at their absolute zenith. The breezy acoustic guitars and mellifluous vocals are rarely in finer form, and this alluring dynamic is displayed in other tracks such as \\"Live Long\\", \\"Cayman Islands\\", and \\"Gold in the Air of Summer.\\" Leslie Feist, who herself released an album that year, features on two tracks: \\"Know How\\" and \\"The Build-Up\\".<br /><br />The folk genre is crowded with acts who attempt to emulate what Kings of Convenience have done, but the honest truth is that Oye and Boe are peerless. Any skepticism to this declaration can be quelled by simply listening to their work - and while \\"Riot on an Empty Street\\" is undoubtedly their best work, both of their albums are highly recommended.pty Street\\" in 2004.

The breezy acoustic guitars and mellifluous vocals are rarely in finer form, and this alluring dynamic is displayed in other tracks such as \\"Live Long\\", \\"Cayman Islands\\", and \\"Gold in the Air of Summer.\\" Leslie Feist, who herself released an album that year, features on two tracks: \\"Know How\\" and \\"The Build-Up\\".    The folk genre is crowded with acts who attempt to emulate what Kings of Convenience have done, but the honest truth is that Oye and Boe are peerless. Any skepticism to this declaration can be quelled by simply listening to their work - and while \\"Riot on an Empty Street\\" is undoubtedly their best work, both of their albums are highly recommended.

B001ACY8D2|4.0|Since the late nineties, Sigur Ros have established themselves as the premier purveyors of delicate orchestral melodies ripe for feature film soundtrack inclusion. Who among us can forget the lilting piano strains that signal the beginning of \\"Hoppipolla\\" or the explosion of sound that \\"Saeglopur\\" bursts into mid-stride?<br /><br />If nothing else it's impossible to forget the titles. The band themselves are nearly as inscrutable as their music, particularly since the members are notably boorish in dealing with the press. Case in point: the disastrous 2007 NPR interview (which can still be seen online, replete with \\"director's commentary\\") during which the band is somewhat polite yet awfully reticent for radio.<br /><br />One wonders why they even agreed to render the interview. Publicity? Contractual obligations? Free coffee at the studio? Granted, the majority of the questions are approaching inane, yet there's little question the band could have been more gracious. Instead they come off as bleary-eyed sedative addicts. Though, personally, I wouldn't have it any other way. It is so very droll to read the comments of the fans as they blindly defend their precious heroes and decry the career choice (among other things) of the interviewer.<br /><br />But I digress.<br /><br />It was with great fanfare that the band released the first single from this album on their website last year, titled \\"Gobbledigook\\". Yes, I spelled that correctly - \\"Gobbledigook\\". I really wish this review fell on April Fools Day, somehow that would make this whole write-up even more amusing. The album cover and music video of \\"Gobbledigook\\" are, wow, just wow. Sigur Ros has a grand tradition of gorgeous disc packaging and thoughtfully crafted video clips. So what majestic aesthetic are we presented with this time?<br /><br />Naked people running and/or dancing. LOTS of naked people. Why? Because we all know naked bodies equal poetic art. By this logic the AdultCon conventions should be worthy of highbrow review in the New Yorker. Were he still with us, I'm sure Helmut Newton would love this stuff. As for me, I'm simply pleased to behold a group so wonderfully bizarre they defy explanation.<br /><br />Thanks Sigur Ros, for providing beautifully eclectic music with a hearty serving of unintentional hilarity. What will you guys think of next?<br /><br />Wait, don't tell me. I want to be surprised.Were he still with us, I'm sure Helmut Newton would love this stuff.

B0024F08RO|5.0|I love this show, I love how it ended they all got a free pass, but i sure as hell wanted the show to go one for a couple more seasons. I fell in love with the show. It's great and was very creative. It kept me coming back for more and that's what I loved about it. The writers and the cast did a great job. Like the guy who plaid Alex Mahone. I hated him at first, then I started liking him, and then I felt sorry for him. The guy who plaid TBag, I loved to hate him. He was mean jerk. Loved both Michael and Linck,from start to finish. The show rocked, and kept me on edge, I really wanted to know the following week what would happen and never missed it.
B000002L9J|5.0|In 1986, The Smiths were responsible for developing one of the most lyrically ornate, musically brilliant albums of the past thirty years. The Queen Is Dead represents a milestone in the furtherance of more complex pop records and served to unequivocally establish The Smiths as the most meaningful band of their era.<br /><br />The burgeoning eighties indie scene gave rise to artists as eloquent as Elizabethan poets while still musically proficient enough to fashion those words around catchy, hook-filled songs. The DIY aesthetic that permeated early punk rock recordings also fueled like-minded indie musicians who desired to branch outside of the limited confines of popular radio, Top 40 countdowns, and cheap dancefloor programs.<br /><br />The Queen Is Dead commences with the rip-roaring title track which very nearly sounds like an early punk recording, before branching off into the whimsically astute observations on dealing with spiteful industry types with \\"Frankly, Mr Shankly.\\"<br /><br />\\"I Know It's Over\\", which essentially parallels a breakup with death, stands as a bleak testament to both the internal turmoil of its author and his ability to sum up a lifetime of agony in a few brief minutes. \\"Cemetry Gates\\", another whimsically droll melody, is a clever response to critics who accused Morrissey of outright plagiarism.<br /><br />\\"Bigmouth Strikes Again\\" proved to be an exceptionally popular single, with its war-cry of \\"Now I know how Joan of Arc felt\\" and relentlessly energetic guitar work. Immediately following the intensity of \\"Bigmouth\\" was the impassioned \\"The Boy With The Thorn In His Side\\", a personal favorite of mine.<br /><br />The final highlight is \\"There Is A Light That Never Goes Out\\", which has over time became known as The Smiths signature track. Darkly elegant in feel, the timbre of Morrissey's voice accentuates every sympathetic syllable. It is small wonder fans have embraced the track as an anthem.<br /><br />Curiously, despite the universal critical acclaim this record received, both Morrissey and guitarist Johnny Marr consider their next album (\\"Strangeways Here We Come\\") to represent the peak of their creative output as the collective Smiths.ssey and guitarist Johnny Marr consider their next album (\\"Strangeways Here We Come\\") to represent the peak of their creative output as the collective Smiths.

B000002LCX|4.0|\\"Strangeways, Here We Come\\", the fourth and final album by seminal eighties band The Smiths, was released in September of 1987. If the volatile relationships within the band were unclear after the release of third album \\"The Queen is Dead\\", they were certainly at the forefront in the months leading up to the release of \\"Strangeways\\".<br /><br />Lead guitarist Johnny Marr had already departed the band a month prior to its release and vocalist Morrissey was becoming increasingly frustrated the dynamic of the band as a whole.<br /><br />\\"Strangeways\\" proved to be a hit in the United Kingdom, striking the #2 spot in the charts, and also saw moderate success in the United States. Three singles were culled from the record, including \\"Girlfriend in a Coma\\", \\"I Started Something I Couldn't Finish\\", and \\"Last Night I Dreamt Somebody Loved Me.\\"<br /><br />These tracks, indeed the whole of the album, presented a slightly evolved template from which the band created their ambiguous, subterranean odes concerning humanistic observations and literate ruminations.<br /><br />The lyrical tone was more tongue-in-cheek than previous releases, as if Morrissey was poking fun at the journalists who criticized his typically melancholy demeanor. The compositions were trademark Smiths work, yet showed growth with their expanded synth arrangements.<br /><br />This decision dates the album considerably, especially compared with their earlier work which is mostly composed with the standard guitar/bass/drum setup, yet the synths did lend a slightly fuller sound to the tracks on Strangeways.<br /><br />In the wake of the dissolution of The Smiths, Morrissey embarked on a highly successful solo career and Johnny Marr became one of the most sought after session musicians of the nineties. As for the two other members. . .well, honestly, who cares about them?
0761536434|2.0|The actual title of the book would have been \\"The Ultimate History of U.S. Videogames Industry\\". The whole text is very U.S. and Japan centered, while Europe is almost absent: Acorn, Rainbow Arts and Infogrames, just to name few, are not even cited, while Sinclair and ZX Spectrum deserve three lines of text on the overall 500 pages.   The point of view is extremely focused on Atari, Nintendo and Sega: Mattel Intellivision is dismissed in less than three pages, Philips VideoPac is completely non-existent.  Many ground-breaking all-time classics are not present at all: Galaga, Moon Patrol, Dig Dug, Tomb Raider, Sid Meier's Civilization, Elite, SimCity, Command & Conquer, Quake...  Interactive Fiction is ignored altogether: even Infocom's \\"Zork\\" is nonchalantly bypassed despite its million copies sold.  The book is very well documented on various trials between industry firms, which may or may not interest the reader: but again, this is the history of the industry, not of videogames themselves: for this, you have to definitely look elsewhere.
B000002L5P|4.0|\\"It's time the tale were told of how you took a child and you made him old.\\" So begins the eponymous debut album by seminal eighties band The Smiths. From there, the record unravels to reveal layer after layer of complex lyrical arrangements that touch on everything from distresses concerning social economics to denouncements of abject murder.<br /><br />In defiance of their contemporaries, The Smiths adopted a back-to-basics approach - which their very name suggests. They dressed down in t-shirts and denim, rather than gaudy costumes or stage outfits. They utilized the standard structure of guitar/bass/drums at a time when synth was everything.<br /><br />Frontman Morrissey wasn't afraid to wordlessly vocalize or display an almost comical falsetto on tracks like \\"Miserable Lie.\\" Guitarist Johnny Marr was just coming into his own as an accomplished arranger, as if he was only then realizing the power his instrument held to impel tracks like \\"This Charming Man.\\" In short, The Smiths were young yet eloquent, and what they lacked in experience they made up for with surprisingly erudite sentiments.<br /><br />Take \\"This Charming Man\\", for example, an early single penned with such ace insight that an inscrutable line like \\"Why pamper lifes complexity when the leather runs smooth on the passenger seat\\" doesn't pan out as obtuse but rather quite fetching.<br /><br />The bulk of the album continues this trend of shrewd awareness for humanity's darker recesses: \\"Pretty Girls Make Graves\\" is a sexually-androgynous ode to romantic frustration, and \\"Hand in Glove\\" continues this theme with lines like \\"No, it's not like any other love. This one is different.\\"<br /><br />The Smiths was a landmark album and a sign of great things to come. This album and the ones proceeding it would influence acts as diverse as Belle & Sebastian, Radiohead, Doves, and Suede in the years to follow.

0307346617|3.0|World War Z is a good (if overhyped) addition to an underwritten field; there are some very interesting ideas here.  The  broad thrust of the book is to add an element of realism to the idea of infected/undead infestation; how would cultures react (or fail to react)?  What would post-infestation culture look like?  These ideas are interesting supplements to the typical hack-n-slash action element we normally see in zombie stories.  However, even as it is a good page-turner (as someone else has mentioned) there are a few issues I found with the book.    Superficially, I found its format a bit annoying (why boldface the square brackets?); stylistically, Brooks just isn't that great a writer.  For an \\"oral history\\" the writing style is pretty uniform and boring at times - if he wanted to make it realistic he could have varied his style to reflect the different cultures he attempts to represent (broken English, grammatical errors, etc).    There are some interesting narratives and a couple of great stories, but his impetus to realism makes Brooks rely too much on acronyms, which get \\"DistAn\\" (distracting and annoying) after a while.  Having said this, there are some interesting ideas that \\"flesh out\\" (ahem) the zombie mythology, and undoubtedly others will diverge from this to make the zombie universe as varied and interesting as vampire mythology.
B001FB4W0W|3.0|Oh, my lord.  What have they done to Sookie Stackhouse? Charlaine Harris' novels portray a woman, not an immature brat, which is basically what she is in this series.  Sookie Stackhouse is a barmaid in Bon Temps, northern Louisiana. She's telepathic and longs to meet a vampire, as they have recently 'outed' themselves since the Japanese developed the synthetic blood, 'True Blood', which gives the series its name.  Enter Bill, a vampire who is mainstreaming and has returned to his home town after becoming a vamp at the end of the U.S. Civil War.  Sookie and Bill are attracted to each other and romance blossoms.  Unfortunately, there's a series of murders being committed in Bon Temps and the main suspects are Bill, Sam Merlotte (Sookie's boss) and her brother Jason.  I highly recommend the series of books, which is up to 9 books now, but if you read them, you'll be able to see the glaring mistakes in the series.  If you haven't read them, and you like vampire stories along the lines of Kresley Cole's 'Immortals After Dark' series, you'll love this show.  It's suspenseful, edgy and dark and the acting is superb. There is not one bad actor in this series. Everyone is exactly how I pictured them in my head whilst reading the books, with one exception.  My best advice is to hire the box set and, if you decide you like it that much, buy it.

6305090564|1.0|If you are a fan of those \\"Sci-Fi Channel Original\\" films, then you may really like \\"Deep Rising\\". It plays out like a bigger budget version of Sci-Fi standards like \\"Mega Snake\\", \\"Kaw\\", \\"Fangs\\" or \\"Ice Spiders\\". The film is done by Stephen Sommers made famous for the recent \\"Mummy\\" movies, and you can see several seeds planted in \\"Deep Rising\\" that grew into fruition with the \\"Mummy\\" films. The comic hero, played by Treat Williams, the goofy sidekick \\"Tooch\\", the touge but lovable heroine played by Famke Janssen, the over-the-top villains straight off the set from the latest \\"Die Hard\\", all clicked much better in the first two \\"Mummy\\" films than they do here.<br /><br />The basic story is that a group of commando-like robbers want to hi-jack and rob the patrons of a private cruise ship. Unfortunately before the commandos arrive, the cruise ship attracts the attention of \\"something\\" living on the ocean floor. When the commando-crooks arrive, the ship is basically deserted, and the few remaining survivors inform them that a \\"creature\\" has devoured most of the ship's passegner and crew.<br /><br />Simple enough, a decent basis for a monster movie. Unfortunately, things begin to really unwind as soon as we catch a glimpse of the monster. The CGI monster looks as though Hanna Barbera had a hand in it's creation, and the squid from Disney's \\"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea\\" made over 3 decades earlier looks more convincing and threatening than the writhing mass of tentacles found here. The acting is hammy, and over the top, which might have actually worked if everyone played it serious, but for the most part the cast is constantly smirking at how witty the dialogue is supposed to be, and playing up the \\"comedy\\" which just doesn't work.<br /><br />Top all of that off with a soundtrack comprised of some guy jamming out on a Casio home keyboard better suited for a Hulk Hogan movie, and this is just a lousy creature feature entry all the way around.
B000JQV68A|5.0|Semi-autobiographical story that captures the essence of the Jazz Age in all of its decadence and flamboyance.  The characters care most about having a good time, no expense spared, even when it means living seriously above their means.  The real story of Scott and Zelda, especially during their early marriage, is eerily similar in some ways, with Scott eventually dying of alocholism and Zelda ending up in an asylum.   The novel is truly captivating, especially if you want to know more about the glitter of New York City in the 1920's (the \\"CITY\\") and America life during that period in general.
B000002AP1|2.0|As little as I know about the dynamics of digital audio, one thing is certain: If you crank your levels up to 11 and clip your waveforms, you will lose the dynamic range of the music. Yes, surprisingly enough to some of you, even The Stooges had dynamic range! When you clip, everything ends up sounding like bad teeny-bopper corporate punk on FM radio. So who can tell what the mix sounds like when it's impossible to hear it through the travesty of bad mastering?<br /><br />Put this CD in your computer and view any of the songs in a waveform editor. There is digital clipping throughout. It's a mushy, noisy mess. And before you start thinking that the Stooges were all about \\"noise,\\" understand that you won't be able to fully enjoy any of the musical \\"noise\\" -- all those wonderful human sounds are crammed together in a massive gooey hairball of clipped digital dreck. It sucks!<br /><br />Here's my sad story. I had Raw Power on vinyl for a long time and, though I was never crazy about the Bowie mix, I still loved the songs and adored the album. When the remix came out in '97, I naturally picked it up. After all, I always wanted the album on CD and here was the opportunity to get it remixed. Big mistake! It ruined the album for me for over ten years. I recently found the original Columbia CD (cat. no. CK 32111, for those in search of it) with the Bowie mix and my love for the album has been restored. But it burns me up that it's been ten years without this album for me. I'm glad to have it back.<br /><br />I give the album 5 stars, the remix 0. That averages 2.5 and I'm rounding it down to 2.
0440539811|4.0|I read the Trilogy right after reading 'Gravity's Rainbow.'  It was really a breath of fresh air.  I found myself easily able to keep up with the multiple plots and characters.  It wasn't frustrating...it was fun.  It reminds me a lot of some of Philip Dick's work, particularly 'Valis.'  The underlying subject matter is serious in nature, and yet it's dealt with in a rather playful fashion and along the lines of a game or puzzle.  Don't read this book if you're not at least receptive to the idea that things may not really be as they appear.  You'll get bogged down and frustrated, and probably follow the red herrings too literally and seriously.  In a way this books seems to be a way for free thinkers to pat each other on the back, wink, and otherwise make themselves the hero or at least take the helm of their own style of adventure story.  Who doesn't want to be Celine Hagbard, the guy with all of the answers, bravado, gets the girls, and wins in the end?    I didn't give the book 5 stars b/c 'The Eye in the Pyramid' was so great and the rest of the work didn't live up to it.  The middle book kind of seemed flat to me.  'Leviathan' is too heavy to Joe Malik, which I found disappointing.  I have no objective criticism of the second two books, which I still think are good, only personal opinion.  This is very entertaining read overall.
B001R4KQDE|5.0|Sin City is one of my favorite movies of the 2000's. I bought the 1-Disc DVD back in 2005 and was satisfied enough at the time just because I owned the movie.  However, after purchasing this Blu-Ray, I will never watch the movie on DVD ever again.  The clarity is much better, colors pop, and you couldn't ask for a better audio track.  As for supplements: there are two discs with two different cuts of the movie, and a wealth of features on the making of the movie.  If you love this movie and are still not sold on upgrading to Blu-Ray: This disc will change your mind.  Highly Recommended.
0316789798|3.0|It uses simple shapes to draw animals. Young kids, 4 year old or under should be able to follow it. Don't expect to draw pretty animals or show any imaginations from the drawing.  It is an ok book for kids to kill some time by themselves because it is easy to follow. You can leave the book with kids and go do your own laundry.  I don't think it is a good book for those who are serious about art and drawing.
B000JLSLZQ|4.0|As far as movie musicals go, Phantom of the Opera was a welcome addition and certainly deserves to be watched at least once for music and spectacle alone.  If you own the DVD and would like to upgrade to Blu-Ray: Go For It.  I did, and I am pleased.  The Picture Quality received a nice boost.  However, much remains the same as the Special Edition DVD.  But with such a visual movie like this, Blu-Ray is the way to go.  Recommended.
B001ECQ4HG|5.0|The best script written by Tarantino, IMO, and the best film directed by Tony Scott. Scott and Tarantino are amongst the best in their fields, and this really show's throughout the film. This is definitely a film that everyone should see, and is a DVD that should be amongst every collection.
B001J4E1D8|5.0|Having just read the book for the first time since college (some 25 years ago) and having seen the Masterpiece Theatre presentation in January, I was struck by how closely this new adaptation mirrors Thomas Hardy's original novel. Every important scene is re-created, and Gemma Arterton very much becomes Tess as I imagine Hardy himself must have envisioned her. As others have noted, the character of Angel Clare is poorly represented, but that in no meaningful way detracts from the power or indeed the visual beauty herein. The landscape is stunning, the cinematography renders the atmosphere just right, and the overall effect will stay with you long after Tess's story has reached its fateful conclusion.
B001PPLJIQ|4.0|not much to add that hasn't already been said about the film, so I'll make this brief.  The film itself is beautifully shot, very picturesque.  The always wonderful Kate Winslet gives a career perfomance, and Ralph Fiennes is great as usual.<br /><br />At times sad, joyous, seductive, and dramatic...this film really touches the heart in many ways.  It tells of a love story over a 30 year period, showing how each character has changed.  It has an unexpected plot twist in the middle, another one at the very end.<br /><br />* highly recommended
B00260HH3K|1.0|First and foremost.......... THIS MOVIE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH DRAGON BALL EXCEPT for its title. The story has been changed radically and have turned a great anime into a SOAP OPERA movie, the protagonist actor Justin CHatwick is the worst choice to play Goku, horrible acting, horrible script........ they turned Goku into a regular guy that only thinks in how to hook up with girls ......????????......... the rest of the characters have been changed too, not only they look completely different, but their behavior in this movie is almost the opposite of the real dragon ball anime.<br /><br />You've been warned, if you are a fan of the Dragon Ball anime, in this movie you WILL NOT FIND any of the plot, characters or personalities that you loved from the anime, and you will feel really upset that you wasted your money on this.<br /><br />And if you are not a fan of Dragon Ball anime, you STILL WILL HATE THIS MOVIE, because even as a movie it doesn't make any sense, no character development, stupid one-liners, and mediocre effects.<br /><br />DON'T WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS CRAPPIEST MOVIE, and if you want TRUE Dragon Ball buy the anime dvd instead.
B000V6BE6C|5.0|Avenged Sevenfold's self-titled 2007 release is much like Metallica's 1991 classic \\"The Black Album\\" because it shows the band changing their sound, appealing to the masses and dividing the fans right down the middle. Well, most of them at least, because I happen to like both A7X's older and newer stuff.  If you haven't heard your friends' opinions on this album, \\"Avenged Sevenfold\\" is an album that will divide the fans into two preferences: the older, more underground-based sound, or their more recent, accessible sound. Most people will either love this album to death or frown upon it for not retaining the thrashy, epic sounds of \\"Waking The Fallen\\".  However, if you look beyond the change in the band's sound, you'll realize that this album actually has a lot to offer. Keep in mind I own all of their albums, from \\"Sounding The Seventh Trumpet\\" to this one, so I come from a well-rounded opinion if I do say so myself.  \\"Avenged Sevenfold\\" is an album that, while drawing commercial success, somehow manages to expand the band's sound. I find this astounding, because it's not often a band's most experimental work will be their most successful, but low and behold, \\"Avenged Sevenfold\\" is probably the band's most experimental album, and as I said before, their most commercially successful.  This album not only goes from screaming punk-metal to Broadway to country, (yes I said Broadway and country), it showcases some of the band's biggest-sounding, most epic songs yet. And I don't mean epic in the way you beat your friends in a Super Smash Bros. Brawl tournament, I mean epic in the sense of huge-sounding, larger-than-life melodies.    \\"Critical Acclaim\\": The band kicks the album off quite epically, with a church-like organ and a slow, passionate guitar solo, before erupting into a blast of heavy riffs, politically- and socially-driven lyrics, and some awesome shout-a-long chants. A killer way to start the album.  \\"Almost Easy\\": One of the biggest hits off the album shows the band starting right away, with Synyster Gates ripping out a beautiful, energetic solo in C# minor, before the band goes into heavy riffs over a fast drumbeat, an energetic pre-chorus, and a massive-sounding chorus that seems to echo from the metal valleys (wow, why did I say that?)  \\"Scream\\": A snakelike riff in the diminished scale and some primal, dirty vocals and lyrics bring this song to life, with an even more primal, dirtier chorus and chorus riff. More great, larger-than-life melodies in the second half of the chorus, making the songs 3 out of 3 on the epic scale.  \\"Afterlife\\": Probably the second most famous song off the album, this six-minute masterpiece starts off with a strings section before erupting into an awesome, punk-metal riff and guitar solo, some great verses and a chorus that will ring out in your head for days. Truly one of the band's greatest songs.  \\"A Little Piece of Heaven\\": An eight-minute epic that combines A7X's brand of punk-metal with Broadway music, a lot of humor and some hilariously graphic lyrics. One of the most entertaining songs they've ever written, bar none.  \\"Dear God\\": A sweet, acoustic country song that clocks in at six and a half minutes closes the album out. Both fans and newcomers would probably never see this song coming, I know I didn't, but it's still an amazing way to end the album.    So what this album lacks for in the hardcore screaming vocals or underground-styled breakdowns, it gained something massive. If my descriptions of the highlights of the album got you interested, then run down to the store right now, get this album and blast it. If you're into Avenged Sevenfold, then hopefully you'll dig this album. Even if you're a newcomer, you should too. The important thing to remember is to keep an open mind with this album. You might just love it. Thanks for the time, and peace.

You'll love it if you are at all interested in running, health, human evolution, indigenous cultures, or ... if you just want a beautiful story about the human condition and our connections to each other.  It's great writing, and easily one of my favorite books in recent memory.    On the other hand, if you are a running shoe company exec, or a huge fan of Bill Bowerman, you may want to skip some chapters of this book, as the author pokes big (fact-based) holes in the prevailing mythology.

0446581348|2.0|I bought this book hoping for more but Bobbi Brown did not deliver.    PROS:  -This book has beautiful product photographs  -Ms. Brown's blush application technique produces WONDERFUL results  -Lovely models of all colors showcase the diverse range of what beauty really is  -Concealer/corrector application technique also is great  -Final section for would-be makeup artists is insightful and well put together    CONS:  -All of the sections are unfortunately short: Biggest problem really. For example, her foundation application was not helpful. She provides \\"step photos\\" with captions but they could really be more helpful. She could have went into detail at each step. All women would love to know how she gets those photo ready results on the models.  -Her eyeshadow techniques are a joke. Ms. Brown suggests using a \\"base eyeshadow\\" before applying your real makeup look. In reality, a good primer on the lids that dries translucently is a much better choice, not an extra shadow that will undoubtedly change the rest of the colors.  -She doesn't provide any names of the products photographed, which I thought was a real letdown. There were a lot of beautiful colors that I wanted to know MORE about!  -Some of her skincare tips are suspect. For example, she suggests that those with oily skin don't really need moisturizer after the face is washed. Not having a properly moisturized face will only make skin more oily. Believe me, I know!    Bobbi Brown's \\"Makeup Manual\\" really was not a very good manual at all. She proved that she really is much better at face and cheeks than eyes and creativity. She stated within that she wished that she had a book like her own when she was starting out. I ask, why? It isn't very informative, she took brevity a little too seriously, and by the end I was really regretting the money I spent. I didn't learn anything about makeup application that couldn't have learned with a little Googling or watching YouTube.     Bottomline: If you are curious about this book, see if you can find it at your local library first. It really isn't worth buying.
015206396X|2.0|I couldn't get past the terrible dialogue, particularly that of the young princess.  The author really seems to have no idea how young people speak.  The idea of graces as powers was played out well, unfortunately it's a mark of poor writing to need to slip that word into every paragraph. Katsa was much more interesting as a heartless thug than the simpering whining crybaby she becomes halfway through the book.  Po could have been a great character but instead becomes a spineless doormat for all of Katsa's whiny behavior.  The key villain had great potential but hardly appears in the book.<br />In all, the book kept me interested, but could have used much better editing and a more talented author.

My kids have endless fun re-enacting various battles and making up jousts, etc. Rainy days are never dull with an imagination and knights like these.
B000002OVJ|5.0|Earth shattering. More pure rock n' roll testosterone here than the next 5 \\"best live\\" albums combined. The Ox and Moonie are the best rhythm section EVER in rock. Period. You doubt that? Then isolate on the bass and drum playing here. It's rare that any band is captured at it's very apex of their skills like this. A masterwork.  \\"Long Live Rock\\" indeed.
B001P3SA94|4.0|It seems almost anti-climatic to be reviewing this particular film, Cadillac Records, about the rise of Chess Records and its driving force, owner Leonard Chess, in the maelstrom of the Chicago blues explosion of the 1940's and 1950's. Why?  Over the past year or so, along with the usual left wing political books by the likes of Leon Trotsky and James P. Cannon that are the core items that I review in this space, I have been fervently doing a personal search for, and reflection on, the roots of American music. And nothing is more central to an exploration of the American songbook than the various expressions of the blues from its roots in the black quarters of plantation society down South, through to the immense process of black urbanization in the mid-20th century and with it the electrification of the blues and further on the use of that genre to form the basis for Rock `n' Roll that was central to much of the musical history of the last half of that century.            Muddy Waters, Little Walter, Jimmy Reed, Howin'Wolf, Chuck Berry and the divine Ms.  Etta James are all names that should be familiar to knowledgeable blues fan and whose fame and fortune, rises and falls form the core of this film. They are also names prominent among those that have been reviewed in this space so this is a real treat. The Chess Record saga is narrated by the actor who plays the producer, \\"talent hunter\\", songwriter and musician Willie Dixon, a huge force in the expansion of Chess Records and Chicago blues in general. And this is as it should be. Willie Dixon wrote for both Muddy Waters (the classic \\"Hoochie Coochie Man\\", among others) and Howlin' Wolf (the most famous being \\"The Red Rooster\\", a song later covered by The Rolling Stones, enthusiastic blues aficionados, and one of my first exposures to the raw electric blues sound. Thanks, Willie). He was also at Chess when the music shifted away from the Chicago blues to the `jump' of rock `n' roll driven by the likes of Chuck Berry who could \\"crossover\\" to all those white teenagers like me trying to break out of the music of our parents' generation. He was also there when Ms.  Etta James came on the scene with her R&B style that also was an attempt to do that same crossover with a black woman singer.    According to the notes to this film it is based on a true story, that of Leonard Chess and the blues stars mentioned above. How much truth there actually is included in the script is beyond the scope of this review.  I would note that one of the segments of Martin Scorsese's PBS multi-part Blues homage in 2003 dealt with the role of Chess Records as part of the total blues picture and featured Leonard Chess's son, Marshall, a record producer in his own right. Some of his comments do not exactly jibe with the presentation of the facts in this film. That is a subject for further research and discovery.     Some important themes, nevertheless, are explored in the film, even if obliquely. The relationship between a young hustling Jew (and his brother, not noted in the film) from Poland trying to make a buck in America and young blacks trying to get out from under the rural \\"Jim Crow\\" South in mid-20th century America. The question of interracial sex, both male and female when that was very, very taboo. Martial infidelity, a constant problem in the music industry (and elsewhere). Exploitation of blacks, both financially and musically, by the white-dominated music power structure, including Leonard Chess. The touchy question of black identity and self-respect, addressed very nicely in the tensions between Muddy, as a representative \\"Uncle Tom\\", and Howlin' Wolf (or Chuck Berry), as the \\"New Black Man\\", coming out of new black consciousness of the civil rights struggle blazing away during that period. Addressing those issues should keep us busy for a while.    Let's finish up with a few kudos, though. A musical tribute to a record company and a famous record producer could have been a piece of fluff. While, as noted above, the film raised a number of questions about what really went on back then the heart of the movie is driven by the blues and the need to express oneself in that genre, whether as a job or a way of life. The performers carried the day. The camaraderie and falling out between Muddy and Little Walter is worked nicely. The struggle's of Etta James (Beyonce is rather fetching here, by the way, as Etta) to break through as an artist works.  And so on.     The Cadillac automobile formed a symbol for Americans, black and white, back in these days. The artists presented here deserved their Cadillacs. More enduring though, as noted at the end of the film, all the main players here have been inducted into the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame. I challenge anyone to argue against those inclusions. Watch this film and then get on the Internet and download the music. Yes, that's the ticket.

B00260HH3K|1.0|This movie has absolutely nothing to do with Dragonball. The creators of this film are just using a name with a large following in a sorry attempt to earn more money. If you're expecting this \\"experience\\" to remind you of the Toriyama made anime at all, don't waste your time and money.
B001PPLIFU|3.0|If I were to nail down what's wrong with \\"Quantum Of Solace\\" in a single word - it would be \\"cold\\". Bond used to be fun, Bond used to be entertaining, Bond used to grab you by the short and curlies and pleasure the engorged gonads off you for the allotted two hours it was given. And it never failed. Even the worst Roger Moore dreck of the late 1970's had something that encouraged repeat viewing.  But on Bond 22 - you're bored half way through it and by the predicable end not much has changed.<br /><br />I suppose after 22 films about the same thing, you're bound to have a case of diminishing returns, but there are times on \\"Quantum\\" where you have a shocking sense of pointlessness. Marc Forster directs chase sequences that feel contrived and have been done so much better before either in previous Bond films or others (principally Bourne). You feel like your watching Alien 3 - made by some inexperienced buck that made videos for a living. And don't get me started on the crap song and the woeful opening credits that were clearly a hurried last minute thing.<br /><br />The opening car chase is the first offender. At the cinema, I along with others couldn't believe they'd do this - when you think of how Bourne simply nailed that - this Italian sequence is workmanlike at best. It should have opened with a reconfigured flashback sequence that included the car chase, but ended in the fabulous hand-to-hand fight sequence in the scaffolding (one of the films best moments) - and very Bond.<br /><br />You have to feel sorry for Craig too - who seems to be putting in twice the effort for half the return. There is also a worrying ongoing lack of chemistry between him and Judy Dench who quite clearly pines for Brosnan to return - an actor who could convey both charm and edge in equal abundance and was comfortable as Bond and evolved as him.<br /><br />It would of course be easy to blame Daniel Craig as the lead - I don't. It isn't that his Bond is charmless by choice, it's that he's being forced to be that way. Check out Craig's acting chops in \\"Flashbacks Of A Fool\\" or \\"The Mother\\" or \\"Defiance\\" - he's absolutely riveting and brilliant in all three - displaying all manner of emotion - shockingly good when given the material. But the under-worked script of \\"Solace\\" has straight-jacketed his version of 007 into a particularly nasty corner. It's far 'too' hard-edged and has left him with little or no room for acting manoeuvre. He isn't warm towards anyone - especially women - and his character needs to be.<br /><br />The dispatching of Gemma Arterton's character Fields in black oil (aping the famous Goldfinger scene) is perhaps the crassest moment ever in a Bond film and a huge mistake. Her character could have died in a far more interesting and brave way - letting Craig and Kurylenko get away - but no - this is a man's movie made by men who have no interest in women.<br /><br />After Mads Mikkelsen's fabulous and believable turn as the card-playing Le Chiffre in \\"Casino Royale\\", Mathieu Amalric is just hopeless as Dominic Greene - one of the most insipid bad guys ever - about as frightening as a teddy bear with a wonky eye. His expressions of anger and hate in the opera scene when Bond outs The Quantum group are just laughable. Bond's feisty companion Camille played by the truly gorgeous Olga Kurylenko is a smart choice as a leading lady, but she gets little to work with. Both the tremendously likeable Giancarlo Giannini and Jeffrey Wright as Ren&eacute; Mathis (police chief ally in Casino Royale) and Felix Leiter (his CIA buddy) distinguish themselves, but again Rene is disposed off in a cold and crass way. And on it goes to the inevitable mega-explosive ending...<br /><br />Then there's the Blu Ray itself - the picture quality is gorgeous as you would imagine, but the menu is irritating to navigate - the interviews use the same Daniel Craig footage almost three times where he looks tired and bored rigid and again utterly charmless. And youfinish watching them very quickly indeed. Again you just know there's more - and sure enough - sometime in 2009  - the inevitable 2-Disc Ultimate Edition to fleece fans will appear.<br /><br />It isn't that \\"Quantum\\" is really, really bad - it just that it isn't that good either. I can't see myself looking at it again and that's almost unforgivable after the out-and-out triumph of its predecessor. The makers need to go back to the drawing board and lighten up big time, because this is a very disappointing and dreary chapter in one of the most cherishable film franchises in history.<br /><br />Bond tells M in one of their spiked conversations, \\"You don't have to worry about me...\\", but on the strength of this and hundreds of other 3-star (and less) reviews - we clearly do.<br /><br />In the words of Gerry Rafferty boys, \\"Get It Right The Next Time\\"...now there's more - and sure enough - sometime in 2009  - the inevitable 2-Disc Ultimate Edition to fleece fans will appear.

B0000025DR|5.0|Out of all the releases by ELO that I have listened to, Face the Music has to be my favorite. An explosive, energetic Fire on High is a perfect instrumental to kick off what turns out to be an ideal assortment of tunes. The guitar work and orchestrations are so much in synch that I wonder if it inspired Paul McCartney's Rockestra Theme, which would be released on Wings' Back to the Egg LP some four years later.     From start to finish, Face the Music is comprised of numbers that are well-transitioned, thus making the whole disc perfectly intact. Included are the top 10 hit, Evil Woman, and a lovely, brief, Fantasia-like prelude that is immediately followed by the beautiful, immortal FM classic, Strange Magic.    Also quite noteworthy is the evenly-tempoed Waterfall, which ideally segues to Evil Woman. Nightrider is quite upbeat and reminds me of All Over the World, which would appear in ELO's half of the 1980 Xanadu soundtrack. Interestingly enough, perhaps as one of Jeff Lynne's tributes to the Beatles' Revolver-era productions, a tape loop is included right before Down Home Town. When played backwards, it reads, \\"It's the mighty waterfall. It's the mighty waterfall.\\"    Throughout, the genius of Jeff Lynne and his fellow performers is dominant. At the very end is the pefectly grandiose, but not bombastic, One Summer Dream to close this 1975 symphonic deal, which would turn out, perhaps, as a feat that ELO, since then, has not quite come to equal, much less surpass.    Great job, Jeff and gang!
0312360266|4.0|[[ASIN:0312360266 Marked (House of Night, Book 1)]]    Marked is an exciting story that is thrilling and intriguing.  The character development is superb with some crass language.  It is easy to relate to many of the relationships and situations in this book as well as the entire series.
0380973839|3.0|So it basically starts with this team of astronauts who go to Mars and they find out there's Martians there. The Martians think the people are Martians because Martians have telepathy and they think the astronauts are crazy Martians. After that the astronauts die and then the people on Earth think that the spaceshipped just crashed when it got to Mars. They all have no idea about the Martians and they decide to send another spaceship to Mars. When they get to Mars there are no Martians there and then they start going crazy because one guy is obsessed with the Martians. The Martians are thought to have died out and the one guy who's going crazy claims he's the last of the Martians. He starts killing the rest of his team and he eventually gets killed. More people start coming to Mars after all this and started to colonize the areas (there's still no Martians there). Some man leaves the town to look at the Martian ruins and he ends up running into an actual Martian. Both of them are arguing saying that the other one is a race that died out. Then the Earth somehow gets destroyed and everyone on Mars had to go to Earth to fight in the war. The remaining people on Mars try to make a new life there because they can't go back to Earth. It ends where basically humans were ancestors of Martians and that it worked through almost like a time vortex.       I thought the book was pretty interesting actually. Although some parts were really confusing and I wasn't sure what was going on, it was still a pretty cool book. I would recommend this to people who are older only because they can probably understand it better. I actually ended up asking my brother alot about the book since he read it. But in the end it all tied up very well even though alot of the book was boring and hard to read.
B001JV5B12|4.0|I received this item in great condition. Both movies were taken well care of and the quality are great.

B001K3JF7K|4.0|I'll purchase almost any recording of  a Antonio Carlos Jobim song. Most times with positive results. This cd includes three tunes by Jobim and also includes songs by Rodgers and Hart, Bacharach and David, Lerner and Loewe and others. All winners. Add the talent of Diana Krall on piano and her sensitive reditions of the songs and you have a very enjoyable listening experience.  Her mellow version of \\"I've Grown Accustomed To Her Face\\" brings back memories of 50's torch singer Julie London and Bee Gees's \\"How Can You Mend A Broken Heart\\"  never sounded better. Just add a dry martini, find a comfortable chair, turn down the lights and enjoy a quiet night.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|Great, easy transaction.  Fast shipping, and DVD was exactly as described, brand new.  Thanks!
0800177975|4.0|This movie has a campy charm to it. Self-referential comedy can be fun, as when the \\"real\\" Arnold argues with Maria over plugging his business interests at public events. The Stallone digs are good too. Enjoy this movie for what it is, cotton candy for the mind.

B001FXCE46|5.0|I started my Kings of Leon experience with Aha Shake Heartbreak, which is one of my favorite albums of all time.  This album, at least the first half, couldn't be any more different from the upbeat, progressive-indie-pop type of style that I was used to hearing from Kings of Leon.  If it weren't for the lead singer's distinctive voice, the music would be almost unrecognizable from Aha Shake Heartbreak since it's a little darker, a little more emotional, and a lot slower.  Oddly enough, I like this album just as much as Aha Shake, which is saying a lot.  I would actually recommend buying this album before Aha Shake as it's a little less difficult to \\"get used to\\" if you've never heard Kings of Leon before.  Great album, great band.
B001NLL8LA|1.0|I agree with everyone regarding the price.  I ordered my Kindle2 which should arrive tomorrow and was excited to know that Lee Child's book is out but was disappointed that it was not listed at the $9.99 price.  I'm thinking that maybe I should have stuck with my library membership!
B000W4KT6E|5.0|This remake of Hairspray utilizes the full talents of the star-studded cast. It was funny and upbeat, with a great soundtrack and fun choreography. It truly gets the audience emotionally involved in the story of a plus-sized girl with unpopular opinions fighting for what's right. Even Zac Efron is bearable in this film!
B001V7YWTQ|5.0|This is one of the best Live Concert CDs I have heard in many years. These two rock legends are completely in sync with each other, and very complimetary as well. Listening to this I only wish they had collaborated on more music over the years then their one short stint together in Blind Faith.     The CD covers both careers, as part of bands and solo artists. They also throw in some added covers. As was mentioned elsewhere, they're cover of Hendrix's \\"VooDoo Chile\\" is AWESOME. But it does not start and end on that one tune. Each cut is worth a listen, even Winwood's soulful rendition of \\"Georgia On My Mind\\".     I'm a HUGE Derek and The Dominoes fan, still listing \\"Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs\\" as my favorite album of all time, and I love the cuts from that album, \\"Tell The Truth\\" and again Hendrix's phenominal \\"Little Wing\\".     Their voices mesh well throughout, and I don't need to tell you about Clapton's phenominal guitar work and Winwood's equally great keyboards.    This is definately worth a listen or two or three if you are fans of these two legends, and maybe even if you aren't.
B001FB55HG|3.0|Like most serialized reruns, 'Terminator Salvation' doesn't live up to the originality of the original 'Terminator' film.  It's simply a computerized violent revisitation of a theme now grown stale.<br /><br />At the same time, there will be new viewers who will be fascinated by the concept and the action.  For these people, I recommend that they go back an revisit the original film in which we first enter a world where our mechanical contraptions have become sentient and set out to annihilate the human species.<br /><br />As a action flick, 'Salvation' is OK but, that said, it is a fairly standard action flick.  The humans who are fighting metal robots frequently survive blows that would have killed an elephant.  Not only do they survive them, but jump right up to continue the fight.<br /><br />All in all, it was a quick way to spend an afternoon but, although I saw the film less than a week ago, most of the details have slipped away....<br /><br />Ron Braithwaite author of novels--'Skull Rack' and 'Hummingbird God'--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico.
032147404X|4.0|I like the style and the spirit of this book.  The author's writing style is far too corny and frankly a waste of paper in some cases.  The information seems to be credible and accurate, but this is sort of the hitchhiker's guide to photography.  If you're looking for a fun sort of trial and error type of guidebook, this would be a good one.
0670020745|2.0|I was looking forward to this book, but found it disappointing.  I work with brain-injured people for a living and was highly skeptical by the story's end.  It just didn't jive with what I see in my practice every day.  Very simplistic writing style.
0739341340|5.0|One of the very best reads for anyone looking to make a positive impact.  Very well done.
0930289234|5.0|This is will be my favorite book I have ever read. The story revolves around Rorschach a vigilante superhero as he tries to do 2 things, unravel the mystery behind the murder of Edward Blake also known as The Comedian, and gather the other members of the Watchmen. My 2 favorite Watchmen are Rorschach and Dr. Manhattan. I am reading the book 1st because the DVD comes out this summer and I wanna see if there are alot of references to the book. I recomend this book.

B000U0F7RG|4.0|So I got this for my wife who loves the Gilmore Girls. I got some major \\"points\\" with this purchase and she still tells me how much she loves it. She has watched every episode and is waiting for my sister's pending visit to go through the episodes they miss when watching television (seems they play most of the way through but stop prior to getting to the end of the series).    One problem - disc 24 would not play. It was not recognized by my primary DVD player or other players I tried it on. After contacting Amazon, they said it was past the normal return period but they will honor the return anyway, for customer satisfaction purposes. I am not really all that happy with having to return ALL the discs when only one is \\"bad\\" but I need to get the issue resolved. Will let ya know how that turns out.    Also, the box the set comes in is pretty cheezy. Too tall to store in a normal DVD rack of any sort. And the handle broke right away. Wish it was packaged a little better / simpler.    All-in-all, a good product, reasonable price and worth it for anyone that loves Gilmore Girles.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|I'm loving LOST, but I'm really hating the 3rd season. While I understand that we need to get to know The Others and what motivates them i have to wonder did they have to be made so damn annoying? They beat, imprison, hunt down and generally have no sense of hospitality and then they want favors. Irksome is the word that comes to mind.  But I love this series and I know that once I get past this hateful season all will be well again...right?

XD  Besides that, when I see these computer animated film titles Im somewhat hesitant sometimes, after seeing meet the robinsons.  This film, I thought AT FIRST, was to be dumb based on the title and general 'idea' of the plot. *flames welcomed*  My nephew called me when he found it on HBO and asked me to watch it with him. I sat down and watched the movie.  I was very pleased with it. In fact, I thought it was very creative and I enjoyed it.  I am planning to buy the dvd and those who hate it, can give the dvd to me. So I like this movie and its one for me to keep. ^_^
0316036692|5.0|A very interesting book with some new concepts that I had never even figured were possible. For example, the concept that anyone is ever, ever an \\"overnight success\\".  Apparently, there is no such thing.  Anyone that appears to be an overnight success has already spent at least 10,000 hours learning their craft. This book has forever changed the way I think about success and it's achievement.  Most of us may be doomed to mediocrity.

0307386171|1.0|This book would never have been published if it were submitted by an unknown writer.  I don't believe even in England in 1962 there were people who were so completely innocent of sexual knowledge and common sense.  After all, though, McEwan was only 14 in the year in which his story is set, and he may be like so many people who think sex was a big secret until they themselves were practicing it.

I looked everywhere for these books and this was the best price....and they are hard cover, which are way more durable for the younger readers!  Very cute cartoons, and it makes the little guys think they are reading huge chapter books, the point is to get them to read, and enjoy it. These books do just that.
B001FB4W0W|1.0|I have read most of the Sookie Stackhouse books.  I really liked them.    I watched the first season of Blood Ties on DVD, because of the books.  If I had watched this show on HBO, I would never have purchased the set.  I realize that movies and TV shows are usually not as good as the books, but D___.  I only watched the whole season, because it was a little expensive, and I didn't want to watch one or two episodes and declare it a bad show.      There was way too much gratuitous sex and violence. The actors were neither attractive or in any way likeable.  The acting was bad.  It was way too much like really bad porn.  It was more like the middle to later books of the Laurell K Hamilton Anita Blake series, all flash and no substance.     The fact that Charlaine Harris (from what I could find on a search) seem to think it was just fine, lowers my opinion of her and makes me question my good opinion of the Sookie Stackhouse books.    I ended up giving the set to a person with a stronger stomach, and will never no way purchase or watch this show again.  I haven't decided about reading the few books of the series that I haven't read yet.    I almost forgot, I did like the character that played Sookie's grandmother.
0810970686|5.0|I bought all 4 books from the WImpy Kid series for my soon to be 8 yr old! He loves them. Already read one whole book. And I got them just in time for him to read over the summer. I looked everywhere for these books and this was the best price....and they are hard cover, which are way more durable for the younger readers!  Very cute cartoons, and it makes the little guys think they are reading huge chapter books, the point is to get them to read, and enjoy it. These books do just that.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|If you like albums that contain same-ish songs, look somewhere else, this is a fantastic variety of catchy pop, ballads, and other amazing offerings.  Sara has done a great job of putting together a piece of work that keeps toes tapping and the repeat buttons pressed.  Her top 40 \\"Love Song\\" in my opinion is only the tip of the iceberg.  Listen to \\"Vegas\\", \\"One Sweet Love\\", and \\"Love on the Rocks\\" just see how nicely varied her music is.  \\"Fairytale\\" is one of my favorites for the lyrics, and I love the chances she took here with being humorous, truthful, and emotionally invested in her writing.  I don't get tired of this album at all, and smile when I hear her songs come up on my playlist every time.

B0007LGCB8|2.0|I so-o wanted these to work for me as they are stylish and rugged.  Unfortunately, they were too narrow for my regular 10.5 foot.  (A Keen lace-up of that size fits me perfectly!)  They also felt stiff regardless of how much I tried to break them in.  Further, as the insole is designed for draining away water, it was not as comfortable as I would have liked for normal wear on the streets or gentle trails.

B001P3SA94|3.0|Thumbs down. Why can't Hollywood stick to the facts, especially when true events are more interesting and translatable to the screen? Why?<br /><br />1 star for making a mostly fictional movie. 3 stars for music and performances.<br />I wish a real artist of a director had brought to the screen this important history and done so with a much better script that stuck to the well known historical facts. This is an okay film about an epic, original, only-in-America story that deserved nothing short of first-rate film treatment. \\"Cadillac Records\\" does have a fantastic cast. The actor playing Howlin' Wolf is great for example, but the script paints a slightly embarrassing and arguably one-dimensional portrait of the man while focusing almost entirely on Muddy Waters, played by the talented Jeffrey Wright. But Wright doesn't look or talk like Muddy. Adrien Brody plays Leonard Chess (looks nothing whatsoever like him) while the film entirely omits the existence of the other brother and partner with whom he made music history! The film does succeed in capturing the typical rip-off deals owners made with their musicians back in the day and hence the title of the film. Chess Records is named \\"Cadillac Records\\" here because the brothers Chess preferred paying their musicians with a nice, shinny Cadillac over money. I do like how the more rural, seemingly less sophisticated Howlin Wolf turns down the car, preferring the money he is owed. Howlin Wolf deserved a bigger portrayal in this film. Includes Mos Def in an entertaining turn as Chuck Berry and in one of the films more cinematic moments there is a black and white mug shot of Chuck Berry juxtaposed with color footage of happy, white surf boarders on either side of it while \\"Surfin' USA\\" is playing: The Beach Boys took the melody from a Berry song (\\"Sweet Little Sixteen\\"). \\"Cadillac Records\\" does a good job portraying the racial discrimination and societal changes these performers endured. The lovely Beyonce Knowles ably plays Etta James and she is nice to look at, but the portrayal of James in the film is misleading. She already had a career before hooking up with Chess and speaking of hooking up, it isn't clear she did with Leonard. And Leonard doesn't die while driving away from the studio after selling it.<br /><br />All in all, a paint by numbers level quality here, loose with the facts and liberal with so-called \\"artistic license\\" film that's perhaps a slight step above television production due to a talented cast. It's maybe worth a look, especially if you enjoy Hollywood treatments of music history. But in my opinion music history is seldom done justice by Hollywood and it wasn't with this film.s and she is nice to look at, but the portrayal of James in the film is misleading.

B00004RF9B|5.0|Excellent sci-fi! BUT...the DVD holder was created in 1999 and the cheap plastic that holds the disc is brittle and breaks allowing the disc to move freely and become scratched by the broken plastic during shipment. The holders made after 2000 are better quality plastic and more dependable. Recycle the brittle holders and use a holder that protects instead of taking a chance. I'll pay another dime for it.
0385340575|4.0|I liked it and read it in about 24 hours. The list & \\"suicide\\" bomber was a neat start and I loved the finale except for one point, (Reload!) but that set up a good climax. Child does his research and it shows but every now and then he lets something show through that he didn't grow up in America. I don't mind and actually enjoy spotting the gaffes.
B0007N1AI6|4.0|Judas Priest was back and once again....um...screaming for vengeance as Robert Halford was back where he belonged, fronting the band that perhaps more than any other over the past forty years has defined heavy metal. `Angel of Retribution' is a fine record, not a classic but as good as any record they had made since `British Steel'.  Reunions can be a mixed back but long time fans knew that the only way for Priest to be relevant again was with Rob back. He sure doesn't disappoint on `Angel' and all other performances are spot on as well. The does name check the past quite an awful lot which can be annoying to some, didn't bother me much but it does make it a little too nostalgic. Speaking of which, \\"Deal with the Devil\\" is autobiographical and tongue and cheek at the same time, referencing both the band's origins in the Midlands at the beginning of the `70's to the complaints of many right wing non-metal enthusiasts over the music's \\"demonic\\" image, ironic because that wasn't a very common topic in most of Priest's catalogue compared with other bands of their ilk. \\"Judas Is Rising\\" as lead song is perfect, what better way to announce to the world that you're back than by saying it on track #one? \\"Revolution\\", \\"Worth Fighting For\\" and \\"Angel\\" are all very atypical Priest numbers and all have their shining moments. \\"Hellrider\\" and \\"Demonizer\\" are more typical but the former is probably the best song on the record, doing what Priest does best! My only complaint is \\"Loch Ness\\" which is ponderous, silly and way too long! Oh well, much like `Painkiller', not perfect but it gives the people what they want, which was Rob Halford back on that Harley!
B00260HH3K|1.0|Do not even waste your money on this 'slap-to-the-face-of-db-fan-movie'. The story is so rushed that half the time one wonders what just happened? The special effects are so cheesy. Goku never went to school. Goku was never supposed to know what a girl is. Goku was never supposed to know cities existed.    To summarize the whole movie. Basically over 150+ episode were crammed into this 1hr+ movie, which translate to failure, rush, characters appearing out of the blue. Very very poor movie. It is a disgrace to use the word 'DragonBall' in this.
B001TH16DS|4.0|This is the best quality of the original Star Trek series to date. I bought the double episode discs as well as the previuos season series DVD's and besides the convienance of needing less space for storage, the Blu-Ray quality is superb. The discs can be viewed with either the original graphics or the new computer generated graphics which encompass mainly exterior shots of space. I think if I were to wish for an improvement, it would be for a wide screen version that would fill the entire screen. Amazon did sell this at a great price for which I am greatful.

B00192KCQ0|5.0|My title says what I think of this album, glad to have the old Metallica sound back.  KILLER ALBUM
B000002VTE|3.0|Spiritualized's most known entry is a diverse enough collection of distorted orchestrations which thrive off repetition to hold up on repeated listens, though a swelling cacophony often merely disguises compositions that can drag instead of elevating like intended.
1439138311|4.0|Unlike other critically acclaimed books, the ending of this book flows naturally and makes sense with everything that comes before it.     The simple language suits the modest nature of the main character, but it will bore people who prefer stylistic pyrotechnics.    I like how the dialogue dovetails with my mother's own stories of her life in Ireland and, later, in the U.S. It's far more accurate than the writings of Frank McCourt, etc.
0060594896|3.0|I did not rate this book a success.  Not for me anyway.  Section 5 Success and Money was by far the most interesting chapter.  The rest of the book I had read before by other well known authors.  I felt there was nothing new.  Principles from The Secret, Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill and The Magic of Thinking Big by David Schwartz and a number of other authors came out time and again.  I was just disapointed with having read it all before.
B001IBIQU6|1.0|Love Depeche Mode from the bottom of my heart.  Always have.  Just cannot get into this album.  I'm trying really hard to give it a chance, but it's just making me cringe.  I'd borrow it and take a listen before buying.
B000O75F7C|4.0|Well, let me just say that this album instrumentally is FLAWLESS. First listen was such an amazing experience, and it does sound like the PT we all know, but some parts are heavier than they've ever been! Which i don't mind at all being a huge Progressive metal fan. And yes, the trippy pink floyd type feel remains.<br /><br />My only beef with this album is the Lyrics...<br />Steven Wilson has shown in the past to be an incredible lyricist. But it feels like he was catering to 17 year old basement dwelling boys who lack the necessary social skills to keep them off their PC or X box all day. For example... Steve sings \\"much easier to talk to my PC\\" ... or \\"Xbox is a god to me/ A finger on the switch/ My mother is a bitch/ My father gave up ever trying to talk to me\\"<br /><br />I'll move on to the songs as wholes.<br /><br />Fear of a Blank Planet - Reminds me a lot of Deadwing's opening title track. Great fast paced acoustic guitar riff that eventually leads into some beautiful prog metal heavier riffs. But this song contains some of the worst lyrics in my opinion ever to be released. It's about a terminally bored teenager on drugs. 8/10<br /><br />My Ashes - The softest on the album, but WILL be stuck in your head. Fantastic feel, and a hooky chorus that seems to flow so smoothly, which we know is trademark Porcupine Tree. 8.5/10<br /><br />Anesthetize - Almost 18 minutes long. The word EPIC comes to mind. This song builds and builds over top of steven's mediocre lyrics about a bored teenager with the curse of \\"there must be more\\", however this doesn't seem to hinder the song's ability to captivate. THis lies all in the instrumentals. Very heavy at times. Great guitar solo from guest ALex Lifeson of Rush. Awesome/ definately a hightlight. 9.5/10<br /><br />Sentimental - This is my favourite track on the album. Beautiful rolling piano instrumentals begin the song as steven sings \\"I never want to be old/ And I don't want dependence, Anymore\\". The song leaves you very contemplative, not just because of the lyrics but also the instrumentals' raw power. (though you will notice that the \\"Trains\\" riff is recycled here). 10/10<br /><br />Way out of Here - Ok, the depressed teenagers must LOVE this album! We've mentioned boredom on most songs and gadgets/ schools are mentioned again on this one. Despite it's terrible lyrics, the song does pull through with awesome building instrumentals and some of the best drumming that we've heard from Gavin Harrison. He's a song saver. 8.5/10<br /><br />Sleep Together - Upon first listening to this song, i wasn't too impressed, and i'll blame it on reading reviews before hand that said it was unimpressive. After more listens, i totally disagree. This song has a very raw sound and eerie sound, especially in the chorus. After the halfway point, the song takes a build that proves to be very satisfying, and even orchestral instruments are used to give the song its monstrous feel. Great Ending! 9/10<br /><br />Overall, If you listen to Porcupine tree for their fantastic and often relatable lyrics (in absentia comes to mind), then you may not love this album. HOwever, if they're incredible instrumental musicianship always amazes you (much like myself) you will most like thoroughly enjoy this album. A short but sweet six song Prog-assault on the mind.

B001EYGOEM|5.0|I love this album.  There aren't too many singers out there who write their own songs and know how to play an instrument.  Yet, Taylor Swift does and she's just a teenager.  I like just about every song on this CD.  I also like how it has the music video on it for \\"Love Story\\".

B001GCUO1G|5.0|The first thing to remember about X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE is that it is based on a comic book (admittedly, one I have not read).  If you can remember that, and take this movie as it is meant to be, then WOLVERINE is extremely entertaining.  Just suspend your disbelief and enjoy the ride.<br /><br />X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE is a sort of prequel to the X-Men trilogy of films.  In WOLVERINE, we learn about two half-brothers, Victor and James, who are born in the 1800s, both with unusual characteristics.  It seems that these two young mutants are virtually indestructible.  Living through the better part of two centuries, fighting war after endless war, Victor and James become killing machines, better known as Sabrertooth and Wolverine.  The brothers eventually get pulled into a super-secret government unit, whose purpose is unclear, but deadly for those who defy it.  However, James is getting tired of it all, while Victor is starting the like it much too much.  James walks out, walks away, and tries to retire from all the killing.  Unfortunately, as he soon discovers, it isn't easy to walk out on the US Government.  Suddenly, members of the old team are being murdered, and it is up to James to stop the killer.  But, of course, there is more to the story than meets the eye.<br /><br />WOLVERINE starts of with a bang and never slows down.  The action is fast-paced, butt-kicking, and fun.  While the comic book plot is a bit predictable, it is still everything that you want it to be, and more.  The locations and settings are beautiful, the stunts over the top, and the acting great and appropriate to this genre.  Hugh Jackman is WOLVERINE; he has taken this character through four movies and really made it his own.  Liev Schreiber is positively sinister as Sabretooth, radiating violence and malevolence at every turn.  As for Stryker, the leader of the super-secret government unit played by Danny Huston, you pretty much hate him, just as you are supposed to.  The rest of the cast does a fine job, and you get a glimpse of the X-Men movies to come.  Overall, the continuity from Wolverine to the X-Men films is correct and cohesive.<br /><br />X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE is not a deep movie; it won't change your life.  But if you want an action-packed, well done, enjoyable flick, then go see it.  Your time and money will be well spent.ine job, and you get a glimpse of the X-Men movies to come.

Veckatimest takes time to get to know. The first few listens may not immediately sink in. For me, it was around the 5th full listen (yes, I was just drawn to listen to it that much the first day I got it) that it hit me like a bag of bricks: This is brilliant.    So, give it time. Get to know the album and you will be reward more with each listen. You'll see.
0812580346|4.0|Every waking person on the planet falls unconscious at the same time. While unconscious, they are witness to a few moment of their lives decades in the future. How did it happen? How does it change the world? Is what they saw set in stone? And what about the people who didn't see anything?    It's a man's book (you know, subtle differences in style...a bit dry) but it's SUCH a compelling idea to base a plot on it really couldn't go wrong. But yeah, a the characters and their interactions where all very secondary to the Big Idea.

B001P3SA94|4.0|Yes, the film is flawed, takes a lot of creative license, could have possibly had better casting of some characters, skipped over many important events and persons, but if taken for what it is, on it's own merits, rather than what it is not, the film is quite enjoyable.  For a blues lover like myself, especially the Chess Records acts, it's a must-own and has long been over-due.
B001FB4W0W|3.0|I received by True Blood season 1 set and watched it this weekend.  The series is WONDERFUL but the last two disc's were bad and skipped.  Thats two disc's that were annoying and kept skipping, don't know that i would recommend purchasing this from Amazon if this is the quality they provide.
B0001BKAEY|4.0|Keanu is not given a majority of time in this movie, but there's plenty of great action!  It all winds down to a satisfactory ending, but there's something about it that just makes me wonder if it's really over.....
0783225733|5.0|Apollo 13 (Widescreen Collector's Edition) (1995)- I only wish to add my five star vote and name to the list of happy customers. This film was like nothing I have ever seen on the big screen before!<br /><br />I wish to draw attention to the fact for those who do not know that Apollo Command module footage was taken under actual zero gravity conditions aboard an aircraft flying parabolic arcs, and if I am not getting my films mixed up, the space suits were actually ventilated and extremely realistic.<br /><br />Some of the details of the Launcher Umbilical Tower were wrong (like the motions of the swing arms) but visually very exciting. This film left no stone unturned to make it the most exciting movie of the space age. Ron Howard really goes to great lengths to do really fine work!
B000F8O35U|5.0|My daughter was thrilled to get \\"The Little Mermaid\\" after her dance recital since one of her dances was \\"The Little Mermaid\\".  I was so glad that I was able to find it online.  Even my 4 year old son enjoyed it, even though at first he didn't really want to watch a \\"princess\\" movie!  He already wants to watch it again!
B000A0GYD2|5.0|From the Earth to the Moon - The Signature Edition (1998)- Tom Hanks and Ron Howard have done it again! This great five star made for TV documentary is the best, most accurate and enjoyable I have ever watched!  It covers the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs in great detail and made it possible for us to see what happened using very accurate and credible CGI.<br /><br />So many wonderful things have already been said about this film that I only need to add that no short cuts were taken and technical consultants were used to make this film as accurate as possible. Animations of events we could only imagine were realistically presented by state of the art special effects. Needless to say excellent performances and casting had much to do with the quality of this film.  I don't know how Ron Howard so consistently does great work, but I wish he had more time to make more of his wonderful, wonderful movies.
1416550542|3.0|I loved Kate Morton's first novel, The House at Riverton and I was really looking forward to reading her second. Both novels share the multi-generational style of story telling, but I found The House at Riverton much easier to follow with more interesting characters.<br /><br />The narration of The Forgotten Garden was confusing at times. The first half of the novel kept switching time lines and character POVs just as you were coming to know them. Very frustrating and I almost gave up on it. A cleaner structure to tell her story would not have taken away from the mystery, but improved it. Morton's use of foreshadowing allowed me to figure out who Nell's mother was long before it was revealed (there were a few red herrings, but not enough to deter the reader's realization). When writing a mystery, it is best to use only a few hints otherwise the climax is ruined.<br /><br />The second half was more of a page turner because we stayed with characters and time lines a lot longer. The chapters dealing with Eliza and Rose were my favorites, even though they were heartbreaking. Like The House at Riverton, The Forgotten Garden deals with the jealous relationship that often exists between women when a man is added to the equation. The ending was sad, yet it remained sweet at the same time.<br /><br />As other reviewers have stated, this novel does resemble The Thirteenth Tale by Diane Setterfield, but it also borrows from The Ghost Writer by John Harwood. I'm a big fan of those books and it was a huge let down to see the unique style (and even some plot points) repeated in The Forgotten Garden. Kate Morton says in her Acknowledgements that she was inspired by stories she read as children (The Secret Garden and the Grimms Brothers Fairytales). Unfortunately, Morton rolled all of the aforementioned titles together to make up most of her novel.

B000000WFZ|5.0|I saw the Mission in 1987 when it first debuted.  I loved it then and I love seeing it again on DVD two decades later.  The music is beautiful; the story tragic, with a strong cathartic ending which  enriches the story well-chosen.  Robert De Nero and Jeremy Irons work well together here along with the Anglo-American-Irish and Latin American support cast.       The South American setting with its breath-taking scenery could not be improved upon anywhere else in the world.  The native tribes too are genuine and their story and lives are worth preserving for the sake of all humanity.         The human tragic story is life-affirming and not totally despairing.  The quotation from the gospel of John stating that the light of God's  love will not be dissolved by the darkness of this tragedy and others  tragedies.        Our species on this planet needs to improve - two centuries later- and The Mission emphasizes this from beginning to end.

1416550542|5.0|I just finished reading this book on my kindle (the first book I read on it) And, I just loved this book. It keeps you guessing till the end.<br />The story is in mostly three different views: 2005 with Cassandra the granddaughter, 1975 with Nell the one trying to figure out her past and 1900 with Eliza. It is a great story. I think my favorite time to read was when it was Eliza's story and everything that happened in the past.<br />I really liked how you read about something in one era and then it is described again in another era and gives you more of what is going on. All the questions I had during the book were answered and it was very interesting to read through it all.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone :)

B001BPJJ9G|5.0|This is probably the most underrated movie i have ever seen.  I walked into a video store one weekend and couldn't find a movie to watch so the person working the counter suggested 'The Fall'.  I was a bit skeptical, but this movie blew me away!  I'd suggest it to anyone who enjoys breathtaking cinematography along with stunning locales. Easily my favorite movie.
1433502410|4.0|The Physical Characteristics of the Study Bible    The pages of this study Bible are beautifully printed and laid out. The many diagrams, charts and other illustrations, most in color, are attractive and can be very helpful. The Bible text is in a single column format, similar to that used in some editions of the NASB, while the notes are in two columns per page.    Several sizes of text and styles of fonts are used. Readers who have problems with close-up vision should probably try to see a copy of this study Bible in person before purchasing, because the print used for the study notes and references is quite small.    The fact that the references are located in the inner margins of the pages makes it difficult to add your own references in that location. In addition, since the reference columns are narrow and the print used in them is very small, placing them in the inner margin, where the pages have a sharp curve away from the reader can distort the appearance of the letters, making the references that much more difficult to read. In my opinion, placing the references at the outer edges of the pages, as has been done in a number of single column editions of the NASB, is much better.    Some have commented that they prefer Bibles having two columns per page. I much prefer the single column format as is used in this study Bible. Not only do I find the page appearance to be much more attractive, especially in the case of poetical portions of Scripture, but with double column Bibles the columns tend to strike me as closely spaced jumbles of words and letters that are harder to sort through when searching for verses or subjects. Furthermore, after a few years of using a Bible with the single column format, I tend to find that the words and letters on many of the pages have a specific pattern that forms a picture in my mind that makes it easy for me to know before I even turn to the page where on the page a topic I want to turn to is found. With a double column format,most pages tend to look pretty much alike to me.    I realize that the ESV as a translation existed in the form used in this study Bible well before this study Bible was published, and this meant that the publishers of the study Bible had to use the translation in what presumably is the only form available. Nevertheless, since the ESV is an \\"essentially literal\\" translation, I wish it had used italics to denote those words that are not in the Hebrew and Greek.    Because of the huge amount of study notes and other material this study Bible contains, it is very heavy compared to other study Bibles. Some have said it is too heavy to take to church, and that may be true for some people. I was pleased to find that it fits into my Bible case that has a handle, and although it is heavier than my NASB Study Bible that had occupied that place formerly, I have not found it unreasonable to take it to church.    The Study Notes    In a study Bible such as this, where different scholars are assigned to supply the notes for each book of the Bible, it is to be expected that the quality of the notes for the many books of the Bible will be uneven. At the same time, though, presumably each scholar was chosen for his book because he was considered to have a high level of expertise in that particular book. Nevertheless, the executive and general editors acknowledge the imperfections of people, presumably including their own editing of the notes, when they say, \\"We are very aware, however, that anything we do will always be less than perfect and subject to error.\\" For the most part, I have so far been favorably impressed with the notes, but there have been exceptions.    The comment by the gentleman (perriggipees \\"Pete\\") who obviously has a Lutheran background is well-taken. He is disappointed that a study Bible that claims to have the perspective of \\"classic evangelical orthodoxy, in the historic stream of the Reformation\\" would not contain in appropriate places in the notes some comments touching on the sacramental theology views of certain groups such as Lutherans (certainly Luther had something to do with Reformation doctrine!), Roman Catholics, sacrament-minded Anglicans, and Eastern Orthodox. I would not be surprised if it would take all of three extra pages to do this. When one considers that this study Bible has 2752 pages, including such comments seems a small price to pay to make this study Bible more attractive to a wider audience, not to mention providing all users a better understanding of where others who consider themselves to be Christians stand on these matters.    In other areas where Christians are known to disagree, however, I have frequently been pleased that the notes present several views in a fairly balanced manner. I have also been similarly pleased that the notes have presented what is, in my opinion, a correct analysis of certain passages that certain groups of people have distorted to support their desires. But at other times I have been disappointed, as the notes have failed to comment at all on certain passages that I believe shed light on areas that are also distorted by some Christians and may in fact be potentially distorted in some of these notes. Of course, I realize that when I say this, I am assuming that I have the corner truth!    For example, I turned to 1 Cor. 12:7 to look for comments that explain the meaning and implications of the phrase \\"manifestation of the Spirit,\\" particularly in view of some of the comments made in the notes for the verses that follow, which list the manifestations of the Spirit. To my dismay, the notes totally ignored commenting on that verse and term, in spite of its obvious importance in properly understanding the verses that follow. Having checked a number of older commentaries in Bible software that I own, I noted that those commentaries were not so reluctant to state the most obvious implications of the phrase \\"manifestation of the Spirit\\" and of its application to the verses that follow its appearance.    As another example, consider John 9:1ff, where Jesus in v.3 clearly says that the man in this episode was born blind, not because he or his parents had sinned, \\"but that the works of God might be displayed in him.\\" Use of the words \\"but that\\" indicates that there was a purpose behind his being born blind. For there to have been a purpose, there must have been One who purposed, and it is obvious that this was God. The notes for v.3, however, say that God \\"allowed\\" him to be born blind, as if God had no control in the situation and as if to remove responsibility from God for the fact that the man was born blind. But surely, no matter how we phrase it, God, the One who purposed it, was ultimately responsible for the blindness of the man. If we express it negatively using a dictionary definition, the responsible party becomes even more obvious, because to allow is \\"to neglect to restrain or prevent.\\" In other words, for the notes to use the word \\"allow\\" seems like an attempt to take responsibility from God and to place it somewhere else.  Note also that when Jesus uses the word \\"displayed,\\" He clearly indicates that the main purpose was so that others would be able to see that God had healed him. Rather than agreeing with the text and Jesus in this matter, the notes strangely limit the purpose by saying that God allowed the blindness simply so that the man could \\"experience God's mercy and power in delivering\\" him, as if God had no purpose in this healing display for others who were involved in the situation. I note again that a number of older commentaries are not reluctant to agree with what the text actually says, namely that God was responsible for the man's being born blind in order to display His power to the unbelieving world. In fact this purpose is then borne out in remainder of chapter 9, which describes the effects of this healing on the man's parents, neighbors and unbelieving Pharisees.    More examples could be given. Whatappear to be occasional attempts to water down the meaning of texts that some find difficult to accept, apparently in order to make the Word of God more palatable to critics of Christianity, to those among the masses who may think like these critics, or to certain Bible teachers and their followers, are troubling.    My Rating    If I could, I would give this study Bible 4.5 stars, because I really do like it, but the weaknesses I have cited above prevent me from being comfortable giving it five stars. I feel less bad about giving four stars, though, since for Amazon's overall average rating, the overwhelming majority of people who have given it five stars far outweigh the four I feel compelled to give.
0199535981|5.0|This little book was resting on my bookshelf for years until, having read everything else (or been halfway through some really difficult ones and having got stuck), one day I decided to give it a chance. I thought it was going to make for a pretty boring reading to be honest. After all it is not so much about the plot or the fiction as it is about its peering into the human psychic and philosophy. Henry is the by far the most interesting character. His conjectures and theories are what makes this book worth reading. Although very popular reading material in my earlier years, I would not recommend it to young people; there's stuff you have to have lived through to really appreciate.
B001AVEJ1Y|1.0|There were two Star Trek movies that rekindled and ultimately saved the franchise. The Wrath of Khan rescued the series from mothballing after the underwhelming performance of Star Trek the Motion Picture. And this new Trek intended to reboot the series, ala Casino Royale, at the first time in decades where a Trek series isn't playing on TV (barring re-runs and syndication). Both succeeded in keeping the series alive, but where Khan raised the bar so high that other Trek films struggled to follow, the new trek simply drops it to the floor.    To a degree the two films are mirror images of each other. Both have villains plotting revenge, not just on the Federation, but on specific members of the Enterprise's crew. Both villains are patient enough to bide their time for the right moments. In both films the Enterprise must face the enemy alone. In both there is a terrible doomsday weapon meant for good but twisted to evil ends. Ultimately, in both Kirk must navigate a successful strategy between pure logic and raw emotion, charting a winning middle ground between archetypes of Spock and McCoy.     My biggest issue with the new Trek is that like much of pop culture today it's crass and tacky. Like Paris Hilton forgetting her underthings I get the same sort of underside glimpse of Trek I never really wanted to see. Kirk in his whitey tighties, check. Uhuru down to her skivvies, check. Spock in a tongue wrestling full mouth kiss, check. Kirk chewing and apple through the Kobayashi Maru? Retch.     Kirk's womanizing is a perfect illustration of how tacky the new Trek is. The classic Shatner Kirk didn't need to drop pick up lines on every babe he came into contact with, he had the confidence and strength of character for the babes to decide to drop themselves into his lap. The tail chasing is exactly the type of superficial behavior expected of the twenty-nothing music store clerks or barista of today, not a man destined to take command of a capitol class naval vessel. Theold Kirk was cocky and confident in a quiet `I know and don't need to say it' kind of way. The new Kirk is a worse actor in one regard, he's unable to show that same innate confidence and instead has to shout it to the audience at every opportunity. Maybe an updating of the character for modern times, but it's not a good change, it's just tacky and superficial.    It's a ship full of rebelly goodness. Kirk is so rebel that he's got a criminal record, starting with car theft. Spock is so rebel he decides to punk slap his culture's most revered traditions. Uhuru is such an uber-rebel that an interracial kiss isn't enough (kudos to the original show for having the stones to be the first to trod upon that taboo) she also has an interspecies (extraxeno?) affair. How does the Federation, let alone a single starship, even function with so many chiefs running around?     Both films also deal with technology intended for good that get warped to evil ends. They differ greatly in their treatment however. In Khan the Genesis Device is treated with as much significance as the Manhattan Project, it has the power to alter the power dynamic of that universe. Even before coming into direct contact with it the characters discuss the implications of such a technology, exactly what good sci-fi does, question. The new Trek uses it's \\"red matter\\" that can cause black holes as just a plot device, something to be loaded onto a ship and rushed to the bits of the movie that need action. The new Trek is the crassest sort of sci-fi around, sci-fi that used only to add more special effects to the non-stop action sequences. If the action stops and Ms Hilton thinks for a moment we may just end up seeing more body parts we didn't want to.    And that earlier mentioned scene of Kirk chewing an apple through the Kobayashi Maru does nothing but draw attention to the dramatic differences between the two films. The new Trek references Khan in several instances , the Kobayashi Maru, Kirk's refusal to accept the no-win situation, even the parasite that attaches to the victims brain stem. Yet when compared to its mirror counterpart the new Trek is but a shadow. A pretender to the same throne. Khan had something few movies accomplish successfully (and even fewer sci fi movies), it was rich in theme, memes that transcends the mere story. Khan dealt seriously both on and off screen with the subject of old age and passing the torch on to new generations. Spock readies Lt Saavik for the responsibilities of being a captain, Kirk discovers a son he's never known, Khan has his surrogate, Joquim, who dies in his arms, even Scotty has a nephew just starting as an apprentice engineer who dies for his elders. Shatner was also not too thrilled to be playing Kirk as someone in his fading years. In fairness few of the other old cast trek films came close to this high mark, but it doesn't help the new Trek's legitimacy to constantly point out that it has a much brighter cousin. Even the best lines of Khan, \\"You have been and always shall be my friend,\\" are lifted in the desperate hope that the emotional impact of the Khan will somehow retain its meaning among the raw sewage dialog, \\"You can handle me anytime,\\" of the new film.    There certainly were other Trek movies as bad as this, but none so vapid, loud, and shallow. This film will soon be completely be forgotten. And possibly remade with an even younger, louder, and more idiotic cast.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I started watching this show when it first came on TV.  I unfortunately did not finish watching the show while it was on TV.  I watched about the first 7 seasons and missed the last 3.  I purchased the complete series so that I could finish the rest of the series.<br />I have watched all of the discs completely through and did not have any issues with the discs skipping, and none of them were damaged.<br />I have to say after finally finishing the last 3 seasons that I didn't get to see while they were still on TV, I could sit and watch all 10 seasons over again.  This show is the funniest show and I truly miss it being on TV.  Its really sad that there are hardly any shows on TV now that can fill the shoes of this show or other shows that were on TV around this time period.  If you have even watched a few of the shows and liked them I would highly recommend purchasing this item, you will not be disappointed and it will keep you laughing for hours and hours.

B001RQ0SJO|5.0|I listened to Two Suns in the dark, and for the first time in countless years I could literally see this music, played out in crystalline streams of color before my eyes, full of darkness and light, love and longing.  It is quite possibly the best album I've heard in years.    On each successive listen, new layers can be peeled out of the songscapes and the meaning of the music evolves over time.  Natasha has painted a surreal world where a struggle seems to be taking place between two forces (note the use of the word \\"battle\\" or \\"battleground\\" in several tracks).  Each track tells its own story, but you can view the work as a cohesive whole as well with various patterns woven together.      Natasha's voice threads the music together but never threatens to overpower it.  She has a versatile tone that can be haunting or uplifting, purely melodic or strangely dissonant, or any of these in the same song.  The music incorporates both organic instruments like piano and tribal drums, and electronic instruments in a way that juxtaposes the organic and the artificial, creating a fascinating sonic environment.    I hate to make comparisons, but if you love Kate Bush, you will love this album--it invokes the same mystery and grandeur that Hounds of Love commands.  I think good things are in store for Miss Khan of Bat for Lashes, but at the end of the day it doesn't matter to me what fame she achieves as long as she keeps creating radiant audio landscapes like this for me to get lost in.      There are only two songs on this record that have yet to grow on me entirely, which is more than I can say for most of the albums I've purchased in the last decade, and my disliking them is a more personal taste than a reflection on the songwriting itself.      Simply put, Two Suns is a gorgeous, magical ride through fantastic songs that will leave you hitting your \\"repeat\\" button for days to come.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|This is an amazing WWII collection. It is a must have for history buffs. The footage shown is so extensive I never knew a history of WWII like this was available. Everything is just absolutely amazing. I highly recommend The World at War.
0790729393|4.0|Sleepers is an unsettling drama featuring an all-star cast. The best performance in the film is Brad Pitt, this role proved he's more than a pretty face. Jason Patric is also terrific here, very under-rated actor. The film deals with abuse, and nothing graphic is shown but you are fully aware about did happen to these boys when they were teens. Great film from a great director, check it out!
0525421033|4.0|If I Stay is a powerful story about a girl named Mia who experiences the many hours between her family's car accident and her hospital ICU stay in an in between life and death state. She has to make a decision -whether to stay or go on -after realizing that her family is dead and gone.<br /><br />If I Stay is 200 pages of heart-wrenching emotion. I was pulled into the story right from the beginning and with each page and with each story Mia had to tell I was pulled deeper into her world. I was emotionally engaged and by the end of the book drained completely. I must admit that I read the book in a bookstore and was crying in said bookstore. I didn't care who would see me because putting the book down to go home and cry in private was not an option.<br /><br />The Characters and relationships are so real. And what I mean by that is that there's real conflict and struggle. Mia and Adam are so different with their different styles and music tastes and friend groups yet it is worked at. No relationship is the peachy Edward/ Bella romance (SORRY!). Forman does well to show how difficult having such a contrasting romance can be and with a family that is so much different from you. On top of that Forman shows a heartwarming eclectic and rich family that is fun, energetic and passionate about life. And that is where Mia's struggle stems from: how can she go on living life, loving life if her loved ones, those that truly loved living are gone.<br /><br />The story is a powerful tale of life and death and the true meaning of friends, family and truly living. Mia is stuck in the in between and she reminisces on her life, her music and her love. In a family where music is a major part of who they are and their personality, Mia's life is intertwined with the notes and melodies of her past. The differences between her music and her families or even her boyfriend Adam's is a testament to how truly diverse life is and how the smallest fragment, music, can be a powerful driving force. Music and Mia's memories are one and the same.<br /><br />Gayle Forman seamlessly intertwines the present and past and at time when I wondered \\"where's this bit going...?\\" she delivers on highly emotional level tugging at my heart strings. The whole story is emotionally charged and you will be constantly sighing and heaving with tears. If I Stay is a true testament to the power a single person can hold and what a lifetime of love and memories can offer. Don't take one second for granted and keep moving. Always keep moving.<br /><br />I give this book a 92/100 A-<br />Characters- 19<br />Plot- 17<br />Writing- 19<br />Originality- 17<br />Re-Readability- 20ies are one and the same.

0956031609|5.0|... that isn't to say that Sarif's writing isn't detailed or internally rich. She is one of the few authors that I've read who is able to tastefully balance inner thoughts/emotions with action/setting description. She is so successful at capturing the subtelties of daily life in her characters' setting that I find myself wanting to travel to places/times that had never crossed my mind. I felt the same reading I Can't Think Straight by Sarif. This novel is simply written but emotionally complex. Stunning! Can't wait to read more by her (and hopefully meet her at SF Frontline screening of the I Can't Think Straight motion picture!)

B001K3JF7K|2.0|Although the album is an easy-listening, I definately miss Ms. Krall's great achievements as \\"I've got you under my skin\\"; \\"The Look of Love\\" and Billy Joel's re-interpretation of \\"Just the Way You Are\\", among many others. It kindda' seems that Diana Krall had nothing better to do on a boring Sunday afternoon but to record some tunes that she thought she could pull off, just because she liked them....she was sorrily mistaken: the album is rather plain, bland and emotionless. This is by Ms. Krall's own standards a half-baked product :o(<br />Hopefully she'll do it right next (fingers crossed!!!)
B001F7XIJW|5.0|Pick this up. You won't be sorry. Gojira is one of the only bands to every really capture that riff or that one chorus that you wish would play on for so much longer than it does. They know it, they own it, they kill it. Plus this album has a guest appearance from Randy Blythe!
B00260HH3K|1.0|Which is the worst movie you have ever seen? Think about it. Now multiply that times 10 and you have Dragonball: Evolution.

The only reason I stayed because my kids had been wanting to see it, but my youngest fell asleep midway and the other two told me afterwards that they thought the movie was dumb(yes, their words!) because it didn't make sense or even follow the cartoon. I have to say I hated this movie more than Catwoman or Battlefield Earth on my part. I don't doubt that this movie in the future will be in the catagory of worst movies ever made. For those who have not seen it, sorry, I'm not going to bother to even summarize the plot because it's just that ridiculous and full of the worst cliches possible.

I wouldn't even pick this DVD up in the $1 bin at Wal-Mart.
B00008PW3O|4.0|In 1997 when Fleetwood Mac, stepped back onto the concert stages of the world, they brought back a handful of new songs and dipped into their past catalog scoring big with a B-Side from a single, twenty years past: \\"Silver Springs.\\" Fans, went on a Mac Attack for the return of FM, but wondered just where, the new album was. It took six years for Fleetwood Mac to release the new album. In 2003: \\"Say You Will\\" was brought forth.<br /><br />The first blow against the record was the loss of Christine McVie. Chris, had retired from FM, and moved back to England. Without Christine, there would be a huge hole to fix. Who would be brought in to replace her? How could she be replaced at all?<br /><br />This version of Fleetwood Mac is:  Mick Fleetwood, John McVie, Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham. This record is slick, electronic, processed pop music. With 18 tracks included, it is a big record in it's scope and size. The songs range from the severe weirdness of Lindsey to Stevie's personal reflections of 9/11. This isn't the same FM that ruled the 1970's & 1980's, these artists are older and wiser. On a whole: \\"Say You Will\\" is darker than past FM records. Sweet sounding songs, such as: \\"Goodbye Baby\\" carry heavy messages in their lyrics as: \\"Don't take me to the tower - And take my child away.\\"<br /><br />There is standout pop/rock music here such as: \\"Thrown Down\\" \\"What's The World Coming To\\" & \\"Steal Your Heart Away\\" invoke Mac's of the past. Lindsey, gets out there about as far as he can at every chance on this record. On: \\"Red Rover\\" acoustic guitars are processed into weird violins, and if you understand what the lyrics are about, your medications are working for you. \\"Peacekeeper\\" is a direct poke at then President Bush {not a popular thing to do in 2003!} \\"Come\\" is a Lindsy Freak-Out, this one will attract life from other galaxies, to visit Earth.<br /><br />This album, represents a different Fleetwood Mac, this isn't: \\"Rumors\\" as much as it isn't: \\"Buckingham/Nicks II.\\" At first this record, is not attractive to your ears, but give it a few more plays, it will draw you in. This music is powerful and very different from past glories, Fleetwood Mac, has grown up.<br /><br />This \\"Deluxe\\" edition of: \\"Say You Will\\" contains a second CD with four tracks on it. \\"Love Minus Zero/No Limit\\" is a reworking of the Bob Dylan classic, Lindsey, turns this Dylan tune inside/out and creates sparkling pop music, it is wonderful to hear just what Lindsey does here. \\"Not Make Believe\\" is a Stevie Nicks song, left off the original record due to space limitations. Live versions of: \\"Say You Will\\" & \\"Peacekeeper\\" are presented. \\"Say You Will\\" is better suited to the live show, because the 'kiddie' vocals are gone, and now without that gimmick the song is allowed more room to breathe. \\"Peacekeeper\\" is a bit less intense than it's studio cousin, but still it carries it's message well.<br /><br />It is hard to believe, that without Christine McVie, there still is Fleetwood Mac. But with this 2003 recording: \\"Say You Will\\" they band continues in doing what no other can....making great pop/rock music into the 21st Century.<br />Four Stars !!!cks II.\\" At first this record, is not attractive to your ears, but give it a few more plays, it will draw you in.

B00006GA48|5.0|Whether this was a commercial album or not, I don't really care.  Grand Funk Railroad changed their style by including some soulful vocal melodies for the Closer to Home album, and while the title song takes me back to my childhood and the summertime memories connected to it, the REST of the album deserves just as much attention and appreciation that the title song receives.      Now I have to sit here and wonder why people aren't mentioning the rest of the songs from the album in the same breath as the title song, when they are ALL just as good as the title song if you ask me.    The band changed for this album with the mellow songwriting and the soulful style, but it's in NO way worse than the classic hard rock/blues guitar workouts that appeared frequently on the previous two GFR albums.      A really good album Closer to Home is, and the fact the band changed their style into one that includes a noticeable soul influence doesn't make it any worse than the previous albums (or future ones for that matter) that have gone on to become near classics for many people.  Closer to Home is just an album that's a bit different from the previous ones, and the album caught the band in between that stage when they were changing their style a little bit.  I love it.
B001AKTZPK|5.0|This album was the one before the big one, Cosmo's factory, but there is plenty of good music here too even if, overall, it cannot match its successor. It opens with a track that would certainly not be out of place on that classic album, Down on the corner. It is about a band, Willy and the poor boys, playing their music on a street corner, hence the album title.<br /><br />Another classic track from this album is Fortunate son, which is a song that finds John showing his bitterness towards those who are born into wealth. Covers of two familiar songs are also included, these being Cotton fields and Midnight special. Creedence Clearwater Revival  mostly recorded original songs but the few covers that they did record were always well-chosen. Of the remaining songs, the highlight may be Feeling blue, which has a real bluesy feel to it, but there's a lot of other great music here.<br /><br />If you're building a collection of original Creedence Clearwater Revival albums, you definitely need this one.
B00006GA4C|5.0|\\"Get This Thing on the Move\\" and \\"Please Don't Worry\\" are solid proof Grand Funk Railroad had some talent, despite some people who like to constantly put the band down for being inferior copycats of other bands.  I LOVE those two songs.  Also I believe \\"Paranoid\\" has some memorable guitar solos and the final track which is nearly 10 minutes long is a MASTERPIECE (\\"nah nah no no no no no NOOOOO!!!!\\").  I love that part.      Some may even claim this is the ultimate Grand Funk album because it sounds so much like a garage rock album with a muddy, old and dated sound thanks to the way the album was recorded.  It never fails to amaze me how a muddy-sounding rock album from the late 60's can have SO much personality, and I believe this may be why Grand Funk could be considered the best album they ever made.      It's hard for me personally to decide which of the bands albums is their very best, but I have to tip my hat to a really solid straight-up rock album the band made with THIS one.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|Next to the \\"Victory at Sea\\" series, \\"World at War\\" is one of the outstanding documentories of World War 2.

I would recomend this video to anyone who has even the least amount of interest in world history, you can't help in getting fascinated with it.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|I believe there are many people who can learn many things from watching this movie but you have to really watch it with an open mind and understand there is more than American style and culture in this world. There is constant battles and struggles with religion and power all around us and among us. When it comes to both it is apparent that people can be diabolical and cruel to whoever and whatever stands in their way of their own beliefs. Just know that if you watch this movie.<br /><br />Of all the things this young man wanted was to be with the one he loved. Money and basic needs didn't even cross his mind. He was so persistant in his exhausting quest for love, all he saw was her. Love overcomes all things that hold people back, and not to sound like some hippie, but I think we all need some of what he had.<br /><br />I do however wish and hope that somebody finds it in their heart to help those poor kids who played in this movie and lived in shacks as portrayed in this movie. I really don't understand how those kids and their families didn't get any money for playing in this movie which made so much money! Honestly it kind of pisses me off to think those 3 kids made this movie, but yet they still live in shacks as portrayed in this movie, or nothing since some of their shacks have been torn down.

B000068OCS|5.0|I remember this film when it first came out.  It was quite a visual experience in the theatre.  It is reduced on DVD but still it is an opportunity to see a fascinating movie.  I really enjoyed it.
B0019M06JS|5.0|I bought this album after hearing some selections on the radio...it is an absolutely wonderful recording of some great music sung by one of the sexiest voices I've ever heard. Now, Miss Elias is no little girl; she's an old pro who has refined her art thru years of experience...and refined it very well, indeed.<br /><br />Bossa Nova is a Brazilian art form that goes back about as far as Miss Elias does...early 1960s. Astrud Gilberto is, of course, the prototype, and the first cut renders homage to her \\"The Girl From Ipanema\\". No comparisons; the voices are just too different. (For the record, I love Astrud)! It has NEVER been sung better, though I confess that, in my mind, I shall always hear it in Astrud's voice. \\"Desafinado\\" and \\"Estate\\" have, of course, been recorded by Astrud, and others. Many of those recordings are beautiful, but, again, none are better.<br /><br />The English selections deserve some comment: Miss Elias has a superb command of our language, and a REALLY sexy accent. Harry Warren's \\"The More I See You\\" is one of my personal favorites. I think it was taken a bit fast, and Carly Simon's version is hard-wired into my brain, but I still loved it. Gershwin's \\"They Can't Take That Away From Me\\", Rube Bloom's \\"Day In Day Out\\", Richard Whiting's \\"Too Marvelous For Words\\": no quibbles. None. Nor with any of the other English numbers.<br /><br />If you get the idea that I'm quite taken with this disc, you're right. It's not all \\"Bossa Nova\\", despite the title, but it's altogether one of the finest recordings I've heard in a LONG time. Great music, great voice, great production. Some cuts more familiar than others, naturally, but you're going to like it ALL. Five stars are WAY too few!!
045122499X|5.0|I loved Pillars of the Earth! This book, I enjoyed equally as much. I didn't want it to end. The characters and plot are so well developed. I would love to read a third story by Follett from this time period. I highly recommend it!
B0000AK7AA|5.0|Casper was always one of my favorites as a child, and this movie adaptation of the series didn't disappoint.  The only thing I can say about this movie that is negative is that some of the language was inappropriate for smaller children.  The premise of a man trying to help ghosts with their psychological issues is wonderful, considering the fact that his wife had recently passed away, and it explains his need to prove to himself that the after-life exists.  Christina Ricci is adorable in this film, she is the ivory soap/sweet heart next door and you can't beat that in a children's film.  Again, the only negative I can say is that some of the language is coarse, not right out swearing, but coarse and not always what I would consider appropriate for small children, but the movie overall is great.
B001F0VHEM|5.0|I've never paid much attention to Pink before, so I can't make any comparison to previous albums, but this one is great.  It's obviously about her problems with her personal life, but the songs are either fun or introspective, and all easy to listen to.  Definitely a keeper.
B001PPLJIQ|5.0|After seeing the movie with Kate Winslet there were a lot of unanswered questions.  How did Michael really feel about Hanna?  Did Hanna really have any feelings for him?  Well, the book answers these questions and more.  It delves deeply into the souls of both Hanna and Michael.  An understanding of the story is much deeper than what I achieved witht he movie!

B000FZEQSM|4.0|This film would be, unfortunately, director Sidney Pollack's last. Boasting a cast of Oscar winners (Kidman and Penn), and a slightly convoluted story, \\"The Interpreter\\" is also gripping entertainment. Pollack begins his story in South Africa with the killing of 2 journalists and then segues to the UN where Kidman as an Afrikanner interpreter works.  As the story slowly unfolds, we find that her knowledge of a planned assasination could put her life in danger and that's where a cynical FBI agent (Penn) comes in to check up on her story.  What begins as a tentative relationship between the two slowly unfolds as they become intricately involved but without actually having a consumative relationship which marred Pollack's own \\"3 Days of the Condor\\" (I could never buy the relationship between Redford and Dunaway).  In this era of short attention spans, Pollack should be applauded for taking his time in developing these relationships as well as slowly involving us in their dilemna (the slight twist near the end was nice).  This film is a fitting testament to the legacy of Sidney Pollack who also uses the widescreen format to excellent effect here.
B001TH16DS|5.0|I'm not a Star Trek fanatic but the original series was a treasure. Back then, I watched it on an old B&W tube TV with horrible over-the-air reception. Imagine my surprise when, with the clarity of Blu Ray, the suits worn by the landing party on one episode looked like they were sewn by an amateur at Joanne's Fabrics! I am enjoying every minute of each episode. A MUST HAVE for any Trekkie.

0756405890|2.0|Based on all of the high reviews this book has, I began reading it with the same anticipation I felt when I started my other favorite fantasy series. With several hundred reviews and a 4 1/2 star rating, how could it possibly disappoint? Well curse my bad luck, because somehow this book turned out to be the biggest snoozer I have read in the past year.    The story starts off traditionally but rather nicely- a dark time has spread across the land, people live in fear, etc, which is very nicely depicted by the fantastic cover art. But soon we are whisked away to the narrator's (a man named Kvothe) past, and unfortunately we are pretty much there to stay. The plot has some original elements and some tense, interesting moments, but for far too much of the book the pace drags tediously along with little meaningful developments. While I was reading it I kept wishing that either 1) something worthwhile would happen to young Kvothe or 2) the flashbacks would cease and the story of present-day Kvothe would continue. Instead, the books main focus is on the adventures of of young Kvothe and his relationships with his schoolmates as well as the young girl he has a puppy-love crush on. Also, do yourself a favor and skip over the parts where Kvothe attempts to sweet talk his crush- those passages were so dorky they made me want to drop the book and never pick it up again. Perhaps this book is targeted more towards the young adult reader and I went in the wrong expectations.    Somehow this book has managed to generate (or engineer) a serious amount of positive feedback here on Amazon, but it is my sincere belief that it is overrated. To what degree it is overrated will probably vary from person to person, but please do yourself a favor and make sure this book is for you before you buy it.
B00136NSUO|5.0|Annie has one of the most distinctive and powerful voices to me in music and is able to perform all kinds of music.  She has come a long way from her early hits such as \\"Sweet Dreams\\" and has changed along the way.  Though I enjoy her older material for what it was (and still is) to me her newer music expands her horizons and showcases her voice.    If you have only heard some of the older hits and expect to find items that are the same, you may not be enamored of the newer material, at least the first time.    But if you listen to her voice and ability to convery a song, and give it a chance you will not be dissapointed.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|This series is mysterious, intense, and at the end of each episode your jaw will drop. I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys action, love, lust, VAMPIRES and entertainment. I enjoy this more than Twilight
B000001FKY|5.0|You already know about Def Leppard and this album, so a detailed review is perhaps pointless...unless you're 17 and only know of Linkin Park and 3 Days Grace as rock bands.    This album (an 18-million seller) is not like those bands of today--it is \\"fun\\" rock, innocent; NOT about anger and drugs (well, not about anger anyway), NOT about suicide and hate, NOT about senseless screaming and repetitive generic guitar riffs and overused double bass.    This music is fun, energetic, about partying, girls, and as Bad @$$ as the 80's could get.  Unforgettable rhythms, solos, and punch. A great album to jam to if you want to hear some real unique songwriting, fun rhythms and classic rock guitar versatility, unmatched in today's modern \\"rock music\\".    Def Leppard has sold over 65 million albums to date, this is the best known...the equivalent of Metallica's \\"Black\\" album.
B000C3H4M2|5.0|Interesting thing is the more I know where the title of this album comes from the more I like it,and can relate it to this particular album. Ever since the beginning of time the first musicians always used the medium in order to express concepts they could'nt always put into words.And during this era everyone was putting that theory into heavy duty practice,from prog-rockers to punks:that being the case it looks like the two genres had at least one thing in common lol.Lyrical freedom became an issue with censors more and more,hense \\"fear of music\\".And even though this album isn't explicit lyrically,it is very much about these factors. This album This album is the Talking Heads third time out,and their second coming with Brian Eno at the console. The Talking Heads/Eno collaboration at this point was very much a functional entity;David Byrne and Eno's creative ego wasn't yet causing the huge conflict in the band so there was a lot of band activity still happening here.This was also the final album to use only the original quartet of David,Tina,Chris and Jerry as the main musicians until the end of the \\"expanded heads\\" era. While very much rooted in the edgy,arty alt-funk that made them famous in the CBGB's/Mud Club days there is definately the urge to keep on \\"slipping into the future\\" as Steve Miller might coin a phrase. To do that interestingly enough the band chose to do that by embracing a musical ethic that would be very significant to their future. The concept of African style musical communalism and polyrhythms were beginning to effect Eno and the band heavily and on \\"I Zimbra\\" you get three minutes of...well just that. It is one of the Heads' few instrumentals and a signiture song in their developement;I cannot tell you how many funk and Afro-Beat DJ's have either had that song spinning at some party of radio show or another.After that we have...well a series of heavy songs with light titles hahaha.\\"Mind\\",in the vein of Peter & The Wolf is a deceptively bright sounding funky rocker that is actually very creepy and,since the song is actually about how the mind deceives itself that totally makes sense.\\"Paper\\" is a pretty drab song for the Heads',not bad but not great.\\"Cities\\" takes the groove of the opening cut,not to mention some of the edgy intensity of [[ASIN:B000C3H4LS More Songs About Buildings and Food]]. On \\"Life During Wartime\\",the closest thing to a straight dance tune the band ever put out also has a pretty assertive lyric about the future;you just know hearing this this \\"ain't no disco,no CBGB's,no Mud Club!\\".Honestly the tune \\"Heaven\\" with it huge sound shows the strong influence of David Bowie's recent work with Eno on the title track of Bowie's [[ASIN:B00001OH7V Heroes]] album.Other tunes such as \\"Memories Can't Wait\\",\\"Electric Guitar\\" and the almost musically invisable drum-on-vocal tune \\"Drugs\\" really owe a lot more to the genre of agit pop then anything as aggressively funky as what might've come before it.Of the bonus cuts presented here \\"Dancing For Money\\" with it's really oddball vocals and strong rhythm is another great funker while what you get on the alternate versions of \\"Life During Wartime\\",\\"Cities\\" and \\"Mind\\" the main difference is the intro's aren't quite as long and the vocal arrangements are more...conventional. The Talking Heads' closed out the 70's and their first era of recording output with this album.But at least for them it seemed to be just as easy,at least in a metaphorical musical sense,to close a door as it was to open a window.deceptively bright sounding funky rocker that is actually very creepy and,since the song is actually about how the mind deceives itself that totally makes sense.\\"Paper\\" is a pretty drab song for the Heads',not bad but not great.\\"Cities\\" takes the groove of the opening cut,not to mention some of the edgy intensity of [[ASIN:B000C3H4LS More Songs About Buildings and Food]].

B00000IMTF|5.0|As far as I'm concerned, this is the best studio album that Rainbow ever made.  It featured the second, classic Rainbow lineup with guitar hero, Ritchie Blackmore, super-talented singer/songwriter Ronnie James Dio, drummer Cozy Powell, bassist Jimmy Bain, and keyboardist Tony Carey.  While the following \\"Long Live Rock 'n' Roll\\" album with Blackmore, Dio, Powell, Daisley, and Stone was also very good, I think this album is better.    What really makes it an outstanding album is the pair of related songs, \\"Stargazer\\" and \\"A Light in the Black\\" each of which clocks in at over 8 minutes, even in these studio versions.  They're related because the narrator in the second song is clearly one of the freed slaves who helped build the tower for the stargazer in the first song.  Taken together, these two songs form one of the great epics of 1970s progressive rock.  In my book, they rank up there with Rush's 2112 and Hemispheres.  While the other songs on this album are also good, it is these two songs that really make this album special.    This is the album when Rainbow rose to greatness.  And they knew it.  It also has a beautiful and distinctive painting on the cover, one of my favorites from any rock album.
0307454894|1.0|The voice of this book, even in translation, is so compelling that it can almost blind you to the fact that the book, despite the kudos, is psychologically bogus to a repellent degree. Quite simply, despite all the window dressing about the joys of literature and reading, it posits that a guard at Auschwitz didn't know about the Holocaust and that she was more ashamed of being illiterate than of being a murderer.  Having studied the Holocaust for over thirty years, taught Holocaust film and literature, written about the effects of the Holocaust on the \\"Second Generation,\\" most recently in a memoir [[ASIN:029923150X My Germany: A Jewish Writer Returns to the World His Parents Escaped]], and even co-authored books about shame itself, I found this central conceit of the book unbelievable.  Unfortunately, it seduced even Oprah, but then she has a history of being taken in by fakes.
B00000IMTE|3.0|This was Rainbow's first album and featured a version of the band which essentially was Ronnie James Dio's Elf with Deep Purple guitar god, Ritchie Blackmore, replacing Elf's guitarist.  While there are some good songs on the album, better versions of those can be heard on live albums from the second Rainbow lineup which replaced the Elf instrumentalists with hard rockers Cozy Powell, Jimmy Bain, and Tony Carey.  In particular, you can hear \\"Man on the Silver Mountain\\", \\"Catch the Rainbow\\", \\"Sixteenth Century Greensleeves\\", and \\"Still I'm Sad\\" in terrific extended versions on \\"On Stage\\", \\"Live in Europe\\", or other live albums from Rainbow's 1976 tour.  They're much better than the short versions on this album.    While I owned this record on vinyl as a kid in the 70s, I feel no urge to get it on CD, especially after listening to the samples of the songs I don't have on live albums here on Amazon.  I didn't even recognize any of the songs, which suggests that they were pretty forgettable.  Unfortunately, this was a faint Rainbow before they really rose and shined with their full brightness.  It's an album you can live without.
B001PDGGWW|5.0|Recommend this as a must read, or in my case listening too the CD, as it takes you from the beginnings of money to present time and provides a clear understanding of how we get into these messes (global financial meltdowns).  This reads like a college text and at time can be slow, but the understanding you gain is worth the effort.  I spent 2 week listing to the CD on my 1 hour drive to/from work each day.  After a bit of listening you will find the author/reader has a dry sense of humor that comes through leaving you laughing at the efforts of folks to make and control money.

B001U0HBQ0|4.0|The curious thing about THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON is that no one seems to think Benjamin's case is that ...well ...curious. But I'm jumping ahead of myself.<br /><br />This film is really all Brad Pitt ([[ASIN:B001JIE7JM Burn After Reading]]). He so controls the entirety of it that you simply could not picture anyone else doing that role but him. Pitt is, after all, a fine actor. Probably one of our finest out there at present. Things like [[ASIN:B000MCH5TK Babel]], [[ASIN:B000W1V7K4 Ocean's Thirteen]] and [[ASIN:B000067J1H Fight Club]] have helped elevate his cinematic chops. But never before has so much attention and time been given over to a character that is purely Pitt's. He is on-screen for most of the film's substantial 166 minutes. And he is fantastic to watch.<br /><br />The curiousness of it is that Benjamin Button (Pitt) is born old. Really old. Arthritic, full of heart disease and wrinkles, Benjamin's early life is wrought with problems. His mother (Joeanna Sayler) dies giving birth to him and his father (Jason Flemyng) is so distraught and disgusted by Benjamin's appearance that he leaves him on a vacant porch-step. He is taken into a house of elderly people where they are cared for in their waning years. And as Benjamin's time passes, his body mutates into a younger and younger man. He finds himself in adventures on the high-seas, and travels the world. But one thing he never seems to forget is his early love of Daisy (Cate Blanchett, [[ASIN:B0013D8L7C I'm Not There]]). Their on-and-off relationship is the only thing that keeps Benjamin semi-grounded in reality. His life is odd, but not so much for him. Although aging is a natural process, Benjamin just happens to be doing it backward. The big question for everyone is \\"What happens when Benjamin's time runs out?\\" Will he vanish into a zygote?<br /><br />It is most disturbing (to me as viewer) that no one in the medical community decided to study Benjamin. They just completely accepted the fact that he was aging in reverse and that was that. No news media hype that Benjamin needed to run away from. No pokes and prods by the medical establishment. Nothing. I understand that time was of the essence when telling this story, and that it needed to be more human interest than anything, but I would've liked to have seen SOMETHING or someone curious enough to think this oddity worth studying.<br /><br />Regardless, this film is quite good thanks to Brad Pitt's amazing performance and the incredible make-up effects (Greg Cannom won the Oscar for Best Make-Up and rightfully so). It is also great eye-candy to see the period sets and costumes through the ages as Pitt and the rest of the cast age into the more modern world.reverse and that was that.

055358894X|5.0|The only bad thing about a really engrossing book is that it can get to the point where it's almost impossible to put down, even at night.  This was one of those books that kept me up reading much much later than I should have been awake.  I know this book seems to have gotten some less-than-favorable reviews, but I guess it depends on what you're looking for when you get this book.  I got it on a whim at the bookstore, and wasn't really sure what to expect-- and an epic fantasy it's not, but that doesn't make it any less fun to read, or filled with its own intricate details of the city and the people in it.  There were parts that had me bursting out laughing, or had me seething, and plenty of tense moments that made it that much harder to put it down.    It's a FUN read, and well done, and sometimes that's exactly the kind of book I want to read.

0199267170|3.0|Though I admire the aims of The Oxford Shakespeare's editors and enjoy their text thoroughly, I am sorely disappointed by the binding on the present edition. It is not thoroughly sewn, but rather glued. Leaving the book open for extended periods of time (as in reading) results in splitting. The cover is unusually light and generally flimsy, succumbing easily to nicks and dents. For newcomers to Shakespeare, it is wholly impractical, as the glossary of archaic words is so insufficient it would best be left out completely. For general reading, go with Norton or Riverside. For individual editions, the Signet editions are probably penultimate to Folger library, the latter being notable for detailed summaries, notes, and supplimentary materials.
B001PPLIEG|3.0|I'm sorry, but Daniel Craig just isn't James Bond. He's too serious, unfunny and too rugged looking. Pierce Brosnan picked up where Roger Moore left off, delivering those quick one liners with cool, dry humor, personality and smooth style (Timothy Dalton was also a dud, IMO).    This movie has a good enough story to be a deserved part of the James Bond legacy, but it doesn't have the balance of action and humor that the old Bond movies of yore had. Too serious, not enough fun--blah.  Three stars since it fires on all action cylinders, but it could have been better.    Another thing...M sends down a young, hot looking woman to drag Bond back to England. Hello! Like James Bond isn't going to manipulate her in his favor any less than any other hot chick?? That was a dumb part of the story. Now if M had sent Jaws down there to collect Bond, he might have been more submitting!
B001ACH4DS|5.0|and then some.  While I didn't go right out and buy the cd.  I always had plans to purchase it.  I should've bought it earlier as I've been missing out on what others already know and love.  His self-titled album is well versed, written and produced in all aspects.  I can't say with all honesty which is my favorite as they all hold a certain place depending on what time of day it is.<br /><br />The songs are true to him and for the most part written by David about things that happened or are happening in his life.  Some very personal and just want to wish him and his family well as they deal with ongoing issues in their lives.  He makes the transition from AI to his own music with relative ease.<br /><br />If you were wondering about any of that.  No worries as David Cook puts out a cd that will have and keep your interest for some time.  Much love and more success to follow.  I'm sure that's in his forecast for some time to come.  Excellent effort all around.

While I figured Katniss would win, I did not want her to have to struggle with the grief that comes from taking a human life.  I felt for her and what must have been an overwhelming sense of fear as she trekked through the woods being hunted or hunting.

This is what I finally did after about 30 minutes of this gorgeous mess. my interest perked up when Hugh Jackman went shirtless and I thought: \\"Mmmmm, this might work.\\" But Nicole Kidman was so god-awful irritating as the stereotypical \\"proper\\" artistocratic woman who is forced to endure the wilds of Australia? Haven't we seen this a zillion times before, specifically \\"King Solomon\\"s Mines\\"? Especially, when her guide turns out to be a reject from a Clint Eastwood sphagetti western of the 70s? I completely lost interest with the introduction of the little \\"magic\\" boy--or was it a girl? When he went into his exaggerated hand signs, to drive away evil or become invisible, the movie moved down another notch of absurdity. After the big cattle scene--where a million computerized cattle are racing to the edge of the cliff and the magic boy stops them through his psychic abilities, I had enough. And there were actual comparisons to \\"Gone With the Wind\\"! Believe me, David O. Selznick has nothing to worry about.

I sure had a good time watching them either alone or with the entire family. The Goonies  I particularly remember very well for the underground adventures, and the characters Chunk & Sloth. They make a great duo, don't they? The booby traps and the \\"keys\\" to the hidden treasure were a bit frightening back then, but now they're pretty imaginative. This, along with the other family films that I've mentioned above never gets tedious. Of course, they don't! We loved them when we were kids, and it's not such a bad thing when you're looking for some childhood nostalgia. Although I slightly prefer Milo & Otis and others, The Goonies is still a great one.
B0001I561E|3.0|I had forgotten how nice it was to watch a movie with a youngster.  In watching this DVD over the week-end with my grandson and watching his pleasure I remembered watching the VHS Tape with his mother years ago.  Movies like this will never go out of style.
B00005JM1F|2.0|I was hoping that I would enjoy watching Old School, since it had Will Ferrell and Vince Vaughn. It failed to make me laugh. I know lots of other people admire this film, but I didn't find it very funny. Sure, the plot worked and the characters were actually convincing, but I found the jokes to be very weak in many parts. Oh well, next time when I watch this comedy again, maybe then I'll find it extremely hilarious.

B001YV504U|5.0|It was 1991, three years after the movie's release, it was a saturday afternoon and I was at a friend's house and she suggested we watch \\"Field of Dreams\\", I said \\"what's it about?\\" she said \\"it's a baseball movie!\\", I perked up, I said Okay, I said \\"who's in it?\\", she says \\"Kevin Costner\\". I kind of rolled my eyes because I wasn't too keen on Kevin Costner but I said okay, lets do it, so she advised me to shut up while the opening credits rolled because it gave some background about the life of the characters so I did just that and for the rest of the entire movie, I was hooked, not only with the movie itself but the music.<br /><br />Please note though, that, while being catholic, I am not a very religious minded person and my thoughts about the spiritual aspects of this movie I will leave out of this review.<br /><br />The Theme of the movie itself is what sold me on it, the relationship that the Costner Character, Ray Kinsella, had with his father in the movie, now, I, myself, had a great relationship with my father and all during the movie, I was rooting for Ray to somehow reconnect with his father again and by the end of this picture, without giving it away, I was a mess, This movie, in one viewing, made it's way into my top ten all time favorite movies.<br /><br />Not only that but I immediately upon leaving my friends house, went to the store and purchased the video AND the soundtrack and it was one of the first DVD's I purchased after I got my first DVD player.<br /><br />I read other reviews here that panned the movie for lousy acting and terrible story lines but I think this was a wonderful movie and I agree with one reviewer that this is \\"It's a wonderful life\\" on a baseball diamond, which so happens to be another favorite of mine.  In closing,. sometimes you just have to remember that you have to use your imagination and stop trying to think that all movies are real life, sometimes you just have to go beyond that and you will find yourself entertained like I was BUT this movie went beyond entertainment, this movie was AWESOME and I recommend it to anyone who can think beyond reality.<br /><br />I intend to update this movie to blu-ray as soon as possible and even if you don't have a blu-ray player, YOU NEED THIS MOVIE IN YOUR COLLECTION!ike I was BUT this movie went beyond entertainment, this movie was AWESOME and I recommend it to anyone who can think beyond reality.<br /><br />I intend to update this movie to blu-ray as soon as possible and even if you don't have a blu-ray player, YOU NEED THIS MOVIE IN YOUR COLLECTION!
0553579908|5.0|I have been a fantasy fan since diaper age, when my Dad read me The Hobbit on his knee. Throughout my youth I gobbled up everything fantasy, from Lloyd Alexander to Dungeons and Dragons to The Chronicles of Narnia.<br /><br />But somewhere along the way I realized that I was reading the same story over and over and over again, and it seemed to me that I learned everything any fantasy author had to say by the end of the LOTR. There seemed nothing new under the sun, everything just a regurgitation of Tolkien.<br /><br />I did find Robert Howard eventually, and Fritz Leiber, but there just wasn't enough of it to keep my addiction to fantasy satisfied.<br />The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant seemed very promising for the first three books, but the silly names and repeated, unresolved problems got old after the first three books.<br />I tried Terry Brooks and was disgusted with the thinly disqguised Tolkien plagiarism, and wondered why it was considered better lit than the equally dorky and sophomoric Dragonlance series.<br />Terry Goodkind was good, but just not good enough to keep my interest past one doorstopper. Besides, I'd already read The Fountainhead.<br />Robert Jordan was good for a book or two, but a little too superhero-like and, though cleverly admitted to within the pages, also much too dependent on Tolkien.<br /><br />I just couldn't see why these authors were making triple trilogies when the writing and ideas weren't even as good as Tolkien, and three were good enough for him. Why drag out mediocrity for so long unless it's to milk a cash cow?<br />What was wrong with the old short story, and the single novel?<br />I realized that this was mostly the Publishing houses fault, after researching it a bit, but still found it disturbing.<br /><br />Oh yeah- I tried Eragon too, and found it decently written. Though formulaic and Star Wars/Tolkien derived, it was no more so than some of the others I've already mentioned, despite the bad rep Paolini gets. Still, my interest did not continue to the second novel.<br /><br />Finally, I found GRRM. I resisted it for a while because the books were of ridiculous length and at 5 books he still hadn't finished them. But I decided that since I'd read the first books of Jordan, Brooks, and Goodkind I could at least dip my nose in for a single episode to see what it was all about....just so I could at least say \\"I tried.\\"<br /><br />I was completely surprised.<br />I have not enjoyed a fantasy author so much since Tolkien, and furthermore I have finally found a series that does not copy him, Howard, or Leiber in the least. These books are amazing in that they may have saved the entire fantasy genre from the (mostly deserved) reputation of being the same story told over and over a thousand times.<br /><br />The books are not only fantasy, but also mystery and alternative history, with not a fantasy cliche' in sight. This is uncomparably refreshing in the stale genre.<br /><br />I set out to read the first book in order to disregard it like the others, with the full expectation that my interest would not last into the second novel. How wrong I was.<br /><br />I am nearly finished with the third book only a few weeks after starting the series, and though I hate to admit it, I have actually been late for work from staying up too late reading Mr. Martin.<br /><br />I would warn others that though some of the heroes are children, this IS NOT a teen book and often is extremely graphic. I would also warn the fairy lovers that this is not a \\"high magic\\" society and that most of the action takes place between realistic people who have no \\"special powers.\\"<br /><br />Styill, this is the best series in the genre to have been written in at least two decades, and without it you have no grasp on the current state of fantasy, and where it will be going next......lly, I found GRRM.

0810979772|5.0|My 7-year-old son asked for this book; I bought it for him this afternoon; and he spent the next (literally) six hours absorbed in it until I kicked him up to bed. If you have a bright son who loves to draw, write and express himself, this book is for him. Girls love to write about themselves; boys sometimes have trouble, and this book gives them a kick-start by providing templates for written and artistic expression.
B001GQACGE|4.0|I like all the songs on the cd except one.  The only thing I do not like is that they made two cds instead of just putting all the songs on one cd.  Each cd has around six songs a piece.  It would of made it much easier for the listener to have all the songs on one cd.
B001TH16DS|4.0|I found nothing to complain about. the episodes are good, the choice of old or new effects is awesome, and the sound booms. The extras aren't great, but when have the extras ever been the best part of a DVD or Blu-Ray set.  The only thing I would have included, had it been up to me, is the old blooper reel that never seems to be published at all. It's out there, I know, my brother even has it on an old super 8 reel.    Also, the case wasn't even broken when it arrived! A first for me when ordering multi-disc sets from Amazon.
B000RJO578|5.0|This is definitely the funniest comedy of 2007. Simon Pegg, Edgar Wright, and Nick Frost make a great trio. With their knowledge of action movies deemed both good and bad, they make a motion picture that's filled with high-octane action, impressive suspense, magnificent slapstick humor, and tons of blood and guts. It may be a bit too long for some (two hours can be too much for a comedy), but I didn't find any tedium anywhere in the film. Mostly it's because I was too immersed in the characters and the comedy. Speaking of characters, Nicholas Angel (Pegg) and Danny Butterman (Frost) has to be one of the most popular duos of this generation. Like in Shaun of the Dead, they sure know how to be loved by those who're into action, suspense, and comedy. Timothy Dalton, along with the rest of the supporting comedic ensemble, makes this even more memorable. And David Arnold's score really something worth mentioning: the synthesizers along with the orchestra is a perfect combination for this sort of movie.<br /><br />If you love Shaun of the Dead and the Spaced TV series, then you'll probably get a kick out of Hot Fuzz if you're into mindless action and smart comedy.
006135323X|2.0|It's tempting to think while reading this book: ivy league students are the subjects of his studies, of course the results are irrational!<br /><br />This book has positive points -- it is great for anyone who loves behavioral economics or hasn't been introduced to it yet, because it discusses why we take the decisions we do.  The author also seems to have some larger purpose in writing it, which is not true of similar books like Freakonomics.<br /><br />Otherwise the criticisms are right -- the author has succumbed (with the help of a mutual co-writer) to the same self-congratulation of Freakonomics, and he's apparently in an academic bubble.  His logic and experiments are often incomplete or ill-formed.  Some decisions he considers irrational just have different calculations underlying them.  And he tells of how we love our own ideas too much, then proposes a rather naive idea for a credit card industry fix, as if to prove the point.<br /><br />Mostly we enjoy the playful presentation, and it's fun to read along because you feel like you are discovering the secrets of the human mind, even if the ideas are not new.  The author makes good points here or there about the needs for honesty and self-discipline.  But while the book's crafted for everyone to be dazzled, its flaws are too many to ignore.
B000JO9Y6I|5.0|Given the subject matter of the show it will tend to be polarizing for those that can enjoy it and those that can't. It is dark but it is also strangely funny and all in all a very good show. My favorite show in a long time, but it isn't for everyone. You can look on the series subject matter before ever watching a show and decide if it is something you think you could stand watching. If so then give a few shows a shot from season one, more than likely you will know if you want to keep watching all the seasons within the first 3-4 shows.     In my opinion the show is well worth paying for, the way many episodes end I am not sure I would be able to last watching it like a normal season on Showtime having to wait a week to see what comes next. With so many shows that I used to enjoy becoming boring and uninspired (I'm looking at you House) this show continues to offer me something each season being better than the last.

B0000E64TR|5.0|Goodbye Yellow Brick Road (30th Anniversary Deluxe Edition)  being Elton John's 7th studio album and his 1973 release is considered by many his magnum opus and I agree with them. This is for Elton John what Autobahn is for Kraftwerk. The album received great reviews and I totally concur with them on this assessment. The album itself did exceedingly well and peaked the Billboard 200 at #1 and also reached #1 in Australia and The UK. Singles released on this album \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\", \\"Saturdays Night's Alright for Fighting\\", \\"Bennie and the Jets\\" and \\"Candle in the Wind\\". We also get some bonus tracks plus a CD with the making of the CD. The booklet is quite extensive with all the lyrics and a list of whom plays what for each track. 5/5.

156224003X|4.0|The key to this book is at the bottom of Page 170 \\"(...)You can't practice everything at this level - there just isn't enough time. Many things come up in your career that require you to practice as quickly as possible and hope for the best. You cannot - repeat - CANNOT consciously force this focus in your playing or practicing(...)\\"<br /><br />I believe the technique explained in this book could work if used in addition to more traditional ways. Never as the only way of learning things.<br /><br />The other part I have problems with is the fact that he states we must keep practicing the same thing until we master it completely. The trick is there is always room for improvement. You can always play something better, faster or in a more interesting way. When should we draw the line?<br /><br />Good book nonetheless. Definitely recommend.
B001MW0IY8|5.0|Antony Hegarty probably has the most honestly expressive voice I've ever heard. It is pure beauty. It just is. As usual, it is the main showcased aspect of this album, but that is what makes it so great. The way he pronounces some words is so eccentric and refreshing. He is accompanied by strings and piano most of the time, and sometimes also by beautiful winds. It is a very emotionally intense album.    Basically, I've found that the best way to listen to this music is outside on a nice, breezy day, while smiling with your eyes closed. If you really focus on it, you will probably cry. In a good way.
0307269752|4.0|Mr. Larsson spends almost a quarter of this book setting up the murder mystery.  That amount of background is appropriate because this is far more than just a murder mystery.  There is a financial mystery to unravel as well.  As one gets to know tha main character, Mikael, it is inevitable that both mysteries would occupy him.  He has been professionally shattered as a journalist after writing an unsubstantiated story about a crooked financier (resulting in jail time).  He is then hired by a wealthy industrialist to solve a decades old mystery the industrialist believes to be a murder.<br /><br />At the outset there is also a parallel bio of Lisbeth, the girl with the dragon tatoo.  She has some major mental problems and is under guardianship, but we also see early on that there is some sort of genius within.  Watching her progress and overcome some of her demons is worth the price of the book alone.<br /><br />Eventually Mikael and Lisbeth join forces.  Both mysteries are terrific (particularly the murder) and, by the end keep the pages turning.<br /><br />Both characters are very engaging, particularly Lisbeth, whose off-the-wall characteristics contrast well with Mikael's starightforward economic journalist tendencies.<br /><br />I gave this only four stars because although all the background was necessary, it took a while for the book to really take off.  Once it did, it was terrifically engaging.  I look forward to the next installments of the trilogy.  These characters, especially Lisbeth, are well worh following.

B0015AARJI|5.0|[[ASIN:B0015AARJI PlayStation 3 Dualshock 3 Wireless Controller]]    This is a very good controller, similar to the one that comes with the Playstation 3.    The wireless range is awesome and the battery seems to be almost infinite! Very good quality.    The only thing I should comment is that there is no USB Cable included, so you must charge one controller at a time or buy a cable.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I am an intermediate to advanced exerciser; when I read the reviews that this DVD kicks b____, I was skeptical.  However, I was so disappointed with the latest Jari Love DVD, that I decided to try something different.   I would not say that level 1 is easy but at the level I am used to, it was not enough for a full workout so I decided to combine levels 1 and 2.  By the time I was finished with level 2, there was NO WAY I could go on to level 3.  This was a great workout. Jillian has a good steady voice and focuses on form.  She provides enough inspiration without sounding like a cheerleader.  I am eager to combine a 30 minute run/walk interval with either level 1 or 2, and at some point achieve Level 3. This a definite interval workout.  There are 3 circuits in each level.  3 minutes of strength, 2 minutes of cardio, and 1 minute of abs,  and then two more times--but, each circuit is different and each level is different.  The strength was challenging (although level 3 looks very difficult) but not as focused on weight training as Jari and I increased my weights accordingly. (There is no tricep work--mainly shoulder, bicep, chest and lower body.) By the end of level 2 cardio sessions,however, I welcomed the strength training.  I am excited to work this into my regular workout session. After it was over, I felt a great sense of accomplishment.

0634049011|5.0|I am so called advanced guitar player. I learned playing guitar by myself and it was very long time ago. I went through rock bands, blues bands, wedding party bands and even jazz big band. But it was playing from memory or emotional. I have put my guitars on shelf for long time(too long) and couple of years ago I made myself the biggest pleasure and started music yourney again. But now my unknowledge started bother me. So I took few theory music lessons with educated musician. One then I quit, then another one... more and more expensive ones. All it was a mess - info here and there but not put logicly together. And I was lucky I found \\"Chord -tone soloing\\" and \\"Fretboard workbook\\" by  Barret Tagliarino. Both absolute masterpieces. Logical, simple and easy to follow. And you realy see progress. I am sure I will be able to call myself advadced guitar player next year. How nice is play and understand, and the music is different - better. Thank you Barret for your educational skills.
B001FB4W0W|4.0|I am a HUGE fan of the Sookie Stackhouse books. What is funny though, is that I did not start reading them until I had heard of this show. I fell in love with the books from the first one I read, so it was good I bought the boxed set of the books. I was done with all 6 of those books in a week!!!<br /><br />I have patiently waited for the series to come to DVD, as I do not have HBO and had not seen a single episode. It was interesting to see the books come to life, and in many ways they were true to the books. In oher ways, the show went in tangents that were boring, uninteresting, and just downright weird. The whole Tara story line is just out of left field. Perhaps the writers were trying to give the readers of the book something to be surprised by? It was unnecessary for me. I was not keen on Paquin for the role of Sookie, but she grew on me as I watched the show.<br /><br />In the end, I WILL watch season 2 (am subscribing to HBO right before it starts), and my husband, sister, mom, and cousin will be watching as well (all people who have watched my season 1 DVDs).

B000002J6H|5.0|In the six years from 1966 through 1972, Stephen Stills released no less than six essential albums, plus three more at least pleasant ones, plus a very good live album, plus compilations, etc. Stills first solo album ranks near the lower end of the six essential albums, the essential albums being: 1.Manassas (1972), 2. Crosby, Stills & Nash (1969), 3. Deja Vu (1970), 4. Buffalo Springfield Again (1967), 5. Stephen Stills (1970), and 6. Super Sessions (1968). Buffalo Springfield's debut album (1966) is nearly essential, while Stephen Stills 2 (1971) and Last Time Around (1968) have some fine moments. While it is true that Stills works with one or more major collaborator on each of these albums, Stills is the primary songwriter, primary musician, and bandleader on each of them (except Super Sessions).     Stills first solo album has always been his best strictly solo work, and ranks only behind Manassas in terms of displaying his personal songwriting and superb guitar playing. \\"Love the One You're With\\" is, of course, a terrific, classic hit CSN song, and \\"Sit Yourself Down\\" is also a very enjoyable hit. Stills organ playing on \\"Old Times Good Times\\" challenges Jimi Hendrix' awesome guitar playing on the same song, while Stills lead guitar on \\"Go Back Home\\" compares favorably to Eric Clapton's. \\"Do for the Others\\", \\"Church\\", and \\"Black Queen\\" are superbly folky, soulfull, and bluesy. \\"We Are Not Helpless\\" is a majestic, if slightly excessive, retort to Neil Young.     Stephen Stills has definitely been a more accomplished songwriter than Crosby or Nash, definitely a more accomplished musician than Crosby, Nash, or Young, and definitely a more accomplished singer than Young. Personnally, I prefer Stills songwriting to Young's, but Young is certainly among the best ever songwriters (and a very interesting guitarist).    I am amazed that Stills doesn't get more credit than he does. The Rolling Stones, \\"The World's Greatest Rock and Roll Band\\", released four great albums,plus a sloppy fun live album, between 1968 and 1972, for which the Stones received tremendous critical praise. And indeed, this period was easily the Stones' best period. But, as far as I'm concerned, Stills' seven albums, plus Four Way Street (live), during the same time period, are more impressive.
B0008GNJZY|5.0|Coach Carter is an inspiring movie that teaches young African Americans to respect themselves, rise above stereotypes and invest in their own education to secure a better future.  Directed by Thomas Carter, Coach Carter is based on the true story of Ken Carter, played by Samuel Jackson, who takes the job as the basketball coach of the high school team in Richmond, CA. Carter is determined to change the lives of his players, to make them champions both in school and on court. He transforms a team that only won four games in an entire season to an undefeated team.  As the team climbs on its winning streak, Coach Carter finds that some of his players are failing their classes and not following the terms of the academic contract that they signed promising decent grades. As a result, he locks up the gym and cancels practices and games, which stirs enormous opposition from the whole neighborhood.        While the story of Coach Carter is inspiring, the movie exaggerates the fate of young African American men: either go to college or end up in jail.  This dramatization is effective however as it gives the viewer a better understanding of the dangers and temptations of life on the streets of the poverty-stricken and crime-latent neighborhoods of Richmond.  This understanding makes the viewers more sympathetic and appreciative of Coach Carter's unconventional methods and supports his actions (signing academic contracts, locking up the gym, canceling games, etc.), although a bit outrageous.  In a scene where the school board and the parents vote against Carter's lock-out, you can't help but standby Carter's side and hope he achieves his goal.  This scene, however, is dramatized and embellished in the movie as the school board/parents vs. Coach Carter hearing to vote against the lock-out didn't actually occur.  In reality, the principal supported the lock-out and even though Coach Carter received phone calls from parents complaining about his decision, they supported hislock-out after listening to his explanations.  Since the true conflict resolution was amicable, the movie has to fabricate the vote-out scene to create tension and enhance the excitement of the movie.  In addition, this embellishment adds to the credibility of poor the Richmond neighborhood with fairly uneducated parents who do not appreciate the value of education.     Another discrepancy between the movie and Ken Carter's story is the academic contract.  The movie depicts players reluctantly signing Coach Carter's contract, promising a 2.3 GPA, decent class attendance and participation, and proper conduct.  Some players are irked by this stringent set of rules and tension rises between the coach and the players.  However, in truth, Coach Carter actually worked with his players to draft the contract together.  They wanted to be pushed beyond the average 2.0 GPA required of athletes to compete in California schools and decided to set the bar higher.   If this truth was told, the movie would be boring; hence, it was altered to create the rising tension and conflict and enhanced the movie's appeal.           On the first day of practice, Coach Carter says, \\"Sir is a term of respect, and you will have my respect until you abuse it,\\" as he attempts to teach the group of players with poor attitudes mutual respect.  This becomes the strong foundation that builds up the team and is pivotal to the transformation of the players' characters and their outlook on life.  Samuel Jackson's versatility as an actor is visible as he shifts from demanding coach, compassionate teacher, angry parent, and disappointing member of community--all delivered and made real by his authoritative tone of voice, body language and expressions.  Jackson's presence--like a drill sergeant commanding respect as he unites his team--carries the movie and gives it an edge, differentiating it from a typical feel-good Disney movie.   The role of Coach Carter is one of Jackson's strongest performances.  Thecasting of the players gives an eclectic mix of characters--funny, cool, troubled, serious, scholastic--each likable in his own way, making the movie experience more enjoyable for the viewer.  To top it off, the soundtrack is upbeat and exciting to add to the overall basketball theme of the movie. This movie is definitely worth the DVD price, and more.

0307266303|5.0|From the first chapter I found myself laughing out loud as I read and soaking in little bits of information.  Although this book doesn't set out to be a \\"running manual\\" each of the chapters builds to what I believe is an extremely valuable and entertaining account of Chris's experiences.     I can't put into words how much I have appreciated this read, I have just put it down and I'm ready to devour the book again, it's just that good.     As someone who has tried unsuccessfully to go from couch to marathon in 10 months, I picked up this book believing what I had been told, \\"Our family doesn't make good runners\\". After hearing Chris on NPR I was very intrigued to hear his side of the story, which had people well into their 60s and 70s running ultras in pretty much just bare feet.

B001KZIRL8|4.0|Obviously this movie has hit a nerve with a large volume people, and whether you hate or love it the Blu managed to make for a nice product.<br /><br />The 129 minutes does seem long, but the variety of color tests and hidef clarity showcasing this awesome cast makes for a watchable Blu. The colors, depth and scenery variety make for an adequate representation, including the sailing, the dark indoors, room decors, and Scarlett. The sound is uneventful but you do have the choice between TrueHD or normal 5.1. And if even just to hear Kristofferson's voice say anything in TrueHD, albeit only two scenes.<br /><br />The special features are definitely...unique. If you liked the premise of that invisible wall being removed during the film - the \\"interviews\\" of the random people on the street - then you you will dig the main feature here.<br /><br />* A \\"newspaper\\" format of the six couples/storylines that when selected, allows you to delve deeper into the characters' lives. Actually, brief excerpts can be seen during the credit sequence. Each one totals three minutes and admittedly, it peaked every single customer's interest when they saw it, because it seems real. Several people thought they were watching Hollywood couples being interviewed about their relationships. Bradley Cooper's \\"interview\\" gathered the biggest crowd, but irritated most of the guys watching.<br /><br />* If one ever has interest into how much a phone conversation scene in a movie can be micromanaged, look no further. This four minute feature has the director dissect in detail how they made one of the phone call scenes have relevance that even the trained eye might miss. If anything, several people now wanted to watch the film again to see what the heck he was talking about.<br /><br />* The inspiration and history of the film are covered in an eleven minute documentary, catered to the die hard fans.<br /><br />* The deleted scenes total 13:45 and would have been much better left in - especially since we had already endured two+ hours of this. The commentary gives no credibility as to why Scarlet's actual singing was removed from the film. Coupled with Teresa Russel's entire role being cut, it just showcased the weakness in the writing people complain about in this film.<br /><br />Big fans of the film will want this as a purchase, but since 90% of my Blu customers are guys, I foresee this as mostly a rental.e commentary gives no credibility as to why Scarlet's actual singing was removed from the film.

0385340575|5.0|The action starts out at a high pitch: Reacher's on the NY subway and sees a woman exhibiting all the signs of a suicide bomber. Being Reacher, he intervenes. Uncharacteristically his intervention leads to unfortunate consequences for the woman.<br /><br />There follows a lot of action with secretive agents, assorted law enforcers, foreign fundamentalists, and denizens of DC helping or hindering Reacher as he tries to unravel the mysterious actions of the subway woman.<br /><br />The information everyone is seeking seems plausible enough to carry the action of the plot.<br /><br />Gone Tomorrow has plenty of what this Lee Child fan loves: the fearlessness of Jack Reacher; the savvy that lets him navigate the world of bad people; and the detailed, almost choreographed, scenes of mayhem.<br /><br />In this book there's less of a sense of just how much of an outsider and a drifter Reacher is. And as the pages flew by I worried that he wasn't going to get what has become his one obligatory bedding-of-the-girl per book. (Mr. Child came through!)<br /><br />People who know New York City might especially enjoy the action as it flows around the city because of how specific the descriptions are of streets, locations of hotels and neighborhoods, subways, etc.<br /><br />I try to slow read through a Jack Reacher book so as to prolong the pleasure. Impossible to do with Gone Tomorrow. Too enjoyable to stop.
B001DZ9GRE|3.0|I was excited to purchase this since Sony BMG in our country just released the CD. No DVD at all! So better get it here on an even upgraded deluxe version with another bonus disc. What's best is that the 2 new songs are already in a form of video in the DVD. However reading some of those reviews here they were right when there is no continuous play for the videos. Also absent is the video for \\"Love Song for a Vampire\\" which is present on the CD/DVD combo only. And to make things worse, all the videos except Pattern Of My Life and Shining Light were all in Mono. Can't believe this. Some of the video quality is crap. Sound isn't even mixed in 5.1.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|Simply spectacular version. After so much cutting and adding throughout the history of this fine film, finally we have the original cut from one of the best director today. Blu-ray is the format for this film and that is it.<br />I'm glad Ridley Scott was dedicated to the core value of this film and did not disappoint the fans around the world.<br />This epic proportion of Philip K. Dick book came to life as no other film in that genus. This is the film to watch over and over again; as it takes you deeper into what it is Blade Runner. Simply watch and enjoy, as you mind will let you translate and interpret their vision of human spirit.
B000002KIK|5.0|i love this album as well as sabbath bloody sabbath, sabatoge and technical ecstacy, i can only imagine what great lengths this band would have accomplished if it had kept going in this direction, i am fed up with all the bands trying to keep up with each other and see how much they can sound like each other instead of experimenting with the music as sabbath did with never say die, will there ever be anything like what came from this time in music? i certainly hope so, but i wont hold my breath.
1439138311|5.0|As the daughter of an Irish immigrant, I picked up this book hoping for another perspective on the immigrant experience, a hope that was more than met by this extraordinary novel.  As Eilis' story unfolds, the reader is able to see her grow and change as she learns some of the lessons that Brooklyn has to teach.  I was delighted that the borough itself was so obviously a character in the story, exerting its own personality and influence both on Eilis and on the reader.<br /><br />I heard Colm Toibin read from the book and talk about the experience of writing it- the starting point was a story he heard in his youth, a snippet of conversation that stuck in his head until this book was written.  He perfectly captures the confusion and homesickness of a young girl uprooted from all she has ever known, and lovingly documents her gradual transformation into womanhood.  This quiet tale will stick with you; though the novel itself was a quick read, the story and Eilis' final choice, linger long after the book is completed.  Definitely a must read!
B001C3KCSY|5.0|I've listened to KOL since their first album, and every release has something different to offer. Only by the Night is probably the best I've heard from these guys - yes, it is a step away from the raw southern punk rock they've turned out in the past, but all of the most important elements that define the band are still there. Like the Chili Peppers, they are developing and refining their sound from raucous beginings into polished melodic rock. I can't wait to see what they come up with next.
1580493866|4.0|\\"Hound of the Baskervilles\\" is a unique story in the Sherlock Holmes canon -- author Arthur Conan Doyle wrote it in the years between Holmes' death and his resurrection several years later.<br /><br />But due to public pressure, Doyle brought Holmes and Watson back temporarily for a sort of \\"memoir\\" tale, a tale of supernatural curses, escaped convicts and ghastly glowing hounds. It suffers a little from a lack of Holmes, but is otherwise a tightly-written, solid little mystery.<br /><br />Sir Charles Baskerville was found dead of a heart attack -- apparently killed by a family curse in the shape of a giant dog. So his pal Dr. Mortimer asks Sherlock Holmes to protect Charles' heir, Henry Baskerville, who has just arrived in England to claim his estate and inheritance.<br /><br />But even without Holmes, Watson can tell that something is up -- secretive servants, peculiar neighbors, an escaped criminal, a giant quicksand marsh, and the sounds of a dog howling in the night. But Holmes knows that the curse is no supernatural hound -- and that Sir Henry is in danger from a more real kind of ancient enemy.<br /><br />\\"Hound of the Baskervilles\\" stumbles in one area -- the relative lack of Holmes. He's out of the picture for most of the book, and Watson does plenty of solid detecting on his own. Everybody loves the faithful narrator, but Watson isn't the Great Detective, and the book feels vaguely incomplete without Holmes inspecting clues and giving little hints to Watson.<br /><br />The mystery unfolds at a languid pace, dropping a few red herrings along the way. Doyle pays loving attention to the dangerous, almost surreal Grimpen Mire and the surrounding countryside. But when Holmes comes back onto the scene, the book tightens itself up. All the plot threads rapidly slip into place as the real \\"hound\\" is uncovered.<br /><br />Holmes' steel-trap mind is untarnished here, especially when he reveals what he figured out at the end. He's especially likable in an endearing scene at the beginning, where he educates Watson on deduction. But this is Watson's turn to shine, since he spends a long time gathering clues and even solving a sub-mystery without any assistance.<br /><br />\\"Hound of the Baskervilles\\" is a short, satisfying Holmesian mystery, which is only hampered by Holmes' absence for about half the book.

0375826726|4.0|Brisingr is a worthy successor to Eragon and Eldest. It improves in many aspects over the first two, and falls short in others, but overall, is a very good book. However, given the choice, I preferred Eldest.  I have a LOT to say about Brisingr, so I'll break it down into pros and cons here:  Pros:  *Increasing good prose and dialogue. *Roran's chapters were very strong. *Some brief insight into the mind of Murtagh, which was extremely well thought out and developed, solidifying Murtagh's position as the best character in the saga. *Fast-paced, despite some rather prolonged scenes with little happening. I couldn't put the book down without reading at least 150 pages every time I opened it. *Arya finally shows some real personality, talking a little about her past and her relationship with Faolin. (Though Eragon's thoughts about this were rather dumb.) *There was a nice twist on the traditional mentor death towards the end. *We finally get some insight into Galbatorix's mindset, hearing a well thought-out speech from him at the end. *Increasing originality. *Some very neat characters here and there, such as Rhunon, Elva, and numerous new dwarves. *Despite the seemingly black-and-white nature of the conflict between the Varden and Empire, shades of gray appear when the characters question their cause.  Cons:  *Too much of the book is focused on Eragon. About 80% of the pages are from his point of view, a disturbing unbalanced situation considering that he is only one of five characters who have their own POV in this book.  *The more I read, the more I dislike Eragon. He's becoming increasingly ruthless, slaughtering anyone in his way, even those only doing their jobs or forced to serve the Empire. He becomes so cold and uncaring you really have to wonder if he should be a villain, not the hero. He tries very hard to justify his actions, spouting nonsense about how the ends will justify the means and that he'd only be evil if he enjoyed killing, philosophy that is repeated through the book. Most of the problems I have with the series stem from Eragon or the overemphasis on him. What makes it worse is that the rebel faction praises him as a hero, inflating his already bloated ego. There were times when I felt like Galbatorix was the lesser evil, here.  *Murtagh is wasted. Despite how powerful and dangerous he is to the Varden, he doesn't wreak nearly as much havoc as he could or should. He is only briefly seen in Brisingr, and is treated more like an environmental hazard that the characters have to avoid rather than a real villain. It's a pity, because Murtagh is easily the best character and the insights into his personality we do see are very complex and three-dimensional.  *The plot is a little weaker in structure than Eldest, with some rather prolonged sessions of dwarf politics and dialogue. At times, the plot feels more like a collection of errands that Eragon has to run rather than a chain of events that leads up to the conclusion.  *Nasuada becomes so power-crazed and tyrannical in this book that I was hoping Elva would just let one of those assassins kill her so Roran or someone could lead the Varden instead.  *The morals are messed up, as previously mentioned. Too much time is spent with the rebels spouting self-justified diatribe on why they are in the right, and why its okay for them to be burning and pillaging on the path to opposing Galbatorix.  Conclusion: Brisingr is a great book, but the series is beginning to get weighed down by some obvious problems stemming from the author's choices. Paolini has talent, but he's misusing those talents by focusing on Eragon as the hero and forgetting Murtagh. He's taking the story in the wrong directions and, I think, making a lot of bad decisions when it comes to what he will do. He's doing what he's doing well, but he isn't so good at deciding what should be done.talent, but he's misusing those talents by focusing on Eragon as the hero and forgetting Murtagh.

0743435753|5.0|The fifth entry in the long running Honor Harrington series by David Weber, Flag in Exile is superb.  Honor's strengths are equivalent to Achilles' without the pouting, and with more intelligence.  The best parts of the books for me, including this one, are the relationships Honor has with her friends, lovers and enemies.  Certain of her speeches are Churchillian in grandeur, expressed so perfectly as to arouse vicarious envy.<br />I might subtract one half star for the battle scenes.  David Weber has gone to great lengths to imagine a future with a plausible interstellar technology.  He has also imagined navies that are similar to the Union and Confederate armies during the Civil War in that they have achieved a relative military balance that heavily favors the offense.  Thus, just as 87,000 American soldiers were killed in 3 days of battle at Gettysburg, tens if not hundreds of thousands of soldiers are killed in each battle that takes place in this series.  I am somewhat miffed that Weber presents these battles without comment.  Is he making an ironic point that no matter how advanced technology becomes, no matter how human beings evolve, they will NEVER figure it out - the total senseless futility of it all?  Or does he somehow find glory in these great battles with their mass casualties?  It is up to the reader to decide.  It is no accident that my favorite book of the series is number 4, \\"Field of Dishonor,\\" probably because it contains the fewest large-scale battles of any of the other books in the series that I have read.
0307266303|4.0|I rarely read novels about running.  I'm usually drawn to technical works on running.  The book \\"Born To Run\\" by Christopher McDougall is an odd combination of both.  Sort of.    Most of the \\"running\\" in the book is most likely not what a typical reader would associate with that term.  This is a book about \\"ultrarunning\\", which by strict definition means any race 50 kilometers or longer.  For users of the Anglo-American system of measure, that's about 31.1 miles.  In this book the races under discussion are either 50 or 100 miles in length.    This is not mainstream stuff.  Standard road racing up to the marathon distance is somewhat known to the typical person-on-the-street thanks to the Olympics.  \\"Ultrarunning ?\\"    Ultrarunning is really obscure stuff !  Apparently the book is moving up on the bestseller list.  I'm a bit shocked by this.  I figure you have to be very much into running for this book to capture your attention.  It is written in a style which is a hybrid of a novel and documentary.  It's my impression that all of the events described are non-fictional.  The author is a good storyteller with some tendency for long-windedness.    The book's focus is on a remote region of Mexico inhabited by a tribe known as the Tarahumara.  This tribe was pushed into this region, the Sierra Madre, and more specifically the region of the \\"Copper Canyon\\".  Copper Canyon is significantly wider and deeper than the Grand Canyon.  But it's most important feature is it's remoteness.  It is here the Tarahumara retreated from advancing Spanish and Mexican settlers.  The canyon area served them as a gigantic natural fortress.    The author seems to have stumbled onto the Tarahumara during his travels to Mexico as a journalist.  He also explains his personal problems with running, and his visits to various sports medicine experts.  He got nowhere with the \\"experts\\", and he seems to be seeking a medicine man in the Mexican outback.    Sprinkled throughout the book are all-out attacks on the running shoe industry.  If indeed this book hits the big-time mainstream best-seller list, it will be interesting to see if the multi-billion dollar running shoe industry responds.  What I see in this book is a lot of anti-running shoe ranting, minimal support for these arguments, and most of the protagonists wearing various forms of running shoes.  I'm not saying there might be some merit in attacking running shoe design, but I don't see much in the way of good science here to support this.    The proponent of \\"barefoot running\\" exits the stage with his feet heavily bandaged.    The chapters on ultrarunning center on a race called the \\"Leadville 100\\".  This left me with a vivid picture of what must the real core of ultrarunning culture.  Life should be what makes you happy and should provide you with the greatest utility.  If you would like to expend a great deal of energy to participate in a dangerous and obscure sport this is for you.  For the rest of us it provides some entertainment watching other people pushing their bodies to the limit.  How far and fast can they go ?    A scholarly detour asks the question \\"Did human evolve as running animals ?\\".  It's fairly convincing and interesting reading.  I especially enjoyed the discussion of \\"persistence hunting\\".  If you have vegetarian tendencies you may want to skip these chapters.    The climax of the book is a race, and I don't think this will be a spoiler to mention this, in the Tarahumara home country.  The organizer of this event is a mysterious and weird fellow with alias \\"Caballo Blanco\\" who seems to be forever running around the Copper Canyon in his Teva sandals.  This ghost-like person somehow puts together an impossible assemblage of Tarahumara and gringo ultrarunners for a 50 mile race.  Getting the Tarahumara to participate is a major roadblock, but when it finally happens there seems to be plenty of the elements of modern civilization appearing- hotels, cold beers, and internet connections.  The crowd goes wild and gets really drunk.  It's better than NASCAR (and I've been to the Daytona 500 three times).    I'm not going to recommend this book to anyone other than very serious runners, members of the running shoe industry, or any ultrarunner.  I hope I'm wrong and it has a wider readership.  More importantly, if it gets a few couch potatoes  into exercise that would be even better.  It's a fast read, with some difficulty following the multi-threaded plot leading to the big race.  I'm glad I read it, and I look forward to the great running shoe debate which will surely follow for the next several years.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The writing on this show is brilliant, and the actors carry out their lines well. Some people think that Inara is wooden, but I think that is how her training as a Companion would behave; very composed and proper. Also, other people complain about sex on this show, and how it has no place in science fiction. I totally disagree. If a series is supposed to be portraying the lives of 9 very different people (2 of whom are married on the ship), isn't sex a part of life? Every time I watch the last episode, I get depressed because there is nothing to follow. They did try to tie up some loose ends with the movie \\"Serenity,\\" but it still wasn't enough. Watching the bonus features, you can tell how much the actors loved and believed in the concept of Firefly, and how heartbroken they were when it was cancelled.     I am a casual Sci-Fi fan. I don't immerse myself in these different worlds the way other more die-hard fans will. I love the \\"Space Western\\" thing. I love that there are no aliens and no travel at warp speed or hyperspace. Some criticize all that as unbelievable, but I think it's just another option. I was introduced to the series only a couple of years ago. I don't remember it being advertised when it was originally aired. (Maybe because I didn't have cable then, and the local Fox channel didn't come in over our rabbit ears!)
B000VE439Y|5.0|\\"Life of Brian\\" is probably the greatest comedy ever made. (With the Python-related serial \\"Fawlty Towers\\" a good second.) It makes excellent fun out of religious and political fanaticism, not to mention sheer stupidity. The negative reactions to the movie from certain quarters somehow prove its point!<br /><br />Inevitably, most people react and comment on the portrayal of Jesus and his involuntary doppelg&auml;nger, Brian. Personally, I always thought other parts of the movie were more humorous. For instance, it criticizes the small and constantly squabbling \\"Marxist\\" groups that still existed in Britain and elsewhere during this time. That the Judean People's Front (or was it the People's Front of Judea?) turns out to be more interested in talking about revolution rather than in actually making one, is also right on target. Note also that the \\"Judean\\" groups lampoon the name of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine!<br /><br />But perhaps I like that part of the show because I happen to know a few things about the \\"far left\\" in Western Europe?<br /><br />But what about Jesus, then? Apparently, the Pythons had some disagreements among themselves on whether or not \\"The Life of Brian\\" is a deliberate attack on Jesus and Christianity. Regardless of what the \\"real\\" point of this movie might be, it's interesting to note that they couldn't attack Jesus directly. I don't think that's a co-incidence. You can insult or make fun of those who believe in the message of Christianity, but how do you wax ironic over the character of Jesus himself? Say, the Jesus of the Gospel of John? I don't see how *that's* possible. What makes \\"Life of Brian\\" so entertaining is precisely the contrast between the real Jesus and the perennial looser Brian. The same is true of the fact that the thick-headed people of Judea constantly confuse the real Son of God with his obviously incompetent double. That people follow the wrong leader, or misunderstand the words of great prophets and philosophers, is hardly news. Ironically, it's almost a Biblical theme. In fact, if you absolutely want to criticize this movie for something, it would have to be its unkind portrayal of the common people. Taken at face value, \\"Life of Brian\\" says that Jesus was a sublime teacher, while you and me are stupid for following the *other* guy!<br /><br />Never thought of that before, have you? :D<br /><br />Whatever else Monty Python might have wanted to say with \\"Life of Brian\\", they certainly made a classical parody of fanaticism, factionalism, abstract intellectuals, crazy terrorists, and thick-headed people in general. And yes, Roman crucifixions. TWELVE STARS.Ironically, it's almost a Biblical theme.

B001SO69IY|4.0|Ten years, three presidents and 2 wars ago Meth & Red were on top of their game. They had a movie, a TV show and a hit CD \\"Blackout!\\". What have they been doing since? Well Redman put out a couple solo CD's and Meth reunited with Wu, had a couple solo joints and starred in `The Wire'.  But that still doesn't answer the question: Why has it been so long for them to drop a sequel to \\"Blackout!\\"?<br /><br />The answer is not in \\"Blackout! 2\\". But what we do have is classic Red & Meth trading verses as only they can do. Redman's flow reminds me of his `Muddy Water' days. And Meth seems fresh, maybe because we ain't  heard from him in a while. The first single \\"Mrs. International\\" leaked on the internet. It was very refreshing to hear them rhyming over a sunny, summer-type beat. \\"City Lights\\" ft Bun B is solid. \\"A-Yo\\" sounds like `How High'. But don't be confused, Red & Meth still love to  get high. \\"Dis Iz 4 All My Smokers\\" is dedicated to doing just that.<br /><br />Who says you can't come back home. \\"Blackout! 2\\" is the perfect sequel to \\"Blackout!\\".

B00007KQA3|1.0|In many respects, this adaptation of George Orwell's \\"1984\\" should stand out as an example of how you don't adapt a novel for the big screen. No film version can ever match the depth and detail of the original novel upon which it is based, but when a film is done this badly it demands an answer the obvious question, \\"What was the director thinking?\\"<br /><br />To be fair, I like director Michael Radford's treatment of the external world of London as bleak and almost lifeless, although I think that the neighborhoods of the proletariat should have been much darker and more foreboding. Their environment seemed poor, but didn't evoke the same emotions as Orwell's well-written descriptions of dark alleys and the myriad of pubs that are filled with the down-trodden masses of non-party members. And with that same thought in mind we begin to see the first of many departures from the novel - aside from the antique shop and Winston's prostitute encounter there are no portrayals of any of the other scenes that make up more of the surrounding story in the proletariat world.<br /><br />I realize that a director only has so much time to work with when creating a movie, but this director left out large chunks of the story in order to make it fit the time frame, and I feel sorry for anyone that hasn't read the book because so much of the movie won't mean anything. This movie could almost represent a condensed version of the original, except that it shows scenes out of order, it doesn't explain why so much of the story is actually occurring, and it changes a great deal of the detail in ways that are unforgivable. Here are just a few examples: In the novel Winston worked for Minitrue (Ministry of Truth), although in the film it mentions Winston working for Minirec (Ministry of Records). In the novel Winston does not exclaim that he hates Julia before discovering that she secretly loves him. In the film, Winston's vision of Julia undressing in a field occurs just before their first romantic encounter, not some weeks earlier in a dream as in the novel. I could go on and on, but there are a great number of these scenes that are not simply errors or a failure of attention to detail, they are the director's deliberate attempts to place his stamp on someone else's work. I believe in artistic expression, but if you want to make your own mark - create your own story; don't create a hatchet-job of someone else's work.<br /><br />One of my largest complaints is the deliberate omission of a great detail of information surrounding the Socialism and Communism themes that are so prevalent in the novel; Ingsoc is never explained as a newspeak amalgamation of English Socialism, everyone is called brother or sister instead of comrade, and the recurring treatment of society's failed attempts to obtain even the most basic of necessities of life due to the government's ineptitude at production are missing. What's more infuriating is the portrayal of Winston's day-to-day activities at Minitrue/Minirec - you're vaguely aware that he is doing SOMETHING, but the film version manages to omit what that actually is. Having read the book we know that he was altering the past, but the film doesn't convey that. In fact, the film conveys very little - if you have read the book then the film simply gives you fleeting images to go along with the story line that you already know, but in most respects the film's failure to align with the novel begins to interfere with what you remember about the story.<br /><br />Much like \\"Animal Farm\\", which is George Orwell's other treatment of communism, \\"1984\\" is supposed to be a sharp arrow piercing through the utopian vision of a communism by portraying a world where a corrupt government cannot live up to its promises, but this adaptation completely misses the target. At the time this movie was created the Cold War was still raging, and I can only surmise that the director toned down the communist-themed overtones in order to appease theSoviet Union; if that's the case - that's a really weak argument.<br /><br />I truly feel sorry for someone that sees this film and has never read the book. After watching this movie I got the feeling that the director, Michael Radford, was trying to create a visual masterpiece like Stanley Kubrick did with \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\", but unfortunately Michael Radford is NOT Stanley Kubrick, and as a result he created a film that is little more than an insult to the original novel, and my only take-away from this film is the feeling that I have lost two hours of my life.- that's a really weak argument.

B00004RF9B|5.0|Forbidden Planet is a classic of science fiction. By todays standards the visual effects are antiquated but this movie was made over 50 years ago and with that in mind, the special effects are special. Also a great story of man's intrinsically evil inner self.
B000J103PC|1.0|** movie spoiler ahead **  i have seen so many movies like this: want to be glamorous -- find that it is against their natural being or conscience -- and then learn the opposite.    maybe if you never watch something like this, then you will find the movie very original.  otherwise, i don't see anything special about this movie.    the reason i give it 1 star is: the movie trailer i saw, it showed 2 minutes of the movie, instead of showing different parts of the movie briefly, which is the usual way of showing a trailer.  If I had seen the various parts, i would have known what this movie is about, and will not watch it, knowing that it is the same old same old.  Well, the marketing is smart to just show 2 minutes of an interesting part of the movie.  In a way, they are pretending to be something that they are not.  Just like what the story is about: pretending to be somebody who they are not.
0689878451|1.0|The illustrations were beautiful and in some respects it is an interesting story.  However, the writing lacks any flow or literary mastery.  It sounds like a vocabulary-deficient 10-year-old writing an assigned book report.  There is no real beauty in the telling...<br /><br />I sincerely believe that the only reason people are even reviewing this book is \\"agenda\\".  Those opposed to homosexual parenting are just out to bash it (as if it's not apparent from their review they haven't even read the book - they are just \\"towing the party line\\").  However, I also don't understand why LGBT community is blindly embracing this book.  It's seems contrary to the intended point to use a book about a one-time anomoly, synthetic environment, and manufactured situation to support that homosexuality is normal.  This actually undermines the goal...<br /><br />For a truly enjoyable book with a natural family, try \\"The Different Dragon\\" by Jennifer Bryan.

B0021TVYVC|4.0|Review by Metal-Head-Ted (Karyn's Husband)    The eagerly awaited new Black Sabbath (ok-Heaven and Hell)album/ DVD  showcases Dio's amazing vocal range and Iommi's HEAVY riffs.Bassist Geezer and drummer Appice are equally amazing in bringing back the trademark \\"Dio/Sabbath\\" sound. Their last one was more of a Greatest Hits  with 3 new tracks ( only 1 new track was great). Yes, it has been a few years since their underated metal masterpiece, \\"Dehumanizer\\" which was also a killer concept album. Dio is still writing all the lyrics and we are taken on a journey of demons, pain, and the usual dark places. This new one doesn't quite live up to \\"Dehumanizer\\" but still leaves its mark on you. \\"Bible Black\\" stands out as the best track on the album (possibly their best since their \\"Mob Rules\\" days) \\"Fear\\" is one I hope to see them play on this summer's upcoming tour. \\"Eating The Cannibals\\" is another classic to be. As a Sabbath fan, you're usually split into two groups:  1) The Ozzy/Sabbath Fan who loved Ozzy at the helm and wants only Ozzy.  2) The Dio/Sabbath Fan who loves Dio back at his rightful throne.  Both are great, but I have to go with Dio/Sabbath. Dio has always had more  range and talent and more of an imagination in the songwriting.   This new album does rock, just not as good as 'Heaven/Hell' or 'Mob Rules'.I think it has just been too many years in -between \\"Dehumanizer\\" and Now.  The Bonus DVD is fun, too. Behind the scenes, Etc.

B002AR9YPI|5.0|First off, I'm not a Grizzly Bear fanboy or anything. This is the first album by Grizzly Bear that I've bought. I've been looking at buying yellow house for a while but haven't seen it on sale. I saw this for $3.99 and thought I'd give it a try. I'm definitely satisfied with the album, especially for four dollars. The songs have a nice progression to them that isn't really translated well in the 30 second samples. If you're on the fence about this album like I was, just buy it. You won't be disappointed.
B00000JQFM|5.0|I could not possibly put into words how awesome this album is.In my opinion it is my favorite album to play while driving. The album that put \\"Satch\\" on the map.This guy was Steve Vai's guitar teacher. Shred on Joe!

B000Q6GUT8|5.0|I am very happy with my purchase.  The seller was pronpt on the shipment, and the movie arrive in perfect shape.
B001IBIQU6|1.0|After much anticipation for the new D-M CD I must admit I was very disappointed. The sound is flat and boring. This CD lacks the excitement of previous D-M albums. I hope they will try again and hopefully recapture the previous sound and unique excitement of their music.
B001E1RQ3I|5.0|I have read several Clancy books.  This is probably my favorite.  If you like books on spec ops this is the one for you.  The book is a little long at 895 pgs for the paperback.  Definately worth it.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Incredibly creative story with interesting subplots.  It might be considered socially irresponsible to make a serial killer a hero   but he is always seeking-seeking-seeking a way to be normal. His narration of his feelings is very compelling to those with a psychological bent and boring to those without one.

B0007KTBIU|4.0|A fun story about the collision of cultures as the English and the native American tribes clash with each other in colonial Virginia. As always with Disney films there is some excellent musical scores and an entertaining storyline. A fun film for the whole family!
0307266303|5.0|How did I hear about this book?  I was thinking of what would be my next audio book when I stumbled across this.  Complete serendiptiy!  I was never a runner--only jogged and did wind sprints because soccer required it.  I urge you audiophiles to listen to this because the reader adds immeasurably to the book.  I have listened to it twice.  In an age of extreme narcissism--when people twitter and facebook their every thought and meal--this book talks about what it is to be human, to run and to excel just for the joy of it.  This book will be a good read 25 years from now.
B001GQSY5K|5.0|An outstanding animated movie, Star Wars: The Clone Wars brings to the screen one of the War's breathtaking stories involving rescuing Jabba the Hutt's son (thus allowing the Republic travel through the crime lord's trade routes) and preventing an alliance between the Hutts' crime syndicate and the Separatists.   Set between Episodes Two and Three, the film sheds light on events involving some of the most impressive Jedi knights such as Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, while introducing Ahsoka Tano, Anakin's first Padawan.  The cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are AMAZING to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows as the animation comes ALIVE, allowing for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again.  The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the battle sequences, and the music are all EXCELLENT!  Star Wars: The Clone Wars kicks off the new animated series with a bang, making it a film definitely worth adding to your Star Wars collection, along with Star Wars-Clone Wars Vols. 1&2! In short, KEEP'EM COMING!!!
006085880X|5.0|Originally released in 1997, \\"The Pact,\\" is probably one of Jodi Picoult's best known works. It has garnered a pretty strong cult following.  As a result it's one of those books we can say has a love it or hate it relationship.  There are few who will find themselves in between.  Love it or hate it, one can't deny how much Picoult's novel opens the door to a very serious issue.<br /><br />The Golds and the Hartes have been friends for a long time.  They're next door neighbors who have become close.  Their children Emily Gold and Christopher Harte have become close over the years, and it comes as no surprise to their parents.  Then, out of the blue, Emily Gold kills herself in what was apparently supposed to be a suicide pact between Emily and Chris.  Now Emily is dead, and Chris is alive and well, and he's the only one who has any answers.  Now Emily's parents are trying to find out what happened to their daughter, and are also wondering just how well they knew her, while Chris is up to his neck in a legal squabble.  The friendship between the two families that seemed eternal suddenly comes crashing down, as both sets of parents come to the realization that they didn't know their children quite as well as they thought.<br /><br />Needless to say, there's a lot of drama in Picoult's novel, and a lot of emotional turmoil.  Jodi Picoult is no stranger to dealing with tough issues and exploring them.  The Pact is no different, but here Jodi Picoult goes further into the heart of the matter.  By exploring not just how the character cope with Emily's suicide, but also what lead Emily to do it in the first place.  The book plays out by alternating between the past and the present.  The reader literally gets to know Emily's life story.  We're there from the moment she is born, to the moment all the way to her death.  As a result, the reader really gets to know Emily Gold.  And not just Emily Gold.  We get to know Chris Harte as well.  In fact, we get to know every character and they all become incredibly well developed.  Sometimes a little too much.  We learn a little bit more about some characters than we'd care to know.  At times Picoult can carry on about a character, but at least she keeps it interesting.<br /><br />However, the story moves at a smooth pace.  The read is, overall, a fairly quick one.  And the drama keeps coming with all the twists and turns.  It's hard not to feel Picoult pulling at your heart strings.  All the drama and characters lead to a pretty big conclusion.  In the past, Jodi Picoult has sometimes come to implausible conclusions.  You might get a similar feeling here.  The book is very enjoyable, and the conclusion is even alright, although it isn't entirely believable.<br /><br />The writing stands firm.  It's very well written with elegant prose and vivid descriptions.  Sometimes you get the sense that Picoult is providing too much description.  At the very least you'll never feel drowned out in it.  The dialog is also nice, coming off as very natural rather than scripted.<br /><br />The Pact is a very nice book that's filled with very lovable characters.  Its sure to spark a bit of discussion among readers.  It's a very likable book that is filled with it's own charms.  It is one of Picoult's best.become incredibly well developed.

B001RTP3Z0|5.0|Fast delivery of a perfect show. Leonard Cohen has aged like fine wine. I do not care for his albums from the 70s and 80s but his performance in this DVD is outstanding.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I got this dvd deciding that I wanted to start working out, so I was a complete beginner. This is -not- an easy workout by any means. The first few days that I did level 1, I got my butt handed to me. I was panting sweating and completely exhausted by the end of it. Sometimes I couldn't do everything as quickly as they did on the dvd, but I gave it my all and within 3 workouts, I was already noticing a major change in the muscles in my arms and abs. Like the title of my review, you truly get out of this what you put into it.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like was that you can't skip the introduction, and end up having to wait around for 5 to 10 minutes before every workout
B001EOQWFI|5.0|I saw this movie on DVD first, then bought it on Blu-Ray.  It is AMAZING on Blu-Ray.  The story itself is one of my favorites of all time.  I was skeptical at first, but am completely satisfied with my purchase.
B000FA57N0|5.0|The movie is amazing. If you liked the series Firefly, this ties up the lose ends wonderfully. If you have never seen the series, you will still be able to follow the movie perfectly, and you will fall in love with the cast, then you will need to watch the series.    The quality of the movie on this disc is amazing. Flawless. The sound is better than the DVD also. It's a shame that the inherently flawed and infinitely more expensive Blu-Ray format won the war. But rumor has it China is backing an HD-DVD format, so maybe there is some future for the best video format ever. I hope.    R.I.P. HD-DVD - You may be gone, but you will always be the winner of my heart.
B000HWZ4A2|5.0|Fountainhead, the 1949 movie, is based on the 1943 novel by Ayn Rand. The theme of individualism as the key to man's progress is made in the historical setting of the twenties and thirties when collectivism (what we may now call socialism) appeared to be threatening individualism.    Though the setting is now a bit dated, the theme of individualism and the right to express it versus compromise of principle to please an unappreciative public and reap more immediate financial reward will still resonate with many today.    The book itself was an example of the theme of uncompromising individualism.  It had difficulties being published and when it was, it was not well advertised. It did not appeal to the masses. It became popular by word of mouth through networks of people who were able to appreciate its themes.  The book's manner of success mirrors the success of the work of the book's hero, Howard Roarke, an architect, whose work was also recognized by those with the intellectual understanding to appreciate it.    But the film is a compromise of these principles.  A quick glimpse of the cover demonstrates that the movie was marketed as a romance.  Many of the more graphical sexual encounters in the book are toned down.  A rape becomes a kiss.  A marriage that ends in a divorce becomes an engagement that is broken.  Discussions of atheism are deleted. Reference to a 'temple to humanity' is eliminated and its role in the plot is combined into another building.      For the absolute individualist, as was the hero of the book, such compromises by the author, who also wrote the screenplay, seems out of character.  The book's hero speaks of the integrity of a building and describes how building facades designed to appeal to the public are a compromise to a buiding's integrity.  One can make the same case with respect to a book and this film.  We might ask if the book's integrity was compromised in the facades that were incorporated into the movie that allowed it to become more acceptable to the viewing public.    Yet, for those who haven't read the book, who are not aware of these compromises of integrity, the themes of individualism, work for the sake of work with uncompromising quality and integrity, and the mediocrity that results from collectivism, will still be communicated.      In the movie, Patricia Neal does an excellent job as Dominique, the heroine, who understands the themes of quality and individualism.  Dominique is so pained by the inability of the masses to see these qualilties that she purposefully puts herself into situations to avoid contact with the people who exhibit these admirable qualities.  She does so because she does not want to see the persons and their work hurt by the unseeing and inappreciative masses.      The quality people she tries to avoid also include the hero, an architect, Howard Roarke, played by Gary Cooper in the movie.   A complicated love triangle ensues between Roarke, Dominique, and Wynand, a newspaper editor who can see the truth but makes his living by marketing Enquirer type journalism to the masses. Though romance is involved, it is a subordinate theme of the individual (uncompromising quality and integrity) versus the collective (mediocrity and mass misery).    Gary Cooper plays the brilliant and uncompromising individualist and artistic architect, Howard Roarke.  Cooper is less convincing in his role than is Patricia Neal as Dominique.  But Cooper, like Patricia Neal, was a big name star at the time and certainly helped ticket sales for the movie.    Overall the movie is an example of what the book appears to declare to be wrong with the world. It is a product of the collective. In this case that collective includes the movie producers in addition to the individual author and screenwriter. The movie compromises the integrity of the original book so that the movie can be more markettable to the masses. This is evident in its marketting, skipping over more controversial social topics,and using a condensed plot to maintain the focus of an audience expected to have a limited attention span.      If Ayn Rand had the integrity of her character, Howard Roarke, she would have planted explosives in the movie studio production lab and destroyed the original master film.    For those who are a fan of the book, I still suggest viewing the movie, but with caution. One must be willing to compromise the individual efforts of Ayn Rand with the collective influence of the movie industry in order to view this movie.     For those who have not read the book, the movie is still a good watch and still engages the questions of individualism and collectivism.  I suspect that those who find personal resonance with the themes in the movie will also want to read the book.  If the movie viewer does read the book, then the movie did some good, and may have redeemed itself.
B001C3KCSY|4.0|So - I kept hearing all the hoopla on Kings of Leon and bought Because of the Times. I didn't really hear any Southern Rock at all - but on this CD, I guess I hear what people were talking about. While it isn't Southern Rock like Cross Canadian Ragweed - I like this CD much better. The songs tell a better story to me, and I definately like the actual music better. It's not just one song either - it's the whole thing. I could see road-tripping with this CD along with some CCR and Pat Green. While this may be a more mainstream effort and not supposedly as cool - so be it. I just know I like good tunes that I can relate to - and this CD has it for me.

B00102F5WK|4.0|\\"Rendition\\" is two stories that converge at the climax. The first is of a legal alien, chemical engineer, married to an American citizen. The second is a police official from a North African nation who's independent-minded daughter has not been home for seven days. He wants her to return and prepare for the marriage he has arranged.<br /><br />Anwar El-Ibrahimi, played by Omar Metwally is abducted as he lands in Washington D. C. where his name is erased from the passenger manifest. He is hooded, isolated, questioned, and not allowed to make contact with anyone. The order to have him abducted has already been given by a government official, Corrine Whitman who is played by Meryl Streep. She plays the part of an arrogant, calculating, you-know-what. As a government director she is confident, and wields her power without remorse.<br /><br />Reese Witherspoon is the wife of Anwar El-Ibrahimi. While the airline denies that he is a passenger, she discovers that he was checked in on the flight from Johannesburg, and used his credit card for duty-free purchases on the flight home, but there is no husband at arrivals.<br /><br />The decision is made to take Ibrahimi to an unnamed North African nation for rendition. Here we get to see how he is stripped, racked, confined, shackled, and water boarded. A C.I.A. analyst (Jake Gyllenhaall) watches as he is the default person in place, after a public square explosion hours earlier killed his colleague. The bomb was the second attempt on the official's life.<br /><br />This story is not about anyone in particular, but it does bear a resemblance to the Canadian citizen who was abducted by Americans with the complicity of the head of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police who eventually resigned in disgrace. This also represents what has been going on here in the land of the free, and this is the most frightening part for me as I am a life-long believer that Americans would never tolerate such a policy but would rebel against it. The story spells out clearly that rendition was started in the Clinton administration in one of his bids to move more to the center or right to please conservatives who would never accept him anyway.  The movie also makes clear that 9/11 especially in the hands of a President who believed he could do no wrong or a Vice President who didn't care if he did or didn't, would use rendition so often.<br /><br />Without telling you the remainder of the storyline, the one thing \\"Rendition\\" lacked for me was suspense. Only one part of the ending came as a surprise, and I have already alluded to that two times in this review. Part of the end was farfetched and divorced from reality, even if it did somewhat satisfy my sense of justice and retribution. The cast and casting were superb, but the music, unfortunately sounded like it was borrowed from \\"Gladiator\\"  and \\"Troy.\\" It must be a very popular style lately.<br /><br />The DVD also includes special features. These are \\"Outlawed\\" documentary which is excellent for only twenty plus minutes, \\"Intersections: the Making of Rendition\\" Documentary, five deleted scenes including an alternate ending, and director commentary.<br /><br />After World War II, the American army forced the local German civilians to view the corpses in over 100 death camps they \\"never knew\\" existed. The purpose was to ensure that the Germans could never deny what happened. Seventy years later, it is time for Americans to do the same by watching this picture as a start to learn all about the torture we have committed and caused in the name of security or even freedom, while claiming to be a nation governed by the rule of law.<br /><br />You won't want to miss this, but you won't want to watch it either.tion was started in the Clinton administration in one of his bids to move more to the center or right to please conservatives who would never accept him anyway.

0765316889|5.0|Vin, Elend, and company struggle to maintain hold of Luthadel a year later in \\"The Well of Ascension\\", second book of the \\"Mistborn\\" saga.  Every chapter has a purpose, little is wasted conveying useless information unless one finds the political maneuvering boring waiting for the amazing Allomancy encounters.  The political intrigue is carefully thought out, the romance between Vin and Elend develops properly, and the unique creatures are practical and suitably placed.<br /><br />Additional characters join the cast, the more notable ones are Mistborn Zane and Keeper Tindwyl.  I enjoyed learning more about Feruchemy.  The clever concept behind the Deepness and its overwhelming influence sets a fresh approach as an antagonist.<br /><br />The possible major editing issue concerns the confusion at the start of Chapter 24 when Vin asks Clubs to burn bronze for sensing Allomancy but as a smoker only burns copper.  He stated he heard nothing, which is true in a way but only because he cannot burn bronze.  The summary of book 1 is at the end, it better serves a reader placing it at the beginning.<br /><br />Check out the author's web page at [...] for excellent inside information and deleted scenes (he provides warnings before any spoilers).<br /><br />I highly recommend this series to any fan of the fantasy genre.<br /><br />Thank you.

B001NFNFNA|3.0|This a very dramatic storyline where Angelina Jolie's character comes home to find her son missing. Then after 5 months of searching the police come home with the wrong boy. After all the drama with the \\"fake son\\" the police declare her mentally incompetent and have her committed.  It's a very depressing story without any hope of her finding her son since it is based on a true story. Jolie's performance was amazing but the story itself was grim and somber. This is a movie to rent not to have as a movie night on a rainy day.

B000092T6M|4.0|I watched this movie for the second time since it was released because of my admittedly late-blooming Alan Rickman obsession.  Oh, it was awful, and even Alan couldn't justify a purchase for me.  Kevin Costner has the emotional range of a hot dog vendor at a baseball game in all his films, and sadly has the lion's share of screen time in them as well.    Then I heard about this version through some fan sites and took a chance.  No, the added Rickman footage doesn't make much difference ultimately to the story line, but who cares?  His scenery chewing is positively gleeful in the deleted material, and twice as much fun to watch.  It's easy to see why Costner demanded his scenes be cut out, because he steals even more of the movie (as he always does) with them in.      Thoughtfully, the DVD has bookmarks at most of Rickman's parts, so it's fairly easy to skim over all the boring Robin Hood stuff.  Before it arrived I wished I had opted for the new Blu-Ray based on reports of too-dark scenes on this release, but it looks just fine on my TV.  Alan even appears (briefly) in the making-of in the extras (a rare occurrence).  Rickman fans rejoice!

All is fine until one such enforcer (Christian Bale from The Machinist, Harsh Times, American Psycho, etc.) misses his daily dose, causing his mind to clear and his emotions to activate. This leads him into a career-ruining journey of self-disovery, a true spiritual awakening, oh yeah, and several  wonderful displays of the old ultra-violence! EQUILIBRIUM deserves a top spot in the dystopian movie universe, along w/ 1984, FERENHEIT 451, BRAZIL, V FOR VENDETTA, THE MATRIX, METROPOLIS, BLADERUNNER, and other classics. Bale is astonishing as usual, once again becoming the man he portrays. Don't let this one get away...
B00011RPB0|5.0|There seems to be a chasm between people who like this and people who don't. I think you have to experience these kind of moments to appreciate them fully. Not everyone does. But I totally understood this movie from the beginning to the end. I totally related to the plot and characters. In fact, I could change places with Bill Murray's character and never miss a beat. I've also know beautiful young ladies like Scarlett's character at an emotional level like this. I've connected with people in crowded places just like this. I've experienced job burn-out and marriage just like this. I've sold out and bought in just like this. I've experienced confusion like this. And the pace of this movie was perfect in my humble opinion. You have to inhale deeply with a movie like this. It's transcending to see yourself in a movie. It's the ultimate movie experience.
B000WZAE1I|4.0|This film uses the time honored talent of DeNiro and Michelle Pheiffer, along with relative new comer Claire Danes. This unusual fantasy story line unfolds brilliantly. I found it complicated, and requiring attention and thought. There is one scene where an annoying salesman (Ricky Gervasi) meets his end, and it makes me laugh every time I watch it. I mention this because I cannot recall ever laughing at a death scene. Cameo appearance by Peter O'Toole, but this movie is so much more than the people in it. It's well edited, acted, and has several twists, turns and surprises.
1905654294|4.0|I heard about the Twilight Saga before the movie had first come out. I didn't want to read the books before because they didn't seem interesting. Then all my friends told me that: \\"Twilight is the best book ever!\\" \\"It's really good, and you should read it.\\" I started reading it when the movie had first come out. I just have to say read the book first then go see the movie! After I finished Twilight I really liked it and started to read the others and of course they were really good.   Spoiler Warning Below  So then I finally started to read Breaking Dawn. It was a very predictable book, since it was the last one in the series and you knew what still had to be done. Bella still needed to become a vampire, Edward and Bella were going to get married and the Volturi had an expected visit sometime. Although, there were some surprises that I did not expect. Bella having a vampire baby, Alice had left the family, the Voultri coming for the Cullen's, and how everything turned out in the end. The book was so good that it was hard for me to stop reading, and I felt like I was there when everything was happening.    Just like the characters in the first three books I liked and disliked them at some parts because of their actions. New Moon I really didn't like Edward since he left. Then once Bella started hanging out with Jacob so much I really got to see what his character was like and Stephanie Meyers did a good job of that. So in Breaking Dawn I liked Jacob because he left his pack for what he believed in, and that was that the baby Bella was having had been no danger to anyone. I have to say that the character that I liked the most through out all four books was Alice. I liked her personality and how she fit into the family. When she left the note saying that her and Jasper were leaving, the Cullen family didn't seem complete.  There were some parts in the book that I was disappointed about, they didn't seem mature enough for the reader level. The book is young adult and itdidn't seem to mature when it came to the romantic scenes. I think that she could have done a better job than that.  I noticed that there were three different books inside Breaking Dawn. So it changed point of views for Bella to Jacob to Bella again. It made the book confusing at times. Which I didn't like that because something big would then happen and it was changed to Jacobs's point of view and nothing really exciting in the beginning of his book. What I now realize is why she changed to point of views, at first I thought that it was pointless, but it's part of the plot. The chapter would end suddenly and go to Jacob just as something happened to Bella. I think Bella should have gotten to tell her story more.  I loved all the books and I am sad that the series is over. I know people hate when they keep dragging the series on and on, but I think this book is worthwhile to keep adding more books the saga. The book was the perfect amount of suspense and drama; it made you want to keep reading until you finally finished the book. The first movie was really good at following the plot of the book, which made it better to understand what the characters looked like, and to understand what some of the scenery looked like. I would recommend this book and the rest of the series to anyone who likes to read about drama and romance novels.
1439138311|5.0|The book takes place during the era when I was a kid in Brooklyn. Eilis Lacey could well have been one of our neighbors.  The author gets the time, the atmosphere and the details just right.  The plot of Brooklyn has been recapped previously, so I won't go there. Instead, all I can say is that Eilis is such a believable character, her life is so realistic, this becomes more than a book. It's almost a 3 dimensional representation.  This is a book you get lost in...pick it up and think \\"I'll read a couple of pages and start dinner\\" and your family will go hungry, because hours will pass while your mind and spirit walk down those Brooklyn Streets.  My only caveat is this:  The book takes a long time to get started.  Eilis is long-winded, short on action, and a total bore until she puts an ocean between herself and Ireland.  Then she and the book spring to life.  Stick with it, please. It's worth the agony of those first 70 or 80 pages.  If you enjoyed Betty Smith's \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,\\" this book is for you. Eilis is the next generation, a true heir to Francis Nolan!
1423101472|5.0|Percy Jackson has had a hard life in his 4 books fallowing this one. But it is going to get a whole lot harder. As soon as I herd this book was coming out I ran out and bought it. I finished it in a week I couldn't put it down. In this   Final epic tale of Percy and his friends Grover, Annabeth, and the return of Thila they fight heroically to save Olympus and some surprising allies show up on the way. Percy alone has the power to save the world. Will he make the right choice? I loved this book so much I wish I didn't finish it. Not only for the action but for the twists and turns. Plus, its not bad for a history lesson.
0312370849|5.0|As the book opens, French jews are being rounded up for transport to Nazi concentration camps. This was a surprise to me, and perhaps will also shock other Americans. I had no idea that the French collaborated in rounding up Jews and sending them on to Nazi death camps. When the French police come to get her and her family, 20-year old Sarah tries to save her brother from the round up by hiding him in a secret compartment in a back closet.  Sarah promises to somehow come back and release the child...but instead, she is taken on a horrific journey from one prison to another and ends up in a concentration camp...knowing her terrible secret and unable to save her brother.  At this point, the book jumps forward in time, and focuses on an American writer who is researching the sad history of the Velo d'Hiv. This indoor cycling arena is where the Parisian police kept Jews until they could be transported to various camps across Europe.  The writer uncovers Sara's horrifying fate and her desperate secret...and she also learns more than she wants to about her husband's family and their involvement in the Vichy government and its activities.  This is an amazing book, horrifying, heart-breaking, and beautifully crafted. Sometimes books that springboard between past and present become unwieldy, but Sarah's Key stays right on point.  Seeing the round up and the camps through the eyes of a bright, sensitive ten year old girl gives us a piercing new perspective and makes the experience all the more painful.  The fact that we never get an answer to the question that's burning in every reader's mind makes the book all the more tantalizing and all the more poignant.
B001TODCII|5.0|What a great fast action movie. I was cheering for the father all the way. It is a movie worth watching. I was glad that the good guy won.
B0024F13NC|4.0|Re-released to coincide with their upcming Cruefest 2 Tour, where it will be played in its entirety, this version of Dr. Feelgood shows that some bands are too high in their laurels to pay attention to their released product.    When Motley was struggling in the mid 90s to stay relevant, they released the excellent Crucial Crue series, which included demos, instrumentals and unreleased versions.   Dr. Feelgood's Crucial Crue is excellent and complete.  Including FOUR demos and the unavailable Get It For Free, it encompassed the process that led to the success of Dr. Feelgood.      However, this new version, includes only the five singles in live versions previously found in 1998's Motley Crue Live Entertainment or Death, which, in itself, is a very bad live album.    So, do yourself a favor and hunt for the Crucial Crue version, if you don't have it, and stay away from this re-re-release that adds nothing of value to this magnificent album.

0439023483|2.0|This book, while containing the potential to distinguish itself from the others in a recent slew of YA dystopian novels, was somewhat of a letdown.  The only two stars it earns come from the writing itself--while it wasn't groundbreaking or anything, it was good.  Otherwise, the plot was completely derivative: strong, mature heroine who can take care of others, post-apocalytic setting that drives characters to the brink, and a cruel \\"game\\" in which the cost of losing is death.  If you haven't read the book, the Hunger Games is an annual event in which children kill each other in order to earn food for their region's people.  Hmm...not to reiterate the other reviewer's observations, but doesn't this sound like a sad fusion of Battle Royale, Lord of the Flies, and The Long Walk?      While I was interested in the book at first because I enjoyed those three titles, hoping it would unearth some new ideas other authors ignored while writing, the story turned out more like an adult concept dumbed down for middle-schoolers.    Overall, if you are a 11-13-year-old who has yet to enjoy other previously written novels sharing this concept, then you'll find this a compelling story.  Those at a high school level or above are better off checking out the classics.    P.S. This book does not come to its conclusion on the last page.  It is part of a series.  I didn't even learn this until I read the last words.  Hopefully, the sequels will branch off from this unimaginative start and take their own path, which I think Suzanne Collins is very capable of.
0393324818|5.0|The modern era of business analytics will be forced to address the harnessing of never-before-seen data storage and processing capabilities.  \\"Moneyball\\" may focus on applications confined to a kid's game, but the lessons drawn from Billy Beane and company's success can be extended throughout modern business.<br /><br />This book made me believe in the power of statistical analysis.
B001C3KCSY|4.0|This album is appealing sensitive; the emotional terrain covered is subtle and complex, but Caleb's scruffy, impassioned voice keeps things from getting too soft.  The album has a singer-songwriter feel to it because, well, the intensity of the album is found in the lyrics, melodies, and Caleb's voice.  The Kings of Leon are touted up as a southern rock band, but the only traces of southern rock that I heard on this album were Caleb's singing style and the spirituality of it all.  Otherwise, the instrumentals were pure indie/alternative (minimalistic instrumentals, lots of reverb.)<br /><br />This album is not my kind of music typically, but I kept going back to it (4 listens) in the attempt to decipher what it \\"meant.\\"  The songs feel very personal and intimate, they sound like a soundtrack to Caleb's life.  They're more compelling than catchy.  Interestingly, by engendering repeated listens, they became the soundtrack to my life for a while.  Cool trick.  If you listen to these songs long enough, you will find yourself attaching them to specific moods and moments.<br /><br />This album is great walking and thinking music.  It's perfect for when you want some music to keep you company but you also need space to brood and muse.  With this album, just pop in the earbuds and go.  Now that I know these songs well, the listening experience is cathartic and pleasurable.<br /><br />Last point . . . the overall vibe of this album is contemplative,  but the variety is good.  There's some uptempo stuff that will keep you from falling asleep, thinking too much, and walking too far . . .
0061562408|5.0|This is just a wonderfully written story of how to live one's life as seen both through a dog's eyes and the techniques of car racing---- a combination that is impossible to explain until one picks up the book and reads it.

B001TODCII|5.0|\\"Taken\\" is one of those movies for your personal library. Liam Neeson does a convincing job of demonstrating the virility and vitality of the aging Baby Boomer. He's what Jason Bourne grows up to be.  Neeson's character doesn't knock you over with quick quips and a bevy of beauties.  He's merely a dedicated former government agent who has learned some \\"tricks\\" of the trade.  The screenwriter did an excellent job of creating a \\"He-man\\" without becoming a cliché'. By Neeson recovering his daughter where his ex-wife's new rich husband isn't able to rise to the occasion, says the man who can really protect his family with sheer prowess is the better man. How could the ex-wife go back to a normal life when the real man (Neeson) lives across town? Of course, all this is subtle subtext.    The salient point is that Neeson is amoral, doing what is appropriate for the situation to affect an ideal outcome.  Neeson does the unthinkable in ways that are believable. No extraordinary special effects, no superhuman feats only possible for a man 20 years younger. In short, just plain old \\"Americana.\\" Man encounters challenge. Man meets challenge head-on. Man triumphs!     I highly recommend \\"Taken\\". Neeson exhibits the subtle charisma of a Harrison Ford.    Edward Brown  Core Edge Image & Charisma Institute  [...]

1604590483|5.0|This book has become my bible. Joseph Murphy is a master of the subconscious. His book teaches you how to think, how to train your mind, to attain whatever you wish in life. It's not a matter of 'I want this, therefore it should/will be mine.' It's a matter of saying and thinking about what you want in such detail and so frequently that you begin to believe it's already present. The trick is in the repetition, and opening your mind, so your subconscious can pick it up as truth. It works.
B000002LCK|2.0|I only recieved 1/2 of this order ( disk#2)- not sure what went wrong where, seems like miscommunication between Amazon and the seller? Still, the seller was kind enough to refund the full amount paid, and although I oferred to return the disk I DID recieve, the seller did not ask for it to be returned.
B000JMKNJ2|4.0|I'd read a couple of the critical reviews.     Yes, the blue language was overdone. Even obnoxious sometimes, unnecessary, and made me somewhat less willing to believe and invest in the characters and story - initially.    And the jumping around in the time line was irritating at first. Until I recognized that my irritation was born of wanting to know what happened next. And that, for me, is the mark of a good story. So the two timelines told several good stories between them and after getting used to it, I could live with it.    Bottom line - if you persevere just a bit, soon enough you will be accustomed to the harsh language, tolerant of the time frame jumps, and highly interested in the success of the characters.    In the end, the book is pretty fun stuff, and a step higher than most of the fantasy fare out there today.    By comparison, I did not think it was as good as Joe Abercrombie's First Law series. BUT it had a similar unique slant, focused as it was on a young con man in the criminal underbelly of a fantasy realm.    Recommended.

B001RTP48G|5.0|The Pet Shop Boys newest album \\"Yes\\" is amazing!!    This is not going to be a very detailed review, so forgive me.  But, if  you liked the Pet Shop Boys back in the 80's and early 90's, then you're going to love this newest album \\"Yes\\".   You know the sound, and you know the consistency of their lyrics, music, and messages throughout their songs from way back when.  This album is all that and more.    Just buy it, and enjoy it.  It will take you back to a much better day, when music was just, well....music.      Is it their best effort?  Not really.  But, it is very representative of what made the Pet Shop Boys so popular early in their career.    I purchased the imported, bonus CD, and I highly recommend it as the additional song, as well as the dub remixes are fantastic, and I normally don't care for dub versions.    In addition, make sure to purchase the \\"Love, Etc...\\" regular version single.  It has 2 songs on it that aren't on any of the different versions of the \\"Yes\\" album.  Both of these newer songs on the sinlge are superb.

B00004RFFS|4.0|The pace for this movie is a LOT slower than I remembered. I prefer the book, in which Louis seems a gentle creature, whereas in the movie they turn him into a cold monster similar to Lestat. However, the film still does the job and gets the gist of the book across. Stick with the book, though, for a better, more intriguing journey.

B00004RJ74|4.0|Since the movie itself has already been reviewed, the one thing I want to share is what is included in the EXTRA / BONUS MATERIALS that is not mentioned elsewhere in the product description on the main page for this product.      Feature commentary with Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino; Outtakes;   \\"Hollywood Goes to Hell\\" featurette;   Theatrical trailer;   TV spots [English & Spanish];   Music videos;   Still gallery;   \\"The Art of Making the Movie\\" with commentary by Robert Rodriguez and Greg Nicotero;   Deleted scenes and alternate takes;   On the set;   Cast & crew bios;   \\"Full-Tilt Boogie\\" full-length feature film;   Motion menus;   French-language track, 2.0 Dolby Surround; Spanish subtitles; 5.1 Surround;   Widescreen [1.85:1]    While I HAVE NOT seen this version but do plan on purchasing it, I did look up what is ON this version that makes it worthwhile.  For those of us / you who enjoy the BONUS FEATURES, especially commentary tracks, this looks to be a great addition to an already fun, gory, hilarious \\"B+\\" vampire movie.    And, oh,yeah, it's worth watching just for Salma Hayek doing her \\"snake dance\\" - SHE is a WOMAN with curves in ALL the right places, not a \\"runway model\\" with a stick body.     Hope this helps!
B001NLL8LA|4.0|Gone Tomorrow is one of the better Jack Reacher books. It is not massively exciting nor memorable but it is better written than some-to-many of Child's other works. If you enjoy reading Lee Child, this one is one of the better ones but as a former New Yorker, I may be swayed by nostalgia.     Pros: Good pacing, good writing, Reacher is not portrayed as a super-hero and there is less anti-US sentiment in this book compared with some of the others. Ex soldiers are not stereo-typed strictly as heroes or villians. Some interesting trivia. The subway surfing was a fun story element.      Cons: Ultimately forgettable and unexciting. No character development.     Recommended!

B001R0KH3M|5.0|For the past 5 years that I have been resident in New Zealand, since relocating from South Africa, I have searched high and low, all over the country, in every music bar, but to no avail!  Absolutely no Stevie Wonder music/DVDs! At the end of last year, I visited Melbourne, Australia, and it was the same story.  Not too long ago, a mate of mine invited me for a DVD evening.  He surprised me with his recently purchased Stevie Wonder; Live at Last DVD.  Man, was I envious!  I had to have my own one, and on his recommendation, I too purchased via Amazon. This DVD is now my pride and joy out of my large collection of music DVDs.  It is highly recommended, directed by Stevie himself, with about 20 songs on the DVD.  Truly value for money!  It was every penny well spent!  I assure you, you will not be disappointed!  Buy it now before there is a price increase!

031606792X|4.0|I am a huge twilight series fan, and I have to admit the first time I read this book I was so disappointed. I just felt like it did not belong with the other three books. So recently I decided to read the series over again, looking for something to read that I knew I enjoyed but did not take a whole lot of concentration, just something to escape with. When I got to the fourth book, I decided to try it again even though I knew it was hard for me to get through the first time. So I was surprised at how much I liked it the second time. I think maybe because I knew what was coming and I had a different attitude. I think, being a fan of vampire books and stories, I just decided to look at it differently. Ms. Meyer apparently had a whole world of vampire stories in her head she wanted to tell, and it may have been difficult for some readers that were expecting something different concerning Edward and Bella. I put that aside and just enjoyed the story for what it is....I am having a hard time explaining what I mean, but I really enjoyed this the second time, way more than I did the first.   I also recently read about Midnight Sun, I had heard something about that and really did not pay much attention. It is too bad that will never be finished, I read what I could on line from Ms. Meyer's page, and I thought it would make a great book. I thought it would be a great addition to the whole twilight library. Oh well......
B001PPLIEG|5.0|I know that arguing Bond flicks can often be like debating Red Sox vs. Yankees so I will toss down the gauntlet and say Quantum of Solace is one of the top non-Connery films. Daniel Craig is excellent as Bond and he does it in such a fashion as to appear that, much like Connery, being a spy can get in the way of his excellent taste and social life.     That being said, Craig does an excellent job in smoldering from his previous mission and this film has a plot which may not be believable but then again, it maybe in the near future. Let's be honest, no one watches Bond films to learn about the world. Once again the stunts are amazing and incredible. There are elements, like in every Bond film, which are laughably bad but the emphasis is on laughable.     I haven't seen every Bond film but I can say with certainty that this one beats all of the Roger Moore and Timothy Dalton films put together. I only wish they would bring back John Cleese! :)

If this is more of what Austin produces, I'm jealous!  Solidly great rockin' sound.
B00111YM5G|5.0|I cant see how people bash this movie. It took alot of testicular fortitude to make a movie dealing with religion but turning it upside down.  The people who didnt like this film are probably the same kind of people who wont watch a movie if it is black and white or doesnt have a big name leading actor/actress. This film is not set up for the typical american film that is set up for a person with an attention span that is measured in nano seconds. At times it was hard to follow but i personally believe it adds to the overall affect when everything does click together.    I will admit i am biased in the fact that i have had an affinity toward the mythology associated with angels since i read \\"paradis lost\\".  taking that out of the picture, everyone should have some affiliation with angels.  All in all,it is a movie that i would recommend to anyone with an open mind toward movies.
1592332803|2.0|I've made a couple of recipes out of this book and each and every one was a disappointment-- they weren't flavorful and the textures were terribly spongey/rubbery.  These recipes make new vegans feel doomed that they'll forever be eating flat, dense cakes.  Not true though!  The Vegan Cupcakes Take Over the World cookbook is awesome and makes perfect, flavorful cakes.  I wouldn't suggest buying this book at all, because as I mentioned, there are better books out there!

0385340575|5.0|I finished reading this book in two days, I could not put it down. First of all, I do want to say I bought it for my Kindle, I know it was higher priced than usual Kindle books, I have noticed the prices going up. For Lee Child, I am willing to pay that price, there are only a few I would do that for. I like my Kindle for the fact I can buy new books at a lower price. Still, I do not live near a book store with any kind of discounts, so all in all I felt the need to read the Lee Child more than the need to wait for it to come by UPS from Amazon.  Now that said, I am thrilled with this book. I did not love the last Jack Reacher book , I was disappointed, I had loved all the ones earlier. So let me just say, yippee. It was a book I could not put down, which was a problem since I had company for the holiday weekend.  The story was great, I could not figure out what was going on, who was good, who was bad....(although a little graphic on the torture scene, I had to speed through that), all in all, a welcome addition to the Jack Reacher library.

B001FB4W02|5.0|As a fan of Smallville since day one and as a fan of Superman since 1959, I am pleased that Tom Welling is Clark Kent. However, he deserves to be not only the small screens Clark Kent but also the big screens \\"Superman\\". For some reason Warner Brothers can't seem to see that Tom Welling can say more with his facial expressions than most actors say with their whole acting abilities. You actually feel his surprise, joy, pain and loneliness by just looking into his eyes.<br /><br />  This series is wonderful. They have played with the DC comic line but mostly in good ways. If they would have been completely in line with the comics, Lana would marry Pete Ross. Clark's parents would have been much older. Clark would be flying instead of running at super-speed. He would have telescopic vision. The Fortress of Solitude would be in the side of an ice-berg and he would have to open the door with a giant golden key. The Martian Man-Hunter would be green. There would be many more differences. I admit that the majority of changes are done well.<br /><br />  Season eight is a good season with some story changing additions, especially with the two who die at the end of the season. Neither follow the comic book, at least in the way one died and the fact that the other died at all. I enjoyed this season as I have every season and I will buy this season on Blu-Ray to add to my collection. I only wish that the CW Network would broadcast their shows in HD in our area. The only way we can watch it in High Def is to buy the Blu-Ray DVD or wait for it to come to HD Net.<br /><br />  If you like the Superman Story then buy this season. I am sure you will enjoy it. I'm afraid that with CW moving Smallville to Friday night this coming season that it will be the \\"KISS OF DEATH\\" to the series. It will be sad to see the show end and it will be sadly missed once it is gone. Thanks to all the great actors of SMALLVILLE and keep up the good work as long as they keep you on the air.  Lt. Robert T. Jeffcoat, Sr.
1439138311|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book although it was kind of Maeve Binchy material at the end.  How Toibin, an open gay man, can write so lovingly and accurately about a young woman is a mystery.  The description of her development and growth after she comes to Brooklyn was so lovely I didnt want it to end.  The Irish priest in America was also amazing in his happy generosity.  Guess he was overjoyed that he did not have to live in Ireland anymore but still could have his countrymen around him.    Toibin does not like Ireland; especially Irish mothers.  His Blackwater Lightship had a distant mother in it  and so does this book.  Eilis' experiences after she returns to the town in Ireland that Toibin is from where she grew up, are unpleasant but seem to be normal average Irish experiences.  Its kind of a brilliant book:  a social commentary.
B001NERPHS|5.0|This offhand masterpiece of downhome rock 'n' roll has greatly benefitted by the remastering which really brings out the Band's musical accompaniment.  Highly recommended.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|... in my experience.  owning a blu-ray player (Panasonic DMP-BD80) but not having an HD-DVD player makes me hesitant to say this, but there it is.<br /><br />saw this twice in the theaters, and owned two copies on DVD, this blu-ray shows better detail throughout the movie, although not a lot of 3D pop.  the HD audio is better, but still comparable to the DVD.<br /><br />with the Firefly blu-ray set, this makes for wonderful HD entertainment.
1416914285|5.0|I am reviewing this book as a part of the trilogy, I just finished the third in this series, but I wanted to review this book because to enjoy the others, you have to read them in order.   I am not a young adult, far from it, but this book is listed in the young adult category. I enjoy fantasy and urban fantasy novels, and I kept reading good reviews for this series so I thought I would give it a try. I absolutely adored it. It was fun, great characters, and each book got better. The action was non stop, the new things being introduced book after book, non-stop. There was romance, suspense, action, emotion filled story lines, just a fun read.
B00005R62N|5.0|What I loved about this release is the bonus tracks, they really give you a better idea of JP's live show.   I cranked up the volume in my car and love it!
B0018CWEZ8|5.0|The fourth season in Lost saw the series taking a different turn with the directors replacing flashbacks with flash forwards of the lives of certain castaways living their lives after having finally left the island. It was also added in a different bit of variety with the interactions between the people on the island and those on the freighter. Many plot twists abound the watcher and blu-ray makes the show even better with all the action in 1080 and full hd surround sound. An awesome package for a great price, definitely a must have gift for any Lost fan that owns a blu-ray compatible device.
0345350499|3.0|I couldn't put the book down, so I'll give it that... very engaging, but I grew frustrated with the constant dashed hopes and cruel perspective on human nature. The somewhat catty internal dialogue of the women also was irritating. Guess in a fantasy novel I'm looking for more heroism and less selfishness. This book provided a unique perspective, but left me wishing at least one of the women would have triumphed both in their quests and in their hearts.
B000OZ2CZW|5.0|I never get tired of listening to this CD, best of all I like all of her songs. This was definately a great buy.
0694003611|5.0|I still remember the feeling I had the first time I read this book to my daughter. She was 2 1/2 at the time. Captivated and excited, she wanted to read it over and over again. There is something about this book that keeps kids interested. I didn't see what the big deal was about the book, which is why I waited till she was over 2 before finally buying the book. I should have bought it sooner.
B001UREJWM|4.0|Is unbelievable how good they sound after all these years. I didn't give them 5 stars because some of the songs are  a little \\"sound alike\\".  Overall, very nice.
B00008DDRX|5.0|Who doesn't like Steve McQueen, right?  Even if you don't like Steve McQueen and love endurance racing you'll find something to love in this movie.  I ran across a reference to this movie by accident and took a chance buying it unseen.  I was very pleased.  The movie is more like a documentary of endurance racing at LeMans than a movie.  Natural action!  If you love endurance racing I think you'll love this movie.
0385340575|3.0|I thought we were discussing Lee Child's book, not Amazon's Kindle pricing policies. The 1-2 star reviews seem to reflect anger at Amazon's supposed bait-and-switch $9.99 Kindle offer, not the quality of \\"Gone Tomorrow.\\"     As for me, a fun, zippy read, like a graphic novel without the graphics. Lee Child is, simply, an incredible action writer. GENERAL COMMENT ABOUT THE CONCLUSION TO FOLLOW: Still, I was hugely annoyed that the identity of the propulsive force that had the characters shooting, stabbing, burning, punching, bludgeoning each other was left unresolved. Ah, well, does it really matter...? YES! Was Lee Child simply too tired? lazy?
0743201140|5.0|This is a low cost alternative to spending 2K plus on a 3 day Gallup course. I have used it at several companies with great success. At the very least, it is great for team building.    I have bought copies for both my son's to help them focus on what to do when they leave college.
B001ILHY1I|4.0|Statham will blindly accept ANY script shoved into his scowling face. History shows this. In fact, he is so without a filter for quality projects that I find myself doubting that he even has an agent. Gladly, though, there are some pleasant surprises that occasionally rise to the top from amongst the stinkers. This here is one of them. So if you can violently suspend your disbelief enough to buy Tyrese as a tough guy, then check out Death Race. Please don't let the name Paul W. S. Anderson scare you away if you have been burned before by one of his prior cinematic gems. This movie is just pure fun. Don't ask yourself why Joan Allen is in it. There are no answers for you here. Just enjoy the races, the death scenes, the crazy RV \\"boss battle\\" and (for the ladies) the obligatory Statham shirtless pull-ups. The movie is essentially the Twisted Metal videogame series put on film, complete with power-ups that the drivers race over, Mario Kart style, to activate offensive or defensive bonuses. I went in with zero expectations and came out satisfied. Check it out. If you don't like this movie then you hate fun.
0316743305|5.0|The internet is amazing. Found an older book in great shape at an even greater price with excellent customer service.
B001SN83KC|5.0|Enough people have written reviews about the book itself, so I will not repeat their opinions except to say that it was fabulous!!! I just ordered the second book in the trilogy too.    My motivation for writing a review is that another reviewer commented that the Kindle version is flawed with a black page for the last page. I downloaded the book tonight and the current version seems to be fine. The last page is very dark and almost unreadable - but it is the back cover of the book, not the last page of the text. So fear not and order the Kindle version if that's what was holding you back!
1439138311|5.0|In the immigrant novel there are certain expected devices, and going back and forth is not usually one of them. Not when they are set in the 50's anyway. In this tale the immigrant, a young Irish woman, Eilis Lacey, does go back, and forth. Living out other people's dreams for her, the disjointed nature of Eilis's life is painfully felt both in both places.<br /><br />She has beaux in America and Ireland, and while much of the plot involves  her relationships with these men, I found her relationship to her own life more interesting, her inability to claim authority and responsibility for her own life from the church, the mother, the charming older sister. She allowed herself, her desires, and her place on earth to be perpetually defined by others.<br /><br />I found myself shouting at the book toward the end, I was so upset with Eilis's lack of willingness to disrupt the flow of events... it rarely happens that I find myself irritated with a character to the point of yelling at a book. Hence the 5 stars; any book that gets me raving is doing its job.<br /><br />Having been married to an Irish person I know how strong and overbearing social pressure and expectation can be. I am glad that the life I lead avoids much of it, but this novel gave me some empathy for those who live under it.
031606792X|5.0|Good book, but I was sad to see it end.  I really hope she srites the fifth book tot he saga.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This video is a total of 27 minutes for the warm-up, 3 circuits, and cool down.  So quick and easy with 3 levels of difficulty and all you need is hand weights and a mat.  I would highly recommend it to someone who is looking for a fast alternative to spending time driving to the gym and back!
B001IAOEXU|5.0|I never really noticed that the slighted R2 and L2 buttons of the Dual Shock for PS3 were causing me problems but my driving and shooting skills have increased dramatically since I clicked these little wonders on.<br />If you spend ANY amount of time laying into the trigger or gas button on your PS3 these are absolutely essential.  A bit overpackaged but they do the trick and stay on well.  Get a set for each controller you will want them.
B001AVEJ1Y|4.0|James Kirk (Pine) is a talented but undisciplined young man.  Captain Christopher Pike (Greenwood) sees potential in him and challenges him to be greater than his father, a man who saved many in a deadly attack against a ship he was temporarily captaining.  When an emergency mission calls upon the U.S.S. Enterprise, Kirk is there along with First Officer Spock (Quinto), Doctor Leonard \\"Bones\\" McCoy (Urban), Communications Officer Uhura (Saldana), and Navigators Sulu (Cho) and Chekov (Yelchin).  The only one missing is Scotty (Pegg), who they will pick up along the way.  They have to stop Nero (Bana) and his ship from the future from changing the past, but things don't go as planned, and soon the future is in question.<br />\\"Star Trek\\" is both a re-imagining and a reboot.  The look and feel of the film is like nothing ever seen before in a \\"Star Trek\\" television show or movie.  That is due to director J.J. Abrams, who really does bring things up to date.  Also, there is a ton of action.  The storyline reboots things for future movies as well.  The cast is all well chosen, echoing the original actors without imitating them.  As far as movies go, this is a fun, summer movie.  For die hard \\"Star Trek\\" fans though, there may be some grumbling.  Some might argue that there is too much action and too little thought throughout the film.  Most will have an issue with the reboot that manages to essentially erase everything ever presented on television or in the movies, and provide a weak excuse.  Unlike every other time the timeline is disrupted, this time they don't feel the need to fix it.  Still, \\"Star Trek\\" brings a lot to the table, and will no doubt bring in a lot of new fans.  This is worth checking out.
B0018RWD6S|5.0|These melodies rendered by the fabulous talents of their era make for sounds that touch the heart.

B001N26GFM|5.0|A really enjoyed this movie. Sadly, I thought the ending was wonderful as well. Proof that we are punished for our sins. Even if we never hurt someone, we hurt them but not helping them. Wonderful movie.

B00009RDGA|5.0|What a classic. The writing. The acting. The photography. The stark Kansas landscape. The music. It all comes together in this funny and poignant tale of a con artist and his unwanted traveling companion, set during the depths of the Depression. The fact that Tatum and Ryan O'Neal are daughter-father in real life adds a layer of authenticity to the film. Tatum won an Oscar for her performance, but Madeline Kahn nearly steals the movie as Trixie Delight. I have watched this movie at least 50 times since it was released, and I always find it thoroughly entertaining.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|This is a gorgeous collection. It's hard to know which is more glorious the sights or the sounds. The cooperation & technological expertise is wonderful. Music from the heart from all over the world. They're playing for change, PEACE, LOVE, international cooperation, human rights & it's a joy to witness!
0312944926|1.0|I really enjoyed DaVinci Code and Angels and Demons however as the title states, this book is horrible.  I don't need to restate what others have shared already - just do yourself a favor and move along, nothing to see here....
B001PPGAIA|4.0|Some may not like this film. Its very long (3 hours) and has the hints of the old epic movies of the 40s. Its very romantic and grand. It reminded me of The Mummy cuz it can be funny and charming. But it is so long and it felt like two movies tied into one. But very good.

B0018PH3L0|4.0|Lonesome Dove has a lot to offer, even for those who don't consider themselves a fan of the Western genre. But if you appreciate great acting, Robert Duvall's performance alone makes this worth the money. In fact, Duvall himself said that one the of the greatest moments of his career came during the scene where Jake Spoon is hanged. Incredible performance, one you'll never tire of watching.
0380001225|5.0|84, Charing Cross Road was shipped quickly; provider had described the condition of the book accurately, and I would purchase from them again.  The book is wonderful!  But I already knew that or I wouldn't have bought it. . . . .

0671027387|2.0|I started this book knowing it would not be as good as the Da Vinci Code or Angels & Demons, but determined to find out how much worse.  It didn't take long.  It starts out weak, then gets better in the middle as the intrigue over what the big discovery is grows, and then gets just downright silly at the conclusion.  But my biggest gripe is with the completely rediculous exageration of the Kiowa Warrior helicopter which he dubs \\"stealth gunship\\", \\"armored gunship\\", etc.<br />  As an Army Apache helicopter pilot, and having flown the OH-58 in flight school, I can say that his description is just silly.  The OH-58 Kiowa is a Bell 206 JetRanger.  If anyone has seen one, it is the smallest, lightest helicopter in the Army, and perhaps in any military.  It is underpowered and when carrying two pilots (it will carry no passengers) it can barely take off with 1 hellfire and a small pod of rockets OR a 50 cal machine gun. (NOT both)  And definitely not with the 15+ Hellfire missiles described in the book.  Shoot, the Apache can barely take off with 16 hellfire missiles and that is why we NEVER do it.<br />Also, the laser which guides the missile is NOT visible to the human eye.  It is not one of those silly hand held laser pointer types of laser.  I laughed throughout this book.
B0016Q2D5M|1.0|Among many of the smaller effects studios, projects like this come with hefty deadlines and a LOT of thankless work.  But for computer artist, it comes with one thing you could normally expect.  A paycheck.  And so, with a few months left on the project and a promise of a paycheck when the work was completed, scores of 3D artists toiled, sometimes 80 hours a week to get this movie done.  Their ultimate reward?  The studio shutting down and the people who financed this movie refused to pay the artists their earned wages.    Frankly, I don't know if this movie is good or bad but one thing is for certain, the hard working artists who contributed to this film have gone without payment for over a year.  For this reason, the movie is a failure.  You CANNOT create an effects driven movie and then refuse to pay the artists responsible.  Even Brendon Frasier joined the artists cause to no avail.  Please do not support a company that refuses to pay their artists.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|This is the film with the classic song \\"When you wish upon a star\\".  After watching this my 3 year old is now constantly looking out for the wishing star!

B001W63DX2|5.0|Ill keep this reveiw short and sweet.  This a great package. It really gives a great overveiw of the first leg of their tour (i say overveiw as there is obviously a lot to try and fit in). This is an absolutly enjoyable doco and the second disc with the full set (almost each song filmed from a different concert) really top this set off as an excellent dvd.    A must have in my opinion!
B001I1123O|5.0|Excellent book for freethinkers or those on the fence. Dawson's arguments are carefully crafted and eloquently persuasive. His analysis of scripture and stories of historical incidents within the church are fascinating.    Some of his opinions are a bit over the top, e.g. raising children in a religious environment is tantamount to child abuse. I think this is obviously extreme. Dawson possesses obvious hatred for the church. Although most freethinkers can agree that separation of church and state is essential, I'm not sure we all share Dawson's utter disdain for religion. Religion after all permeates human history and culture, for better or for worse.    I found it to be a great read; however, somewhat extreme at times.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a great workout video!  I was so sore the first few days.  If I would stick to it, I'm sure it would really work.  Plus, Jillian is actually a lot nicer in this video than she is on the show. :o)
B0014VPFTA|1.0|i don't like John Mayer.  And I'm being nice. please. overrated hype bull**** music.  I don't even see a comparison to the richness of so many other musicians in this genre.  His genre is produced pop DO NOT think for yourself creativity.  Funny thing, people buy it.  So much for the American music scene, as shallow as our culture allows.
1416550542|4.0|This is a fairly thick book and makes for great beach reading material! It weaves stories between the present and past, between Australia and England, bridging generations of women in the same family. At the end it all falls into place and has a satisfying ending-- even if it is tinged with a little sadness. The characters Nell and Cassandra are strong women -- survivors -- and it's easy to sympathize with them and be drawn into the stories of their lives. \\"The Authoress\\" is a mysterious character that drives you to turn the next page and find out more.     Despite the different characters and time periods, it's easy to keep up with and tie the pieces together. The writing is so descriptive that I have a clear picture in my head of the \\"forgotten garden\\" and the old apple tree still bearing fruit that The Authoress planted with her cousin Rose.
B00000583F|4.0|im drug free and i enjoy this record quite a bit..  killer riffs,awesome jaming parts,fun lyrics,good times.
B001RQ0SJO|5.0|If you were wondering, as I was, whether there would ever be another person even *remotely* like Bjork, Tori Amos or Kate Bush, in terms of integrity and sonic creativity, then wonder no more.     She's here.    Start with \\"Daniel\\". It's the most chart-friendly (though in today's barren chartscape, will probably be too lush for the 3-chord ears of many listeners).    If you like that, try \\"Glass\\" or \\"Pearl's Dream\\". The latter fair knocks my socks off. Sensational!    Thom Yorke is a fan, and Bat For Lashes supported Radiohead on tour a couple of years ago. Everybody should have taken heed.    Have a look at what Natasha is doing here - there's homage to her favourites - from Kate Bush to Dead Can Dance. But what she's created is still truly her own, and is utterly astonishing for it. Songs soar, dive and weave, and are never conventional - even Daniel has an unexpected and catchy chorus. Beauty and power abounds. Drums abound. And she's in control the whole way.    This is the record that makes you realize that most other recent newcomers to this genre, are such pretenders, coiffed by stylists and songwriters, and desperate to be on MTV. Even if she never makes another record like this, we can at least savour this moment.    I hope she never sells out, and continues to delve as deep and thoughtfully for inspiration as she has here. I would gladly wait 10 years for another album such as this.
044024367X|3.0|love Jack Reacher but these last two have been over the top with Child's politics over the war and liberties.  I hope Reacher comes back next year with less baggage.  Still love Reacher just not Lee Childs preaching against American politics.  Maybe Child should spend more time across the pond with Sharia law on the way.
055371452X|2.0|I am in the middle of Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series - I have been listening to them on CD during my daily commute.  The first two books were the unabridged versions read by Davina Porter - they were phenominally good and I couldn't wait for the 3rd book.  Unfortunately I couldn't seem to find the unabridged version - so I purchased the abridged version read by Geraldine ?.  I only listened a few minutes and decided my money was wasted.    The unabridged versions by Davina Porter hold your attention very easily.  She reads extremely well - great modulation, completely different character voices for men and women that stay the same throughout the series, and even her accents for different parts of the world are good (except the American - she can't seem to keep her voice that blunt).     The abridged versions by Geraldine ? were read too fast with almost no differentiation between character, accent or emotion.  It all became a blur and will quickly lose your attention - especially in the car.    The abridged versions fail to provide the rich detail that makes Diana Gabaldon's stories fascinating and engaging.  Don't buy any of them.    Go to the web site displaying Davina Porter's works - the Outlander series is extremely expensive - but you will be sure to get the quality you expect form Diana Gabaldon's books, consistancy, and want to listen to the series over and over again!
B001PJRAUS|5.0|Imagine a 21st century girl who switches places with Elizabeth Bennet in P&P and finds herself trying to make her way in early 19th century England with all of its proper manners. Amanda drops into the P&P story complete with the Bennet family and Bingley and Darcy. She is dismayed to discover that when she's entered into the mix instead of Elizabeth, nothing seems to be working out quite the way it does in the book. Because she knows the plot after having read it millions of times, she tries to fix things with disastrous results -- story lines get mixed up, people marry the wrong people, etc.<br />When Darcy turns out to be even more of a prig than she had imagined, she still can't stop herself from falling in love with him. There's a hilarious scene with Darcy emerging from a pond (at Amanda's request) with a wet shirt clinging to his chest that should make fans of the 1995 P&P movie giggle.<br />Another fun part of the story is how Elizabeth is taking to modern times complete with computer and iPod. After what she's seen, she has a hard time going back to her old life.<br />It's lots of tongue-in-cheek fun that I recommend for a long plane ride or a rainy afternoon.
B001JV5BIA|1.0|I absolutely hated this movie.  They spent way too much time on the rape scene almost as if they were glorifying it.  The only reason it gets 1 star is because of the ending, the only part I liked.

B001PU8N0I|5.0|From the first installment I was readily addicted. Andrew Davies does it again. A beautiful love story with an outstanding cast. I have yet to find an screenplay this man has done that doesn't meet with my approval. Claire Foy makes a moving debut and Matthew MacFayden was tremendous as Arthur. If you are looking for a downright moving, mysterious, romantic, and entertaining period drama you'll find it in Little Dorrit.
B00005JKMQ|3.0|ALI is nothing but a playful punch. Telling the tale of the boxer, Muhammad Ali, the movie goes through his life, starting with the early matches before his rise to fame and struggles with keeping himself in the boxing game after joining the Nation of Islam, to his name change from Cassius Clay to Muhammad Ali, simultaneous romantic relationships, and refusal to join the Vietnam War. Though the film is accurate in the portrayal of events and the character of Ali and even delves into aspects of racism not explored in other films, ALI seems to have no clear single point of view or message about the titular character.   Directed by Michael Mann, with Will Smith in the lead role, the movie starts off with Ali, then named Cassius Clay, training, followed by a match. Proceeding to cliche examples of African-American discrimination with shots of bus segregation and police targeting of blacks, the movie's development seems undirected indeed. Unexplained scenes of the Nation of Islam gathering and Malcolm X making speeches did not help in clearing up what was going on for the audience. It seems that this film had no direction from the get go.   Only after an hour into the movie, do we get a taste of what Mann was trying to communicate from the start. After an onslaught of story exposition and character establishment, story development finally started, if in the least of the name. Ali starts to receive consequences for his constant flirtation and multiple relationships with women, and  a backlash for his abrupt name change from Cassius Clay to Muhammad Ali. His valued relationships start to fall apart, as arguments begin and marriages are divorced. The public is shocked by his name change, and even his fellow boxers refuse to call him by his new name, which causes violence from the champ, as he wants to be acknowledged as Muhammad Ali from now on. That said, this development still presents no clear point. At first sight, one may feel that the writers are trying to show thatAli is an overly emotional man, and one who cannot control his actions. But with his management of his boxing game and schedule, and his ability to beat others in the ring with an unemotional, calculating, and orthodox boxing style, one could say otherwise. The multitude of contradicting messages in this film, make the filmmakers' message unclear and befuddled.  There are also many scenes of dialogue with Ali, in which he is shown to sport a cold and un-rash attitude, which make his character undeveloped and lacking of a certain perspective. Another example of trying to keep true to history, is Ali's boxing style. While there is accuracy in showing Smith fighting with an orthodox style, due to the mundane-ness of it, being strategically timed jabs that wear the opponent down over time, contrast to powerful punches all over the place, mainstream audiences may feel that Ali is less of a champion than he really is. This historical realism brings down the emotional response of the audience. The filmmakers try to put in too much of the \\"docu\\" in docudrama, and seem to have forgotten that they had to make this logical as a story. Despite the many different facets of personality in a person, due to the film being a story, they should have explored one main aspect of Ali's character, and shown how it has affected his life. Smith's portrayal of the character is true to the real Champ, but it's historical realism bogs down the story, as it is more difficult to explore Ali's emotional journey. The events portrayed in this movie may be accurate, as is the attitude and character of Ali, but they don't communicate anything as a story.   All in all, however, unless you're a fan of Will Smith, or are really interested in this period of time for blacks in America, you should not watch this film. The action scenes are boring, most of the time Ali's just talking and unrealistically flirting, and though it fleshes out some parts of the racism, it's not worth spending two and a half hours watching it for just that.
B001S2PT3M|4.0|In 2006, the American premium channel Showtime unveiled its latest television series \\"DEXTER\\".  The TV series is based on a novel titled \\"Darkly Dreaming Dexter\\" by Jeff Lindsay and was adapted into television by Executive Producer James Manos Jr. (\\"The Shield\\", \\"The Sopranos\\", \\"Apollo 11', etc.).<br /><br />For \\"DEXTER: THE SECOND SEASON\\" (which aired on Showtime back in Fall/Winter 2007), the Blu-ray splits all 12 episodes into three discs.  Here is a brief synopsis minus spoilers:<br /><br />DISC 1:<br /><br />  * EPISODE 13 - IT'S ALIVE! - After the events of the first season, Dexter goes after a dangerous murderer named Little Chino.

The series is actually quite colorful and a variety of colors utilized for its palette.<br /><br />Outdoor scenes are really nice and vibrant.  Warm colors showcasing that the series takes place in Miami.<br /><br />The  Blacks are a nice and clean black showing no major compression artificats.  Color pallets showcase reds and amber colors come out vibrantly and for a television series, picture quality is very nice. Of course, when it comes to \\"Dexter - The Second Season\\", you will see more attention to blacks, blues, reds and amber hues.  The colors fits just right with the dark nature of the series.<br /><br />If there is one thing that many television series suffer is a lot of noise during low-light scenes and there are some scenes on \\"DEXTER\\" that exhibit high-level noise.  \\"DEXTER - The Second Season\\" does feature a good amount of digital noise during those scenes (for example, in the final episode where Dexter is racing back in his car to the lakehouse, the noise surrounding the outdoor scene gets a bit ugly but fortunately those scenes are very short)  and that is due to the original source.<br /><br />Again, many television series tends to get a lot of noise during low light scenes and by no means does it detract.  The picture quality for \\"DEXTER- The Second Season\\" on HD is actually quite nice.<br /><br />While watching the series, I didn't detect any scratches, dust, white speckles or any major compression artifacts.  In a way, I was happy to see four episodes per disc instead of trying to put all 12 episodes on to two discs.  Thus giving more space for each episode.  Overall, I felt the picture quality was very good, not great but very good.<br /><br />As for audio, \\"DEXTER - The Second Season\\" is presented in English and Spanish Dolby TrueHD 5.1.  The series is of course more dialogue and thus more front channel driven.  The dialogue is quite crisp and clear and there is very good utilization of crowd ambiance and also rear surround usage.  I also detected several scenes that key into the low frequencies for the subwoofer which was nice to hear.<br /><br />Music is utilized well in creating a sense of doom or fear.  Audio quality for this television series was good.  It's not a series that utilizes a whole lot of action but with clear dialogue and a musical score that really sets up the scenes quite well, I was pretty satisfied with the soundtrack.  The final episode of \\"DEXTER\\" is where you will find a good utilization of sound with explosions and burning flames.<br /><br />As for subtitles, \\"DEXTER - The Second Season\\" features English SDH subtitles.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"DEXTER - The Second Series\\" is actually quite interesting as a few of the special features included on this Blu-ray disc are only for those who have  BD-Live enabled Blu-ray players.<br /><br />With most consumers purchasing budget priced Blu-ray players (that are not BD-Live enabled) at this time, to not include any major special features on the disc was bad planning.  There is no reason why a popular show such as \\"DEXTER\\" doesn't have a commentary or any special feature but only a remote control  game.  So, that was a bit disappointing.<br /><br />But if you do own a BD-Live enabled Blu-ray player, well the good news is that you can access several Showtime features.  Included on this disc are:<br /><br />  * Dexter: Tools of the Trade - A video game utilizing your Blu-ray remote control.<br />  * * The first 2 episodes of \\"UNITED STATES OF TARA\\" - For those with BD-Live enabled.<br />  * * \\"Blood Fountains\\" Featurette - For those with BD-Live enabled.<br />  * * Dark Defender Series - For those with BD-Live enabled.<br />  * * Podcasts - For those with BD-Live enabled.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />\\"DEXTER\\" really shined in its second season.  Where many popular shows that gain critical acclaim during their first year and then faced sophomore slumps, \\"DEXTER\\" was a series that actually gained more critical praise for its second year.<br /><br />In 2007, where many shows were shortened due to the WGA strike, \\"DEXTER\\" was fortunately completed and had its full 12-episode run on Showtime.<br /><br />I personally felt that \\"DEXTER\\" was much better with its second season compared to the original first season and definitely featured a more in depth, well-written plot and good utilization of all characters who did a great job with their characters.  And Michael C. Hall definitely gave a magnificent performance.<br /><br />But what is more interesting is how the second series really explores the psyche of Dexter and how his relationship with Rita and eventually his turbulent relationship with Lila becomes a threat.  Most of all, how Doakes and Lundy start to set him off on a path of paranoia and the impact his family or memories of his family have an impact on him.  Season 2 gives us an even greater opportunity tosee things through Dexter's mind.<br /><br />\\"DEXTER - THE SECOND SEASON\\" looks very good on Blu-ray and absolutely sounds great with its Dolby TrueHD lossless 5.1 audio track but where the Blu-ray suffers is in the extras department.  Why they chose to focus on BD-Live extras  and not include any commentary, featurettes, interviews, etc. is actually surprising and what could have been a magnificent release, gets docked a grade/point especially since many people who are taking advantage of Blu-ray are buying players that are budget friendly and are not BD-Live enabled.  That is the primary disappointment with this Blu-ray release.<br /><br />Despite the lack of any special features, I still give a thumbs up to \\"DEXTER - The Second Season\\".  \\"DEXTER\\" is an enjoyable, dark, compelling, well-written and well-acted series.  The second season takes the series to new heights and from episode 13 to the final episode 24, \\"DEXTER\\" was like a wild ride that refused to end quietly and ended quite literally with a bang.<br /><br />Granted, because of the subject matter of the show, this is not a type of show that is going to attract many viewers.  Watching a serial killer who gains pleasure over his victims by taping them to a gurney, knocks them out with a chemical but once they wake up, Dexter goes for the kill and makes sure they feel the pain.  And all the while he's doing it, with a smile in his face with enjoyment.  It is a sadistic series but its smartly written.  But it makes you wonder how many seasons of \\"DEXTER\\" can their be and how much longer can he get away with it?<br /><br />If you enjoyed the first season and have it on Blu-ray, there is no reason not to own the second season.  For those who have never seen the first season, the beginning episode (Episode 13) sets up the first season quite nicely.<br /><br />Overall, \\"DEXTER - The Second Season\\" is highly recommended!  But knocking down a star for the decision of going only BD-Live for special features!doesn't have a commentary or any special feature but only a remote control  game.

0385341008|5.0|I adore this book. It is such a charming and touching story, told with abundant warmth and humor, that from the moment you pick it up, you will be carried away by the lives of the characters. Set in the aftermath of WWII, primarily on the island of Guernsey in the English Channel, the story weaves details of the days and nights of the inhabitants during the German occupation, with the stirrings of life after war. If it sounds like this is a depressing book, it isn't. It is full of hope, laughter, humor and good will. You will be touched and left wishing this wonderful book wasn't over so soon.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|This is an excellent acount of what it took to gain the rights which all of us enjoy under our Constitution.  It should teach us to never take these rights for granted, particularly now when totalitarism is trying to take over all around the globe; where the rights of the individual are under attack, even in our own great country the United States of America.
B001VB8UAE|5.0|This DVD collection is truly wonderful. I have been waiting so long to see the 2006 concert on DVD, and it is finally here! :-) Not a big production tour like her last 2 concerts. Barbra seems to do a concert every 6 years, and this one is just her singing, which is always great. No interactive screens, or sets, or stories with dramatic 'lead ins'. The 2006 concert is wonderful, Babra's voice is getting tired, you can hear that. However, her musicality and timing and energy is getting better with age, she is now a very nice vintage! Ill Divo are great. It is the best blending of voices to have them sing with Barbra. Music of the night is beautiful, and I love their version of 'Evergreen'. I could watch this DVD many many more times.And of course it is lovely to have the 1994 concert DVD as well. I didn't have this one before. it is also quite flawless. The documentary on the 3rd disc is great. Putting It Together: The Making of the Broadway Album is  exquisite. Nice to see Sydney Pollack on there. her old friend, speaking lines on the opening track. The clip of her doing the duet with Ray Charles is also a timeless treasure. the other clips of her singing are also important for any fan to have in their collection.    I think Barbra gets tired doing these shows, but her voice is still in top shape. The only thing that was a little 'not right' was her confession about her junk food eating habits, saying that she ate all this crap food before the show, - doesn't give a great picture of her i must say. Also my initial feeling about having the dog come out and sit with her when she sang her final number was that it's a bit much! And then the dog started running away, and she kind of went after it, and almost forgot to keep singing the next line of the song... i thought she was about to dissapear down the stairs with it!!! Anyway, i can forgive her for that. Just seemed a little strange is all.   Buy this collection. It's a wonder!!      PS It's very interesting to see the little doco about he Streisand Foundation. I was very impressed with the things she does with donating money to causes all across America. Go Babs! :-)

0240810961|5.0|This thick, lavishly illustrated book is a bit intimidating -- at least, if drawing in a Disney classroom would probably feel that way. Working through the book is the next best thing to such a classroom. The lectures and illustrations explain concepts I've never seen anywhere else, and I've probably read every good book available on drawing cartoons.<br /><br />I'd recommend this book to anyone serious about improving drawing skill -- whether the goal is humorous drawing or fine art. It's really about making drawings look alive and full of meaning. Hard to beat that as a goal.<br /><br />The lectures and notes are from 20 years of Disney classes by Walt Stanchfield, who died in 2000. Blessings on editor Don Hahn, who gathered this material and made it available to us. This book is a \\"must have\\" for just about every artist.
B0008ENICU|5.0|Def a must see. First saw the Meg Ryan remake, then the play based on the original and then this original movie version, you have to see it, was a great movie!
0385341008|5.0|I loved this book.<br />It was both entertaining and informative. The way the characters were developed was unique, and the history became very real. The love stories were sensitive and touching. I am sorry that the author has passed away! I think I would have loved any other books she would have written. Her niece finishing it for her was a remarkable feat. You could tell the writing differences at the end and that made it interesting. I would and have recommended this book to many, many others. Our Book Club all enjoyed the book as much as I did.
0375826726|4.0|I loved the Eragon series. The first book was an introduction of Eragon and other characters. The second book focused on the battles and consequences of a bad ruler and Eragon's new abilities. The third book, Brisingr, gave conclusions of the battles of the second book. It was not a filler. All your answers about Katrina, Brom's past and Eragon's family history is answered in this book. It is true that Paulini focused more on other characters beside Eragon, but it helped readers understand the plot better. The only problem with the book was that Paulini made Eragon's task to win the war impossible. Eragon has so much burdens to carry that a victory would seem fake. Overall I enjoy the book.
B0000009NH|5.0|I had Ziggy Stardust and the 1990 greatest hits album ChangesBowie and figured that was all the David Bowie a person really needed. I was wrong. This album is different but I think it's the equal of Ziggy. It uses more prominent acoustic instruments, including Rick Wakeman's (later of Yes) brilliant piano playing and Mick Ronson's guitars. The lyrics are denser and more mysterious than anything else of Bowie's I've ever heard. \\"The Bewlay Brothers\\" and \\"Quicksand\\" are especially amazing. And as you probably know, the hits \\"Changes\\" and \\"Life On Mars?\\" are emotional and wonderful.    As with most Bowie albums, there are several choices as to what exact edition to buy. I am generally a bonus track fan and the Rykodisc version has four excellent ones. \\"Bombers\\", a hard rocking, time shifting song that seems to be about nuclear testing in the desert, is not available anywhere else I could find. The alternate version of \\"The Supermen\\" is very different from the master recording from the Man Who Sold The World album. The demo of \\"Quicksand\\" and the alternate mix of \\"The Bewlay Brothers\\" both reflect and shine a new light on the original versions. Also, this edition has a complete lyric sheet - a must for this CD.    So while it might be slightly quieter and have more dynamic range than the remastered edition that came out in 1999, I think the bonus tracks more than compensate for that. (I don't even think that's a bad thing in the first place.) So to sum up - If you like Bowie at all then yes, you DO need this album and you should get THIS edition.    (Here's a final tip: Always check with the seller when you buy used and make sure they have listed their product correctly or you could end up with the wrong edition!)
B00155GDXC|3.0|This book started out interesting, but went downhill as it went on. It had just enough to keep me reading rather than quit half way through, but overall I was disappointed. I kept expecting something to happen, but it never did.<br />A good book to read if you have some time to kill.
B0017HRCQU|4.0|As expected, the blu-ray version is fantastic! The add-on stuff, however, are not as good or plentiful as those in the DVD gift set package. It should have included those from the DVD gift set package plus more!!!
B002962RKE|5.0|What a find for a late-night viewing, while dealing with a bout of insomnia and feeling a bit down :)  Totally lifted my spirits!<br /><br />Loved it. Loved it. Loved it.<br /><br />Like \\"Chicken Soup for the Soul.\\"  Sure it's a bit cheesy and not without its glitches... still, I give 5 stars and can't wait to watch more :)<br /><br />I'm not crazy about the main female lead's character, the teacher who's obviously destined to be the main love interest (a bit too mousy and overdone) but heck, it's a pilot and there's plenty of room for development :)<br /><br />You'll find yourself grinning through most of this episode.  My full recommendation! :D<br /><br />Oh yeah, and as for the male lead: hubba hubba ;)
0767903862|5.0|Bill Bryson has the great ability to make the commonplace both interesting and hilarious. He makes Australia come alive, it's people, it's history, and it's many oddities, from echidnas to the \\"Giant Lobster.\\" It also takes a master to weave hilarious personal anecdotes with serious reflections. I found the section on the aborigines to be particularly moving. I've reach much of Bill Bryson's work, and I'd have to say that this is the best of the best.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This is a great set of DVDs, and the video quality of the blu-ray discs is awesome.  If you have seen the program on TV, the blu-ray discs are even more detailed and vivid.  Also, the chapter selection options are great and very easy to use.
B000IY03IM|1.0|I was eager to purchase this item cause I love Jaco Pastorius but I was unable to view it because it is not compatible with my dvd player system. Note: The advertisement didnot state any \\"REGION\\" on this dvd disc. I am very disapointed!
B001QOOCTE|5.0|I keep a personal \\"top 50\\" list on my computer that I update monthly. Yes, I am a music lover, so what?! My musical tastes range from before Sarah Vaughn through Nirvana, and all of that in between; I enjoy Joni Mitchell through Sister Hazel, again, before, in between, and beyond. Simply put, I love and appreciate musicians - those whom I have seen/would see in person; raw, live, and without studio \\"tweaking.\\" Yes, I know, this album was eventually produced with studio tweaking, but I have been lucky enough to see a few raw, live performances which they have given as a testament to their actual artistry, hard work, and abilities. Some things cannot be glossed over by studio - some things are just pure.

B001V7YWTQ|5.0|If their show in Houston on 6-24 is half as good as this 2 CD set, then I can't wait to go!! From the beginning it's clear the egos are checked at the door and Clapton & Winwood pull out all the stops. It's hot, it's comfortable, it's surprising and above all these...it's GOOD!! I bought the CD set and the DVD as well, and as I type this the dynamic duo (to borrow a phrase) are running thru Winwood's \\"Split Decision\\" with Steve on organ and Eric laying down some very tasty and somewhat understated guitar licks. The four song tribute, spaced over the 21 cuts, to Hendrix & Buddy Miles is the highlite of the set. Personally I love the cover of the 16 min Voodoo Chile from Electric Ladyland (always my fave track from that album), but \\"Them Changes\\" and \\"Little Wing\\" are top notch as well. The sound is warm but has that live feel (as it should). If I have any issue it's that Winwood's vocals are not always clear...not sure if that's his concert voice or the way it was miked or mixed...still a small concern overall. \\"Perly Queen\\" is a standout here as well and my favorite version yet...Clapton's guitar is full and throaty giving the song a fullness the orig. Traffic version lacked. I only wished they had included a version of \\"The Low Spark Of High-Heeled Boys\\"...believe it would have brought the house down! This is going to be in my CD/DVD player for daze to come. I highly recommend it!!
B001CD6FKS|5.0|I can't imagine a better flick to show off your Blu-Ray/HDTV rig than this one.  The Wachowski Bros. have succeeded in doing something at which many others have tried and failed: creating a live-action cartoon.  Which is not to say IN THE LEAST that this is a silly or kid-only film.  Despite the mega-doses of Matrix-esque flash and dash, this is a great family film that has some serious heart to it, and which I feel was horribly maligned by the critics and movie-goers who weren't ready for what they were going to see and either couldn't or wouldn't go with the flow.  But for ANYONE that ever geeked out to a Speed Racer cartoon at any age, you owe it to yourself to get this movie!<br /><br />Having seen it in IMAX twice, I was concerned that it wouldn't be as magical in a home video environment.  I needn't have worried, though my 58\\" HD plasma display didn't hurt things! ;)  The movie remains entirely absorbing and visually stunning as no other movie I've ever seen.  The hyperkinetic, color-saturated world of Speed Racer is utterly breathtaking and perfectly suited for Blu-Ray.  I'd really hate to see it any lesser format.  The Wachowskis have done again what they did in the Matrix trilogy: shown us things we've never before seen in a movie.  Ignore the uptight critics and the anti-hype.  Do yourself and your family a favor and pick this puppy up today!
B001TK3XO0|2.0|As I was reading this book, I kept asking myself, \\"what is the point of this book?\\" It's a dreary story of the poor choices Afghani women have in their lives. Dull, dull, dull.

0385340575|4.0|Having read all of Child's books to this point, I eagerly await each new release. With only a few exceptions, I've thoroughly enjoyed all of the Reacher books. Unfortunately, one of those exceptions was last year's Nothing To Lose, which I thought a complete disaster of a book, and not just the worst Reacher book yet, but just a bad book period; which was especially disappointing coming off a stretch of Child's best books, including One Shot, The Hard Way, and Bad Luck and Trouble. My hope was that Child would return to form with his next, and he has.    Gone Tomorrow starts simply enough: five passengers on a subway in the middle of the night, and Reacher suspects one is a terrorist looking to commit a suicide bombing (which makes little sense in a mostly deserted car). Things are not what they seem. They seldom are in a Reacher book, but this one takes particular pleasure in continually yanking the rug out from under both Reacher and the reader, as he races to figure out what the woman was really doing on the subway.    The book has the feeling of a season of 24, taking place over a short period of time, with double and triple crosses, lies within lies, and shadowy government operatives always popping up at the worst possible time. It's not a race against time story, but it certainly has the feel of it.    Gone Tomorrow doesn't rank up there with One Shot (which is still, for me, the best Reacher book), but I'd put it alongside Killing Floor and Persuader. It's a solid entry in a (mostly) very good series. I can't imagine a Reacher fan being disappointed with this one.
B0009UC7QQ|5.0|The Truman Show is a wonderful study of human nature. Specifically the argument of nature v. nurture. We meet Truman and he grows up to be a good fellow. Seemingly unaware that the world in which he lives is all carefully orchestrated for the viewing pleasure of a worldwide audience. Truman goes about his life from birth to adulthood without noticing anything out of the ordinary...until one day he notices something. What he notics I cannot say without ruining the movie. Suffice it to say that Truman's life is never the same. I would reccomend this movie for anyone from 10 to 100. Younger audiences may take a minute to catch on,but should not be underestimated in their ability to be entertained and feel the humanity of the story.
B000TGJ80S|5.0|Francis Ford Coppola's film adaptation of Bram Stoker's horror masterpiece is a masterpiece in its own right, and as a film, there is nothing else like it.  From start to finish, one feels as if one is watching an erotic, albeit blood-soaked, dream resulting from a little too much wine.  One's head spins as the film's dazzling journey and storm sequences swim across the screen, filling one's eyes with too many Gothic images to count.  At the end of my first viewing of this film, I didn't know how to process it - the film is such a sensory experience that upon turning off my television, I felt as if I had awoken from a pleasurable yet horrific nightmare.  In some ways, the film has the same effect as that of an actual dream - you remember what it is about, but at the same time, like a dream, it presents so many different and conflicting emotions and settings that you cannot really remember the dream clearly at all, but you none the less know that you had it and cannot shake the way that it made you feel.  This Dracula has exactly such an effect on one's mind, making it absolutely necessary to watch it multiple times in order to fully appreciate it as not only an artistic triumph but also as an excellent example of sheer film making craft.    Coppola and his designers wisely decided to make everything in the film larger than life and slightly off-kilter, again reinforcing the notion of being asleep, or entranced just like one of Dracula's victims.  Even the Victorian costumes and sets are devoid of any gritty realism - one knows where and when the film is set, but there is no way that Victorian England looked so much like an illustration from a novel, but, this is of course to the film's great credit.  Also surprising are the film's rather old-fashioned special effects, especially Dracula's sneaky shadow, a homage to the silent Nosferatu film from the '20s.  There appears to be almost no use of the computer wizardry that has taken over the film industry in the past decade here, which makes the startling effects that much more real and frightening.    For a Gothic fairytale, however, the main performances are suprisingly genuine, infused with real human pathos and longing.  This is especially true of Gary Oldman's no-holes barred performance as the Count.  From the moment he appears onscreen in a ridiculous wig and a flowing red robe, Oldman gives what could very easily be a caricature real depth, choosing to underplay many of the character's grander speeches to make them seem real stream-of-consciousness confessions rather than speeches out of a Victorian novel.  This is greatly to Oldman's credit as an actor as his delivery perfectly counterbalances his larger-than-life costumes and makeup.  This Dracula may not have a physical heart that beats, but he undoubtedly has a spiritual heart and soul.  As Mina, the fair lady whom Dracula believes is the reincarnation of his long-dead wife, Winona Ryder actually gives what is a very convincing performance, filled with both desperate longing for something she shouldn't even admit she wants (namely sex) and a desire to remain faithful to the mores of her society (a character trait Ryder would play to marvelous effect the next year in Scorsese's The Age of Innocence for which she was nominated for an Oscar).  Many reviewers say that Mina is indeed the reincarnation of Dracula's beloved wife, but to be honest I think differently.  Mina's mind is being controlled by the Count, and for most of the film she is very much attempting to keep her sanity - as a victim with limited power, I think Mina would be willing to tell the Count as many lover's vows and declarations as he would want to hear, but, I digress.  Anthony Hopkins is wonderful as the half-crazed vampire slayer and doctor Van Helsing, artfully combining camp and realism to give what is a very finely crafted performance.  And, as Lucy Westenra, Sadie Frost gives us a Victorian maid plagued by what is essentially erotomania, her ravishment and fatal bite from Dracula seemingly stemming from her desire to be sexually liberated - her later convulsions and cries of pain during her subsequent \\"illness\\" closely mimicking those that accompany orgasm.  The smaller supporting players do fine, except for Keanu Reeves who is terrible as always, but his blandness works for the most part here: Jonathan doesn't understand what is happening to his dear wife Mina, so, Keanu' dazed look actually comes in handy, even though his line deliveries have about as much passion in them as a Hallmark card.      Coppola's film is not a film for everyone, especially for those who shy away from blood and bare breasts, but, the film is still a triumph of film making and is a must for fans of the horror genre, devotees of Bram Stoker's original novel, or film fanatics in general.
B0012OVEJO|5.0|En 1986 salieron a la luz muchos discos brillantes, conocidos por todos los amantes del metal, como somewhere in time de los DIOSES, pleasure to kill, reign in blood, fatal portrait, peace sells, master of puppets, awaken the guardian, etc. Pero tambi&eacute;n salieron otros discos no muy recordados pero geniales como epicus doominicus metallicus, energetic disassembly, the deluge y una obra maestra llamada Crimson glory.<br />Indudablemente es un disco que no debe faltar en tu colecci&oacute;n, en esta edici&oacute;n podemos contar con una canci&oacute;n extra.<br />Este disco es para mi uno de los grandes en la historia del Metal; desde Valhala, pasando por la increible Azrael y terminando (no en esta edici&oacute;n) con la narraci&oacute;n de Lost reflection.<br />si aun no lo tienes pues no sabes lo que te pierdes.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|Love it, love it, love it!  This is a masterful piece of work.  I saw Leonard Cohen's concert here in San Diego, which is pretty much the same as the one performed in London.  Had been looking forward to getting it on CD.  The concert is spectacular.  The choice of songs is superb.  His joshing with the audience is fun. Incredibly, Cohen's voice is in great shape and, with the female singers who back him up, every song is a gem.  You won't be disappointed in buying this CD.
006085880X|3.0|If you are looking for a happy ending; don't buy this book. It was a pretty dark story, but the author keeps things moving and interesting throughout the novel.
0571202284|5.0|In The Animator's Survival Kit, Richard Williams shares valuable information that he has gleaned during his many years of working in animation. He explains how to achieve the motion you want in your animation with drawings that show a character's movement frame by frame. These are details that other books on animation just gloss over and leave you to learn on your own through trial and error. He delves into various ways to express real personality in your characters with nuances of movement and facial expressions. He is an amazingly talented animator who learned from the greats in the industry, and his insight into the great animators and animation companies with whom he has worked is fascinating. I'd recommend this book to anyone who is seriously interested in character animation.
B000WQ9UA8|3.0|Having been a huge fan of Britney's earlier album releases, and hearing Gimme More on the radio and falling in love with it, I immediately went and bought her new album Blackout. I've only listened to it a few times, if not once, because I didn't like it much aside from the song Gimme More. I'd say the album bummed. It is not one of Britney's best efforts. She has done much better that this. I much prefer the earlier Britney, and others might agree with me on this. She tried to get back into the game and failed in my opinion when she released this album. Perhaps she rushed it and didn't think it through...Either way it doesn't put Britney in the high light and it is a bit disappointing cause I know she can do better.
0385474547|5.0|This book has definitely earned the right to be called a CLASSIC!  It gives the reader a good image of what it was like to be colonized by foreign powers that have no knowledge of the culture (and I'm using anthropology's definition of culture NOT the mainstream's definition) and have NO interest in learning of it.  Also shows how missionaries tend to negatively affect the culture and act as a neo-imperialist institution.  Still it's only a fictional account, but it DOES provide a valid POV of colonialism from the colonized people's POV.  Hopefully, people can make sense of my ramblings here. lol
B001HN69AE|1.0|Goku was supposed to be a little kid. Goku never went to school. Goku is really raw and does not know anything of city life. This movie was rushed. The storyline was very poor. The special effects were horrible. Nothing about this movie is good basically. Pathetic. Waste of money. HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO ANYONE! PERIOD!
0240810961|4.0|I guess I'm a little trigger happy when it comes to all things Disney. I knew this was an art book, but I was envisioning it as more of a history/art book. I thought it would be somewhat a mix between art lessons and discussions on the history of Disney art. I was wrong. If you skip the lesson portion of the books, there is nothing left. I wish I could give a better review, but I have absolutely no artistic talent. I was a kid who couldn't even make those hand turkeys look right. This makes it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of this book. The Stanchfield illustrations are beautiful and art in their own right, but if you are looking for a coffee table book or a light read, this is not the book for you.
B000001DYY|3.0|3 1/2    Elemental remains the sleek early 90's production job it initially sounded of, though can putter off on autopilot, while vocals grow increasingly grating, in its cheesier moments. Thankfully, TFF never leave entire songs stranded for too long, with mushy pace often subsided by broad electronic strokes to help clear the palate when needed.
B000HWZ4A2|3.0|Don't get me wrong, the movie is enjoyable but one must keep it in its proper historical perspective.  But the movie serves better as a supplement to the novel.

B001U0HBPG|2.0|I can't believe this movie was made by David Fincher. This is the guy who had directed 'Se7en' and 'Fight Club', two movies that are totally mind-bending and truly amazing. This movie is as confused as it can be. It tries to be a romance, a biography, a drama and perhaps a science fiction too, but sadly, succeeds at none. Many people are complaining that it's slow and long. That's still OK with me if the movie has something interesting or new to tell. It's really annoying to see it to be so 'Forrest Gump'-style and so pure sugary syrup. The idea of reverse aging could have been interesting if treated differently, but now when I think about the movie, it just makes me chuckle.    I stopped watching a hour and a half into the movie. I kind of knew what was in store and didn't want to regret wasting another hour and a half.    David Fincher, Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett -- it's sad to see so much talent go to waste.
B00002EPJH|5.0|'The Melody at Night, with you' is an excellent album, a real pleasure to listen to. I was attracted by all the positive reviews on that one, and i wasn't disappointed.   The title is a very good suggestion to the use you can make of this brilliant music. I didn't know Keith Jarrett before that album, and I have to admit that I felt in love with the smooth & brilliant piano.    No hesitations on this album if you like (and even if you don't!) smooth piano jazz.
0060531053|5.0|This book is an incredible reference for anyone who wishes to brew their own beer. It is informative, easy to read, and even entertaining. I am going to spoil it for you, though, by giving you the best single piece of advice in this book. Are you ready?    \\"Relax, don't worry, have a homebrew!\\"
0307266303|5.0|Read it and RUN!!!!I cannot remember the last time I have felt so simultaneously empowered, inspired and enlightened by a book.  Seriously, the story is compelling, fascinating and simply and amazing.  Just the information on the money we waste on expensive running shoes  alone is paradigm shifting and worth the cost of the book.  I am also really enjoying learning about Ultrarunning (why I have I never heard of this before?) and the Raramuri Indians of Mexico.  I am really loving this book, appreciate the author for writing it and think it could be made into a really inspirational, high quality film/documentary.
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|When I think of the Star Trek movie, I think of hot actors, cool special effects, and a some light comedy moments.  I think that Star Trek definitely lives up to the Star Trek francise and definitely appeals to the younger audience.  It has hot, young, and basically sexy actors who will make even the most hard-core Luke Skywalker fan drool uncontrollably.  The action is superb and I always was at the edge of my seat during any battle.  The sci-fi effects are very good compared to the trashy effects of the 1960 tv show which the movie is based off.   The comedy in the film is very light and I don't think that the film does a lot of comedic moments.  The film company heavily relies on action, adventure, and hot actors to pull the film through .   Although most Star Trek fans will probably be disappointed with the fact that their favorite actors are being replaced by younger, more modern actors.  They must not realize that the original actors are unable to do the stunts and nonstop labor of filming a sci-fi film.  Those fans should be happy that Leonard Nimoy even got a cameo in the film.  I mean what could anger those trekkies more than not having that 15 minute scene of the Starship Enterprise cast just sitting in a long room talking about galactic diplomacy in deep detail.  They must be irate with the cool special effects, galactic battles and the fact that you can actually understand what the Klingons are saying!   Unfortunaly during the film some moments didn't really make sense, like the whole Black hole thingy was confusing at the start but made sense during the end.  The Star Trek movie will definitely impress almost all of it's audience except those Trekkies who would rather watch two out of shape guys wearing bad makeup fighting in a real akward way. I give it 4 out of five stars with the one star off because of the fact that most Trekkies are upset with the fact that the Star Trek movie actually made sense.
B001AVEJ1Y|2.0|I saw this Star Trek movie last night. As a stand-alone it was a really good movie. As part of the Star Trek legacy it was horrible. I viewed it as a slap in the face of every fan of the original Star Trek and subsequent spin-offs. The movie is supposed to be a prequel. It's supposed to show us the origins of the characters, how they meet and how they come to be these iconic characters with whom so many of us nerds have grown-up and actually made us nerds.     It was hard enough for me to get over different actors playing these beloved characters from way before I was conceived. Ray Liotta and Mark-Paul Gossler's love child plays Kirk (as a ginger. Kirk's not a ginger. They might as well have had an Indian play him.), Harold plays Sulu (as a magical ninja), Charlie Bartlett plays Chekov and Shaun Of The Dead plays Scotty. I will say Karl Urban did a damn fine job as McCoy. It was obvious new actors had to portray the characters, so I tried to go in with an open mind and let the story take hold and follow the characters not the actors. The actors were all actually quite good and did not detract from my enjoyment of the film at all.    The story was good. The movie was fun and exciting. As a prequel to the original series it failed miserably. Instead of giving us a prequel and showing the actual origins of our beloved characters J.J. Abrams and writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman decided they wanted to give the Star Trek Universe a \\"reboot.\\" They used time travel to accomplish this \\"reboot.\\" It's this \\"reboot\\" that is a problem for me. Instead of giving us stories that shaped the characters and lead up to the original series they completely cop out and create a scenario that allows them to completely ignore the entire history of the franchise. Instead of creatively fitting their story into the over-all story they usurp the whole future with an alternate timeline cop out. J.J. Abrams in an interview with Memory Alpha admits he doesn't even \\"know and love the world of Star Trek.\\" He says, \\"...we wanted to make our own brand new thing, and at the same time embrace and honor what had come before.\\" So why the hell didn't they just do a sequel? They could have very easily created a post-Voyager crew to deal with new adventures. It was completely unnecessary to destroy the original characters and journeys in order to create new characters to go on new journeys.     It's been said that the flap of a butterfly's wing on another continent could have an effect one's life, that the slightest alteration to the past could have enormous affects on the present/future. They blew-up a planet, a very important planet in the Star Trek Universe, so now Kirk gets to be captain a few years earlier. Kirk is a ginger. The Enterprise is not the Enterprise internally, at all. Uhura sits on the left side of the captain's chair and is romantically involved with Spock. Actually all those changes happened before the destruction of Vulcan, save Kirk's accelerated promotion to captain.     They also abandon canon when they have Romulans, who look nothing like Romulans, go back in time and they are recognized as Romulans when Kirk is the first human to see Romulans in \\"Balance Of Terror,\\" which is set at least ten years after this encounter.     The timeline is all messed-up, too. This \\"red matter\\" (they couldn't come up with a better name for a substance of which a golf ball sized amount held the amount of power to destroy a planet) they use to destroy everything was, according to Star Trek: Countdown, a prequel comic book series to the prequel movie, red matter was created by the Vulcan Science Academy, which is on Vulcan. When the Romulans went back in time and destroyed Vulcan, the Vulcan Science Academy ceased to exist and therefore never created red matter thus voiding Spock's ability to create the initial black hole and young Spock's ability to destroy the Romulan ship with the red matter. Also, upon destruction of Vulcan and the loss of his mother theyoung Spock's character would have been dramatically altered and Spock would cease to exist, so ginger Kirk would not have met him on Delta Vega (which was moved in the movie so the writers would have a familiar name). Spock would not be in the past and his memories of the real timeline would not exist as the real timeline no longer exists.    George Lucas gave us a prequel, or three, you may remember. He made some faux pas and explained away something too simplistically (why the hell did Jimmy Smitts erase C3PO's memory? Why did Senator Palpatine just discontinue the droid army?) , but he rose up to the challenge and gave us a whole new nine hours of Star Wars to enjoy. Except for the remastered Anakin at the end of The Return Of The Jedi. That was lame. What if George Lucas wrote and directed Star Trek? Oh damn, nerdgasm.     As a movie I liked Star Trek. The actors were actually pretty good. I really don't care that Kirk was a ginger. He was actually more of a day-walker anyway. As a part of Star Trek it was horrible. It was a lame cop out way to do a \\"prequel\\". The writers just want to take these classic characters on their own adventures without having to follow the paths that have been set that lead these characters to their futures. So now the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise never goes all the places we've seen them boldly go and they are going to boldly go where they never went, thus voiding the original series, The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager, all ten movies, the animated series and countless books and graphic novels. It also virtually voids the entire canon. This is blasphemy. This is urination on the grave of Gene Roddenberry (figuratively, of course, as he was cremated and some of his ashes were launched into space) and all that he created. I'm shocked Majel had anything to do with this.
B00005JM02|5.0|I love Finding Nemo because of it's charm and overall good feeling after watching the movie.  It's characters are memorable and unforgettable.

B0013FNC38|5.0|[[ASIN:B0013FNC38 We Sing, We Dance, We Steal Things]]  is one of the best cds I have ever owned. I may be a little bias because Jason Mraz is my favorite artist but friends of mine truly enjoy this cd as much as I do. I fully recommend this cd to anyone!
0694016756|5.0|i had written a scathing review of Goodnight Moon, after i read the boardbook version at my niece's house. it really did not flow, and made no sense. i was so disappointed because i had heard so many good things about the book, and i love Margaret Wise Brown's other books. i decided to finally give it another chance when i found the Lap Edition in our library. it is wonderful! there was also a copy of the smaller boardbook so that i could compare and make sure i was not crazy! there are a few differences, but they make the difference to THIS reader. we bought a copy for our home, and it is our favorite book to read. and we do read it over and over. my daughter loves to point out the red balloon and the kittens.

B0019IB0II|4.0|My husband's best friend, at the age of 48, suffered a severe stroke. While he has made great strides in improvement in 4 yrs, his stroke is still apparant.  He has even read this book and recommends it.  This book helped me understand what he went through, and still goes through.  Though the content was excellent and ground breaking (from an insiders perspective who happens to study the brain), towards the last 1/4 of the book, I felt it was disorganized and repetitive.  I get it, she wants to get back to the state of \\"in the moment/nirvana\\".  I am even interested in the subject matter of spirituallity. But even I got a little impatient with the ongoingness.  I know I would have read this book even without my husband's friend's stroke.  I recommend this book on its content and on the merits of it's unique insights into stroke patients....and Jill is definitely a charismatic person.  I just think the writing fell apart a little toward the end.
0240810961|5.0|The late Walt Stanchfield presented \\"master classes\\" to budding Disney artists for 20 years, and this book is an exhaustive collection -- and it's only the first volume -- of his lectures and handouts, lovingly and meticulously edited by the highly accomplished Disney animation leader, Don Hahn. There is warmth and affection on almost every page.<br /><br />Despite the somewhat sparse, minimal design of its cover, this is not a dry textbook, though it can certainly stand alongside other great works on the subject. Stanchfield must have done something right, most of his students became the creators of some of the greatest animated films of the last several decades, featuring characters who have been embraced and beloved by the public.<br /><br />You can sit down and read this book and be completely entertained by the unpretentious, self-effacing style of its narrative, liberally sprinkled with Disney pencil art that reminds you how remarkably talented these artists are, as well as how masterful the work is in even the lesser-heralded Disney features such as The AristoCats and The Rescuers (you can even glimpse some art from the never-produced \\"Chanticleer.\\"<br /><br />Stanchfield shares his philosophies of life, how to stroll through experience and take it all in, hopefully if you are an artist, with a sketch pad. I have read several self help books less substantial than here.<br /><br />Walt Stanchfield must have been a neat person to know. At least this book gives an idea of what it was like.

020161622X|4.0|This is a great book that details good coding practices, techniques, as well as guidance to become the best programmer that you can be. Now following it and putting all that knowledge into practice is another thing--but once you do, you'll be ahead of the game. The book is non-language specific although there's tidbits of code that somehow explains the logic behind some concepts.<br /><br />The author explains in the beginning that this book doesn't go from chapter to chapter in successive order but you can rather jump around each one. Although this might be true once you finish the book, I still believe that each chapter builds up one after another. Each chapter provides insights and strategies that will solidify your programming structure and mindset. I found new knowledge that I've wished I knew right when I first started programming and techniques that I can apply to how I currently do things.<br /><br />I believe that beginners and more advanced programmers alike can equally benefit from this book, as well as project managers. The author presents mistakes and programming pitfalls that they've encountered throughout their career--and shows how to tactically avoid them. They also provide solutions to common mistakes as well as tips in order to keep up with new programming trends.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great refreshing reading as it introduces new and not-so-new concepts that programmers of any level can benefit from. It is also a good book to have in the book shelf in case you need to get a good refresher on the concepts later on. It's one of those books that I'd wish I've read before but at the same time, it's better late than never.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|TV keeps getting better - like an old Vampire - as long as they bring back True Blood.    One of the great things about a series is the story never seems to end.  I look forward to much more of these!    However, I just read a great, truly great vampire book, that scared the blood right out of me, a TRUE vampire story that I must recommend:    [[ASIN:1442134488 The House of the Vampire]]    Go for it!
B000F2C7TU|5.0|This is a truly great rock/blues album from Whitesnake.  David Coverdale is an amazing singer, and always has been even in Deep Purple.  This album has varity in a very good way but keeps rockin right till the end, I love this album. Whitesnake are a truly amazing rock/metal band and David Coverdale is one of the greatest singers of all time, would love to see him front Zeppelin or join with Jimmy Page for a project if Robert Plant doesen't want to.
B000H5U832|5.0|Pixar is really at the top of their game.  Cars is a unique animated film that highlights how the negative emotions such as greed and lust will ultimately lead to displeasure and misery in life.  It's a bit ironic that the film's main message is to avoid being materialistic, yet Disney is probably the most commercialized company on the planet.  Never mind that though, because this truly is a great movie.    The film has a wide range of celebrity voices.  It centers around a hot-rod race car that stumbles into a quaint suburban town on the verge of extinction.  Lightning McQueen condemns the residents and believes the town has nothing to offer him.  Of course, he learns the value of friendship, cooperation, and geniality in the end as they help him win his final big race.  The plot is predictable but it doesn't matter;  it's the journey along the way that is excellent.  The film is dripping with oddball characters.  The film has a lot of humor that is appropriate for all ages.      It's a sensational, albeit predictable, film that inevitably charms and dazzles everyone in the audience.
B001JFZ118|1.0|I first saw Highlander in 1986 when it was originally released. I don't remember what I was thinking, but I do know that I was twenty five and I loved it. So it was with a certain expectation that I decided to revisit this movie some two decades later. What a colossal disappointment! For the entire duration I found myself wondering: a) What did I ever see in this hash of bad writing and worse acting? b) When were we ever going to get to the part where the movie didn't suck? I never did find the answer to my first question, but the second question was finally resolved at the one hour, fifty six minute mark when at last the credits rolled. Christopher Lambert has got to be one of the most lifeless actors ever to lumber across the screen. My answering machine can deliver lines better than he can. Most offensive of all was the sword play. The fight scenes were embarrassingly bad. The sword fighting more closely resembled watching a couple of teenagers with sticks playing at being knights in their back yard than it looked like the work of trained sword masters who've had an eternity to perfect their craft. Seriously, I think I once saw the Three Stooges perform more realistic fight scenes. The one bright spot was Clancy Brown, who did a fantastic job as the evil Kurgan. His tongue in cheek portrayal of the malicious psychopath brought the only ray of light to this otherwise lifeless B movie.
B000O77SRC|5.0|The original Die Hard is a classic film that is required viewing for action junkies.  The story follows John McClain, a NY police officer visiting his wife in California for the holidays.  Their relationship is on the rocks and he is trying to smooth things over in time for Christmas.  But his marital affairs turn out to be the least of his worries as he soon discovers that European terrorists have hijacked the building.  As everyone is quarantined and held hostage in the lobby, McClain escapes their wrath and finds himself alone.  He knows what he must do and he uses his extensive skills (combined with a bit of luck and directorial favors) to rise to the challenge and neutralize the situation.      The film is very well crafted and contains something for everyone.  It is surprising just how well this film has held up over the years.  It's still a highly enjoyable, tense, action-packed thrill ride.  This film is a timeless masterpiece of the genre.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|When The X Files went off the air, I thought I would never find anything else to like as much as I did it. Supernatural fills that spot, hands down. It is my favorite series on television now and I'm always afraid it is going to be cancelled. Usually anything the least paranormal gets the kiss of death except for a select very few.<br /><br />This season the angels are brought in. This is where my problem comes in. As I said, I love Supernatural, but the angels are portrayed as beings as evil as the demons and God seems to be an uncaring deity. As a Christian, this bothers me. I keep hoping an explanation is forthcoming  and that the series isn't going to continue portraying God in this light.<br /><br />Without giving anything away, I just want to say I thought the last 2 episodes were awesome. I can't imagine what the next season is going to be like and just wished it would hurry up and get here. I also wonder what is going to happen to Sam and Dean's relationship. I love the brotherly love they share and just hope they continue to be there for each other. The brother I am partial to is really going to need moral support from the other.
B000O78KW4|4.0|Delivers fine action sequences and plenty of humor.  The main plot driving force is the enigmatic villain played by Jeremy Irons, who does a fantastic job as he dishes out riddle after riddle for the soon exasperated John McClain.  Samuel Jackson does a good job as the innocent passerby who gets caught up in the act and has to help McClain along the way.    If you want a smooth action flick that is fairly intelligent and funny, then you can't go wrong with Die Hard with a Vengeance.
1400067936|2.0|I love ideas that force you to examine old things in new ways.  And this book promises to offer a powerful such perspective: to endow you with a greater consciousness of the sea of randomness that surrounding the supposed determinism of life when viewed \\"in hindsight\\".  It even delivers on this promise to a slight extent.    What caused me to stop reading is that by and large the book read like a rambling mess.  A precious few insights bobbing in a sea of words and references I couldn't care less about.    Case in point: In the first two chapters, he makes reference to the concept of a \\"Monte Carlo engine\\" with which he models randomness-rich events.  He promises to explain what this engine is in Chapter 3.  However, while chapter 3 repeatedly claims it's just about to reveal what the Monte Carlo engine is, it only implies, it never explains.  In fact, most of the chapter just walks all over the place, sounding more like an endless, repetitive diatribe than anything else.    By the end of chapter 3 I was skipping pages, looking for the promised explanation of the Monte Carlo engine, which sounded fascinating in and of itself.  Supposedly he uses it to model organisms, cancer cells, and all kinds of things.  But I never found any substantive description of what it was, or how he uses it to achieve those results.  And so I skipped faster and faster until I realized it wasn't worth trying anymore.  I just didn't care to spend the work to separate the wheat from the abundant chaff.    I think he could have boiled his book down to something 1/4th the size, and with tremendous impact.  But I just didn't find it enjoyable in its current form.
B000VNMMR0|4.0|If you've seen any of the other Die Hard films, you understand the general premise related to the movies.  McClain is essentially an unstoppable force on a mission to destroy as many baddies as possible.      This film is no different, but provides a new and prevalent modern threat:  cyber-terrorism!  Hackers have infiltrated the bureaucracy and are doing their best to unravel the very fabric that our society is built upon:  computer networks.  Nothing is off-limits for these hackers -- traffic lights, financial records, television broadcasts, etc.  The goal is to initiate a \\"fire sale\\", which is basically a three step plan to cause complete and total anarchy among the public.      While this sounds preposterous, it's actually very cool because the threat seems very real and very scary due to our modern hyper-networked, computer dependent world.      This film is well-crafted and delivers an exciting ride, but goes a bit too far in terms of McClain being invincible.  Some things in the film were just a bit too outlandish to be taken seriously; even more-so than any of the past Die Hard films.  The problem was that this caused a discord between two important film elements.  On the one hand, you have this ultra-realistic and frightening threat of hackers dismantling society as we know it.  As an audience, we can connect with that nowadays.  On the other hand, we witness impossible scene after impossible scene in which McClain escapes near death again and again.  Most of the time, it was meant as humor in the first place.  And it works because this film borders on a comedy at times.  But certain scenes were not intended as comedy, yet they make us chuckle at just how preposterous they really are.  This isn't necessarily a flaw with the film.  If you've seen any of the past films, you know that they can be a bit outlandish.  You just have to suspend your disbelief and you are good to go.  The problem, as I stated earlier, was that the film oscillated between humor and seriousness during some of these preposterous scenes, and the differences caused a discord in which we could not really tell them apart at times.    Overall, it's a great film.  I enjoyed it immensely in the theater at the times of its release.  Lots and lots of humor and some over-the-top action.  I will revisit it soon.

0553807048|2.0|After Belfort's first disaster, he comes back with a continuation of his life after Stratton. I find the author to be very self indulgent, whether it's cheating in business or on his wives, abusing drugs and alcohol, or boasting about how much everything in his house costs. As the Feds close in, Belfort is offered a deal: rat on your friends for a reduced sentence. Jordan takes about ten minutes before quickly agreeing. Even though he is now faced with repaying the staggering sum of over $100 million in restitution, Jordan shows very little remorse for all the people he ripped off. Instead, he seems to whine over being supposedly singled out for something \\"everyone on Wall Street does\\". After being barred from the securities industry, Jordan enters an appropriate field: taking advantage of lower income people in the refinancing business.    For those who don't quite grasp what Jordan did, here is a little primer:    Stratton would seek to a company public; lets call it ABC. Stratton would look to raise 6 million dollars by selling 1 million shares at 6. (a lot of these deals were units with warrants attatched, but for the sake of simplicity I'm going to just call them shares. The concept is the same). Three to six months before going public, Stratton would structure a bridge loan to ABC for say $500,000. ABC might need this money to pay legal and accounting expenses. An investor (generally a friend of Jordan's) would put up the money in return for one million shares at $.50.  Six months later, ABC goes public. Stratton's brokers are selling it like crazy, promising investors that the stock is the next Microsoft and ready to go \\"TO DA MOON!\\" Lets say instead of selling clients one million shares, they sell them 2 million. Where did the extra million shares come from? Simple. Remember the bridge loan at fifty cents? Well Jordan would pay him two dollars for his stock. The investor makes a quick $1.50/share, or $1.5 million on a $500,000 investment. Not bad. Frequently, the investor would kick back some of these proceeds to Jordan.  Okay, lets go back to the first day of trading. Stratton has virtual total control over the float of the stock by not allowing a broker to sell unless he had a corresponding buy order. Thus, no stock would ever hit the rest of Wall Street. Because Stratton controls the market, they might open the stock up at say, 15.  Jordan then goes out to his sales force with a great deal: He will let them but one million shares at 11, and sell them to their clients at 15. The brokers will make $4/share, or over 25%! Why would Jordan offer them stock at 11? Because he took it from the bridge loan investor at 2. So Stratton makes $9/share on one million shares in it's trading acct, plus all the investment banking fees and any kickbacks as well. Remember, they only raised six million (minus fees) for the company. So, Jordan makes over 150% on the money he raised! Sooner or later, the stock collapses, and the investors are left holding stock worth pennies. Needless to say, this is all totally illegal.

B00004Z4SD|4.0|Here's a truly nice story with a moral about brotherly love.    This was especially \\"odd\\" because it wasn't the kind of film David Lynch had been putting out in the last 15 -20 years. Those were dark and shocking films (Blue Velvet, Wild At Heart, Mulholland Drive) and this is the opposite. I know it disappointed a lot of his fans. Others were delighted by it. Count me as one of the latter, and I own all three of those \\"dark\\" films, too.    This was another supposed-true life story, here detailing an elderly man's trip in a seated lawnmower from western Iowa all the way to Wisconsin to see his ailing brother who he hasn't talked to in years but wants to see before the latter dies. Richard Farnsworth plays the title role. He is the type of guy, face-wise, voice-wise, low-key personality-wise, that just about everyone likes.     I played this disc for several friends and they thought the film was way too slow, but I think it's a hidden gem filled with charm and uplifting messages.  I hope it comes out on Blu-Ray.
0553582445|5.0|I can see why people would complain that this story picks up slow, but Fitz is such a great character that I enjoyed hearing about his life every bit.     After the first few chapters there is no way that you could call it a slow book however. The pacing is perfect and the action is expertly interspersed with rich character development. The characters come to life in this story like they do in no other that I've read.    My only qualms are the extremely sad thing that happens near the end (don't want to spoil it) and the use of somewhat annoying vocabulary. For instance replacing \\"offer\\" with \\"proffer\\" throughout the book is just downright annoying. That being said, however, this is actually a pretty good SAT vocab book.    Plus, and here's what really moved me from 'thinking about buying the book' to 'definitely buying the book', George R.R. Martin is quoted as saying \\"Robin Hobb's books are diamonds in a sea of Zircons\\". So if you had any doubts, Martin's words should destroy them for you :p
B000AP04OM|4.0|For some reason, it took me over 30 years to finally watch this film, something I did in 1998....and I could see why this is such a beloved film.    The film is a throwback to something you might see in the 1930s or '40s - a super-nice, old-fashioned movie led by Julie Andrews, who probably never again looked as pretty and wholesome as she did here.She's a joy to watch. The kids are all nice, attractive and well-behaved, something else you don't see much anymore on film.     The film is nicely photographed, too, and I don't mean just the Austrian Alps. Was it perfect? No. I did think there were too many songs in here, some of them done twice. That's too much.  There were a few other things, but it's nit-picking. Overall, a film which lives up to its lofty reputation.

6305657947|4.0|I found this to be a pretty solid re-make of the Steve McQueen-Faye Dunaway film of the early '70s. Actually, a lot of people thought this version was a lot more interesting and entertaining.    This '99 re-make was more of a thinking man's crime movie that one normally sees these days in which violence and profanity are way overdone so many times. However, this movie is far from \\"family entertainment, \\" not with Rene Russo baring her breasts a few times, just to give one example.    Here's  too, another case of the film world making the criminals the good guy and the police as someone to root against.  Neither of the two leads has an ounce of integrity....but we are manipulated into rooting for them.    For nostalgia buffs, the let Dunaway play a small role in here, as a psychiatrist.
B00008BLAS|4.0|Grand Funk wasn't showing any signs of falling apart just yet- that would happen with their next album, All the Girls in the World Beware.     While nothing from the Shinin' On album comes close to the incredible power and rocking energy of the title song with its fantastic rhythm beats, I can't find anything to complain about either.      Hearing this album for the first time after hearing all the other Grand Funk albums released before this one, you'll probably be shocked by the way the album sounds and the direction Grand Funk chose to take their music.  This is pretty much an obvious attempt to go commercial, though not really a necessary one since they WERE pretty popular before this after all, and the band also probably wanted to fit in with the times.     Whatever the reason might be, this is a pretty good album.   Don't expect a whole lot in the way of excellent guitar solos, but expect a decent songwriting effort.
0061537934|4.0|I love Labradors and I love watching NASCAR.  I'm originally from the Seattle area.  I have children and grandchildren.  This book had a lot of details about things that I know and love to attract me to it.  The story is told from the point of view of a very smart and philosophical Labrador.  It is the story of a difficult time in the life of Denny and his family.  Denny is a race car driver who is struggling to establish himself in the world of racing.  This task is complicated when his young wife is stricken with a malignant brain tumor.  Denny and his wife have a young daughter and the maternal grandparents step in and try to take over the rearing of that child.  Life lessons are delivered to the reader in the form of racing analogies.
B0000028RR|5.0|Rage Against the Machine was considered one of the most offensive bands back in the day to true rock fans, because the band would combine a rap vocal style with heavy metal and make some of the most annoying music you could imagine.  Well, time has actually been a little bit nicer to this band compared to others, and I find myself not totally hating the music on here which is a BIG surprise because I thought I'd absolutely hate this album when I came back to it 10 years later.  The guitar riffs are somewhat more memorable to me than they were all those years ago, and while the vocals don't appeal to me at all, at least some of the lyrics are quite refreshing and I understand the point the band was trying to make.

1416941126|5.0|This book tells the story of a group of flower seeds, blowing into the air in Autumn, with one tiny seed among them.  As they journey through many dangerous places, different seeds succumb to death before finding a place to take root: one flies too close to the sun and is burned up, one lands on an icy mountain too cold to germinate it; another lands in the ocean, and so on, but the tiny seed moves on with the remaining seeds.  As they begin to fall to the fertile earth, a bird eats one.  During the winter a mouse eats another, but still the tiny seed survives.  Another seed, on sprouting, is stunted by the proximity a great weed, and another is picked by a child just when it blooms.  Finally only the smallest seed is left, and it sprouts to become the greatest of flowers, which lives through the summer and sheds its own seeds in Autumn.<br /><br />Readers who have experienced The Carrot Seed in their early reading will anticipate the future of this tiny seed, against all the obstacles arrayed against it.  And families that have heard Jesus' Parable of the Seeds will recognize in this book a full-fledged dramatization of the same principle Jesus illustrated.  In this story children will learn about the life cycle of a flower, see the least of a family become the greatest of flowers, and will experience Carl's distinctively beautiful collage-style of art.  This is a wonderful book on every level.

1400082773|5.0|Growing up, Barack has never been your typical \\"I want to grow up rich and famous\\" American. Through this book, one could see that at the center of his life lies his constant struggle to search for his identity, his attempts at reconciling the internal conflicts over who he is or where he belongs. Is he a African American? His father is from Kenya and yet he had only met his father once before his death, and has never been to Africa before graduating from college. What about the fact that he was raised in a white American family? Does this make it hypocritical for him to criticize how white Americans treat African Americans? Where does he draw the line, and which side does he belong to?    This book shows a glimpse into the life of a man burdened by questions with no definite answers, and the journeys he took in search of some way to put his internal struggles to rest. Definitely a must-read for all types of readers.
B00005YCQW|5.0|This is the 3rd time I've written this review,please tell me it isn't posted 3 times.  Any how, the iceman has fast shipping, good communication, and incredibely low prices-highly recommended seller. Now, onto Manassas. This vinyl is one I can say is playable from start to finish.  I like the country rock and latin rythms that Stephen Stills creates.  Not hard rock, not yawn folk rock, but just plain good music.  Hard to believe the guy's not more famous than he is.  If you like CSNY and don't know this record (like me when I bought it), take a chance and you'll be glad you did. I'm 35 and just getting into Mr. Stills thanks mostly to a couple of his buddies named Jimi Hendrix and Neil Young. What I'm discovering is some excellent music that still sounds fresh today.  Also, I got the Classic Records 200 gram version which has a full sound that allows the listener to hear every different instrument that went into this production unlike a CD that tends to focus on vocals and one or two guitars. I often listen to cd's and wonder what happened to the bass guitar and the background vocals, but they're both alive and well on this album. Also, the rice crispy trio (snap, crackle, & pop) do NOT make an appearance, which is good to hear.

0375842209|5.0|Don't expect an off into the sunset ending or a lot of twists and turns, but the characters and the imagery really sink their teeth in you and don't let go. There were times I just wanted to \\"pause\\" the story to relish these beautiful moments of humanity during such ugly times.  I also wanted to stop what I knew was probably going to happen from happening.     The characters are complex and interesting. I love that death is a sympathetic character / narrator who's afraid of humans. The seeming ease with the way Zusak whittles and plays with words is inspiring.     The circumstances, side stories, and characters really rang true for me as there were so many parallels with first-hand stories I've heard from that time period.  My father-in-law is from Germany and was a teen during the Nazi regime.  His tales of coping in the Nazi Youth, and evading capture from the Russians are captivating.  He actually escaped Russian capture and returned to Berlin to find his home destroyed.  Fortunately, after asking around, he learned that his family was safe.  As I was reading this book, I pictured him as Rudy, as he shares much of Rudy's energy and optimism.  I also stayed a summer in college with a beautiful woman from Britain who was in London during the war and the book brought back many of her stories of the bomb raids and the chaos of the war.      I love that Zusak writes for himself without worrying about what will be published, it creates a raw authenticity that I think has become more and more difficult to find.  It just feels so real and beautifully human.  As an aspiring writer, he's motivated me to find more time to put the pen to paper!  Zusak, thank you for opening yourself up in this way!
B000BRBA8S|3.0|This film had such high hopes when I first bought it, and while I do like it, it can be a very confusing film. It starts with a man (the main character and author of the book he entitles \\"2046\\") trying to get a beautiful woman (Gong Li) to come away with him if he wins at a card game. She ends up winning, and the game then comes to the present. The movie spends a good deal of it's time going between reality and the fictional world he's created, while dropping hints about the woman from the beginning until at the end and after a relationship with a prostitute (Ziyi Zang) we find out that the woman from the beginning is the only woman he'll ever want, and that's why he chose to write \\"2046\\". It could have been so much better but it has a tendency to drag and often switch without any good transition between past, present and the story. I often found myself confused when there were moments in which Japanese is spoken instead of Chinese. The acting isn't really the problem, it's how the story strives so hard to be deep and artsy at the same time and fails to achieve the right balance. I would definitely say check it out, but be warned, if you even blink you might miss a detail and be left behind.
B001EOQTME|2.0|I am a big Sabbath fan and I really like Sabbath's Heaven and Hell album.<br /><br />With that said I was very disappointed on the quality of this vinyl release.<br /><br />Compared to recent vinyl releases, Paranoid, Master of Reality, etc., the vinyl on this reissue is thin and not a 180 gram or audiophile quality vinyl. It looks more like a 1980's release and the cover is made with the thin carboard used in the last days of vinyl.<br /><br />The sound was slightly harsh and not worth the price of admission. Not a recommended purchase unless you are a completist or did not have the original vinyl release. Stick with the CD and save your money for something else.

B000CCD0FI|5.0|During the early 80's Talking Heads were one busy bunch of people;Tina and Chris had some success a year and a half earlier with their debut with [[ASIN:B000002KN3 Tom Tom Club]] while Jerry Harrison and David Byrne both recorded solo albums. The huge tour for [[ASIN:B000C3H4MC Remain in Light]] allowed for a band called the \\"expanded heads\\" to re-create live versions of the songs Eno and the Heads' fasioned in the studio;these included some very funky musicians such as keyboard/synthesizer players Wally Badarou and the one and only Bernie Worrell,along with the Brothers Johnson's Alex Weir on guitar and the percussionist Steve Scales. On this album it's back to the band themselves producting their own album;Eno is no longer involved with them at this point.And you can hear the difference. Here is where the band utilize their \\"expanded\\" touring band of largely funk-experienced musicians and created a winning,more commercially viable version of the rhythmic innovations of the previous album.And in that sense it payed off instantly with the smash \\"Burning Down The House\\"-THE ULTIMATE 80's song in the sense that it smashes any boundries of rock-based and funk-based new wave this side of the Minneapolis sound. Basically the Talking Heads have discovered \\"naked funk\\" here,as \\"Making Flippy Floppy\\",\\"Girlfriend Is Better\\",\\"I Get Wild/Wild Gravity\\",\\"Slippery People\\" and the heavy \\"Swamp\\" all lay down extended funk grooves with Alex and Chris every so often trying to replicate Adrien Belew's \\"zoo guitar\\" which,along with Bernie's trademark colorful bass synth effects make for some surprising results.\\"Moon Rocks\\" and \\"Pull Up The Roots\\" put more of a reggae spin on things which....well is pretty typical for the time.But this is Talking Heads we're talking about here;their talent lays in their ability to put their own unique trademark to even popular sounds of the day to sound fresh and different. The final song on the orginal album was...another hit of sorts.\\"This Must Be The Place (Naive Melody)\\" is one of the erriest funk/reggae tunes out there,with it's dreamy,high pitched synth notes it was the perfect intro to.....the debut episode of [[ASIN:B000LSAJ5M Northern Exposure - The Complete Sixth Season]],although you won't be able to hear it on the DVD version to to copywrite protection...I think.Either way it's an excellent song from this album.Rounding out this version of one of the finest naked funk recordings of 1983 are the excellent jam \\"Two Note Swivel\\",it says it's unfinished but it's sure pretty full sounding to me.The alternate take of \\"Burning Down The House\\" has a lot more of the electronics taken out to hear it more \\"in the process\\" then anything. This would prove to be the Talking Heads' last foray into funk for a number of years,as they would presue more rock-oriented pop directions in the future.But this would not be the official end.This marked the beginning of the \\"big suit\\" period for the band,as this albums tour as documented vividly on [[ASIN:B000021Y7X Stop Making Sense]] which kept the whole Talking Head's artistic and commercial expressway running full steam ahead until they made their next album.This Must Be The Place (Naive Melody)\\" is one of the erriest funk/reggae tunes out there,with it's dreamy,high pitched synth notes it was the perfect intro to.....the debut episode of [[ASIN:B000LSAJ5M Northern Exposure - The Complete Sixth Season]],although you won't be able to hear it on the DVD version to to copywrite protection...I think.Either way it's an excellent song from this album.Rounding out this version of one of the finest naked funk recordings of 1983 are the excellent jam \\"Two Note Swivel\\",it says it's unfinished but it's sure pretty full sounding to me.The alternate take of \\"Burning Down The House\\" has a lot more of the electronics taken out to hear it more \\"in the process\\" then anything.

B000C3H4MC|5.0|In the history of recorded music there are a long series of recordings that simply forever stand the test of time for one reason or another.Sometimes they're referred to as a bands \\"Sgt.Pepper\\",in reference to the famous Beatles album but if it influences and inspires the entire creative scene in music for decades to come.......it goes beyond that clished \\"classic\\" status.This would be one of those albums that fits easily into the latter. Throughout the 70's the genres of funk and disco had embraced the concept of African inspired percussion was used in different ways in music. But with the exception of a handfull  great funk bands such as Earth Wind & Fire and Mandrill not all of them completely realized the potential of this element in their music. During the late 70's [[ASIN:B000C3H4M2 Fear of Music]] sessions the Talking Heads and Eno began integrating the concepts of polymeter and the musical concept of \\"communalism\\" into their music. It had always been boiling over since the beginning of their work with Eno. On this one the door broke all the way open.The addition of new musicians actually helped out:especially Adrian Belew and Jon Hassell.Adrian's \\"zoo guitar\\" style,using his axe to crow,growl and snarl in a number of different ways created the impression of this great musical...safari.This is one of the first Talking Heads albums where the whole is more important then the parts:the cycle of songs (running in no particular order) from \\"Born Under Punches\\",\\"The Great Curve\\" and \\"Houses In Motion\\" in particular are this glossy,echoey,almost beyond modern electronic mix of percussive funk,avante garde new wave sounds and.....some things you just have to hear to believe.The greatest thing about this album is it isn't some self indulgence that alienates the listener;it is based on musical communalism and it invites you to join right in.The fact that most of the lyrics have to do with body parts,movement,conformity or just the sounds of life in general you cannot help but feeling welcomed by this album.\\"Crosseyed And Painless\\" is,flat out one of the funkiest thing the Heads' ever recorded,not to mention the fact it's funk/rock combination worked far better then I am sure even they expected.\\"Once In A Lifetime\\" is one place where everything that makes this album great comes together all in one,as David's self proclaimed \\"preacher song\\" questioning without resolution the things in life we value.The pure liquid thump of the song itself is really appropriate when the lyrical focus shifts to water.The most captivating song here is \\"Seen And Not Seen\\"-it reminds the funk fan listening to this record that one of the elements that made the best and most genuine funk recordings were the sound of being more like a ritual then a mere R&B/pop song with rhythm outfront.To a thumping beat David chants a lyric that speaks of all the false values people often put into their surface features (hello Michael Jackson?).\\"Listening Wind\\" keeps up a similar concept but there is more of a \\"techno drone\\" to that one,which of course goes in perfectly with the closing \\"The Overload\\",somewhat dirge-like in a way compared to the heavy rhythms of the rest of the album.On to the bonus cuts well....it's nothing BUT rhythm,from the NASTAY electronics on \\"Fela's Riff\\" to the heavy Afro-Funk of \\"Double Groove\\" these keep kicking out the jams,where \\"Unison\\" and \\"Right Start\\" contain the embryo of some of the regular albums most important songs. The most important thing about this album is that everything from the sound to the approch is comepletely ageless;to the point where,if you were to put this album on for me today and I didn't know who made it and when it was I would actually think it was brand new.When I first heard this album...some eight years ago in fact I have to admit it felt very...familiar to me to hear this music.I am sure many others will have the same experience with thi. Everyone today from Franz Ferdinand and every polyrhythmic,funk based rock outing one can think of owes itself to this album in some way. But the intermixing of ancient communal musical polyrhythm and modern electro funk still finds it's true flower on this thoroughly excellent collection of music.ic,funk based rock outing one can think of owes itself to this album in some way.

As she explains in her liner notes, the basis of these works is far from the eggheaded mathematics, and she finds the music elegant and memorable.<br /><br />Schoenberg's Piano Concerto (1942) shows, as many pieces of Alban Berg, just how rooted to traditional the Second Viennese School remained in spite of their atonal language. The language here is an only slightly distorted Romanticism of the Brahms and Mahler varieties: the rhythms in this piece, the phrases uttered by the orchestra and the soloist, and the four-movement structure moving from a happy-go-lucky life to disaster and then to some sort of resolution are all so early 19th century. In fact, this concerto is regularly presented to subscriber audiences in Europe because it fits in so well with Romantic warhorses. And if presented to a general audience in the company of some those warhorses, I suspect few would imagine there was serious controversy around Schoenberg's language.<br /><br />Alban Berg's \\"Piano Sonata\\" (1907-08) was the composer's opus number 1 and is still thoroughly late Romantic. Musicologists might point to bold steps towards atonality, but most listeners are just going to bask in a warmth inherited from the 19th century. Schoenberg's \\"Drei Klavierstuck\\" op. 11 (1909) sees the composer cautious treading from tonality to atonality. Rhythms and phrasing remain in his erstwhile expressionist vein, but in the first and second pieces one perceives a certain extra spikiness. In the third piece, Schoenberg has fully entered his free atonal style with a rapid flurry of anguished lines. The \\"Sechs kleine Klavierstucke\\" op. 19 of two years later are neatly crafted atonal miniatures, though as they were written over the course of one day they are more private musings then grand public proclamations. Anton Webern's \\"Variations for Piano\\" op. 27 (1936) is the true example of extreme modernism on the disc, three movements of pointilistic writing where each bleep and bloop is framed by pregnant silences.<br /><br />All in all this is a great introduction to the piano music of the Second Viennese School, showing how Schoenberg, Berg, and Webern were not complete radicals breaking with the past, but three craftsmen seeking to extend the tradition they inherited in a way they found meaningful.ue example of extreme modernism on the disc, three movements of pointilistic writing where each bleep and bloop is framed by pregnant silences.

0452286751|5.0|I decided to listen to this book (on audio recording) after listening to the Author's previous title:  Atlas Shrugged.      I thought that the story was even more interesting than her previous title, and I enjoyed the entire 8 hour car ride from Georgia to Michigan.  It ended up having a very similar theme to Atlas Shrugged, but this theme was very well hidden up until the ending, and I thought that the book was definitely more effective than her incredible title:  Atlas Shrugged.  I enjoyed listening to this book, and will now definitely buy it and read it on my own.      You will find the characters incredible and likeable.  I enjoyed getting to know them throughout the script, and look forward to seeing them again in print.    Enjoy this book!  It is well worth your time!

B00000IMTH|5.0|This is the other great Rainbow studio album after its predecessor, \\"Rising\\".  While Blackmore replaced his keyboardist and bassist, the essential lineup of Ritchie Blackmore, Ronnie James Dio, and Cozy Powell remained intact as did the main song-writing team of Blackmore and Dio.  They deliver the same hard rock energy that had permeated \\"Rising\\".    Cozy Powell kicks off the album and title track with some powerful drumming which recurs throughout the track which also features a blazing guitar solo from Blackmore.  \\"Long Live Rock 'n' Roll\\", \\"L.A. Connection\\", \\"Kill the King\\", \\"The Shed\\", and \\"Sensitive to Light\\" are all straight-ahead hard rockers.  Powell's exuberant drumming and Blackmore's guitar riffs really energize \\"Kill the King\\" while Dio's intense singing makes you think he's really hell-bent on regicide.  Some of Blackmore's solos are blues-inspired, especially on \\"The Shed\\".  \\"Lady of the Lake\\" and \\"Gates of Babylon\\" are mysterious and exotic, but still hard-driving.  The group finishes the album with the lovely ballad \\"Rainbow Eyes\\" which demonstrates Dio's  lyrical singing style that he would later use on various Black Sabbath and Dio albums.  \\"Gates of Babylon\\" and \\"Rainbow Eyes\\" feature a string ensemble and string quartet respectively, adding to their atmosphere and providing an early presaging of the direction Blackmore would take many years later with his renaissance music group, Blackmore's Night.    After this album, Dio split and signed up for his first gig with Black Sabbath.  They released the terrific album \\"Heaven and Hell\\" which in many ways sounded like another Rainbow album since Dio wrote all the fantasy-inspired lyrics and some of the tunes.  In contrast, Rainbow released \\"Down to Earth\\" which went for a more mainstream pop/rock sound; while it had some good songs, these lacked the excitement and energy that made \\"Rising\\" and this album so great.  Something that has often surprised me is that Blackmore and Dio never reunited in any form even though Blackmore reunited with Ian Gillian twice to reform Deep Purple in 1984 and 1993 despite previous friction between them.  Perhaps Blackmore's and Dio's musical styles had just drifted too far apart; the reunited Deep Purple albums of the mid 80s and early 90s were not nearly as biting  as Dio's Black Sabbath and solo albums of the same period.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I purchased this in Feb 2009 and I have to say this is by far the best and hardest workout I have ever done.  I am of average weight but wanted a workout to tone various areas.  In a matter of one month I lost 4 lbs plus a total of 2 1/4 inches doing the video 3-5 times a week.  Most of the inches \\"shredded\\" were in my waist and hips.  I have been doing the video now for the past almost 4 months and I have definite, noticeably toned muscle in my arms, legs, and abs.  When I started doing the workout it had been years since I had actually \\"worked out.\\"  I started at Level 1.  After the first workout, I could barely walk down the stairs for 3 days.  I pushed through and after a week began Level 2.  When I first started Level 2, I followed Anita doing the \\"easy\\" version.  After 2 mos of pushing myself a little more each time, I was able to follow Natalie doing the harder version.  I hesitatingly moved on to Level 3 which I found extremely challenging.  But I stuck with it and am able to do more than I ever thought I would.  Your body adapts with a little push and you will be surprised what you are really capable of (which is really what Jillian is trying to tell us).  Level 3 really seems to take you up a notch, especially in the ab workout.  My husband does the workout as well and has also had great results.  Forget the gym membership!  Add a little cardio and this is all you need!!

B001QB9H10|2.0|In \\"Transporter 3,\\" Jason Statham returns to his signature role as Frank Martin, a professional courier and martial arts expert who delivers valuable packages for an exorbitant fee with \\"no questions asked.\\"  In this installment, he's actually being forced to drive some mysterious item from the South of France to Ukraine, accompanied by a freckle-faced cutie (Natalya Rudakova) whose mascara keeps running and who may actually be of more value than what is in the trunk.<br /><br />Despite the pretty scenery, \\"Transporter 3\\" is driven into the ground by a barely coherent storyline, near-comical chase and action sequences, and enough scowling Russian bad guys to single-handedly re-ignite the Cold War.  Even Olivier Megaton's flashy, hurdy-gurdy directorial style can't jump-start a moribund gimmick that actually feels ripped-off from the far superior \\"Speed.\\"<br /><br />Actually, one suspects that the real, unstated goal of the movie is to find as many reasons as possible for Statham to take his shirt off.<br /><br />A ludicrous time-waster.
B001CTDH76|3.0|this is a great tv show don't get me wrong...but compared to psych it's just DUMB,
1439136653|4.0|I loved the structure of this book. The plot is fairly well known by now: a teenage boy from the slums of Mumbai is arrested for cheating to win the top prize on India's version of \\"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\\" He's an orphan with the name Ram Mohammad Thomas so that he can be a chameleon in whatever company his surroundings warrant---Hindu, Muslim, or Christian. Sprung from jail by a young female attorney, he tells her the pieces of his life that correspond to each question that he answered correctly on the game show. He has experienced some violent moments, including some that he orchestrated himself in order to protect a potential victim. In other adventures he's quite the clever picaresque hero, but he makes enough foolish mistakes to keep things lively. My favorite scene is where he pretends to be a Taj Mahal tourist guide after overhearing the spiel of an official guide. His mangling of the facts is absolutely hilarious, especially when he realizes that he can make quite a good living as an unauthorized guide. The kid may be the poster child for instant karma and gaining knowledge from life experiences, but it doesn't hurt to have a pretty solid memory capacity. Even though it's a foregone conclusion that he's going to answer all the quiz show questions correctly, the ending holds a surprise for the reader, as it offers the protagonist one more opportunity to punish a no-goodnik.
B001FB55HG|4.0|Contrary to conventional wisdom, Franchise films are a slippery slope for Hollywood Producers. They're an easy mark for securing funding; which is why such films can be a danger to themselves and the entire franchise. Like weekend alcohol consumption and the Police Academy movie franchise should have taught us, know when to stop.    That was my reason for pause when I learned about Terminator 4. My initial reaction was, \\"another one\\"? Yes, the trailer looked good, but I still couldn't shake the feeling that McG was about to terminate the franchise. Despite my pause, I saw it over the long weekend, and I learned something that every drunkard and producer must know: When you're having a good time, what the hell, keep going. Terminator 4 is a good time. It's a good watch. No, it's not just a good watch. It's a surprisingly good watch - for reasons that are as equally surprising. Here are few:    1) Christian Bale is the film's co-star. The other guy - whoever he is - seems to get equal if not more screen time than Bale.    2) The Terminators are, relatively speaking, scarce in this movie. When they are on screen, boy, talk about screen presence!    3) The cliches in this film actually work. Even the blatant crucifixion pose in the beginning, despite being so heavy handed, was a nice touch.    There's a fourth surprise that you've probably already heard about, but just in case you haven't I'll leave that one alone.    Even the plot is not exactly what you'd think. The Terminators aren't so much killing people as they are collecting them. And they do so with ease. So the intense stainless-steel stalker story from the other three just doesn't apply here. McG has eschewed the cat and mouse game, for something else. He wants to tie-up loose ends from the first one, and then leave the franchise for some other director to drive into the mud. Before they do that,  I may go check this one out again. The drunks and the producers are indeed on to something: when you're having a good time, keep going.
0375758992|4.0|This memoir zips along from adventure to tragedy and back again, without dwelling too long on the tragedies. The author and her family are white tobacco farmers during the violent transition period between white rule and black rule in Zimbabwe. It's a hardscrabble world that the Fullers inhabit, as Fuller's Mum, Nicola, sinks deeper into mental illness and alcoholism. Between bouts, Mum is capable and kindhearted, taking in strays and heading up an unofficial primitive medical clinic when necessary, saving the life of a slashed servant and going to great lengths to rehabilitate a tortured owl. When the going gets too tough, the family gets going, literally, finding another estate to whip into shape in Malawi and then Zambia. The book is a study in contrasts in many ways. The sights, sounds, and smells of African wildlife are part of what keeps the Fullers there, despite the danger of mine blasts and guerilla gunfire.

B000SEGTI0|5.0|\\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\" presents a dystopian future in which humans must struggle with the value of life in a world where nature's restorative powers have been utterly destroyed, replaced by technology that can superficially replicate both animals and  people. Dick creates a future in which there is no natural world to speak of-- radioactive dust blocks the sky, wilderness has been reduced to boulder-strewn wasteland, and nearly all wild animals are extinct. Against this post-apocalyptic backdrop, the humans that have not emigrated to other \\"colonies\\" in the solar system struggle to define and cherish life. Artificial animals and people, the robotic sheep and androids from Dick's title, raise questions about the intrinsic value of life and the limits of empathy. Confronted with a barren world, the characters in this novel care for animals as a way of displaying their essential human quality-- empathy. Those who cannot afford a real animal take care of elaborate robotic look-alikes. Although robotic animals are seen as harmless, androids are forbidden from earth for fear that their lack of empathy will further imperil what life remains. The novel's main character, Rick Deckard, is a bounty hunter, a police officer who makes his living hunting androids illegally on earth. Deckard is forced to confront the implications of his job, which demands that he deny androids the same empathy he showed his electric sheep-- the same empathy that distinguishes him from the androids he \\"retires.\\"    \\"Androids\\" supplements Deckard's perspective with a parallel story line that reveals the complex motivations driving androids to illegally emigrate to earth. Dick's androids are near-perfect humans, except that they coldly disregard the intrinsic value of living things, even after longing to leave Mars because it is a lifeless planet. Dick's construction of complex android personalities that demonstrate their lack of empathy is fascinating. Conscious and sentient, the androids in this novel pose existential questions about their own lives. Dick ultimately appeals to the reader's own empathy by presenting scenarios in which one recoils at the cruelty androids exhibit towards animals that, in the context of the novel, are scarce and precious.    \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\" illustrates the fundamental difference between the way people react to nature, on the one hand, and the machines we make, on the other. Ultimately, humanity's ability to respect the intrinsic value of life sets us apart from the machines we create. For a quick and easy read, this book contains a deep and powerful message.
B0018YIW4S|5.0|While I grew up in the 1970s and loved hard rock groups like Rush, Black Sabbath, and Rainbow, I surprisingly never got hooked on UFO.  I think I knew they existed and liked some of their songs, but I never got around to buying any of their records.  It was only 4 or 5 years ago that I bought the 1999 version of this CD after hearing some of it at my brother-in-law's house.    From start to finish, this is a topnotch live hard rock album that I really enjoy listening to.  Every song is rich with melody and vibrant guitar solos.  Phil Moog has a fine voice and a charming personality (as evidenced by his chatter between some of the songs).  Michael Schenker, who was still only 22 at the time, is outstanding on guitar.  The rest of the band is also fine, but these two guys are the clear stars.    While there are many good live rock albums from this period, this is one of the best.  The only one that I like more is Rainbow's \\"Live in Europe\\" (aka \\"Live in Germany\\") from 1976 which featured extremely long versions of 8 Rainbow songs with long guitar solos by Ritchie Blackmore.
B001GCUNYO|5.0|Wow, I was really surprised by this movie.  I was tired of Liam Neeson because of his roles in Star Wars and Batman Begins - he just didn't pull them off to me. Moreover, I wasn't really interested in seeing another save the kidnapped girl or daughter movie, until I read a few reviews of this blu-ray disc. I was looking for some more good blu-ray discs and so I checked this out. After watching the first half of this movie, I immediately thought of Seagal's Out of Reach 2004 DVD and Man on Fire 2004. Similar plots, but Liam actually out performed Seagal.  Liam's acting was intense and very convincing and he was taking people apart just like Jason Statham in Transporter, etc.  There were also hints of Jet Li's Kiss of the Dragon (find the kidnapped girl in France while breaking a lot of bones). His personality was more like Denzel in Man on Fire - relentless get the bad guys at all costs.  He comes up with these implausible ways of figuring things out, but it is very satistfying to watch.  Also, reminds me of the revenge scenarios in Bronson's Death Wish.  I have cited a lot of good movies here - most of which you may not have seen - however, if you check out Out of Reach, I think you will see that Taken is far more intense and well acted and more on a par, but even surpassing Man on Fire in many ways.  Anyhow, revenge is a dish best served cold (Kahn) and this movie shows that even this worn out plot can be redone effectively and this director did a fantastic job of doing it and Neeson was unbelievable - a perfect mix of Seagal and Statham - and on blu-ray the picture was fabulous - I loved it!
B000002H2H|3.0|I recently got this album after buying Master of Puppets and was kind of disappointed by it.  Overall, I find it kind of tedious.  While there are some very good moments that show the band's talents, they don't last long enough to really earn the album more than 3 stars. I do give Metallica credit for some thoughtful lyrics, but they are all delivered in an uninspired fashion with no attempt to differentiate them.  Perhaps, I would have approached this album with different expectations if I had listened to it before Master of Puppets.  But I might not have even purchased MOP if I had started with this one.    I should let you know that I consider myself more a \\"hard rock\\" fan than a \\"heavy metal\\" fan.  My favorite groups include Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, Rush, Rainbow, Dio, Symphony X, and Dream Theater. So my tastes lean more toward early metal, hard rock, and progressive metal. I admit that I have no taste at all for the music played on Sirius/XM Liquid Metal. If you love thrash metal and death metal, you'll probably consider me an over-the-hill loser.  But if you're in your 40s or 50s and like the bands I like, my review might have more relevance for you.    Most of the songs start with nice instrumental openings, but they descend to monotonous thrash attacks after these promising beginnings. I find little melodic or rhythmic variety in the songs after James Hetfield starts singing.  \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" and \\"Fade to Black\\" are the only songs that approach the maturity of the songs on MOP.  The chorus on \\"Escape\\" is memorable and \\"Creeping Death\\" does have a good guitar solo in the middle.  My favorite song on the album is actually the instrumental \\"The Call of Ktulu\\".  Given my negative comments on Hetfield's singing, that might not be too surprising.
B001R4MEYS|5.0|You gotta love a band like Mastodon.  They're creative, original, and they never stop developing their sound.  This could perhaps come as a disappointment to those who miss the more metalcore-oriented sound of their earlier material, but if you're willing to give this time, it's very rewarding.<br /><br />Expanding on the more progressive leanings of \\"Blood Mountain\\", this album proves to be even more progressive, and even more melodic.  The songs are much longer and even more multi-layered than before, and the hardcore elements are almost phased out entirely.  Still, that's not to say this album isn't heavy, because it is.  The two mammoth epics, \\"The Last Baron\\" and \\"The Czar\\" are filled with as much crushing heaviness as spine-tingling beauty, and the myriad twists and turns keep you on your toes.  There are shorter songs as well, like the sludgy \\"Oblivion\\" and the oddly catchy \\"Divinations\\", making for very nice diversity.<br /><br />This album may take a few listens to really sink in, but it's a triumph for sure.  Much like Maudlin of the Well's new album (which is also amazing), it's not at all what you might be expecting from the band, but once you get past that, it doesn't disappoint.  Definitely one of my favorite albums this year.<br /><br />(PS: My use of the term \\"mammoth\\" was not intended to be a pun, so if I seemed to be a lot more clever than I actually am, then I regret to inform you otherwise.)
B000002H33|4.0|While I grew up in the 70s on bands like Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, Rush, and Rainbow, I moved away from hard rock and metal to classical music late in high school.  I only recently discovered Metallica when XM set up a temporary station called \\"Mandatory Metallica\\" which broadcast in March and April of 2009.  I listened to a lot of their stuff one weekend and liked them enough to order this album from Amazon.<br /><br />Overall, I think Master of Puppets is a great album.  While the thrash guitar and fast drumming make it very intense, the band also delivers good melody and some very fine instrumental interludes; I especially like the use of acoustic guitars in some of these.  I also give the album high marks for providing a fresh sound different from previous metal records and for its thoughtful lyrics.<br /><br />My only criticism of the album is that it is a bit monotonous.  While the band did inject some gentler acoustic interludes, I think the album would have been even better if James Hetfield had actually sung some ballads in a less aggressive vein.  That would have broken up the thrash more and avoided listeners' desensitization to it.
1594201927|2.0|I tried to like this book, but it's an \\"intellectual hodgepodge\\" as one reviewer put it.  It wanders off on sometimes interesting historical tangents, then suddenly veers into jargon filled explanations of financial instruments.  The section on John Law, for instance, is pretty good history, but the description of how derivatives and hedge funds work is sketchy and inconclusive. The author shows a particular bias against Krugman and Stiglitz, because they protested draconian measures imposed on poor countries by the World Bank and the IMF, and passes over Milton Friedman's involvement with Pinochet.  Read  Naomi Klein, _Shock Doctrine_ for a very different take on the Chicago Boys and Pinochet. Published in 2008, it is skeptical of the real estate, subprime bubble, but doesn't really seem to understand how seriously it could damage the economy.  There are better books.  I'm looking forward to Ritholtz' _Bailout Nation_, for a clearer view of what happened to the economy last year.

B000005E60|5.0|Berio's Sinfonia has already achieved classic status since its composition in 1968-69 (it was premiered in 1968, but a movement was added in 1969) - in fact it has been hailed as the way forward for music after the often somewhat aimless experiments of the 60s. Scored for orchestra and eight (amplified) voices - used to speak, whisper and yell rather than sing, it is an almost dizzying assembly of quotations and colors, twist and turns and anxiousness in an extremely inventive, post-serial style.     The first movements, based on texts by Lévi-Strauss (and in fact also the form is based on the anthropologist's work - while certain mythological texts follow something akin to sonata or fugue form, there is another, \\"mythical\\" form (according to Lévi-Strauss) with no musical equivalent, and of course someone had to take him at his word and use it as a basis for a musical work). The second is an integration of Berio's own O King, dedicated to Martin Luther King and makes much inventive use of whole-tone scales.    The third movement is probably the one that most struck listeners back then, and still does - at least on first hearing, with its marvelous, collage-like integration of quotations from Mahler's second symphony (in addition to quotations from, at least, Ravel, Debussy, Hindemith, Brahms, Beethoven, Webern, Berg, Berlioz, Richard Strauss, Pousseur, Schönberg, Bach, Boulez, Stockhausen, Stravinsky and Berio himself - all chosen, apparently, because of their motivic, rhythmic or structural likeness to the scherzo of the Mahler). Overlaid the music is a surrealist recital of various text fragments (Beckett in particular, and Berio's own diary) - it is, to paraphrase Berio himself, something of a fantastic, magical voyage through musical history; but the end-result is a striking musical language that is entirely Berio's own, with its own kind of tension and resolution. The fourth movement, originally intended as a kind of coda, is structurally connected to the second, and the fifth spins an epicycle thematically connected to the first, with the thematic reliance on the Mahler quotation still flowing submerged in the texture as a pulse.     All in all, the Sinfonia is one of the unquestionable masterpieces of the 20th century, and the Boulez interpretation here already a classic - a performance with energy and a power, and an unerring precision not really challenged since  (and where the vocalists are, importantly, integrated into the orchestral sound rather than functioning as soloists in the traditional sense - although one might object that the balance is a little wrong, and the voices are somewhat too loud), even though it might not displace the other available alternatives. The coupling, Eindrücke, is perhaps a tougher nut. It is based on an amalgamation of two earlier works, `Still' and `Bewegung', which results in a surreal, almost-melody-like procession - and interesting work, though not of the level of invention of the Sinfonia, and well played here as well. Sound quality is excellent, and in sum this recording is something of a must.
B000000WA4|5.0|I got this way back when I was a teenager and it first came out needless to say I lost it.  I am so glad I got it again I remembered it being good.  But it is great I love it and I am glad I got it back!
B001FB4W0W|2.0|I am a huge fan of all the sookie books. I have been waiting patiently for this series ... Can you imagine my shock with the content in the series. HBO does not always make things better. In fact the way they have done this is very upsetting to me. I'm not a prude but the content is pure raunchy sex. Some of the characters are off from the books and are doing things that if Charlaine wanted them to do, they would have done in the book. This series ranks right along with the american pie movies , she should have picked a better director because if they don't lay off the raunchy sex scenes, I won't be back for season two. Please don't assume because you love the books you will like the series. They are so bad the teenagers should not be in the room while they are playing . Sorry but this was dissappointing to me.
0307276902|2.0|His intense descriptions about his addiction captured me through the first 50 pages or so and then after that, I had to MAKE myself read. I'm now on page 100 or so and this will probably be the first book I stop reading in the middle. It's extremely repetitive and horribly fake.
0385340575|4.0|The Reacher books are puzzles sprinkled with action. This one has good suspense and excellent action at the end. But sometimes the reader asks, does anyone's mind ever cover all those possibilites in the time Reacher has? The author's skill holds us where a lesser writer would have lost us.

B001KVZ6FM|3.0|I'll get the good stuff out of the way first.<br /><br />Last year I lost someone who meant the world to me. The first 20 minutes of \\"Up\\" so perfectly captured the joy of love and the despair at its loss, that I cried almost continually.<br /><br />As for the rest of the film... eh.<br /><br />Pixar is perennially complimented for its focus on story, story, story -- in particular, character-driven stories. Up to the point where Carl \\"takes off\\", \\"Up\\" is a character-driven story.<br /><br />Unfortunately, once Carl lands in Paradise Falls (courtesy of a Wilderness Scout GPS system) he now is obliged to have the adventure he's been waiting 50 years for. What will it be? I know! His childhood hero, Charles Muntz, is still alive, still trying to catch a phororhacos to prove the bird actually exists. And guess what? Muntz (voiced by a wasted Christopher Plummer) is actually a villain, murderous in his attempts to keep anyone from \\"stealing\\" his discovery.<br /><br />The last third of the film is violent in a way that's downright mean-spirited for a PG \\"family\\" film. Muntz leaves Russell tied to a chair where he can fall out of the dirigible, and comes after Carl with a sword. And though he's been in the jungle for half a century, Muntz somehow has access to microcircuitry that make it possible for his dogs to talk. (Even Bob Pease isn't that clever.) And, of course, Muntz isn't reformed, but falls to his death.<br /><br />Can you say obvious? Can you preposterous? Can you say stupid?<br /><br />This isn't character-based storytelling, it's plot-based melodrama. What happens to Carl occurs because it \\"has\\" to in order for him (and Russell) to strut his (their) stuff.<br /><br />This isn't good storytelling. It stinks, in fact. Bad Pixar. Bad Pixar. Not even all the very funny stuff you expect from a Pixar film, which is present in abundance, can save \\"Up\\" from being shallow and dismally predictable.<br /><br />Unlike most Pixar films, it's unlikely I'll want to see this one even a second time.<br /><br />A Note on 3D<br /><br />I saw 3D movies when I was a kid, but don't remember the details. (Yes, they used gray Polaroid filters, not red and green, despite what all the \\"experts\\" tell you.) Pixar's use of 3D is superb. It never draws attention to itself, except when it's visually pertinent. And every object has depth and roundness -- this isn't the ViewMaster sort of image, with multiple planes of flat objects.<br /><br />As for the RealD system, there is nothing _fundamentally_ new about it. The digital projector eliminates registration and timing problems, and the use of circular polarization means you don't have to hold your head perfectly level. But it works the same as the first polarized 3D movies did at the GM exhibit at the 1938 World's Fair. (I have a bunch of the viewers.)<br /><br />However... One reviewer commented at the loss of \\"vividness\\" when you put the glasses on, ascribing it to the unavoidable loss of light in the viewing filters. To my surprise, this reviewer was correct. The colors are not only somewhat desaturated, but look \\"odd\\" in a way I can't quite explain. This is not simply a drop in light level; something else is going on, but I don't know what it is.<br /><br />THOUGHTS ON THE BLU-RAY (AND FURTHER THOUGHTS ON THE FILM)<br /><br />Because I could get the BD set for $15.50 (including tax and shipping), I was a hypocrite and bought it. The image quality (on a 60\\" Kuro) is far superior to what I saw in the theater. (This was likely the fault of that particular theater's presentation, as the 3D editions of \\"Toy Story\\" and \\"Toy Story 2\\" at another theater were much better.) The BD also makes you aware of the subtle naturalness of the animation.<br /><br />A second viewing only confirmed what an utter botch this film is. If you replace the talking dogs with regular dogs, you have a serious adult film lightened only (a bit) by the presence of an irritating child. It's obvious that the talking dogs are there for humor (and there's no denying they /are/ funny -- when they're not threatening to rip out a character's throat), and to appeal to the kids. (The dogs are the focus of the TV spots.) Without them, there's little in this film to appeal to children.<br /><br />In one of the supplements, Pete Docter explains the difficulties in figuring out how to kill off Muntz. Muntz is supposed to be Carl's psychological \\"Doppelganger\\", the person Carl was in the process of becoming, so it's necessary to get rid of him so that Carl can progress. This thought had never crossed my mind (I don't remember any review, anywhere, that raised it), and the story does essentially nothing to develop it. Indeed, the \\"reveal\\" that Muntz is a psychopathic murderer comes much too soon, cancelling any opportunity for interaction between him and Carl that would have clarified their implied relationship.<br /><br />Of course, once you get rid of the talking dogs, you're left with a fairly conventional drama of the sort we've seen too many times before -- a grumpy old person who's just lost their spouse is restored to happiness by a child who brings light and happiness into their wretched life.<br /><br />When Walt Disney was making \\"Snow White\\", he said he never wanted to do anything \\"ugly\\". \\"Up\\" has a number of truly ugly moments that are out of place in a movie intended for all ages. Yes, life /can/ be ugly, and there is no reason why children shouldn't be exposed to it. (When Disney's daughter complained about the death of Bambi's mother, his resonse was that that was the way life was.) But you don't do it in a film that's an unpalatable mish-mosh of broad humor and crude terror -- including, but not limited to, a child being tied to a chair and left where he will fall to his death.<br /><br />It's interesting how this particular sequence seems to invert a similar sequence in \\"Snow White\\". Remember where she's hanging from a vine and about to drop who-knows-how-far to her possible death? The animators argued over \\"whether the fall would kill her\\" -- then realized they were talking about an animated character, albeit one who seemed very real to them (which, of course, is very much the point of the film). In \\"Up!\\", it doesn't matter that Russell is put in a situation where he's likely to be killed, /because/ he's an animated figure and /can't/ die.l to the kids.

B001HN697M|2.0|It's like Spartacus  plus werewolves and vampires. The special effects are very bad.  They look like cheap video games. The fighting scenes are half baked. They don't look exciting, intense and real as the ones from Underworld 2.     The only good thing about this move is the love between Michael Sheen and Rhona Mitra. It provides a couple of touching scenes. But they are too few to make the film worth while.    I prefer Underworld 2 because of the fighting and Kate Beckinsale. She looks sexy in that film.

1905654294|4.0|Of course like everybody else I too have read all 4 books. I am an avid  romance reader I was referred to read Stephenie Meyer's Twilight Series and of course seen the movie as well. I loved it. Beautiful love story with Edward being the \\"ideal man\\". In sequence this was by far for me the better books: Twilight, New Moon, Eclipse and Breaking Dawn. My disappointment in Breaking Dawn is that after Renesmee is born both Bella and Edward just blends into the scene. To me it felt like they just fell into the background. I feel that Edward should have stepped up as more of a father figure. \\"The ideal man\\" after all is also the \\"ideal father\\". Do not take me wrong, he seems to be a father, I just did not feel that interaction or connection the way Bella had with her daughter. However, for be the biggest problem is Stephenie Meyer. I think Ms. Meyer is a beautiful person both within and without. She has done a fantastic job with \\"The Twilight Series\\" and I continue to wish her the best in future endeavora and hopefully future movies as well. I truly do empathize with her and the whole leak  of Edwards version \\"Midnight Sun\\". I have read the first 12 chapters on her website (that she made public) and I loved it. I think that \\"Midnight Sun\\" is going to do better than all of the books combined because Edwards version is more fascinating than Bella's version (Twilight). However, getting Ms. Meyer to confirm that she will complete this book has been close impossible! Even getting the publisher to confirm it has been impossible. I find this both disappointing and irritating. Once again let me emphasize I empathize with her and agree that whoever leaked the book was wrong to do it. But as they say \\"crap\\" happens but in life we move on. We learn our lessons and we become better people for it. I personally spent over $100 in purchasing all the books and the movies. In this economy thats allot of money. We have shown our love for her by buying her books, by supporting her movies and this is how she treats us - with contention! The fans did not leak the book, somebody close to her did! I think we deserve a good and proper ending to the \\"Twilight Series\\" and to be honest until she chooses to do so, I will choose not to buy any of her future books. Once again, I think she is wonderful, talented and beautiful writer and I hope she continues to do well. But I personally have had enough of the constant whining of how unfair she has been treated! We as her fans and avid followers should be treated better! I have seen links of \\"save midnight sun\\" ect, begging Ms. Meyer to finish the books. I have seen her interviews where she does not give complete answers to questions on whether Midnight Sun will be published. Truly nobody really knows whether she is going to finish it or not. We all hope she does. But as fans of her books, do we really deserve such treatment. Why should we walk on egg shells around her, trying to make her feel better, when we did nothing wrong but support her! I am at a loss!this is how she treats us - with contention! The fans did not leak the book, somebody close to her did!

031606792X|1.0|I wish I could rate this zero stars but Amazon will not allow that.  This book was horrible.  Horrible characters, plot and writing.  In fact the entire series was badly written.  I will never read another book written by Meyer.

The only drawback is that there is no closed captioning, and sometimes it is difficult to understand the broad English accents.

It's one of my all time favorite movies.

B001R4MEYI|4.0|I'll just be straight-up to start: Mastodon is my favorite metal band right now. With each successive album, they have packed more and more manic innovation into the genre while retaining a hard punch. Nevertheless, some fans have criticized them for becoming less heavy and aggressive since Remission. Crack the Skye will not satisfy these fans, but those following Mastodon for their relentless creativity will be pleased.    The best way to approach Crack the Skye is not as a metal album as such. Though certainly heavy at times (Divinations comes to mind), it has a strong 70s progressive rock vibe a lot of the time, and often resembles Porcupine Tree more strongly than anything else. The opening of The Czar is a perfect example - instead of a blasting riff, there is a mellow organ, followed by several minutes of clean guitars and low-burning intensity that builds to heavier things. Despite epic length, The Czar and The Last Baron are gripping, a far cry from Mastodon's previous 3-5 minute bursts of activity.    The heavier tracks are still distinctly Mastodon, especially the aforementioned Divinations, but with a stronger focus on melody and traditional songcraft. Growling vocals are a rarity, and the riffs never seem to blast as hard as on previous albums. Instead, the harmonies are more tightly crafted, and the riffs are more aimed at producing a spooky effect.     The performances remain excellent. Guitarist Brent Hinds is the star here - his eerie, nasal clean vocals are perfect for the aforementioned epics, and his rare solos are ideally placed. In general, the rest of the band lays back a bit more than on past albums but hold the line very well.    Overall, Crack the Skye debuts a different Mastodon, one that shows a great deal of promise. As this band continues to grow, they will undoubtedly continue to surprise fans with left turns, and I look forward to more of those turns. Recommended. Highlights: Oblivion, Divinations, The Last Baron.

B00192KCQ0|3.0|Lately, I've been feeling myself getting older. Not terribly old, mind you, but enough to understand a little bit of how it feels to be nostalgic for a younger, supposedly purer self. I mention this because it's the main thing I felt while listening to Death Magnetic. Nostalgia seems to be the sole purpose for this record, from its inception to its style and sound to its promotion, but that's not enough to make it a good album on the merits.    Death Magnetic represents Metallica's second attempt to return to their 80s-vintage ferocity, and is far more successful than St. Anger. That's a pretty low bar to clear. At least some attention is paid here to the rudiments of musicianship, like proper tuning and staying in time. The songs are far more focused, and mostly seem to have been written by humans rather than Pro Tools. Kirk Hammett is allowed to have solos again, and does fine with them, though his playing is pretty repetitive.    The biggest problem with the album is that this stuff sounds out of date now. Metallica gained a lot of its cred in the 80s on being a \\"thinking man's\\" metal band, but these days smart metal bands pack far more events into smaller spaces than Metallica does here. The songs seem long solely for the sake of being long (Suicide & Redemption, I'm looking at you), so they drag and the album as a whole doesn't hold attention. Only a few tracks - All Nightmare Long, Cyanide, and The Judas Kiss - seem to capture the concentrated force and eclectic invention of the best Metallica albums.    Rick Rubin's production is pretty good except for one massive flaw - the album is mixed at an absurdly loud level, so loud that standard audio equipment will distort the sound overall. Rubin should know better - anyone with any knowledge of audio engineering at all should have known better, and it's a major blemish on the album. The lyrics are also lousy, relying too much on calculated \\"teen\\" angst and juvenile puns like the aforementioned All Nightmare Long.In the end, I can't recommend Death Magnetic. Once again, Metallica has missed the mark on recapturing their magic and made a mostly regressive album to boot. Aging is a drag, but not accepting it is counterproductive and undignified. It's OK to be 40, guys. Time to act like it.
B00005JPAO|4.0|Watched this movie with family members, young and old, who thought it would be \\"boring and dumb\\".  SURPRISE!!!  We ALL liked it!  It had a little of everything; humor, drama, suspense, history, great acting and gave us another faceted look into the life of the Royals!  We did expect it to cover the life of the Queen, a little more extensively, but still found it well worth watching.  We would buy this movie again.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Funeral floored me, plain and simple. I had heard little about Arcade Fire besides the name prior to buying this album, and I expected some solid indie rock. What I did not expect was an album so immediate, visceral, and memorable. It bypassed all my critical reserve and went straight to the heart.    Of the 10 tracks on Funeral, 7 were immediately iconic to me. I'll get the negatives out of the way first - Un Annee Sans Lumiere, Kettles, and Haiti are fine songs but paled by comparison to the rest. Each of the other songs is a sort of ideal - the kind that elicits immediate emotion, rocks surprisingly hard, and is built around a melody that, once heard, feels like its always been a part of your life.     Below the surface, Funeral is a more complex album than it first appears. The arrangements make use of seemingly dozens of instruments, from strings to keyboard to traditional rock instrumentation. Each part is ideally placed in the song and sound-engineered to perfect clarity. Repeat listens reveal repeat nuance.     I have so few bones to pick with Funeral that this can hardly even be considered a review. Unreservedly recommended. Highlight tracks include Tunnels, Power Out, and In The Backseat.

0385340575|4.0|First off, I really enjoyed this latest Jack Reacher installment.  It had all the \\"Reacher-istic\\" things I have come to love plus the mystery and the adventure was superb.  I was just wondering how many other women are avid Reacher fans.  Anyway, while the last book was my least favorite of all the Reacher books, this one left me completely satisfied and hungering for more. Oh, thank you Mr. Child!<br /><br />Now, for my rant that has nothing to do with my review, but it is nevertheless important.<br /><br />I think it is extremely deleterious, prejudicial and just plain WRONG to submit  a review of a book BASED ON THE PRICE that somebody paid for it.  Who cares? Nobody put a gun to anybody's head and said, \\"you must buy or else!!\\"  I was under the impression that reviews are about the substance and content of a book. Honest and candid comments concerning the whole Osama bin laden/politics part of the book may or may not have merit, I don't know--but after all this is a fictional work, and some poetic license is allowed and acceptable.  But even if I disagree, I can appreciate those comments and points of view because they actually concern the content of the book.  Honest appraisals of any book assist me in making an informed decision about whether to buy or read a certain book.<br /><br />OK. End of rant. Read this latest installment because it's a really enjoyable read, full of action, suspense and witty repartee. If this is your first Reacher book, go back and start from the beginning.  You will not be disappointed.

B001FB55HG|4.0|From the moment it was announced, the revival of the Terminator franchise with the advent of Terminator Salvation was met with instant \\"Sacrilege!\\" or \\"Why?\\" from fans everywhere. I mean, Jonathan Mostow and co. pretty much tarnished its otherwise perfect reputation with Terminator 3: Rise of the machines, why rub more salt into the wounds of disappointed fans everywhere with another bad attempt at a \\"Judgement Day\\"-esque movie, right? Salvation was met with even more resistance when they announced the director behind movies like Charlies Angels & Charlies Angels: Full Throttle, McG (short for Joseph \\"McGinty\\" Nichol), would be its directior. Not even the presence of Christian Bale, who would be, technically (if you don't count the nameless actor, Michael Edwards, playing Post-JD!Connor, leader of the resistence) the fourth actor to take up the mantel of John Connor, seemed to dissuade the fears that Terminator Salvation was going to be a movie full of absolute Fail[ure].     Even I was filled with some doubt, if only because of the director (I hate the Charlies Angels movies) but was simply assured in the fact neither Christian Bale or Bryce Dallas Howard would give terrible performances in either roles as John & Kate connor, so that made it watchable enough for me. Kinda. But over the course of late 2008 to 2009, the multitude of trailers and later, TVSpots, dude, I was fully convinced that this movie could not suck in the least. Forget about those two movies McG directed, this was going to be the crowning achivement of his career and the actors employed could only make it better. Well, after a series of trial and error attempts to get out to the movies, I finally managed to drag my family out to a matinee theater to see this. I've gotta say, I was not disappointed.    Our tale begins with Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), a man on death row for the murder of two police officers and his brother. On the day of the execution, he is approached by Cyberdyne Scientist, Serena Kogen (Helena Bonham Carter), a woman dying of cancer, to give up his body for medical research. He is resistent at first, but in exchange for a kiss, he obliges and signs his body over to Cyberdyne Systems before being rowed off to be killed. Fast forword Fifteen years later, its now 2018, Judgement Day has occured and the humans (in form of \\"The Resistance\\") fight against the now self-aware Skynet and its Terminators, in order to survive and reclaim their world.     John Connor (Christian Bale), however, is not the prophetize leader his mother, Sarah, built him up to become. Instead he is a lowly grunt, taking orders from the talking-heads of the Human Resistence, all of which are unwilling to take any of the information or knowledge he has on the Terminators or Skynet itself, seriously. After a somewhat botched attempt to retrieve informaton from a Skynet facility, John learns that Syknet is after a \\"civilian\\" named Kyle Reese (his father) and struggles to find a way to reach out and find him. Meanwhile find Marcus Wright, alive and well, awakens confused by the state of world around him. By twist of fate, he is rescued from a T-600 by a young Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin of Star Trek fame) and a mute girl named Star (Jadagrace Berry) who were apart of a fallen resistence in Los Angles.     After hearing one of John Connor's messages the group decide to try and find him, however, on the way, Kyle and Star are captured by Harvesters. In the wake of a botched rescue attempt, Marcus encounters Blair Williams (Moon Bloodgood), who promises to help him find his friends, if he comes to her base to meet John Connor, who will be more than willing to help him. The big problem with that idea? Marcus isn't exactly who he appears to be and once John Connor finds out, he finds himself faced with following orders or going against them in order to save the man that will become his father.    _______    True to its word, we finally get to see what we've always been given a glimpse of in the previous Terminator films; the war against the Machines. However, I'm sure many will be disappointed to learn that they will not get the ocean of Terminators swarming across a vast field of skulls and rubble with laser guns, mowing down humans. Instead you get battles in ther forms of \\"skirmishes\\" or a simple scramble of humans running from their oppressors, fighting with everything at their disposal. McG, like Michael Bay (or Ridley & Tony Scott), has a eye for action sequences and excuted the lot of them with beautiful precision and smooth editing.     The first battle which introduces us to Bale's rendition of Connor, is a in your face and highly confusing melee of fire, crashing vehicles, and bullets. You are literally in the middle of the choas, being thrown about from the point of view of John Connor as he struggles to survive a monstrous explosion that kills his squad, a helicopter crash and attack from a crippled T-600. Afterward, the action sequences never fail to disappoint as they show a amazing utilization of the terminators and the human characters against them.     While by no means a horror movie in the least, the tension in certian scenes is so gripping I found myself... well, hugging myself in fear that I would loose it (yeah, I admit it, I'm a wimp). Your literally waiting for a Terminator to come around the corner whenever the characters find themselves in an otherwise unsafe place, searching for provisions. My particular favorite Terminator in this movie, is the Harvestor; The giant \\"Transformer-like machine\\" that captures humans for the testing of the T-700/800 Models, hearding them like cattle inside a transporter which it folds into. The Moto-Terminators come in at a close second.    That aside, this film impressed me on all the levels it really needed to. The vision of the future, while not the apocalypic city setting of the previous films, is bleak and baren. I wonder if McG took all the desert cues, where most of thefilm is set, from Mad Max/Mad Max 2, or even Resident Evil: Extinction (2007), as a lot of things from these films (particularly the ragged wardrobes of the human survivors and color saturated wide shots of the dusty world) came to mind when I was watching this. Now when concerned with the pace of the film, there were alot of things I felt could've been touched up on, but I gather this problem arises from the suspected massive amounts of \\"editing\\" it recieved to get the PG-13 Rating for a mass-viewing audience. Alot of scenes, particularly, the ones between the human characters, I felt had been removed/shortened to move the story along. The scene where Kate and John say good-bye to each other is a prime example. Even the dialouge felt a little sped up or out of sync, or maybe I'm just too accustomed to listening to the dialogue in the trailers and watching scenes that never made it into the movie.    On the subject of the characters, besides Marcus, Kyle (and by default Star), and Blair Williams to some extent, there really was nothing between them and you (the viewer) that allowed you to become terribly attatched to the characters. There was no exploration between the characters John and Kate Connor, which is what I would've loved to have seen, to give a glimpse into why they loved each other (or were even married), why in his right mind, John would knock up his wife in the middle of a war-torn world like the one they live in. It was by no means the actor's performances, they were just fine in my opinion (I'll get to that later), but I suppose the direction McG took with them really throws your sense of major concern off until the final gambit of the film. Only then do are you bitting your nails and praying [insert character name here] doesn't bite the dust. Alot of people will complain about the lack of major focus on John versus Marcus Wright, who is arguably the audience's POV for observing the desolate future of a post Judgement Day world, but it wasn't as biga problem as I feared it was. I was more or less worried about how they balance both John and Marcus' storylines, but the result is satisfactory for me. This is probably the one time I'm hoping there will be a Unrated/Director's Cut of Terminator Salvation once it becomes available to the public on Standard DVD & Blu-Ray.    When concerned with the performances, surprisingly, the strongest one is without a doubt Sam Worthington's. For a technical newcomer to US Shores (but a seasoned actor in his own right in the land of Australia), this guy really knocked it out of the park as Marcus Wright. Thank God for James Cameron's recommendation that's all I have to stay. The only negative thing I can really think of with his performance, and its not really a bother to me, was his accent; It was just all over the place. That aussie accent was so prominent in some scenes, I couldn't figure out if Marcus was supposed to be Australian or American. Anton Yelchin, on the other hand, gives a great performance as a young Kyle Reese. You could really pick up on the little personality quirks from Michael Biehn's performance, as the future 27-year old man sent back in 1984 in the original film, in Yelchin's performances, so kudos to this kid.     At the age of 14, Edward Furlong, in my opinion, has long since held the mantle as the best John Connor. Nobody has been able touch his performance, but Christian Bale easily makes him second in my book. Bale has never failed to give a good performance, whatever movie he happens to be in (good or bad), and while this is probably not his strongest performance (compared to his current-previous performances in Batman Begins, Rescue Dawn, The Prestige, or The Dark Knight), he brings an older John Connor to life as a hard and no-nonsense man, frustrated with his current position, with such a passion that I can't do anything except marvel at his work. While not really given much to do besides offer advise and look extremely pregnant in this film, Bryce Dallas Howard gives a better performance as Katherine \\"Kate\\" Connor than Claire Danes ever could in the awful T3: Rise of the Machines (I shall never forgive her for that extremely weak \\"Just die, you bitch!\\" line. Ugh, Failsauce. Danes has done extremely better in other films though). I hope Howard is given a little more do to in the sequel, should she appear again (I pray that she does).     Moon Bloodgood (of Journeyman fame), does extremely well as Blair Williams, though I thought her character was a little deminished when the director made it clear that she would become a potiential \\"love interest\\" of Marcus Wright, and wasn't too subtle about it. I wasn't opposed to it, but yeesh, McG, try sublty next time. Like Dallas-Howard, she isn't give much to do, but Bloodgood makes her time on screen worthy every penny. Ironically, Helena Bonham Carter as Serena Kogen, gives a very short-lived but impressive performance as a ailing woman looking for hope and a cold and calcuating machine, who effectively fools Worthington's character. At first, I was little disappointed with her final appearance, because I half-expected this pivotal scene of hers have her character return as nutty as Bellatrix Lestrange from the Harry Potter series. That fault as mine, however :P (that's what I get for trying to pegion-hold the woman). Jadagrace Berry, really had do nothing except be incredibly cute in silence and I loved every minute of her. I kept expecting the cliched \\"Oh, she talked! Its a Miracle!\\" moment to happen though. Overall, I say, more Jadagrace Berry!    Danny Elfman (which is amusing, given Helena-BC is in this movie) who composes for the movie, creates an effective action score that adds onto the tension of the action sequences. His Salvation theme is reminicient enough of the original theme to please this Terminator fan, though, ironically said theme also shows up in various moments of the film (especially when a certain T-800 model we all know and love appears).The nods to the previous movies were, for once, not bludgened over the heads of its viewers, and handled, in my opinion, with great care. I think my favorite homage, is without a doubt, the Judgement Day reference to a rebellious John Connor's youth with Gun'n'Roses' \\"You Could be Mine\\" roaring over the speakers of a dusty radio to attract the attention of a Moto-Terminator. There even a nice reference to the hey-day of Grunge Rock with some Alice in Chains' \\"Rooster\\" thrown into the mix. Ah, good times.     Finally, on the subject of the Special Effects, both Practical and Computer Generated alike, they were amazingly executed. While there were moments where the CGI peeked out and let you know it was just that, all the other times it was barely noticable. It creates and aids to the Apocalyptic setting of the film. The combined physical traits of body builder Roland Kickinger and the de-aged facade of the Governer of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, do a great job re-creating the menancing appearance for the T-800 model. However, the only thing I didn't like with that little gimmick is that they were damn quick to hide and get rid of Schwarzenegger's face in some scenes. The practical effects for the Terminators, handled by Legacy Studios (formerly known as Stan Winston Studios) were awesome. The leaps and bounds in animatronic technology displayed with the use of the T-600's and the Prototype T-800 are mindblowing. I hope there's a Oscar Nomination in their future after this.      Overall, despite its flaws, Terminator Salvation is a thousand times [infinity] better than Terminator: Rise of the Machines and a great inclusion to the previous two Terminator films. However, do not go into this movie thinking it will be the next Terminator: Jugement Day, because its not and never will be. I'm honestly surprised by the lukewarm responses this film has gotten, because its better than most people are giving it credit for. Overall, a solid [4 out of 5]. The Terminator has purpose and life again in the 21st century.

0451457994|4.0|Between 1964 to 1968, Arthur Clarke and Stanley Kubrick collaborated to make the great science fiction novel.  Much to his genius or credit, Kubrick asked that Clarke not write a screenplay. Clarke later noted that Kubrick and he agreed with John Fowles who put it very well: \\"Any novelist who has written scripts knows the appalling restrictions- obligatory detailing of the unnecessary-the cinema imposes. Writing a novel is like swimming in the sea; writing a film script is thrashing through treacle.\\"<br /><br />So in a matter of months, Clarke remembers, \\". . .  before embarking on the drudgery of the script, we let our imaginations soar freely by developing the story in the form of a complete novel.\\"<br /><br />And what a novel indeed. Full of detail and vast imagination, the book delivers a script/novel which completes for this reader what the movie could not.  The perplexities of the black obelisk, the strange concept of the same, the black hole or similarly obscure convergence between Dave and \\"it\\", and HAL's nervous breakdown all make sense in the book.<br /><br />Laden with symbolism (as much even as Kubrick's film), one could easily become confused of the purpose of the book.  But, unlike the movie, this is not minimalist.  The writer explains most of the major concepts.  And, not until the end, does the ET's unique personality become less rationalized or explained.  It simply is . . . \\"it.\\"  And, from that description, the reader, like the movie goer, will have to use his or her own imagination to conclude the story - or read any of the remaining THREE novels of the 4-novel trilogy.<br /><br />The key to the revelation is the inner voice of Dave - through his contemplation of things happening to him or about him.  Dave logically synthesizes these events and digests them in simple laymen terms to the reader.  Although other times there are complicated mathematical or physical science interludes, Dave's voice is the one to reason, to make the reader best understand the world which no man ever would contemplate or maybe would never understand.<br /><br />This is a great science fiction novel.

B000F1IQMS|4.0|Munich, 2006 film  This film was “inspired by real events” which suggests more fiction than “based on true events”. Young men climb over a fence to get to the Olympic village; are they up to no good? Yes, they are the terrorists who captured Israeli athletes as hostages during the 1972 Olympics in Munich. All eleven athletes were murdered. Will the Israeli government act in revenge? The precedent was the Eichmann abduction. The decision is made. A team will be formed to implement the decision. Will they use experienced agents or new men who won’t be known? This is the story about the reprisals taken against the “Black September” leaders for the eleven dead.  The dinner introduces the men on the team. Avner wants to find the location of some men. [James Madison’s picture was on the $5,000 bill, the largest in circulation then.] The first target is a man who does translations. The operation had costs. The TV shows the news. Another target is selected. What did they do to that telephone? The next time they plan a new method for night-time. Will this team go to Beirut? What kind of disguise will they use to attack their new target? There is a strange meeting in the country. [This pads the film.] They find a safe house in Athens with mattresses on the floor. Was there a mix-up? Or a dramatic device? There is a foul-up. The next target is in London. Will there be a mistake?  Did Carl trust the wrong person? Is it time for them to move out? They visit a houseboat. Those who were eliminated are just replaced by worse men. One of their team was found on a park bench. They must be more careful now. One man wasn’t. There is another failure. Avner returns as if nothing happened. “What did you learn?” Was there a betrayal? What will he do next? Is he being hunted? Was the ending meant to be ironic? Does killing affect the killers psychologically? No therapy mentioned in this story.  There was a scandal when a Palestinian waiter in Sweden was assassinated because he resembled his cousin, who was on the Israeli target list. This is an example of the problem of sanctioned killing: there is no attempt at any trial to determine if the suspect is actually the perpetrator! This film subtly criticizes the revenge seekers by showing how the alleged guilty were people whose names were given out for money. This same criticism was made about George W. Bush’s policy of abducting people and putting them in prison at Guantanamo Bay. This is based on the book “Vengeance” by George Jonas. The European locations were Malta and Hungary. Those killed were replaced by others, but this action was never repeated again (better protection or the threat of vengeance?). In 1971 Nixon abolished the gold standard for US currency and banned the production of any note greater than $100 denomination. Some of the scenes in this film lack classic good taste.
055380684X|5.0|I have taught gifted, talented, regular, and special ed students for a number of years. This books upends the tracking mentality that kids will or won't go beyond expectations. It introduces the notion that kids, parents, and teachers should consistently play their best game - on the court, in the studio, in the classroom -  every time.      In Talent Code, kids who aspire to greatness do so with three things: hard work, parents with expectations, and teachers who delivered a great program. This book gets out of the box and into what works for success in teaching/coaching; what works for encouragement and practice; and what works for support.

The instrumental break on some of the songs is excellent and I congratulate the arranger for letting them run on rather than cutting them off.  It is hard picking a favorite song because they are all good.  Congratulations to all those involved in making this album.

B001AVEJ1Y|2.0|Never been a trekkie (or trekker). Didn't have that much time on my hands growing up. I was able to ignore the entire franchise for years at a time. But I'm of the age to be intimately familiar since Star Trek began in the mid-sixties on tv. This movie has very little to do with the Star Trek culture, if you will. The creators of this know little & cared less. Yeah, there are lots of insider tidbits (Dammit Jim). But they had lots of $$$ & Leonard Nimoy. As part of the saga, it's worthless unless they have a sequel to this prequel. Vulcan is destroyed just as Kirk & Spock are getting to know & at first loathe each other. Spock survives as one of several thousand Vulcans who happen to be off  planet when it is vaporized by a Romulan from the future. As a stand-alone movie it is barely ok. No problem with the young characterizations of the Enterprise crew. There is even a homage to Star Wars. The kissy-face scenes of Spock & Uhura must have been for shock value but made my flesh crawl. Maybe too much of my youthful pop-culture IQ is invested in Star Trek. It is all fiction & this is the 190th review of a movie less than three weeks old.

B001TCHDPS|5.0|You could say that the good news is the bad news concerning this long-overdue reissue, since with its release the entire recorded output of Detroit singer/songwriter Sixto Rodriguez is available to the public for the first time in over thirty-five years. That output consists of exactly two albums - 1970's COLD FACT and this 1971 follow-up - as well as three additional songs recorded later and first released many years after that. Not much of a catalogue, especially for one of the most unique and worthwhile songsmiths of the past four decades.<br />  I've already touched on the mystery of Rodriguez - which, thanks to the extensive liner notes in these reissues, is no longer that much of a mystery - in my review of FACT, so I'll refer the curious to that nonpareil gem of musical criticism and get right down to brass tacks. COMING from REALITY is a fully worthy successor to FACT, with all of its creator's dizzying wordplay and compositional acumen intact, but it's also a very different album in many respects. Recorded in London with British session musicians and a full string section, REALITY inhabits a separate sonic territory from that of its Motor City predecessor. It's also a good deal less eclectic, which helps to enhance its \\"album feel\\" but also casts its weaker moments in sharper relief - not that there are all that many of them.<br />  \\"Climb Up on My Music\\" is a tough, driving opener, instantly establishing that blown-glass balance of pop accessibility and esoteric intelligence which has always distinguished the greatest songwriters. \\"A Most Disgusting Song\\" is in fact a spoken poem (Proto-rap?) of deceptively humorous twists, while \\"And I Think of You\\" is one of Rodriguez's most affecting ballads, a lost love tale equal in its naked sentiment and plausibility to FACT's brief, brilliant \\"Forget It.\\" \\"Heikki's Suburbia Bus Tour\\" brings on the social commentary which dominates the latter half of REALITY in its surreal story of middle America remade as a tourist attraction. \\"Silver Words?\\" is a lightweight love song, cute enough but probably a bit too happy for its own good.<br />  Side two of the original LP opens with \\"Sandrevan Lullabye - Lifestyles,\\" Rodriguez's longest track and a beautifully bitter assault on society's failures effectively sandwiched between two heavily orchestrated instrumental sections. \\"To Whom It May Concern\\" is the \\"snap out of it\\" tune on this collection, and like most such numbers it doesn't add terribly much. \\"It Started Out So Nice,\\" however, is powerful stuff, juxtaposing a mythical yesterday of poetic prettiness against the dashed hopes of the present with the aid of a lovely and unintrusive string backing. \\"Halfway Up the Stairs\\" is pure fluff, but its mindless positivity almost makes sense as a prelude and first aid kit for \\"'Cause,\\" Rodriguez's lyrical magnum opus and the most sublimely realized rumination on the very real horrors of human existence you're ever likely to hear. This song makes \\"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\\" sound like \\"Old MacDonald\\" and closes REALITY with nothing whatsoever left to say.<br />  Not on this CD, however. The final fragments of Rodriguez's musical oeuvre have been appended to his final album for this release, and the listener benefits greatly as a result. Recorded in 1972 or '73 (presumably as the kernel of a planned third album which, like the man's work en toto, was regrettably nipped in the bud), \\"Can't Get Away,\\" \\"Street Boy\\" and \\"I'll Slip Away\\" are all winners, the first continuing the episodic social criticism of earlier songs but with a more personalized slant; the second a tuneful, undramatized portrait of a lost soul; and the last a clever farewell number in the best Rodriguez fashion - first class all the way.<br />  Where COLD FACT enjoys that peculiar perfect beauty which only pure accident can achieve, COMING from REALITY makes a concerted effort to be beautiful; and while it succeeds much of the time - resulting in several tracks which are, ifanything, stronger than even FACT's best material - there's no denying that it's the patchier half of the pair overall. Nevertheless, \\"'Cause\\" and the bonus tracks easily elevate this disc to five-star status, as does the sheer inescapable quality of the artist. I cannot possibly recommend both Rodriguez albums highly enough to anyone reading this. The chance to grab the complete works of a man whose music can comfortably rub shoulders with that of Neil Young, Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen or Bruce Springsteen in two easy purchases is not one to be missed. We are all the poorer for the long and storied career Sixto Rodriguez should have had; but we are certainly the richer for having what little there was of that career within reach once again.tronger than even FACT's best material - there's no denying that it's the patchier half of the pair overall.

031606792X|1.0|While I've been known to exaggerate on occasion, I promise you I'm being completely serious when I say Breaking Dawn is the worst book I have ever read.  The writing was atrocious, there was no drama and/or real conflict, and Meyer broke her own rules.  Repeatedly.    Let's begin, shall we?    First, the writing itself was a huge problem.  It's nearly impossible for me to believe Meyer was an English major in college.  Maybe she was technically a literature major, but either way, she should have been exposed to enough decent writing to know how to produce it herself.  And if she couldln't produce it from her own head, she probably had enough references to replicate it.  Instead, Breaking Dawn reads like a terrible fanfiction.  Meyer tends to overuse adjectives and adverbs, but does so in the least descriptive way possible.  How did Bella look on her wedding day?  I couldn't tell you, since Meyer never bothered to describe her dress other than to say it was satin-y.  And how about the rest of the wedding ceremony?  There were flowers \\"everywhere\\" and everyone looked \\"amazing.\\"  Thanks.  I can totally picture that.    Bella is also the ultimate Mary Sue, which doesn't help Meyer's writing skills in my eyes.  Bella is SO PERFECT.  Everyone LOVES HER.  Meyer's lame attempts to make Bella relatable by making her clumsy fall flat (pun intended), because the other characters think injury-prone Bella is adorable.  Will Charlie object to Bella Sue getting married at 18?  Of course not!  Will Bella Sue become the most graceful vampire ever, even though she was the world's clumsiest person?  You bet!  Bella gets everything she wants in Breaking Dawn and sacrifices nothing.    There was also a conspicuous lack of drama and conflict in what should have been an epic conclusion to a series.  As I mentioned above, Bella had no problem convincing Charlie that marrying Edward was the right decision.  I was expecting more of an objection from the ol' sheriff.  Denied.  Jacob does makea small attempt to talk Bella out of turning into a vampire, but what could have been another interesting conversation is brushed aside by Bella.  Why would she miss anybody she knew as a human?  She'll be with her beloved Edward for all eternity; that's all she needs.    The sexy-time was also lacking.  I'm not much of a smut fan, but I was hoping for more than a cheezy \\"fade to black\\" when Edward and Bella finally do the deed.  After three books of anticipation and denial, Meyer doesn't have the balls to give us more than Bella walking toward Edward in the water.  Seriously, Meyer?  You can show Bella vomiting \\"a fountain of blood\\" but kissing before sex is too shocking?  Nothing interesting here, folks.    There is also the issue of Bella's pregnancy.  Nowhere in the previous three books, and I mean NOWHERE, did Bella mention a desire to be a mother.  But as soon as Edward gets his vampire sperm inside her, she decides that motherhood is the most important thing on Earth.  (Inconsistent much, Meyer?  Another sign of bad writing!)  I was expecting Bella to freak out, get angry at Edward, and blame him for ruining her life when she thought she could never get pregnant!  But instead, Bella is inexplicably calm and instantly bonds with her \\"little nudger.\\"  Again, any drama that could have been just melted like an ice cube in Death Valley.  The plot floats along...    The previously mentioned \\"fountain of blood\\" happens when Bella goes into labor.  To make a long and rather gruesome story short, the baby almost kills Bella, and would have, had Edward not turned Bella into a vampire.  Bella lays on a table for a couple of days until the venom stops her heart.  She's dead!  Let the crazed baby vampire gather her bearings!  She's dangerous right now!  Right?  Wrong.  Bella Sue is the perfect vampire, so graceful and strong.  She requires almost no adjustment time, even though Meyer told us in previous books that new vampires are totally out of control.  Again, all conflict nipped in the bud.    This leads us to Meyer breaking her own rules.  Bella is totally in control of herself as a new vampire even though, according to Meyer's own words, it's totally normal and EXPECTED to have a lenghty adjustment period.  Jasper struggled for years, but Bella gets the hang of things in a day.  Of course.  Meyer breaks the rules so Bella Sue can have her perfect life.    Meyer also gets into a sticky situation with Bella's pregnancy.  According to Meyer, speaking through (I believe) Carlisle, vampires don't have any liquid in their bodies except for their venom.  Last time I checked, sperm isn't venomous.  Getting Bella pregnant should have been impossible if Meyer followed her own rules!  That entire plot device (which only served to give Jacob something to imprint on) was an amateurish cop out that I would expect to find in fanfiction, not a novel written by an adult with a college degree.    Oh yeah, they named the baby Renesmee.  Vomit.    And then Jacob imprints on it.  Double vomit.    Allow me to backtrack for a second. I forgot to mention another scene that should have been exciting but wasn't: the confrontation with the Volturi.  Yep, the leaders are back and they want to kill the Cullens for making an \\"immortal child.\\"  Finally, some action!  The Cullens invite some vampire friends to gather at their house and fight the Volturi, which should be the epic conflict we've all been waiting for!  Except it most definitely is not.  It turns out that Bella has a shield she controls with her mind.  All the does is put the sheild around everybody and they're impervious to weapons.  The Volturi stand around and talk for a while and then... leave.    Breaking Dawn was a letdown in every sense.  Meyer's writing didn't improve (it got worse, actually), there wasn't any tension or action, and a lot of the rules established in the first three books got thrown out the window.    Avoid this book at all costs.    (Note: Don't be fooled by the high number of five-star reviews; a lot of them are two sentences long and say things like, \\"BELLA AND EDWARD ARE IN LOVE!!!!1!11one\\"  They may very well be, but that doesn't make it a good book.)
1423101472|5.0|This book was awesome.  Rick kept to the series and I really connected with the characters. I enjoyed reading it and it was definitely a page turner.  I read it in two days.
B001QOOCTE|4.0|After seeing the stunning You Tube video and catching the band on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno, I was really looking forward to getting this CD. I have to admit to having a lump in my throat as I listened to the first few tunes. What a treat. I hadn't expected to hear the likes of Bono, Keb Mo and others contributing on these tunes, but am glad this is such a far-reaching and collaborative effort. Unpretentious and heart felt, just a musical blessing.
B001NESPHC|5.0|This is an outstanding recording from Gardot. Her singing is intimate, soulful... addictive to say the least. Musically creative, extremely interesting.    In some way, if Diana Krall was being played in a restaurant, Melody is who you'd love to be having dinner with (and Diana is awesome, so this says a lot).    Million percent recommended.
0374531269|4.0|This was a great book. It's up there on the level of The Road where you honestly can't believe how bad something can be. To know that this is a true story of a boy is just heart breaking.     The story is very well told and you find yourself caring greatly for the boy Ishmael.     Highly Recommend.
B001FB4VZS|2.0|I was very disapointed in this season of Smallville, and actually the last season was somewhat disapointing as well.  How can we be in season eight and Clark is not able to fly yet?  I am tired of the constant bickering between Clark and Oliver.  The only bright spot is Clark's unwillingness to take the lives of others, no matter the monster they might be, but come on he is superman it is time to dawn the cape and fly.
B000YRY8BG|4.0|I enjoyed completely all the chapters of this miniseries, it was thrilling. I didn't expect what happens at the end. The performances from all the actors are great. I wasn't desapointed at all. I wanted to watch it before I'll go to the movies to watch the version of this story in Rusell's Crow new movie with the same title. I am very satisfied with the adquisition of this DVD.
B001K3JF7K|5.0|This album is Dianna at her best singing some old standards in the style of Julie London and Ella Fitzgerald with some more modern Brazilian fare included.   Very relaxing to listen to.
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|A pair of time travelers goes nearly 200 years into the past, setting into motion a series of events that will assemble the original crew of the starship Enterprise under alternate circumstances, creating a new time line and rebooting the franchise.    I should probably give this film 4 stars; the plot is overly complicated, there is some clumsy exposition in the middle, and the villain (Eric Bana) is two dimensional.  However, everything else is so perfect and the resulting picture gives this franchise the kick in the behind it has needed for many years.  Purists may find much to gripe about, but I am impressed by the way director J.J. Abrams and screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman have managed to push the reset button in a way that does not nullify more than 40 years of storytelling.  Let the novel writers and graphic artists carry on with the original Star Trek universe.  Now we have a great young cast portraying classic characters and forging their own continuity.  Zachary Quinto and Karl Urban, as Spock and McCoy respectively, give faithful presentations that do not resort to caricature.  The rest of the cast--Zoe Saldana as Uhura, John Cho as Sulu, Anton Yeltsin as Chekhov, and Simon Pegg as Scotty--create engaging characters that are quite different from the originals.  Chris Pine, as Kirk, does a good job of portraying a cocky young man who grows into the role of starship captain.  I'm looking forward to subsequent entries in the series.
B001V7YWTQ|5.0|My interest for this album was sparked by Stevie Winwood's appearance at Clapton's Crossroads Festival [[ASIN:B000VR824S Crossroads: Eric Clapton Guitar Festival 2007]]. That was just the appetizer for this feast of sublime musicianship. I feel that Clapton produces his best work when he collaborates with others, and this album just goes to prove my point. Clapton and Winwood compliment each other so well that the resulting musical magic is so warm, it glows. It doesn't hurt that the band behind them are stellar musicians as well.   'Live from Madison Square Garden' is one of those rare treats that makes you feel good just listening to it. Do yourself a favor and get it now!
B001K3JF7K|2.0|Ugh! I found this album much the same as her other albums. THE SAME! You could play each album back to back and not know which one you were listening too. Yes, she has a good thing going, but after a while it is all THE SAME. Except for her tribute to Nat King Cole I have found not much new in her album song selection.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|Ashton Kutcher proved that he could carry an entire film on his own with \\"The Butterfly Effect\\". Up until the release of this movie Ashton was simply typecast as a TV personality, but after the release of \\"Butterfly\\" he became a leading man and a huge Hollywood star.<br /> Ashton plays a young man who had a very troubled childhood. He discovers that now, in the present, he has the power to actually go back in time and alter and change his past, sometimes with results not of his own doing.<br /> This is a compelling story and unlike anything Hollywood has ever done. The script and performances are flawless. Amy Smart, who plays Ashton's girlfriend, is excellent, and plays a woman who was sexually abused by her father, and who grows up to be a drug-addicted prostitute.<br /> This particular DVD has two versions: the director's cut and the theatrical one. There are a slew of bonuses including the filmaker's commentary, documentaries on the movie called \\"The Creative Process\\" and \\"Visual Effects\\", a storyboard gallery, and theatrical trailer. Paul Fischer of \\"Dark Horizons\\" says, \\"\\"The Butterfly Effect\\" is an engrossing, unpredictable and original film, more chilling and compelling the \\"The Sixth Sense\\"\\".<br /> This DVD is a dual-layered disc with one side featuring the director's cut and the other the theatrical version. There is also a small booklet that accompanies the set that features the movie chapters.<br /> There are two sequels to \\"The Butterfly Effect\\", but neither comes near to the originality and perfection of this one. Save your money and buy \\"The Butterfly Effect\\". It is unlike any movie you have seen.
B0002OERI0|5.0|AI is an incredible album!  I just can't get enough of it.  It's deep, poignant, beautiful, powerful.  It's so many things.  They just really got it right, I don't know how else to say it.  I purchased this as my third or forth copy of this album as I have either worn out accidentally scratched others.  I couldn't imagine not having it in my collection at all times.  If  you haven't done so, skip past the singles and listen to the lesser known tracks.  Follow along with the lyrics, this album tells the story of a generation.
B00102F5WK|1.0|Pitiful left-wing Hollywood propaganda film that ignores the harsh reality of the ongoing terrorist jihad against the West and especially against the United States.
B0002VHBTK|2.0|This film may have had a tad of art to it but for the most part it looked like a practice RUN for \\"Groundhog Day.\\"  I appreciate the differences but there is nothing unique about this movie.  The only pleasure is comparing this to the hundreds of other similar movies (\\"D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu\\", \\"Sticky Fingers of Time\\", \\"Happy Accidents\\", etc.)<br /><br />The story is very basic; boyfriend loses mob money to bum on subway.  Girlfriend (Franka Potente quite hansom if you discount the red hair) frantic to help must RUN to his rescuer obtaining 100,000 Deutschmarks (pre-Euro 2002) on the way. We are treated to several versions and there could have been more.<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------<br />This film lends its self well to Blu-ray. And there are a few DVD extras worth watching. Unfortunately they spoke to fast to interpret so I needed the English subtitles. I would have preferred German subtitles then I may have been able to keep up. There is an English soundtrack but much is lost in the translation.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000P46QTA The Lives of Others [Blu-ray]]]
0375842209|5.0|Great, great story.  The characters are so real and the story is so touching.  I would recommend this book to everyone.
B001KEGRCA|5.0|Imax films are THE state of the art in picture and sound quality in Blu-ray discs and this disc continues that tradition!! The color is spectacular and natural and is sharp as a tack unlike many blu-ray movies where you have many scenes that look like they were shot slightly out of focus or in 720P!! (An example of this is the Planet Earth discs)I will use this as a demo disc to show off my new home theater!!
B000YRY8BG|5.0|Strong story supported by strong actors make for a strong story. This moves fast but at a nice pace.  Only downplay on this one the actors accents are somewhat thick and you will need to rewind and replay.  But you will be glad you saw this. Janet McTeer is amazingly subtle as the retiring detective and Bill Nighy is the true editor that will protect his story even if he knows not what the story is yet. I don't even think the American movie version could live up to this version.  That's why the british did it first....
B0001Z365U|5.0|Not only is this Spock's Beard's trademark album, it's also one of the best albums in the Progressive Rock genre.  Well written, well orchestrated, never a dull moment.  One of those albums that works best as a whole, but is also entertaining \\"broken into pieces\\" as it were.  Definitely recommended.
B00140PK6O|5.0|What an amazing simple, sweet , sad and funny story .  All those emotions into one package, along with Dame Judy Dench who shines.  \\" Sister doesn't approve of that word... Suck \\"   speaking about how oranges should be eaten in the privacy of your own bedroom with a plate and a napkin. Never \\"sucked\\" out.    they don't make 'em like this anymore. It's a small scenic painting that you have looked at in your Grandma's house on the parlor room wall for years that has come to life.  And when the tears are all dried up ( the poor sisters' deaths ) , and the stomach ceases to hurt from laughter over trying to get the cat to do his \\"business\\" so that you can retrieve your antique lace , you'll wish you could open your own front door and walk right into .... Cranford.
0375826726|2.0|I waited a long time for this book and I did not start reading the series until well after the first one was released. I loved the first two. I bought them and put them up in my nice little shelf of my sacred, favorite books. They encouraged me to start reading more young adult literature, because I enjoyed them so much. However, Brisingr was very disappointing. I found myself asking \\"Did I learn anything new about the story line in this book?\\" I am not convinced. I feel like I wasted my time. Paolini, Can we get to some interesting stuff? Please. I thought it was a bunch of useless blather in the end, which is sad, because I had waited so long to read it. It just seemed like a lot of fluff, not really interesting, definetly not page turning. Everytime, Eragon and Saphira go back to Ellesmera, Paolini seems to waste a lot of pages talking about a whole lot of nothing. It really does not have to be that detailed, not everyting at least, geez, it has become so detailed it is frustrating. I am not an author, but that's not good right? I did not think so. I do not recommend it but if you like the first two, what other choice do you have but to struggle through it and wish and pray for a good final installment?
B001LEHXHW|5.0|Enjoyed this immensely. Grand finale to the series. Thank you Stephenie for making my hour long commute so enjoyable for the past couple weeks. And my time doing my hobby of melting glass, the book on CD provided me many many hours of listening pleasure.

0307269752|4.0|This compelling crime novel follows disgraced investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist and talented but troubled security firm researcher Lisabeth Salander as they work to solve a forty-year-old mystery.<br /><br />In the mid-1960s, Harriet Vanger, the teenage heiress to one of Sweden's largest industrial fortunes, disappeared from her home. Despite the efforts of a team of police investigators, the case remained unsolved. The missing girl's affectionate great uncle and guardian, Henrik Vanger, continues to brood over the disappearance, searching for clues about what may have happened. Nearing the end of his life, Vanger recruits Blomkvist in a last-ditch attempt to discover the truth.<br /><br />As Blomkvist and Salander come to understand more about Harriet's disappearance, they uncover a bigger and more sinister mystery with important implications.<br /><br />###<br /><br />\\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" is a great read with a fast-paced, clever and surprising plot to rival the best of the best mystery/thriller genre. At the same time, the novel features dynamic dialogue and a cast of fully realized, flesh-out characters that defy stereotypes.<br /><br />Particularly fascinating are the two main characters: Blomkvist, with his passion for exposing corruption, his loving but complex relationship with best-friend, business partner and sometime lover Erika Berger, and his profound but atypical morality, and; Salander, the twenty-four-year-old misfit with a dark history of institutionalization, a gift for understanding computers and data assimilation, and a punk rock aesthetic.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B000L43AN4|5.0|For the ages. I've been listening to this for over 2 years now randomly on the ipod shuffle. How could the creator of career-making albums, Rain Dogs, and Swordfishtrombones make a better record? Why would he even try? The king of Independents and alternative music could easily rest on his laurels, watch his kids grow up, and make an occasional album to pay the bills... Instead we get this magnum opus of 54 crafted songs that run the gamut: alt., gospel, early rock-n-roll, gutter underground rock--you get the point. Probably the true inheritor of the beat movement; his images are priceless, poetic lines innumerable, leaving us with 3 discs desert island worthy. Now this one he has no chance of topping, right?
B000FC12YQ|5.0|That book was crazy. It was crazily magnificent. Poirot comes out of retirement long enough to solve a case that, undoubtably, he is the only one who is able to solve it. You never would have expected THAT ending. If you enjoy mystery novels, this is an amazing read for you. Just expect the unexpected...
B001GQSY5K|2.0|If this new animated Clone Wars movie is to kick start a series that bridges the gap between episodes 2 and 3, then there are already some major continuity flaws. First of all, assuming the feature film happens right after episode 2, the main characters (Anakin and Obi Wan) already have their Episode 3 hairstyles, which is not believable. How did Obi Wan lose his mullet so quickly? How did Anakin's hair get so long so fast? Their hair should progress into these new styles over the 3 year period, not overnight. Secondly, Anakin is no longer a Padawan and now has a Padawan of his own. Excuse me? The story doesn't even deal with the issue of facing the trials or being promoted to the rank of Jedi Knight. Again, it just sort of happens overnight. Thirdly, Grievous comes right out (in the TV series, not the feature) with no real exposition. Asajj Ventress is in the feature, and has had prior run ins with Anakin and Obi Wan, based on the dialogue exchange in the film. When did this happen? As far as I'm concerned, the cartoon micro-series from 2003/2005 was superior in taking it's time with logical plot / character development, especially season 2 which led directly into Episode III. By itself, though, this new clone wars is very entertaining and well done.
031606792X|5.0|This was an exciting book for being the last of the twlight saga. Wish you would write more.
B001V7UXG2|2.0|The eight discs that clock in at a hefty 1150 minutes of wry British wit that stars Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry is a puzzling (re)release on a pair of critical areas: there is nothing new from the complete series that was issued in 2002 and the transfer to disc remains \\"iffy,\\" which plagued its initial appearance in the marketplace.<br /><br />Laurie portrays Bertram Wilberforce \\"Bertie\\" Wooster - the bumbling, dimwitted aristocrat - and Fry is the witty valet, Reginald Jeeves, in the series that is based on Sir P.G. Wodehouse's \\"Jeeves and Wooster\\" stories. The 23 episodes appeared on the ITV network from April 1990 to June 1993 and feature bossy aunts, romantic scrapes and a number of friends who just can't stay out of mischief.<br /><br />Hopefully there are plans for a definitive set and this repackaging of a prior release is a bridge to that end. Though the shows were outstanding, there needs to be a serious production makeover to make for a solid collectible for fans of all ages.
B001OGRLOC|3.0|Testament is one of my favorite bands, and has been since 1990. This is not their best work, in fact, it may be their worst.  The album starts off ok, particularly Face in the Sky, and Souls of Black, but after that it mostly feels like filler.  It is not nearly as powerful of a work as Practice What You Preach, or The New Order, or even The Legacy.  The guitar work of Alex Skolnick is good as always, and the vocals of Chuck deliver, but many of the songs feel rushed, like they would not have made most of the other Testament Albums.  If you are going to buy one Testament CD, make it either The New Order, or their new one, The Formation of Damnation, or maybe the Gathering.  If you buy this one, and it is the criteria you judge them upon,  you may end up liking this band less than they deserve.
B001782N4A|2.0|This is a cheap UK import and not the original Japan version. It's made of a cheaper plastic and has no LED's or dome spinning action. Pay the extra $10 and get the real deal from Entertainment Earth or Think Geek.
B000SX88VW|5.0|Pink Floyd is probably the best artistic music group to come out of the Twentieth century, and this album is as good as anything in their discography.  The album transcends pop music, and has become an underrated iconic work of art portraying modern humankind.  But I could also say that about most of their albums.  For me, this one paints pictures in your head about who you really are in this society, and leaves you feeling empty, wondering what it is we are missing.  Not to try and bring you down, but by displaying this metaphor, Pink Floyd helps us to understand we are not alone in our misery.  By releasing this album, as well as many others, they show us what they are feeling, and it is the same emotions we are feeling.  I usually consider myself a Sheep, but have often related to the Dog story as well.  Especially the line, \\"And when you lose control, You'll reap the harvest you have sown.  But it is not beyond me to become a Pig in this contemporary age.  Which animal do you resemble?<br /><br />The music is great, but most people don't get the long, meloncholy metaphorical compositions.  Everybody likes quick snappy songs that you can dance to, and very few understand that music is probably the most emotional and powerful artform in existence.  This music takes time to listen to.  It is an album to play whenever, whether you are working, driving, relaxing, self medicating, sleeping, this is the soundtrack to your life.  Pink Floyd was so ahead of their time in everything they did; they still sound futuristic here in the twenty-first century.<br /><br />If you like music as an artform, this is for you, if you like mindless music industry products, go buy the latest American Idol winner's CD.  In my humble opinion, it is better than The Wall, and Dark Side of the Moon, but not by much.
0805080120|5.0|I rarely give 5 stars, but occasionally I encounter a book of such stunning erudition that the commendation is deserved. The Unfolding of Language by Guy Deutscher is one of those rare books that have the potential to open up a vast new field for mental exploration, or if the topic is already somewhat familiar, to completely change how you look at it. I would be the first to admit that I am new to linguistics and so everything here could already be well known to interested readers. That said, few books on advanced topics that are meant for general readers are so well written, comprehensive and thought provoking. This book surely stands apart.    Why do some languages have such complicated case structures and verb conjugations? Why are some so irregular with so many exceptions to every rule? Why do English and Turkish arrange words in the opposite sequence in sentences? Why do Hebrew and Arabic have such a complex and remarkable system of verbs? Why do Indians often say that Sanskrit is the most precise of all languages? And finally, the fundamental question, how did language evolve?    Deutscher tackles all these issues directly and draws on examples from languages as diverse as Tamil and Jemez. He explores the common origin of many currently very different languages in Proto-Indo-European. He compares language to an architectural achievement that has produced complex and magnificent structures capable of expressing every nuance of thought. Reading the book I could not help but think that language is more like life itself, with new species constantly arising, evolving and often declining. In Deutscher's metaphor processes of erosion and addition constantly hone language to the needs of each generation of speakers.     Most of us recognize that sculpture, music, painting, not to mention science, have all become progressively more advanced over the millennia, apart from an occasional setback such as after the fall of the Greco-Roman world. Counter-intuitively, the opposite seems to have happened with language. Though our knowledge of the world is much more complex, our modern languages actually are simpler than the recorded languages of the ancient world like Latin, Ancient Greek, Sanskrit and even Gothic, as students of these languages know. Astonishingly, the few written records from the dawn of history 5000 years ago reveal fully developed languages with almost the full set of complex features of modern languages. In today's world primitive societies do not have simpler languages than industrialized societies. On the contrary, the opposite is likely to be true. These are some of the fascinating topics discussed in the book.    Deutscher poses some hard questions when he sets out to explain how language developed, why old languages seem so much more complicated and how languages change over time. All these issues are addressed in a straightforward and organized fashion with enlightening, illustrative examples. This dazzling book was a joy to read.
055358202X|4.0|Obviously, many readers have been seriously disappointed in this volume of the hugely sucessful 'Song of Ice and Fire' saga.  A number of reasons have been given for this less-than-pleased response to  A FEAST FOR CROWS, including: a loss of focus, absence of some popular characters,  the focus on less popular characters, a seemingly aimless direction of the story, a general lowering of the quality of writing, and the perception that Martin has fallen into the Jordan-WoT trap of endlessly expanding the story without maintaining its intensity.  Also, for more recent reviewers of this book, a major gripe has been over the long delay (coming up on 4 years) without publishing the 'companion' volume [[ASIN:0739375970 A Dance With Dragons]].  Some of these complaints are valid, while others are simply not.<br /><br />Firstly, the growing delay with the publication of A DANCE WITH DRAGONS is completely maddening.  This is especially true because it is supposed to serve as a sort of parallel book covering the same timeline as FEAST FOR CROWS, but focusing on some of the most interesting and entertaining characters (including Jon, Daenerys, Bran, and Stannis) that were missing in FEAST.  Remember, FEAST didn't come out for nearly 5 years after the publication of[[ASIN:055357342X A Storm of Swords]]. That means that we haven't heard anything from our favorite characters for going on NINE YEARS!  I doubt anyone (including Martin and his publishers) can say now that it was a good idea to divide this part of the story into two books focused on certain characters only.  I am a patient person, and would rather wait for an excellent book than be delivered a steady stream of only-adequate ones that would bring down the quality of the story, but five years between books is excessive.  I just pray that the rumors going around saying that Martin has just lost interest in this story aren't true...<br /><br />As for most of the other complaints, I don't think they hold much water.  The writing quality is certainly at the same awesome level that we've seen in the previous three books.  While the story does seem to wander a bit here, it definitely continues to progress the plot, and much of the wandering serves to further expand this already massive setting.  Exploring Dorne, the Iron Islands, Oldtown, and Braavos help to make this world even bigger and even more real.  Its debatable whether continuing to expand the scope of the story was the right move or not, with no end in sight, and plenty of story to tell, but personally, I didn't find those sections irritating.<br /><br />While I certainly missed my favorite characters, I still enjoyed following the ones in this book.  Jamie's continued development is excellent and Arya's journey promises to be monumentally important.  While I didn't like Martin's take on Cersei's seeming mental meltdown, it was still entertaining watching my most hated character destroy herself.  The only thing I found less than appealing about the POV characters here was Martin's decision to start using secondary characters for single chapters with descriptors like \\"The Captain of Guards\\" or \\"The Queenmaker\\".  Not sure where his decision to move away from telling the story through a specific set of characters' viewpoints came, but I don't think it improved the cadence of the book and I do think it took away from his ability to develop certain characters through their perspectives.<br /><br />Finally, I don't think Martin has become the next Jordan (needlessly expanding the story simply to milk the cash- and fame-cow for all its worth).  While this story might have grown too big for him to handle, and while he might pull a Jordan by dying before it is finished (God forbid), I think he really does want to make this tale the best fantasy story of all time and is following some sort of overall master plan towards his desired outcome.  I hope that with A DANCE WITH DRAGONS we will see a much more pointed effort to bring all of thestorylines together, but we'll just have to wait and see.<br /><br />Regardless, for fans of A Song of Ice and Fire, A FEAST FOR CROWS is just one more step along this breathtaking journey through what is perhaps the most loved setting in all of fantasy literature.  Readers that claim they will never come back to Martin because they are so mad about this book can only justify their anger by admitting they loved the story so much that waiting for it to be completed is unbearable.  While I share the frustration of not knowing the rest of the story, I stilled loved reading nearly every page of this enormous tale up through this point.  And while I am in agony over not being able to pick up the next book immediately, it is a sort of exquisite agony that I only feel because the story is just so damn good.just have to wait and see.

B00003CXPD|5.0|Lots of people have reviewed this movie so I'll just say that I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.  I literally laughed out loud several times and there were a few tear jerking moments as well.  Just a note, the British curse on a whole different level so this movie is not for the little ones ;)
B000IONJH4|4.0|The cover art on this is the same as the DVD set that has both the Lynch and the Smithee versions.   However,  it does include the majority of the bonus materials from the DVD set although in standard resolution and not Hi Def.    That being said,  happy to have this in a HiDef format.
B0028DRGDQ|4.0|Unfortunately Hollywood is caught up in remakes and \\"reimaginings.\\" This is the movie remade as Quarantine in the US. If you're unafraid of sub- titles you'll love this movie (unsure as to whether the DVD will be dubbed) If you liked 28 Days/weeks and Dawn 2004 you should love this movie. The flipside is that if you have already seen Quarantine you may find this movie repetitive (a sad irony considering this is the original) Rec 2 is on the way, I guess I'll have to \\"find\\" that one online first since they seem unwilling to release a DVD in a timely manner.
B001TH16DI|5.0|To all the morons and hypocrites that rated this series months before it came out, based on lies and speculation, should be ashamed of themselves. I have just sat down over the last week and watched parts 1-6, and not only do they all look fantastic, but the audio quality was very very good as well. I have watched each Star Trek movie dozens of times each, and can honestly say this go around was by far the best.<br /><br />Yes, some of the movies look better than the rest, but so do other Blu Ray movies.<br /><br />It's a damn shame that people like yourselves get on the internet and bad mouth people and things without any motive but to harm.<br /><br />SO, TO THOSE THAT ARE LOOKING TO BUY THESE MOVIES IGNORE THE NEGATIVE MORONS THAT REVIEWED THEM MONTHS AGO!!! The Star Trek movies look fantastic and are alive and well in 2009.

B000I2MRHE|5.0|I bought this as a christmas gift for my daughters daycare center. My daughter has now out grown it but the younger kids still love it. It keeps them up off the floor so they can see all the little toys. It's really great product.
B001U0HBPQ|3.0|Overall, the costumes, make-up, special effects, and acting are all top notch, but the story line, which sounded so original, felt like it had been done before.      It started with an older lady narrating her young love story to her daughter, and I'm guessing the writer was watching Titanic when they thought up this premise.  However they must have changed the channel when they came up with a young naive child and his unconditionally loving mother.  He has trouble fitting in with other children.  They all look at him like he's different, except for young Jenny or whatever her name was.  At least the poor kid didn't have leg braces, instead he had arm braces and in almost a miracle he just wills himself out of them- it makes you want to yell `Walk Benjamin, Walk!'  Then he hangs out with adults, but still being at a child's mental state, seems to be a little slow but has a good trusting heart.  Later he meets a grumpy drinking Lieutenant, I mean Captain, and they work on boat a together.  They even fight in a battle with the Captain fulfilling Lieutenant Dan's original goal.  Also Kate/Jenny gets caught up in her artsy/hippy crowd and only comes back to Ben/Gump when an injury/sickness happens and he can take care of her.  Another coincidence occurs during a special moment when Brad sees his old lady friend on tv swimming.  It's the dyslectic version of Jenny seeing Gump running on tv.  And finally the writers must have changed channels again and the Notebook takes over- I'll leave it at that.    However, what ultimately swayed me away from this long movie was the main actresses who played Brad's love interests just weren't attractive.  Even though they are two of the best actresses out there, they just don't make good lovers on screen.  They weren't as bad as The Dark Knight's leading lady, but falling in love with the Notebook, Titanic, or Gump's leading ladies was much more desirable.  So overall I do not recommend buying this- a rental at best.  However if you think you'll like it based on previews, then you will probably like it.
B001AVEJ1Y|2.0|It seems that every time a young hotshot writer gets hold of an established SF franchise, the first thing they do is make wholesale changes - all in the name of \\"appealing to a younger audience\\".  Does that mean a younger audience can't appreciate an established franchise unless it's been suitably \\"dumbed down\\" for their consumption?  Yes, this was a very flashy, action-filled, exciting piece of mind candy.  You'll long remember the special effects after you've forgotten the storyline.    The characters haven't been updated - they've been completely perverted.  (Spock and Uhura? Gimme a break.) It's also obvious the writers don't know their science - or don't care.  (A black hole is not a rip in the space-time continuum - it's a solid object with a gravitation field powerful enough to suck in everything around it, including light, thus giving the APPEARANCE of a hole.)  Mr. Roddenberry must be turning over in his grave.
0143036556|1.0|This pompous person, i.e., liberal professor, makes silly assumptions and writes them in a bombastic style.  The usual professorial position is taken: you must think as I think or you are demented, stupid and/or dangerous.     And to make his whole pontifical tone more annoying, it is poorly edited and poorly proofread.  For the price, I would have thought someone could have at least used grammar checker.    I am glad I didn't pay for it.  I have thrown the book away to be sure that at least one copy of his pretentious, superficial tripe goes no further.

B0007TKH66|4.0|To my disappointment as a fan of Star Trek since the 60's television series and as a 30 years plus expat the Enterprise series was not picked up by overseas and international television broadcasters I could view as were the original series, STNG, Voyager and Deep Space Nine (being re-run, re-run and re-run). So I was very happy when I stumbled on a set of the second season of Enterprise in a local DVD outlet. Although I am old and jaded I enjoyed the set so turned to Amazon to order more. I thought I would start with the first season and am glad I did. The first season lacks the sophistication of the second season but episodes like \\"Acquisition\\" have been enjoyable watches nevertheless. My only disappointment is not with this series but with the outrageous price increase in the product since April when I ordered the first season. Prices have been hiked from US$37.49 for each season to US$56.99 for the 3rd season and US$44.99. Ouch! Why? Gouge? Not a smart marketing strategy to increase prices over 50% in a shrinking global economy.

0385340575|3.0|I love Jack Reacher and I enjoyed this book, however, I have a complaint.  Why is it obligatory for Jack to have sex with someone in every book?  He's not down and dirty homeless, but he doesn't seem to be too far from it, either.  He carries a toothbrush in his pocket and wears the same clothes for days.  Most women (men, too, for that matter) are not going to be turned on by that, however many times he saves their lives.    Just ONCE, it would be nice if Jack or the obligatory woman said, \\"No, thanks.\\"
B001QTXM5Y|5.0|this had to be one of the best films i'd ever seen. for anyone who didn't like it just remember that things could've been SO much worse. originally when Warner Bros. picked the project up they obviously had no idea about the subject matter. when they contacted Zack Snyder to direct they wanted a film that was 2hrs long, pg-13, and the villian would be killed at the end by Nite Owl by crushing him with his airship, and then saying some cool y-line catch phrase. that sounds like a complete nightmare. it would've been the worse comic book adaption EVER made. but no Snyder's love for the original graphic novel prevailed and now we have the resulting masterpiece. true things were dropped and others added but hey that's movie making for you. Snyder's changes for the most part however seemed to add to the experience. critics said it was not a dark as the graphic novel and seemed brightly lit, i thought quite the contrare. i believed the comic's bright colors seemed to take away from it actually. now a warning for audiences it will be drastically more violent than the graphic novel, filled with highly stylized action, and gorey at times but served as the perfect eye candy for the impatient viewer who are usually unwilling to sit through a 162 minute run time. now everybody remember that the film and graphic novel are two totally different entities and should be regarded as such. don't be watching the movie expecting a carbon copy of the comic, be ready for something fresh, suprising, and original. the film is not a complete landmark in cinema in terms of story, the comic book already did that, but it's style and visual it gets full points.  i highly recommend it to anyone who wants to see one of the best pieces of cinema of the 21st century. on a seperate note that has nothing to do with the finished work itself i personally like the case, but that silver bar at the top doesn't match the color scheme and takes away from it a little bit.

055350259X|5.0|\\"Sunburned Country\\" is one fantastic audio book. I had no idea what I was in for, knowing very little about Australia, but Mr. Bryson's descriptions of his excellent adventures back and forth across the continent/country down under were VERY enlightening. I've grown to be very fond of his audio books, which he narrates himself. His distintive style and unique Iowegian/British accent add much color and interest to his recitations. His observances and opinions make for a super listen. I now want to visit Aussie-Land for myself!
B00005N6KG|5.0|I think these are the world's best headphones, in this weight-class and price-class. I feel these are terribly under-priced by Sony. I've been using this for the last 5 years, with very frequent rough handling, and they refuse to die. Sound quality is excellent. You could wear this the entire day and you won't feel a thing. For this price, just buy it, even if you don't plan to use it. Who knows, Sony might discontinue this product and you might see a need for such great/light headphones in the future.

B001ACH4DS|2.0|Maybe it's a product of age, but I just don't hear what all the five star reviewers are raving about. I watched Season 7 -- which I think had the most talented contestants ever- and I loved David Cook.  But I can't listen to this CD.  All the songs sound the same, and what they sound like isn't a vocalist but a lot of mashed, overloud, overpowering \\"accompaniment\\".  In my opinion, all current pop is heavily overproduced, until it hardly matters who is singing. Here, what does it matter that it's David Cook, since almost any singer would sound the same, smothered by all that processed generic accompaniment.

B001G55JEK|5.0|In my opinion it is perhaps the creepiest vampire movie ever made. It arrived at my doorstep in perfect condition, like it was promised and I was pleased with it enough that I have viewed it three times already. The effects are alittle grainy, because it is an old movie, but it does not take away from the overall effect of it. The movie is silent, but the music added is more than enough to keep your attention going. I wholly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys older films or are interested in the history of the vampire genre.
B002962RKE|5.0|GLEE is simply amazing!<br /><br />Outstanding writing; incredible cast (Jane Lynch is superb); well-edited and paced, too.<br /><br />The concept of the \\"underdog\\" is so meaningfully written here.  Sorta' in the FREEKS & GEEKS mode.  Writing with some \\"meat\\" on its bones.<br /><br />The nerds, the geeks, the overachiever, the minority groups, the bullies and those that are bullied, the soul-less cheerleaders and their \\"sociopathic\\" advisor, the jocks, a marriage in trouble, the truly idealistic (underpaid/underappreciated) teacher, underfunded school programs - all here.<br /><br />As mentioned, so well-written and acted.  I found so many characters for whom to root.  And a few to loath.  We need some of those.  So necessary in a good plot!<br /><br />Fabulous use of music!!!  Just enough.  Not too much.  Seems natural to me.  I did NOT get the \\"Cop Rock\\" vibe - if you know what I mean. And any show that integrates Journey's \\"Don't Stop Believing\\" has got my vote. (grins)!  That last number was fabulous. (I've watched it three times already. grins.)<br /><br />I'll be there this fall, hoping with my fingers crossed that this little gem succeeds.<br /><br />I have every cable channel on the planet, but, IMO, we NEED more quality broadcast programs.<br /><br />As a woman and former HS English and media teacher (now retired), I may or may not be the demographic that GLEE is trying to reach.<br /><br />However, I think the many relevant issues (relationships/teen issues/bullying/self-esteem/sacrifice/loyalty/doing the right thing & more) addressed in this heartfelt \\"dramedy\\" are universal.<br /><br />Please give GLEE some \\"love\\"!!<br /><br />You just might be glad you did.
0385341008|4.0|This book is a little like finding a box of letters in your great-grandmother's attic from just after the war, and reading them through.  That is, if your great-grandmother and her friends were clever and entertaining letter writers, and had lived in Europe through the WWII.<br /><br />Summary: The Guernsey Potato Peel society is a book club that emerged during the war while Guernsey was under German occupation.  It's members make up an odd assortment of characters whose personalities emerge as they share their war tales and the light they found in this dark time with each other through their letters to Juliet. Juliet, a writer, is enchanted by them and their stories and they by her. She delves into thier lives as she searches find her place in the post-war world.<br /><br />Upsides & Minor Downsides:<br />This is a light, but enjoyable tale - particularly given the war-related subject. The letters, which communicate the story, are filled with hope and occassionally even laugh-out-loud fun.  The letters between Juliet and the Society convey the tale of the German occupation of Guernsey well (something I wasn't all that familiar with). But, relying upon them as a literary device also means that much of the real nuances of the characters go left underdeveloped.  That's a shame for such a character driven, romantic tale.<br /><br />One can't help but not like main character Juliet - she is foremost a fellow-book lover.  And, I imagine that almost anyone who belongs to a book club that comes together as much for their enjoyment of each other as for books is going to love this book.  For me, though, as much as I enjoyed it - I didn't enjoy it as much as these less fluffy, but equally woman oriented other WW II tales: [[ASIN:0375842209 The Book Thief]] or [[ASIN:0312370849 Sarah's Key]].<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: A nice, enjoyable - if light - tale of a dark period combined with an interesting approach that devoted book club members are sure to find enjoyable.
B00164KYV4|2.0|This is the part (once I really get into the meat of the review) where the desperate to wed or clingy, why isn't he calling me types are going to string me up by my over 30 and beat the bs statistic married shoestrings. First of all the actors/actresses they picked for this movie were fantastic, and the title literally explains a perfectly logical point that He (or even she) Is Not That Into You. When I caught it on Sex & he City, it was genius. Of course! It makes sense....we all have had people in our lives that we liked, but didn't have that kind of chemistry with. They usually fell into friend zone. I think society puts too much emphasis that people of the opposite sex can not be friends and can only date. What's wrong with just hanging out and getting to know someone? Given my experience, I think we should be friends first and foremost. At least than either something blossoms from it or doesn't, but can if it's going to happen without the ridiculous presser people put on themselves to be with someone (anyone). And this movie certainly sells the same heaping spoonful that everyone has to have someone, even if they settle. I'll give a brief bio of the characters as part of my review as the movie itself is hard to describe otherwise.<br /><br />Ginnifer Goodwin (Gigi) who we know from Big Love, is a delightful person you just want to layer in bubble wrap in hopes to keep her hopeless puppy heart from being broken. She clings to the phone in dire almost painful neediness, and eventually grows frustrated with the language and games people play.<br /><br />Scarlett Johansson....oh the lovely married to Ryan Reynolds in real life Scarlett...her character Anna is one we all want to hate. I myself wanted to run into this character in real life and slap her in her pretty face, tether her to my rear bumper by her lengthy blond locks, and drag her a few miles across uneven terrain. Without ruining it for you, in case you are going to watch this regardless of the reviews, I'll just say this....she's a beautiful manipulative, pouty siren who, in her own twisted logic way, is looking for love in all the completely wrong places.<br /><br />Drew Barrymore plays a wonderful little part; always quirky and with a little comic relief. But you only get bits and pieces of her. Eventually, in a round about way, she gets what she's looking for and we're happy for her.<br /><br />Jennifer Anniston and Ben Affleck play a couple that have been together for years (over 5), living together in a great apartment, building a life until one day Beth (Anniston) has gotten it in her head that they need to be married. I'll tell you right now the long, pointless dance they play out was utterly predicable. I annoyed my girl friend sitting next to me (as I wasn't going to drag my fianc&eacute; at the time to this piece of chickflick), bursting out with each accurate prediction.Tiring drama.<br /><br />Jennifer Connelly and Bradley Cooper play another couple whom have been married for a little while, having undertaken the arduous ordeal of renovating an old house. I won't even begin to elucidate the complicated, disturbed, deep-rooted psychological/other issues between this couple other than go Janine! (Jennifer Connelly) towards the end of the movie.<br /><br />Overall the movie should be seen more as a dark comedy or drama rather than a romantic one. My friend and I left (she's married and I engaged at the time and both having dated in the past obviously) with this horribly somber feeling that we were unable to express in words until days later. I was depressed and pitying, upset, and felt the characters in general were sad and utterly, self destructively unhappy. I get it's just a movie, based off a tag line, based off a book, etc...however the movie didn't do the point justice. More like promoted that if you are desperate enough, clingy enough, or demanding enough, you'll get what you want or get something you thought you wanted and realized you settled or pushed for something unnaturally against instinct from your partner. I was disappointed with the plot and certain aspects of pointless drama.rom your partner. I was disappointed with the plot and certain aspects of pointless drama.
0375826726|2.0|The first book was ok. Even that it had similarities with Star Wars, even that it had actions that made you think .... WHY?? it was short and ok to read.    The second book was LONG and booooring. I mean, it was SOOOOOOOoo boring.    Ok the 3rd book is out. The price is even higher that the other books. Yea yea it's a best seller.    So what do we get? An even longer book. A book that attacks your intelect. Stupid dialogs. The only interesting part of the book are the last 50 pages.    Eragon it's still an %%#hole. Yea his a teenager. That's how teenagers behave. But come on. YOU (eragon) are an KNIGHT. You have power. People put your hopes in you and you are still an arogant prick. People tell you don't behave as you should but YOU STILL don't listen.    If you are maximum 15 years old, or this is the only book you'v read, this is an awasome book. If not, you will just get anoyed. VERY anoyed.    I'm not going to give up exact examples because of spoilers, but you will see dialogs like this:    - Hey. Let me heal your wounds!  - No. There are others who may need help.  - But man! Look at your wounds. It will only take a ...  - I SAID NO! Leave me alone!  - But look at you!  - Ok but do it fast.    --------    Belive me. You will read something like this in the book.  It seems everyone is a prick in this book. They all defy superior's orders.    Not to mention this is the type of the book you know GOOD will win. It's just a mather of time.    I don't feel like there is WAR. Galbatorix can attack in any moment. They can attack and YOU KNOW you are not prepared. Nooo. They have time to love. They have time to obey orders. They have time to QUESTION the orders. I bet they know they will win anyway.    P.S. For the people who praise the last 50 pages. Yea. They weare nice. But 50 pages are not 760 pages.
B001RQ0SJO|4.0|While Bat For Lashes' debut CD remains the better of the two, this sophomore disc sees no slump. It retains the more whimsical, ethereal elements of the first disc, and adds more production and 'trip-hop' to the proceedings, so it has a personality all its' own. This is both a good and a bad thing.<br /><br />For one, the *special* something that Khan displayed on her debut disc is rarely witnessed on this one. Primarily, this is due to the overkill on production, where every good tune is dressed up unnecessarily. While this works well in a given context, such as \\"Daniel\\", which sounds like a 1980s dance track redux, it fails on songs where the production should actually take a backseat (\\"Glass\\", especially). \\"Glass\\", which opens the album, is the best cut on the LP, but also the most disappointing in the sense that this deserved to sound more pared down and low-fi.<br /><br />And that big-budget sentiment is precisely the sort of thing that ruins \\"Two Suns\\". Any Bat for Lashes record can't really be bad, by default, but this one is soaked in instrumentation and Natasha's voice sounds oddly processed. Soon, you start wishing for the simplicity of such songs as \\"Whats a Girl to Do?\\" (there is nothing here as remotely catchy as that track, by the way), and the tranquil quality of \\"Tahiti\\" from the first record is missing as well. This is a pity because those were the songs that defined Natasha, and a little more of that would have gone a long way.<br /><br />This is still a superb collection of songs, but I suppose Bat for Lashes had to give in to their own hype and create something 'mass market' sounding. For some reason, its impossible to think of this as an indie record, and makes you wish that the band stayed low key. But perhaps its just a personal thing. I had the same reaction with Bon Iver's second album (\\"Blood Bank\\" EP). Some artists make their best records when they're unknown, and to me, Khan seems to be one of those.<br /><br />A pretty good record, but certainly not worthy of the extravagant praise. Save it for My Brightest Diamond, a truly underrated artist.vagant praise. Save it for My Brightest Diamond, a truly underrated artist.

B001GKYBXA|5.0|I'm sure most people will point to Band on the Run as Paul's best, but for me, this is the one album that I can listen to from start to finish without skipping tracks or fast forwarding.  The whole album has such a cool, loose groove.  There are some great individual tracks, of course, such as Nothing Too Much Just Out of Sight (which he sings the crap out of)and Sing the Changes.  And those last 5 tracks, from Lifelong Passion through Don't Stop Running---it's just the coolest music he's done since...ever?  Yeah, Paul, let your freak flag fly!  I love this!!
B000003TAL|3.0|After listening to Daydream Nation a bunch of times over the years, I've come to the conclusion that the importance of this album--and the work of Sonic Youth in general--has been overstated. I downloaded a couple of their others recently (Sister & Dirty) and they seemed about the same to me.  I'd probably enjoy Sonic Youth more if it weren't for the exaggerated credit that they have been given--they are described as \\"groundbreaking\\", when they were in actuality a typical artsy post-punk band treading on familiar territory. Their droning riffs sound similar to Joy Division and other bands of the early eighties; their much-ballyhooed guitar effects are not very different from the feedback and distortion that other musicians had messed around with for 20 years before them; their vocals and lyrics are their weakest points--they sound like spoiled brats trying desperately to sound subversive. In spite of all this, they are kind of fun to listen to and they do play together well, with an appealing, fat sound--but I wish people would be a bit more judicious with their praise.
B000W7JWUA|2.0|I found the  board pieces very flimsy and of poor quality material for the price. The hexagonal pieces kept sliding under the framework! This made the initial set-up very time-consuming. Then the rules of play were not as \\"simple\\" and clear as the gamemaker led one to believe. There are far too many little pieces that if you loose a few you probably can't play this game!! Perhaps after you struggle through it a few times and have plenty of time, it might be as good as it's rated.

B001MS7IBS|5.0|There have already been a great deal of reviews about the show so I won't say much in regards to the show itself.  It got off to a rocky start and the first few episodes just didn't click with me.  However, by mid-season this show started firing on all cylinders.  The various plot lines from each episode that seemed to be self-contained stories, started to congeal into an overall mythology which we'll follow throughout the rest of the show.  I give this show my highest recommendation!    One quick side note.  FOX decided to run a new \\"remote-free TV\\" initiative with Dollhouse and Fringe.  This meant that the commercial times were cut in half, effectively adding about 6 minutes of air time for each show.  This adds up to an extra 120 minutes of airtime throughout the season, so the 20 episodes of season 1 are really more like 22 1/2 if compared to other shows on TV.

B001AVEJ1Y|4.0|Having never seen the TV show, I can't really say if the movie follows established Star Trek mythology or not. What I can say, however, is that it is extremely entertaining, at times sad, and at times funny, with solid story, great special effects and memorable characters. I will definitely watch a sequel if it is ever made.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|What a gorgeous sensory experience.  The movie walked the careful line between rewarding die-hard fans while still attracting a new generation.  I just went to see it for the 2nd time with our friends who were not Star Trek fans until now.  It is well written, has many subtle moments of comedy, and I cannot wait for the sequel that everyone knows is coming.    The only weak point I noticed was the sound track.  Its use of the \\"evil music\\" versus the \\"federation music\\" was a tad over-the-top.  In a few moments, I felt the music was redundant and did not fit the scene.    Still a 5 star film notwithstanding.
0142410705|4.0|Colin Singleton is a child prodigy who is looking to make his mark on the world. Graduating high school, Colin feels like his one significant mark made on the world by his genius was appearing on a cable game show and winning big for several days running. Colin is looking to make his mark and prove he's the genius that he deep down, yearns to be.<br /><br />In his life, Colin has dated 19 women--all of them named Katherine. After being dumped for the nineteenth time, Colin decides there must be a mathematical theorem that will predict the future of all relationships. In the midst of this, Colin is sulking and taken on a road-trip to Gutshot, Tennessee (not their original destination, but they end up there).<br /><br />The hook of \\"An Abundance of Katherines\\" is an intriguing one. Looking at the cover, it'd be easy to assume this was a novel about cloning. Instead, it's a coming-of-age story for Colin and his best friend, Hassan. Colin's desperation to prove himself--not only as a genius but also to the Katherine XIX (as she's known in the novel)--is a fascinating journey. The novel does hit some predictable markers for a young adult story, but John Green hits them with such refreshing honesty and nicely done characters that you won't really mind that much.
B001TK3XO0|5.0|This book shook me out of complacence and broke my heart several times. His writing was powerful enough to make me fall in love with and hate the characters like they were in my own life. Heart-wrenching and powerful... it is one of those books you must read.
0930289234|5.0|Frankly, I've always looked down on comic books and graphic novels. That is until I saw \\"Watchmen\\" - the movie that amazed me by its complexity and cleverness.  Needless to say, I just had to see what kind of material it was based on. I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />Let me start by saying that I though the movie did this book justice, especially visually. But reading this graphic novel just added an entire new layer to the story, making it even deeper and more complex than I thought it was. The characters of Dr. Manhattan, Ozymandias, Rorschach, and even Comedian were original and unforgettable. Bravo! - is all I can say. Highly recommend.

B001AVEJ1Y|4.0|Allow me to preface this review by saying that I'm not a huge fan of Star Trek.  I don't hate it by any stretch, but the sheer volume of information in the Star Trek [[ASIN:0671536095 lexicon]] is both intimidating and exhausting.  I do absolutely adore science fiction and I know full well Star Trek's place and significance within the genre.  It was perhaps even more palpable to viewers like me that the 2009 re-boot of the original iconic crew of the USS Enterprise be placed in the very capable hands of a hugely imaginative filmmaker; J.J. Abrams.  Abrams is admittedly not a hardcore fan of the series either, but he clearly respects the stories greatly, and I think that gave him both the ability to take risks with these characters as well as celebrate them effectively.  He clearly brought a team as well, and is at his most generative.  Abrams will likely please hardcore fans as he surrounded himself with informative writers, but they will also please the mainstream fans, while at the same time making money and leaving the chance to create endless sequels wide open for himself, or the rest of Hollywood to indulge on.  As a film Star Trek is indulgent, but its science fiction is fantastic and its seamless visual effects are some of the best I've ever seen.<br /><br />I'm not going to get bogged down by summarizing the story here in order to avoid both spoilers and going off on too many details.  The film works as an origins tale with new actors playing the original crew.  Little known actor Chris Pine plays Captain James T. Kirk as the film's primary character, and does very well for himself in a role that will probably be under tremendous scrutiny.  The film keeps focus on his meeting other crew members such as Leonard McCoy (Karl Urban), Pavel Chekov (Anton Yelchin), Hikaro Sulu (John Cho), and of course Scotty (Simon Pegg), but primarily focuses on Kirk's interactions with the film's other protagonist; Spock.  In my humble opinion Spock is portrayed brilliantly by Zachary Quinto (who plays the villain in television's [[ASIN:B000QDLSR0 Heroes]]).  To top it off the film has an outstanding Romulan villain named Captain Nero, played by the always solid Eric Bana.  There are nearly endless supporting roles filled quite eloquently by other known and talented actors and actresses.  This really is a huge production, but it is by no means wasteful.<br /><br />So I am definitely recommending this, and the only reason I gave it four instead of five stars is because of a few gratuitous scenes included as comic relief that rubbed me the wrong way but are more or less forgivable.  As far as how it compares to the other [[ASIN:B001TH16DI Star Trek films?]]  I found moderate charm in some of those films and I have great reverence for [[ASIN:B0000683DH The Wrath of Khan]] specifically, but it's just not even a contest.  This is a different era of visual filmmaking.  I would imagine hardcore fans are pleased but I can't say for sure as I never read other reviews before writing my own, where I know for certain the mainstream appeal is absolutely undeniable.  I'm just thankful this is a fiercely clever film that just also happens to attract the masses.y Quinto (who plays the villain in television's [[ASIN:B000QDLSR0 Heroes]]).

B001GCUO16|3.0|This highly-anticipated addition to the \\"X-Men\\" franchise was pretty much a disappointment. Yes, sure it was watchable (mainly due to some decent special effects), but just barely. The story was so choppy and unfocused, it was very hard to stay interested or care. The mutants were boring and uninspired (was it really the best the comics universe could offer?)  Probably the best part was the first 5 minutes where Wolverine's and Sabertooth's militant past was captured. After that, the movie felt like a patchwork of random events assembled to tie this movie to the rest of X-Men franchise. Unfortunately, even Hugh Jackman with his chiseled chest couldn't salvage this mess of a movie.
0385340575|4.0|The one-star reviews, with one exception, are all complaints about the Kindle price being over 9.99; these should be segregated since they are irrelevant to the merits of the book as a book. On THAT topic, the book itself, the news is good; whereas the previous book in the series (I've read them all) was a seriously below par effort, the first weak Reacher story, Childs has got his act back together again. Since I read John Sandford's latest Davenport story in the same week, I will say that the latter strikes me as a better crafted book--more plausible, for one thing--but they are both very good of the genre (action/crime/mystery/hero).
0385340575|5.0|Frankly, the Reacher series was getting very predictable and was basically formula writing.  Perhaps Mr. Child realized this and decided to one again write a novel with depth, suspense and excellent characterization.  If you're a Reacher fan, you will not be disappointed and if you've never read anything in the series, this is an excellent stand alone novel.

B001U0HBQ0|4.0|While this film is Fincher's most ambitious work, it is flawed and doesn't always connect with the heart.  That being said, this is still a stunning work with visual images that haunted me months after seeing it.  Fincher's framing is (as expected) stunning and the effects blow your mind.  I'm not a Brad Pitt lover, but I feel he deserved the Oscar nod for his amazingly detailed performance.  Alexandre Desplat's score was last years best (and one of the most interesting in recent memory), and the rest of the cast and production values are top notch.<br /><br />I just received my Blu-ray copy last week and have only had time to watch the documentaries.  As is ALWAYS the case with a Fincher film AND Criterion discs, this set is STUNNING.  Some of the most interesting and smartly-crafted documentaries I've seen.  I've peeked at the film, and not only are picture & sound as perfect as ever, Criterion's TIMELINE feature is AWESOME!  You can jump to specific dates in the story with this feature, and Fincher's audio commentary is also broken down by headings!  If only the rest of the DVD/Blu-ray world would spend this amount of thought on their products.<br /><br />Highly recommended.  Again, the film is flawed, but still one of last year's most thought-provoking and powerful pictures.

0385341008|5.0|I truly loved this book.  Epistolary style is quite unusual and often boring but this one pull it off cleverly.  The characters were a hoot.  And I felt they were developed for the time span of the story.  I loved this book so much I bought a copy of it for each of the people in my book club.  We have decided to have it next November.  A book to remember and one to be thankful for.

B001UGIRF8|5.0|For those who aren't familiar with Genesis prior to \\"Mama\\" and \\"Invisible Touch\\" (or even \\"Follow You, Follow Me\\"): there was a time (1970-1975) when they were the most original progressive rock band around. During this time they were fronted by lead singer/flautist/bass drummer Peter Gabriel; whose throaty voice and mind-blowing costumes only enhanced the already incredible music being created by Tony Banks, Mike Rutherford, and (as of \\"Nursery Cryme\\") Steve Hackett and Phil Collins. This boxed album set contains new vinyl versions of the Peter Gabriel-era Genesis: \\"Trespass\\", \\"Nursery Cryme\\", \\"Foxtrot\\", \\"Selling England By The Pound\\", and what many consider their masterwork: the 2-disc album \\"The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway\\". I have had all these albums since they first came out (and of course they are now in shreds from hundreds of playing plus the fact that I was a teenager at the time).    So why not just get the CDs and be happy? I do have the CDs. I thought I was happy. Then I heard about this boxed set, and what intrigued me even more than the 180 gram audiophile vinyl, the half-speed mastering, and the near-exact recreation of the albums covers and artwork, was the fact that they were not just re-mastered, they were re-mixed! Nick Davis, a well-known prog-rock engineer, actually re-created these albums from their multi-track reels.    How do they sound? Incredible, for the most part. For one thing, you can hear the drums! The original albums had, more often than I liked, shoved Phil's drumming toward the back. His drumming was one of the things that made this stuff so great, so having it clear and up front is wonderful. Aside from that, there are a handful of places where a slightly different effect, like a reverb or delay, was used; not sure if these were artistic decisions or if the original effect was no longer available. Having heard these albums so many times, it's easy to hear when something has been changed. But overall, say 98% of the time, I'm happywith the changes. For those I don't, well, it's all a matter of taste, right?    Anyway, it's like taking a trip back to my teens putting on this vinyl (and hearing no crackles) and listening to the most amazing prog-rock of its time recaptured on its original media. I'll be enjoying these records for years to come.

0330449605|3.0|Frankly, I don't see what all the hype is about regarding this novel.  Its popularity this spring and the fact it is a bestseller is surprising to me.  It is not a bad book, but it is far from rating 5 stars in my personal opinion.  The time jumping did not work for me.  One chapter is Cassandra in 2005, the next chapter is Nell in 1975, then Eliza in 1900, then Nell in 1913, and even Adeline in 19 something.  I began to grow confused as to who was who and who had done what or discovered what in what year.  There are a lot of female characters within this family that the book talks about.  Nell, a woman that was abandoned on a ship when she was four and rescued and adopted in Australia. Cassandra, Nell's granddaughter who is trying to finish the search for Nell's natural family now that Nell is dead.  And the most entertaining of them all, Eliza and Rose, the ancestors of Nell and Cassandra that resided in the early 1900s.  I could have completely done without Cassandra and just enjoyed a shorter novel about Eliza and Rose. The ending was not as much of a shocker as I was hoping for.  Majority of readers will have it figured out halfway thru the novel. To sum it up, not a bad book, but not worth 16 bucks.  Check it out of the library.

0743277708|5.0|Watership Down is a wonderful story for kids and adults alike.  Richard Adams tells the adventures of a group of rabbits forced to leave their home and strike out into unknown lands to build a new warren.  The story is told from the perspective of the rabbits, each of whom has a personality all their own, with strengths and weaknesses.  We're introduced to the rabbits' language, customs and culture, and we get to hear some of their own legends of mythical heroes throughout the book.  Adams does a great job of writing from an animal point of view, where man-made things are strange and mysterious, surroundings are explored from the ground with sight and smell, and we feel the rabbits' fear of larger animals and \\"elil\\" (rabbit predators).    The story itself has a good rhythm, alternating fast paced action with slow paced descriptions, with an exciting ending and an epilogue that brings the tale to a satisfying close but leaves you wanting more.    Highly recommended.

0385340575|2.0|I was an avid Reacher fan until Nothing To Lose.  In that book, Jack Reacher became Lee Child: weak, whining, touchy-feely.  I swore off the series in memory of what the series originally was, but broke down when I saw it on the discount shelf at Sam's Club.    Should have left it there.      Reacher needs to go down like the man he was early in the series, and Child needs to move on.
0743298039|3.0|We read this book for my book club.  I feel that over all it was fairly average.  Wasn't a great book, but was worth the read.  It was different than many of the books I've read and therefore was at times interesting.  I think the author was a little long winded at getting to the point/plot of the story, but that could be related to one of her main characters Ms. Winter.  If she were real, she is the type of person I would expect to be long winded.  She was after all telling her whole life's story.    There were a few good twists at the end of the book which I won't spoil for you.  However, there were entire portions of this book that I could have done without.  Very good writing, a bit verbose, but again worth the read.  If you are looking for something new to read and don't have any favorites on your reading list I would recommend this book.
B000FC10MU|4.0|Gaiman takes on a weighty subject but he turns it into a funny, dark, and all-around enjoyable novel. Mythology and tradition inform much of our day-to-day lives and American Gods ponders what happens to those beliefs as they evolve and old gods are forgotten. The book is full of surprises and weirdness. In other words, this is the perfect vacation book. It's ambitious but not too heavy and, for all of its wanderings, reads quickly. If you like Neil Gaiman's other work, you will like this.
0061122416|5.0|I was actually assigned this book for a business class.  This was a very quick read.  Not since childhood had I read such an interesting parable.  And since reading this book I've only read one other, The Five People You Meet in Heaven.     I have not read any of Coelho's other works, so I do not know if this is typical of his other writing.  This book is excellently written, which each character and scene portrayed in great detail yet using few words.  As the review states this book is truly \\"dazzling in its simplicity and wisdom.\\"    While searching for buried treasure, the main character Santiago learns valuable life lessons and ultimately finds himself.  I would recommend this book to college graduates.  It demonstrates the power of following your heart, trusting your intuition, and not just getting caught up in seeking monetary treasure.      This book will make you think and reflect. A must read for any age, but particularly those embarking on a new path.

B002436WJE|4.0|One of the most exciting and interesting movies to be released in the first-half of 2009, TAKEN is a thrilling movie about one father's journey to rescue his daughter from Eastern European kidnappers who intend to sell her as a sex slave to the highest bidder. Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) is a retired CIA special ops man who has recently moved so that he can be closer to his teenage daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace) who is living with his ex-wife (Famke Janssen) and her wealthy stepfather (Xander Berkeley). Bryan loves his daughter deeply, but feels disconnected from her and because of the posh lifestyle she is currently living. He is concerned that she might be loosing her way. When Kim is presented with an opportunity to travel with a friend to Paris for the summer, Bryan is against the idea. His work with the CIA have taught him how dangerous it is for young women to be traveling alone across Europe. Besides that, Kim is underage and her protective mother and stepfather have been overprotective and sheltered her from any knowledge of the real dangers of the world. However, after being reassured of Kim and her traveling companion, Amanda's (Katie Cassidy), supervision by a family in Paris, that there would not be any globe-trotting alone, and Kim's promise that she would call her father every day, he consents to let her go. It is only later that he learns the girls aren't going for any sort of educational reason, but to be a band groupie following a particular group on their European tour. Bryan is furious, but is still trying to reconnect and against his better judgment allows her to go.<br /><br />Upon arriving in Paris, Amanda & Kim are met by a handsome, young Frenchmen who invites them to a party later that night and rides with them to the place where they will be staying. Kim is a bit unsettled by the many, but Amanda is smitten with lust. Upon arriving at the residence Kim is shocked to discover that Amanda wasn't being completely honest with her either because the family they are to stay with are gone for most of the summer and the girls will be left on their own. Shortly after, while talking to her father on the phone, Kim watches Amanda being abducted and sees the men coming for her. It turns out the man at the airport was the frontman for a group of individuals who make a fortune from kidnapping young foreign women, addicting them to drugs, and then selling them as sex slaves. Bryan tells Kim what to do and she obeys his every command right up until the point she is taken herself. Knowing that he has right around 48 hours to find his daughter before she is lost from him forever, Bryan begins calling in some favors and takes a personal jet of his wife's husband to Paris and begins looking for his daughter and hunting down the criminals who have taken her.<br /><br />TAKEN is an action-packed movie that doesn't really stop once it starts. The first 15 minutes or so of the film are expositional in nature to introduce the audience to the characters, but from the moment that the kidnappers break into the Paris home until almost the very end of the picture, the movie is non-stop action. Liam Neeson is a wonderful actor and I have yet to see him give a bad performance.<br /><br />Besides just being a good action movie, TAKEN also examines some subject matter that most Americans are unaware but should become more familiar. There are some coincidences in the movie used for dramatic purposes, but the portrayal of how the women in the movie are abused and victimized isn't just startling, but is also quite accurate. The kidnapping and selling of women as sex slaves is something that does happen and in some parts of the world has almost become common.<br /><br />Overall, I found TAKEN to be a very good movie. There are certain parts of the plot that are predictable, but the movie is action packed and makes for an afternoon or evening of enjoyable viewing. It's also a movie that any parent with a daughter should watch.<br /><br />The two-disc version of the movie includes both cuts of the movie (PG-13 & Unrated versisons), two commentary tracks, a making of featurette &#34;Le Making Of&#34;, a video of the movie's premier entitled &#34;Avant Premiere&#34;, a featurette that illustrates how some of the action scenes were made, and some trailers.wo-disc version of the movie includes both cuts of the movie (PG-13 & Unrated versisons), two commentary tracks, a making of featurette &#34;Le Making Of&#34;, a video of the movie's premier entitled &#34;Avant Premiere&#34;, a featurette that illustrates how some of the action scenes were made, and some trailers.
044022425X|2.0|This book is just not as good.  I loved Claire's story with Jamie.  And for that reason, Outlander is still my absolute favorite in this series, and one of my all-time favorite books. Unfortunately, as the series has progressed, Claire's story has become lost.    This book was primarily about Brianna and Roger, who are flat characters and not that interesting.  The manner in which the perspectives switched from Claire's first person narration to third person with everyone else interrupted the flow of the book and was annoying.      Furthermore, the plot was not as exciting as the other three books I have read thus far.  I think I would recommend stopping at Voyager (with the caveat that I haven't read Fiery Cross or Breath of Snow and Ashes).
0312370849|4.0|having just returned from paris, i found the story to be especially fascinating. i admit that i had no knowledge of the events that had unfolded there in 1942. this book was a powerful and haunting reminder of how complex and at the same time primitive humans can be. it is a good reminder to treasure every moment that we have our freedom.
B000021Y77|4.0|Good movie, a heart pumping punky kinda movie, with fun techno music to thread it all together, and fantastic acting!  This is a movie for independent film lovers, for sure.  I love this movie, but I would not watch this in the english dubbed version, the voice overs are so bad it's comical---well ok--watch that version if you want a good laugh.  I didn't even know they had a dubbed version till I bought this on DVD to replace my VHS.
B000002UB2|1.0|Do not read this review if you are interested in a CD version. I am reviewing vinyl reissue, but Amazon pushes reviews from different issues/versions together which causes a lot of confusion.    To start with - Abbey Road to me is one of the top 3 albums ever made. I only rated the vinyl re-issue.     I recently rediscovered vinyl after almost 2 decades of CD collecting, and I have to admit now that I wasted my time and money on almost 500-CD collection. Almost any vinyl record sounding so much better than a CD! I spent 350$ on a stand-alone CD player, and about the same for a brand new turntable (both hooked to same amplifier) - and the sound of the most recent remastered CD and vinyl pressing from before CD era of the same album is incomparable (in favor of vinyl). Please note - I am talking about the pre-CD era pressing.     Unfortunately, most of the recent re-issues on vinyl that I purchased are sounding pretty poor, even compared to a CD. Examples: Band on the Run (Capitol vaults) and Hot Rocks by Rolling Stones sound just like the CD versions, and Hard Day's Night, Let It Be and Abbey Road actually sound worse than 1987 CDs! Disappointment with Abbey Road was so big that I just returned it to the record shop for a fraction of the price, and bought the 1969 version of the vinyl instead, and it was definitely the best sounding version of Abbey Road I have ever heard. Bottom line - if you want a good vinyl of Abbey Road - stay away from this re-issue and try to find one of the earlier pressings (the earlier - the better, the price well worth it).    15September09 comment: just compared my 1969 vinyl with the 09.09.09 remaster of Abbey Road - the vinyl still sounds better - more clear and deeper than a remaster. However, if your choices are a new vinyl (the one I am revieweing here) or a remastered 09.09.09 CD - go with the CD.
0345479092|5.0|we call this book the Bible.  of course parenting ultimately comes from instinct and common sense, but this book helped direct us towards trusting our instincts, and helping us make a decision when we didn't have strong feelings one way or the other.  like any other baby book, with this one you have to take what you want and leave what you don't want.  we recommend this book over any other baby book, but we definitely didn't agree with everything she said or all of her very strong opinions.  what we liked most was how Tracy taught us to implement a predictable routine.  that way the baby knows what is coming next and is therefore at ease.  we all do better when we know whats coming next, don't we?  bottom line: best baby book, take what you want, leave what you don't want.
B00005JPTK|2.0|I'm not a huge fan of remakes, nor am I a fan of Will Smith, but I wanted to like this and went into viewing this movie with an open mind. First problem with this movie is Will Smith, he can not carry a movie by himself. If you're a fan of his, you'll probably love it, but not being a fan of his, I have to say he seriously lacks the chops to pull this off. Second massive issue is the horrendously awful CGI. The wide shots of the city look fine, but the lions in the beginning are just unbearably bad, and then when they finally show the vampires, that was just the final nail in the coffin for me. No pun intended. They just looked horrid, very poorly done. I watched both endings, and they were both very bland, the unrated theatrical version being the worst of the two. And while I have to say that the movie is very much watchable and not the worst thing to ever grace the silver screen, it needed a lot of improvement and a new lead actor to make it a worthwhile film.
0399247459|5.0|Loved it when I was a kid, and now so do my kids. Girls 2 & 3 years (bought this over a year ago) always love this book. They know the words by heart and love turning the food pages. If you don't have it yet, get it for your little ones!
B0019V9JCE|5.0|Read this book in college in the late 70's, early 80's, before it became the \\"cult\\" book of the 80's.  Excellent then, excellent now.  Relevant for managing staff, running a successful business, good customer service, as well as raising children with a personal sense of responsibility.  I recommend this book to everyone.
B000A2W1X2|5.0|I had watched this movie several times on t.v. and am very excited to add it to my collection. I think it is passionate and beautiful. However, as one of the other reviews said it isn't family friendly. The t.v. version has been edited. There is nudity/ sexual content in the film.  (more than I was prepared for) I think this movie should be rated R, but I believe it is a great love story. I am glad it is available on dvd but for those of you who are uncomfortable with nudity I would suggest you catch this one on t.v.
B0001HLVS2|5.0|I thought this is a movie for people who like action and also have an interest in observing effective, and ineffective leadership qualities in action.<br /><br />On the effective side, Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe), the captain of HMS Suprise,  shows the qualities of an effective leader in this movie -- respect for his men, the ability to administer discipline, kindness, intelligence, as well as the ability to think about all sides of an issue before taking action.  He demonstrates how to inspire others to give their all in pursuit of a worthy cause, and shows the effective use of humor to relate to others, without becoming too familiar.<br /><br />On the ineffective side, you see Hollum, one of Aubrey's midshipman, whose personal qualities and decisions make him an ineffective leader, disliked by the men, and garnering negative reviews from his captain.<br /><br />The action is great -- and the Captain's ploys, deceptions and battle plans to outsmart the captain of another ship are phenomenal and intelligent.  Out gunned by a newer enemy ship, with twice the men, more guns, and a hull that can't be penetrated, Aubrey comes up with a plan that exploits his own capabilities and capitalizes on the few weaknesses of his opponent.  The battle scene is great, as is the friendship and conflict between Aubrey and the ship's Doctor.<br /><br />I wish they'd made a sequel to this one -- or even a series.  I'd be a loyal fan....
B001IY27D0|5.0|This was the first Zombie book I've read.  I got started loving zombies thanks to video games like Resident Evil.  I took this book on a 9-Day vacation to Costa Rica with me, and we had lots of down time between the airport and bus rides around the country. I finished it before the flight back to the states. I'm a slow, thorough reader - but I've never read a book this size that fast! I couldn't stop because it was so good.
0143113100|3.0|The scientific content of this book is fascinating.  Fine.  But when the author started talking about blinding 3-week old kittens for scientific experiments--not to mention cracking open the skulls of endless numbers of monkeys, and crippling monkeys by giving them neurological damage, etc.--I got really irritated and quit reading.  He also slams PETA on several pages, so those of you who are animal rights supporters, beware.      The author is very supportive of (apparently) ALL animal experimentation, and actually gets pretty huffy and defensive about it later in the book.      Nonetheless, the science is interesting.  I'm not necessarily even stating my own perspective on animal experimentation--I'm just saying that his outright callousness toward it is offensive to me.  Hell, at least show some damn class by displaying the slightest freakin' compassion for sewing a baby kitten's eye shut in order to blind it.  WTF?
B001AVEJ1Y|4.0|As entertainment this reimagining of Star Trek delivers great action, and not a few surprises.  It's quite exciting to see the familiar characters being reintroduced and played by new actors.<br /><br />One hopes that Abrams who brought us Lost and Alias, and wrote space epic Armageddon will take the treasure that is Star trek, and boldly go where no one has gone before.  By that I do mean not going where he has gone with Lost, which now has me totally confused, with the myriad time travel plot lines, and who is the good guy and the bad guy, but going somewhere fresh, new and exciting.<br /><br />JJ Abrams has done a great job first time at bat with this franchise.<br />The actors who perform the lead roles Pine as Kirk, Quinto as Spock, and Urban as McCoy all do incredible jobs.  Karl Urban is McCoy.  The Spock character is by far the best developed, and when you see the movie you will understand why.<br /><br />Part of what I loved about this movie was the paradox.  For instance, Time Travel.  It was fun picking apart the logic afterwards.<br /><br />Romulan villain Nero travels back in time, to avenge the destruction of his planet Romulus, destroyed by a supernova (exploding star).<br /><br />The very fact that Nero can travel back in time, means that he can save his planet, which at the time of this Star Trek still exists, yet he does not.<br /><br />Nero waits 25 years for Spock to emerge from the time space continuum, which in Spock time is only 5 minutes. How long would you wait for someone to turn up?  If you're like me, not that long.<br /><br />Nero attacks Star fleet before Kirk is born.  If he can travel through time, then why does he wait until Kirk is all grown up before launching his next attack?<br /><br />I was surpised by the Romulan ship, all these walkways high in the air with no safety handrails. Someone could fall off. They have time travel, can destroy planets, have red matter, but no safety rails.<br /><br />Kobayashi Maru Simulation<br /><br />In order to pass this test and become a star fleet captain, you must fail the test. Nobody has ever passed the test. Yet there are star fleet captains. Kirk has failed the test twice, before becoming the first person to beat the test. How many times must one be allowed to take the test and fail, before one is deemed to pass the test?<br /><br />When he beats the test designed by Spock, he is put on trial for cheating. Spock designed the simulation to test the fear response, so how can someone who has no emotions be the arbiter of someone else's emotions.<br /><br />Using that standard Spock is unqualified to be a starship commander, yet Spock is a commander. Wouldn't Spock have to pass his own test, and therefore with his advance knowledge would he not achieve the same result as Kirk who he accuses of cheating by cheating? I enjoyed how screwed up this whole thing was.<br /><br />The movie felt a little off in two places, one was the Uhura storyline, who was so vaguely told as to be semi apologetic.  The other I felt was capturing Kirk, portrayed here as a hedonistic thrill seeker.  It's unlikely that anyone in a captain role would take the risks he takes.  That's what crew members are for.<br /><br />It has to be said that I have seen the movie more than once, as there was so much action, it was difficult to take it all in in one go.<br /><br />I wonder if you find this review helpful.test.

B0022MUEJ6|1.0|What you've heard is true... They've remastered this film one too many times.  The grain effect is most staggering in the black and white sequences, but the Technicolor clips are also streaked with grain.  Only the later clips, shot in Eastman Color (e.g., HIT THE DECK, HIGH SOCIETY) shine in high def.  Definitely avoid this release until WB comes out with a remastered remastering...
B0012GMZKE|4.0|As for as Leonard Cohen albums go, this one will most likely not disappoint. The songs seem a bit more put together and produced than his past efforts, but they are pretty creative and entertaining all the same. I'm not very in to Cohen, but I'm sure any Cohen fan that does not yet have this album will be very pleased with it.
B001TH16DS|5.0|I have always loved the original series and over the years have watched them over and over. When they put the first season out on Blu-ray I had to buy it. I never realized that they remastered the original and added new footage I was amazed! It is like watching it for the first time. The sound is ok and is low at times but the picture is amazing and when you switch from original to enhanced you really see the work put into these Blu-rays. I cannot wait to get the next two seasons.
B000002IHD|5.0|Otis Redding is purely good soul music. It's hard for me to write a review of this album, because Redding is just a good musician and singer. This album has been one of the favorites in my collection, and it's played frequently.     If you're a fan of soul, or rock n roll, or pretty much anything else. You'll like this album. Especially if you keep an open mind and an open heart ;) he has a lot to give.
0312944926|1.0|You can not compare to other Brown´s. In this case is a poor story with no rithmn and very predictable end.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|I first saw this movie when I was a child many, many moons ago and fell in love with it. A true classic that has held up over time. You and your kids will love it, too. If you are a Disney fan (or even if you're not) you HAVE to get this movie.
B00288KNJU|5.0|The old timely tales such as Little Red Riding Hood, Snow White and even Nancy Drew were enough to inspire, teach and terrify girls have been considered old school or even as much as dead for a long time now.   Their morals have been lost and their messages decayed overtime in the wake of inferior media directed as girls--such as the Twilight Series and Hanna Montana.  Let's face it. Today there is hardly a good franchise directed at preteen girls that strikes a positive message and doesn't encourage what's become a popular trend in today's consumer standards: the spending of mommy and daddy's hard-earned cash for either blind happiness or settling with a hot abusive boyfriend.  *eye-roll*    Coraline, projected from the creative efforts of Neil Gaiman and Henry Selick, may actually be the film that parents, mentors etc. have been waiting for after Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was brutally murdered and when Harry Potter came to a close.   While a twisted and almost a sickly creepy flick of dark proportions to some, behind its beautifully stop-motion-crafted walls, is story of maturity, responsibility and friendship.     The movie starts with Coraline (Dakota Fanning), an apathetic, whiny, complaining girl moving into her new home with her parents, hardly enthusiastic about her new living space.  The neighbors are either crazy or senile and the only person in the area within her age-range (Wybie--Robert Bailey Jr.) seems to have a miss-match when it comes to forming chemistry between the two of them.   Her parent's duty to their line-of-work doesn't help her adjustments, and the rain outside limits her activities.  That all changes with a mysterious doll given to her by Wybie that apparently leads her to unlocking a mysterious door in her new home.      In front of her parents, there's nothing but a brick-wall behind it, but at night it becomes a gateway to a parallel universe.  There, she meets her \\"other\\" mother (Terri Hatcher) and father (John Hodgman) who--unlike their originals--are outgoing, affectionate and seemingly determined to dote upon their little girl.  Everything about the world is brighter, better and more vibrant than the one Coraline presently inhabits--which leads her to coming back night after night, despite the countless warnings from her neighbors and even the efforts of her mother and father as they attempt to form connections with their estranged daughter.  With each visit, the world expands and something that was either banal or tedious before in the real world, appears lushly more beautiful and elaborate in the alternate one.  Everything about the world is superior--the food, the clothes, the toys, even her neighbors and Wybie are seemingly better and improved...    ...but Coraline soon learns that this imperfection is false, when the true nature of the world and her other mother's intentions are revealed.  Her real mother and father are captured and suddenly, the world turns from bright, happy and lenient to dark, cruel and unrelenting.   Aided by a cynical black cat, as well as receiving assistance from a few other \\"hopeless\\" allies (products of both the real and alternate worlds) she attempts to rescue her parents and put a stop to the other mother's plans.    The film itself is beautifully sculpted and animated, showing vast improvements in stop-motion animation quality since The Nightmare Before Christmas. But don't think that this movie is superior to Tim Burton's masterpiece (that movie was a classic, people... nothing will ever beat it) because if you think like that going into the film, when the credits roll you will most likely be disappointed.  My advice is try to see it as its own respected film and then you can't go wrong.       Bonus features on this product (compliments of Blu-RayDOTcom) are as follows:        * Feature commentary with director Henry Selick and composer Bruno Coulais (on 2-D and 3-D versions)      * U-Control (on 2-D version only):            - Picture-in-picture- Tours and voice sessions            - Animatic picture-in-picture      * Deleted scenes      * The Making of 'Coraline'      * Voicing the Characters      * Creepy Coraline      * D-Box      * BD Live:            - My Scenes Sharing            - The World According to Henry      * Digital copy of 2-D version (expires July 31, 2010)      In any case, this movie almost revives the dramatic yet engrossing effects that the Grimm fairy tales did two centuries ago--with a modern and more artistic glow to the common themes of growing up and facing one's fears.    With that it mind, it is highly recommended that your viewers are at least above the age of nine (as this may send anyone younger screaming and fleeing from your living room to the safety of the spot under their covers in their rooms) or are at least mature enough to handle a little bit of built-up tension--because there are times when this could send the socks flying off a college student. (I am totally not kidding)  Other than that, this movie is a must for your HD collection--as both a beautiful piece of \\"art\\" and an enchanting story that will charm the minds of girls (and boys) for at least another decade.
0440238609|4.0|I heard that this series was better than Harry Potter, so of course I had to read them.  For me, the first book, The Golden Compass, was quite ordinary.  I did not engage emotionally with Lyra - somehow, Pullman's writing did not connect.  It was an okay fantasy, and I almost didn't care about reading more.  Later, I picked up the second book, the Subtle Knife, and became a little more engaged, at least enough to decide to finish the series.  Wow, I am glad I did.  The third book, The Amber Spyglass, is full of intriguing ideas.  The characters go from static to dynamic, and you finally, finally, get emotionally involved with them.  The clear-cut good-and-evil that is so easy to follow in Harry Potter is absent from Pullman's stories, which might be why some people like them better.  Pullman has his characters say that people are not good or evil, only their actions are good (if they help someone) or evil (if they hurt someone).  So for older kids, this is an important idea to introduce.  I would not read this to young kids; it would be confusing and scary.

055358894X|2.0|Nothing I hate more when it comes to media than a story that really could of been good and ended up mediocre, Lies of Locke Lamora ended up being bad, hence the 2 stars. The book started out with an interesting secret that kept me turning pages but when it was reveled on page 23 or so I was bored. An interesting cast of characters were introduced and we never heard from them again. The character development is null, the main character, Locke, is a great thief and a good friend. That's all he's got, no soul, no thoughts, no feelings.    What really kills this book is the constant descriptions, at lavish parties ( theres maybe a dozen of them) you read about 2 paragraphs about the food, then the decorations. No one has any opinions of the food, wait I take that back, at one point a character says \\"It's all wonderful\\" or something close. There are also pages and pages about the architecture. On and on and on....No one in the book has any opinion on how the buildings look. That's what really got to me all this stuff about setting an environment and the characters have no opinions on it. No opinions about anything! It killed the author for me.     Check out the Night Angel Trilogy instead.
B000CE9R26|5.0|I would love yo order this;it was a great album.  BUT for $33!!!!? i don't think so. If anyone has the disc for sale in good condition -reasonable priced look me up!
B00005OM4K|5.0|Some of the greatest music/musicians of all time! Several songs I'd forgotten about. Sure brings back a lot of memories! Good price, fast shipping. A++
0307269752|1.0|I don't get the excitement generated by this book. After barely thirty pages the stiffness of the translation, (or is the stiffness of the writing?) was unable to make up for the dragging plot involving some sort of financial shenanigans and a wrongly accused journalist. I think. I just couldn't keep plowing through. Now the book sits forlornly waiting for me to give it away to the next unsuspecting reader.
B001AK3S4Y|5.0|i enjoyed this action filled farce mainly because i am a fan of william hoylands. it will sure keep you awake.
B001TODCII|5.0|Enjoyed it when I was watching it at the movies and still do even on DVD.  And I want the bloody, gory, violent R rated version.  Great Adrenaline rush.
B000P1QMZ6|5.0|what a great series of movies. Everything in these movies is well done even the more childish parts are watchable.
B000UR9T8C|5.0|How can you not complete your collection with this one? Only one little thing, they were a little heavy on the number of villians in this one. Still gave it 5 Stars though. Kirsten and Tobey together at last...all's well with the world. Even Stan Lee made a cameo appearance. Loved it and I do have 1&2 also.
B000CNE092|5.0|The movie arrived in great shape.  It is NEW, just as described and was a great price.  My Grand Daughter will love it....that's what counts!!  Thanks for a quick & smooth transaction.  I would recommend this seller!!
B00003CXFV|5.0|Everyone must see this movie! Julia Roberts does a fantastic job playin Erin and really makes the movie worth watching. One of my all time favorites.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this and received it on Thursday, tried level one and thought, okay, it's not too bad, I can, for the most part keep up with it.  Until day two--by then everything was sore and it was so hard to work out, but I kept on.   Day three, still sore, but I stayed with it, and after that day three work out (still at level one), I felt good about myself, all the soreness (lactic acid) went away!  It's only been a week, but oh my goodness have I seen results already!  I'm not the most fit person.  I've had three kids and there is a spare tire around my tummy, but slowly it is shrinking and clothes that were too tight before are not as much anymore.  I'm really surprised at the results for only the 20+ minutes that I workout with her/day.  Yes, I was a skeptic, but surely these 1000+ reviews were not wrong!  Level two was definitely harder to keep up with... but I'm faithfully doing them and I have yet to even look at level three!  Thank you Jillian Michaels!
1905654294|5.0|I absolutely love this book.  I've read each of the books at least twice...a little obsessed, I know. Although it wasn't my favorite of the series I still think that it was well written and tied up a lot of loose ends.  The only thing negative I can think of is that the confrontation with the Volturi is somewhat anticlimactic.  Other than that, I think it's a must read for Twilight fans.
B000V1Y43W|3.0|While I liked this movie, I can say that even it`s greate, the Blue Ray lacks a lot of options. For example, it has no spanish audio or subtitles. The menu doesen't help much if you want to find something fast and the options are not intuitive.    Me gusta mucho la película, y aunque es muy buena, para ser un blue ray es bastante pobre. Hay poco material adicional, no tiene audio en español o subtítulos. El menú es complicado y no te ayuda  a encontrar las cosas. Más que eso, no es intuitivo.
B001KVZ6FM|4.0|Disney/Pixar's latest journey does not take you through the depths of the ocean, or through the galaxies in outer space.  Instead it simply takes you \\"Up.\\"    Carl Fredrickson (voice of Ed Asner) is a senior citizen and grieving widower who is facing eviction.  With a real estate developer eyeing his property and nursing aides knocking at his door, he embarks on an adventure that he promised his beloved wife he'd take many years earlier.  Carl escapes by converting his home into a makeshift hot air balloon and it's up, up and away he goes.    Carl hopes his trip is a pleasure cruise at 30,000 feet.  Luckily for us, it's not.  Enter Russell (voice of Jordan Nagai) a young cub scout and unfortunately, a stowaway on Carl's balloon.  Add in a bunch of hilariously well trained dogs, a gigantic cuckoo bird, and an evil adventurer and it's so much for smooth sailing.    \\"Up\\" is a fun tale for the audience both young and old.  An elderly man gets to live out his life's dream and in the process gets reacquainted with the best times of his life.  \\"Up\\" is a truly heartwarming tale that taps into the relationship between young and old.  It's a story that inspires, and more importantly, one that tells us it's never too late to accomplish your dream.
B001KVZ6FM|4.0|Pixar has once again crafted a truly magical journey through a fantastical land full of brightly-colored creations and comical explorers. Playful humor and bouts of heartfelt poignancy combine with quite a bit of unexpected adventure to produce a film that will easily appeal to minds both young and old, and those that have never forgotten the allure of chasing dreams.<br /><br />Ever since he was a young boy, Carl Fredricksen (Ed Asner) has craved the excitement and adventure of exploration - a passion shared by his childhood friend and sweetheart, Ellie. After marrying, the couple always planned to travel to a remote paradise deep within South America, but continual setbacks forever delayed their journey. Now, at the age of 78, Carl is finally able to fulfill his lifelong dream, and in a daring flight he takes to the skies in his balloon-lifted house. But his adventure has only just begun...<br /><br />With Pixar's unbelievably successful track record, it's considerably more impressive seeing their films continue to be of such a high caliber, general appeal and repeat-viewing sensibility. Up is one of the most enjoyable and entertaining of Pixar's films, and one of the best the computer animated film genre has to offer. With an unlikely set of heroes, hopelessly romantic fantasy, suspenseful action, a beautiful score and a completely outlandish, unique plot, Up captures the spirit of adventure wholeheartedly.<br /><br />Perhaps the most rewarding aspect of Up, as with most of Pixar's films, is the blend of lighthearted comedy with insight and sentiment. There's plenty of comic relief, but the heavier \\"growing old\\" montage at the beginning and the later meaningful fulfillment of dreams and sacrifices for grander causes creates a deeper, satisfying resonance. The simple repetition of significant actions, such as tying a letter to a balloon, making promises by crossing the heart or toying with a grape soda pin (and even the idiosyncratic straightening of a bird figurine) suggests heartbreaking affectivity that further deepens the classical romance that fuels Carl's motives for adventure. Up is a film with something for everyone and definitely worthy of repeat viewings.<br /><br />- The Massie Twinsing affectivity that further deepens the classical romance that fuels Carl's motives for adventure. Up is a film with something for everyone and definitely worthy of repeat viewings.    - The Massie Twins

B0000AZJXQ|3.0|Besides a few compellingly put together segments and overall art-rock competence, the songwriting does not sound nearly as concise as their effective debut, nor does it deliver a unifying whole as presented.
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|Everyone in the family...and this covers many...have enjoyed the humor and hide-and-scurry frenzy...as well as the musical aspect of this show.  Fast-paced and enjoyable.  Enough surprises, even after hearing everyone's funny comments that I want to see it again and again - just like the rest of my crew who recommended it after they saw it.   I really enjoyed it.

B000B8QG4A|5.0|Lady and the Tramp    Thank You so much, my Granddaughter loves the DVD.
B001KVZ6FM|5.0|My mom and I went to see this movie.  We both loved it.  I'm 24 and her 43.  I don't think I've ever seen a Pixar movie in theaters.  After this though, I will see them all.  There should not be any spoilers here.  I will try to tell you about the movie without ruining it for anyone.<br /><br />Firstly, the 3D glasses are great.  I was worried they would be red and blue and ruin the look of the movie.  Well they look like regular sun glasses, and while they are grey you still see the color of the movie.  The 3D was not what I expected.  I thought it would be thing flying out at me and looking like they were coming right at me.  No no, this my friends in a 3D that I have never seen.  The pictures just looks more amazing than any movie I have ever seen.  Imagine if there was something 1000 times better looking than blu ray.  That's is what I got when watching the film.  It only added to the greatness that I felt.<br />Now, for the movie.  One part of the movie is about a boy.  The boy turns into a man, and then a senior.  It shows you some important things that happen in the mans life.  Things that happen when he's  very young.  Then when he's older.  I will not say what happens, but this movie did make me get teary.  My mom said you forget that it's a cartoon.  Anyway, I think one part of the movie is about the man learning that there are always new things to do in life, and you can't have one thing happen and decide to give up and stop trying these things.<br /><br />The other part of the movie in my opinion is about a young boy.  Not the boy who is the man.  But, another boy who's a scout of some sort.  He always wants to go on adventures.  He learns a lot about what a true adventure is.  While at the same time learning how to stay safe, help others and believe in himself.<br /><br />The Older man has to leave his house one day.  Something he does makes this happen.  But, he does not want to leave.  For the reason that he has many memories in his house.  He decides to go to a place that he once told someone close to him he would go.  So he gets a bunch of balloons and goes!  Little does he know that the boy who is a scout is at his door!  The boy knocks and the man lets him in.  Though not a first.  The two travel to this place the man once said he would go and have a lot of adventure on the way.  Some of the things the boy does, reminds the man of the person he once knew.  In fact the person who he had promised the trip.  Maybe the boy will learn to believe in himself and the man will learn to live and to be friendly as he once was.  The two learn the things that are important from each other.  Though, they may not realize it at the time.<br /><br />Oh and there is also a dog who learns to have friends.  I can't forget that!<br /><br />What is comes down to is this.  This is one of the best films I have ever seen.  The 3D work is that which I have never seen.  It is absolutely amazing.  It will make you laugh at times.  While at the same time either making you think about something in your life or in someone you know.  I can't see anyone not enjoying this movie.  So go see it.  Tell your friends and go see it again.  Then, when your friends go see it, go again with them.once told someone close to him he would go.  So he gets a bunch of balloons and goes!

B00015YVDG|5.0|From director Ron Howard (\\"Apollo 13\\") comes a gripping tale of ransom and a race against time. Academy Award winner Mel Gibson stars, with Rene Russo (\\"Lethal Weapon 3\\"), Delroy Lindo and Gary Sinise (\\"Apollo 13,\\"<br />\\"Snake Eyes\\"). The film is well-written and ably directed. Very suspenseful to the final minutes. SPOILER!!!  I just HATED the scenes where a male kidnapper was sympathetic to the kid. In my opinion, that was disgusting. The female should have been more sympathetic and loving to the kid, though she was a little kind to him towards the end. Rated R for language and some violence, but it should've been PG-13.

0393324818|5.0|This is a fantastic look of baseball that takes the reader beyond the inside of the managers office, but inside the managers head. It won't give you any secret tips that will put you over the edge, but it'll teach you how to think about the game in a smarter, more concrete way.    Lewis doesn't forget that he's writing a book meant to be enjoyed - either. It is fun to read, giving real stories to players and letting them grow into characters. The individual stories in it are told in their voice, with the author simply pulling the tale along rather than jamming his thoughts into a book.
0385340567|1.0|Main battle tanks destroyed by the trailer-load! Please! Another kooky right-wing Christian (one of literature's most abiding and ridiculous stereotypes)at the heart of an insidious plot! Please! Yes, the US Army has lost three to four tanks to IEDs, and, tragically, one life in the process. However,this book claims the Iraqi insurgents/terrorists have destroyed so many that the evil preacher is able to harvest the uranium from them in a dangerous quantity. I'm a great fan of the Reacher novels, but not of this one. Instead of depicting those villains who really want to strike at the heart of our country--Islamic militants (such as the one recently captured who were planning to use Stingers to attack planes)-- Mr. Child goes after that old, tiresome target-- the mythical right-wing preacher. It's ludicrous. I've known a lot of Christians and a lot of folks in the military (I have a close relative in the military right now), and none of them acts like the characters in this weak story.

Ms. Child's descriptions are straight forward and quite simple to follow.  French cooking is not difficult to work with and that is Ms. Child's approach.  They take a basic approach and do not go off on fanciful tangents.  You will love it!
0758232225|4.0|Vanessa Davis Griggs has a blend of characters with social issues, baby mama drama, and unveiling faith. Characters are well-written that interweaves some generational curses that need to be broken, religiosity, judgmental believers, and genuine angels that step out of the norm. There are some characters you cannot help but love, and others question their motives when they realize they lost something good! Do not jump to other people opinions of you, do not be quick to anger, and loose what God brought in your life (divine connections, job, people, divine relationships and marriages, etc.).<br /><br />Do not loose on the blessings God has for you! Break those generational curses, strongholds, and negativity in your life. This book lays it all out. It is a must-read.

0307455378|4.0|Zafon mantiene el suspenso en este tomo, en su forma clasica de tejer un cuento.  Lo unico que encontre un poco desconcertante es la tendencia de Zafon, en este libro, a comenzar los capitulos con descripciones del ambiente que, en ciertos momentos, resultan repetitivas.  \\"El Juego del Angel\\" captura al lector, aunque no con la misma intensidad de \\"La Sombra del Viento\\". Sin embargo, lo recomiendo a los lectores que disfrutan de la forma lirica en que Zafon usa el lenguage.

This book projects the greatest quality in any human being--citizen or leader--that of being authentic.

I am happy--at 83--to have this human being as president. With all this, he is an avid reader and historian which gives him the informed backdrop for making wise decisions. I do sleep better with him at the helm.
B001AVEJ1Y|3.0|\\"...To BOLDLY go where No Man had Gone Before.\\"..<br /><br />...or something like that. The immortal tagline of the operatic TV franchise that had gone on for many generations. First off, let me tell you that I am a casual fan and more of a \\"Next Generation\\" kind'a guy, although my favorite Star Trek movie is still \\"The Wrath of Khan\\". After the failed box-office outings of recent `Star Trek\\" films (\\"Nemesis\\" for one) and the less than dominating presence in television by \\"Enterprise\\", one wouldn't be hard-pressed to think that the franchise needed a reboot to attract a new generation of fans. What made the series successful that also spawned numerous spin-offs (such as \\"Deep Space Nine\\") was the manner of which it creates mythic characters, with storylines that are pretty much driven by its characters and situations. Well, \\"popcorn\\" director J.J. Abrams is the one to undertake this very dangerous assignment of rebooting a well-loved franchise that had earned its place in pop culture. What should be the focus of this reboot? Remembering what had gone before while injecting a certain needed dose of energy.<br /><br />Some years ago, and the U.S.S. Kelvin is under attack by a huge Romulan ship that dwarfs the Kelvin in size and power. Aboard the federation starship is George Kirk, who would then be revealed as the sire of one Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine). Sacrificing himself to save the lives of the crew, Kirk proves his mettle as a man who saved 800 people in under 8 minutes.<br />Now 20 years from that time, a cocky James Kirk is dubbed by Captain Pike as \\"only the genius level intellect repeat offender in the Midwest\\", and reveals the sacrifice made by his father. Inspired, Jim decides to enlist in the federation, finally beating a simulation program designed by Spock (Zachary Quinto) and attracts attention from the academy. Unfortunately, the planet Vulcan becomes under siege by the very same ship that killed Kirk's father; a rogue Romulan hero named Nero (Eric Bana) wants revenge on the planet. It is up to new federation cadets to try to intercept Nero, but will they be in time?<br /><br />J.J. Abrams is one very mainstream director, he knows how to give his audience what they want or to believe that he knows what they want. The direction is indeed very energetic and fast-paced, the film keeps on moving, as Abrams bombards the audience with nostalgic scenes as we become privy to \\"Star Trek the Early Years\\". It is quite great to see the younger Kirk munching on an apple, the Vulcan mind-meld and nerve pinches, and accompanied by classic supporting characters such as Spock, Uhura (Zoe Saldana), McCoy (Karl Urban), Scotty (Simon Pegg), Chekov (Anton Yelchin), Sulu (John Cho) and even Leonard Nimoy makes an appearance as \\"Spock # 1\\". There is also a sexy green alien who is reminiscent of the green ladies from the original series and \\"Enterprise\\". The dialogue is full of humorous quips that give our characters some weight and lets them grow on us, in place of characterization. Sure, we are all familiar with these characters so development doesn't really matter right? Wrong. The characters this time around feels very one-dimensional, even Kirk's clich&eacute;d \\"bad boy\\" image persona is rather overused; he crashes a classic vintage sports car, and involves himself in barroom brawls, which make for fun development but a little too clich&eacute;d.. The characters while having an entertaining feel are very `cartoonish' and made very transparent to make for easy connection to its audience.<br /><br />The screenplay by Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman is full of action and set ups for the usual Hollywood injections of elaborate stunts, special effects, and heavy doses of explosions. While this is not exactly a bad thing, it does manage to keep the proceedings in a hyper-kinetic fun pace, if you are looking for action thrills then this movie will not disappoint. I rather enjoyed the scene when Kirk and Sulu engaged a vertical dropfrom space, I like the `ice planet' where Kirk meets the \\"prime\\" Spock, there are many scenes that can easily be seen as `popcorn' entertainment. The new U.S.S. Enterprise had some minor re-designs but none that looked too extravagant. Nero's ship does have a HUGE intimidating quality but it looks a little insect-like or a \\"flytrap\\". However, it doesn't have the feel of `classic' Star Trek movies, that may be seen as a misstep to purists, as the overly kinetic action tends to distract the audience from its plot.<br /><br />The plot in 2009's Star Trek is very simple, and has the usual \\"trappings\\" of Hollywood formulas, such as time travel, an alternate reality, a black hole and a quest for revenge. The plot offers nothing new, and Abrams wisely avoids the inside details of the plot. (don't even try to dissect the logic and science of its plot since it is so unimaginative) Yes, to hide every plot misstep and hole, he distracts his audience with its pace, humor, a lot of huge explosions and action. What happened to Kirk's mother? She disappears after we see James taking a joyride in a sports car. The villain, Nero feels rather underwhelming, and all the emotions that he can display is anger, the explanation behind his goals for vengeance is also too short and rather feels like a throw-away detail. Much of the film's central focus is on the developing friendship between James and Spock, with Spock's budding romance with Uhura as a subplot. I have to say Zachary Quinto gives a very good performance, and almost steals the show from Chris Pine if it wasn't for his character's outward `cockiness'. the rest of the crew seems decent, although the cast definitely spends too much effort in acting like the `classic' cast so I cannot really comment on their acting talents.<br /><br />Everyone seems to be so happy to see the franchise re-energized, and I can appreciate fans` reasons to rejoice, but purist of the beloved series may find the film a little wanting. If you dissect the limitations and weaknesses of the plot, one can see that this film is JUST your usual popcorn affair, that comes straight from the Hollywood oven. It is a good film but the film spends too much time being fascinated with itself--\\"Hey look at us, we are making a new Star Trek movie\\", and fans of the almost `asleep' franchise are just happy to see the U.S.S. Enterprise Starship once again. The fact that Abrams knows \\"playful entertainment\\" is what gave the film its extremely high entertainment value, along with his innate skill in casting Winona Ryder in a surprise appearance and finds room for the Vulcan salute, and the little alien with Scotty, not to mention that green alien slut, Abrams knows energetic momentum and redeems the film. The film is fun, thrilling and enjoyable, but it is HARDLY Epic or groundbreaking. Would Gene Roddenberry give this film his approval? Probably not, but then all that should matter is how well `fans' take to it. When in doubt, clich&eacute;d popcorn movies are the safest bet. This movie will not make a dent or add on to Star Trek's legacy, but it sure is fun and as a lady friend of mine said; \\"CUTE\\".<br /><br />Recommended!

B000IOM1Z0|5.0|I personally think this is the best of any of Alan Parsons Works. I have the album and the CD and I wouldn't part with neither for any amount of money.
B001R4MEYS|5.0|I mean that title in the best way possible.  Until this year, I never heard Mastodon's music at all.  I've always been aware of these guys but never owned a Mastodon record or anything.  Plus, with metal, I have a love/hate relationship with the genre, and lately, I've been into a lot of prog.  My taste is usually aligned with powerpop/new wave kind of bands, who specialize in tighter, shorter, brighter, catchier songwriting and hooks and harmonies...Beatles, Who, Byrds, Beach Boys, Bee Gees, Badfinger, Raspberries, Cheap Trick, Sweet, Def Leppard, that type of stuff.<br /><br />Now, I also love certain proggish, artrock bands like Genesis, who are very melodic and catchy but interweave these elements into longer, suite-like structures...it's more adventurous and doesn't sway too far from my poppish taste and mindset.  The thing about metal, is that the only kind I like is the brighter, poppier kind, but for the riffs and melodies and the way those heavier elements are woven around the songwriting.  Most metal, to me though, makes me feel like my intelligence is being dumbed down, and most metal fans are extremely conservative and against musical evolution...look at Metallica fans for instance...they love \\"Kill Em All\\" and \\"Master Of Puppets\\", but when \\"The Black Album\\" came out with their hair cut short and shorter songs and radio play, people turned on the band...another fave, Finnish band Nightwish!!!  Original singer Tarja got fired and the fans gave new singer Annette a hard time, the finger even, so much so that she ran offstage crying many times!!!  So, I don't generally like to be associated with the metal scene, and I only like certain elements of metallic bands...and I don't like classifying certain hard rock bands as metal (like AC/DC is NOT a metal band), or even H.I.M. (who call themselves \\"love metal\\", but I wouldn't call them metal at all)unless absolutely necessary...like Black Sabbath.<br /><br />Cue Mastodon...a metal band for people like me, who don't like to be associated with the genre.  I bought this record, \\"Crack The Skye\\", with the DVD, based on the 4 star review in Rolling Stone, having heard the name, hearing the title song in that movie \\"Aqua Team Hunger Force\\"...pretty frikking cool, and then the song they cover on that Warner Bros CD \\"Covered\\", in association with the Warner Box set \\"Revolutions In Sound\\"...they do ZZ Top's \\"Just Got Paid\\" with guest guitar from ZZ Top's Billy Gibbons himself...again, pretty frikkin' cool...so I'm like, what the frick, I'm dead curious, and I buy the deluxe \\"Crack The Skye\\"...plus it's on Sire, and I trust all Sire releases, one of my fave labels...H.I.M.'s on Sire too...I pop the DVD on first and I was like \\"this is pretty cool\\" and the concert footage was totally rad.  Then I pop in the CD...had to get my feet wet and used to the sound...I dig I dig...it's like grungy Melvins-influenced, college-smart and friendly, but trippy, prog metal, like classic Genesis or Rush gone heavy...maybe like a better, cooler Dream Theater, or a more metal Alice In Chains???<br /><br />I don't feel stupid listening to this and Rolling Stone was right on...I'll be listening to this for a while...many layers, so this is necessary, and I'll get their catalogue (I'm dead curious about the rest)...maybe see em live and get some cool T-shirts while I'm at it.<br /><br />Call me converted, what can I say???associated with the genre.

B000TUXL0W|5.0|I thought this CD was just as good as his CD back to Bedlam. I don't know if all of the copies had this but, I liked the fact that the copy I purchased had a bonus video CD so that you could see how the video for 1973 was created. I really liked this CD. There is only one thing I don't quite understand with James Blunt though. What is his fascination with pills? His first CD a picture of a Prozac capsule on the CD and this one is related to pills also.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|[[ASIN:B001QOOCTE Songs Around The World (CD + DVD)]] This is a really fine product: CD & DVD of music for Peace: Playing For Change. It is a collection of songs recorded from musicians around the world, each added track by track together of people who, perhaps, have never met face to face. These musicians often play for spare change but also to help change the world. The recordings are excellent and the DVD is informative and well done. Plus for what you get, the price can't be beat!

B001SN78JO|5.0|this movie was great,i thought it would be another movie starring jim carrey with 'over the top ' laughs and dry humour,but it was the best he has made yet. really good acting and a great story line...( boy gets girl,boy loses girl,boy gets girl back )i loved it.
B00005RDRO|4.0|This is a movie a little ahead of it's time. It is sort of the same genre as the Scary Movie series, or Dance Movie...The jokes come fast and it is a funny spoof of mysteries and the bigger than life characters. It is plain silly and there are a lot of actors with big names who are very good sports.   Very quotable too!
B001U7FWM8|4.0|Let me state upfront that I initially became a huge fan of Grizzly Bear not because of their \\"Yellow House\\" album but instead because of their \\"Friends EP\\" (which at 41 min. really is much more than an EP). Since then, I've been waiting impatiently for the new release, which by all accounts is one of the most anticipated indie-music releases of 2009.<br /><br />\\"Veckatimest\\" (12 tracks; 52 min.) is not a radical departure from the band's earlier work, but an expansion of it. The album starts off with a moody \\"Southern Point\\" only to kick in hard next with \\"Two Weeks\\", but the overall sense of the first of the album is sensual and atmospheric. There is a lot of vocals harmonizing (reminiscent of the Beach Boys and, more recently, Fleet Foxes), check out \\"Dory\\". The second half of the album starts of with \\"Ready, Able\\", one of the best tracks of the album for me, just mesmerizing. Great songs follow one after another. Mu personal favorites include \\"While You Wait For Others\\" and the closer \\"Foreground\\".<br /><br />In all, this is a very ambitious but beautiful, even majestic album. At 52 min. it is a lot to digest, reason why I didn't post my review when I bought this album on the day of its release at my indie-music record store. I've listened to this quite a few times since I bought this, and I find new treasures each time I listen to it. I saw Grizzly Bear live a couple of times last year, including one where they opened up for Radiohead, and each time it amazed me how much harder they rock live than on their studio output. I will be seeing them again in a few weeks at Bonnaroo and I can't wait to see how the songs from \\"Veckatimest\\" will resonate live. If you wonder where you can here these guys, they are played frequently at WOXY (Bam! the Future of Rock and Roll) , the internet-only station that plays the best indie-music in the country, bar none. Meanwhile, if you love indie-music, buy this album, you will not be disappointed.

At the time there was no such thing as The Bad Seeds per se, just a talented group of enablers willing to see where chance & whim might take them.<br /><br />What resulted is something that just can't be repeated. From Her To Eternity was just as difficult to classify back in 1984 as it is today.<br /><br />At the time, kicking off an album with a Leonard Cohen song was hardly the height of fashion. Only a cover of a minor Elvis Presley hit like \\"In the Ghetto\\" could be more ludicrous.<br /><br />On both fronts, Cave does not disappoint. But don't go thinking this is a covers album. Not by a long shot (see Kicking Against the Pricks for that).<br /><br />While far from Cave's most accessible, Eternity is certainly one of a kind, an underground classic, up there with the likes of VU's Banana album or Captain Beefheart's Trout Mask Replica. The kind of thing on which his formidable reputation was built.<br /><br />Without a doubt, \\"Avalanche\\" is one of Leonard Cohen's darkest songs. If you can believe it, Cave paints it even blacker, coming off like some subterranean gargoyle, whose slumbers have been disturbed.  A cranky delivery that snarls all red eyed, fangs barred. Not the warmest of welcomes, but a memorable start to one hell of journey into Night.<br /><br />The demented sea chantey, \\"Cabin Fever\\" follows, Cave kicking off with a grunt like a dying mule.  If ever there was a sound of someone gone stark raving mad, this is it. Along with the admirable but slightly redundant \\"Wings Off Flies\\" this is the closest things get to the Birthday Party.<br /><br />Then we're dropped down the \\"Well Of Misery\\". An empty bucket clangs on lonesome walls of stone, it's only company an echoing chain gang refrain. In between lies a poetic tale chock full of mordant humor.<br /><br />Without a doubt, the \\"classic\\" here is the title track, which grabs you by the throat & won't let go. Precariously balanced on a propulsive rhythm section & Blixa Bargeld's sinister buzz saw guitar, Cave launches into a manic tale of lust & obsession few can rival.<br /><br />None of which prepares you for the epic swagger of \\"Saint Huck\\" or the funereal  \\"Box For Black Paul\\".  While the iconoclastic twist on the Mark Twain classic is one of the album's highlights, I suppose a case could be made for \\"Paul\\" being a touch self-indulgent. But that would simply be missing the point. For me, this is biting satire, parodying a rubbernecking, parasitic press corp bent on getting the scoop on some dead long forgotten hack.<br /><br />Fans certainly won't be disappointed in this reissue. The sound is light years above the previous CD pressing. Also included is the aforementioned, \\"In The Ghetto\\" where Cave's delivery snatches sincerity from the jaws of mawkishness.  In addition, there's a gem of a ballad in \\"The Moon Is In The Gutter\\".<br /><br />As for the interview disc, there is indeed a tale to be told from those who took part in the sessions. But you'll also have to sit through the banality of a few celebrity fans inanely flapping their gums as well.<br /><br />As dark, histrionic & over the top as this record is, there's one thing the listener has to keep in mind: there is a wicked sense of humor at play here.<br /><br />Obviously, Cave was not taking himself nearly as seriously as his fans would like him to. If you're looking for a playful, edgy dose of on-the-brink mayhem, this is the album for you.ion & Blixa Bargeld's sinister buzz saw guitar, Cave launches into a manic tale of lust & obsession few can rival.

B000002UB3|4.0|While it's definitely an album worth having, The Beatles White album is my favorite.  Abbey Road requires a bit more depth on the part of the listener to fully appreciate the sound and meaning.

1416955070|5.0|I was moving along smoothly and enjoying the book quite thoroughly until I came upon that infamous plot twist (which, for the sake of those who don't yet know about it, I will not mention). The rest of the book was quite honestly torture for me. My final assessment of the series will depend on how that issue is resolved, but I admire Cassandra's creativity in blending so many types of mythical creatures together in a story while adding a new one of her own. The writing flows smoothly and once or twice put off a tiny twinge of \\"Harry Potterness\\". Definitely read this book, but be prepared to be frustrated at the ending and run out to buy and immediately begin reading the next in the series, as I am now.

B00009ATIX|4.0|The first time I saw the Soderbergh remake of Solaris, I was disappointed, because I had seen the original in a theatre in the 70s, and again in a VCR format.  The old SOLARIS was drenched in grief.  The second time I saw the Soderbergh version, I came to the point where wife says: \\"hush! we are not to think like that any more\\".  This was the most profound, philosophical advice I have ever heard in my life.  This single line takes the movie to one of the greatest ever made.
0385341008|1.0|The book is almost sickeningly sweet -- with unbelievably cute characters that I could not make myself care about. But most distressing of all, it borrows heavily from the truly original style and humor of [[ASIN:1559211407 84, Charing Cross Road]] by Helene Hanff.

0671449028|4.0|There are about a thousand going-to-bed books for toddlers, most of them soothing, almost none of them funny.  This one manages to be both.  In simple, rhythmically rhyming verse, a group of animals on a cruise ship go through their bedtime rituals: bathing, tidying, dressing, brushing teeth, and then (here's a surprise) exercise - then finally to bed, and with the ship \\"they rock/ and rock/ and rock to sleep.\\"<br /><br />It takes an ingenious writer to make such a punchy, silly, and somehow comforting story look so easy.  Like most of Boynton's books, this is sure to be a hit with toddlers everywhere.

The lyrics in some cases are strange but Gaga's well chosen beats and instruments make this disco trip well worth your while.<br /><br />Gaga manages her \\"electro pop\\" professionally and well deserves the attention she has recieved. I haven't enjoyed pop music this much since the fantastic band \\"Savage Garden\\" which I still listen heavily to and that to me really is saying something.
067144901X|3.0|Another funny Boynton book, this one is about the noises different animals make.  Introducing humor for very young children, she surprises the reader by having singing pigs say \\"La la la\\" instead of \\"oink.\\"  On the following page she suggests that the reader correct those pigs.  This is a nice book for young toddlers, but the joke is simple enough that it won't last long into toddlerhood, and won't interest older siblings.  Better to enjoy it once, then return it to the library.
B001EO748M|4.0|Even though you may choose \\"play all\\" , 2 of the 4 DVDs will only play the first of the 3 segments it contains - then it just stops as though it were finished.

0553381687|5.0|I'm currently on the third book in Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series, Storm of Swords, and wanted to share 3 of my favorite elements from the first book, A Game of Thrones.<br /><br />RESTRAINT IN FANTASY ELEMENTS - Throughout A Game of Thrones you'll learn about the magic, dragons and mystical creatures that existed in the past but no longer seem to be around.  These elements exist on the fringe of the story, as rare undercurrents of mystery, and remain mostly rarely seen, if ever.  We are told that the dragons, for example, all died hundreds of years ago.  And all we see are their giant bones, and hear stories of the battles they fought in, such as The Field of Fire. This literally made my mouth water and sparked my imagination, wishing for their return! I'd ask all my friends who read it, \\"Will there be dragons? There's got to be dragons at some point?\\" They never told me, and I won't say either.  All I'll say is Martin makes you want it.  And earns the right to include what fantastical elements he does.  This restraint lends a great maturity to the story, and reality to those elements, that further establishes their danger, horror and wonder.<br /><br />SYMPATHETIC CHARACTERS - But the main focus of the story is, of course, on the characters.  Each chapter is told from a different character's perspective, and they are all so rich and dynamic that I found no matter what choice or consequence they faced, I was sympathetic to it.  You live with the characters.  You see conflicting perspectives.  And there were times where I had to put the book down mid chapter because I was blown away with excited amazement by what they decided to do, or absolutely shocked, stunned, frozen in place that something so terrible could happen to them.  And book to book you see them grow, mature, and even change...<br /><br />ONE HECK OF A RIDE - Game of Thrones kicks the whole series off to a brutal and climactic start!  After finishing it, I had no choice but to keep on going, and I plan on continuing through Feast for Crows next, then biting my nails impatiently for Dance with Dragons.  They're good books, and its a thrilling mythology to dive into.  Book by book it gets better and better - the pacing, the stakes, the characters, the magic and dragons, the violence, the sex, the joy and the sadness - adult themes in a mature tale that's truly astonishing.<br /><br />I highly recommend Game of Thrones to the hardcore fantasy reader, and especially to anyone looking to get into the genre.  It was my first fantasy novel and I'm hooked.rough Feast for Crows next, then biting my nails impatiently for Dance with Dragons.  They're good books, and its a thrilling mythology to dive into.

B000002BYD|2.0|I never quite understood the appeal of this album, or the appeal of most of the popular Pearl Jam albums for that matter.  It seems the more popular a Pearl Jam album is, the more likely I am to think the album isn't quite as good as one of the bands less popular efforts.  Yield is a fine example of that.    Something about the vocal melodies on this particular effort strike me as unsatisfying for the most part.  Pearl Jam is (or was) certainly capable of creating a mighty fine album when they wanted to.  Problem is, Yield doesn't show me any of the bands finer qualities.      Yield doesn't strike me as an album you should own, and just like Ten, it's my belief the two albums both have something in common- they are both overrated because the vocal melodies are weak, and the songwriting isn't up to the bands usual high standards.
B000LAZDQA|4.0|I didn't think I was going to enjoy this movie as much as I did. There was always this buzz around how pornographic the film was and how much sex was involved. Yes, it is graphic movie...but I found it to be intriguing, moving and, at times, quite funny.    The concepts in the movie are not for your children or grandmother(unless she's super liberal and comfortable with sex in movies).
B001QOOCTE|5.0|The CD, which coordinates different people from throughout the world singing the same songs, as if they were there together on one stage, was not just a brilliant idea, it has been produced brilliantly. I think the producer, Mark Johnson is a genius to have thought of this and then pull it all together so well. The album, particularly the song Stand by Me, is beautiful to listen to and moving spiritually. Seeing all the different parts and people on the DVD, all in different costumes, using different instruments, singing in different styles, all coming together, shows that the world's a stage and Johnson has managed to prove it in a unique and inspiring way. BRAVO!
0792165020|4.0|Overall, this is intriguing drama-crime story with a lot of suspense and done so without a lot of violence. All the characters in this movie grab your attention. Combine that with good European scenery and involving storyline and you have a movie worth investigating.<br /><br />I read somewhere that  this film also goes under the title, \\"The Strange Mr. Ripley.\\"  How true.<br /><br />****Spoilers****  The first hour sets up Matt Damon's character, \\"Tom Ripley,\\" to do what he eventually does:  kill someone and then imitate the rich kid off in Europe.<br /><br />However, to be fair, his murder of friend \\"Dickie Greenleaf\\" (Jude Law) is almost made to look like self-defense. It's an odd scene in this odd movie. As the story unfolds, however, \\"Ripley\\" is shown to be a sick killer, hardly some innocent man caught in some self-defense predicament.<br /><br />The second half of the film deals with Damon's character trying to get away with his scheme while other people slowly start to question who he is and what he's doing. Some people trust him; some don't. A few twists make the story even more interesting.<br /><br />Gwyneth Paltrow is good in here as \\"Marge Sherwood,\\" someone who is ahead of the pack when it comes to uncovering the truth. Cate Blanchett is good, too, as usual, but her role was much smaller and one I'm not sure was all about.
B0009MAO46|5.0|My granddaughter who I refuse nothing, loved the old vhs tape I had of this movie, and wanted a \\"new one\\", meaning DVD to a 3 year old,  for her birthday. It had been removed from stores and I was begining to panic when I found it on Amazon! Amazon saved the day, it was delivered well in time for her birthday, and she and I were very happy.
B000OPOAM0|4.0|Here's another film from the 1980s that has reached \\"classic\\" status. Unlike some of the other popular movies of its day, this one had two sequels that both were successful, particularly the second. As I write this, there's a fourth Terminator just out on the silver screen.    In retrospect, what makes this \\"Terminator\\" different is that Arnold Schwarzenegger was the villain, not the hero, as he was in the next two Terminator movies.    Here, Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton are the \\"good guys.\\" The now famous phrase by Arnold, \\"I'll be back.\\" comes from this film. Hamilton, meanwhile, also was different, with a shapely figure and a fairly nice person, unlike the ultra-thin and coarse woman she was in the first sequel.    Played mostly for violence and special effects, the film is a bit rough and sleazy in parts but certainly was popular because, like most of Arnold's film, it flat-out entertains.     I've been debating about buying the Blu-Ray but have held off because of conflicting reviews on it, most of them being negative about the transfer.

The Day After should be shown in schools and used for teaching about humanity.

B000CCD0FS|4.0|Since the beginning of the 80's Talking Head's had been on one long,polyrhythmic musical adventure-starting with Brian Eno and moving on with people like Bernoe Worrell and such on their full throttle funk album [[ASIN:B000CCD0FI Speaking in Tongues]]. When this album emmerged a couple years later,it was beginning to look like things had really changed.For one the back and front cover art is my and many other's favorite of all the Talking Heads' albums-the busy cartoon drawing on the front,cluttered with secret messages ranging from \\"Planet Of The Midgets And The Giants\\" to the less the subtle \\"Talking Heads Greatest Folk Art On Earth\\".The back cover,featuring the band decked out in sunny,bohemian/gypsy type causual where is worthy itself of a full wall poster.And in a word sunny is a good way to describe the overall feeling of this album.It's chocked full of songs that leave the funky polyrhythms aside and focus on...well musically simplistic beats,chimming Byrds-like guitars and more of a focus on the basic band.The best places here to find great example of this are the big hits in the opener \\"And She Was\\" and closer \\"Road To Nowhere\\";no matter how you cut it,a lot of the best pop is radio friendly (even if that may be an oxymoron to some) and these two certainly are,the latter being an oddly aimless sounding march.Well,it works with the lyric.A good handful of these tunes such as \\"Creatures Of Love\\",\\"Perfect World\\" and \\"Stay Up Late\\" are all bright tunes,somewhat out of character with lyrics about babies and the beauty of the planet Earth itself.\\"Give Me Back My Name\\",with it's warped pop/reggae approch is the only \\"old style\\" Heads tune here.The only songs that even remotely touch on anything close to funk are the slightly more rhythmic new-wavey sounds of \\"Walk It Down\\" and \\"Television Man\\";neither are in any serious polymeter and are fairly ordinarly 80's pop underneath.The bonus tracks feature embryonic sketches of \\"Road To Nowhere\\" and \\"And She Was\\" along with an extended and somewhat funkier version of \\"Television Man\\". This is probably the only Talking Heads album that,from beginning to end concentrates soley on lightweight modern pop.Unlike much of the bands catalog there are some songs that don't stand out as much as the others,mostly because of the forced simplicity of some of the musical ideas. But this is definately a great album in a long series of excellent Talking Heads' releases and showcases how daring this band could still be,even in the most unexpected of ways.She Was\\" along with an extended and somewhat funkier version of \\"Television Man\\".

B0007ZEO4G|5.0|I saw in a review someone had written that they didnt like this album cause of glenn hughes's girl vocals are you kidding are we talking about the same guy. He is known as the voice of rock for a reason he has the best vocal range of any singer but anyway on with the album. Gillian and glover leave and what happens you add coverdale and hughes on vocals and you get one of deep purple's best albums the two vocalists trading off they way they do is great. Deep purple has 3 great albums most people will agree 1. in rock 2. machine head 3. burn. Burn is just as good as anything with ian gillian i love 6 of the 8 songs here you fool no one and the last instrumental i can do without but the other 6 smoke the title cut could be the best song on the album along with mistreated and sail away deadly album no need to be unsure go buy it. stormbringer and come taste the band are not as strong but they do have good tunes on each album. to hear more glenn hughes he was in a band prior to joining deep purple called  Trapeze.  enjoy
B000YRY8BG|1.0|This movie needs be rated R! The language was unbelievably bad and there were lots of passionate bedrooms scenes. Sex was brought up too many times to count. When one of the male characters makes reference to one of his body parts, we turned it off. There is also a gay character. Not sure what other characters say about him because we muted the conversation. My family and I were so disgusted. The story-line was good and interesting. Could have been such a good movie, but with all the other junk, we just couldn't get past it. VERY dissapointed!!!
B0013D8F14|5.0|May be the greatest album ever recorded. Witness the myriad of releases over the years. It is a treasure for the ages. Each remastering brings us closer to the soul of the great Billie Holiday. Even Ray Ellis took a while to warm up to it. But like Shakespeare and fine scotch, give it time and you will be rewarded with greatness.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|Excellent movie, but there are couple of negative elements. One of the villans gets very fresh with a waitress and a very short bedroom scene follows. Nothing is shown except lustfull kissing which is also short. Camera changes and you can \\"hear\\" them. Why writers/directors found it necessary to include the scene, I don't know. The villan doesn't even do that in the book. I do hate that there is a scene however short because now, when I recommend this movie, I have to warn my friends. There are few bad words. Other than that, it was an excellent movie!

B001EAWMGA|5.0|This movie was a lot of fun, and I thoroughly enjoyed it!  Others around here mention B-Movie status. Well, I would suffice it to say that it is a bit more than B-Movie fare. A-Minus Movie fare (if there was such a thing) would be more like it! It is very well done, very well cast, and one can tell that a lot of care went into the making of this film. It is too bad that it didn't get more of a theatrical release. What does one have to do these days to get their movie in a theater besides cater to the completely talentless, like Miley Cyrus, and the semi-talentless, like the Jonas Brothers?  Only one drawback with this one IMO, and it has been mentioned here on many accounts:  Not enough of Ron Perlman and his character. His role could have had loads to do with the entire production, but it was definitely a throw-away. Too Bad! Other than that...a great time!  Star Factor: 4 1/2 Stars

B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|Haven't seen it yet but have read the book (disability makes it difficult for me to sit in a theater for hours) so I have to wait for the DVD release.  If this is anything like the book, it will be awesome.  I also can't wait to see Karl Urban playing McCoy.  I am a die hard Classic Trek ONLY fan and like many people of this generation felt this was going to be all about the destruction of Star Trek as we knew it, BUT, and here's the thing, JJ Abrams has been SO clever in setting this in an alternate reality, not only has he followed the Vulcan philosophy of IDIC (see title) but by setting it thus he can do whatever he likes (within reason) and it won't ever sully canon (ie the original series stands as it is, no harm, no foul).    I can't wait to se it, wish I was able to see it in theaters but sadly have to wait for the DVD, come on paramount give us a release date!!!
B000EMGJM2|5.0|Let me start of by saying there is no way you hear the greatness of this album on the first listen. Initially, it sounds too off beat, its difficult to follow the melody, and different influences seem to hit you out of nowehere. But somewhere around the third listen you begin to learn the lyrics, you begin to anticipate the drifting guitars and all the other little bells and whistles. There is no album quite like this one, a sound that only On The Jungle Floor owns, forcing you to readily come back to it for more. Something so original as a whole you won't find it elsewhere. I wish originality was more the norm than the exception to the rule.
B00005JPMZ|5.0|Being a previous fan boy of the turtles as a toddler in the early 90's and after watching this film, it reminded me how I fell in love with the turtles in the first place. That being said, this film is well paced with action packed sequences and filled with trademark TMNT humor that should appeal to all ages.
B000BYA5G4|5.0|I thought this movie was well directed and well made. Although, it may not appeal to every audience because this film is paced as a documentary of Cage's character so there is plenty of dialogue and it may become rather boring due to the lack of action sequences. But the performance and depth of the casts truly makes up for it.
B001KVZ6FM|5.0|Disney/Pixar's \\"Up\\" is such a wonderful film, one that can make you laugh just as much as it can wow you with its sense of good old fashioned adventure. It features characters that are both funny and endearing, which is to say that they surpass mere cartoon goofiness and go for something more meaningful. The plot is both a harrowing journey and a flight of fancy, both of which can easily appeal to any child that loves hearing a good bedtime story. Because many adults keep that part of themselves alive (and I count myself as one of them), this movie can appeal to them too. It's become quite clear that the Pixar team really knows what they're doing; even after the release of ten films, they remain as fresh and exciting as ever. They're not merely masters of computer animation, but also of direction and screenwriting.    Released theatrically in both 2-D and 3-D formats, \\"Up\\" tells the gratifying story of Carl Fredrickson (voiced by Edward Asner), an elderly man who grew up loving adventure and idolizing an aviation expert named Charles Muntz. For many years, Carl was happily married to his childhood best friend, Ellie, also an adventure lover. Upon her death, he finds himself both longing for excitement and in a struggle with construction workers, who are building high rises directly next to his quaint wooden house. So as to escape spending his remaining days in a retirement home, Carl ties thousands of balloons to his home, allowing it to lift off its foundation and sail through the air like an airship. He hopes to fulfill on the dream he and Ellie shared: To go to the South American wonder of nature known as Paradise Falls.    Much to Carl's chagrin, he's picked up a passenger. Enter Russell (voiced by Jordan Nagai), a Boy Scout very intent on earning his final merit badge (assisting a senior citizen). Inexperienced but admirably determined to explore the wilderness, pudgy little Russell immediately gets on the old man's nerves; he's not a companion so much as he'sextra baggage, a talkative young man who inadvertently makes things more difficult than they need be. As time goes on, however, Carl begins to see Russell in a different light, not as a liability, but merely as a boy who's still in the process of growing up. He's at just the age of discovering the difference between things that sound fun and things that actually aren't. He's also at the age when he tries to make sense of why he so rarely sees his father, who works all the time.    Upon their arrival in South America, Carl and Russell begin the long and dangerous process of pulling the floating house towards a majestic waterfall, where Ellie had always wanted their house to be located. They have to hurry, though; the helium in the balloons is starting to lose its lifting power. As the journey forward, they meet an elderly Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer), who has gone mad with the desire to prove to the world that a rare species of bird actually exists. When he learns that one of those birds has been spotted by Carl and Russell--a tall, brightly feathered fowl Russell names Kevin--it becomes a life or death struggle for survival, not merely for the bird, but for everyone involved.    There's a beauty to this movie that goes beyond the vivid color palate and striking scenery. The story is a perfect combination of mature themes and childlike whimsy, and the characters can tickle our funny bones just as easily as they can warm our hearts. They're not shallow cartoon caricatures but fully developed individuals with surprisingly realistic personality quirks. You actually care for them. This applies, strangely enough, to a series of dogs owned by Charles, each equipped with a special collar that translates their mannerisms into human speech; the lead dog is an adorable golden retriever named Dug (voiced by Bob Peterson, the film's writer and co-director). In spite of their ability to speak, the emotional essence of real dogs remains unchanged--Dug loves unconditionallyand proves useful, but he's also very easily distracted by small things like tennis balls and the possibility that a squirrel is nearby.    There's also beauty to film's simplicity, which basically reaffirms the idea that convoluted plots and cumbersome details don't always make a film more interesting. There are essentially five main characters, and they're engaged in a story that aims to entertain rather than challenge. Obviously, there are times when story should aim to challenge. Case in point: Last year's Disney/Pixar film \\"WALL-E,\\" which achieved greatness in large part because of its well-rounded social commentary on wastefulness and gluttony. But in the case of a film like \\"Up,\\" there was no reason to make a point of any kind; even its message of living life to the fullest isn't forced on the audience. It just wanted to be a charming story, and a charming story it is. Young and old alike will adore \\"Up,\\" one of the year's most delightful films.

Therefor I purchased the Easy Tarot Handbook and I must say that this book is really a treasure, well written and easy to understand. It surely didn't hurt at all that the Tarot deck that came with the book is by far the most beautiful I have ever seen. My first thought was that finally I had found my deck.   I'm so impressed with this book that I would like to translate in icelandic so that many more can benefit of this book and Tarot deck.

B000001Y5X|3.0|I have been listening to all of Marilyn Manson's albums in the weeks awaiting his newest release \\"The High End of Low\\" which was just released May 26th, 2009. I spent much of my teen years listening to Marilyn Manson and consider myself a big fan of his work. But this does not make me biased in any way towards the high and lows (no pun intended) of his career. So this is my review series of all his albums. Hope you get to check them all out.<br /><br />I really rate this album 3 1/2 stars.  Its a decent album.  For this review I will state the good followed by the bad.<br /><br />THE GOOD:<br />This album is raw.  It is full of angst ridden rock n roll!  I can't think of any 16 year old kid who wouldn't like listening to this kind of music besides today's idiotic teens who only seem to listen to hip hop (and not even the good kind).  It has a good amount of singles and it shows the beginning of a great musical act.  For a debut album it is pretty good.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />This album is lacking in the quality of music.  That is common with a debut album. Yes it has some really great tracks, but those tracks are also few and far between.  They are overshadowed by some not so good tracks.  Many that just seem like filler.  You can tell that the band is still trying to find itself and it shows.<br /><br />This album is pretty much the standard debut.  It is raw, in your face, aggressive, and all over the place.  The other problem with this album is that the angst feel to it is the kind that most people grow out of.  It is a very \\"Teen angst\\" oriented album.  If I had wrote this review back when I was 16, I would have given it a much higher rating.  In other words it hasn't stood the test of time in my opinion.  I am much older now and I find that I prefer Mechanical Animals and Holywood much more than this album.  That is not saying the album is bad.  For a debut it is great.  But I am glad that the band evolved onto bigger and better things.  There are many people out there with what I call \\"Debut album syndrome\\" in which they like the first album and the first album only of many bands.  So much in fact that they will not listen to any of the other albums and they would definitely disagree on my review on this album.  However I am not one of those people.  I cannot stand it when a band does not evolve.  For better or worse it is a band's duty to evolve and make every album different in my opinion and Marilyn Manson definitely does not fail on that aspect!  Anyways, here is a track listing:<br /><br />1. \\"Prelude (The Family Trip)\\"  1:20<br />2. \\"Cake and Sodomy\\"  3:46<br />3. \\"Lunchbox\\"  4:32<br />4. \\"Organ Grinder\\"  4:22<br />5. \\"Cyclops\\"  3:32<br />6. \\"Dope Hat\\"  4:21<br />7. \\"Get Your Gunn\\"  3:18<br />8. \\"Wrapped In Plastic\\"  5:35<br />9. \\"Dogma\\"  3:22<br />10. \\"Sweet Tooth\\"  5:03<br />11. \\"Snake Eyes and Sissies\\"  4:07<br />12. \\"My Monkey\\"  4:31<br />13. \\"Misery Machine\\" (with bonus track. actual song is 5:08)13:09<br /><br />This album is not a bad album by any means.  I like it alot and will listen to it from time to time.  Especially those days when I am full of alot of angst.  Angst doesn't go away over time...  you just have alot less of it!  I sort of grew out of this album.  And in terms of music that is not a great thing.  That is why I am reviewing it in such a way.  I will note that Wrapped in Plastic is my favorite song on the album and should have been a single.  It is a great song that shows the direction Manson and co. were heading.  Its like a preview of everything after it.  If you haven't listened to this album yet, definitely check it out.  If you only check out one song, definitely check out \\"Wrapped in Plastic\\".  It is not an essential album and all of the best songs are easily on \\"Lest we forget: The best of\\"  Except of course \\"Wrapped in Plastic\\"  So get all the songs that are on Best of plus \\"wrapped in plastic\\" and you have the best this album has to offer!bum syndrome\\" in which they like the first album and the first album only of many bands.

0439023483|5.0|Great book.  Seriously, great.  I won't go into a description, but I would recommend this: DO NOT READ A LOT OF DESCRIPTIONS BEFORE READING THIS BOOK.  I think descriptions of this book give away way too much of the book.  If you can, don't read any at all.  Makes the book that much better.    This is a good book.  It moves at a good pace -- not too fast, not too slow.  It has adventure, suspense, futuristic settings, turmoil, personal pain, overcoming, a bit of romance -- but a GOOD amount of romance; there isn't so much you are rolling your eyes and there's just enough romance to make you wonder what will happen with the characters.  I can't stand a book that portrays love as sappy and filled with really sappy vocabulary; this book does not.  It makes you wonder what is going to happen next.  I can't wait for the next book.    I'd also say this book works for both guys and gals -- it is written from a girl's perspective, but it isn't girly.      Also, I'd say that this book really isn't for anyone under the age of 10 or so.  It's got some violence in there.  Some of it is a bit disturbing but definitely necessary to the plot.  I really think it is more of a book for the 15ish + crowd.    Do yourself a favor, pick up this book and read it.  Get yourself or your young adult daughters hooked on it.  This is MUCH better than the crap known as Twilight.
B000001Y2U|4.0|I have been listening to all of Marilyn Manson's albums in the weeks awaiting his newest release \\"The High End of Low\\" which was just released May 26th, 2009. I spent much of my teen years listening to Marilyn Manson and consider myself a big fan of his work. But this does not make me biased in any way towards the high and lows (no pun intended) of his career. So this is my review series of all his albums. Hope you get to check them all out.<br /><br />Ok so to begin with this review we have to look back at the debut of this album.  It was the later part of the mid 90's and grunge was dying out.  The music that seemed the most popular at the time was R&B and Pop.  It was just before the explosion of boy bands and we all know how music may not have ever fully recovered since then!  So for this album to release when it did was a huge risk in it's success.  It almost seemed out of place.  But that obviously did not stop the album's success!  Along with the other 95% of Marilyn Manson fans, this is the first I had ever heard of Marilyn Manson.  Yes I listened to his debut album much much later.  Most people had never heard of Marilyn Manson before and he comes out with \\"Beautiful People\\" and it just blows everyone away!<br /><br />After this album came out, Marilyn Manson became a household name!  It didn't matter if you were a rocker, goth, metal head, punk, christian, rapper, etc...  you were talking about this album.  It didn't even matter if you listened to it or not... it is just the fact that everyone heard of it!  I am just going out on a limb here but I am going to say that the title had a little something to do with all that.  Antichrist Superstar!  What a genius idea!  I mean even the people who hated Manson were at the very least talking about him!  I used to go to youth groups at the churches and they could not stop talking about him.  Although many of the things they were saying were negative it still didn't matter and people were talking about it!<br /><br />This album and Marilyn Manson's mysterious ways led to alot of talk and speculation.  I remember hearing the most vulgar and disturbing of rumors about this guy.  Most people were afraid of him... or just afraid to admit that they actually liked him.  And the rumors were stupid, really stupid.  Maybe it didn't help that I was in Junior High the time this came out.  I mean everyone is alot more gullible and naive in junior high.  And some of the rumors were so stupid looking back on them now.  But all these rumors may be the very thing that made Marilyn Manson the icon he is today!  I mean it go me to buy the album!  To see what all the fuss was about!<br /><br />And that brings me to my thoughts on this album.  This a a great album but not his greatest.  Musically it is good, definitely a B+.  Did the album live up to the hype?  Yes it did!  In every way.  It is unlike many sophomore albums that suffer from \\"Sophomore album syndrome\\" where the 2nd album does not live up to the hype of the 1st album.  But this can also be due to the fact that in many ways for many people this album was the debut.  I mean most people had not heard of him until this CD.  His debut album was not mainstream compared to this one.<br /><br />The one thing I don't like about this album is that to me it is not as musically developed of some of his later albums.  Its like a bridge between Portrait of an American Family and Mechanical Animals that is leading up to the pinnacle.  But it is nevertheless amazing!  It is my 3rd favorite album by Marilyn Manson so it has to count for something.  It just might be slightly overrated.  And by slightly I mean very slightly.  Here is the track list:<br /><br />1. \\"Irresponsible Hate Anthem\\"  4:17<br />2. \\"The Beautiful People\\"  3:38<br />3. \\"Dried Up, Tied and Dead to the World\\"  4:16<br />4. \\"Tourniquet\\"  4:45<br />5. \\"Little Horn\\"  2:43<br />6. \\"Cryptorchid\\"  2:44<br />7. \\"Deformography\\" 4:31<br />8. \\"Wormboy\\"  3:56<br />9. \\"Mister Superstar\\"  5:04<br />10. \\"Angel with the Scabbed Wings\\"  3:52<br />11. \\"Kinderfeld\\"  4:51<br />12. \\"Antichrist Superstar\\"  5:14<br />13. \\"1996\\"  4:01<br />14. \\"Minute of Decay\\"  4:44<br />15. \\"The Reflecting God\\"  5:36<br />16. \\"Man That You Fear\\"  6:10<br />99. Untitled (hidden track) 1:39<br /><br />All in all it a great album and if you haven't heard it yet, you must!  It is one of three full length albums that are worth owning.  Antichrist Superstar, Mechanical Animals, and Holywood are all worth owning.  They are the essential 3 and there is no doubt about it.  I am not saying that you shouldn't own any of the others...  Heck I own them all!  But if you own only a handful of Marilyn Manson albums, these are the ones to own.  Funny how they are looked at as a trilogy because they truly are the 3 essentials.  Love him, hate him, it doesn't matter because we have all contributed to his fame.

B001PNVYMO|4.0|Initially wrote a review for this and did not like disc one very much. But like most PSB material, this one has really grwon me. Revised comments appear within the original review below in UPPERCASE.    A solid follow up, but a bit lacking as compared with 2006's FUNDAMENTAL. Solid material, with a half-dozen or so instant gems (Love Etc., All Over the World, Did You See Me Coming, The Way It Used to Be, More Than a Dream) and several tracks that sound as if they were recorded just to fill the track list (Pandemonium, Beautiful People, Legacy, Vulnerable, Building a Wall). [SEE, NOW MOST OF THESE ARE TERRIFIC SONGS; JUST TOOK A FEW LISTENS TO REALLY BECOME INTOXICATED WITH THEM. PANEDMONIUM IN PARTICULAR IS AMAZING PSB.] A few of these are as bad as Young Offender (from many years back) and sound as if they were slapped together quite quickly. [THIS REALLY APPLIES TO 'BUILDING A WALL' WHICH, IN RETROSPECT, IS THE ONLY TRACK NOT UP TO PAR WITH THE OTHERS.] But the good material more than compensates for a few weaker tracks.    The two-disc edition (extremely overpriced, unfortunately) includes a half-dozen remixes, and these are simply amazing. The Pandemonium dub mix is fantastic. It should have been on disc 1 as it far exceeds that version. A bonus track on this disc, This Used to Be the Future, is also very, very good. Again, this would have been perfect for disc 1. It harkens back to The Buggles, which will make more sense if you hear it. Chris contributes quite heavily to the vocals on this track, and it's a lot of fun. The remix of More Than a Dream is textbook PSB; simly wonderful. It's so good I could just put it on a loop and listen all day...and probably will.    I'm always amazed by how prolific PSB are. They continually publish new material that always shines. You may love them or hate them, but you must admit they work diligently at their craft, and very rarely disappoint.
B000LZ6DM8|4.0|Back in the early 90's I picked up a copy of Natural History because that was the only way to get the single My Foolish Friend at the time. I already had the first three Talk Talk albums. This newer release of the compilation is missing two live tracks recorded at the Hammerlsmith Odeon: LIFE'S WHAT YOU MAKE IT and TOMORROW'S STARTED. The trade off? You get all of the music videos Talk Talk ever released on a DVD.<br /><br />That's right. This one and only edition of Natural History that has a separate DVD of Talk Talk music videos. The only other place to get them was a VHS release also called Natural History, and now you have them on a digital hard copy. Better yet the VHS didn't have both versions of the video TALK TALK (just the artsy one with the people talking with their hands). How's that for best bang for the buck? Keep in mind while this is an all-region DVD it is in PAL format (the U.S. standard is NTSC). Make sure your DVD player can run PAL (I can confirm the Playstation 3 does).<br /><br />This compilation is a really good representation of the band's work on their first four albums. More emphasis is on songs from their most popular albums, It's My Life and Colour of Spring. That's okay because you still get what I consider their two best songs from The Party's Over and the two most accessable songs from Spirit of Eden. I prefer having the individual albums because there are lots of greats songs to enjoy, but if you just want a sampling of the band this is the way to go. I believe the audio tracks are remastered as well so you are getting the same fidelity as the newly remastered albums have.<br /><br />In conclusion if you like IT'S MY LIFE and want to hear more without investing in their five album collection AND want the best sounding versions of the songs AND like their videos this is the album to get. If you aren't into videos then go for the previously released non-import version. You would only miss the remastering on tracks from the first two albums. Plus you would get two bonus live tracks as well. All you TT fans should get this as well if just for the videos (and one of the few places you can get MY FOOLISH FRIEND) alone.get two bonus live tracks as well. All you TT fans should get this as well if just for the videos (and one of the few places you can get MY FOOLISH FRIEND) alone.
B000HEZF0O|5.0|It's a shame that everyone focused on Tom Cruises Oprah appearance than realizing how good MI:3 was.  Each director brings their own take on the Ethan Hunt character and despite a few loopholes they're enjoyable.  It'as also amazing how far movie production had come from the first to the third.
0307266303|5.0|There are a few books out there that will make you want to immediately put on your running shoes and get out for a run, and \\"Born to Run\\" is one of them - tip, if you want to enjoy both at the same time, pick it up in the audio version!<br /><br />Most of the book is focused on the amazing Tarahumara (the running people) tribe that the author discovered during one of his trips to Mexico and his consequent quest to uncover their secrets. Christopher McDougall does a great job of capturing the characters and the idiosyncrasies of both the sport and the competitors, it's a real page turner. Sprinkled throughout the book are numerous and fascinating discussions on our anatomy, evolution, nutrition and training regimen - you're bound to discover something new. Highly recommended!
1595141715|5.0|I have to give this book all 5 stars. Although I did not like the open ending. Most teenagers at one point or another do think about suicide and as I have read some of the other reviews your the stereo typical person who thinks that people commit suicide for attention. Because thats just what a dead person wants to do draw attention to them self. Hannah's story is one that is more common in today's community than ever. If you watched the news lately. You would see that two 13 year old boys committed suicide because they just could not take life or school anymore. I wish more schools would have open discussion about suicide and depression. It only takes one person to change a person's life. Jay Asher gives a voice to thousands of Teenage girls that have committed suicide and never got the chance to say why. It is a Must Read but you must have an open mind.

0061053147|5.0|This book is just great. Readable, and interesting, everything you never thought of asking about Bladerunner is in here. Details & thoughts by the actors , how they made the cars, whatever...   If you love Bladerunner this book will just make it even more interesting. The main thing i like about it though is that you can just pick it up & start reading anywhere & it'll entertain you.   It should have been twice as long maybe, it raises more questions, but let's face it you'll never know all the details of any film, only the Lord himself does. There's so much in this that its well worth getting. It was a far better book than i'd expected.

B0002E5O9G|5.0|This is an outstanding musical performance and you find yourself humming the songs for days.  It's a wonderful collection at a very reasonable price.  Would highly recommend!
0142403873|5.0|This is a book that both children and adults love. My key point to you (if you're a parent) - you won't tire of reading this book to your kids (unlike other books). The story/humor is very fun and great illustrations. The story is essentially about a mouse that goes for a walk in the woods, and how it manages to fend off other bigger creatures by being extremely clever.    We fell in love with the book, that we've given this as a gift many times - and all our friends have thanked us heartily to introducing them. Don't worry - buy this book now, you'll love it.    We also recommend the follow-on, the Gruffalo's Child.

0312370849|5.0|I loved this book.  Started it in the morning and finished it just before dinner.  I literally could not put the book down.    Enjoyed the way the author told two completely different stories at the same time.  The historical material regarding the Holocaust was tear-wrenching.  I was not aware of the particular events related in the story of July 16, 1942 -- we should all be better educated about these matters -- especially when there are some that tout their beliefs that the horrors of the war years never happened.    Don't miss reading this book -- you'll be glad you did on may levels.
B00280LYIC|1.0|WOW! This book was amazing! This book is a rival for the infamous Harry Potter series. I absoloutly LOVED this book. Percy is a cool kid.

If you liked her other novels \\"Devil Wears Prada\\" or \\"Everyone Worth Knowing\\" I am sure you will enjoy this one too. I cant wait for her next one!
B000066C6Z|2.0|There a a few okay gags, but just okay, and the pace was too slow. Certainly nowhere near as good as Airplane, and if that's a 5-star, this one, by comparison is lucky to get 2 stars. Well, even the Zuckers/Abrahams combo can have an off day. I kinda liked the cow though. One star was for the cow.

B001IUBZAU|1.0|What is wrong with ac/dc? They say they sold their souls to the devil. That devil must be Wal Mart, how Rock and Roll. I guess I can't buy their music since I don't belong to that exclusive club. Why no downloads either? Am I the only one who thinks that it absolutely wrong for a band to blatantly sell out like that? Eagles included. Are they really hurting for money? I don't get it. I don't like green day, but at least they don't let it bother them that Wally world won't carry their music. I don't have to listen to this cd to give a review, Angus himself says they keep making the same album over and over. People keep buying it, I don't get it. What happened to all the bands that had integrity. I can't think of any but Led Zep. Everyone else is into American Idol, Rock Band and Guitar hero, how cheesy. Its a shame that there will never be another classic album or song written ever.
B000K7UG34|4.0|This movie it's great, the picture it's clear and the sound it's amazing. There are some scenes were the clarity it's not that good, showing grain and black distortion, bit most of the film looks very good.

0307269752|5.0|This book grabs you into the arms of the characters. Salander is the most lovable character to come along in quite some time. She's so funky and different that you can't help but fall in love with her. Blomkvist is hard to fathom which makes it all the more intriguing. It pricks at the conscience to find yourself cheering her on in some of her most outrageous stunts, but you can't help yourself. You just love her, and thank your lucky stars that you don't have a daughter like her.<br />I just finished reading (in 5 days) the second book in the Trilogy (The Girl Who Played with Fire) and found it even better than the first.

B001KVZ6FM|5.0|With their 10th theatrical release 'Up' Pixar continues to prove that they are the best film production studio out there today.  Continually improving their animating abilities (no matter what Pixar movie it is I am awestruck at the quality) and writing ORIGINAL (sans the very average Cars) stories, the geniuses out west could take the easy route but that is not the Pixar way.<br /><br />If you have seen the trailers you are no doubt focused on the balloons that carry the lead role away in his house but the main focus is that this is a LOVE STORY.  The first 10 minutes are some of Pixar's best work ever which is very analogous to the first 30 minutes of WALL-E which is brought down by a very average 2nd and 3rd act (WALL-E).  We learn of Carl Fredricksen falling in love with Elle, are quickly shown highlights of their happy life together and their continual goal to go on a great adventure in South America.  A great adventure that they never were able to take together due to lack of money and Elle's death (this is a deeper movie than other Pixar productions so be prepared to talk to your kids).<br /><br />After Elle is gone, Carl decides that he must take action to go on that adventure they never got to do.  Along the way he meets up with a young boy, talking dog(s), crazy bird and an antagonist that Karl must defeat.<br /><br />The animation in Up is of course top notch.  The story is creative and original, and it's a joy to watch.  The only thing that hurts this movie is it's not very kid-friendly in my opinion.  I took my 4 1/2 year old daughter and 30 minutes in she wanted to leave (we stayed for the whole thing).  I feel the main audience for this movie is adults and senior citizens (yes I am serious) with children and teenagers second this time around.  Kids will probably like it but not like Toy Story, Monsters or Nemo.<br /><br />For fun I will rank the Pixar movies according to me but this is completely subjective.  If you search the web about the only constant you will find is that Cars is the weakest movie, as for the rest, everyone has their favorites.<br /><br />#01 The Incredibles<br />#02 Monsters, Inc.<br />#03 Finding Nemo<br />#04 Ratatouille<br />#05 WALL-E<br />#06 Up<br />#07 Toy Story 2<br />#08 Toy Story<br />#09 A Bug's Life<br />#10 Cars<br /><br />***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDs the weakest movie, as for the rest, everyone has their favorites.    #01 The Incredibles  #02 Monsters, Inc.  #03 Finding Nemo  #04 Ratatouille  #05 WALL-E  #06 Up  #07 Toy Story 2  #08 Toy Story  #09 A Bug's Life  #10 Cars    ***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B001DF68MA|4.0|This seat was easy to install and has worked very well. The harness is comfortable as the buckle system is well-designed for a seated child. We did find the platform/head rest interesting but removed it when the edges of the platform came to close to the handlebars, leading to a situation which could pinch a child's hand quite significantly. Test out turning the handlebar without the child seated to look for this potentiality.
0765316897|5.0|The single distinguishing feature of Sanderson's Mistborn series:satisfying.  Each book stands on its own as complete, consistent, and clever, and this final novel caps the trilogy admirably.  No hiding behind lame literary tricks, such as revealing crucial information only at the end, in this story. And finally, a fantasy series, with a fully-realized and compelling world and characters, is wrapped up within three books.    Sanderson became more comfortable exercising his prose and perspective in this last book, and it is the strongest in the trilogy.  Action-packed.  Ties up all the loose endings, without lameness.  Clever magic system.  Interesting characters.  Some modest political intrigue.  Very few 'nuke the fridge' moments that defy plausible suspension of disbelief (within the fantasy setting).    Note to Brandon Sanderson and publishers: the hard-bound covers are beautiful, and I am proud to display them on my bookshelf, because they really do suit the stories within.  I have, in fact, given two copies to non-fantasy-reader friends after they noticed the cover art and picked it off the shelf--both have been successfully converted to reading good fantasy fiction--something to be proud of!  Meanwhile, the (new) paperback cover art lacks any unique style.  Must be misguided marketing/differentiation reasons, too bad.  If the goal was to blend in with the thousands of mediocre fantasy novels at the book store--mission (unfortunately) accomplished.

0446364495|1.0|I was extremely disappointed in this book. Over the years, this book was just in my \\"want to read it when I get around to it\\" category. Imagine my disappointment when I finally got around to reading this after anticipating a masterpiece of literature. I had so many people tell me this was such a great book, even the lady at the cash register at the bookstore.    I'm glad to see that I'm not the only one that was disgruntled with this one. I thought it just started slow, but I couldn't get into it at all. The authors word choices didn't really agree with me, I caught myself stopping and restarting a sentence just to make sure I read it correctly.     It wasn't a long read by any means, but I was exhausted by the time I finished. Maybe this is the one time the movie is superior to the book. I haven't seen the movie...but it couldn't be much worse.     I didn't enjoy reading about a wife that cheats on her husband. That's not romantic for me. Not unless the affair made her see the error of her ways and that led to a better relationship with her husband after actually talking to the poor dope.

0375704027|4.0|I recently finished reading Rubin's translation of _Noruwei no mori_ -- this time with my students for a modern Japanese literature course.  Although I haven't gotten back from course evaluations from them, I am very confident that they enjoyed this novel.  This is a great book to read in a reading group.  Murakami's characters will have you loving or hating them.  There is a lot to talk about with this novel.  Certainly it must be one of Murakami's most accessible novels.  No strange happenings here and the characters, like Americans, tend to reference things in their lives to American pop songs, novels, etc.  It might be fair to call this book \\"The Great American Novel Not Written by an American.\\"  At the same time, the book tells us a lot about Japan, an alternate view, as it were of the 60s from the point of view of someone sitting un-popularly not on the hard left.    A final note about the translation.  It is wonderful.  Although I sometimes hear that Rubin has some detractors out there, for me (and I think for most of my students who finished reading the novel in less than a week), his prose just purrs.  I positively love the way he handles porting the humor into English.  There were many, many times that I laughed out loud -- even though I've read the book before.  It stands up.  I know the book can be dark, but the balance is preserved here I think thanks to Rubin's skill.
B000000W6X|5.0|Amazon has logistics down to a fine art...product was received in excellent conditions an within 24hrs, wow!
B0017VG69U|4.0|The remastered edition of the original Star Trek series is an odd combination of spectacular technical improvements together with unbelievably underwhelming packaging effects.  Honestly, I am still scratching my head trying to figure this one out, as I consider how great the new edition is otherwise.  So, this review will focus on the general positives of the remastered edition as well as the negatives of the horrendous packaging.    To begin with, the original Star Trek series is as excellent as ever, of course.  The remastering and added effects make it all even better, if that seems possible.  The clarity, color, contrast, definition, etc. are way beyond anything you've ever before seen.  Gone are the faded, washed-out colors and artifact flak that years of analog viewers have grown to know and subconsciously endear.  Gone are the effects that mostly always seemed needing to be better anyway.  Gone is essentially everything that would have been better off gone, replaced only with what really is just plain better.  I know there'll always be the purists who insist that classics such as this should never be tampered with in any way.  I know there are those who consider it pure treason to even think of altering something such as Star Trek.  I used to be one who thought much the same way.    For those still compelled to resist, let's not forget that what we saw and grew to love on CRT TVs with analog signals was NOT what the real masters of the series ever looked like anyway.  Let's not forget that what we see from these new remastered discs is just what was always meant to be seen anyway.  The masters of every episode, safely locked away, are themselves high definition, finally able to be seen as they really are.  Finally, technology has found a way to deliver the series as it was always intended.  Seriously, who ever really meant for us to see all the flak and dust spots jumping and dancing across the screen?  What is there to love about that?  Original or not, it'snever too soon or late to get rid of that, if you ask me.      Again, as for the new effects, I must stress that they are only an improvement of the original effects.  Nothing about the spirit of original designs, etc. is compromised in any remastered episode I've seen so far.  For example, in The \\"Doomsday Machine\\", in series two, the doomsday robot ship is not changed in its design.  It looks as it did in the original, it just looks more defined and more realistic.  What could ever be wrong with that?  Space itself, planets, the Enterprise, and all other ships again just simply look better, more like they should look.  Yes, most of the improved effects occur in space, about space, and/or related to things encountered in space.  Most improvements are with things that mostly looked more unrealistic in the original and benefited greatly by being improved and made more realistic.  In no scene with added effects does anything look starkly different, out of place, or awkward.  Here, we have all of the original characters, interior ship designs, props, etc., but the environment, planets, and ships outside just look better.  If they had instead changed things about the interior design of ships, props, costumes, etc., then I would not be at all happy myself.  However again, that is not at all the case in this superior edition.  I heard somewhere that Gene Roddenberry himself, after seeing the first Star Trek movie, said he always wanted the Enterprise to look that way.  Well, if it's what Gene always wanted, then it's certainly good enough for me too!      The only reason I gave this product four instead of five stars is due to the packaging, believe it or not.  Yes, this is a general product review as well, rather than a simple review of a classic, time-tested fan favorite.  The series itself is, of course, beyond meaningful criticism at this point.  However again, the packaging is not.  It is on the other extreme of the rating spectrum.  The packaging is, quite simply,the worst I've ever seen in my entire extensive time collecting DVDs.  Yes, I thought I had seen some bad ones before, but this one is light years beyond in negative features.  To begin with, the case itself is not user friendly, it is fragile, and far from practical.  When I open it, it comes apart completely, into two pieces, more often than it simply opens.  Once open, the DVDs are in a booklike container made of a very thin, flimsy plastic destined to break, no matter how careful one tries to be.  The circular release (as it is supposed to be) in the middle of each DVD is so inflexible that it will not ( I stress NOT!) release the disc when depressed.  You will have to push it so hard that you will feel pain in your thumb, you will need to rotate the use of your thumbs for strength, and you will still ironically break the case in the process.  In many cases (no pun intended), I had to put the DVD book page on a soft surface and depress the release, only to still wind up breaking the case.  In nearly every attempt, a crack developed radially across the plastic DVD holder.  Yes, you will also hear the crack very distinctly as it happens!  It seems that whoever designed this packaging system did not attempt to remove a disc on the prototype.  This package is actually so incredibly horrible that I am still dumbfounded to imagine the motives of its creator.  If frustrating and angering the consumer was the goal, then it has certainly been achieved here.  Since it took me so long to remove the discs, and since the package was so damaged afterwards, I never even returned the discs to the original package.  Instead, I put each disc in a separate CD case where I currently store them on a shelf.  No, I don't like it, but I had no real choice either.  Yes, this is a \\"Collector's Edition\\", but you'll have to collect them in something other than the case provided.    Now, even with such horrendous packaging, is it all still worth the money?  Yes, for sure!  I, for one, evenwith all the packaging headaches, went ahead and bought the other two seasons, as well.  If this is the only way to have such a wonderfully-remastered version of a classic sci-fi series, then this is the way I'll have it.  Don't let that stop you either.  Just have the spare CD cases ready.  You'll surely need them.  As Spock would say, \\"It is not logical, but it is often true.\\"
B001FB4W0W|5.0|True Blood is based on the Sookie Stackhouse books by Charlaine Harris, which I have read about six of (there are nine or ten in the series so far, I believe). I am completely nuts about these books and find them perfect escapist fiction, filled as they are with a mind-reading bar maid, shapeshifters, werewolves, witches...and lots and lots of vampires. And it's all set in a charming little Louisiana backwater town called Bon Temps. The books are really cool...and way better than those Twilight books.<br /><br />Anyway, I was really excited to see the DVD of the first season of True Blood since it was based on these books I can't get enough of, but also because the series had Alan Ball behind it, the creator of another of my all-time entertainment favorites, Six Feet Under. I (gulp) pre-ordered my DVD set from Amazon months before it was even out because we no longer subscribe to HBO and I was too impatient to wait for the series to come piecemeal via Netflix.<br /><br />So, this week the boyfriend and I hunkered down in front of the HD TV every night and devoured the series in about four sittings, much like a hungry vampire at a hemophiliac's convention.<br /><br />Did it live up to my expectations? Oh yes, and in some ways, even surpassed them. From its opening credits (some of the best I've ever seen), True Blood is a true masterpiece of television. It has just the right southern goth vibe, perfect casting, and a storyline that will keep you guessing right up to the end, provided you haven't read the books. And if you have read the books, you'll enjoy it even more. Ball takes some liberties with Harris's literary territory, but his changes only serve to expand and improve on what Harris wrote.<br /><br />My only dilemma? How can I wait now for Season Two on DVD when it's just begun its HBO run?
0762434279|1.0|does abridged mean the same as miniature?? This isn't quite what I had in mind. This \\"book\\" fits in the palm of your hand, covers some of the very high points and would make a great \\"gag gift\\" for some kind of party.  I'm sure it is just what it is described as and I just don't understand the description. I am sure that no one else would make the same mistake I did.
B001KVZ6FM|5.0|After the failure of \\"Wall-E\\" it's good to see Pixar has redeemed themselves with another great movie. As a fan of Pixar I think they have done a fantastic job with \\"Up\\". The 3D effect was very cool. It was my first full-length 3D movie and I found the effect simple and not overdone. No headaches either. In short, the movie was funny, charming, lovable characters, heartwarming, well written, clever and the animation was outstanding. A couple of little PC lessons were in the movie but not enough to mention. I did like the overall theme of the importants of a man in a child's life. Seems us men get villainized more then we get endorsed.<br /><br />Due to the PG rating I did not bring my 3 year old with me. There were a few short scary scenes that would have bothered him but most of the movie would be considered G rated. Because we do not have TV at home my son is not used to (or desensitized to) violence or intense movie scenes but if your child is accustomed to it I think this PG movie should be okay for them. It really was very mild.<br /><br />The short was also amusing. Not their best but entertaining non-the-less.<br /><br />Note: As great a character as Dug the dog is it's not an original idea. Dexter's Lab season 2 episode 65 \\"Dexter's Lab: A Story\\" did the same exact thing. Both are very funny.
0739333771|5.0|In this dramatic reading by John Lee, Booker Prize-winning author John Banville's sensitive and remarkably complete character study of Max Morden comes alive in new ways. An art critic/writer from Ireland whose wife has just died of a lingering illness, Max, seeking solace, has checked into the Cedars, a now-dilapidated guest house in the seaside village of Ballyless, where he and his family spent their summers when he was a child. There he spent hours in the company of Chloe and Myles Grace, his constant companions. Images of foreboding suggest that some tragedy occurred while he was there. While at the Cedars, he contemplates the nature of life, love, and death, and our imperfect memories of these momentous events.<br /><br />As Max probes his recollections, he reveals his most intimate feelings, constantly questioning the accuracy of his memory, and juxtaposing his childhood memories with his recent memories of his wife Anna's \\"inappropriate\\" illness and her futile treatments. Through flashbacks, he also introduces us to his earlier life with Anna and his fervent hopes that through her he could become someone more interesting. \\"I was always a distinct no-one, whose fiercest wish was to be an indistinct someone,\\" he says, confessing that he saw her as \\"the fairground mirror in which all my distortions would be made straight.\\"<br /><br />The Irish brogue of reader John Lee and his sensitivity to the poetry of Banville's language, with its internal rhyme, its dream-like imagery, and its alliteration, bring the reading to life.  More a meditation than a novel with a strong plot, Lee makes Max a fascinating character (as fascinating as a man with a limited life can be), recreating his seemingly simple, yet often profound, thoughts in language which will startle the reader into recognition of their universality. To some extent an everyman, Max speaks to the reader in uniquely intimate ways.<br /><br />The reading perfectly captures the emotional connotations of Banville's language, his nature imagery, and his revelations of life as a series of paintings. Like the greatest of the Irish story-tellers, Lee has an instinctive sense of when to raise and lower his voice and when to pause for emphasis,  adding greatly to the mood and drama.

B000J233SK|5.0|It is very relaxing. I have listened to it over and over again in my classroom.
0802798225|5.0|I don't usually read YA books, but when I read the summary on the back of this book, I knew I just had to buy it. I love it, I haven't read anything as good as this in awhile now. I would definitely recommend this book.
0307266303|5.0|An entertaining book with a fascinating cast of characters.     There are at least two aspects to the book, there's the narrative about events leading up to a cross country ultramarathon in Mexico, and there's McDougall's ideas about barefoot running - and he's kind enough to cite supporting studies, so you don't have to just take his word for it.    The stories in the book grab you as he introduces you to the eclectic cast of characters and their backgrounds. I frequently got so engrossed in the backstory that I was almost surprised when he returned to the main narrative. But all the stories weave together nicely, and lead you up to the final race.    The book takes a very upbeat look at barefoot running (almost too upbeat to be believable), but it is really about the joy of running. This is a book that will make  you WANT to go out and run.     In fact, I think I'm going to go for a run now.

B001AQO3WY|4.0|HBO's seven part miniseries based on Evan Wright's Generation Kill is a brutally honest and realistic depiction of the early days of the invasion of Iraq as told through the eyes of the First Recon Marines. Produced and written by David Simon and Ed Burns who gave us such classic television as The Wire and Homicide the series is not to be missed.    The First Recon Marines are preparing to enter Iraq as the show opens. There is a feeling of excitement that comes on the verge of war. After this initial excitement breakdowns occur. There are problems with supplies arriving, there is dissent in the chain of command and there are questions as to orders given. The show ends with the taking of Baghdad but the show leaves its viewer with more questions than overall answers.     The series is presented in an in your face manner that may be difficult for some viewers to get into. You are literally dropped into a confusing situation and left to fend for yourself and reach your own conclusions. The acting is first rate along with the entire production. The set features commentaries on six out of seven episodes. There is a discussion with the actual First Recon Marines upon whom the story is based. A thirty minutes making of featurette films in some gaps in the production history. Perhaps the most interesting and telling special feature is a video diary kept by cast member Eric Ladin.     This is a mature and brutal examinination of modern American warfare. It may not be for everyone but the series does take its viewers on quite an unforgettable ride.
1594201927|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book, and in my opinion that says a lot because history books aren't usually as enjoyable to read as they are informative.  This book is actually enjoyable to read.  The author has a style of prose that flows well, and so the tone of the book isn't monotone like so many other history books.  Just the quality of writing alone makes the information and points the author is making come across more clear and interesting than most books on financial history I have come across.    The way the chapters are divided up is very neat, because Ferguson essentially walks readers through the evolution of the major financial vehicles and institutions that are so common and essential in today's global economy.  Each chapter takes a different financial vehicle or institution and traces it back to its origins in an attempt to explain not just how banks, bonds, stocks etc. developed from their most infantile stages, but also to elucidate as to why the need for such financial concepts developed in the first place.  In contrast to most history books where the chapters are arranged in a sequence from early to late, in this work each chapter discusses the birth and development of a specific financial concept).  These concepts are portrayed in an easily understandable way, and may well have been simplified to an extent, but that is why I feel that readers who are not professional historians would actually get more out of this book than had Ferguson filled these chapters with too much detail and minutiae.    The message behind this book is that finance and banking developed out of a bona fide need society had to diversify risk, organize and structure the business of money, perfect risk analysis for collateralized transactions, and further general business development, growth, and evolution.  Ferguson clearly underlines the non-financial components of developed societies that give way to the need for and rise of money and the infrastructure that supports a money-based system.    I would recommend this book to readers who want to further their basic knowledge of financial history, but don't have an interest in reading a text-book.  I read after work, when I am exhausted and tired, and I was so happy to read a good history book that didn't just put me to sleep.  This is a 5-star book without a doubt.
B001MW0J2O|3.0|sung tongs is a much better album and would be recommended over this. listen to !!! or out hud instead if you're looking for something fun to listen to that's still a little off the wall. all of the songs run together and nothing stands out. it's worth a listen, but it's really trying to be cute and fun and just loses the appeal for me.
0316017922|5.0|Having never read any of the previous works by Malcolm Gladwell, I have no basis of comparison as to how this book fares versus his other titles, but I happened to have loved reading Outliers.  The book was creative and interesting.  I read it in less than a weekend.    Now, I am not a fan of quick pick-me-up books that are supposed to be motivational and inspiring.  The self-help section at the book store always makes me feel first like I am crazy, and second that I am reading the same old story by a different author.  Luckily, this book is not at all a self-help book.    In Outliers, Gladwell explains that success comes from hard work - a fact that most of us already know and do not need to be told again.  However, he really draws an interesting conclusion that hits the reader like an unexpected epiphany when he demonstrates that raving (outlier) success (as opposed to just plain old success) is more a matter of circumstances and luck than we may think.  This isn't meant to be demotivating.  In fact the moral of the story essentially promotes hard work, with the caveat that you cannot become an outlier without both extraordinary work ethic AND convenient circumstances that allow only hard workers to elevate their success from ordinary to outlier status.    Gladwell is such a great storyteller, and it makes the book a breeze to get through quickly without losing the stickiness of the takeaways the reader is intended to receive.  I was skeptical when I picked up the book, but now I am so glad to have read it.  I am more confident than ever that my hard work will bring me success, but Outliers has really helped me come to terms with the problematic (and unrealistic) expectation that so many business people like myself harbor - the notion that ALL we need is to work hard and we will be filthy rich beyond belief.  Gladwell teaches us plain and simple - hard work does not make you an outlier on the positive end of the success spectrum, but the lack thereof will make that end impossible.    I recommend this book specifically to young entrepreneurs, professionals trying to climb the corporate ladder, well-to-do workers close to retirement who are trying to keep up with the Jones's, and those who are sitting around waiting for the God of success to discover you so that you never have to lift a finger for your riches (AKA - people who place a lot of hope in their weekly lottery ticket), however, we all have something to gain from Outliers regardless of our current situation.    This is clearly a 5-star book.
B00006I53S|4.0|Recently I bought this lens for a [[ASIN:B001XURPQS Canon EOS Rebel T1i 15.1 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera with 3-Inch LCD and EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Lens]] thinking it would be a great choice for all-around shooting due to its versatile focal length.  In addition, since the T1i has some limited video capabilities, I figured it could double as a video lens.  Unfortunately the image stabilizer is too loud to use during video shooting when using the built-in mic, but arguably the T1i is at least partially to blame since it does not provide an external mic input.  Anyone shooting DSLR video with this lens might do well to switch IS off before rolling.    If your application is still shooting, however, you'll probably be well satisfied with the versatility and performance of this lens.  Note that not all Canon IS lenses are created equal, however, and the older IS technology in this lens is good for about 2 stops of shutter speed versus 3 or 4 stops for the latest technology.  Still, the Canon 28-135 IS USM is difficult to beat for value and may be the most versatile Canon lens under $500.
B001FB4W0W|1.0|I anxiously waited for this show to come out on DVD as we do not get HBO.  I should have saved my money as it took 12 hours for this show to just cover one mystery.  I was so bored by the sixth disc and so disappointed in the characters.  I love the books and couldn't believe how the story was ruined by all the sex and swearing.  There's no way that the Tara of this show would be Sookie's best friend as the Sookie in the books does not like swearing.  Nobody would want to be Tara's friend with the attitude she had in the show. The character of Sookie was okay until she proclaims that she loves Bill and then proceeds to kiss Sam.  There was way too much emphasis on sex and everybody was doing everybody else.  I ended up hating the majority of the characters.  To say it's based loosely on the books is an understatement.
B0025VLEM0|5.0|Zombies are one of those horror staples that have gotten putrid, after one too many idiotic blood'n'gore-fests with a revolting script. Like poor Dracula, they run out of things to do.<br /><br />But zombie films are revitalized by the wickedly funny \\"Shaun of the Dead,\\" a tale of music, love, pubs, and the slobbering undead. In the vein of Peter Jackson's \\"Dead Alive,\\" it's full of twisted humour, funny dialogue and plenty of gore.<br /><br />Shaun (Simon Pegg) and Ed (Nick Frost) are the poster boys for adolescentus slackeritis, living in a London flat with their peeved roommate Pete, who has actually grown up and gotten a real job. Ed plays video games all day, and Shaun's immaturity has just gotten him dumped by his long-suffering girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield).<br /><br />Wrapped up in his love life woes, Shaun fails to notice a little news item: Human beings all over London are transforming into zombies. At first, Shaun obliviously drowns his sorrows, and has a nasty encounter when he goes to pick up a soda. Now he must mend his relationship with Liz and defend himself and his family from the hordes of ravenous zombies... by barricading them in a pub.<br /><br />\\"Shaun\\" makes the whole genre seem fresh just because it doesn't take itself seriously. The heroes don't even have guns (since the UK public don't get them), and so our heroes fend off the zombies with vinyl records, shovels and cricket bats. That gives an idea of how serious this movie is.<br /><br />\\"Shaun of the Dead\\" isn't so much a zombie movie as a love story with zombies -- a very funny one, with lots of gore. We're treated to slackers in love, Shaun drifting obliviously around London withoutn noticing the undead, and some very entertaining dialogue (\\"Just look at the face: it's vacant, with a hint of sadness. Like a drunk who's lost a bet...\\")<br /><br />Later on, he's forced to shake off his obliviousness in order to save his loved ones, with a bat as his only weapon. And maybe some commandos in a tank. It's gory, and the ending gets a bit cliched and overserious, but the ride up until then is wonderfully scripted and full of hilarious crude comic moments. Not sex-organ/bathroom humor, but definitely not highbrow.<br /><br />Everybody knows guys like Shaun and Ed. Pegg perfectly plays a slacker with a heart of gold, who would like to be more than he is, but doesn't have the slightest clue how to go about it. Frost is a good annoying sidekick for Shaun, and Ashfield does a good job as the long-suffering girlfriend.<br /><br />As a bonus, music geeks will laugh themselves silly over such important decisions as: which albums should our reluctant heroes throw at the zombies? \\"Stone Roses?\\" \\"No.\\" \\"...Second Coming?\\" \\"I liked it.\\" \\"Dire Straits?\\" \\"Chuck it!\\" Good choice, Shaun m'boy.<br /><br />While it's a hilarious movie, it's not a spoof -- rather it's a zombie movie with wit, love and comedy. By not taking itself too seriously, \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" ends up revitalizing a genre that seemed like it was... well, almost dead.a bit cliched and overserious, but the ride up until then is wonderfully scripted and full of hilarious crude comic moments.

B000J10EQU|1.0|I watched it with anticipation for a possible great film,instead it was a very bad SUPERMAN movie! Kevin Spacey is a great actor but there's only one LEX LUTHOR and that it Gene Hackman,just like Kate Bosworth,she's a terrible actress! Well, Margot Kidder was a terrible actress as well but at least she was a better LOIS LANE! I don't know who Brandon Routh is but he tried too hard to be CLARK KENT/SUPERMAN but as everyone has said it Christopher Reeve was the better actor/character!

B000FVRACK|1.0|I have bought many music DVDs from Amazon, and have generally been very pleased with them.  But this one, Arthur Rubeinstein Piano Concertos, was a great disappointment.  In the first place, although the Region Code was 0, Worldwide, I could not play it on my video player which has had no problems with Amazon-bought DVDs in the past.  It could play only on my computer.  Secondly, when I played it on my computer, the sound was unbelievably choppy, not at all what I expected from a quality product.  In short, the product was defective!  And I could not return it as I first played it, for reasons of my own, 2 months after I ordered it.    So, do you want to have this product?  I would advise you to be very careful about buying it.

B001M5UDGS|4.0|I should preface this by admitting that I am a Whedon fan.  I adored Dr. Horrible when it first came out, re-watched it on [...] later, and have generally tried to get everyone I know to see it.  I own [[ASIN:B0000AQS0F Firefly - The Complete Series]] and watched Dollhouse ([[ASIN:B0024FAR66 Dollhouse: Season One]]) nigh-religiously.    That said, I can't give the DVD a 5-star review.  Despite two audio commentaries (one a campy, entertaining musical; the other an honest, standard commentary including such trivia as pointing out a Sarah Michelle Gellar cameo), and a set of hit-or-miss fan-submitted Evil League of Evil audition videos, this isn't going to appeal to everyone.    I really enjoyed it, and I still do, but this isn't a mainstream video.  Additionally, the webisodes themselves are so short (~45 minutes total) that my gut feeling after watching both commentaries and the E.L.E. videos was \\"that's it?  well, okay.  I guess it was good.\\"    So my advice: if you loved Dr. Horrible on the web and you don't mind spending some money for extra content and to support the effort, get this DVD.  Otherwise, watch the show online, then consider getting it.
B001KVZ6ES|1.0|To this day I still do not understand the praise this movie gets! I get what the movie is trying to do.  I get the whole racism, old man in a new world, coming to terms with yourself...blah blah blah.  Those things are all well and good if they are done in a halfway decent fashion.  First off the acting is on par with any Soap Opera on TV.  I could barley sit the through the thing because of this.  I think I actually felt vomit touch the back of my throat trying to watch this movie.  Second the whole story is just corny as hell.  This is pretty much it \\"Grumpy - Racist old man hates the world...takes sissy Asian kid under his wings...finds peace \\".  The last thing that really made me want to slit my own throat was the scene where Clint is so shocked that he drops his shot glass.  It was so over dramatized....I can't even stand to talk about movie.     Do you self a favor and skip this Over Hyped piece of garbage!

B00156ZWV0|5.0|There are some people who want everything for nothing. To carp at the omissions in documentation (libretti etc) is a reflection of sheer greed. EMI has put together a brilliantly representative collection of the work of Vaughan Williams at the lowest price possible. This means compromises like minimal documentations, simple but adequate packaging, packing together on a CD works that don't complement each other just to take best advantage of the space, remasterings that are not recent and therefore not state of the art, etc. If you want to avoid these compromises, then pay for a full-price release!<br /><br />What you get are recordings ranging from the 60's to the 90's (they are definitely NOT all old) which include performances ranging from 'good' to 'best available'. I am an audiophile with a sound system worth around $20,000 and have the ear of a trained musician. None of the sound is state-of-the-art, but it does range from more than acceptable to very good. As far as I can see, the earlier recordings (and old recordings from the 60's and 70's don't swamp the collection - and there are many who would regret this) have been re-mastered. As I write I am listening to a compilation from late 60's to early 70's, put together and remastered in 1987. The sound is excellent, possibly due to analog originals, although there are some discs where the re-mastering has produced a slight harsh edge.<br /><br />At $2 per CD, I am happy to get such an excellent coverage of VW's output in performances where the average standard is so high. And the opportunity to get such things as 'Serenade to Music', a piece that rates among the most beautiful compositions ever written, in all three of its versions is a treasure. You will find forgotten treasures here that you would find very difficult to obtain anywhere else.<br /><br />As to the choral singing: Britain is the home of choral singing and averages the highest standard in the world. I had no more trouble deciphering the diction than I would with other recordings of complex choral/orchestral sound, making a small allowance in a small number of cases for the age of the recording. I must add that choral/choral-orchestral music represents a fairly large part of VW's output.<br /><br />This set provides an excellent and incredibly inexpensive backbone to your VW collection which will supplement recordings you already have. And it will probably spur you to seek more modern recordings of some discoveries; with others you will be quite satisfied with what you find here. Those who carp at some aspects of the set would seem to want all the features of a new full-priced release for next to nothing. Such ingratitude!<br /><br />It is my impression VW is not as well-appreciated in the US or Australia as he is in the UK. If you have some of his music and are interested in exploring further, or are starting from scratch this is the ideal purchase to help you. You will not get a poor performance (I've found a short, early track that was poorly miked - unusual for EMI) that will mis-represent a work.<br /><br />A listing of contents and performers, with a few omissions, probably for contractual reasons, can easily be found by a quick search on the internet.<br /><br />ADDENDUM DEC 9  After 7 months with this set, I am even more amazed at what value this purchase represented, and what a treasure-trove for exploration of VW's works.

As we were watching it,we could see the shadow of a boom mike in the background. Also the holes in the lenes of \\"Gary Mitchell\\" along with some other things.My 16 year old son who loves all the Star trek series, thought the special effects were lame. I had to remind him that it was filmed in 1966-67, and was a very low budget series.    I'm very pleased with it. I even don't mind the 4:3 format. It was filmed that way,so there is no distortion by streching it.   It enhanced effects do not distract from the story, it makes it better. No more shaky ship circling around a blue, red or green blob.All the colors pop.I even noticed Spock had a slightly green tint to his face in the \\"Where no man has gone before\\" episode. You can watch it in it's orginal format as well. I like the new effect.   It seems as though the episodes are out of order. There is a small problem with the audio.I have to turn up the volume on the dolby 7.1 to be able to hear the dialogue.The stereo 2.0 seems better. I read about this on the reviews.My Onkio system handles it ok,although 40 is a little loud.   Can't wait for seasons 2& 3 to come out. Hope it's the same price! Live long and prosper..
0316001821|5.0|Please don't let the subject matter shy you away from this book! As I was reading it I would try to talk about it to people - and either they had read it and thought it was fantastic or... they said they didn't want to read about a 14 year old girl being raped and murdered.<br />The Lovely Bones is so much more about Suzie Salmon's murder - it is a story about how the dead struggle with just as many uncertainties as the living. Suzie wants to help her family find the killer, Suzie wants her family to see her so they know she is allright -- Just like Suzie's family wants to find the killer and they want her to know that they are allright.<br />Alice Sebold presents parallels to the reader that, if they are like me, hadn't really thought about before. Most of us believe that the human spirit transcends death beyond earth and goes somewhere and lives on - but what do they experience? Might it be more difficult for them then us on earth who still have friends and family that we can turn for support while the dead struggle to give us some kind of sign, some kind or message or image? And might the dead cherish those breakthroughs that we on earth consider coincidences or imagination?<br />But with all of that said what Alice Sebold is really trying to tell us is that everything in our world (living or dead) is about letting go and moving on. Sebold herself is rape survivor and while she wrote a different book than Lovely Bones about it -- I cannot help but see what are probably similarities bewtween how the characters in Lovely Bones learn to live and how she herself may have.<br />It is odd that one event, one minute or one hour can change our lives forever - but what Sebold is trying to tell us is that our lives are constantly changing and our struggles to hold onto our comfort can ultimately be our demise - we need to move forward with change (as difficult and painful as it may sometimes be) and not hold on. Everything is part of our lives - both the good and the bad and each shapes us into who we are.us into who we are.

B0017VG69U|5.0|What can I say, it's Star Trek. Gene Roddenberry's creation of the future as he saw it, should be a lesson for all people. A time when race, creed, color and religious beliefs are all behind us and mankind lives as one. As entertaining as each episode was each also had a lesson of morality in it. And who knew that when this unlikely television series was canceled after only three years and 79 episodes that long after it left the air it would gather such a following that it would become a cult classic that would last well over thirty years and is still going strong. Strong enough that it spawned four other star trek series as well as an animated version of the original show and ten major motion pictures with another just hitting theaters. No, I don't live in my parents basement or sit around in a starfleet uniform with spock ears, but I am a big fan of the Original series and a couple of the spinoffs, and all the movies. I would love to have copies of the original releases, but these remastered dvd's are amazing. The special effects are great and the Enterprise never looked so detailed before. This along with seasons one and three are a must have for any Star Trek enthusiast.

0790729377|3.0|This DVD was not delivered.  The merchant stated that it was \\"out of stock.\\"  Another DVD of my selection, EL CID, was sent to me and was of a superior quality.
B001S2PT3M|5.0|Nothing to add to the positive reviews. But European buyers beware: discs 1 + 2 are code-free but disc 3 is coded region A (region 1) for USA only. So after 8 extremely nail-biting episodes I couldn't watch the last 4...
B0026127Y8|5.0|I LOVE this movie.  It has great action, great acting, and its just flat out good!  To me, real life is far scarier than any monster movie. This stuff really happens and that makes it scary and a good thriller!  If you have teens, you should definately watch it with them because it's a good wake-up call for them.  THIS is why we are protective of our kids.  Liam does an awesome job and this is the kind of dad I'd like to have.  One that would stop at nothing and never give up on trying to protect me/save me, etc.  I actually think I'll buy this one. It's worth keeping around.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I just watched this movie this week and I stayed up most of the night watching it from start to finish.  This was so well done.  I was sitting at the edge of my seat watching it.  I loved the wet t-shirt scene too.  I am buying this right away.  If you love pride and prejudice, you have to watch this one.  I love how she is magically put into the book.  I wish I could do that!  I think anyone who loves Jane Austen's books will just absolutely love this movie!  Bravo!!!!!
B001OFJPIS|3.0|I thought this was more comedy than anything else. It's a good rainy day movie.  my only complaint was that it seemed to run a little long. I got really bored in the last 15 minutes of it.  I can't even remember the first HellBoy so it's no big deal if you haven't seen it.  I thought it was worth renting.
0802136834|4.0|To be a historical book, this is an easy, interesting read. With so much interest in English history, this is a good book to read.
B000TGJ8A8|4.0|A Las Vegas magician may be more than he appears to be. Nicholas Cage plays the part of Chris Johnson a man with a secret. He has the ability to look two minutes into the future. An FBI agent played by Julianne Moore discovers him.  She requires his ability to prevent a catastrophe.<br /><br />Will Chris Johnson look forward to helping or does he realize that once he is discovered he will be incarcerated for life and treated like a freak?<br /><br />Just as FBI agents and other nefarious entities are pursuing him, he also has a vision of the future love played by Jessica Biel. What can he do? He must follow his vision; this complicates things.<br /><br />We have the thrill of following Chris through his trials and tribulations as he balances his social responsibility and his need for love. We must always keep in mind that no good deed goes unpunished.<br /><br />This is a formula film, which you have seen the formula many times such as in &quot;Run Lola Run&quot; (1998). On the other hand, a more action packed &quot;d&eacute;j&agrave; vu&quot; (2006). I seen the Blu-Ray version of this film and it is well designed for Blu-Ray both in visuals and in sound. Be sure to look at the extras like &quot;two minutes in the future with Jessica Biel&quot;. It may not be thought provoking but its darn good entertainment.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00005JPD0 Deja Vu]]
B00004TX5F|4.0|Though this is not on a par with Amadeus, it is an incredibly rich portrait of a period.  I was fascinated by it, and my daughter, a serious singing student, saw (non-racy) portions of it in her French school.  It is a very European film, paying minute attention to historical (if not biographical) detail.  It is also a taut drama between two brother, one a performer of genius (truly a rock star of his age) and the other a hanger-on who uses his brother to advance an otherwise mediocre talent.  Hamdel is also fun, but I never appreciated him all that much.<br /><br />At the core of the drama is a terrible secret, of course.  The brothers are very close, sharing lovers and their music, and their love for each other is lost eventually.  While this is not biographically anything we can know, it is great drama that never becomes soap opera.<br /><br />You see popular culture for aristocrats of the time, which is a real treat.  They are not portrayed as silly dilettantes (such an easy cheap shot), but as great cultural enthusiasts and patrons, which some of them were.<br /><br />Recommended warmly.  It is worth re-viewing many times and we certainly will.
B000Y7U98C|2.0|Here's the problem with Sunshine: it just wasn't that good. It wasn't bad but, when you're used to Boyle creating things like 28 days later, Slumdog and Trainspotting, serving up a warmed-over Solaris-meets-2001 falls below the standards you expect from him.<br /><br />There were plot holes large enough to pilot the Icarus through such as:<br />* Who was the baddie? The Icarus I captain gone nuts that no one noticed entering the Icarus II?<br />* Why were they able to breathe in the payload area? What a waste of oxygen.<br /><br />The tried and tested formula of captain-dies-first was used yet again. The table scene was ripped directly from Alien and so on.<br /><br />I wanted to like this movie but the characters were so underdone, I had a hard time caring about any of them.<br /><br />One to rent only methinks.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|[[ASIN:B001PU8N0I Little Dorrit]]  This screen adaptation done from the Charles Dickens novel is really a super job by all.  The script is well done, the acting superb, the camera, lighting, scenery and each aspect make this a quality use of my time...truly a noble form of entertainment.  We are telling everyone about this project.  I think that whenever a decision is made to be faithful to the classic work and that it is done so that the characters can be fully developed (in this lengthy version as opposed to an hour or two), it is much more endearing to a viewer.  Good job, BBC!
B0013LKZWS|5.0|When the album first came out, honestly, I avoided it because of the hype and absolutely rampant radio overplaying of Love Song. I never really liked that song at all.     About a year later, I bought the album after a friend had, claiming the other songs were still good. They were in fact, correct. Almost every other song on the disc is original, genuinely good music. \\"Morningside\\" shows off her vocal talent quite well, and \\"Fairytale\\" is a very unique song. Listen to the words.    Overall a great CD.
B0011UGLK6|1.0|Nice book, no audio.  Amazon won't let your Kindle read this book to you.  There is nothing on the amazon page that will tell you this.  I like to read the book then have the kindle read it to me on my hour commute.    No go on this book.      I'm not a happy camper.
140130916X|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, although I was glad I reading at home since I did find myself in tears several times throughout the book. I enjoyed watching Holly's character grow and liked the supporting characters as well, especially her siblings.    I have not seen the movie so I did not have anything to compare the book to, but I found the book to be a page-turner and stayed up much too late to finish it and see how things would turn out. I was not disappointed. I liked this book from beginning to end and definitely recommend it (as long as you have a box of kleenex nearby!)
B000W4KSWO|5.0|I'll be brief.  These are two of the giants of jazz, and the music they make together is sublime.  If you like, and/or admire, either, or both, of these musicians, but this CD.  I can't say enough about it.  Buy it.
0634022296|5.0|I knew thats the way it went ! Just Kidding. This book brings to life the early Beatles songs I grew up with. (Oh, so thats the chord they used there!)  So many hours of pleasure. Very detailed and gives all the chord fingering patterns and capo placements. Low price to boot.                 All Together Now..  THANKS..
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Excellent work that describes America's beginnings and brings her founding fathers to life.  The personalities of the the first three presidents and the signers of the declaration of independence are in full display.
0061438294|5.0|If you need to know what other people are really feeling, then this is the book for you.  Mr. Navarro is a former FBI Agent who has used his body language techniques for interrogations and interviews and who now gives you the basics of his skill.  I highly recommend this book to others.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|This three-part show is a must see for everyone.  Great acting.  Funny and witty comedy.  Another great creation of Joss Whedon.  If you love superhero films, comedic shows, and musicals, you will definitely love this!
0062515675|5.0|This is a great book.  Not a lot of new info but all the good stuff that we all forget, written in a quick wonderful little story.  Especially love the summaries of important points at the end of each chapter.  I read the book on a plane, closed it and wrote down a plan to start making some life changes and have followed through on at least 1/2 of them already.  LOVED this book!  Ordered 4 more for friends.  Can't recommend it enough.  Why haven't I heard of it sooner?
B000VUFJ3C|5.0|I bought a lot of CDs from amazon.com. I was so surprized that many company said \\"New condition\\" I ened up returned. Becausethey were far from new!I am so glad to purchase from this company.
B00006GFAB|5.0|Face it folks, classic rock is classic crap. Bands like The Who, Pink Floyd, Led Zepplin, The Beetles and The Rolling Stones were all a bunch of groupie-loving drug addicted cringe inducing untalented mongs. \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" is probably the most boring album ever created. Thankfully, KISS made up for all of this with their awesome music! They created heavy metal which was copied by poor imitators like Black Sabbith. Songs like \\"Love Gun\\" contained both awesome musicianship and poetry. The only other good classic rock artists are The Darkness, The White Stripes, Elton John's \\"Victim of Love\\" album and Bush. If you're new to classic rock, you got to listen to this album. It pwns all that Rush and King Crimson n00b stuff.
B00005U2JL|4.0|One day after listening to the very disappointing CD, The High End of Low, I received this in the mail. It was an awesome experience! I felt like I was at a Marilyn Manson concert. I loved to see what it looked like while he was singing. My favorites songs were The Reflecting God, The Fight Song, Disposable Teens, and Sweet Dreams. Some of the things he did were funny like humping members of his band, and much more. I highly recommend MARILYN MANSON: GUNS, GOD, AND GOVERNMENT WORLD TOUR!!!
B000WC4A8O|5.0|Well I have very little vinyl and it is a new medium to me.  I have pretty much bought some used copies of albums I like at some local shops.  This is the only \\"new\\" LP I have ever bought.  That being said \\"WOW\\" is all I can say.      These records are high quality and are nice and heavy in your hands.  The sound quality is incredible and gives more depth to the songs than I have ever heard.  The songs are not new, but provide a new experience for me and I am very happy with my purchase.
B001FBIPF0|5.0|I bought the album maybe a month after it came out. I am a HUGE Fall Out Boy fan, so I had high expectations for this CD. Well...I LOVED it. It's different than their previous albums. It's not their typical \\"sound\\".  But I loved it none the less. From my favorite I Don't Care to a more mellow The (Shipped) Gold Standard. This album rocks! If you are a true Fall out Boy fan, you will love this album. BUY IT NOW!
1416562605|4.0|I never imagined how good this book was from the first few pages. This is a really powerful story. I had trouble putting it down.  If you enjoyed books like Life of Pi and Animal's People, you'll really enjoy like
0446402397|3.0|I was waiting for it to become the awesome phenomenal thrill ride I kept hearing about. Ultimately, it ended well but I'm not sure the build up really paid off.
B0009ELZAG|5.0|I'm 24 years old. When I first heard this album about a month ago, I was unimpressed and felt cheated out my money. However, two songs kept me coming back - Wouldn't It Be Nice and God Only Knows. After giving it a second chance, I knew something special was there. Listening to it a few more times made me absolutely love the album.    There is something about the simple, yet expressive lyrics, and the child-like, yet grand instrumentals behind the vocals. It's almost magical in a way how the vocals and instrumentals blend so beautifully.    You can call it a coming-of-age album.    The CD package itself is great. I'm no audiophile, but it sounded exactly as I expected it to. It also comes with a 24-page (includes front and back) booklet with photos and a lot of interesting information about the album. The only thing that bothers me is that they included the bonus tracks on the same CD as the album. I'm not a big fan of the bonus tracks either.
087349976X|2.0|This was one of the only times I did not seek out the book in a bookstore BEFORE purchasing.  It is a lesson I learned the hard way and won't repeat.<br /><br />Ease of use?  Maybe, if you can get past the jargon.  Abbreviations are fine, but only if your reader is familiar with the terminology or the author explains them properly...not so in this case.  I found them tedious, cumbersome and confusing and tended to look back numerous times during my perusal as most were not the ones easily remembered.  I felt as if I could have used a refresher- or at the very least, a cheat sheet.  Once I glanced through the whole book, the only project I was honestly interested in completing was the one on the front cover and maybe two others.  I understand putting the best or most visually appealing project on the cover, but that seemed to be the only one of interest.  The remaining lot was odd frippery and were either very rudimentary, not well illustrated, explained or a combination thereof.  Again, the author relied heavily on the reader having a better grasp of the techniques than she was willing to share, so in my honest opinion, that lets the beginning jewelry maker right out of the equation.  Writing a book of this nature only serves the reader as a teaching tool if you GIVE them the information without bogging them down.  Flipping back and forth through the daunting abbreviations, giving no more than one \\"illustration\\" per project and shortening the instructions was a real disservice on the whole.<br /><br />A single picture may be worth 1000 words, but by simply adding a few more pictures to flesh out each design, technique and instructions, I feel, would have solidly given this book genuine sentiment for wanting to support the beginner jewelry enthusiast without surrendering the appeal to the intermediate designer.  Lastly, the illustrations were done in paper and ink and were surprisingly of poor quality.  Modern technology is readily available at any kiosk, caf&eacute; or library so not using that particular tool hurt the overall quality and it did not have to be the case. There is a correlation between visual learning and projects of this nature, killing two birds with one stone.  Also, if time had been a constraint, photographs would have been the best way to accomplish these goals and another reason more should have been used.<br /><br />I think it would have served this author better to be stingy with the number of projects and more generous with photographs.  Instead, her unintentional sacrifice sadly produced lackluster results.  It could have been a great book...sing that particular tool hurt the overall quality and it did not have to be the case.

B001DRF84W|5.0|By far this surpasses most other entries into the genre. To be quite quick to the point, this film was approached with an A-list sensibility that probed the mind of it's central figure and exposed the \\"Hulk\\" as an aspect of Bruce Banner's psyche, invariably tied to an emotional trauma suffered at an early age.  Through every facet of its production this story and character was agreeably taken in a thoughtful direction that gave opportunity to create a far more dynamic character, with quiet and loud events, granting substance and even some degree of metaphor to the narrative.   From the films assembly of accomplished actors to the vision of Ang Lee's perturbed hero in question, \\"Hulk\\" goes beyond the expectations of most moviegoers and presents itself as a dramatic character study into one of Marvel Comics most beloved and celebrated icons.
0385340575|4.0|Lee Child's \\"Gone Tomorrow\\" is the 13th Jack Reacher installment.  It is a much needed return to the stylings to which we loyal fans became addicted; certainly, it is far superior to the politically slanted \\"Nothing To Lose.\\"  My sole quibble with \\"Gone Tomorrow\\" is that Child again, although with much more subtlety, infuses his British perspective of American policy into Reacher's actions and consciousness.  As a loyal reader of a great character, I am not interested in Lee Child's view of American foreign policy, past or present.      That being said, this novel begins with a random incident on a late night subway in New York where Reacher suspects a passenger of being a suicide bomber and due to his intervention, a death occurs which motivates him to trace the victim's backstory in hopes of understanding who and what caused the unnecessary tragedy.  A continuous series of government and private agents begin confronting Reacher assuming he has valuable knowledge(and property)gained from the victim.  Before one settles in, Reacher is fending off the NYPD, FBI, Homeland Security, paid investigators, and a slew of foreign bad guys that will please anyone's appetite for evil villains.     Reacher is as perceptive, logical,and analytical as ever in \\"Gone Tomorrow.\\"  He actually instructs the reader about a number of arcane minutiae such as how to knife fight, defend against brass knuckles, and disappear in NYC.  Reacher is less taciturn and more focused than he has been recently and even pals up with NYPD detective and a grieving father for a time.      There is more than ample violence and gore to please the loyal Reacher fan, the plotting is tight, and Reacher continues to be fun to decipher as he analyzes people and events.  As usual, Jack Reacher is NOT a character you want mad at you or to seek vengeance against you. And Child does a fasacinating job of describing Manhatten and the underbelly environs of NYC.     For me, the mark of a fine writer is his/her ability to entice me into reading chapter after chapter in a comfortable flowing exposition and not realizing the passage of time or the need to suspend disbelief.  Child can do that when he is at his best--entice the reader to become one whith his signature character.  I just hope he works more diligently to leave his political slant out of future Reacher novels.
0307266303|5.0|Once you  can get around all the superlatives (the best, the greatest, the fastest, the smartest, etc.) and enjoy McCullough tale of running for joy it becomes an intriguing story; part science, myth, history, business, athleticism.
B000005B0U|5.0|You probably didn't watch or don't remember the pathetic sequel film. But, this 18-track soundtrack album is superb. It begins with \\"Born In Chicago,\\" performed by the Paul Butterfield Blues Band and gets better with each subsequent track. \\"Cheaper To Keep Her,\\" features Lonnie Brooks, Junior Wells and the nine-member Blues Brothers Band (BBB). \\"RESPECT\\" features Aretha Franklin with the BBB. \\"634-5789\\" has Eddie Floyd with Wilson Pickett and Jonny Lang supported by the BBB.  \\"John The Revelation\\" is excellent with Taj Mahal, Sam Moore and Joe Morton.     \\"Season Of the Witch\\" gets a great reinterpretation by Doctor John with the BBB. \\"Funky Nassau\\" is great with Joe Morton, John Goodman and Erykah Badu. The album ends with \\"New Orleans,\\" performed by the Louisiana Gator Boys and the BBB.    Obviously, these are not classic blues renditions, nor soulful mournings but in no way do they diminish or insult the original versions. These are upbeat, foot-stomping, shake-your-butt performances by great musicians and singers.     If you want to add some spice to your musical life, then I wholeheartedly recommend buying this album.
0307455874|5.0|Bo is still a puppy, so it took me a long time to read my Dad's book, because he is very smart a uses bigger words then Bio is familiar with. But, it was worth all my time and efforts. My Dad's book, \\"The Audacity of Hope\\" is the true story of one brilliant kind man who loved his country above all things except for my Mom, sisters and me. It tells the story of a heart and mind large enough to not only encompass the dreams of our fore fathers and bring them once again to shinning life for the American people, who he loves so well.     In closing, this book is soo good that Bo had to roll over...Four paws way up!!!
0156027321|5.0|\\"Life of Pi\\" is a classic text that yielded even richer rewards for me on my second reading of it. It is easily in my top five favorite books of all time. The reason is very simple. Yann Martel has written a work that is quite engrossing and interesting on two levels: the literal, and the much more satisfying metaphorical.<br />I first read \\"Life of Pi\\" three years ago. I reread it recently because it was a book club choice. Although this novel carved out a niche in my brain on that first reading, I found even more to appreciate and digest during my second.<br />This allegorical novel explores many themes so fundamental to human existence. Faith, religion, storytelling, survival, love, companionship, etc. Not only does \\"Life of Pi\\" explore these themes, it sheds new light on these very overdone topics. That is not easily done. For Mr. Martel to take such universal themes that have been written and discussed a million times over, and make them fresh and new is a testament to his own prowess as a thinker and a writer.<br />Mr. Martel's writing is also rarely didactic, and his use of figurative language is at times breathtakingly beautiful. As one who enjoys good writing, and am impressed by those who have such tight control of style and language I was not disappointed in that aspect of this text. Too many good storytellers are not good writers. Mr. Martel thankfully does not fall into that category<br />To not read this book with an open and inquiring mind is to miss \\"the better story\\", regardless of what you make that out to be. As I read the text I found and saw a very heavily Christian influence in the book's events and themes. It is just as conceivable that someone else could read it, and see none of those things. What is so wonderful is that both points of view can be defended from the text.<br />One critic talked about how this novel makes one believe in the \\"soul sustaining power of fiction.\\" \\"Life of Pi\\" lives up to that praise.<br />Read this text and enjoy one of the few modern novels that gives the reader a real chance to \\"explore\\".els that gives the reader a real chance to \\"explore\\".
0486211045|5.0|Highly essential to any serious and commercial artist.   I am a working comic artist who uses this all of the time as a learning and reference tool.  If you aren't serious about improving your anatomy drawing skills then go buy something else.
B00002R0MC|5.0|Bob's work isn't just music, its medicine for the soul.  And as far as doses go, this is simply the best you will ever get.  Chuck this one in my coffin when I'm gone, please.    What makes this release so amazing, besides the variety of songs and the fact that they're pretty much all delicious remixes or live takes, is the inclusion of much lesser well known songs.  In particular, disc three (the gold nugget of the set, imo) has three in a row - Running Away, Keep on Movin', and Easy Skanking.  Or disc 2's Iron Lion Zion and the medley.  Or disc 1's Back Out, Do it Twice, and Sun is Shining.  The thing is, almost every album Marley created was at least three quarters deep with superb music.  This release highlights that very well.  And you get that without having to buy every album.  But regardless, this release is very complimentary to any Marley material you may already own.    Did the guy write a single bad song?
B001TH16DS|4.0|This a really cool box set. You get all the classic episodes remastered and in blu-ray quality.  What really put's it over the top is having all the episodes in their original format or with new, updated graphic effects. The new effects are excellent and never go to far to take away from the classic feel of the episode.
B000HIVOI2|2.0|The Stargate Blu-Ray does not look good at all.  I would only buy this on Blu-Ray if you do not own it on any other version, as it is only $10.
B001WCN232|2.0|I guess the big question I have is \\"why\\"? (Other than revenue). I used my new Cambridge Audio Azur 640C CD player, and my Grado Reference Series R2 headphones to compare this remaster with the 94 Virgin remaster.<br /><br />This remaster is brighter and louder. The brightness is a tad annoying though because it's turned up so much that the highs are too \\"thin\\" -- the high-hats on Charlie's drums are tinny and have no pop at all. Upping the volume doesn't make the sound richer (my Grados don't lie folks). Mick's voice has a more resonant \\"separation\\" than the Virgin remaster -- it sounds less \\"muddled\\".<br /><br />The packaging is a disappointment too. The Virgin \\"Collector's Edition\\" gives you the ACTUAL original album packaging (cardboard Goats Head Soup photo, and gatefold with \\"album\\" sleeve -- I have yet to see a better CD package for the Stones). This remaster groups all that together in a booklet, which makes you wonder again... why?<br /><br />I bought all these remasters just to test out the sound, but I'm hoping Mick and the boys will take more control over their legacy before they let the record companies turn their catalog into the chaos that RCA has done to Elvis'.<br /><br />And folks... whatever they've done to Star Star means the whole thing is corrupted. You cannot buy this as your only copy of GHS, because they've done some kind of censoring to Star Star. Why has this occurred? That alone means you need to skip this. I wonder... did the Stones OK this?
1423101472|5.0|Percy Jackson is a lot like most kids -- he has a hard time at school, he misses his friends and he's torn between two different girls -- oh, and he's also the son of Poseidon, Greek god of the sea.  Being a demigod, Percy has had a series of breathtaking adventures in the series' previous four instalments, and now it's time for the Big Battle.<br /><br />While mortals think there's a violent storm system creeping across the Midwest, *we* know that it's really the gods battling Typhon, one of the Titans who has risen up to reclaim his place at the top of the god food chain.  But if all the gods are battling Typhon, who's watching out for Olympus (based in the Empire State Building)?!  It's Percy and his fellow demigods, youngsters who have experience and passion -- but will that be enough?<br /><br />Written as a first person narrative, this exciting book teaches a lot about the classical gods without tasting like medicine.  The action and humor are ever present, and the characters are a treat.  While there is betrayal and adversity and violence, there is no gore or cruelty.  I loved the whole series and was really happy with this finish, which offered a plausible solution to the series' loose threads and led to a satisfying conclusion for our heroes.<br /><br />Well done and highly recommended.
B001ED7C58|5.0|I love this CD a lot! I play it at home and  in my car all the time! I just cant get enough of it esp the Blue Foundation's EYES ON FIRE, Rob Pattinson's NEVER THINK, almost all the music collection on this CD are the best! I cant wait to have the New Moon soundtrack too.. I promised myself that I will collect all the soundtracks of Twilight Saga...
B000YDOOU0|5.0|I'm not going to review this one track-by-track, because it is simply pristine jazz trio music, and that's all you really need to know.    The stand-out track for me was the 9-minute \\"When We Were Free,\\" which succeeds largely on the Tony Williams-style drumming of Antonio Sanchez. If there is a lesson to be learned from Miles' \\"Second Great Quintet\\" or the Impulse years of John Coltrane, it is that the drummer is NOT simply there to \\"keep time.\\" As much as I enjoy the entire CD, I'd like to see more of the toughness of \\"When We Were Free\\" spread over the course of an entire album. It's a throwback to Pat's glory days of \\"Travels\\" and particularly stand-out tracks like \\"Are You Going With Me?,\\" with less of the \\"New Age\\" overtones that were popular at the time and more of the aforementioned Miles / Trane attitude improvisation.    It's wonderful to know that in the current day, Pat Metheny is stil fired up and filled with creativity. This album...as well as its companion piece, the live EP \\"Tokyo Day Trip\\"...should be in the library of every enthusiast of this genre.
0061139378|5.0|Coraline is bored. It is the holidays and she and her parents (who both do \\"something\\" with computers according to Coraline) have moved into a large old house. Upstairs is Mr Bobo, who is training mice for a mouse circus, but they are not ready yet, they cannot go oompah oompah. Downstairs are the retired actresses Miss Spink and Miss Forcible who have highland terriers all called Scottish names like Hamish. And then there is the locked door in their parlous. The parlour is the good room, full of her grandmother's old furniture - and  locked door. Her mother shows her behind the door - but there is just a brick wall. Then her mother doesn't bother to lock it - opening the way for the parallel universe to get in.    In the universe are her mother and father, but taller, white, and with black button eyes - and her mother seems a bit taller, wtih longer redder mails, and longer teeth. But they are so nice. They don't make 'recipes' but they give her everything she likes to eat - and teh toys are alive too.    It seems nice, too nice, and the talking cat in the garden lets her know this too. Coraline has 'protection' and she goes home again - however her parents are now missing, and she knows it is her other mother and father who have got them trapped somewhere. She knows, to be truly brace she must got back into the other universe to find them.    This is not a story I would read to younger or nervous children. It is a very creepy story - there is sinister menace in the strange unfolding of events. Coraline is amazing, a strong character, and determined - but quiet and undramatic.     This was a real page turner for me - I thought it might be suitable for the kids, but I think I will have to wait a while. I really loved it thought. it was a clever slightly twisted story which really appealed.

And then proceeds to tell an extremely accurate account of the life of George Mallory - using everyone's real names.  But it is fiction.    I dunno.  That irritates me.    I noticed one editorial that called this a lifeless read.  Sums up my opinion.  I finished it, but I was never engaged.

0385736002|5.0|They say that out of the mouths of babes...etc. In this case, I borrowed a book from a grandson.  He was right. This is a terrific story and a great family adventure.  I see that some of these reviews, in fact, most were not necessarily written by young adults. It's always clear. And though I kept in mind as I was reading that this was not specifically addressed to my generation, still I fell under the considerable spell of a really good story which transcended age.  When I see a review getting very very literal and probing,even\\"erudite\\" I must say, I have my doubts as to the reviewers intentions.  I was up for a good read, plain and simple and I got it.  The ability for young readers to Google every single character except the twins is unparalleled in fiction. My grandson showed me how and what could be more engaging. It lends a life beyond the story. Great!
0307236722|4.0|I have baked EVERY recipe cover-to-cover in Martha Stewart's Baking Handbook - sequentially, with documented photographs, with emailed commentary to Martha - and with periodic bake-through telephone & live appearances on \\"MARTHA\\" chronically my experiences with each of her recipes in this Baking Handbook.      The following is my \\"Culinary Commentary\\" on this book:    The Positives [Many]  * Just as any aspiring cook should start by cooking their way through Julia Child's \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" Volumes 1 and 2, in my opinion any aspiring baker should start by baking their way through Martha's \\"Baking Handbook\\"   o For the aspiring baker Martha's Baking Handbook provides grounding, understanding, confidence and inspiration to find & fuel one's baking passion - & then enabling that aspiring baker to spring forward to more advanced creations.    o Baking through the book cover-to-cover forces one to learn all the basics of baking because the cover-to-cover baking commitment forces you to bake what you might otherwise never choose to try [& hence learn from].  o Baking every recipe requires that one gradually acquire all the \\"essential\\" baking equipment - from a heavy duty mixer to baking pans to pastry piping tools.  * What you see is what you [sequentially learn to] bake!  o Each recipe is accompanied by a color photograph of the finished product - & indeed, if you follow the recipe you will create a \\"picture perfect\\" rendition of the recipe.  o Each chapter builds on development of culinary skills [e.g., chapter 3 \\"Cakes\\" provides an introduction over view to baking cakes, followed by a review of relevant \\"equipment\\" and \\"techniques\\" followed by recipes progressing from basic [\\"Yellow Butter Cake\\"] to advanced [\\"Mocha Pistachio Wedding Cake\\"].    The Negatives [Few yet Significant]  * There are a relatively small number of errors [e.g., \\"Prune Filling\\" page 336 states \\"makes enough for 1 dozen (Danish) pinwheels\\" where as actual yield makes enough forat least 4 dozen pinwheels] & short comings in preparation details [e.g. \\"Panettones\\" page 308 fails to specify the size of  Panettones molds to be used].  * The book's binding is terrible.  Clearly the binding is done with cheap glue.  The consequence is that if this \\"Baking Handbook\\" is used as it should be [i.e., perpetually as a trusted and frequently used resource] the pages begin to fall out.  I had to take my copy to a professional book-binder [at considerable expense] to have my copy rebound.  * The page paper quality is not \\"annotation-friendly\\".  In my opinion, any baker must annotate any recipe with notes specific to what they learned while baking a recipe.  I found that any notes that I penned onto the pages of this Baking Handbook tended to smear illegibly unless I was extremely careful to (1) let the ink dry prior to closing the book & (2) never allowing moisture to contact my previously penned notes.    My Favorite Recipes:  * From the chapter on Simple Baked Goods: \\"Cherry Streusel Coffee Cake\\" [pg 54-55] - easy, fool proof and fabulous  * From the chapter on Cookies: \\"Graham Crackers\\" [pgs 90-92] - bake these and never again will you settle for store-bought.  * From the chapter on Cakes: \\"Old-Fashioned Berry Layer Cake [pgs 154-155] - even a novice can successfully make these amazingly delectable and stunning cake.  * From the chapter on Pies, Tarts, Cobblers & Crisps: \\"Slab Pie\\" [pgs 238-239] - simply stated, one of the best pies I have ever made.  * From the chapter on Yeasted Baked Goods: \\"Chocolate Babkas\\" [pgs 352-353] - an unforgettable & blissful combination of chocolate and yeasted coffee cake most definitely worthy of the effort taken to prepare.  * From the chapter on Pastries: \\"Gougères\\" [pgs 366-367] - based on the recipe for pâte a choux [pg 358], this is an easy and impressive savory pastry that anyone can make.    My least Favorite Recipes:  * From the chapter on Simple Baked Goods: \\"Pumpkin Bread\\" [pg 49] - amount of batter was toomuch for the specified loaf pan size.  * From the chapter on Cookies: \\"Cheesecake Thumbprints\\" [pg 112] - cookie was bland and filling ran out of indentation and filling was not pristine white.  * From the chapter on Cakes: both of the \\"Upside-Down\\" cakes [i.e., \\"Apricot-Cherry\\" [page 180] and Pineapple-Mango [page 183] - both reminded me of a Betty Crocker cake mix based recipe from the 1950s.  * From the chapter on Pies, Tarts, Cobblers & Crisps: \\"Rum-Raisin Pie\\" [pgs 246-247] - the rum is over powering and the crust adhered to the plate.  * From the chapter on Yeasted Baked Goods: \\"Cranberry-Pecan Rye Bread\\" [pgs 298-299] - barely rose and tasted like and had the texture of an unsweetened fruitcake.  * From the chapter on Pastries: \\"Sfogliatelle\\" [pgs 380-382] - this is actually a pasta dough pretending to be a pastry ... I was not impressed.    My \\"Culinary Conclusions\\":  * To the prospective buyer of \\"Martha Stewart's Baking Handbook\\": YES. Absolutely purchase the book and use it and learn from it!  * To Martha:  Good Grief Martha, for the next edition of your \\"Martha Stewart's Baking Handbook\\" please \\"practice what you preach\\" i.e., quality! - and as such price in quality binding so that pages will not fall out of this fabulous resource by those that respect, repeatedly use, and treasure your \\"Baking Handbook\\".

0316017922|1.0|I purchased this book thinking that it would be as well-researched and written as his previous two works, \\"The Tipping Point\\" and \\"Blink.\\" Less than a third of a way through the book, however, I began to become concerned that Gladwell's enthusiasm for his topic had blurred his view of important related factors.<br /><br />As a statistician, I was troubled by his apparent lack of understanding of the concept of \\"range restriction\\" in correlational research. He notes that IQ and success appear to be fairly well correlated up to an IQ of 120 or so, and that beyond this level there is very little relationship between IQ and success. Only 10% of the population has an IQ above 120, meaning that very few fall into this classification. Past an IQ of 132, less than 2% of the population is found.<br /><br />It is clear that one cannot correlate a constant with a variable, since the constant does not change no matter what the value of the variable. Narrowing down the IQ scale to only persons above 120 makes the IQ scale close to a constant.<br /><br />To provide an analogy, consider the correlation between height and basketball ability. Up to a height of about six feet two inches, there is a very high correlation between height and basketball ability. Above that height, however, other factors become more important than height. Agility, good ball-handling skills, eye-hand coordination, etc., all trump height as important facets of a good basketball player among the tallest 10% of the population. A clumsy seven-footer will never be able to compete with a skilled six-foot-two player.<br /><br />All of this does not prove that height is unimportant in basketball (even among the top 10% of the population in height), but just that by restricting the range of basketball players to those over six-foot-two essentially guarantees that the correlation of height with basketball skill will be low.<br /><br />Another sloppy statement in the book indicates that the 1918 flu pandemic  was followed by \\"the First World War, then the Depression, then the Second World War,\\" where clearly the First World War preceded the flu pandemic.<br /><br />Although there is much about the book that is interesting, these two missteps alone reveal a lack of attention to detail that leads one to wonder how valid the rest of the book is. I sincerely hope that Gladwell's next book will be more along the lines of \\"The Tipping Point\\" and \\"Blink.\\"Depression, then the Second World War,\\" where clearly the First World War preceded the flu pandemic.

B001AVEJ1Y|2.0|For all those who are under 18 and this is their first exposure to the Star Trek saga, I urge you to see the greatest Star Trek movie of them all: Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. \\"Khan\\" is the standard on which all Star Trek movies and episodes must be measured against. The writers of the new 'Star Trek' movie claim that their inspiration was the 'Wrath of Khan' and would like to think that their new 'update' is equal to the earlier masterpiece. Unfortunately I must report that the new 'Star Trek' is nowhere close to Star Trek II. Quite the contrary, it is a pathetic mess of a screenplay and until you see 'The Wrath of Khan', you cannot understand what I'm talking about.<br /><br />The new 'Star Trek' attempts to re-imagine the characters from the original TV series when they were young, just beginning their careers. The casting director did well to choose actors who bore a resemblance to the original cast. The writers claim in interviews that they aimed to fill in the back story of the characters by detailing their past histories before, during and right after their initiation at Starfleet Academy as Federation officers. But in actuality, they do the opposite. Take Dr. McCoy, the idiosyncratic chief medical officer--the actor who plays him looks a lot like a young DeForrest Kelley (the original 'Bones') but the comparison ends there. Bones is hardly integrated into the story at all. He doesn't have the humor of the original character nor is there enough of the idiosyncratic charm. In the new 'Star Trek', the character is reduced to a buffoon, chasing Kirk around the ship, trying to inject him with a hypodermic. This is the only time we get to know anything about him.<br /><br />Now take Uhura. In the original, she was the cool, consummate professional, always guiding the Enterprise through tough waters by way of her technical expertise. Here she is the opposite: unprofessional and overemotional. I was embarrassed when she tries to kiss Spock numerous times in the turbolift after the planet Vulcan was destroyed. Here Spock is trying to cope with the annihilation of six million of his people and all Uhura wants to do is make out! You call that class??? And what about Chekov? All they have the character do is mimic the Russian accent of the original character. How did they make him different or improve on the original? Even worse is Sulu. All he gets to do is parachute down to what looks like the platform of an oil rig where he aids Kirk in a ridiculous fight against some bad guys. I thought Scotty had the most potential of the supporting players. At least he projected the good nature of the original character but it was kind of disappointing when he must rely on Leonard Nimoy (the old Spock) to give him the new warp speed formula.<br /><br />The new James T. Kirk looks like a young William Shatner but he too lacks the charm of the original. More could have done with Kirk's early days on Earth especially in showing how the future might look. I liked the cop on the flying motorcycle but a peek at a future 'watering hole' seemed quite derivative (check out the first Star Wars where Harrison Ford struts through the intergalactic bar). Depicting Kirk as a rebellious hothead seems part of the original Star Trek lore, but the humor is missing.<br /><br />The new Spock doesn't at all measure up to the old Spock. The early scene where a very young Spock confronts a group of Vulcan 'bullies' was cute but after that it was all downhill. The problem is that the Kirk-Spock relationship is too heavy-handed. It's one thing to show conflict between the two but when they come to blows, it just seemed so un-Spocklike. Contrast that with Spock's decision to disobey Kirk's command at the end of the \\"Wrath of Khan\\". Kirk and Spock are noble characters and somehow the conflict between them seems juvenile and trivial. Or maybe it was a matter of the plot where the stakes weren't high enough. The writers simply did not give the characters an opportunity to display the complexity of the relationship.<br /><br />Perhaps the worst part of the new Star Trek is the depiction of the villain, the disaffected Nero. I seem to recall that by Star Trek: Next Generation, the Romulans had become a group of worthy adversaries to the denizens of the Federation. But here, the last Romulan, Nero, is a bald guy with tattoos plastered all over his head. All he can do is snarl throughout the movie. Contrast that with Ricardo Montalban's performance as Khan. Again, no comparison! Plotwise, the new Star Trek wasn't clever at all. Beginning with the unnecessary flashback to the tale of Kirk's father's heroism, we're treated to one tired battle scene after another. What's worse is that the film's writers have created a new alternative Star Trek universe. Can you imagine the entire planet of Vulcan being destroyed in any of the earlier movies or episodes? It would never happen. Hey Vulcan is supposed to be populated with some of the smartest guys in the universe and they let themselves be annihilated by a Romulan who looks like a skinhead using a drilling machine that creates black holes!<br /><br />It was nice seeing Leonard Nimoy reprising the role of the original Spock but I was sad to see just how much the actor has aged. Contrary to all the hype, the new Star Trek lacks the charm, humor and complexity of the some of the earlier incarnations. Go back and check out Wrath of Khan and some of the best of the Star Trek episodes from television. If they decide to make a second 'new' Star Trek, hopefully the studio will hire a group of better writers.the relationship.

0307346617|4.0|My complaint is that Max's characters all seem similar after while.  Each character in the book<br />-Says \\"bastard\\" at least twice when speaking about others<br />-Soils themselves in times of stress<br />-Drops the F-bomb for no particular reason<br /><br />Though, the book is a great read.<br /><br />I'll bet the author spent a good potion of his childhood framing his experiences in terms of a zombie invasion. He is so through and detailed in his zombie lore, that the world he paints is truly believable.
B00005OM4K|4.0|The six CD set is well presented, though the earlier numbers specially from the Golliwogs etc., one Disc one do not compare well with the later numbers on the iscs.  Guess CCR were too raw when these numbers were recorded. Otherwise a classic CCR set to be enjoyed.
B000SEGCRS|5.0|Seriously.  I bought this book when I bought my first dSLR camera because I was a little intimidated by it.  After reading chapter 1, I got a pretty good idea of the basics of my new camera and felt comfortable enough to get some really nice shots.  The amazing thing is, I decided to pull out my old point and shoot camera which the dSLR was to replace and see if I could take better pictures with it using the techniques in this book.  The result was pictures 100 times better than those I took before.  For a minute I questioned whether it was really time for me to upgrade, and whether I spent all that money for a dSLR too soon.  But whatever, I'm over it.    This book offers extremely practical advice for getting pictures in the settings most consumers find themselves taking pictures.  Vacation, weddings, kids, etc.  It simplified for me which settings I really need to pay attention to and which were nice-to-haves.  I actually read this book while on vacation and found myself taking better pictures day-by-day, chapter-by-chapter.    The author also offers practical advice on equipment, with an eye toward cost.  This information is sometimes hard to find online because article and forum topics focus so much on the latest and greatest stuff which, not coincidentally, is the most expensive.  I knew I would be spending money on more stuff, but now I feel like at least I have some guidance.    I love this book and I'm pretty sure I will be reading it a couple more times because there is so much great info in there.  That said, if you've done a ton of research and reading already or if you're a professional (obviously), this book is not for you.  If, on the other hand, you've only used a credit card sized point and shoot until now and you've just bought your first dSLR camera because you're getting ready to have your first child (like me), this book will definitely help you get the most out of your camera.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|I could not put this book down - it's mellow and touching - and not at all what you expect.  Parts of it made me laugh aloud, and parts of it made me want to cry.  I'm a voracious reader, but few books make my \\"recommend\\" list.  I pass the best ones along to my brother (who is an author), and even HE opinionated that this book was thought-provoking and a keeper.
1416914307|5.0|I enjoyed this last book in the trilogy.  You get the idea early on in the book that perhaps Jace isn't Clary's brother after all.  Alec will finally admit his love for Magnus Bane.  Sebastian is a new character that adds mystery to this book and you will be shocked when you find out who he is.  I felt this was a page turner, like the first 2 books.  Towards the ending I became worried for Clary with Jace's last battle.  However, the ending is satisfying and I felt a good close to this series.  I look forward to more from this author.

0385340575|5.0|\\"And the women are comin' to cut up your remains...\\"<br /><br />Many have quoted Kipling's ghoulish warning to armies who dared to trespass Afghanistan's hostile terrain, but few have spun a more riveting tale around this admonishment, and none have so cleverly tied decades of war  in Afghanistan to an early morning Manhattan subway car.<br /><br />Make no mistake about it, after last year's dismal \\"Nothing to Lose\\", Lee Child - and Jack Reacher - are back in figurative and literal full force.  Child is the master at hooking the reader on the first page - the first sentence - and this one's \\"Suicide bombers are easy to spot\\" opening unleashes classic Reacher fare: lean, unadorned dialog, intelligent and fact-chocked plotting, and unbridled mayhem.  And unlike \\"Nothing to Lose\\", one must believe that Child got the message, and left \\"Gone Tomorrow\\" mercifully apolitical.  Reacher is back as pop thriller fiction's most interesting character, the iconoclastic drifter with Sherlock Holme's unassailable logic and King Kong's brawn.  Child seasons his drama with detail bordering on minutia that would be tedium if tried by a less talented author, but Child, with factoids as obscure as the origin of \\"hello\\" to the derivation of nine-millimeter Parabellum rounds, hones the tension and sharpens the action with his delicious trivia.  The action never slows as Reacher tracks down the mystery of the fateful 2AM subway ride, unraveling mystery and deceit in a Byzantine maze of war and strategy and terrorism and counter-terrorism that spans decades and continents.  In the process, Child creates a pair of the most unusual and unexpectedly diabolical and terrifying villains that pop fiction has seen in a very long time - if ever.  In short, an escapist thrill-fest that carries enough credibility and interest in the ever-twisting story to make you think, \\"Hmm, I wonder if it could really have happened like that?\\"<br /><br />So thanks, Lee, and welcome back!  You've knocked it out of the park.  This is definitely one of the best Reachers ever - do not miss it!initely one of the best Reachers ever - do not miss it!
