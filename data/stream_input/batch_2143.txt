0425252868|4.0|I read a review of this book online in December. I think it was USA TODAY. I immediately ordered the book from Amazon. I have been interested in WW II aviation since I was a young teenager when I built model airplanes and read books like \\" The First And The Last\\" by Adolf Galland and \\"Stuka Pilot\\" by Hans Ulrich Rudel. I have been reading books about WW II aviation ever since and have been especially interested in books about the USAAF and the Luftwaffe. There is a family connection for me too as my mother's cousin was a B-17 pilot who flew 30+ missions in 1944 and was killed as a member of the 3rd Scouting Force while on a mission on January 15, 1945. Also my girlfriend's father was a bombardier flying A-20's and A-26's over Europe in late 1944 and 1945. About two thirds of this book \\"A Higher Call\\" is about Luftwaffe Lt. Franz Stigler. The name did not ring a bell at first. I researched him and found his name on lists of Luftwaffe Aces and he is also mentioned in the book \\" Battle Over Bavaria\\" by Robert Forsythe ( in connection with JV 44) and \\"Fighters Over The Desert\\" by Christopher Shores and Hans Ring ( in connection with North Africa in 1942 and the \\"Vogel flight\\" controversy), The book shows Franz Stigler as a human being which is refreshing because Luftwaffe aces are usually portrayed as arrogant killers- a prime example being \\" Pretty Boy\\" in the movie \\"Red Tails\\". In the USAAF, bomber crews initially flew 25 missions and were then rotated home ( this was later increased to 30 and then 35 toward the end of the war). American fighterS flew 200 \\" combat hours\\" before rotating out. Luftwaffe pilots flew until they were killed, captured, severely wounded or had a mental breakdown. A few lucky ones were detached as flying instructors or were promoted to a non-flying position. Due to this policy, a few highly skilled ( and lucky) pilots flew hundreds of sorties and many victories, Erich Hartmann, the top German \\"expert\\" had 352 victories and flew 1456 sorties.Gerd Barkhorn flew 1104 sorties to gain 301 victories ( he had flown more than 100 sorties before his first victory). Adolf Galland had 103 victories and 705 sorties. Franz Stigler was credited with 28 victories ( and 30 damaged or probables) in 487 sorties. Franz Stigler was shot down a total of 17 times crash landing or ditching 11 times and taking to his parachute the other 6. This contrasts with American aces such as Francis \\" Gabby\\" Gabreski who had 28 kills in 166 sorties, Robert Johnson 27 kills in 89 sorties, \\"Hub\\" Zemke with 11 kills in 154 sorties and Chuck Yeager who had 12.5 aerial victories in 64 sorties. It must also be remembered that the Germans were on defense at this stage of the war and had no shortage of targets and if shot down over their own territory they were often able to return to duty while surviving allied aircrew were usually made POW. The book tells the story of Steigler from his interest in aviation as a boy ( his father was a WW I pilot) to his stint as a Lufthansa airline pilot and years as a flight instructor. By the time he was posted to JG 27 in North Africa in 1942 Franz was an unusually experienced pilot having flown many different types of aircraft ranging from small single engine trainers to ponderous multi-engined seaplanes. Franz had good luck in meeting the great ace Hans Marseilles who gave him advice on the best way to shoot down enemy aircraft which was simply to get close until the enemy airplane filled your gun-sight and you were so close you could not miss. Franz also had the misfortune to be associated with the \\"Voegel flight\\" where his flight leader and his wingman was suspected of making false claims of aerial victories. This tainted Franz Steigler's image for a while as his comrades thought he had a case of \\" throat ache\\" in that he was anxious to be awarded the coveted \\" Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. ( This brings to mind subplots of the movies \\" The Blue Max\\" and \\" Cross Of Iron\\"). Franz goes on home leave (partly to escape the taint of the \\" Voegel flight\\" scandal). In early 1943 Franz is posted to Sicily. He is engaged in the so called \\" Palm Sunday Massacre\\" where dozens of Ju 52 transports are shot down by allied fighters and Franz and most of his squadron are shot down and Franz is forced to ditch his Bf 109 off the coast of Sicily. It is also over Sicily where Franz has his first encounter with the American Boeing B-17 heavy bomber and realizes how difficult it is to shoot down and a change in tactics is needed. Later in 1943, Franz Stigler and his unit II/JG 27 is posted to north-west Germany for defense of the Reich duties. It is here where he has the memorable encounter with Charlie Brown and his B-17. This encounter seems to have changed Franz to some extent. He lost his case of \\" throat ache\\" and often does not claim victories for allied planes he has shot down or gives credit to new pilots to bolster their confidence. Franz is wounded in 1944 and is withdrawn from combat. In early 1945 he learns to fly the Messerschmitt Me-262 wonder weapon and becomes an instructor. He later joins Adolf Galland's JV 44, bringing his own jet \\" White 3\\" with him. Here he joins a squadron of experts such as Walter Krupinski, Gerd Barkhorn ( who Franz taught to fly a few years earlier), Johannes Steinhoff, Heinz Baer, Guenther Luetzow and several others. Franz flies several sorties with JV 44. He claims 2 more victories and is put in for the Knight's Cross by Galland but in the confusion of the last weeks of the war, neither the medal or confirmation of the victories goes through. Franz survives the war and after much hardship in postwar Germany moves to Canada. Many years later he reunites with Charlie Brown in an incredible set of circumstances outlined in the book. The book is very good but not enough to give it 5 stars. It is obvious that the authors are not pilots and some aviation terms are not properly used. ( This does not bother me as I am not a pilot either), Thereare a few minor historical things that are not correct ( not counting transistors in WW II radios which all used tubes). Franz's brother August flew with Kampfgruppe 806 ( K. Gr. 806) not KG 806. The book indicates that the crew of \\"Ye Olde Pub\\" shot down German Ace Sgt. Ernst Suess of 9/JG 1 on December 16, 1943. All the sources I have found indicate he was shot down by American fighters, probably P-38's. Suess was able to get out of his stricken Bf-109 but was shot and killed while hanging in his parachute. I would like to have heard more about the crew of \\" Ye Olde Pub\\" and some of Franz Stigler's exploits are out there on the 'net and should be in the book. Finally, this book should have an index. However I can recommend this book to both the WW II buff and casual reader.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|A wonderful series 3 but sad also....poor Matthew in last night's episode.  I shall miss them all but at least can keep replaying when I want to connect.
B004GJYRFA|5.0|I is a good show that came on the WB and now call CW they did not last long like other show on WB but what time they was on was good show how a son lost is mother and grow apart from his dad and family find his dad and family and make new friends and find love.
B00023B1LC|5.0|I love Matt Damon and the quality of the movie is awesome. In my opinion you all need this movie.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I just loved it of course:) I would defiantly recommend all of my friend who have not yet read this!
B00821PCJS|4.0|Good offering.  Need to offer seasons.  Decent drama between the characters but some episodes progress a bit slow for my liking as the plot develops.
B001JNNDGA|5.0|I love this movie evertime I watch this movie I still cry the soundtrack to the movie was so so but the music work better in the movie then on the soundtrack I think anyway.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a really fun puzzle game :) it's challenging sometimes but not frustrating. That's what I like most about it.
B001AOKA3W|3.0|Well, I am one who has been entertained by horror movies since I was a child with the first B/W small TV screens.  Throughout this time the writers and producers have learned the macabre fascinates and permeates  the audience before, during & after viewing the movie.  The plot is anticipated and falls in place without damaging any protocol.  The action/destruction scenes were A and entertaining.  There's no skin to show or hedge to mow in this film so the middle school children can get nothing more than questions from the movie.  One exception:  Godzilla appears at least once in complete frontal nudity.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was not a fan of book #1, as a matter of fact it was a chore to read it.  Book #2 was so great, despite the fact that many students read and wrote about the book, they failed to ruin the book for me.  I just hope the movie lives up the book.
B0013AWVZS|5.0|I love the movie and sound tranck work good with the movie it's a good way to pull the movie together.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Perhaps I was draw to this book because I am a teacher of children about the same age as those in this book.  I found the characters poignant, especially the main character, Auggie.  He has a lot on his plate and gets through each event with dignity.  It made me have much more respect and understanding for the children of today, especially those with disabilities.  This book is worth reading for young adults and adults alike.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|I hesitantly gave 3 stars mainly due to the cast with a good past.  The plot itself and even the peripheral scenes/remarks were so blah and repeated movies from not so long ago and others from a rather current library of dangerous flights cure all romance problems including marriage.  The best action was the plane flying down a runway attempting velocity for takeoff while a<br />vehicle sped toward the racing aircraft.
B0038NN3B4|5.0|I went on Atkin's in 2001 and lost 50 pounds and kept it off using the Phases in the book.  Since then I developed hypothyroidism and gained 150 pounds.  Once I finally went to the Dr., got diagnosed and medicated properly and started losing a little at a time just not having the disease thwart my every effort, I decided to start trying to diet again.  The first thing I turned to was Atkins because I had been successful with it before.  In looking n Amazon for the book, I found the New Atkins for a New You.  I looked it over and discovered that it was the diet I had been so successful with before, but even healthier with an emphasis on vegetables and fiber.  I bought it right away, read it as fast as I could, got rid of the tempting carbs in the house (thank goodness my husband is supportive with this change) and started the New Atkins.  I've lost 16 pounds so far - my doctor is thrilled and impressed - and I'll keep going until I reach my maintanence weight.  I don't feel hugry all the time and after a couple of days I don't crave carbs anymore.  I highly recommend this book and this diet for anyone wanting to really change the way they eat and look at the food they're eating.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I wish I'd read the book before seeing the movie based on &#34;Team of Rivals.&#34; On Kindle Fire, I explored the web while reading the book -- tapping on names and places, viewing photos, bios, history surrounding Lincoln, adding depth to reading of a 5-star book. This further exploration is taking me longer to finish the book!
B0060MYM7O|1.0|I watched the first episode and fell asleep multiple times. its like watching lord of the rings but worse. the show is too graphic too with a lot of cussing.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|written with enough detail to make the technical accomplishments seem to be real and not just made up to develop the story
B0090EIILU|3.0|Same movie-different name. Borat, Bruno, Dictator... whatever you call it- its the same. It was very funny though. Okay- so it isn't exactly the same movie but the style of comedy that Sacha Baron Cohen uses can sometimes get a little worn out. But this was my favorite of the three I listed by leaps and bounds! It is a good laugh- you just gotta be in the right mood for it.
B008LFY6NI|5.0|This game is fun for both kids and adult. My 6 year old daughter and I are having so much fun playng this game. The game is very easy to play for both kids and adult and pretty cool. My daughter has created so much artwork,that my refrigerator is full of her paintings and I'm loving it. The first thing that you do is choose the shape of paper, you would like to color on. There are 6 shapes to choose from, circle, square, star, flower,  swirl and sun.  Then  you  slide your finger up and down  on the screen  and the paper will start spinning. The faster you slide your finger  up and down  the faster the paper spins. Then you tap your finger on the size of brush you would like to used, then tap on the color paint and then tap on the screen. You will see your beautiful master piece come alive right before your eyes. When you are finish tap the screen 2 times, then you can save your artwork to your tablet, take a picture and share it with fiends or save it to your device and print it out. I love this game, it is very addictive and awesome. I would recommend this game for everybody who loves to color and enjoy created endless possibilities of cool artwork.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This was the final chapter in the Christopher Nolan Batman trilogy and though there felt like that might have been a few flaws here and there, overall, it was a wonderful finish to Nolan's vision.  And there are a few moments that felt a bit Inception-like, but in the spirit of spoiler-free, I am not saying anything.<br /><br />I wish we could have had more actual face from Tom Hardy playing Bane. But hey, if you look deep enough into the story, I think if you were a fan of the first two, you'll be fine with this one.  And Catwoman was played nicely by Anne Hathaway, and I love the journey that Jospeph Gordon-Levitt's went on throughout.<br /><br />But I have to say this here... looking at the blu-ray cover art... look at the rubble to the left of Batman's belt buckle... Am I daft or does that look like Superman's chest emblem in the rubble there?  IS that some form homage to the \\"Man of Steel\\" movie that Nolan is producing?  Or am I just losing it?  (Maybe I don't need to hear an answer!  LOL)<br /><br />-Bruce aka, Brusimm
B009LT1YZ6|5.0|This is one of the funnest games I've played in a long time!!! The fish moves perfectly by tilting the tablet, it's very accurate. Game is highly addictive and way fun to play. I would pay the .99 cents!!
B002SR2PKG|5.0|I loved it! There was nothing &#34;expected&#34;  Ialways read the book late at night, which just heightened the &#34;scare&#34; factor!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Very good book. Highly recommend. Gave fairly accurate account of the life of military personnel and what it took to get the job done.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The 2nd series was better that the first.  Wonderful characters and love the era it is in.  Cannot wait to watch Series 3.
B00881VLCE|3.0|I like the game, but, of course, you can only see a limited amount of puzzle pieces, not like real life. But, other than that, its fun!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Excellent tv.....can't get enough of this show and I pray it stays around for ever!!!!! I recommend it to everyone I talk to.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|You got to get this game!! Totally worth the $. I recommend wearing headphones! Tip: When playing, DONT look behind u! I did that and won!
B0006L89N8|5.0|Fast service,  great reading for those of us trying to communicate w the opposite sex! Helped me to see things differently.
B005LL4U54|5.0|I absolutely loved the movie and am enjoying the music now. As I listen I can visualize the scenes involved and can truly appreciate the musical score that accompanied them. This is a very enjoyable CD.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Played it at one breathe. Just can't close it before you complete the next level, and next... giving it the highest rating! Definitely a must try!
0345803507|5.0|I heard a rumor that this was a good book for us females! Oh my! A story line & arousal! Holy crap!
B007B6VOG0|5.0|Fun is one of those few new bands that write well crafted songs.  I was pleasantly surprised that the whole album is good.<br />Though some songs are better than others, they're all good.  I don't feel like I need to skip any while listening.<br />They have great voices, songs, play the instruments well and it's just a &#34;fun&#34; album to listen to.<br />Definitely recommend!
B00782O7IY|5.0|I have watched this several times enjoyed it just as much each and every one. What a wonderfully clever and original this film is. The leads, George and Peppy and perfectly delightful and, of course, Uggy (the dog) steals every scene he's in. I can't praise this movie highly enough.
B009GED3HS|4.0|I'd give How I Met Your Mother a solid five stars as a series in general, but this season started very slow, and it has a different feel than the previous 7, where the characters don't feel as strong, and I even saw a little of The Big Bang Theory influence towards the end -which is also a great series, but &#60;spoiler&#62; I think nerds dressing up in a ridiculous superhero costume to face their girlfriend &#60;/spoiler&#62; should stay where it belongs.<br />Other than that, it's all good and the story sets itself nicely to what I understand will be the last season. It obviously has hilarious moments and I'd still say it's worth owning/renting.
0345803485|5.0|Amazed that I could get so engrossed in a book. Great book for us girls to feed our fantasies lol!
B00683JK9K|4.0|I like it very much, except that the puzzle pices are some times hard to get to move to the puzzle.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The book is swallow and not very well written.  Only bought because in a book club.  Would not recommend nor will I read the others
B007IK44CK|4.0|good action flic  but left me empty, bad dialog  of all the MI so far its only one  have given 4 stars
B009G78EE2|5.0|Love it! I love how he talks about real issues! My favorite is Real Love. It's a song about homosexuals and he hits the nail on the head. He is an amazing writer.
B009Z8HCR2|5.0|Long time fan, though not sure what to expect with this one, but they did not disappoint.  I enjoyed every track.
0142419400|4.0|First off let me say that I enjoyed this book. However, I don't think that I enjoyed it as much as many other people have. I can't give it a 5 star rating.<br /><br />I've read SEVERAL books recently that really blew me away, and whenever that happens sometimes books that I'd normally like more just don't end up measuring up to the ones that exceeded my expectations. Anna and the French Kiss was kind of that way for me.<br /><br />I can't blame Anna for not actually being thrilled about going to Paris for her senior year. I have to be honest and say I'm quite terrified of new places and new experiences like this. And so I related to Anna in that way. Where her friends kid her for staying in her room and never leaving campus early on...yeah, that would SO be me. I'm not venturing out unless I have a guide.<br /><br />Anna lucked out by getting sucked into a group of friends almost immediately. St. Clair being one of them. And of course feelings begin to develop. I liked the fact that Anna doesn't have a perfect appearance (neither does St. Clair), but they both overlook these imperfections and see beautiful people in each other anyway.<br /><br />Sometimes I found myself really frustrated with Anna and St. Clair, both individually and as a collective. And the name swapping thing--one minute he's St. Clair and the next minute he's Etienne--really irked me. Maybe it was because I'm not a fan of the name Etienne anyway. It just seemed really unnatural to me. I don't know. It's one thing to have a pet name for someone, but this felt completely different and utterly awkward to me.<br /><br />On the other hand, I very much enjoyed the character growth that both Anna and St. Clair have to go through. The book became about learning a lesson and using the multiple experiences around you to flesh out those life lessons. And I really loved how Stephanie Perkins used the Bridget and Meredith situations to bring about this character growth. Truthfully Bridget and Meredith also grew from the situation and so bonus points for secondary character growth.<br /><br />All in all, I enjoyed it. I'm giving Anna and the French Kiss 4 stars. Have you read Anna and the French Kiss? If so, what did you think? Let me know!ew from the situation and so bonus points for secondary character growth.<br /><br />All in all, I enjoyed it. I'm giving Anna and the French Kiss 4 stars. Have you read Anna and the French Kiss? If so, what did you think? Let me know!
B002RI9UBS|4.0|I really enjoyed imagining his environment on the life boat and raft, and how he survived. The ending was great as it leaves you wondering which scenario was the truth and if he is insane or just a great story teller.
0865479410|5.0|the title alone says it.  I love this sort of philosophy that acknowledges all the imperfections of the world but still finds a way to be happy.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|This app is great for kindle fire hd it awesome and the videos play pretty well get it and try it i did and it turned out well for me
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I am not a reader and I could not put the book down. It was so interesting like a mystery where every time you picked it up the book would take another twist..
B0001O3YD0|4.0|it is a GOOD movie. Unfortunately,This is the only one of the two movies sent  that worked. His other movie had to be tossed
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|the series itself is fantastic, but the process of buying and watching on Amazon is merely ok. Netflix has a much more elegant interface, much more user friendly.  That said, I figured it out without too much wasted time, and I did appreciate the ability to download. Maybe it's because Amazon sells SO many things, there is so much clutter on the screen, and it's hard to figure out where to look?
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Couldn't put it down!  Read it in two days.  If you like sex, suspense, drama then this is the book for you·
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I could not stop reading this book, seemed like the first half was character development but kept me engaged the entire time, the I couldn't wait to see how it ended.
B008QPCCQQ|5.0|I must have read Little Women 10-20 times as a child and cried every time I read it.  The relationship between the sisters is so touching.  It wasn't until much later that I made the connection with the Civil War, and reading it as an adult made the story even richer.  This book is a wonderful read aloud to middle school and high school students studying the Civil War time period.  I highly recommend reading the book before watching the movie.  The movie is great, but cannot begin to touch the emotions portrayed in the book!  The other works of Alcott as also as touching.  I loved Eight Cousins and Rose in Bloom almost as much as Little Women!
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|As the title of my game review says, this game is fun. When I first heard of this game I thought it was just going to be a rip off of Super Mario Bros which it kind of is! But that is a good thing though. Like the original Mario games, Lep's World has a smooth control sceme that I like a lot. It is not to difficult which kind of is a bit of a let down because I like a challenge in games but this game gives enough of a challenge. I will say the enemies are not very innovative which kind of sucks but who cares if the game is fun right? I do not think this game is the best game on the app store, oh god no it is not the best. I will say though that this game is still a fun game that is good for just passing by the time. If you want what my review is exactly I would give it a 7.75 out of 10 but since I have to go by stars I will round it and give this game a 4 star review.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|I felt like a fringe addict, I love the show and could not seem to stop watching it.  Wish the last season was available on Amazon Prime for free!!!
B000HZED8S|4.0|Good bit of action . And has a good cast of solid characters. Would recomend renting unless u plan on watching more then once.
6304712936|5.0|clearity was very good, item was shipped very fast, would not be afraid to us this provider of movie again.
B001BANK32|5.0|This was  a very interesting book and a must read!!!  Stephen really out-did himself on this one, much more interesting than the movie that was made.
B0074D3CAQ|3.0|It starts out rather slowly. Got more interesting as time went on. The pilgrimage became tiresome and almost ludicrous before it was over. The book made some provocative points but had an ending that was somewhat farfetched although predictable by the time you arrived .
0446547646|5.0|this book was great as always, Hope there is a movie. Never disappointed in Mr. Sparks. Read everyone he writes.
B007SGM084|5.0|What a wonderful love story.<br />Don't be influenced by reviews that only call this overly erotic. You must read all three books.
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|It didn't feel like a Hollywood blockbuster but more like a down-to-earth take on being a teenager with a disturbed past.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I really enjoy that the weather is live.  This does not keep you guessing of what is going to happen and wait for weather on TV live.  I think this is a terrific app and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND it to EVERYONE!!!  Thank you VERY MUCH for the availability of this wonderful app 24 hours a day!!!  I will continue to use it all that I can!!!
B009EEFTMC|2.0|Kind of boring and just not interested in it. Others games I would rather play. And it was confussing to me
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|you get to win and lose you have a distress call for you allies and you get to expand your army base
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I watched the first season on netflix and basically right after I finished I got on amazon to see how many seasons were available!  the cast is amazing, but Maggie Smith is reason enough to watch the show.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|a book about a dog with human mind. This book was the most wonderful book ive ever read. This book reminds me of my old dog
B005HSL626|4.0|Great way to keep kids busy...Not one to play every day though or it would get boring. Not a brain challenge.
B003NS2T9G|5.0|Needed something engaging to get through upheavals and Torchwood delivered.  My daughter has been after me to watch it and I am so grateful I have.
B001U9BRNE|5.0|Great Concert, video quality is excellent, a must have for your collection.  I didn't know that he worked with so many Artists.
B008S4FZHI|5.0|I keep saying it and I will for as many Scarpetta novels Cornwell writes (and hopefully next will = soon, VERY soon) loved it, can't wait for the next and the next and the next..... keep them coming.....
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|Good story but long. Denzel makes a very convincing case for the character. Scary to think how true to life it MIGHTbe.
0307960471|5.0|I have now read all of the Harry Hole books, and this one was by far the best. Super exciting throughout, and of course the plot twists all the way until the end. One thing I've learned from reading the books in this series: you may think you know who the bad guy is, but really you don't have a clue.<br /><br />I wish there would be more of these books!
B001B51B9M|5.0|Nice conversion, a quality upgrade from the origional movie, flawless soundtrack.  Robert Preston did such a great job with this, it's easy to see why he was the directors first choice.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Very good book. Made you feel a part of the people involved.<br />I would recommend to any young adult or older
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was a fantastic read. I found myself anticipating the next times I sat down with it. It is warm ,moving, scary, and very exciting. I want to look into the other titles by this author. Great job!
1846556007|3.0|Of the entire series, I liked this one the least. In fact, I don't even think it's that necessary to understanding the stories that follow.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game or app as you call it is very challenging and addicting, especially for people who like to play card games. My only problem is I cannot get past one deck because two decks or more are more difficult and my brain needs more practice.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|After running this app on my kindle and really enjoying it, I uninstalled the old battery app on my phone and installed this app on it as well. I enjoy how it gives me precise amount of time I can do things.
B00A6D5GBE|4.0|Fun. Challenging. Frustrating at times. Thoroughly enjoy. And free. !  A pleasant way to pass the time. I recommend this game!
B00061QK02|5.0|Anchorman is one of the funniest movies ever, so clearly I can't say anything but good things about this DVD.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I love Doodle god because it is so fun and entertaining it is just like the computer version but even funner
145210655X|5.0|The humor is great for the Big Star Wars fan as you read along! It has become our go to nighttime reading!
B00846REIS|4.0|Easy read, It is a lot like 50 shades has a good story line and keeps you wanting to read more.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Really enjoy this app but it dumped me.  I had been up to level 30 but when I turned it on yesterday everything I had built up was gone and I was back to square one. The only possible reason I can think of for this happening is that I removed some apps from my kindle (but not this one). Anyway great app but a big dissapointment for unexplained reasons. Maybe someone can suggest what actually happened.
B0060MYK7G|5.0|Note: I saw every episode of season 2 with XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />After a thrilling first season, the historical drama THE BORGIAS continues to amaze and shock with their opulence and depravity. Academy Award winner Jeremy Irons is perfectly cast as Rodrigo Borgia, also known as Pope Alexander Sixtus, the patriarch of the infamous family. I've read that there are several historical inaccuracies, but as far as I can tell, this series is more accurate than The Tudors, Rome and especially the CGI-blood filled and inexplicably profanity-laced SPARTACUS: BLOOD AND SAND (and the following seasons of that show). The costumes and sets are extraordinarily well-done. My only complaint in season II is the weird scenes between Micheletto, Cesare's condottieri, and another man...in a graveyard. The afore-mentioned part of both men was weird enough, but to set the scene in a cemetery...even weirder. There's no historical basis for that scene, that I'm aware of. That is my only complaint with season II.<br /><br />RATED TV-MA for graphic violence, brief strong language (one use of the f-word) and copious amounts of sexuality/nudity.<br /><br />Season III begins Sunday April 14, 2013, on Showtime with new episodes available the day after they air via XFinity On Demand and also available in HD.
B00499NHLC|5.0|A friend at work encourage me to watch this show, and I found it absolutely enchanting. The production values, writing and acting all exceeded my expectations. All Sherlock fans must watch this series.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another Mitch Rapp spy thriller.  As usual, Vince Flynn has hit another one out of the park.  The characters in this series have been well developed over time and the storyline is highly relevant and most likely reflects some of the realities of the world of CIA agents and special ops types.  I'm already looking forward to the next installment in the Rapp series.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|kinda pointless review it works just like the pc version what is there to like or dislike about that seems redundant to review an overused app
0446572993|5.0|Love Baldacci stories.  Great stories and always a page turner.  Anxious for the next book and hopefully, one of these days, a movie.
B007KOMTUI|4.0|I had just started watching mad men on netflix and discovered that season 5 was not yet on. Ot was a continuation of storylines from season four with some new twists. Season two still my favorite.
B000FCKPHG|4.0|Very informative book on how to look at things from a different perspective. Said easier than done, however, if one could apply even 25% of what is learnt from this book, this world would be a better place. This book is not like reading Swami Vivekananda's book or some other philosophy books. It is about how a growth mindset learns from mistakes and works towards improving constantly. Book also talks about how knowledge and skills can be gained by hard work, training and dedication. I enjoyed reading the book and recommend the same.
0307891402|3.0|This book is beautiful but if you are someone who has played lots of rpg games kinda redundant and full of unimportant info love the beastiary section
B007THA4FI|1.0|I wasn't expecting Harry Potter, but I also wasn't expecting a dismal tale of unhappy, unappealing people.  The only redeeming characters die, and the rest just go on being incredibly unpleasant.  I kept waiting for it to get better, but it only continued its downhill slide.  I know that Ms. Rowling is attempting to attract a more adult audience, but more like this is sure to drive them away.
B0054R6BFM|3.0|This is not the kind of book I normally read, but the other day my daughter mentioned the book Thirteen Reasons Why by Jay Asher.  She told me it was a very popular book among teens, that it dealt with the issue of teen suicide, and that it was soon to make its way to the big screen with Disney star Selena Gomez playing the role of Hannah.  With this in mind, I listened to my Kindle read me the book over a 6-hour period while driving on a recent trip out of state.<br /><br />Thirteen Reasons Why is a pretty engrossing read (or, in my case, listen).  It begins with a young man receiving a box of seven audio tapes on which he finds the voice of his friend Hannah.  This is jarring to him because Hannah had recently taken her own life.  The tapes contain Hannah's explanation of her own suicide and names thirteen individuals who played a part in her decision to take her own life.  Whoever received the tapes was to listen to all of them (and, if they so chose, to travel to the various spots on the enclosed map to better understand where the various episodes she describes on the tapes happened).  The tapes were then to be sent to the next person included in her story.  In all, then, the tapes were to be listened to by all thirteen people involved in Hannah's story.  To quell the threat of somebody simply destroying the tapes, Hannah reveals at the beginning of her story that an unknown person held a second set of tapes and would release them in a public manner if the tapes did not make their full rotation.<br /><br />My initial interest in hearing this story was based on (a) its seeming popularity among teens, (b) it's coming greater popularity once the movie is released and (c) the subject matter of suicide, especially in a teen book.  I was particularly interested to know whether or not the book in any way encouraged or romanticized suicide.  Furthermore, I was curious to know how the book would handle the issues of life, death and ultimate meaning (questions inevitablyintertwined with the issue of suicide).<br /><br />It is easy to see why teens would find this book interesting.  It's written in a very engaging manner.  The unusual format of the story is actually very effective in building anticipation, tension and curiosity in the reader.  Asher uses this format to great effect and I found it to be a very intriguing method of writing.<br /><br />The book contains some objectionable material.  There is some profanity, which is to be expected in a secular novel dealing with teenagers.  There is some sexual material, but I do want to add that these sections are not needlessly gratuitous and they do indeed stand at the core of the story.  I say this because a large part of Hannah's story involves the unwanted sexual advances, comments, and gossip of which she finds herself a victim.<br /><br />I thought back to my own high school days while listening to this novel.  Who can deny that gossip about \\"loose girls\\" floats through school hallways with frequency and with devastating effects.  Hannah's story powerfully reminds the reader of the devastating power of lies and gossip.  It is a gripping tale of the kind of viciousness one encounters in high school.  Girls in particular seem to be the special objects of these kinds of whisper campaigns, and the book did make me wince as I tried to remember if I had joined in whispering or laughing at some salacious story involving some girl in school.<br /><br />One of the poignant points of the story is just how powerful our actions are.  High school is a brutal place, again, maybe especially for girls.  Hannah's tale, as it unfolds, reveals through her vivid description of the various episodes leading up to her desperate and tragic action just how deeply words and actions cut.  It reminds the reader that playing fast and loose with somebody's reputation or moral character is a terrible thing to do and can have catastrophic consequences.<br /><br />Without giving the story away, I was struck byAsher's insertion into the story of an element of moral ambiguity and conflict on Hannah's own part.  I will go so far as to mention Hannah's own inactivity in the face of a crime perpetrated upon another.  In the story, Hannah is cognizant of and crushed by her own inactivity, and it contributes in its own way to her own crumbling life.  Even so, it keeps the story from becoming overly-simplistic in its categories and it very effectively leaves the reader with a great sense of conflict over and tragic irony in Hannah herself.<br /><br />In all, though, it must be said that Asher has created a profoundly effective tool for introspection and awareness.  I daresay that nobody will read this book dispassionately.  It does indeed accomplish the task of creating awareness as far as our interpersonal relationships go.<br /><br />That being said, I listened to the story with a growing sense of unease.  By the time it was over, I understood the source of my unease:  namely, the almost complete absence of any element of transcendence.  I do not mean by this that I was shocked by the absence of the gospel (disappointed, of course, but not shocked - the book is not and never claimed to be a religious work).  But one does wonder at the absence of mere transcendence or any evidence of a real grappling with transcendence on the part of Hannah in the story.  She never seems to ask what comes after death, what the greater meaning of life is, or of any awareness of transcendence at all.  She never seems remotely concerned with the question of what lies beyond, or of the greater questions of meaning, truth, or God.  There is a brief, tongue-in-cheek reference to religion on her part, but that is it.<br /><br />Again, as the work is a secular work, I shall resist the rather obvious point that I wish Hannah had given thought to the truthfulness of the gospel itself.  Many people live and die with no concern over the gospel.  That is tragic but, again, not surprising.  But I do find the lack of any interaction on Hannah's part with questions of transcendence itself to be frankly unbelievable, especially on the part of a character that evidences real thoughtfulness.  Yes, I am fully aware of the fact that the particular circumstances that would lead a teenager to contemplate suicide can grow so large that they would eclipse transendent reality, but I find the absence of this element in a character so possessing of introspection and awareness (and the story reveals that Hannah is fully possessing of both) to be a major flaw.<br /><br />The book is a mixed bag.  Regardless, it is a story that is well-known and is about to be even more well-known.  It might just provide a wonderful discussion opportunity with your teenage kids.
B004KZOXJA|5.0|I can't believe it took me this long to finally read this. I actually joined a read-a-long to push myself to begin this. Crazy right? Once I finally started it had my complete attention.<br /><br />At first Lena was too much of a goody-two-shoe. She follows all the rules, and is ruled by fear (perfectly understandable seeing as what happened to her mom). I still didn't like it anyway, but I figured she would change obviously. And hell did she! She becomes this incredibly brave girl. She may still have her insecurity and panic attacks but she grows so much. Leaves Hana completely in the dust.<br /><br />What was hard for me to accept was how everyone, specially Lena at first, could think of love, emotions, as a disease. Like it's a different entity from you. Emotions is part of who you are, taking that away just leaves you as a shell made of skin, blood, and bones. I just could never really accept that, as well done as the world building was, I could never truly go along with it.<br /><br />Speaking of world building, it was excellent. How every chapter had a little piece of the Book of Shhh, or the kids games, and the quotes and poetry that dealt with love were classified as dangerous words. It really brought home how everything is and how people were brainwashed taught to think about love. How they nit and picked and changed texts to suit their needs. I actually would have liked to know more about the new order, I thought it was pretty interesting how apparently god and science were going together now.<br /><br />All the relationships here were beautifully done. I loved the connection between Lena and Gracie. Gracie totally kicks ass. She may not talk, but she can think for herself and is so loyal and caring. I was kinda disappointed with Hana towards the end. So much talk but then nothing. I'm hoping she turns into an awesome inside woman later on or something.<br /><br />I can't wait to find out what happens to Lena and Alex now. This is a must read for dystopian lovers! ;)lovers! ;)
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a fun game but very easy.  I was able to fly through the first few different levels - each individual screen only took me about 5 seconds.  Even though it was very easy and I went through the game pretty quickly, it was still a fun way to pass some time.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is waaay more fun than I thought it would be.Some puzzles are tricker than others so it totally makes your brain work more :)

B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was absolutely wonderful. I just couldn't put it down. A must read! I can not wait to watch the movie
B009O2XY12|3.0|I didn't realize this was a childrens game.  I think it would be good for kids but I didn't notice it was geared towards kids.  It is very cutsy and has really annoying sound effects that aren't likely annoying to little girls but are to adults.
B004HD61KE|4.0|Typical thriller. A plausible - although farfetched - plot based on the timeline of when America was &#34;discovered&#34; combined with the Mormon church and of course the famed Sigma group of operatives on the trail. While nothing in this book stretched the envelope of the thriller set, this is a good read and entertaining.

B00634GHJA|3.0|Overall it has great potential.... but it needs to be more user friendly.... and for some reason it ONLY shows up on ONE of my kindles... the old Kindle Fire not the new HD? It is ok to use because it gets the job done but it could use some improvement on the P/C side and the Kindle side. The documentation could also use some work. Send and receive could use some clarification or reminders.
B00006B1HH|5.0|My friend loves this movie and I couldn't believe she didn't own a copy. I Love the songs and the corky storyline that i just had to get it for her.  Great buy
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|Well written. Unbelievable ending. Tough subject matter. Makes one really aware of mental illnes. Shriver had to have done a tremendous amount of research. Subject matter is tough to read.

B000HKW7E0|2.0|I bought this as a gift to someone who apparently loves Chevy Chase and his movies of this genre, but it's been 3 months since I got it for them and it's still in the wrapper.  Bahh, it's the last time I go against my own taste and throw my money away.
B006LSZECO|5.0|What an unbelievable  ending. Could have done without so much foul language. I am no prude but, thought the language was a little over board.jFlynn has an amazing and creative mind.
B007R41E8O|1.0|They suggested this to me based on what I have played on my kindle fire. I would not suggest purchasing this because it never loaded properly. It would get half way through opening the game and stop completely. Very irritating when it sounded like it would be a great game to play
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love this book it is so funny I think that this book is one of the best books ever
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I was not willing to jump to this show after LOST and now I regret it. A fantastic show. I will watch every episode.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|What a wonderful story. Have recommended often. So very touching. Makes one think about those terrible times in history. Would be a great read for teenage youth.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|this was such an amazing book. It comes in as number two for the best Nicholas sparks book; only second to the notebook!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I have several games on my Kindle Fire at this point- enough so that I have to get very picky about which I keep installed. This game is challenging enough that it's never been a question - it's going to stay until I've mastered every last level- which will probably take several months (at least!)
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|This movie kicks ass. It starts off good with the characters being introduced and when the actions hits, it doesn't let up. Some say the lack of satire is a drawback, and I suppose it might be if you're a fan of the comic. I've never read the comic. All I know is this movie kicks ass. Definite recommendation to all fans of action/shoot em up flicks.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|used it in my knife sharpens very good. a bit hard to hold with 2 fingers but being careful it gets the job done
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I loved this movie.  The actors were all wonderful; some of my favorites are in here....I have shared it with many friends, and everyone has enjoyed it.
B0042EJD8A|1.0|I am a degreed chemist, a certified CHMM  with the Nat. Inst. of Haz. Waste Managment and 20 years in the field, just to illustrate credentials. This film is quite well done for artistic sake, but for people interested in a fair, balanced discussion on the facts regarding fracking, this is quite poor. He even mispronounced 2 of the chemicals he mentions. Watch this to educate yourself about what the issues are only, but do not believe his conclusions or where he leads you. watch this and \\"Truthland\\" and \\"Fracknation\\" then decide for yourself.
B006BXTOFC|4.0|El Camino is surprisingly entertaining. The songs are catchy and easy to listen to. I highly recommend the album. The mp3 is a steal at $2.99.

B004WGIXX4|3.0|Decent movie with one of my favs - Natalie Portman. Just very lightweight entertainment that doesn't achieve the comedic level or the sexiness it should
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I absolutely love this game!! I've already played it about 6 times. Every time I play it there are new things to find. You have to use the hint a lot your first time but the hints don't run out unless the hint leads you straight to where you need to find the objects. If it's just to find out which direction you need to go, the hints stay. It's very beneficial. It's just as fun now as it was when I bought it. One of the best apps I've ever bought. I would recommend it to anyone. Can't wait for the second edition to come out!!!

B001NLKT60|5.0|It might seem strange to review the 2nd book in a trilogy. I enjoyed all three books, but for me this was the one where it all came together.<br /><br />Why? Well, the first book focuses mainly on journalist Blomkvist, and I suppose having read enough sleuth books to fill a trailer park of trucks, he was somewhat familiar. Replace the gun with a pen, and he could have been like any detective. Salander appears strongly in book 1 and the investigation of a young girl's disappearance has all the requisite marks of a current-day Swedish 'Silence of the Lambs'.<br /><br />But while Salander is different and offbeat enough to keep those pages turning, book 2 is where we really get under her skin and discover what drives her. Some of it makes for uncomfortable reading, but it does explain why she identifies strongly with the young girl who has disappeared - feared dead - in book one. Yes, Larsson rambles on a bit about seemingly unconnected neo-nazis and some of the darker shades of Swedish politics, not all totally relevant to the story line. But you are soon back with Blomkvist and Salander and a riveting, edgy plot - so all is as quickly forgiven as you ride along with one of recent fiction's more memorable, offbeat characters.
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|Ford employed a very interesting technique in that in that several future outcomes were revealed early in the time frame.<br />One would normally assume that this would lessan the reader's interest; however, in my case, I found that it increased my interest and involvement in the story.
B005NPLWYU|5.0|This album is unique and heavily melodic. The more you listen, the more you like it. And on 180gm vinyl at 45 rpm the sound quality is outstanding.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|The characters and fictional aspects of the plot in the book are a skeletal and implausible contrivance that serves to personalize the important nations, factions, social and political movements, and developments that shaped the events described. The fiction here is a method for teaching, keeping you sufficiently entertained and invested in the characters as stand-ins for the various historical interests at play. Since I don't know history am curious, I do enjoy this way of learning about it. But if I did know history sufficiently that I was not learning about it from this book, then the book would have nothing for me.
0425263908|5.0|this book is exactly as i expected it to be!! so worth buying!!!! i would reccomend this to anyone who wants a little romance in their lives!!
0765325950|5.0|Well written, makes me hungry for more of the same.  Now I just need to find the time to read all of them together again.  Mr. Sanderson has carried on the writing style of Robert Jordan with his own skillful additions.  I was wondering if he could pull all of the loose threads together and he did so. If you haven't read the series from the beginning, you are missing out!
B001UTW7QU|3.0|I enjoy way\tching the show, but being a bit hard of hearing, closed captions would be appreciated. I hate sticking ear buds in my head.
B007REV4YI|4.0|The first half hour or so is great, but the rest is meh.  The last hour drags bady, because you wish the bad guy would just shut up.
B008M34INW|1.0|The story was weak, the filming was very poor, and the acting was not all that great.  Not a good choice for me.
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|I love this movie/series.  I love the actors, just the hold thing. Love the executive producers too, especially Mark W
B001UTW7QU|4.0|This series is like a modern version of X-Files. It deals with all sorts of controversial/quack science ideas, but is entertaining and well written nonetheless. Joshua Jackson does a good job portraying Peter and is a much better actor than I thought he was. Anna Torv is just barely passable as Olivia Dunham. Her mannerisms are very annoying. The high of the show for me is John Noble as Walter Bishop. He plays a great crazy person, (Denathor in LOTR) but yet has an emotional range that most actors wish they had.

Regardless of what it does I am going with &#34;how good can it be if I don't remember it after a month or so.&#34;
1400096936|3.0|Rating this book is extremely difficult for me. Parts were an absolute 5-star read. Certain things annoyed me so much, I wanted to put the book down and forget about it. Much of the book was some combination of those two extremes.<br /><br />I love that Winslow tackled our failed war on drugs, and the government deception that has propelled it. The story is well researched and contains sections of flawless writing.<br /><br />This one book takes on decades of the drug war and, because of that, is long, sometimes dragged out, and maybe a bit too ambitious. At times it felt more like nonfiction rhetoric on government corruption than a fictional story.<br /><br />We have several plot lines, even more subplots, and dozens of characters, all with POV parts. I felt like I needed a chart to keep up with them all. POV characters switched often. By mid-book, they were switching within the same paragraph, which I found jarring. And most of the characters were bad guys, giving me little to care about in terms of who made it through the battles.<br /><br />For the most part, I felt like there was too much going on for me to latch on to any one story.<br /><br />I have a lot of respect for Winslow's ambition here. The truth within these pages is a powerful story that needs to be told. I think it would have worked better had he told the story in a tighter POV, with two or three characters we could follow closely, or dropped the attempt at fictionalization altogether.
B007PVHMCG|3.0|My kids are heavily into Minecraft, so this set was a good match for them.<br /><br />The set was easy to put together, and putting this set together helped the kids plan out a larger scale Minecraft creation.<br /><br />Lots of small parts, so it's best to work with this set on a table or other flat, solid surface (not on carpet)!

For example this program on my orginal little Kindle has formatting problems with some PDFs rendering them less than readable.  This seems to work okay on the Fire HD.
140123769X|5.0|The last couple installments of the Fables trade back books have been good but not as excellent as previous books in the series.  This book however was truly excellent.  I really enjoyed it a lot.<br /><br />Bigby’s and Snow’s children are growing up and being forced to assume responsibilities.  Winter inherited her kingdom in the last book and this book focuses on Therese and Dare.  Therese follows her creepy toy boat’s advice and ends up in Toyland.  Toyland is a land inhabited by evil toys that needs a new Queen.  As Therese struggles to survive and struggles with her sanity, her brother Dare sets off to try and find her.<br /><br />This was an excellent installment in this series.  I loved the adventures in Toyland and how involved we are getting with Bigby’s and Snow’s kids.  The prophecy about Bigby’s and Snow’s kids is slowly coming to light.  We’ve meet the child that will become a king, in this story we read about the child that does an evil thing and the child that dies to stop her.<br /><br />The evil toy kingdom is one that’s been written about before.  Mike Raicht’s The Stuff of Legend graphic novels do an excellent job exploring a similar theme.  This is a dark story and it is very well done.  I love how the story wraps up and what Therese decides to do to atone.<br /><br />There is also a side story about the Fables going to explore Mister Dark’s old castle and finding Nurse Sprat.<br /><br />The illustration was excellent and in keeping with previous installments.  Fans of the series should be pleased with this addition, it’s one of the best Fables installments released in a while.<br /><br />Overall a very solid addition to the Fables series.  I really enjoyed reading more about Snow and Bigby’s children and how they are slowly fulfilling the prophecy.  This whole series is recommended to fans of fairy tales and urban fantasy who love graphic novels.
B0063M22QO|1.0|Freezes up/wont respond/screen goes blank. I would rate this very poor performance for a game sold by AMAZON. Hope this does not reflect on all the games but its the truth.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I just had a baby and this game has made his naptimes more enjoyable for me when I don't feel like napping. thanks
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This app is required if you want or need to know what is the file level makeup of the pretty icons on your screes.  Of course if you don't care or don't know why you should care then find something else to get.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is so adicting I never get out of the my house<br />everyone should play this who cares if it is $7 itvis still worth it!!!!!&iexcl;!!!!!!!!
B0076DELIG|4.0|This was a well thought out mystery novel with in depth analysis of police procedure for handling a cold case.
B007SGM084|3.0|Easy reading. Ana is annoying most of the time; but Christian was what keep me reading. I wanted to know his outcome.
B008M87GJK|4.0|It works well and it is interesting to see a viewpoint of the news that is non-US in its bias.  As the BBC speaks English (remember not American) I have assumed that any strange things I read is not a result of a translation error but merely the bias of an older, related culture that is neither American nor European.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app does everything it sets out to do, no more no less. It does not drain my battery like some of the other reviews complain about.
B003L77G2Y|2.0|i am sorry about this but dvds were all scratched up.<br /> and box was all broken, which probably happened in the mail.<br /> but as you said good to very good? sorry
B00BESLHEA|4.0|None stop action and blood, just what you expect in a Tarantino movie. Always enjoy Russel Crowe and Lucy Liu
B0050DZ8J0|4.0|It works.  I have decided not to use it and onlly go to linkedin on my computer.  Keeps traffic down on the Fire.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Read it years ago, classic literature. One of the many classics that everyone should read just to acquaint themselves with different styles of literature.
B00821PCJS|5.0|i thoroughly enjoyed the series. the quality of the video was broken at times but overall it was an enjoyable experience.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Follows the novelists writing to a tee. Glad I read first and started watching afterwards. Riveting and intense. Love this series.
B006RXPYXM|5.0|This is the first movie I bought for my Kindle and I was surprised by its quality. Apparently faithful to actual events, Queen Elizabeth took on a new persona. Hellen Mirren shows her capable, stoic side as well as her anguish that can only be shown when she is out in the woods alone. Prince Philip is kind of nasty and very macho in a British sportsman kind of way. The portrayal fits his character but is jarring nonetheless.
B003IDMUSG|5.0|I enjoyed the book very much held me to the very end. Falling in love with Grisham.  Twist at the end was great.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|The only thing I would like to see different is how you gain friends! I have 1 friend & it is lonely out there lol This game is a blast to play & I have so much fun seeing what kind of new dragon I get from mating! So far so good with no glitches & I've been playing non stop daily since Feb! Hoping they get some additional decorations & can't wait to see what they roll out as this game progresses!
B000GW8OAA|4.0|Terrible format.  Go buy this movie on Bluray.  Why would you even look at HD DVDs anyway? Bluray won the format wars.
B00633W614|5.0|Well written.  Characters feel real.  Difficult to put down and left me wanting to read the next book in the Chronicles.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I'm able to keep playing without having to buy coins. its nice not to spend money to play. takes 30 seconds to earn coin but is entertaining.
0618154043|5.0|Make sure you have The Hobbit, Lord of the Rings and the Silmarillion first then this book will give you additional information.
0061673730|3.0|I got about half way through and it got really boring.  It had a good beginning and kept my attention... but at some point it felt like the author was rambling on and I stopped reading.  By now I would have to start over and fear I would lose interest in the same place.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love every character, every frame, every storyline, every plot twist, every nuance!  Keep 'em coming.  Can't wait for season 4.
B007N9FKCY|3.0|There was much hype about this game. Instantly I wanted to play it because it looked so funny with the animation. After playiing for a while i came to the conclusion that it was a pretty decent game! nothing way out there that makes it awesome, but by no means a bad game. 3.5 stars out of 5
B005KELW26|5.0|Perfect color, perfect functionality! It protects the kindle well and I love how it converts to a stand. I would buy another one.
B000HA4WTS|4.0|Terrible format.  Go buy this movie on Bluray.  Why would you even look at HD DVDs anyway? Bluray won the format wars.
B009VMN3RA|4.0|I was a bit skeptical going into this book, fearing it would be another tabloid-esque tell all in the vein of Christina Crawford's &#34;Mommy Dearest.&#34; But it is very clear to me after reading through it (couldn't put it down) that this was written with a very balanced hand and damaged heart. As a fan of Shirley MacLaine myself, I was concerned this would damage my admiration for her. I am not sure yet. I do see her as less of an icon and more of a woman of damage herself, and with hurt comes reactive behavior that can surprise us all.<br /><br />My only disconnect with Ms. Parker's story is the obvious unexplained chapters of her life. Most specifically, her fathers identity. I also found her often using a &#34;ten dollar word when a nickel word would do.&#34; It distracted from the connection that the reader feels with the author.<br /><br />But overall, it was a fairly well written, engaging tale of familial challenges.  It was not a tell- all &#34;I'll get back at her&#34; scandalous story, but instead, a balanced and engaging memoir from a woman who reminds us all that we can not pick what family we are born into.
B008L1DNGI|2.0|average game in my opinion. I don't neccesarily like it. Maybe for the younger audience/generation. Get it for free don't buy it.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|For what it is it is pretty good........I'm not really in to romance novels, and the he loves me he loves me not stuff.
B000G8P1VE|4.0|Terrible format.  Go buy this movie on Bluray.  Why would you even look at HD DVDs anyway? Bluray won the format wars.
B005S9EK5Y|2.0|I was disappointed too.  This is a beautiful musical with songs and passion.  This film version made it look like a joke.  I hated all the singing except for Eponine.  The only people who would really like this movie are those that haven't seen the real thing on stage.  Go get the \\"Les Miserables: 10th Anniversary Dream Cast\\" dvd,  that is far better than this film.
0316224588|5.0|I love stories about &#34;Who did it!&#34; This is one that keeps you intrigued.<br />Just when you think you have figured it out, you haven't.
1451613512|5.0|It should be required reading for jr./sr. high students. A totally mind-blowing read about our government and time to change the way American's think.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|Terrible format.  Go buy this movie on Bluray.  Why would you even look at HD DVDs anyway? Bluray won the format wars.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is asome. It is like temple run. You can yet acted to it. It is edicting. You can get so in to it.
B00634GHJA|3.0|Requires your regular PC be on at the same time (too bad wireless is not good enough in this case) and you must also put the app on your PC.  I have not been able to transfer anything yet, though I've tried.  The jury is still out...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is a fun game that you can play when ever you want, where ever you want. The object of the game is to get a lot of coins and not get caught by the police man. Subway Surfers also changes the theme every once in a while. For example, it could be, New York City, Rio, and many more. And that is why I recommend you to get Subway Surfers!
B000GW8OAK|4.0|Terrible format.  Go buy this movie on Bluray.  Why would you even look at HD DVDs anyway? Bluray won the format wars.
0446691437|2.0|I immediately felt deceived after opening my order. As I looked at the book, the upper right corner appeared to be chewed up by, what I'm guessing to be, a dog. The first half of the book's pages, while still completely readable, were torn, bitten off, and looked far below \\"good condition\\". In the overall appearance, this book looks below average and would not be aesthetically pleasing on a shelf.<br /><br />Buyer beware.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|For the price, AMAZING!  Though I've had fun with it--very cool to be able to shoot short videos--I've not been able to post anything to Face Book yet and some of my photoes just (seem?) to disappear.  This is probably user error, which I am still trying to determine!  It is definitely worth a try!
B000E1MTY0|5.0|Terrible format.  Go buy this movie on Bluray.  Why would you even look at HD DVDs anyway? Bluray won the format wars.

B006TF6WAM|5.0|Quirky unusual read which I found very enjoyable. I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes this type of book.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Controls my games with precision.  Its been working for years now.  Never been hurdled through a wall either. Holds nice charge.
145470246X|5.0|This is not a book for the \\"faint of heart.\\"  The instructions are wonderful but one needs to have first followed beading directions in less difficult work.  The difficulty is well worth the results.  This book of artwork (for that is what Lippert's designs are) is essential for even the most experienced.  The new technique of seating rivolis in bezels is worth the price alone.  I received this book as a Christmas present and two months later, every time I open the book, I am still awed.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|Whenever I miss an episode on tv I rent that missed episode from Amazon. I love Criminal Minds been a fan since season 1.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|This is a fun game to play if you need to kill time.  Have it on my phone and my kindle!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I always look forward to reading Nicholas Sparks books.  They hold my interest although they are fiction many stories can be related to real life situations.  This book is especially fun to read because it is also has some drama in addition to the usual love store.
B004DM0UII|5.0|the best app for music yet. the sleep timer and wake up feature is better than any alarm clock. thank you amazon.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|I'm not often touched by a funny Sci Fi, but this one gets to me sometimes. I think the acting is really good, the issues very current, and it's also exciting. The Daleks are my least favorite thing, I find them boring......but all the other things are fun. I LOVE all the Doctors and their sidekicks, and it's unbearably sad when they have to part.....it doesn't seem fair. Love the show, I can see why it's run so long. The first seasons are a bit &#34;cheesy&#34;, but only a bit, and they get steadily better as they go. I'm hooked!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Hoorah!  Both seasons together!  If you are not yet a Downton Abbey fan you soon will be after you watch an episode or two.  If you like this time period in history you will like this show!  I was thrilled to find the Christmas special at the end of Season 2 and it really is the ending of Season 2 not just a Christmas special.  Also, the extras are a nice bonus.  The acting and costumes are excellent and it is a story well told !
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is a very enjoyable read it is entertaining, thought provoking, and just a plain good read.  You may not be into everything this book takes you though but it makes you wonder, &#34; is this really happening some where out there?&#34;  Wow!
B009NCM248|5.0|this album is 100% pure awesome. cant wait for part 2 to come out and I shouldnt have waited so long to pick up this one.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love playing this game its fun to do anywhere anytime.<br />I've gotten better at strategizing and everybody aka what<br />do you do to get so good and I just say playing games
0920668372|5.0|everyone knows this book and is perfect for a child to add to their collection. i had it as a kid..
B00005AR3G|5.0|This is another movie I been searching for, for a while! Glad I found it and the shipping was quick and it was in perfect condition.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|When I first began watching this series I thought boring Žzzzzz.<br />Then as I continued watching the better it became. How I can enjoy it and Homeland remains a puzzle.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I just started this years with season three and I am hooked!  I went back and purchased season 1&2 - over the course of one weekend, Friday-Sunday, I watched them all - I will never miss another episode!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|if you like temple run get this its a lot better. you can buy characters to run and jump on trains. It is awesome!
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|As much as I loved Monte Carlo, this movie was better.  You are entertained with more backstory of the old days of MI-6, decisions made by &#34;M&#34; that come back to haunt her and Bond, and even a nice easter egg with the introduction of Moneypenny!<br /><br />The high-tech is a bit over the top at times, but if you can suspend reality on that it is a very enjoyable Bond that relies on the old school over the latest in traditional Bond gadgetry.<br /><br />Rent it or buy it and enjoy!
0380725398|5.0|This author has written many books set in Cornwall, the south west corner of England.  As with her other successful novels, Jamaica Inn captures the environment at that time of secrets and smuggling as well as evoking the beauty of the Cornish landscape.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|I LOVE this game sooo much. has so many more great features and the image is GREAT. I have so much fun with this one compared to the first one! I highly suggest who ever is reading this review to get it!!!!
B0088W4YTK|5.0|My boys love this show they watch it over and over again!!  Good vs Evil, Lots of Action, Good Plot, very engaging!! It is too bad this show only has 5 seasons!!
B00AEFYVUQ|5.0|Simply replacing my VHS version at long last.  This is one of those movies you will enjoy over and over again if you enjoy Woody Allen's ridiculous performances as a non-confident, worrying, basket case character.  He is at his best in this movie.  Diane Keaton is wonderful too and how she can continue to befriend this incompetent goof (Woody) is<br />a real test of patience and show of true love for a not so perfect friend.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Well written, suspenseful, leaves you pondering the story after it has ended. Not sure I actually liked any of the characters, but was very intrigued by their story.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless is such a gritty, suspenseful, funny, heart-wrenching, emotional....ride. I could not put this book down. Definitely an eye-opening, must read.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Simple, sleek, lightweight, sturdy! Replaced cu mbersome cover and this is superior! Right price. Marware makes it sensible. Try it!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Easy read; great story line however some of the dialogue was a bit hokey.  The ending really wraps things up and has a little unexpected touching moment. I am a big Nicholas Sparks fan and this one was a nice added addition to his ever enticing array of novels.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is one of the best solitaire games I have found.  I play it for hours,  the game goes so quickly.
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|Can't say enough, the action is fast paced, excellently crafted and exquisitely drawn out to make one hesitant to take a break in reading for fear of losing track of the plot. Tears are a necessary part for the reader as HONOR has to make life and death decisions affecting her friends and staff, yet fulfill her mission. Excellent reading
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I just discovered Downton Abbey and have now watched all episodes through Season 3.  It has a wonderful cast and the story keeps you guessing from one episode to another.  I hope this series continues for a long time.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Easy read. Twists and turns.  Some things were just too unbelievable.  Had high expectations.  Was a little disappointed by the end.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I enjoyed this story.  I have been a Harlequin fan for over 35 years, and this was one of the good ones.
B009LT1YZ6|4.0|The design is great and the object of the game even better as each level is different from another. Some levels are just to raise your health, others to capture rings and some even more different.<br /><br />There are two modes to play and both are just as good. The shadow fish is a great addition to make it more challenging and I like how more and more show up on arcade mode.<br /><br />The controls need a bit of work still but they at least give us three options on how to make them work. Even with the three options it could use a slighty bit of work but overall it is a great game that is worth the 99&cent; and perhaps even a little more.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|I enjoyed the movie and the music immensely, but this is the typical &#34;reproduction&#34; of the songs in the movie, NOT the actual soundtrack that when you listen to it you can clearly imagine the actors movements/facial expressions, etc.  I was dissappointed.
0393343405|4.0|Stephen Greenblatt’s ‘The Swerve’ is built upon a fascinating premise and, for over half of its length, it weaves a historical detective story that incorporates threads from the origins of libraries, the value of penmanship, the means by which books were copied and distributed and many others in a tapestry that propels the reader toward the finish line. Unfortunately, the book loses much of its steam after the tale of the discovery and the fate of the discoverer is effectively ended.<br /><br />Poggio Bracciolini was a fascinating character taken on his own merits as depicted by Greenblatt. A lowly scribe from rural Italian origins that rose to prominence as papal secretary only to descend into direr straits of unemployment and financial hardship in the wake of his deposed employer, Poggio rose once again late in life and eventually achieved some degree of domestic, financial and professional security. He was a shrewd closeted humanist book hunter in a rabidly dogmatic Christian theocracy and he had to move very carefully to avoid the appearance of biting the hand that fed him. His own saga could potentially become the stuff of compelling cinema.<br /><br />In the 1400’s, book hunters were archaeologists, uncovering clues to a past through rumors of remnants that were the only signs that certain notable philosophers of Roman and Greek antiquity ever existed. His major discovery was a copy of the philosophical poem “On the Nature of Things” by Roman philosopher Lucretius. The poem depicts an atomistic view of the universe. Everyone and everything is composed of these atoms. There is no intelligent design and if these constantly moving atoms were to proceed in straight forward motion nothing would ever exist or change. However, the atoms yield to a slight swerve, resulting in collision with other atoms and a chain reaction of causes and effects. Viewed from the 21st century in a post-Einstein world in which theories of quantum physics are tossed about daily this does not seem terribly revolutionary. However, in a world ruled by the Vatican this is highly blasphemous bile and the tale of how Lucretius’ work found its way out of obscurity into the light of day through a series of historical ‘swerves’ is where Greenblatt’s tale possesses its greatest power.<br /><br />While one is caught in the narrative tide of Greenblatt’s tale, what he says is entirely convincing. Upon reflection after finishing, however, I for one detect oversimplification for the sake of a compelling story. I don’t doubt that “On the Nature of Things” has exerted influence on many throughout history, themselves significant figures (Shakespeare, Montaigne, Galileo, Jefferson, Darwin, Einstein). However, I think it a bit of a stretch to claim that this one work started a chain reaction of thought that transformed Western Civilization from a world of blind adherents to a superstitious Christian theocracy to a society of free thinking humanists. It would be more accurate to say that it was one of many texts that slowly insinuated themselves into the fiber of minds that couldn’t help but question the most obvious absurdities of Christian theology in spite of the compulsion to ‘’toe the party line.’<br /><br />Greenblatt’s book is not a tremendously long tome. It would be even shorter if he had concluded it after he finished Poggio’s tale and his description of what Poggio actually discovered. However, he has structured his book like a ghost story in which a family legend unfolds as a curse is passed from one occupant to the next of the haunted mansion. In this way, he overstates his case. “On the Nature of Things” has a life of its own and it will not be extinguished by any papal authority or fundamentalist censor, according to Greenblatt. I suppose that the fact that Greenblatt’s book resided on the New York Times bestseller list and won a Pulitzer Prize could be taken as evidence that Lucretius’ poem DOES have a life of its own, at least the life that Greenblatt has given it by shining his scholar’s flashlight upon it.
B00B3MN65K|5.0|Positively sublime!  His smooth rich tones sink to the heart of the listener.  I put on auto-repeat so that it plays all day.....i die....ahhhh
B008FYZIVY|5.0|love the majority of things that the british do. enjoyed the fact that the help played an important part of this show and couldn't believe how angry i felt toward 3 of the characters.  they played their roles to perfection as did all others. loved the storylines  and i'm now anxiously waiting for the 3rd season to come out on disc.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think the game is very good and it is very interesting and it is a good game to play if you want a challenge
B00AG6Z92C|3.0|I love Bocelli's albums, but I can not understand some of Foster's choices for this one. First, there are many Latin American or Spanish singers out there with a better voice and more prestige than J Lo. Don't take me wrong, she is good in what she usually does (for instance with Pitbull), but I still don't grasp the idea of her singing along with such a great star as Andrea. They're worlds appart. So, I just understand this as a try to make the album more comercial and to reach latino and young audiences. Also, regarding the songs in portuguese, I would have chosen something different instead of \\"Tristeza\\" or \\"The Girl from Ipanema\\". Again, don't take me wrong, they're great songs, but in another context. IMHO they broke the tone of the album.<br /><br />I also feel Andrea's voice not being used at its full potential like in other albums.<br /><br />Good album in general terms, but I still prefer Amore. I just hope that the live version will be better.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Husband started this series and he is not a big reader but he could not put it down.  His continuous reading made me start to read and needless to say neither one of us stopped until the end!!!!
B0013G2VBQ|5.0|Classic album. Love hate love is one of my favorite aic songs. You wont be disappointed with this album. Second to dirt still though
0380789035|5.0|If Neil Gaiman wrote it, it's probably excellent.  This was lots of fun, though I liked Neverwhere even more because it is my mind of thing.  If you like one of his books, you'll probably like any of this books!
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Amazing album. You need both of his albums... I can't wait until he comes out with more! Buy it, you won't regret it!
B004GTLFNW|1.0|After the author is done patting himself in the back, he gives your all types of bodyweight exercises. Also of these you can find with one Google search.

B004HUE57S|5.0|I was having wrist pain due to working all day on a computer. I got a wrist pad a first, helped a little. Then I ordered this mouse and WOW! It took maybe a week to get used to it... then a month later, ALL my wrist pain was completely gone. Because this works like a regular mouse, you don't have to change much. It still moves like a typical mouse (so no ball or joystick). The buttons are programmable, so you can set them however you like. So many people at my office have come to see my mouse lol. $80 might seem steep, but if you have wrist pain, its worth every penny.
B004GYY714|4.0|The program is easy to use far ranging, LOVE to listen at night before turning out the lights. Could use more local stations. The Prairie Home Companion episodes are one of my favorites but very LOW volume, hard to hear.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Best book ever<br />It was really really good<br />Hope to read the other ones too and I know I will
B00A5052YE|5.0|I have been a fan of Ms Keys since she first came out. This CD does not dissappoint. Love her!
B005LLSZNM|5.0|same as the 2nd season all seasons are great. i'm nearing the end of season 5 and i hope there is more
B00B9366VO|5.0|Great interviews and behind-the-scenes peeks.  Love Dave Grohl.  He's so passionate about music and it shows in this movie.  It's very well done and interesting.  Can't wait for the soundtrack to come out.
B000GCFX3Q|5.0|This is the first one of her books I have ever read.  It was a good read and went quickly.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|i think this is a great game. it makes you think a is fun to play. my grandkid's love it too!
B008673ZAQ|2.0|But, I still can't stomach her at all. Gideon is by far the only reason I even bother to continue reading this series. That's pretty sad.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Not as good at the 50 shades serieis.  But for what it is it kept my attention.  The characters in her books seem a bit more mature than 50 shades, but not near the &#34;what's going to happen next&#34; thing going on.
B003M70O5O|5.0|i think that all of the seasons are great.i can't stop watching them. it's like a soap opera, you can't wait to see the next turn in events.
B00APJLX8E|5.0|This was the best animated movie I've seen in quite some time! It was simply hilarious and entertained the entire movie.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Every little girl dreams of owning a horse.  Perfect for my 3 year old, she has a pet she can learn responsibility from.  I read the directions and we have a great time together.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It is a refreshing change from the average si-fi book.<br />Well written. And the price 99 cents was right.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite Ben Stillar movies!  He is completely dippy and hillarous at the same time!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|If you like animals then you should get this app it is the best app with the real experience get this app
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|While it was very long, almost 3 hours, I enjoyed it. Themes of class struggle, terrorism, and personal responsibility are all part of this action packed movie. A few of the fight scenes could have been shortened, I thought, but ultimately, it was a very interesting movie that kept my attention. I would watch this one again.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My sister has been asking if I had seen the show (past two seasons) but I had not.  She downloaded it (Seasons 1 and 2) onto my Kindle and while on medical leave from my job, I sat and watching each episode for over a week and then caught up to where it was in Season 3.  Hooked, really hooked.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|After loosing my original Kindle cord for months, I was thrilled when this made it to my door. Would definitely recommend buying straight from Amazon Digital Services over some random company in China.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This is a great sequel to the original, I love the graphics and the all the new features. This is a must have if you enjoyed the first Temple Run.
1451648537|2.0|The style it is written is not engaging. No new insights its like reading a diary or a ships log of events. Wouldnt recommend it.
B004R1Q2EG|4.0|This book changed my view of how I think.  It made wonderful sense.  Our decision making is a lot more complex than I imagined, and rational decision making a lot harder than most of us probably believe.
B007ZTLLMK|3.0|I played this once but it simply didn't hold my interest. It has some challenging aspects, but the game play is relatively simple and uninspiring.<br /><br />There are no momentum effects, no crashes, and the controls lack any connection to realism. Aside from that, it is a decent time-attack style game to see how quickly one can accomplish various flight tasks. Ok for kids probably, but it left me wanting something more.
076790592X|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book along with some other books by the same author.  I would recommend his books.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|the app works great for the most part, but I cant stand that while you are trying to type it's trying to tag someone with every other word. This wouldn't be a problem normally (it isn't on the mobile app!) but it will start trying to tag someone and if I don't select the person to tag it deletes the word you just typed and replaces is with a period! I'll sometimes have to type out the same word 3 or 4 times before it decides it's not going to delete it. I cant even use the stupid app without wanting to throw my kindle at the wall. Such a shame.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|The show is excellent. It is smart and witty and there seems to be a lesson behind each episode. You get to know each character much with every episode. It is also clean, and everyone in the family can watch without inappropriate language or contents.
B001V9LRTM|3.0|This was a blu-ray movie and I didn't see that when I ordered it.  I don't think the blu-ray movies are marked well.  We don't have a blu-ray player so gave them away.
B0076DELIG|4.0|As usual, a good read.  He doesn't disappoint when looking for a good book to read. I will continue to get his books.
B000002H1T|5.0|'Twas 20+ years ago I went to the record store specifically to buy this album.  Couldn't believe my eyes... there were boxes and boxes of it along the walls and in the aisles... like the store expected to sell a TON of them.<br /><br />Though the Cars are not in my all-time fav groups (Alan Parsons and Led Zeppelin... The Cars are on my \\"2nd Fav\\" groups list... along with the Stones and several others), Hearbeat City is in my top TWO favorite albums... the other being The Doors, Strange Days.<br /><br />If you like the Cars even a bit, gotta think you'd love this album.
B001GCUER0|5.0|The shiping of this item was really fast and conditions where very good as well. Also de price is worth absolutely!!
B006RXQ3GO|5.0|For valentines, my bf and I watched this &#62;&#60; but it is long distance, so we screen share on skype and he listens through my laptops speakers. This movie is hilarious and had me squealing the whole time, and even my bf got a lot of giggles from it xD (It was his first time seeing it, and I will rewatch this dozen more times to come. :D LOVE IT!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I am turning!  Yep, into a zombie-lover.  My son turned me on to this show and from that first show I have been addicted.  I have watched the shows on Netflix until season 3.  I could not wait until Netflix loaded them- so I purchased them from Amazon.  Thanks!
B0058YPG1G|5.0|The shiping of this item was really fast and conditions where very good as well. Also de price is worth absolutely!!
B007M45PMU|5.0|The Lumineers have an instrumental sound that is appriciated!  Real music with real, raw, voices.  Refreshing when most music is canned sounds and hooks that loop.  First band in 15 years that I have liked every track on their cd.
1846144132|5.0|One of my favorite books in a long time.<br />Obviouslly, well researched and well written.<br />The British Museum has done a great job.
B000031XBQ|5.0|The ítem was a very convenient for the prince abd the shiping was very fast and eficient, Good ítem conditions!
B00APUYWYA|3.0|The singing is great but the story line is just filler.  A bit predictable.  Good light entertainment but don't expect too much.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|A fast reading story that incorporates the Victorian custom of giving a meaning to every flower with a coming of age story.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|The shiping of this item was really fast and conditions where very good as well. Also de price is worth absolutely!!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|this game is fun but now it will not let me play the stinking game anymore. why the heck won't it let me play the stupid game.
B009NYF612|3.0|This moive is so 80'S I like it. Big hair leg warmersvery cheezy plot lots of T&A very hot chicks!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I enjoyed it very much and learned a lot about the way the WW 2 effected the local populations of the countries involved.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|The answer, if Hopeless is anything to go by, is VERY. Oh yes, you can make a book so boring that the reader would prefer to write 3 thousand word university assignments.
B008MR1PDE|4.0|20120220WE~Review of goneMAD Music Player (gmmp).<br />Make no mistake this is a seriously excellent product from an audio-geek-programmer that is setting a higher standard for audio on the Droid OS. I first downloaded from Google, but had to uninstall and re-download the Trial version in order to buy the license from Amazon. This week I upgraded my sdCard and the the 'unlocker' disappeared.  goneMAD support was terrific and the problem was not theirs' but probably mine, or a conflict between the two two companys' licenses. Anyhow, Amazon graciously took care of it.<br />I repurchased the software, uninstalled the older trial version and now everything is back working great. Thanks Amazon and goneMAD. Great support from both of them. Try the demo. It works well out of the box, but if you want to customize anything the options are waiting for you. This is the best little piece of software I ever bought for the money. The audio features are equivalent to applications costing $30-$50 or more. I haven't seen a list, but it plays a lot of different file formats, and that's a very good thing!!! goneMAD has been suffling around thru my library playing tracks while I wrote this personal review. ciao, from opus at starlitedance dot org.<br />p.s. My droid is a Sprint LG-LS840 Viper with an HD-32GB sdCard.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is absolutely a great game, entertaining, addicting, and grossing could play this for hours yup yup yup yup yup yup yup yup
0062082353|5.0|A wonderful summary of the service of a<br />man who truly believed that America is<br />&#34;Worth&#34; the sacrifice. His death is a tragedy<br />to all Americans. I feel as though I lost a<br />GREAT friend.
B003G4W49C|3.0|I would have enjoyed this book better if I'd read it in my teens.<br />I found the story quite simple, even boring at times, but kept reading beacuse this book is such a classic. Was pleasantly surprised with the spin at the end, which's what made the book worth the reading.<br />I'd recommend if you want to know the classics of SF, or if you just want the casual read.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Loved this book.  Was a referral to me.  Enjoyed the characters and got involved with their joys as well as their heartaches.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|The closest thing to good headphones I've ever had in the past were low-end Sennheiser noise-cancelling headphones. Switching to these headphones has made music and entertainment so much more enjoyable, and I mean MUCH more. They were recommended to me by a friend because of the quality design and low price. This was definitely a good starting point for me, as beginner/wannabe audiophile. I also have a headphone amp which improves them further.
0671578278|5.0|The bug scene had me rolling on the floor. Book was as described and came when it was supposed to.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Is awesome!!! must have to all horse lover's! but I don't like how they let you buy coins, if they didn't the game would be soooo much faster, and a lot more fun.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|David has a knack for developing interesting characters and situations.  Story flowed well and kept me guessing for the whole book.  Very interesting twists and turns in the plots and subplots which finally come together nicely.  Great read and fine author.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|so far so fun! haven't been playing long but enjoying this game so far. can't wait to play again soon
B008AK8FHM|5.0|the journey to heaven was such a long, arduous one for this man.  giving hope for the rest of us is good, but having the negative in our lives in review, if that is what we are facing, gives me trepidation.
B008XG1X18|1.0|I downloaded this to see a picture but found i did not really need to. Dumped the app. I have no use for it. As it is facbook is becoming a joke too and may dump that too
B00942G4UA|5.0|Definitely a wake up call. I'm from Europe and things are different, more local stuff in every day life. Had no idea it could be like this anywhere. Since I live in US now, I'm glad I have the information and can make my own, now better, decisions. Thank you for putting all this together.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|But what depth of feeling (Rolling in the Deep), and passion (Set the Rain on Fire).<br /><br />She puts to words all the range of emotions and feelings that anyone in love that has been wronged or cheated on experience.<br /><br />Wisdom and eloquence beyond her years.  Truly a complex individual.  I wish her well in her quest for true love.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Denzel Washington should get an Oscar for his performance in this great movie! I would have given this movie five stars if it wasen't for the nudity in the beginning. My adult son said there had to be nudity there to set up the story.  I guess I'm just old fashioned with old fashion values but I thought the same scene could have set up the movie just as well if she were wearing a bra and some kind of panties.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|Ordered for my Ipad as a fallback when I need something to read...ordered after I watched a marathon of Shogun mini-series on cable and was reminded of how much I love the novel...the mini-series was great, top-notch production, but still left out so much nuance of the novel...better than Tai Pan and the 3rd novel in the series maybe because I love reading about the samurai era so much...<br />Wish they would do an e-book for another favorite book about Japan--Miss One Thousand Spring Blossoms--about 1960s more modern Japan...another revelation...
B0018QOIXU|5.0|Nice mix of break-out themes.  I like the album to be sure, but 21 is the stuff gold is made of.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Like the X-Files 10 years later with better effects. Very entertaining and FREE with Amazon Prime OMG 5 seasons 20 episodes a season do the math. Oh yes Anna Torv is as hot as Gillian Anderson was. Yum.
B0042J6VUS|5.0|the tripod was super cheap and it worked like a champ fast shiping to i would buy again once it breaks
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|The hint takes a long time to charge. The sound effects are cool. Wish you could zoom in more. not a bad game
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|The plot twists are typical Clancy, with the good guys always winning, but enough relity thrown in to hook you to the end. Eerie how close to today's geopolitical issues Clancy hits.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book has it all. Romance, action, adventure... it is a real page turner. You will love this book! Amazing!
B000UR9T8C|5.0|We both loved the movie. I bought this as a gift for my husband and it came quickly and as advertised!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Lee Child as a new fan. I have never read his work, and the trailer for the Jack Reacher movie made me look into the books. Almost Robert Ludlum style writing, with good character development, plot and believable story lines have me hooked.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This collection allowed me to replace two of my movies on VHS AND help some of my younger family members to fill-in the holes in their movie collections.  The quality is great!
B008PQ8XZK|5.0|From the beginning this books holds its reader. I could not wait to turn the pages to see what happened. Unlike a lot of books it had a beginning middle and end and was so disappointed when it was finished. More please Ms Morton.
B004G5Z0B4|1.0|I didn't realize that when I purchasred it I wouldn't be able to play it as it is from the UK and not compatible with my dvd player
B009IEXKXI|4.0|A celebration of seat-of-the-pants engineering and adaptation to the unexpected, all motivated by survival instinct- couldn't put it down!  A story of lone survival on an inhospitable planet-  transportive!
B0093H8HXS|5.0|This processor for this price is an amazing deal.  I am playing games and using graphic software with ease with this upgrade.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved the first book. CertIfied is also a Very good book. Easy to read and keeps your attention very well. Looking forward to book 3!
B00999DFP0|5.0|These are great anyone who loves the show will love these can't wait for season 6 to come out so I can buy that one two
B003G4W49C|4.0|Excellent commentary on war & the ridiculous lengths countries go to in the name of self-defense.  Couldn't put it down.
B008476HBM|3.0|Okay, I'll admit that at 14 y o and interested in modern biographies and war stories, Pride & Prejudice bored me stupid.<br /><br />Re-reading it now (from a sense of obligation) I actually can see the humour in it, the easy development of characters and their relationships and interactions.<br />I can now identify characters to loathe (the girls' mother) and which I can like.<br /><br />But I guess it will never be more than a tedious &#34;okay&#34;, I guess.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|My two favorite songs are Me and Mrs Jones & Lost, so sexy and there is melancholic on his voice
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|Why do author's feel compelled to kill off or &#34;retire&#34; their most intriguing characters?  Agent Pendergast deserved love and happiness for a finale.  Hard to believe that a series that has captured my attention and been so pleasurable for years has come to an end.  You were one of a kind.  Thank you.
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|This was a gift for my daughter's birthday and she loves it.  She is a huge Monster High Fan and was excited to get this.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|I love his voice and it's soothing and very romantic, and I like most of the choice of his songs
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I got it from UPS right away I opened it and started to sharpen my knifes after reading the instuctions. Everything on it works good and im very please how it turned out.
B007ZTLLMK|2.0|The game play is not smooth, one feels lost to figure out what exactly to do....not guides or hints on screen.
B000088E6D|5.0|As usual, his voice is so smooth and calm, and the price of the CD is so cheap, can't beat the price
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Although I was assigned this book, I do not regret reading it. The dialogue of death along with the innocence  of childhood was indeed deserving of at least four stars. There  is no other way a person can experience the wonders of childhood, the pain that life brings, and the reward of a life accomplished by reading anything else. The Book Thief will steal your heart!
B0086700CM|4.0|Great fun....and really addictive. Nice graphics and smooth game play. This works great on my Nexus 4 and 10 - liking it so far!
B009FZFONO|5.0|Amazon streaming service along with Season 3 of the Walking Dead doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />I have streamed the series to different appliances in my house including an iPad 4 and it always works flawlessly.
B00007KLJJ|5.0|I enjoy this movie every time I watch it. And, I'll plan to watch it several more times! Recommended to all!
B000I9W08I|5.0|The story line was well written.  The songs and dancing are outstanding.  The actors did an excellent job.  Overall, I would rate this musical as my favorite.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was the first book I ever read by Nicholas Sparks and I adored it. I put this in my future re-read pile!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very easy to use. Love the large numbers. Fits my kindle screen perfectly.  I am not elderly but this would be excellent for an elderly person.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|It is a great family movie without anything in it that make moms cringe such as bad words or etc&#62;&#62;&#62;
1936608898|5.0|I cannot recommend this book enough! Whole30 IS the foundation for great health! Even if you've been &#34;Paleo&#34; for a while (like me) you will benefit greatly by completing the entire book. I thought I knew it all...so I put the book down (half way through). Biggest mistake ever! When I went back to finish it, I found myself *FACE PALMING* time and time again! Buy it! Read it! Take on the world! Enjoy! :)
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|i usually just get my music from ......well, best to not incriminate myself.  suffice to say, i'm the reason jay-z ain't rollin' on dubs anymore.  this album was so good, i had to go and buy it, just to keep the band supported and making music.  original and awesome, that's these guys.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|if you have seen the other total recal you don;t need to watch this one, not sure why they copied the original
B0078N2T8I|5.0|Great movie. Keeps you on the edge of your seat. Definitely a bit frightening. Have been recommending to everyone I know.
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|I think that Lana del Rey is somewhat pretentious, but the songs on this album are very mellow and soothing.  I enjoy listening to this album when working on something or when I'm feeling uptight (it's calming).  Would definitely recommend to others.
B001F0WXY0|5.0|As one who has endured a long series of TIA mini-strokes disassembling my brain, I feared I would never read a book again. I could no longer track the printed text without loosing my place. After stumbling around in this state for a few years I discovered that by changing print size and background (as with Kindle) combined with either a good text reader like &#34;Ginger It&#34; or a actor read &#34;Audible Book&#34; I was able to bridge this disability.  The final piece of the puzzle for me was a good pair of Sound suppression stereo headphones. I suggest &#34;Bose.&#34;<br /><br />This is  probably not the review you expected, but I write it thinking there could well be other people with special needs looking for answers.
B00846F1YW|5.0|Could use a little less conversion, and more searching from room to room for my taste. However as a find the object only game it is good. I played this on my Kindle Fire.
B001661RC2|5.0|I can listen to this album from end to end, over and over and not get tired of it.  Amazing blues-y rock!
B003UBTX6S|3.0|I liked this book even better than the first. I can't wait to see what book three has in store
B005GIS1WA|4.0|Grandchildren really enjoyed it, all the colorful birds! Was a cute movie, Was well worth the price I paid for it.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I love British programs, and was not dissapointed  with this wonderful story of time passed.  The characters are down to earth and very enjoyable.
B004JN1D2I|3.0|I enjoyed this bundle. I felt like it had a good premise for a story, but I also feel that it may be too long in the telling of it in some aspects. I'm starting the 5th book (not in this bundle) and have found my enthusiasm has waned considerably knowing that it is a thousand (kindle) pages long and ends nowhere near the end of the tale.
B006QQQ5SI|5.0|It was a very  funny movie with a lot of great actors. Love it! Love it! Love it! I normally don't buy movies
031603438X|5.0|I GAVE THIS BOOK AS A GIFT, THEY LIKED IT VERY MUCH. I TRIED READING IT TOO, NOT MY KIND OF BOOK.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|I love playing this game on my kindle hd.  I had this game for a couple of weeks, it's a chagllenge to not hit the bombs. My granddaughter is 6 years old and love slicing the fruits.
0812993292|5.0|I rarely recommended books to my friends but this one has become my number one recommendation.<br />It's a gentle novel of a pilgrimage but it's not just a story of a walk from the south to the north of England.  Yes, the descriptions of the countryside, the mornings, the nights are beautiful, but it also explores relationships, spirit, joy, despair and so much more.  I laughed and cried as I read this wonderful, wonderful story.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I found this book to be well worth the investment of both money and time to read. I won't write more about what is in the book but remark upon one thing; the truth is we can do no wrong, but some of us shouldn't know that here as it gives license to create unnecessary pain when we should do the opposite, remove as much unnecessary pain in life as we can, give as much love as we can, help where we can.<br /><br />We can do no wrong but do as much good as you can.<br /><br />Christopher
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think the game is great takes some getting used to great graphics and sound reminds me of angry than run
B007ADIRDM|5.0|My daughter loves this set and all of the pieces are really amazing - very detailed and perfect - we love it!
B003U53GK8|5.0|The Lost series ended strong, with lots of action and a few interesting twists.  If you're at all a fan of the show, it's worth a look.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham is always a great read.  I am enjoying this book very much.  Can hardly wait to finish it, but I always hate to leave the characters behind when I am done.
B009X01D9U|5.0|I take my kindle everywhere and this case easily fits to my purse.  It's durable, has a great color selection, and easy to use (either vertical or horizontal). The only minus to this is how much pressure I had to put on it to get it to snap into the case- the weak wrist individuals like myself may need help.
B009PJ1Q82|5.0|It's hard to imagine a more true or compelling look at the complexities of love than \\"Keep the Lights On.\\"  I have admired this filmmakers previous work, but I think he's hit his stride with this latest piece.  Many of the images in this film stayed with me for weeks after seeing it.  The critics were right about this one...it's great.
B004SBX112|5.0|My grand kids LOVE angry birds!! That's all they play on their Nabi. Purchase Star Wars version too and Rio..
B007EECSFA|4.0|I liked the book but it was a wee bit unbelievable.  It was my first Kate Morton book and I intend to read more of her books.
0345803485|1.0|Bought this as 'porn for the wife' in an effort to rekindle something ... anything ... in our relationship. What an utter and complete miserable failure of a product. She read the whole thing and ... nothing. Totally did not induce the desired effect. Would give zero stars if possible.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book so much and the fact that i could buy it from amazon for only five dollars!!!!! Best book ever, i also love the whole series, which a read a long time ago, but just needed to read again!
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|...Amazing for the physics of aeronautics crowd.<br />Damned jack screws have cost more lives and careers than we can count.<br />&#34;Flight&#34; needs a sequel: &#34;Design.&#34;
B00000IUT7|5.0|First, please be aware this is a toy. It's not a real stem locomotive. I say that because I've seen reviews for this complaining about power. Excuse me, but I've seen this engine pull 10 Brio cars UP and incline. Did it go slow? Yah, duh. But it did it. I have not found a better electric engine. Forget push-trains. Get this.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Just as good if not better than the first. Gotta start book 3, NOW!!!  Just read 'em!!!! You won't regret it!!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|the costumes and setting are beautiful and the story line is addicting. can't wait to watch season 3. no complaints at all.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Good Story. The author keeps you guessing and in suspense. I liked the location of West Virginia as I spent some time<br />in the state and in the mines. I was able to relate to the location and some of the characters. Maybe that's why I like<br />the story so much or maybe it is just  because it is a great novel.
B00A31UXLW|4.0|Gripping.<br />A story that gripped me and I could not put it down Michael weaves a magic tail that holds one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great Fun for everyone you'll love this game! It's fast paced and its like temple run but actually a bit more fun! You will love this game
B006LSZECO|5.0|Real page turner.  Couldn't put it down!  Recommend it highly.  Best book I've read in a long time.  I hope this is made into a movie.  Love to see this on the big screen!!
B001AG52AG|5.0|It is a fantasy adventure. I like the movie and it doesn't cost too much to rent such a good movie like the Golden Compass.
B00AYDC5HY|4.0|Remembering the short flick of the same name from years ago, I was pleased to see the movie. It was very entertaining.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Need I say more?  well...since I have a word requirement (way to go Barnes & Noble)...watch it, you'll love it, too.
B00001OH7T|4.0|This is a good album, but not his best from the 70s. &#34;Somebody Up There Likes Me&#34; is an excellent song with an interesting chord structure. &#34;Fame&#34; of course is one of his all-time best songs ever. Everything else on the album except the title track is nothing special or memorable.
B000IDGDPA|5.0|Layered, multifaceted and colorful.  A movie for men more than women.  That little secret which they will enjoy and keep like how many episodes of the Golden Girls they've watched by themselves in the middle of the night.
B004OYDVT0|5.0|Sales figures don't lie and this is a classic, timeless album that has stood (and will continue to stand) the test of time. Adele is a pro at such a young age and the songs are very rich emotionally.  I like nearly every song on the album including the Cure cover &#34;Lovesong.&#34; The bonus CD has nothing remarkable on it though...
B007WFQZI2|5.0|Excelente, supremo, altamente recomendable. Un disco que con el tiempo será de culto en la rica discografía de Kreator.<br /><br />5 estrellas para Kreator.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was a great book I liked  it because it was very funny I recommend this book if you like funny books
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is 1 of my favorite books i have ever read i would highly recommend this book. This book was fun and on edge and every emotion mixed together.

B00AFEY354|5.0|Perks of Being a Wallflower is without a doubt the best movie about high school life since Hughes's &#34;The Breakfast Club&#34; in 1982, and I am certain that it will soon gain a similar place in moviegoers' hearts to the iconic status &#34;Breakfast Club&#34; has since accomplished.  The key to the heart of Perks is that of every good teen movie: it's not just for kids, and it never underestimates the power and relevancy of the struggles of young people.  I'm poised to graduate high school this year, and I can't number the moments during the movie when I felt that I knew exactly what the characters were talking about, and truly understood the emotions they experience.  Like Hughes before him, Chbosky doesn't condescend to or dimish his characters because of their age.  Giving Chbosky the opportunity to write and direct the movie based on his brilliant book was a stroke of genius on Summit's part.  The spirit of the book is preserved and elaborated upon in this movie (and fans of the book, like myself, will find extra surprises in the deleted scenes).  In a way, the movie even felt more emotional to me than the book, especially the plot aspects revolving around Charlie's backstory.  The visual aspect of the movie expands the book's sentiment and impact greatly, especially with the stellar cast.  Not a single person in the movie is even close to being miscast.  The three that stand out in my mind are the leads: Logan Lerman as Charlie, Emma Watson as Sam, and Ezra Miller as Patrick.  The entire cast, but those three especially, are brilliant at bringing subtlety to their performances.  Nothing in this movie is overstated or exaggerated, but by its end we care incredibly for its characters.  The last portion of the movie is especially heartrending and places great demands on Lerman as an actor, but he delivers stellarly.  Tying Charlie's high school experiences back to his personal life made the film's narrative transcendent and pushed it to a level of emotion rarelyequaled in movies I've seen.
B005DNPKSQ|4.0|Spectacular production with two great stars.  Did drag a might in plot development, but held together as an idea we all have experienced, knowing only the world from an internal perception, we find it easy to imagine the world centers around the observer we can trust the most, ourself.  This one teaches us to reach to know others feel.
B005USZYDU|5.0|I loved this book such a shocking switch at the end. I can't wait to read the next one keep it coming
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I totally enjoyed  this book.  I am not currently  a dog  owner but loved everything about this book.  The worst thing is that it had to end.  Was not sure about reading a book from a dog's point of view but it was very thought provoking.  I will always be wondering what they are thinking or trying to tell me. Now I understand a true animal lover. Highly recommend and will be looking for more animal books in the future.
B008220C38|3.0|The review first appeared on the [...]    I've read Tolstoy's Anna Karenina twice, first when I was 12--precocious, no?  And again a few years ago.  I'm not sure it is my favorite story --tragic ending and so forth.  But that did not deter me from looking forward to seeing Director Joe Wright and playwright Tom Stoppard's adaption of Anna Karenina.    First, a shout out to the actors, in particular Jude Law as the wronged, self-righteous prig of a husband Alexei Karenin,  Mathew Macfayden (who I would like in anything, it's true) as Anna's adulterous but loyal brother Stiva Oblonsky and Domhnall Gleeson as Constantin Levin, the moral heart and soul of the piece.  Keira Knightley also did a fine job, though something she does with her neck make her head bob forward and back in an unsightly fashion.  That said, it is hard for Ms. Knightley to be unsightly--she is quite beautiful as Anna.    More good news--The costumes designed by Jacqueline Duran are to-die-for gorgeous, luscious ball gowns, dramatic hats (with veils, so cool).  No wonder she is nominated for an Oscar.  I definitely  fancy myself in a Russian fur coat and hat (fake of course)  after seeing multiple versions on Keira Knightley.  Dario Marinell's Oscar-nominated musical score is beautiful and haunting.    But the actual production--the set design--resembles a play in a theatre and, for me, it took away from the story and the acting.  It was odd, and distracting and I wished for a smoother, more traditional approach to filming.  But Sarah Greenwood's production design and Katie Spencer's set decoration are both nominated for Oscar's along with Seamus McGarvey for Cinematography -- so what do I know?    Finally, I concluded I'm not a fan of the actual story line:  lovely, moral housewife content in her hum-drum life gets drawn into adulterous affair with ne'er do well bad boy and loses everything, family, children, reputation and finally the bad boy himself. In despair, she throws herself under a train.No hope, no redemption, certainly no happy ending for Anna.  The only characters with heroic qualities are Levin and Kitty Oblonsky, who find true love despite initial setbacks.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is really fun and awesome, and I love the update with the armor it is awesome. There is only one thing that they should add. They should add a enchantment table. That would be awesome. They could also put a nether portal, but I think the device would explode.
B00B0NDQPC|5.0|She's perfect for this genre and I enjoy listening to this over and over. Highly recommended for all Emmy Rossum fans.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book!!! If you believe in true love,this book is for you!  All women should read this book ! Great job Nicholas Sparks!!!
B004EYT932|5.0|A must read for any private investor. If there is any hope at all left that the powers that be (political and financial) can control or avert disaster, then this book extinguishes that.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|My daughter wanted a horse soI got this game . She loves it wish she just wanted this horse lol
B007FEFLTO|3.0|Since the younger generation knows little about the period 1930-1950, this book is quite valuable in that it delivers information in an entertaining and evenhanded format. The very large number of characters and the &#34;human interest&#34; slant tend to detract from the grand design.
B008Y6TD5A|5.0|This is a film unlike many others in which the jail breakout is for the wife/mother of the main protagonist. Russell Crowe speaks with a voice that does more then rumble up from the pit of his stomach, but comes further down, most likely from his toe nails. The planning that he utilized was excellent without resorting to shooting their way out. He even included his son in the planning that normally would have complicated his plan beyond believability/possibility.<br />A story in which the judicial system utterly failed the convicted wife ( I did not reference it as the justice system). Not only was the story sufficiently different to not be either a sequel, or one in which much of the story was copied, cut and pasted from other sources into a screen story.<br />The cinematography and audio met the high standards that we expect from US movies without giving it a second thought.<br />I would highly recommend it as a film that brings in a different perspective.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great drama show. Was hooked from the beginning. Sad that you have to wait a whole year just to see another season. Kind of risky for marketing purposes. You can risk losing your audience waiting so long for next season. Things happen in life and people forget. I think that was a poor choice on whoever is in charge of that.<br /><br />Great actors and a fantastic story though. You wont be dissapointed.
B00358ESI4|4.0|Very intense depiction of a short segment of the &#34;Vietnam Police Action&#34; (tongue in cheek). It seemed that both sides were not very concerned with their respective death & injury rate. The action was very intense and non stop. While as an action combat movie, it was very well done, we see the horrific injuries during this very short period, but not the aftermath of injuries that essentially destroyed the soldiers ability to function afterwards.<br />I have watched the movie more than once but it is difficult to watch the movie on multiple occasions and, cope with the injuries and diseases, be gung ho in reference to the great good that we were told we were doing and realize that it was for nothing.<br />When I taught my kinder to drive, I emphasized that once they start a turn, not to stop suddenly and end up getting broadsided. Make your determination and follow through period. If the war was truly necessary, then it should have been fought with all the stops pulled out.<br />All in all, it is a very good movie with enough realism to  keep it &#34;Real&#34;.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Even better than the first two seasons; can't wait to see what is in store for both the prison and woodbury.
B008B3F38C|5.0|Hard-core Delain fan! They've never let me down and they didn't this time either. The additional live songs with Marco put the icing on the cake!
B008CPZNL6|1.0|I can get more news and info from FB. Sorry did not like this at all. Maybe a litte bit boring.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|habit forming but great fun.  i can play for hours - it is great for dexterity but mostly fun fun fun
B004T6IBNY|4.0|A great game with sounds and graphics on top. For old school pinballers this is a must have. I give it a big thumbs up.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|This is simply a great CD.  If this is emo, it's emo at its best.  High energy throughout.  Monster hooks.  References to big band, disco, and swing, no less!  Nails for Breakfast has an incredible pure disco beat that could have charted in 1977.  Highly recommended.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|The strength of this book is that it is written by a neurologist with atheistic tendencies until having a very incredible Near Death Experience.  It is an excellent counter argument to the scientific, fact based belief that spirituality and God are just functions of an imaginative brain.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|This is a great movie, but truly PG-13.<br />Interesting concept and fun to watch.<br />We will probably watch it again.
1439175640|4.0|While I lived in NYC I fell in love with this bakery. It's not just their cupcakes they also have an endless array of delectable treats (banana pudding, so yummy). The edge of the book is cut in such a way that makes thumbing to the right page a little annoying. Over all it's a wonderful book! I first ordered the book for my friend and fell so in love that I'm ordering another for me.
B008Y6WPXC|3.0|Pretty weak.  Great explosions, bad dialogue, weak plot.  Did I mention the great explosions?  Then I covered the highlights of this movie.
B0063IH60K|1.0|The pop up adds are so annoying I deleted after just a few plays. I would not recommend this app.
B008133MDK|5.0|Sherlock Holmes is getting a lot of play these days. This is a very entertaining adaption of the super sleuth.
B00B5P37IG|1.0|if you like religious or news channels, this will be for you. nasa is the only regular channel. only good thing is it has other countries tv.
B008D37J6O|3.0|Everything is great except I tried to delete from the program and I cannot delete the things I entered and sometimes made a double and cant delete it.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I do not like the head phone part has this thing you have to unscrew and screw back on every time you want to listen to music.
B002PEP4QY|3.0|A difficult read at best. Very informational but didn't really interes me all that much. It did, however , give some insight to Jim Morrison and the Doors of whom I am a huge fan.
B0086UXYZO|3.0|The second album from &#34;The Vaccines&#34; is a mix bag... It feels that the British lads are trying too hard to keep cashing in from their debut cd...don't get me wrong it is still a good effort with 3 or 4 good songs, but in the end you feel that it could have been way much better. I'll wait for their next album.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Amazing!<br /><br />Relatable for many women and men in the same sense! I watched the movie and bar far, the two did not compare! But Josh Duhmel...yummy! ;)
0131479415|5.0|I must say this book delivers.  What helped me is how the author provided continual examples.  I was able to grasp the majority of the concept because the author did such a great job of explaining things.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|While the game is fun and entertaining, the app crashes quite a bit and requires deletion and installing again thus wiping out any progress only to have repeat again
B003FXCSNQ|3.0|Don't usually read fiction but enjoy the scifi classics and this in no exception. The author doesn't go into detail trying to explain pseudo technology so the storey doesn't feel aged.<br /><br />Didn't see all of the movie due to technical issues but will Deffinately watch it now.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Funny and sad and silly and manic and happy and heavy... sometimes friendships are hard work, but sometimes the friends who are the hardest to keep are the best ones to have.
B000K8EQ5W|4.0|I liked their prior movie &#34;SPEED&#34;  and  liked the romance in this one, but was mystified by the ending,<br />which I was able to replay a couple of times and it never got old,  I can watch Sandra and Keanu  all day.
B0090SI42Y|3.0|Very bloody movie in Tarantino style. Crowe did a great job in the movie he was by far my favorite character.
B008ASGP3U|5.0|When Rebus retired, it felt like his story was finished.  With this book Mr. Rankin has breathed new life into Rebus's story.  He is a marvelous character, and this book adds to the legend.  I look forward to more new chapters.
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|This is a great movie if you enjoy video games, no matter what your age is.  It is full of video game jokes and it makes a wonderful story.
B007REV4YI|5.0|This is one of the best James Bond movies in the collection!! After the last couple of films i didn't know if i would liek this one, but it was great!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I am a photographer so I needed a package for my gear, so this item is great basicly because the price.
B00867GHS8|5.0|This is still one of my all time favorite animated movies.  Even better now that we can watch it at home in 3-D!!!!
B005COO1X6|1.0|Expected more from a writer like King.  He thinks he can sell books just because they have his mane on them.  Way too much vulgarity , way too little of a plot.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|awsome hot series. keep making them. I look forward to watchng  the boys. I would recommend checkin this one out
B009IEXKXI|5.0|A new way to do space travel and Mars probe stories.  Believable as it seems possible to happen in the near future.<br />Could drop some of the vulgarities, but this seems to be vogue.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great season, have not lost a beat since episode one.  Hoping for a season four and many more to follow!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Good idea, well done,  The end is inevitable but he keeps you unsure until the final pages.  Could tell the stoey with less vulgarity.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Homeland intrigues you from the first show, but it gets even better with each episode. Watch one episode and you'll be hooked.
B00846REIS|5.0|I might dare to say that I love the Crossfire series more that the 50 shades Trilogy.  It is very very similiar to 50 shades, but with different turns and twists.  Eva isn't as naive or inexperienced as Ana, and Gideon has a past that could lead to be more brutal than Christian's.  I love love loved Cary in this book, he was a nice addition to the story line.
B0029LCJJS|4.0|This show takes an exciting look at a crucial time in history.  If you can get past the sex scenes, the show does a great job showing this complex time in England.
B007SGM084|5.0|I have read and reread this series 3 or 4 times---I have lost track.  This is the series that got me back into reading.  I enjoyed all three books, I doubt that I would be able to pick out which was my favorite.  The sex scenes are very steamy, but it was the love story and the building of trust that happens between Christian and Ana after his past that really enticed me.
159562015X|5.0|As leadership expert John Maxwell would say, &#34;Leadership is influence, nothing more, nothing less.&#34;  There is no better way to influence people than when you leading from your strengths.  It also allows you to build a great leadership team when you surround yourself with others who have different strengths.  An individual does not have to be well rounded but teams do. This book and the self assessment test you take is a real jewel and I highly recommend it.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I downloaded this book on a whim, not really knowing what to expect, but it had so many good reviews.  It is an emotional roller coaster of a book, but it is so worth it.  I read this after 50 shades and the Crossfire series.  It doesn't have the ridiculous sex scenes, but the romance is there.  I am very excited for the next book to be released.
B007CKNX28|5.0|This is one of the best CDs I've purchased in a long time.  The music is so bluesy an soulful, I love every song.  I first heard him perform at the 2013 Grammy's and now I'm hooked!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved everything about the characters in this book.  The first book was great too, but this book had a lot of different emotions running through it.  The middle-to-end of the book gets kind of frustrating because the reader has no idea what Gideon's intentions are, but by the end his intentions become very clear.
0345803485|5.0|I adore this book, it got a lot of negative publicity when it first came out for being &#34;BDSM&#34; but that isn't even what the entirity of the book is. It has depth!
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|Nice story......Don't pass judgement based on stereotypes. A few scary moments when Dracula gets angry but otherwise the \\"monsters\\" are personable and likable.
0425263916|5.0|I received my order a lot prompter than I expected it was sent it out very fast, no issues at all .
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Astounding, gorgeous interface, and a winner in every way. You will be hooked from the first game of this astoundingly well designed and graphically superior 3D like game play. The designers are to be congratulated :-)
0425263908|5.0|I received my order a lot prompter than I expected it was sent it out very fast, no issues at all .

1594202842|5.0|Forget everything you've read and judge for yourself.  This book is a haunting memoir and a heartfelt story.  Thoroughly enjoyed.
B009NSHZLW|1.0|IT WOULD HANG UP WHEN I TRIED WATCHING A MOVIE. I'M SURE GLAD IT WAS A FREE APP, OR IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A BIG WASTE OF MY MONEY
0765325950|3.0|There was some character drops and loose ends (What happened to all the Aiel, there where 100&#34;s of thousands of them supposedly and very few around to fight the last battle), And Moraine was supposed to be critical in the fight but was barely an ornament among others.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Loved the gentle life lessons, the humor, and the emotions. I missed reading it as soon as I set it down and was reluctant to pick it up again because I didn't want it to end. Simply lovely.
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|I got my Analog Man CD/DVD faster than I thought possible. Then I was really surprised when I played the DVD that came with it, it was great plus I got a free download of the CD that I put on my computer before my order even got here. Thanks Amazon, I have bought a lot of things from you and you never seem to let me down.<br />  shortkut
B00457WZEI|5.0|This is a great book for all youth through adult. The story of Joey presented through his eyes was very unique. I enjoyed sharing his life and intend to look for more books by this author.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|simulators are great and this game is one of the best so many different diseases to use and ways to win its so fun! great mobile app :D
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I thought this book would be more difficult to read - but it is not difficult at all.  It is a 'page turner' and puts one into that time and place to experience the lives of the people involved in the story.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|really cool app works like it says very fast a d easy to use<br />what else can i say thanks
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This game is fun and each level is challenging.  It is fun to keep connecting the little blobs together.  It requires you to think about it but not so much that you get stressed out.  I highly recommend.
B001GCUNYO|5.0|Lots of thoughtful action, great acting, good plot twists. more words more words more words more words very good movie
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Liked the &#34;One - Click&#34; process to order episodes and being able to view them prior to air date was also nice.
B006TF6WAM|3.0|Do I detect an English version of Forrest Gump on the road? I cosy tale of one man walking the length of England to reach a dying woman, an old friend from the past - and thereby keeping her alive. A good book to read and relax with. And it often made me sit with Google Maps open and follow the main character's progress through rural England and the people he meets on the way.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I watched all 3 seasons in one week. I loved every second of it. This is sooooooo good. Wonderful acting, gorgeous outdoor scenery, cool cars and carriages, and the inside of the house is breath taking. I love the clothes, jewelry, and the customs.  It is dramatic, witty, funny, sad, inspiring, educational, and much more. I can't wait for season 4. I wish I had more stars to rate it higher yet.
B004TSXUWY|4.0|As well as being a good story and a kind of whodunnit, the book also makes you think what it would be like to have a memory that only spanned one day. I found that the situation of the characters actually made me look more intensely at the details of my own immediate surroundings. Its unusual the a simple story creates so much introspection
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved this book. Read it all the way through in two days.<br />Can't wait to read another book of his.
B0063GORYU|5.0|great game, Love to play. I hate writing reviews on products, but I do like to play this Spider game
B004X4R49Y|5.0|Brilliant performances. Thoroughly enjoyed this recounting and was impressed with the realism of the actors' portrayals. Would highly recommend to all.
B008FRFN7A|2.0|could not get this to work on my system. I am not real computer savy so not sure if it was the system or operator.
B004Q3SGWG|5.0|If you like James Franco and you like true story movies you will love this. I was just able to add it to my movie collection and i know I will not regret the purchase. Any movie collector should have this in there movie library.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Wonderful show! Gritty and gruesome and compelling. I can watch each episode as many times as I want, right on my computer!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a great way to get the company said it is wrong with get the eternal great drugs gr8 yt? first time great tracksuit the same thing.ok

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Travis oh Travis!! In case you can't figure it out, I love Travis. I'm a huge alpha male fan, and he doesn't disappoint. I've preordered the next installment and am counting the days. ;)
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|While the story is fiction, Clancy makes you think about the scary possibilities of cyber warfare.  He helps you to realize the potential cyber warfare, a real ongoing threat to our country, has to do significant damage.  As usual, a real cliff hanger!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Great game! Addictive and hard to put down.<br />Fun graphics. Wish it was a bit longer though. Still a great g5 game.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Suspenseful funny and cute. This book had me on the edge of my seat. I finished the book within 2-3 days because I just had to know what happened next. Nicholas Sparks....you did it again my friend!
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I LOVE JAMES BOND MOVIES. GREAT ACTION AND ALWAYS GREAT SUSPENCE. WOULD MOST DEFIANTLY RECOMMEND EVERYONE I KNOW TO SEE THIS MOVIE.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|this game is very addicting and pretty fun. the best part is rescuing animals. easy at some times, hard other times.
B007REV4YI|4.0|I loved the movie but this is not about the movie this is about what you get on your blu-ray. First tons of commercials that at least you can skip by hitting next chapter. The &#34;Comming attractions&#34; play every time you load this up. They will probably release a special edition that will not have the commercials. I can still look past this. Here is the real problem. Its only 5.1 DTS Master Audio. This sounds excellent but this is blu-ray and I have a 7.1 system. So my side channels are just idle when blu-ray was made for 7.1. This glaring error is the real reason its 4/5 and not 5/5. Now for the special features. This is the best part. There is one labeled &#34;sneak peak&#34; so I played it. OH ITS THE COMMERCIALS. Trailers for the new die hard, a commercial telling me what blu-ray is and how great it looks. This is probably the reason people pirate movies. The other extra features were commentary and the trailer. Just basic stuff. I paid $20 for this and as much rage as I have because of all the dumb commercials. I am still happy I bought this Blu-ray and I am so lucky to stare at the 20th Centuray Fox logo for 30 seconds every time I pop this in. I hate them but I still love bond. So I am a sap and I will put up with it.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I think the magic puzzle is every usefull  the children and adults I mean like my little brother likes them but one concern about the game I just wish you had better pictures such as: celebrities ,parks,buildings,wallpapers,logos like make it more bouncer so people would like it more:)
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|I liked the characters, Nikki is funny in her own way. The plot was interesting enough to make me keep on reading.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|This was a good Bond film that I enjoyed a bit more than the last 2 that Daniel Craig has been in.  It took a little while to really get going but that seems to be a common trend with these movies.  You do get to see a bit more emotion from the characters and some back story which was a refreshing change.
B007M45PMU|5.0|...As a result, she thinks I'm sensitive and caring and stuff, and was willing to have sexual relations with me. On top of that, I now know the name of that one song is \\"Hey Ho\\" which makes sense because people are yelling \\"Hey Ho\\" in the background the whole time.<br /><br />Will consider buying again the next time I want to have sex with my wife.<br /><br />NOTE: The album will make your wife think you are romantic, but do not yell, \\"Hey Ho\\" at her from the other room. For some reason that particular song title kills the mood.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Alright if your reading this this app is great for people that like puzzles . When I got it when it was free app of the day I thought it would be like a rubrics cube. But it wasn't.( dang you if you're bored ) and well its pretty addicting
B008J34466|5.0|How cool is P!nk? She's so awesome that I don't even care that she is using an exclamation point as an &#34;i&#34; in her name, which I normally think is a sign of mental deficiency. This is yet another great album from her. I'm not a big pop fan, but she does it right.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the English setting, the time period (WWII) and the twists and turns the novel took.  Highly recommended!

B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Denzel Washington is one of the best actor of this generation.  The supporting actor was top notch.<br />Flight keep you on the edge of your seat.

B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I am not great with providing a written opinion but I will say that this series is worth seeing from 1 - 8.  If not just for the excellent humor and bantering between brothers.
B0000028M7|5.0|I have listened to this music since the mid 90's and it is seemingly soothing to my ears and great to anyone who enjoys Alternative rock from the Seattle music movement of late 80's and early 90's
0385340540|4.0|This is the third Grisham I have read and to be honest I thouroughly enjoyed it from start to finish.<br /><br />The main plot was held back just long enough to ensure interest in getting past the character introduction. Basing the story in Italy enabled Grisham to slow the pace of the story allowed a rapport to be built with the main character.<br /><br />The pace suddenly picks up in the last 100 pages and turns the book into a real page turner as I waited to find out the fate of 'The Broker'.<br /><br />Although the conclusion seemed to be unfulfilling, the final 10 pages provided the opportunity to wipe the slate clean and see the Broker put on one last show.<br /><br />Despite the book not having the twists and turn I expected, it was an interesting read and Grisham yet again enabled me to bond with the character, and still finish the book with a smile on my face.
B0094K1WZE|1.0|impossible to download the movie - got only 50 minutes.<br />I M I M I M I M I M
B0076DELIG|5.0|I am a real softie and fan of cold case stories and Connelly does not disappoint.  Harry has a real poser going back to the LA riots and usual head butting with LAPD bureaucracy.  Not an edge of your seat thriller, but one that will more than satisfy.<br /><br />Cop Shop
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|This is a five star show for sure. It gets four for now as the streaming for seasone 3 is not in HD.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|All in all it is a fun game but I hate not being able to finish a room without using Facebook.  I want to be able to finish by myself and I don't want to bug my Facebook friends for help.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I thought this was a great book, well written and very interesting story. I would highly recommend this book to everyone that enjoys a good novel.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I had no idea what I was really getting when I purchased this game. It has quickly become my most used app. It keeps your attention and never gets boring. It is pleasant on the eyes and ears. I highly recommend it!
B009EEFTMC|4.0|If you like games that are not very mentally challenging and just keep your mind and finger occupied for a while this is the game for you.  Matching up two cubes to eliminate them from the huge cube unti there is nothing left is not as easy as it sounds.  Similarly pictured cubes can lead you astray.  Think of this as a giant cube of mahjongg tiles,  match them up to get to the cubey center!
B00881VLCE|1.0|Pictures are nice, but those you download disappear. If you do get this do not waste money on puzzles you'll lose; get free ones. Music is also repetitively annoying. This app needs some work. I'm deleting it.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Great read.  The book seemed a ittle slow in the middle, but loved the ending.  I enjoyed this as much as her other books
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Love this game!  Lots of fun to play with many levels. The graphics are gorgeous and the game is easy to play.
1451695195|5.0|I love this book but I realize that it is not for everyone. You have to believe in the unbelievable.  The doctor's experience may seem incredible to many, but I believe it all. This book is inspiring and confirming to my personal beliefs that love and acceptance are keys to enlightenment.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Fun easy read but all 3 volumes were as well.  It was nice to be able to get this volume on the Kindle.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I read this for a reading club and it got a good review from the members.  It's got some depth but is relatively easy to read
B003924NY0|5.0|I was not able to get his material when Zi was younger. You can get this & another of his(10 cds) of great material for a real good price, but its going up & I do not know how long before it is gone. These are great historical Blues/Rock cds. Come in those cardboard sleeves, but still worth every penny- Get this one & the other with 5 more cds- Thank You
B0087JTAKW|4.0|The book was an interesting idea - sort of spiritual but not religious.  It was confusing for a while but then got better when the characters started to develop.
B009PHRIKE|5.0|Whether you missed his material, or if your LP's are worn out- this is significant fusion you should own if you like fusion. So much energy, forget its an electric violin-get this 5 cd set fromAmazon before they are gone or price goes up. Isomorphic think you will be disappointed. Listen to samples. I found it on Amazon & could not resist owning ones I had missed, & replacing old lps with fresh cds. This should be in any Fusion library- period- Thank You
B0070Y46UY|2.0|I still haven't decided if I liked the book. It was certainly different. I chose not to see the movie, but I may re-think that at a later date. It sure had some strange happenings in it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway Surfers is not a bad game. I mean it's fun and all but all the characters do the same thing. I really don't<br />like it when you open it up and its all fuzzy.
0143034901|4.0|Enjoyed book for trip to Barcelona.  Interesting story outlines places in the city and gives one a look at the city.
B003VWU2WA|5.0|Loved this product. It was fairly easy to figure out how to set up on my macbook (though I did have to google around for instructions - the included instructions were fairly limited). Used it on a photo booth at my wedding and it worked fabulously.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this show and being able to purchase the digital download helped to further my addiction! I love it!
B004SKJTY6|5.0|This was a great movie and story about a prince who would eventually become King in a time of war for England.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|It started out with a bang, and ended with a bang.  A greatGrisham book. The story is really well done.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Mincemeat is the best game I've ever playmates with Pokemon as a close second.But they didn't make it nearly as good as pc and Xbox. Otherwise this is a game that I highly recommend that you get. It's definitely worth the $7. Remember parents best game EVER get it for your kid. plus there is no bad language. Lastly, it updates a little slow. P.S. there is multiplayer you just connect to the same server as your friends
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Anyone who has ever had fantasy's about love and life should read this book. A tradgedy on one side that leads to lust then love!!!!!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Everything I could have expected out of a spider solitaire game<br />Works well without any hangups as far as I have experienced.  Nothing else I can say feally
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Good game I lo e this game so much it waste so much time if u need to waste some time this is the game to get
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|This movie is a rental at best. The concept was a great idea but it wasn't nearly as funny as I had expected it to be.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|So fun to play I really enjoy it I love horses and now it's almost like I am interacting with them every day!
B00BETX5PS|4.0|The newer franchise over the years has taken the straight approach of just being an action movie.  It was nice to see in this movie some of the old bond gadgets with a modern twist get thrown back into the mix.  It's still subtle enough to be realistic but the gadgets are what separates Bond from Bourne or any other action character.
1575666286|5.0|I bought three of these books, because of the free shipping.  I gave one to my sister, on to a friend, and kept one myself.  I am very satisfied with this book.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Not what I expected at first, better. Really enjoyed from beginning to end! And the end didn't leave you hanging :)
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is the most fun game I have ever played. The trouble is I can't put it down, I'm totally addicted.
B005LAIHQS|4.0|It's better than MIB2, i think.  Josh Brlolin plays an excellent young Agent K.<br />It was pretty cool how the film maker connected K's past and J's past.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I'm the President of the &#34;I like it, &#34;but&#34; club.&#34;  You know, the guy who is the Monday morning quarter back when it comes to movies.<br /><br />Having attended the opening day performances of &#34;From Russia with Love&#34; and &#34;Dr. No,&#34; I consider myself a Bond fan.<br /><br />Yes, I have a 100 suggestions of how the movie could be improved, but I'll keep them to myself.  I really enjoyed what the writers and director did in the movie - bridging the old (Bond toys & characters) to the new.<br /><br />Spoiler:  the last credit in the movie says there will be more Bond movies - I hope they are as good as this one.
B00A1XIXM8|4.0|Not their best stuff, but pretty good.  I personally liked the prior two albums better, this one kinda grows on you also.  A lot of short, fast rocking songs.
B003VPWX6K|4.0|Our book club read this for the Sunday of the first showing of the Third Series of Dowton Abby.<br /><br />The book provides a glimpse into the life and choices of a butler and the master of the house he served.<br /><br />I believe the book is a metaphor of the choices we make during our lives.<br /><br />Short, but thoughtful read.
B005974CNA|3.0|It's a good CD; however, nothing new.<br />They got cool songs, cools sounds, and I love the fact that this band is one of the minorities that won't change their style and sound.  But the songs are a bit hard to follow (well, most of DT's songs are, but), it's almost like they went out of their way too much to make it difficult to imitate.  But if you're a DT fan and has always been like i have, you'll like it, and it's worth the money.  The DVD is really nice also.
B00358ESI4|5.0|This movie shows three sides of the war - our soldiers, their families and the Vietnamese.<br /><br />This movie does not glorify war, but rather it attempts to explain the impact on the people involved.<br /><br />We Were Soldiers is one of the great movies in the War category.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fast paced and exciting game that all 3 of my children (3,8,10) and I cannot get enough of! We enjoy \\"meeting\\" new characters and seeing who can \\"live\\" longest in one turn. Good clean fun!
B00A81MV3U|1.0|I just saw this in a theater that had about 50 folks in it - and for an alleged romantic comedy, it elicited only about three chuckles and one half cough/half chuckle.<br /><br />Why all the Oscar buzz? The movie is completely unbelievable, thoroughly self-conscious, insidiously manipulative, not funny, not romantic and the plot is as predictable as knowing who won this year's Super Bowl. Even the filming is utterly predictable: swirling cameras around happy couples, zooms in and out not where we'd least expect them - but where we have seen them a zillion times before.  And why is the acting being hosannaed to the heavens?  Bradley Cooper has no charisma whatsoever.  Jennifer Lawrence is bad girl boring.  Robert De Niro has been playing this exact same part forever and physically looks to be morphing into Tony Bennett.  And De Niro's wife - well, I thought it was Sally Struthers post-diet making a comeback - but it wasn't her - but whomever it was, all the actress did was stand around looking pole-axed.<br /><br />The way the makers of this movie try to push buttons is also both insulting and embarrassing. Characters of a distinctly politically correct nature make token appearances throughout - and what happened to the issue of bipolar disorder?  The film starts off as though it will be a rather serious study of the disorder with some comic overtones to lighten the intense issue a bit in order to make it more palatable for popular consumption - and then loses that theme a third of the way in and devolves into a trite and banal and, again, incredibly predictable love story.  One other recurring annoyance that threads through the whole affair - the characters don't really talk to or with one another.  They soliloquize.  They talk a tremendous lot, each making their script-heavy speeches - and that gets boring fast.  Some scenes seemed like they would never end.<br /><br />A last thing about this movie: Each time the main character took to jogging he would be wearing a garbage bag.  By the third or fourth time of seeing this I was so disgusted with the movie that I would have just loved to put the entire film into one big heavy-duty garbage bag!<br /><br />As for Oscar?  Well, Oscar has been pretty dumb down the years actually.  Most picks are not based on quality but on coffer control.  Many of the greatest movies ever made and the greatest performances have hardly been glanced upon by dear dumb Oscar.  One example:  how could Frankie Fane have lost an Academy Award for Best Actor to Frank Sinatra????  Oh, the tragedies of tinseltown!garbage bag.

140053271X|5.0|on time delivery, product as listed, great reader and simple to use even for a beginner would recommend just like reading a book
B00821PCJS|5.0|Sci-Fi isn't my usual viewing choice, but a friend recommended this, so I gave it a try.  I liked the plot and the imaginative aliens.  The cast is perfect as is the setting.  I'm looking forward to the next season!
B000SEGUDE|4.0|I loved reading this book. The style of writing changes with each character who tells their story as an ascending and descending crescendo. The characters are real, endearing. The plot is adventurous.<br />The only trouble I had was reading some of the futuristic accent. I'm a fast reader but it slowed me down and may be challenging or annoying for slower readers.<br />Mitchell provides a critique on where society is headed if consumerism remains unchecked but rounds out the tale with hope.<br />I watched the screen adaptation after the book and it was a job well done, although nothing can capture the detail of the novel.
B0095P3ULC|1.0|I got dizzy watching the machines transform. I only watched the movie to see Chicago, because I live there. Needless to say, I did not like this movie.
B000QUCNXG|3.0|This was a fast and easy read though I don't know that I like the unresolved ending.<br />The characters and story could have been a bit more developed, the novel felt a bit rushed. I would be happy to read a part 2 if there was one..
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Good game with good graphics that is easy to learn and play. I like it more than Temple Run 1.
B0070XFNDE|5.0|I very much enjoyed reading the trilogy by Zafon. His writing is intelligent and the descriptions of Barcelona are fantastic. To have a story line with twists and intrique makes the reading that much more enjoyable.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I enjoy this one.  This has several options as to how many puzzle pieces to have.  I think there's also where you can have them &#34;scramble&#34; them as far as rotating the pieces (which will make this harder).  It would be nice if you could stop and &#34;save&#34; a puzzle for later and come back to it, and if it has this feature I haven't found it.  One thing I can see for improvement is have where you could change that background color from dark to light---sometimes the pieces are hard to see (dark on dark).
B005LAII1C|5.0|We saw the movie at the theatre and wanted to enjoy this movie over and over at home. Item was shipped quickly without any delays.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|There's a hint of the X-Files here, but that's okay. Special division of the FBI, sci-fi conspiracy and loads of intrigue, but that's where the similarities end. Excellent sci-fi thriller centered in Boston and Harvard University. Joshua Jackson is terrific as the skeptical son of his legally insane Ph.D. father who experiments with fringe science (w/196 IQ) and Anna Torv as the beautiful yet conflicted FBI agent who rounds out this unlikely investigative trio.<br /><br />Immersive sci-fi definitely worth the investment of time to watch. 5 stars!
B005OK721G|5.0|My fav movie of 2012. I love Zoe Saldana, she makes this movie. They chose the perfect people for this
B00BETX5PS|5.0|This film is another strong entry in the Bond series.  Daniel Craig has turned out to be a good fit in the Bond role, and the supplemental cast is also good.  Judy Dench reprises her M role and she is always good in her films.<br /><br />Like all of the Bond films this one has lots of good action.  The plot line of good but it was not as entertaining as several of the older Bond films; but still a good watch.<br /><br />If you are watching this film at home a Blue Ray or a hi-definition version is recommended.<br /><br />Unfortunately when streaming from Amazon on a Comcast wireless network in a rental condo, the speed was not fast enough for hi-def so the quality was reduced due to the poor bandwidth.  Don't waste money renting the hi-def version unless you are sure your wireless network can support hi-def.  This is not the fault of the film or of Amazon, but probably the condo association trying to save some money or Comcast getting over crowded during prime time.
B00B4VI8MQ|1.0|I would really like to play this game but it won't down load on the kindle fire. I've tried for 3 days in a row and its just not working.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|One of the few albums I love to play all the way through... Usually I skip around for a few songs I like, but this one is all around awesome in my book.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game was very fun! The story line was engaging, the games were great brain teasers and those weren't even the hidden object games, which were equally as challenging. Just an all around fun game, worth the money:).
B000OVLINI|5.0|When reading this book, you mark every page, you stop and you read again the paragraph that you have just read because it is so awesomely written, you are not sure that feelings can be so amazingly described. You keep on going back and when you finish the book, you know the streets of Barcelona by heart. You will believe so firmly that you will meet all the characters at every corner of the Ramblas to MontJuic, when you will decide to go one more time to Barcelona and walk the streets just as Daniel did.
B00BESIKWM|2.0|I rented this here on Amazon not expecting much at all but I was still disappointed. From the get-go, it felt really rushed and a lot of the acting felt half-handed. The pacing felt like it was running a thousand miles an hour and there were \\"boo\\" moments every step of the way. They happened so frequently that I was bored of them about half way into the movie. The movie does shape up a little bit once they reach the other world in silent hill, but it still doesn't have the same atmosphere or treatment that made silent hill feel the way it did. I think that's an artifact of treating it like a Hollywood gore flick. I guess I don't expect a movie to really replicate the atmosphere of a game(since they are different mediums after all) but I really expected it to get a lot closer than it did. Despite all that, it was still entertaining and the visuals were interesting.
0345803485|1.0|Okay, I reluctantly admit that, out of curiosity, I tried to read the first book in this series some months ago, in hope that it might, at least, pass as mildly interesting erotica.  However, I never made it past the first two chapters due to its so-poorly-written-it-hurts-to-read-the-words lack of logical composition.  To put it bluntly, I've seen elementary level coloring books with better character development, and the so-called \\"plot\\" could have been constructed by a chimpanzee with OCD.  Erotic?  Sure... about as erotic as the label on a can of salmon.<br /><br />Having second-guessed myself (I always regret it whenever I do this) as to, \\"could it have really been THAT bad?\\" (BIG YES), I reluctantly checked out the first of the three `literary crimes against discerning readers' on audio book from my local library to see if hearing it read aloud was perhaps better than trying to read it myself.  NO... the answer is NO.  Skipping rapidly through 16 discs, I can say that with the sureness of someone who has survived a life-threatening illness, two divorces, working with the public for 30+ years... well, you get the gist of my feelings about this monstrosity!  To say that this book \\"sucks\\" would imply that it did so aptly, and that, too, would be a tremendous disservice to good writers everywhere.<br /><br />Whenever I consider purchasing a book, movie, CD or any other product, I generally go to Amazon and read the reviews by those who have already done so.  It pains me to see how many people have great praise for this waste-of-dead-trees offal.  Thankfully, there was a sizable number of people like myself who found it lacking on so many levels.  Two of the latter category comments seemed to sum it up:  \\"it makes Twilight look like Anna Karenina\\" said one, and another compared it to, \\"a literary version of Showgirls.\\" YES... I AM NOT ALONE!<br /><br />Having checked this title out earlier today, I have since returned it to the owning library because I don't even want it in my house, out of fear that I might once again be tempted to give it yet another try.  Normally, I am firmly against censorship of any kind, but now I am willing to take the lead in lighting the first torch that will burn this series and any such that dares to follow in its level of putrid awfulness!<br /><br />Please consider this review as: NOT RECOMMENDED.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Another great series from BBC, very much like Downton Abbey. If you like Downton Abbey you will like this! Enjoy!
B00A8Z6KN8|4.0|First off, I really do like the cd. I am incredibly irritated that I was forced to buy the cd rather than the mp3. I tried 5 times on all 3 of my devices with amazon cloud player. I kept getting different error messages, my gift card was charged then refunded for the purchase. I finally gave in and ordered the cd, to get the automatic download that was advertised. I continued to get error messages trying to download it, and it took 7 hours for the download. Next time I'll just go to Best Buy & save the shipping charges.
B009GED3HS|5.0|I love this show and it just keeps getting better but I have to say I am dying to meet &#34;the mother&#34; already! Lol
0887307280|5.0|I had owned a small business for 20 years and reading this book was like reading what had happened in my business.<br />Now I am trying to start another small business and hope I have learned enough by experience and reading this book to be successful!<br />I highly recommend it for anyone who is even thinking of starting a small business!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Like the opportunity to improve my ability & reflexes.  It is a challenge for a senior citizen to stay focused and improve the score.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book and the next in this series is AMAZING!!!!!I could not put them down. Yes they are similar to 50 shades but better! Less dark and more romantic. I have never been so drawn to a book. I very highly reccommend them and I can't wait until book 3 comes out!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My friend had this game and I tried it and fell in love! Keeps the boredom blues away! Fun game for horse lovers of all ages
0345803493|5.0|just finished this book and couldnt put it down until i finished it and wow the ending got me ready to pick up the 3rd one and i cnt wait to read it...man i cant believe all that happened in this book..its a must read and a page turner. trust me u will want to read it. i highly recommend this book to anyone that wants to read and enjoy a good book.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I have not been so involved in a mini series as I am with Downton Abbey.  It is by far the best.
B0095ZMMCK|2.0|For many years I have been a big fan of Tom Clancy.  I have read some of his works numerous times, enjoying them as much or more on rereading.  Threat Vector will not be one of these.  I don't see any of the meticulous research that Clancy normally does in this book.  It is simplistic in the discussion of technology, sort of like it is being written for an 8th grade audience, and the writing style is not much better.  The story line itself has promise, and is highly relevant to the issues in the world today.  The way it is portrayed does not live up to its promise.  I would rather go back and read some of the real Clancy again.  Not recommended.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Now I understand the use combination of alcoholics and cocaine.  That way they can just never stop drinking. Fabulous movie.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is so fun. Its like your actually in the game.I really love this game.This is one of my favorite games to play!
B00B7G3NFU|3.0|I must have expected more from this movie.  I was disappointed that the female character fell in love with the man.  Somehow that wasn't believable to me.
B008MM9630|5.0|this is my second farm and I am playing better and my farm is so cool can not stop playing I love it
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Best book ever I love it soo much! I can't wait until October! You are killing me! I love this series!
B001QFZADA|4.0|I had read Gary's original book about love in romantic partnerships and as I am a widow, I thought I'd see if there was anything that could be of value to me under the Singles heading and I did. This book has a make-sense approach to all sorts of relationships such as those between siblings, parents and children, same-sex friends etc. I can highly recommend it.
B00338QENI|4.0|I found this book to be very fascinating and informative. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that the author belabored the Lacks family reactions a little too long. I got a little tired of the lengthy and repetitive antics of Deborah. We got a good feel for her character early on and a lot of the narrative about Deborah was too repetitive. I still highly recommend this book. It brings to the forefront a lot of medical and ethical issues that most of the public have been unaware of.
B00846REIS|5.0|Thank heavens, a heroine who's not a virgin!  Eva has been around the block a few times and recognizes she's made<br />bad relationship decisions based on her intial introduction to sex as a substitute for acceptance, affection and control.<br /><br />Eva's strong, smart and is aware that her attraction to Gideon might be based on the fact drama feels comfortable and \\"normal\\" to her way of life.  Recognizing that, she wants to break out of that cycle to seek a more mature relationship.  Their pasts result in hypersexual behavior, which makes for frequent and steamy sex scenes.<br /><br />I didn't care for the BDSM in 50 shades--that seems like a life style choice.  The rare instances when those aspects entered this book it was part of sex play or behavior from the past rearing it's head.<br /><br />I rarely touch a book after reading it--this one I've re-read three times!
B00447L4KA|4.0|i love this movie and have wanted it a long time. When I purchased it, the movie can fast and was in great condition.
B008ASGP3U|5.0|Rebus is one of the most memorable policemen in the genre and this book continues the tradition -- we all hope that somehow Rebus will return again in the future to exercise his non-conformist and insubordinate approach to solving crimes
B0034G4P80|5.0|The movie arrived on time and I paid a lot less through this website than I would have in a store.
1250010403|5.0|I loved reading this novel and also the first one.  I am now looking for some of his earlier writing and have fornd on that was written in '06 that is just as good as the Clifton Chronicles.  He is a marvellous author!
B00AA7V2Z0|5.0|such a great show!!  well written, captivating and sooooo creepy!!  i still can't get over that this in on network tv!  jessica lange is amazing.  so is francis conroy
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Read the title, it says it all. All the elements for a great story are here. Read this one immediately.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|Season 1 of Breaking Bad sets the stage for what is the best series I have ever watched. Season 1 draws you toward a giant of desperation, committment, family, heartbreak, love and the tenderness of a baby.  Not enough words to describe how great it is.
B00846REIS|5.0|All I can say, is this is a great book! Much better than 50 Shades and I was a huge fan of that. If you love this, you will definitely love book 2 and I recommend the 'Breathless Trilogy' by Maya Banks when done with this series.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I loved this very original novel about a damaged young woman and her struggles to find connection with other living beings. Set in the present and in the past, this book is a roller-coaster ride that will mesmerize you and leave you pondering the very boundaries of love and acceptance. Perhaps a bit of a &#34;girly&#34; book, I would none the less recommend this novel to anyone who appreciates fine literature that deals with the nature of the human heart.
B00821PCJS|5.0|This show draws you in.  Action, human interaction, all allows you to forgive the few negatives.  Exploring how people act in outrageously horrible situations - how would you react?  This isn't going to be better anytime soon (similar situations to war, natural disasters).  These people are fighting for their lives.  It brings out the best and the worst in humanity.  You can forgive that Noah Wiley survives when many times he probably wouldn't have.  Realistic plot twists and makeup, special effects.  Great entertainment!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Don't know if this novel is intended for the young adult audience since it centers around the story of a teenage girl and her boyfriend, but deals with some very adult themes such as sexual abuse, but I really enjoyed this book and I am in the 50+ range. Lots of plot twists and surprising developments, but all is revealed in the end. A real page-turner with thought-provoking content.
B004JMZPJG|4.0|The medium-sized camera holster allowed me to put a divider between the external flash (in bottom) and my Lumix FZ200 (on top). The side pockets give room for the extra battery and charger. So, I can get what I need into the case and still have portability.  If I want to take my filter lenses along, I just have to plan what I wear or whether to use my larger bag--but that's up to me.<br /><br />The only missing feature is a velcro &#34;latch&#34; and ovelapping cover instead of a three-corner zip. The zip takes a little too long to open when a really good quick shot comes along. I have to remind myself to leave the cover unzipped (or only partially zipped) when in the field, but then have to worry about tipping the bag.<br /><br />My smaller, older LowePro bag has the velcro cover, but it's too small for my kit.<br /><br />Price is right, but I still have a &#34;wish list&#34; of that one change.

B003B02PFO|5.0|Change of pace for John Grisham but a very funny and interesting book.  Conjures up memories of families I knew growing up.  He should write more humorous books because he has a real knack for it.
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|I love the book, and the movie is just as amazing. The best of 2012. Perfect casting! Logan Lerman deserves awards. I love that the author of the book directed the film to. I would recommend the film to pretty much anyone!
B001B3MCQK|4.0|Good music just doesn't get old . Hard to believe this dude waqs so unknown at the time the writing of this music .
B001XUPGLY|5.0|I watch this Star Trek movie once a year.  It's my favorite.  I love that they go back in time to a place where they are so out of place it's funny.  I liked that they saved the planet too.
B00846REIS|5.0|This is wonderfully delightful. Anyone that enjoyed 50 shades of grey will love this book more. I didn't believe it to be possible. However, I'm hooked and must keep reading.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Bruno Mars is a great up and coming artist whose music, lyrics and vocals should produce #1 hit for a long time
B00BETX5PS|2.0|Too long and plot was somewhat difficult to follow. The harking back to the music and car of DR. KNOW didn't work for me.
B00456H5LC|5.0|Bruno Mars is a great up and coming artist whose music, lyrics and vocals should produce #1 hit for a long time.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Another great show that was never given a fair chance by the network empty suits.  Very good stories and acting.
B00AVTMCYW|4.0|This movie was interesting and had a good plot. I really enjoyed the cast and I think this was a great first movie for Emma Watson since Harry Potter.
146500632X|4.0|If she's happy, I'm happy.  Anything 1D will please her, she's a huge fan and now has photos on her wall.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I enjoy Daniel Craig and how he fits this this role, in the vien of the newer Bond flicks we have seen.
B00APUTEBG|4.0|A cold Sunday afternoon movie.  Combined with a bowl of popcorn= a good escape! Would not recommend for young children.
B005LAIGLO|5.0|I really like Mark Wahlberg in just about any movie. I find him very sexy and cool.Slightlly slow to start but it soon warmed up. Action ,thrills.,plot.This movie has it all.Well worth watching.
B00AYB20KI|4.0|I really did enjoy this movie, its scary and has a good story.  If it weren't for the fact that in one scene (non spoiler) someone's flashlight's batteries die, I'd give it five stars.  haha.
0345472322|3.0|The idea is simple but explained in so many different ways.  It feels repetitive after the first three scenarios.  It is tempting to just read the end.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book was much better than the movie, which I saw immediately after finishing the book.  There was so much more detail and entertaining substance to the book, which showed a much better picture of the lives of the characters involved.  I highly recommend reading the book--skip the movie.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great service - excellent streaming - great series. My wife and I were 2 years behind on the series, we caught up in 2 weeks, at our convenience. What a deal.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Kept me interested until the very end.  I'm incredibly good at discovering the end of a book in the middle, although I had my suspicions, the ending had me spinning in my seat with overwhelming shock.  Great read!  And this isn't my usual cup of tea, I rarely find myself reading romance novels.  But this book had me looking for other great finds in this category. I discovered myself looking for others written by Colleen Hoover and have yet to be disappointed.  Thank you for helping me find joy in a new genre I normally do not pick up.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Even though the characters in Downton Abbey lived in another era, they are relatable, whatever class.  The Crawleys are the Lord and Lady of the grand house, but their lives are filled drama, heartache, and humor, not so far removed from that of the staff members who serve them.  In Season 3, the heartache is so real, so well written, and so well acted, the watcher is not just drawn into the drama, but may be moved to tears
B002B292K4|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums. There are  really great Beatles songs here that some very talented musicians have respectfully redone for the movie &#34;I am Sam&#34;. While the songs aren't identical sounding to the originals, I think they did a great job at staying true to the music while putting their own spin on the tracks. There is more than one masterpiece on this album. If I try to come up with a favorite I end up thinking of at least 8 or 9 songs and can't narrow down to just one. None of the songs feel like they butchered or totally disrespected the original versions. I've bought this album 3 times. The first got scratched and I lost the second. It was an album I liked so much I was perfectly willing to pay for it more than once to keep it in my collection. Love to blast it in the car and sing along while stuck in traffic.
B0094K1JPC|3.0|I love the cast but this movie didn't live up to my expectations.  I think these actors would be great together just in another movie.
B0014DQSG2|4.0|The movie was cute.  I watched it the first time because it was a remake of an old favorite movie The Reluctant Debutant, which stared Sandra Dee. Not quite as good as the original movie but enjoyable.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The seasons only keep getting better, except for something that happened in the Christmas special episode....that left me bummed : (
B003JUGQ38|5.0|one of the best seasons, Donna by far the best companion for the 10th Dr., would highly recommend, loved it.
1402760663|4.0|I read this book in paperback first.  It was well written and documented.<br />I believe the history of how the Indians were treated should not be<br />forgotten and decided I wanted a hardback book to be able to pass this<br />on to family members.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that it<br />included many more pictures of prominent Indians at that time period<br />and was a lot larger book than I expected.
B004LWZW7E|5.0|Rated 5 stars because the movie arrived quickly and played perfectly. Storyline is very cool, special effects are great. \\\
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Not for the squeamish but far more in keeping with Wagner's original Dredd concept than the Stallone disaster - we never see Dredd's face for example - something Stallone's ego would never have tolerated. Production design is good although Mega-City one seems a little 2-dimensional. Could use a little more of the tongue-in-cheek British humor and a little less overt Dirty Harry influence but I would recommend for anyone who needs a break from the Disney-fication of comic book heroes.
B00B0ZT9NI|4.0|I think my expectations were set very high after hearing about all the nominations the movie received.<br />Still a worth while movie.
B00APJLX8E|4.0|I was surprised this was Adam Sandler. Especially after his last two films. Jack and Jill and That's My Boy. Both of which really sucked.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|Many new ultrabooks are not coming with ethernet ports anymore to save on space. Did not realize this when I got the computer and needed an ethernet port to enter my works network.    Beyond not having an ethernet port, my laptop doesn't have an optical drive. So, I downloaded the driver from the Anker website, hooked up the usb ethernet adapter and BANG, I was connected to the internet.    Here is the link to download the driver.    [...]    Works perfectly and because it is USB 3.0 it does not compromise the speed of the internet!    Your port HAS TO BE USB 3.0 for the adapter to work! Should be a blue color port!
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|Greg strikes again! Great book and good pictures! I'm so happy I discovers it before my sister did. Wow wow.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love to play this game! My daughter and I both play. She loves horses, so she has fun taking care of her virtual horse.
B009VB7QQA|1.0|Order this product in the non-HD form. The HD format was HORRIBLE and I do mean to yell that at you.<br />The movie is fun to watch but the book is much better.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very addictive. Updates keeps the game from getting old.Competing against your facebook friends  for the top score forces you to keep playing .Definitely up there with temple run and angry birds
B00ARAO720|4.0|I enjoyed it.  Held my attention.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Don't know how those bike messengers survive thru even one day let alone make a career of it!
B007MG360G|5.0|This is a very fun game. I couldn't put in down. I completed the game and I'm thinking of trying to get my mom to buy the other app's from this company. It's totally worth the money. It keeps me and my bro busy. Me can't put it down and we are always trading new animals. I also enjoy the introduction. Don't skip through the introduction. It's a very thought out game and very entertaining.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|There may be other more specialized apps that are equal to TripAdvisor for locating different attractions but I find TripAdvisor to be the best overall.  If I am looking at restaurants, for example, I may look at TripAdvisor and Yelp for reviews but most of the time I just use TA for everything.
B003OUXECE|4.0|Fun and enjoyable read for those who crave more Rapture. Would recommend to any gamer that want more of the story.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|This is a good product although not my favorite.  I travel extensively by motorcycle and seeing the local satellite conditions is of paramount importance.  I believe other apps are better suited for that specific function.
B004ZQBP3Q|5.0|music that make you smile worth every penny.<br />. . . . . . . . . . . .
B004SD5GZ4|2.0|I have to admit I'm biased because I need a product that allows PDFs to be be generated.  Reader is a good product if reading pdfs is all you require.  Acrobat, which generates pdfs, is priced far beyond the market so any/all Adobe products aren't going to be perceived in a positive manner by me.  There are other apps that allow pdfs to be generated that are far more cost effective...Nitro for one.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great books. I got all three. Someone said they were hard to read..not so. I found them to be easy to read and a wonderful story. As proof....I cried at the end of the trilogy.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Although somewhat depressing, I found the book to be riveting. I have passed it along to friends, and initially read it on recommendation.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|The drama was a bit much, and the finale was what I' been hoping for for a long time. at its best are the dinner table conversations and the interesting ways life is viewed downstairs compared to upstairs.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is so addicting! I love it! Anybody who says it stinks is a despicable person! Never get any cheap copy of it, get the real thing. Even though it costs money its so worth it!
B006Z9SP3E|5.0|This rating is chosen as Jeffery Archer books are very addictive and a complusive read.  Looking forward to next release.
B004T32SOK|5.0|This is a great application!  Easy enough to set up and use and makes transferring files between your PC, Mac, iPad, etc. easy and painless…….and the base application is free.  For business use, added space is inexpensive and you can share the folders with others.  All around one of the most useable apps I've found!
B003DWC6IQ|5.0|Seems I have to repeat myself as once again I have found this novel compulsive reading and enjoyed it very much.
B003RRY60S|5.0|...this book. It's wonderfully written, especially when you consider how little the author had to go on at the time it was written. One of the best Doctor Who novels there is.
B009DJB9HC|4.0|It lives up to what I expected from BCC. This album falls into line with the excellent music on the first 2 albums from this supergroup. They are a true 70's rock band.
B007THA4FI|2.0|This book has been easy to put down and hard to pick up.  I feel an obligation to finish it, but it is not really holding my interest.  There is a lot of obscenity and I find it a bit crude.<br />On the up side, it is well written.  I enjoy the way the story line mingles from one character to another and back again.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Fantastic moving account of bravery, courage and sacrifice under adverse conditions. I read this book in several hours-I couldn't put it down!
B00B3MN65K|5.0|I mean, it'd be worth listening to just for his voice, even if the songs were awful.  But in fact, &#34;Brave&#34;, &#34;False Alarms&#34; and &#34;Happy in My Heartache&#34; are each worth the price of the album.
B004WC4S0K|4.0|I like this album, I don't think non-Oasis fans will get the chance to hear it.  This genres of music is not in fashion and never gets played except on &#34;classic rock&#34; stations, really too bad!  Nice effort
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I think the price is too high for a single episode, but I love the series. Two very attractive women and a good story line makes for great viewing.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|addicted to this show along with all the millions of others, no I have to wait for the next season.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|Although not as good as some of the other Bond movies, still a good watch. Loved the original Bond car.
B0053JJLLC|1.0|I was listening to NPR's interview with Robert Preston which piqued my interest in Creighton's last book.  I had been a fan of Creighton's since Adromeda Strain.  None of his books have been heavy reading but still interesting.  I bought Micro but was unimpressed almost from the first page.  The \\"science\\" is very weak which can be tolerated and even expected but the story line is hopeless.  People are compressed to a height of one-half inch and put into a tropical jungle setting and pursued by a real bad guy full sized and others in miniature along with the billions of actual micro-size animals but the good guy half inch people are barely fazed, treating it like being in an amusement park even as some of them are eaten by ants and attacked by wasps, etc.  Dialogue is high-schoolish, characters are comic bookish.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This book was written with excellent research and really our<br />world today and tomorrow, do read it and pass it on to your<br />friends.
0393072231|4.0|A primer for anyone with a real interest in learning about about how Wall Street works to detriment of everyone except the people that control Wall Street.  A must read on the real story of the great recession of 2008.
B007URCTOG|3.0|Again my girl rented this movie and she loved it. She asked me to add to our collection so I did. I will eventually watch it with her .
B00846REIS|4.0|This book is awesome. Everybody should read it. I enjoyed this book very very much. Great writing. I didn't put it down once.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|I enjoyed this movie. Held my interest to the end. I will add it to my collection. I don't think this will disappoint any sci fi fans.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Facinating account of the Seals. I enjoyed this very much. Reading it at the same time as the movie, Zero Dark Thirty, put a new perspective on the mission and others.
B00B7G3Y4U|2.0|Very poor ending to a good franchise. Whoever wrote this one should be ashamed. I could have written a better ending to these movies in my sleep.
B006Z00R1Q|1.0|This is the worst of the series.  Nothing really happen during the first 40 minutes.  When finally action happen is so silly .... well I just fell a sleep...
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|Ive never seen this movie but according to the rest of the world it was suppose to be pretty good. If I ever see it I will give a full review on it.
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|I'm a sucker for retro gaming-themed movies, so I knew I would probably like this movie. Most of the characters seem 1-dimensional at first, as retro game characters should be, but are fleshed out into &#34;real&#34; people by the end of the movie. Besides the entertaining plot and funny characters, there are lots of ridiculously colorful environments and a great soundtrack.
B009CPEOC4|3.0|I didn't watch this,not for me, but my girl really enjoyed it. She has good taste in movies so I will have to say it was good for those who like Katy Perry.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Love Angry Bird Rio.....the challenges are great, love the bonuses...endless entertainment....Look forward to more like this in the future.....Highly recommend...
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|It is just so satisfying after a long frustrating day at work to take out your anger on these little piggies. Crashing them into walls, shooting them up in the air with dynamite and seeing the look on their stupid pig faces when they know that s*** just got real.
B009I2UH2W|5.0|Good quality and works with my iphone 5. I have used the cheap low-end cords as well and can really tell the difference using this one. Worth the money. I like the LED light. I don't think it's at all bothersome.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Tried the free battery and it worked fine but when I saw this choice I thought I would try it.<br />It works cool with the extras making the small cost well worth while. It actually talks to me when my battery needs charging. WOW!
B005LAIIJY|5.0|Django Unchained is a movie everyone should see. It truly has something for everyone, and works well on several different levels. This review is a guide through these different levels and generally for the film itself.<br /><br />Level One: This is an action film. On this level, if you’re looking for action, fights, flights, gunfights, well, certainly this is a film you should watch. Would a Tarrantino film be a Tarrantino film without action?<br /><br />Level Two: This is a Western. The movie is set during 1858 through 1859. The locales are the western states and Mississippi. The sets are convincing, the characters are believable. Tarrantino has created a brilliant script and story. Basically, the general population of the United States is depicted as ignorant, bigoted, racists, which this reviewer believes is not far off the mark.<br /><br />Level Three: This is a historical film. By far the most controversial aspect of this film. There is generous use of the n-word, which to ears of 2013 is offensive, but for 1858 through 1859 was commonplace. Inconvenient truth. Tarrantino’s depiction of the conditions for slavery are barbaric, brutal, and painful to witness. Slavery was, however, a barbaric and brutal system, and poisoned all who came into contact with it. Another inconvenient truth was the character depicted by Samuel Jackson who played the House Servant. There were also slaves who lived in the slave master’s house and were essentially the slave master’s personal servant and resident yes-man. The House Servant was reviled at the time by the slaves working in the fields, and modernly ridiculed by such figures as Malcolm X, and  rightfully so, as traitors. By far most of the controversy around the film have pertained to these elements, and the controversy has come from every quarter. This can only mean that the movie has touched a deep chord in our collective consciousness and the wounds from slavery and/or the Civil Rights Era have not been completely healed.<br /><br />Level Four: This is a Road movie. Like Two-Lane Blacktop, like Easy Rider, like Vanishing Point, like any one of the many “On-the-Road” movies with Bob Hope and Bing Crosby, this movie shows a journey with two protagonists, through the desolate and decrepit streets of insignificant western town, to the muggy, swampy, Mississippi plantations, and all of the adventures encountered along the way. This is by far the most unique aspect of the film. Tarrantino is the master of non-linear story-telling. This movie, however, is amazingly LINEAR, the simple telling of a story, from start to end, with a minimum of flashbacks.<br /><br />Level Five: This is a mythological movie. Django’s quest is to locate and free his wife, named Brunnhilde, a slave raised learning to speak German. As Schultz explains the most famous German legend is that of Siegfried, a hero who killed a dragon and braved a ring of fire to free his Brunnhilde.<br /><br />Level Six: This is a fantasy. Just as Inglorious Basterds climaxes with Hitler and his associates being blown up in a movie theater, Django Unchained ends with the plantation — and the House Servant — blown to bits. This reviewer is not aware, of course, of such an occurrence ever happening as historical fact  ...  but we can all dream.<br /><br />If you’ve followed Tarrantino’s career, he has matured as a movie maker with this film. The Tarrantino shtick found in previous films are present here, but underplayed. This reviewer believes Pulp Fiction is still his masterpiece, but this movie is a close second. But make no mistake, Django Unchained is at times a difficult film to watch. That difficulty arises in viewing the stark realities of the slave system in shocking detail. But as this review has attempted to show, this movie can be watched on any one of the many levels contained in the story. It certainly deserves five stars.ealed.<br /><br />Level Four: This is a Road movie.

B00B0ZT9NI|4.0|I was kid during the time in history this event had taken place. The media bash our president then has they do now and this man help people and kept the image of our nation very positive. I think has a actor/producer it was a good story line with real news footage that covered a great story in American History.  Ben Affleck did a good job just telling it has it happen often times we wish our news outlets would do the same and leave their personnel opinions out. I will watch this again. GOOD TOPIC FOR AN HISTORY CLASS.
B0049GYXDG|5.0|great classic movie and many special features available for the whole family to enjoy and you got to love the blue-ray picture!
B00B2EWNWG|4.0|This movie had all the elements of those 60's and 70's kung-fu flicks  was a great movie RZA is still waving the wu-tang flag. This was a good throw back movie
B006VAJ9UK|5.0|Loved this book, though I don't generally read Terry Pratchett.  The concept of the Pied Piper story redone was hysterical, and the book explored some thoughtful issues.  I liked the mixture of humans and human rodents/cats. The twists and turns and derring-do was clever without being unduly gory.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|I really liked this movie.  I thought everyone did a really good job portraying the characters.  It was heart warming and enjoyable to watch.
B003QSLW0K|5.0|great movie for my 4 year old grandson. i rented it several times and finally purchased it. i sent him home with him
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|This was very funny.  There were laugh out loud moments.  It was a good comedy and had a cute story behind it.  I enjoyed watching it.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Essily the gripping novel I've read in years! Very glad to have discovered that there is a sequel... The more you get to know the characters, the harder it is to put the book down...
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great fun! Wish though there was a menu of move explanations for those of us without a lifetime of gaming experience!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I loved this story! The pictures were creepy enough to keep it interesting and the story was different than anything I've read. I can't wait to see the film adaptation of this.
B000KQGOA4|5.0|Anyone who enjoys phenomenal orchestral music should purchase this recording.  Absolutely overwhelming in its power and vitality.  Level of professionalism unsurpassed.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I'm not usually a fan of Nicholas Spark's books but since I heard that this one wasn't all mushy and lovey-dovey, I figured I'd give it a read. It was a great story. The way he portrays the main character and her abusive husband is amazing and interesting. I'd definitely recommend it. But not the movie - they completely butchered the movie.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|To be blunt, I'm a business author that saw this title and thought &#34;THAT'S what I want to know&#34;<br /><br />Locke has a system, and it works. He utilizes pricing, multiple titles, Twitter, Blogging, Facebook, and e-mailing to build a following. Maybe nothing earth shattering so far, but not bad advice. The negative reviews are from people not seeing the real value here, I think.<br /><br />Locke uses Blog posts that really suck you in. The blog posts are probably his finest writing, and they really work to segment the audience. His idea of &#34;Borrowed Loyalty&#34; may not be unique, but it was presented well, and the idea itself is massively effective.<br /><br />The book takes longer than it needs to tell the story, but it isn't a boring read. If you write series fiction, I can promise you this book has some real advice from a marketing mind (most fiction authors don't think like this, I find).<br /><br />For a business author like me? Not as valuable. But for the price of a cheap lunch, not bad advice at all.<br /><br />Some other reviewers attack the author for using paid reviews. So? Maybe I wouldn't pay for them either. But we all ask friends, relatives, other authors, and others for reviews. And reviews are one of the pillars that get Kindle to notice your book.<br /><br />His advice (I'm paraphrasing here) of find a niche, segment the niche, gather a loyal following, market to that following with multiple books...is good advice.<br /><br />His segment on building compelling characters is interesting too.<br /><br />The book reads like he wrote it in a weekend, But a weekend with a Mega selling author...for ten bucks? Not a bad deal.
B00006EXDM|5.0|I bought this cd for my brother who has always been a Stones fan.  He has enjoyed the cd and is convincing his young son that the Stones are still the best ever.
B000BF0D9M|5.0|Love his music, same as last review. His music is excellent.<br />Received quickly and it was well packed.<br />Thankyou,  will probably order more
B009GX6TQ6|5.0|NCISL Los Angeles is just a  great show that can keep its audience amused, while also keeping you entertained.<br />It has a variety of story lines and characters that fit well.
B007SGM084|5.0|Unable to put these books down, more than once and still a great read. No need to listen to the negatives, I enjoyed every page.
B00821OX98|5.0|Good realism. It is believable. Goo actors. I,m a sci-fi guy and this series is a great fix for me.
B007A6XLDU|1.0|Didn't work very well. Slick looking screens but I have apps that do all this without taking up as much space.
0061992860|5.0|This book is an awesome overview of survival techniques and essentials. It is pocket sized so it can be carried anywhere you need to go. It will help you be prepared to survive inthe outdoors if you are a layperson and know nothing like me.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|It arrived very quickly and I am so pleased to have both seasons together for such a great price. To have each season in their own DVD case makes for easier storage to me. I wish the Christmas episode at the end of Season 2 was included, but it has to be bought separately. I would have gladly paid more to have them all come together. Other than that, I am well pleased.
B004GYY714|4.0|I  didn't find any issue with this app. Easy to use and the connections are very quickly. I will recommend this app
0307279189|5.0|Fantastic book, a real page turner. No wonder it is a best seller. I have recommended it for all of my friends.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I like this book so much that even though it was violent and mushy.<br />You should definitely get all the hunger games
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|played other games like this. this is one of the better ones. great graphics. took me two days to finish.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Very knowledgeable :-) I will pass on the book to my fellow citizens by posting it on face book thank you
B003G4W49C|4.0|This gives new meaning to the phrase &#34;and a child shall lead them&#34;.  Ender's game considers to role of children being molded to the extreme.  It explorers the paradoxical attributes that make a leader.  The mark of a good book is that it is satisfying and yet wants you craving for more when it is done.  This is a good book!
0316017922|5.0|I really enjoyed the ease of reading this book and the flow it had.  Malcolm Gladwell drew up some great points that make you think very intelectually about many different topics, while also making a comfortable, lesiure read.
B005G5PPGS|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie, and once I learned a little bit more about the author I decided to try the book.  Much more in depth on the main characters(who I was fans of anyway), and very interesting story.  Very very recommended, and now I'm reading through his backlog.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Hugh Howey's post-apocalyptic world, in which all that remains of the human race lives in massive underground silos, is amazing.<br /><br />Interesting, sympathetic characters, all of them doing what they think they have to do, eschew easy good/bad dichotomies for a more nuanced, realistic approach.<br /><br />The plot keeps moving forward, and I found myself repeatedly surprised when events turned in a direction I hadn't anticipated, while remaining plausible.<br /><br />I can't wait to read more!
B003EV6DBM|5.0|My entire family enjoyed this season, and we enjoy looking for scenes that were cut from the tevised shows on BBCA.  We enjoy the monster files, and all the extra features.  We also have the Complete Sixth Series now, and it won't be long before we own the Complete Seventh Series!!
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|I'm a comedy guy and almost everything I watch is a comedy.  This is one of the best.  Having spent some time in Boston, I especially enjoyed the accent as part of the humor.  This is a must see.
B0089AD8IO|5.0|When I first started watching Dr. Who on BBCA, my 12-year-old son had aready seen several episodes of Seasons 1-6.  I started watching them with him, starting with Matt Smith, who remains my favorite doctor.  I slowly warmed to David Tennant, then started watching Christopher Eccleston as the Doctor.  Doctor Who: The Complete First Series is a great start to the new series, with great monsters and a great companion.  We all really like Rose Tyler and her family.  The Slitheen were great aliens.
B004X4R49Y|5.0|This a must watch movie.  There is a good reason it got so much acclaim and so much Oscar buzz.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app is amazing on the kindle fire.  It actually doesn't drain my battery like I thought it would.  My boyfriend recommended me getting this app because he has it on his MacBook.  I wish there were more apps like this one.  It has been so relaxing.  And it keeps children calm and helps them sleep.
B00499QUK2|5.0|This is British entertainment at it's best.  It's creative, it's sophisticated, it's got layers beyond layers of subtlety and it's downright funny at times as well.  The amazingly creative writing and brand new take on Sherlock Holmes is nothing short of a revelation - and this is coming from a HUGE fan of Sherlock Holmes who has read every single word written by Conan Doyle.  The brilliance of the writing stands out and this simply must not be missed.  In 2009, I watched my first episode on a plane to London and spent the next couple of years desperately searching in vain for a way to find more of it (it wasn't on DVD yet and good luck trying to find it searching tor it on PBS)!  Now the rest of the world has finally caught up and it's easy to find so watch it.  You'll be hooked.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I am a Sherlock Holmes freak which makes any interperpretation of interest to me. Lucy Liu and Jonny Lee Miller are a wonderful duo to watch. It is a bit too violent fo my taste(which it could do very well without) so I just shut my eyes and I don't watch the parts that upset me. I look forward to the next season.
B004RL9T50|4.0|Good to watch on a plane.  The story was different and it kept my interest the entire time.  Excellent animation as well.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A true \\"Masterpiece\\" of drama. The presentation of this period is like going back in time and living with this family. Viewer is such an integral part of the story. My heart is heavy waiting for Season 4?!?
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|I enjoyed this film, and was glad I watched it. The story was charming and the animation was well done. But when it was over I missed the transcendent &#34;wow&#34; feeling I got from other Pixar movies. This one just wasn't the life event I've come to expect from Pixar.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|The book was very good. It was not one of her best novels that I have read.I didn't care for the ending.
B00821PCJS|4.0|This is a terrific show for people like me, who are fans of &#34;soft&#34; sicfi.  Although there is a lot of violence--blood of several different species--the central characters are very appealing humans who most of the time make ethical decisions when faced with difficult choices.  The series was vey good in the first season, although a little predictable.  The second season is much more tightly scripted and even more compelling.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|I thought the book was interesting and taught me a new way of thinking about flower selections. The story showed the human side of forgiveness and understanding, as well as misunderstanding.  Overall however,  I thought the story was a bit farfetched and hard to relate to.
B000SLP4SE|5.0|Very good movie. Action packed. Kept my interest throughout recommend highly. Will watch again sometime. Interesting scenario also. Watch it,
B007J4T2G8|5.0|worth reading if your looking for a romance. there were a few things that were unexpected.  cant wait to read the next two
B001UGB1X8|5.0|Tommy Lee Jones great as always. Louisiana a great backdrop for a great mystery. Keeps you on the edge of your seat
B009VYF5E2|5.0|We love Merlin - so sorry this is the last season.<br />I am not at all happy with having to write so many words for my reviews and that I cannot submit my rating without word count!
B005BGBPBG|1.0|Watched this as the \\"Ladies' Night\\" selection at family movie night. We suffered through the first two thirds and when we noticed everyone was looking at their phones just turned it off. This is \\"wish fulfillment\\" that exposes some really unpleasant things about the writers and how they think about their audience. The characters are beyond flawed, trending over into outright evil - justifying it with a lack of common sense and paralyzing insecurity. The most admirable character is the \\"best friend\\" who, rather than confront a woman he slept with and didn't want to see any more, pretends to be gay. Terrible people, doing terrible things, being insecure, weak, and selfish.
0525425764|5.0|the book was all it said it would be. John Grisham is a great author for young adults.  My son could not put this book down.
030758836X|3.0|OK.  I must admit I really enjoyed reading the book.  The author put together a Hell of a story with a lot of unexpected twists.  I agree with many of the other reviewers that the book was in the \\"couldn't put down\\" category, but I also agree with those reviewers who pointed out and condemned the disappointing ending.  What was the author thinking ? As for character development, both Amy and Nick are nothing if not memorable.  On the margin, I believe worth your time.
0525953728|5.0|This is a very interesting, well-written, straight-forward account of the mission that found and killed Osama Bin Laden.<br /><br />\\"Owens\\" describes his life, his SEAL training, and details how Bin Laden was brought to the best justice available at the time.<br /><br />I recommend reading this book after [[ASIN:0802120342 The Finish: The Killing of Osama Bin Laden]], because this account does not provide the background information provided by Bowden's work.<br /><br />On the other hand, there are details (such as Bowden's desciption of Bin Laden's daughter seeing her father's dead body being dragged down the stairs, his bloody head bouncing on each step) that one book may treat lightly that the other confirms.<br /><br />Actually, I always think when one reads a history book it is a good idea to follow it with another book on the same topic.  Try it a time or two and you will discover how much you can learn.  Every author has a point of view.  Every author includes things (and leaves things out).  Reading at least two works will often show you what one writer missed or didn't understand.
0316098329|4.0|While this book was very interesting, I had a problem with it from my own personal standpoint.  It brought me memories that I would just soon forget so had to skip parts of it, but the end was very satisfying and so it redeemed itself.
B001NHNG64|5.0|I am trying to read all Jack Reacher books.  Loved the movie and I enjoy all of Lee childs books.
B00B7FXYJG|5.0|I read the comic a while back and it was quite pleasant to see an animated feature on it. IMO, This is one of the best batman animated movies!
B007C52NY2|4.0|I was looking for a mystery with complexities. &#34;Dragon Tattoo&#34; did not disappoint me. I am looking forward to starting boook two as soon as possible. I was amazed at the author's grasp of computer technology and the financial world.
B008FPOIT6|3.0|The book starts with an interesting premise but loses momentum towards the lack-luster ending. Parts of it, especially in the first half, sound more like odes of love to technology and Google. Thankfully, in the second half technology takes the role of a tool to accomplish a task.
B00333NCTM|5.0|Very good reading. Sad and serious.Glad to hear that things are on the right path. Funny also. Very good. Worth it.
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|Huge fan.  Great CD. Will definitely have you tapping your toes.  A must have for the Train enthusiast. A++ great
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hoover is a great author. Her first books (Slammed and Point of Retreat) were really good, and kind of your basic everyday love story with a slight twist, but Hopeless is a new realm that she's embraced and completely pulled off. It is a love story, but the history behind it adds so much depth and complexity. This is one of my favorite books.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Delightful book especially for those of us who believe that dogs have a soul and are somewhat human. I love it!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I enjoyed the book both as a spirtual book and also as a story about an extrodinary man's life.  It was not over the top religious.
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|I really like this version of the app. Really allows me to take advantage of my large (tablet) screen, providing much information in a very compact but easy to access way.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Kept my attention and ending was a surprise. Now I can see the movie to see if it ends the same...
B009EHDU7U|5.0|Well written, in an amusing style with an imaginative (if somewhat bizarre) plot. We smiled right through to the end.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I heartily recommend this book for anyone that likes &#34;hard science fiction&#34;.  While there may be some technical inaccuracies in the story, it makes for an excellent read for the most part.  Good humor, good plot, good twists, good drama...all around good.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Absolutely loved it on my kindle fire hd!! The scenery and past living was brought back to a T!  Can't wait to see season 3.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Overall great book. Sparks delivered a well written love story/suspense. Great quick read,easy to get lost in<br />Would absolutely recommend
B009ZE27US|1.0|tried it on several different people...apparently 25 is the magic number...we were all 25 years of age...from a 6 year old to a 45 year old
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Great season! Can't wait for the finale! Sad this season is already over, this show is one of the many loves of my life. A nice, refreshing take on the courtroom drama but with a comedic relief sprinked in. Thanks for a great season! Looking forward to many more!
B0014BY72Q|3.0|I suppose it just wasnt my cup of tea. I felt the story line could have been better developed. However, this one was probably cutting edge for it's time.
1416594795|5.0|Richard Dawkins is a very good writer who explains the complicated ideas of evolution clearly to those of us not schooled in biology and other related sciences.
1601251505|5.0|Just as every professional review has stated, this is the absolutely perfect primer for introducing someone to roleplaying games. It comes STUFFED with everything you need to get started except other players to enjoy it with. Rule books, pre-generated characters, monster tokens and even dice. Worth every penny even at full price if you are a serious gamer. It took me back to the days of the original D&D Basic Set (the 80s Red Box, not the more recent 4e version).
B00005A0ZH|1.0|We have the music by Vangelis and wanted to see the movie.  We purchased it but when we  tried to play it found that it could not be viewed in the United States.  Why?
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Not a bad app for the price. I definitely do not regret my purchase and think almost everyone who gets this will feel the same way.
B000025SL5|5.0|We were on a boat cruise in on the Seine in France and the captain played the theme song every time we pulled away from the dock.  I was captivated then by the music and still am.  Beautiful!
B004HX4RT6|4.0|Not a bad app for the price. I definitely do not regret my purchase and think almost everyone who gets this will feel the same way.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|I've always been a fan if the FF series, and playing this kindle version was a blast. The graphics are sharp and gameplay was easy. This is a good game for someone new to RPG's as it is pretty easy to manuever around and figure out the puzzles. I think  this game is a nice addition to my games loaded on my kindle.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey continues in its third season. We meet new characters, some which stay and some that don't. One thing you can rely on is the fact that the drama and intrigue remain the same! Things are changing at Downton Abbey, but at least that always remains!
B009OYTAL8|3.0|I enjoyed the first season and thought this might go somewhere.  Unfortunately, if you've seen one episode, you've seen them all.  This angsty, teen-oriented superhero show is about a guy who methodically takes out every major criminal in his town cause his criminal dad told him to.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Spectacular book and the series just keeps getting better and better!!!! Love it!!!! Highly recommended for anyone who likes these types of stories.
B009IJJB8G|5.0|I was suspect that anything could touch the BBC version of Sherlock, but this is easily just as good.  Very well done.  The plots are even more loosely based on Doyle's stories, but Johnny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu are amazing.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|Mumford & Sons are amazing. I have followed them since they started producing music and will continue to do so. Their music never gets old.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I flew through this book, and then deliberately took my time the second go 'round. As interesting as the stories are, the evolution of Charlie throughout is where the meaning lies. Humorously heartbreaking,and too honest to be predictable.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|Mumford & Sons are amazing. I have followed them since they started producing music and will continue to do so. Their music never gets old.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think subway surfer is a great game and tricky its good to have a little challange every once and a while
B008HK3XOU|4.0|Fits the case well and looks nice. Can be awkward at times, stains easily, and remains bent if used in stand form for to long.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|What a challenge when turning the cube...especially if you don't get the right angle.<br />This has proven to be one of our favorite puzzle games.
B0049VZ222|5.0|Anything involving The Walking Dead is amazing. I reccomend buying this. Also, if you like the show you should read the comics and play the game by telltale games.
B00992CF6W|5.0|All I need to say is that u should keep it graphics on fancy.AND PLAY IT! Me and my friends play multiplayer slot.(get a ripstick;)!)
B00APJLFEG|3.0|The title says it all. Some bits are funny, the idea had good potential, but overall it fails to deliver. Too many times the jokes are telephoned or cheap. The soundtrack is also rather cheap, original compositions are hard, but these were really cheap tunes. That said there some really good moments and I did laugh. Hard. But no more than 3 or 4 times so this gets 3 stars and no more.
B0019IB0II|5.0|I decided I needed to read this book after seeing an interview of Dr. Taylor on Oprah.  Stroke is such a mystery to most people and we never really understand what a stroke patient is experiencing.  Dr. Taylor experienced one herself and went on to relate her extremely fascinating story of what it's like to be the patient.  She also tells how to best care for and treat the patient while in the hospital and in recovery.  Armed with this understanding, love, patience and persistence we can help the patient recover, maybe never to the previous state, but to a very full life indeed. Her very detailed, yet easy to understand, explanation of what each part of the brain does, is so valuable for everyone to know, not just stroke victims.  Armed with this information, every one of us would be more valuable and effective should a loved one suffer a stroke, or some other brain injury, and need our love and attention.<br /><br />There is also a spiritual aspect to this book that is enlightening.  I think our Western way of thinking is so left brain that we often can't quiet the chatter enough to find the right brain peace that she describes.  In my opinion, whatever reason you decide to read this book, medical or spiritual, you will be glad you did.
B008P3SPVU|4.0|The film was uplifting and positive. The acting was good. Not among my favorite movies but watchable and over-all pretty good.
B0078XFYDA|5.0|We'd all be better off. Unfortunately, the people who most need to read it (creationists, religious fanatics and people who believe the fairy tales in the Bible and other sacred books) probably won't.<br /><br />Dawkins makes an unassailable case for reason over unreason, faith and dogma, while leaving an important role for love, sympathy, beauty and other things that lift our spirits.
B000OLX4SU|5.0|Thank goodness someone at least tried to go along with Mary Shelley's text. Very dramatic, horrific, but yet to be faithful to the text entirely.  The all star cast is of course amazing and make-up andspecial effects phenomenal.
B0083P1QUM|2.0|One of the most frustrating reads ever. 90% of the book is word diarrhea. In the middle of a conversation she'll go off on a two page tangent, and an unnessessary one at that. Scarpetta is a good pathologist but a very, very stupid person in other respects.<br /><br />I have had a similar problem with other Cornwell books but not as bad as this one. It's the last one I will read.
B007WDPPK8|2.0|This book was fine for learning, clear instructions and different options for casting on, and off etc. However the patterns aren't very nice, you can get much nicer ones for free on ravel and most of the tips in the book are in video form on youtube, and written in free forums all over the net, so unless your not able to use google, I wouldn't recommend it.
0470913029|3.0|I thought this book had some good points and was a nice read but I would not recommend it as great reading. The book was not life changing nor was it extrememly motivating. The book promoted eating healthy, lean meats, limiting fats and sugar, and eating a great deal of fruits and vegetables. I felt like this information is pretty standard rule for most people interested in the Paleo lifestyle. I didn't feel like there was a great deal of information on how to plan meals for the day to day- more just an overview of what can and cannot be eaten based on their individual take of the paleo diet. Too clinical- I was looking for something more personal and motivational.<br /><br />As someone who has been living the Paleo Lifestyle for a while I was looking for a more indepth look into the diet.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I had a Lifeproof case for two years that stood up to anything and everything, THIS ONE DIDN'T LAST A WEEK! I was so upset. It shattered and peeled in any instance. I thought I'd save a few bucks and buy it through amazon but that was a bad choice. Buy your Lifeproof through certified Lifeproof dealers only. This was upsetting.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Be wary of buying Lifeproof cases on from Alex's Electronics, the case was fake and broke while putting it together.
B005C0DHEY|5.0|I love documentaries.  This one was a surprise for me as I really hadn't known this was going on to the degree is is and the film pretty much proved how important a subject it is.  Loved seeing water burn (the gas really) as it came out of the faucet.  I couldn't help but identify with the home and land owners who have been abused by the big corporations yet again.
B0043RSK3K|5.0|20th century history from a leftist perspective.  A good counterweight to the conventional wisdom.  I'm half way through, but I've learned a lot.
0307352145|5.0|Cain is an immensely talented writer, and this talent carries the reader throughout the text, almost effortlessly.  She cites study after study in such an eloquent way, makes insightful connections between studies, and relates people in history (my favorite being Eleanor Roosevelt) to her thesis statement that there is strength in an otherwise frowned upon trait: introversion.  Highly readable/accessible, and includes a &#34;guide&#34; for how extroverts can relate to introverts.  Highly recommended!
B0015DROBO|1.0|Not sure why I let a friend talk me into getting this book. Typically when a book gets high ratings from the media I don't enjoy it. That truth applies to this book. Just not my thing.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I wasn't sure if I would like this book when I first started it,but after a few pages it picked up and I was hooked. I don't usually like fantasy type books, but this one was very entertaining. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B0031ES8P6|2.0|Was unhappy with the product. It was way to small. I would not recommend it to anyone. Waste of money.
B009GEEMLY|3.0|I payed for the HD rental and the video quality was standard at best. Was often so blurry it was hard to focus on anything. Gonna stick to standard rentals until this is improved, but there were no other issues everything else with the order was top notch.
B008KEQMDC|5.0|I loved the movie because it shows what couples go through when they are expecting a baby and what brings them together, tears them apart, and ultimately brings them back together.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|Coleen Hoover has a clever way of writing. I actually get a lot from reading her books. They make you feel good. A sweet romance with some meat to it but not too much.
B006BXT4TI|1.0|I paid an extra dollar for the digital booklet. Nothing but pictures of vans. VANS! OLD VANS!! PICTURES OF OLD VANS!!! PICTURES OF OLD VANS FOR A DOLLAR!!!!
B00A5052YE|5.0|This recording is a little different than her last recording because of the live studio work that is displayed here, however, her voice is still remarkable.  This woman is so talented that it's almost scary.  I enjoyed each and every song on this disc.  There wasn't a dud in the bunch and I played it a total of 4 times, back to back, in constant rotation on my car cd player.  Is there anything that this woman CAN'T sing?  If there is, then she would need to keep it to herself, because this cd, to me, was a total winner and I enjoyed it!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I look forward to playing this game.  It's fun reminds me of the games in the arcades.  Like that I get notices when coins will be filled and ready to play.  I've only had game for about a month now.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|This is an original TV series. I had to catch up on the first part of the series that I had missed.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|Shia LaBeouf is as always an excellent performer.  I was on the edge of my seat and was very tired at the end because of it. Great movie!!!
B005RUUUAI|5.0|More than just a horror series (the horror aspect largely dissipates by season 2 anyways), this series is an action packed, yet thoughtful production with depth and complex characters.  Keep up the good work AMC!
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|This is game is just not for me. It maybe a challenge for some people but I am not one of them.  Sorry.
1616550414|5.0|I cannot have any complain about this book. It's beautiful, it's complete and  the quality is so huge that I can't believe this cost only $20!<br /><br />Essential to any Zelda fan! I really want a Mario and Metroid version!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I thought this was quite entertaining.  It is the first one I have tried but have also purchased the Temple Run 1.
B009JBZH54|3.0|The action in this movied had much to be desired after watching the first two in the series.  Wish I had've gotten the dvd instead as it was 10 bucks cheaper.
B005HSL626|3.0|Humm, well this one did not do too much for me.  It is okay for light entertainment, but if you want to really exercise your brain, this isn't it!
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Although expecting a cliffhanger at end of season, was not expecting Matthew's demise.  Not happy with that ending at all,
B003FB0268|5.0|I love it! Excellent ordering process and find great value in this product! Highly reccomend it and see value for anyone!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I have not used Facebook on the Kindle enough to rate it.  I usually check Facebook on my iPhone 4.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I work in an extremely fast paced environment with people constantly talking (loudly) and my brain is ON from start to finish...so i count on games such as these to wind down once my day is over and im at home. I have to say, so far, i really like this game. Its enough of a challenge to make it worth playing, but not so difficult that ur brain has to do too much thinking. I love it!!!!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Playing Solitaire is my relaxation before going to sleep at night.  Large enough print and easy to play on the Kindle Fire!
B009VSW15Y|3.0|I have not figured out how to use the camera on the Kindel Fire, I takes pic of yourself, but not sure of it takes other shots...please let me know what I am doing wrong...
B0081336FO|5.0|The second season did not disappoint. The adventures of Sherlock for this season had one of my favorites The Hound of the Baskerville but with a new twist. Each of the episodes depict an original mystery but has been updated and surprise thrown in. Love this series.
B00902MCVY|4.0|I was waiting for something new from Jari Mäenpää and his band Wintersun.<br />The first album was amazing, and this second one worth the wait!!!
B00499NHLC|5.0|The portrayal of Sherlock in this series is one of the best I've seen. The story lines are interesting and the actors are perfect for the character
B005R32L66|5.0|The only limitations are due to work without a real keyboard and on a little apparate, but this is not depending by the software.<br />Skype for android works as the PC version! :)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I would have to say that u should be able to be in a competition when you need just a little love health and energy.
B00338QENI|5.0|I have posted the review for this book at [...] under \\"Book Reviews\\" category on my blog at darshanavnadkarni dot wordpress dot com.  Also I have posted reviews for \\"Cutting for Stone\\", \\"Galileo's Daughter\\" and so on.
B0027MJU00|2.0|Dennis Lehane's Shutter Island set the standard for me when it comes to suspense novels.  When I read the reviews for Dark Places, I thought I had found the novel to match it.  I was sorely disappointed and I wish I could get my weekend back.  To me, it seems odd to refer to a fiction novel's ending as contrived, but that was my first thought when I reached the \\"surprise\\" ending here.  I don't want to give anything away, so I will just say that this one came out of nowhere.  To the extent that there was any meaningful surprise, it had long dissipated by the time I read the 20 or so pages that followed.  Since I don't want to be completely negative, Gillian Flynn writes very well, and that is the only reason I was able to make it through this novel.  By the way, my second thought was that this would have made a better movie.  I now hear the movie is being made.  I am sure I will enjoy it.
0062231375|5.0|I love this book.  Love his vocabulary. So much fun to read. I've already read it twice.  will definitely buy more of his books.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Super great I really liked it. They over did themselves. I can not wait to read the mocking Jay . Super
B005IQ39AY|2.0|I was trying to find a similar game to Bubble Maniac, which unfortunately is no longer available.  Bubbles Touch is too slow.
B009LT1YZ6|2.0|I don't suggest wasting one dollar on this game. It is very boring. Plus the controls are tilting your screen and is often defective. I don't suggest buying this.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|I never thought Connery could be replaced but this guy, Danie Craig, does the best job I have seen so fa!r
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This app is too good but too slow to open.. i may give 5 if this issue is addressed in future.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I stumbled on the first book in this series by accident (was on a kindle someone loaned me). It had me hooked from the very beginning. What I love most besides the great story is the fact that there are 5 of them! When I was done with the first book I couldn't wait to get the second and they are sooo long that it feels like it's worth the price of buying the kindle version. I'm used to going to used books stores and getting paperbacks for $2.99 so the kindle can seem pricy. This is well worth it...I've told everyone I know.
B009ZQGNPQ|2.0|I'm done with Downton Abbey. Episode 6 ended my like for the show.<br /><br />1. They shouldnt take scripture out of context (he who is without sin shouldnt cast the first stone)<br />He says that but at the same time he (Lord Grantham) is contradicting himself by saying homosexuality is a sin. But in the next breath says he was born that way.<br /><br />Which one is it? That's nothing more than confussion. If you want to condone sin, dont use the Bible to do it.<br /><br />2. If God made people homosexual he wouldnt call it an abomination (Lev 20:13)<br /><br />If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood [shall be] upon them.\\"
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I could not get hold of this book fast enough after reading book one. Someone told me it was an HBO special. I think the book is probably better. I love that it's so long because I hate when a good book ends.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Read it!  One of DeMilles best.  I just love John Cory and can not wait for another andventure.  DeMille makes you feel that you know all them all like family.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I didn't realize this app was for the Android OS. Works great on my iPad. Interesting that it works with the Apple OS. I would recommend this app.
B005PK57NU|4.0|Good Wife need to be watched from Season One in order to keep up with al the characters. This episode was easy to watch on Amazon.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A little too long but very cool, the ending was interesting, I wont give anything away, however this is a very nice read, and a little too pricy
B008M721MS|5.0|I love this app because I can now talk to my Dad and I would definitely recommend this app to all my friends!!!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was so much more than I thought it would be and I am so thankful for every word. This amazing love story spanned over a long time and everything about it was intense. I am new to this author but I look forward to reading her other works.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Ok there's a high degree of violence....yes. The storyline, directing and superb acting of the characters makes this program a winner. Just don't let the kids watch it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really enjoy this game. It is extremely fun and very realistic. Totally worth it! I've always wanted a horse and now it's kinda like I do lol
B0055QYKQO|5.0|Im running and AMD 6200 at 4.5GHZ cooled by a corsairH80 which was very easy to overclock in bios specially sense every AMD cpu is unlocked and ready for overclocking. Also running a ATI 7770 1GB 128bit video card and 8GB of corsair 1866 ram and im running crysis on ultra setting running at solid 21 fps and all other games like CS:GO CS:S , D3, at 100 fps and skyrim on ultra setting with no problem (you cant display FPS is skyrim they max it at 60 anyways.)this board should be upgradable for years to come.
B008OOYALE|2.0|This game is fun but to play it u have to have patience and if u Don't have a good connection to wi fi u should get a different game
B0091QSNEE|4.0|I have a newly minted three year old that loves to &#34;cook&#34; for all of the guests at Doctor Panda's.  Very worth the low price.  Only negative?  The music gets to be a bit annoying.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best but please make the characters cheaper than it would be the best GAME ever thank you !!!!!!
B0044C3RB4|5.0|It is so easy to get addicted to this show. Not only is the sci-fi breathtaking but the characters are great!
B005O7Q6FM|5.0|What more can you say? Castle continues to entertain. The characters are great; the plots are interesting, although not necessarily realistic.  We thoroughly enjoyed it.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|we are new to the streaming video concept. We were very pleased tht we could watch the episodes on our computer as well as on our smart Tv. It gave us the chance to keep up with the series by purchasing episodes that we had missed during the current run.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|I was almost hoping he'd lie at the end and get away with the drinking and drugs.  Enjoyed the flying scenes.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Awesome cant say enough about this series if your a fan this is a must read so many twists now the wait for six
B004X4R49Y|5.0|enjoyed this movie.  I was a little girl when this was history.  A better understanding of what was happening.  Thanks.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Lots of content, low price. Gave the DVD to my parents, kept my Blu-Ray disc. Downloaded to iTunes seamlessly. Everyone wins!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Totally enjoyable series. Best casting ever. BBC, PBS combination equals greatness once again. Only downside is that I had to avoid season 3, which was difficult.
B008IBP24C|5.0|I can't say it enough!  This is the best series to come along in a long, long time!  The characters, the storyline, the scenery are all so interesting and introduction of new characters only add to the intrigue of day-to-day living at Downton Abbey.  I can't recommend this series enough so watch it and you will be back for more!
B004ROPSHA|5.0|arrived fast and in great shape.  I will not write long reviews.  You did a great job......  for my daughter
B003U0AHBO|5.0|Finally!  A movie depicting how Robin Hood came to be and lived with British actors who have the correct accent. The movie is well scripted, the scenery is bar none and the actors are A-list! Very good movie and highly recommended!
B00005QFE5|4.0|The Road Home was a very simple story, but it showcased Zhang Ziyi's early in her acting career.  She was already adorably cute at such a young age.
B0072GPQNG|4.0|While the movie was good mainly because I am a sucker for any movies about horses, I wish it was a little more interesting.  Still a good movie all in all.
B004SIP9MY|5.0|Scream is still my favorite horror movie and I am happy to finally have added it to my dvd collection after wearing out my original copy.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This version of Temple Run is far more interesting than the original one but has some of the touches from the classic version. This time you need to catch extra things such as gems which adds to the fun.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|movie starts out well, but turns into a story about alchaholism.  Good acting, but very melancholy and tedious.  Not a great feeling when it's over.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Good challenge but not overwhelming.  Nice devirsion from tv watching. Very responsive to the touch. You will not be disappointed
B0098G7AWS|5.0|The movie is great but what really impressed me was Amazon's customer service. When I rented the movie on Instant Video, it was extremely slow to load, if it loaded at all, and it was very frustrating to pause it and try to resume at a later time. Without me even contacting Amazon, they recognized the problem I was having and refunded my money. I am very impressed with them and this is the type of customer service that keeps me renewing my Prime membership year after year.
B00005JKCH|5.0|I bought this for my grand-son to see. He was delighted !<br />He loves spider-man and this dvd is worth it to watch.<br />I was pleased with the price and how quickly I recieved it.
B0057UA4FY|5.0|I've wanted this for a long time. I was totally impressed. The quality of animation, the characters. Just everything is perfect.
B009IEXKXI|3.0|This was an enjoyable read. The premise : think \\"Cast Away\\" (the Tom Hanks movie) on Mars. It is well-executed. Everything that happens feels believable and realistic. It's not boring at all. You might not feel compelled to stay up late at night to finish it but you will be curious to know what happens next.<br /><br />Most of the novel is based on the log-book kept by the abandoned astronaut. This worked well, but the transition to the other segments describing the action on Earth and in other places was a bit clumsy.<br /><br />Why did I mention it might appeal mostly to men ? The main character is a man and 80% of the story is about the way he handles practical and technical problems. There is hardly anything there about his feelings (which is a pity). I found the various solutions he came up with quite interesting and entertaining but I know my wife would be bored senseless.<br /><br />Why not four stars ? Well there's hardly any characterisation, even for the main character. The author has completely dispensed with the psychological aspect of being stranded far away from home. Our hero is basically a wisecracking monument to stoicism who doesn't know despair, panic or fear and is entirely unaffected by prolonged loneliness. A psychological layer would have made \\"The Martian\\" much better and - if done well - added a 4th star. the good thing is that the author doesn't even try to go into the feelings & moods stuff, which is better than to try and fail IMO.<br /><br />A warning perhaps : the hero of the story continually cracks jokes and tries to make light of his predicament. I didn't mind and even had to smile and laugh some times but I can see how this could turn some readers off if they don't appreciate that kind of humour. All I can say is that it's not the constant-barrage-of-4-letter-words-and-sexually-charged type of humour. No blasphemy either.<br /><br />Why not five stars ? That is for masterpieces, guys come on.
B00821OX98|5.0|I was bored and curious so I started watching Falling Skies.  Then I was so completely sucked in.  I'm not really into alien shows but what I enjoy is watching how the survivors band together, their interactions, etc.  I am on the last episode of Season 2 but am holding off watching it because Season 3 hasn't started yet.  This is why I don't ususally get into a show until every season is out.  I'm so hooked!
B002GHIPYI|4.0|This things fit great and sound awesome. So far my only complaint is that the cord could be a little longer. Other than that these things are awesome.
B00A7ZWUJC|3.0|Like most of Rihanna's albums, this one has some really great memorable (even classic) pop songs on it, but there are the tiresome thug/street cred/hip hop moments that seem forced to me.  I don't care how tough Rihanna is or how many tattoos she has.  She has an amazing voice which is suited to singing dance pop and ballads.  When she does that, she fires on all pistons!
B004J4WKTW|3.0|I kept waiting for the action to pick up, it never really did.  But the story was excellent as was the characterization.
B002NVTBOU|5.0|This is a gem of a project with dimensions that fold with each track.<br />Highly recommend it.  Buika & Chucho Valdes.
B005HJ6MRO|5.0|This is an awesome drive.  I can access my data from anywhere!  And the backups are done automatically.  Wow what a nice addition to my system.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Game is fun. Very addicting,<br /> I downloaded it for my kids and thought I would try it out,<br />I couldn't put it down.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I really loved this book. I was right there in that boat, missing my family and worried how He was going to feed the tiger.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I just started this book yesterday and I'm only half way through but I love it!  Nicholas Sparks is a genius!
B0025KVLV0|5.0|One of my favorites. Watch the dvd to get a better insight. I need eight more words oh what to say.
B0098VYKSA|5.0|We both thoroughly enjoyed this movie!  Not sure why such a low rating from others.  Loved the darkness of the story and thought the acting was perfect for this genre
B000FUF6QS|4.0|Great movie and a wonderful ending. Now I must continue to type to get in all required words. done done
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I really loved these books and can not wait to see them in action. I love the story between peers and katniss
B000002UZ1|5.0|It is the BEATLES! I need not say anymore. Except that you want seven more words. Are you happy now?!!
B004VN39YG|5.0|i hate having to write these reviews and having a minimum number of words really makes me mad and upset
B003YNFYCO|5.0|The BEATLES, need I say more? That is right I need nine more words. How about, bite me you idiots!!
B007KOMTUI|4.0|waiting for next season.. I love downloading to Kindle and watch at lunch.  would definitely buy next season as soon as available
B007FIY3VW|3.0|Cannot find PowerPoint, anywhere and its driving me crazy! It keeps showing it can update but it wants access to a bunch of stuff and I'm not sure I want to give this app the freedom to my files... still unsure
B00992CF6W|5.0|best game ever!Why? because it is BOSS!!!!!!!!!!!!The updates are awusome to.I know a ........never mind. He He.........bye.I don't know what to talk about.
B004GHNIRK|2.0|Le Miserables this book was not as interesting as I thought and was heavy reading and was far too long
0782008372|5.0|Cult, yes.  Niche, yes.  Classic, YES!  Delivers a headslap to take you out of complacency, and just IMAGINE -- living forever, never aging, but vulnerable to the blade...YIKES!  Superbly done.
B004LWZW88|5.0|I enjoyed this movie.  I am a big kid and I love cats, especially Puss in Boots.  I have all the Shrek movies and I had to get this movie to add to my collection.  I loved the price, plus It came with DVD, Blue-ray and Digital copy.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|This game is amazing! But not amazing enough to get five stars. Over all,great game ROVIO!!! This is just my opinion. :-)
B0055PMJMW|3.0|a group of short stories that was easy reading,even good  reading  for young readers.. I have liked most all of michael connelly
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I wanted to read a Reacher book after seeing the movie Jack Reacher which was based on One Shot.  While the book was OK it lacked some real impact for me.  I will read another Jack Reacher book before deciding on the series.  I'm sure Reacher will mature as a character in subsequent books.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|this item was ordered by mistake,i donot do games,on my kindlei heve no other words for something I didn't intend to buy
B000FA5STS|5.0|The book had knurly plot and kept you wondering throughout.  You had to have empathy for Sidney Archer as she struggled to unravel the details of the plot.
B0085A9J18|5.0|I confess, I love Asian films and have long been a fan of martial arts flicks, good or bad. I mean, I'm a middle-aged woman and I'd rather watch a bad martial arts film than a good chick flick or rom-com. But The Raid: Redemption blows up both the martial arts and cop drama genres with a strong, fascinating story, brilliant cinematography and perfect, crisp martial arts sequences. Yes, you've seen all these themes before, but never in a package like this. I knew nothing of the story before we watched it, so every revelation was a great pleasure. It is violent and there is blood, so keep that in mind, but if you like cop dramas or martial arts flicks, I recommend this film without reservation.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have used Evernote for years on my PC and have been able to keep track of everything and anything with a few keystrokes. At this point I would be lost without it.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Yes, it is a soap opera with lovely costumes & locale. Very good acting & correct historical perspective. The story line of the upper crusts & the servants is a wonderful political statement. Enjoy!
B00683JK9K|2.0|Requires a lot of time. Would rather have a real physical puzzle. Would not install again even if it were free.
B009NQKXYK|2.0|The is a popular quote, &#34;The Journey is the Destination&#34;.  I'm sure whoever said that, didn't find themselves in a torture chamber at the end of the journey!  That's exactly what this movie is all about, it draws you in with a fair amount of unknowns, and slowly reveals a few things, and then reveals absolutely nothing about the plot of the movie itself.  In the end, this movie finds itself back at the beginning.  If you like chasing rainbows, this movie is for you, because there is absolutely no pot of gold, or end of the rainbow here, just some pretty eye candy and special effects with a very thin story.
B005PK553C|5.0|I loved this series!! Captivating and original. I enjoyed every episode. Keeps you guessing the entire season.  I would definitely recommend watching!
B009E3EY38|4.0|I actually just borrowed this set to get better audio from the bootlegs that popped up moments after the show. The sound quality was better than what I had, but one of my two disappointments (the other being the wish for more extended guitar solos like the old days) was that Jimmy didn't pitch shift everything for the CDs. I just can't listen to Stairway being played 2 pitches lower, nor the other songs, for that matter. They are good enough versions of songs, but sound slow and stilted played in a key that allowed Plant the freedom to tour with Alison Krauss without having to take a losenge. I got a trial version of pitch software online this morning and did it in 1/2 hour, and though my cheap attempt leaves Plant sounding a little thin, everything else sounds spot-on. Try it if the change in pitch is driving you away from listening to these CDs.<br /><br />Otherwise, NEW STUFF, JIMMY!!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|its very addicting and i cant put the game down. I Give this a 4 Star review becauee its worth mg whils
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|Did not like this search board. It was not effective for what I wanted. You type something specific and still brings up everything you don't need.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I use this app in waiting rooms of all sorts.  It's great.  I recommend this game for any time or place where pulling out an actual deck of cards is not an option.
B000VNMMR0|2.0|This movie could only be called a good movie if it was meant to be a parody of itself.  Over the top action and special effects. Each scene sillier than the one before.  Not worth the time or money.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This story was more about the seal team and what they went through as a normal part of what their training and &#34;job&#34; requirements were, The last part of the book was about the actual mission. I loved reading about what they had to do in order to become seals and maintain their traning.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is both a visually beautiful series and a well acted historical piece. It deals with the changes in the lives of the British aristocracy after World War I. The acting is superb; the interactions among the characters are compelling; the story line's twists and turns holds your attention.<br /><br />I must admit this has become a guilty pleasure for me. I've stayed up too late several nights now to watch more than one episode. I don't know what I am going to do when I run out of episodes.
B009FZFONO|5.0|best series i have seen in a long long time. Good actors playing characters you care about and cant wait to see what happens to them.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|The movie wasn't bad, the books by James Lee Burke are  better.  Maybe it would've rated 5 stars had there been different people playing the rolls.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|App is fun and shows the care required to maintain horses. Would be better if gems were not necessary.  If you like horses give it a try.
B004SDSSFY|2.0|This app was so so and worked ok my dislike was that I had to log on to amazon when ever i wanted to use it
B00AYDC5HY|2.0|I generally like Tim Burton's work. While the actual animation is very good I continually saw the same characters Tim Burton has used in other animations. I get the feeling that he was just going through the motions with this one instead of spending time to create something from scratch. If there had been a little more originality to the characters and plot it would have made for a better film.
B00AH34AUQ|4.0|Good album consistent with Green Day's Alt Rock style. However, as it is noted, this is the explicit version of the band's album. As such, it is not for younger listeners &#60; 16 y/o, IMO
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|Love it<br /><br />Action, suspense, great story line, creature relatable, crazy amazing visual stimuli all here<br /><br />I recommend it to everybody, faithful trekkies and new fans alike
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great read! Light tears and a warm heart throughout! Highly would encourage anyone looking for a good love story to read.
B008FTAAG2|5.0|awesom jsut so hot whne a woman sings rock awesom awesom awesom awesom awesom awesom awesom awesom awesom awesom awesom
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I had been waiting a long time to watch season 3.  It didn't disappoint .  Just as good as 1 and 2.  I love this series.  Now I can't wait for season 4.
B00457WZEI|5.0|Will Joey the horse and Albert the farm boy ever see each other again? Albert and his horse, Joey are living peacefully on their British farm. When WWI breaks out, Joey is sold to the military. Albert is determined to see his horse again, and he goes to war searching for his beloved horse. Joey and Albert fight to see each other again. They keep fighting and fighting and fighting, destined to see each other again. There is a strong possibility they might never see each other again. Read to find out!<br /><br />I loved this book because of its strong emotional content, well-assembled plot, and that it draws the reader closer with each flip of a page. I think this book is very inspiring. It proves that even a small amount of love for something or someone can literally get you through an entire war. It really filled me with emotion. I think this book would bring anyone a great amount of feeling. Now think of all the books you've ever read, pick out the good ones. Think of why you loved it, the plot, the characters, the humor, and the emotion. Now wrap all those books up, now what you are thinking of is the novel War Horse. That is why I loved it so much. It is truly amazing. Read it, or you'll regret it!
B00683JK9K|5.0|I enjoy this app.  You can make it as hard or easy as you like.  Kind of meditative, like solitaire.
B004TI5N38|4.0|Hey its David Baldacci. You cannot go wrong when you select one of his books. It is kinda of like listening to a story told by an old friend. Although I think the plot was a bit of a stretch, the story was knitted together well. Very Entertaining.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Excellent read. Cohesive and engaging plot line and the story snapped all the way through. What made this book for me was the rich detail on the time period.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I'd read previous reviews and ratings of J. K. Rowling's first adult targeted novel before I bought the Kindle edition. Most of what I read was luke warm about book, so my expectations weren't very high. Now that I've read The Casual Vacancy, I can say without reservation that I am looking forward to Ms. Rowling's continued exploration of non-fantasy fiction. The characters were well drawn, the narrative was well done, and the story line was interesting. Much in the style of Maeve Binchy, we get to look at the same events through the eyes of different participants, each person's story weaving a clearer image of what happened while filling in more details about the back-drop of the community and the relationships between the characters.
B004L3AR0K|5.0|This is a fantastic movie!! I would highly recommend it to anyone, especially if you know of someone with a illness.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Just as you think figured it out, there is another twist!  Makes you wonder if the author had a bad marriage.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|it will not be the same I love my famliy more ohh I k n o w j h d I e
B00BESIKWM|1.0|I am a huge fan of the game and have played all except the first. The story.....horrible. So many holes such horrible dialog. Special effects ......horrible.  It's not worth the 4bucks catch it on tv and save your money.
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|This is a really enjoyable game. Creative and whimsical with good replay value. Everything about it is really top notch... from the music to the art design to the gameplay itself.<br /><br />This was a free app of the day last week and I almost feel guilty getting it for free.<br /><br />Major kudos to the designers. Good job!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think there should be more games like thisone because I love horses so much. this is by 1D lover maddie
B006LSZECO|2.0|The story kept you on edge wondering who did what to whom but I hated the way the author played her characters lives.  I didn't see a redeeming likeable character in the entire book.
B001JNNDGA|5.0|Aramaic with English SUBTITLES.  They should of did it in a English version too I think.  Amazing Quality in 1080p.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|Good acting as usual but I am tired of seeing movies about drug and alcohol abuse.  There is so much bad on the front page of the newspaper...I go to the moves to escape and be entertained...You leave this move feeling bad.  Not good.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I never saw that ending coming! What a fabulous read. Tears ran down my face as I read the letter. I enjoyed this book so much. Nicholas Sparks is FANTASTIC!!!!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I just discovered this series and I love it.  The time period is interesting and the hierarchy of the staff and household members is something I didn't really know a lot about.
B000W15B24|5.0|This song is great for anyone with any kind of music taste! I would recommend the whole album or you can buy individual tracks, but there is something here for everyone.
0345803493|1.0|The thought of Ana's inner Goddess wearing skates on the uneven bars captures the Bizarro World nature of this \\"book\\". You find yourself wondering how this found its way into print. How it could have made anyone rich. How you find yourself reading this repetitive tripe. Has the whole world gone mad?<br />Surely someone will tell us the punchline soon. Pul-lease tell me the punchline!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Good developing story with some interesting twists throughout. Kept me going until the end. Good reading for diversion and relaxation.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|excellent fun game to play five year hold loves to play it on my I phone and on his tablet
B0095P29EG|4.0|A very enjoyable adaptation of the comic.  Great effects, good acting and enjoyable characters. Would definitely recommend this movie.  Can't wait for the sequel.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|One of my FAVS for sure!! I loved the cast and the acting!! A+++++!!!!!!!!<br />So funny and fun to watch!!!!!!!
B0095P33IW|5.0|What a fun movie.  A great adaptation of the comic.  Excellent effects, great acting and of course warm characters.  Hopefully there will be more of Cap.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|I am a big fan of Meryl Streep and this is such a wonderful movie.  I watched it once with my mother and we both enjoyed it.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|This film is not pretty! Denzil Washington makes the performance seem effortless but he has really done is show Perfection with a capitol &#34;P&#34;. I watched this film and realised that this film does everything suspense,speed (the flying sequence) and life.<br />It is raw and at times almost scary but watch it and then watch it again as it is well taking the flight!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This book clearly represents top-notch scholarship.  It is written in a easily read prose.  It provides even the amateur historian with invaluable insights.
B004U52VPS|4.0|this was a great christmas gift that my son who is 8 got.  We also bought one for a birthday party
1451696191|5.0|A Phenomenal Read and Emotionally Honest.  It will stir your emotions leaving you craving for more. Fantastically vulnerable and wickedly smart.
B009VL2AD4|5.0|I came across this album by accident, not really being aware of the artists' prior work, but vaguely remembering (and liking) the song the Moldy Peaches did in Juno (I know that wasn't Binki S though).<br /><br />There are shades of Velvet Underground here, yes, but there is something in the combination of Shapiro's understated voice and Green's rich baritone that is more like a classic country era collaboration...anyway, irresistible to me. Some have compared Adam Green to Jonathan Richman because of his non sequitur lyrics. Well, (a) you won't find those kind of lyrics in this release. These are sweet, subtle songs. And (b) I can't stand Richman's voice. Very different sound!  And (c) I think this release definitely has an earnestness I haven't heard in any of Richman's work.<br /><br />I love the complex lyrics (not your basic love songs) and unexpected instrumentation that do not get old no matter how many times you hear them-- and I have heard them many, many times over the past few weeks! Can't stop playing this.<br /><br />Highly recommended. I hope the duo do a second collaboration!<br /><br />Now I'm going off to explore the artists' other work. I'm starting off by buying Adam Green's album [[ASIN:B0032IAB60 Minor Love]].
B005MYEQ4U|4.0|One of Allan's first films, without him in a starring role, takes a nostalgic look at artist in the early 1900's in a flight of fantasy.
B0030IG0C6|5.0|I gave this statue and the rearing unicorn to my 4 year old granddaughter for Christmas.  They are so beautiful and sturdy.  She admired the set I had and now loves her own set.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I Love this show... It is very addicting. If you like period piece shows this is a gem. I highly recommend it.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading The Thirteenth Tale.  It was a story with lots of twists and turns that kept you guessing until the end.  I would highly recommend this book to any who enjoys historical fiction and is a fan of author Kate Morton.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Easy to use. Works great on my Coby. Got several books and they all downloaded fine. Glad I got it
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Couldn't put it down!<br />Worth the money, great fiction and easy to add history to for students. Fantastic and worth my time.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book kept you on the edge of your seat the entire time, evoking emotions that made me not want to put it down. One of the best books I've read in a while.
B0006GQMC8|5.0|I've watched this movie twice so far and I'm ready again.  It's a hidden gem.  Not high action, excellent story, excellent acting.  This movie is good from beginning to end.  Basically, Bronson is hunted by Lee Marvin and a posse- won't say more.  Watch it. It's an oldie but goodie!
B0083GQ2A0|2.0|I did not like it; the movie was so borring that I failed to stay awaked while watching it last night.
B000FC1HBY|3.0|Although I blasted through the first book, I am seriously dragging through this second book in the Game of Thrones series. I keep hoping that things will pick up to the pace they set in the first book, but I am sadly disappointed.  The character development is overdone and I am really not interested in spending two pages reading about someone scrubbing floors. If this will have some lasting impact on the character later in the story, I'll be greatly surprised.  I am about 60% of the way through and there is still time for this author to save the day and create some activity or action as he did in the first book.  That's what hooked me, please don't let me down!
B00B3MN65K|5.0|Consistently fantastic entertainment!!! a must for any Josh Groban fan. Waited a long time for his work again.Worth the wait.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I am overwhelmed by the dedicate And love for country that these men and women have. It was a privilege to read this book.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I find myself draining the battery when I play this game. It makes you think without being overbearing or overtaxing on the ol' brain. ;-)
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I always cry by the end of Mr. Sparks' books and this one wasn't any different.  First because such a beautiful ending and second because it's the end of the story.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The actual story is good but there is way too much sex.  The sex are pages long.  Just too much.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Another Sparks hit!  He hits the &#34;nail on the head&#34; with every new book!  How can one author be so talented?!!!  I haven't been disappointed yet with one of his books.
B005LAII0I|2.0|Really wasn't impressed with this movie. None of it made much sense. The acting was horrible. Don't waste your money.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|i love the idea that i can use this app on my phone and see all my files directly on my phone without having to change the file extension.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Dont be fooled by the cartoon like graphics -these games offer challenging levels and fun, progressive levels. If you spend time playing games you MUST get this!
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Just what i needed the comfort of purchasing through amazon my favorite music! The prices are unbeatable , will definitely recommend to others
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|Would be great if it told you how to get rid of people you no longer want to play with. Or time out after a number of guesses.  I may uninstall just to get rid of some of the annoying people who don't play ... they write the answers
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie was excellent! I really enjoyed the music and the storyline. I was laughing and enjoying everyone of the selection in the movie. I am going to buy the soundtrack.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|I enjoyed it for the type of movie it is, he action, the bit of drama, and special effects that it showed
B00459EZLW|5.0|This program slowly grew on me. The premise of the show, a group of highly skilled scientists and super skilled military people stranded on a ship billions of light years from home. The space ship they are on, the Destiny, is over a million years old, constructed by a long gone civilization of technological advancement far beyond our own. While these elements of the show sparked my interest and are what kept me watching at first, as I started to figure out the plot and got to know the characters I became hooked. I just wish the show could have continued so we could see the Destiny finally uncover the deep mystery of structure in the cosmic microwave background.
B00633W614|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I then read the second book in the series and can't wait for the next to come out.
B000OW8DW6|5.0|Very disturbing but great film, beautifully acted. It shows a world that might be possible--a scary world of the future.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app.  It's a little harder to determine how much battery time is left on my Kindle, and I use my Kindle more than any of my devices.  I leave this in my carousel, and I can tell immediately when to recharge it.  I think is visual is really cool as well as informative.  Definately one of my favorite apps.....
B009GX69RK|5.0|This show is modern yet absurd, as a comedy should be, reflecting a good combination of reality and the imagination we seek in television.
B0052AC8C6|4.0|This was a fun little movie to while away a couple hours with. Johnny Depp and the rest of the cast do a great job!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Really enjoyed this one, besides the lack of sleep from not being able to put this down I have no complaints.  Looking forward to more.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I have been a fan of James Bond films for nearly forty years. In addition, I have nearly every James Bond film on DVD or Blu-Ray. This is by far one of the best. It has all the unique elements of the past Bond films uniquely integrated into one complete package. Daniel Craig does a superior performance as James Bond and Judi Dench as M is highly memorable. Even the new actors in the film portray the familiar qualities of past colleagues and nemeses, which as fans, we except to see. The picture quality of this film is wonderful, crisp, and colorful, while the audio is sharp with no apparent issues. If you have seen this film, you know you want it; if you have not seen it, you need to get it. End of discussion.
B00BHASVQC|3.0|I suppose if this story is new to people they might find it entertaining.<br />I would if I hadn't read all the books YEARS ago and already know exactly what happens.<br />Still, I think there's been some truly bad casting to this series.<br />I suppose HBO was trying to keep it on the cheap, so had to settle for what was in the budget and got several budget actors.<br />Sean Bean, the most accomplished actor and no doubt, highest priced, was killed off in the first season.<br />Lena Heady is all wrong for Cersei.<br />Never heard of nor seen any other single actor in the series. Hence the cheap casting.<br />I'll admit the scene settings and costumes are good, but I find nothing special in any of the acting.<br />If you've read the books, don't expect much more than a mediocre showing.<br />My own imagination conjured up a far better portrayal of this series while I was reading it 'lo so many years ago.allowed this kind of hollywood soft-porn crap to taint his work.<br />The only artistic license taken in this series is over two whores lesbian sex scene.<br />Color me shocked.<br /><br />So, in conclusion, if you haven't read the books, ENJOY !!!<br />If you have read the books, don't expect much.<br />Sadly, I DID expect much and was quite disappointed.<br />It is a fairly well done show, but for a long time fan like myself it all just fell flat for me.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Although there was not much of a plot, this movie is very funny and the perfect escape for two hours. The music was great and the characters are funny.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|This American Idol winner is going to go far.  Loved the music!  I suggest this as a must have for any collection..
B004T6IBNY|5.0|Good app. Anyone who loves pinball must get this app!!! Never ending 5 different levels. Worth the money. There is not a better app for pinball then this!!!!
B004I2K4E8|5.0|I love all the music of Les Miserables.  I kept watching this concert over and over again on YouTube and then after the movie came out, it was gone.  So I ordered the DVD from Amazon.  I loved all the performances, all the signing was awesome.  I know some people had a problem with Nick Jonas as Marius but I don't think he was all that bad.  I love the movie too, but to just listen to the music, I prefer this concert.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I had high expectations for this NDE book, but was slightly disappointed in the delivery.  There is too much technical terminology and doctor gobbledy gook  (we're not all brain surgeons), with regard to the research performed to try to rule out that anything but a NDE took place.  Conversely, the other problem was that there were too many &#34;cutesy&#34; descriptions of the details of what happened while in a coma.  It seemed like baby talk, using words a very young child would use to describe things (earthworms, butterflies, etc.).  While I appreciate that it must be extremely difficult to describe something so fantastical, I would rather have it delivered more in &#34;regular speak&#34;.  Also, I felt more time could have been spent on the actual details, but again, I suppose there were no other words to use.  Overall, I did enjoy the book and would recommend it to anyone interested in NDE's and what happens when we die.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Great figures, nice variety of games.  easy to play.  i look forward to playing again.  cant think of anything else to write
B0035JNRXU|4.0|Some of the movies are over the top in their effort to appeal to the public at large, rather than hard core trekkies.  This one, however, has more trekkie appeal than mass appeal.
B008ODZEQ0|4.0|Many people admire the work ethic and focus given to a task that was characteristic of the older Japanese generation. It is inspirational to see but nobody is actually willing to live that way now. Also, the movie is a bit longer than it needs to be.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|007 has done it again. A suspensfull movie with a great storyline. The mortorcycle scenes were great and unbelievable to watch.
B009LH1Y1W|1.0|I think that this show should have ended with season 5. Eight season is the worst season so far. It is as if actors forgot how to act, dialog seems forced and artificial and all of the jokes are flat and predictable. Back story is weak as well.
0545128285|5.0|The book was shipped the same day, and it arrived in the mail exactly when it was supposed to. It is in the condition described (shelf wear only), and I could not be happier with my purchase! Would buy again.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|I, like many others i am sure, have tried many different programs, but avast never seems to disappoint. The free version is just as good and as long as you carefully make your way around the information superhighway you will be fine. Great program!
B0044C5SCU|5.0|I never thought I would get into this type of science fiction, but I am totally hooked on this series, and I dread coming to the end of the final season. The characters are great. Walter sucks you right in. He's such a complex, conflicted, brilliant, and lovable character that you can't help but fall in love with him. Peter off-sets Olivia's intensity perfectly so that their relationship is a natural. Astrid & Walter are precious together.<br />As far out & weird as the story gets, the writers always find a way to base it in science & to make it believable. It stretches your mind, making you consider ideas you've never thought of before. The idea of the alternate universe is intriguing to say the least.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I had seen the previews and heard about this movie from friends before watching it, so I was already aware of the content.  This is a great movie to remind you of the order of priorities, making tough decisions, surrounding yourself with supportive people & making decisions now for your life, so life doesn't zip by & you are faced with regret.  This is a great movie for tweens to grandparents, especially new & growing families.  It lights a fire to be intentional about your family.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I couldn't put it down!  I started it and finished it in one day.  I hope that the movie is as good as the book.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|You feel as though you really know the characters in this book! But I'll warn you ...be ready for an emotional roller coaster!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved it! One of the best books I have ever read. Am almost crying at the ending. Can't wait to start book 2!
0061478784|5.0|My daughter saw this on TV and realized She HAD to have it. Its my daughters favorite movie of all time.
B00B5HQLMI|2.0|slow, boring, predictable, the writers were searching and found a lame bad guy to finish with. Waste of my money, I'm a victim of the hype.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|It's typical Daniel Craig action as Bond with a few intriguing plot twists. Hardly a dull moment, plus a new look into the life of James Bond.
B009AP2G26|5.0|This is a great ensamble cast for teenagers so young.  The acting is fresh and the dramatic scenes are acted well and thoughtfully.  Great Sereis!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|While I think that Hopeless, is well-written, I think that the plot was very slow-moving.  I kept waiting for something significant to happen and felt that the author spent too much time on developing the relationship between the heroine and her boyfriend.  I would not recommend this book to a peer but would suggest that it be more appropriate for a young adult.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|This series about a very very &#34;white shoes&#34; law firm is filled with dramatic episodes and it is very well acted.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|This is cheaper than a phone battery and charges a lot of things.  My wife is not able to plug her iTunes into computer at work and she is nowhere near a plug.  I bought her this charger and she loves it.  She charges both her devices rapidly.  I use it at restaurants and waiting rooms when I play battery draining games on my phone.  Recommend this
B008ASGP3U|4.0|The ending is the least important part of many of Rankin's stories. There were times reading &#34;Stand in Another Man's Grave, that I could feel the cold and endless beauty of the country. A country Rebus inhabits to the core of his existence on the printed page.  It's the journey he takes inside his skin. No cell remains uncharged for long.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's a fun addicting game and is great for any animal/horse lover. The only downside is that it's not so easy to get gems
B004LZFWJO|5.0|This is actually one of the 1st apps Noah insisted I get for my new Kindle Fire. But this is the 2nd item I am reviewing. It is a very fun game. After playing a few times he was amazed that my score was in the 5000 range ( I didn't tell him till later that i found how you can turn the timer off and play forever). Naturally he had to play to beat my score. We have also played variations to get all peppermints, or all kisses, etc. The most we have been able to ever clear at 1 time is 26 pieces. That has made the app even more fun as we try to calculate how to make what drop to reveal more of what we are going for that game. I highly recommend this game to all age groups.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Although I enjoyed the game...I KNOW it could have been better. I think that if the items costed less that it could be better.
B002N44XSG|5.0|They had a preview of the last Olympian it was awesome no words to describe and its and e-book wow
B003WUYRGI|5.0|LOVE IT. I HAVE READ MANY BOOKS BUT ALWAYS LIKED THIS ONE.I LOVE READING IT.ITS REALLY AWESUME.. . . .
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book was amazing and I enjoyed watching Percy Grover and Annabeth go on an adventure. Had many twists and turns. I would recommend this book to everyone.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|Delightful story. Loads of fun. Whoever dreamed this up was really enjoying himself/herself. And I loved the werewolf pups! They were so funny. Made me feel sorry for their parents, they were such a handful. I look forward to seeing more from these creators.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|Not the best Bond ever, but eminently watchable and far from the worst. Daniel Craig continues to the the best Bond since Sean Connery, in my opinion.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Sad times, happy times, this household perseveres. Great acting of a good story in a fabulous house. All who leave the story are sadly missed.
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|I was actually impressed with this book. It's been on my TBR list for a long time and because of a book club I'm in is reading it, I finally picked it up. Harrison does a wonderful job creating a world where supernatural races live in the same world with humans and the humans are well aware of their existence.<br /><br />Pia is half wyr, half human. Her whole life her mother instilled in her to keep her head down, don't attract attention to herself. This has led to a pretty lonely existence for Pia. But when she does finally decide to trust that trust is thrown back at her by people who want to use her and her supernatural gifts. She is tasked with stealing from the most powerful Wyr in New York City (probably in all existence) and from there her life will never be the same again.<br /><br />Dragos is a dragon wyr. He's been alive for centuries and he's very powerful. He doesn't take it well when he discovers that someone has broken into and stolen from his hoarde. Of course he goes on the hunt for the thief. When he finally catches up with Pia he's intrigued by how interesting she is to him. He decides not to kill her just yet and instead changes his focus on to who or what would want Pia to steal from him and why.<br /><br />I liked the build up of the relationship between Pia and Dragos. It seemed to physically happen fast but emotionally it took quite awhile for both to come to terms. Harrison wrote Dragos as a great Alpha male. He doesn't become soft after finding his love. He's still scary and tough, but it's nice to see that even though everyone else is cowed by him, Pia isn't.<br /><br />I think Harrison did a wonderful job pacing this book. It didn't seem too rushed and yet a lot happens and gets resolved. Each book in the series will follow a different couple but Harrison did a good job of introducing certain storylines in order to pick them up with the next book and next character(s).<br /><br />I look foward to continuing this series!
B00A6RVRXG|4.0|I've followed Yo La Tengo for years and have clear favorites among their albums: Fakebook, Painful, I Can Hear the Heart..., And Then Nothing....  The opening track lured me in initially and keeps going off like a bomb every time I listen to it, and each time I let the disc play past that opening song, melodies and instrumental flashes seem to deepen and become sweeter and more memorable.  There is a sense in which the flow of the album makes it all seem like one long composition.  In the end, Fade may join the ranks of my very favorite Tengo albums.  I recommend it most highly.
B008JF8O9M|2.0|Hopefully I will soon find something other than the test page that it can print. No luck with web pages or hogs.
B008X8QCTO|5.0|...because unlike other developers, Alawar actually listens to their customers. (For example, I never had to pay for the bonus chapter. I bought this game for the TOTAL cost of $.99 - period.)<br /><br />LIKES:<br />1. Plot line was interesting yet simple. (Player is a Private Detective attempting to locate a missing reporter.)<br />2. Hints were plentiful.<br />3. The graphics were beautiful.<br />4. The were tons of scenes to explore & complete. (Besides HO scenes, there were puzzles to solve. Player also has to find certain objects throughout the circus to complete or unlock new locations.)<br />5. There were 2 different worlds - the \\"real\\" world at the abandoned circus and a magical realm as well.<br />6. The bonus chapter was surprisingly long.<br /><br />DISLIKES:<br />1. Sometimes the goals for a scene were unclear.<br />2. Player solves problem when the program allows it. For example the safe code is \\"greed.\\" But because I didn't return to the car & play the tape in the car stereo I wasn't allowed to have the solution even though this particular answer was easily figured out early on.<br /><br />I would absolutely recommend this game.
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|The crash scene was phenominal...very exciting and what the character did to save the plane was instinctually genius... but all the other stuff was mostly irrelevant.... yes, very bad that he was high... .but he did save them....  and the witch hunt to get him after that was implausible... though bad to be high, and some consequence was needed, the plane stalled/crashed because of a malfunction - documented in the movie -- not because of pilot error.... the whole thing just didn't hang together logically....<br />a plot made up to show the problems of alcholism .....  that said, Denzel Washington's portrayal was spot-on, and top-notch as always but in an otherwise mediocre movie.
B000YABS8E|3.0|Great concept for a movie in light of the popularity of doomsday prepping...except this movie was made prior to the latest \\"fad.\\". Not as many laughs as I expected, but another great performance from Sissy Spacek.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|One hell of a show I wish Amazon could get it the same night it airs on TV but I still don't mind waiting.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was quite different from the books I normally read, but many friends recommended it so I thought I would try it.  I'm so glad I did because I loved it.  Kept me interested from the beginning until the last page.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Very good movie, kids really enjoyed it. Glad to see that the old SNL group can do kid movies as well.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Not much different from other solitaire games but no problems so far. Fun when killing time waiting for my daughter .
